Although these haven't been officially\nattributed to Russian state-sponsored threat actors, their goals align with the Russian\nmilitary's. It is widely theorized that these cyberattacks are intentionally being launched in\nconcert with the invasion.\n\nWith wiper malware in the spotlight, we at FortiGuard Labs wanted to provide more\ninformation on this threat to help organizations understand it and implement better\nprotections against them. In this blog, the following topics will be discussed:\n\nWhat is a wiper malware?\nThe motivation for threat actors to use them\nInteresting properties that can influence the effectiveness of the malware\nWiper techniques under the hood\n\n\n-----\n\nProtections provided by Fortinet\n\n## Definition\n\nThe wiper term in wiper malware comes from its most basic function, when the objective of\nthe malware is to wipe (erase) the hard disk of the victim machine. More generically, wiper\nmalware can be defined as malicious software that tries to destroy data. As we will see in the\nfollowing sections, there are different ways to accomplish this.\n\n## History\n\nBelow is a short history of notable wiper malware (also shown in Figure 1):\n\n**Shamoon, 2012: Used to attack Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas oil companies.**\n**Dark Seoul, 2013: Attacked South Korean media and financial companies.**\n**Shamoon, 2016: Returned to again attack Saud Arabian organizations.**\n**NotPetya, 2017: Originally targeted Ukrainian organizations, but due to its self-**\npropagation capability, it became the most devastating malware to date.\n**Olympic Destroyer, 2018: Attack targeted against the Winter Olympics in South**\nKorea.\n**Ordinypt/GermanWiper, 2019: Targeted German organizations with phishing emails in**\nGerman.\n**Dustman, 2019: Iranian state-sponsored threat actors attacked Bapco, Bahrain's**\nnational oil company.\n**ZeroCleare, 2020: Attacked energy companies in the Middle East.**\n**WhisperKill, 2022: Attacked Ukrainian organizations in parallel with the Ukraine-**\nRussia war.\n**WhisperGate, 2022: Attacked Ukrainian organizations in parallel with the Ukraine-**\nRussia war.\n**HermeticWiper, 2022: Attacked Ukrainian organizations in parallel with the Ukraine-**\nRussia war.\n**IsaacWiper, 2022: Attacked Ukrainian organizations in parallel with the Ukraine-Russia**\nwar.\n**CaddyWiper, 2022: Attacked Ukrainian organizations in parallel with the Ukraine-**\nRussia war.\n**DoupleZero, 2022: Attacked Ukrainian organizations in parallel with the Ukraine-**\nRussia war.\n**AcidRain, 2022: Attacked Viasat's KA-SAT satellite service provider.**\n\nFigure 1: Wiper malware timeline\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this section, we will look at the different motivations behind deploying a wiper malware.\nWhile its goals are straightforward, that does not mean that the motivation is always the\nsame. We distinguish between the following four potential motivators: financial gain,\ndestruction of evidence, sabotage, and cyberwar.\n\n### Financial Gain\n\nIn general, financial gain is the least significant motivator for wiper malware. This is\nunderstandable because it is hard to monetize destruction. However, one aspect we wanted\nto point out here is the fake ransomware variant that pretends to encrypt data and ask for a\nransom, but without the capability to recover data. This could be called a ransomware scam\nbecause the ransomware concept is fraudulent. Threat actors employing such techniques\nare simply looking to make a quick buck without investing in developing an actual\nransomware tool or in the administration work behind an actual ransomware operation. Of\ncourse, such an enterprise is short-lived because once it gets out that it is not possible to\nrecover data, nobody will pay the ransom.\n\nA good example is the Ordinypt or GermanWiper, which was active in 2017. As\nransomware does, it altered files and added a random 5-character extension to them. It also\ndestroyed recovery options, such as the Windows shadow copy. And it changed the desktop\nbackground to display a ransom note with a Bitcoin address where the ransom payment was\nexpected to be sent. However, it did not really encrypt files. Instead, it filled them with zero\nbytes and truncated them. With this approach, there was no way to recover any affected\nfiles.\n\n### Destruction of Evidence\n\nThis is a hard-to-prove motivator, but sometimes when there is no other reason to deploy a\nwiper in an attack, it may be concluded that the real reason was something else, such as\nespionage. The wiper is only deployed after the true goal of the attack is achieved. Instead of\nmeticulously erasing their tracks and all evidence of their attack, the attackers simply deploy\na wiper malware in the organization. This not only erases the evidence, but the scale of the\ndestruction causes the defenders to focus on the recovery of data and operations and not on\ninvestigating the intrusion.\n\n### Sabotage\n\nSabotage is the most obvious reason to deploy a wiper. Just as the Stuxnet malware was\nused to destroy centrifuges to slow down Iran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons, wiper\nmalware could be used to destroy data, sabotage development, cause financial loss, or just\ncause chaos.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne example in this category is the Shamoon malware, used to attack Saudi Aramco and\nother oil companies. The attack destroyed 30,000 workstations at Saudi Aramco. At such a\nscale, even replacing these computers becomes a logistical nightmare. The attack was also\nscheduled for a time when a holiday had just started to maximize its impact by counting on\nthe limited staff available to respond to the attack.\n\n### Cyberwar\n\nA few months ago, it would not have been as straightforward to include this motivation in the\nlist. But at the time of this post, seven different wiper malware attacks (WhisperKill,\nWhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, DoubleZero, AcidRain) have been\ndiscovered targeting Ukrainian infrastructure or Ukrainian companies—all clearly in line with\nRussia's interest in the Ukraine-Russia war. Generally, wiper operations in this category\nattack targets whose destruction is in the interest of the opposing military. For example, the\nmotivation behind such an attack might be to cripple critical infrastructure. This could be\ndone to either cause chaos and increase mental stress on the enemy or to cause destruction\nat a tactical target. Wiper attacks can also have a devastating effect against OT and critical\ninfrastructure targets, which has its value in a war.\n\nAn interesting and recent example is the suspicion that the AcidRain wiper was used in an\nattack against the Viasat KA-SAT satellite broadband service provider. The attacker gained\naccess to the management infrastructure of the provider to deploy AcidRain on KA-SAT\nmodems used in Ukraine. The attack also rendered 5,800 wind turbines inaccessible in\nGermany.\n\n## Interesting Properties\n\nAlthough the general objective of wiper malware is quite simple, some have interesting\nproperties worth discussing.\n\n### Fake Ransomware\n\nAs discussed, many wiper malware samples pretend to be ransomware. This means they\nleverage many of the typical Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) that actual\nransomware uses, but they do this without the possibility of recovering the files. In theory,\nstandard ransomware can also be used as a wiper if the decryption key is never provided to\nthe victim. In that case, the encrypted files are practically lost. However, after detailed\nanalysis, it is apparent in many cases that the ransomware functionality is just a ruse, and in\nreality, the malware is a wiper. There could be a couple of reasons to do this:\n\nAs seen previously with Ordinypt, a sample can follow the ransomware business model\nwithout the intention to recover files.\nIt can be used to mislead the incident response team and, with that, slow down\ncountermeasures.\n\n\n-----\n\nHide the motivation behind an attack. Ransomware would suggest cybercrime, which\ncould be a way to hide that the real motivation is sabotage or cyberwar.\n\nAn excellent example of the latter is the infamous NotPetya malware from 2017. It was the\nmost devastating malware so far. It started with a supply chain attack against Ukrainian\ncompanies through updates from a small Ukrainian accounting software company. However,\nit did not stop there. Since NotPetya was a worm, it also exploited vulnerabilities in other\nsoftware to propagate. This was so efficient that it quickly became a global problem, crippling\nnetworks without discrimination. It went to great lengths to imitate ransomware, such as\nencrypting files, providing a Bitcoin address for payment, and delivering a ransom note.\nHowever, in reality, it was a wiper that just destroyed data. It was attributed to the Sandworm\nactors, who are associated with the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed\nForces of the Russian Federation, often referred to as GRU.\n\n### Self-Propagation\n\nAs with NotPetya, we can see that a significant property of wipers is whether or not they are\nself-propagating. If it is a worm, such as NotPetya, it will self-propagate to other machines\nonce it is let loose. It is not necessarily possible to control them any longer in such a case.\n\nThere are a couple of ways malware can self-propagate:\n\nBy exploiting vulnerabilities in-network services.\nGathering credentials on infected machines and using them to connect to other\nmachines in the network.\nUsing legitimate ways to move from one device to another, such as update processes.\n\nThis does not mean, of course, that non-self-propagating malware cannot be devastating. If\nthe domain controller is compromised in a network, it can be used to deploy the wiper on all\nmachines in the organization. The main difference is that self-propagating malware cannot\nbe controlled once it has been unleashed.\n\n## Wiping Techniques\n\nNow let's roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty by looking under the hood of wiper\nmalware to understand the techniques they use to destroy the victim's data.\n\n### Overwriting Files\n\nThe most trivial approach for wipers is to simply enumerate the filesystem and overwrite the\nselected files with data. We discussed earlier that Ordinypt used this approach, overwriting\nfiles with zero (0x00) bytes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother good example is the WhisperGate wiper deployed against Ukrainian organizations\nearlier this year. It had various stages and components, but the second stage (stage2.exe)\ndownloaded the file corrupter component from a hardcoded Discord channel. This\ncomponent goes through specific folders looking for files with file extensions hardcoded in\nthe malware. These files are different data files. The malware replaces the content of the files\nwith 1 MB of 0xCC bytes and adds a 4-character long random extension. It is worth noting\nthat WhisperGate also pretended to be ransomware, even though it corrupts files beyond\nrepair.\n\n### Encrypting Files\n\nAs mentioned earlier, encrypting a file and destroying the key is essentially equivalent to\ndestroying the file. Of course, a brute-force attempt could be made to recover the file, but if\nproper encryption algorithms are used, this approach is quite hopeless. However, encryption\nrather than simply overwriting is very resource-intensive and slows down the malware. The\nonly use case for implementing encryption in a wiper is when the authors want to keep up\nthe appearance of being ransomware for as long as possible. This was the case with\nNotPetya, which did encrypt files properly.\n\n### Overwriting MBR\n\nMany wipers also make sure to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the disk. This\npart of a disk tells the computer how to boot the operating system. If the MBR is destroyed,\nthe computer won't start. However, this does not mean that the data on the hard disk has\nbeen destroyed. If only the MBR is corrupted, the data can still be recovered. By itself, it can\nonly be used to cause chaos and confusion, but no actual data loss. That is why it is usually\nused together with other techniques.\n\nFor instance, the ZeroCleare malware used against energy companies in the Middle East in\n2019 also used this technique. It used the third-party driver management tool EldoS\nRawDisk (more on that later) to directly access hard drives bypassing the protection\nmechanisms of the operating system (OS). Instead of overwriting files on the OS level,\nZeroCleare overwrites the disks directly with 0x55 bytes. This, of course, starts with the MBR\nand continues with all partitions. A very clever technique we should mention when talking\nabout ZeroCleare is that it bypassed the Windows Driver Signature Enforcement(DSG),\nwhich protects Windows from loading unsigned drivers (RawDisk driver). To do that, it first\nloaded a publicly available known vulnerable signed driver of VirtualBox. It then exploited the\nvulnerability in this legitimate driver to load RawDisk's unsigned driver. Once that happened,\nit had direct access to the disks in the machine.\n\n### Overwriting MFT\n\n\n-----\n\nMFT stands for Master File Table, and it exists on every NTFS filesystem. This is basically a\ncatalog of all the files that exist on the filesystem, their metadata, and either the file content\nor the location where the file content is stored. If the MFT is corrupted, the operating system\nwon't be able to find the files. This is a very easy and fast way for wiper malware to make\nfiles disappear. The one drawback is similar to corrupting the MBR: the file content is not\nnecessarily destroyed. While the few files stored directly in the MFT would be erased, most\nof the files are stored somewhere else on the disk, and the MFT only provides their location\nto the OS. Without the MFT, the OS won't be able to find the content, but the content is still\nthere on the disk.\n\nA fascinating example is NotPetya again. It overwrote the MBR of the target machine with a\ncustom boot loader and stored a custom low-level code that this boot loader called. This\ncode encrypted the MFT when the first restart happened after the infection. Once the MFT\nwas encrypted, it forced the machine to restart. After that second restart, the device would no\nlonger boot but only display the ransom note (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: NotPetya ransom note\n\n## Using IOCTL\n\nIOCTL is the device input and output control interface in Windows. The DeviceIoControl()\nfunction is a general-purpose interface used to send control codes to devices. The control\ncodes are essentially operations to be executed by the device driver. Malware uses this\ninterface to collect information about the disks targeted for the actual wiping.\n\nIn the case of HermeticWiper, IOCTLs were used for the following purposes:\n\nDrive fragmentation (as opposed to defragmentation): spreading files around the drive\nmakes a recovery more difficult. To achieve this, the\nFSCTL_GET_RETRIEVAL_POINTERS and FSCTL_GET_MOVE_FILES IOCTL codes\nare used.\nParsing the drive's contents to identify the parts to be destroyed: To do this, the\nIOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX and\nIOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY_EX codes are used.\nCollecting occupied clusters to stage them for erasing: This is a performance\nimprovement to ignore clusters not in use. For this, the\nFSCTL_GET_VOLUME_BITMAP and FSCTL_GET_VOLUME_BITMAP IOCTLs codes\nare used.\nAnd finally, the FSCTL_GET_NTFS_FILE_RECORD code is used to load a record from\nan NTFS filesystem.\n\nOnce HermeticWiper collects all the data it wants to erase to maximize the impact of the\nwiping, it uses the EaseUS Partition Master driver to overwrite the selected parts of the disk\nwith random data.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Third-party tooling\n\nIt was previously mentioned that malware sometimes uses third-party tools to overwrite data.\nThey usually use the Windows driver of off-the-shelf products to bypass the protection\nmechanisms of Windows and manipulate the disks directly. The primary reason for using\nthird-party drivers is probably that poorly implemented drivers can easily crash the whole\nsystem, which would lead to investigation and detection. Attackers likely don't want to invest\ntime into writing their own drivers. Another reason might be that only signed drivers are\nallowed to be loaded on modern Windows systems, so if they wrote their own driver, they\nwould need to bypass this security mechanism. This is, of course, not impossible, as we saw\nwith ZeroCleare, which first loads a signed but vulnerable driver and then exploits that\nvulnerability to load the unsigned driver.\n\nThe two most widely-used examples of third-party tools used are:\n\n[EldoS RawDisk, used by the Shamoon and ZeroCleare wipers and the Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0364/)\nin their infamous Sony Hack.\nEaseUS Partition Master used by HermeticWiper\n\n### All of the Above\n\nAs shown in the examples above, most wipers are not using just one technique but a\ncombination. Wipers employ varying complexity in trying to reach their goals. The more\ncomplex the malware is, the more techniques it needs to use. And, of course, the more\ntechniques are used, the lower the probability that the data can be recovered.\n\n## Fortinet Telemetry\n\nFigure 3 shows Fortinet Anti-Virus (AV) detection numbers since January 2022 of various\nwiper malware signatures. We can see that there was a significant increase. It is also\ninteresting to see that there is still a lot of NotPetya detection, which can be explained by the\nfact that it is a worm so as long as there are vulnerable machines out there NotPetya will\nkeep self-propagating. We can also see how the war specific new wipers appeared in March\nand increased the numbers significantly.\n\nFigure 3: AV detection for wiper samples since January\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThere are several best practices organizations are urged to implement to minimize the\nimpact of wiper malware:\n\n**Backup: The most helpful countermeasure for ransomware and wiper malware is to have**\nbackups available. Malware often actively searches for backups on the machine (such as\nWindows Shadow Copy) or on the network to destroy. Therefore, backups must be stored\n\n\n-----\n\noff-site and off-line to survive sophisticated attacks. And when we talk about backups, it is\nimportant to mention that the existence of backups is essential, but a detailed recovery\nprocess also exists. And that the IT team regularly exercises recovery from backup to\nminimize downtime.\n\n**Segmentation: Proper network segmentation can be useful on multiple levels. For example,**\nit can limit the impact of an attack to one segment of the network. In addition, firewalls used\n[in combination with anti-virus and intrusion prevention systems, such as FortiGate,](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall)\n[FortiGuard IPS, and](https://www.fortinet.com/products/ips) [FortiGuard Content Security, can detect the propagation of malware on](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-as-a-service/content-security)\nthe network, communications to known command and control servers, and malicious files as\nthey are moved through the network.\n\n**Disaster recovery plan: Once a wiper is deployed in the network, the question is how well**\nis the organization prepared for such a situation. What processes have been defined for\nbusiness continuity without IT? How will restoration from backups be done and how will the\norganization communicate the incident to customers and the media? These are all questions\nthat should be settled before an attack. All this and more should be defined in a disaster\nrecovery plan, which will be invaluable under the extreme stress of an active compromise.\n\n**Incident Response: The speed and the quality of incident response are crucial, and the**\noutcome of the attack can highly depend on it. In a scenario where a compromise is detected\nbefore wiper malware is deployed, the manner in which the incident response team handles\nand responds to the compromise could mean the difference between successfully averting\ndata loss and complete data destruction. The FortiGuard Incident Response & Readiness\nServices is a trusted partner of many organizations for just this purpose.\n\n## Fortinet Protection\n\nFortinet products detect all malware discussed in
