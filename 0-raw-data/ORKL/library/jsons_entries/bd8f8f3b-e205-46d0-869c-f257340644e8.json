As\nwe think about where the RaaS model may go in 2022, it is important to take a look\nbackwards at the history of RaaS through a traditional economic / innovation framework.\nAs we have often discussed, RaaS developers and affiliates have much more behavioral\nsimilarities to rational business operations than hardened criminals. Since RaaS operations\ntraverse the same economic forces that legitimate business or industry would face as it\n[matures, we can apply the Rogers Innovations Adoption Curve to think about where RaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)\ncame from, and where it may go next.\n\n## RaaS Innovators (2016-2018)\n\n\n-----\n\nInnovators to the RaaS model focused on lowering barriers to entry (attracting new affiliates\nto carry out lots of attacks), and creating efficiencies on monetization (i.e. getting paid more\noften and with less friction). The early RaaS developers would give their ‘kit’ away to new\naffiliates for free which greatly lowered the barriers to entry and made carrying out attacks\nmore streamlined for affiliates. The other key innovation was TOR sites, like the one used\nby Locky ransomware. In 2016, this was one of the first RaaS operations to employ an auto\ngenerated ransom note that directed victims to a simple TOR webpage. The page had\nsimple features, such as a test decryption portal and a “pay $300 in BTC here” button that\nprovided a bitcoin wallet address. The page was also configured to release the decryptor\nonce the ransom was paid to the correct wallet address. This automation allowed the RaaS\ndevelopers to greatly scale their operations. Once they established an affiliate base of\ndistributors, they could earn their proportion of ransom payments without needing to carry\nout attacks, or perform manual tasks.\n\nThis early version of RaaS was not without its issues though. One major complication was\nthe affiliates’ inability to assist with common decryption issues. Since affiliates only handled\nthe attack and payment elements of the operation, they rarely had the technical know-how\nto assess why files weren’t decrypting, or to determine what bug may be in the original\nmalware that could be causing flaws in the encrypted file format. This also created a brand\nissue for the RaaS platform itself, as the ones with the poorest performances would\neventually develop a bad reputation and lead a subset of victims to opt out of paying\nentirely.\n\nAnother issue was dishonesty among new recruits (i.e. the RaaS operator not having\nquality gates on who they allowed to use their ransomware kits). As the barrier to entry into\nthe ransomware market evaporated thanks to the ease and availability of RaaS, so entered\n\n\n-----\n\na new cohort of participants who did not care about the RaaS operations brand, let alone a\nvictim’s unrecoverable files. As we will see, this issue would be addressed further along the\ncurve.\n\n## RaaS Early Adopters (2018-2019)\n\nRaaS operators in the early adopter phase saw new applications and opportunities for\ninnovation. The GandCrab RaaS platform was one of the key operations to explore how\nRaaS could begin to impact larger companies, and leverage new attack vectors (like MSPs)\nin their operations. The personality of the GandCrab group was also very similar to the\ntraditional definition of NON-criminal technology Innovators. The traditional definition of\nearly adopters reads as being “eager to approach technological novelties but are more\n_cautious of new trends due to their role as change leaders, which they do not want to lose._\n_Early adopters are typically younger, have a higher social status, have more financial_\n_lucidity, advanced education, and are more socially forward than late adopters.” This_\ndefinition fits the personality of the original GandCrab operators that were much more brash\nwith their ego, vocalism, use of forums and social media. Other innovations that GandCrab\nintroduced:\n\n**Innovations in Extortion: Centralization of negotiations at the developer level via**\nTOR. This allowed many negotiations to be handled at the same time by the same\noperator. This also allowed the RaaS developers to enact quality standards to the\nnegotiations and track their own best practices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Innovations in Encryption: GandCrab developed an encryption scheme that allowed**\neach unique box to have its own encryption/decryption key. This enhanced their own\nsecurity, but also allowed them to splice and split which machines a victim needed to\ndecrypt. It also allowed for affiliates to innovate around more catastrophic distribution\n[methods, such as attacking an MSP in order to encrypt all of the MSP’s downstream](https://www.coveware.com/blog/managed-service-providers-attacked-by-ransomware)\nclients. This innovation also had its drawbacks, and producing all the unique keys was\nvery labor intensive for the RaaS developers. The GandCrab group would fix this\nissue when they moved to Sodinokibi ransomware and rebranded as REvil.\n\n**Innovations in ‘Customer Service’: Unlike the pioneers of the RaaS model,**\nGandCrab took a certain pride in making the decryption process as painless as\npossible for the victim. Not only did they remain on standby to provide detailed\ntroubleshooting assistance (including new builds of the tool, if needed), their mission\nstatement explained that in the unfortunate event a victim accidentally reinfected\nthemselves within 30 days of the original attack, the decryptor would be provided to\nthem again, no additional charge.\n\n## RaaS Early Majority (2019-2020)\n\nMaze was the first major RaaS operation to demonstrate the efficiency and practical\nbenefits of adding data theft as a requisite step in the extortion life cycle. Their tactics\ndismayed traditionalists as the stolen data had no actual value (i.e. it could not be\nmonetized by other cyber criminals easily, like credit card numbers or stolen identities).\nInstead, Maze found value in the increased payment conversion rates they experienced on\nmarginal attacks (that would have otherwise not paid any ransom but for the data theft\naspect) when they mixed in the threat to damage the victim's reputation by leaking\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation stolen during the attack. Unfortunately, this trend received a groundswell of\nsupport from security media outlets that were eager to drive traffic by acting as distribution\npublicists for the RaaS operations. Bloggers and journalists began eagerly squatting on\nthese leak sites, hoping to quickly amplify news of a new attack for their own benefit. This\nthrilled the community of RaaS operators, as now they had a publicity platform on which to\nback their threats. These Early majority RaaS operators also experimented with DDoS\nattacks against victims that were slow to negotiate. They would also enlist the help of\noutsourced call centers that would harass the employees or partners of victims that decided\nnot to pay.\n\n## Late Majority RaaS 2020 - Present\n\nFollowing the unprecedented actions of the Russian FSB to constript into service arrest a\nlarge number of REvil operators, the risk profile of being a RaaS operator has shifted. The\nmain takeaway from these arrests may be to cut a lower profile (i.e. don’t draw the IRE of\nthe [US government or other](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seized-23m-from-affiliate-of-revil-gandcrab-ransomware-gangs/) [governments that may take disruptive or even kinetic actions](https://cybernews.com/news/conti-apologizes-for-leaking-saudi-royalty-data-pledges-a-westward-focus/)\nagainst a group). The Conti group, while still quite brazen against US LEA, has tried to learn\nthe lessons from DarkSide (who was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline attack) and has\nconspicuously avoided inflaming certain governments and industries (outside of their own)\nin their attacks. LockBit 2.0 has also tried to seize on some of the missteps of REvil.\n\nLate majority RaaS operations are relinquishing control of the attack life cycle by allowing\naffiliates to handle the entire attack. They are also relinquishing more control over the\noutcome and, by extension, whether the attack actually results in revenue. It is up to the\n\n\n-----\n\naffiliate to ensure the attack is successful, that backups are compromised and that the\nencryption spreads far enough to inflict meaningful damage. If they fail, the victim is better\npositioned to restore from secure backups.\n\n## Further RaaS Innovation Trends to Watch\n\n**Ceding control to affiliates: Coveware’s data shows that only 22.6% of victims in 2020**\n**had viable backups, but in 2021, this margin has jumped to 42% of victims. This data**\npoint is surely influenced by multiple variables, but there has been a distinct drop in the\nnumber of cases where the threat actor was successful in rendering the backups useless.\nIn parallel, we note that the percentage of cases involving the threat to release data\ncontinues to climb. We may deduce from these trends that threat actors are relying less on\nthe operational disruption (harder from a technical perspective) of encrypted backups and\nmore on the threat of sensitive data leakage to intimidate victims into paying.\n\nRaaS operations like Conti and Lockbit 2.0 are ceding control over their ‘brand’ by allowing\nsloppy affiliates to carry out attacks without the victim’s profile being vetted. While RaaS\ngroups may SAY they don’t attack hospitals or charities, most of them still do.The\ncybersecurity community is acutely aware of which extortion groups generally stick to their\nword, and which groups are routinely problematic and unreliable. In Coveware’s YTD\nexamination of 2021 attacks, 78.3% of re-extortion events were attributed to RaaS\n**actors, which is an increase from 66.7% of re-extortion events in 2020. Re-extortion is a**\nparticularly nasty behavior wherein the bad actor signals to the victim that they agree to an\noffer, takes the money, and then informs the victim they need to pay another sum or they\nwill get nothing. This behavior is observed far less when dealing with non-RaaS\nransomware groups (such as closed RaaS or lone wolf groups).\n\nAnother equally damaging habit of RaaS affiliates is their propensity to prematurely leak\nvictim information before negotiations have completed and sometimes before they’ve even\nhad a chance to begin. Over 90% of premature data leaks observed in 2021 were\n**attributed to RaaS actors.More concerning still is that of these disclosures where the actor**\nresponsible was part of a RaaS organization, over 60% were from **[Closed RaaS groups,](https://www.coveware.com/blog/ransomware-marketplace-report-q4-2020)**\nwhich are historically more selective about who they allow in and - theoretically - should be\nmore experienced and professional. We infer from this trend that either the vetting process\nfor Closed RaaS recruiting has started to deteriorate and/or that contemporary ransomware\nactors do not place much value anymore on preserving their reputations as trustworthy\nhostage takers. Regardless, these increasingly volatile behavior patterns will have a direct\nand lasting impact on future victims’ inclination to pay or not pay.\n\nThere have been other small innovations that RaaS operators are testing. Last month,\n[security researchers reported that the FIN7 hack group was dipping their toes into the](https://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-ransomware-bastion-secure/)\nransomware business not by advertising to new affiliates, but by trying to recruit legitimate\nIT practitioners under the guise of recruiting them to provide commonplace penetration\n\n\n-----\n\n[testing services. As noted by Bleeping Computer,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacking-gang-creates-fake-firm-to-hire-pentesters-for-ransomware-attacks/) **By creating fake cybersecurity firms**\n**to conduct attacks, Gemini believes it is an attempt to hire cheap labor rather than**\n**partnering with affiliates who demand a much larger 70-80% share of any paid**\n**ransoms.”**\n\n**Innovations in Affiliate Deception: Not all innovation is for the good of the community. In**\n[September 2021, Yelisey Boguslavskiy of Advanced Intelligence reported that REvil](https://threatpost.com/how-revil-may-have-ripped-off-its-own-affiliates/174887/)\nleadership had planted a backdoor into victim TOR negotiation chats that would allow them\nto discreetly scam their own affiliates out of a payment without the affiliate realizing anything\nwas amiss. REvil affiliates were entitled to 70% of each ransom but with this magic trick, a\nREvil administrator could impersonate the victim and announce they were deciding not to\npay, while simultaneously setting up a secret mirrored chat with the real victim to finish the\ntransaction. News of this compelled the Lockbit 2.0 operations to advertise that THEIR\naffiliates could control 100% of the negotiation and payment, and only share proceeds on\ntheir own terms with the developers.\n\n**Balancing brand and LEA attention: The original draw of ransomware to cyber criminals**\nwas its inherent nature of being a low risk/high return enterprise. The explosion of\nransomware attacks over the past several years has been fueled by innovation to the RaaS\nmodel. While the profitability has soared, the risk profile has substantially increased given\nthe volume of LEA actions against RaaS groups and against infrastructure tools / tradecraft\nused by these groups. All high profile seizures and shutdowns of ransomware gangs in\n2021 and 2022 were RaaS affiliate-based groups as opposed to non-affiliate based groups.\n\n\n-----",
