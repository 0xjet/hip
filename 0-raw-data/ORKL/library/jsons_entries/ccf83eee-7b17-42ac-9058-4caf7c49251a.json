GozNym infected tens of thousands of victim computers worldwide, primarily in\nthe United States and Europe. The operation was highlighted by the unprecedented\ninitiation of criminal prosecutions against members of the network in four different countries\nas a result of cooperation between the United States, Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Germany,\nBulgaria, Europol and Eurojust.\n\nUnited States Attorney Scott W. Brady of the Western District of Pennsylvania made the\nannouncement at Europol, located in The Hague, Netherlands, along with his international\npartners.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operation was conducted by the United States Attorney s Office for the Western District\nof Pennsylvania and the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, along with the Office of the Prosecutor\nGeneral of Georgia, Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, Office of the Prosecutor General\nof the Republic of Moldova, Public Prosecutor’s Office Verden (Germany), the Supreme\nProsecutor’s Office of Cassation of the Republic of Bulgaria, Ministry of Internal Affairs of\nGeorgia, National Police of Ukraine, General Police Inspectorate of the Republic of Moldova,\nthe Luneburg Police of Germany and the Republic of Bulgaria’s General Directorate for\nCombatting Organized Crime with the significant assistance of Europol and Eurojust.\n\n“International law enforcement has recognized that the only way to truly disrupt and defeat\ntransnational, anonymized networks is to do so in partnership,” said U.S. Attorney Brady.\n“The collaborative and simultaneous prosecution of the members of the GozNym criminal\nconspiracy in four countries represents a paradigm shift in how we investigate and prosecute\ncybercrime. Cybercrime victimizes people all over the world. This prosecution represents an\ninternational cooperative effort to bring cybercriminals to justice.”\n\nEarlier today, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania unsealed an\nIndictment returned by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh charging 10 members of the\nGozNym criminal network with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit\nwire fraud and bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. An eleventh\nmember of the conspiracy was previously charged in a related Indictment. The victims of\nthese crimes were primarily U.S. businesses and their financial institutions, including a\nnumber of victims located in the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\n“This takedown highlights the importance of collaborating with our international law\nenforcement partners against this evolution of organized cybercrime,” said FBI Pittsburgh\nSpecial Agent in Charge Robert Jones. “Successful investigation and prosecution is only\npossible by sharing intelligence, credit and responsibility. Our adversaries know that we\nare weakest along the seams and this case is a fantastic example of what we can\naccomplish collectively.\"\n\nAccording to the Indictment, the defendants conspired to:\n\ninfect victims’ computers with GozNym malware designed to capture victims’ online\nbanking login credentials;\nuse the captured login credentials to fraudulently gain unauthorized access to victims’\nonline bank accounts; and,\nsteal money from victims’ bank accounts and launder those funds using U.S. and\nforeign beneficiary bank accounts controlled by the defendants.\n\nThe defendants reside in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria. The operation\nwas an unprecedented international effort to share evidence and initiate criminal\nprosecutions against members of the same criminal network in multiple countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the request of the United States, Krasimir Nikolov, aka pablopicasso, salvadordali, and\n“karlo,” of Varna, Bulgaria, was searched and arrested by Bulgarian authorities and\nextradited to the United States in December 2016 to face prosecution in the Western District\nof Pennsylvania. Nikolov’s primary role in the conspiracy was that of a “casher” or “account\ntakeover specialist” who used victims’ stolen online banking credentials captured by GozNym\nmalware to access victims’ online bank accounts and attempt to steal victims’ money through\nelectronic funds transfers into bank accounts controlled by fellow conspirators. Nikolov is\nnamed as a GozNym conspirator in the newly unsealed indictment, although he is charged in\na related Indictment filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania. Nikolov entered a guilty\nplea in federal court in Pittsburgh on charges relating to his participation in the GozNym\nconspiracy on April 10, 2019. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 30, 2019.\n\nFive of the named defendants reside in Russia and remain fugitives from justice. However,\nto overcome the inability to extradite the remaining defendants to the United States for\nprosecution, an unprecedented effort was undertaken to share evidence and build\nprosecutions against defendants in the remaining countries where they reside, including\nGeorgia, Ukraine and Moldova. The prosecutions are based on shared evidence acquired\nthrough coordinated searches for evidence in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria, as\nwell as from evidence shared by the United States and Germany from their respective\ninvestigations.\n\nThe GozNym network exemplified the concept of “cybercrime as a service.” According to the\nIndictment, the defendants advertised their specialized technical skills and services on\nunderground, Russian-language, online criminal forums. The GozNym network was formed\nwhen these individuals were recruited from the online forums and came together to use their\nspecialized technical skills and services in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nAccording to the Indictment, Alexander Konovolov, aka “NoNe,” and “none_1,” age 35, of\nTbilisi, Georgia, was the primary organizer and leader of the GozNym network who\ncontrolled more than 41,000 victim computers infected with GozNym malware. Konovolov\nassembled the team of cybercriminals charged in the Indictment, in part by recruiting them\nthrough the underground online criminal forums. Marat Kazandjian, aka “phant0m,” age 31,\nof Kazakhstan and Tbilisi, Georgia, was allegedly Konovolov’s primary assistant and\ntechnical administrator. Konovolov and Kazandjian are being prosecuted in Georgia for their\nrespective roles in the GozNym criminal network.\n\nGennady Kapkanov, aka “Hennadiy Kapkanov,” “flux,” “ffhost,” “firestarter,” and “User 41,”\nage 36, of Poltava, Ukraine, was an administrator of a bulletproof hosting service known by\n[law enforcement and computer security researchers as the “Avalanche” network. This](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation)\nnetwork provided services to more than 200 cybercriminals, including Konovolov and\nKazandjian, and it hosted more than 20 different malware campaigns, including GozNym.\nKapkanov’s apartment in Poltava, Ukraine was searched in November 2016 during a\nGerman-led operation to dismantle the network’s servers and other infrastructure. Kapkanov\nwas arrested for shooting an assault rifle through the door of his apartment at Ukrainian law\n\n\n-----\n\nenforcement officers conducting the search. Through the coordinated efforts being\nannounced today, Kapkanov is now facing prosecution in Ukraine for his role in providing\nbulletproof hosting services to the GozNym criminal network.\n\nAlexander Van Hoof, aka “al666,” age 45, of Nikolaev, Ukraine, was a “cash-out” or “drop\nmaster” who provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts he\ncontrolled that were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims’ online bank\naccounts.\n\nEduard Malanici, aka “JekaProf,” and “procryptgroup, age 32, of Balti, Moldova, provided\ncrypting services to cybercriminals. Malanici crypted GozNym malware in furtherance of the\nconspiracy to enable the malware to avoid detection by anti-virus tools and protective\nsoftware on victims’ computers. Malanici, along with two associates, is being prosecuted in\nMoldova.\n\nVictims of the GozNym malware attacks include:\n\nAn asphalt and paving business located in New Castle, Pennsylvania;\nA law firm located in Washington, DC;\nA church located in Southlake, Texas;\nAn association dedicated to providing recreation programs and other services to\npersons with disabilities located in Downers Grove, Illinois;\nA distributor of neurosurgical and medical equipment headquartered in Freiburg,\nGermany, with a U.S. subsidiary in Cape Coral, Florida;\nA furniture business located in Chula Vista, California;\nA provider of electrical safety devices located in Cumberland, Rhode Island;\nA contracting business located in Warren, Michigan;\nA casino located in Gulfport, Mississippi;\nA stud farm located in Midway, Kentucky; and\nA law office located in Wellesley, Massachusetts;\n\nFive Russian nationals charged in the Indictment who remain fugitives from justice include:\n\nVladimir Gorin, aka “Voland,” “mrv,” and “riddler,” of Orenburg, Russia. Gorin was a\nmalware developer who oversaw the creation, development, management, and leasing of\nGozNym malware, including to Alexander Konovolov.\n\nKonstantin Volchkov, aka “elvi,” age 28, of Moscow, Russia, provided spamming services to\ncybercriminals. Volchkov conducted spamming operations of GozNym malware on behalf of\nthe conspiracy. The spamming operations involved the mass distribution of GozNym\nmalware through “phishing” emails. The phishing emails were designed to appear legitimate\nto entice the victim recipients into opening the emails and clicking on a malicious link or\nattachment, which facilitated the downloading of GozNym onto the victims’ computers.\n\n\n-----\n\nRuslan Katirkin, aka stratos, and xen, age 31, of Kazan, Russia, resided in Khmelnytskyi,\nUkraine, during the time frame of the charged conspiracy. Katirkin, like Krasimir Nikolov, was\na “casher” or “account takeover specialist” who used victims’ stolen online banking\ncredentials captured by GozNym malware to access victims’ online bank accounts and\nattempt to steal victims’ money through electronic funds transfers into bank accounts\ncontrolled by fellow conspirators.\n\nViktor Vladimirovich Eremenko, aka “nfcorpi,” age 30, of Stavropol, Russia, and Farkhad\nRauf Ogly Manokhin, aka “frusa,” of Volgograd, Russia, were “cash-outs” or “drop masters”\non behalf of the GozNym criminal network. Like Alexander Van Hoof, Eremenko and\nManokhin provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts they\ncontrolled that were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims’ online bank\naccounts. Manokhin was arrested at the request of the United States while visiting Sri Lanka\nin February 2017. Following his arrest, Manokhin was released on bail but was required to\nremain in Sri Lanka pending the outcome of his extradition proceedings to the United States.\nIn December 2017, Manokhin unlawfully absconded from Sri Lanka and successfully fled\nback to Russia prior to the conclusion of the extradition proceedings.\n\nOther agencies and organizations partnering in this effort include the United States Secret\nService, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) in Pittsburgh and the\nShadowserver Foundation. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided\nsignificant assistance throughout the investigation and spearheaded the efforts to enable the\nUnited States to request searches, arrests, and extraditions in the foreign countries as well\nas the sharing of evidence with those countries through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty\nrequests.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles A. “Tod” Eberle, Chief of\nNational Security and Cybercrime for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\nUpdated May 16, 2019\n\n\n-----",
