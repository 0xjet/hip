    "plain_text": "# Here's how to guard your enterprise against ShinyHunters\n\n**intel471.com/blog/shinyhunters-data-breach-mitre-attack**\n\nIf your organization’s data is suddenly sharing screen time with an electric blue deer, it's time\nto worry.\n\nAug 23, 2021\n\nThere is a group in the cybercriminal underground that is trying to collect troves of\nenterprise data the same way that millions of gamers collect Pokémon.\n\nSince surfacing in April 2020, the group — which refers to itself as ShinyHunters — has been\nbehind some of the most notable data breaches that have been made public. Those include\n[breaches of Microsoft’s GitHub account,](https://threatpost.com/report-microsofts-github-account-gets-hacked/155587/) [photo editing app Pixlr, and](https://siliconangle.com/2021/01/20/shinyhunters-publishes-1-9m-stolen-user-credentials-photo-editing-site-pixlr/) men’s clothing retailer\nBonobos. Intel 471 has also observed them claiming responsibility for several other breaches,\nincluding incidents impacting a sports media company, a mobile travel platform, and a\nwebsite that allows musical artists to find and book gigs. As research was being conducted for\nthis blog, the group claimed to be in possession of 70 million records with personally\nidentifiable information that it took from telecom giant AT&T.\n\nWith figures estimating the average data breach this year is approximately $4.4 million, we\ncan estimate that ShinyHunters has cost companies tens of millions of dollars in damages\nthis year.\n\nPrimarily operating on Raid Forums, the collective’s moniker and motivation can partly be\n[derived from their avatar on social media and other forums: a shiny Umbreon Pokémon. As](https://twitter.com/sh_corp)\nPokémon players hunt and collect “shiny” characters in the game, ShinyHunters collects and\nresells user data.\n\nWhile the group’s targets are spread across different economic sectors, the methods by which\nthey are obtaining organizational data follow a consistent pattern. ShinyHunters tries to\nobtain legitimate credentials, most likely for a company's cloud services. From there, the\n[group will seek to target database infrastructure to gather PII to be resold on marketplaces](https://intel471.com/glossary/pii)\nfor profit. Intel 471 has also observed ShinyHunters targeting DevOps personnel or GitHub\nrepository companies in order to steal valid OAuth credentials. These OAuth keys are used to\naccess cloud infrastructure and bypass any two-factor authentication processes that are in\nplace.\n\nBelow is a further breakdown of the courses of action (CoAs) the actor could take based on\nTTPs identified, including the most likely courses of action (MLCoA) and the most dangerous\ncourses of action (MDCoA) that organizations could anticipate. More MITRE ATT&CK\n\n\n-----\n\nmapping can be found at the end of this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIntel 471 has also observed the group follow TTPs in the MDCoA column, but then leverage\nthe credentials in secondary or tertiary attacks. Additionally, the group will also search a\ncompany's GitHub repository source code for vulnerabilities within the code itself. These\nvulnerabilities are used in further, more complex, third-party or supply chain attacks.\n\nShinyHunters may not have as much notoriety as the ransomware groups that are currently\ncausing havoc for enterprises all over the world. However, tracking actors like this are crucial\nto preventing your enterprise from being hit with such an attack. The information\nShinyHunters gathers is often turned around and sold on the same underground\nmarketplaces where ransomware actors use it to launch their own attacks. If enterprises can\nmove to detect activity like ShinyHunters, they in turn can stop ransomware attacks before\nthey are ever launched.\n\n**APPENDIX:**\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK Techniques**\n\n**[Reconnaissance [TA0043]](https://intel471.com/glossary/reconnaissance)**\n\n[Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials [T1589.001] - Sold unauthorized](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/001/)\naccess credentials containing PII.\n\n[Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses [T1589.002] - Sold unauthorized](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/002/)\naccess credentials containing PII.\n\n[Phishing for Information [T1598].
