If you’re wondering whether\nthe actor behind the malware is still developing new features, the answer is yes. Later in\nNovember 2019 our Attribution Engine revealed a new Trojan with strong code similarities.\nFurther research showed that it was obviously using the same code base as COMPFun.\n\n## What’s of interest inside\n\nThe campaign operators retained their focus on diplomatic entities, this time in Europe, and\nspread the initial dropper as a spoofed visa application. It is not clear to us exactly how the\nmalicious code is being delivered to a target. The legitimate application was kept encrypted inside\nthe dropper, along with the 32- and 64-bit next stage malware.\n\n**_Overall infection chain. Interestingly, C2 commands are rare HTTP status codes_**\n\nWe observed an interesting C2 communication protocol utilizing rare HTTP/HTTPS status codes\n(check IETF RFC 7231, 6585, 4918). Several HTTP status codes (422-429) from the Client Error\nclass let the Trojan know what the operators want to do. After the control server sends the status\n“Payment Required” (402), all these previously received commands are executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe authors keep the RSA public key and unique HTTP ETag in encrypted configuration data.\nCreated for web content caching reasons, this marker could also be used to filter unwanted\nrequests to the C2, e.g., those that are from network scanners rather than targets. Besides the\naforementioned RSA public key to communicate with the C2, the malware also uses a selfgenerated AES-128 key.\n\n## Who is the author?\n\nWe should mention here once again that the COMPfun malware was initially documented by GDATA in 2014; and although the company did not identify which APT was using the malware.\n[Based mostly on victimology, we were able to associate it with the Turla APT with medium-to-low](https://securelist.com/all/?tag=718)\nlevel of confidence.\n\n## What the Trojan is able to do\n\nIts functions include the ability to acquire the target’s geolocation, gathering host- and networkrelated data, keylogging and screenshots. In other words, it’s a normal full-fledged Trojan that is\nalso capable of propagating itself to removable devices.\n\nAs in previous malware from the same authors, all the necessary function addresses resolve\ndynamically to complicate analysis. To exfiltrate the target’s data to the C2 over HTTP/HTTPS,\nthe malware uses RSA encryption. To hide data locally, the Trojan implements LZNT1\ncompression and one-byte XOR encryption.\n\n#### Encrypted data Algorithm Key source\n\n Exfiltrated keystrokes, screenshots, etc. RSA Public key from config‐ uration data\n\n\n#### Configuration data in .rsrc section XOR (plus LZN‐ T1 compression)\n\n\n#### Hardcoded one-byte key\n\n Generated by Trojan and shared in beacon\n\n\n#### Parameters inside the HTTP GET/POST requests\n\n Commands and arguments from C2 for HTTP status 427 (dir, upl, usb, net)\n\n\n#### AES-128 (plus ETag from config)\n\n\n#### AES-128 Generated by Trojan and shared in beacon\n\n\n_Encryption and compression used by the Trojan for various tasks_\n\n### Initial dropper\n\nThe first stage dropper was downloaded from the LAN shared directory. The file name related to\nthe visa application process perfectly corresponds with the targeted diplomatic entities. As with all\nmodules with a similar code base, the dropper begins by dynamically resolving all the required\nWindows API function addresses and puts them into structures. It then decrypts the next stage\nmalware from its resource (.rsrc) section. The algorithm used to decrypt the next stage is a onebyte XOR using the key “0x55”, followed by LZNT1 decompression.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following files are dropped to the disk in addition to the original application that the malware\ntries to mimic:\n\n#### MD5 hash File name Features\n\n\n#### 1BB03CBAD293CA9EE3DD‐ CE6F054FC325\n\n A6AFA05CB‐ D04E9AF256D278E5B5AD050\n\n\n#### ieframe.dll.mui 64-bit Trojan version\n\n\n#### ExplorerFrame.dll.‐ mui\n\n\n#### 32-bit Trojan version\n\n\nThe dropper urges users to run the file as administrator (using messages such as “need to run as\nadmin”), then drops a version corresponding to the host’s architecture and sets the file system\ntimestamp to 2013.12.20 22:31.\n\nInterestingly, the dropper’s abilities aren’t limited to PE lures; as an alternative, this stage is also\nable to use .doc and .pdf files. In such cases, the dropper will open the files using the “open” shell\ncommand instead of running the legitimate spoofed executable application.\n\n### Main module – HTTP status-based Trojan\n\n#### SHA256 710b0fafe5fd7b3d817cf5c22002e46e2a22470cf3894e‐ b619f805d43759b5a3\n\n MD5 a6afa05cbd04e9af256d278e5b5ad050\n\n Compiled 2015.06.26 09:42:27 (GMT)\n\n Type I386 Windows GUI DLL\n\n Size 593408\n\n\n#### Internal name\n\n\n#### ExplorerFrame.dll.mui\n\n\nThe analysis below is based on the 32-bit sample from the table above. The legitimate\nExplorerFrame.dll.mui is a language resource for the ExplorerFrame.dll file used by Windows\nExplorer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Multi-threaded Trojan features such as monitoring USB devices to spread further and_**\n**_receiving commands as HTTP status codes_**\n\n### Initialization\n\nAs usual in this malware family’s code, a huge number of short standalone functions return all the\nreadable strings. This is done to complicate analysis by not allowing the strings to be visible at a\nglance for researchers. The module’s preparation stage dynamically resolves all required\nWindows API function addresses into corresponding custom structures. Afterwards the malware\nuses indirect function calls only.\n\nThe module obtains the processor architecture (32- or 64-bit) and Windows OS version. It\nincludes a number of anti-analysis checks for virtual machine-related devices (VEN_VMWARE,\nVBOX_HARDDISK, Virtual_DVD_ROM, etc.) to avoid controlled execution. It also notes which\nsecurity products are running on the host (Symantec, Kaspersky, Dr.Web, Avast).\n\nBefore every communication with the C2, the malware checks if software such as debuggers\n(WinDbg, OllyDbg, Visual Studio) and host (Process Explorer or Monitor, etc.) or network\nmonitoring (Wireshark, TCPView, etc.) programs are running. It also checks for internet\nconnectivity and does not attempt to communicate if the checks fail.\n\nThe DLL also checks for potentially available launch processes that it can inject itself into. In the\ncase of PaymentRequired, this could be system, security product or browser processes. Then the\nmalware forms the corresponding code to drop files, delete files, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe last step in the initialization procedure is to decrypt and decompress the configuration file.\nDecryption is done via a one-byte XOR using the 0xAA key, followed by decompression using the\nLZNT1 algorithm. From the configuration, the malware parses the RSA public key, ETag and IP\naddresses to communicate with its control servers.\n\n**_Decrypted configuration data contains an RSA public key to encrypt exfiltrated data, C2_**\n**_IPs and unique ETag to communicate with them_**\n\n### HTTP status-based communication module\n\nFirstly, the module generates the following:\n\nAES-128 encryption key used in HTTP GET/POST parameters and HTTP status code 427\n(request new command);\n4-byte unique hardware ID (HWID) based on the host network adapters, CPU and first fixed\nlogical drive serial number.\n\nThe module then chooses a process to inject the code into, in order of decreasing priority, starting\nfrom Windows (cmd.exe, smss.exe), security-related applications (Symantec’s nis.exe, Dr.Web’s\nspideragent.exe) and browsers (IE, Opera, Firefox, Yandex browser, Chrome).\n\nThe main thread checks if the C2 supports TLS in its configuration. If it does, communication will\nbe over HTTPS and port 443; otherwise, the HTTP protocol and port 80 are used.\n\n#### Config Parameter Value\n\n Encryption key RSA public key on the image above\n\n ETag C8E9CEAD2E084F58A94AEDC14D423E1A\n\n\n-----\n\n#### C2 IPs 95.183.49[.]10 95.183.49[.]29 200.63.45[.]35\n\n_Decrypted configuration content inside the analyzed sample_\n\nThe first GET request sent contains an ETag “If-Match” header that is built using data from its\ndecrypted configuration. ETags are normally used by web servers for caching purposes in order\nto be more efficient and save bandwidth by not resending redundant information if an ETag value\nmatches. The implementation of ETags means the C2 may ignore all requests that are not sent\nfrom its intended targets if they don’t have the required ETag value.\n\n\n#### HTTP status\n\n\n#### RFC status meaning\n\n\n#### Corresponding command functionality\n\n\n#### 200 OK Send collected target data to C2 with current tickcount\n\n\n#### 402 Payment Required\n\n 422 Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV)\n\n 423 Locked (WebDAV)\n\n 424 Failed Dependen‐ cy (WebDAV)\n\n 427 Undefined HTTP status\n\n 428 Precondition Required\n\n 429 Too Many Requests\n\n\n#### This status is the signal to process received (and stored in binary flag) HTTP statuses as commands\n\n Uninstall. Delete COM-hijacking persistence and corre‐ sponding files on disk\n\n Install. Create COM-hijacking persistence and drop corre‐ sponding files to disk\n\n Fingerprint target. Send host, network and geolocation data\n\n Get new command into IEA94E3.tmp file in %TEMP%, decrypt and execute appended command\n\n Propagate self to USB devices on target\n\n Enumerate network resources on target\n\n\n_C2 HTTP status code descriptions, including installation, USB propagation, fingerprinting, etc._\n\nHTTP 427 can receive any of the following appended commands:\n\n\n#### Com‐ mand\n\n\n#### Command functionality\n\n\n#### dir Send directory content to C2 encrypted with RSA public key from config\n\n upl Send file to C2 encrypted with RSA public key from config\n\n usb Not implemented yet. Possibly same function planned as for HTTP status 428\n\n\n-----\n\n#### net Not implemented yet. Possibly same function planned as for HTTP status 429\n\n### Removable device propagation module\n\nIf initialization is successful, the malware starts one more thread for dispatching Windows\nmessages, looking for removable devices related to a WM_DEVICECHANGE event. The module\nruns its own handlers in the event of a USB device being plugged into or unplugged from the\nhost.\n\n### Other spying modules: keylogger, screenshot tool and more\n\nThe user’s activity is monitored using several hooks. All of them gather the target’s data\nindependently of any C2 command. Keystrokes are encrypted using the RSA public key stored in\nthe configuration data and sent once every two seconds, or when moreа than 512 bytes are\nrecorded. These 512 characters also include left mouse button clicks (written as the “MSLBTN”\nstring) and Windows title bar texts. For clipboard content, the module calculates an MD5 hash\nand if it changes, encrypts the clipboard content with the same RSA public key and then sends it.\n\nIn a separate thread, the Trojan takes a bitmap screenshot using the GDIPlus library, compresses\nit with the LZNT1 algorithm, encrypts it using the key from the configuration data and sends it to\nthe control server. A screenshot will be taken of the target and sent anyway, independently of any\nC2 command.\n\n### Last but not least\n\nThere are several choices – albeit not major additional technical ones – that the malware author\nmade which we consider to be noteworthy.\n\nThe COM-hijacking-based persistence method injects its corresponding code and structure as a\nparameter into a legitimate process’s memory. The malware geolocates victims using legitimate\nweb services: geoplugin.net/json.gp, ip-api.com/json and telize.com/geoip.\n\nThe unusual thread synchronization timeout calculation in the HTTP status thread is peculiar.\nMathematically, the partial sum of the series is precisely:\n\nThis series, in the case of a full sum, is just a\nrepresentation of the exponent. The developers\nprobably used the exponent to make timeouts in the\ncommunication thread more unpredictable and grow at\na fast rate, and the compiler calculated it this way.\n\n## So what did the COMPFun authors achieve?\n\n\n-----\n\nWe saw innovative approaches from the COMpfun developers twice in 2019. First, they bypassed\n[TLS encrypted traffic via PRNG system function patching, and then we observed a unique](https://securelist.com/compfun-successor-reductor/93633/)\nimplementation of C2 communications using uncommon HTTP status codes.\n\nThe malware operators retained their focus on diplomatic entities and the choice of a visa-related\napplication – stored on a directory shared within the local network – as the initial infection vector\nworked in their favor. The combination of a tailored approach to their targets and the ability to\ngenerate and execute their ideas certainly makes the developers behind COMPFun a strong\noffensive team.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**File MD5 Hashes**\n[Trojan 32-bit: A6AFA05CBD04E9AF256D278E5B5AD050](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/A6AFA05CBD04E9AF256D278E5B5AD050/)\n[Trojan 64-bit: 1BB03CBAD293CA9EE3DDCE6F054FC325](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/1BB03CBAD293CA9EE3DDCE6F054FC325/)\n\n**IPs**\n[95.183.49.10](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/95.183.49.10/)\n[95.183.49.29](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/95.183.49.29/)\n[200.63.45.35](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/200.63.45.35/)\n\n\n-----",
