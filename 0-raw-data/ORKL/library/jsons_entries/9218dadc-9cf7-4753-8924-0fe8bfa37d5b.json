At first glance, it seems to be just another one of the regular\nbotnets, but we soon realized this is something with potential link to the Lazarus Group.\n\nAt present, the industry has never disclosed the Lazarus Group's attack samples and cases\nagainst the Linux platform. And our analysis shows that this is a fully functional, covert and RAT\nprogram targeting both Windows and Linux platforms, and the samples share some key\ncharacters being used by Lazarus Group.\n\n### The links between Lazarus Group and Dacls RAT\n\nFirst, we searched VT for the hardcoded string c_2910.cls and k_3872.cls in the sample\nand found 5 more samples. We can confirm from their sample and C2 instruction codes that they\nare the same RAT family, and is suitable for Windows and Linux platforms, respectively.\n\nOne of the 5 samples 6de65fc57a4428ad7e262e980a7f6cc7 was pointed to as Lazarus Group\nby the user Raeezabdulla of the VirusTotal community, and cited a report \"CES Themed Targeting\nfrom Lazarus\". This sample also has download address of\n\n[https://thevagabondsatchel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wm64.avi . In October](https://thevagabondsatchel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wm64.avi)\n2019, a sample named NukeSped was tagged by Twitter user @cyberwar_15 as Lazarus Group.\nAnd that sample file b578ccf307d55d3267f98349e20ecff1 has the download url as\n\n[http://thevagabondsatchel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/public.avi](http://thevagabondsatchel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/public.avi)\n\nA quick google returns many Lazarus Group analysis reports and some open source threat\n[intelligence data, many pointing out that thevagabondsatchel.com was used by Lazarus Group to](http://thevagabondsatchel.com/)\nstore samples.\n\nTherefore, we speculate that the attacker behind Dacls RAT is Lazarus Group.\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently this sample is shown on VirusTotal with 26 pretty generic malware tag from by 26\nantivirus vendors with no relevant analysis report. Therefore, we think it is necessary to disclose\nsome of its technical detail here.\n\nWe name it Dacls (Win32.Dacls and Linux.Dacls) based on its file name and hard-coded strings.\n\n## Dacls overview\n\nDacls is a new type of remote-control software targeting both Windows and Linux environment. Its\nfunctions are modular, the C2 protocol uses TLS and RC4 double-layer encryption, the\nconfiguration file uses AES encryption and supports C2 instruction dynamic update. The\nWin32.Dacls plug-in module is dynamically loaded through a remote URL, and the Linux version\nof the plug-in is compiled directly in the Bot program.\n\n### Downloader server\n\nWe found a series of samples on a suspected download server http://www.areac\nagr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/, including Win32.Dacls, Linux.Dacls, the open\nsource program Socat, and working payload for Confluence CVE-2019-3396. We speculated that\nthe Lazarus Group used the CVE-2019-3396 N-day vulnerability to spread the Dacls Bot\nprogram.\n\nMD5 (check.vm) = a99b7ef095f44cf35453465c64f0c70c //Confluence CVE-2019-3396 Payload\nMD5 (hdata.dat) = 982bf527b9fe16205fea606d1beed7fa //Log Collector\nMD5 (ldata.dat) = 80c0efb9e129f7f9b05a783df6959812 //Linux Dacls Bot\nMD5 (mdata.dat) = 80c0efb9e129f7f9b05a783df6959812 //Linux Dacls Bot\nMD5 (r.vm) = a99b7ef095f44cf35453465c64f0c70c   //Confluence CVE-2019-3396 Payload\nMD5 (rdata.dat) = bea49839390e4f1eb3cb38d0fcaf897e //Windows Dacls Bot\nMD5 (sdata.dat) = e883bf5fd22eb6237eb84d80bbcf2ac9 //Open-Source Socat\n\n## Reverse analysis\n\n### Log Collector sample\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5: 982bf527b9fe16205fea606d1beed7fa\n\n##### ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, no section\n\n header\n\nThe function of this sample is simple. It collects the target host information by specifying the\nparameters of the log collecting process. It avoids scanning some specified root and secondary\ndirectories, and write the retrieved file path to /tmp/hdv.log .\n\nAvoid Scanning Root Directory\n/bin\n/boot\n/dev\n/etc\n/lib\n/lib32\n/lib64\n/lost+found\n/sbin\n/sys\n/tmp\n/proc\n/run\n\nAvoid Scanning Secondary Directory\n/usr/bin\n/usr/etc\n/usr/games\n/usr/include\n/usr/lib\n/usr/lib32\n/usr/lib64\n/usr/libexec\n/usr/sbin\n/usr/share\n/usr/src\n/usr/tmp\n/var/adm\n/var/cache\n/var/crash\n/var/db\n/var/empty\n/var/games\n/var/gopher\n/var/kerberos\n/var/lock\n/var/nis\n/var/preserve\n/var/run\n/var/yp\n\nSample logging format\n\n\n-----\n\ndeep  name   type  size  last date\n0    /     D    0    000000000000\n1    bin    D    0    201911290628\n2    bash   F    1037528 201907121226\n2    bunzip2  F    31352  201907040536\n2    busybox  F    1984584 201903070712\n2    bzcat   F    31352  201907040536\n2    bzcmp   F    2140  201907040536\n....\n\nWhen all the work is done, it executes the system tar command to compress the log file tar \ncvzf /tmp/hdv.rm /tmp/hdv.log and upload it to the specified log collecting interface.\n\n### Linux.Dacls sample\n\nMD5: 80c0efb9e129f7f9b05a783df6959812\n\n##### ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for\n\n GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=e14724498374cb9b80a77b7bfeb1d1bd342ee139,\n\n stripped\n\nThe main functions of Linux.Dacls Bot include: command execution, file management, process\nmanagement, test network access, C2 connection agent, network scanning module.\n\n#### Initialization\n\nAfter Linux.Dacls Bot is started, it runs in the daemon mode in the background, and uses the\nstartup parameters /pro, the Bot PID file, /var/run/init.pid and the Bot process name\n\n/proc/<pid>/cmdline to distinguish different operating environments. We suspect that it may\nbe used for Bot program upgrades.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Configuration file .memcahce\n\nThe Linux.Dacls Bot configuration file is stored at $HOME/.memcache, and the file content is\n0x8E20 + 4 bytes. If Bot cannot find the configuration file after startup, it will use AES encryption\nto generate the default configuration file based on the hard-coded information in the sample. After\nsuccessful Bot communicates with C2, the configuration file will get updated.\n\n##### Data structure\n\nWe define the data structure information of the configuration file as struct_global_cfg, which\nstores the Bot operating parameters, C2 information, and plug-in information.\n\n\n-----\n\nstruct struct_plugin_cfg_data\n{\nint plugin_id;\nint plugin_type;\nint unk3;\nchar name[1040];\n};\n\nstruct struct_c2_content\n{\nchar content[2048];\n};\n\nstruct struct_global_cfg\n{\nint session_id;\nint unk_const1;\nint sus_version_20190417;\nint connect_retry_sleep_time;\nchar unk_array1[88];\nint c2_num;\nstruct_c2_content c2_list[3];\nchar unknown_filed_186C[14340];\nstruct_plugin_cfg_data plug_cfg_data_list[15];\n};\n\n##### AES encryption algorithm\n\nAES，CBC Mode\nKey：A0 D2 89 29 27 78 75 F6 AA 78 C7 98 39 A0 05 ED\nIV：39 18 82 62 33 EA 18 BB 18 30 78 97 A9 E1 8A 92\n\n##### Decrypting the configuration file\n\nAfter decrypting the configuration file, we can see some plain text information in it, for example:\nsession ID, version information, reconnection time for C2, C2 information, etc. After successfully\nconnecting to C2, the configuration file will be updated according to received C2 instructions,\nsuch as adding new plugin information supported by the Bot, updated C2 information, etc.\n\n#### C2 protocol\n\n\n-----\n\nLinux.Dacls Bot and C2 communication is mainly divided into three stages, and uses TLS and\nRC4 double-layer encryption algorithms to ensure data communication security. The first phase is\nto establish a TLS connection, the second phase is to establish agreement for authentication\nprocess (Malware Beaconing), and the third phase is to send RC4 encrypted data by Bot.\n\n##### SSL connection\n\n Phase 2\n\nSeveral Beacon messages and C2 confirm each other's identity are exchanged here.\n\n##### Cmd Direction Encrypted Description\n\n 0x20000 send no Beacon\n\n 0x20100 recv no Beacon\n\n 0x20200 send no Beacon\n\n RC4 encryption and decryption process\n\nRC4 Key generation algorithm, generated by random function, Key length range: greater\nthan 0 and less than 50\n\n\n-----\n\nReplacement table generation algorithm, generate replacement table for RC4 encryption\nbased on RC4 Key\n\nEncryption / decryption algorithm, complete encryption / decryption according to the\nreplacement table generation algorithm. Because RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm,\nthe encryption / decryption algorithm is consistent\n\n\n-----\n\nRC4 decryption example\nAfter completing the protocol authentication, Bot sends the RC4 Key length (the first 4\nbytes) and RC4 Key data to C2.\n\nC2 receives the encryption key and sends the ciphertext to Bot. After decryption, the command is\n0x00000700. After that, Bot will upload the hostname-related information to C2.\n\nKey:\na3 2f c2 10 f3 92 79 c3 0e f6 e4 e5 2e 69 29 86\n0d 3a 92 f5 b7 23 fc 91 d9 46 91 55 a3 86 5a 47\n36 1d 58 2a af d1 6d 3d 49 52 23 77 bc 4d fd 49\n87\n\nCiphertext:\nfe 3c 2c d7 bf 08 e3 91 d7 00 1f d0\n\nPlaintext:\n00 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n##### C2 instruction code table\n\nThe instructions accepted by Linux.Dacls Bot are a total of 12 bytes, but the actual effective size\nis 4 bytes, and it is divided into two control modes.\n\nThe first mode: when the third byte is 0, this is to control the Bot main logic.\n\nThe following is an example of the network sequence data packet corresponding to the\n0x00000700 instruction: the mode is 0x00, and the instruction 2 is 0x07 to control Bot to upload\nhost name information\n\n\n-----\n\n##### INSTRUCTION 1 INSTRUCTION 2 MODE UNKNOWN\n\n 00 07 00 00\n\nThe second mode: when the third byte is 1, the plug-in logic is called.\n\nThe following is an example of the network sequence data packet corresponding to the\n0x00010101 instruction: the mode is 0x01, and the instruction 1 is 0x01.\n\n##### INSTRUCTION 1 INSTRUCTION 2 MODE UNKNOWN\n\n 01 01 01 00\n\nAfter receiving the instruction, Bot returns 0x20500 on successful execution and 0x20600 on\nfailure.\n\nC2 instruction list for the Bot main logic part\n\n\n##### MOD‐ ULE CMD\n\n\n##### EN‐ CRYPT Description\n\n\n##### Core 0x00000601 Yes Upload C2 configuration information\n\n Core 0x00000602 Yes Download configuration information to\n\n$HOME/.memcache\n\n##### Core 0x00000700 Yes Ask Bot to upload host information\n\n Core 0x00000900 Yes Ask Bot to send heartbeat information\n\nC2 instruction list for the Bot plugin logic\n\n\n##### MODULE CMD\n\n\n##### EN‐ CRYPT Description\n\n\n##### /bin/bash 0x00010000 Yes Execute the bash command issued by C2\n\n /bin/bash 0x00010002 Yes Connect to the specified C2 and execute the issued system command\n\n plugin_file 0x00010100 Yes Write file\n\n plugin_file 0x00010101 Yes Read file\n\n plugin_file 0x00010103 Yes Delete Files\n\n plugin_file 0x00010104 Yes Scanning the directory structure\n\n plugin_file 0x00010110 Yes Download file from specified url\n\n\n##### plugin_pro‐ cess\n\n\n##### 0x00010200 Yes Scan and upload information about the host process\n\n\n-----\n\n##### MODULE CMD\n\n\n##### EN‐ CRYPT Description\n\n\n##### plugin_pro‐ cess\n\n plugin_pro‐ cess\n\n plugin_pro‐ cess\n\n\n##### 0x00010201 Yes Kill specified process\n\n 0x00010202 Yes Create a daemon process\n\n 0x00010204 Yes Obtain and report process PID and PPID\n\n\n##### plugin_test 0x00010300 Yes Test whether the specified IP can be reached\n\n\n##### plugin_re‐ verse_p2p\n\n\n##### 0x00010400 Yes C2 Connection proxy\n\n\n##### logsend 0x00011100 Yes Test if the Log server can be accessed\n\n logsend 0x00011101 Yes Upload public network port scan results and command execution output\n\n logsend 0x00011102 Yes No operation\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 communication flowchart\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### Plug-in module\n\nLinux.Dacls Bot uses static compilation to compile the plug-in and Bot code together. By sending\ndifferent instructions to call different plug-ins, various tasks can be completed. The sample we\nanalyzed contains a total of 6 plugins, because the configuration information of the plugin is a\ncontinuous array of structures (0x00 ~ 0x0e). We guess that Bot may have other more plugins.\n\nEach plug-in has its own corresponding configuration, which is saved in the bot’s configuration file\n\n$HOME/.memcache . When the plug-in is initialized, the configuration information will be loaded.\n\n##### Bash plugin\n\nThe Bash plug-in is plug-in number 0, it mainly supports two functions: receiving and executing\nsystem commands issued by the C2 server; C2 issues temporary new C2, bot then connects to\nthe temporary C2 and executes system commands issued by the temporary C2.\n\n##### File plugin\n\nThe main function of the File plugin is file management. In addition to supporting read, write,\ndelete, and find operations on files, bot can also download files from a designated download\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Process plugin\n\nThe main function is process management, including: killing a specified process, creating a\ndaemon process, obtaining the PID and PPID of the current process, and obtaining process list\ninformation.\n\nIf the /proc/<pid>/task directory corresponding to the PID in the Linux process exists, the Bot\nsample will collect the following process information:\n\n/proc/<pid>/cmdline Read full name from command line\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom /proc/<pid>/status reading:\n\nName   //process name\nUid    //user ID\nGid    //group ID\nPPid   //parent ID\n\n##### Test plugin\n\nThe main function is to test network connectivity by connecting the IP address and port specified\nby C2.\n\n##### Reverse P2P plugin\n\nThe Reverse P2P plug-in is actually a C2 Connection Proxy, it\ndirects network traffic between bots and C2 to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. This\nis a common used technique by the Lazarus Group. With connection proxy, the number of target\nhost connections can be reduced, and the communication between the target and the real C2 can\nbe hidden. In some cases, an infected intranet host can be used to further penetrates into the\nisolated network segment.\n\nreverse_p2p plugin initialization\n\nWhen Bot receives a command, it first attempts to connect to the specified C2 port to send a\n0x21000. If C2 returns 0x21300, the C2 connection is successful and the Bot will connect to the\ntarget IP:port. If it works, it will return 0x21100 to C2, indicating that the forwarding connection has\nbeen established and can start forwarding data. Now, Bot can forward the data sent by C2 to the\ntarget, and at the same time return the data returned by the target to C2, until either party\ninterrupts the connection\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is the working flowchart of the Reverse P2P plugin:\n\n##### LogSend plugin\n\nThe LogSend plug-in mainly includes three functions: test the connection to the Log server,\nrandomly scan the entire network's 8291 port and report to the Log server, execute system\ncommands that take a long time and report the console output to the Log server in real time.\n\nLogSend plugin initialization\n\n\n-----\n\nLogSend related operation callback function\n\nAfter testing the connection to the Log server, the\nBot will send a test request to the Log server. If the Log server returns {\"result\":\"ok\"},\nindicating that the test was successful, C2 can issue more LogSend instructions.\n\nSending the POST request using the HTTP interface address specified by C2 and the built-in\nUser-Agent\n\nPOST /%s HTTP/1.0\nHost: %s\nContent-Length: 9\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/65.0.3325.181 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: close\nlog=check\n\nRandomly scan port 8291 on the entire network and report the result to the Log server.\n\nAfter receiving the instruction, Bot will randomly generate a public IP address according to 3 builtin rules and try to connect to their port 8291. If the connection is successful, the scan result will be\nreturned to the log server.\n\nIP generation rules:\n\nip = <part1>.<part2>.<part3>.<part4>\n\nrule1: part1 != 127\nrule2: part1 == 172 and (part2 <= 15 or part2 > 31)\nrule3: part1 != 192 and part2 != 168\nrule4: part1 != 10\n\nThe random IP generation algorithm is as follows\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see that Bot hard-codes the TCP / 8291 port and calls the system connect function to\nperform port scan. It only checks whether the port is open and does not send payload data. We\nare not sure why TCP 8291 is targeted, but we know that the Winbox protocol of the MikroTik\nRouter device works on TCP / 8291 port and is exposed on the Internet. Previously we also\n[disclosed 2 articles about the TCP / 8291 port threat incident [1][2].](https://blog.netlab.360.com/7500-mikrotik-routers-are-forwarding-owners-traffic-to-the-attackers-how-is-yours-en/)\n\n\n-----\n\nExecute bash command which takes a long time to finish and report the console output to the Log\nserver in real time.\n\n\n-----\n\nExecute the bash command and forward the output to the Log server.\nAll reported Log data is submitted by HTTP POST. The format of the payload section is as\nfollows:\n\n\nlog=save&session_id=<session id>&value=<log content>\n\n\n-----\n\n### Suggestions\n\nWe recommend that Confluence users patch their system in a timely manner and check whether\nthey have been infected based on the process name, file name, and TCP network connection\nused by Dacls RAT.\n\nWe recommend that readers monitor and block Dacls RAT-related IPs, URLs and domain names.\n\n### Contact us\n\n[Readers are always welcomed to reach us on twitter, WeChat 360Netlab or email to netlab at](https://twitter.com/360Netlab)\n360 dot cn.\n\n#### IoC list\n\nSample MD5\n\n6de65fc57a4428ad7e262e980a7f6cc7\n80c0efb9e129f7f9b05a783df6959812\n982bf527b9fe16205fea606d1beed7fa\n8910bdaaa6d3d40e9f60523d3a34f914\na99b7ef095f44cf35453465c64f0c70c\nbea49839390e4f1eb3cb38d0fcaf897e\ncef99063e85af8b065de0ffa9d26cb03\ne883bf5fd22eb6237eb84d80bbcf2ac9\n\nHard-coded C2 IP：\n\n\n-----\n\n23.81.246.179 United States ASN19148 Leaseweb USA,\nInc.\n23.254.119.12 Canada ASN55286 B2 Net Solutions\nInc.\n23.227.196.116 United States ASN35017 Swiftway Sp. z\no.o.\n37.72.175.179 United States ASN29802 HIVELOCITY, Inc.\n23.227.199.53 United States ASN35017 Swiftway Sp. z\no.o.\n107.172.197.175 United States ASN36352 ColoCrossing\n172.93.201.219 United States ASN20278 Nexeon\nTechnologies, Inc.\n64.188.19.117 United States ASN8100 QuadraNet\nEnterprises LLC\n74.121.190.121 United States ASN23033 [Wowrack.com](http://wowrack.com/)\n192.210.213.178 United States ASN36352 ColoCrossing\n209.90.234.34 United States ASN23033 [Wowrack.com](http://wowrack.com/)\n198.180.198.6 United States ASN26658 HT\n\nURL\n\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/check.vm](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/check.vm)\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hdata.dat](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hdata.dat)\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ldata.dat](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ldata.dat)\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mdata.dat](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mdata.dat)\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/r.vm](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/r.vm)\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rdata.dat](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rdata.dat)\n[http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sdata.dat](http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sdata.dat)\n\n\n-----",
