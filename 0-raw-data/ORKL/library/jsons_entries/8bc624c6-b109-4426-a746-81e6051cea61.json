Further analysis has\nshown that a single component within the inspected firmware’s image was modified by attackers in a way that\nallowed them to intercept the original execution flow of the machine’s boot sequence and introduce a\nsophisticated infection chain.\n\nBy examining the components of the rogue firmware and other malicious artefacts from the target’s network, we\nwere able to reach the following conclusions:\n\nThe inspected UEFI firmware was tampered with to embed a malicious code that we dub MoonBounce;\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to its emplacement on SPI flash which is located on the motherboard instead of the hard disk, the\nimplant is capable of persisting in the system across disk formatting or replacement;\nThe purpose of the implant is to facilitate the deployment of user-mode malware that stages execution of\nfurther payloads downloaded from the internet;\nThe infection chain itself does not leave any traces on the hard drive, as its components operate in\nmemory only, thus facilitating a fileless attack with a small footprint;\nWe detected other non-UEFI implants in the targeted network that communicated with the same\ninfrastructure which hosted the the stager’s payload;\nBy assessing the combination of the above findings with network infrastructure fingerprints and other TTPs\nexhibited by the the attackers; to the best of our knowledge the intrusion set in question can be attributed\nto [APT41, a threat actor that’s been widely reported to be Chinese-speaking;](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-moonlighters-idUSKCN1UX1JE)\n\nIn this report we describe in detail how the MoonBounce implant works, how it is connected to APT41, and what\nother traces of activity related to Chinese-speaking actors we were able to observe in the compromised network\nthat could indicate a connection to this threat actor and the underlying campaign.\n\n## Revisiting the current state of the art in persistent attacks\n\nIn the last year, there have been several public accounts on the ongoing trend of UEFI threats. Notable\n[examples include the UEFI bootkit used as part of the FinSpy surveillance toolset that we reported on, the work](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)\n[of our colleagues from ESET on the ESPectre bootkit, and a little-known threat activity that was discovered](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/10/05/uefi-threats-moving-esp-introducing-especter-bootkit/)\nwithin government organisations in the Middle East, using a UEFI bootkit of its own (briefly mentioned in our\n[APT trends report Q3 2021 and covered in more detail in a private APT report delivered to customers of our](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2021/104708/)\nThreat Intelligence Portal).\n\nThe common denominator of those three cases is the fact that the UEFI components targeted for infection reside\non the ESP (EFI System Partition), a storage space designated for some UEFI components, typically based in\nthe computer’s hard drive or SSD. The most notable elements of the ESP are the Boot Manager and OS loader,\nboth invoked during the machine’s boot sequence and which also happen to be the subject of tampering in the\ncase of the aforementioned bootkits.\n\nWhile all of the above were seen in use by advanced actors, a different class of bootkits raises even higher\nconcern. This one is made up of implants found in the UEFI firmware within the SPI flash, a non-volatile storage\nexternal to the hard drive. Such bootkits are not only stealthier (partially because of limited visibility by security\nproducts into this hardware component), but also more difficult to mitigate: flashing a clean firmware image in\nplace of a malicious one can prove to be more difficult than formatting a hard drive and reinstalling an OS, which\nwould typically eliminate ESP level threats.\n\nMoonBounce is notable for being the third publicly revealed case of an implant from the latter class of firmware[based rootkits. Previous cases included LoJax and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/) [MosaicRegressor, which we reported on during October](https://securelist.com/mosaicregressor/98849/)\n2020. In that sense, MoonBounce marks a particular evolution in this group of threats by presenting a more\ncomplicated attack flow in comparison to its predecessors and a higher level of technical competence by its\nauthors, who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the finer details involved in the UEFI boot process.\n\n## Our discovery: a sophisticated implant within UEFI firmware\n\nThe UEFI implant, which was detected in spring 2021, was found to have been incorporated by the attackers\ninto the CORE_DXE component of the firmware (also known as the DXE Foundation), which is called early on at\nthe DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase of the UEFI boot sequence. Among other things, this component\nis responsible for initializing essential data structures and function interfaces, one of which is the EFI Boot\nServices Table – a set of pointers to routines that are part of the CORE_DXE image itself and are callable by\nother DXE drivers in the boot chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe source of the infection starts with a set of hooks that intercept the execution of several functions in the EFI\nBoot Services Table, namely AllocatePool, CreateEventEx and ExitBootServices. Those hooks are used to divert\nthe flow of these functions to malicious shellcode that is appended by the attackers to the CORE_DXE image,\nwhich in turn sets up additional hooks in subsequent components of the boot chain, namely the Windows loader.\n\nThis multistage chain of hooks facilitates the propagation of malicious code from the CORE_DXE image to other\nboot components during system startup, allowing the introduction of a malicious driver to the memory address\nspace of the Windows kernel. This driver, which runs during the initial phases of the kernel’s execution, is in\ncharge of deploying user-mode malware by injecting it into an svchost.exe process, once the operating system is\nup and running. Finally, the user mode malware reaches out to a hardcoded C&C URL (i.e.\nhxxp://mb.glbaitech[.]com/mboard.dll) and attempts to fetch another stage of the payload to run in memory,\nwhich we were not able to retrieve.\n\nThe diagram below contains the outline of the stages taken from the moment the hooked Boot Services are\ncalled in the context of the DXE Foundation’s execution until the user-mode malware is deployed and run during\nthe Operating System’s execution. The full description of each step in the diagram, along with the analysis of\n[both the MoonBounce driver and user-mode malware can be found in the technical document released](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/01/19115831/MoonBounce_technical-details_eng.pdf)\nalongside this report.\n\n**_Flow of MoonBounce execution from boot sequence to malware deployment in user space_**\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that at the time of writing we lack sufficient evidence to retrace how the UEFI firmware was infected in the\nfirst place. The infection itself, however, is assumed to have occurred remotely. While previous UEFI firmware\ncompromises (i.e. LoJax and MosaicRegressor) manifested as additions of DXE drivers to the overall firmware\nimage on the SPI flash, the current case exhibits a much more subtle and stealthy technique where an existing\nfirmware component is modified to alter its behaviour. Notably, particular functions were modified with an inline\nhook, meaning the replacement of the function prologue with an instruction to divert execution to a function\nchosen by the attacker. This form of binary instrumentation typically requires the attacker to obtain the original\nimage, then parse and change it to introduce malicious logic. This would be possible for an attacker having\nongoing and remote access to the targeted machine.\n\n## Other pieces of malware on the radar\n\nIn addition to MoonBounce, we found infections across multiple nodes in the same network by a known usermode malware dubbed ScrambleCross, also known as SideWalk. This is an in-memory implant, implemented as\nposition-independent code, that can communicate to a C2 server in order to exchange information and stage the\nexecution of additional plugins in memory, of which none has been sighted in the wild yet. This malware was\n[thoroughly covered by our colleagues at Trend Micro and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/earth-baku-returns?utm_source=trendmicroresearch&utm_medium=smk&utm_campaign=0821_EarthBaku1) [ESET, so we will refer the reader to their excellent](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nwrite-ups to understand its internals better.\n\nThe position-independent code constituting ScrambleCross can be loaded in one of two ways, the first being a\nC++ DLL named StealthVector. It obtains the ScrambleCross shellcode by applying a modified ChaCha20\nalgorithm on an encrypted blob, which may reside as an additional file on disk or be embedded in the loader\nitself. We detected both variants of this loader in the network in question.\n\nStealthVector gets loaded through the introduction of a modified benign system DLL, in which the import address\ntable is patched to append the malware’s DLL as a dependency. In one case, we observed such altered\nwbemcomn.dll (MD5: C3B153347AED27435A18E789D8B67E0A) file, which originally facilitates the functionality\nof WMI in Windows and was located in the directory %SYSTEM%\\wbem. As a consequence, when the WMI\nservice was initiated, the rogue version of this DLL forced the loading of a StealthVector image named\nwmiwk.dll.\n\n**_Appended IAT entry to a rogue wbemcomn.dll file which forces the loading of StealthVector upon_**\n**_initiation of the WMI service_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe table below specifies all instances of StealthVector that we detected in the targeted network, along with\ntimestamp artefacts that might point to the date of their creation.\n\n\n**Loader**\n**Filename**\n\n\n**Loader MD5** **Shellcode**\n**Filename**\n\n\n**C&C Address** **Compilation**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\nwbwkem.dll 4D5EB9F6F501B4F6EDF981A3C6C4D6FA compwm.bin dev.kinopoisksu[.]com Friday,\n12.06.2020\n08:25:02\nUTC\n\nwkbem.dll E7155C355C90DC113476DDCF765B187D pcomnl.bin Unknown Tuesday,\n24.03.2020\n09:09:21\nUTC\n\nwmiwk.dll 899608DE6B59C63B4AE219C3C13502F5 wmipl.dll ns.glbaitech[.]com Saturday,\n20.02.2021\n06:45:18\nUTC\n\nc_20344.nls 4EF90CEEF2CC9FF3121B34A9891BB28D – 217.69.10[.]104 Tuesday,\n24.03.2020\n09:09:21\nUTC\n\nc_20334.nls CFF2772C44F6F86661AB0A4FFBF86833 – st.kinopoisksu[.]com Tuesday,\n24.03.2020\n09:09:21\nUTC\n\nAnother loader that we detected and is commonly used to load ScrambleCross is .NET based, referred to as\nStealthMutant. It works by decrypting a shellcode BLOB with AES-256 and injecting it to the address space of\nanother process. The injected process in every case we observed was msdt.exe (Microsoft Diagnostic\nTroubleshooting Wizard).\n\nStealthMutant is launched in one of two ways, which were partially described in other reports as well. The first\nway is by executing a launcher utility with the filename System.Mail.Service.dll (MD5:\n5F9020983A61446A77AF1976247C443D) through the command line as a service. This is outlined in the\nfollowing commands typed by the attackers on one of the compromised systems:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\nnet start \"iscsiwmi\"\n\nsc stop iscsiwmi\n\nsc delete iscsiwmi\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost\" /v \"iscsiwmi\" /t\nREG_MULTI_SZ /d \"iscsiwmi\" /f\n\nsc create \"iscsiwmi\" binPath= \"$system32\\svchost.exe -k iscsiwmi\" type= share start= auto error= ignore\nDisplayName= \"iscsiwmi\"\n\nSC failure \"iscsiwmi\" reset= 86400 actions= restart/60000/restart/60000/restart/60000\n\nsc description \"iscsiwmi\" \"\"iSCSI WMI Classes That Manage Initiators, Ports, Sessions and\nConnections\"\"\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\iscsiwmi\\Parameters\" /f\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\iscsiwmi\\Parameters\" /v \"ServiceDll\" /t\nREG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"$windir\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\System.Mail.Service.dll\" /f\n\nnet start \"iscsiwmi\"\n\n\nThe launching utility in turn uses the .NET InstallUtil.exe application in order to execute the StealthMutant image,\nwhich has the filename Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets, and providing it with the encrypted ScrambleCross\nshellcode as an argument from a file named MstUtil.exe.config. The utility itself is a basic C++ program that\nachieves the aforementioned goal by issuing the following command line using the WinExec API:\n\n1 C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false\n/ConfigFile=MstUtil.exe.config /U\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\n\nThe second way to execute StealthMutant is through the creation of a scheduled task via a Windows batch script\nfile named schtask.bat, as outlined below:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n@echo off\n\ncd /d \"%~dp0\"\n\ncopy /Y Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\n\"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\"\n\ncopy /Y MstUtil.exe.config \"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\MstUtil.exe.config\"\n\nschtasks /create /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UNP\\UNPRefreshListTask\" /SC ONSTART /TR\n\"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false\n/ConfigFile=MstUtil.exe.config /U\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\" /F /DELAY\n0000:02 /RU SYSTEM /RL HIGHEST\n\nschtasks /run /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UNP\\UNPRefreshListTask\"\n\n\nThe following table lists known StealthMutant loader IOCs, together with their corresponding ScrambleCross\nshellcode files and contacted C2 addresses. It’s worth noting that most of the ScrambleCross shellcodes (loaded\nby both StealthMutant and StealthVector) reached out to the same server (i.e. ns.glbaitech[.]com) and that\nStealthMutant was observed in this campaign only from February, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Loader MD5** **C&C Address** **Compilation Timestamp**\n\n0603C8AAECBDC523CBD3495E93AFB20C 92.38.178[.]246 Tuesday, 23.03.2021 08:00:44 UTC\n\nns.glbaitech[.]com\n\n8C7598061D1E8741B8389A80BFD8B8F5 ns.glbaitech[.]com Saturday, 20.02.2021 03:27:42 UTC\n\nF9F9D6FB3CB94B1CDF9E437141B59E16 ns.glbaitech[.]com Wednesday, 08.12.2021 07:07:28 UTC\n\nIn addition to the above components, we found other stagers and post-exploitation malware implants during our\nresearch, some of which were attributed to or have been used by known Chinese-speaking threat actors:\n\n**[Microcin: a backdoor typically used by the SixLittleMonkeys threat actor, which we have been tracking](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07170759/Microcin_Technical_4PDF_eng_final_s.pdf)**\nsince 2016. It is worth noting that since its inception, the SixLittleMonkeys group has been using Microcin\nagainst various targets, partly against high-profile entities based in Russia and Central Asia.\nThe implants we observed in this campaign are shipped as DLLs that ought to run in the context of exe,\nwith the primary intent of reading a C2 address from an encrypted configuration file stored in\n%WINDIR%\\debug\\netlogon.cfg and reaching out to the server to obtain a further payload. Interestingly,\nthe Trojan holds a scheduling algorithm that would skip any work on Saturdays, checking the local time\nevery hour to determine if Saturday has passed.\n**Mimikat_ssp: a publicly** [available post-exploitation tool used to dump credentials and security secrets from](https://github.com/jas502n/mimikat_ssp)\n[exe, also used widely by various Chinese-speaking actors (e.g. GhostEmperor, which we reported on).](https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/)\n**Go implant: a formerly unknown backdoor used to contact a C2 server using a RESTful API, where a**\ncombination of a hardcoded IP address and a hypermedia directory path on the underlying server are used\nfor information exchange. Both the IP and the server directory path are encrypted with AES-128 using a\nbase64 encoded key stored in the backdoor’s image. The IP and directory path tuple are used during\nexecution for:\n\nInitialising communications with the server;\nSending information from the infected host;\nRequesting a specific server path containing a command for execution and downloading it;\nSending back the result of the command’s execution to the C2 server.\nThe commands retrieved from the server are also encrypted with AES-128, with the key stored in the\ncommand’s file itself. Command execution results are then encrypted using the same key. We found the\nfollowing list of supported commands:\n\nGet list of drives;\nGet content list from a specified directory;\nDownload a file from the C2 server;\nWrite text to a given *.bat file and execute it;\nRun a shell command.\n\nIt is important to note that we could not conclusively tie most of those additional pieces of malware to the\nintrusion set related to MoonBounce, with the exception of Microcin, where some timeline artefacts coincide with\nother events related to ScrambleCross, as outlined in the figure below. This suggests a low-confidence\nconnection between Microcin and MoonBounce and may indicate usage of shared resources between\nSixLittleMonkeys and APT41 or involvement of the former’s operators in the MoonBounce activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Timeline of events related to artefacts found in the network containing the MoonBounce-infected_**\n**_machine_**\n\n## Who were the targets?\n\nCurrently, our detections indicate a very targeted nature of the attack – the presence of the firmware rootkit was\ndetected in a single case. Other affiliated malicious samples (e.g. ScrambleCross and its loaders) were found on\nmultiple other machines in the same network range. In addition, we found several other victims of an\nundetermined nature with the same versions of ScrambleCross reaching out to the same command and control\ninfrastructure. One particular target corresponds to an organization in control of several enterprises dealing with\ntransport technology.\n\n## What were the attackers trying to achieve?\n\nWe traced some of the commands executed by the attackers after gaining a foothold in the network, which point\nto lateral movement and exfiltration of information from particular machines. This aligns in profile with some of\nthe previous operations by APT41, wherein intrusions were typically made to intervene in the targeted\ncompanies’ supply chain, or to heist sensitive intellectual property and personally identifiable information. The\nusage of the UEFI implant in particular indicates the actor’s aim to establish a longstanding foothold within the\nnetwork, as would be expected in an ongoing espionage activity.\n\nThe following are examples of command lines that portray some of the methods and actions taken by the\noperators of this threat activity to achieve their goals:\n\n\n-----\n\nAttempts to enumerate hosts and gather network information:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & whoami\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net view\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & -setcp 866\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net view\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & netstat -ano\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\ /od\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & arp -a\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & tasklist\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & tracert <redacted_internal_ip>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net use \\\\<redacted_internal_ip> /u:<redacted_username>\n<redacted_password>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net view \\\\<redacted_internal_ip>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & ping -n 1 -a <redacted_internal_ip>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net use * /d /y\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & systeminfo\"\n\n\nCopying of files across SMB shares, followed by an attempt to dump the Active Directory domain database\n(tid):\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & echo ntdsutil \\\"ac i ntds\\\" \\\"ifm\\\" \\\"create full $temp\\1\\\\\\\" q q >$temp\\a.bat\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & type $temp\\a.bat\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & move $temp\\a.bat \\\\<redacted_internal_ip>\\c$\\windows\\temp\\\\\n\n\nUsage of the Sysinternals Psexec tool for remote command execution in the network (as the renamed\nversion tmp):\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n$temp\\TS_P61S.tmp -accepteula -d -s \\\\<redacted_internal_ip1>\\ cmd /c \"arp -a\n>$temp\\TS_P34H.tmp\"\n\n$temp\\TS_P61S.tmp -accepteula -d -s \\\\<redacted_internal_ip2>\\ cmd /c \"ping\n<redacted_internal_ip2> -a -n 2>$temp\\TS_P34H.tmp\"\n\n$temp\\TS_P61S.tmp -accepteula -d -s \\\\<redacted_internal_ip3>\\ cmd /c \"ping -n 2 -a\n<redacted_internal_ip2>>$temp\\TS_P34H.tmp\"\n\n\n-----\n\nUsage of WMI for remote command execution:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip1> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c ping -n 1 -a <redacted_internal_ip4>\n>$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip2> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c netstat -ano >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip2> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c tracert <redacted_internal_ip4>>$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c ipconfig /all >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c qwinsta >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c net user administrator >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c net user admin >$temp\\a.tmp\n\n\nRemoval of artefacts from the system:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\ /od\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\*.hive\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & del $temp\\*.hive\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\*.log\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & type $temp\\silconfig.log\"\n\n\nFile archiving of remotely collected files, some of which contain *.hive files, possibly for LSA secrets\ndumping, with the exe command line utility:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & $temp\\rar.exe a -r wef.rar \\\\<redacted_internal_ip1>\\c$\\windows\\temp\\1 hp2wsxcde34rfv7788.\"\n\nc:\\windows\\temp\\rar.exe a -r c:\\windows\\temp\\873.rar \\\\\n<redacted_internal_ip2>\\c$\\windows\\temp\\*.hive -hp5tgbnhy67ujm3256\n\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nThe main cluster of infrastructure serving the activity of the UEFI implant and ScrambleCross implants is outlined\nin the table below. Note that the attackers maintained the infrastructure from at least March 2020, with some\nservers seemingly still active at the end of 2021 . During the time the actor switched between multiple hosting\nproviders, resulting in a scattered infrastructure across several ASNs.\n\n**Domain** **IP** **ASN**\n\nmb.glbaitech[.]com 188.166.61[.]146 AS14061 – DIGITALOCEAN-ASN\n\n\n-----\n\nns.glbaitech[.]com 188.166.61[.]146 AS14061 – DIGITALOCEAN-ASN\n\n172.107.231[.]236 AS40676\n\ndev.kinopoisksu[.]com 172.107.231[.]236 AS40676\n\n193.29.57[.]161 AS48314 – IP-PROJECTS\n\nst.kinopoisksu[.]com 136.244.100[.]127 AS20473 – AS-CHOOPA\n\n– 217.69.10[.]104 AS20473 – AS-CHOOPA\n\n– 92.38.178[.]246 AS202422 – GHOST\n\nA careful inspection of the infrastructure shows multiple connections between the servers. It is evident that\nMoonBounce’s user-mode stager and a few ScrambleCross instances reached out to a single domain, which\nresolved to the same IP at one point. In addition, there were several overlaps in IPs to which the domains\nresolved as outlined in the figure below, including one IP that was used to park two domains at different points in\ntime.\n\n**_Connections between infrastructure elements of MoonBounce and ScrambleCross implants found on_**\n**_the same network_**\n\nAnother important commonality is a unique self-signed SSL certificate, exhibited by multiple servers in this\ncampaign (and only a few dozen others in the wild), which represents a noteworthy fingerprint of the attacker’s\nnetwork activity.\n\nIn addition to the above cluster, we detected two servers related to Microcin’s activity on the same network:\n\n**Domain** **IP** **ASN**\n\nm.necemarket[.]com 172.105.94[.]67 AS63949 – LINODE\n\nholdmem.dbhubspi[.]com 5.188.93[.]132 AS202422 – G-Core Labs\n\n\n-----\n\n## Who is behind the MoonBounce attack?\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the activity described in this report can be attributed to a group widely known as\nAPT41, or an actor closely affiliated to it, with medium to high confidence. In part, our findings align with multiple\n[public accounts from the previous year of either APT41 or other threat actors, namely Earth Baku and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/earth-baku-returns?utm_source=trendmicroresearch&utm_medium=smk&utm_campaign=0821_EarthBaku1)\n[SparklingGoblin, which are believed to be alternative names for APT41 or share significant resources and TTPs](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nwith it.\n\nOur conclusion, in particular, is done based on the following factors:\n\nThe loading schemes for ScrambleCross, including the usage of StealthVector and StealthMutant in the\ninfection chain, are identical to those observed leveraged by Earth Baku and SparklingGoblin. Apart from\nthe loaders themselves, their launchers seem identical. The attackers used the unique TTP of initiating the\nloader execution through exe in all cases observed by us. Particularly Install.bat, as used by Earth Baku\nand described in the public report by Trend Micro mentioned earlier, is highly similar to the sequence of\ncommands used to execute the InstallUtil launcher in our case.\nThe ScrambleCross malware itself, which has been reported in use with both Earth Baku and\n[SparklingGoblin, is considered a variant of CROSSWALK, a piece of malware that was described originally](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\nby Mandiant as an APT41 tool and remains distinct to the group, to the best of our knowledge.\nA unique certificate retrieved from multiple ScrambleCross C2 servers in the campaign described in this\nreport was sent as a response in a few other dozen servers in the wild, a few of them have been previously\n[reported by the FBI as being part of an APT41-owned infrastructure.](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/7210602/FLASH-AC-000133-TT-Published.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, the following observations are worth mentioning:\n\nThe user-mode malware stager deployed by the UEFI implant contains a scheduling logic that is somewhat\nsimilar to one seen in Microcin samples (some of which were also found on infected hosts in this\ncampaign). This suggests that these groups may be related through shared resources or a prime\ncontractor.\nThe said scheduling algorithm found in the stager can take a 672-bit bitmask to determine when the\nmalware should start beaconing the C2 server in an attempt to retrieve the payload, whereby the\nscheduled working time can be decided in a granularity of 15-minute slots (i.e. the stager checks if it is\nsupposed to run in a particular slot out of the 672 possibilities that constitute a full week, or alternatively\nsleep for 10 seconds before checking if it has reached a dedicated working slot again). A similar\nscheduling methodology occurs in the case of Microcin, but with a bitmask that simply represents the days\nof the week on which the malware ought to be active.\n\n**_Scheduling code used in MoonBounce’s user-mode stager_**\n\nThe Mimikat_ssp tool found on a few machines in the targeted network has been seen in use by multiple\nChinese-speaking threat actors in the past. One recent example is its use in the campaigns of\n[GhostEmperor as described in a previous report](https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSome elements of shellcode leveraged in MoonBounce were spotted in an old rootkit that was part of a\nmalicious framework dubbed xTalker, which has been seen in the wild since at least 2013, alongside\nseveral malware families affiliated to known actors, e.g. NetTraveler, Enfal and Microcin. It was prominently\nused against Russian-speaking targets including military, governmental entities and think-tanks.\nBoth components shared a similar name-hashing algorithm, which is outlined below, along with unique\ncorresponding function name hashes (e.g. 0x311B83F, the name hash of ExAllocatePool) that were not\nseen in use elsewhere in the wild.\n\n**_Name-hashing algorithm used identically in both MoonBounce and xTalker’s rootkit_**\n\nIn addition, both pieces of code used a technique of replacing magic marker values within shellcode buffers\nwith pointer addresses during runtime. MoonBounce’s code used the marker 0x1122334455667788, while\nthe xTalker rootkit’s code used 0x1234567812345678.\n\n**_Magic marker values replaced during execution within shellcodes in xTalker’s rootkit and_**\n**_MoonBounce_**\n\nIn the case of xTalker, the above code elements were found within shellcode intended to be staged through\nan MBR bootkit. However, it is not clear to what extent it was actually used. This may suggest that the\nMoonBounce and xTalker codes were authored by the same, or a closely affiliated, developer.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[In September 2020, the US Department of Justice released a series of indictments against members of the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nAPT41 group, charging them with a high number of computer intrusions against a variety of targets, both in the\nprivate and public sectors, some of which included high-profile supply chain attacks. The intrusion set described\nin this report, and in other public accounts we referred to, shows that the group did not cease to be active\ndespite these legal proceedings.\n\nMoreover, it is evident that the group maintains a high level of proficiency and sophistication in the development\nof its toolset, gaining a foothold in new areas like UEFI firmware. In this sense, the group has introduced its own\ninnovation to this landscape – patching an existing benign core component in the firmware (rather than adding a\n\n\n-----\n\nnew driver to it), thereby turning the UEFI firmware into a highly stealthy and persistent storage for malware in\nthe system.\n\n[Following previous predictions, we can now say that UEFI threats are gradually becoming a norm. With this in](https://securelist.com/ksb-threat-predictions-for-2018/83169/)\nmind, vendors are taking more precautions to mitigate attacks like MoonBounce, for example by enabling\nSecure Boot by default. We [assess that, in this ongoing arms race, attacks against UEFI will continue to](https://securelist.com/advanced-threat-predictions-for-2022/104870/)\nproliferate, with attackers evolving and finding ways to exploit and bypass current security measures.\n\nAs a safety measure against this attack and similar ones, it is recommended to update the UEFI firmware\nregularly and verify that BootGuard, where applicable, is enabled. Likewise, enabling Trust Platform Modules, in\ncase a corresponding hardware is supported on the machine, is also advisable. On top of all, a security product\nthat has visibility into the firmware images should add an extra layer of security, alerting the user on a potential\ncompromise if such occurs.\n\n## MoonBounce’
