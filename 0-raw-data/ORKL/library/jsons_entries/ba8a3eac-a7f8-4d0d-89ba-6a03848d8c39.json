(Do you seriously think that\nwe’ll ever see the end of spam, for example?)\n\nThis year, we’ve seen a carefully orchestrated ransomware campaign known as SamSam,\nwhere the crooks have settled on a new mode of operation.\n\nInstead of blasting out one copy of the malware out to thousands of potential victims over a\nday or two, the crooks blast thousands of copies of the malware onto computers inside a\nsingle organisation, pretty much all at once…\n\n…and then, almost casually, they offer a “volume discount” to fix the entire company in one\nfell swoop.\n\n[SophosLabs just published an intriguing technical paper about the SamSam menace, and in](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/technical-papers/samsam-ransomware-chooses-its-targets-carefully-wpna.aspx)\nthe sample discussed in the paper, the malware includes a BAT file that lets the crooks set\ntheir price point for each attack:\n```\n  @echo off\n  SET runner=mswinupdate.exe\n  SET password=%1\n  SET path=xxxxxxxxxx\n  SET totalprice=5\n  SET priceperhost=0.8\n\n```\nThe prices above are denominated in BTC (Bitcoin), with BTC0.8 being the cost to decrypt\nan individual computer, and BTC5 being the price of a “master key” to decrypt as many as\nyou want.\n\nThe Bitcoin prices seem to be adjusted, based on the BTC-to-US$ exchange rate at the time\nof the attack, so that the all-you-can-eat discount price works out at about $45,000 each\ntime.\n\nAt the equivalent of $7,200 per PC, but “just” $45,000 to decrypt your whole company, it’s\nalmost as though the criminals are doing you a favour!\n\nWe don’t know why the price is $45,000. For all we know, that number was picked because\nit’s below certain reporting thresholds, or because the crooks want to pick the highest value\nthey dare without getting into corporate board-level approval territory. All we can say is that\n$45,000 is a lot of money.\n\n[Learn more about this new trend in ransomware by reading the paper now.
