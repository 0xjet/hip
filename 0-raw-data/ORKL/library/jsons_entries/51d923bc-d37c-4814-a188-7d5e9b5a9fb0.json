Once the MegaCortex actors gain\naccess, they then push the ransomware out to machines on the network via an active\ndirectory controller or post-exploitation kits.\n\n## Significant changes in new MegaCortex version\n\n[In a new sample of the ransomware discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, reverse](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n[engineered by Vitali Kremez, and further analyzed by BleepingComputer, we see a new](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nversion of MegaCortex that has substantial changes from previous variants.\n\nThe most obvious change seen by victims is the new .m3g4c0rtx extension being used by\nthe ransomware as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MegaCortex Encrypted Files**\nIn addition, MegaCortex will now configure a legal notice on the encrypted machine so that\nit displays a basic \"Locked by MegaCortex\" ransom message with email contacts before a\nuser even logs in.\n\n**MegaCortex Legal Notice**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Behind the scenes, quite a bit has changed\n\nWhen the main MegaCortex launcher is executed, it will extract two DLL files and three\nCMD scripts to C:\\Windows\\Temp. This launcher is currently signed with a\nSectigo certificate for an Australia company named \"MURSA PTY LTD\".\n\n**C:\\Windows\\Temp Folder**\nThese CMD files will execute a variety of commands that removes shadow volume\ncopies, uses the Cipher command to wipe all free space on the C:\\ drive, sets the Legal\nNotice, and then cleans up all the files used to encrypt the computer.\n\n**First CMD Script**\nKremez told BleepingComputer in conversations that the two DLL files are used to encrypt\nthe files on the computer. One DLL file is a file iterator that looks for file to encrypt and the\nother DLL will be used to encrypt the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese DLLs are not injected into any processes, but rather run via Rundll32.exe.\n\nWhen done, victims will find a ransom note on the desktop titled !-!_README_!-!.rtf that\ncontains some interesting comments that at first we dismissed as idle threats.\n\n**MegaCortex Ransom Note**\nAfter further analysis, we determined that at least one of the threats is true; the ransomware\ndoes indeed change the victim's password for their Windows account.\n\n## MegaCortex changes the victim's Windows password\n\nIt is not uncommon for ransomware developers to make threats that are not carried out in\norder to scare victims into paying.\n\nDue to this, when we saw that the ransom note stated that a victim's credentials have been\nchanged, we dismissed it.\n\n\"All of your user credentials have been changed and your files have been encrypted.\"\n\nAfter testing the ransomware and rebooting the encrypted computer, I discovered that I was\nunable to login to my account.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther analysis of the code by Kremez confirmed that MegaCortex is indeed changing the\npassword for the victim's Windows account.\n\nIt does this by executing the net user command when the ransomware is executed.\n\n**Net user command**\nThis also explains why the attackers added a legal notice that is shown at the login prompt\nas the user will no longer be able to log in to access their desktop.\n\n## Threatens to publish victim's data\n\nIn addition to the proven claims of changing user credentials, the attackers have also\nchanged the ransom note to state that victim's data has been copied to a secure location.\n\nThey then threaten to make this data public if a victim does not pay the ransom.\n\n\"We have also downloaded your data to a secure location. In the unfortunate event of us\nnot coming to an agreement we will have no choice but to make this data public.\n\nOnce the transaction is finalized all of copies of data we have downloaded will be erased.\"\n\nIt is not confirmed if attackers have actually copied victims' files, but this threat should not\nbe dismissed and victim's may want to confirm that the attackers actually have their files as\nstated when communicating with them.\n\nIf the MegaCortex actors are actually copying data, though, victims will now have to treat\nthese attacks as a data breach going forward instead of just a ransomware infection.\n\nThis will ultimately add a whole new layer of complexity and risks to these types of attacks.\n\n**Update 11/7/19: Sectigo told BleepingComputer that they have revoked the certificate used**\nby this malware on November 5th at 4:20 PM ET.\n\n## IOCs:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hashes:\n```\nca0d1e770ca8b36f6945a707be7ff1588c3df2fd47031aa471792a1480b8dd53 [Launcher]\n5ff14746232a1d17e44c7d095e2ec15ede4bd01f35ae72cc36c2596274327af9 [DLL]\ne362d6217aff55572dc79158fae0ac729f52c1fc5356af4612890b9bd84fbcde [DLL]\n\n Associated files:\n!-!_README_!-!.rtf\n\n Ransom note text:\nYour company's network has been breached and infected with MegaCortex Malware. \nAll of your user credentials have been changed and your files have been encrypted.\nWe ensure that the only way to retrieve your data swiftly and securely is with our\nsoftware. \nRestoration of your data requires a private key which only we possess. \nTo confirm that our decryption software works email to us 2 files from random\ncomputers. \nYou will receive further instructions after you send us the test files. \nAfter receiving payment we will provide you with the decryptor including its full\nsource code and credentials to your computers.\nWe have also downloaded your data to a secure location.
