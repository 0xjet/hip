This may explain why the samples were only signed several hours\nafter being compiled.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n[The disclosure adds to a long list of hacking groups that have weaponized the Log4Shell](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/nhs-warns-of-hackers-targeting-log4j.html)\nvulnerability to strike VMware's virtualization platform.\n\nIn December 2021, CrowdStrike described an unsuccessful campaign undertaken by an adversary\n[dubbed Aquatic Panda that leveraged the flaw to perform various post-exploitation operations,](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/chinese-apt-hackers-used-log4shell.html)\nincluding reconnaissance and credential harvesting on targeted systems.\n\n[Since then, multiple groups have joined the fray, including the Iranian TunnelVision group, which](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-targeting-vmware.html)\nwas observed actively exploiting the Log4j logging library defect to compromise unpatched VMware\nHorizon servers with ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Most recently, cybersecurity company Sophos highlighted a slew of attacks against vulnerable](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/03/29/horde-of-miner-bots-and-backdoors-leveraged-log4j-to-attack-vmware-horizon-servers/)\nHorizon servers that have been ongoing since January and have been mounted by threat actors to\nillicitly mine cryptocurrency, install PowerShell-based reverse shells, or to deploy Atera agents to\nremotely deliver additional payloads.\n\n\"Attempts to compromise Horizon servers are among the more targeted exploits of Log4Shell\nvulnerabilities because of their nature,\" Sophos researchers said, adding \"platforms such as\nHorizon are particularly attractive targets to all types of malicious actors because they are\nwidespread and can (if still vulnerable) easily found and exploited with well-tested tools.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
