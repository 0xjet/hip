The attack leveraged malware we called\n‘BlackLambert’, which was used to target a high profile organization in Europe.\n\nSince at least 2008, The Lamberts have used multiple sophisticated attack tools against\nhigh-profile victims. Their arsenal includes network-driven backdoors, several generations of\nmodular backdoors, harvesting tools, and wipers. Versions for both Windows and OSX are\nknown at this time, with the latest samples created in 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the operational security displayed by actors using the Lamberts toolkit is very good,\none sample includes a PDB path that points to a project named “Archan~1” (perhaps\n‘Archangel’). The root folder on the PDB path is named “Hudson”. This is one of the very few\nmistakes we’ve seen with this threat actor.\n\nWhile in most cases the infection vector remains unknown, the high profile attack from 2014\nused a very complex Windows TTF zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148).\n\nKaspersky Lab products successfully detect and eradicate all the known malware from the\n[Lamberts family. For more information please contact: intelreports@kasperskycom](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## An Overview of the Lamberts\n\n_Figure 1. Lamberts discovery timeline_\n\nThe first time the Lambert family malware was uncovered publicly was in October 2014,\n[when FireEye posted a blog about a zero day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) used in the wild. The](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/two-targeted-attacks-two-new-zero-days.html)\nvulnerability was patched by Microsoft at the same time. We named the malware involved\n‘Black Lambert’ and described it thoroughly in a private report, available to Kaspersky APT\nIntel Reports subscribers.\n\nThe authors of Black Lambert included a couple of very interesting details in the sample,\nwhich read as the following: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName = 2.0.0. Looking for\nsimilar samples, we were able to identify another generation of related tools which we called\nWhite Lambert. While Black Lambert connects directly to its C&C for instructions, White\nLambert is a fully passive, network-driven backdoor.\n\nBlack Lambert White Lambert\n\nImplant type Active Passive\n\ntoolType wl aa (“ArchAngel”)\n\nbuild 132914 113140\n\nversionName 2.0.0 5.0.2\n\n_Internal configuration similarities in Black and White Lambert_\n\nWhite Lambert runs in kernel mode and intercepts network traffic on infected machines. It\ndecrypts packets crafted in a special format to extract instructions. We named these passive\nbackdoors ‘White Lambert’ to contrast with the active “Black Lambert” implants.\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking further for any other malware related to White Lambert and Black Lambert, we came\nby another generation of malware that we called Blue Lambert.\n\nOne of the Blue Lambert samples is interesting because it appears to have been used as\nsecond stage malware in a high profile attack, which involved the Black Lambert malware.\n\nLooking further for malware similar to Blue Lambert, we came by another family of malware\nwe called Green Lambert. Green Lambert is a lighter, more reliable, but older version of Blue\nLambert. Interestingly, while most Blue Lambert variants have version numbers in the range\nof 2.x, Green Lambert is mostly in 3.x versions. This stands in opposition to the data\ngathered from export timestamps and C&C domain activity that points to Green Lambert\nbeing considerably older than the Blue variant. Perhaps both Blue and Green Lamberts have\nbeen developed in parallel by two different teams working under the same umbrella, as\nnormal software version iterations, with one seeing earlier deployment than the other.\n\nSignatures created for Green Lambert (Windows) have also triggered on an OS X variant of\nGreen Lambert, with a very low version number: 1.2.0. This was uploaded to a multiscanner\nservice in September 2014. The OS X variant of Green Lambert is in many regards\nfunctionally identical to the Windows version, however it misses certain functionality such as\nrunning plugins directly in memory.\n\nKaspersky Lab detections for Blue, Black, and Green Lamberts have been triggered by a\nrelatively small set of victims from around the world. While investigating one of these\ninfections involving White Lambert (network-driven implant) and Blue Lambert (active\nimplant), we found yet another family of tools that appear to be related. We called this new\nfamily Pink Lambert.\n\nThe Pink Lambert toolset includes a beaconing implant, a USB-harvesting module and a\nmulti-platform orchestrator framework which can be used to create OS-independent\nmalware. Versions of this particular orchestrator were found on other victims, together with\nWhite Lambert samples, indicating a close relationship between the White and Pink Lambert\nmalware families.\n\nBy looking further for other undetected malware on victims of White Lambert, we found yet\nanother apparently related family. The new family, which we called Gray Lambert is the latest\niteration of the passive network tools from the Lamberts’ arsenal. The coding style of Gray\nLambert is similar to the Pink Lambert USB-harvesting module, however, the functionality\nmirrors that of White Lambert. Compared to White Lambert, Gray Lambert runs in user\nmode, without the need for exploiting a vulnerable signed driver to load arbitrary code on 64bit Windows variants.\n\nConnecting all these different families by shared code, data formats, C&C servers, and\nvictims, we have arrived at the following overarching picture:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. An overview of connections between the Lambert families_\n\n## The Lamberts in Brief – from Black to Gray\n\nBelow, we provide a small summary of all the Lamberts. A full description of all variants is\n[available to subscribers of Kaspersky APT Reports. Contact intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n### Black Lambert\n\nThe only known sample of Black Lambert was dropped by a TTF-exploit zero day (CVE2014-4148). Its internal configuration included a proxy server which suggests the malware\nwas created to work in a very specific network configuration, inside the victim’s network.\n\nAn internal description of Black Lambert indicates what appears to be a set of markers used\nby the attackers to denote this particular branch: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName\n**= 2.0.0.**\n\n\n-----\n\nHash Description\n\n683afdef710bf3c96d42e6d9e7275130 generic loader (hdmsvc.exe)\n\n79e263f78e69110c09642bbb30f09ace winlib.dll, final payload (toolType=wl)\n\n### Blue Lambert\n\nThe Blue Lambert implants contain what appear to be version numbers in the 2.x range,\ntogether with project/operation codename sets, which may also indicate codenames for the\nvictims or campaigns.\n\n_Figure 4. Blue Lambert configuration in decrypted form, highlighting internal codenames_\n\nKnown codenames include TRUE CRIME (2.2.0.2), CERVELO YARDBIRD (2.6.1.1), GAI\nSHU (2.2.0.5), DOUBLESIDED SCOOBYSNACK (2.3.0.2), FUNNELCAKE CARNIVAL\n(2.5.0.2), PROSPER SPOCK (2.0.0.2), RINGTOSS CARNIVAL (2.4.2.2), COD FISH\n(2.2.0.0), and INVERTED SHOT (2.6.2.3).\n\n### Green Lambert\n\nGreen Lambert is a family of tools deeply related to Blue Lambert. The functionality is very\nsimilar, both Blue and Green are active implants. The configuration data shares the same\nstyle of codenames for victims, operations, or projects.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Green Lambert configuration block (decrypted) highlighting internal codenames_\n\nThe Green Lambert family is the only one where non-Windows variants have been found. An\nold version of Green Lambert, compiled for OS X was uploaded from Russia to a\nmultiscanner service in 2014. Its internal codename is HO BO (1.2.0).\n\nThe Windows versions of Green Lambert have the following code names: BEARD BLUE\n(2.7.1), GORDON FLASH (3.0), APE ESCAPE (3.0.2), SPOCK LOGICAL (3.0.2), PIZZA\nASSAULT (3.0.5), and SNOW BLOWER (3.0.5).\n\nInterestingly, one of the droppers of Green Lambert abused an ICS software package named\n“Subway Environmental Simulation Program” or “SES”, which has been available on certain\nforums visited by engineers working with industrial software. Similar techniques have been\nobserved in the past from other threat groups, for instance, trojanized Oracle installers by the\nEquation group.\n\n### White Lambert\n\nWhite Lambert is a family of tools that share the same internal description as Black Lambert.\nKnown tool types, builds, and version names include:\n\nToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 7, versionName 5.0.2, build 113140\nToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 7, versionName 5.0.0, build 113140\nToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 6, versionName 4.2.0, build 110836M\nToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 5, versionName 3.2.0\n\nOne of the White Lambert samples is interesting because it has a forgotten PDB path inside,\nwhich points to “Archan~1l” and “Hudson”. Hudson could point to a project name, if the\nauthors name their projects by rivers in the US, or, it could also be the developer’s first\n\n\n-----\n\nname. The truncated (8.3) path archan~1 most likely means Archangel . The tool type aa\ncould also suggest “ArchAngel”. By comparison, the Black Lambert tool type “wl” has no\nknown meaning.\n\nWhite Lambert samples run in kernel mode and sniff network traffic looking for special\npackets containing instructions to execute. To run unsigned code in kernel mode on 64-bit\nWindows, White Lambert uses an exploit against a signed, legitimate SiSoftware Sandra\ndriver. The same method was used before by Turla, ProjectSauron, and Equation’s Grayfish,\nwith other known, legitimate drivers.\n\n### Pink Lambert\n\nPink Lambert is a suite of tools initially discovered on a White Lambert victim. It includes a\nbeaconing implant, partially based on publicly available source code. The source code on top\nof which Pink Lambert’s beaconing implant was created is “A Fully Featured Windows HTTP\nWrapper in C++”.\n\n_Figure 6. “A Fully Featured Windows HTTP Wrapper” by shicheng_\n\nOther tools in the Pink Lambert suite include USB stealer modules and a very complex multiplatform orchestrator.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a second incident, a Pink Lambert orchestrator was found on another White Lambert\nvictim, substantiating the connection between the Pink and White Lamberts.\n\n### Gray Lambert\n\nGray Lambert is the most recent tool in the Lamberts’ arsenal. It is a network-driven\nbackdoor, similar in functionality to White Lambert. Unlike White Lambert, which runs in\nkernel mode, Gray Lambert is a user-mode implant. The compilation and coding style of\nGray Lambert is similar to the Pink Lambert USB stealers. Gray Lambert initially appeared\non the computers of victims infected by White Lambert, which could suggest the authors\nwere upgrading White Lambert infections to Gray. This migration activity was last observed in\nOctober 2016.\n\nSome of the known filenames for Gray Lambert are mwapi32.dll and poolstr.dll – it should be\npointed though that the filenames used by the Lamberts are generally unique and have\nnever been used twice.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMost of the Blue and Green Lambert samples have two C&C servers hardcoded in their\nconfiguration block: a hostname and an IP address. Using our own pDNS as well as\nDomainTools IP history, we plotted the times when the C&C servers were active and pointing\nto the same IP address as the one from the configuration block.\n\nUnfortunately, this method doesn’t work for all samples, since some of them don’t have a\ndomain for C&C. Additionally, in some cases we couldn’t find any pDNS information for the\nhostname configured in the malware.\n\nLuckily, the attackers have made a few mistakes, which allow us to identify the activity times\nfor most of the other samples. For instance, in case when no pDNS information was\navailable for a subdomain on top of the main C&C domain, the domain registration dates\nwere sufficient to point out when the activity began. Additionally, in some cases the top\ndomain pointed to the same IP address as the one from the configuration file, allowing us to\nidentify the activity times.\n\nAnother worthwhile analysis method focuses on the set of Blue Lambert samples that have\nexports. Although most compilation timestamps in the PE header appear to have been\ntampered (to reflect a 2003-2004 range), the authors forgot to alter the timestamps in the\nexport section. This allowed us to identify not just the activity / compilation timestamps, but\nalso the method used for faking the compilation timestamps in the PE header.\n\nIt seems the algorithm used to tamper with the samples was the following: subtract 0x10\nfrom the highest byte of timestamp (which amounts to about 8 and half years) and then\nrandomize the lowest 3 bytes. This way we conclude that for Blue Lamberts, that original\n\n\n-----\n\ncompilation time of samples was in the range of 2012-2015.\n\nPutting together all the various families, with recovered activity times, we come to the\nfollowing picture:\n\n_Figure 8. A timeline of activity for known Lamberts_\n\nAs it can be seen from the chart above, Green Lambert is the oldest and longest-running in\nthe family, while Gray is the newest. White, Blue and Pink somehow overlap in deployment,\nwith Blue replacing Green Lambert. Black Lambert was seen only briefly and we assume it\nwas “retired” from the arsenal after being discovered by FireEye in 2014.\n\n### Codenames and Popular Culture Referenced in Lamberts\n\nThe threat group(s) behind the Lambert toolkits have used a large number of codenames\nextensively throughout their projects. Some of these codenames are references to old\ncomputer games, Star Trek, and cartoons, which is very unusual for high profile APT groups.\nWe really enjoyed going through the backstories of these codenames and wanted to provide\nthem below for others to enjoy as well.\n\nFor instance, one of the Green Lambert versions has the internal codename “GORDON\nFLASH”, which can also be read as “FLASH GORDON”. Flash Gordon is the hero of a space\nopera adventure comic strip created by and originally drawn by Alex Raymond. It was first\npublished in 1934 and subsequently turned into a popular film in 1980.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Flash Gordon poster_\n\nA ‘Funnel cake’ is a regional food popular in North America at carnivals, fairs, sporting\nevents, and seaside resorts. This explains the codename “FUNNELCAKE CARNIVAL”:\n\n_Figure 9. A typical funnel cake_\n\nSpock and Prosper obviously refers to Star Trek, the well-known science fiction television\nseries created by Gene Roddenberry. Cdr. Spock is a half-Vulcan, half-human character,\nportrayed by Leonard Nimoy. “Live long and prosper” is the traditional Vulcan greeting in the\nseries.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Leonard Nimoy as “Spock” displaying the traditional Vulcan greeting “Live long and prosper”_\n\nRingtoss is a game that is very popular at carnivals in North America.\n\n\n-----\n\nDOUBLESIDED SCOOBYSNACK is likely a reference to an NFL Lip Reading video featuring\n[Adrian Peterson that went viral in mid-2013. According to the urban dictionary, it is also used](https://youtu.be/qe_324wnNQU?t=6s)\nto denote a sexual game in which the participants are dressed as Scooby-Doo and his\nmaster.\n\n[Ape Escape (also known as Saru Get You (サルゲッチュ Saru Getchu) in Japan) is a series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_Escape)\nof video games made by SCE Japan Studio, starting with Ape Escape for PlayStation in\n1999. The series often incorporates ape-related humor, unique gameplay, and a wide variety\nof pop culture references; it is also notable for being the first game to make the DualShock or\nDual Analog controller mandatory.\n\n_Ape Escape_\n\nINVERTED SHOT is likely a reference to a mixed martial arts move also known as an\n‘Imanari roll takedown’, named after Masakazu Imanari who popularized the grappling\ntechnique. It consists of a modified Brazilian jiu-jitsu granby roll that places the fighter in\ninverted guard position while taking the opponent down to the mat.\n\nGAI and SHU (as used in Green Lambert OS X) are characters from the Guilty Crown anime\nseries. Gai Tsutsugami (恙神 涯 Tsutsugami Gai) is the 17-year-old resourceful and\ncharismatic leader of the “Funeral Parlor” resistance group, while Shu Ouma (桜満 集 Ōma\nShū) is the 17-year-old main protagonist of Guilty Crown.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Main characters of Guilty Crown with Shu Ouma in the middle._\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe Lamberts toolkit spans across several years, with most activity occurring in 2013 and\n2014. Overall, the toolkit includes highly sophisticated malware, which relies on high-level\ntechniques to sniff network traffic, run plugins in memory without touching the disk, and\nleverages exploits against signed drivers to run unsigned code on 64-bit Windows.\n\nTo further exemplify the proficiency of the attackers leveraging the Lamberts toolkit,\ndeployment of Black Lambert included a rather sophisticated TTF zero day exploit, CVE2014-4148. Taking that into account, we classify the Lamberts as the same level of\ncomplexity as Regin, ProjectSauron, Equation and Duqu2, which makes them one of the\nmost sophisticated cyber espionage toolkits we have ever analysed.\n\nConsidering the complexity of these projects and the existence of an implant for OS X, we\nassume that it is highly possible that other Lamberts also exist for other platforms, such as\nLinux. The fact that in the vast majority of cases the infection method is unknown probably\nmeans there are still a lot of unknown details about these attacks and the group(s)\nleveraging them.\n\nAs usual, defense against attacks such as those from the Lamberts/Longhorn should include\na multi-layered approach. Kaspersky products include special mitigation strategies against\nthe malware used by this group, as well as the many other APT groups we track.
