Researchers at the Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) found](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/01/25/the-rise-of-amadey-bot-a-growing-concern-for-internet-security/)\ngamers being victimized by phishing websites under the guise of offering gaming hacks and\ncheats.\n\nThis info-stealing trojan can copy login details from several browsers and has been found to\nhave infected devices in attacks launched by the LockBit ransomware group in 2022.
