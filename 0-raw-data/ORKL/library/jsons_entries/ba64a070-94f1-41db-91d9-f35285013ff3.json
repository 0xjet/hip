    "plain_text": "# Dark Tequila Añejo\n\n**securelist.com/dark-tequila-anejo/87528/**\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nDark Tequila is a complex malicious campaign targeting Mexican users, with the primary\npurpose of stealing financial information, as well as login credentials to popular websites that\nrange from code versioning repositories to public file storage accounts and domain\nregistrars.\n\nA multi-stage payload is delivered to the victim only when certain conditions are met;\navoiding infection when security suites are installed or the sample is being run in an analysis\nenvironment. From the target list retrieved from the final payload, this particular campaign\ntargets customers of several Mexican banking institutions and contains some comments\nembedded in the code written in the Spanish language, using words only spoken in Latin\nAmerica.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the victims are located in Mexico. The campaign has been active since at least 2013,\nso it is a very ‘añejo’ (mature) product. There are two known infection vectors: spearphishing and infection by USB device.\n\nThe threat actor behind it strictly monitors and controls all operations. If there is a casual\ninfection, which is not in Mexico or is not of interest, the malware is uninstalled remotely from\nthe victim’s machine.\n\n_(Translation for “Abrir la carpeta para ver los archivos” – “Open folder to see files”. The word_\n\n_“Archivos” is used by Spanish speakers from Latin America only)_\n\nThe Dark Tequila malware and its supporting infrastructure are unusually sophisticated for a\nfinancial fraud operation. The malicious implant contains all the modules required for the\noperation and, when instructed to do so by net command server, different modules decrypt\nand activate. All stolen data is uploaded to the server in encrypted form.\n\nThis campaign modules are as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nModule 1, which is responsible for communication with the command and control\nserver. It verifies if a man-in-the-middle network check is being performed, by validating\nthe certificates with a few very popular websites.\nModule 2 – CleanUp. If the service detects any kind of ‘suspicious’ activity in the\nenvironment, such as the fact that it is running on a virtual machine, or that debugging\ntools are running in the background, it will execute this module to perform a full cleanup\nof the system, removing the persistence service as well as any files created previously\non the system.\nModule 3 – Keylogger and Windows Monitor. This is designed to steal credentials from\na long list of online banking sites, as well as generic Cpanels, Plesk, online flight\nreservation systems, Microsoft Office365, IBM lotus notes clients, Zimbra email,\nBitbucket, Amazon, GoDaddy, Register, Namecheap, Dropbox, Softlayer, Rackspace,\nand other services.\nModule 4 – Information stealer, which is designed to steal saved passwords in email\nand FTP clients, as well as from browsers.\nModule 5 – The USB infector. This copies an executable file to a removable drive to run\nautomatically. This enables the malware to move offline through the victim’s network,\neven when only one machine was initially compromised via spear-phishing. When\nanother USB is connected to the infected computer, it automatically becomes infected,\nand ready to spread the malware to another target.\nModule 6 – The service watchdog. This service is responsible for making sure that the\nmalware is running properly.\n\nAll the described modules are embedded inside the main sample and could be extracted\nduring the analysis process.\n\nThe campaign remains active. It is designed to be deployed in any part of the world, and\nattack any targets according to the interests of the threat actor behind it. Kaspersky Lab\ndetects the campaign as Trojan.Win32.DarkTequila and Trojan.Win64.DarkTequila.\n\n## Reference hashes:\n\n4f49a01e02e8c47d84480f6fb92700aa091133c894821fff83c7502c7af136d9\n\ndce2d575bef073079c658edfa872a15546b422ad2b74267d33b386dc7cc85b47\n\n## Reference C2s:\n\nhttps://46[.]17[.]97[.]12/website/\n\nhttps://174[.]37[.]6[.]34/98157cdfe45945293201e71acb2394d2\n\nhttps://75[.]126[.]60[.]251/store/\n\nFor more information about this campaign, please contact us at\n[financialintel@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:financialintel@kaspersky.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nDark Tequila Añejo\n\nYour email address will not be published.
