This\npresented yet another opportunity for attackers to leverage this subject for targeted attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nand/or phishing campaigns.\n\nWe uncovered a very interesting document that was observed impersonating the United\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission. It is our assumption with a high degree of\nprobability that an attacker called Cloud Atlas is responsible for this malicious campaign.\n\n\nFile\nType\n\n\nMicrosoft Excel 2007\n\n\nSha-256 [8df0d05c36a64b13869343917076ba8f65604ea1ecde50292f361ad4e34b4b09](https://labs.inquest.net/dfi/sha256/8df0d05c36a64b13869343917076ba8f65604ea1ecde50292f361ad4e34b4b09)\n\nThe document appears to be a request to obtain data from Russian clients.\n\nImage 1. Visual lure.\nOn the date observed, the document had very low detection rates. Contained in the graph\nbelow, you can see how document detection changed day by day.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 2. VT Detection Graph\nLet's dive into the analysis of this document to examine the payload as well as what\ntechniques are in use.\n\nImage 3. Disassembled P-code\nThe purpose of the first stage of the attack, as is often the case, is to retrieve and execute\nthe payload of the next stage. In the image above we find a URL address which points to a\nZIP file containing compressed suspicious data to be executed on the system.\n\n2 Stage > hxxps://cvg[.]org/wp-content/uploads/2020/document.zip\n\nFileType MSI installer package file\n\nSha 256 ff06cffedc00b97f82005c9768951d0e8c18c63ba36e584aef3c7c9e845e62e0\n\nThis sample also shows a low rate of detection after uploading to VirusTotal.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 4. VirusTotal Graph\nff06cffedc00b97f82005c9768951d0e8c18c63ba36e584aef3c7c9e845e62e0\n\nAfter downloading this installation package, the program starts installing the executable\ncomponents. The installation file contains a few legitimate files along with one malicious\nlibrary (main) that is installed in the following directory.\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\EdgeTools\\edgecef.dll\n\nImage 5. Contents of the\n\ninstallation package.\nWe believe that this is one of the malicious tools of the Cloud Atlas APT group. It beacons\nout to a remote server, waiting for further commands. Initially, this sample collects information\nabout the system it is running on, which is then exfiltrated to the remote server.\n\nThis attacker has been active for many years, identified in 2014, the group is known for using\ndocuments to infect government organizations such as embassies or organizations affiliated\nwith the aerospace industry.\n\nIndicators:\n\nType Indicator\n\nDocument 8df0d05c36a64b13869343917076ba8f65604ea1ecde50292f361ad4e34b4b09\n\nMSI ff06cffedc00b97f82005c9768951d0e8c18c63ba36e584aef3c7c9e845e62e0\n\n\n-----\n\nx86 Dll 4eb85a5532b98cbc4a6db1697cf46b9e2b7e28e89d6bbfc137b36c0736cd80e2\n\nC2 driverwindowsupdate[.]at  212.193.48.150\n\nC2 windowsdriverupdate[.]at  212.193.48.150\n\n.\n\nTags\n\n[labs\nin-the-wild\nthreat-hunting](https://inquest.net/taxonomy/term/47)\n\n\n## Get The InQuest Insider\n\n[Find us on Twitter for frequent updates, follow our Blog for bi-weekly technical write-](https://twitter.com/inquest)\nups, or subscribe here to receive our monthly newsletter, The InQuest Insider.
