Moreover, this crew’s most unusual characteristic is that for several years\nthe Darkhotel APT has maintained a capability to use hotel networks to follow and hit\nselected targets as they travel around the world. These travelers are often top executives\nfrom a variety of industries doing business and outsourcing in the APAC region. Targets have\nincluded CEOs, senior vice presidents, sales and marketing directors and top R&D staff. This\nhotel network intrusion set provides the attackers with precise global scale access to high\nvalue targets. From our observations, the highest volume of offensive activity on hotel\nnetworks started in August 2010 and continued through 2013, and we are investigating some\n2014 hotel network events.\n\nIn addition to polluting p2p networks to infect the masses, they delegitimize Certificate\nAuthorities to further their attacks. They abuse weakly implemented digital certificates to sign\ntheir malcode. The actor abused the trust of at least ten CAs in this manner. Currently they\nare stealing and re-using other legitimate certificates to sign their mostly static backdoor and\n\n\n-----\n\ninfostealer toolset. Their infrastructure grows and shrinks over time, with no consistent\npattern to the setup. It is both protected with flexible data encryption and poorly defended\nwith weak functionality.\n\nVictim categories include the following verticals:\n\nVery large electronics manufacturing\nInvestment capital and private equity\nPharmaceuticals\nCosmetics and chemicals manufacturing offshoring and sales\nAutomotive manufacturer offshoring services\nAutomotive assembly, distribution, sales, and services\nDefense industrial base\nLaw enforcement and military services\nNon-governmental organizations\n\nAbout 90 percent of the infections appear to be located in Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia and\nSouth Korea, partly because of the group’s indiscriminate spread of malware. Overall, since\n2008, the infection count numbers in the thousands. The more interesting travelling targets\ninclude top executives from the US and Asia doing business and investment in the APAC\nregion. A combination of Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) detections and command and\ncontrol data recorded infections in the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore,\nKazakhstan, South Korea, the Philippines, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Germany, Ireland,\nMexico, Belgium, Serbia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Greece, Italy and others. This actor’s victim\ngeolocation distribution has a long tail, and multiple significant targets and victims travel\nfrequently throughout many of these countries. So, victim geolocation changes while they are\ntravelling frequently.\n\nWhen Kaspersky Lab researchers visited Darkhotel incident destinations with honeypot\nmachines they did not attract Darkhotel attacks, which suggests the APT acts selectively..\nFurther work demonstrated just how careful these attackers were to hide their activity – as\nsoon as a target was effectively infected, they deleted their tools from the hotel network\nstaging point, maintaining a hidden status.\n\nDarkhotel activity and objects have leaked out in bits and pieces over the past few years, but\nwe have identified Darkhotel tools dating back to 2007. Considering their well-resourced,\nadvanced exploit development efforts and large, dynamic infrastructure, we expect more\nDarkhotel activity in the coming years. Our Darkhotel report and appendices of indicators\nand technical details collects and organizes this APT’s activity to date.\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Botnets](https://securelist.com/tag/botnets/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Keyloggers](https://securelist.com/tag/keyloggers/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Zero-day vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nThe Darkhotel APT\n\nYour email address will not be published.
