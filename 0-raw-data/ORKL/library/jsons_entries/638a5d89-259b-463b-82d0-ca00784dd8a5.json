Elaborate Social Media Attack Operation\n\nBy [Mike Lennon on May 29, 2014](http://www.securityweek.com/authors/mike-lennon)\n\n\n**[Share](javascript:void(0);)** **80**\n\n\n1

**Recommend** 4\n\n|Share|80|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Iranian threat actors, using more than a dozen fake personas on popular social networking**\n**sites, have been running a wide‐spanning cyber espionage operation since 2011, according to**\n**cyber intelligence firm** **[iSIGHT Partners.](http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/05/newscaster-great-case-cyber-threat-intelligence/)**\n\nThe recently uncovered activity, which iSIGHT Partners calls NEWSCASTER, was a “brazen,\ncomplex multi‐year cyber‐espionage that used a low‐tech approach to avoid traditional security\ndefenses –exploiting social media and people who are often the ‘weakest link’ in the security\nchain.”\n\nUsing the fake personas, including at least two (falsified) legitimate identities from leading news\norganizations, and young, attractive women, the attackers were supported by a fictitious news\norganization called NewsOnAir.org (Do Not Visit) and were successful in connecting or victimizing\nover 2,000 individuals.\n\n“These credible personas then connected, linked, followed, and “friended” target victims, giving\nthem access to information on location, activities, and relationships from updates and other\ncommon content ” iSIGHT Partners said\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers used popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+,\nYouTube and Blogger as their attack platform.\n\nWhile the attack method is not novel, the cyber intelligence firm says that what this group lacks in\ntechnical sophistication they make up for in brashness, creativity, and patience.\n\nWorking undetected since 2011, iSIGHT Partners said targets included senior U.S. military and\ndiplomatic personnel, congressional personnel, Washington D.C. area journalists, U.S. think tanks,\ndefense contractors in the U.S. and Israel.\n\nOther victims targeted were in the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Iraq and also included vocal supporters of\nIsrael.\n\n“Though it is possible anyone connected to the network was compromised, deliberate attempts to\nconnect with certain entities suggest an interest in political, military, diplomatic and technical\nintelligence,” the closely held report said.\n\n“Largely this campaign was about credential harvesting and recon,” Stephen Ward, Senior Director\nof Marketing at iSIGHT Partners, told _SecurityWeek._\n\n“They are using those connections to harvest connections to corporate email, harvest connections\nto personal email, and use those springboards for further lateral [movement], “ he said.\n\nAfter making connections on social networks, targets were sent spear‐phishing messages, often\nwith links asking recipients to log‐in to fake pages in order to capture credentials.\n\nBelow is a list of some of the accounts/fake personas allegedly used by the attackers.\n\nThe campaign also leveraged malware, and while the malware used was not particularly\nsophisticated, it does includes the capability to exfiltrate data.\n\n\n-----\n\nreferring to assumed Irianian attackers. They have taken to the cyber world the same way you can\ncompare the impact of [improvised explosive devices]. The approach is low cost and does not really\nuse a lot of sophistication from an exploit perspective, but is very effective and ultimately a bit\nmore under the radar.”\n\n“Adversaries such as these are increasingly adept at finding and exploiting opportunities to carry\nout cyber espionage, even when lacking sophisticated capability,” iSIGHT Partners concluded.\n“NEWSCASTER’s success is largely due to its patience, brazen nature, and innovative use of\nmultiple social media platforms.”\n\nOrganizations involved in critical infrastructure, or who have information that may be of strategic\nor tactical interest to a nation‐state adversary should be concerned about a threat such as this,\niSIGHT Partners warned.\n\nWe are protective of sources and methods, but we can confirm that these actors did not go\nunnoticed by some targeted entities and they left significant evidence of their activity throughout\nthe Internet.\n\n**Attribution to Iran**\n\nAccording to iSIGHT Partners, there is no direct information showing that the Iranian government\nis the ultimate sponsor of the campaign, but iSIGH researchers do believe the threat actors are\nlocated in Iran.\n\n“[The attackers] maintained a regular schedule, including what appears to be a lengthy lunch\nbreak followed by the remainder of the work day,” the report said. “These hours conform to work\nhours in Tehran. Furthermore, the operators work half the day on Thursday and rarely work on\nFriday, the Iranian weekend.”\n\nAdditional clues, such as the targets the attackers selected, along with additional technical\nindicators, sparked iSIGHT to believe NEWSCASTER stems from Iran.\n\niSIGHT Partners said it did coordinate with the FBI to brief government agencies and also notified\nFacebook, LinkedIn and other social networks.\n\nAccording to Ward, the identified malicious personas have been removed from Facebook and\nLinkedIn.\n\n[The report from iSIGHT Partners comes roughly two weeks after a report from FireEye, which](http://www.securityweek.com/fireeye-details-elevated-attack-skills-iranian-linked-hacker-group)\nsuggested that Iranian attackers’ methodologies have “grown more consistent with other advanced\npersistent threat (APT) actors in and around Iran\" following cyber attacks against Iran in the late\n2000s.\n\n“Iran has steadily increased their focus on cyber espionage over the years, placing significant\nemphasis on enhancing capabilities following the Stuxnet attacks,” Michael Sutton, VP of Security\nResearch for Zscaler, told SecurityWeek. “The NEWSCASTER attacks, while not technically\nsophisticated were allegedly quite successful. Often social engineering can be the most powerful\ntool in an attacker's arsenal.”\n\nSocial networks are a significant challenge for security teams, Sutton says.\n\n“They generally represent a personal communication medium which the organization does not have\ndirect control over and yet can become a source of leaked data or a catalyst for attack as has been\nseen in the NEWSCASTER attacks. Moreover, due to password reuse, even if an attacker can gain\naccess to credentials used by a victim on personal accounts, there is a string likelihood that the\nsame credentials have also been used for more sensitive corporate accounts.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nsophisticated hackers backed by nation states target the weakest link on networks ‐‐ the user with\nrelatively unsophisticated techniques including spear phishing and social media,” Anup Ghosh,\nfounder and CEO of Invincea, told SecurityWeek.\n\n“Using social media is both a way of establishing false bona fides while presenting a well accepted\nvector for reaching targets,” Ghosh continued. “A simple LinkedIn or Twitter update with a link, or\na timely email from a connection with embedded link or attachment is enough to compromise the\nintended target's machine, accounts, data, and enterprise network.”\n\n\"This is not surprising as every major foreign adversary is leveraging social media as a cyber attack\nvector,” added James C. Foster, CEO of ZeroFOX. “Our government realizes this threat is\nincreasing and social media is being used for target reconnaissance and exploitation.”\n\n**Listen to the Podcast:** [Inside the 'NEWSCASTER' Cyber Espionage Campaign](http://www.securityweek.com/podcast-inside-newscaster-cyber-espionage-campaign)\n\n**Related Reading:** [Social Media a Key Element for Terror Groups](http://www.securityweek.com/social-media-key-element-terror-groups-study)\n\n**Related Reading:** [News Junkies Make Great Targets](http://www.securityweek.com/news-junkies-make-great-targets)\n\n**[Share](javascript:void(0);)** **80** 1 [Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.securityweek.com%2Firanian-hackers-targeted-us-officials-elaborate-social-media-attack-operation&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&text=Iranian%20Hackers%20Targeted%20US%20Officials%20in%20Elaborate%20Social%20Media%20Attack%20Operation%20%7C%20SecurityWeek.Com&tw_p=tweetbutton&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.securityweek.com%2Firanian-hackers-targeted-us-officials-elaborate-social-media-attack-operation&via=SecurityWeek) **Recommend** 4\n\nFor more than 10 years, Mike Lennon has been closely monitoring and analyzing trends in the\nenterprise IT security space and the threat landscape.
