The plethora of information exposed in the fifth and last leak by the Shadow Brokers,\ncalled “Lost in Translation”, and the following consequences that took shape in WannaCry and\nNotPetya among other things, makes this a changing point in the game of cyber security as we\nknow it.\n\n[Recently, security researcher Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade revealed a previously misidentified](https://www.epicturla.com/blog/the-lost-nazar)\nand unknown threat group, called Nazar, which was part of the last leak by the Shadow Brokers.\nIn this research, we will expand upon the analysis done by Juan and another which was written\nby [Maciej Kotowicz, and will provide an in-depth analysis of each of the Nazar components. But](https://blog.malwarelab.pl/posts/nazar_eyservice/)\nthe real question is, do those new revelations add a missing piece to the puzzle, or do they\nshow us how much of the puzzle we are missing?\n\n## Prior Knowledge\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the “Lost in Translation” leak by the Shadow Brokers brought infamous exploits such as\n_EternalBlue into the limelight, it contained many more valuable components that showed some_\nof the possible precautions taken by the Equation Group operators before launching an attack.\n\nA screenshot from the original post by the Shadow Brokers\nFor example, among the leaked files was one called “drv_list.txt“, which included a list of driver\nnames and corresponding remarks that were sent back to the operators if the drivers were\nfound on the target system. Naturally, the list contained many drivers that could detect the\npresence of an anti-virus product or a security solution (ourselves included):\n\nDrivers mentioned in “drv_list.txt”\n\nBut even more curious were the names of malicious drivers in this list, which if found could\nindicate that the target system has already been compromised by another attacker, and would\nthen warn the operators to “pull back”. Another pivotal component in the Equation Group’s\narsenal that is in charge of such checks is called “Territorial Dispute”, or “TeDi”.\n\n\n-----\n\nTerritorial\n\nDispute, as seen in the leaked sources\nSimilar to a scan conducted by a security product, “TeDi” consists of 45 signatures that are used\nto search the target system for registry keys or filenames associated with other threat groups.\nBut we can assume that the end purpose in this case, unlike that of a security scan, is to make\nsure that Equation Group’s operations are not disrupted and that their own tools are not\ndetected by other adversaries (or “other peeps”, as they are called in “TeDi”) monitoring the\nsame system.\n\nCode snippet from TeDi’s leaked sources\nIn certain cases, this also guarantees that the Equation Group themselves do not disrupt the\nongoing operations of “friendly” threat groups, and do not attack the same target.\n\n[Extensive research work has been done by CrySys Labs in 2018 to try and map each of the 45](https://www.crysys.hu/publications/files/tedi/ukatemicrysys_territorialdispute.pdf)\nsignatures to the respective threat group it is meant to detect since no names were included in\n“TeDi” itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamples for signatures found on TeDi’s leaked sources\nDespite the relatively scarce amount of information it contains, security researchers often revisit\n“TeDi” in an attempt to get a better understanding of threat groups that the Equation Group had\nvisibility to back then, as some of which are still (to this day) unknown to the public.\n\nSecurity researcher Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade has shown that the 37th signature in “TeDi”\nwhich looks for a file called “Godown.dll” points to what might be an Iranian threat group he\ndubbed “Nazar”, rather than a Chinese one as initially thought in the CrySys Lab report.\n\nSIG37, the signature to\n\ndetect “Nazar” by looking for “godown.dll”\nThe beauty of the “TeDi” project is perhaps in its minimalism: the small number of signatures it\ncontained gave the Equation Group the capability of detecting the activity of notorious threat\ngroups that have eluded detection and managed to remain in the shadows for years: Turla,\nDuqu, Dark Hotel, and the list goes on. This is the result of what we can only estimate as years\nof intelligence and research work on the Equation Group’s part. Equipped with this knowledge\nwe set out to find more about the mysterious newly discovered player included in this watchlist:\nNazar.\n\n## Execution Flow\n\nNazar’s activity is believed to have started somewhere around 2008, meaning that the group\nwas active for at least four years, as the latest samples were created in 2012.\n\nThe CrySys Labs report pointed to a file possibly related to the 37th signature, which turned out\nto be an anti-virus signature database from 2015 that detected this unique Nazar artifact,\n“Godown.dll”. Surprisingly, the same signature contained names of the other artifacts that we\nhave seen being used by the Nazar malware (and will explain in detail in the following sections),\nmeaning that some security companies were already fully aware of this malicious activity back\nthen, prior to the “TeDi” leak:\n\n\n-----\n\nAn anti-virus signature that was detecting Nazar\nThe initial binary that is executed in Nazar’s flow is `gpUpdates.exe . It is a Self-Extracting`\n[Archive (SFX) created by a program called “Zip 2 Secure EXE“. Upon execution,](https://www.chilkatsoft.com/ChilkatSfx.asp) `gpUpdates`\nwrites three files to disk: `Data.bin,` `info, and` `Distribute.exe . Then,` `gpUpdates.exe`\nwill start `Distribute.exe which operates as an installing component.`\n\n### Distribute.exe\n\nAt the start, `Distribute.exe will read the other two files that were dropped by` `gpUpdates :`\n```\ninfo and Data.bin . The Data.bin file is a binary blob that contains multiple PE files that\n\n```\nare concatenated in a sequence. The `info file is a very small file that contains a simple struct`\nwith the lengths of the PE files in `Data.bin .` `Distribute.exe will read` `Data.bin as a`\nstream, file by file, in the order of file lengths as shown in `info .`\n\nThe following table shows the files concatenated in `Data.bin against the lengths written in`\n```\ninfo .\n\n```\n**Data.bin (sequence of files)** **info (lengths)**\n\nsvchost.exe 213504\n\nFilesystem.dll 262219\n\nViewScreen.dll 196608\n\nlame_enc.dll 162304\n\nhodll.dll 57344\n\nGodown.dll 32768\n\nAfter the aforementioned files are dropped to the disk, `Distribute.exe will register 3 of the`\nDLL files to the registry, by using `regsvr32 .`\n```\nShellExecuteA(0, \"open\", \"regsvr32.exe\", \"Godown.dll -s\", 0, 0);\nShellExecuteA(0, \"open\", \"regsvr32.exe\", \"ViewScreen.dll -s\", 0, 0);\nShellExecuteA(0, \"open\", \"regsvr32.exe\", \"Filesystem.dll -s\", 0, 0);\n\n```\nAfterwards, it uses `CreateServiceA to add` `svchost.exe as a service named “EYService”,`\nand it will then start the service and exit. This service, as we will explain soon, is the core\ncomponent in the flow and is responsible for processing the commands sent by the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\nNazar’s execution flow\n\n### svchost.exe / EYService\n\nThis service is the main component in the attack, and it orchestrates the entire modules dropped\nand loaded by Nazar. In a sense, the `EYService is only a marionette controlled by a`\npuppeteer that sends commands to it. The communication protocol will be thoroughly explained\nin later parts of this blog post. As commonly seen in RAT-like components, this service mainly\ncontains a list of supported commands, and each of these commands is assigned with a\nfunction to handle it upon a request from the attacker. The full list of commands is listed below.\n\nAs other components in Nazar, this module also does not demonstrate novel techniques or highquality of written code. In fact, this module, like the others, is mostly based on open-source\nlibraries that were commonly available at the time. To manage traffic and sniff packets, Nazar\nuses [Microolap‘s Packet Sniffer SDK. To record the victim’s microphone it uses “Lame” Mp3](https://microolap.com/)\n[encoding library. For keylogging it uses KeyDLL3.](https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/w-p/system/keyboard/article.php/c5699/Hooking-the-Keyboard.htm) [BMGLib is used to take screenshots, and](https://github.com/death-droid/Rice-Video/blob/master/lib/BMGLib/BMGLib_DLL/BMGLibAPI.txt)\n[even for shutting down the computer, it uses an open-source project – The ShutDown Alarm.](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7640/The-ShutDown-Alarm#pre964281)\n\n**Communication**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen analyzing the networking component, the main thing we looked for was the IP of the\ncommand and control, since this could open up new paths, and perhaps recent attacks and\nsamples. Alas, leaving no stone unturned, we could not find such an IP, and it made sense due\nto how Nazar is communicating.\n\nUpon execution of the service, it begins with setting up the packet sniffing. This is done by using\nthe Packet Sniffer SDK, in pretty much a textbook way. The main thread gets an outward-facing\n[network adapter and uses BPF to make sure only UDP packets are forwarded to the handler.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter)\n```\nDWORD __stdcall main_thread(LPVOID lpThreadParameter)\n{\n HANDLE hMgr; // edi\n HANDLE hCfg; // esi\n HANDLE hFtr; // edi\n hMgr = MgrCreate();\n MgrInitialize(hMgr);\n hCfg = MgrGetFirstAdapterCfg(hMgr);\n do\n {\n  if ( !AdpCfgGetAccessibleState(hCfg) )\n   break;\n  hCfg = MgrGetNextAdapterCfg(hMgr, hCfg);\n }\n while ( hCfg );\n ADP_struct = AdpCreate();\n AdpSetConfig(ADP_struct, hCfg);\n if ( !AdpOpenAdapter(ADP_struct) )\n {\n  AdpGetConnectStatus(ADP_struct);\n  MaxPacketSize = AdpCfgGetMaxPacketSize(hCfg);\n  adapter_ip = AdpCfgGetIpA_wrapper(hCfg, 0);\n  AdpCfgGetMACAddress(hCfg, &mac_address, 6);\n  hFtr = BpfCreate();\n  BpfAddCmd(hFtr, BPF_LD_B_ABS, 23u);     // Get Protocol field value\n  BpfAddJmp(hFtr, BPF_JMP_JEQ, IPPROTO_UDP, 0, 1);// Protocol == UDP\n  BpfAddCmd(hFtr, BPF_RET, 0xFFFFFFFF);\n  BpfAddCmd(hFtr, BPF_RET, 0);\n  AdpSetUserFilter(ADP_struct, hFtr);\n  AdpSetUserFilterActive(ADP_struct, 1);\n  AdpSetOnPacketRecv(ADP_struct, on_packet_recv_handler, 0);\n  AdpSetMacFilter(ADP_struct, 2);\n  while ( 1 )\n  {\n   if ( stop_and_ping == 1 )\n   {\n    adapter_ip = AdpCfgGetIpA_wrapper(hCfg, 0);\n    connection_method(2);\n    stop_and_ping = 0;\n   }\n   Sleep(1000u);\n  }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWhenever a UDP packet arrives, its source IP is recorded to be used in the next response,\nwhether or not there will be a response. Then, the packet’s destination port will be checked, and\nin case it is 1234 the UDP data will be forwarded to the command dispatcher.\n```\nint __cdecl commandMethodsWrapper(udp_t *udp_packet, int zero, char *src_ip, int ip_id)\n{\n int length; // edi\n length = HIBYTE(udp_packet->length) - 8;\n ntohs(udp_packet->src_port);\n if ( ntohs(udp_packet->dst_port) != 1234 )\n  return 0;\n commandDispatcher(&udp_packet[1], src_ip, ip_id, length);\n return 1;\n}\n\n```\n**Types of responses**\n\nEach response will have its packet built from scratch, so it could be sent using PSSDK’s send\nmethods : `AdpAsyncSend/AdpSyncSend`\n\nThere are 3 types of responses:\n\nSend an ACK: With destination port `4000 and payload` `101;0000`\nSend computer information: With destination port `4000 and payload` `100;<Computer`\n```\n   Name>;<OS name>\n\n```\nSend a file: The content will be sent as UDP data, followed by another packet with `---`\n```\n   <size_of_file> The UDP destination port will be the little-endian value of the IP\n\n```\nidentification field in the request message. For example, If the server sent a packet (to\ndestination port 1234) with identification `0x3456,the malware will send its response with`\ndestination port `0x5634`\n\nTo make the options clearer, and to demonstrate how Nazar communicates, we have created a\npython script that can “play” the server controlled by the attacker, and communicate with the\nvictim. The script is available in Appendix C.\n\n\n-----\n\nA script we\n\ncreated to demonstrate how the server would communicate with Nazar\n\n**Supported Commands**\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, `svchost.exe, or the service named` `EYService, contains a list of`\nsupported commands. We analyzed two versions of the RAT and found slight differences. The\nentire list of supported commands, in addition to our analysis notes, are presented in the table\nbelow.\n\n**Command**\n**ID** **Description**\n\n311 Enable keylogger by loading the ‘hodll.dll’ library to memory and manually\nimporting the ‘installhook’ function. The keystrokes are saved with the window\nname to ‘report.txt’. The written content is then sent to the server. The keylogger\n[is based on common open-source libraries called “KeyDLL3” (by Anoop](https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/w-p/system/keyboard/article.php/c5699/Hooking-the-Keyboard.htm)\n[Thomas) and “KeyBoard Hooks” (by H. Joseph). Command 312 will disable the](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1264/KeyBoard-Hooks)\nkeylogger.\n\n139 Shutdown the machine. The command is interacting with\nthe `Godown.dll component by spawning it based on its RCLSID and RIID.`\nThe `Godown module was probably based on an open-source implementation`\n[called The ShutDown Alarm.](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7640/The-ShutDown-Alarm#pre964281)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command**\n**ID** **Description**\n\n189 Start screen capturing. The function calls the benign `ViewScreen.dll and`\ninstructs it to save screenshots in a PNG file named `z.png . The file is then`\nsent to the server. The module is based on a known open-source project named\n[“BMGLib“, written by M. Scott Heiman. Command 313 will disable the screen](https://github.com/death-droid/Rice-Video/blob/master/lib/BMGLib/BMGLib_DLL/BMGLibAPI.txt)\ncapturing.\n\n119 Responsible for recording audio using the victim’s Microphone. The recording is\nsaved to `music.mp3 and sent to the server. The implementation is based on`\nan [open-source project which uses a known open source library called “LAME](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15588/Sound-recording-and-encoding-in-MP3-format)\nMP3“. Command 315 will disable the voice recording.\n\n199 List all drives in the PC (C:\\, D:\\, …) and save it to `Drives.txt . The file is then`\nsent to the server. This functionality exists as-is in `Filesystem.dll but the`\nnewer variant of `svchost.exe does not use the DLL, even though it is still`\ndropped to the machine.\n\n200 List all the files and folders in the system and saves it to `Files.txt . The files`\nand folder are separated with `;File; or` `;Folder; . This functionality exists`\nas-is in `Filesystem.dll but the newer variant of` `svchost.exe does not use`\nthe DLL, even though it is still dropped to the machine.\n\n201 Sends file content to the server.\n\n209 Remove a file from the machine.\n\n499 List program by enumerating the keys found in the following registry\npath: `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall . The`\nprogram names are then saved to a file called `Programs.txt and sent to the`\nserver.\n\n599 List all the devices on the machine and save it to a file named ‘Devices.txt’\nwhich is then sent to the server. The devices are separated with either ‘;Root;’ or\n‘;Child;’.\n\n999 Sends `101;0000 back to the server in port` `4000 .`\n\n555 Sends Computer information: `100;Computer Name; OS Name back to the`\nserver in port `4000 .`\n\n315 Disable voice recording.\n\n312 Disable keylogging.\n\n313 Disable screen capturing.\n\n666 Pretty much NOP. Will set a flag that is also set by `119 and` `189 and will be`\nunset when sending a file. However, it is never checked.\n\n211 Registers `Godown.dll using` `regsvr32 This command was included`\nin `svchost.exe versions from 2010 but was then removed, and the module`\nregistration moved to `Distrbute.exe`\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command**\n**ID** **Description**\n\n212 Registers `ViewScreen.dll using` `regsvr32 This command was included`\nin `svchost.exe versions from 2010 but was then removed, and the module`\nregistration moved to `Distrbute.exe`\n\n213 Registers `Filesystem.dll using` `regsvr32 This command was included`\nin `svchost.exe versions from 2010 but was then removed, and the module`\nregistration moved to `Distrbute.exe`\n\n### Godown.dll\n```\nGodown.dll is the DLL which is in the spotlight of SIG37, and the one that started this\n\n```\nmanhunt after the unknown malware. Before it was caught by law-abiding security analysts, one\ncould imagine `Godown.dll to be the mastermind behind this whole operation, the component`\nto control them all, some hidden gem, or an unseen rose. In reality, `Godown.dll is a tiny DLL`\nwith one and only goal – to shut down the computer. Believe us, we tried hard to find any hidden\nor mysterious functionality inside the binary, but nothing was there, except a shutdown\ncommand. The reasons to take 5 lines of C code and place them in a DLL, put it in `Data.bin,`\ndrop it to the disk, register it as a COM DLL using `regsvr32 and then call it indirectly using`\nGUID – are beyond our understanding. But well, it was good enough of a lead to revealing\nNazar, and for that, we should be thankful.\n\n### Filesystem.dll\n\nOut of all the modules used in this attack, `Filesystem.dll might be the only one whose code`\nwas actually written by the attackers themselves. The purpose of this module is to enumerate\ndrives, folders and files on the infected system and write the final results to two text files:\n```\nDrives.txt and Files.txt .\n\n```\nWe were able to get our hands on two versions of this module that were created a year apart,\nboth of which included PDB paths that mentioned a folder with the Persian name Khzer (or\nﺧﻀﺮ):\n```\nC:\\\\khzer\\\\DLLs\\\\DLL's Source\\\\Filesystem\\\\Debug\\\\Filesystem.pdb\nD:\\\\Khzer\\\\Client\\\\DLL's Source\\\\Filesystem\\\\Debug\\\\Filesystem.pdb\n\n```\nUpon closer inspection, there are some differences between the two paths: One starts with the\n```\nC:\\\\ partition while the other starts with D:\\\\, one uses Khzer (uppercase) while the other\n\n```\nuses `khzer (lowercase), and so on. This might indicate that the two versions of the module`\nwere not compiled in the same environment, and is further strengthened by some of the\nincluded headers’ paths, which show that Visual Studio was installed in two different locations:\n\n\n-----\n\nBut these are not the only differences between the two versions: while the `Filesystem.dll`\nmodule was dropped by all the known variants of `gpUpdates.exe, it was not always used in`\nthe same manner.\n\nFor example, versions of `svchost.exe dating back to 2010 have three commands that have`\nsince been omitted: “211”, “212”, and “213”. Those commands allow `svchost.exe to register`\nthe dropped DLL modules using `regsvr32, a functionality that was later migrated to`\n```\nDistribute.exe (as described in the Execution Flow section above).\n\n```\nAn omitted command presented in svchost.exe, as can be seen in Cutter\nThen, when a command is received by the C2 to collect the files and drives on the system, the\nFilesystem.dll module is called after it was registered:\n\nRegistering Filesystem.dll, as can be seen in Cutter\nOn the other hand, a more recent version of svchost.exe that was created in 2012 replicates the\nfile and drive lookup functionalities found in Filesystem.dll when receiving the “199” and “200”\ncommands from the C2, and performs the search itself. Therefore, even though it is still dropped\n\n\n-----\n\nin this case, it appears that the Filesystem.dll module is not used in the newer versions of\nNazar:\n\nThe same functionality presented in both files as can be seen in the disassembly from Cutter\n\n### hodll.dll\n\nThe `hodll.dll module is responsible for recording the user’s keystrokes. It is done, as most`\nkeyloggers do, by setting a Windows hook for keyboard inputs. While there are many\nimplementations of keyloggers available, we believe that this implementation is based on one or\nmore open-source projects. Specifically, we believe that the code was taken from common\n[open-source libraries called “KeyDLL3” (by Anoop Thomas) and “KeyBoard Hooks” (by H.](https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/w-p/system/keyboard/article.php/c5699/Hooking-the-Keyboard.htm)\nJoseph) or by a fork of these projects, as many are available. In fact, the samples of\n```\nhodll.dll we put our hands on, looked like they were built from different layers of open\n\n```\nsource projects. In a way, it looked like someone copied code from the internet, and then\ndeleted it partially, and took other code, and deleted it as well, and so on. The final result\ncontained evolutionary pieces from multiple layers of code.\n\n### ViewScreen.dll\n\n[This DLL is based on a known open-source project named “BMGLib” and it is used to take](https://github.com/death-droid/Rice-Video/blob/master/lib/BMGLib/BMGLib_DLL/BMGLibAPI.txt)\nscreenshots of the victim’s computer. No major changes, if any, were added to the original\nsource, and this is yet another example of how the Nazar malware uses an entire library just for\n\n\n-----\n\na small task.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we tried to gather all the information we learned about Nazar since its recent\nexposure. We dived deep into each and every one of the components and tried to solve as\nmany mysteries as possible. The leaked information by the Shadow Brokers taught us that the\nNSA knew about Nazar for many years, and thanks to other researchers, the community was\nable to strikethrough another unknown malware family from the list of signatures in “TeDi”.\n\nMany of the signatures in “TeDi” described advanced and novel malware families, but this does\nnot appear to be the case with Nazar. As we have shown in the article, the quality of the code,\nas well as the heavy usage of open source libraries, does not match the profile of a shrewd\nthreat actor. And although we tried to cover everything, there are still many unanswered\nquestions surrounding those discoveries: What happened to the Nazar group, did they evolve\ninto other groups that are nowadays known under different names? Are they still active? Are\nthere more samples out there? With those questions and others on our minds, we cannot help\nbut leave this open-ended.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Appendix A: Yara Rules\n\n[In his blog post, Juan published Yara rules to ease detection. The rules are well written and](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanandresgs/YARA/master/apt_ZZ_Sig37_NAZAR.yara)\ncover the different components.
