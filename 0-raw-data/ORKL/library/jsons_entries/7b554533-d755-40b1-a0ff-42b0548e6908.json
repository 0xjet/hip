It is known for stealing sensitive information such as\nbanking details, IP addresses, saved passwords, browser history, login credentials, and\nrecently, known crypto wallets. Being MAAS (Malware As A Service) gives it the ability to\n[constantly develop. We spotted one of the new Variant’s hashes on RedBeard's twitter page.](https://twitter.com/RedBeardIOCs)\n\nFollowing our research on the sample we have got, there is probably a code error. However,\nwe have been able to detect several evasion techniques. There were two technique\ncategories; anti-debugging and anti–emulation.\n\nAnti-debugging techniques are usually used to evade analysis of the file and make the\nanalysis process more difficult. In most cases, anti-debugging techniques will not prevent an\nanalysis but might slow it down significantly. The anti-debugging techniques used in our\nsample are:\n\n[1. The use of IsDebuggerPresent API call – read more here .](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-isdebuggerpresent)\n2. IsDebbugerPresent re-check inside a code by moving a \"large fs:30\" (a PEB block) to\n\nEAX register and checking a second byte.\n3. The sample is packed – which is also a well-known anti-debugging technique.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnti–emulation techniques are also used to prevent analysis, but an analysis by security\nproducts. Security products might be sandboxes or anti-virus emulators. In code emulation,\nthe emulator scans files' behavior, by executing the file in a virtual environment. The\nemulator is similar to sandboxes, but it is not a full-featured sandbox. Our sample uses two\nanti-emulation techniques:\n\n1. Check if the username is \"JohnDoe\" - a user name associated with Windows Defender\n\nEmulator.\n\n1. Check if the computer name “HAL9TH” - a computer name associated with Windows\n\nDefender Emulator.\n\nThreat Actors are always finding a way of evading detection which is why it's crucial for you\nto have an anti-evasion product protecting your environment.
