These three documents were originally\nleaked between March 19 and April 1, 2021, by the Iranian dissident group “Lab\nDookhtegan,” famous for providing highly reputable intelligence on Iranian state-sponsored\ncyber programs.\n\n## Leaked Documents Confirm Second Iranian State-Sponsored Ransomware Operation\n\n\n-----\n\nFlashpoint has validated recently leaked documents that indicate Iran s Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps (IRGC) was operating a state-sponsored ransomware campaign through an\nIranian contracting company called “Emen Net Pasargard” (ENP) (aka “Imannet Pasargad,”\n“Iliant Gostar Iranian,” “Eeleyanet Gostar Iraniyan”). These three documents were originally\nleaked between March 19 and April 1, 2021, by the Iranian dissident group “Lab\nDookhtegan,” famous for providing highly reputable intelligence on Iranian state-sponsored\ncyber programs.\n\n### Documents Shed Light on “Project Signal” Ransomware Operations\n\nENP’s ransomware project dubbed “Project Signal” began sometime between late July 2020\nand early September 2020, when ENP’s internal research organization the “Studies Center”\nbegan investigating unspecified target websites with the goal of “preparing for operations.” A\nleaked internal ENP spreadsheet showed that during this time, the group was researching\nthree to four websites per day and that at the time the spreadsheet was written around\ntwenty sites had been reviewed and analyzed by the Studies Center.\n\nProject Signal was also referenced in another spreadsheet showing that the project had\nbeen assigned to ENP’s “Cyber Directorate,” responsible for carrying out ENP’s offensive\ncyber operations. The transfer of the Signal project from the Studies Center to the Cyber\nDirectorate demonstrated that the ransomware project had progressed from the research\nand planning phase to the operational phase. In the spreadsheet, the word “ransom” was\nlisted as the goal for the Signal project and the project was slated to take place between\nOctober 18 to 21, 2020, with a listed completion date of October 21, 2020.\n\n### Figure 1: Copy of Project Signal’s Leaked Ransomware Workflow\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusive Proof of ENP Involvement in Project Signal Ransomware\n\nThe newly leaked documents reveal that ENP had launched a ransomware operation in late\nOctober 2020. According to Lab Dookhtegan, ENP operates on behalf of Iran’s intelligence\nservices providing cyber capabilities and support to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\n(IRGC), the IRGC Quds Force (IRGC-QF), and Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security\n(MOIS). The documents also act as further evidence of prior Lab Dookhtegan allegations\nthat ENP is closely affiliated with an unspecified IRGC cyber unit, both operating out of the\nsame building and certain ENP employees holding dual positions and, in fact, primarily\nserving this IRGC cyber unit.\n\n### ENP’s Close Ties to Iranian State and the IRGC Beyond Question\n\nIn another undated ENP document leaked by Lab Dookhtegan, details of Project\nSignal outlined the intricate operational processes, workflows, and best practices to\nsuccessfully conducting this ransomware campaign. Based on this information, Flashpoint\nassesses with a high degree of confidence that ENP was involved in Project Signal\nransomware operations, and was almost certainly acting on behalf of the Iranian state and\nthe IRGC.\n\n[Learn more about Flashpoint Threat Readiness and Response offerings and how](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/threat-response-and-readiness/)\nFlashpoint prepares and actively supports organizations to respond to any ransomware\nattack.\n\n## Financial Motivations: Real or More Subterfuge?\n\nThe ransomware workflow for Project Signal included steps that suggest financial gain were\nat least part of the group’s motivations. The first indication is that the workflow includes steps\nfor receiving Bitcoin payments from ransomware victims. Second, decryption steps were also\nincluded, with a “thumbs up” symbol placed next to the word “decryption.” Based on these\ntwo factors—that ENP was likely accepting victim Bitcoin payments and following through to\ndecrypt victim accounts upon payment—it appears that, at least on the surface, ENP’s\nProject Signal ransomware operation was financially motivated.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s an alternative, equally-plausible explanation in which the\nappearance of financial motivation was the group’s intention for incorporating these financial\npayment steps with goal being to mimic the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of\nother financially-motivated cybercriminal ransomware groups. Particularly in this instance,\nwith the Project Signal ransomware operation conducted by a well-organized, Iranian statesponsored group, the inclusion of cryptocurrency payment and decryption steps as further\nsubterfuge techniques are arguably more conceivable than an Iranian state-sponsored group\nseeking relatively negligible financial returns.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Iran s Track Record of Financial Motivation Misdirection Further Suggests Subterfuge in Play\n\nIran has a history of attempting to use cybercriminal TTPs to blend in with non-statesponsored malicious cyber activity to avoid attribution and maintain plausible deniability. It’s\nlargely assumed that Iran has been behind multiple destructive and disruptive attacks in\nrecent years; most notably the 2012 Shamoon attacks against Saudi Aramco and the 2012\nOperational Ababil DDoS attacks against US financial institutions.\n\nOther Iranian APT groups use similar techniques to blend in with the cybercriminal threat\n[landscape. For example, APT33 is known to use publicly available remote access trojans](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\n(RATs) like Nanocore to blend in with normal cybercriminal activity and avoid the attribution\nwhich typically comes from the implementation of custom malware.\n\n## Timing with Iranian “Pay2Key” Ransomware May Not Be Coincidence\n\nThe timing of ENP’s Project Signal also coincided with the Iranian ransomware campaign,\n“Pay2Key,” that began exclusively targeting Israeli companies across a broad array of\nverticals in December 2020. Similarly to ENP’s Project Signal, Pay2Key includes financially\nmotivated characteristics in its operational workflow. As of April 30, 2021 at the time of\npublishing this blog post, Flashpoint is aware of six Israeli firms that had leaked internal\ndocuments due to Pay2Key ransomware. However, it’s been reported that Pay2Key has\n[infected at least eighty Israeli companies with their ransomware.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-iranian-hackers-hit-over-80-israeli-firms-as-massive-cyberattack-continues-1.9375486)\n\nAs is true for ENP’s Project Signal, if Pay2Key is sponsored by Iran, it’s possible the\nappearance of financial motivation could have been an obfuscation technique designed to\nmimic a cybercriminal group. At this point in time, Flashpoint can neither confirm any\nattributes of Project Signal targets nor if there is any link between ENP’s Project Signal and\nPay2Key.\n\n—\n_*May 2, 2021, 9:56 PM EDT: Flashpoint removed extraneous references to MuddyWater and_\n_Operation Quicksand._\n\n## Learn More About Flashpoint Ransomware Readiness Response\n\n**[Request a demo today and see firsthand how Flashpoint’s](https://go.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/request-a-demo/)** Threat Readiness and\nResponse offerings ensure your entire team is prepped and able to respond to any\nransomware attack.
