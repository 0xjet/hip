Two widely reported attacks related to\n[Netwalker are the ones on the Toll Group and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomware-strain-halts-toll-group-deliveries/) [Champaign Urbana Public Health District](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/12/ransomware_illinois_health/)\n(CHUPD) in Illinois.\n\nThe new Netwalker phishing campaign is using an attachment named\n[\"CORONAVIRUS_COVID-19.vbs\" that contains an embedded Netwalker Ransomware](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9f9027b5db5c408ee43ef2a7c7dd1aecbdb244ef6b16d9aafb599e8c40368967/detection)\nexecutable and obfuscated code to extract and launch it on the computer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**VBS Attachment**\nWhen the script is executed, the executable will be saved to %Temp%\\qeSw.exe and\nlaunched.\n\n**Netwalker Executable**\nOnce executed, the ransomware will encrypt the files on the computer and append a\nrandom extension to encrypted file names.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez, the research division of SentinelOne, told](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nBleepingComputer that this version of the ransomware specifically avoids terminating the\nFortinet endpoint protection client.\n\nWhen asked why they would do that, Kremez stated it may be to avoid detection.\n\n\"I suppose it might be because they have already disabled the anti-virus functionality\ndirectly from the customer admin panel; however, they do not want to trip an alarm by\nterminating the clients,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\nWhen done, victims will find a ransom note named [extension]-Readme.txt that contains\ninstructions on how to access the ransomware's Tor payment site to pay the ransom\ndemand.\n\n**Netwalker Ransom Note**\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no known weakness in the ransomware that would allow\nvictims to decrypt their files for free.\n\nInstead, victims will need to either restore from backup or recreate the missing files.\n\n## Coronavirus attacks have become common\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, threat actors have actively started using the\n[outbreak as a theme for their phishing campaigns and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coronavirus-phishing-attacks-are-actively-targeting-the-us/) [malware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/as-coronavirus-spreads-so-does-covid-19-themed-malware/)\n\n[We have seen the TrickBot trojan using text from Coronavirus related news stories to evade](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-malware-targets-italy-in-fake-who-coronavirus-emails/)\n[detection, a ransomware called CoronaVirus, the data-stealing FormBook malware spread](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-coronavirus-ransomware-acts-as-cover-for-kpot-infostealer/)\nthrough phishing campaigns, and even an email extortion campaign threatening to infect\nyour family with Coronavirus.\n\nThis has led to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue\n[warnings about the rise of Coronavirus-themed scams and the World Health Organization](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/world-health-organization-warns-of-coronavirus-phishing-attacks/)\n[(WHO) to release warnings of phishing scams impersonating their organization.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/world-health-organization-warns-of-coronavirus-phishing-attacks/)\n\nAs threat actors commonly take advantage of topics that spread anxiety and fear, everyone\nmust be more diligent than ever against suspicious emails and the promotion of programs\nfrom unknown sources.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Intuit warns of QuickBooks phishing threatening to suspend accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intuit-warns-of-quickbooks-phishing-threatening-to-suspend-accounts/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Coronavirus](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/coronavirus/)\n[COVID-19](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/covid-19/)\n[Netwalker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/netwalker/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
