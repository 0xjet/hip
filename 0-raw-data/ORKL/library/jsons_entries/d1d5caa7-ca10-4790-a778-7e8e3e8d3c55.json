    "plain_text": "# Massive data leak reveals Israeli NSO Group’s spyware used to target activists, journalists, and political leaders globally\n\n**[amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/)**\n\nJuly 18, 2021\n\nJuly 19, 2021\nNSO Group’s spyware has been used to facilitate human rights violations around the world\non a massive scale, according to a major investigation into the leak of 50,000 phone\nnumbers of potential surveillance targets. These include heads of state, activists and\njournalists, including Jamal Khashoggi’s family.\n\nThe Pegasus Project lays bare how NSO’s spyware is a weapon of choice for\nrepressive governments seeking to silence journalists, attack activists and crush\ndissent, placing countless lives in peril.\n\n_Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International._\n\nThe Pegasus Project is a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17\n[media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media](https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-pegasus-project/)\nnon-profit, with the technical support of Amnesty International, who conducted cutting- edge\nforensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of the spyware.\n\n“The Pegasus Project lays bare how NSO’s spyware is a weapon of choice for repressive\ngovernments seeking to silence journalists, attack activists and crush dissent, placing\ncountless lives in peril,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International.\n\n“These revelations blow apart any claims by NSO that such attacks are rare and down to\nrogue use of their technology. While the company claims its spyware is only used for\nlegitimate criminal and terror investigations, it’s clear its technology facilitates systemic\nabuse. They paint a picture of legitimacy, while profiting from widespread human rights\nviolations.”\n\n“Clearly, their actions pose larger questions about the wholesale lack of regulation that has\ncreated a wild west of rampant abusive targeting of activists and journalists. Until this\ncompany and the industry as a whole can show it is capable of respecting human rights,\nthere must be an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer and use of surveillance\ntechnology.”\n\nIn a written response to Forbidden Stories and its media partners, NSO Group said it “firmly\ndenies… false claims” in the report. It wrote that the consortium’s reporting was based on\n“wrong assumptions” and “uncorroborated theories” and reiterated that the company was on\n\n\n-----\n\n[a life-saving mission . A fuller summary of NSO Group s response is available here.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments)\n\n## The Investigation\n\nAt the centre of this investigation is NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware which, when\nsurreptitiously installed on victims’ phones, allows an attacker complete access to the\ndevice’s messages, emails, media, microphone, camera, calls and contacts.\n\nOver the next week, media partners of The Pegasus Project – including The Guardian, Le\nMonde, Süddeutsche Zeitung and The Washington Post – will run a series of stories\nexposing details of how world leaders, politicians, human rights activists, and journalists\nhave been selected as potential targets of this spyware.\n\nFrom the leaked data and their investigations, Forbidden Stories and its media partners\nidentified potential NSO clients in 11 countries: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India,\nKazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE).\n\nNSO Group has not taken adequate action to stop the use of its tools for unlawful targeted\nsurveillance of activists and journalists, despite the fact that it either knew, or arguably ought\nto have known, that this was taking place.\n\nThe Pegasus Project revelations must act as a catalyst for change. The surveillance\nindustry must no longer be afforded a laissez-faire approach from governments with a\nvested interest in using this technology to commit human rights violations.\n\n_Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International_\n\n“As a first step, NSO Group must immediately shut down clients’ systems where there is\ncredible evidence of misuse. The Pegasus Project provides this in abundance,” said Agnès\nCallamard.\n\n## Khashoggi family targeted\n\nDuring the investigation, evidence has also emerged that family members of Saudi journalist\nJamal Khashoggi were targeted with Pegasus software before and after his murder in\nIstanbul on 2 October 2018 by Saudi operatives, despite repeated denials from NSO Group.\n\nAmnesty International’s [Security Lab established that Pegasus spyware was successfully](https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/)\ninstalled on the phone of Khashoggi’s fiancée Hatice Cengiz just four days after his murder.\n\nHis wife, Hanan Elatr was also repeatedly targeted with the spyware between September\n2017 and April 2018 as well as his son, Abdullah, who was also selected as a target along\nwith other family members in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a statement, the NSO Group responded to the Pegasus Project allegations saying that its\n“technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi”.\nThe company said that it “previously investigated this claim, immediately after the heinous\nmurder, which again, is being made without validation”.\n\n**Journalists under attack**\n\nThe investigation has so far identified at least 180 journalists in 20 countries who were\nselected for potential targeting with NSO spyware between 2016 to June 2021, including in\nAzerbaijan, Hungary, India and Morocco, countries where crackdowns against independent\nmedia have intensified.\n\nThe revelations show the real-world harm caused by unlawful surveillance:\n\nIn Mexico, journalist Cecilio Pineda’s phone was selected for targeting just weeks\nbefore his killing in 2017. The Pegasus Project identified at least 25 Mexican journalists\nwere selected for targeting over a two-year period. NSO has denied that even if\nPineda’s phone had been targeted, data collected from his phone contributed to his\ndeath.\nPegasus has been used in Azerbaijan, a country where only a few independent media\noutlets remain. More than 40 Azerbaijani journalists were selected as potential targets\naccording to the investigation. Amnesty International’s Security Lab found the phone of\nSevinc Vaqifqizi, a freelance journalist for independent media outlet Meydan TV, was\ninfected over a two-year period until May 2021.\nIn India, at least 40 journalists from nearly every major media outlet in the country were\nselected as potential targets between 2017-2021. Forensic tests revealed the phones\nof Siddharth Varadarajan and MK Venu, co-founders of independent online outlet The\nWire, were infected with Pegasus spyware as recently as June 2021.\nThe investigation also identified journalists working for major international media\nincluding the Associated Press, CNN, The New York Times and Reuters as potential\ntargets. One of the highest profile journalists was Roula Khalaf, the editor of the\nFinancial Times.\n\n“The number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how Pegasus is used as a\ntool to intimidate critical media. It is about controlling public narrative, resisting scrutiny, and\nsuppressing any dissenting voice,” said Agnès Callamard.\n\n“These revelations must act as a catalyst for change. The surveillance industry must no\nlonger be afforded a laissez-faire approach from governments with a vested interest in using\nthis technology to commit human rights violations.”\n\n**Exposing Pegasus infrastructure**\n\n[Amnesty International is today releasing the full technical details of its Security Lab’s in-](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\ndepth forensic investigations as part of the Pegasus Project\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Lab s methodology report documents the evolution of Pegasus spyware attacks since\n2018, with details on the spyware’s infrastructure, including more than 700 Pegasus-related\ndomains.\n\n“NSO claims its spyware is undetectable and only used for legitimate criminal investigations.\nWe have now provided irrefutable evidence of this ludicrous falsehood,” said Etienne\nMaynier, a technologist at Amnesty International’s Security Lab.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that NSO’s customers did not also use Pegasus in terrorism and\ncrime investigations, and the Forbidden Stories consortium also found numbers in the data\nbelonging to suspected criminals.\n\n“The widespread violations Pegasus facilitates must stop. Our hope is the damning evidence\npublished over the next week will lead governments to overhaul a surveillance industry that\nis out of control,” said Etienne Maynier.\n\nIn response to a request for comment by media organizations involved in the Pegasus\nProject, NSO Group said it “firmly denies” the claims and stated that “many of them are\nuncorroborated theories which raise serious doubts about the reliability of your sources, as\nwell as the basis of your story.” NSO Group did not confirm or deny which governments are\nNSO Group’s customers, although it said that the Pegasus Project had made “incorrect\nassumptions” in this regard. Notwithstanding its general denial of the claims, NSO Group\nsaid it “will continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action\nbased on the results of these investigations”.\n\n## Topics\n\n[Press Release](https://www.amnesty.org/en/resource-type/press-release/)\n\n\n-----",
