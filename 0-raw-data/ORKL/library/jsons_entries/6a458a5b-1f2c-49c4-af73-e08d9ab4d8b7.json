It will also add a Microsoft Defender exclusion to\nensure that its installation directory is never scanned and hides its binary in Window Explorer\nusing the hidden attribute.\n\nKraken has a limited and simplistic feature set, allowing attackers to download and execute\nadditional malicious payloads on compromised devices, including the RedLine Stealer\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[RedLine is currently the most widely deployed information stealer capable of harvesting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/2easy-now-a-significant-dark-web-marketplace-for-stolen-data/)\nvictims' passwords, browser cookies, credit card info, and cryptocurrency wallet info.\n\n\"Monitoring commands sent to Kraken victims from October 2021 through December 2021\nrevealed that the operator had focused entirely on pushing information stealers – specifically\nRedLine Stealer,\" ZeroFox said.\n\n\"It is currently unknown what the operator intends to do with the stolen credentials that have\nbeen collected or what the end goal is for creating this new botnet.\"\n\n## Built-in crypto wallet theft capabilities\n\nHowever, the botnet also features built-in information theft capabilities and can also steal\ncrypto wallets before dropping other info stealers and cryptocurrency miners.\n\nAccording to ZeroFox, Kraken can steal info from Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Electrum,\nEthereum, Exodus, Guarda, Atomic, and Jaxx Liberty crypto wallets.\n\nBased on info collected from the Ethermine cryptocurrency mining pool, this botnet seems to\nbe adding roughly USD 3,000 every month to its masters' wallets.\n\n\"While in development, Kraken C2s seem to disappear often. ZeroFox has observed\ndwindling activity for a server on multiple occasions, only for another to appear a short time\n[later using either a new port or a completely new IP,\" the researchers added.](https://www.zerofox.com/blog/meet-kraken-a-new-golang-botnet-in-development/)\n\nNevertheless, \"by using SmokeLoader to spread, Kraken quickly gains hundreds of new bots\neach time the operator changes the C2.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[Qbot malware switches to new Windows Installer infection vector](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-malware-switches-to-new-windows-installer-infection-vector/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n\n-----",
