These attacks combine the classic ransomware attack with a\nleakware attack. In a classic ransomware attack, the victim’s data is encrypted and is only\ndecrypted back after the victim pays a ransom fee to the ransomware operators. In a\nleakware attack, the data is stolen, and the victim is blackmailed with the data being\npublished publicly unless he pays a certain fee. In a leakware/ransomware hybrid attack, the\ndata is first stolen, then encrypted. Then the victim is first asked to pay the ransom for\ndecryption. If the victim declines to pay the ransom, the attackers threaten him to release the\nstolen data publicly. In some cases, business partners and/or customers of the victim are\nalso contacted and informed of the impending data release to put even more pressure on the\nvictim.\n\nIn this article we outline how these leakware/ransomware hybrid attacks work, how they differ\nfrom classic ransomware attacks, and how you can protect yourself against them.\n\n## Background: What is Ransomware?\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the rise of crypto currencies, ransomware has become popular for cybercriminals. While\nransomware existed before crypto currencies, the logistics of the ransom transfer were\ngreatly simplified by crypto currencies.\n\nAccording to ID Ransomware, a free service to identify ransomware, there exist 928 different\npieces of ransomware .1\n\nRansomware is often distributed and deployed by other malware. A popular attack vector is\nemail. A typical infection chain of a ransomware attack is the following:\n\nActors behind ransomware are financially motivated. Their ransomware encrypts the victim’s\ndata. The attackers will only decrypt the data if the victim pays a ransom.\n\n\nRansom demands can range from a few hundred Euro for decrypting a single computer, over\nseveral thousand for computers of a small business, up to millions for large corporations\nand/or government entities. The largest publicly known ransom to ever be paid amounted to\n$4.5M. It was paid by the U.S. travel management company CWT .2\n\n\n-----\n\n### Classic Ransomware\n\nThe interaction and information flow of a classical ransomware case is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### New Leakware/Ransomware Hybrid\n\nSince December 2019, actors behind the Maze ransomware operation began combining a\nprevious attack known as leakware with ransomware.\n\nIn a leakware attack, data of the victim is stolen, and the attackers threaten to publish the\ndata if the victim does not pay a ransom. Leakware is therefore the opposite to ransomware.\nInstead of denying the victim access to the data, access to the data is granted to everyone in\ncase the victim does not pay.\n\nThis new leakware/ransomware hybrid scheme combines both leakware and ransomware.\nTo this end, before encrypting the victim’s data via ransomware, the data is exfiltrated to the\nransomware operators, who then threaten to publish the data if the victim refuses to pay the\nransom.\n\nIn addition, some ransomware operators will contact the victim’s business partners or\ncustomers, whose data is often among the data to be published. The operators behind the\nClop ransomware are notorious for doing this. This is used to further increase pressure on\nthe victim to pay the ransom.\n\nThe interaction and information flow of the new leakware/ransomware hybrid is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe problem for the victims is that, even if they pay the ransom, there is no guarantee the\nleaked data will be deleted – only the promise of criminals. The leaked data could be sold in\nthe underground economy, used in future attacks, and even used to extort the same victim\nagain with the same data at a later point in time.\n\n## Clop Ransomware as Example\n\nUsing the Clop ransomware as an example, we outline how a leakware/ransomware hybrid\nattack unfolds.\n\nThe Clop ransomware is operated by a threat actor commonly referred to as TA505.\nHornetsecurity has reported on these activities previously .3 Initial access takes place via a\nmalicious email. TA505 does big-game hunting, i.e., they specifically target large\ncorporations with high revenues. If a recipient opens the email and follows the instructions,\nwhich in most cases involve downloading a malicious document and allowing the document\nto execute macros, the recipient becomes a victim. The macro code in the document then\ndownloads a remote administration trojan (RAT). This RAT gives the attackers remote\naccess to the victim’s computer. The RAT is then used to move laterally within the victim’s\ncompany network and gather additional information. In addition, other tools (such as those\nfrom the Cobalt Strike framework) are often deployed to obtain domain admin rights.\nValuable data is then exfiltrated. From victim data which was published in the past, we know\nthat this data usually contains the complete shared drives of the infected company.\nEventually, the Clop ransomware is deployed company-wide to encrypt and incapacitate as\nmany systems as possible so the disruption to the company is maximized.\n\nThen, the operators of the Clop ransomware send the victim to a ransom note website\nhosted via a Tor hidden service. This ransom note website includes details on the ransom\nand how to pay it.\n\n\n-----\n\nDepending on the company size and estimated revenue, the demanded ransom is often in\nthe millions. Again, TA505 does big-game hunting, i.e., they will only target large\ncorporations with high revenues. The ransom note website also features a timer and a threat\nthat if the ransom is not paid in time, the price will be doubled.\n\nTo proof to the victim that files can be decrypted, the ransom note site also offers a “Trial\nDecryption”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransom note site also features a support chat. Those chats are often used to negotiate\nthe ransom, payment rates or deadline extensions.\n\nIf a victim refuses to pay or does not enter negotiations, the ransomware operators start\nsending out mass-email notifications to the victim’s business partners and/or customers.\nHere is one example of such a notification email sent out by the Clop ransomware operators:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attached `list.txt file contains a list of the Windows domains and their corresponding`\nnetwork shares from which the Clop ransomware operators have exfiltrated data. The links in\nthe notification email point to the subpage on the Clop’s leak site where the stolen data is\nshared.\n\nThe Clop ransomware leak site is titled “CL0P^_- LEAKS”. It currently lists 13 victims. Here is\nan example of a leaked data view:\n\n## List of Leak Sites\n\nCurrently, there exist leak sites for 13 different ransomware operations. The distribution of\nvictims among each leak site can be seen in the following plot:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Maze\n\nWith 220 victims, the leak site of the Maze ransomware is the one with highest number of\nvictims. Apparently, the operators behind the Maze ransomware have so many potential\nvictims that they have formed the so-called Maze Cartel, in which the help other ransomware\noperations for a share of the profits.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the Maze leak site is among the leak sites that are also acessible via the clear\nweb and not just via a hidden service.\n\n### REvil / Sodinokibi\n\nThe second most dominant ransomware with a leak site is REvil. Their site, called “Happy\nBlog”, contains data from 67 victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn June 2020, the actors behind the REvil ransomware also started to “auction” stolen data:\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the auction site doesn t contain any information on how to bid. It is likely just\nanother mechanism to gain media attention and scare companies into paying the attackers.\n\n### DoppelPaymer\n\nWith data from 59 victims, the “Doppel leaks” leak site of the DoppelPaymer ransomware\ncomes in on third place.\n\nThe site is also accessible via a clear web domain.\n\n### Conti\n\nThe “Conti News” leak site of the new Conti ransomware already has data from 43 victims.\nFrom all current available information, the Conti ransomware seems to be the successor to\nthe notorious Ryuk ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe site is also accessible via a clear web domain.\n\nAfter Maze, Conti is currently the ransomware with the fastest growing victim count,\nsometimes increasing in up to 10 new victims per day. Here, it is worth noticing that only\nvictims who refuse to pay the ransom are published on the leak sites.\n\n### NetWalker\n\nData from 37 victims of the NetWalker ransomware has been published on their leak site\ntitled “NetWalker Blog”.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mespinoza / Pysa\n\nThe Mespinoza ransomware, also known as Pysa, has titled their leak site “Pysa’s Partners”.\nIt features data from 28 victims.\n\n### Nephilim\n\nThe leak site of the Nephilim ransomware, called “Corporate Leaks”, contains data from 16\nvictims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### RagnarLocker\n\nThe leak site of the RagnarLocker ransomware is titled “RAGNAR LEAKS NEWS”. It\nfeatures data from 14 victims.\n\n### SunCrypt\n\nThe leak site of the SunCrypt ransomware is simply titled “News”. However, researchers\nwere able to contact the operators of the site and confirm that the leak site is associated with\nthe SunCrypt ransomware. The leak site features data from 9 victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sekhmet\n\nThe Sekhmet ransomware leak site, titled “Sekhmet Leaks.” is only available via a clear web\naddress. It currently features data from 8 victims.\n\n### Avaddon\n\nIn the first Avaddon campaign observed by Hornetsecurity,4 no data was exfiltrated. The\ncampaign distributed Avaddon via the Phorpiex botnet, and the encryption of the victims was\nfully automated. The campaign was hence not targeted at high-value victims for which a leak\nwould be worthwhile. However, Avaddon has since been used in different campaigns and\ntheir leak site, titled “Avaddon Info”, has currently data from 4 victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Darkside\n\nA very recent leak site is the “Darkside” leak site of the Darkside ransomware. It has data\nfrom 2 victims.\n\n### MedusaLocker / AKO\n\nThe MedusaLocker ransomware also had a leak site, which at one point featured data from 7\nvictims.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, currently the site only contains a “coming soon” message without any published\ncontents of victims. It seems the site is currently being restructured.\n\n### Nemty\n\nThe Nemty ransomware also used to have a leak site. The site was also reachable via a\nclear web domain. However, the site is currently not reachable anymore.\n\n### ProLock\n\nHornetsecurity previously has analyzed the ProLock ransomware, which also claims to “have\ngathered […] sensitive data” and “would share it in case [the victims] refuse to pay” .5\nHowever, no ProLock leak site has appeared yet.\n\n## Conclusion and Remediation\n\nThe new leakware/ransomware hybrid attacks make malware infections more dangerous to\nbusinesses than ever before. While good backups helped against classic ransomware\nattacks, they do not provide any protection against private and/or confidential data being\nforcefully leaked to the public. The broad announcement of the data leak to business\npartners and customers will cause further damages and loss of reputation to victims as\nbusiness partners and customers, but also competitors get unlimited access to internal\ndocuments, such as contracts, pricing, research and development findings, etc.\n\nIn general, the only protection against these leakware/ransomware hybrid attacks is to invest\nin effective IT security. With regards to email, Hornetsecurity’s [Spam Protection Service and](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\nHornetsecurity’s [Advanced Threat Protection protect against leakware/ransomware hybrid](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/advanced-threat-protection/)\nattacks using email as their initial infection vector in the same way they protect against\n\n\n-----\n\nclassic ransomware attacks using this access vector: by fending off these attacks at the very\nbeginning of the attack chain before the attackers can even obtain initial access to your\nsystems.\n\n## References\n\n### Further information:\n\nMore about [Ransomware on the Hornetsecurity Knowledgebase.](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/knowledge-base/ransomware/)\n\n\n-----",
