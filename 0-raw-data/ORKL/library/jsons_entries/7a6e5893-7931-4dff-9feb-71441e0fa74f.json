On February 26, the\nuser posted Kasimov’s full name, his date of birth, and his address alongside an Englishlanguage threat: “We are already in the city, there is nowhere to run. You had a chance.”\n\nSpeaking to The Record on Tuesday, Kasimov described the threat as incidental —\noccurring solely within the early days of the full-blown invasion without any follow-up since —\nand noted that the user has not been active since February 26.\n\n[Kasimov, who does network IoC detections for the maltrail project, is continuing to share a](https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail)\nrange of domains related to Gamaredon, and is uploading samples to VirusTotal.\n\nResponding to a question about how his details might have been obtained, Kasimov said: “I\nsuspect, that, if someone wants to get something, he will get it on some day… Perhaps,\nsome citizens database was leaked some year ago…”\n\nIn the days before the full-blown invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent a letter to the\nU.N. warning that the Russian Federation had drawn up lists of Ukrainians who would be\ntargeted either for assassination or imprisonment during what the Russians expected to be\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir occupation of the country.\n\n“It is always unpleasant, when someone tries to threat your life anyway… Fortunately, I’m still\nalive and healthy,” Kasimov said, adding that he had “fortunately” not received any other\nthreats against his life since the posts by Anton.\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[FSB](https://therecord.media/tag/fsb/)\n[Gamaredon](https://therecord.media/tag/gamaredon/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[petroleum](https://therecord.media/tag/petroleum/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n\nAlexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.
