    "plain_text": "# PC Users Threatened by Conficker Worm and new Internet-browser Modifier\n\n**[eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/announcements/press-threatsense-report-july-2009/](https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/announcements/press-threatsense-report-july-2009/)**\n\n05 Aug 2009\n\n05 Aug 2009\n\nConficker most widespread in Eastern Europe\nNew Threat, Win32/FlyStudio most widespread in China\nHigh share of threats exploiting MS Windows autorun.inf function\n\nFor the month of July, ESET’s statistical threat evaluation system - ThreatSense.Net has\n[evaluated the variant of Win32/Conficker worm as the single most widespread form of](http://www.eset.eu/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=24162)\nmalware with a share of 10.67% globally. Other forms of malware still spreading on a mass\n[scale include the types such INF/Autorun, exploiting the MS Windows autorun.inf function.](http://www.eset.eu/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=22736)\nTheir share of 8.39% places them second on ESET‘s threat list. Third place (7.92%) went to\na family of [Win32/PSW.OnLineGames Trojans and their variants especially targeting online](http://www.eset.eu/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=21956)\ngamers.\n\nWin32/Agent designed to steal information from PCs placed fourth with 2.59%. The\nnewcomer - Win32/FlyStudio closes the top 5 list with 2.38% share of threats detected. The\nWin32/FlyStudio threat is designed to modify information inside the victim's Internet\nbrowser. This threat will modify search queries, with the intention of delivering\nadvertisements to the user. Win32/FlyStudio uses a scripting language popular among\nmalware writers and ranks among the most widespread threats China. USA, Mexico and\nArgentina are also among countries with high occurrence rates of this type of malware.\n\n**Global Threats as tabulated by ESET ThreatSense.Net® (July 2009)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA (EMEA)**\n\nConficker remains top threat in Easter Europe, on rise in UK and Italy. For the month of\nJuly, Slovakia and the Czech Republic remain among regional exceptions where\nWin32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AA is the most widespread threat, with a share of 5.89%\nand 6.48%, respectively. This kind of malware has the capability to copy itself into the\nsystem files and executing itself with every boot-up. At the same time, it establishes\ncommunication with a remote server via HTTP protocol. In other words, when this trojan\nhorse is in the PC system, its only mission is downloading additional malware – especially\nadware, spyware or other threats out from different servers and places on the internet.\n\nAlso afflicting other European countries, Win32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AA ranks lower\nto Win32/Conficker that remains top threat in Ukraine (32.55%); Russia (23.02%); Bulgaria\nand Lithuania (15.43%); Romania (15.4%); South Africa (12.22%); Italy (10.4%); Great\nBritain (7.97%); Austria (5.31%), and Germany (4.46%).\n\nFor the month of July, Poland and France were dominated by a mixture of Trojans of the\nWin32/PSW.OnLineGames family targeting the virtual identities of online gamers. The\nshare of intercepted infiltrations of this type of threat reached 14.12% in Poland and 11.23%\nin France.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs far as the region of Northern Europe is concerned, it is dominated by an array of\nmalware grouped under the WMA/TrojanDownloader.GetCodec category. The same applies\nfor the countries of Benelux. These Trojans are engineered to go through all the digital\nmusic files, modifying their format in such a way that upon execution, a malicious content is\ndownloaded from a pre-defined web-site. The share of occurrence of this form of malware\nhas reached 4.01% in Sweden, 12.66% in Norway; 12.46% in Estonia and 15.53% in\nBelgium.\n\nINF/Autorun remains a top threat in the United Arab Emirates (9.55%) and Israel (4.64%).\n\n**About ESET**\n\nFounded in 1992, ESET is a global provider of security solutions for corporate customers\nand households. From a small family-sized venture, ESET has evolved into a leader in\nproactive malware detection and is in the front lines of combating emerging cyberthreats.
