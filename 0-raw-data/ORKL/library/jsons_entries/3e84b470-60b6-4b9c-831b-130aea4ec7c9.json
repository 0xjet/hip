Stores of\ngasoline, diesel, home heating oil, jet fuel, and military supplies had been so heavily affected\n[that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) declared a state of emergency](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/emergency/esc-ssc-wsc-regional-emergency-declaration-2021-002-05-09-2021)\nin 18 states to help with the shortages.\n\nIt has been five days since the shutdown prompted by the attack, but Colonial Pipeline is still\nunable to resume full operations. Outages have already started affecting motorists. In metro\nAtlanta, 30% of gas stations are without gasoline, and other cities are reporting similar\nnumbers. To keep supplies intact for essential services, the US government has issued\n[advisories against hoarding.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/11/us-colonial-pipeline-hack-gas-panic-buying)\n\nThe FBI has confirmed that DarkSide, a cybercriminal group believed to have originated in\nEastern Europe, is behind the attack. The ransomware used by the group is a relatively new\nfamily that was first spotted in August 2020, but the group draws on experience from\nprevious financially successful cybercrime enterprises.\n\nApart from locking Colonial Pipeline’s computer systems, [DarkSide also](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.DARKSIDE.FAIO) stole over 100 GB of\ncorporate data. This data theft is all the more relevant in light of the fact that the group has a\nhistory of doubly extorting its victims — not only asking for money to unlock the affected\ncomputers and demanding payment for the captured data, but also threatening to leak the\nstolen data if the victims do not pay. As we will cover later, DarkSide shows a level of\ninnovation that sets it apart from its competition, being one of the first to offer what we call\n“quadruple extortion services.”\n\n[The group announced on May 12 that it had three more victims: a construction company](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/darkside-hacker-group-behind-pipeline-attack-claims-three-new-victims.html)\nbased in Scotland, a renewable energy product reseller in Brazil, and a technology services\nreseller in the US. The DarkSide actors claimed to have stolen a total of 1.9 GB of data from\nthese companies, including sensitive information such as client data, financial data,\nemployee passports, and contracts.\n\n[Since Darkside is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), it is possible that three different](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-as-a-service-ransomware-operators-find-ways-to-bring-in-business)\naffiliate groups are behind these three attacks. Even the DarkSide actors themselves admit\nthat they just buy access to company networks — they have no idea how access was\n\n\n-----\n\nacquired.\n\nTrend Micro Research found dozens of DarkSide ransomware samples in the wild and\ninvestigated how the ransomware group operates and what organizations it typically targets.\n\nThe DarkSide ransomware\n\nDarkSide offers its RaaS to affiliates for a percentage of the profits. The group presents a\nprime example of modern ransomware, operating with a more advanced business model.\nModern ransomware identifies high-value targets and involves more precise monetization of\ncompromised assets (with double extortion as an example). Modern ransomware attacks are\nalso typically done by several groups who collaborate and split profits. These attacks may\n[look more like advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks than traditional ransomware](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/advanced-persistent-threat)\nevents.\n\nHere is a short timeline of DarkSide activity compiled from publicly available reports:\n\nAugust 2020: DarkSide introduces its ransomware.\nOctober 2020: DarkSide donates US$20,000 stolen from victims to charity.\nNovember 2020: DarkSide establishes its RaaS model. The group invites other\ncriminals to use its service. A DarkSide data leak site is later discovered.\nNovember 2020: DarkSide launches its content delivery network (CDN) for storing and\ndelivering compromised data.\nDecember 2020: A DarkSide actor invites media outlets and data recovery\norganizations to follow the group’s [press center on the public leak site.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1347458694053822464?lang=en)\nMarch 2021: DarkSide releases version 2.0 of its ransomware with several updates.\nMay 2021: DarkSide launches the Colonial Pipeline attack. After the attack, Darkside\nannounces it is apolitical and will start vetting its targets (possibly to avoid raising\nattention to future attacks).\n\n**Initial access**\n\nIn our analysis of DarkSide samples, we saw that phishing, remote desktop protocol (RDP)\nabuse, and exploiting known vulnerabilities are the tactics used by the group to gain initial\n[access. The group also uses common, legitimate tools throughout the attack process to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)\nremain undetected and obfuscate its attack.\n\nThroughout the reconnaissance and gaining-entry phases, we saw these legitimate tools\nused for specific purposes:\n\nPowerShell: for reconnaissance and persistence\nMetasploit Framework: for reconnaissance\nMimikatz: for reconnaissance\nBloodHound: for reconnaissance\nCobalt Strike: for installation\n\n\n-----\n\nFor modern ransomware like DarkSide, gaining initial access no longer immediately leads to\nransomware being dropped. There are now several steps in between that are manually\nexecuted by an attacker.\n\n**Lateral movement and privilege escalation**\n\nLateral movement is a key discovery phase in the modern ransomware process. In general,\nthe goal is to identify all critical data within the victim organization, including the target files\nand locations for the upcoming exfiltration and encryption steps.\n\nIn the case of DarkSide, we confirmed reports that the goal of lateral movement is to gain\nDomain Controller (DC) or Active Directory access, which will be used to steal credentials,\nescalate privileges, and acquire other valuable assets for data exfiltration. The group then\ncontinues its lateral movement through the system, eventually using the DC network share to\ndeploy the ransomware to connected machines. Some of the known lateral movement\nmethods deployed by DarkSide use PSExec and RDP. But as we previously noted, a modern\nransomware group behaves with methods more commonly associated with APT groups — it\nadapts its tooling and methods to the victim’s network defenses.\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nAs is common practice with double extortion ransomware, critical files are exfiltrated prior to\nthe ransomware being launched. This is the riskiest step so far in the ransomware execution\nprocess, as data exfiltration is more likely to be noticed by the victim organization’s security\nteam. It is the last step before the ransomware is dropped, and the attack often speeds up at\nthis point to complete the process before it is stopped.\n\nFor exfiltration, we saw the following tools being used:\n\n7-Zip: a utility used for archiving files in preparation for exfiltration\nRclone and Mega client: tools used for exfiltrating files to cloud storage\nPuTTy: an alternative application used for network file transfer\n\n[DarkSide uses several Tor-based leak sites to host stolen data. The](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/) [file-sharing services](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-as-a-service-ransomware-operators-find-ways-to-bring-in-business)\nused by the group for data exfiltration include Mega and PrivatLab.\n\n**Execution and impact**\n\nThe execution of the actual ransomware occurs next. The DarkSide ransomware shares\nmany similarities with REvil in this step of the process, including the structure of ransom\nnotes and the use of PowerShell to execute a command that deletes shadow copies from the\nnetwork. It also uses the same code to check that the victim is not located in a\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to PowerShell, which is used to install and operate the malware itself, the group\n[reportedly uses Certutil and Bitsadmin to download the ransomware. It uses two encryption](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware)\nmethods, depending on whether the target operating system is Windows or Linux: A\nChaCha20 stream cipher with RSA-4096 is used on Linux, and Salsa20 with RSA-1024 is\nused on Windows.\n\nThe following figure shows a sample ransom note from DarkSide.\n\nConclusion\n\nRansomware is an old but persistently evolving threat. As demonstrated by the recent\nactivities of DarkSide, modern ransomware has changed in many aspects: bigger targets,\nmore advanced extortion techniques, and farther-reaching consequences beyond the victims\nthemselves.\n\nRansomware actors are no longer content with simply locking companies out of their\ncomputers and asking for ransom. Now they are digging deeper into their victims’ networks\nand looking for new ways to monetize their activities. For example, a compromised cloud\n[server can go through a complete attack life cycle, from the initial compromise to data](https://blog.trendmicro.com/the-lifecycle-of-a-compromised-cloud-server/)\nexfiltration to resale or use for further monetization. Compromised enterprise assets are a\nlucrative commodity on underground markets; cybercriminals are well aware of how to make\nmoney from attacking company servers.\n\nIn the Colonial Pipeline attack, DarkSide used double extortion. But some ransomware\nactors have gone even further. Jon Clay, Director of Global Threat Communications at Trend\nMicro, outlines the phases of ransomware:\n\nPhase 1: Just ransomware. Encrypt the files, drop the ransom note, and wait for the\npayment.\nPhase 2: Double extortion. Phase 1 + data exfiltration and threatening data release.\n[Maze was one of the first documented cases of this.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/ransomware-evolved-double-extortion/)\nPhase 3: Triple extortion. Phase 1 + Phase 2 + threatening DDoS. SunCrypt,\nRagnarLocker, and Avaddon were among the first groups documented doing this.\nPhase 4: Quadruple extortion. Phase 1 (+ possibly Phase 2 or Phase 3) + directly\nemailing the victim’s customer base or having contracted call centers contact\ncustomers.\n\n[In fact, as detailed in security reports, DarkSide offers both the DDoS and call center options.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/)\nThe group is making quadruple extortion available to its affiliates and showing a clear sign of\ninnovation. In cybercrime, there are no copyright or patent laws for tools and techniques.\nInnovation is as much about quickly and completely copying others’ best practices as it is\nabout coming up with new approaches.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware will only continue to evolve. Organizations therefore need to take the time to\n[put in place an incident response plan focused on the new model of ransomware attacks.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/tips-to-avoid-new-wave-ransomware-attacks.html)\nUnfortunately, some organizations may be putting cybersecurity on the back burner. For\nexample, [some security experts noted that Colonial Pipeline was using a previously exploited](https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1392196162493444098?s=20https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1392196162493444098?s=20)\nvulnerable version of Microsoft Exchange, among other cybersecurity lapses. A successful\nattack on a company providing critical services will have rippling effects that will harm\nmultiple sectors of society, which is why protecting these services should be a top priority.\n\nIn a US Senate hearing on cybersecurity threats, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio described\nthe strike on Colonial Pipeline as “potentially the most substantial and damaging attack on\nUS critical infrastructure ever.” This attack is a call to action for all organizations to harden\ntheir networks against attacks and improve their network visibility.\n\nTrend Micro has a multilayered cybersecurity platform that can help improve your\norganization’s detection and response against the latest ransomware attacks and improve\nyour organization’s visibility. Visit the [Trend Micro Vision One™ website for more](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\ninformation. Detailed solutions can be found in our knowledge base article on DarkSide\nransomware.\n\nIt is interesting to note that DarkSide’s ransom note is [similar to that of Babuk, which might](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/b/new-in-ransomware.html)\nindicate that these two families share a link.\n\nDarkSide ransomware targets\n\nBased on the group’s Tor leak sites, DarkSide determines whether to pursue targeting a\npotential victim organization by primarily looking at that organization’s financial records. It\nalso uses this information to determine the amount of ransom to demand, with a typical\n[ransom demand amounting to anywhere between US$200,000 and US$2 million.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-donates-20k-of-extortion-money-to-charities/)\n\n[Reports say that, based on the leak sites, there are at least 90 victims affected by DarkSide.](https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1391744217513304067)\nIn total, more than 2 TB of stolen data is currently being hosted on DarkSide sites, and 100%\nof victims’ stolen files are leaked.\n\nThe actors behind Darkside have stated that they avoid targeting companies in certain\nindustries, including healthcare, education, the public sector, and the nonprofit sector.\nOrganizations in manufacturing, finance, and critical infrastructure have been identified in\nTrend Micro data as targets.\n\nBased on Trend Micro data, the US is by far DarkSide’s most targeted country, at more than\n500 detections, followed by France, Belgium, and Canada. As previously mentioned,\nDarkSide avoids victimizing companies in CIS countries. Part of the ransomware execution\ncode checks for the geolocation of potential victims to avoid companies in these countries,\nalthough the group would likely be aware of the location of a target organization long before\nthe ransomware is executed. That the group admittedly spares companies in CIS countries\ncould be a clue to where DarkSide actors are residing It is possible that they do this to avoid\n\n\n-----\n\nlaw enforcement action from these countries, since the governments of some of these\ncountries do not persecute criminal acts such as DarkSide’s if they are done on foreign\ntargets.\n\nAfter the Colonial Pipeline attack, DarkSide released a statement on one of its leak sites\nclarifying that the group did not wish to create problems for society and that its goal was\nsimply to make money. There is no way to verify this statement, but we know that the group\nis still quite active. As previously mentioned, DarkSide actors announced that they had stolen\ndata from three more victims since the Colonial Pipeline attack.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques\n\nThe following are the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques associated with DarkSide.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware\n\nTrend Micro Research found dozens of DarkSide ransomware samples in the wild and\ninvestigated how the ransomware group operates and what organizations it typically targets.\n\nBy: Trend Micro Research May 12, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.
