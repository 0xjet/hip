This blog gives an overview\nof the first one, related to Afghanistan & Tajikistan. The other campaign, where the targets\nwere a number of high-profile organizations in Russia, will be the subject of Anton\n**[Cherepanov’s presentation at the ZeroNights security conference in Moscow this](http://2014.zeronights.org/conference/fasttrack.html#cherepanov)**\n**week.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSometimes malware used in various attacks is unique enough to identify related incidents,\n[which makes tracking individual botnets simpler. An example is the BlackEnergy Lite variant](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/22/back-in-blackenergy-2014/)\n(also known as BlackEnergy 3) used by a group of attackers (that was then given the name\nQuedagh, or Sandworm) against targets in Ukraine and other countries. BlackEnergy Lite is\nclearly distinguishable from the numerous binaries of the more common BlackEnergy 2 also\ncirculating in-the-wild.\n\nIn other cases, attackers use more common tools for accomplishing their criminal goals. For\nexample, the Korplug RAT (a.k.a .PlugX) is a well-known toolkit associated with Chinese\nAPT groups and used in a large number of targeted attacks since 2012. For the past several\nweeks we have taken a closer look at a great number of detections of this malware in many\nunrelated incidents.\n\nAmong these, we were able to discover several successful infections where the employed\nKorplug samples were connecting to the same C&C domain.\n\nDOMAIN: www.notebookhk.net\nUpdated Date: 2013-11-12 18:03:45\nCreate Date: 2013-06-18 11:08:17\nRegistrant Name: lee stan\nRegistrant Organization: lee stan\nRegistrant Street: xianggangdiqu\nRegistrant City: xianggangdiqu\nRegistrant State: xianggang\nRegistrant Postal Code: 796373\nRegistrant Country: HK\nRegistrant Phone : +0.04375094543\nRegistrant Fax: +0.04375094543\nRegistrant Email:stanlee@gmail.com\n\nOther Korplug samples were connecting to a different domain name resolving to the same\nIPs as notebookhk.net:\n\nDOMAIN: www.dicemention.com\nUpdated Date: 2013-11-12 18:05:33\nCreate Date: 2013-09-10 14:35:11\nRegistrant Name: z x\nRegistrant Organization: z x\nRegistrant Street: xianggangdiqu\nRegistrant City: xianggangdiqu\nRegistrant State: xianggang\nRegistrant Postal Code: 123456\nRegistrant Country: HK\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrant Phone : +0.0126324313\nRegistrant Fax: +0.0126324313\nRegistrant Email: 123@123.com\n\nDOMAIN: www.abudlrasul.com\nUpdated Date: 2014-10-16 14:16:27\nCreate Date: 2014-10-16 14:16:27\nRegistrant Name: gang xin\nRegistrant Organization: gang xin\nRegistrant Street: Argentina Argentina\nRegistrant City: Argentina\nRegistrant State: Argentina\nRegistrant Postal Code: 647902\nRegistrant Country: AR\nRegistrant Phone : +54.0899567089\nRegistrant Fax: +54.0899567089\nRegistrant Email: woffg89@yahoo.com\n\nTaking these C&Cs as a starting point, we were able to locate a number of victims infected\nthrough various exploit-laden spear-phishing documents and cunningly-named archives.\n\nA table with a selection of RTF documents and RAR self-extracting archives with a .SCR\nextension is shown below:\n\n\n**File name**\n\nSituation Report\nabout Afghan.doc\n\nAGREEMENT\nBETWEENTHE\nNATO AND\nAFGHANISTAN ON\nTHE STATUS OF\nNATO FORCES IN\nAFGHANISTAN.doc\n\n\n**English**\n**translation** **SHA1**\n\n36119221826D0290BC23371B55A8C0E6A84718DD\n\nA6642BC9F3425F0AB93D462002456BE231BB5646\n\n\nnews.doc 51CDC273B5638E06906BCB700335E288807744B5\n\n\nПлан деятельности\nсоединений и\nвоинских частей\nПриволжского\nрегиона на июль\n2014 г.scr\n\n\nActivity\nplan for\nmilitary\nunits in the\nVolga\nregion in\nJuly 2014\n\n\nEA6EE9EAB546FB9F93B75DCB650AF22A95486391\n\n\n-----\n\n**File name**\n\nтелефонный\nсправочник\nструктуры МИД КР\n.scr\n\nО Центре\nсоциальной\nадаптации\nвоеннослужащих.scr\n\nПротокол встречи\nНГШ КНР.scr\n\nисправленный\nшаблон плана\nмероприятий.scr\n\nSituation Report\nabout Afghan.scr\n\nВоеннополитическая\nобстановка в ИРА\nна04.10.2014.scr\n\n\n**English**\n**translation** **SHA1**\n\n\nTelephone\ndirectory of\nthe Ministry\nof Foreign\nAffairs of\nthe Kyrgyz\nRepublic\n\nAbout the\nCenter for\nsocial\nadaptation\nof\nservicemen\n\nMeeting\nminutes of\nthe General\nStaff of the\nPRC\n\nCorrected\naction plan\ntemplate\n\nMilitary and\npolitical\nsituation in\nIslamic\nRepublic of\nAfghanistan\n(IRA) on\n04.10.2014\n\n\nD297DC7D29E42E8D37C951B0B11629051EEBE9C0\n\n8E5E19EBE719EBF7F8BE4290931FFA173E658CB8\n\n1F726E94B90034E7ABD148FE31EBA08774D1506F\n\nA9C627AA09B8CC50A83FF2728A3978492AEB79D8\n\nA9C627AA09B8CC50A83FF2728A3978492AEB79D8\n\nE32081C56F39EA14DFD1E449C28219D264D80B2F\n\n\nAfghan Air Force.scr E32081C56F39EA14DFD1E449C28219D264D80B2F\n\n\nплан\nмероприятий.scr\n\n\nAction plan 1F726E94B90034E7ABD148FE31EBA08774D1506F\n\n\nSome of the above-mentioned files also contained decoy documents:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all of the cases, three binary files were dropped (apart from decoy documents) that led to\nthe Korplug trojan being loading into memory.\n\nexe – a legitimate executable with a Kaspersky digital signature that would load a DLL\nwith a specific file name\ndll – a small DLL loader that would pass execution to the Korplug raw binary code\ndll.avp – raw Korplug binary\n\nThe Korplug RAT is known to use this side-loading trick by abusing legitimate digitally\nsigned executables and is a way to stay under the radar, since a trusted application with a\nvalid signature among startup items is less likely to raise suspicion.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe maliciously crafted documents are RTF files that successfully exploit the CVE-20120158 vulnerability in Microsoft Word. The image below shows the beginning of the CVE2012-0158 shellcode in ASCII encoding within the document (the opcodes 60, 55, 8bec\ndisassemble to pusha; push ebp; mov ebp, esp).\n\nInterestingly, though, the documents also contain the newer CVE-2014-1761 exploit that\nwas extensively used in targeted attacks carried out by a number other malware families\n[this year (including BlackEnergy,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/22/back-in-blackenergy-2014/) [Sednit,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/08/sednit-espionage-group-now-using-custom-exploit-kit/) [MiniDuke, and others). However, this exploit is not](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/)\nimplemented correctly due to a wrong file offset in the 1 stage shellcode.st\n\n\nBelow we see the disassembly of the 1 stage shellcode where it checks the presence ofst\nthe tag “p!11” marking the beginning of the 2nd stage shellcode and loads it into memory.\nEven though the tag and 2nd stage shellcode is present in the RTF, it’s at a different offset,\nand thus never is loaded.\n\n[Sophos’ Gabor Szappanos gives a possible explanation how these malformed samples may](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical%20papers/sophos-rotten-tomato-campaign.pdf)\nhave come into existence.\n\nESET LiveGrid telemetry indicates that the attacks against these targets have been going\non since at least June 2014 and continue through today.\n\nWe were able to pinpoint the targets to residents of the following countries:\n\nAfghanistan\n\n\n-----\n\nTajikistan\nRussia\nKyrgyzstan\nKazakhstan\n\nFrom the topics of the files used to spread the malware, as well as from the affected targets,\nit appears that the attackers are interested in gathering intelligence related to Afghan, Tajik\nand Russian military and diplomatic subjects.\n\nInterestingly, most of the affected victims have another thing in common – a number of other\nRATs, file stealing trojans or keyloggers were detected on their systems on top of the\nKorplug RAT detection. One of these ‘alternative RATs’ was connecting to a domain also\nused by the Korplug samples.\n\nSince the functionality of these tools was partly overlapping with that of Korplug, it left us\nwondering whether the attackers were just experimenting with different RATs or were they\nsupplementing some functionality that they were unable to accomplish.\n\nAdditional information about two malware families that were most often found\naccompanying Korplug infections is given below.\n\n## Alternative Malware #1: DarkStRat\n\nA curious Remote Access Trojan, as research points to a Chinese connection but the\ncommands it listens to are in Spanish (translation in English):\n\nCERRAR (close)\nDESINSTALAR (uninstall)\nSERVIDOR (server)\nINFO\nMAININFO\nPING\nREBOOT\nPOWEROFF\nPROC\nKILLPROC\nVERUNIDADES (see units)\nLISTARARCHIVOS (list files)\nEXEC\nDELFILE\nDELFOLDER\nRENAME\nMKDIR\nCAMBIOID (change ID)\n\n\n-----\n\nGETFILE/SENDFILE/RESUMETRANSFER\nSHELL\nSERVICIOSLISTAR (list service)\nINICIARSERVICIO (start service)\nDETENERSERVICIO (stop service)\nBORRARSERVICIO (erase service)\nINSTALARSERVICIO (install service)\n\nThe malware can manage processes and services on the infected machine, transfer files to\nand from the C&C server, run shell commands, and so on. It is written in Delphi and\nconnects to www.dicemention.com. Some samples contain a digital signature by “Nanning\nweiwu Technology co.,ltd”.\n\n## Alternative Malware #2: File Stealer\n\nThis malware, written in C, and contains several functions for harvesting files off the victim’s\nhard drive according to criteria set in the configuration file. Apart from doing a recursive\nsweep of all logical fixed and remote drives, it also continually monitors any attached\n[removable media or network shares by listening to DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL events.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363205%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n\nIn addition to collecting files, the malware attempts to gather saved passwords, history of\nvisited URLs, account information and proxy information from the following applications:\n\nMicrosoft Messenger\nMicrosoft Outlook\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer\nMozilla Firefox\n\nThe C&C domains used by this malware are:\n\nnewvinta.com\nworksware.net\n\nSome samples of this file stealer detected in these campaigns also contain the signature by\n“Nanning weiwu Technology co.,ltd” – another indicator that the infections are related.\n\n## List of SHA1 hashes:\n\nKorplug:\n\n5DFA79EB89B3A8DDBC55252BD330D04D285F9189\n095550E3F0E5D24A59ADD9390E6E17120039355E\n5D760403108BDCDCE5C22403387E89EDC2694860\n05BFE122F207DF7806EB5E4CE69D3AEC26D74190\n548577598A670FFD7770F01B8C8EEFF853C222C7\n\n\n-----\n\n530D26A9BEEDCCED0C36C54C1BF3CDA28D2B6E62\nF6CB6DB20AA8F17769095042790AEB60EECD58B0\nEF17B7EC3111949CBDBDEB5E0E15BD2C6E90358F\n17CA3BBDDEF164E6493F32C952002E34C55A74F2\n973EA910EA3734E45FDE304F20AB6CF067456551\n47D78FBFB2EFC3AB9DDC653A0F03D560D972BF67\n0B5A7E49987EF2C320864CF205B7048F7032300D\nE81E0F416752B336396294D24E639AE86D9C6BAA\nE930D3A2E6B2FFDC7052D7E18F51BD5A765BDB90\n\nAlternative Malware #1:\n\nFDD41EB3CBB631F38AC415347E25926E3E3F09B6\n457F4FFA2FE1CACFEA53F8F5FF72C3FA61939CCD\n5B6D654EB16FC84A212ACF7D5A05A8E8A642CE20\n7D59B19BD56E1D2C742C39A2ABA9AC34F6BC58D4\nD7D130B8CC9BEA51143F28820F08068521763494\n01B4B92D5839ECF3130F5C69652295FE4F2DA0C5\n02C38EC1C67098E1F6854D1125D3AED6268540DE\n\nAlternative Malware #2:\n\n3A7FB6E819EEC52111693219E604239BD25629E9\nBF77D0BA7F3E60B45BD0801979B12BEA703B227B\n55EF67AFA2EC2F260B046A901868C48A76BC7B72\nA29F64CD7B78E51D0C9FDFBDCBC57CED43A157B2\n34754E8B410C9480E1ADFB31A4AA72419056B622\n17A2F18C9CCAAA714FD31BE2DE0BC62B2C310D8F\n6D99ACEA8323B8797560F7284607DB08ECA616D8\n1884A05409C7EF877E0E1AAAEC6BB9D59E065D7C\n1FC6FB0D35DCD0517C82ADAEF1A85FFE2AFAB4EE\n5860C99E5065A414C91F51B9E8B779D10F40ADC4\n7950D5B57FA651CA6FA9180E39B6E8CC1E65B746\n\n**Research by: Anton Cherepanov**\n\n12 Nov 2014 - 03:17PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n\n-----\n\n### Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
