According to the report, the attackers targeted Russian federal](https://rt-solar.ru/analytics/reports/2203/)\nexecutive authorities.\n\nWhile analyzing the report, Anastasia Tikhonova (Head of APT Research at Group-IB) and Dmitry Kupin (Senior Malware\nAnalyst) noticed that they had already come across similar tools in earlier attacks.\n\nChinese APTs are one of the most numerous and aggressive hacker communities. Several dozen groups conduct attacks in countries\nall over the world, and Russia is no exception. Hackers mostly target state agencies, industrial facilities, military contractors, and\nresearch institutes. The main objective is espionage: attackers gain access to confidential data and attempt to hide their presence for\nas long as possible. There have been cases when attackers successfully persisted in the victim's network for several years.\n\nUnfortunately, the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report did not provide indicators of compromise, so the experts had to rely on\ndescriptions of the functionality and screenshots of the malicious code. As a result, Group-IB's researchers came up with some\ninteresting conclusions about which Chinese groups could be behind the attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in\n2020, what tools they used, and how their malware has evolved since.\n\nKey conclusions\n\nThe research describes Webdav-O malware detected in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020.\n\nGroup-IB experts detected two versions of the Webdav-O Trojan for x86 and x64 systems.\n\nWhen comparing parts of the code, the specialists proved that the Webdav-O x64 Trojan was used in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities. The malware has existed since at least 2018.\n\nGroup-IB specialists established that Webdav-O has a set of commands similar to a popular Trojan called BlueTraveller (aka RemShell), which was developed in China and has been linked to the hacker\ngroup called TaskMasters.\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore that, Sentinel Labs released a report about malware called MailO, which was also identified in attacks against Russian federal executive\nauthorities. Mail-O was deemed to be linked to the Chinese hacker\ngroup TA428.\n\nGroup TA428 is known to use a Trojan called Albaniiutas in their\nattacks. Group-IB's analysis showed that Albaniiutas is an updated\nversion of BlueTraveller.\n\nGroup-IB experts believe that either both Chinese hacker groups\n(TA428 and TaskMasters) attacked Russian federal executive\nauthorities in 2020 or that there is one united Chinese hacker group\nmade up of different units.\n\n**TA428 is a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group that has been**\noperating since 2013. The attackers target a number of government\nagencies in East Asia that control governmental information\ntechnology, domestic and foreign policy, and economic development.\n\n**TaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller) is a state-sponsored Chinese**\nhacker group that allegedly has been active since at least 2010. The\ngroup attacks companies based in several countries, but many of their\ntargets are located in Russia and CIS. The hackers target solid industrial\nand energy enterprises, government agencies, and transport companies.\nStarting point\n\nAs the experts put it: \"The report dwells on the analysis of a\n_series of targeted attacks\". Based on this information, we_\nassumed that several hacker groups may be behind the attacks.\n\nThe attackers used malware that interacted with management\nserver via the cloud service called Yandex.Disk. The malware was\ndubbed Webdav-O.\n\nAttackers also used malicious software that accessed the cloud\nservice Mail.ru. The malware was dubbed Mail-O.\n\nIn early June 2021, analysts from the American cybersecurity company\n[Sentinel Labs released a report about Mail-O. The experts wrote that Mail-O is a version of the relatively well-known malware called SManager, which is used by the Chinese hacker group TA428.](https://labs.sentinelone.com/thundercats-hack-the-fsb-your-taxes-didnt-pay-for-this-op/)\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB specialists wanted to make sure that Mail-O is loader, while Smanager and Tmanger are Remote Access Trojans (RAT). However, a part of the code overlaps in the exported functions \"Entery\"\nand \"ServiceMain\" of Mail-O, SManager and Tmanger, which brings us back to TA428. Moreover, hackers from TA428 have already been found to be involved in espionage against Russia, especially\n[Russian state facilities.](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2021/april/drweb_research_attacks_on_russian_research_institutes_en.pdf)\n\nTo prove the hypothesis that TA428 was behind the attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020, we decided to analyze a sample of Webdav-O. Group-IB Threat Intelligence &\nAttribution has detected similar malicious behavior before and can now explain why we link it to a specific group. Below we provide an analysis of Webdav-O samples and highlight features that overlap\nwith the points mentioned in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report.\n\n**骑驴找马 [qí lǘ zhǎo mǎ]**\n\n**Verbatim translation: Ride a mule while looking for a horse.**\n\n**Definition: Use the tools you have while looking for something better.**\nAnalysis of Webdav-O sample\n\nName 1.dll\n\nSHA1 c9e03855f738e360d24018e2d203142c7ae6c2ec\n\nCompilation timestamp 2018-07-12 03:08:01\n\nFirst Submission 2019-11-07 10:34:11\n\nDll Name y_dll.dll\n\nExport function ServiceMain\n\nFile \"1.dll\" is an x86 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the system.\n\nThe analyzed file provides remote access to the command line shell (cmd.exe) and executes various commands originating from C2 on the compromised host.\n\nThe legitimate cloud service called Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is used as network infrastructure, namely C&C. Network interaction with the cloud is implemented via the Webdav protocol. The\nauthentication method is Basic.\n\nThe strings and configuration data are encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using the following key: { 8A 4F 01 47 34 C9 75 F8 2B C8 C1 E9 D2 F3 A5 8B }. The key size is 16 bytes. The analyzed filed\ncan work with 1-7 accounts (in this case only 2 are used, but we will come back to this later).\nFeatures of the sample\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe exported ServiceMain function uses a random delay before the main code is executed.\n\n01\n\nYandex.Disk cloud accounts are checked for availability using the query \"/?userinfo\" (GET).\n\n02\n\nThe file \"/test3.txt\" is uploaded from \"Yandex.Disk\" (GET) and checked for the \"Just A Test!\" line. In case of success, the system checks for batch files in the \"/test\" directory of \"Yandex.Disk\"\n(PROFIND).\n\n03\n\n\n-----\n\nA command file is defined for downloading from the Yandex.Disk cloud (GET). The response from the server is processed. The name of the file with commands is between the tags:\n\n_<d:href>[name of the command file]</d:href>_\n04\n\nIn the command file, the contents are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. After downloading the command file, it is deleted from Yandex.Disk (DELETE).\n\n05\n\nThe file \"/test2.txt\" is uploaded to Yandex.Disk (PUT). The file \"/test2.txt\" contains the line \"Just A Test!\". The mechanism is presumably used to check the functioning of a malicious program.\n\n06\n\nThe file \"/test2/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\" is uploaded to \"Yandex.Disk\" (PUT). The file contains the command results.

Some of the common features can be seen in the\nscreenshot with the malware code, which shows the receipt of the command files list in the test folder:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Comparison of the Webdav-O sample from the report (on the left) to the VirusTotal sample (on the right)_\n\nComparison of Webdav-O samples\n\n**Webdav-O sample from the report**\n**_________________________________________**\n\nBasic authentication and OAuth\n_________________________________________\n\nList of commands (5):\n\n-upload\n\n-download\n\n-setsleep\n\n-quit\n\n[other command cmd.exe]\n\n**-sleepuntil**\n_________________________________________\n\nCommand response format:\n\n##u## %s %s (-upload)\n\n##d## %s (-download)\n\n##s## %d (-setsleep)\n\n\n-----\n\n**##l## %s (-sleepuntil)**\n_________________________________________\n\nFile objects in Yandex.Disk storage:\n\ntest2.txt, test3.txt\n\n/test\n\n/test2\n\n/test2/%04d%04d.bin\n\n**test4.txt**\n\n**test5.txt**\n\n**test7.txt**\n_________________________________________\n\nGenerates an RC4 session key (contained in the file test7.txt in encrypted form).

When we decrypted the malware string, we found the following \"login:password\" for the attacker's accounts used on Yandex.Disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data discovered:\n\naleshaadams:7ujm!QAZ2wsx\n\ntstrobos:&UJM1qaz2ws\n\nIf the account login is known, it is possible to recover the email address as follows:\n\ntstrobos@yandex.ru\n\naleshaadams@yandex.ru\n\n\n-----\n\n_Attempt to recover the password for aleshaadams@yandex.ru_\n\n_Attempt to recover the password for tstrobos@yandex.ru_\n\nThe screenshots show that both accounts are linked to cellphone numbers in the same region (+86), which is the country code for China.\n\nAnalysis of password generation\n\n[In 2019, Elmar Nabigaev (Deputy Director of Expert Security Center Positive Technologies) delivered a report entitled \"The TaskMasters APT\" (aka BlueTraveller) and gave examples of passwords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYuclHsoQO4&t=698s)\ndiscovered when investigating the malware campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe images above show that the passwords to the Webdav-O account were generated using a similar technique as TaskMasters. The only things that changed were the registry and the key row\ncombination.\n\nBlurring the boundaries\n\nConsidering all the comparisons made and the information discovered about the accounts, we believe that the Chinese hacker group TaskMasters is most likely behind the attacks involving an\nimproved version of the Webdav-O Trojan. The case of TA428, however, is still open to debate. Could both of them be behind the attack against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020? Could there\nbe someone else involved? Or was it the same group?\n\nWe will continue our investigation and seek more information for analysis. Let us take a look at the report about TA428 and their new tools, in particular the Trojan called Albaniiutas, which was released\nby NTT Security Corporation in 2020.\n\n_Executing Albaniiutas files, NTT report_\n\nThe aim of our investigation is to study these two objects. Our reasoning will be presented below.\n\nFirst and foremost, we discovered some common points in the utility used to launch DLL:\n\n**BlueTraveller** **Albaniiutas**\n\n1.exe vjsc.dll\n\n6303CCE6747703E81A5A52DEC11A3BA7DB26EA4B 2FE6AF7CE84CB96AE640BB6ED25A7BA67591A11E\n\nUtility for registering and running DLL as a service in the system and for removing this service. DLL responsible for registering and running DLL as a service in the system.\n\n\nLaunched in the command line shell (cmd.exe). Receives the following command line arguments:\nC:\\Users\\IEUser\\Desktop\\1.exe Usage: install -i DllPath or install -u ServiceName\n\n\nUploaded by the file \"Scrpt.exe\" (SHA1:\nBC708ACDF6B8B60577268A0788F1E375CB3FFEB4) – legitimate signed file \"vjc.exe\".\nOriginal DLL name: \"ServiceAdd.dll\".\n\n\n-----\n\n**BlueTraveller** **Albaniiutas**\n\n\"-i [DllPath]\" – registering and running DLL as a service. \"-u [ServiceName]\" – deleting the specified\nservice.\n\nCode parts of both utilities show the similarities in more detail. As can be seen, both samples use XOR encryption, which even displays identical debugging information.\n\n_Fragments of code encrypted with XOR and debugging lines in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fragments of code of the XOR encrypting function in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nMoreover, there are common points at the stage of establishing persistence in the system. The screenshots below show that the same DLL name randomization occurs. The same description of the service\nunder which this DLL will work is also displayed.\n\n_Fragments of code with DLL name randomization in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nLet's continue our comparative analysis and take a look at a sample of BlueTraveller (SHA1:6857BB2C3AE5F9C2393D9F88816BE7A10CB5573F) and a fileless RAT belonging to the Albaniiutas family.\n\n**BlueTraveller** **Albaniiutas**\n\nnetui4.dll \n6857BB2C3AE5F9C2393D9F88816BE7A10CB5573F 08645D079ABE05B88201DB0FF1C9B1EC035035CA\n\nDLL is a RAT. Fileless DLL is a payload in the form of a RAT.\n\nLauched via service (exported function ServiceMain). Uploaded by the file \"XpEXPrint.dll / [a-z]{4}.dll\" (SHA1: AE57D779AAC235E979FAE617599377A099B148AB). It is contained in resources in\nan encrypted form.\n\nOriginal DLL name: \"client_dll.dll\". Original DLL name: \"ClientX.dll\".\n\nWe also analyzed code parts that look very similar. For example, part of the pseudocode for executing commands in the command line shell (cmd.exe) is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fragments of the code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nNext, we analyzed the code parts of data processing received from the C&C server:\n\n_Fragments of the code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe parts of code above show that the code in BlueTraveller is less sophisticated, but in both cases the separator \"\\b\" is used three times (the strtok function). Below is an example of the data that\nAlbaniiutas malware receives for each command:\n\nFormat of the data received when executing commands (retrieved from the NTT report)\n\n1\n\nIf the command is executed multiple times, the command will not be executed unless a value other than the previous one is specified.\n\n2\n\nSeparator\n\n3\n\nIf the value does not match the value in ③, the command will not be executed.\n\n4\n\nCommand identifier and command parameters separated by spaces.\n\nLet's also compare the code fragments for checking and executing the commands received from the C&C server:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fragments of code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nIt is clear that this part was updated by the hackers, but the commands remain the same:\n\n**Command** **Options** **Description**\n\n-exit Terminates the function for receiving and processing commands (exiting the flow)\n\n-download Downloads URLs or Path to the storage directory Downloads a file from the C&C server\n\n-upload Path to the file on the infected device or Part of path of the URL-address during the upload Uploads a file to the C&C server\n\n(command) Command arguments Executes the command with cmd.exe and returns the result to the C&C server.\n\nIn addition, the two Trojans have a similar pattern of communicating with the control server in the protocols of network interaction with the C&C server. Below is an example of network communication\nwith the C&C server, taken from BlueTraveller samples available on VirusTotal.\n\n**BlueTraveller** **Albaniiutas**\n\nhttp://45.32.188[.]226/0000/1301/0024/4u/i7fr09bGus+Wyt7iyjos= http://go.vegispaceshop[.]org/home/2252/0108/IKNYF6oSkYtpU60GfnS27fbRKdcvCj/kZgeNi/\n8QIRN2+6+O3gKV6ODd2mEPNo7tYi1+ePOSmFzMlUY1ciJ1 A0XSw8aOkJzTDXITxdSNo74=\n\nTemplate: [IP]/[0000 or 1111]/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{4}/[base64 data] Template: [domain]/[dir]/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{4}/[base64 data]\n\nLet's move on to string obfuscation in Albaniiutas. We have established that strings are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. The encryption key used is L!Q@W#E$R%T^Y&U*A|}t~k.\n\nThe same encryption key was used in the BlueTraveller server component which stores the log files in the encrypted form:\n\n\n-----\n\n_[A fragment of code with a line written to a log file (retrieved from PTSecurity \"Operation TaskMasters\" 2019)](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/research/analytics/operation-taskmasters-2019/)_\n\nThe conclusion is clear: Albaniiutas is nothing but a logic continuation of the malware belonging to the BlueTraveller family.\n\nAnd then it dawned on us…\n\nWe thought that we had analyzed everything and that we were done with comparisons, when suddenly a sample was uploaded to VirusTotal. We identified it as Webdav-O.\n\nName y_dll.dll\n\nSHA1 3ff73686244ca128103e86d8c5aa024e37e7b86d\n\nCompilation timestamp 2018-12-06 11:15:35\n\nFirst Submission 2021-06-05 04:41:00\n\n\n-----\n\nDll Name y_dll.dll\n\nExport function ServiceMain\n\nThe file \"y_dll.dll\" is an x64 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the system.\n\nAs can be seen, this version of Webdav-O was written for a system with a different bitness and compiled later than our sample of Webdav-O x86 (2018-12 and 2018-07, respectively).\n\nThe legitimate cloud service Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is also used as a network infrastructure, in particular C2. Network interaction with the cloud is carried out via a Webdav protocol.\n\nHowever, this sample supports two authentication methods instead of one in Webdav-O x86: Basic (with a username and password) and OAuth (using a token).\n\nThe strings and configuration data are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm with the following key: { C3 02 03 04 05 DD EE 08 09 10 11 12 1F D2 15 16 }. The key size is 16 bytes. The analyzed file can\nwork with 1-7 accounts (it works with only one in this case).\n\nThis sample seemed even more similar to the one described in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report: unlike our sample, it has the \"-sleepuntil\" function.\n\nUnfortunately colleagues at SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC did not provide any indicators of compromise, so we can only make comparisons based on screenshots and descriptions of the capabilities of their\nsample.\n\n**_Webdav-O sample from the report and Webdav-O x64 sample_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Webdav-O sample from the report and Webdav-O x64 sample (processing the -sleepuntil command)_**\n\nThe parts of code presented above show that both versions look identical. Group-IB experts also noticed that in Webdav-O x64, the commands and their results are transferred by uploading various files\nto Yandex.Disk:\n\nDescription of files created by Webdav-O from the report:\n\n**test2.txt, test3.txt. are files used to check the connection**\n\n**test4.txt contains information about the interval (minutes) between command requests to the server**\n\n**test5.txt contains the launch date for the malware**\n\n**test7.txt is uploaded to the server and contains a 16-byte RC4 key that is used to encrypt commands and their results (the key is also encrypted with a public RSA key)**\n\n**test is a directory containing files that are downloaded, decrypted, and processed as commands.

The content is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm with the following key: { 8A 4F 01 47 34 C9 75 F8 2B C8 C1 E9 D2 F3 A5 8B } (16 bytes). It is noteworthy that\nthis key has already been used by another sample of our Webdav-O x86 to encrypt strings and configuration data.\n\ntest7.txt It is loaded onto the server and contains a RC4 session key (16 bytes), which is used to encrypt commands and their results (the key itself is encrypted with a public RSA key).

Webdav-O was designed for both x86 and x64 systems.\n\nWebdav-O may have been used by the Chinese APT TaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller). Based on the information about attacks on various federal executive authorities in 2020, presented in the SOLAR\nJSOC and NCIRC report, it is possible that in some cases the Chinese APT TA428 was behind the attacks, while others could have been performed by TaskMasters.\n\nResearchers from SentinelLabs have linked Mail-O to Smanager and Tmanger (tools used by TA428). Group-IB specialists found common code parts in the malware's exported functions \"Entery\" and\n\"ServiceMain\". We can say with moderate confidence that Mail-O was developed by TA428.\n\nBased on research done by NTT Security, it can be said that TA428 has already used the malware Albaniiutas. Group-IB experts have shown that the Trojan is a new version of BlueTraveller (RemShell).\nAs such, it can be assumed that Webdav-O is also linked to TA428.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Chinese hacker groups actively exchange tools and infrastructure, but perhaps it is just the case here.\n\nThere is also strong evidence that points to one large hacker group consisting of several intelligence units of the People's Liberation Army of China. For example, unit 61398 from Shanghai is responsible\n[for the actions of a well-known group called APT1 (aka Comment Crew), and unit 61419 from Qingdao has been linked to Tick. Each unit attacks to the fullest, according to a strict timeline and order.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/02/mandiant-exposes-apt1-chinas-cyber-espionage-units.html)\nThis means that one Trojan can be configured and modified by hackers from different departments with different levels of training and with various objectives.\n\n\n-----\n\nIoCs\n\n\n\"/test\"\n\"/test2\"\n\"/test[2-7]{1}.txt\"\n\"/test/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\n\"/test2/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\"\n\"[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\"\n\nWebdav-O is
