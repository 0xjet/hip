    "plain_text": "# Cyber-Espionage Campaign Targeting the Naval Industry (“MartyMcFly”)\n\n**blog.yoroi.company/**\n\nCERT-YOROI October 17, 2018\n\n## Background\n\nDuring the last week Yoroi CERT’s analysts uncovered several attacks targeting the\nitalian naval and defence industry. The attacker used email as known propagation vector\nin order to infect victims by sending a special crafted xls file. The identified attack\nproperties triggered internal defcon escalation in order to assess the threat magnitude and\neventually special malware analyses according to the threat.\n\nThe suspicious emails have been intercepted between 9th and 15th October during our\ncommon CSDC (Cyber Security Defence Center) operations in two different champains,\neach one characterized by one or more attempts and slightly different social engineering\ntricks.\n\n## Malicious Emails\n\nThe first intercepted malicious email had “markvanschaick.nl @qixnig .com” as a sender\naddress. The specific name has been likely chosen by the attacker to try to exploit the\nDutch marine service company reputation “Mark Van Schaick”, but sender’s domain and ip\naddress shown no direct relationship to that organisation.\n\n_Figure 1. SMTP header details of wave 1_\n\nThe message has been sent from a\nRoundcube webmail server hosted on lord.\nvivawebhost .com (173.237.190.12 COLO4-BLK7 US) and apparently unrelated to the\nsender’s domain. Moreover, “qixnig .com” (sender domain name) resolves to a different\nIP address reachable at 66.45.243.148 (INTERSERVER US). It’s interesting to figure out\nthe crafted redirection applied to any visiting users: a HTTP 301 code redirecting to the\nDan Marine Group’s official web portal.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Redirection to the Dan Marine web portal_\n\nThe second email campaign was slightly different respect to the first one. It was\noriginated by another Roundcube webmail service hosted at mail.dbweb .se (52.58.78.16\nAT-88-Z US):\n\n_Figure 3. SMTP header details of wave 2_\n\nIn this case the fake communication process\nmimics the interaction between “Naviera Ulises Ltd <supplie@ulisnav.gr>” and “Evripidis\n_Mareskas (Mr) <supplies.ulisnav @ kiramko .com>”. The extracted domain r happens to be_\n“kiramko .com” and it resolved to the same remote ip address discovered in the first\ncampaign wave (“qixnig .com”, 66.45.243.148 INTERSERVER US). Those campaigns could\nbe considered as closely correlated. The “ulisnav .gr” appears to be unregistered at time\nof writing.\n\nThe intercepted emails come up with a carefully prepared phishing scheme, definitely\ntargeting the italian naval sector. The observed chunks of headers and the network\ncontext shown the attacker tried to impersonate known vendors of marine parts and naval\nservices in order to lure victims to open up the attached documents.\n\nFor example the first two detected\nattempts tried to mimic inquiries from\nthe Chinese Dan Marine Group,\npretending to validate the sender’s\ndomain “qixnig .com” as legibly owned\nby the group. It then tried to redirect\nvisitors to the Dan Marine official website. Another intercepted email inserted the victim\nas BCC into a fake communication between the tech support of the greek Naviera Ulises\nLtd and one of its employer (data publicly available on linkedin).\n\nNo one of these communications appear to be real and legitim, indeed the intercepted\ndata does not suggest the attacker has any kind of access to real assets.\n\n## Attachments\n\nThe intercepted email messages have more than one attached documents: on the first\nemail campaign we observed two copies of the same Excel file\n(5c947b48e737648118288cb04d2abd7b) wrapping CDFV2 encrypted data and scoring\n[relatively low in the VT’s AV coverage test (9/59 at time of writing).](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/a42bb4900131144aaee16d1235a22ab6d5af43407a383c3d17568dc7cfe10e64/details)\n\n\n-----\n\n(66b239615333c3eefb8d4bfb9999291e) from a compromised web portal:\n\n_Figure 4. Malware download HTTP request intercepted_\n\nFurther details regarding the evasion techniques, especially related to the\n“VelvetSweatshop” trick and the Equation Editor’s exploit used to drop the malware, are\n[available here (link).](https://marcoramilli.blogspot.com/2018/10/martymcfly-malware-targeting-naval.html)\n\n_Figure 5. Malicious excel document_\n\nThe second attack had as attachment a copy of Excel file and one more PDF document\nnamed “Company profile.pdf” (6d2fc17061c942a6fa5b43c285332251), this file appears\nto have been generated in the same time-period of the phishing attempts: nearly 30\nminutes before the dispatch of the malicious message, from a MS Word 2013 document.\n\n_Figure 6. “Company Profile.pdf” metadata_\n\nThe embedded attachments have been delivered\nin the middle of October using multiple names,\nmost of them related to the naval industry and\ncontaining references to quotations, inquiry or\norders of mechanical parts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Submission time and names of the samples_\n\nHaving said that, we can now explain the internal choice of the “MartyMcFly” code-name\nfor this campaign: the name comes from the “First Seen in The Wild ” value reported by the\nVT platform and the meta-data found in the artifacts, which are a quite interesting topic to\nbe discussed.\n\n## Payload\n\nThe executable payload has been downloaded from a\npotentially compromised website legitimately owned by a\nturkish company selling mechanical spare parts, indicating\nthe attacker had carefully taken care of the thematization\nof the malware distribution infrastructure.\n\nThe PE32 file 66b239615333c3eefb8d4bfb9999291e contains executable binary code\ncompiled from Delphi source code (BobSoft Mini Delphi).\n\nThe first stage of execution shows several anti-analysis patterns and tricks, for instance\nat 0x0045e304 the malware checks if the year of the local time configured in the OS is\nafter 2017 (rif. Figure 8) moreover at 0x045e393 it slows down the execution invoking the\nSleepEx library function (rif. Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Current Local Time check_\n\n_Figure 9. Code slow down via SleepEx_\n\nThe bypass of all the debug checks and evasion tricks inside the malicious code leads to\nthe dynamic loading of a .NET module in a RWX code-segment mapped at the\n0x012e0000 location.\n\n_Figure 10. Executable module unpacked in memory_\n\nYara signatures claim the extracted PE32 module is attributable to a weaponized version\n[of “QuasarRAT”: an open-source remote administration tool freely available on github.](https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT)\n\n_Figure 11. Yara signature match on the dumped_\n_.NET Modules_\n\nThe manual verification reported in Figure 12\nconfirms the extracted payload is compatible with\nQuasarRAT modules published on the github\nrepository. Moreover, the IoC section below\nreports the C2 server locations found in the\nmalware configurations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Example of module names and messages used by the QuasarRAT_\n\nAt the moment no attribution to known group is possible, many threat actor choose to use\nor customize open-source tools to try to make the attribution harder, such as the chinese\n“Stone Panda” group (APT-10) known for espionage operations against defence and\n[government, having the QuasarRAT in their arsenal, or also the “Gorgon Group”, the](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/AA18-284A)\nambiguous mercenary group responsible of both cyber-crime attacks and targeted\nespionage campaigns against governments.\n\n## Indicator of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\nMalspam\n\nINQUIRY FOR Engine Requisition: Spare parts: Valves: Cylinder etc\n“Mark Van Schaick Marine” <markvanschaick.nl @qixnig[.com>\nMark van Schaick Enquiry – Marine Parts, Valve, Cylinder ets..xlsx\nMark Van Schaick Company Profile.xlsx\n“INQUIRY MJ1409-FWS-FBR-61 / 18092867Q1/ MARINE PARTS”\n“Cherry dan” <cherry.dan-marine @ qixnig[.com>\nEngine_9463.xlsx\nList of order spares parts.xlsx\nCompany Profile.pdf\nlord.vivawebhost[.com\nmail.dbweb[.se\nDropurl\n\nhttp://apexmetalelektrik[.com/js/jquery/ui/jquery/file/alor/GEqy87.exe\nC2\n\nsecureserver.marinelectricsystems[.com:4783\nsafebridge.marinelectricsystems[.com:4783\nneumeistermcntrade[.ddns[.net:4783\nmcntradeandreas.ddns[.net:4783\n79.172.242[.87:4783\nHash\n\na42bb4900131144aaee16d1235a22ab6d5af43407a383c3d17568dc7cfe10e64\nxlsx\n3b5bd3d99f1192adc438fb05ab751330d871f6ebb5c22291887b007eaefbfe7b\npdf\n1aa066e4bcc018762554428297aa734302cfbb30fef02c0382f35b37b7524a4a\nexe\n\n\n-----",
