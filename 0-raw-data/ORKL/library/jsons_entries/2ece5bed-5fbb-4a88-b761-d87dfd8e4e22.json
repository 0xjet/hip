It is commonly\nused by Windows malware such as Bredolab and the high-profile Mahdi trojan from last\n[year to hide the real extension of executable files. Check out this Krebs on Security post](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/09/right-to-left-override-aids-email-attacks/)\nfor more details on the trick.\n\n[We've spotted a malware for Mac using the RLO trick. It was submitted to VirusTotal last](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3bc13adad9b7b60354d83bc27a507864a2639b43ec835c45d8b7c565e81f1a8f/analysis/)\nFriday.\n\nThe objective here is not as convoluted as the one described in Kreb's post. Here it's\nsimply to hide the real extension. The malware could have just used \"Recent\nNew.pdf.app\". However OS X has already considered this and displays the real\nextension as a precaution.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The malware is written in Python and it uses py2app for distribution. Just like Hackback,](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002559.html)\nit's signed with an Apple Developer ID.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, because of the RLO character, the usual file quarantine notification from OS X\nwill be backwards just like the Krebs case.\n\nThe malware drops and open a decoy document on execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen it creates a cron job for its launch point and a hidden folder in the home directory\nof the infected user to store its components.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware connects to the following pages to obtain the address of its command and\ncontrol server:\n\n- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZZ3tTTBiTs\n\n- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky4M9kxUM7Y\n\n- http://hjdullink.nl/images/re.php\n\nIt parses for the address in the string \"just something i made up for fun, check out my\nwebsite at (address) bye bye\".\n\nThe YouTube page look like this:\n\n\n-----\n\nDoing a Google search for the string reveals that there are other sites being abused\nbesides those mentioned above.\n\nThe malware then continuously takes screen shots and records audio (using a third\nparty software called SoX) and uploads them to the command and control server. It also\ncontinuously polls the command and control server for commands to execute.\n\nThe malware is detected by F-Secure as Backdoor:Python/Janicab.A.\n\n**Updated to add:**\n\nHere are the stats from one of the YouTube videos being used as a C&C locater:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe videos predate the Janicab.A binary by at least a month. Based on the stats, it\nseems likely there are earlier variants in the wild.\n\n\n-----",
