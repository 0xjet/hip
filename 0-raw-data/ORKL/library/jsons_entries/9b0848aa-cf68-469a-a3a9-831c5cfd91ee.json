Open APIs, extensible integrations, and developerfriendly tools mean that entire virtual offices - complete with virtual workflows - can exist in a\nGoogle ecosystem. Unfortunately, Google’s open and democratized nature is being exploited\nby cybercriminals to defraud individuals and organizations of money and sensitive data.\n\nThe Armorblox threat research team has seen a sharp uptick in attackers using Google\nservices to help them get emails past binary security filters based on keywords or URLs. In\nthis blog, we will outline five targeted phishing campaigns that weaponize various Google\nservices during their attack flow. These attacks are representative but in no way exhaustive they are the tip of a deep iceberg. If successful, these email attacks using Google services\ncould have potentially impacted tens of thousands of mailboxes within Armorblox customer\nenvironments alone.\n\n## 1. American Express Credential Phishing\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Summary of the American Express credential phishing attack**\n\n### Attack summary\n\nA credential phishing email impersonating American Express Customer Care that informs\nreaders that they left out providing some information while validating their card. The email\nincludes a link where readers can fill in this information and validate their card.\n\n### Google service used\n\nThe phishing page in the email is hosted on a Google form with a smattering of American\nExpress branding. This fairly long form asks victims for their American Express login\ncredentials, card details, and even their mother’s maiden name (which is a common security\nquestion).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Phishing page for the AmEx attack was hosted on a Google form**\n\nHosting the phishing page on a Google form helps the initial email evade any security filters\nthat block known bad links or domains. Since Google’s domain is inherently trustworthy and\nGoogle forms are used for several legitimate reasons, no email security filter would\nrealistically block this link on day zero.\n\n### Other techniques used\n\nImpersonation: American Express Customer Care\nSocial engineering: Time-bound request to validate AmEx card by providing personal\ninformation\n\n## 2. Benefactor Scam Reconnaissance\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Benefactor scam email with a Google form link**\n\n### Attack summary\n\nCybercriminals impersonate a childless widow who wants to part with large sums of money\nbut has nowhere to disburse it. The email asks people interested to receive money to either\nclick the link in the email or send a reply to the address included in the email body.\n\n### Google service used\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link in the email leads to a seemingly empty Google form with an untitled question and\none answer option (Option 1). At first glance, it seems the attackers have been lazy or\nnegligent, but this is a common reconnaissance technique employed at the start of\ntargeted email attacks.\n\nMany people will feel the email is suspicious after going through the content and visiting this\ndummy form. But some people will submit the only option allowed by the form, or they will\nsend a reply to the address provided in the email. This allows attackers to shortlist the most\nnaive and emotionally susceptible email recipients, who will be prime targets for follow-up\nemails from the childless widow.\n\n**Fig: Empty Google form used as a reconnaissance technique**\n\nJust like the earlier American Express credential phishing attack, hosting the phishing page\non a Google form here helps the initial email evade any security filters that block known bad\nlinks or domains.\n\n### Other techniques used\n\nImpersonation\nSocial engineering: Emotional request from a widow, temptation of large sums of\nmoney.\n\n## 3. Security Team Impersonation\n\n### Attack summary\n\nCybercriminals impersonate an organization’s security administrator team with an email that\ninforms readers that they haven’t received some ‘vital’ emails because of a storage quota\nissue. The mail body includes a link for readers to verify their information and resume email\n\n\n-----\n\ndelivery.\n\nA snapshot of the email is given below. We have used a fictional organization called Foxtrot\nto showcase this email.\n\n**Fig: Email impersonating the security team with an email delivery failure message**\n\n### Google service used\n\nThe link in the email leads to a fake login page hosted on Firebase, Google’s mobile\nplatform that enables users to create apps, host files and images, and serve user-generated\ncontent.\n\n[The parent URL of the page - https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com - won’t be blocked by](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/te-uriucx-reuines-253.appspot.com/o/%40%40%40indexv-vb-vau-ry-8%252Fbv-yu-er-8F%25252525%2525252F%25252525%2525252F%25252525%2525252F%25252525%2525252F%25252525.html?alt=media&token=7fb7ef8c-0366-44c0-a0e2-a0152de28cdf#PublicRecordsRequest@sanjoseca.gov)\nany security filters due to its inherent legitimacy.\n\nThe login screen is simple, with the email address of the victim pre entered into the first field.\nImitating ‘quick fill’ techniques used by forms on legitimate websites is commonly used by\ncybercriminals to lull victims into a false sense of security.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Phishing page hosted on Firebase Storage**\n\n### Other techniques used\n\nImpersonation: security administrator team.\nSocial engineering: Email focuses on failure to deliver ‘vital’ messages and includes a\nlink to resume email delivery. The email body includes negative repercussions for lack\nof action (failure to verify your email account will lead to suspension and lost data).\nLink redirections: the URL in the email goes through one redirection before landing on\nthe Firebase hosted page, obfuscating the attack flow for any security technology that\nattempts to follow the URL to its final destination.\n\n## 4. Payslip Scam\n\n### Attack summary\n\nCybercriminals impersonate an organization’s payroll team and send an email with payslip\ndetails to victims. The email points readers to a link for them to check if their personal\ninformation for the payslip is accurate. A time-bound request to check the email link adds\nurgency and is likely to make victims click without thinking.\n\n[This is a variant of the more classic payroll diversion fraud, where cybercriminals](https://www.armorblox.com/blog/payroll-fraud-when-direct-deposits-go-rogue)\nimpersonate employees and try to divert payroll funds to their own accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Payslip scam email with a Google Docs link**\n\n### Google service used\n\nThe link in the email leads to a page hosted on Google Docs. Since Google Docs is ever\npresent in our daily lives, the average recipient wouldn’t be surprised to see a Google Docs\nlink in an email from a colleague. It won’t be blocked by any email security filter either - not\non Day 0, at any rate. Using a Google Doc in this email is meant to trick both the recipient’s\neye test and traditional security layers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: The link in the email leads to a Google Doc that claims to contain payslip**\n**information**\n\n### Other techniques used\n\nImpersonation: Payroll team.\nTargeted email: The email title and body have the recipient’s name to increase\nlegitimacy.\nSocial engineering: Finance-related email with a time-bound request to take action\n(check if your personal data is correct by 5pm).\nLink redirections: The email links to the Google Doc, which further redirects to the final\nphishing page (which has now been taken down). These redirections obfuscate link\ndetection technologies from identifying the URL as malicious.\n\n## 5. Microsoft Teams Credential Phishing\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Summary of the Microsoft Teams credential phishing attack**\n\n### Attack summary\n\nThis email claimed to come from the company’s IT team and asked readers to review a\n[secure message their colleagues had shared over Microsoft Teams, a popular business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)\ncollaboration solution. Clicking the link took the targets to a page resembling Microsoft\nTeams, which further redirected to the credential phishing site resembling the Office 365\nlogin portal.\n\n[Visit this link if you’d like to learn more about this credential phishing attack.](https://www.armorblox.com/blog/blox-tales-microsoft-teams-credential-phishing)\n\n### Google service used\n\nThe Office 365 login portal was hosted on Google Sites, a wiki and web page creation tool\nthat lowers the skill bar needed to create websites. The malice of the page’s intent was\nhidden behind the legitimacy of the page’s domain. This page would pass most eye tests\nduring busy mornings (which is when the email was sent out), with people happily assuming\nit to be a legitimate Microsoft page.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig: Phishing page for the Microsoft Teams attack was hosted on Google Sites**\n\n### Other techniques used\n\nImpersonation: IT team + Microsoft Teams\nSocial engineering: Request to view ‘secure’ messages sent over Microsoft Teams\n\n## Guidance and Recommendations\n\n### 1. Follow 2FA and password management best practices\n\nSince all workplace accounts are so closely interlinked, losing access to your Google\naccount can prove to be very dangerous as cybercriminals send emails in your name to your\ncustomers, partners, and loved ones. If you haven’t already, follow these hygiene best\npractices:\n\nDeploy two-factor authentication (2FA) on all possible business and personal accounts.\nUse a password manager to store your various account passwords.\nDon’t repeat passwords across accounts or use generic passwords such as your birth\ndate, ‘password123’, ‘YourName123’ etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2. Subject sensitive emails to rigorous eye tests\n\nWhenever possible, engage with emails related to money and data in a rational manner.\nSubject the email to an eye test that includes inspecting the sender name, sender email\naddress, language within the email, and any logical inconsistencies within the email (e.g.\n_why is this childless widow willing to send me millions of dollars?)._\n\n### 3. Create your own lines of authentication\n\nYou should try to replicate 2FA, even if in a loose sense, for any email that makes unusual\nrequests related to money or data. For example, did your HR rep just email you some payroll\ndetails with a Google Doc requesting more information urgently? Call or text the HR rep and\nconfirm that they sent the email. Even if your colleagues are very busy, they will understand\nand appreciate your caution.\n\n### 4. Augment native email threat detection with additional controls\n\n[To augment existing email security capabilities (e.g. Exchange Online Protection for Office](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/exchange-online-protection-overview?view=o365-worldwide)\n[365 or the Advanced Protection Program for G Suite), organizations should invest in](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)\ntechnologies that take a materially different approach to threat detection. Rather than\nsearching through static lists and blocking known bad domains, these technologies should\nlearn from custom organizational data and be able to stop socially engineered threats that\ncontain zero-day payloads like Google Forms, Docs, or pages built on Google Sites.\n\nFor more email security threat research, news, and industry guidance, sign up for email\nupdates from Armorblox below. We promise to only email you useful information. We also\npromise not to include any Google Docs or Forms in these emails that ask for your personal\ninformation, although that should go without saying :-)\n\n\n-----",
