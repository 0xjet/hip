    "plain_text": "# Jury Convicts Chinese Intelligence Officer of Espionage Crimes, Attempting to Steal Trade Secrets\n\n**[justice.gov/opa/pr/jury-convicts-chinese-intelligence-officer-espionage-crimes-attempting-steal-trade-secrets](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/jury-convicts-chinese-intelligence-officer-espionage-crimes-attempting-steal-trade-secrets)**\n\nNovember 5, 2021\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nFriday, November 5, 2021\n\nA federal jury today convicted Yanjun Xu, a Chinese national and Deputy Division Director of\nthe Sixth Bureau of the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security, of conspiring to and\nattempting to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. The defendant is the\nfirst Chinese intelligence officer to be extradited to the United States to stand trial.\n\n“This conviction of a card-carrying intelligence officer for economic espionage underscores\nthat trade secret theft is integral to the PRC government’s plans to modernize its industries,”\nsaid Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National\nSecurity Division. “But this conviction also serves notice that the United States will not sit by\nas China, or any other nation-state, attempts to steal instead of researching and developing\nkey technology. Instead, and with the support of our allies, we will continue to investigate,\nprosecute, and hold accountable those who try to take the fruits of American ingenuity\nillegally.”\n\n“The jury, by its guilty verdict here today, held Xu accountable for his classic spy techniques,”\nsaid Acting U.S. Attorney Vipal J. Patel for the Southern District of Ohio. “Xu conspired to\ncommit economic espionage on behalf of the Chinese government, and he tried to steal the\nvaluable innovation and trade secrets of industry-leading American aviation technology\n\n\n-----\n\ncompanies. This office will continue to seek to protect American innovation and hold\naccountable those who attempt to steal our nation’s science and technology, regardless of\nstatus or affiliation, whether civilian, military or spy.”\n\n“This was state-sponsored economic espionage by the PRC designed to steal American\ntechnology and put Americans out of work,” said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the\nFBI’s Counterintelligence Division. “For those who doubt the real goals of the PRC, this\nshould be a wakeup call; they are stealing American technology to benefit their economy and\nmilitary. The FBI is partnering with over 50 U.S. Government agencies to share information\nand investigative resources to stop the PRC’s illegal activities.”\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, beginning in at least\nDecember 2013, Xu used multiple aliases to target specific companies in the United States\nand abroad that are recognized as leaders in the field of aviation. He identified experts who\nworked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise\nthat they were traveling to give a presentation at a university. Xu and others paid the experts\nstipends on top of covering travel costs. According to today’s conviction, Xu attempted to\nsteal technology related to GE Aviation’s exclusive composite aircraft engine fan – which no\nother company in the world has been able to duplicate – to benefit the Chinese state.\n\nIn March 2017, a GE Aviation employee in Cincinnati, Ohio, was solicited to give a report at\na university in China. The employee traveled to China two months later to present at the\nuniversity and was introduced to Xu. Xu and others paid the employee’s travel expenses and\na stipend.\n\nIn January 2018, Xu requested “system specification, design process” information from the\nemployee and – with the cooperation of the company, who was working with the FBI – the\nemployee emailed a two-page document from the company that included a label that warned\nabout the disclosure of proprietary information.\n\nIn February 2018, Xu began discussing with the employee the possibility of meeting in\nEurope during one of the employee’s business trips and asked the employee to send a copy\nof the file directory for his company-issued computer.\n\nXu traveled to Belgium on April 1, 2018, to meet with the employee and was arrested at that\ntime.\n\nXu was convicted of two counts of conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage,\nwhich carries a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison for each count and a fine of\nup to $5 million. Xu was also convicted of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft and two\ncounts of attempted theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum statutory sentence of 10\nyears in prison for each count and a $250,000 fine. A federal district court judge will\ndetermine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory\nfactors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI investigated the case.\n\nAssistant Deputy Criminal Chief Timothy S. Mangan and Deputy Criminal Chief Emily\nGlatfelter for the Southern District of Ohio and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie of the\nNational Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting\nthe case.\n\nThe Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs secured Xu’s extradition to the United\nStates, with valuable assistance provided by the government of Belgium and the Belgian\nFederal Police.\n\n\n-----",
