Consequently, the\nransomware demands that the victims pay ransom for a decryption tool to recover their data.\n\nBased on analysis by Cyble Research Labs, we have observed that the executable .exe file is a\nconsole-based application that requests for user input. In general, this behavior is not observed in\nstealthy ransomware. It is likely that after compromising the infrastructure, the Threat Actors (TAs)\ndeploys the ransomware manually.\n\nTo compromise the infrastructure, TAs leverage various techniques such as exploiting the vulnerable\nassets exposed on the Internet.\n\nThe VENOMOUS ransomware group has given the following tor website details in their ransom\nnote hxxp://3udp4kspxiirvxop[.]onion/.\n\nWe have shown the complete execution flow of the VENOMOUS ransomware in figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 Execution Flow\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found that the malware is a console-based x64 architecture executable written in Python during our\nstatic analysis. Refer to Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\n\nMalware Payload Static Information\nAfter encrypting the files, the ransomware payload drops the ransom note named “SORRY-FOR_FILES.txt”, as shown in Figure 3._\n\nFigure 3 Ransom Note\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the above ransom note, the TAs have given a Telegram support ID\n_“hxxps://t[.]me/venomous_support” with the victim’s unique ID. The attackers ask the victims to contact_\nthem and pay the ransom amount in Bitcoin (BTC) to get the decryptor program.\n\nUpon execution, the ransomware payload checks if config file is present. Refer to Figure 4.\n\nIf the config is present, the malware gets the unique ID from the config file and asks the users to\nenter the key to encrypt the files.\nIf config file is not present, the malware creates a new config file, obtains the unique ID and then\nasks for the key.\nOptionally, if the TAs do not want to use the same unique ID, the malware creates a new config\nfile having a unique ID and asks users to enter the key to encrypt the data.\n\nFigure 4 Asking for Key to\n\nEncrypt Files\nAfter execution, the malware encrypts the files and appends the extension as “.venomnous” Refer to\nFigure 5.\n\nFigure 5 Encrypted Files\n\nAfter encrypting the files on the victim’s machine, the malware adds an Initialization Vector (IV) in the\nencrypted file, which is unique for each file, as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6 IV Added After Encryption\n\nThe ransomware then attempts to kill the mssql, MySQL, SQLiserver processes, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 Modification of Services\nSince the malware payload has been developed in Python, we tried to extract the source code from the\nexecutable. Refer to Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8 Extracting Source Code from Executable\nAfter extracting the source code from the malware payload, we found encoded Python files. We\nobserved that the file containing the complete source code is “sqli-servere“, so we appended its\nextension to .pyc and tried to decompile it, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 Extracted Encoded Source Code\nWhile conducting the decompilation process, we inserted 16 bytes of magic values as “55 0D 0D 0A 00\n_00 00 00 92 D4 5F 5F 86 2E 00 00” to the file. Refer to Figure 10._\n\nFigure 10 Inserting 16 Bytes of Magic Values\nAfter appending the file, we were able to decompile the Python source code successfully, as shown in\nFigure 11.\n\nFigure 11 Decoded Python Source Code\n\n### Code Analysis\n\nThe below source code demonstrates the ransomware payload checking whether the config file is\npresent. Then, it will obtain the unique ID and requests the encryption key as input from the user. Refer\nto Figure 12.\n\nFigure 12 Payload Asks for Unique ID for Encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below source code demonstrates that the ransomware is excluding certain folders and files from\nencryption.\n\nFigure 13 Malware Excludes Directories and Files from Encryption\nThe source code shown here demonstrates that the ransomware is trying to kill the mssql, MySQL,\n_SQLi processes, to encrypt databases._\n\nFigure 14 Payload is\n\nTries to Kill MySQL, MySQL, and sqli Applications\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile analyzing the Python code, we found that the ransomware uses Advanced Encryption Standard\n(AES) algorithms to encrypt the files. The IV is generated for each file and is used during the encryption\nprocess.\n\nFigure 15 Malware Payload is Using AES Algorithms to Encrypt the Files\nThe below source code demonstrates that after encrypting the files, the malware will drop a ransom\nnote named “SORRY-FOR-FILES.txt” in various places on the victim’s machine. Refer to Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16 Drops Ransom Note\nThe below source code demonstrates that after completing encryption activities, the malware\nterminates its processes.\n\nFigure 17 Payload is Trying to Kill Its Process\nThe threat actors have given their TOR website in the ransom note –\n**hxxp://3udp4kspxiirvxop[.]onion/ .**\n\n[In this website, they have mentioned email ID venomous.files@tutanota[.]com and Telegram ID](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:venomous.files@tutanota%5B.%5Dcom)\n**hxxps://t[.]me/venomous_support to communicate with the victims for demanding the ransom as**\nshown in Figure 18.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18\n\nRansomware Tor Website\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRansomware groups continue to pose a severe threat to firms and individuals. Organizations need to\nstay ahead of the techniques used by these TAs. Victims of ransomware risk losing their valuable data\ndue to such attacks, which leads to financial loss and loss of productivity.\n\nSince malware payload is a console-based application and the key value from the user, generally, this\nbehavior is not present in the typical ransomware. We suspect that this ransomware has been\ndeveloped for collaborating with affiliates.\n\nCyble Research Labs is continuously monitoring VENOMOUS’s extortion campaign, and we will keep our\nreaders up to date with new information.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow these suggestions given below:\n\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\n\n\n-----\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n**Initial Access** [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\n\n**DefenseEvasion** [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)\n[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)\n[T1562.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/)\n\n**Discovery** [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)\n[T1135](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135)\n\n**Impact** [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n[T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n\n\n[Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)\n[Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)\nImpair Defences: Disable or Modify Tools\n\n[File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)\n[Network Share Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135)\n\nData Encrypted for Impact\nInhibit System Recovery\n\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): \n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n4fb7ed41b7b482bc52c5a2c113b86911d86ef3d1ba1a4651a189b4bbb1901fa6 SHA256 HASH\n\nhxxp://3udp4kspxiirvxop[.]onion/ URL URL\n\n\nhxxps://t[.]me/venomous_support Telegram\nID\n\n## About Us\n\n\nTA Contact\n\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from](https://cyble.com/)\ncybercrimes and exposure in the Darkweb.
