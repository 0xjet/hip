We named this payload WinorDLL64 based on its filename\nWinorDLL64.dll. Wslink, which had the filename WinorLoaderDLL64.dll, is a loader for\nWindows binaries that, unlike other such loaders, runs as a server and executes received\nmodules in memory. As the wording suggests, a loader serves as a tool to load a payload, or\nthe actual malware, onto the already compromised system. The initial Wslink compromise\nvector has not been identified.\n\nThe initially unknown Wslink payload was uploaded to VirusTotal from South Korea shortly\nafter the publication of our blogpost, and hit one of our YARA rules based on Wslink’s unique\nname WinorDLL64. Regarding Wslink, ESET telemetry has seen only a few detections – in\nCentral Europe, North America, and the Middle East.\n\nThe WinorDLL64 payload serves as a backdoor that most notably acquires extensive system\ninformation, provides means for file manipulation, such as exfiltrating, overwriting, and\nremoving files, and executes additional commands. Interestingly, it communicates over a\nconnection that was already established by the Wslink loader.\n\nIn 2021, we did not find any data that would suggest Wslink is a tool from a known threat\nactor. However, after an extensive analysis of the payload, we have attributed WinorDLL64 to\nthe Lazarus APT group with low confidence based on the targeted region and an overlap in\n\n\n-----\n\nboth behavior and code with known Lazarus samples.\n\nActive since at least 2009, this infamous North-Korea aligned group is responsible for high[profile incidents such as both the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/12/08/sony-pictures-hacking-traced-thai-hotel-north-korea-denies-involvement/)\n[dollar cyberheists in 2016, the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/03/15/bangladesh-central-bank-boss-quits-100m-cyberheist/) [WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, and a long](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/15/wannacryptor-key-questions-answered/)\n[history of disruptive attacks against South Korean public and critical infrastructure since at](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)\nleast 2011. US-CERT and the FBI call this group [HIDDEN COBRA.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/northkorea)\n\n[Based on our extensive knowledge of the activities and operations of this group, we believe](https://www.welivesecurity.com/?s=lazarus)\nthat Lazarus consists of a large team that is systematically organized, well prepared, and is\nmade up of several subgroups that utilize a large toolset. Last year, we discovered a Lazarus\n[tool that took advantage of the CVE‑2021‑21551 vulnerability to target an employee of an](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21551)\naerospace company in the Netherlands, and a political journalist in Belgium. It was the first\nrecorded abuse of the vulnerability; in combination, the tool and the vulnerability led to the\nblinding of the monitoring of all security solutions on compromised machines. We also\n[provided an extensive description of the structure of the virtual machine used in samples of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/28/under-hood-wslink-multilayered-virtual-machine/)\nWslink.\n\nThis blogpost explains the attribution of WinorDLL64 to Lazarus and provides an analysis of\nthe payload.\n\n## Links to Lazarus\n\nWe have discovered overlaps in both behavior and code with Lazarus samples from Operation\nGhostSecret and the [Bankshot implant described by McAfee. The description of the implants](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/hidden-cobra-targets-turkish-financial-sector-new-bankshot-implant/)\nin both GhostSecret and Bankshot articles contains overlaps in the functionality with\nWinorDLL64 and we found some code overlap in the samples. In this blogpost we will only\nuse the FE887FCAB66D7D7F79F05E0266C0649F0114BA7C sample from GhostSecret for\ncomparison against WinorDLL64 (1BA443FDE984CEE85EBD4D4FA7EB1263A6F1257F),\nunless specified otherwise.\n\nThe following details summarize the supporting facts for our low confidence attribution to\nLazarus:\n\n### 1. Victimology\n\nFellow researchers from AhnLab confirmed South Korean victims of Wslink in their\ntelemetry, which is a relevant indicator considering the traditional Lazarus targets and\nthat we have observed only a few hits.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Reported South Korean victim, where mstoned7 is the researcher from Ahnlab_\n\n### 2. Malware\n\nThe latest GhostSecret sample reported by McAfee\n(FE887FCAB66D7D7F79F05E0266C0649F0114BA7C) is from February 2018; we\nspotted the first sample of Wslink in late 2018 and fellow researchers reported hits in\nAugust 2018, which they disclosed after our publication. Hence, these samples were\nspotted a relatively short period of time apart.\nThe [PE rich headers indicate that the same development environment and projects of](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/01/vb2019-paper-rich-headers-leveraging-mysterious-artifact-pe-format/)\nsimilar size were used in several other known Lazarus samples (e.g.,\n70DE783E5D48C6FBB576BC494BAF0634BC304FD6;\n8EC9219303953396E1CB7105CDB18ED6C568E962). We found this overlap using the\nfollowing rules that cover only these Wslink and Lazarus samples, which is an indicator\n[with a low weight. We tested them on VirusTotal’s retrohunt and our internal file corpus.](https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001293377-Retrohunt)\n\nrich_signature.length == 80 and\n\npe.rich_signature.toolid(175, 30319) == 7 and\n\npe.rich_signature.toolid(155, 30319) == 1 and\n\npe.rich_signature.toolid(158, 30319) == 10 and\n\npe.rich_signature.toolid(170, 30319) >= 90 and\n\npe.rich_signature.toolid(170, 30319) <= 108\n\nThis rule can be translated to the following notation that is more readable and used by\nVirusTotal, where one can see the product version and build ID (VS2010 build 30319), number\nand type of source/object files used ([LTCG C++] where LTCG stands for Link Time Code\nGeneration, [ASM], [ C ]), and number of exports ([EXP]) in the rule:\n\n[LTCG C++] VS2010 build 30319 count=7\n\n[EXP] VS2010 build 30319 count=1\n\n[ASM] VS2010 build 30319 count=10\n\n[ C ] VS2010 build 30319 count in [ 90 .. 108 ]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GhostSecret article described a unique data-gathering and implant-installation\ncomponent that listens on port 443 for inbound control server connections” that\nadditionally ran as a service. This is an accurate description of Wslink downloader\nbehavior, apart from the port number, which can vary based on the configuration. To sum\nit up, even though the implementation is different, both serve the same purpose.\nThe loader is virtualized by Oreans’ Code Virtualizer, which is a commercial protector\nthat is used [frequently by Lazarus.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)\n[The loader uses the MemoryModule library to load modules directly from memory. The](https://github.com/fancycode/MemoryModule)\nlibrary is not commonly used by malware, but it is quite popular among North Koreaaligned groups such as Lazarus and Kimsuky.\nOverlap in the code between WinorDLL64 and GhostSecret that we found during our\nanalysis.

Wslink sending a file_\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nWinorDLL64 serves as a backdoor that most notably acquires extensive system information,\nprovides means for file manipulation, and executes additional commands. Interestingly, it\ncommunicates over a TCP connection that was already established by its loader and uses\nsome of the loader’s functions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Visualization of Wslink’s communication_\n\nThe backdoor is a DLL with a single unnamed export that accepts one parameter – a structure\n[for communication that was already described in our previous blogpost. The structure contains](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/10/27/wslink-unique-undocumented-malicious-loader-runs-server/)\na TLS-context – socket, key, IV – and callbacks for sending and receiving messages\nencrypted with 256-bit AES-CBC that enable WinorDLL64 to exchange data securely with the\noperator over an already established connection.\n\nThe following facts lead us to believe with high confidence that the library is indeed part of\nWslink:\n\nThe unique structure is used everywhere in the expected way, e.g., the TLS-context and\nother meaningful parameters are supplied in the anticipated order to the correct\ncallbacks.\nThe name of the DLL is WinorDLL64.dll and Wslink’s name was WinorLoaderDLL64.dll.\n\nWinorDLL64 accepts several commands. Figure 5 displays the loop that receives and handles\ncommands. Each command is bound to a unique ID and accepts a configuration that contains\nadditional parameters.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. The main part of the backdoor’s command-receiving loop_\n\nThe command list, with our labels, is in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6. The command list_\n\nTable 2 contains a summary of the WinorDLL64 commands, where modified, and old\ncategories refer to the relationship to the previously documented GhostSecret functionality.\nWe highlight only significant changes in the modified category.\n\n_Table 2.
