Check Point customers remain protected\n\n### Background\n\nA ransomware gang named Lapsus$, which took responsibility for last week’s breach on\nthe giant chip firm [NVidia, claims it has now managed to breach the Korean manufacturer](https://www.secureworld.io/industry-news/nvidia-source-code-breach)\nSamsung, and published 190GB of sensitive data online.\n\nBreaches to major companies aren’t a new thing, though in this case the attacker has not\njust stolen credentials or business related content, it went directly to the crown jewel, which\nis the source code of some of the companies’ proprietary firmware.\n\n**Supply chain attacks have grown to unprecedented sizes in recent years**\n\nHaving possession and controls over such source codes might create a massive supply\nchain reaction, which can lead to numerous organizations and machines being infected and\nharmed as both, NVidia’s and Samsung’s firmware and hardware are massively distributed\nglobally.\n\nThe scenario, later described in details, enables malware to enter machines, even if these\nare supposedly protected by security technology, by having stolen certificates signed and\nverified as legitimate and trustworthy, when in fact there are malware in disguise.\n\n[As well as being one of the top trends in the global cyber security landscape globally,](https://pages.checkpoint.com/cyber-security-report-2022.html)\n[supply chain attacks have increased in numbers and reach over the past year,, even](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-a-supply-chain-attack/)\ncompromising major organizations like US government departments, such as homeland\nsecurity offices.\n\n[In their official public response, NVidia announced: “We have no evidence](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5333)\nof [ransomware being deployed on the NVIDIA environment or that this is related to the](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/ransomware/)\nRussia-Ukraine conflict. However, we are aware that the threat actor took employee\npasswords and some NVIDIA proprietary information from our systems and has begun\nleaking it online.”\n\n\n-----\n\n[Samsung officially responded and confirmed the breach on Monday, March 7th: There was](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/samsung-says-hackers-breached-company-data-galaxy-source-code)\na security breach relating to certain internal company data,” said a Samsung official.\n“According to our initial analysis, the breach involves some source code relating to the\noperation of Galaxy devices, but does not include the personal information of our\nconsumers or employees. Currently, we do not anticipate any impact to our business or\ncustomers”\n\n**What do we know on the recent breaches by Lapsus$?**\n\n[Through an official notice, NVidia acknowledged that they became aware of “a cyber](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5333)\nsecurity incident, which impacted IT resources. Lapsus$ claimed responsibility and were\nasking Nvidia to remove its lite hash rate (LHR) feature. The LHR was created to limit\nEthereum mining capabilities in its RTX 30 series graphics cards, as the cryptomining\ncommunity depleted the stock in early 2021. The group is also asking Nvidia to open-source\nits GPU drivers for macOS, Windows, and Linux devices.\n\nFailing to meet their demands, Lapsus$ threatened to publish NVidia’s source code, which\nis used in drivers and firmware. Yet, the gang did not stop there. On March 5 theyth\n[published nearly 190GB of sensitive date obtained from the Korean technology giant,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-190gb-of-alleged-samsung-data-source-code/)\nSamsung.\n\nThe group first published a snapshot of C/C++ instructions on Samsung´s software followed\nwith a description of the upcoming leak, stating that it included confidential Samsung´s\nsource code\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Telegram\n\n[In a later official confirmation, Samsung did confirm that almost 200GB of confidential data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/samsung-says-hackers-breached-company-data-galaxy-source-code)\nwhich includes source code for various technologies and algorithms for biometric unlock\noperations has been breached.\n\n**How can stolen signed certificates deliver malware?**\n\nAs part of the NVidia´s leak were indeed two stolen code-signing certificates used by NVidia\ndevelopers to sign their drivers and executables.\nAccording to different [sources, attackers already started using this code signing certificates](https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1499437244830175236/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499437244830175236%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bleepingcomputer.com%2Fnews%2Fsecurity%2Fmalware-now-using-nvidias-stolen-code-signing-certificates%2F)\nto sign malware so it will appear to be dependable and go through Windows´ screening to\nbe loaded and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nCode signing certificate actually enables a digital signature on executables and drivers to\nallow them and mark them as “cleared”. Using these stolen certificates, attackers are\npractically disguising files and executables as legitimate and might bypass security means,\n[allowing malware to be uploaded to Windows.](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-malware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Telegram\n\nThe Samsung leak also allegedly includes bootloader source code for recent Samsung´s\ndevices, algorithms for all biometric unlock operations, source code for Samsung’s\nactivation servers, the full source code used to authenticate Samsung accounts, and secret\nQualcomm source code.\nCheck Point Research´s (CPR) teams are constantly monitoring the situation in search for\nadditional potential threats that might surface. We will update accordingly.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Prevention first – What you need to do to remain protected\n\nOrganizations should be mainly concerned about malware penetration into their corporate\nnetwork via the aforementioned stolen certificates.\n\nUnfortunately, some security solutions in the market still expose organizations to this supply\nchain threat, as they seem to automatically revoke the stolen certificates, most probably\nsince they consider the vendor who produced the certificate as trusted by default.\n\nTo keep your entire IT infrastructure safe, we recommend ensuring your network security\ngateways, as well as your endpoint device security solutions, have been updated with the\nappropriate protection against the stolen certificates. We also recommend that you\ndownload software updates from the formal vendor website and update your entire\nworkforce to do the same.\n\n### Check Point´s customers remain protected\n\nCheck Point´s customers gain preemptive protection from any supply chain attack that may\narise from the stolen certificates.\n\nUnfortunately, some security solutions in the market still expose organizations to this supply\nchain threat, as they seem to automatically approve the stolen certificates, even though\nthey’ve already been revoked, most probably since they consider the vendor who produced\nthe certificate as trusted by default.\n\nWhether you’re using Check Point to secure your network cloud or workforce, you gain\naccurate prevention against the threat mentioned above through Check Point ThreatCloud.\n\nThreatCloud combines 60+ threat prevention and AI technologies with globally-shared\nthreat intelligence derived from hundreds of millions of sensors worldwide, and enriched\nwith insights from Check Point Research.\n\nThe products below leverage Check Point ThreatCloud’s threat emulation service, an\n[innovative zero-day sandboxing technology, to detect and block these stolen certificates](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-sandboxing/)\nfrom penetrating. This process is fully automated and does not require any action by the\nuser.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n**[Check Point Quantum security gatewayswill protect your network and data centers](https://www.checkpoint.com/quantum/)**\nfrom malware.\n**[Check Point Harmony Endpoint, complete endpoint protection, and EDR solution](https://www.checkpoint.com/harmony/advanced-endpoint-protection/)**\nwill protect your employees from downloading malicious files or executables to work\nlaptops and PCs and prevent data leak and lateral movement of malware to other\nsystems.\n**[Check Point Harmony Mobile, the industry’s leading Mobile Threat Defense solution,](https://www.checkpoint.com/harmony/advanced-endpoint-protection/)**\nwill prevent employees from downloading malicious files and applications and\ntherefore prevent the compromise of sensitive business data.\n\n\n-----",
