We have tracked activity linked to\nthis group since November 2014 in order to protect organizations from APT39 activity to\ndate. APT39’s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from other\n[Iranian groups FireEye tracks, which have been linked to influence operations,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/report-suspected-iranian-influence-operation) disruptive\nattacks, and other threats. APT39 likely focuses on personal information to support\nmonitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations that serve Iran’s national priorities, or\npotentially to create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns.\n\nAPT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and\nits activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as \"Chafer.\" However, there are\ndifferences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations\ntrack activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors\nalong with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39's targeting scope is\nglobal, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the\ntelecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that\nsupport it and the high-tech industry. The countries and industries targeted by APT39 are\ndepicted in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nCountries and industries targeted by APT39\n\n\nFigure 1: Countries and industries targeted by APT39\n\n**Operational Intent**\n\nAPT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform\nmonitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect\nproprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic\nrequirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to\nfacilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary\nintent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting\ndata supports the belief that APT39's key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest,\ncollect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from\ntelecommunications firms.\n\n**Iran Nexus Indicators**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have moderate confidence APT39 operations are conducted in support of Iranian\nnational interests based on regional targeting patterns focused in the Middle East,\ninfrastructure, timing, and similarities to APT34, a group that loosely aligns with activity\npublicly reported as “OilRig”. While APT39 and APT34 share some similarities, including\nmalware distribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure nomenclature, and\ntargeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to be distinct from APT34 given its use of a different\nPOWBAT variant. It is possible that these groups work together or share resources at some\nlevel.\n\n**Attack Lifecycle**\n\nAPT39 uses a variety of custom and publicly available malware and tools at all stages of the\nattack lifecycle.\n\n_Initial Compromise_\n\nFor initial compromise, FireEye Intelligence has observed APT39 leverage spear phishing\nemails with malicious attachments and/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT\ninfection. APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate\nweb services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this\ngroup has routinely identified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted organizations\nto install web shells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and used stolen legitimate credentials\nto compromise externally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) resources.\n\n_Establish Foothold, Escalate Privileges, and Internal Reconnaissance_\n\nPost-compromise, APT39 leverages custom backdoors such as SEAWEED,\nCACHEMONEY, and a unique variant of POWBAT to establish a foothold in a target\nenvironment. During privilege escalation, freely available tools such as Mimikatz and Ncrack\nhave been observed, in addition to legitimate tools such as Windows Credential Editor and\nProcDump. Internal reconnaissance has been performed using custom scripts and both\nfreely available and custom tools such as the port scanner, BLUETORCH.\n\n_Lateral Movement, Maintain Presence, and Complete Mission_\n\nAPT39 facilitates lateral movement through myriad tools such as Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), PsExec, RemCom, and xCmdSvc. Custom tools such as\nREDTRIP, PINKTRIP, and BLUETRIP have also been used to create SOCKS5 proxies\nbetween infected hosts. In addition to using RDP for lateral movement, APT39 has used this\nprotocol to maintain persistence in a victim environment. To complete its mission, APT39\ntypically archives stolen data with compression tools such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT39 attack lifecycle\n\n\nFigure 2: APT39 attack lifecycle\nThere are some indications that APT39 demonstrated a penchant for operational security to\nbypass detection efforts by network defenders, including the use of a modified version of\nMimikatz that was repacked to thwart anti-virus detection in one case, as well as another\ninstance when after gaining initial access APT39 performed credential harvesting outside of\na compromised entity's environment to avoid detection.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nWe believe APT39's significant targeting of the telecommunications and travel industries\nreflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for the\npurposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations. Telecommunications firms are\nattractive targets given that they store large amounts of personal and customer information,\nprovide access to critical infrastructure used for communications, and enable access to a\nwide range of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39's targeting not only\n\n\n-----\n\nrepresents a threat to known targeted industries, but it extends to these organizations\nclientele, which includes a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a global scale. APT39's\nactivity showcases Iran's potential global operational reach and how it uses cyber operations\nas a low-cost and effective tool to facilitate the collection of key data on perceived national\nsecurity threats and gain advantages against regional and global rivals.\n\n\n-----",
