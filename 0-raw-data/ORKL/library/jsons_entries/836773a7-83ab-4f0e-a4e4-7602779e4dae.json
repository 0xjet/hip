While analyzing the campaign we\ndiscovered several important aspects of this ransomware including operational similarity\nwith previous ransomware families such as Darkside, Blackmatter and Revil. It is\nunderstood that Blackcat is potentially actively recruiting affiliates to increase proliferation\nand offering lucrative financial deals related to profit sharing of up to 90% in some cases.\n\nBlackcat has potentially been attributed to a spate of recent attacks spread across various\ncritical sectors such as energy, transportation and utilities.\n\nThis threat actor Is continuously updating their services and adding features and modifying\ntheir code to provide advanced penetration capabilities for It’s affiliates. Keeping track of\nthis threat groups activities Is extremely crucial and organisations can stay updated by\nkeeping an eye on the IOC's and updates being provided by the Trellix ATR team via our\nThreat Dashboard and Trellix Insights platform.\n\n**Figure 1: Trellix Insights - Blackcat Campaign**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Attack Analysis**\nAn analysis of the attack flow shows typical pre-execution and post execution stages of a\nransomware incident. The initial access is gained either via leaked credentials or through\nexposed remote access software. Following this it is clear the threat actor spends a good\namount of time compromising various defenses such as Windows Defender, enabling\nbetter data exfiltration by increasing connection limits on remote connections, discovering\nnetwork shares etc. The actual encryption part seems to come at later stage similar to what\nwe have seen with other Ransomware families such as Darkside etc.\n\n## Why Is this Important?\n\nSo what makes BlackCat different than previous ransomware as a service operators? the\nanswer is many. This ransomware has been written using a programming language known\nas “Rust” diverging from common programing languages such as C/C++ in which previous\nransomwares has been written in and is more widely understood and analyzed by threat\nresearchers and defenders. The advantage of using “Rust” is maximum platform support in\nterms of OS that this ransomware can be executed on, potentially hugely widening the\nexposure for organisations. The next aspect is customization capabilities available in the\nmalware and how it has embedded a lot of disparate capabilities in a modular selfcontained package, it even has a help menu! Perfectly suitable for newbie affiliates. The\nnotable capabilities include embedded PsExec, Powershell process migration capabilities\nand ability to infect VMWare ESXi services. The configuration options shown bellow allows\nthe affiliates to customize how they execute the ransomware in the victims environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Two different Blackcat Samples showing different capabilities**\n\n**Figure 4: Blackcat embedded configuration file with victim specific data preloaded**\nThe most important aspect is possibly the fact that during analysis we discovered that each\nsample had configuration files embedded that included information such as Usernames and\npasswords for the target victims to facilitate lateral movement(potentially gathered from\nprevious breaches or bought password dumps). We also noticed that a unique access\ntoken is used to generate an unique victim identifier and a unique link for Blackcat’s “Tor”\nwebpage for the ransomware negotiations to take place. This is specifically designed to\nkeep security researchers and law enforcement out of the conversations as well as\ndefeating some automated sandboxing capabilities that does not inject sample specific\nattributes.\n\n## Defenders Guidance\n\nOne of the hardest part of this ransomware family is keeping track of prevalence\ninformation. The reason being that almost every sample has a different set of IOC's\nassociated with it(hash, tor url, access tokens, config files). So this is where we have to\nresort to more advanced behavioral characteristics and properties of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nEstablishing relationship between the various samples might be extremely important at an\nearly stage of an attack to understand the threat actor and their associated tactics, a new\nfeature added to Trellix Insights provides just that:\n\n**Figure 5: Sample relationship based on similarity and campaign relationship**\nLike with every ransomware attack the signs of the presence of the threat actor are visible\nIn the early part of the attack lifecycle. Use of LOLBins and Dual Intent tools to land and\nexpand are critical signals that should be captured by defenders, both EDR and ENS ATP\nprovides early visibility Into the pre-execution phase of the attack as well as Post execution\nphases.\n\n**Figure 6: Post Execution ENS ATP Detections for RealProtect**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: EDR Analysis of Blackcat Sample**\nPoint to be noted here is that depending on the sample the data collected EDR trace\nanalysis could appear differently. Having behavioral analysis and protection capabilities is\ncritical for defenders during our testing both ENS Realprotect static and cloud got trigged\nand Enhanced remediation recovered the encrypted systems successfully.\n\n**Figure 8: Encrypted Endpoint**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Endpoint Rolled Back**\nBeing able to analyze threats fully and understand its behavior is crucial especially in a\nmalware that is changing its attributes rapidly, Trellix Detection on Demand provides\nadditional sampling capability along with endpoint integration to further enhance defenses\nand detection capabilities.\n\n**Figure 10: Trellix Detection on Demand analysis providing additional details, dropped**\n**payloads and registry changes as well as complete behavioral analysis**\n\n## Summary\n\nOrganisations need to build resilient defenses against ransomware threats and not rely on\nsingle control/defenses, we can expect to continue to see more innovation from threat\nactors such as the ones highlighted here, fundamentally the following provides an effective\nsecurity strategy against ransomware threats\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: Ransomware Defense Strategy**\n\n### Featured Content\n\nPERSPECTIVES\n\n### Our CEO On Living Security\n\nBy [Bryan Palma · January 19, 2022](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/bryan-palma.html)\n\nTrellix CEO, Bryan Palma, explains the critical need for security that’s always learning.\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/perspectives/our-ceo-on-living-security.html)\n\nXDR\n\n### Time to Drive Change by Challenging the Challengers\n\nBy [Michelle Salvado · January 19, 2022](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/michelle-salvado.html)\n\nDynamic threats call for dynamic security – the path to resiliency lies in XDR.\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/xdr/time-to-drive-change-by-challenging-the-challengers.html)\n\nTHREAT LABS\n\n### 2022 Threat Predictions\n\n\n-----\n\nBy Trellix · January 19, 2022\n\nWhat cyber security threats should enterprises look out for in 2022?\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/2022-threat-predictions.html)\n\n## Get the latest\n\nWe’re no strangers to cybersecurity.
