This work may reveal other members of the ransomware group as\nwell as affiliates that deployed the malware and ransomed victims across the world.\n\nBoth the investigation and the legal procedures are ongoing at the moment.\n\n## Three more DoppelPaymer suspects wanted\n\nGerman authorities believe that the DoppelPaymer ransomware operation involved five core\nmembers that maintained the attack infrastructure, the data leak sites, handled negotiations,\nand deployed the malware on breached networks.\n\nArrest warrants have been issued for another three suspects that law enforcement are\ncurrently looking for worldwide:\n\nIgor Garshin/Garschin - believed to be responsible for reconnaissance, breaching, and\ndeploying the DoppelPaymer locker on victim networks\nlgor Olegovich Turashev - believed to have had a major part in attacks against German\ncompanies, acting as the admin of the infrastructure and malware used for intrusions\nIrina Zemlianikina - responsible for the initial stage of the attack, sending out malicious\nemails; she was also handling the data leak sites, the chat system, and publishing the\ndata stolen from the victims\n\nAccording to the German police, the five suspects are the \"masterminds\" of the\nDoppelPaymer ransomware gang and are connected to Russia.\n\n## DoppelPaymer ransomware\n\nThe DoppelPaymer ransomware operation emerged in 2019 targeting critical infrastructure\norganizations and large companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2020, the threat actor started to steal data from the victim networks and adopted the\ndouble extortion method by threatening to publish the stolen files on a leak site on the Tor\nnetwork.\n\nEuropol estimates that between May 2019 and March 2021, victims based in the United\nStates alone paid DoppelPaymer at least $42.4 million. The German authorities have also\nconfirmed 37 cases where companies were targeted by the ransomware gang.\n\nThe DoppelPaymer malware is based on the BitPaymer ransomware. The file-encrypting\nthreat was delivered through Dridex malware, which was pushed by the infamous Emotet\nbotnet.\n\nThe infection vector was spear-phishing emails containing documents with malicious VBS or\nJavaScript code. The threat actor also used a legitimate tool, Process Hacker, to terminate\nsecurity-related products running on the victim systems.\n\n[Although the operation rebranded as \"Grief\" (Pay or Grief) in July 2021 in an attempt to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/)\nescape law enforcement, attacks became more sparse.\n\n**DoppelPaymer attack rate drops**\n\nsource: [ID-Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)\n[Among DoppelPaymer's high-profile victims are Kia Motors America, the Delaware County in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kia-motors-america-suffers-ransomware-attack-20-million-ransom/)\n[Pennsylvania (paid a $500,000 ransom), laptop maker Compal, the Newcastle University](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pennsylvania-county-pays-500k-ransom-to-doppelpaymer-ransomware/)\n[(files leaked), electronics giant Foxconn, and the Dutch Research Council (NWO).](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-newcastle-university-leaks-data/)\n\nTo force victims into paying the ransom, the operators of the DoppelPaymer ransomware\nthreatened to [wipe the decryption keys if victims contracted professional negotiators to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-threatens-to-wipe-decryption-key-if-negotiator-hired/)\nobtain a better price for recovering the locked data.\n\nHowever, the attack frequency decreased to the point that the gang no longer maintains the\nleak site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**UPDATE [March 6, 11:10 AM EST]: Article updated with new information about three more**\nsuspects sought by law enforcement for their major role in the DoppelPaymer ransomware\noperation.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Australian police arrest four BEC actors who stole $1.7 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/australian-police-arrest-four-bec-actors-who-stole-17-million/)\n\n[RAT developer arrested for infecting 10,000 PCs with malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rat-developer-arrested-for-infecting-10-000-pcs-with-malware/)\n\n[ChipMixer platform seized for laundering ransomware payments, drug sales](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chipmixer-platform-seized-for-laundering-ransomware-payments-drug-sales/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - March 10th 2023 - Police Take Action](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-march-10th-2023-police-take-action/)\n\n[Dutch Police arrest three ransomware actors extorting €2.5 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dutch-police-arrest-three-ransomware-actors-extorting-25-million/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
