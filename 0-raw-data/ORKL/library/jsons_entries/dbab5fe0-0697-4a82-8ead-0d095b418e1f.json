It allowed access to a significant number of hackers that have\ncontinued to exploit the compromise to date. This irresponsible and harmful behaviour\nresulted in security risks and significant economic loss for our government institutions and\nprivate companies, and has shown significant spill-over and systemic effects for our security,\neconomy and society at large.\n\nWe have also detected malicious cyber activities with significant effects that targeted\ngovernment institutions and political organisations in the EU and member states, as well as\nkey European industries. These activities can be linked to the hacker groups known as\nAdvanced Persistent Threat 40 and Advanced Persistent Threat 31 and have been\nconducted from the territory of China for the purpose of intellectual property theft and\nespionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe EU and its member states strongly denounce these malicious cyber activities, which are\nundertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all\nUN member states. We continue to urge the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms\nand not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and take all appropriate\nmeasures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the\nsituation.\n\nThe EU and its member states reaffirm their strong commitment to responsible state\nbehaviour to ensure a global, open, free, stable and secure cyberspace. To this end, we will\ncontinue to work on the establishment of a Programme of Action under UN auspices to\nadvance and effectively support states to adhere to responsible state behaviour in\ncyberspace.\n\nWe reiterate our determination to continue to counter malicious behaviour in cyberspace. We\nwill continue to enhance our cooperation, including with international partners and other\npublic and private stakeholders, through increased exchange of information and continued\ndiplomatic engagement, by strengthening cyber resilience and incident handling cooperation,\nas well as through joint efforts to improve the overall security of software and their supply\nchains.\n\nThe Candidate Countries the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania[1] and\nthe EFTA country Norway, member of the European Economic Area, align themselves with\nthis declaration.\n\n\n\n[1] The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the\n\nStabilisation and Association Process.\n\n## Press contacts\n\n**[Nabila Massrali](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9a7a8aba0a5a8e7a4a8bababba8a5a089acaae7acbcbba6b9a8e7acbc)**\nSpokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\n\n+32 2 29 88093\n\n+32 460 79 52 44\n\nIf you are not a journalist, please [send your request to the public information service.](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/contact/general-enquiries/)\n\n\n-----",
