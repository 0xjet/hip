This campaign has\nbeen active since January 2022 and malicious apps are distributed through a fake SecureVPN website that provides only Android apps to\ndownload. Note that although the malware employed throughout this campaign uses the name SecureVPN, it has no association\nwhatsoever with the legitimate, multiplatform SecureVPN software and service.\n\n**Key points of this blogpost:**\n\nThe app used has at different times been a trojanized version of one of two legitimate VPN apps, SoftVPN or OpenVPN, which have\nbeen repackaged with Bahamut spyware code that the Bahamut group has used in the past.\nWe were able to identify at least eight versions of these maliciously patched apps with code changes and updates being made\navailable through the distribution website, which might mean that the campaign is well maintained.\nThe main purpose of the app modifications is to extract sensitive user data and actively spy on victims’ messaging apps.\nWe believe that targets are carefully chosen, since once the Bahamut spyware is launched, it requests an activation key before the\nVPN and spyware functionality can be enabled. Both the activation key and website link are likely sent to targeted users.\nWe do not know the initial distribution vector (email, social media, messaging apps, SMS, etc.).\n\nESET researchers discovered at least eight versions of the Bahamut spyware. The malware is distributed through a fake SecureVPN\n[website as trojanized versions of two legitimate apps – SoftVPN and](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softpac.softvpn) [OpenVPN. These malicious apps were never available for download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn)\nfrom Google Play\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware is able to exfiltrate sensitive data such as contacts, SMS messages, call logs, device location, and recorded phone calls. It\ncan also actively spy on chat messages exchanged through very popular messaging apps including Signal, Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram,\nand Facebook Messenger; the data exfiltration is done via the keylogging functionality of the malware, which misuses accessibility services.\nThe campaign appears to be highly targeted, as we see no instances in our telemetry data.\n\n## Bahamut overview\n\nThe Bahamut APT group typically targets entities and individuals in the Middle East and South Asia with spearphishing messages and fake\napplications as the initial attack vector. Bahamut specializes in cyberespionage, and we believe that its goal is to steal sensitive information\nfrom its victims. Bahamut is also referred to as a mercenary group offering hack-for-hire services to a wide range of clients. The name was\ngiven to this threat actor, which appears to be a master in phishing, by the Bellingcat investigative journalism group. Bellingcat named the\ngroup after the enormous fish floating in the vast Arabian Sea mentioned in the Book of Imaginary Beings written by Jorge Luis Borges.\nBahamut is frequently described in Arabic mythology as an unimaginably enormous fish.\n\nThe group has been the subject of several publications in recent years, including:\n\n[2017 – Bellingcat [1][2]](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/06/12/bahamut-pursuing-cyber-espionage-actor-middle-east/)\n[2018 – Talos [1][2]](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/Mobile-Malware-Campaign-uses-Malicious-MDM.html)\n2018 – [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/h/the-urpage-connection-to-bahamut-confucius-and-patchwork.html)\n2020 – [BlackBerry [pdf]](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-uncovers-massive-hack-for-hire-group-targeting-governments-businesses-human-rights-groups-and-influential-individuals)\n2020 – [SonicWall](https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/android-spyware-bahamut-spreads-disguised-as-voice-of-islam-app/)\n2021 – [打假的Hunter](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oD1VQZBxgjL3rNeN72MJqg)\n2021 – [Cyble](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/08/10/bahamut-threat-group-targeting-users-through-phishing-campaign/)\n2022 – [CoreSec360](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YAAybJBAvxqrQWYDg31BBw)\n2022 – [Cyble](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/06/29/bahamut-android-malware-returns-with-new-spying-capabilities/)\n\n### Distribution\n\nThe initial fake SecureVPN app we analyzed was uploaded to VirusTotal on 2022-03-17, from an IP address that geolocates to Singapore,\nalong with a link to a fake website that triggered one of our YARA rules.\n\nAt the same time, we were notified on Twitter via DM from [@malwrhunterteam about the same sample.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n\nThe malicious Android application used in this campaign was delivered via the website thesecurevpn[.]com (see Figure 1), which uses the\nname – but none of the content or styling – of the legitimate SecureVPN service (at the domain securevpn.com).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Fake SecureVPN website provides a trojanized app to download_\n\n[This fake SecureVPN website was created based on a free web template (see Figure 2), which was most likely used by the threat actor as](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-5-html5-multipurpose-website-template-laslesvpn/)\nan inspiration, since it required only small changes and looks trustworthy.\n\n_Figure 2. Free website template used to create the distribution website for the fake VPN app_\n\n\n-----\n\nthesecurevpn[.]com was registered on 2022 01 27; however, the time of initial distribution of the fake SecureVPN app is unknown. The\nmalicious app is provided directly from the website and has never been available at the Google Play store.\n\n### Attribution\n\n[Malicious code in the fake SecureVPN sample was seen in the SecureChat campaign documented by Cyble and](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YAAybJBAvxqrQWYDg31BBw) [CoreSec360. We have](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/06/29/bahamut-android-malware-returns-with-new-spying-capabilities/)\nseen this code being used only in campaigns conducted by Bahamut; similarities to those campaigns include storing sensitive information\nin a local database before uploading it to the C&C server. The amount of data stored in these databases probably depends on the\ncampaign. In Figure 3 you can see malicious package classes from this variant compared to a previous sample of Bahamut code.\n\n_Figure 3. Class name comparison between the earlier malicious SecureChat package (left) and fake SecureVPN package (right)_\n\nComparing Figure 4 and Figure 5, you can see the similarities in SQL queries in the earlier SecureChat malware, attributed to Bahamut,\nand the fake SecureVPN malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. The SQL queries used in malicious code from the earlier SecureChat campaign_\n\n_Figure 5. The SQL queries used in malicious code in the fake SecureVPN campaign_\n\nAs such, we believe that the fake SecureVPN application is linked to the Bahamut group.\n\n## Analysis\n\nSince the distribution website has been online, there have been at least eight versions of the Bahamut spyware available for download.\nThese versions were created by the threat actor, where the fake application name was followed by the version number. We were able to\npull the following versions from the server, where we believe the version with the lowest version suffix was provided to potential victims in\nthe past, while more recently higher version numbers (secureVPN_104.apk, SecureVPN_105.apk, SecureVPN_106.apk,\nSecureVPN_107.apk, SecureVPN_108.apk, SecureVPN_109.apk, SecureVPN_1010.apk, secureVPN_1010b.apk) have been used.\n\nWe divide these versions into two branches, since Bahamut’s malicious code was placed into two different legitimate VPN apps.\n\nIn the first branch, from version secureVPN_104 until secureVPN_108, malicious code was inserted into the legitimate SoftVPN application\n[that can be found on Google Play and uses the unique package name com.secure.vpn. This package name is also visible in the](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softpac.softvpn)\nPARENT_APPLICATION_ID value in the version information found in the decompiled source code of the first fake SecureVPN app branch,\nas seen in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6. Fake SecureVPN v1.0.4 with malicious code included into SoftVPN as parent application_\n\nIn the second branch, from version secureVPN_109 until secureVPN_1010b, malicious code was inserted into the legitimate open-source\n[application OpenVPN, which is available on Google Play, and that uses the unique package name com.openvpn.secure. As with the](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn)\ntrojanized SoftVPN branch, the original app’s package name is also visible in the fake SecureVPN app’s version information, found in the\n\n\n-----\n\ndecompiled source code, as seen in Figure 7.\n\n_Figure 7. Fake SecureVPN v1.0.9 (SecureVPN_109) with malicious code included into OpenVPN as its parent application even though the hardcoded_\n\nVERSION_NAME (1.0.0) wasn’t changed between versions\n\nBesides the split in these two branches, where the same malicious code is implanted into two different VPN apps, other fake SecureVPN\nversion updates contained only minor code changes or fixes, with nothing significant considering its overall functionality.\n\nThe reason why the threat actor switched from patching SoftVPN to OpenVPN as its parent app is not clear; however, we suspect that the\nreason might be that the legitimate SoftVPN app stopped working or being maintained and was no longer able to create VPN connections –\nas confirmed by our testing of the latest SoftVPN app from Google Play. This could be a reason for Bahamut to switch to using OpenVPN,\nsince potential victims might uninstall a non-working VPN app from their devices. Changing one parent app to another likely required more\ntime, resources, and effort to successfully implement by the threat actor.\n\nMalicious code packaged with the OpenVPN app was implemented a layer above the VPN code. That malicious code implements spyware\nfunctionality that requests an activation key and then checks the supplied key against the attacker’s C&C server. If the key is successfully\nentered, the server will return a token that is necessary for successful communication between the Bahamut spyware and its C&C server. If\nthe key is not correct, neither Bahamut spyware nor VPN functionality will be enabled. Unfortunately, without the activation key, dynamic\nmalware analysis sandboxes might not flag it as a malicious app.\n\nIn Figure 8 you can see an initial activation key request and in Figure 9 the network traffic behind such a request and the response from the\nC&C server.\n\n_Figure 8. Fake SecureVPN requests activation key before enabling VPN and spyware functions_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Fake SecureVPN activation request and its C&C server’s response_\n\nThe campaigns using the fake SecureVPN app try to keep a low profile, since the website URL is most likely delivered to potential victims\nwith an activation key, which is not provided on the website. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain a working key.\n\nThe activation key layer does not belong to the original OpenVPN functionality, and we do not recognize it as code from any other\nlegitimate app. We believe it was developed by Bahamut, since it also communicates with their C&C server.\n\nImplementing a layer to protect a payload from being triggered right after launch on a non-targeted user device or when being analyzed is\nnot a unique feature. We already saw similar protection being used in another campaign by the Bahamut group implemented in the\n[SecureChat app analyzed by CoreSec360. That required extra effort by the victim, who had to create an account and log into it, which then](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YAAybJBAvxqrQWYDg31BBw)\n[enabled the Bahamut spyware functionality. We have also observed comparable protection being used by APT-C-23, where the potential](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/09/30/aptc23-group-evolves-its-android-spyware/)\nvictim needs a valid Coupon Code to download the malicious app.\n\n## Functionality\n\nIf the Bahamut spyware is enabled, then it can be remotely controlled by Bahamut operators and can exfiltrate various sensitive device\ndata such as:\n\ncontacts,\nSMS messages,\ncall logs,\na list of installed apps,\ndevice location,\ndevice accounts,\ndevice info (type of internet connection, IMEI, IP, SIM serial number),\nrecorded phone calls, and\na list of files on external storage.\n\n[By misusing accessibility services, as seen in Figure 10, the malware can steal notes from the SafeNotes application and actively spy on](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protectedtext.android)\nchat messages and information about calls from popular messaging apps such as:\n\nimo-International Calls & Chat,\nFacebook Messenger,\nViber,\nSignal Private Messenger,\nWhatsApp,\nTelegram,\nWeChat, and\n[Conion apps.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secapp.tor.conion)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Fake SecureVPN request to manually enable Accessibility services_\n\nAll exfiltrated data is stored in a local database and then sent to the C&C server. The Bahamut spyware functionality includes the ability to\nupdate the app by receiving a link to a new version from the C&C server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe mobile campaign operated by the Bahamut APT group is still active; it uses the same method of distributing its Android spyware apps\nvia websites that impersonate or masquerade as legitimate services, as has been seen in the past. Further, the spyware code, and hence\nits functionality, is the same as in previous campaigns, including collecting data to be exfiltrated in a local database before sending it to the\noperators’ server, a tactic rarely seen in mobile cyberespionage apps.\n\nIt appears that this campaign has maintained a low profile, as we see no instances in our telemetry data. This is probably achieved through\nhighly targeted distribution, where along with a link to the Bahamut spyware, the potential victim is supplied an activation key, which is\nrequired to enable the malware’s spying functionality.\n\n## IoCs\n\n### Files\n\n**SHA-1** **Package name** **ESET detection name** **Description**\n\n3144B187EDF4309263FF0BCFD02C6542704145B1 com.openvpn.secure Android/Spy.Bahamut.M OpenVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n2FBDC11613A065AFBBF36A66E8F17C0D802F8347 com.openvpn.secure Android/Spy.Bahamut.M OpenVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n2E40F7FD49FA8538879F90A85300247FBF2F8F67 com.secure.vpn Android/Spy.Bahamut.M SoftVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n1A9371B8AEAD5BA7D309AEBE4BFFB86B23E38229 com.secure.vpn Android/Spy.Bahamut.M SoftVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA-1** **Package name** **ESET detection name** **Description**\n\n976CC12B71805F4E8E49DCA232E95E00432C1778 com.secure.vpn Android/Spy.Bahamut.M SoftVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\nB54FFF5A7F0A279040A4499D5AABCE41EA1840FB com.secure.vpn Android/Spy.Bahamut.M SoftVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\nC74B006BADBB3844843609DD5811AB2CEF16D63B com.secure.vpn Android/Spy.Bahamut.M SoftVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n4F05482E93825E6A40AF3DFE45F6226A044D8635 com.openvpn.secure Android/Spy.Bahamut.M OpenVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n79BD0BDFDC3645531C6285C3EB7C24CD0D6B0FAF com.openvpn.secure Android/Spy.Bahamut.M OpenVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n7C49C8A34D1D032606A5E9CDDEBB33AAC86CE4A6 com.openvpn.secure Android/Spy.Bahamut.M OpenVPN app repackaged with\nBahamut spyware code.\n\n### Network\n\n**IP** **Domain** **First seen** **Details**\n\n104.21.10[.]79 ft8hua063okwfdcu21pw[.]de 2022-03-20 C&C server\n\n172.67.185[.]54 thesecurevpn[.]com 2022-02-23 Distribution website\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n[This table was built using version 11 of the ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/versions/)\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\nPersistence [T1398](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1398/) Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts Bahamut spyware receives the\nBOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent to\nactivate at device startup.\n\n\n[T1624](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1624) Event\nTriggered\nExecution\n\n\nBahamut spyware uses Observers to be informed about\nchanges in SMS, contacts, and calls.\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1627](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1627/) Execution Guardrails Bahamut spyware won’t run unless a valid\nactivation key is provided at app startup.\n\n\nDiscovery [T1420](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1420) File and Directory Discovery Bahamut spyware can list available files\non external storage.\n\n\n[T1418](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1418) Software\nDiscovery\n\n[T1426](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1426/) System\nInformation\nDiscovery\n\n\nBahamut spyware can obtain a list of installed applications.\n\nBahamut spyware can extract information about the device\nincluding type of internet connection, IMEI, IP address, and\nSIM serial number.\n\n\nCollection [T1417.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1417/001/) Input Capture: Keylogging Bahamut spyware logs keystrokes in chat\nmessages and call information from\ntargeted apps.\n\n\n[T1430](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1430) Location\nTracking\n\n\nBahamut spyware tracks device location.\n\n\n[T1429](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1429) Audio Capture Bahamut spyware can record phone calls.\n\n\n[T1532](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1532/) Archive\nCollected Data\n\n[T1636.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1636/002/) Protected User\nData: Call\nLogs\n\n[T1636.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1636/003/) Protected User\nData: Contact\nList\n\n\nBahamut spyware stores collected data in a database prior\nto exfiltration.\n\nBahamut spyware can extract call logs.\n\nBahamut spyware can extract the contact list.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\n[T1636.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1636/004/) Protected User\nData: SMS\nMessages\n\n\nBahamut spyware can extract SMS messages.\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\n[T1437.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1437/001/) Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols Bahamut spyware uses HTTPS to\ncommunicate with its C&C server.\n\n\nExfiltration [T1646](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1646/) Exfiltration Over C2 Channel Bahamut spyware exfiltrates stolen data\nover its C&C channel.\n\n23 Nov 2022 -
