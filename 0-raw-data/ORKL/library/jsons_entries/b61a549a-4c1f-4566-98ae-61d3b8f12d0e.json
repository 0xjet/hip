At the time, the two operations using this new tactic were SunCrypt and\nRagnarLocker.\n\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is when a threat actor floods a website or a\nnetwork connection with more requests than it can handle, making the service inaccessible.\n\nWhen a company suffers a ransomware attack, many victims restore from backups and do\nnot bother contacting the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Avaddon ransomware gang now uses DDoS attacks to take down a victim s site or\nnetwork until the victim contacts them and begins negotiating.\n\n\"Also, their site is currently under DDoS Attack, we will attack it until they contact us,\"\n[Avaddon stated on their ransomware data leak site.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\n\n**Avaddon data leak site**\nFor one of the victims that Avaddon is currently performing a DDoS attack, you can see that\nthe website is no longer accessible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avaddon performing a DDoS attack**\nEmsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow, who shared this development with BleepingComputer,\n\n\"It’s not at all surprising to see threat actors combining ransomware and DDoS attacks:\nDDoS is cheap, easy and in some cases may help convince some companies that speedy\npayment is the least painful option. The more pressure the criminals can put companies\nunder, the better their chances of extracting payment,\" Callow told BleepingComputer via\nemail.\n\nWhen [Maze introduced a double-extortion strategy, other ransomware gangs quickly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-shuts-down-operations-denies-creating-cartel/)\nadopted the method. It is too soon to tell if threat actors will adopt DDoS attacks similarly.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Avaddon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/avaddon/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[DDoS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ddos/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
