They were absent from the landscape for over five months, last\nseen on February 7 before returning on July 17, 2020. While Emotet usually takes breaks\nthroughout the year, this was the longest known vacation for the group. Despite this break,\nEmotet continues to be a dangerous threat and below we’ve detailed their delivery methods,\nregional targeting, and an analysis into their use of Qbot.\n\nNow that they are back, TA542 email campaigns are once again the most prevalent by\nmessage volume by a large margin, with only a few other actors coming close. Proofpoint\nhas blocked hundreds of thousands of messages (sometimes coming close to one million)\neach day. There is no clear industry targeting among TA542 campaigns.\n\nWhile there are some innovations and incremental changes, Proofpoint researchers have\nnoted surprisingly minimal change in TA542’s tactics or tooling, considering the long break.\n[Many trends observed previously still remain relevant.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta542-banker-malware-distribution-service)\n\nSignificant new changes and innovations include:\n\nDistribution of Qbot affiliate “partner01” as the primary payload delivered by Emotet\ninstead of The Trick. However, Emotet has previously delivered Qbot affiliate “hhhXX”\non a few occasions such as in March 2019.\n[A change in the Emotet mail sending module that can now attach benign attachments](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-now-steals-your-email-attachments-to-attack-contacts/)\nalong with malicious ones.\n\nOnly small incremental changes were observed in:\n\nEmails: We continue to see a significant volume of thread hijacking and language\nlocalization in emails. The actor continues to use generic as well as currently\nnewsworthy lures such as COVID-19.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttachments / URLs: Similar to activity observed before their break, TA542 continues to\nuse Word attachments with macros, PDF attachments, and URLs linking to Word files.\nCountry targeting: The actor continues to target a core set of countries including (listed\nby message volume) Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United States, United Kingdom,\nand Canada, while at the same time experimenting with targeting new geographies\nsuch as Indonesia, the Philippines, Sweden, and India.\n\n_Figure 1: Indexed volume of email messages containing Emotet (from April 19, 2017 to_\n_August 18, 2020)_\n\n**Precursor Campaign**\n\nBefore diving into the analysis, it’s important to mention that Proofpoint and other\nresearchers were able to see warnings that Emotet was about to return. Those watching\nactive Emotet infections took notice that new email sending modules were received. It's also\npossible to watch for unusual (old) Emotet email in inboxes.\n\nOn July 14, 2020 Proofpoint researchers spotted emails with old Emotet URLs, specifically\nthose that were previously seen in the last known Emotet campaign on February 7, 2020.\nThese emails came from many sender IPs, as if multiple emotet bots reactivated.\n\n**Delivery**\n\nEmotet malspam is very different from other malware email campaigns in that it starts early\nand lasts throughout the whole day, making it hard to determine the end of one campaign\nand beginning of the next. However, in general, campaigns start at night between 1:00am\n\n\n-----\n\n**EST and 5:00am EST. There are exceptions to this as some campaigns start much later in**\nthe day, for example at 3:00pm EST on August 5, 2020.\n\nEmotet campaigns can typically be seen Monday through Friday, and there is no significant\nsending on weekends. There are some exceptions to this as the actor did not send malicious\nemail on Friday, July 24, Monday, August 3, Tuesday, August 4, or during the period of July\n17, 2020 to August 18, 2020.\n\nTA542 continues to leverage social engineering mechanisms to increase infection rates.\nThey compose emails in the appropriate language for the targeted country. They use simple\n“call to action” emails.\n\n**Emails**\n\nA large percentage of Emotet emails use thread hijacking (replies to previous conversations),\nand the subjects begin with “Re: ” or “RE: “, such as:\n\nRe: [subject from stolen email]\nRE: [subject from stolen email]\n\nAnother noticeable trend is using the recipient’s name, job function, company name, or\ncompany domain in the subject. The Friendly-From name of the sender address often\ncontains the company name or domain. The email body also often contains the company\nname, domain or recipient name in the greeting and signature.\n\n**Format** **Example**\n\n[Firstname Lastname] John Doe\n\n[Firstname, Lastname] John, Doe\n\n[Companyname] Widgetsmaker\n\n[Companyname Recipientfunction] Widgetsmaker Payroll\n\nAgreement for [Companyname] Agreement for Widgetsmaker\n\nFiles for [Companyname] Files for John Doe\n\nINVOICE 1067935 from [Personname] INVOICE 1067935 from John Doe\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 1: Example subjects that use specific information related to recipient or their company_\n\nBesides those notable trends, there is a large and varying number of subjects. Below are a\nfew examples of other subjects, though this list is not exhaustive:\n\nEstimate [Digits]\nFatura [Date]\nFinancement pour\nFind attached invoice INV-Y-35852\nINVOICE [Digits]\nNota fiscal\nNovos dados 20/07/2020\nOpen Past Due Orders\nOpen invoices\nOrder Processing\nOur stay at the Weekend\nOutstanding Invoices\nPO 54203\nPaid Invoice & Credit Card Receipt\nPast Due Invoice\nPayroll 80606\nQuestion\nQuote 862639\nQuote RFQ-00012679\nQuote Request\nRenewals\nReno Update\nSales Invoice\nYour statement is available online\ndemande\n\n**Geographical Targeting**\n\nTA542 continues the trend of consistently targeting certain regions, while also adding new\ncountries periodically. The core regions that Emotet still targets include (listed by message\nvolume): Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Latin\nAmerican countries. Other regions targeted recently but less consistently include Indonesia,\nthe Philippines, Sweden, and India. Each country is typically targeted with appropriate\nlanguage in email bodies, subjects, filenames, and branding. Known targeted countries are\nlisted below (Table 2).\n\n**Country** **Language** **Note**\n\n\n-----\n\nGermany German Consistent targeting\n\nAustria German Consistent targeting\n\nSwitzerland German Consistent targeting\n\n\nUnited\nKingdom\n\n\nEnglish Consistent targeting\n\n\nUnited States English Consistent targeting\n\nCanada English, French Consistent targeting\n\n\nUnited Arab\nEmirates\n\n\nEnglish Consistent targeting\n\n\nJapan Japanese Consistent targeting\n\n\nLatin America Spanish and\nPortuguese\n\n\nConsistent targeting of countries such as Brazil, Chile,\nMexico, Colombia, Ecuador\n\n\nIndia Hindi Occasional\n\nIndonesia Indonesian Occasional\n\nPhilippines Filipino Occasional\n\nSweden Swedish Occasional\n\nItaly Italian Occasional\n\nSpain Spanish Occasional\n\nNorway Norwegian Occasional\n\nNetherlands Dutch Occasional\n\n\n-----\n\nVietnam Vietnamese Occasional\n\n_Table 2: Description of the countries with observed Emotet email campaigns since July 17,_\n_2020. Note that this list is not considered exhaustive._\n\n**Mistakes**\n\nThere are often mistakes in the way that Emotet malicious emails are created, where\nplaceholders or macros are not filled in. These may be due to bugs in the code of the Emotet\nmail sending capability that generates these emails. For example, we have seen\nattachments with names such as those listed below. Placeholders like “{rcpt.domain}” are\nmeant to be completed in the domain.\n\nestimate ui00071 from {rcpt.domain-1-up}.doc\ninvoice-e00889 from {rcpt.domain}.rtf.doc\ng1:regex:(invoice|profile|document|doc|doc|document|payment advice\nnote|invoice|attn|invoice|verification letter|status update|invoice status update|invoice\nid|invoice for service|08_2020 invoice for service|your invoice|past due invoice|order\nconfir.doc\n\nThere are also placeholders in the email body such as those shown below. A Spanish\nlanguage email screenshot in Figure 3 illustrates this.\n\n{FROM.NAME}\n{MSG.MESSAGE}\n\n**Example Emails**\n\nThis section highlights email lures from some of the more notable TA542 campaigns.\n\nThe figure below shows the following emails:\n\nIndonesian language email targeting Indonesia. The subject “faktur dari” translates to\n“invoice from”. (top left)\nHindi language email targeting India and utilizing thread hijacking. The “कृपया संल�न फॉम�\nदेख�।” text in the body of the email translates to “Please see the attached form.” (top\nright)\nFilipino language email targeting Philippines. The attachment name “impormasyon ng\ncontact.doc” translates to “contact information.doc”. Note that this email contains both a\nWord attachment and a URL linking to a malicious Word file (bottom right)\nSwedish language email targeting Sweden. The subject “Dagordning för det\nkommande mötet på fredagen” translates to “Agenda for the upcoming meeting on\nFriday” (bottom left)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Clockwise, starting from top left corner, Indonesian, Hindi, Filipino, Swedish_\n_language emails._\n\nThe figure below shows the following emails:\n\nGerman language email targeting Germany. (top left)\nSpanish language email targeting Spain. Note that this email still contains the\n{FROM.NAME} placeholder that should have been filled in with a name before the\nactor sent it. (top right)\nItalian language email targeting Italy. (bottom right)\nFrench language email targeting Canada. (bottom left)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Clockwise, starting from top left corner, German, Spanish, Italian, French language_\n_emails._\n\nThe figure below shows the following emails:\n\nCOVID-19 lure: On August 7, 2020 we began to see emails with attachment filenames\nthat included “COVID-19” strings, such as “cd-8423 medical report covid-19.doc” and\n“covid-19 report 08 11 2020.doc”.\nJapanese Bitcoin extortion: Extortion emails in Japan are back. We saw them before\nEmotet took a break with an almost identical message.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: COVID-19 email example, Japanese Bitcoin extortion email._\n\nWe confirmed open source reports that there are examples of Emotet emails that include\nbenign attachments along with malicious ones. These make up a minor portion of Emotet\nemail. Examples below show benign PDF attachments along with malicious Word\nattachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: benign PDF attachments in the same email with malicious Word attachments._\n\n**Attachments/URLs**\n\nThe malicious content included in the emails sent by this threat actor is either a URL or an\nattachment, and sometimes but rarely both a URL and an attachment in the same email.\nWord attachments are seen every day, URLs linking to Word files are also seen every day,\nand PDFs attachments are seen occasionally. Demonstrated for the period of July 17, 2020\nto August 18, 2020:\n\n2020-07-17: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-20: Word attachments, PDF attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-21: Word attachments, PDF attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-22: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-23: Word attachments, PDF attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-27: Word attachments, PDF attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-28: Word attachments, PDF attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-29: Word attachments, URLs\n\n\n-----\n\n2020-07-30: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-07-31: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-05: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-06: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-07: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-10: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-11: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-12: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-13: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-14: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-17: Word attachments, URLs\n\n2020-08-18: Word attachments, URLs\n\n**Attachments**\n\nMost often an attachment is a Word document with macros, and less commonly a PDF.\nOther attachment types that the actor is known to use, specifically JScript or Zips, have not\nbeen observed since Emotet returned.\n\nThe Word attachments are first-stage downloaders that attempt to download the Emotet\npayload using macros from one of several (typically 5) hardcoded payload URLs. A new set\nof five payload URLs is seen periodically, as frequently as every 1 to 2 hours. Different\ndocuments may use the same set of 5 URLs. On any given day we observe up to 100 total\npayload URLs.\n\nNote: On August 18, 2020 we started observing Word files with 6 or 7 payload URLs.\n\nThe PDF attachments contain an embedded URL linking to a site hosting a similar macro\nWord document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: TA542 most commonly uses Microsoft Word documents with macros. The actor_\n_periodically updates the visual lure used in the document. This collage shows two of the_\n_observed lures._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Examples of PDF attachments observed._\n\nEmotet has a small library of templates for their PDF file names:\n\n**Format** **Example**\n\nreport.pdf report.pdf\n\n[2 letters]-[4 digits] report p[1 number].pdf qx-6971 report p2.pdf\n\nsoc report [date].pdf soc report 07 21 2020.pdf\n\n[date]- balance & payment report.pdf 2020_07- balance & payment report.pdf\n\n_Table 3: PDF file names and format_\n\n\n-----\n\nConversely, they have a large and varying library of file name templates that they use for the\nWord documents, below examples represent a small fraction of possibilities. Word\nattachment names are not always English–they may be in a language appropriate to the\ntargeted geography.\n\n**Format** **Example**\n\n#[5 digits].doc #04216.doc\n\n[5 digits] logistics rate con.doc 00089 logistics rate con.doc\n\n[11 digits]_jul2020.doc 10068100718_jul2020.doc\n\n[4 digits]-[5 digits]_county_report.doc 1660-63745_county_report.doc\n\n[4 digits]-[5 digits]_city_report.doc 1850-91171_city_report.doc\n\n[date]- balance & payment report.doc 2020_07- balance & payment report.doc\n\n[date]- balance.doc 2020_07- balance.doc\n\n[date]- report.doc 2020_07- report.doc\n\n[date]- statement.doc 2020_07- statement.doc\n\n[16 digits]_[date].doc 2873890348491143_07202020.doc\n\n[4 digits]-[5 digits]_data sheet.doc 4087-60384_data sheet.doc\n\nanexo.doc\n\narquivo.doc\n\nbank details and invoice.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nbiz_[11 digits].doc biz_10039266887.doc\n\naugust invoice.doc\n\nform - [date].doc form - aug 11, 2020.doc\n\nzahlungsschreiben_[date]_[10 digits].doc zahlungsschreiben_2020_08_1147364050.doc\n\nswift_[date]_[10 digits].doc swift_11_08_2020_6296415287.doc\n\nsepa_[date].doc sepa_2020_08.doc\n\nreport [7 digits].doc report 5557308.doc\n\npo#[6 digits] [date].doc po#046325 110820.doc\n\npayment summary - ref id- d[5 digits].doc payment summary - ref id- d28114.doc\n\nसंपक� जानकारी.doc\n\n_Table 4: Examples of Word document file names_\n\nFile names that stood out: On August 7, Proofpoint saw attachment filenames that included\n“COVID-19” strings, such as “cd-8423 medical report covid-19.doc” and “covid-19 report\n**08 11 2020.doc”. These names are still in use at the time of writing.**\n\nExtension mismatches: Some emails have attachment file names with a .docm, .rtf, or .zip\nextension, where they should be .doc extensions. This may be accidental or a deliberate\nattempt to evade detection. We did not do thorough testing, but we know that Microsoft Word\ncan open some of these attachments without errors despite the mismatch. For example,\nWord 2010 can open the files with .rtf extension.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Example emails showing the extension mismatch_\n\n**URLs**\n\nWe have not observed changes in the way that this actor embeds URLs in emails. The URLs\nare still frequently hosted on compromised sites, including vulnerable WordPress\ninstallations. The URLs hosted on compromised WordPress CMS sites are obvious to spot\nas they are often hosted with “wp-content”, “wp-admin”, “wp-includes” and other similar folder\nstructure. For other URLs it is not immediately obvious how the actor compromised the sites\nsince there are a range of servers (i.e. Apache, nginx, IIS), databases (i.e. MySQL),\nlanguages (i.e. PHP), libraries, plugins, eCommerce frameworks, etc.\n\nThe actor typically adds a nested structure of one or more folders on the compromised site\nand hosts a malicious PHP script that initiates the download of the payload. Currently we\nonly observe URLs leading to Microsoft Word documents with macros.\n\n**Malware: Emotet**\n\nWe have not done extensive comparative reverse engineering and review of Emotet and its\nmodules, but components that we analyzed had very little change. Emotet still uses the\nsame way to store configuration and the same network command and control protocol.\n\n\n-----\n\n[We confirmed open source reports of a change in Emotet mail sending module now](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-now-steals-your-email-attachments-to-attack-contacts/)\nattaching benign attachments along with malicious attachments.\n\n**Emotet Payload: Qbot**\n\nQbot affiliate id “partner01” is the primary payload dropped by Emotet seen almost daily.\nHowever, Emotet has previously delivered Qbot affiliate “hhhXX” on a few occasions such as\nin March 2019, January 2019, May 2017, and April 2017. Before Emotet disappeared from\nthe landscape, it primarily delivered The Trick affiliate “morXX” in January and February\n2020.\n\nExample Qbot “partner01” sha256 hashes observed between July 17 and

large margin, with only a few other actors coming close.\nThey have introduced code changes to their malware, such as updates to the email sending\n\n\n-----\n\nmodule, and picked up a new affiliate payload to distribute (Qbot). They continue to\nexperiment with delivery to new countries. Despite these changes we also noted that many\nof their other methods and tooling have remained relatively unchanged from previous activity\nsince their return. Current lures, delivery mechanisms, and widespread geographic targeting\nare all similar to what we have observed in the past. Whether they iterate and change their\ntactics or continue in the same manner, Emotet remains a highly dangerous threat.\n\nEmerging Threats + Emerging Threats Pro Signature\n\n2842317 - ETPRO MALWARE Win32/Emotet CnC Activity (POST) M9\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
