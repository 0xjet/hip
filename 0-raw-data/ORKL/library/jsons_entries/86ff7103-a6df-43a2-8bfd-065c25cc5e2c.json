With March 2021 marking the one-](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/how-cybercriminals-prey-on-the-covid-19-pandemic/)\nyear anniversary that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, we revisited the phishing trends we observed in the past\nyear to gain deeper insight into the various COVID-related topics that attackers might try to exploit.\n\nStarting with the set of all phishing URLs detected globally between January 2020 and February 2021, we generated sets of specific keywords\n(or phrases) that served as indicators for each COVID-related topic, and applied keyword matching to determine which phishing URLs were\nrelated to each topic. (To ensure that the matched URLs were indeed COVID-related, we iteratively spot-checked the resulting URLs and\nrefined these keywords/phrases to minimize the incidence of false positives.)\n\nWe found that at each step along the way, attackers have continued to change their chosen tactics to adapt to the latest pandemic trends, in\nhopes that maintaining a timely sense of urgency will make it more likely for victims to give up their credentials.\n\nWe found phishing attacks largely centered around Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and testing kits in March 2020, government stimulus\nprograms from April through the summer 2020 (including a fake U.S. Trading Commission website that posed as the U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission in order to steal user credentials) and vaccines from late fall 2020 onward (including a fake Pfizer and BioNTech website also\nstealing user credentials). Of note, we found that vaccine-related phishing attacks rose by 530% from December 2020 to February 2021, and\nthat phishing attacks relating to and/or targeting pharmacies and hospitals rose by 189% during that same timeframe.\n\nWe found no evidence that any of these efforts were successful, but are highlighting these cases to make healthcare organizations around the\nglobe aware of this heightened activity targeting their sector, so they can alert employees to be on guard for malicious credential-phishing\nsites.\n\nWe predict that as the vaccine rollout continues, phishing attacks related to vaccine distribution – including attacks targeting the healthcare and\nlife sciences industries – will continue to rise worldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\na o to et o s e t Ge e at o e a custo e s a e p otected o p s g attac s t a a ety o secu ty se ces, c ud g U\nFiltering, [DNS Security,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/dns-security) [Threat Prevention and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention) [GlobalProtect.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/globalprotect)\n\nIn addition to these security services, best practices to protect yourself and your organization from phishing attacks include:\n\n**For individuals:**\n\nExercising caution when clicking on any links or attachments contained in suspicious emails, especially those relating to one’s account\nsettings or personal information, or otherwise trying to convey a sense of urgency.\nVerifying the sender address for any suspicious emails in your inbox.\nDouble-checking the URL and security certificate of each website before inputting your login credentials.\nReporting suspected phishing attempts.\n\n**For organizations:**\n\nImplementing security awareness training to improve employees’ ability to identify fraudulent emails\n[Regularly backing up your organization’s data as a defense against ransomware attacks initiated via phishing emails.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-report-highlights/)\nEnforcing multi-factor authentication on all business-related logins as an added layer of security.\n\n## Phishing Trends\n\nSince January 2020, we have observed 69,950 phishing URLs linked to COVID-related topics, of which 33,447 are directly linked to COVID-19\nitself. In Figure 1, we plot the relative popularity of these different topics over time, normalized so that each topic has a peak popularity of\n100%. Looking at how the heights of each colored section differs over time, we can see that certain topics have remained steady targets of\nphishing attacks, while others have experienced more noticeable spikes at various points in time. Pharmaceutical drugs and gathering virtually\n(e.g. Zoom), for example, have been a relatively steady target of phishing attacks since the start of the pandemic; vaccines and testing, on the\nother hand, have experienced more defined peaks in popularity.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nTrends in COVID-themed phishing attacks from January 2020-February 2021 (global).\nFor the COVID-19 themed phishing pages that were found to be targeting known brands, we determined that the majority of these pages were\nattempting to steal users’ business credentials: e.g. Microsoft, Webmail, Outlook, etc. Each bar in Figure 2 represents the percentage of\nphishing URLs that were attempting to steal users’ login credentials for that particular website. (For example, about 23% of COVID-themed\nphishing URLs were fake Microsoft login pages.) With the pandemic forcing many employees to shift to remote work, these business-related\nphishing attempts have become an increasingly important attack vector for cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Top\n\nphishing targets in COVID-related URLs (global). Each bar represents the percentage of phishing URLs attempting to steal users’ login\ncredentials for that particular website. (Note that in this figure, we only include URLs that target identifiable brands.)\nFurthermore, we notice that with these COVID-19 themed phishing attacks, attackers are constantly creating new websites to host their\nphishing campaigns. In Figure 3, which shows the age for each website that we found to host a COVID-related phishing page, we can see that\nmany COVID-related phishing pages are hosted on newly created sites (we define this as sites that were first observed fewer than 32 days\nago), suggesting that attackers purposefully set up these sites just days before their intended attacks. This gives the attackers the opportunity\nto craft the message surrounding the attack – as well as the website URL itself – to fit the latest pandemic trends.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Age\n\nof websites that host COVID-related phishing pages at time of detection (global).\n\n**January-March 2020: Initial Surge, Testing Kits and PPE**\n\nBetween January and February 2020, as COVID-19 began its spread throughout the world, cybercriminals had already begun trying to use the\nsoon-to-be pandemic to their advantage. During this timeframe, we observed a 313% increase in phishing attacks directly related to COVID19.\n\nIn Figure 4, we see an example of a COVID-19 themed phishing attack. The fake Google Form first asks the user to input his or her email\naddress and password in order to participate in a supposed company COVID-19 screening program. In the subsequent pages, the form asks a\nseries of legitimate-sounding health-related questions, e.g. “Since your last day of work, have you had two or more of the following? Chills,\n_Repeated shaking with chills, Headache, Muscle pain, Sore throat, New loss of taste or smell,” to give the impression that the form itself is_\nlegitimate. The final question before submission asks the employee to “digitally sign” the form by entering his or her full name.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nhttps://docs[.]google[.]com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiQL-IcnGqRIKzTVmpeQSBVRrD06c4NolWvgWcdRH-NgBx-A/viewform?\nvc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0 (Credential stealing form related to COVID-19 screening.)From February-March 2020, concern about COVID-19\nspreading to the U.S. quickly became prominent. In response to people’s desire to protect themselves and their families, interest in testing kits,\n\n\n-----\n\nsuc as a d sa t e a d 95 as s, a d e e esse t a goods e to et pape bega to [se ap d y](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-mayors-mask-equipment-shortage/2020/03/27/fc2a45a4-701f-11ea-96a0-df4c5d9284af_story.html)\n\nFigure 5.\n\nOnline interest in “COVID Test Kit” vs. COVID testing-related phishing prevalence (global data via Google Trends).\nThese trends are observable in our historical phishing data as well. In February 2020, we observed a 136% increase in PPE-related phishing\nattacks worldwide, many of which took the form of online shopping scams (see Figure 6 for an example). During the month of March, we\n[observed a 750% increase in phishing attacks related to testing kits, just as The New York Times reported on a shortage of COVID tests](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html)\nacross the U.S.\n\nFigure 6.\n\nhttps://atemmaske-kn95-de[.]com (Scam website, translated from German to English).In addition to these scam sites, we also observed\nseemingly legitimate testing kit vendors whose websites had become compromised for credential stealing purposes. In Figure 8, we see a fake\nMicrosoft Sharepoint login page that a user would be taken to via a link in a phishing email. The phishing page would ask for the user’s email\nand Microsoft password in order to view a time-sensitive invoice that had been “shared” with him or her.\n\n\n-----\n\ntestkit[.]co[.]uk (A UK-based wholesaler of COVID-19 test kits)\n\n\nFigure 7. covid\nFigure 8. covid\n\ntestkit[.]co[.]uk/wpincludes/images/i/Newfilesviewc7c782c3b7c54f958e7eb2efff3a49b28866b4fc22dd46cfbad9e6ac9d0cd18cca873584897b48c88d82ecf5cd62783dS\n(Credential stealing page on a compromised COVID-related website)\n\n**April-July 2020: Government Stimulus and Relief Programs**\n\n[In April 2020, the IRS began distributing $1,200 stimulus checks to individuals as a part of the CARES Act. Around the same time, the](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares)\n[Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was put into action, promising to provide relief to small businesses across the U.S. Many business](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program)\nowners scrambled to get a piece of the funds, causing online interest in COVID stimulus and relief programs to surge, and funds to quickly run\nout.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9.\n\nStimulus programs online interest vs. COVID government stimulus and relief-related phishing prevalence (global data via Google Trends).\nSubsequently, we noticed that phishing attacks related to government relief programs increased by 600% in April 2020. In Figures 10-11, we\nshow an example of a phishing page pretending to represent the “U.S. Trading Commission,” a fake branch of the U.S. federal government\nthat the FTC [warned about. The website promises up to $5,800 in “Temporary Relief Fund” grants for each individual. Fake statistics are](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/01/scam-us-trading-commission-website-not-ftc)\ndisplayed on the right-hand side of the page, giving the user the illusion that there are still billions of dollars left to distribute.\n\nFigure 10.\n\nungodsirealnighchis[.]gq/us/protecting-americas-consumers-covid/ (Fake website pretending to represent the “U.S. Trading\nCommission.”)Upon clicking a button saying “Start Verification Procedure,” the user is redirected to a form asking for their Social Security\nNumber (SSN) and driver’s license number in order to receive these emergency COVID relief funds.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11.\n\nungodsirealnighchis[.]gq/us/protecting-americas-consumers-covid/verification.php (Credential stealing form related to COVID government\naid.)After completing the form, the confirmation page simply states: “Your response has been recorded. We will contact you as soon as\n_possible. You may always contact us directly at 213-746-7272 for faster service.” (Note that this phone number is likely fake, since once the_\nuser has filled out the form, the attacker would already have the credentials they wanted.)\nAfter the legitimate stimulus and relief programs were put in place, these economic relief-related phishing attacks stayed relatively popular for\n[the months to come (see Figure 9), as many people were still in need of financial support. In Figure 12, we see another credential stealing](https://carsey.unh.edu/COVID-19-Economic-Impact-By-State)\npage asking the user to input personal and corporate information, driver’s license photo and bank account details in order to receive additional\nrelief funds from a “COVID-19 giveaway.” We see a similar example in Figure 13, which promises to send the user a free lockdown fund\npackage of 3000 Indian rupees after inputting their bank account information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12.\n\n\ncovid-19-benefit[.]cabanova[.]com (Credential stealing page related to a supposed COVID relief giveaway.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13.\n\nfund4-covid19[.]com (Credential stealing site asking the user to input his or her bank account information in order to receive a limited-time\n“lockdown fund package.”)\n\n**November 2020-February 2021: Vaccine Approval and Rollout**\n\nFor the next several months, various states settled into a state of on-and-off [lockdowns, while people awaited news of a potential vaccine.](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-map-stay-at-home-orders-lockdowns-2020-3)\n\n[In November 2020, after months of anticipation, Pfizer and BioNTech released a promising set of initial results, showing over 90% vaccine](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-idUSKBN27P1ID)\neffectiveness based on a subset of 94 participants in their real-world trial.

From December 2020 to February 2021, we observed a 530% increase in\nvaccine-related phishing attacks (see Figure 14).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14.\n\n“COVID Vaccine” online interest vs. COVID vaccine-related phishing prevalence (global data via Google Trends).\nIn Figures 15-16, we show an example of a fake website that claims to represent Pfizer and BioNTech, the makers of the mRNA vaccine. The\nphishing page asks the user to log in with his or her Office 365 credentials, supposedly in order to sign up for the vaccine.\n\n[Also note that this phishing website employs an increasingly common technique known as “client-side cloaking.” Rather than revealing the](http://www.public.asu.edu/~pzhang57/papers/crawlphish.pdf)\ncredential stealing form immediately, the website first asks the user to click the “Login” button, in an effort to evade automated, crawler-based\nphishing detectors.\n\nFigure 15.\n\npfizer-vaccine[.]online (Fake Pfizer website with client-side phishing cloaking.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16.\n\npfizer-vaccine[.]online (Credential stealing form revealed after user clicks the “Login” button.)At the same time as attackers have started to\ncapitalize on the vaccine registration process, they have also increased their targeting of hospitals and pharmacies – organizations that play a\n[significant role in distributing the vaccine. According to a national survey conducted by the American Medical Association (AMA), 83% of](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/patient-support-advocacy/medical-cybersecurity-patient-safety-issue)\nphysician practices have already been affected by cyberattacks at some point in the past. Now more than ever, we suspect that organizations\ninvolved in the production and distribution of the vaccine — a process involving high amounts of time-sensitive and confidential data that could\nbe [held for ransom — may be viewed as high-value targets for cybercrime.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ryuk-ransomware/)\nFrom December 2020 to February 2021, we observed a 189% increase in attacks related to pharmacies and hospitals. Many of these attacks\nare part of larger clusters of phishing campaigns, where several different URLs are sent to different employees of the same organization, in the\nhopes that at least one of the employees will mistakenly input his or her credentials into the fake login page.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the global nature of COVID-19, these phishing campaigns targeting pharmaceutical and healthcare companies\nseem to be prevalent worldwide, not just in the U.S.\n\nIn certain cases, we also observe legitimate pharmaceutical companies whose websites have been compromised and used for phishing\npurposes. In Figure 17, we can see that a website belonging to a global life sciences technology marketplace company which had been\ncompromised and used to host a phishing page for stealing users’ business credentials. These sorts of attacks can be particularly dangerous,\nas the legitimacy of the original website may trick users into incorrectly thinking that the phishing page is also legitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. A\n\ncompromised website from a global life sciences technology marketplace being used for credential stealing.With the global vaccine rollout still\nvery much in-progress, we expect that attacks related to the vaccine – and attacks targeting corresponding industries – will continue to rise as\nvaccine production and distribution continue to scale up over the coming months.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt various points during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen attackers shift their focus from one topic to another depending on the current\nstate of events. In the early stages of the pandemic, testing kits and PPE were a significant area of focus for attackers. The focus then shifted\nto government stimulus and relief programs, before pivoting again to the vaccine rollout. As we have seen, attackers continually adapt to the\nnewest trends. As a result, cybersecurity defenses must adapt as well.\n\nIndividuals should continue to exercise caution when viewing any emails or websites claiming to sell any goods or services or provide any\nbenefits related to COVID-19. If it seems too good to be true, it most likely is.
