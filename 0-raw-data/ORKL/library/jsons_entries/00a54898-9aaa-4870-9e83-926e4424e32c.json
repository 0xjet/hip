Although the term has since become highly popular, state-sponsored cyber-intelligence operations have been carried out since long before the advent of Stuxnet or Flamer; less known advanced persistent threats such as APT28 (or Sofacy) have been covertly running in Europe since 2007.\n\n### Preface\n\nWhen it was initially coined, the term “Advanced Persistent Threat” was used to define an attack that, unlike regular commercial-grade\nmalware, would focus on a particular target, its network topology and defenses. The purpose of this type of attack is exfiltration of sensitive\ndata over a long period of time or silently crippling their industrial processes. In recent years, APTs have started to define persistent\nattacks launched by foreign state adversaries that no security company or victim government would explicitly name for fear of economic\nor political repercussions. Another aspect that makes calling on attacking states is the difficulty in attribution: the Internet has no physical\nboundaries and the technical skills of the attacking parties can make it look as the attack was launched by a rival state.\n\nTo connect the dots between an identified attack and the state actor(s) behind it, companies like Bitdefender look for solid evidence inside\nthe APT code or in the used communication infrastructure. The following report is a technical investigation of some particularities in the\nAPT28 payload implementation that allowed us to link the threat to its operators.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Targeted victims\n\nOur recent investigation into the Sofacy operations revealed that the cyber-group is extremely active and focused on specific regions. The\nprimary targets of APT28 are potential victims in several countries such as Ukraine, Spain, Russia, Romania, the United States and Canada.\n\nA particular interest was found for Ukraine. Between Tuesday, 10th of February and Saturday, 14th of February 2015, the APT28 team\nscanned 8,536,272 IPs for possible vulnerabilities.\n\nCoincidentally, during this period, in Minsk, the political leaders of Belarus, Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine were participating in a\nsummit, discussing the ceasefire in the Donbass region in the east of Ukraine.\n\nAfter February 14[th,] the APT28 operators shifted their attention to Spain.\n\nThe map of affected countries is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1\n\nIt is currently unknown what criteria the APT28 operators used to select targets, but our research identified that they are picked from a list of\nvulnerable IP addresses prepared beforehand. The same research shows all targets belong to different categories: political ([removed]),\ne-crime services, telecommunication services or aerospace industry.\n\nMore information about the victims can be found in Appendix 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Attribution\n\nWe have reasons to believe that the operators of the APT28 network are either Russian citizens or citizens of a neighboring country that\nspeak Russian. Our assumption is supported by different markers identified during analysis.\n\nWhen we first analyzed the pool of files we had collected on APT28, we counted the number of binaries compiled between 08:00 and 18:00\non working days (Monday to Friday) for every time zone. It was revealed that UTC+4 stands out, as 88% of files are compiled during this\ninterval. Out of the other countries sharing the same time zone (Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan), Russia is the only country that possesses the\nnecessary skills and resources to pull off this kind of attack.\n\nIn the graphic below (Figure 2) the samples are grouped by the hour they were compiled (UTC+4). It can be seen that most were compiled\nbetween 08:00 and 18:00.\n\n###### Figure 2\n\nAnother clue that supports the assumption that the authors are from a Russian-speaking country is found in a hacking tool\ndesigned to grant system privileges. This tool was found along with files related to APT28 files. The header of the file called xp.exe\n(78450806E56B1F224D00455EFCD04CE3) features a hardcoded path to a debug file (C:\\Users\\Пользователь\\Desktop\\cve-2014-4076\\\ncve-19abdba\\Debug\\CVE-2014-4076.pdb). The string Пользователь translates to users in Russian.\n\nWe have reasons to believe that this file is part of the same APT28 attack since it had its modification/creation time modified to 14/04/2008,\n16:00, just like most of the other APT28 files used in the attack. All files used in the attack were compiled after 2013. Changing the date was\njust a measure to throw off any victim who would perform a shallow search for new files, should they have any doubts about the security\nof their system.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Scanning for new targets\n\nOne of the main purposes of the server we analyzed is to automate the process of finding new victims that can be marked as “vulnerable.”\nThis is done by exhaustively scanning and probing a pre-determined pool of IP addresses contained in a range. The server-side application\nhas four main components, as follows:\n\na python script (gen_ip.py) that generates random IPs from a certain class\n\na database (shodb) for centralizing all the data\n\nthe scan bots that probe and screen potential victims\n\na Django (sho) application for bot administration and reporting.\n\nRather than taking a “shotgun” approach, the APT28 victims are hand-picked. The script has a hard-coded list of IP classes; it iterates\nthrough these subnets and generates a list of random IPs within the range. If the operators scanned all IPs within the range, it would\nincrease the chances of the attacked party noticing their systems are actively probed from the outside. After the random generation\nprocess completes, these IPs are added to the database. Each IP address is then given a priority level.\n\nAt the time of writing, the database contains the 58,624 IPs related to the incident described in Appendix 1. All these IP addresses have the\nsame priority level, set to 1.\n\nThe scanning bots are individual systems, all situated in different networks. We presume this was a necessary approach to make the\nscanning process look organic. If a single IP or a set of IPs from the same network would scan entire subnets, it would raise suspicions or\ntrip intrusion detection systems and their activity would likely be interrupted.\n\nTo get their scan jobs, each bot would authenticate to the server via cookies. Upon successfully authenticating, the scan bot receives a\nlist of maximum 16 IPs per request. For each IP, it will scan certain ports using the nmap tool (Appendix 1). If it finds open ports, it then\ncontacts the server and the information retrieved by nmap is saved in the database. Subsequently, the respective IP address is marked as\nvulnerable. The process is described in the figure below (Figure 3):\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe Django application represents a wrapper over the database and can be used to manage the bots and monitor their activity.\n\nThe main statistics displayed at the time of the writing are illustrated in table below (Figure 4):\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe scan bots are geographically distributed as follows: 3 in the United States, 3 in United Kingdom and 3 in Bulgaria (Figure 5):\n\nFigure 5\n\nMore information is provided in Appendix 2.\n\n### Attack flow\n\nThe APT28 group relies on three distinct attack vectors to infect their targets: spear phishing e-mails with crafted Word and Excel documents\nattached, phishing websites hosted on typosquatted domains and malicious iFrames leading to Java and Flash zero-day exploits.\n\nThe client usually gets infected by accessing an URL hosting an exploit kit. Upon successful exploitation, a first stage dropper (in our case\nthe name is runrun.exe) is written to the disk. Its main purpose is to drop a file (api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll)\nand execute it using rundll32.exe. This, in turn, contacts the C&C server and downloads the second stage component.\n\nThe second component is installed using the same method as described above. First, a dropper is executed (winloat.exe) which writes\none of the key components of the attack (advstoreshell.dll) to the disk, along with a configuration file (msd). The configuration\nfile contains essential information such as a list of three servers that the backdoor will try to contact (win*********ore.net\n**,micro********er.com and** **1***.net), the interval between requests and a flag that indicates whether key logging should be**\nactivated or not.\n\nAt this point, the attacker takes control of the machine and deploys different tools and components to achieve his goal. In the case we\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nanalyzed, the attacker downloaded 3 hacking tools:\n\n1. A tool to dump passwords from logged-in users (run.exe)\n\n2. A tool that exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2014-4076) to gain system privileges (xp.exe)\n\n3. A tool that acts as a proxy and allows the attacker to contact the system even if it is behind a router (svehost.exe)\n\nAn additional component is also downloaded (pr.dll) that is a modular component used to upload stolen data to the C&C.\n\n\n###### Backdoor and Second stage downloader (advstoreshell.dll)\n\n\n###### vTools: xp.exe run.exe svehost.exe\n\n\n###### Additional Module: Pr.dll\n\n\nThe attacked flow is described in the figure below (Figure 6):\n\nFigure 6\n\nMore information about the tools used is provided in Appendix 3. The first stage component and the second stage component are further\ndiscussed in Appendix 4 and Appendix 5, respectively. Finally, the additional module (pr.dll) is analyzed in Appendix 6.\n\nRight after deploying their payloads, the attacking party changed the time stamps of all the files downloaded by the second stage dropper\nto 14/04/2008, 16:00. This technique allowed the attackers to hide the files in case victims would suspect the attack and attempt to list\nnew files written on the disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe table below shows the compilation date and the file creation time for each of the files involved in the attack.\n\n**File Name** **Compilation Date** **Creation Time**\n\n%allusersappdata%\\xp.exe 12/03/2015 12:54:57 14/04/2008 16:00\n\n%allusersappdata%\\run.exe 05/04/2013 12:51:41 14/04/2008 16:00\n\n%allusersappdata%\\svehost.exe 22/04/2015 11:49:54 14/04/2008 16:00\n\n%localappdata%\\Microsoft Help\\advstorshell.dll 30/04/2015 13:13:13 14/04/2008 16:00\n\n%allusersappdata%\\msd 14/04/2008 16:00\n\n%allusersappdata%\\Pr.dll 13/05/2015 22:05:57 14/04/2008 16:00\n\n%temp%\\winloat.exe 30/04/2015 14:24:54 13/05/2015 17:23\n\n%temp%\\api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll 08/05/2015 13:39:32 13/05/2015 16:22\n\n%temp%\\runrun.exe 08/05/2015 13:45:31 13/05/2015 16:22\n\nTable 1\n\nThe latest creation date is 13/05/2015, which hints at the date the attack happened. Given that it took almost an hour from the moment the\nfirst downloader got written to the disk to the arrival of the second stage downloader, this process was likely carried out manually by a human\noperator. An important observation is that all of the components, except one, had been compiled before the attack. “%allusersappdata%\\\nPr.dll” is the only file that was compiled 5 hours after the compromise. This suggests this file was specifically built for the target.\n\n### Attacked victims\n\nThe victims we have identified belong to different industries and sectors. Our research shows that the attack targeted political figures,\ngovernment institutions, telecommunication and e-crime services, as well as aerospace companies from Germany, Ukraine, Russia and\nRomania.\n\nSome of the victims could be identified by analyzing the information stored on the central server we have investigated. The stored\ninformation contained traces of stolen information in the form of e-mails. Some were reported by our internal systems.\n\nThe e-mails we have identified on the central server revealed victims from the first two categories.\n\n**Political figures**\n\nOn 13[th] May 2015 two .pst files named ‘C:\\ProgramData\\backup.pst’ and ‘C:\\ProgramData\\backup2.pst’ were copied to\nthe server. The e-mails seem to be addressed to the [redacted].\n\n**Aerospace industry**\n\nOn July 9[th] 2015, fourteen archives were copied on the server. Among them were two .dbx (Outlook Express database) files. The e-mails\nseem related to [redacted].\n\nOn June 18th the file “F:\\Outlook Express\\AC_VTS_ÐÊÒ.dbx” was transferd to the central server. The emails belong to **[removed]**\n\nAlso on June 18[th,] the file “F:\\Outlook Express\\Kydla.dbx” was transfered on the server. The emails belong toSecond stage dropper (winloat.exe) **[redacted]**\n\n|File Name|Compilation Date|Creation Time|\n|---|---|---|\n|%allusersappdata%\\xp.exe|12/03/2015 12:54:57|14/04/2008 16:00|\n|%allusersappdata%\\run.exe|05/04/2013 12:51:41|14/04/2008 16:00|\n|%allusersappdata%\\svehost.exe|22/04/2015 11:49:54|14/04/2008 16:00|\n|%localappdata%\\Microsoft Help\\advstorshell.dll|30/04/2015 13:13:13|14/04/2008 16:00|\n|%allusersappdata%\\msd||14/04/2008 16:00|\n|%allusersappdata%\\Pr.dll|13/05/2015 22:05:57|14/04/2008 16:00|\n|%temp%\\winloat.exe|30/04/2015 14:24:54|13/05/2015 17:23|\n|%temp%\\api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll|08/05/2015 13:39:32|13/05/2015 16:22|\n|%temp%\\runrun.exe|08/05/2015 13:45:31|13/05/2015 16:22|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nAll these victims seem related to the aerospace industry or aircraft research programs. The context also supports the Russian origin, given\nthe huge media coverage of the Russian “smartplane” PAK FA T-50 **Fighter and America’s F-35. We presume the APT28 authors**\nmight have attempted to explore new technologies being developed in the aerospace industry for integration.\n\nOur internal services also flagged a number of computers as under attack, such as those belonging to [redacted]. In Romania, these\nflagged computers are part of government infrastructures or are closely related to the Romanian government.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Appendix 1 (Target campaigns)\n\nAnalyzing the APT28 command and control server identified two ongoing attempts to find new victims.\n\nThe process consists of scanning the ports of a large IP list, extracted from a database. The port scanning process is carried out via\nthe free tool “nmap”. If one of the ports is found open, the IP is marked as “vulnerable” and the corresponding information is saved. The\ncommand used for probing is illustrated in figure below:\n\n```\nnmap\n\n```\n```\n-T5\n-p 21,22,23,25,80,110,143,443,465,993,995,8080,7071,3389,5900\n-sV\n-O\n--version-light\n--script=banner\n--script=http-headers\n-oX out_name\n\n###### -iL targets_file\n\n```\n\nFigure 7\n\nWhere:\n\n**-T5:** scan will map a host in very little time, provided you are on a very fast network or don’t mind losing some information along the way.\n\n**-p: scan specific ports**\n\n**-sV: detect remote services (server / daemon) version numbers**\n\n**-O: identify a remote host apps and OS**\n\n**--version-light: enable light mode that makes version scanning much faster, but it is slightly less likely to identify services**\n\n**--script=banner: shows ftp banner responses**\n\n**--script=http-headers: performs a HEAD request for the root folder (“/”) of a web server and displays the HTTP headers returned.**\n\n-oX: logs the results of the scan in XML form into the file specified as an argument\n\n**-iL: reads target specifications from a given configuration file rather than from the command line; the file should contain a list of host or**\nnetwork expressions separated by spaces, tabs or newlines.\n\nThe first attempt we have identified started on 10[th] of February 2015 when a list of 8.762.102 IPs were scanned. Out of this large list,\n1.712.363 IPs were marked as “vulnerable.” The probing process lasted until February 14th. Most of the IPs were from Ukraine (8.536.272\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe number of scanned IPs is exhaustive, almost equal to the total number of IPs allocated to Ukraine. Searching through the major events\nregarding Ukraine in that time frame, we realized that the probing took place during the summit in Minsk regarding the ceasefire in the\nDonbass region of Eastern Ukraine. On February 11[, ]the leaders of Belarus, Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine met to negotiate the new\nset of peace measures that were announced on February 12 and signed on February 15.\n\nThe targeted countries in these campaigns are illustrated in table below (Table 2):\n\n###### Country Number of vulnerable IPs\n\n Ukraine 1704837\n\n Russian Federation 4666\n\n Romania 1287\n\n Bulgaria 1272\n\n United States 150\n\n Canada 149\n\n Italy 2\n\nTable 2\n\nOn February 14, a backup of the database was saved in a file (file.csv) and the attacker’s focus moved from Ukraine to Spain.\n\nOn February 16, a new attempt to find new victims was made. The new database was loaded with 58,624 new IP addresses, out of which\n6,146 were found vulnerable after probing. The targeted countries in this case are illustrated in Table 3:\n\n###### Country Number of vulnerable IPs\n\n Spain 5511\n\n United Kingdom 584\n\n Portugal 47\n\n United States 2\n\n Mexico 2\n\nTable 3\n\nSince in this second attempt the set of IPs is rather small, we presume that this attack was highly targeted to specific institutions. By\nanalyzing the target IP ranges, we were able to identify some of the victims.\n\nThe decision logic related to which victims should be infected is unknown to us at the time of writing, but we presume the vulnerable\ntargets are next engaged by a human attacker rather than in an automated way.\n\n|Country|Number of vulnerable IPs|\n|---|---|\n|Ukraine|1704837|\n|Russian Federation|4666|\n|Romania|1287|\n|Bulgaria|1272|\n|United States|150|\n|Canada|149|\n|Italy|2|\n\n|Country|Number of vulnerable IPs|\n|---|---|\n|Spain|5511|\n|United Kingdom|584|\n|Portugal|47|\n|United States|2|\n|Mexico|2|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Appendix 2 - The probing process\n\nThe screening process for finding new possible victims is carried out via multiple bots managed by a central command and control server.\nThe operational flow can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Generating new victims\n\nPotential victims are identified by port-scanning a list of IPs belonging to different subnets. This list is generated by a script, gen_ip.py,\nwhich iterates through IP classes and randomly picks IPs for port-probing. At the time of writing, the script has 11 IP classes hardcoded,\nwhich leads us to believe that victim organizations are picked manually.\n\nThe script generates random integer numbers that represent IPs belonging to these classes. The fact that it doesn’t iterate consecutively\nthrough all the IPs shows that the attackers have taken all precautions not to trigger alarms in the victims’ intrusion detection system scanning all the IPs from a subnet may raise suspicions.\n\nAll generated IPs are added to a database on the central server. Most of these IPs are from Spain and belong to political institutions\n([redacted]), telecommunication companies and public affairs institutions.\n\n2. Centralizing all information\n\nThe command and control server’s most important asset is the shodb database.

The activity of the first type is very poor (3 connection for each cookie), which leads us into believing that, over time,\nthere were two versions of bots and plugins running in parallel.

It stores the scan-bot-03.py script. This script describes the behavior\nof the system. The bot connects to the server and registers itself using a cookie. Once authenticated, the bot requests the last\nversion of the code from the sho_code table (update mechanism) and the last version of the plugin (sho_plugin) that has to\nbe executed. Once updated, it starts a list of threads that will use the latest plugin to scan the targeted IPs.\n\n        - **sho_log table is empty**\n\n        - **sho_setting table is empty**\n\nA Django application is also running on the server. It serves as an administrative and reporting interface for the bots and targets. The\nfigure below (figure 11) illustrates the admin panel. This interface allows a human operator to view statistics, add users, targets or bots\nor delete them.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe interface is very simple, representing just a wrapper over the database (figure 12: add user (up) add targets (below)):\n\nFigure 12\n\n1. _The bots_\n\nThe machines used to scan the potential victims are in different networks. This helps the attackers conceal that scans originating from\nthese IPs are part of the same operation.

When executed without arguments, it\nattempts to contact the IP address: 176.**.***.10 on port 443.\n\nIt can also be started with the following command line:\n\nsvehost.exe start <ipaddress> <port>\n\nThe file uses an old version of the OpenSSL library (OpenSSL 1.0.1e). In fact, the reason this file is 1038 kilobytes in size is because of the\ninclusion of this library.\n\nThe main purpose of the tool is to allow an attacker to contact systems behind a router, which otherwise would not be accessible from\noutside the network.\n\n###### Privilege escalation tool (xp.exe)\n\nThe tool is built around a vulnerability discovered in 2014 (CVE-2014-4076) and works by sending a specially crafted package to the \\\\.\\\\\nTCP device through the use of DeviceIoControl function. The vulnerability was fixed in late 2014.\n\nThe tool works by receiving one executable file as argument. The tool will then run this executable file with system privileges.\n\nThe file is compiled using the debug configuration. Because of this, a path to a pdb file is also hardcoded into the file. The path references\nC:\\Users\\Пользователь\\Desktop\\cve-2014-4076\\cve-19abdba\\Debug\\CVE-2014-4076.pdb\n\nThe string Пользователь means users in Russian. This is one of the reasons we suspect the authors are Russian speakers.\n\n###### Password dumping tool (run.exe)\n\nThis seems to be based on the source of a public tool (mimikatz) for dumping passwords out of WDigest through LSASS. More information\nabout the tool can be found by visiting the author’s page: http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz.\n\nThe file was compiled on 05/05/2013 and does not contain any version info. This suggests the authors used a custom build.\n\nThe tool receives a file as argument. The retrieved password will then be dumped into the file passed as argument.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Appendix 4 (First stage component)\n\nThis is the first component that gets on the computer after infection. Its purpose is to contact the C&C server and ask for further instructions.\n\nThe first stage payload is made of two items: a dropper and a first stage backdoor. The dropper, which in our case is named runrun.\n**exe, has embedded the file api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll** in the data section. The dropper uses many custom\nencryption algorithms to protect itself from reverse-engineering.\n\nThe following algorithm (Algorithm 1) is used to decrypt its APIs:\n\nAlgorithm1:\n\n```\nb[idxbuff+1] = b[idxbuff+1] ^ b[idxbuff] ^ key[(idxbuff+1)%keylen]\n\n```\n\nThe payload (api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll) is encrypted using RTL and a custom encryption algorithm that uses\na 10 byte key (Algorithm 2):\n\nAlgorithm2:\n\n```\n)unsigned char encrypt1(int pos\n{\n;xor = 0\n)++for(int i=0;i<key_length;i\n;)xor ^= key[i] + (unsigned char)(i*pos\nreturn xorl\n}\n\n```\n\nThe dropped file is a downloader that contacts the C&C to get the second stage component. It contacts the domain: www.msc****vw.com\nand the IP address: 91.***.**.249.\n\nThe requests are performed via GET over HTTP. They are randomly generated. Each request has 1 to 5 groups of 1 to 6 randomly generated\nchars and numbers. Each group is separated by a slash. An example of a request is given below:\n```\n    /ue/VHghm/ihXAIK/qpi/1c9.xml/?XK1=VrLYQndXGXwzURh9RBE=\n\n```\nThe xml extension present above is actually picked from 4 available extensions (xml, pdf, html, zip).\n\nThe final argument is an encrypted key, probably used by the downloader to authenticate itself to the server.\n\nThis file works as a rudimentary backdoor that has the following commands available:\n\n- Download\n\n- Execute\n\n- Delete files\n\nSince it took more than an hour for the second stage component to be downloaded to the infected system, we presume this is downloaded\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Appendix 5 (Second Stage Component)\n\nThe purpose of the second stage component is to open a backdoor to allow the attacker to assess the target and download additional\ncomponents.\n\na. Dropper:\n\nAs the First Stage Component, the important file is being installed using a dropper. (winloat.exe)\n\nThe main steps followed by the dropper are:\n\n1. Decrypt its overlay (containing the backdoor: advstoreshell.dll and the configuration file: msd)\n\n2. Write payload on disk\n\n3. Call the InitW method of advstoreshell.dll\n\nb. Configuration File:\n\nTo encrypt/decrypt the configuration file and the APIs used by advstoreshell.dll the component uses a custom stream cypher with\nkey length of 6. The function given below is used to retrieve the corresponding byte used to XOR at an index in the buffer.\n\nAlgorithm 3:\n\n```\nunsigned char decrypt(unsigned char key[6], uint32& buffer_pos)\n{\n       ixk = buffer_pos % 6 +2;\n       ixb = (unsigned char)(ixk);\n       buffer_pos++;\n       v_10 = key[(ixk -2)%6]^byte((uint32(ixb)*uint32(key[ixk-2])) >> 7)\n       v_11 = key[(ixk+1)%6] ^ ixb;\n       xc = (key [ixk%6] & v_11) + v10;\n       return xc\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe configuration file (msd) file is encrypted using the algorithm described above and is 122 bytes long. It contains the following information:\n\n**Computer** **Two domain** **Keylogging** **Main**\n**Timeout1** **Timeout2** **Name** **names** **Campaign id** **?** **?** **flag** **domain**\n**name**\n\nWhere:\n\n- Timeout1 = 60000 ; represents the number of miliseconds until timeout is reached when contacting the C&C\n\n- Timeout2 = 60000 ; represents the number of miliseconds until timeout is reached when using contacting the C&C using encryption\n\n- Computer name = DAE13WS01204030501 ; The name of the infected computer\n\n- DomainName1= micro**********ter.info\n\n- DomainName2=dri********te.info\n\n- Campaign id = rhbp ; we are still investigating the meaning of this field, but it is very likely a campaign identifier\n\n- ? = 1000 ; we are still investigating the role of this field, although preliminary information leads us to believe that it is used as a counter\n\n- ? = 600000; we are still investigating the meaning of this field, but it is very likely another timeout value\n\n- Keylogging flag = 1; this indicates whether the backdoor should intercept keystrokes and send them to the C&C server.\n\n- Main domain name = 1***.net ; this is the first domain that the malware tries to connect\n\nc. Backdoor Component:\n\nThe most important component of APT28 is the backdoor, in this case, the file called advstoreshell.dll. This file reads the configuration\nfile (msd) and contacts the C&C servers indicated in the configuration file. It can also read the configuration file from the registry. The\nconfiguration stored in the registry is probably obtained via update from one of the C&C servers.\n\nOn the system we have analyzed, there were two configurations:\n\n1. The first one being the msd file that was located in the same path with advstoreshell.dll\n\n2. The second one was found in registry (HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\\n**Path). It contains almost the same data as the msd file except for the first two domain names that are changed to win[redacted]**\nore.net and micr[redacted]er.com.\n\nThis was the only component that was set to run at startup. This was achieved by creating the value AdvancedStorageShell in HKCU\\\n**Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the contents:**\n\n**“RUNDLL32.EXE “C:\\Documents and Settings\\<user-name>\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Microsoft Help\\advstorshell.dll”, InitW”**\n\n|Timeout1|Timeout2|Computer Name|Two domain names|Campaign id|?|?|Keylogging flag|Main domain name|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe backdoor is highly advanced and supports 26 commands. We analyzed some of the supported commands, while the analysis for the\nrest is still in progress.\n\n5 find file\n\n6 get file content and timestamps\n\n9 enumerate registry keys and values\n\n10 set registry value\n\n11 delete registry value\n\n13 start process using CreateProcess\n\n14 kill process by id\n\n16 start process using cmd /c\n\n17 list drives and types\n\n19 read file from offset\n\n21 get system info (run systeminfo in cmd)\n\n25 create thread\n\nWhen running a command using the cmd /c option, the output is saved in a file named tmp.dat\n\nCommunication between this component and the C&C server is carried out on port HTTP (443). If this is not possible, it attempts to\nconnect on port 80. In some cases, the communication is encrypted using 3DES and RSA.\n\nOne important function of this backdoor is that it can load external components. It can achieve this goal by calling the init function of\nany dll. This is how the s plugin is loaded.\n\n|ll in progress.|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|5|find file|\n|6|get file content and timestamps|\n|9|enumerate registry keys and values|\n|10|set registry value|\n|11|delete registry value|\n|13|start process using CreateProcess|\n|14|kill process by id|\n|16|start process using cmd /c|\n|17|list drives and types|\n|19|read file from offset|\n|21|get system info (run systeminfo in cmd)|\n|25|create thread|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Appendix 6 - Additional module\n\nThe final component installed by APT28 is a module named pr.dll. This file was compiled 5 hours after the system was compromised.\nThis discrepancy in time prompts us that the file is individually crafted for each target system.\n\nThe file seems to be a modular framework that can accommodate different modules. It stores its configuration in an encrypted format, and\nsaves it in the Registry key “HKU\\S-1-5-19_Classes\\Software\\Microsoft\\MediaPlayer\\{some_clsid}\\chnnl” .\n\nOnce executed, the malware checks for the presence of a mutex (XSQWERSystemCriticalSection_for_1232321) to make sure that another\ninstance of itself is not already running. After that, it contacts the server (the IP: 198.[redacted].74 or the domain name sec[redacted]win.\ncom). During the initial communication, the backdoor sends an encrypted buffer to the C&C server that contains a RC4 key and the IDs of\nthe plugins it has installed. The buffer is shown below:\n\n###### 03 33 02 03 33 23 03 21 23 06 21 23 3A 66 95 64 4B 56 FF 22 4D 81 4F\n\nWe can identify plugins with the following ids from the buffer above: 0x3302, 0x3303, 0x2103, 0x2106\n\nAn interesting aspect of the pr.dll is that it creates two pipes that are presumably used to collect data sent by other processes.\n\nThe **pr.dll seems to be a Windows version of a Linux file found on the server. The server hosts 4 elf files, two built for the x86**\narchitecture (075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39, **f3bf929a35c3f198226b88537d9ccb1a) and two for the x64 architecture**\n(2683624eacc490238e98c449bddbb573, 5bf524a4860f3c33e3ad77b6b625db37). The elf file uses SQLite3 rather than Registry\nto store its configuration. The database named My_BD holds two values chnnl and prms.\n\nThe files attempt to contact the server by constructing random requests. Each request is made of one of the verbs (watch/, search/,\nresults/, search/, close) and two to nine arguments (selected from the list: text=, from=, itwm=, ags=, oe=, aq=, btnG=, oprnd=, utm=,\nchannel=). The values of the arguments are randomly generated.\n\nAn example of a request is given below:\n\n**_h[tt]p://198.***.***.74/watch/?aq=JTfJRp-s&oprnd=Dwtee&itwm=niKMuGE9Mp9Md9vHdggZMS16YlSTx&btnG=t&oprnd=FbLtw&AVVAT=m_**\n**_8I2tN_**\n\nThe elf files contain the following modules:\n1. AgentModule\n2. KernelProvider\n3. AgentKernel\n4. ChannelController\n5. Cryptor\n6. LocalStorage (sqlite3)\n7. ReserverApi\n8. AgentChannel\n9. HttpChannel\n10. FSModule\n11. RemoteShell\n12. RemoteKeylogger\n\nAs stated above, there are two versions for each architecture. The only difference between them is that one version does not include the\nlast two modules.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### About the Authors\n\n**Răzvan Benchea has been working as a malware researcher for more than eight years.
