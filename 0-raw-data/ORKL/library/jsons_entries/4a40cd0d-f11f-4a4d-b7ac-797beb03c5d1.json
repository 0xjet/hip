In](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-analyzing-various-layers-agentteslas-packing/)\nthe announcement message posted on the Agent Tesla Discord server, the keylogger’s developers suggested people switch over to a\nnew keylogger: “If you want to see a powerful software like Agent Tesla, we would like to suggest you OriginLogger. OriginLogger is an\nAT-based software and has all the features.” OriginLogger is a variant of Agent Tesla. As such, the majority of tools and detections for\nAgent Tesla will still trigger on OriginLogger samples.\n\nRecently, when sitting down to analyze some malware tagged as Agent Tesla, I was surprised to learn I was actually looking at\nsomething else. This fact revealed itself to me when I began analyzing the malware families’ configurations at scale after creating tooling\nto extract them.\n\nIn this blog, I will cover the OriginLogger keylogger malware, how it handles the string obfuscation for configuration variables and what I\nfound when looking at the extracted configurations that allowed for better identification and further pivoting.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from both OriginLogger and its predecessor malware Agent Tesla through Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n[and the Next-Generation Firewall with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) [cloud-delivered security services including WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions) [Advanced Threat Prevention.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-threat-prevention)\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Agent Tesla](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/agenttesla/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n\n-----\n\nOriginLogger Builder\nDropper Lure\n\nOriginLogger Configuration\n\nIdentifying OriginLogger Through Artifacts\n\nMalicious Infrastructure\n\nConclusion\n\n## OriginLogger Builder\n\nWhen I began researching OriginLogger, I could find little to no public information about it. There are several Agent Tesla-related\nanalysis blogs that I now recognize as pertaining to OriginLogger – sometimes tagged as “AgentTeslav3” – but otherwise, the public\ninternet is pretty light on relevant information.\n\n[During my search, I stumbled across a YouTube video posted in 2018 (before Agent Tesla closed up shop) by a person selling “fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-MDujYrtto)\nundetectable” (FUD) tools. This person showed off the OriginLogger tools with a link to buy it from a known site that traffics in malware,\nexploits and the like.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOriginLogger feature highlights (Source: screenshots of the OriginLogger sale page from a YouTube video on OriginLogger).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nOriginLogger feature list.\nAdditionally, they showed both the web panel and the malware builder.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.\n\nOriginLogger web panel (Source: OriginLogger YouTube video).\n\nFigure 4. OriginLogger builder.\nThe image of the builder shown in Figure 4 was particularly interesting to me as it provided a default string – – that might be unique to\nthis application. Sure enough, a content search on VirusTotal shows one matching file (SHA256:\n[595a7ea981a3948c4f387a5a6af54a70a41dd604685c72cbd2a55880c2b702ed) uploaded on May 17, 2022.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/595a7ea981a3948c4f387a5a6af54a70a41dd604685c72cbd2a55880c2b702ed)\n\nFigure 5.\n\nVirusTotal search for string.\nDownloading and attempting to run this file resulted in errors due to missing dependencies; however, knowing the builder’s filename,\nOriginLogger.exe, allowed me to expand the search and locate a Zip archive (SHA256:\n[b22a0dd33d957f6da3f1cd9687b9b00d0ff2bdf02d28356c1462f3dbfb8708dd) containing all of the files required to run OriginLogger.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b22a0dd33d957f6da3f1cd9687b9b00d0ff2bdf02d28356c1462f3dbfb8708dd)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6.\n\nBundled files in Zip archive.\nThe settings.ini file contains the configuration the builder will use, and in Figure 7 we can see the previous search string listed under\nSmartWords.\n\nFigure 7.\n\nOriginLogger Builder settings.ini file.\nThe file profile.origin contains the embedded username/password that a customer registers with when purchasing OriginLogger.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8.\n\nOriginLogger builder login screen.\nAmusingly, if you flip around the values in the profile file, the plaintext password is revealed.\n\nFigure 9.\nContents of profile.origin file.\n\nFigure\n\n10. OriginLogger builder login screen with threat actor password revealed in plaintext.\nWhen a user logs in, the builder attempts to authenticate with the OriginLogger servers to validate the subscription.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this point, I had two versions of the builder. The first one (b22a0d ), contained in the Zip file, was compiled Sept. 6, 2020. The other,\nwhich contained the SmartWords string (595a7e*), was compiled on June 29, 2022, just about two years after the first.\n\nThe later version makes its authentication request over TCP/3345 to IP 23.106.223[.]46. Since March 3, 2022, this IP has resolved to the\ndomain originpro[.]me. This domain has resolved to the following IP addresses:\n\n23.106.223[.]46\n\n204.16.247[.]26\n\n31.170.160[.]61\n\nThe second IP, 204.16.247[.]26, stands out due to resolving these other OriginLogger related domains:\n\noriginproducts[.]xyz\n\norigindproducts[.]pw\n\noriginlogger[.]com\n\nThings get more interesting when looking at the older builder. This one attempts to reach out to a different IP address for the\nauthentication.\n\nFigure\n\n11. PCAP showing remote IP address.Unlike the IP addresses associated with originpro[.]me, 74.118.138[.]76 does not resolve to any\nOriginLogger domains directly but instead resolves to 0xfd3[.]com. Pivoting on this domain shows it contains both DNS MX and TXT\nrecords for mail.originlogger[.]com.\nBeginning around March 7, 2022, the domain in question began resolving to IP 23.106.223[.]47, which is one value higher in the last\noctet than the IP used for originpro[.]me, which used 46.\n\nThese two IP addresses have shared multiple SSL certificates:\n\n\nSHA1 Serial Number Common\nName\n\n[2dec9fdf91c3965960fecb28237b911a57a543e2](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/sha1?query=2dec9fdf91c3965960fecb28237b911a57a543e2) [38041735159378560318847695768150611562](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/serialNumber?query=38041735159378560318847695768150611562) WIN4K804V6ADVQ\n\n[7a7e732229287c1d53a360e08201616179217117](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/sha1?query=7a7e732229287c1d53a360e08201616179217117) [133152806647474295963986900899009859692](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/serialNumber?query=133152806647474295963986900899009859692) WIN4K804V6ADVQ\n\n[3b3cf8039b779d93677273e09961203ffaac2d6f](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/sha1?query=3b3cf8039b779d93677273e09961203ffaac2d6f) [89480234209393487842197137895395039274](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/serialNumber?query=89480234209393487842197137895395039274) WIN4K804V6ADVQ\n\n_Table 1.

User 0xfd GitHub.\nI’ll circle back to these later in the blog when looking at the code, but (spoiler alert) they are also used in OriginLogger.\n\n## Dropper Lure\n\nBefore diving into the malware, I’ll quickly cover the dropper that led to the sample I set out to analyze. As both Agent Tesla and\nOriginLogger are commercialized keyloggers, the initial droppers will vary greatly between campaigns and should not be considered\nunique to either. I present the below as a real-world example of an attack dropping OriginLogger and show that they can be quite\nconvoluted and obfuscated.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial lure document is a Microsoft Word file (SHA256:\n[ccc8d5aa5d1a682c20b0806948bf06d1b5d11961887df70c8902d2146c6d1481).

This tool is used to hollow out a process and inject another executable inside of it; in this case, the keylogger](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/CSharp-RunPE/blob/master/RunPE/RunPE.cs)\npayload will be placed inside the aspnet_compiler.exe process.\n\nFigure\n\n19. PowerShell command to execute method contained in dotNet assembly.Note the projFUD.PA class that the Execute method is called\n[from. Morphisec released a blog in 2021 called “Revealing the Snip3 Crypter, a highly evasive RAT loader,” where they analyze a](https://blog.morphisec.com/revealing-the-snip3-crypter-a-highly-evasive-rat-loader)\ncrypter-as-a-service and fingerprint the crypter’s author using this artifact.\nThe second of the two files (SHA256: cddca3371378d545e5e4c032951db0e000e2dfc901b5a5e390679adc524e7d9c) is the\nOriginLogger payload.\n\n## OriginLogger Configuration\n\nAs previously stated, the original intention of this analysis was to automate and extract configuration-related details from the keylogger.\nTo achieve this, I started by looking at how the configuration-related strings are used.\n\nI won’t be diving into any of the actual functionality of the malware as it’s fairly standard and mirrors analysis of older Agent Tesla\nvariants. Just as the threat actors’ advertisements state, the malware uses tried and true methods and includes the ability to keylog, steal\ncredentials, take screenshots, download additional payloads, upload your data in a myriad of ways and attempt to avoid detection.\n\nTo start extracting configuration-related details, I needed to figure out how the user-supplied data is stored in the malware; it turned out\nto be straightforward. The builder will take the dynamic string values and concatenate them into a giant blob of text which is then\nencoded and stored in a byte array to be decoded at runtime. Once the malware runs and hits a particular function that needs a string,\nsuch as the HTTP address to upload screenshots to, it will pass the offset and string length to a function that will then carve out the text\nat that location within the blob.\n\nTo illustrate, below you can see the decoding logic used for the main blob of text.\n\nFigure\n\n20. OriginLogger plaintext blob decoding.\nEach byte is XOR’d by the index of the byte within the byte array, and again XOR’d by the value 170 to reveal the plaintext.\n\nFor each sample generated by the builder, this blob of text will differ depending on what’s configured, so offsets and positioning will\nchange. Looking at the raw text shown in Figure 21 is helpful, but without splicing it up, it becomes hard to determine where the\nboundaries end or begin.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n21. Plaintext blob.\nIt also does not help when it comes time to analyze the malware, as you won’t be able to discern when or where something is used. To\nfigure this next piece out, I needed to look at how OriginLogger handles the splicing.\n\nBelow you can see the function responsible for carving out the string, followed by the beginning of the individual methods containing the\noffset and length.\n\nFigure\n\n22. OriginLogger string functions.\nIn this case, if the B() method is called at some point by the malware, it will pass 2, 2, 27 to the obfuscated nameless function at the top\nof the image. The first integer is used for the array index where the decoded string will be stored. The second (offset) and third (length)\nintegers are then passed to the GetString function to obtain the text. For this particular entry, the resulting value – <font\n\n\n-----\n\ncolor #00b1ba b [ is used during the creation of the HTML page it uploads to display the stolen data.\n\nKnowing how the string parsing works, I could then automate the extraction of these strings. To start, it helps to look at the underlying\nintermediate language (IL) assembly instructions.\n\nFigure\n\n23. OriginLogger IL instructions for string function.\nFor each of these lookups, the structure of the function block will remain the same. At index 6-8 in Figure 23, you will see three ldc.i4.X\ninstructions where X dictates an integer value that will be pushed onto the stack before calling the previously described splicing function.\nThis overall structure creates a framework that can then be used to match all of the corresponding functions in the binary for parsing.\n\nLeveraging this, I wrote a script to identify the encoded byte array, determine the XOR values and then splice up the decoded blob in the\nsame fashion the malware uses it. With this, you can scroll through the decoded strings and look for things of interest. Once something\nis identified, knowing the offset and subsequent function name, you can pivot into the part of the malware that leverages them.\n\nFigure 24. OriginLogger decoded strings.\n\nFrom here, I started renaming the obfuscated methods to reflect their actual values, which made analysis easier on the eyes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n25. OriginLogger FTP upload function.\n[It should be noted that the same string deobfuscation can be achieved by using de4dot and its dynamic string decryption feature by](https://github.com/de4dot/de4dot)\nspecifying the string types as delegate and identifying the tokens of interest. This works extremely well for single file analysis.\n\nRecall that I mentioned in the OriginLogger Builder section of this blog that I’d circle back to the GitHub repositories of the 0xfd3 user.\nTake a look in Figure 26 at the Chrome Password Recovery code uploaded in March 2020 after OriginLogger took Agent Tesla’s\nprominence in the keylogger world.\n\n\n-----\n\n26. Chrome Password Recovery.\nCompare Figure 26 to the code from the OriginLogger sample with renamed methods shown in Figure 27.\n\n27. OriginLogger Chrome password stealing function.\nLook familiar? These types of similarities abound as OriginLogger has continued development where Agent Tesla left off.\n\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\n\n-----\n\n## Identifying OriginLogger Through Artifacts\n\nUsing this tooling, I extracted 1,917 different configurations, which gives insight into the exfiltration methods used and allows for\nclustering of samples based on the underlying infrastructure.\n\nThis is where I began to understand that what I was looking at wasn’t Agent Tesla but instead a different keylogger – OriginLogger. Two\nparticular exfiltration methods that both showed multiple references to “origin” in some fashion led me to connect the dots.\n\nFor example, one of the URLs configured for a sample to upload keylogger and screenshot data to was\nhxxps://agusanplantation[.]com/new/new/inc/7a5c36cee88e6b.php. This URL is no longer active so I started searching for historical\ninformation about it to understand what was on the receiving end of these HTTP POST requests. By plugging in the domain to\n[URLScan.io, it showed login pages for the panel in the same directory but, more importantly, that the OriginLogger web panel (SHA256:](https://urlscan.io/search/#agusanplantation.com)\nc2a4cf56a675b913d8ee0cb2db3864d66990e940566f57cb97a9161bd262f271) was observed on this host at the time of scanning four\nmonths ago.\n\nFigure\n\n28. URLScan.io scan history for domain.Similarly, one of the exfiltration methods is through Telegram bots. To utilize them, OriginLogger\nrequires a Telegram bot token to be included so the malware can interact with it. This provides another unique opportunity to analyze the\ninfrastructure in use. In this case, I can use the token to query Telegram with what equates to a whoami command and observe the\nnames used by the bot creator. Below are a handful of examples showing relevant naming.\n\"id\":2046248941,\"is_bot\":true,\"first_name\":\"origin\",\"username\":\"mailerdemon_bot\"\n\n\"id\":1731070785,\"is_bot\":true,\"first_name\":\"@CodeOnce_bot\",\"username\":\"PWORIGIN_bot\"\n\n\"id\":1644755040,\"is_bot\":true,\"first_name\":\"ORIGINLOGGER\",\"username\":\"softypaulbot\"\n\n\"id\":1620445910,\"is_bot\":true,\"first_name\":\"ORIGINLOGS\",\"username\":\"badboi450hbot\"\n\n\"id\":2081699912,\"is_bot\":true,\"first_name\":\"Zara\",\"username\":\"Zaraoriginbot\"\n\n\"id\":5054839999,\"is_bot\":true,\"first_name\":\"Origin Poster\",\"username\":\"origin_post_bot\"\n\n## Malicious Infrastructure\n\nLike other keyloggers that are commercially sold, OriginLogger is used by a wide variety of people for various malicious purposes around\n[the globe. In the past, I’ve written about taking a deeper look at the victims of keyloggers and what analyzing their screenshots can](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/keybase-threat-grows-despite-public-takedown-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words/)\nreveal about the potential intentions of the attackers. In this blog post, I will summarize some observations of the data extracted from the\ncorpus of OriginLogger samples I collected. Most samples had multiple exfiltration techniques configured and I’ll cover each one below.\n\n**SMTP is still the primary mechanism used for exfiltrating data and was identified in 1,909 samples. This is most likely because:**\n\nThe traffic will blend in with normal user traffic better than other included protocols.It’s relatively easy for attackers to obtain stolen\ne-mail accounts.\nE-mail providers usually offer a large amount of storage space.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were 296 unique e mail recipient addresses for the stolen data and 334 unique e mail account credentials used to send them.\n\n**FTP was configured in 1,888 samples using 56 unique FTP servers and 79 unique FTP accounts, with multiple accounts logging to**\ndifferent directories, likely based on different campaigns. Across the accessible servers, which were limited to 11 of the 56, there are 442\nunique victims, with some victims being logged hundreds of times.\n\n**Web uploads to the OriginLogger panel followed closely behind and were configured in 1,866 samples, uploading to 92 unique URLs.**\nWhen analyzing these URLs, the PHP file used for the upload showed a pattern of alphanumeric characters in the filename, with a\ncouple of additional patterns presenting themselves in the directory structure. Looking into the source code of the web panel as shown in\nFigure 29 shows that the PHP filename is an MD5 value of some random bytes and is placed in the /inc/ (incoming) directory.\n\nFigure\n\n29. OriginLogger source code for setup.php.\nKeep in mind that many keylogger purchasers may not have much technical experience and tend to use a “full service” vendor that\ncreates everything for them so that all they are required to do is distribute the keylogger. I suspect this is a reason for a lot of the URIs\nhaving similar structures. For example, the structure http://<ipaddress>/<name>/inc/<md5>.php is repeated throughout, and the first\nlevel of the directory shows values unlikely to be generated automatically – possibly account-related:\n\nb0ss/inc\n\nrich/inc\n\ndivine/inc\n\nma2on/inc\n\ndarl/inc\n\njboy/inc\n\nnewmoney/inc\n\nLikewise, this directory structure changes the inc to mawa and prepends webpanel to the name:\n\nwebpanel-roth/mawa\n\nwebpanel-qwerty/mawa\n\nwebpanel-dawn/mawa\n\nwebpanel-charles/mawa\n\nwebpanel-muti/mawa\n\nwebpanel-ghul/mawa\n\nwebpanel-reza/mawa\n\nFor the last exfiltration method, we have Telegram identified in 1,732 samples with 181 unique Telegram bots receiving the stolen data.\nIn addition to being able to issue a whoami for the bot, we’re able to query for information related to the channels where stolen\ninformation was uploaded. The most prominent of the channels are below with the details currently in use:\n\nCount Channel Bio Owner Bot Name\n\n41 Invest in bitcoin now and attain financial freedom Alaa Ahmed obomike_bot\n\n25 Free Cannabis 🌵🌵 Cry_ptoSand sales3w7_bot, oasisx_bot,\nvaliat073_bot\n\n\n21 Atrium Investment Ltd: We Help You ACHIEVE YOUR\nLIFE GOALS\n\n\nDoris E.

Prominent Channels_\n\nFinally, one feature that is not utilized very often is the ability for OriginLogger to download an additional payload after infecting the victim\nsystem. In the samples discussed here, only two were configured to download additional malware.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOriginLogger, much like its parent Agent Tesla, is a commoditized keylogger that shares many overlapping similarities and code, but it’s\nimportant to distinguish between the two for tracking and understanding. Commercial keyloggers have historically catered to less\nadvanced attackers, but as illustrated in the initial lure document analyzed here, this does not make attackers any less capable of using\nmultiple tools and services to obfuscate and make analysis more complicated. Commercial keyloggers should be treated with equal\namounts of caution as would be used with any malware.\n\nLuckily, in this instance, because of the similarities between the two aforementioned keyloggers, detections and protections carried over\nfrom one generation to the next – albeit with slightly inaccurate signature naming.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from both OriginLogger and its predecessor malware Agent Tesla through Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n[and the Next-Generation Firewall with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) [cloud-delivered security services including WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions) [Advanced Threat Prevention.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-threat-prevention)\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
