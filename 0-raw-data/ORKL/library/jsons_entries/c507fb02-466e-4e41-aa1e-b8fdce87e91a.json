We have also notified the payment card networks and law\nenforcement. The payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely\nreported. We regret that this occurred and apologize to our customers for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\n### Intersport\n\nA similar incident was also detailed today by antivirus maker ESET, impacting [the website of Intersport, one of Europe's largest sporting goods](https://www.intersport.com/)\n[retail chains, with more than 5,800 stores across the continent.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersport)\n\nThe skimmer wasn't loaded on all versions of the Intersport website, but only on the local versions serving customers in Croatia, Serbia,\nSlovenia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n[According to de Groot, who also looked into the Intersport incident, the company's stores got hacked on April 30, cleaned on May 3, and then](https://twitter.com/sansecio/status/1272447559341146112)\nhacked again on May 14. ESET said the company removed the malicious code within hours after being notified of the latest hack.\n\nCustomers who made purchases on the impacted Intersport websites should contact their card company and monitor statements for fraudulent\npurchases.\n\n[However, In a statement provided to ZDNet and also published on the company's website, Intersport admitted to the incident but said that \"no](https://www.intersport.si/corpo/2020/06/15/poskus-napada-na-spletne-strani-intersport/)\npayment card information were intercepted.\"\n\nBoth the Claire's and Intersport incidents took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic when most physical stores had been closed,\nand the companies redirected users toward their online sites for product purchases.\n\n_Article updated on June 15, 11:50 am ET with statement from Claire's, and again on June 18, 05:40am with statement from Intersport._\n\n**The FBI's most wanted cybercriminals**\n\n\n-----",
