This cause the losing party to end up\nwith a big fat nothing and a ruined reputation on underground forums.\n\nThe groups colliding on the real victim's server are from the MageCart line of\ncybercriminals, identified by the Yonathan Kliknsma of RiskIQ in order of their appearance,\nas group 3 and group 9. Obviously, one of them is better at this game and that is the latter.\n\nSay hello to Magecart group 3 being bullied by Magecart group 9.\n[https://t.co/omO9D1Co3h](https://t.co/omO9D1Co3h)\n\n[— Yonathan Klijnsma (@ydklijnsma) November 20, 2018](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/1064977845582127104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIndependent security researcher Willem de Groot and Jérôme Segura of Malwarebytes\npublished two reports about the web-skimming code from Magecart group 9 wrecking their\ncompetition's operation.\n\n[The 'playground' was the website of Umbro Brazil and the B.Liv online cosmetics shop.](https://www.bliv.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hunting for rival s exfiltration domains\n\nAccording to the researchers, the code used by group 9 is heavily obfuscated and it can\ndetect the presence of other web-skimmers on the server. If a competing skimmer is\ndetected, it intercepts the card data captured by the competition and changes the last card\nnumber so that the data becomes worthless.\n\nTo trigger the data-poisoning mechanism, the code checks for domain names used by the\ncompetitor to exfiltrate the payment details. If detected, it generates a random number from\n0-9 and replaces the last card number with it.\n\n**Detecting competitor's exfiltration domain and changing card number (credit:**\n**Malwarebytes)**\nSegura [says that the slight modification of the card number may be sufficient to pass](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/11/web-skimmers-compete-umbro-brasil-hack/)\nvalidation, but the payment information is useless.\n\nSelling non-working card data on the black market is a serious hit to the seller's reputation,\nde Groot explains.\n\n\"Why the subtle sabotage, instead of just killing the inferior skimmer? On the dark web\n[markets, reputation is everything,\" stated de Groot in a blog post about the competing](http://gwillem.gitlab.io/2018/11/20/warring-magecart-factions/)\nskimmers. \"If one sells non-working cards, angry customers will publicly complain and it will\ndestroy the competing “brand”.\"\n\nSabotaging competition is a strategy seen in the past in cryptomining operations.\n[GhostMiner, the first fileless cryptocurrency miner scans and stops other processes that](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ghostminer-uses-fileless-techniques-removes-other-miners-but-makes-only-200/)\n[may be mining on the host, a behavior later adopted by CroniX.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cronix-cryptominer-kills-rivals-to-reign-supreme/)\n\nMagecart operations typically take advantage of third-party scripts that are loaded at\ncheckout. To protect themselves, website owners should remove payment information\npages any components that are not required to process the transaction or customer\ndata. Risk of compromise is further reduced by keeping plugins updated to the latest\nversion.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Credit card stealers are getting much stealthier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-credit-card-stealers-are-getting-much-stealthier/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Caramel credit card stealing service is growing in popularity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/caramel-credit-card-stealing-service-is-growing-in-popularity/)\n\n[Refine your JavaScript knowledge with this training bundle deal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/refine-your-javascript-knowledge-with-this-training-bundle-deal/)\n\n[Ukraine targeted by DDoS attacks from compromised WordPress sites](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-targeted-by-ddos-attacks-from-compromised-wordpress-sites/)\n\n[Hacked WordPress sites force visitors to DDoS Ukrainian targets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacked-wordpress-sites-force-visitors-to-ddos-ukrainian-targets/)\n\n[JavaScript](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/javascript/)\n[MageCart](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/magecart/)\n[Skimmer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/skimmer/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
