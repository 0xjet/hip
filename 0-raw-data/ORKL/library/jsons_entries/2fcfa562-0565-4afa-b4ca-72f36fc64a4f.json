However, examination of both open-source reporting and cybercrime\ncommunities don’t reveal a current, well-established attacker interest in the platform.\nKELA assumes cybercrime actors might be having a hard time monetizing Slack\n**compromises since the cloud-based app grants no direct access to a target’s network,**\nand pivoting from it to other internal applications requires a combination of tedious\nreconnaissance and sheer luck.\nThe growth of “big game hunting” tactics in ransomware and the monetization of\ntargeted intrusions lead us to believe that interest in Slack – and other cloud-based\napps expanding the corporate attack surface – will probably grow in the future.\nAs such, KELA strongly recommends implementing an automated, scalable\n**monitoring solution that offers insights into cybercrime activities targeting cloud-**\nbased apps storing sensitive data.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of June 2020, KELAs research team noted a threat actor, active on a Russian[speaking forum, who posted an ad selling access to a Nasdaq Boardvantage environment](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/boardvantage)\nused by a Brazilian mining company. The credentials allegedly provide access to sensitive\ninternal materials, and according to the seller can also be used to “distribute ransomware”.\n\n_A threat actor’s post on a Russian-speaking cybercrime forum_\n\nThe apparently-novice actor disclosed too many details demonstrating the breach, and it was\npicked up by security researchers and shut down. However, the incident highlights threat\n**actors’ interest in gaining access to cloud-based apps used for internal**\n**communications and storing corporate data.**\n\n**Another event demonstrating this trend, although much larger in scale and**\n**consequences,** **is the Twitter hack from last week. The incident is still under investigation,**\nbut there is one known fact: the actors gained access to an internal Twitter admin panel that\nallowed them to manipulate 2FA and recovery settings of user accounts. Security\nresearchers and media outlets have various theories on how the attacker got access: some\nclaim it was an [inside job of a bribed employee, others report the actors infiltrated an internal](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos)\nSlack channel, where they found credentials of the admin panel.\n\nthe Twitter hacker reportedly got access to Twitter’s admin panel by finding login\ncredentials pinned inside a Twitter Slack channel. If that’s true then holy shit.\n[https://t.co/Oek9SEjzHo](https://t.co/Oek9SEjzHo) [pic.twitter.com/Z1496dok6G](https://t.co/Z1496dok6G)\n\n[— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) July 17, 2020](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1284261639274090496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThese reports present an opportunity to discuss a critical aspect of Slack: the attack\n**surface organizations expose when using the omnipresent instant messaging**\n**platform, and how threat actors exploit it.**\n\n\n-----\n\nMuch like Boardvantage and other cloud-based apps, the risk involved in using Slack can\n**be hard to quantify; since the platform serves different needs of different stakeholders, it’s**\n**hard to incorporate potential compromises into a threat model. Everyone agrees that**\nsensitive credentials shouldn’t be pinned on a Slack channel – until someone forgets and\ndoes it anyway. In this context, it makes perfect sense for hacktivists and nation-state actors\nto be interested in proprietary data available on the platform. But cybercriminals – a major\ndriving force in the commoditization of cyber threats – might struggle to monetize this asset.\n\n[Many access types – webshells on online stores, RDP servers or corporate email inbox](https://ke-la.com/access-as-a-service-remote-access-markets-in-the-cybercrime-underground/)\naccess – are a highly sought-after resource driving thriving markets; how does Slack fare\nagainst them in terms of supply and demand in the cybercrime ecosystem?\n\n### The Supply: Abundance of Sensitive Logins Available for Sale\n\nThe supply side of the equation is clear: any actor interested in Slack logins can easily\n**find them in automated markets like** [Genesis Store that sell credentials stolen via](https://ke-la.com/exploring-the-genesis-supply-chain-for-fun-and-profit/)\ninfostealers or banking trojans. Querying KELA’s vast databases of credentials offered on\nthese markets, KELA found more than 17,000 Slack credentials offered for sale –\nstarting at $0.50 and going all the way up to $300 per bot.\n\n_Credentials for an Enterprise Slack workspace sold on the Genesis Store_\n\nBefore diving in to the data, let’s quickly explore Slack’s concept of a workspace. After\nregistering, Slack owners at the client-side set up a new environment associated with the\norganization, defining the context in which users can send direct messages to each other\n[and which channels are visible to them. A workspace is a communal environment where](https://slack.com/intl/en-il/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel)\nusers chat and share information. Workspaces are generated using a unique URL based on\nthe following format:\n\n## orgname.slack.com\n\nMaking it easy for users to find, join and manage workspaces.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe structured workspace URL proved invaluable when investigating the platform s exposure\non automated cybercriminal markets; after de-duplicating and normalizing the data, we found\n**compromised credentials that offer cybercriminals or other bad actors access to** **over**\n**12,000 unique workspaces.**\n\n_Credentials for the public login panel of this banking service were offered for sale on a cybercriminal_\n_market_\n\nAs anyone can create a Slack workspace for free, the question is, how many of these\n**belong to actual organizations that might be exposed to risk if their compromised**\ncredentials were to end up in the wrong hand, and how many are public, community-based\nworkspaces?\n\nTo answer that question, KELA scraped the login interfaces of all 12,000 workspaces\n**and analyzed potential indicators of who might use them. We decided to focus on**\nformatted email accounts – a feature that Slack admins can enable, allowing users with\nemails of a specific domain to register and access the workspace. Already utilized in bug\nbounties, the premise is that workspaces that allow registration from specific domains\n\n\n-----\n\n**are more likely to be associated with organizations. We know this heuristic isn t free of**\nfalse positives (or false negatives), but it serves as a better indication of the number of actual\ninternal business workspaces.\n\n_One of the thousands of Slack workspace with compromised credentials offered on cybercrime markets._\n_This UI, supposedly of a government entity, allows registrations with formatted email._\n\nFiltering only by workspaces supporting formatted email registration resulted in over 4,300\n**unique workspaces. As can be seen above, some are government and financial**\ninstitutions, including banks, insurance companies and more – all have exposed credentials\navailable for purchase in cybercrime markets.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A quick quantitative analysis of Slack workspaces that suffer credentials compromises observed in_\n_cybercrime markets_\n\n### The Demand: Sensitive Corporate Communications or Social Media?\n\nWhile at least 4,300 organizations seem to have Slack credentials available for sale, the\n**demand side of the equation doesn’t seem to align; browsing cybercriminal forums won’t**\nuncover many threat actors searching for Slack access. One example was a Russianspeaking actor on a top-tier forum, who’s looking to buy Slack accounts:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlmost a year after it was posted, the ad still has no replies. Moreover, we found almost no\n**discussions about schemes or methods to monetize Slack credentials, suggesting**\nthere is no active interest in targeting Slack among cybercrime communities.\n\nThat same post, though, holds a clue as to why threat actors ignore Slack right now. A\ncareful look at the screenshot reveals the threat actor posted the request in a subforum\n**dedicated to social networks, suggesting the cybercrime community considers Slack as a**\nmessaging app, rather than a gateway into corporate platforms and internal data. This is a\n**[classic Unknown Unknowns situation where actors might have unprecedented access to](https://ke-la.com/one-attackers-trash-is-another-attackers-treasure/)**\nsensitive credentials but as a collective, they lack a well-established TTP on how to leverage\nthem for monetary gain.\n\n### The Next Frontier\n\nWe won’t be generalizing if we say attackers are opportunistic and agile, adapting to new\nchallenges by exploiting the tools at hand. We’ve already seen adversaries – the operators\non the SLUB malware – using Slack to enable covert C&C communications. Lately, Red\nteams and bounty hunters are noticing Slack’s advantages for attackers as vector as well –\n[as seen in write-ups mentioned earlier and in the introduction to Abusing Slack for Offensive](https://posts.specterops.io/abusing-slack-for-offensive-operations-2343237b9282)\n_Operations by SpecterOps._\n\nSo why do malicious actors seem to be slacking (you had to be expecting that pun by now)\noff when it comes to leveraging Slack as a component in initial access? KELA has a few\ntheories:\n\n1. Enumeration: while enumerating a target’s Slack workspace sounds easy enough, it\n\nmight prove a bit challenging; users can choose the org name listed in the unique URL,\nand well-utilized obscurity may make it harder for an adversary to identify an\nopportunity\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Security and identity control: Slack natively supports many SSO providers, making it\n\ndifficult for an attacker to pivot from/to Slack using compromised credentials. Out of the\n12,000 workspaces identified by KELA, several were SSO-only\n3. Cost-effectiveness: assume you’re an attacker with Slack access; what can you do\n\nwith it (except for browsing a plethora of memes shared by team members)? You could\nuse it for phishing, which will probably be effective but isn’t as widespread as a goodold spam campaign. You can also obtain sensitive files sent via the chats, but there’s\nno guaranteed success (though the Twitter hackers definitely nailed it), so gaining\naccess might not be worth the effort\n\nWhile we found little concrete evidence, we assume APTs focused on espionage or nationstate actors already exploit Slack, since they care less about the three factors mentioned\nabove.\n\nWe also assume that the evolution of cybercrime – focusing on servitization and sales\nautomation, as well as increased visibility of goods – will **allow cybercriminals to**\n**overcome these challenges. Right now, a financially-motivated actor can visit an**\nunderground botnet market like Genesis and get an overview of all available corporate Slack\nlogins with two clicks, solving the enumeration problem; once credentials are obtained,\nSlack’s security (including SSO) can be bypassed using fingerprints sold on the same market\n– resolving the second issue. These make Slack intrusions cheaper and easier, and –\ncombined with the rise of targeted ransomware, offering new monetization opportunities –\n**may** **increase their overall ROI, and therefor popularity.**\n\n**Fortunately, threat intelligence solutions – including KELA’s RaDark and Darkbeast –**\n**supply network defenders and threat intelligence practitioners with real-time insights**\n**into underground cybercrime activities and the cloud-based attack ecosystem. These can**\nbe effectively used to reduce attack surface from Slack and other third-party services, by\nremediating exposures or taking down compromised data. Specifically, we recommend\nmonitoring not just “classic” network assets – like domains and IP ranges – but also unique\nURLs and identifiers used on external services, i.e., the organization’s unique Slack URLs.\n\n\n-----",
