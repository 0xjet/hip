The increasing awareness to this type of attack results in a negative impact on\nthe success ratio of massive phishing campaigns; however, cybercriminals (as always) are\nadapting. This short blog post provides an example of advance tactics that adversaries use\nin such campaigns to overcome these challenges.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Leveraging Existing Trust\n\nThe rule “never accept gifts from strangers” applies to many settings, including suspicious\nemail attachments. But what if you recognize the sender? Moreover, the attachment is a part\nof an existing email thread?\n\nA recent campaign the attacker leveraged a previously compromised email account\nbelonging to an employee of a prominent Chamber of Commerce. The adversary sent\ngeneric responses to existing threads, attaching a malicious Microsoft Office document.\nAbusing compromised trusted senders is a powerful persuasion tactic, which greatly\nincreases the chances of opening the malicious attachment even by a trained recipient.\n\nBelow is one of the messages sent during this attack. –Most of its contents are authentic, but\nthe last reply was appended by the attacker:\n\nThe attachment is a malicious document prompting the victim to allow macro execution:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious macro is comprised of two modules: the first decodes an embedded command\nand the second executing it using the Shell function:\n\nThe command itself has another layer of obfuscation, which was added by the publicly\n[available tool Invoke-DOSfuscation:](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation)\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoding this results in a simple, typical PowerShell script, which downloads an executable\nWindows binary from a remote website:\n\nThe payload in this case was a Gozi ISFB/Ursnif malware, capable of stealing sensitive data\nfrom a victim. Moreover, once the attackers established compromised the victim’s machine\nthey might use it to launch future similar campaigns.\n\n### Prevented by Minerva\n\nIn this case attackers were trying to evade “human detection” by leveraging clever social\nengineering techniques and “machine detection” (i.e. evading security products) by\nobfuscating the downloader and payload.\n\nMinerva’s Malicious Documents Protection capabilities prevents this evasive threat and\nprovide useful data to SOC and IR teams, capturing the full context of the attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nTo better understand this type of attack watch our webinar: Why Do Malicious Office\nDocuments Keep Infecting Me?\n\nInterested in learning more about Minerva's Endpoint Protection?\n\n## IOC\n\n### Document (SHA256):\n\n460073875b11a5c8f1f0fe4ecf4967d0c90d066867b5ca57fd2a25df6bc384c0 URL:\n\n### Executable Payload (SHA256):\n\nae6ca8aab5bbd5ff08915011c6c773808a37440d805bdff247ebac9a5d060631\n\n### URLs:\n\nhxxp://tapertoni[.]com/Flux/tst/index[.]php?l=ab1[.]tkn (analyzed sample)\n\nhxxp://tapertoni[.]com/Flux/tst/index[.]php?l=ab2[.]tkn\n\nhxxp://tapertoni[.]com/Flux/tst/index[.]php?l=abc1[.]tkn\n\nhxxp://nesocina[.]com/Flux/tst/index[.]php?l=abc1[.]tkn\n\nhxxp://nesocina[.]com/Flux/tst/index[[.]php?l=abc2[.]tkn\n\nhxxp://nesocina[.]com/Flux/tst/index[.]php?l=abc3[.]tkn\n\n[« Previous Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/why-is-malware-able-to-evade-detection?hsLang=en-us)\n[Next Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/attackers-insert-themselves-into-the-email-conversation-to-spread-malware-0?hsLang=en-us) »\n\n### Interested in Minerva?
