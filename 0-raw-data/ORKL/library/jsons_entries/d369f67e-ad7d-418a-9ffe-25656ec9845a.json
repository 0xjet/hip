We’re in the second\ncamp: DPRK activity should be clustered among a few related groups.\n\nThe DPRK doesn’t make this clustering easy. It’s often hard to know where the state-directed\nactivity stops and the operator side-hustles start. We know the North Korean crews target\ncryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, but the split of the bounty/booty between the\noperators’ personal crypto-stashes and government coffers is a bit of a mystery.\n\nFurther, all the North Korean groups we list in this article use wipers or ransomware, and all\n[use similar packers to mask malicious files. But overlapping geography and TTPs doesn’t](https://blog.lexfo.fr/ressources/Lexfo-WhitePaper-The_Lazarus_Constellation.pdf)\nmean a single “Lazarus Group” is orchestrating all these attacks. The overlaps are better\n[explained by several operators sharing malware developed by a single team.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38)\n\n[Now, we could sit back and go all angry panda whenever we see an analyst get it wrong, or](https://giphy.com/gifs/angry-panda-ToMjGpIYtgvMP38WTFC)\nwe could have our own crack at defining who’s who in the zoo. Bucketing the activity\nprovides a clearer picture of North Korea’s targeting habits and the risks that they pose so\nwe can better predict and defend against them.\n\nBut first, a few caveats: linking the names different analysts give to each cluster of activity\ndoesn’t make those groups synonymous. It’s a loose equivalency, at best. And our attempts\nto assign these groups some personality, well, that just makes our lives more bearable.\n\n## “The Lazarus Group”\n\n**aka Temp.Hermit, Labyrinth Chollima, RGB-D3, ZINC, Covellite, NICKEL ACADEMY**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Let s start with the group that always gets the headlines.

For example, some\nresearchers group all activity directed at banks under BlueNoroff (see below), others fold it\nunder Lazarus.\n\nWhat historically made Lazarus distinct – less so as time passes, were techniques (such as\n[protocol impersonation) used in its malware.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003/)\n\n_[Image Source: CISA](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/alert-graphic-01.png)_ .\n\n[Lazarus has strong associations with the Fallchill remote access tool for Windows and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318A)\n[similar capabilities that target MacOS, Android, and Linux.
