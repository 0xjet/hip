[2] Beginning in 2020, the](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn2)\nfollowing organizations have experienced at least attempted intrusions, if not outright\ndisruption, traced to this ransomware variant:\n\n[Fresenius Group [3]](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn3)\n[Honda [4]](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn4)\nEnel Group [[5]](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn5)\n\nThis group of identified activity likely represents a subset of behavior, as other events are\n[either disputed or nonpublic at this time. [6] Irrespective of specific victimology, EKANS](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn6)\nincorporates certain specific functionality – previously deployed via stand-alone scripts or\n[supporting tools [7] – directly into a ransomware executable.](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn7)\n\nAs EKANS continues to develop and present itself in high-profile events, several\nmisconceptions and misunderstandings have developed about the malware, its authors,\nand what it means for Industrial Control System (ICS) networks.\n\n**1. Why EKANS, and how does EKANS relate to Snake, or Turla activity?**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen first reported in early January, the malware since referred to as EKANS by Dragos\nwas labeled both EKANS and SNAKE by its original discoverers. On further analysis,\nDragos referred to this malware as “EKANS” for several reasons:\n\n1. The string “EKANS” is actually present in both the malware and in the malware’s\n\noperations on victim machines (by creating and checking a mutex value to prevent\nreinfection of the same victim).\n2. While “EKANS” is “SNAKE” spelled backwards, the word “SNAKE” did not appear in\n\nany observable aspect of the malware.\n3. “SNAKE” has a long-standing relationship with an existing threat actor, referred to\n\nvariously as Turla, SNAKE, or VENOMOUS BEAR. [[8] More significantly, this entity is](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn8)\nassociated with Russian state espionage activity and not ransomware deployment.\n\nWhile no consistent mechanism or convention exists for naming malware, Dragos adheres\nto the practice of naming malware based on observables or details within obtained samples.\nThe existence of a long-running, state-sponsored threat referred to as “SNAKE” is reason\nfor caution in referring to a new ransomware variant by the same name, if only to avoid\nconfusion. Various outlets and individuals have already mistakenly made the connection\nbetween EKANS ransomware and the Turla actor based on the “SNAKE” reference –\nconfusion best avoided given the possible repercussions of creating an unfounded link\nbetween these entities.\n\nGiven the potential consequences of linking a state-sponsored or -directed entity to multiple\ndisruptive ransomware events, Dragos finds the use of the “SNAKE” label not just\ninaccurate (as it is not present in the malware), but dangerous as well. Ultimately, EKANS\nransomware has no known, provable connection to the threat actor variously referred to as\nSNAKE, Turla, VENOMOUS BEAR, or other names. While the original discoverers – Vitali\nKremez and MalwareHunterTeam – reserve the right to name this activity, given the use of\nboth “SNAKE” and “EKANS” in public postings and the baggage associated with the former,\nDragos emphasizes the desirability of using the latter to avoid confusion with statesponsored cyberespionage activity.\n\n**2. How does EKANS impact ICS assets?**\n\nSince discovery, several reports have emerged about EKANS’ notional abilities relative to\n[industrial assets. [9] While EKANS features several functional characteristics keyed to](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn9)\nindustrial environments – specifically process kill functionality related to ICS data historians,\nlicensing servers, and similar items – such functionality is relatively simple, largely\nuntargeted (given lack of variation in the list of process names targeted between victims),\nand rather blunt in design.\n\nEKANS essentially internalizes an extensive process kill list associated with MegaCortex\nransomware activity in mid- to late-2019, and potentially associated with LockerGoga\nevents even earlier. Given obfuscation mechanisms deployed, use in EKANS likely\n\n\n-----\n\nachieves a higher degree of defense evasion and functionality masking than these earlier\nexamples. The only functionality associated with these items is forcibly killing a named\nprocess. This is much different than the subtle process manipulation and integrity\ndestruction seen (or attempted by) events such as Stuxnet, CRASHOVERRIDE, or\nTRISIS. [[10]](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn10)\n\nDragos assesses with high-confidence that the process kill functionality built into EKANS is\ndesigned primarily to remove file locks from sensitive items – such as license keys or data\nstores –to extend the impact of a ransomware event by encrypting these vital files. While\ndeeply concerning, this is significantly different from modifications to an industrial process to\nproduce a potential physical disruption. Based on identified functionality, the most\nconcerning aspect of EKANS is that its blunt, indiscriminate process termination\nfunctionality leads to unintended side effects in production environments.\n\n**3. Is EKANS a state-sponsored or -directed activity against critical**\n**infrastructure?**\n\nIn addition to the disambiguation with Turla provided above, other reports have surfaced\n[allegedly linking EKANS activity to state-sponsored activity.[11] While the potential](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn11)\nvictimology in such reports may be accurate, ties to state-sponsored activity rely on\n[indefensible logical leaps that simply are not proven after further analysis. [12]](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_edn12)\n\nAlthough Dragos cannot completely or definitively disprove that EKANS is part of a statesponsored or -directed effort, the preponderance of evidence would indicate otherwise.\nAmong other items, connection to past ransomware activity, such as MegaCortex,\ncombined with subsequent victims in unrelated industries and regions suggests that EKANS\nas a potential disruptive tool tied to Iranian (or other) strategic interests, is at best, a very\nweak argument.\n\nAll available evidence at present indicates EKANS is a likely criminal activity designed for\nmonetization, and not a state-sponsored, disruptive campaign masquerading as\nransomware.\n\n**4. Given the above, is Dragos suggesting that EKANS is therefore not that**\n**significant?**\n\nThe above statement does not reflect Dragos’ position in the slightest. In evaluating items\nlike EKANS, we must ensure balance between over-hyping threats out of proportion and\nminimizing activity so that it is not taken seriously. While EKANS is no Stuxnet or similar\nthreat, EKANS does not resemble some sort of “play malware” that just so happens to\nfeature ICS-specific references.\n\nEKANS represents one aspect of a continued evolution by multiple ransomware entities\ntoward targeting industrial and critical infrastructure entities. Although relatively\nstraightforward in behavior and functionality EKANS remains a notable and significant\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat to ICS operations. Even if its functionality is relatively basic in being limited to\nprocess termination, such activity performed at the wrong time or against the wrong system\ncould lead to potentially disastrous process interruption. Although not designed to physically\ndisrupt or destroy, malware such as EKANS brings the possibility of ICS-specific impacts\nfrom traditionally state-directed activity to likely criminally-motivated actions.\n\nGiven the above, asset owners and operators should treat EKANS as a serious threat, and\nas a likely sign of continued evolution in ransomware operations. Malicious entities continue\nto refine their operations to target entities ranging from manufacturers through critical\ninfrastructure providers, such as power and water utility companies. Such shifts are likely\ndue to assumptions on the need to pay a ransom to ensure continuous operation by vital\nentities. Irrespective of motivation, ICS asset owners and operators are at increasing risk of\never more refined malware operations targeting their organizations. Discounting the threat\nposed by items such as EKANS due to a perceived lack of sophistication is not merely\nmisguided but may potentially lead to operational disaster.\n\nICS asset owners and operators find themselves in an increasingly contested environment,\nwith both state sponsored and criminally motivated entities interested in this operational\nspace. To combat such efforts, organizations must invest in increasing visibility – across\nnetwork, host, and process areas – and the ability to respond and remediate potential\ndisruptions. Only by identifying potential threats at the earliest possible instance and having\nthe capacity to recover and restore operations to a recent known-good state can industrial\noperators forge resilience in the face of an ever-more hostile threat landscape.\n\n[[1] Vitali Kremez (https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1214333066245812224?s=20); SNAKE](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_ednref1)\nRanswomare is the Next Threat Targeting Business Networks – BleepingComputer\n(https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snake-ransomware-is-the-next-threattargeting-business-networks/)\n\n[[2] EKANS Ransomware and ICS Operations – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_ednref2)\n[(https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/);](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/)\nDragos WorldView customers should consult TR-2020-02 EKANS Ransomware and ICS\nOperations\n\n[[3] European Health Care Giant Fresenius Group Grappling with Computer Virus –](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/#_ednref3)\n[CyberScoop (https://www.cyberscoop.com/fresenius-health-care-cyberattack-coronavirus/);](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fresenius-health-care-cyberattack-coronavirus/)\nDragos WorldView customers should consult AA-2020-16 Ransomware Activity Impacting\nEuropean Medical and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing\n\n[[4] Is There a “Snake” Under Honda’s Hood?
