So far they have published what they say is evidence of crimes by police,\ninformation showing that the regime covered up the country’s true covid-19 mortality rate,\nand recordings of illegal orders to violently crack down on peaceful protests. The partisans\nalso say that they have successfully hacked almost every part of the Lukashenko\nadministration and that the information released so far is just a fraction of the data they have.\n\n“What we want is to stop the violence and repression from the terroristic regime in Belarus\nand to bring the country back to democratic principles and rule of law,” an anonymous\nspokesperson for the hackers told MIT Technology Review.\n\n## Related Story\n\n\n-----\n\n[Inside the FBI, Russia, and Ukraine’s failed cybercrime investigation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/08/1027999/fbi-russia-ukraine-cybercrime-investigation-ransomware/)\n\nRussia and Ukraine promised to cooperate and help catch the world’s most successful\nhackers. But things didn’t quite go to plan.\n\nBut the Partisans are not operating alone. According to interviews, the hackers benefit from a\npartnership with a key group of Belarusian law enforcement and intelligence officers.\n\nA group called BYPOL, which includes current and former regime officials, has been offering\nclose guidance for many months. Some of them are providing help from outside the country,\nhaving defected after Lukashenko’s fraudulent claims of victory in the 2020 presidential\nelection and the brutal crackdown that followed. But others, the group says, are working\nagainst Lukashenko from within in the conviction that his regime—which arrested more than\n27,000 people in the wake of protests last year—must fall.\n\n“They’re making the regime’s crimes transparent,” says Andrei Sannikov, a former Belarusian\ndiplomat who is not part of either the Cyber Partisans or BYPOL. “The information they’re\ngetting by hacking the state really is very eloquent in witnessing the criminal activities of the\nregime against the citizens.”\n\n### “I saw falsifications with my own eyes”\n\nWhile Belarus has been under Lukashenko’s control for almost 30 years, protests and\nopposition have ramped up significantly since the elections held in August 2020. His\ndisputed victory led to a swell of anti-regime protests as Lukashenko violently crushed\npeaceful dissent.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe crackdowns were a breaking point for many. Aliaksandr Azarau was a lieutenant colonel\nin Belarus’s police force, and before that, he worked to combat organized crime and\ncorruption for the Ministry of Interior. He says what he saw turned him against the regime.\n\n“I was present at the election,” Azarau says. “I saw falsifications with my own eyes. I decided\nto resign after I received unlawful orders from superior officers. A lot of people were detained\nin the first days after the election. My colleagues were illegally sending false documents\nabout crimes these people committed. I decided Lukashenko kept his power illegally.”\n\nHe was one of a significant number of law enforcement officials who left Belarus as a result.\nAbout a dozen of them reconvened in Warsaw, in neighboring Poland, and launched BYPOL\nin October. (The group’s name means Belarus Police.) They say they have hundreds of\nmembers and contacts still inside government security agencies including the secret police\n(known as the KGB), the Ministry of Interior, and border control.\n\n\"They wanted to know how to penetrate inside these organizations to steal information.\nBecause we work there, we know everything inside.\"\n\nThe Cyber Partisans say they are made up of around 15 IT experts from Belarus’s\ntechnology sector: the country has a thriving scene, including numerous gaming and social\n[startups, although many experts have left in opposition to the regime.](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210627-belarus-it-sector-hit-by-exodus-after-post-vote-crackdown)\n\nThey began defacing government websites in September 2020, a simple but highly visible\nact of protest that got them attention as the country convulsed in turmoil.\n\nIn December of that year, according to Azarau, the Partisans reached out to BYPOL with\nbigger goals in mind.\n\n“The Cyber Partisans wrote to us to help them find a way to understand all the law\nenforcement and intelligence agencies,” he says. “They wanted to know how to penetrate\ninside these organizations to steal information. Because we work there, we know everything\ninside. We consulted with them on how to do this.”\n\nAfter those early discussions, the Cyber Partisans say they ended up carrying out the actual\nhacks themselves. BYPOL’s current and former security force members have helped them\nunderstand the structure of government databases, process the data they access, and\nidentify individuals from hacked phone calls. Insiders are also able to “provide feedback from\nwithin the system on how the hack affected the security forces,” the hacking group’s\nspokesperson says.\n\nIn exchange, BYPOL has access to material from the Cyber Partisans to help them conduct\n[investigations into the regime, which are then published on BYPOL’s own Telegram channel.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/04/belarus-lukashenko-protests-election-russia-putin-brutal-crackdown-weapons-ammunition-bypol/)\n[Those investigations have been popular and successful, and one of their documentaries was](https://www.rferl.org/a/new-film-detailing-lukashenka-luxurious-life-belarus/31141222.html)\ncited during an American congressional hearing on Belarus which took place shortly before\nthe US imposed sanctions against Lukashenko and his allies.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hackers say their latest series of attacks has given them access to drone footage from\nprotest crackdowns, the Ministry of Interior Affairs’s mobile-phone surveillance database, and\ndatabases for passports, motor vehicles, and more. They also say they have accessed audio\nrecordings from emergency services and video feeds from road speed and surveillance\ncameras, as well as from isolation cells where detainees are held.\n\nThe Partisans say their intention is to undermine the regime at every level. “We have a\nstrategic plan that includes cyberattacks to paralyze as much as possible of the regime’s\nsecurity forces, to sabotage the regime’s weak points in the infrastructure, and to provide\nprotection for protesters,” said the spokesperson.\n\n“The hack is important because it shows the regime is not as unstoppable and unbeatable as\nit projects to be,” says Artyom Shraibman, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n“It shows the weakness of their system. It emboldens the protesters. Many people in the\nprotest have met these leaks with joy and a sense of victory.”\n\n[The hacks were previously reported by Current Time and](https://en.currenttime.tv/a/seeking-change-anti-lukashenka-hackers-seize-senior-belarusian-officials-personal-data-/31392092.html) [Bloomberg.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/belarus-hackers-seek-to-overthrow-local-government?sref=E9Urfma4)\n\n### “We don’t have any professional hackers”\n\nThe Cyber Partisans say they are not criminal hackers but technology-sector employees who\ncannot stand by any longer. The group’s spokesperson says that four individuals conduct\n“actual ethical hacking” while the others provide support, analysis, and data processing.\n\n“We don’t have any professional hackers,” they told MIT Technology Review. “All of us are IT\nspecialists and some cybersecurity specialists that learned on the go.”\n\nPavel Slunkin, who was a Belarusian diplomat until last year and is now working with the\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations, says that the Partisans reflect the technology\nindustry’s importance to the country.\n\n\"The Belarusian people who work in tech not only want economic impact, but they want\nto transform it into political influence.\"\n\n“The Belarusian people who work in tech not only want economic impact but they want to\ntransform it into political influence,” he says. “These kinds of people have houses, cars, and\neverything—except they can’t choose their own future. But now they’ve decided that they\ncan participate in political life. They have played a very important role, if not the most\nimportant role, in what happened in Belarus in 2020.”\n\nIn the run-up to last year’s election campaign, opposition candidate Viktor Babariko recruited\na number of tech experts. He was arrested and sentenced to 14 years in prison for\n[corruption in a trial critics called a \"sham.\"](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarus-jails-former-presidential-contender-babariko-14-years-2021-07-06/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen Babariko was put in prison, the protest movement felt destroyed, Slunkin says. This\nwas the starting point for people trying to oppose the regime, not on the streets, but instead\nwhere they feel stronger and more secure than the government.”\n\n[The Belarusian government blamed the hacks on “foreign special services.\"](https://news.zerkalo.io/economics/992.html?tg)\n\n### “As comprehensive a hack as one can imagine”\n\nLukashenko’s iron grip on media and information inside Belarus has forced political\nopponents to move to apps like Telegram, which are harder to block or regulate. The\nhackers’ Telegram channel has more than 77,000 subscribers.\n\nTheir most recent postings include a recording of a conversation between two senior\nBelarusian police officials on August 8, 2020, the day before the presidential election. In the\nrecording, the deputy chief of the Minsk police and his subordinate discuss “preventative”\narrests of protesters and major political opponents. Their targets include staff working for\nTsikhanouskaya.\n\n## Related Story\n\n[The internet of protest is being built on single-page websites](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/27/1007714/carrd-internet-of-protest-is-being-built-on-one-shot-websites/)\n\nSimple, shareable, and private, these pages are Gen Z’s choice for not just learning about\nsomething, but doing something about it.\n\nIf the Cyber Partisans deliver on their promises and threats, this may turn out to be the most\nthorough hack a country has ever experienced.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf we speak about possible future prosecution of the people who committed crimes on behalf\nof the regime, like persecuting the opposition, these hacked databases could potentially be\nused for tribunals and investigations,” says Shraibman.\n\n[An international coalition of human rights organizations is currently investigating and](https://www.dignity.dk/en/nyheder/dignity-will-lead-new-international-initiative-to-document-torture-in-belarus/)\ndocumenting torture and other human rights violations to hold the Lukashenko regime\naccountable for crimes committed since the 2020 election protests began.\n\nAs the enormous scope of the Cyber Partisan operation became clear to the Western world,\n[an expert called it “as comprehensive of a hack of a state as one can imagine.” But the](https://twitter.com/DAlperovitch/status/1424801185459056646)\nimpact of the hack, as with so much in Belarus, remains unclear.\n\n“I honestly don’t know what comes next,” Shraibman says. “Politically in Belarus, it’s so\nvolatile. Lukashenko has of course managed to suppress the street protests, that is true. But\nhe continues to be in a vulnerable position internationally and economically. He keeps\nprovoking all the other international actors. He can’t help but escalate. He keeps escalating.\nThat can lead us to a very dark, dangerous place.”\n\n\n-----",
