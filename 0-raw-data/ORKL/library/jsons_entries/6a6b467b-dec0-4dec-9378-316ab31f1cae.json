Following our preliminary analysis, we\nassessed with high confidence that the sample was used to target\na previously unreported German chemical company. As part of our responsible disclosure,\nwe alerted the affected entity, the local Law Enforcements, and our clients.\nIn the following weeks after our internal reporting, the German news media source\n[Tagesschau reported our initial detection and analysis of the sample, and confirmed the](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr/hackerangriff-chemieunternehmen-101.html)\nchemical company’s awareness of the attack in the second half of 2019.\nThe Winnti sample we analysed was highly likely developed in 2015, and likely used\naround this year for the first time, it is unclear how long the compromise existed in the\ncompromised environment.\nAlthough the malware was likely used years ago, further analysis revealed a previously\nunreported C2 technique never attributed to any Winnti Group’s toolkits.\nThe technique relies on a DNS Tunneling communication channel through a custom\n[implementation of the iodine source code, an open-source software that enables the](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine)\ntunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server.\nAdditionally, we uncovered a previously unknown stolen digital certificate being used to\ndigitally sign Winnti-related attack components, and the targeting of a previously-unreported\nSouth Korean video game company.\nThe sophistication of the techniques we uncovered confirms that the Winnti Group is a\nhighly sophisticated, and highly committed Advanced Persistent Group targeting a plethora\nof different industry sectors in Europe and South Asia.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Winnti Group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly) is an alleged Chinese statesponsored umbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared\ngoals and attack resources. The suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government pinpoints\nthat it likely has an incentive to continue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s\nhighlighted as priority for China’s economic development.\n\nOn Friday, 13 January, QuoIntelligence (QuoINT) detected a new Winnti sample uploaded to a\npublic virus scanner from a German location. Following our preliminary analysis, we assessed\nwith high confidence that the sample was used to target a previously unreported German\n\n\n-----\n\nchemical company. Additionally, during our analysis we uncovered a previously unknown stolen\ndigital certificate being used to digitally sign Winnti related drivers, and a potential campaign\nagainst an already known South Korean video game company.\n\nIn the last year, researchers and journalists have publicly disclosed that the Winnti group targeted\nand eventually compromised Henkel (2014), BASF (2015), Bayer (2018) and Roche (2019). This\nmost recent previously unreported German chemical company is yet another German chemical\ncompany targeted by Winnti since 2015. Prior to our analysis this attack activity was not publicly\nreported.\n\n_Figure 1: Timeline of attacks located in Germany and attributed to Winnti_\n\nIn December 2019, Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) released\n[a report related to the alleged Chinese state sponsored umbrella organization known as the](https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/broschuere-2019-12-bfv-cyber-brief-2019-01.pdf)\nWinnti Group. Through our internal malware analysis, we are confident that the sample we\ndiscovered is highly similar to the Winnti sample described in the BfV report. The sample also\nmatches known characteristics of Winnti’s arsenal shared through intelligence reports produced\n[by ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Winnti.pdf)\n\nFurther, we have informed the affected company, law enforcement agencies, and sent a Warning\nto our customers upon detection.\n\n## The Winnti Group\n\nThe Winnti Group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly) is an alleged Chinese statesponsored umbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared\ngoals and attack resources. Notably, various operations attributed to other China-linked threat\nactor groups, such as APT17 and Ke3chang, have also leveraged its backdoor malware. Active\nsince at least 2010, initial attacks attributed to the group heavily targeted the gaming industry.\nHowever, as researchers have continued to follow and dissect the group and its activity, the\ngroup’s target focus has expanded to other industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical,\ntechnology, and software. Further, the group’s evolution involves the enhancement, development,\nand inclusion of new tools and tactics.\n\nThe suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government, pinpoints that it likely has an incentive\nto continue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s highlighted as priority for China’s\n[economic development. In the latest Winnti Group public report, FireEye researchers reported of](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html)\n\n\n-----\n\na new widespread campaign attributed to APT41 which involves exploitation attempts of recently\ndisclosed and patched vulnerabilities for products of Cisco, Citrix, and Zoho. The campaign\nwaves apparently take a more targeted approach to selecting potential victims across various\nsectors including financials, government, and information technology. According to the\nresearchers, identified victim systems demonstrated the threat actor leveraged commercially\navailable post exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter, which are essentially full\nfeatured backdoors.\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n## Sample Targeting German Chemical Company\n\nThe main artifact uploaded to VirusTotal is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file, with a compilation\ntimestamp suggesting the sample was built in August 2015. Although the compilation time might\nbe legitimate, it is not possible to determine when and how long the attackers used this malware.\n\n\n#### HASHES Compilation\n\n Timestamp\n\n\n#### File‐ name\n\n TmPfw‐ RVS.dll\n\n\n#### MD5: c893a12ff72698f09f89f778e4c9cd2b SHA1: 06256946a69409cd18859bfa429184a282374d76 SHA256: df6af36626d375c5e8af‐ f45c64bfc1975d753b109e126a6cb30ee0523550329c\n\n_Table 1 – Winnti sample_\n\n### Binary Analysis\n\n\n#### 2015-08-06 01:52:51\n\n\nSimilar to other Winnti samples, the configuration section contains a string referring to the name\nof the campaign.

By running dsefix.exe, the malware can\n\n\n-----\n\nbypass driver verification and install its own drivers. We identified the following two drivers which\nwere embedded in the earlier described main artifact. To note that this technique does not work\non moden Windows (e.g. Windows 10) – yet another piece of evidence that this malware was\ndesigned and used multiple years ago.\n\n**Analysis of vboxdriver**\n\nThis is the vulnerable, correctly signed with a digital certificate, VirtualBox driver that is used for\nexploitation. It is used regularly by various threat actors, and by the previously highlighted\ndsefix.exe. The driver can also be used to perform the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) exploitation\n[technique, a similar technique as DSEFix.](https://github.com/hfiref0x/TDL)\n\n**Analysis of driver1.sys**\n\n[In late 2019, ExaTrack released their analysis of a signed Winnti rootkit previously observed in](https://exatrack.com/public/winnti_EN.pdf)\nthe wild, which we confirm is essentially the same rootkit driver. The sample is capable of\ninjecting raw packets into the network and receiving special formatted packets. In comparison,\nour variant has the same exact number of bytes, and there are large parts exactly matching.\n\n**Analysis of driver2.sys**\n\nThis rootkit driver seems to be largely the same as driver1.sys with the same characteristics\nincluding structure, I/O control, and device strings. However, this driver supports different versions\nof Windows. It checks for ranges of Windows New Technology (NT) build numbers and returns\nearly.\n\n### C2 DNS Tunneling\n\nBy analyzing the malware, it is possible to find two network indicators within its code:\n\n_Figure 3 – observed network IoCs in Winnti sample_\n\nThe hardcoded 208.67.222.222 is a legitimate OpenDNS DNS server (resolver1.opendns.com).\nThis IP is pushed into a list that is generated by the malware at runtime. Likely, the initiation\nroutine also populates the list with the system’s DNS, and the OpenDNS server is only used as\nfallback case to ensure the C2 domain gets resolved.\n\n[The dick[.]mooo[.]com FQDN name is offered by FreeDNS, which is a free dynamic DNS service.](https://freedns.afraid.org/)\nNotably, in the last years, multiple researchers have reported Winnti/PlugX C2 hostnames hosted\nin the mooo[.]com zone. In the code we observed that a dot (.) is enforced before the FQDN.\nAdditional analysis revealed that the malware generates subdomains with base128 encoding, and\nappend them to FQDN.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Code 1 – Hostname length restriction_\n\nFurther, dots are added into it every 57 characters potentially as a hostname length restriction,\nsuggesting the expectation of long hostnames. We confirm the buffer can support FQDN’s up to\n2000 characters.\n\nUpon further investigation we found out that the malware includes the open source iodine source\ncode – software that enables the tunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server. Interestingly, we\nare not aware of any earlier documentation highlighting Winnti specifically leveraging iodine for\nDNS tunneling. However, researchers at the Ruhr University Bochum, while hunting for DNS\n[tunnels, observed APT32 and Wekby APT groups using NULL and TXT records as a C2](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/assets/documents/A_Study_of_Newly_Observed_Hostnames_and_DNS_Tunneling_in_the_Wild.pdf)\ncommunication channel, as well as mentioning the mooo[.]com top level domain in their findings.\n\nThe implementation of iodine used in the Winnti sample is integrated and uses some custom\nwrapper, as evidence by the matching functions we discuss in further detail in the following\nsection.\n\n**Use of Iodine for C2 DNS Tunneling**\n\nThe iodine DNS tunneling solution is embedded in the DLL that is initially loaded and executed in\nmemory, and includes at least the following 15 matching functions:\n\n_Table 3 – Malware DLL Functions_\n\nFor instance, the 64bit executable contains the build_hostname function (Code 2), which\ncorresponds with the older 32bit version (compiled with debug symbols) of iodine 0.6.0 (Code 3):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Code 2- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostname_\n\n_Code 3- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostname_\n\nBased on the presence of the functions base128_blksize_enc and base128_blksize_raw, we\ndetermined the version used, while not exactly known, is from before May 2017 when a patch\nremoved those functions. Further, comparative analysis indicates that for the implementation of\niodine in this Winnti attack operation, there is no perfect match for the two versions having 64bit\npre-compiled binaries. This indicates iodine was compiled from source, and it is reasonable it is\nbeing used as a library, and not in its normal distribution format of a standalone executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DNS Tunneling technique adopted by the malware through the use of iodine is detailed in the\nfigure below.\n\n_Figure 4 – C2 channel over DNS_\n\n1. The malware generates a hostname and appends it to the embedded C2\n\ndick[.]mooo[.]com, and makes a NULL query to the resulted FQDN (e.g. abcde is appended\nto .dick[.]mooo[.]com). Notably, NULL and TXT DNS request types are iodine’s preferred\n[channels since they are “expected to provide the largest downstream bandwidth”. It is](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine)\nhence not a coincidence that researchers at Ruhr University Bochum also observed an\nextensive use of NULL request types for DNS Tunneling purposes in their research.\n2. The infected host sends the DNS query to one of the DNS servers included in the list\n\npopulated at runtime, eventually to the OpenDNS fallback server. At this point the DNS\nserver executes a recursive DNS query by contacting the Name Servers (NS) of each zone,\nuntil the Authoritative NS of dick[.]mooo[.]com is obtained. To note, FreeDNS does provide\nusers the capability to delegate the authority of their subdomains to external NS. In the\ndescribed scenario, attackers delegated the NS of their subdomain to use their NS as a defacto C2 server.\n3. The DNS server returns the authoritative answer by forwarding the content of the NULL\n\nrecord type to the infected host. Notably, the legit DNS server acts as a proxy between the\ninfected host and the malicious server, by making impossible for defenders the application\nof any filtering at the Network (L3) level.\n\n**The NULL DNS record type**\n\nThe implementation of NULL type tunneling can be observed in the following excerpt taken while\nreversing the malware:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third argument when calling dns_encode shall be of the type “struct query”\n[from Iodine’s dns.c](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/blob/27e5d6fadd997ff167c70a431d41adae26428d41/src/dns.c#L232)\n\n[According to common.h, “struct query” is defined as:](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/blob/27e5d6fadd997ff167c70a431d41adae26428d41/src/common.h#L86)\n\nSince QUERY_NAME_SIZE equals to 512 (4\n*128 – integers are 4 bytes) the query[128] call\nobtained from the reversing activity is indeed\nthe DNS query type.\n\nAs noted, reversing activity detailed the\nquery[128] value to be 0xa. From\n[Iodine’s windows.h T_NULL is](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/blob/27e5d6fadd997ff167c70a431d41adae26428d41/src/windows.h#L39)\nDNS_TYPE_NULL\n\nFinally, from Windows’s\ndocumentation, DNS_TYPE_NULL is actually a\nWindows constant equal to 0xa\n\n\n-----\n\n### Winnti Signed Code With Digital Certificate from IQ Technology\n\nDuring our analysis of the Winnti sample configured to target the German chemical company, our\ncomparative analysis of other Winnti related drivers revealed a digital certificate issued to IQ\n_Technology, a Taiwanese company producing Natural language processing (NLP) and Artificial_\nIntelligence (AI) software. The rootkit driver aligns with the already known driver1.sys. While it is a\nknown TTP that Winnti attributed attacks have involved stolen digital certificates for code signing\nits malware components, the use of this certificate is not publicly discussed, except for a brief\nreport from a security researcher apparently associated with a Vietnamese security company.\n[Although the report is no longer online, the discussed sample contains a compilation timestamp](https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/a5d6139921576c3aedfc64e2b37ae1a64f3160bd1bb70d4fc7fce956029e7d55?environmentId=2&lang=en)\nof August 2015, which is the earliest one observed in the wild that we identified using this digital\ncertificate. At the time of analysis, the digital certificate was already revoked.\n\nThe sample’s structure, debug symbols, and explanatory debug messages included within\nsuggests it is highly likely be a development version. Additionally, the compilation timestamp\nindicates the sample was created 20 minutes prior to the driver1.sys. Both samples are highly\nrelated, and its contents combined with the date of analysis and reporting essentially solidify that\nit existed in 2015; however, this does not necessarily corroborate to an attack timeframe.\n\n## Sample Targeting South Korean Gaming Company\n\n#### HASHES Compilation Timestamp\n\n\n#### MD5: 00961922e22e6a5d30b1d6fbd667d3c4\n\n SHA1: 0fd54c26b593bd9e9218492d50d8873521c0ec0d\n\n SHA256: 4209b457f3b42dd2e1e119f2c9dd5b5f‐ b1d063a77b49c7acbae89bbe4e284fb9\n\n\n#### 2016-03-07 09:44:01\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 3 – observed network IoCs in Winnti sample_\n\nOn 21 February, we detected the new submission of a 64-bit Winnti executable to a public online\nmalware scanning service. As multiple researchers have reported, Winnti operators embed the\nname of their target directly into the malware, but in an obfuscated manner.\n\n**Binary Analysis**\n\nThe sample resembles the Winnti Dropper Install.exe described by ESET, since it is a command\nline executable used to drop and load additional encrypted payload:\n\nUnfortunately we were not able to find the payload meant to be decrypted by this dropper.\n\nHowever, we were able to extract the malware’s configuration file and identify the intended target.\nIn this case, the following string was included within the extracted configuration:\n\nBased on previous knowledge and targeting of the Winnti Group, we assess that this sample was\nlikely used to target Gravity Co., Ltd., a South Korean video game company. The company is\n[known for its Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Ragnarok Online, which](http://www.gravity.co.kr/en/games/)\nis also offered as a mobile application. As we have also reported in the past, the video game\nindustry is one of the preferred targets of the Winnti Group, especially for those companies\noperating in South Korea and Taiwan. Interestingly, ESET researchers, while reporting on multiple\nWinnti Group campaigns targeting the video game industry, listed in their report a C2 server\nhaving a Campaign ID GRA KR 0629.\n\n_Excerpt from ESET Research White paper “CONNECTING THE DOTS Exposing the arsenal and_\n_methods of the Winnti Group”_\n\nAt this time, we do not have any further evidence supporting a potential link between the sample\nwe analysed and the C2 detailed by ESET, but the coincidence between the C2 Campaign\nID/Location with the Campaign ID we extracted from the Winnti dropper is worth noting.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Winnti Group has exhibited their ability to breach different organizations and conduct\nsophisticated attack operations, typically motivated by espionage and financial gain, with various\nTTPs and malware toolkits. While attribution is not concrete due to the complexity of the group,\nthere are links that can be drawn between operations which suggest the threat actors purporting\nthe attacks are likely operating within the Winnti Group, or at least sharing resources.\n\nThe detection of this unreported Winnti variant uploaded to VirusTotal and targeting a German\nchemical company aligns with our prior observations and research from previous intelligence\nreporting highlighting Winnti Group’s interest in German DAX companies. As a result,\norganizations of all sizes, but especially small to medium sized companies, including Germany’s\n_hidden champions, should prepare against such threats as they are vital to the economic_\necosystem and continuous development of niche markets. Government oversight (local, regional,\nand across the EU) should ensure susceptible organizations such as these are following\nregulation and implementing security best practices to protect against future attacks.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n4209b457f3b42dd2e1e119f2c9dd5b5fb1d063a77b49c7acbae89bbe4e284fb9\n\ncf3a7d4285d65bf8688215407bce1b51d7c6b22497f09021f0fce31cbeb78986\n\n1865013aaca0f12679e35f06c4dad4e00d6372415ee8390b17b4f910fee1f7a2\n\n8ddc6dd9fc3640cd786dfbc72212cd001d9369817aa69e0a2fa25e29560badcf\n\nbfa8948f72061eded548ef683830de068e438a6eaf2da44e0398a37ac3e26860\n\ndf6af36626d375c5e8aff45c64bfc1975d753b109e126a6cb30ee0523550329c\n\n4209b457f3b42dd2e1e119f2c9dd5b5fb1d063a77b49c7acbae89bbe4e284fb9\n\ncf3a7d4285d65bf8688215407bce1b51d7c6b22497f09021f0fce31cbeb78986\n\n1865013aaca0f12679e35f06c4dad4e00d6372415ee8390b17b4f910fee1f7a2\n\n8ddc6dd9fc3640cd786dfbc72212cd001d9369817aa69e0a2fa25e29560badcf\n\nbfa8948f72061eded548ef683830de068e438a6eaf2da44e0398a37ac3e26860\n\ndf6af36626d375c5e8aff45c64bfc1975d753b109e126a6cb30ee0523550329c\n\n*.dick[.]mooo[.]com\n\n208[.]67[.]222[.]222\n\n\n-----\n\n45[.]248[.]85[.]200\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n#### Tactic Technique Recommended Course of Action\n\n\n#### Persis‐ tence / Privilege Escalation\n\n Defense Evasion\n\n\n#### T1215 Kernel Modules and Extensions\n\n T1068 Ex‐ ploitation for Privilege Escalation\n\n T1009 Binary Padding\n\n T1014 Rootkit\n\n T1116 Code Signing\n\n\n#### Anti-Virus software and Advanced End-Point solution can drastically reduce the risk of both techniques.\n\n Many of the samples analysed were signed with expired / revoked certificate.
