It is possible that\nthe two groups share tradecraft and access. Elements of COBALT MIRAGE activity have\n[been reported as PHOSPHOROUS and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/) [TunnelVision.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/log4j2-in-the-wild-iranian-aligned-threat-actor-tunnelvision-actively-exploiting-vmware-horizon/)\n\nBased on intelligence gained from Secureworks incident response engagements and public\nreporting, CTU™ researchers identified two distinct clusters of COBALT MIRAGE intrusions\n[(labeled as Cluster A and Cluster B in Figure 1). In Cluster A, the threat actors use BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-device-encryption-overview-windows-10)\n[and DiskCryptor to conduct opportunistic ransomware attacks for financial gain. Cluster B](https://diskcryptor.org/)\nfocuses on targeted intrusions to gain access and collect intelligence, but some of the activity\nhas experimented with ransomware.\n\n_Figure 1. Clusters of COBALT MIRAGE activity. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCOBALT MIRAGE has demonstrated a preference for attacking organizations in Israel, the\nU.S., Europe, and Australia. The threat actors obtain initial access via scan-and-exploit\nactivity. In 2021, COBALT MIRAGE scanned ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for devices\n[vulnerable to Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379) [CVE-2020-12812, and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12812) CVE2019-5591. From late September 2021, the group used a broad scan-and-exploit campaign\n[targeting Microsoft Exchange servers. The threat actors exploited the ProxyShell](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/8/17/from-pwn2own-2021-a-new-attack-surface-on-microsoft-exchange-proxyshell)\n[vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34473) [CVE-2021-34523, and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34523) [CVE-2021-31207) to deploy Fast](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31207)\nReverse Proxy client (FRPC) and enable remote access to vulnerable systems.\n\nIn November 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\n[released an advisory (AA21-321A) pertaining to activity that CTU researchers attribute to](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\nCOBALT MIRAGE. The advisory does not name a specific group, instead referring to an\n\"Iranian government-sponsored APT group.\"\n\nIn January 2022, COBALT MIRAGE used access obtained through ProxyShell exploitation,\npossibly conducted in late 2021, to enter the network of a U.S. philanthropic organization. On\nJanuary 6, the threat actors created and accessed a web shell named\naspx_okqmeibjplh.aspx. The format of this filename matches an established pattern\nassociated with COBALT MIRAGE ransomware operations: aspx_[a-z]{13}\\.aspx. Attackerinitiated HTTP requests to the web shell used a User-Agent named python-requests/2.23.0,\n\n\n-----\n\n[indicating the use of scripts that leverage the Python Requests library. The Python reference](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)\nis likely due to the threat actors using a Python-based proof-of-concept ProxyShell exploit in\ntheir initial attack and potentially additional scripted commands during the intrusion.\n\nAfter the threat actors obtained access via the web shell, three files were dropped on the\nweb server: Wininet.xml, Wininet.bat, and dllhost.exe. CTU analysis of Wininet.xml revealed\nit being used to create a scheduled task that launches C:\\Windows\\Wininet.bat. When\nWininet.bat is launched, it executes C: \\Windows\\dllhost.exe (see Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. Process tree showing the execution of dllhost.exe. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nDllhost.exe is a custom Go binary that references GitHub repositories associated with Fast\nReverse Proxy (FRP), indicating the binary is based at least in part on this tool. FRP is\nroutinely deployed by COBALT MIRAGE. However, dllhost.exe also includes code from other\nprojects and behaves differently from a typical FRPC binary.\n\nWhen the threat actors execute dllhost.exe on a compromised Exchange server, the binary\nexecutes three commands as child processes (see Figure 3). These processes collect basic\ninformation about the host and establish a tunnel to the defined command and control (C2)\nservers. There are two versions of the same PowerShell command. One version uses an\nolder PowerShell binary filename. The other uses the pwsh.exe filename implemented in\nPowerShell Core 6.0, which was released in January 2018.\n\n_Figure 3. Commands executed by dllhost.exe. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nDllhost.exe uses the 'tcp443 . msupdate . us' and 'kcp53 . msupdate . us' subdomains for\ncommand and control. The inclusion of a protocol (tcp, kcp) and port number (443, 53) is a\npattern across COBALT MIRAGE subdomain names. This binary has also been distributed\nfrom http: //148 . 251 . 71 . 182/update_win. In December 2021, CTU researchers observed\n[COBALT MIRAGE experimenting with Log4j exploits hosted on 148](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/log4j-vulnerability-faqs) 251 71 182\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors conducted a Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) dump soon\nafter dllhost.exe executed its commands. LSASS is a Windows process that stores local\nusernames and passwords for authenticated users. Threat actors can use the data to derive\nvalid credentials by brute-force cracking New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes or\nextracting passwords stored in plain text.\n\n[CTU researchers' observations and analysis of these attacks align with third-party reporting](https://thedfirreport.com/2022/03/21/apt35-automates-initial-access-using-proxyshell/)\nof other activity that CTU researchers attribute to COBALT MIRAGE. Those reports describe\nProxyShell being used to deploy web shells and files with the same filenames around the\nsame time period as these attacks.\n\nThree days after deploying dllhost.exe, the threat actors used Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP) and a built-in user account (DefaultAccount) to log onto the compromised Exchange\nserver (see Figure 4). This was the first login to the server from DefaultAccount and could\n[indicate the beginning of threat actor hands-on-keyboard activity. The threat actors then](https://www.secureworks.com/about/press/secureworks-hands-on-keyboard-detector-identifies-malicious-threat-actors)\nattempted to extract locally cached passwords by again dumping the LSASS process. They\nenumerated the environment via the SoftPerfect Network Scanner tool using the filename\nnetscanold.exe.\n\n_Figure 4. COBALT MIRAGE actions in January 2022 intrusion. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe threat actors moved laterally and encrypted three user workstations with BitLocker,\nrendering them inaccessible to the compromised organization's staff. Due to an absence of\nlogging and forensic artifacts, the methods used to trigger BitLocker in this environment are\nunclear. However, other COBALT MIRAGE ransomware attacks used a script (see Figure 5)\nto automate the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Ransomware attack script used by COBALT MIRAGE to activate BitLocker._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThis script performs the following actions:\n\nSets a 'mail=' variable to a defined contact email address\nEnables Terminal Services (renamed Remote Desktop Services after Windows Server\n2008)\nCreates a firewall rule to enable RDP access to the host\nStarts Terminal Services\nInitiates BitLocker disk encryption\nDefines a ransom message\nAdds multiple registry keys related to BitLocker and creates a message that displays\nthe ransom message and contact email address\nCreates a 'MSSQL' user account on the compromised system with password\n_AS_@1394 and adds it to the administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors completed the attack with an unusual tactic of sending a ransom note to a\nlocal printer. The note includes a contact email address and Telegram account to discuss\ndecryption and recovery (see Figure 6). This approach suggests a small operation that relies\non manual processes to map victims to the encryption keys used to lock their data. As of this\npublication, CTU researchers are not aware of a COBALT MIRAGE leak site. Although some\n[Iranian-linked attacks against Middle Eastern organizations in 2020 and 2021 appeared to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackshadow-hackers-breach-israeli-hosting-firm-and-extort-customers/)\nuse ransomware to cause fear and disruption, the victimology of the COBALT MIRAGE\nattacks suggests that these threat actors are focused on financial gain.\n\n_Figure 6. January 2022 COBALT MIRAGE ransom note. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn March 2022, CTU researchers attributed an intrusion in a U.S. local government network\nto COBALT MIRAGE based on the use of a DefaultUser user account, deployment of FRPC\nto the victim's network, and use of infrastructure that matches a pattern associated with\nCOBALT MIRAGE. However, ransomware was not used in the attack. This activity is part of\nCluster B.\n\nAnalysis of COBALT MIRAGE attacks is challenging because unrelated threat actors have\noften also compromised the environment using the same vulnerabilities (e.g., ProxyShell,\n[Log4Shell). Many of these threat actors use the same publicly available proof-of-concept](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/log4shell-easy-to-launch-the-attack-but-hard-to-stick-the-landing)\ncode and may access the same environment multiple times, dropping redundant web shells.\nCryptominer infections are often observed alongside COBALT MIRAGE activity, but they may\nhave been deployed by another group.\n\nThe initial access vector in the March 2022 engagement is unclear, but the threat actors\n[likely exploited Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) [CVE-2021-45046) on the victim's](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)\nVMware Horizon infrastructure. In early 2022, CTU researchers observed multiple threat\nactors exploiting Log4j vulnerabilities on VMware Horizon to deploy cryptominers. The initial\nexploitation by COBALT MIRAGE may have occurred as early as late January 2022. After\nobtaining access, COBALT MIRAGE used the DefaultAccount user to move laterally within\nthe environment via RDP.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the intrusion activity spanned a four-day period in mid-March. At one point, the threat\nactors used a system in the victim's environment to conduct Google searches for \"upload file\nfor free\" and then accessed filemail . com, ufile . io, mega . nz, and easyupload . io. Logs\nindicate that one or more of these sites may have been used to exfiltrate data from the\nenvironment. The threat actors also downloaded several files (e.g., 23.zip, pxy.zip, pxy.rar)\nonto compromised systems using the easyupload . io and ufile . io file-sharing services.\n\nThe 23.zip file was not available for analysis, but pxy.zip includes a set of files to establish a\npersistent remote tunnel to an attacker-controlled server via FRPC (see Figure 7). The hash\nof the FRPC binary deployed by the threat actors is identical to the binary hash listed in the\nNovember 2021 CISA advisory. Similar to other COBALT MIRAGE domains used in Cluster\nB, the C2 domain in this incident (my-logford . ml) is registered with the Freenom registrar.\nDomains in Cluster A are typically registered with Porkbun.\n\n_Figure 7. Contents and execution flow of files in pxy.zip. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nPxy.rar contains the same files as pxy.zip and also includes wmiexec.exe, which is a\n[compiled version of the Python-based wmiexec.py Impacket tool. The threat actors obtained](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)\naccess to multiple accounts within the victim's environment and downloaded pxy.zip to\nseveral hosts to provide redundant access. The Ngrok tunneling tool was also deployed\nwithin the environment while the COBALT MIRAGE actors were present, but it is unclear if\nthey deployed the tool or if it was deployed by another threat group. Iranian threat groups\nsuch as [COBALT FOXGLOVE have used this tool in the past, but there is no indication that](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/cobalt-foxglove)\nCOBALT FOXGLOVE was involved in this intrusion.\n\nThe threat actors downloaded a network scanner to enumerate the environment, performing\na Google search for \"softperfect network scanner portable\" and downloading\nnetscan_portable_v621.zip from mega . nz. The threat actors conducted multiple scans and\nbased the results filename on the IP address of the scanned system. The threat actors\nuploaded the network scans and other tool output to ufile . io.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the March 2022 intrusion was detected and disrupted, no additional malicious activity\nwas observed. CTU researchers have not directly observed ransomware attacks linked to\nCluster B, but there is evidence that those threat actors may be experimenting with\n[ransomware. A file (rsf.exe) uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis service from Iran on](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/014e73d083df4a5816bd838d03a1b38e1438914154fe0bb7d988d05df0407b84/relations)\nDecember 29, 2021 appears to be an unfinished attempt at ransomware. It contains a PDB\nstring with an unusual username (C:\\Users\\pugna\\) that was also identified in the\n[PowerLessCLR remote access trojan (RAT). This RAT has been hosted on the 162 . 55 . 137](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/powerless-trojan-iranian-apt-phosphorus-adds-new-powershell-backdoor-for-espionage)\n. 20 IP address used by COBALT MIRAGE. CTU researchers have also observed COBALT\n[MIRAGE infrastructure hosting files related to the HiddenTear open-source ransomware](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.hiddentear)\nfamily but have not observed the ransomware being deployed to targets.\n\nThe January and March incidents typify the different styles of attacks conducted by COBALT\nMIRAGE. While the threat actors appear to have had a reasonable level of success gaining\ninitial access to a wide range of targets, their ability to capitalize on that access for financial\ngain or intelligence collection appears limited. At a minimum, COBALT MIRAGE's ability to\nuse publicly available encryption tools for ransomware operations and mass scan-and-exploit\nactivity to compromise organizations creates an ongoing threat. CTU researchers\nrecommend that organizations prioritize patching high-severity and highly publicized\nvulnerabilities on internet-facing systems, implementing multi-factor authentication, and\nmonitoring for the tools and file-sharing services used by COBALT MIRAGE.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note\nthat IP addresses can be reallocated.
