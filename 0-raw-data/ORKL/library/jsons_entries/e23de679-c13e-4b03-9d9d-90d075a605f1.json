We dubbed this campaign “Operation LagTime IT”\nbased on entities that were targeted and the distinctive domains registered to C&C IP infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in early 2019, these threat actors targeted a number of government agencies in East Asia\noverseeing government information technology, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, economic development,\nand political processes. We determined that the infection vector observed in this campaign was spear\nphishing, with emails originating from both free email accounts and compromised user accounts.\n[Attackers relied on Microsoft Equation Editor exploit CVE-2018-0798 to deliver a custom malware that](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0798)\nProofpoint researchers have dubbed Cotx RAT.\n\nAdditionally, this APT group utilizes Poison Ivy payloads that share overlapping command and control\n(C&C) infrastructure with the newly identified Cotx campaigns. Based on infrastructure overlaps, postexploitation techniques, and historic TTPs utilized in this operation, Proofpoint analysts attribute this\nactivity to the Chinese APT group tracked internally as TA428. Researchers believe that this activity has\nan operational and tactical resemblance to the Maudi Surveillance Operation which was previously\nreported in 2013 [1].\n\n**Delivery**\n\nProofpoint researchers initially identified email campaigns with malicious RTF document attachments\ntargeting East Asian government agencies in March 2019. These campaigns originated from adversaryoperated free email sender accounts at yahoo[.]co[.].jp and yahoo[.]com. Sender addresses often\nimitated common names found in the languages of targeted entities. Spear phishing emails included\nmalicious .doc attachments that were actually RTF files saved with .doc file extensions.\n\nThe lures used in the subjects, attachment names, and attachment content in several cases utilized\ninformation technology themes specific to Asia such as governmental or public training documents\nrelating to IT. On one specific occasion an email utilized the subject “ITU Asia-Pacific Online CoE\nTraining Course on ‘Conformity & Interoperability in 5G’ for the Asia-Pacific Region, 15-26 April 2019”\nand the attachment name “190315_annex 1 online_course_agenda_coei_c&i.doc”. The conference\n\n\n-----\n\nreferenced in the lure was an actual event likely selected due to its relevance to potential victims. This is\nsignificant as countries in the APAC region continue to adopt Chinese 5G technology in government as\nwell as heavy equipment industries.\n\n_Figure 1: Example lure used by TA428 referencing an APAC IT conference_\n\nWe identified several government agencies targeted as part of Operation LagTime IT. These agencies\nare responsible for overseeing IT, scientific research, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, political\nprocesses, and financial development.\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nAs we previously noted, the malicious RTF attachments exploited vulnerabilities in the Microsoft\nEquation Editor, specifically CVE-2018-0798, before downloading subsequent payloads. The exploit\nuses an encoded RTF object to drop a PE file to the Windows temporary directory. The dropped PE file\nhas the distinctive file name “8.t”. When executed, writes a Word Add-In file with the “.wll” extension to\nthe Windows Startup directory, which runs the next time Word is opened. It should be noted that this\ndropper methodology is not unique to TA428, and has been identified by security researchers in\ncampaigns related to at least four additional Chinese APT groups. RTF files leveraging this technique\nhave historically contained the string \"objw871\\\\objh811\\\\objscalex8\\\\objscaley8\" which has been noted\nby researchers at Anomali [2] and FireEye. Researchers have also recently observed this RTF\nweaponizer tool in commodity campaigns delivering Async RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter it is executed, the .wll file renames itself as RasTls.dll. Simultaneously, it decrypts a legitimate\nSymantec PE binary commonly named IntelGraphicsController.exe or AcroRd32.exe. This legitimate\nSymantec binary is used to side-load RasTls.dll using DLL search-order hijacking leading to the\nexecution of Cotx RAT malware. Once executed the RasTls.dll file next resolves the addresses of the\nDLL libraries it is programmed to access and ensures that it is only running in one of five predetermined\nprocesses. These processes are winword.exe, excel.exe, powerpnt.exe, eqnedt32.exe, and\nacrord32.exe. The first four of these processes are associated with Microsoft Word, Excel, and\nPowerPoint exploits, as well as the Equation Editor exploit used by the initial malicious RTF in this\ncampaign. The last process is utilized as part of the loading process for Cotx RAT and involves the\nlegitimate Symantec binary noted above. The inclusion of the processes excel.exe and powerpnt.exe\nsuggests that this stage one malware may be capable of utilizing .xls and .ppsx files as droppers.\nResearchers at SectorB06 [4] have noted this stage-one payload and indicated that throughout the\nabove process it is running a “CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent” function to prevent analysis and\ndebugging by researchers.\n\n**Malware: Cotx RAT**\n\nThe RasTls.dll contains the Cotx RAT code. The malware is written in C++ using object-oriented\nprogramming. We named it by borrowing the name of the location of its stored configuration. The\nencrypted configuration is stored in the side-loaded DLL file RasTls.dll in a PE section named “.cotx”.\nThe current encrypted configuration is also stored in the registry key\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Intel\\Java\\user”.\n\nThe configuration data is AES-192-encrypted using CBC mode and base64-encoded. We determined\nthat the encryption key was \"98151137ab12780969b2c3612072018709a83a3352466a8b\" (hexencoded) and the initialization vector “IV” was “2042123224315117031b1a0a3ccda53f” (hex-encoded).\nIn plaintext the configuration appears as follows:\n```\n*\\x00\\x00\\x00217.69.8.255|||1.187.1.187|mark3|P@SSaw1||\\x00\\x00\nThe first four bytes contain the size of the configuration (42-bytes). The configuration is\npipe delimited and contains:\n\n```\n1. C&C host 1\n2. C&C host 2\n3. C&C host 3\n4. Definition of two C&C ports\n\n1. An example string looks like an IP address: \"1.187.1.187\"\n2. The string is split on \".\"\n3. Port 1 is defined by (piece0 << 8) + piece1 = (1 << 8) + 187 = 443\n4. Port 2 is defined by (piece2 << 8) + piece3 = (1 << 8) + 187 = 443\n5. Alternatively, if the string is not an IP address, but looks like a host, it will resolve the host\n\ninto an IP address and calculate the ports using the resolved address\n5. \"mark\" field - sent in the C&C beacon\n6. \"passwd\" field - sent in the C&C beacon\n7. Proxy IP and port\n\n1. Discovered by searching the IPv4 TCP connection table for established connections with\n\nremote ports using common proxy ports (3128, 8080, 808, 1080)\n2. Or via WINHTTP_OPTION_PROXY\n\n\n-----\n\nFor persistence, Cotx stores files in a directory Intel\\Intel(R) Processor Graphics . The location of this\nfolder varies among samples with both the %AppData% and %PROGRAMFILES% directories being\nobserved.\n\nThe command and control structure of Cotx RAT is proxy aware. It utilizes wolfSSL for TLS encrypted\ncommunication. The initial beacon contains “|”-delimited system information. The data included in the\nbeacon is Zlib compressed and encrypted with AES-192 in CBC mode utilizing the same keys as the\nconfiguration. The following values are included:\n\n\"id\" value from \"software\\\\intel\\\\java\" subkey\nComputer name\n\"mark\" field from configuration\nUsername\nWindows version\nArchitecture\nPossible malware version. \"0.9.7\" is hardcoded in the analyzed sample\nLocal IP addresses\nFirst adapter's MAC address\nConnection type (https or _proxy)\n\"password\" field from configuration\n\nCommands from the C&C are received from the malware beacon. This data is AES-encrypted. We\nobserved the following commands:\n\n0 - Keep alive, sets a \"poll again\" flag and sends an empty response to C&C\n1 - Sets \"id\" value in \"software\\\\intel\\\\java\" subkey, sends an empty response to C&C\n2 - Get directory info or drive info\n5 - Open command shell\n6 - Open command shell as logged in user\n7 - Send command to command shell\n8 - Copy file\n9 - Delete file\n10 - Read file\n11 - Check for filename. If doesn't exist, check for filename with \".ut\" extension. If it exists, send\nfile size back to C&C\n12 - Write file\n13 - Screenshot\n14 - Process listing\n15 - Kill process\n16 - Send current configuration to C&C\n17 - Update config in registry and \".cotx\" PE section\n18 - Set sleep time\n19 - Close C&C comms\n20 - Uninstall and remove self\n21 - Get list of installed software\n22 - Kill command shell\n23 - Exit malware\n24 - Send a \"Ctrl-C\" to the command shell and exit\n\n\n-----\n\n25 - Execute an executable\n\n**Malware: Poison Ivy**\n\nTA428 threat actors also delivered Poison Ivy malware payloads. In a limited number of cases, we\nobserved attachments utilizing the 8.t dropper methodology described above. However, the majority of\nPoison Ivy payloads were dropped as PE files named OSE.exe when the RTF attachment was\nexecuted and an Equation Editor vulnerability was successfully exploited. The Poison Ivy samples all\ncommunicated with the IP 95.179.131[.]29. We identified earlier variants of Poison Ivy malware that\nutilized the above IP via open source research, which used the file names bubbles.exe and sfx.exe.\nExamination of the Poison Ivy malware configurations indicated that all samples shared the password\n“3&U<9f*lZ>!MIQ” while campaign and group IDs, as well as mutexes varied across campaigns.\n\nWe identified significant operational overlap between Cotx RAT campaigns and Poison Ivy campaigns.\nSpecifically, on several occasions users that were unsuccessfully targeted with Cotx RAT malware were\nlater targeted with messages distributing Poison Ivy. Users were also targeted by Poison Ivy malware\non successive occasions indicating the adversary’s persistent nature in attempting to compromise\ntargets via spear phishing. In one example, a targeted user received an unsuccessful phishing email\nattempting to deliver Cotx RAT followed by a Poison Ivy phishing email seven days later. In addition to a\nshared targeting list, analysts observed adversary reuse of free email sender accounts to deliver both\nCotx RAT and Poison Ivy malware to different users. It appears the adversary sender accounts utilized\ndelivery TTPs and payloads interchangeably from March through April 2019. This vacillation of tactics\nfurther enforces Proofpoint’s classification of these campaigns under a single operation.\n\n**C&C Infrastructure**\n\nAn examination of the separate C&C infrastructure utilized by Cotx RAT and Poison Ivy payloads\nrevealed further overlaps between these campaigns. A review of passive DNS information indicated that\nthe C&C IPs hosted subdomains that share the root domain vzglagtime[.]net. We found that the Poison\nIvy C&C IP hosted the domains f1news[.]vzglagtime[.]net and news[.]vzglagtime[.]net. The Cotx RAT\nC&C IP hosted the hostname mtanews.vzglagtime[.]net. The latter of these domains was previously\nreported by security researchers to have been a C&C address observed in a malware implant targeting\nthe East Asian Telecommunications and Transportation sectors in January 2019. The presence of\nrelated domain registrations on disparate malware IP infrastructure also contributed to analysts’\ndecision to classify these campaigns collectively under Operation LagTime IT.\n\n**Poison Ivy** **Cotx RAT**\n\n**C&C IP** 95.179.131[.]29 217.69.8[.]255\n\n**Domains Hosted by IP** f1news.vzglagtime[.]net news.vzglagtime[.]net mtanews.vzglagtime[.]net\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nProofpoint analysts assess that Operation LagTime IT is likely a continuation of targeted activity by APT\nactors aligned with Chinese state interests. This operation, centered around East Asian governmental\nagencies, may represent efforts to satisfy espionage and intelligence requirements relative to China’s\n\n\n-----\n\nregional neighbors. While not revolutionary in its approach or malware design, TA428 actors\ndemonstrated significant persistence in compromising victims and utilized custom malware. The defined\nscope of targeting in this operation including government information technology agencies\ndemonstrates a focus on high-value targets. While ultimately the motivation for this APT campaign\nremains opaque, what is certain is that TA428 persists in targeting users responsible for the\norchestration of governmental systems in East Asia.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2012/NormanSharkMaudiOperation.pdf\n\n[2] https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-aptshave-a-shared-supply-chain\n\n[3] [https://speakerdeck.com/ashley920/into-the-fog-the-return-of-icefog-apt](https://speakerdeck.com/ashley920/into-the-fog-the-return-of-icefog-apt)\n\n[4] [https://threatrecon.nshc.net/2019/04/30/sectorb06-using-mongolian-language-in-lure-document/](https://threatrecon.nshc.net/2019/04/30/sectorb06-using-mongolian-language-in-lure-document/)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n304115cef6cc7b81f4409178cd0bcea2b22fd68ca18dfd5432c623cbbb507154 SHA256 Cotx RAT\n\nd0ccb9a277b986f7127199f122023c79a7e0253378a4a78806fbf55a87633532 SHA256 Cotx RAT\n\n81898df69e28a084ea37b77b568ccde34afdf96122ab784f8a361f055281ed0f SHA256 Cotx RAT\n\n93ac0ff3f01f8b8dfad069944d917e4b0798d42bc9ff97028e5a4ea8bda54dbc SHA256 Cotx RAT\n\n3dbff4e82dd8ddf71f9228f68df702b8f4add47237f2aee76bd5537489ed2fa9 SHA256 Cotx RAT\n\ncbf607725d128d93fed3b58cde78e1feb7db028a1ed1aa5c924e44faa1015913 SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\n9a477b455a20a26875e5ff804151f9f6524131c32edf04366cfbaf9d41c83f2a SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\neb0191d1b8e311d2716795e9fa7c0300c5199ebf3d8debff77993f23397d2fb5 SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\n1bc93ef96134be9a5a7b5f5b747be796a9ff95bdc835d72541673565d1c165b8 SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\n4c22eb33aa1d10511eaf8d13098e2687e44eaebc5af8112473e28acedac34bea SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\n\n-----\n\n93f56ec68e072ccba8102c71d005604763d064021795c7c8bb1cade05ddb6ff6 SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\ne9fa0a6223b0e4e60654dc629cd46174b064d5a0968732e6f05bc212a2cdf3f4 SHA256 Poison Ivy\n\nb7cfea87d7de935e1f20e3c09ba4bd1154580682e75330876f21f241b33946f2 SHA256 8.t Dropper\n\nae3e335cc39c07bda70e26e89003e0d1b8eea2deda2b62a006517c959fc0a27a SHA256 8.t Dropper\n\n1d492e549d2cbd296bc8e1368c8625df0c82c467c1b4addea7191e4a80bf074e SHA256 8.t Dropper\n\nb541e0e29c34800a067b060d9ee18d8d35c75f056f4246b1ce9561a5441d5a0f SHA256 8.t Dropper\n\n95.179.131[.]29 C2 IP Poison Ivy\nC2\n\n217.69.8[.]255 C2 IP Cotx RAT\nC2\n\nf1news.vzglagtime[.]net Domain Domain\nRelated by\nIP\n\nnews.vzglagtime[.]net Domain Domain\nRelated by\nIP\n\nmtanews.vzglagtime[.]net Domain Domain\nRelated by\nIP\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Signatures**\n\n2836210     ETPRO TROJAN SSL/TLS Certificate Observed (SectorB06 Dropper)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
