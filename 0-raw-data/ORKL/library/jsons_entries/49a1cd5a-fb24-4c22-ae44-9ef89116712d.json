Should I avoid contacting everyone,\nbecause, who knows, maybe this person has contracted the coronavirus. Or maybe that\n\n\n-----\n\none? People became somewhat afraid of all other people. And cybercriminals decided to\nmake use of that.\n\n## The Coronavirus Finder (that doesn’t work)\n\nCybercriminals behind Ginp, a banking Trojan that we have covered recently (here’s a post\nabout Ginp on Kaspersky Daily), are up to a new campaign related to COVID-19. After Ginp\nreceives a special command, it opens a web-page called Coronavirus Finder. It has a simple\ninterface that shows the number of people infected with the coronavirus near you and urges\nyou to pay a small sum to see the location of those people.\n\n\n-----\n\nOh, what a relief for some people would it be to know whom to avoid! For some people, the\nmessage looks more than convincing, so they proceed to pay the fee. The amount seems to\nbe quite small, so it’s easy to spare. The web-page then offers you to input your card data to\nmake the transaction.\n\nAs you may remember, Ginp is a very capable banking Trojan that relies on a lot of different\nlures to make users input their credit card data into forms, so that it can steal it. If you\nguessed this web-page is just another form aimed at stealing data — you’ve guessed it right!\n\nOnce you fill in your credit card data, it goes directly to the criminals… and nothing else\nhappens. They don’t even charge you this small sum (and why would they, now that they\nhave all the funds from the card at their command?). And of course, they don’t show you any\ninformation about people infected with coronavirus near you, because they don’t have any.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the speed at which the virus spreads, no one has such information, even the\ngovernments. So don’t fall for this lure. What’s more, to see such a web-page pop up on your\ndevice, you need to have Ginp on it first. As long as you’re protected and don’t have a Trojan\nHorse on your phone, you won’t be seeing such notifications.\n\nAccording to data from Kaspersky Security Network, most users who have faced Ginp, are\nlocated in Spain, just as before. However, this is a new version of Ginp that is tagged “flash2”, while previous versions were tagged “flash-es12”. Maybe the lack of “es” in the tag of the\nnewer version means that cybercriminals plan to expand the campaign beyond Spain.\n\nThat’s not the first time we’ve seen cybercriminals exploit the coronavirus topic. They’ve\n[already used it as bait in phishing messages and created coronavirus-themed malware.](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/coronavirus-phishing/32395/)\n\n## Staying safe from Ginp banking Trojan\n\nOur advice on how to stay safe from Ginp Banking Trojan remains the same:\n\n[Download apps only from Google Play (and disable the option to install apps from other](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/unknown-apps-android/41656/)\nsources).\nStay skeptical. If something seems suspicious – don’t click and, most importantly, don’t\ngive any sensitive data such as logins, passwords and payment credentials away.\nDo not give the Accessibility permission to apps that request it, other than anti-virus\napps.\n[Use a reliable security solution. For example, Kaspersky Internet Security for Android is](https://app.appsflyer.com/com.kms.free?pid=smm&c=ww_kdailyplaceholder)\nquite aware of Ginp and detects it as Tojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Ginp.\n\n[For staying safe from the coronavirus, we suggest that you follow the WHO’s guidelines.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)\n\n[android](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/android/)\n[banking trojans](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/banking-trojans/)\n[coronavirus](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/coronavirus/)\n[Ginp](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/ginp/)\n[mobile banking Trojans](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/mobile-banking-trojans/)\n\nShare article\n\nRelated\n\n\n-----",
