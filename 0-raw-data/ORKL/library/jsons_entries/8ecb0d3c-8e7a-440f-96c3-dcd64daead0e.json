We will examine\nseveral of Rocke's campaigns, malware, and infrastructure while uncovering more\ninformation about the actor. After months of research, we believe that Rocke is an actor that\nmust be followed, as they continue to add new features to their malware and are actively\nexploring new attack vectors.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[Talos has written widely about the issue of cryptomining malware and how organizations](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/malicious-xmr-mining.html&sa=D&ust=1535643040325000)\n[should protect systems against this threat. We continue to actively research developments in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/blocking-cryptomining.html&sa=D&ust=1535643040326000)\n\n\n-----\n\nthis threat through research that includes monitoring criminal forums and deploying honeypot\nsystems to attract these threats. It is through these intelligence sources that the Chinesespeaking actor which we refer to as \"Rocke\" came to our attention.\n\nRocke actively engages in distributing and executing cyrptomining malware using a varied\ntoolkit that includes Git repositories, HttpFileServers (HFS), and a myriad of different\npayloads, including shell scripts, JavaScript backdoors, as well as ELF and PE miners.\n\n## Early campaigns\n\nThis threat actor initially came to our attention in April 2018, leveraging both Western and\nChinese Git repositories to deliver malware to honeypot systems vulnerable to an Apache\nStruts vulnerability.\n\nSeveral files were downloaded to our Struts2 honeypot from the Chinese repository site\ngitee.com for a user named \"c-999.\" Subsequently, the Gitee user page transitioned to \"c888.\" Around the same time, we observed similar activity pulling down files from a gitlab.com\nrepository page for a user named \"c-18.\"\n\nThe repositories on both Gitee and GitLab were identical. All the repositories had a folder\ncalled \"ss\" that contained 16 files. The files were a collection of ELF executables, shell\nscripts, and text files that execute a variety of actions, including achieving persistence and\nthe execution of an illicit cryptocurrency miner.\n\nOnce the threat actor had compromised a system, they achieved persistence on the device\nby installing a cron job that downloads and executes a file \"logo.jpg\" from \"3389[.]space.\"\nThis file is a shell script which, in turn, downloads mining executables from the threat actor's\nGit repositories and saves them under the filename \"java.\" The exact file downloaded\ndepends on the victim's system architecture. Similarly, the system architecture determines if\n\"h32\" or \"h64\" is used to invoke \"java.\"\n\nAlthough we first observed this actor exploiting vulnerabilities in Apache Struts, we've also\nobserved what we believe to the same individual exploiting an Oracle WebLogic server\nvulnerability (CVE-2017-10271), and also exploiting CVE-2017-3066, a critical Java\ndeserialization vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion platform.\n\n## Recent campaign\n\nIn late July, we became aware that the same actor was engaged in another similar\ncampaign. Through our investigation into this new campaign, we were able to uncover more\ndetails about the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed a wget request from our Struts2 honeypot for a file named 0720.bin located\non 118[.]24[.]150[.]172:10555. We visited this IP and found it was an open HFS hosting\n\"0720.bin\" along with 10 additional files: \"3307.bin,\" \"a7,\" \"bashf,\" \"bashg,\" \"config.json,\"\n\"lowerv2.sh,\" \"pools.txt,\" \"r88.sh,\" \"rootv2.sh\" and \"TermsHost.exe.\" We set about examining\nthese files.\n\nScreenshot of HFS system\n\nWe had previously observed this same IP scanning for TCP port 7001 throughout May 2018.\nThis was potentially a scan for Oracle WebLogic servers, which listens on TCP port 7001 by\ndefault.\n\nBoth \"0720.bin\" and \"3307.bin\" are similar ELF files of similar size (84.19KB) that reach out\nto 118[.]24[.]150[.]172, and were marked clean in VirusTotal at the time of discovery.\nMorpheus Labs described a similar file that connects to the same IP address, which could\nopen a shell on the victim's machine if a password-verified instruction was issued from the\nC2. In both our samples, as well as the ones that [Morpheus Labs described, the hard-coded](https://morphuslabs.com/criminals-dont-read-instructions-or-use-strong-passwords-a09439617867&sa=D&ust=1535643040331000)\npassword was not only identical, but also located at the same offset.\n\n\n-----\n\nHard-coded password\n\n\"A7\" is a shell script that kills a variety of processes related to other cryptomining malware\n(including those with names matching popular mining malware such as \"cranberry,\" \"yam,\" or\n\"kworker\"), as well as mining in general (such as \"minerd\" and \"cryptonight\"). It detects and\nuninstalls various Chinese AV, and also downloads and extracts a tar.gz file from\nblog[.]sydwzl[.]cn, which also resolves to 118[.]24[.]150[.]172. The script downloads a file\n[from GitHub called \"libprocesshider,\" which hides a file called \"x7\" using the ID preloader.](https://github.com/gianlucaborello/libprocesshider&sa=D&ust=1535643040332000)\nThe script looks for IP addresses in known_hosts and attempts to SSH into them, before\ndownloading \"a7\" again from the actor's HFS at 118[.]24[.]150[.]172, and execute it.\n\n\n-----\n\nExtract of Source Code of \"a7\"\n\n\"Config.json\" is a mining config file for XMRig, an open-source Monero miner. The file sets\nthe mining pool as xmr[.]pool[.]MinerGate[.]com:45700 and the actor's wallet as\nrocke@live.cn. This is why we have named the actor \"Rocke\" (note that for MinerGate, an\nemail can be used in place of a Monero wallet number — it's simply the login email for the\nMinerGate platform). \"Pools.txt\" appears to be a config file for XMR-stak, an open-source\nuniversal Stratum pool miner that mines Monero, Aeon and more. This configuration file\ncontains the same actor pool and wallet information as the first.\n\n\"Bashf\" is a variant of XMR-stak while \"bashg\" is a variant of XMRig.\n\n\"Lowerv2.sh\" and \"rootv2.sh\" are similar shell scripts that attempt to download and execute\nthe mining malware components \"bashf\" and \"bashg,\" hosted on 118[.]24[.]150[.]172. If the\nshell scripts do not download a miner from 118[.]24[.]150[.]172, they attempt to download a\nfile called \"XbashY\" from 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk.\n\n\"R88.sh\" is a shell script that installs a cron job and attempts to download \"lowerv2.sh\" or\n\"rootv2.sh.\"\n\n\"TermsHost.exe\" is a PE32 Monero miner. Based on the config file it uses, it appears to be\nthe [Monero Silent Miner. This miner can be purchased online for $14 and targets malicious](https://xmrminer.net/faq.php&sa=D&ust=1535643040335000)\nactors. Advertising for the miner promotes it as offering startup registry key persistence,\nmining only while idle and the ability to inject the miner into \"Windows processes to bypass\n\n\n-----\n\nfirewalls. The sample grabs the config file xmr.txt, which contains the same configuration\ninformation as the previous files, from Rocke's command and control (C2) server hosted on\nsydwzl[.]cn. The sample then injects code into notepad.exe, which then proceeds to\ncommunicate with the MinerGate pool. The sample also creates the UPX-packed file\n\"dDNLQrsBUE.url\" in the Windows Start Menu Folder. Intriguingly, this file appears to share\nsome similarities with Cobalt Strike, the popular penetration testing software, which would\nallow the attacker to have greater control over the infected system.\n\n[The payload appears to be similar to one used by the Iron Cybercrime Group, as reported by](https://www.intezer.com/iron-cybercrime-group-under-the-scope-2/)\ncybersecurity firm Intezer in May. Both Iron and Rocke's malware behave similarly, and reach\nout to similar infrastructure. So, while we can asses with high confidence that the payloads\nshare some code base, we are still unsure of the exact relationship between Rocke and Iron\nCybercrime Group.\n\n## The actor\n\n[Through Rocke's MinerGate Monero wallet email rocke@live.cn, we were able to uncover](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:rocke@live.cn)\nadditional information about the actor. We noticed that Rocke's C2 was registered to the\n[address jxci@vip.qq.com. We then found a leak of user information from the Chinese](http://www.moonsec.com/post-467.html&sa=D&ust=1535643040337000)\nsecurity site FreeBuf that showed that a user named \"rocke\" was associated with the email\n[jxci@vip.qq.com. This suggested that they were one in the same. [4]](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:jxci@vip.qq.com)\n\nRocke has been observed seeking access to cloud storage services, as well as obtaining\nmanuals for programming in the Chinese Easy language.\n\nThe majority of websites registered to Rocke list Jiangxi Province addresses for their\nregistration. Some of these websites were for Jiangxi-based businesses, such as\nbelesu[.]com, which sells baby food. We had had additional indications that Rocke is from\nJiangxi based on their GitHub (see below). It is possible that the \"jx\" in jxci@vip.qq.com\nstands for Jiangxi. Therefore, we assess with high confidence that Rocke operates from\nJiangxi Province.\n\n### The GitHub\n\n[We identified a GitHub page apparently associated with Rocke. The GitHub page lists Rocke](https://github.com/rocke&sa=D&ust=1535643040338000)\nas being affiliated with Jiangxi Normal University. In one [repository folder, we found several](https://github.com/rocke/rocke.github.io/tree/master/sample&sa=D&ust=1535643040339000)\nof the same files which were found on the HFS system, including several of the shell scripts\nwith their wallet information included, as well as variants of the miner.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found additional repositories for the same account. Within these repositories, we found\nscripts similar to those found in previous campaigns, with the exception that they reached out\nto sydwzl[.]cn in addition to the previously observed domain 3389[.]space. These findings\nsupport the link between Rocke and the activity we previously observed in April and May.\n\n[We also found an additional repository through Rocke's page that's hosting nearly identical](https://github.com/gosrs&sa=D&ust=1535643040339000)\ncontent, but with a different C2. However, we are unable to determine how that page is being\nused or who is using it.\n\nThe files within their various repositories show that Rocke has become interested in browserbased JavaScript mining through the tool CryptoNote, as well as browser-based exploitation\nthrough the Browser Exploitation Framework. It appears that they are relying on fake Google\nChrome alerts, fake apps, and fake Adobe Flash updates to social engineer users into\ndownloading malicious payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the JavaScript files in the repository, named \"command.js,\" uses hidden IFrames to\ndeliver payloads hosted on CloudFront domains. The payload that we were able to obtain\nwas UPX packed and behaved very similarly to the file \"dDNLQrsBUE.url\" dropped by\n\"TermsHost.exe.\"\n\nRocke has also shown interest in other security-related repositories. They have forked\nrepositories with exploit information, including those related to Apache Struts 2, JBoss and\nShadow Brokers, as well as more general-use tools such as masscan, proxy tools and brute\nforcers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on their activity in the past few months, Talos assesses with high confidence that\nRocke will continue to leverage Git repositories to download and execute illicit mining onto\nvictim machines. It is interesting to note that they are expanding their toolset to include\nbrowser-based miners, difficult-to-detect trojans, and the Cobalt Strike malware. Besides\nnoisy scan-and-exploit activity, it appears that Rocke is likely also pursuing social\nengineering as a new infection vector, as demonstrated by the repositories involving fake\nAdobe Flash and Google Chrome updates.\n\nDespite the volatility in the value of various cryptocurrencies, the trend of illicit cryptocurrency\nmining activity among cybercriminals shows no signs of abating. Rocke's various campaigns\nshow the variety of infection vectors, malware, and infrastructure that these criminals will\nemploy to achieve their goals.\n\n## IOCs:\n\n### Earlier
