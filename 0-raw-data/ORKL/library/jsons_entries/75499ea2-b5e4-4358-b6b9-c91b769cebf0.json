But increasingly, sophisticated hackers are undermining that basic sense of trust\nand raising a paranoia-inducing question: What if the legitimate hardware and software that\nmakes up your network has been compromised at the source?\n\nThat insidious and increasingly common form of hacking is known as a \"supply chain attack,\"\na technique in which an adversary slips malicious code or even a malicious component into a\ntrusted piece of software or hardware. By compromising a single supplier, spies or saboteurs\ncan hijack its distribution systems to turn any application they sell, any software update they\npush out, even the physical equipment they ship to customers, into Trojan horses. With one\nwell-placed intrusion, they can create a springboard to the networks of a supplier's\ncustomers—sometimes numbering hundreds or even thousands of victims.\n\n\"Supply chain attacks are scary because they're really hard to deal with, and because they\nmake it clear you're trusting a whole ecology,\" says Nick Weaver, a security researcher at UC\nBerkeley's International Computer Science Institute. \"You're trusting every vendor whose\ncode is on your machine, and you're trusting every vendor's vendor.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe severity of the supply chain threat was demonstrated on a massive scale last December,\nwhen it was revealed that Russian hackers—later identified as working for the country's\nforeign intelligence service, known as the SVR—had hacked the software firm SolarWinds\nand planted malicious code in its IT management tool Orion, allowing access to as many as\n18,000 networks that used that application around the world. The SVR used that foothold to\nburrow deep into the networks of at least nine US federal agencies, including NASA, the\nState Department, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice.\n\nBut as shocking as that spy operation was, SolarWinds wasn't unique. Serious supply chain\nattacks have hit companies around the world for years, both before and since Russia's\naudacious campaign. Just last month, it was revealed that hackers had compromised a\nsoftware development tool sold by a firm called CodeCov that gave the hackers access to\nhundreds of victims' networks. A Chinese hacking group known as Barium carried out at\nleast six supply chain attacks over the past five years, hiding malicious code in the software\n[of computer maker Asus and in the hard-drive cleanup application CCleaner. In 2017 the](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-unnerving-supply-chain-attack-that-corrupted-ccleaner/)\n[Russian hackers known as Sandworm, part of the country's GRU military intelligence](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers/)\nservice, hijacked the software updates of the Ukrainian accounting software MEDoc and\n[used it to push out self-spreading, destructive code known as NotPetya, which ultimately](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\n[inflicted $10 billion in damage worldwide—the costliest cyberattack in history.](https://www.wired.com/story/white-house-russia-notpetya-attribution/)\n\nIn fact, supply chain attacks were first demonstrated around four decades ago, when Ken\nThompson, one of the creators of the Unix operating system, wanted to see if he could hide\na backdoor in Unix's login function. Thompson didn't merely plant a piece of malicious code\nthat granted him the ability to log into any system. He built a compiler—a tool for turning\nreadable source code into a machine-readable, executable program—that secretly placed\nthe backdoor in the function when it was compiled. Then he went a step further and\ncorrupted the compiler that compiled the compiler, so that even the source code of the user's\ncompiler wouldn't have any obvious signs of tampering. \"The moral is obvious,\" Thompson\n[wrote in a lecture explaining his demonstration in 1984. \"You can't trust code that you did not](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf)\ntotally create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)\"\n\nThat theoretical trick—a kind of double supply chain attack that corrupts not only a widely\nused piece of software but the tools used to create it—has since become a reality too. In\n[2015, hackers distributed a fake version of XCode, a tool used to build iOS applications, that](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/hack-brief-malware-sneaks-chinese-ios-app-store/)\nsecretly planted malicious code in dozens of Chinese iPhone apps. And the technique\nappeared again in 2019, when China's Barium hackers corrupted a version of the Microsoft\nVisual Studio compiler so that it let them hide malware in several video games.\n\nThe rise in supply chain attacks, Berkeley's Weaver argues, may be due in part to improved\ndefenses against more rudimentary assaults. Hackers have had to look for less easily\nprotected points of ingress. And supply chain attacks also offer economies of scale; hack\none software supplier and you can get access to hundreds of networks. \"It's partially that you\n\n\n-----\n\nwant bang for your buck, and partially it s just that supply chain attacks are indirect. Your\nactual targets are not who you're attacking,\" Weaver says. \"If your actual targets are hard,\nthis might be the weakest point to let you get into them.\"\n\nPreventing future supply chain attacks won't be easy; there's no simple way for companies to\nensure that the software and hardware they buy hasn't been corrupted. Hardware supply\nchain attacks, in which an adversary physically plants malicious code or components inside a\npiece of equipment, can be particularly hard to detect. While a bombshell report from\nBloomberg in 2018 claimed that tiny spy chips had been hidden inside the SuperMicro\nmotherboards used in servers inside Amazon and Apple data centers, all the companies\ninvolved vehemently denied the story—as did the NSA. But the classified leaks of Edward\n[Snowden revealed that the NSA itself has hijacked shipments of Cisco routers and](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-nsa-tampers-us-internet-routers-snowden)\n[backdoored them for its own spying purposes.](https://theintercept.com/2019/01/24/computer-supply-chain-attacks/)\n\nThe solution to supply chain attacks—on both software and hardware—is perhaps not so\nmuch technological as organizational, argues Beau Woods, a senior adviser to the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Companies and government agencies\nneed to know who their software and hardware suppliers are, vet them, hold them to certain\nstandards. He compares that shift to how companies like Toyota seek to control and limit\ntheir supply chains to ensure reliability. The same now has to be done for cybersecurity.\n\"They look to streamline the supply chain: fewer suppliers and higher-quality parts from\nthose suppliers,\" Woods says. \"Software development and IT operations have in some ways\nbeen relearning those supply chain principles.\"\n\n[The Biden White House's cybersecurity executive order issued earlier this month may help. It](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)\nsets new minimum security standards for any company that wants to sell software to federal\nagencies. But the same vetting is just as necessary across the private sector. And private\ncompanies—just as much as federal agencies—shouldn't expect the epidemic of supply\nchain compromises to end any time soon, Woods says.\n\nKen Thompson may have been right in 1984 when he wrote that you can't fully trust any\ncode that you didn't write yourself. But trusting code from suppliers you trust—and have\nvetted—may be the next best thing.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: [Get our newsletters!](https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories)\nThe Arecibo Observatory was like family.
