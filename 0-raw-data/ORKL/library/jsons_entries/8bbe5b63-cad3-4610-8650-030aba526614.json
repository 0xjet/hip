    "plain_text": "# Operation DustySky Notes\n\n**Earlier this morning, Eyal from Clearsky Cyber Security published a paper on \"Operation**\n**DustySky\", a set of targeted campaigns attributed back to the Gaza Cybergang. When**\n**working with Clearsky, we observed some interesting details and overlap that didn't quite**\n**fit in the paper, so we wanted to publish them here.�**\n\n# 72.11.148.147\n\n**We found this IP address to be interesting due to the SSL certificate, mix of dynamic DNS�**\n**and registered domains and recent activity.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Based on the heatmap above, a user can easily identify that traffic to this particular IP is�**\n**fairly new (showing in mid-December). What’s worth noting is that the first day starts with�**\n**just one resolution, followed by 17 and then 24. Those first 3 days appears to be�**\n**significant as newly observed domains (notated by the orange flag) are seen and then it’s�**\n**nothing new over the next few weeks.**\n\n**The certificate for this domain is interesting, but does not appear to lead to any new�**\n**discoveries. Clicking on “Serial Number”, “Common Name” and “SHA-1” do not reveal**\n**anymore new IP discoveries or overlap.**\n\n# 192.161.48.59\n\n**This IP address is interesting because of the SSL certificates, but mainly due to some�**\n**overlap with Gaza Cybergang and a strange pattern in the domain changes.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In this heatmap, you can see a clear change from Dynamic/Registered infrastructure to**\n**just dynamic infrastructure in the past ~2.5 weeks. While this may not be significant, it’s�**\n**worth noting and should be investigated or compared to attack times. Did attackers stop**\n**on the same day they switched to dynamic DNS only? Was this infrastructure used**\n**again?**\n\n**Above is a screenshot of the results table from update.ciscofreak.com which used the**\n**192.161.48.59 address back in April of this year. It’s worth noting that based on the**\n**PassiveTotal OSINT tags, you can see that Kaspersky had reported on the Gaza**\n**Cybergang for the IP address 172.227.95.162 which resolved at the same time. While**\n**time periods may not overlap completely (was 192.161.48.59 used for malicious purposes**\n**in April?), it’s still worth investigating.**\n\n# 172.227.95.162\n\n**This IP address was reported by Kaspersky as being linked to Gaza Cybergang and**\n**shows overlap to the DustySky infrastructure in April of this year. Looking at the results,**\n**it’s interesting that it seems to show a similar pattern of dynamic/registered domains and**\n**then a sudden shift to dynamic DNS only.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The results seem to show more potential links to malicious activity with dynamic DNS**\n**domains not mentioned in reporting being shown. Due to the dynamic DNS nature,**\n**there’s a good chance these are not related or may no longer be malicious, but they still**\n**have recent activity that could be used as a research point.**\n\n**Also, worth showing that there’s an SSL certificate associated with the IP address from�**\n**O t b** **f l** **t** **It’** **ild** **d** **tifi** **t** **th t h** **l ti** **t** **Q** **t** **Ai** **�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**started around October. Anything before that period could be suspect. Also, it s strange**\n**that those Dynamic DNS domains continue to point to the IP despite being owned by a**\n**real service. Did the attackers abandon their infrastructure?**\n\n# 45.32.13.169\n\n**This IP address shows a connection to the following SSL certificate starting in October of�**\n**2015.**\n\n**While not incredibly unique, the common name of the certificate is interesting. Looking for�**\n**open source data doesn’t reveal any connections to malware, but the domain itself is**\n**strange and a good point to pivot off of.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Clicking the subject name reveals quite a lot of other IP addresses that used a certificate�**\n**with the same name roughly around the same 6 month time period in 2015. Many of**\n**these appear to be dead-ends, but 131.72.136.124 shows some domains associated with**\n**it that have OSINT hits associating back to PWC reporting on Middle Eastern actors using**\n**xtremeRAT and Poison Ivy and Kaspersky Gaza Cybergang.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The above results for 131.72.136.124 show yet again, an interesting change of dynamic**\n**and registered domains and then going to dynamic only in the past few weeks. Unlikely a**\n**correlation, but interesting nonetheless. The OSINT data is clearly seen by the tags on**\n**within the result table.**\n\n# Co.vu\n\n**It’s valuable to dig into the co.vu usage a bit more for these actors. Going to the services**\n**website reveals a dynamic-like service in which users can obfuscate their Tumblr or**\n**Blogger blog using a co.vu address.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Registering for free gives users 3 free domains they can use. Given these co.vu**\n**addresses are being used in attacks, it’s worth identifying the importance of the domains.**\n**Are they being used for command and control or phishing landing pages or exploit**\n**delivery? The obfuscation on top of an already 3rd-party service shows signs that**\n**attackers are looking to hide their tracks or complicate analysis.**\n\n\n**Share this post**\n\n\n**Tags**\n\n**research** **clearsky**\n\n\n-----",
