Both [XData and the](https://ain.ua/2017/05/24/vse-pro-xdata-poka) [NotPetya ransomware outbreaks used the update servers of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/petya-ransomware-outbreak-originated-in-ukraine-via-tainted-accounting-software/)\nM.E.Doc to deliver their ransomware payloads. Microsoft, Kaspresky, Cisco, and other\ncyber-security companies have specifically pinpointed M.E.Doc software update servers as\nthe source of the NotPetya outbreak.\n\nWe are confident that trojanized MeDoc updates were used as an infection vector\n[against several of our users. https://t.co/5lbvNhn6KX](https://t.co/5lbvNhn6KX)\n\n[— Costin Raiu (@craiu) June 29, 2017](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/880343543373586432)\n\nIt is unclear if this recently discovered ransomware reached users via a trojanized update\nfrom the same server or a trojanized M.E.Doc app installed from scratch.\n\nSince the start of the NotPetya ransomware outbreak that affected countries all over the\nworld, M.E.Doc has consistently denied that it ever hosted trojanized versions of its apps.\n\n[On Facebook, M.E.Doc says it enlisted the help of Cisco experts to clear its name and](https://www.facebook.com/medoc.ua/posts/1905198096434435)\ninvestigate what really happened on its servers. In an email to Bleeping Computer, the\ncompany also said it invited officers from the Department of Cyber Police to also investigate\nwhat happened.\n\nWhile Cisco and Ukrainian authorities are looking into identifying the real culprit behind the\nM.E.Doc server hijacking, it's now becoming clear that there might be another ransomware\nthat used the same server to infect victims, albeit with less successful results than\nNotPetya.\n\n## \"Designed\" to look like WannaCry, but nothing more\n\nThis \"fourth\" ransomware is designed to look like WannaCry, the ransomware that affected\ntens of thousands of computers in mid-May.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalwareHunter says this ransomware was designed to look like WannaCry, but it s not an\nactual clone. For starters, the ransomware is coded in .NET, while the original WannaCry\nwas coded in C.\n\nThe WannaCry lookalike doesn't use any NSA exploits to spread laterally, and its internal\nstructure is also different. The only thing it shares with the original WannaCry it's its GUI\nthat shows the countdown timer and the ransom demand.\n\nIn most cases, .NET-based ransomware is usually a sign that the author has no coding\nexperience. This is not the case with this WannaCry lookalike.\n\n\"The WannaCry lookalike is probably one of the best .NET ransomware strains we've seen,\"\nMalwareHunter says, \"surely no skids made this.\"\n\nThe ransomware infects systems via an initial dropper that unpacks and saves two files\nlocally, the GUI for the WannaCry-like window, and the encrypter component.\n\nThe ransomware uses a Tor-based command and control server, won't start without special\ncommand-line arguments, and will kill processes before encrypting files used in live apps.\nThis last feature, MalwareHunter says is unique for all ransomware families he analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Someone is slinging ransomware at Ukraine\n\nWhat's more peculiar is that this fourth ransomware also fits a pattern observed with the\nprevious strains. This ransomware tries to pass as another family — WannaCry.\n\nThe same thing was noticed with XData — based on stolen AES-NI codebase; PSCrypt —\nbased on GlobeImposter; and NotPetya — disguised as Petya.\n\nRansomware operators trying to pass as famous threats ain't anything new, but AES-NI and\nGlobeImposter are very small enterprises. There's hardly a reason for anyone to imitate\nthese two unless wanting to go under the radar as a very very ordinary operation.\n\nSlowly, it's becoming somewhat clear that someone is slinging ransomware specifically at\nUkraine and is trying to pass as a mundane cyber crime operation, hiding other motives.\n\nPutting all clues together, we see four ransomware campaigns that have targeted Ukraine,\nhave tried to pass as other ransomware threats, have quality code, and three of which\nappear to have used the same server to spread.\n\nThere is no clear-cut evidence that the same person or group is behind all campaigns, but\nthere are too many coincidences to ignore.\n\n### SHA256 hashes:\n\n**Dropper: 51e84accb6d311172acb45b3e7f857a18902265ce1600cfb504c5623c4b612ff**\n\n**GUI: 7b6a2cbb8909616fe035740395d07ea7d5c2c0b9ff2111ae813f11141ad77ead**\n\n**Encrypter: db8e7098c2bacad6ce696f3791d8a5b75d7b3cdb0a88da6e82acb28ee699175e**\n\n### Ransom note:\n\n Ransom note text:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nQ: What s wrong with my files?\nA: Oooops, your important files are encrypted.
