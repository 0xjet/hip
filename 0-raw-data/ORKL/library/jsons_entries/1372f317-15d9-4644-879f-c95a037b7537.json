The findings in this paper give an overview of the actors’ communications styles, persuasion techniques, ransom negotiations, operational and targeting information, and more.\n\n • Conti and Hive have markedly different communication styles, with Conti employing a range of persuasion tactics in what often seem like scripted and somewhat organized exchanges. Hive communications, by contrast, are much shorter, more direct, and void of many of the persuasion techniques that Conti employs. These differences possibly reflect varying levels of organizational oversight for affiliates or may simply exemplify the unique communication styles employed by various ransomware actors.\n\n • Both groups are very quick to lower ransom demands, routinely offering substantial reductions multiple times throughout their negotiations. It is clear that the actors’ initial ransom demand is rarely their bottom line.\n\n • Conti and Hive do research on victim organizations before determining the ransom amount, with both groups typically asking for about one percent of the company’s annual revenue. Both threat actors appear to target entities indiscriminately, likely based on what they assess to be the easiest victims to compromise for quick financial gains.\n\n • Hive operators displayed surprisingly poor operational security, revealing sensitive information about their encryption process and other operational details. Other evidence suggests that Hive affiliates do not adhere to any sort of standard operating procedure and employ any and all means necessary to convince their victims to pay, including offering kickbacks to victim negotiators once the ransom payment is made.\n\n##### INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ransomware space is dynamic, continually marked by new emerging ransomware variants, groups rebranding under\ndifferent names or shutting down operations altogether, and new strategic partnerships between different cybercrime gangs.\nThe focused crackdown on ransomware operations by U.S. authorities and international partners has introduced even more\nchange into this threat space, pushing ransomware actors into the focus of law enforcement’s targeted efforts to disrupt their\noperations. Current events on the international stage have also recently affected at least one major ransomware player, the\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n\nFrom there, we observed the threat actors employing a\nvariety of different persuasion techniques. In many instances,\nthe adversaries attempt to empathize with victims, equating\nthemselves to business people just like the compromised\nentity and claiming that they want to help restore the victim’s\ndata. They appear to make the ransom payment seem like\nit is in exchange for their help, in one instance proclaiming,\n“Fortunately, Conti is here to prevent any further damage!”\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\nThe actors say they will provide “IT support” by offering a “decryption\ntool,” even offering to give the victim a full security report upon payment\nto ensure that such an attack does not happen again in the future. We\nobtained one such security report, which is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nThese are vague, generic recommendations with no specific\nimplementation steps. Such guidance would be very easy to reuse across\ninteractions with numerous victims.\n\nThe actors further mask these extortion attempts by saying they provide\n“damage prevention services,” again purporting to be helpful assistants\nwho can help protect the victim. In many instances, Conti operators\nremind victims about the consequences of having data leaked, including\nsuch information being sold on the dark web to cybercriminals who will\nleverage the data in their own operations, including social engineering\nattacks. The victim’s customers, vendors, employees and investors will all\nbe notified about the breach, Conti warns, but the threat actors claim they\ncan resolve these problems immediately upon payment.\n\nConti also employed other marketing techniques to convince victims to\npay, including offering Christmas and holiday discounts and other price\nreductions intended to make the victim feel like they are getting a good\ndeal. Many of these deals are incentivized by quick payments, with a\nConti actor offering in one instance that the victim can receive a “special\ndiscount” if “we make a deal in the next 72 hours.”\n\nThe tactics outlined so far are Conti’s attempts to be more empathetic\nand make the victim feel like Conti is helping them or cutting them a deal.\nHowever, we also observed Conti employ more aggressive techniques,\nincluding fear and coercion. The threat actors remind victims of the\nreputational damage and legal troubles that will result from a data leak,\nciting media reports about other companies who have faced multi-million\nand billion-dollar lawsuits for data breaches. They use scare tactics by\ntelling the victim that the company’s stock value will nosedive if Conti leaks\ntheir data and threaten to provide competitors with the stolen information.\nThe actors remind the victim of the various governmental bodies and\nregulatory acts that punish organizations for data leaks and revisit the\nnotion of employees becoming identity theft victims if the data is sold on\nthe Dark Web. These threats seemed to intensify as Conti’s frustration with\nthe victim’s slow responses or perceived lack of urgency grew.\n\nThese more aggressive tactics are consistent with recent trends reported\nby the U.S. government. According to CISA’s 2021 global ransomware\n[trends report, ransomware actors are diversifying their approach to](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-040a)\nextorting money, including informing the victim’s partners, shareholders,\nor suppliers about the incident.\n\n**RANSOM NEGOTIATIONS**\n\nThere were several indications that the Conti operators determine victims’\nransom amounts on a case-by-case basis dependent on the organization’s\n\n\n**_Figure 1. Example of security report sent to Conti_**\n_victims by the threat actor._\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\n#### \"The chances that Hell will freeze are higher than us misleading our customers. We are the most elite group in this market, and our reputation is the absolute foundation of our business and we will never breach our contract obligations.\" - Conti operator to victim\n\n\nannual revenue, with the actors stating as much in several\nof the communications we reviewed.\n\nConti actors are very willing to negotiate and almost\nalways offered or approved a lower ransom amount in the\nconversations we reviewed. These reductions were initiated\nby either Conti or the victim depending on the situation, but\nin instances where the victim requested a lower ransom\npayment, the threat actors almost always obliged quickly and\nwith little or no hesitation. In some instances, a lower ransom\npayment would still cost the victim data exposure: In one\ncase, a Conti operator agreed to lower the amount by nearly\n80 percent, but with the stipulation that 80 percent of the\nvictim’s data would be published to their leak site.\n\nThe price reductions that Conti offered were generally\nsubstantial, including 10, 24, 57and 74 percent, and even\nhigher. In one exchange, Conti dropped the ransom demand\nfive times, with the amount dropping a net 98 percent from\n$50 million to $1 million. Despite Conti’s willingness to\nnegotiate, they had limits to how low they would drop the\nransom amount and would eventually hold firm on a final\nfigure. In one case, the lowest figure they were willing to\naccept was $100,000, although we did not have insight into\nthe initial ransom offer or that company’s annual revenue.\nThese findings highlight the actors’ willingness to negotiate\nand also indicate that Conti’s initial ransom demand is more\nof a starting point for negotiations rather than a final offer.\n\nConti also appears similarly flexible on their payment dates,\nwith deadlines frequently being pushed out at victims’\nrequests. These behaviors suggest Conti operators are\nhighly opportunistic cybercriminals who ultimately would\nprefer some payment as opposed to none, even if that\nmeans capitulating to repeated requests by the victim.\n\n\n**REPUTATION MATTERS**\n\nLike most legitimate business operations, cybercriminals\ndepend on maintaining a “good” reputation, at least as\nit relates to following through on agreements with victim\norganizations. This is also top of mind for Conti, as the threat\nactors repeatedly reiterated their strong intent to uphold their\nend of the deal, even appearing angry at times when they\nperceived victims were questioning their trustworthiness.\nIn one exchange, a Conti operator exclaimed, “THERE IS\nNO WAY that we will not fulfill our promises after you pay.”\nIn another conversation, a Conti actor noted the group’s\n“vast experience” in this field, even encouraging the victim\nto Google the group to find evidence that they never “bluff.”\nConti further echoed these sentiments in the following\nremarks: “The chances that Hell will freeze are higher than\nus misleading our customers. We are the most elite\ngroup in this market, and our reputation is the absolute\nfoundation of our business and we will never breach our\ncontract obligations.”\n\nThis level of confidence and bravado is likely an important\ncomponent of Conti’s ability to establish some level of\ntrust — albeit under unique circumstances — with their\n“customers.” The only assurance a victim organization has\nin believing that their stolen data won’t be leaked is the\nthreat actor’s word and, by extension, the group’s broader\nreputation. If Conti hopes to maximize payments, they have\nto employ a combination of coercive and persuasive tactics\nwith firm assurances that they will uphold their end of the\ndeal. This likely explains Conti’s firm, sometimes emotional\nlanguage we observed in these types of interactions.\n\n**OPERATIONAL INSIGHTS AND TTPS**\n\nThese conversations also yielded insight into some of Conti’s\noperational details and tactics, techniques and procedures\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\n(TTPs). Conti uses ProtonMail, an encrypted email service,\nto communicate with victims. They also use various\ntemporary mail and file storage sites, as revealed in their\nconversations with victims, including SendSpace, qaz[.]im\nand PrivatLab. The file hosting sites are especially useful, as\nConti leverages them to share files with victims. In one case,\nthe Conti operator directed the victim to download a deletion\nlog from a PrivatLab site as proof that Conti destroyed all\nexfiltrated data after the victim paid the ransom. In another\ncase, the same site was used to demonstrate that Conti\ncould — and planned to — decrypt the victim’s files upon\npayment, with the victim uploading sample encrypted files\nand the threat actor returning their decrypted versions via\nthe same file share site. Conti also mentioned using Disk\nWipe, a free Windows application for permanent volume data\ndestruction, to delete the victim’s files they exfiltrated after\nthe victim paid the ransom.\n\nConti also uses a variety of other publicly available tools\nin their operations, based on our observations in CTIR\nengagements and open-source reporting. These tools and\nutilities enable every phase of their attack, including initial\naccess, discovery, persistence, lateral movement, defense\nevasion and more. In addition to these publicly available\ntools, such as Cobalt Strike and ADFind, Conti also leverages\nutilities that are natively found on Windows operating\nsystems, such as Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI), the Windows command-line utility Nltest, and remote\ndesktop protocol (RDP).\n\nIn one instance, we observed the Conti operator\nmaking vague references to additional TTPs, including the\ninfection vector. The actor informed the victim that they had\ninfiltrated the victim’s network, “researched them, and found\ncritical vulnerabilities, which enabled [Conti] to access and\nexfiltrate [the victim’s] documentation and encrypt [their]\nfile servers, SQL servers, subdomains, and local networks.”\nBased on our observations in CTIR engagements, Conti\nactors leverage many different vulnerabilities for initial\naccess and lateral movement. Specifically, we have seen\nthem exploit the widely reported vulnerabilities affecting the\n[Apache Log4j logging utility. We have also observed Conti](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-rce-vulnerability.html)\ntargeting vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers as the point\nof initial infection via PowerShell execution of webshells,\naccording to CTIR findings. This serves as a reminder of the\nimportance of organizations applying a patch management\nsystem and keeping all software up-to-date with proper\nsecurity updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\n**_Figure 2. Example of communications between Hive ransomware_**\n_actors and a victim._\n\nHive almost never employs any of the persuasion\nstrategies we observed with Conti, such as marketing\nploys, fear, or coercion. In the few times we did observe a\nHive operator attempt to use persuasive language, it was\nshort, matter-of-fact, and usually prompted by a question\nfrom the victim rather than Hive leading with a forceful\nappeal. We also observed Hive quickly become more\naggressive if the victim failed to respond to the ransomware\noperator’s initial greeting. In one case, after a victim failed\nto respond 14 days after Hive’s initial communication,\nthe Hive operator declared that their patience was gone\nand threatened to send a copy of the victim’s data to the\nSecurities and Futures Commission (SFC), a Hong Kong\nregulatory agency. The operator even provided individual\nemail addresses of SFC members he planned to send\nthe data to. Hive operators also quickly and dramatically\nincreased the ransom demand if the victim did not respond,\nas seen in the excerpt above, where the ransom payment\neventually jumped from $2 million to $10 million after seven\ndays without communication from the victim.\n\n**RANSOM NEGOTIATIONS**\n\nHive’s ransom demands are typically valued at 1\npercent of the victim company’s annual revenue, according\nto Hive operators. Based on our analysis, we largely found\nthis to be the case, but in some instances, the ransom\nwas slightly higher at around 1.5 percent. Much like Conti,\nHive appears very willing to lower their ransom demand,\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\n**_Figure 3. Customized victim page._**\n\nindiscriminately target organizations they may perceive are\nthe easiest to compromise or extort.\n\nThis exchange between Hive and the negotiator may also\nrepresent the lack of standard operating procedures within\nthe Hive group. Relatedly, it possibly represents the potential\nfor individual affiliates to be either less disciplined — or\nmore innovative, depending on one’s interpretation — during\ntheir operations to do anything necessary to convince\ntheir victims to pay. The notion of being undisciplined is\nstrengthened by another observation we made, mentioned\nin the next section, where we saw when a Hive affiliate\ndisplayed poor operational security.\n\n\n**OPERATIONAL INSIGHTS AND TTPS**\n\nThe Hive operators revealed a surprising amount of\ninformation about various components of their operation,\nincluding details pertaining to the ransomware payload, the\nencryption process, and various tools and communication\nplatforms they use. They mentioned that the ransomware\npayload is unique or custom for each individual victim,\nnoting that for this reason, the file hash will not be useful for\nsecurity personnel and network defenders. The operators\nwere also forthcoming about sharing the ransomware hash\nwith the victim when asked, even going so far as to\nprovide the VirusTotal URL linking directly to the file\nsample in one case.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\nIn one of the communications we reviewed, the Hive\noperator stated that it is impossible to recover the\ndecryption keys from memory and decrypt files. The\nransomware overwrites the decryption key in memory to\nprevent its recovery.\n\nIn terms of the encryption process, the threat actor revealed\nthat the ransomware only encrypts about 100KB of each\nfile, including the first 4KB, the last 4KB, and several blocks\nin the middle of the file. The Hive operator noted that the\nransomware acts fast, which is probably enabled by this\npartial encryption. The Hive ransomware is not aware\nahead of time how big or small the files are that it will need\nto encrypt, so it has to make a tradeoff decision between\nspeed and accuracy. That tradeoff is seen in the ransomware\nencrypting files quickly, but not thoroughly. Mistakes the\nHive developers made in their encryption schema make key\nrecovery trivial. The malware only partially encrypts files,\nand reuses a small key for every file it encrypts. The Hive\nmalware authors likely thought they were being clever by\noverwriting the key in memory after the encryption process\nwas complete to prevent investigators from recovering the\nkey directly from device memory, but they were not clever\nenough to realize that they made the classic cryptography\nblunder of one-time-pad reuse, which allows the user to\nrecover the key simply by comparing the encrypted contents\ntogether bitwise. This type of error suggests the malware\ndevelopers are not well-versed in crucial cryptography\nmechanisms. We assess that many other ransomware\ngroups likely have similarly glaring problems, especially the\nones that advertise speed as a performance metric.\n\nThe encryption process is started by a random field value,\naccording to the Hive operator, and after the encryption\nis completed, the program overwrites the area of memory\nwhere the key was stored to prevent key recovery. They note\nthat private and public RSA keys are only used to encrypt/\ndecrypt the random field value, and it is only possible to\ndecrypt the files if you know that random field value. While\nthe actor specified the “random field” is not generated by\na pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), this detail\nappeared to be a sarcastic comment made in jest, based\non the context of the chat. A PRNG is an algorithm used to\ncreate a value which appears random, and is often used as a\nseed to generate entropy in cryptography systems for tasks\nrelated to key security and modes of operation.\nThey also noted that encryption is done using public\nRSA keys, decryption is done using private RSA keys. It's\nimportant to note this is only the case for encrypting the\n\n\nDuring these conversations, the Hive operator noted that\nthey had never disclosed this encryption information to\nanyone before, raising questions about why they elected to\nshare such details in that particular instance. It is possible\nthat they were boasting about that component of their\noperation and they simply did not understand, or care\nabout, the significance of sharing this type of information.\nRegardless, these disclosures again suggest a lack of\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n\nIt is also essential for organizations to implement policies to\nprevent adversaries from using credentials that are either\nsold on dark web cybercriminal forums or that have been\nleaked in other data breaches. Organizations should require\nemployees to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to\n\n\n-----\n\n### p\n\n###### Leveraging victim chats for insights\n\nprovide a higher level of security and ensure that leaked or\nstolen credentials cannot be used to access systems and\nresources. Creating long, complex passwords and enabling\nMFA will help prevent threat actors from using stolen or\ndefault and valid credentials. If feasible, require MFA for all\nusers with administrative privileges, as well as external login\nand remote access methods for applications used within\nthe environment. MFA is the most effective method for\npreventing remote-based compromises and can stop access\nto compromised accounts by requiring all users to provide a\nsecond form of authentication.\n\nIf valid accounts are compromised or leveraged,\nconduct a full password reset, especially for all privileged\naccounts in the domain. The lack of MFA remains one\nof the biggest impediments to enterprise security. Many\nransomware and phishing incidents could have been\nprevented if MFA had been properly enabled on critical\nservices, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or endpoint\ndetection response (EDR) solutions.\n\n\n-----",
