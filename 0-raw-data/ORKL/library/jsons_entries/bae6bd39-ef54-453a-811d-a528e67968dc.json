Comparative Analysis of Custom Exfiltration Tools\n\n**[accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/stealbit-exmatter-exfiltration-tool-analysis](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/stealbit-exmatter-exfiltration-tool-analysis)**\n\n[Security](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security)\n[Cyber Defense](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/cyber-defense-index)\n\nJune 28, 2022\n\nShare\n\nIn the proliferation of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operations as showcased by our\n[previous blog, “Diving into double extortion campaigns”, tools to aid data exfiltration tactics](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/double-extortion-campaigns)\nhave become a commodity. In addition to using ubiquitous tools such as Rclone,\nMegaSync, and FileZilla, ransomware and extortion groups have crafted custom exfiltration\ntools tailored to their operations. The continued use and development of these custom tools\nis a testament to their success, often simplifying and accelerating data exfiltration.\n\nIn this blog, we will examine two (2) exfiltration toolsets identified during CIFR incident\nresponse engagements conducted between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter\nof 2022: StealBit and ExMatter. We will provide a comparative and temporal analysis of the\ntools and the ongoing utilization and development efforts observed over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n**In brief:**\n\nDiscovered in 2021, StealBit and ExMatter are custom exfiltration tools that were\noriginally known to be utilized by LockBit and BlackMatter ransomware operations,\nrespectively.\nA testament to their functionality and effectiveness, these tools have gained popularity\nacross the ransomware and extortion ecosystem.\nSince their original discovery, Accenture Security has observed modified versions of\nthe tools utilized in multiple ransomware incidents involving BlackCat (aka ALPHV)\nand LockBit operators, as well as recent adoption by Conti operators, from the fourth\nquarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.\nBased on [comparative analysis of the tools, while data exfiltration is the consistent](https://acn-marketing-blog.accenture.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CIFR-Exfil-Tool-Comparison-Final.pdf)\noperational objective, the path to achieve that objective and the supporting\nfunctionality of each exfiltration tool varies slightly based on configuration,\nimplementation details, and the operational environment. These variations can create\nchallenges for network defenders.\nFurthermore, based on analysis of more than 15 samples, ExMatter adopts a more\ntargeted approach to file discovery and exfiltration, while StealBit casts a wider net,\nespecially for newer versions with geolocation restrictions removed.\nOf note, a modified version of ExMatter discovered in the first quarter of 2022 includes\ntargeting of Computer Assisted Design (CAD) files, which suggests the operators are\ninterested in exfiltrating data related to engineering documents or product designs that\nare common in industrial environments across the automotive, aviation, and\nmanufacturing sectors.\nBased on analysis of samples obtained from various collection sources, Accenture\nSecurity assesses with high confidence that the tools are being continuously\ndeveloped and improved upon by their authors, and utilization of the tools will\ncontinue into the second quarter of 2022 and beyond.\n\n**Q1 2022 Intrusion Analysis Insights**\n\n[Symantec first publicly described ExMatter in November 2021 and connected the tool with](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/blackmatter-data-exfiltration)\nat least one affiliate using the BlackMatter ransomware variant at the time. The presence of\n[a modified version of ExMatter (aka Fendr) was revealed through investigations conducted](https://securelist.com/a-bad-luck-blackcat/106254/)\nby Accenture Security during several distinct ransomware incidents. Between the fourth\nquarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, CIFR incident responders identified\nBlackMatter and BlackCat ransomware operators using various versions of the tool to aid\nexfiltration operations, as well as Conti ransomware operators during the same time period.\n\nLockBit, formerly known as ABCD ransomware, was first launched in September 2019.\nHowever, it was not until [LockBit's v2.0 release in June 2021 that the group developed and](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220204.pdf)\nutilized the StealBit exfiltration tool in its operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring a recent investigation involving the LockBit v2.0 ransomware, Accenture Security\ndiscovered that the operators initially attempted to download StealBit from a remote server,\nbut ultimately pivoted to the open-source utility Rclone as attempts to utilize the tool were\nprevented. This data point is a testament to the group’s versatility as it shows that while the\nLockBit operators may prefer to use their custom tools, they will ultimately adopt a path of\nleast resistance to achieve their objectives. Furthermore, development efforts for StealBit\nmight have slowed as the more recent compiled versions observed were from the fourth\nquarter of 2021, which included updates for broader targeting through removal of\ngeolocation restrictions, as well as the removal of creation time-date-stamp.\n\nIndustries impacted include the financial services, retail, professional services, and energy\nsectors, with victims across North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\nAccenture Security assesses with high confidence that the tools are being continuously\ndeveloped and improved upon by their authors as the more recent samples analyzed\ninclude additional features and options for customization. For example, a recent version of\nExMatter analyzed during an incident response engagement included specific targeting of\nCAD files, which suggests the operators may be interested in exfiltrating sensitive\nintellectual property related to engineering documents or product designs that are common\nin industrial environments such as the automotive, aviation, and manufacturing sectors.\n\n**Technical Analysis – Comparing StealBit and ExMatter**\n\nBoth custom exfiltration tools are designed to work on a 32-bit Windows system (Intel 386\nor later). Each tool also includes obfuscation techniques that can mask certain data, or\ncode. Important information such as network information of the command-and-control (C2)\nserver address is encrypted in StealBit, while variants of ExMatter's code are protected and\nobfuscated using ConfuserEx (a free, open-source, .NET code protector), and Themida.\n\nThe following table is a comparison summary of the StealBit and ExMatter tools:\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n[Full technical Analysis, countermeasures and TTPs](http://www.accenture.com/)\n\n[READ MORE](https://acn-marketing-blog.accenture.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CIFR-Exfil-Tool-Comparison-Final.pdf)\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nIf you have an incident or need additional information on ways to prevent, detect, respond\nto, or recover from, cyberthreats, contact a member of our CIFR team 24/7/365 by phone\n[888-RISK-411 or email CIFR.hotline@accenture.com.](mailto:CIFR.hotline@accenture.com)\n\n**_Accenture Security is a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including_**\n_advanced cyber defense, applied cybersecurity solutions and managed security operations._\n_We bring security innovation, coupled with global scale and a worldwide delivery capability_\n_through our network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
