Five years later they’re still at it, while managing to keep their own identity a secret.\n\nPhotos that Intrusion Truth posted purportedly show one MSS intelligence officer that the\ngroup alleges was involved in hacking operations conducted by APT 40. Zero Day has\nblurred the faces.\nIn 2017, an anonymous person or group calling themselves Intrusion Truth launched a bold\ninitiative — [a blog devoted to uncovering and publicly exposing the real names of Chinese](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/)\nstate hackers allegedly responsible for stealing billions of dollars worth of trade secrets from\nWestern companies to bolster China’s industries.\n\nThis so-called economic espionage violates the boundaries of what the U.S. considers to be\nacceptable spying, and in 2015 it prompted President Barack Obama to call out China for the\nactivity, which the country has denied doing.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut rather than halt the theft, China simply created an apparatus to lend it plausible\ndeniability that the state is behind the pilfering. Instead of cyber warriors in the People’s\nLiberation Army conducting the operations, China shifted the activity to the Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS), a civilian intelligence agency more adept at stealth hacking, and created\nshell companies to hire civilian hackers to break into Western targets, according to Intrusion\nTruth.\n\n“[T]here are ethical and moral boundaries which the Chinese continue to violate,” the group\n[wrote in a blog post last year. “Utilising [sic] criminals to hack for the state’s bidding, and to](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/07/29/an-incompetent-cyber-program-a-brief-cyber-history-of-the-ccp/)\ndo so to steal IP from hard-working companies provides an unfair advantage to prop up\nChinese businesses.”\n\nTo call out the ruse, Intrusion Truth has made it a mission for the last five years to name and\nshame the actors, publishing more than two dozen blog posts doxxing the alleged hackers\nand the intelligence officers said to be directing their operations.\n\nThey expose names, social media accounts and even personal photos, while documenting\nthe investigative steps taken to unmask the perpetrators. They’ve also relentlessly mocked\nthe targets for making simple mistakes that left a digital trail to their identity, such as using\nthe same email address to both register servers used in hacking operations and to post\nfamily photos on social media.\n\nBut the implications for those targeted by Intrusion Truth go beyond simply having their\nnames exposed. In at least two cases, Chinese nationals identified by Intrusion Truth have\nbeen subsequently indicted by the U.S. Justice Department, creating the risk of arrest should\nthey travel outside China.\n\nIntrusion Truth graphic mocking Chinese state hackers\n\nProponents of the group’s work say Intrusion Truth’s revelations about Chinese hackers are\nvaluable for countering China’s claim that it doesn’t engage in economic espionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nI think it s helpful…to have an organization…calling out Chinese…activity, says Priscilla\nMoriuchi, a non-resident cybersecurity fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center who specializes in\nstate-sponsored Asia Pacific hacking groups. “I think they have extremely solid analytic\ntechniques, and they clearly have a lot of access to typical threat intelligence data and\npeople who know what they’re doing. And largely, I think their reporting has been accurate.”\n\nCiaran Martin, former CEO of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, believes it forces\naccountability on actors who are otherwise protected by their government.\n\n“So much of the harm we suffer is as a result of activity in countries where the people are in\njurisdictions where we can't touch them,” he says. “And I think… specific attributions…to\ngroups have made those groups sometimes feel uncomfortable — more in China and Iran\nthan in Russia.”\n\nOuting anonymous hackers can have a tactical effect, he says, by eroding trust within the\nhacking groups. If members can’t rely on one another to not make basic mistakes that could\nget them all caught — and potentially elicit anger from Chinese officials — it creates mistrust\nand tension.\n\n“[I]t applies tactical pressure to them,” he says. “If it can prove to be tactically useful than why\nnot do it?”\n\nBut there are ethical questions around doxxing people in China who haven’t been charged\nwith a crime. Although some of the Chinese nationals Intrusion Truth exposed have been\nindicted, others have not — nor have they been sanctioned by the U.S. government.\n\nThere are also questions about some of the sources and methods the group uses to uncover\nidentities. Most of the information they rely on is publicly available, but some of it is not. The\ngroup, for example, obtained credit card statements from an unnamed Bank of China source\nto identify one person, and they obtained Uber receipts to show another person commuting\nto and from an MSS building, appearing to confirm his work for the agency. Intrusion Truth\ndidn’t say how the group obtained the receipts.\n\nAnd there are concerns that publicly exposing another country’s state-sponsored hackers\ncould prompt China to do the same with U.S. hackers working for the CIA, the National\nSecurity Agency or U.S. Cyber Command.\n\n“I find it troubling because it seems uncontrolled when we start getting into the doxxing of\noperations and even operators, which starts hitting close to home,” says Joe Slowik, who\nleads threat intelligence operations for the security firm Gigamon and former information\nwarfare officer in the U.S. Navy. “There’s always the question of where are the boundaries? lt\nalso leads to the potential of doxxing the wrong person, which makes me very\nuncomfortable.”\n\n\n-----\n\nMoriuchi, who used to work for the NSA, says mistakes the Chinese hackers make that allow\nthem to be identified aren’t the kinds of mistakes NSA hackers make, but this doesn’t mean\nthere isn’t a risk for U.S. government hackers.\n\n“We don't have anyone at the NSA registering domains under their real name or phone\nnumber,” she said. “But is there information on people, on NSA operators, that could be used\nagainst them? Without a doubt.”\n\nIntrusion Truth acknowledges there are risks that China could start hunting and exposing\nWestern hackers in retaliation, but says the benefits outweigh this.\n\n“Intrusion Truth’s primary goal is to expose the whole truth of Chinese state-sponsored\nhacking. We understand people might have a number of different concerns about what we do\nand how far we go,” a person representing the group wrote in an email interview with Zero\nDay. “But it is important for us and our community that we stick to that primary objective. We\ncan’t let state-sponsored Chinese hackers act with impunity.” [To read the full interview with\nIntrusion Truth, visit [this page.]](https://zetter.substack.com/p/interview-with-intrusion-truth)\n\nZero Day examined the work Intrusion Truth has done over the last five years to analyze its\nmethods, and spoke with a dozen security experts about the pros and cons of exposing\nnation-state hackers and the effect, if any, it has had on curbing China’s theft of trade\nsecrets.\n\nIntrusion Truth\n\nobtained Uber receipts that it says showed an MSS officer commuting to this building, the\nheadquarters of the Tianjin State Security Bureau, a regional arm of the Ministry of State\nSecurity.\n**Who Is Behind Intrusion Truth?**\n\nEver since Intrusion Truth launched there has been speculation about who is behind the\ngroup.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome think it s composed of rogue threat intelligence analysts working for security firms, who\nare frustrated by company policies that prohibit them from publicly identifying Chinese\nhackers under the company’s name. Others think the group is a security company in the U.S.\nor Europe publishing anonymously to avoid retaliation from China. (Intrusion Truth uses\nBritish spelling in blog posts, but this could be an affectation to misdirect suspicion about\nwho is behind the operation.) Still others think the group is a cutout for a Western\ngovernment.\n\nThe timing of indictments following revelations made by Intrusion Truth raises questions\nabout the group’s possible connections to the Justice Department as well as motivations for\nthe group’s work: Does Intrusion Truth coordinate with U.S. prosecutors on the indictments?\nDoes the government use Intrusion Truth to publicly out individuals for which there isn’t\nenough evidence to indict?\n\nIntrusion Truth told Zero Day that the group is composed of and consults “a global network of\nanonymous contributors” from a variety of backgrounds whose identities are sometimes\nunknown even to each other.\n\n“[W]e don’t always know their real-life identity, sometimes just their online persona,” the\ngroup said in an email.\n\nThis doesn’t preclude that Intrusion Truth is a single individual who solicits help from a loose\nnetwork of experts or that this person or members of the network are affiliated with, or\ncollaborate with, a Western government.\n\nMei Danowski, a threat analyst who has followed Intrusion Truth’s work closely, told Zero Day\nshe thinks the group may be engaging in parallel construction — where an intelligence\nagency obtains information through classified means and passes it to another entity to build\na trail to the same information using public, non-classified sources to keep the classified\nmethods and sources secret. Danowski believes someone may be providing Intrusion Truth\nwith the names of the Chinese hackers and tasking them with building a public trail to those\nidentities so the Justice Department can indict them.\n\nAsked about coordination with the government, Intrusion Truth initially replied obliquely: “We\nknow the impact of Intrusion Truth is real. It is not surprising to us that governments are\ninterested in our work and read what we have to say.” But the person responding on behalf\nof the group appeared to deny parallel construction in a followup response, writing that the\n“Intrusion Truth community guides and informs all the work we do, including what Chinese\nhackers we go after.”\n\n\n-----\n\nCredit card statement that Intrusion\n\nTruth says it used to identify a Chinese intelligence official.\n**Exposing APT 3 Hackers**\n\nIntrusion Truth says they were first inspired to publicly out Chinese hackers by the work of an\n[anonymous cybercrime blogger named Cyb3rsleuth, who was partly responsible in 2013 for](http://cyb3rsleuth.blogspot.com/)\n[exposing an assistant professor at China’s PLA Engineering University — reportedly a](http://cyb3rsleuth.blogspot.com/search/label/Chinese%20Threats)\ntraining center for electronic intelligence — for allegedly being a spy. Cyb3rSleuth claimed in\n[an interview with Bloomberg at the time that he was 33 years old and the operator of “an](https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023123/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-14/a-chinese-hackers-identity-unmasked)\nIndia-based computer intelligence company.” He stopped publishing his blog in January\n2016, about a year before Intrusion Truth launched their project.\n\nIntrusion Truth’s work debuted in the spring of 2017 in what appeared to be a response to a\n[news article published by the Washington Free Beacon months earlier. The Free Beacon’s](https://freebeacon.com/national-security/pentagon-links-chinese-cyber-security-firm-beijing-spy-service/)\nNovember 2016 story revealed that an internal Pentagon intelligence report had identified\nthe Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company in China — also known as Boyusec\n— as a contractor or front company for the MSS.\n\nBoyusec, together with Chinese tech giant Huawei, produced security systems for telecom\nnetworks that the Pentagon suspected were embedded with backdoors for the MSS to\nsiphon traffic, according to the Free Beacon. Curious about the company, Intrusion Truth\nbegan investigating it and found that two of Boyusec’s top shareholders had registered\ndomains used for command-and-control servers in APT 3 hacking operations. [APT stands\nfor Advanced Persistent Threat and refers to hacking groups, generally state-sponsored, with\nadvanced skills. To distinguish groups, security researchers number them APT 1, APT 2,\netc.]\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT 3, also known as Gothic Panda and Buckeye in the security community, has been active\nsince 2010 and is accused, among other things, of breaking into tech, aerospace, defense,\nand telecom companies in the U.S. and U.K. It’s also, according to Intrusion Truth, an arm of\nthe MSS intelligence agency.\n\n[When the group published their first blog posts in May 2017 identifying the two shareholders](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/who-is-mr-wu/#more-40)\n— Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao — and their connection to APT 3, the reaction was\n[immediate. Boyusec’s website went offline, and a week later the security firm Recorded](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/05/22/the-destruction-of-apt3/#more-194)\n[Future published its own blog post corroborating the findings with additional information](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/)\nabout Boyusec’s connection to the MSS and APT 3.\n\nMoriuchi, who worked for Recorded Future at the time, was behind the company’s blog post.\nShe had just joined the company and told Zero Day she had been preparing to publish her\nown findings about APT 3’s connections to the MSS when Intrusion Truth trumped her.\n\n“They had a different set of data, [but] I thought, whoa, this is awesome…. I kind of had\nanother side to what they were doing,” she said.\n\nThe timing of Recorded Future’s post made some people in the security community suspect\nMoriuchi or Recorded Future were behind Intrusion Truth. But Moriuchi denies this.\n\n“It’s not me. I don’t know who it is,” Moriuchi told Zero Day, adding that whoever is behind the\ngroup “is highly skilled and has a breadth of skills that are not typically resident in one\nperson.”\n\nAn analyst who currently works for Recorded Future but who asked to remain anonymous to\nspeak freely about the issue, said neither he nor anyone he knows at Recorded Future has\nworked with Intrusion Truth.\n\nThe revelation from Intrusion Truth marked the first time an APT group was conclusively\nlinked to the MSS. Previously, China’s state-sponsored hacking operations were attributed\nprimarily to the People’s Liberation Army. But in late 2015, after Obama called out President\nJinping Xi for China’s economic espionage and the two reached an “understanding” about\n[the activity, security firms reported seeing a drop in such operations from China. In reality,](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/are-chinese-hackers-slowing-down-their-cyber-attacks-u-s-n601961)\nthey had simply shifted to the MSS, which took some time to build up infrastructure for the\noperations. By the time President Trump took office in 2017, China had reportedly resumed\nand even accelerated its intellectual property theft.\n\nSix months after Intrusion Truth exposed the Boyusec shareholders, the U.S. Justice\nDepartment [announced charges against the two men, along with a third colleague, Xia Lei. It](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-three-chinese-hackers-who-work-internet-security-firm-hacking-three-corporations)\nwas the first indictment of Chinese state hackers since 2014, when DoJ had last indicted\nmembers of the PLA.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe three Boyusec associates were charged with computer hacking and theft of trade\nsecrets for allegedly breaching the email account of a prominent economist with Moody’s\nAnalytics in 2011; for hacking and stealing about 400 gigabytes of data from Siemens\nenergy, technology and transportation divisions in 2015; and for hacking the GPS firm\nTrimble in 2015 and 2016 to steal information about a product Trimble was developing for\nmobile devices.\n\nAbout a week before the Justice Department announced its charges, Boyusec was deregistered from a Chinese government-run database, suggesting the company had been\ndissolved.\n\n\"Boyusec disappeared into the shadows without making any effort to contact us or to refute\nany of the conclusions of our analysis,\" Intrusion Truth wrote at the time. “These were not\nthe actions of innocent individuals.”\n\nIt was proof, Intrusion Truth said, that “one of the biggest hacking threats to Western\ncompanies” could be “completely silenced by shining a light on its activities and exposing the\nidentities of those behind the group to the world.”\n\nBut Danowski, who gave a presentation about Intrusion Truth last year at the Cyberwarcon\nconference in Washington, DC, expresses doubt that Boyusec disappeared altogether. She\ntold Zero Day that she found job advertisements for the company in February 2018, two\nmonths after the indictments, and believes the company may have simply begun to keep a\nlower profile.\n\nIntrusion Truth @intrusion_truth\n\nWe told you so! @TheJusticeDept and @NCSC have confirmed Intrusion Truth's conclusion\nthat the Chinese MSS is behind #APT10. Two down...\nJustice Department @TheJusticeDept\n\nTwo Chinese Hackers Associated With the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global\nComputer Intrusion Campaigns Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business\nInformation https://t.co/bRQPQE02Dx https://t.co/jz7Dzy6ExR\nDecember 21st 2018\n\n17 Retweets24 Likes\n**Take Two: Exposing APT 10**\n\nIntrusion Truth went silent for a year after its reports about APT 3. When the group published\nagain in August 2018, it was to expose individuals and companies involved in a different\nChinese hacking group, APT 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT 10 has been blamed for Operation Cloud Hopper, a series of intrusions into more than\n45 tech companies and IT managed service providers, and for stealing hundreds of\ngigabytes of sensitive data across multiple industries — tech, aviation, space and satellite,\nmanufacturing, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, and communications.\n\nIntrusion Truth connected APT 10 to a [regional office of the MSS in Tianjin and to three](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\nChinese nationals — Zheng Yanbin, Gao Qiang and Zhang Shilong. Zhang, they said,\nworked for a shell company in Tianjin called Huaying Haitai Science and Technology\nDevelopment that conducted the APT 10 hacking operations.\n\n[Four months after identifying the men, the Justice Department indicted Zhang, citing his](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n[connection to Huaying Haitai, and two years later, the European Union announced sanctions](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3095555/european-union-hits-chinese-hackers-sanctions)\nagainst Gao Qiang, Zhang Shilong and Huaying Haitai — the first EU sanctions for cyberespionage.\n\nIntrusion Truth’s posts since then have exposed other APT groups and have also revealed a\ndistinct pattern in how the MSS operates. The spy agency first tasks a regional MSS office in\nplaces like Tianjin and Guangdong with forming shell companies or co-opting existing tech or\nsecurity firms. Then the companies recruit civilian hackers, usually from local universities.\n\nOften the shell companies are easy to spot because they have little presence on the internet\nand share the same contact information or office address in job listings. One company\napparently used a computer security professor — a former member of the PLA according to\nIntrusion Truth — to recruit hackers and acquire new tools and techniques. Someone\nclaiming to be a student of the professor wrote online that the teacher was looking to pay the\nequivalent of $30,000-$76,000 to anyone with innovative ways to crack passwords. “Believe\nit or not,” the student wrote, “our teacher has a lot of money.”\n\nPrice list for stolen data that Intrusion Truth says APT\n\n17 circulated in hacker forums.\nIn shifting hacking operations from the PLA to the MSS, China might have thought it gained\nplausible deniability for its operations, but it also learned that there are potential drawbacks\nto using civilian hackers for state-run operations: they can be less disciplined and\ncontrollable than military-trained hackers and may engage in the occasional side hustle.\nAccording to a DoJ indictment, Gao Li allegedly attempted to extort one espionage victim in\n2017, demanding $15,000 in cryptocurrency to not leak data stolen from them. Intrusion\nTruth also says members of another group, APT 17, allegedly circulated a price list in hacker\n\n\n-----\n\nforums for data it swiped from Western and China-based hacking targets. Some APT groups\nhave even re-used state-sponsored malware to steal virtual currencies and tokens in video\ngames.\n\nBut the biggest drawback to using civilian hackers might be their lack of commitment to\nseparating work life from personal life. Intrusion Truth was able to identify many of the APT\nhackers because of their re-use of email addresses for professional and personal purposes.\nAn MSS officer named Zhao Jianfei was identified because he sent zero-day exploits to two\nindicted hackers using the same email address he used to receive credit card statements\nfrom the Bank of China. He also used a variation of that email address as his user name on\nFacebook, according to Intrusion Truth.\n\n**On the Hunt**\n\nIntrusion Truth’s investigations begin in a number of ways but usually they start with a tip\nfrom a reader or with an email address published in reports written by security firms.\n\n“We receive tips on a weekly basis from around the world on Chinese cyber activity and the\nactors suspected of being behind it,” the group says.\n\nThe group then uses a variety of methods to track targets, including sifting through data\nstolen from Chinese companies and leaked online. A leak of usernames from the Tencent\nWeibo QQ instant messaging service aided a couple of investigations, and in another case a\n[handy list of public toilets helped them identify the address of an intelligence agency office in](https://discord.gg/2hRRuFNg)\nHainan.\n\n“[T]he Chinese internet is huge and awash with lots of information which can help our\ninvestigations,” Intrusion Truth told Zero Day. “Accessing it is easier than most people think.\nThe more you dig behind the Chinese firewall, the more you find.”\n\nIntrusion Truth, or a member of its network, appears to be fluent in Mandarin and has a\npracticed ability to dig deeply into Chinese-language university sites, hacking forums and\nsocial media accounts to uncover resumes, academic papers, wedding photos, email\naddresses and online aliases.\n\nBut although most of the information Intrusion Truth uses is open source, some evidence\nappears to come from non-public sources. In one case, they were able to determine that two\nindividuals working for different companies were associates after a “source with access to\nsuch information” provided information revealing the two men had sat next to each other on\nthree flights in 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\nUber receipt for a rider named “Qiang,” which Intrusion Truth\n\nsays is Gao Qiang, whom they believe works for the MSS.\nIn another case, they obtained Uber receipts purporting to show their target commuting to\nand from an MSS building.\n\nThe investigation began with an email address — zhengyanbin8@gmail.com — that had\nbeen used to register domains for APT 10 operations. Intrusion Truth pulled threads for a\nyear collaborating with unnamed threat intelligence analysts, which led them to identify three\nindividuals — Gao Qiang, Zheng Yanbin, and Zhang Shilong.\n\n[They were able to connect Gao Qiang to the MSS through the Uber receipts. One receipt, for](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\na user named “Qiang,” showed the rider traveling from the headquarters of the Tianjin State\nSecurity Bureau — an arm of the MSS — to a residential neighborhood. A second Uber\nreceipt showed the same user, named Pig this time but using the same email address,\ntraveling repeatedly between the two locations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntrusion Truth posted this image, which it says\n\nshows “MSS Officer 1.” Zero Day blurred the faces.\n[Research into the identity of a different MSS officer was aided by credit card statements that](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/05/13/who-is-mr-zhao/)\nIntrusion Truth says came from a source connected to the Bank of China. The investigation\n[began when the Justice Department indicted two Chinese hackers in July 2020 for allegedly](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nstealing hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property from companies, including\nones conducting COVID-19 research and testing. The Justice Department mentioned an\nintelligence officer — MSS Officer 1 — who it said was affiliated with the Guangdong State\nSecurity Department (GSSD), a branch of the MSS in Guangdong.\n\nIntrusion Truth set out to identify the officer using two clues: the address for a research\nfacility that the indictment said was a shell company for the GSSD, and an email address\nused by MSS Officer 1 to [send zero-day exploits to the two indicted hackers. The second](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1295981/download)\nhalf of the email address was redacted in an FBI alert, but it began with “asls1027”.\n\nFBI alert showing email address\n\nIntrusion Truth used to unmask MSS Officer 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe address for the research facility was on Upper Nonglin Road in Guangdong, so Intrusion\nTruth asked its network of contributors for anything related to the address. A “trusted source\nwith connections to the Bank of China” produced credit card statements that were\npurportedly sent by the bank to a person named Zhao Jianfei at the research facility’s\naddress. A second bank statement was emailed to asls1027@hotmail.com.\n\nIn another investigation that also began with an email address — dxy0015@163.com —\nIntrusion Truth was able to connect the address to Ding Xiaoyang, an intelligence officer\noverseeing APT 40 operations, after someone in its network of collaborators accessed a\nfrequent flyer account tied to that email. The email address had evidently been among stolen\ncredentials that hackers had leaked online, and Intrusion Truth’s collaborator evidently used\nthe credential to gain unauthorized access to Ding's account and learn his name.\n\nIntrusion Truth taunted Ding in their post. \"Our thanks…go out to Mr Ding for not changing\nhis password after it had been leaked online.”\n\nIntrusion Truth isn’t clear about who gained access to the account, but ordinarily this would\nbe illegal in the U.S. if not done by law enforcement, and it’s generally not condoned by the\nsecurity community.\n\n“We are bound by U.S. laws,” says Ben Read, director of cyber-espionage analysis at the\nsecurity firm Mandiant, who says his company would not access accounts using leaked\ncredentials. But he says others in the community might consider this “a gray area.”\n\nCritics say that without oversight, there's a risk that Intrusion Truth could identify the wrong\nperson. But the group said it takes care to corroborate tips supplied to it and to get the facts\nright.\n\n“We are rigorous in our verification of information,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “We\nalways publish in good conscience, knowing that we have tried our best to make sure we are\nrevealing ‘the whole truth.’”\n\nThe person also pointed out that their work “is often independently corroborated by other\nthreat hunters” after they publish their findings, such as Recorded Future did in 2017.\n\nBut there are questions about whether such corroborations are truly independent. The\nIntrusion Truth spokesperson noted that some of the people who assist with the group’s\ninvestigations are anonymous. It’s possible then that some of these people also work for\ncompanies that have subsequently corroborated Intrusion Truth’s findings, making it only\nappear that the companies reached the same conclusion about a hacker’s identity\nindependent from Intrusion Truth.\n\n**How Effective is Intrusion Truth’s Work?**\n\n\n-----\n\nLittle happens to China-based hackers who get publicly identified. Those who are sanctioned\nmight suffer financial setbacks, and those who are indicted might feel restrictions against\ntravel, but as long as they don’t travel to or through countries with extradition agreements\nwith the U.S., they don’t have to worry about being nabbed by law enforcement.\n\nWhether simply naming and shaming hackers is effective is open to debate.\n\nA former U.S. national security official, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely\nabout the issue, said there’s value in outing people who aren’t indicted.\n\n“You may not have enough evidence to bring charges, but you want to undermine their ability\nto operate — in the same way you kick spies out of the U.S.,” he told Zero Day. “We do that\npublicly to embarrass the other nation and to call out that we know who your spies are.”\n\nThe Recorded Future analyst who asked to remain anonymous says the revelations are\nvaluable because they get people talking about the problem of economic espionage. He also\nsays he has learned information from Intrusion Truth that he didn’t know before. “We\ncertainly have used it to our advantage to help identify and track some activity,” he says.\n\nBut Mandiant’s Read says that while the information can contribute to a big-picture\nunderstanding of the threats, it doesn’t really help security teams defend networks, and it’s\nnot going to stop hackers in China from stealing intellectual property. It does, however, put\nthem on notice that they might get caught “and people will know” what they did, he notes.\nThis, at the very least, can impose cost on them — that is, force them to expend more effort\nto conceal their identity.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, says the shock\nof being publicly outed used to be more effective years ago when he did it with a member of\na Chinese hacking group called Night Dragon in 2011 while working as vice president of\nthreat research for the security firm McAfee. But it’s become less effective over time.\nAlperovitch didn’t name the person in China in 2011, but he did name the city where the\nperson was based and revealed that he owned a hosting company. He also quoted a line\nfrom the company's marketing literature that would have left the owner little doubt that the\ndescription was referring to him.\n\n“When [these exposures first occurred] the adversaries were not expecting them, and they\nwere in huge shock,'“ he says. “I think it did have an effect of ‘Oh my god, somehow they\ndiscovered us. But I think as they’ve seen over the years that nothing really happens to them\n\n[after being exposed], it becomes probably more of a badge of honor.”\n\nNonetheless, there could be value in making state-sponsored hackers think twice about their\nability to travel freely outside China. And the exposure of one hacker can potentially lead\nothers to make different life choices.\n\n\n-----\n\nChinese hackers do have a choice about their occupation, Intrusion Truth notes. There is a\nbooming tech industry in China — and around the world — where these hackers could really\nput their skills to better use.”\n\nThe group says it has no plans to slow down and is already lining up new revelations to\nrelease this year.\n\n“[W]e’re currently working collaboratively with a couple of members of our community on an\ninvestigation to try and identify a long-standing Chinese hacker…. We will see how\nsuccessful we are.”\n\n_To read a complete interview with Intrusion Truth, go to:_\n\n[Intrusion Truth: Five Years of Naming and Shaming China’s Spies](https://zetter.substack.com/p/interview-with-intrusion-truth)\n\n**See Also:**\n\n[When Russia Helped the U.S. Nab Cybercriminals](https://zetter.substack.com/p/when-russia-helped-the-us-nab-cybercriminals?s=w)\n\n[Former NSA Hacker Describes Being Recruited for UAE Spy Program](https://zetter.substack.com/p/former-nsa-hacker-describes-being?s=w)\n\n[The Spy Story that Spun a Tangled Web](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was?s=w)\n\n\n-----",
