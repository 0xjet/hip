The report focuses\non recommendations for mitigating risks and improving\ncloud security for cloud security leaders and practitioners.\nThe report is informed by Google Threat Intelligence Group\n(GTIG), Mandiant, Google Cloud’s Office of the CISO,\nProduct Security Engineering, and various Google Cloud\nintelligence, security, and product teams.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Executive Summary\n\n## Evolving Ransomware and Data Theft Risks in the Cloud\n\n\nCloud environments are facing an evolving threat from\nthreat actors prioritizing data exfiltration, exploiting\nidentity as the new perimeter, and adapting tactics to\nevade detection and attribution. This iteration of the\nGoogle Cloud Threat Horizons Report provides cloud\nsecurity professionals with a deeper understanding\nof the threat with intelligence and actionable risk\nmitigations from Google’s security experts.\n\nRansomware and data threats in the cloud are\nnot new. In Feb. 2024, Google Cloud security and\n[intelligence experts exposed trends in the Threat](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/threat_horizons_report_h12024.pdf)\n[Horizons Report, including threat actors prioritizing](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/threat_horizons_report_h12024.pdf)\ndata exfiltration over encryption and exploiting\nserver-side vulnerabilities. Further, our experts cited\nransomware and data theft incidents or associated\n[risks in cloud environments in our ten previous Threat](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/security/leaders?e=48754805&hl=en)\nHorizons Reports.\n\nDespite the ongoing presence of ransomware and\ndata theft risks, the trends we observed in the last\nhalf of 2024 reveal a concerning shift. Threat actors\nare not only refining their tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) within cloud environments, but\nthey are also becoming more adept at obscuring their\nidentities. This evolution makes it harder for defenders\nto counter their attacks and increases the likelihood\nof ransom payments.\n\n\nRecognizing our shared fate in defending against\nevolving cloud threats, this Google Cloud Threat\nHorizons Report delivers timely analysis and\nactionable mitigations for the recent ransomware\nand data theft trends that our security and threat\nintelligence experts have identified and are disrupting\nin the current threat landscape:\n\n**• Risks to service accounts: Google Cloud research**\n\nshows that over-privileged service accounts\nand lateral movement tactics are increasingly\nsignificant threats, even though credential and\nmisconfiguration issues remain common for initial\naccess.\n\n**• Identity exploitation: Compromised user identities**\n\nin hybrid environments can lead to persistent\naccess and lateral movement between on-premises\nand cloud environments, subsequently resulting in\nmultifaceted extortion.\n\n**• Cloud databases are under attack: Threat actors**\n\nare actively exploiting vulnerabilities and weak\ncredentials to access sensitive information.\n\n**• Increased adaptability: Threat actors are**\n\nleveraging Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\nofferings and adjusting tactics to evade detection\nand attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n**• Diversified attack methods: A threat actor group**\n\nwe track as TRIPLESTRENGTH uses privilege\nescalation, including charging against victim billing\naccounts to maximize profits from compromised\naccounts.\n\n**• Threat actors are using increasingly**\n\n**sophisticated tactics to steal data and extort**\n**organizations in the cloud: Threat actors are**\nusing multifactor authentication (MFA) bypass in\ncloud-based services to compromise accounts and\naggressive communication strategies with victims\nto maximize their profits.\n\n\nTo stay ahead of the curve in 2025, a robust cloud\nsecurity strategy must prioritize data exfiltration and\nidentity protection. The following content provides\ncloud security decision-makers with the latest\nintelligence on threat actor tactics and actionable\nmitigations to better inform cloud data security\nstrategies.\n\n\n-----\n\n## New Data Points to Threat Actors Increasingly Exploiting Overprivileged Service Accounts to Move Laterally\n\n\nNew Google Cloud research highlights that threat\nactors are shifting focus. Instead of solely focusing\non stealing user login information and exploiting\nmisconfigurations to gain initial entry, they are\nnow targeting overprivileged service accounts, or\naccounts that have more privileges than necessary.\nBy exploiting these accounts, actors can more easily\nmove laterally within an organization’s systems,\npotentially causing more damage from their intrusions.\nThis research shares key internal cloud risk factors\nthat make organizations more susceptible to these\nattacks.\n\n###### Figure 1: Cloud Risk Alerts Detected H2 2024\n\n\n#### Looking At Organizational Cloud Risks and Alerts\n\nIn H2 2024, Google Cloud extended our research\nfocus to include instances where organizations\ninadvertently neglect critical risks and thus provide\nthreat actors new avenues for exploitation. Our data\non flagged instances of insecurity in organizations\n(Fig. 1) and subsequent analysis indicates that service\naccount keys need further attention.\n\n\n-----\n\nNearly half (46.4%) of the observed security alerts\nwere due to overprivileged service accounts. We\nalso saw a notably high percentage of alerts (10.3%)\nfrom service account keys being leveraged in an\nunexpected location, which suggests a possible\nhigh false-positive activity, including events such as\ntraveling employees, shifts in computing resources, or\nother mundane causes.\n\nThe takeaway of organizational cloud risk alert data\npoints to the need for organizations to investigate\nand protect service accounts so they can prevent\nexploitation of overprivileged accounts and reduce\ndetection noise from false positives.\n\n\nDuring H2 2024, credential-related vulnerabilities\nlike weak or no passwords continued to be the most\ncommon entry point for attackers as shown in\nFig. 3, though the frequency decreased slightly\nthrough 2024 (Fig. 2). Misconfiguration of cloud\nenvironments (services or software) remained a\nsignificant security gap.\n\n\n#### How Threat Actors Get In: Credentials and Misconfiguration\n\nLooking over a two year period, data for threat actor\ninitial access trends remained largely consistent,\nmirroring observations from previous periods, as\nillustrated by the lower three lines in Fig. 2.\n\n\n###### Figure 2: Initial Access Vectors of Concern 2022-2024\n\n**60**\n\n\n**40**\n\n**20**\n\n\n**0**\n\n10/1/2022 1/1/2023 4/1/2023 7/1/2023 10/1/2023 1/1/2024 4/1/2024\n\n\n**Time**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 3: Initial Access Vectors of Concern H2 2024\n\nSoftware issue\n\n**2.9%**\n\nAPI/UI compromise\n\n**17.1%**\n\n\nMisconfiguration\n\n\nWe also observed a new trend in the second half of\n2024: a sharp rise in compromised APIs and UIs due\nto threat actor targeting. These attacks accounted\nfor 17.1% of observed incidents, a substantial increase\nfrom the approximately 13% observed in the first half\nof 2024. This upward trend in API/UI exploits reflects a\n\npersistent and longstanding security concern cited in\n\n\n[previous Google Threat Horizons Reports, highlighting](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/security/leaders?e=48754805&hl=en)\nthe need for organizations to bolster security\nmeasures specifically designed to protect against\nunintentionally exposed APIs and UIs. Google Cloud\n[offers Advanced API Security to address this risk.](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-security#:~:text=Advanced%20API%20Security%20continually%20monitors,you%20decide%20to%20do%20so.)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Post-Initial Access Efforts: Lateral Movement Dominates\n\nNew data also reveals valuable insights into the\nactions threat actors take once they’ve gained access\nto an organization’s systems, as illustrated in Fig. 4.\n\nMore than half (62.2%) of threat actor movements\nonce they gained access involved attempting lateral\nmovement within an environment and downloading\ntools designed for this purpose. To help address\nthe need for effective detective controls capable of\nidentifying and remediating lateral movement on cloud\n\n\nassets, Google Cloud Security Command Center offers\n[customers Event Threat Detection in the Premium tier.](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-event-threat-detection-overview#:~:text=Event%20Threat%20Detection%20is%20a,emerging%20threats%20at%20cloud%20scale.)\n\nWe also saw a significant trend in threat actors\nsearching for insecure private keys (13.7%), reinforcing\nthe need for organizations to prioritize the security\nand proper management of private keys. Access\ntoken manipulation also appeared often enough to be\nnotable (11.3%), highlighting the ongoing importance\nof Identity and Access Management (IAM) as a critical\nsecurity focus area.\n\n\n###### Figure 4: Observed Impact of Intrusions H2 2024\n\nDropped installer\n\n**4.2%**\n\nScanning\n\n**4.2%**\n\nCreation/Deletion cloud instances\n\n**4.4%**\n\nAccess token\n\n**11.3%**\n\nPrivate key targeting\n\n**13.7%**\n\n\nLateral movement\nattempt\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nWe recommend the following risk mitigations to\nenhance your Google Cloud security posture to help\nprotect against threats to service accounts:\n\n**• Reduce service account key risk: Consider**\n\n[alternative solutions to using service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#auth-decision-tree)\n[to reduce this attack surface. When they cannot](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/migrate-from-service-account-keys)\n[be removed, review best practices for managing](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-managing-service-account-keys)\nservice account keys.\n\n**• Restrict service account key creation: Use**\n\norganization policies to restrict service account\nkey creation and limit the roles assigned to service\n[accounts. Google Cloud restricts creation by](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/secure-by-default-organizations)\ndefault for new customer organizations created\nafter May 2024.\n\n\n\n**• Optimize identity and access management**\n\n**(IAM) policies: Ensure only necessary services**\nhave access to critical assets, and regularly review\nIAM policies to apply the principle of least privilege.\n[Consider using IAM Recommender to help navigate](https://cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview)\nproper permissioning for roles.\n\n**• Enhance internal threat monitoring: Reinvigorate**\n\nlateral movement detection technologies and\npolicies for internal-facing sensors.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Boundary of Identity\n\n\nAs organizations expand the cyber boundary to cover\na hybrid plane of on-premises, multi-cloud, and\nmulti-Software as a Service-based applications, the\ncommon “boundary” has shifted from the network\nperimeter to the identity plane. With the expansion to\n[cloud, the scope of what represents an “identity”](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/user-identities)\nhas also expanded, including managed identities\n(typically associated with human interaction\nto resources) and identities associated with\nworkloads (including programmatic/automated\ninteraction). Without proper controls and processes,\na single compromised identity could cause a\ndisproportionately impactful cyber event, including\ndata theft and/or ransomware deployment, causing\nsignificant damage to organizations.\n\n#### Identity Threats\n\nIdentity compromise is no longer limited to password\n[theft based upon misconfigurations or weak](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/threat_horizons_report_h2_2024.pdf)\n[passwords. Threat actors are now gaining access](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/threat_horizons_report_h2_2024.pdf)\nby intercepting or stealing post-authenticated\n\ntokens or cookies, effectively bypassing traditional\nauthentication criteria. The most common methods\nof identity compromise include brute-forcing using\ncommon/guessable passwords, replaying stolen\ncredentials from a previous breach, credential\nstuffing, phishing, and social engineering.\n\n\nOrganizations have responded to these growing\nthreats by enhancing authentication requirements\nlike enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), but\nthreat actors continue to adapt their techniques by\ninvoking SIM swapping, MFA fatigue (push/text-based\nnotifications), Adversary in the Middle (AitM) attacks,\nand targeted social engineering—masquerading as a\ntrusted resource to convince someone to provide MFA\ncodes or accept an MFA validation prompt.\n\nA single stolen credential can initiate a chain reaction,\ngranting attackers access to applications and data,\nboth on-premises and in the cloud. This access can\nbe further exploited to compromise infrastructure\nthrough remote access services, manipulate MFA, and\nestablish a trusted presence for subsequent social\nengineering attacks. Stolen credentials can also be\nused to register malicious applications for persistent\naccess to communication platforms, or to obtain longlived credentials like access keys and certificates,\nfurther solidifying a foothold. Ultimately, an initial\ncredential compromise can enable attackers to pivot\nacross on-premises or cloud infrastructure, escalate\nprivileges, and establish persistence, resulting in\nstolen data, extortion, and destructive activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nTo protect against the impact of attacks on the\nidentity plane, organizations must level up their\nauthentication processes and playbooks for\nresponding to threats in the following ways:\n\n**Combine strong authentication with attribute-**\n**based validation: The authentication process should**\nnot be based on a single identity attribute like a\npassword. Rather, organizations should shift towards\nthe concept of a positive identity transaction,\nwhich requires strong authentication (e.g., phishing\n\n###### Figure 5: Positive Identity Transaction\n\n\nresistant MFA methods, passwordless) combined with\nattribute-based validation (Fig. 5), which may include:\n\n- Geo-verification for where the authentication\n\nrequest was initiated\n\n- Identity risk reviews and verification (suspicious\n\nlogins, leaked credentials, atypical travel, recent\nchanges to identity attributes following a large\nscope of access attempts)\n\n- Time-based access enforcement (Just-in-Time) or\n\npredefined session durations based upon sensitivity\nof what is being accessed\n\n- Device state review and verification (pre-defined\n\nattributes, trusted health status)\n\n\nPassphrase (Password) + MFA Method (Device) + Contextual Information =\n**Positive Identity Transaction**\n\n**Authenticate** **Validate**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comprehensive identity incident response:**\nIn addition to fortifying authentication processes,\norganizations must also modernize playbooks and\nprocesses for proper containment and remediation for\nidentities, which may include:\n\n[• Enforcing mandatory MFA for an account if not](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/mandatory-mfa-is-coming-to-google-cloud-heres-what-you-need-to-know)\n\nalready configured\n\n- Disabling and rotating credentials for an account\n\n- Revoking access tokens within the identity provider\n\n(IdP)/cloud platform(s)/accessible application(s)\n\n- Revoking cookies for authenticated identities within\n\napplications\n\n\n\n- Reviewing, revoking, and regenerating\n\nprogrammatic/long-lived identities (access keys/\ncertificates)\n\n- Reviewing registered devices associated with\n\ncompromised identities, and revoking any devices\nwhich are unauthorized/recently added\n\n- Reviewing enforced MFA methods associated with\n\ncompromised identities, and removing any methods\nthat are weak or subject to MFA bypass techniques\n\n- Reviewing and revoking (credentials/access) for\n\nany newly registered applications associated with a\ncompromised identity\n\n\n-----\n\n## Database Security: Critical Cloud Protection\n\n\nThreat actors are increasingly targeting identities\nand databases, exploiting misconfigurations and\nvulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information\n\nand resources. Insecure databases containing critical\n\nbusiness data and personally identifiable information\n(PII) are particularly attractive targets. Once inside,\nattackers can leverage compromised credentials\nto move laterally and access potentially even more\nvaluable data, which may lead to additional attack\npaths with accesses that may contain even more\nvaluable information.\n\nOur Google Cloud experts observed this\npattern, wherein the same group repeatedly\ntargets environments using a combination of\nauthentication attacks and exploitation of software\nvulnerabilities. The objective remains consistent:\ngaining unauthorized access to the underlying\ncloud infrastructure to conduct follow-on malicious\nactivities. Threat actors often automate the process\nof scanning and identifying vulnerable databases.\nThey scan for open ports, weak passwords, and\nother misconfigurations. Once they compile a list\nof potential targets, they sort and prioritize a target\nlist based on perceived ease of exploitation and\npotential return on investment (ROI). These threat\nactors operate with exceptional speed, exploiting\nvulnerabilities within their ‘n-day’ window and\ncapitalizing on older, unpatched vulnerabilities before\nremediation can occur.\n\n\nThis article examines a large-scale campaign by\nthreat actors that used a layered initial access method\nand exploited password spraying, misconfigurations,\n\nand brute-forcing. Our analysis of these tactics,\n\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) reveals how\nprevalent the risk is across all cloud providers.\n\n#### The Convergence of Threats\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we observed\na widespread campaign where a group of threat\nactors used Kinsing malware, also known as H2Miner,\nto target publicly exposed PostgreSQL databases.\nNotably, these threat actors typically deploy the\nKinsing malware on compromised cloud resources.\nThe group demonstrated increasing sophistication\nin their TTPs, specifically around maximizing illicit\nprofits by targeting Monero—a decentralized privacyfocused cryptocurrency that uses cryptographic\ntechniques to mask user identities and transaction\n\ndetails—rather than other cryptocurrencies. The\ngroup’s use of a cronjob with a backup command and\ncontrol (C2) server highlights their focus on ensuring\npersistent access and evading detection. They then\ntargeted insecure PostgreSQL databases, achieving\ninitial access through brute-forcing weak credentials.\n\nTargeting Monero is indicative of the group’s diverse\ncapabilities, expanding its toolset to conduct more\ncomplex operations. The choice to target a privacycentric cryptocurrency may suggest a deliberate\n\n\n-----\n\nintent to obfuscate financial transactions and further\nevade detection. This intentional targeting of privacyenhanced technologies, combined with other TTPs,\nsignals a higher level of operational security and\ntechnical expertise on the part of the threat actor.\nThis pattern of persistence mirrors tactics observed in\nprevious attacks on Apache Solr instances, specifically\nthe creation of a new cronjob linked to a secondary\nC2 server. The tactic is suggestive of the operator’s\nfamiliarity with techniques used to target this specific\nsoftware or a broader campaign impacting multiple\nsystems. By tracking this campaign, we discovered\nadditional compromised servers beyond the initially\ncompromised databases.\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nGoogle Cloud offers a variety of services and\nproducts to help ensure the security and integrity of\nmanaged databases. Recommendations include:\n\n**• Secure private connections: If you must use a**\n\n[private IP with Cloud SQL, configure authorized](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip)\nnetworks on the SQL instance to restrict access.\n\n**• Enable logging & monitoring: Detecting brute-**\n\nforce attacks requires monitoring failed login\n\n[attempts, which Cloud Monitoring can help with by](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/monitoring-overview)\nfocusing on log-based metrics and alerts. Enable\n[Database Audit Logs within Cloud SQL and MySQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/audit-logging)\n[Audit Logs for your Cloud SQL instance to track](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/audit-logging)\nadministrative access and system changes to\ncomplement database logs which may not capture\n[individual failed login attempts. Cloud Logging can](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/overview)\nalso help by collecting and analyzing logs from\n\n\nCloud SQL for PostgreSQL instances on database\nactivity, user access, and more. Additionally, the\n‘pgAudit’ extension could be configured to log\nfailed PostgreSQL attempts.\n\n**• Use robust Identity and Access Management**\n\n**(IAM):** [Google Cloud IAM provides comprehensive](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/iam-authentication)\n[IAM controls, including PostgreSQL auth proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-ip)\nfor secure authentication and authorization. This\nfeature centralizes resource control and minimizes\nunauthorized data access by authenticating users\nthrough IAM, reducing password leakage risks.\n\n**• Proactively approach vulnerability**\n\n**management:** [Google Cloud SQL security](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/proactive-database-wellness-with-active-assist)\n[recommenders automatically monitor your](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/proactive-database-wellness-with-active-assist)\ndatabases for vulnerabilities like public IP access,\nmissing patches, and unencrypted connections.\nThese timely alerts and actionable remediation\nsteps can help prevent incidents by ensuring your\ndatabases are always protected.\n\n**• Enhance data protection with Virtual Private**\n\n**[Cloud (VPC) service controls: Google Cloud VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview)**\n[Service Controls enable data exfiltration protection](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview)\nand allow list management which controls access\nto your Google Cloud resources within a perimeter.\n[Think Outside the Perimeter: Bug Hunting in Google](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6662747743191040/think-outside-the-perimeter-bug-hunting-in-google-cloud-s-vpc-service-controls)\n[Cloud’s VPC Service Controls offers insights on the](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6662747743191040/think-outside-the-perimeter-bug-hunting-in-google-cloud-s-vpc-service-controls)\nGoogle Cloud Vulnerability Reward Program.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Actor Spotlight: UNC2165 Ransomware and Data Theft Extortion\n\n\nUNC2165 is a set of financially motivated threat\nactor activity dating to at least 2019 that abuses\ncloud services to host data exfiltrated from victim\nenvironments. The threat actors behind this activity\nhave shifted to using new ransomware families over\n[time, likely in response to sanctions and their desire](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845)\nto hinder attribution efforts by security defenders.\n[UNC2165 has notable similarities to operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions)\npublicly attributed to Evil Corp, including a heavy\nreliance on FAKEUPDATES infections to obtain initial\naccess to victims and overlaps in their infrastructure,\nand use of particular ransomware families. UNC2165\nhas impacted nearly every industry, including\nhealthcare, retail, construction, engineering, legal and\nprofessional services, with victims located in North\nAmerica, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East,\naccording to Mandiant.\n\n#### Threat Actors Abusing Cloud Storage Services to Host Data Exfiltrated from Victim Environments\n\nBeginning in December 2023, UNC2165 resumed their\nintrusion operations after a period of dormancy dating\nback to April 2023. UNC2165 has almost exclusively\nobtained initial access to victims’ networks from\nUNC1543, financially motivated threat actors that\nhave distributed FAKEUPDATES since at least April\n\n\n2018. Consistent with previous campaigns, UNC2165\nleveraged UNC1543 distribution channels, involving\nsearch engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and\nFAKEUPDATES, to deliver the COLORFAKE.V2 inmemory dropper and MYTHIC payloads. Historically,\nUNC2165 operations heavily relied on BEACON for\nlateral movement and to maintain access to the victim\nenvironment. However, as of late 2023, UNC2165 has\nused the MYTHIC post-exploitation framework in\nintrusions.\n\nIn one incident, a user who visited a legitimate website\nwas redirected to a malicious website that led to a\ndrive-by download of an UNC1543 FAKEUPDATES\npayload. After obtaining access to a victim network\nfrom the FAKEUPDATES infection, UNC2165 deployed\nMYTHIC to establish a foothold. UNC2165 performed\nreconnaissance using built-in Microsoft Windows\nutilities and leveraged RDP for lateral movement to\nconnect to an on-premises file server. UNC2165 then\nused Rclone to exfiltrate data to an attacker-owned\nAzure blob storage before deploying RANSOMHUB\nransomware. Threat actors commonly use the\nRclone utility to synchronize files with cloud storage\nproviders. Mandiant also observed UNC2165 access\nthe victim’s cloud-based data backup instance where\nthey deleted backup routines, deleted existing data\nand backups, and modified user permissions to hinder\nresponse and recovery efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a separate incident in 2024, UNC2165 gained\naccess to a victim environment via an UNC1543\nFAKEUPDATES infection, then deployed their Python\ntunneler, VIPERTUNNEL to maintain presence in the\nenvironment, and executed a series of utility scripts\nto perform reconnaissance and disable anti-virus\nprotection (Fig. 6). UNC2165 then accessed the\nvictim’s Azure blob storage and directly copied data\nto multiple attacker-owned cloud-based servers.\nHaving successfully exfiltrated sensitive data,\nUNC2165 moved on to the disruptive phase of their\noperation leveraging Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to\ndeploy malicious scheduled tasks which subsequently\nexecuted RANSOMHUB on Windows systems in the\n\n\nvictim’s on-premise environment. UNC2165 also\ndeployed an Azure run command to execute a bash\nscript on Linux systems hosted in Azure to download\nand execute a sample of the Linux variant of\nRANSOMHUB ransomware.\n\n#### Threat Actors Demonstrate Adaptability with New Ransomware\n\nMandiant has observed UNC2165 evolve their use\n\nand adoption of new ransomware families in their\noperations, including HADES, LOCKBIT, CONTI, and\nRANSOMHUB (Fig. 7). ​Based on the overlaps between\nUNC2165 and Evil Corp, Mandiant assesses with\n\n\n###### Figure 6: UNC2165 Attack Lifecycle in Observed Intrusions Leading to RANSOMHUB Deployment\n\nMaintain Presence Move Laterally\n\nInitial Compromise Establish Foothold Complete Mission\n\nEscalate Privilege Internal Reconnaisance\n\n\nInitial Establish\nCompromise Foothold\n\n- UNC1543 - MYTHIC\nFAKEUPDATES\ninfection\n\n\n\n- MIMIKATZ\n\n- Kerberoasting\nattacks\n\n\nEscalate Internal Move Maintain\nPrivilege Reconnaissance Laterally Presence\n\n\n\n- Datamine files\n\n- Built-in Microsoft\nWindows utilities\n\n- Utility scripts\n\n\n�RDP\n\n- MYTHIC\n\n\n�VIPERTUNNEL\n\n�SSH\n\n\nComplete\nMission\n\n- Data theft\n– Rclone to exfiltrate data to\nattacker-owned Azure blob\nstorage\n– Copy data from victim’s\ncloud storage to\nattacker-owned\ncloud-based servers\n\n- GPO and batch scripts to\ndeploy RANSOMHUB\nransomware\n\n- Tamper with cloud-based\ndata backup service\n\n- Disable anti-virus protection\n\n\n-----\n\nhigh confidence that actors affiliated with UNC2165\nhave shifted away from using exclusive ransomware\nvariants and instead are employing well-known\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings in their\noperations, likely for the purposes of hindering\nattribution efforts in order to evade sanctions.\n\nUNC2165 shifted from the use of HADES, a private\nransomware family, to LOCKBIT in October 2021.\nFollowing the LOCKBIT disruption in February 2024,\nUNC2165 briefly leveraged CONTI—almost certainly\n\n\nfrom the leaked CONTI source code—before shifting\nto deploying RANSOMHUB by April 2024. Frequent\ncode updates and rebranding of HADES required\ndevelopment resources. It is plausible that UNC2165\nsaw the use of LOCKBIT as a more cost-effective\nchoice as it would eliminate the ransomware\ndevelopment time and effort allowing resources to\nbe used elsewhere, such as broadening ransomware\ndeployment operations.\n\n\n###### Figure 7: UNC2165 Ransomware Observation Timeline\n\n|Col1|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|HADES HADES.PHOENIXLOCKER HADES.PAYLOADBIN LOCKBIT CONTI RANSOMHUB||||||\n\n\n-----\n\nBy using common RaaS offerings, UNC2165 effectively\nobscures their identity and increases the likelihood\nof receiving ransom payments. A victim would need\nvisibility into earlier stages of the attack lifecycle\nto properly attribute the activity, compared to prior\nUNC2165 operations that could be attributable based\non the use of an exclusive ransomware family. Given\nthe sanctions against Evil Corp, victims might be\nhesitant to pay a ransom if they suspected actors\nassociated with Evil Corp were behind the attack, as\ndoing so could have legal repercussions.\n\nMandiant has observed recent changes in the\nransomware landscape, pointing to the likelihood\nthat at least some actors who previously leveraged\nLOCKBIT, including UNC2165, have shifted to other\n\n\nransomware offerings, such as RANSOMHUB. Notably,\nin Q3 2024, RANSOMHUB displaced LOCKBIT as\nthe most impactful RaaS brand accounting for\napproximately 15% of victim organizations listed\non data leak sites (Fig. 8). While LOCKBIT was\nconsistently the highest volume RaaS offering through\nthe first half of 2024, Mandiant observed a decrease\nin the proportion of victims appearing on its data leak\nsite in the months following its disruption. Based on\nvictims posted to prominent data leak sites, LOCKBIT\naccounted for approximately 21% of victims in Q1\n2024, 17% of victims in Q2 2024, 7% of victims in Q3\n2024, and less than 1% of victims in Q4 2024. In Q4\n2024, RANSOMHUB maintained its place as the most\nimpactful RaaS brand, seemingly replacing LOCKBIT\nas the most prominent brand in the RaaS market.[1]\n\n\n###### Figure 8: Distribution of LOCKBIT and RANSOMHUB Victims in 2024\n\n**25%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**15%**\n\n**10%**\n\n**5%**\n\n**0%**\n\n\n**Q1 2024** **Q2 2024** **Q3 2024**\n\n\n**Q4 2024**\n\n\n1 Mandiant tracks multiple data leak sites (DLS) dedicated to releasing victim data following ransomware and/or data theft extortion incidents in which victims refuse to pay a ransom\n\ndemand. These websites are intended to pressure victims to pay the ransom demand or give threat actors additional leverage during ransom negotiations. While the data is skewed to\nvictims who refused to pay the attackers’ ransom demand, it does provide visibility into the most active operations during this time frame. These sites also provide insight into broad\nvictimology trends, although not all the data leak sites or victims appearing on them are associated with operations in which ransomware was deployed.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nGoogle Cloud offers a number of capabilities to help\ncustomers protect against threat actors similar to\nUNC2165 conducting ransomware and data theft\nextortion operations.\n\n**[• Regularly review user permissions: Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview)**\n\nallows you to review and remove unnecessary\npermissions allowing users or roles to create,\n[modify, or execute serverless resources.

This actor engaged in a\nvariety of threat activity, including cryptocurrency\nmining operations on hijacked cloud resources and\nransomware activity. Additional opportunistic threat\nactivity includes:\n\n- Account hijacking focused on cloud service\n\naccounts to mine cryptocurrency\n\n- Ransomware and extortion operations, including\n\nactivity that overlaps with multiple ransomware\ndeployments and efforts to recruit partners in\nblackmail operations\n\n- Advertising access to servers, including those from\n\ncloud platforms such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web\n\nServices, Microsoft Azure, Linode, OVHCloud, and\nDigital Ocean\n\n#### Cloud Account Hijacking Activity\n\nTo take over cloud service accounts,\nTRIPLESTRENGTH leverages stolen credentials\nand cookies, at least a portion of which have come\nfrom Racoon infostealer logs, to gain access to\nvictim cloud environments. Once authenticated,\nthe actor has used hijacked cloud projects to mine\n\n\ncryptocurrencies. TRIPLESTRENGTH has adapted\ntheir abuse of compromised accounts over time.\nInitially, they abused legitimate, compromised\naccounts to create compute resources for mining.\nIn subsequent iterations of the campaign, the threat\nactor abused highly privileged accounts to invite\nattacker-controlled accounts as a billing contact on\nthe victim’s cloud project, and then used enhanced\nbilling privileges to spin up large compute resources.\n\nIn response to TRIPLESTRENGTH’s activity, we\ncollaborated on a multi-quarter effort to disrupt\nthe actor and enhance Google Cloud’s security\nfeatures. These efforts include the phased roll out of\n[mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) to reduce](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/mandatory-mfa-is-coming-to-google-cloud-heres-what-you-need-to-know?e=48754805)\nthe risk of account takeover. Other improvements\n[include improved logging for sensitive billing actions,](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/audit-logging)\ndetection pipelines to identify and mitigate new\ncompromise attempts, and threat actor tracking to\nidentify and disrupt their account infrastructure.\n\n#### Connections to Ransomware Operations\n\nTRIPLESTRENGTH is also involved in ransomware\ndeployment operations. However, they appear\nto keep their ransomware activity separate from\ntheir cryptomining efforts. Notably, we have not\n\n\n-----\n\nseen their ransomware operations impact cloud\ninfrastructure, rather these operations have appeared\nto target on-premises resources. The Google Threat\nIntelligence Group identified shared email addresses,\ninfrastructure overlaps, and underground forum\nposts indicating that the actor’s activity overlaps with\nPHOBOS, RCRU64, and LOKILOCKER ransomware\ndeployments.\n\nIn Telegram channels focused on hacking,\nactors linked to TRIPLESTRENGTH have posted\nadvertisements for RCRU64 ransomware-as-aservice and also solicited partners to collaborate\nin ransomware and blackmail operations. In one\nTelegram post, for example, a persona linked to the\nactor indicated they were looking for partners with\naccess to servers for “blackmail,” suggesting they\nwere likely seeking to conduct ransomware and/or\nextortion operations\n\nMandiant has also linked TRIPLESTRENGTH to\noperators in a RCRU64 ransomware incident in May\n2024. In that incident, the actors gained initial access\nvia remote desktop protocol, which they accessed via\nbrute-force password guessing. After gaining access,\nthe threat actor moved laterally, disabled the anti\nvirus, and then executed RCRU64 ransomware on\nmultiple hosts.\n\n#### Cryptomining Operations\n\nTRIPLESTRENGTH leverages the unMiner application\nalongside the unMineable mining pool to conduct\nthe mining portion of their operations. The unMiner\napplication packages several popular cryptocurrency\n\n\nminers into a single application, while the\nunMinable pool allows payouts in over 90 different\ncryptocurrencies, regardless of which miner is used.\n\nThey have used a variety of both CPU- and GPUoptimized mining algorithms. However, all observed\nfunds were paid out in TRX, the native token for the\nTRON blockchain. The use of both CPU- and GPUoptimized algorithms indicates the threat actor\nlikely chooses the most optimized algorithm for the\ntarget system, with CPU-optimized mining being\nconsistent with mining operations abusing cloud and/\nor corporate infrastructure.\n\n#### Targeting Cloud Service Providers Beyond Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud’s security and threat intelligence teams\nhave focused on tracking TRIPLESTRENGTH’s activity\non Google Cloud. However, it’s worth noting that the\nthreat actor targets other cloud providers as well, and\ntheir operations may impact organizations across a\nwide range of industry sectors and regions. Based on\nanalysis of attacker-owned infrastructure, the Google\nThreat Intelligence Group determined that the actor\nhas relied on Racoon infostealer logs as the source of\nat least a portion of the stolen credentials and cookies\nused in cloud hijacking activities, and that the actor\nhad access to credentials for Google Cloud, Amazon\nWeb Services, and Linode. Additionally, in monitoring\nTelegram channels, Mandiant has observed personas\nconnected to the group routinely advertise access\nto servers, including those from prominent hosting\nproviders and cloud platforms such as Google Cloud,\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Linode,\nOVHCloud, and Digital Ocean.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nWe recommend the following risk mitigations to\nenhance your Google Cloud security posture to\nprotect against threats like account takeover, which\ncould lead to threat actor ransomware or data\nextortion operations.\n\nHelp prevent cloud account takeover:\n\n**• Enroll in multifactor authentication (MFA):**\n\n[Google Cloud’s phased approach to mandatory](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/mandatory-mfa-is-coming-to-google-cloud-heres-what-you-need-to-know)\n[MFA makes it harder for attackers to compromise](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/mandatory-mfa-is-coming-to-google-cloud-heres-what-you-need-to-know)\naccounts even if they have stolen credentials and/or\nauthentication cookies.\n\n**• Use automated sensitive monitoring and**\n\n**[alerting: The Sensitive Actions Service within](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-use-sensitive-actions#:~:text=Sensitive%20Actions%20Service%20is%20a,taken%20by%20a%20malicious%20actor.)**\nGoogle Security Command Center (SCC)\nautomatically detects and alerts for potentially\ndamaging actions.\n\n**• Implement robust Identity and Access**\n\n**Management (IAM) policies: Use IAM policies to**\ngrant users only the necessary permissions for their\njobs.

This threat actor tactic\nis alarming because in the last year we have seen\nthis activity impact victim organizations who rely on\ncloud technologies across multiple cloud service\nproviders, not just those with on-premises systems.\nThe expanded use of these extortion tactics\ncombined with the prevalence of DLS poses a growing\nthreat for all organizations, regardless of where their\ndata is stored.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Mandiant observed 1,242 victims posted\non DLS almost reaching the peak observed in Q3 2023\nwith 1,329 victims. Although the numbers are slightly\nlower in Q3 2024, the overall posts to DLS from Jan.\nthrough Sept. are higher in 2024 with 3,546 victims\nposted, than in 2023 with 3,385 during the same time\nperiod. We expect the number of posts to DLS in 2024\nto surpass the number of posts to DLS in 2023 (4,521\nvictims) by a few hundred posts.\n\nAs more extorted victims and information are posted\nto DLS, this potentially increases the risk exposure\nto organizations because of the sensitive information\nreleased. Due to the nature of the attack and the use\nof the information from the DLS, this article provides a\n\n\ncloser look at a threat actor tactics, which were used\nto compromise cloud environments.\n\nFor example, Storm-0501, a threat actor group\n\nthat is publicly tracked and has possible links to\nthe EMBARGO Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\ngroup, gained initial access to a cloud-based identity\nprovider, deployed ransomware, and amplified their\naccomplishments on their DLS. Notably, Storm-0501\nactively develops and customizes their tools for each\nvictim.\n\nSince April 2024, Mandiant has observed 11 different\npostings to the EMBARGO DLS, which includes the\nfollowing activity:\n\n**• Data Exfiltration: An internal database of**\n\na mortgage lender was breached in a major\nransomware attack that leaked the personal data of\nmultiple customers on the dark web.\n\n**• Extortion Attempt: Alleged victims appear on the**\n\nEMBARGO DLS. Affiliates of EMBARGO can create\na victim blog post with the company’s name, their\nlogo, a description of the company, a description of\nthe incident (e.g., what and how much was stolen),\nany screenshots, and a possible link to the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Similarities in Threat Actor Tactics for Data Extortion\n\nTwo threat groups, UNC3786 and UNC5791, have\nused similar tactics to compromise organizations that\nresulted in exposure of their sensitive data on a DLS.\n\nIn January 2024, Mandiant observed an attack by\nUNC3786, a threat group that has been active since\n\nat least early 2022. The group primarily gains initial\n\naccess with compromised credentials and uses MFA\nbypass techniques (e.g., including SIM swapping) to\nconduct data extortion.\n\nIn September 2024, UNC5791 leveraged a similar\ntactic to the UNC3786 January 2024 attack to obtain\ninitial access to Microsoft 365 accounts. Mandiant\nobserved the threat actors exfiltrating sensitive\ninformation from business software and cloud\nservices organizations, and in some cases, leveraging\nthe ALPHV DLS, which contains data on 53 victim\norganizations spanning multiple verticals.\n\nIn both cases, UNC3786 and UNC5791 employed three\nnotable tactics:\n\n**• MFA Bypass in Cloud-based Services: Both**\n\nUNC3786 and UNC5791 gained initial access to\nMicrosoft 365 accounts by SIM swapping targets\nand exploiting Microsoft’s self-service password\nreset (SSPR) to enroll their own devices for MFA.\nThey then covered their tracks by deleting emails,\nincluding password reset notifications.\n\n**• Data Exfiltration in the Cloud: Both UNC3786**\n\nand UNC5791 exploited compromised accounts to\naccess and steal data from victim organizations’\n\n\nSharePoint servers. UNC3786 downloaded\napproximately 25GB of data and modified group\npermissions where the compromised account likely\nheld elevated privileges. Evidence suggests they\nmay have used Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365\nfor exfiltration, as deleted emails contained Veeam\nevaluation key and website registration messages.\n\n**• Data Extortion Attempts with Aggressive**\n\n**Tactics: Both UNC3786 and UNC5791 employed**\naggressive tactics to attempt to extort victims,\nincluding contacting employees and their families.\nNotably, UNC5791 used aggressive communication\ntactics to increase pressure on their data theft\nextortion victims, including calling and texting\nvictims’ personal devices.\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nOrganizations can leverage multiple Google Cloud\nproducts to enhance protection against ransomware\nand data theft extortion:\n\n**• Leverage Google Security Command Center**\n\n**[(SCC): SCC provides a multi-cloud security](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-command-center)**\nsolution that can help detect data exfiltration\n[events through Event Threat Detection and](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-event-threat-detection-overview)\n\n[misconfigurations through Security Health](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-vulnerabilities-findings#sql-findings)\n[Analytics.
