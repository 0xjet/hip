In addition, we also found multiple Android APK files on their phishing server.\n\nBy: Joseph C Chen, Jaromir Horejsi, Ecular Xu December 09, 2020 Read time: ( words)\n\nWhile tracking the activities of the SideWinder group, which has become infamous for targeting the South Asia region and its surrounding\ncountries, we identified a server used to deliver a malicious LNK file and host multiple credential phishing pages. We learned that these pages\nwere copied from their victims’ webmail login pages and subsequently modified for phishing. We believe further activities are propagated via\nspear-phishing attacks.\n\nThe group’s targets include multiple government and military units, mainly in Nepal and Afghanistan. After the gathered credentials are sent,\nsome of the phishing pages will redirect victims to different documents or news pages. The themes and topics of these pages and documents\nare related to either Covid-19 or recent territory disputes between Nepal, Pakistan, India, and China. Furthermore, it seems that these lures\nare distributed via phishing links.\n\nWe also found multiple Android APK files on their phishing server. While some of them are benign, we also discovered malicious files created\nwith Metasploit. One of the normal applications, called “OpinionPoll,” is a survey app for gathering opinions regarding the Nepal-India political\nmap dispute, which seems to be another political lure similar to the one they used in the spear-phishing portion. We believe these applications\nare still under development and will likely be used to compromise mobile devices in the future.\n\n[SideWinder has been very active in 2020. Earlier this year, we published a report on how the SideWinder APT group used the Binder exploit to](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/a/first-active-attack-exploiting-cve-2019-2215-found-on-google-play-linked-to-sidewinder-apt-group.html)\n[attack mobile devices. The group also launched attacks against Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China using lure files related to Covid-19.](https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/210404)\n\n## Analysis of the malicious document\n\nThe use of malicious documents is one of SideWinder’s most common infection vectors. We collected several different samples from the\ncampaign, including:\n\n1.   An LNK file that downloads an RTF file and drops a JavaScript file\n\n2.   A ZIP file containing an LNK file, which downloads an HTA file (with JavaScript)\n\n3.   An RTF file that drops a JavaScript file\n\n4.   A PDF file with an embedded JavaScript stream\n\n5.   A DOCX file with an external link to an OLE object (RTF file), which contains and drops a JavaScript file\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. An example\n\nof a downloaded ZIP file containing an LNK file that is used to download a malicious HTA file\nAll of these cases end up with either the downloading or dropping of files and then the execution of JavaScript code, which is a dropper used\nto install the main backdoor + stealer.\n\n[The downloaded RTF files exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It drops a file named 1.a (a JavaScript code), which drops the backdoor +](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/ph/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/17-year-old-ms-office-flaw-cve-2017-11882-actively-exploited-in-the-wild)\nstealer into a folder in ProgramData and directly executes it or creates a scheduled task to execute the dropped files at a later time.\n\nFigure 2. A scheduled task with a command to execute the\n\ndropped backdoor + stealer\nThe content of the newly created folder contains a few files, including Rekeywiz (EFS REKEY wizard,\nFA86B5BC5343CA92C235304B8DCBCF4188C6BE7D4621C625564BEBD5326ED850), which is a legitimate Windows application.\n\nFigure 3. List of dropped files\n\nThis application loads various system DLL libraries, including shell32.dll, which sideloads DUser.dll, one of shell32’s DelayImports.\n\nFigure 4. DUser library as DelayImport of shell32 library\n\nHowever, a fake DUser.dll gets loaded into the process. This fake DLL library decrypts the main backdoor + stealer from the .tmp file in the\nsame directory.\n\nFigure 5. Algorithm for\n\ndecrypting both main backdoor + stealer and configuration\nThe decryption process is a simple XOR, where the key is the first 32 bytes from the encrypted file and the payload are the remaining bytes.\nThe decrypted payload is the main backdoor .NET executable binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Decrypted main SystemApp with listing its classes and resources\n\nIn Resources, the Default resource contains the encrypted configuration. After decryption (using the same principle as with the main\nbackdoor + stealer), the configuration reveals which file formats the attackers are targeting.\n\nFigure 7. The decrypted configuration\n\nThe main functions of the backdoor + stealer are:\n\n1) Downloading the .NET executable and running it\n2) Collecting system information and uploading it to the command-and-control (C&C) server\n3) Uploading selected files to the C&C server\nThe collected information is in JSON format (hence why the Newtonsoft_Json library stored in Resources is loaded) and includes\ninformation such as privileges, user accounts, computer system information, antivirus programs, running processes, processor information,\noperating system information, timezone, installed Windows updates, network information, list of directories in Users\\%USERNAME%\\Desktop,\nUsers\\%USERNAME%\\Downloads, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Documents, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Contacts, as well as information on all\ndrives and installed apps.\n\n## The spear-phishing attack\n\nWe found several interesting dynamic DNS domains resolving to a server that was used to deliver SideWinder’s malicious documents. The\nsubdomains of these dynamic DNS domains are designed to be similar to the domains of their victims’ mail servers. For example, “mailnepalgovnp[.]duckdns[.]org” was created to pretend to be the original Nepal government’s domain “mail[.]nepal[.]gov[.]np”. Digging deeper, we\nfound that it hosted several phishing pages.\n\nThese pages were copied from the webmail servers of various targets and then modified for spear-phishing attacks designed to steal login\ncredentials. Although it’s not clear to us how these phishing pages are delivered to the victims, finding the original webmail servers that they\ncopied to make these phishing pages allows us to identify who they were targeting.\n\nAnalysis of the phishing pages revealed that most of them would redirect to the original webmail servers, which they copied after the victims\nsent out their login credentials. However, we also found some of them will either redirect to documents or news pages. These documents and\nnews are probably interesting in some way to their targets and are used to make them click and log in to the phishing pages. While several of\nthe documents are related to Covid-19, we also found some documents or news related to territorial issues in South Asia, including:\n\n[“India Should Realise China Has Nothing to Do

The lure document covering the interview of China’s ambassador to Nepal\n\n## Android applications\n\nWe also identified multiple Android APK files on their server. Interestingly, these Android applications still seem to be under the initial\ndevelopment phase as they are basic, still use the default Android icons, and have no practical function for users.\n\nFigure 11. The default Android icons used by the APKs\n\nWe noticed two applications among them, named “My First APP” and “Opinion Poll,” that seemingly have no malicious behavior. My First APP\ndemonstrates login & register processes, while Opinion Poll acts as an opinion polling application for the Indian-Nepalese political map\ndispute. The first application is likely an Android demo application for beginners, while the second one starts with an explanation of “Opinion\nWriting,” followed by a survey.\n\nFigure 12. Non-malicious applications “My First\n\nAPP” and “Opinion Poll”\n[Another two applications were built from JavaPayload for Metasploit that will load extra code from the remote server configured in the sample.](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-payloads/tree/master/java)\nWhile we were unable to retrieve the payload, according to the Manifest that requests numerous privacy-related permissions like location,\ncontacts call logs etc we can infer that it goes after the user’s private data These two samples appear to be debug versions as they have no\n\n\n-----\n\nact t es o a y ot e co po e t e cept etasp o t\n\nFigure 13. Build from Metasploit and Request\n\nPermissions\nWe also identified a malicious version of the My First APP application that added Metasploit whose class names have been obfuscated.\n\nFigure 14. Malicious version of My First APP, which adds Metasploit\n\nSideWinder has used malicious apps as part of its operation before. In the campaign referenced earlier, the group used malicious APKs\ndisguised as photography and file manager tools to lure users into downloading them. Once downloaded into the user’s mobile device, the\nmalicious APKs launch a series of fairly sophisticated procedures that includes rooting the device to stealthily deploy the payload, as well as\nexploiting CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU vulnerabilities for root privileges. The payload’s ultimate goal is to gather information from the\ncompromised device and then send it back to its C&C server.\n\nIn the case of these newer APKs, it seems that the goal is to gather user information as well. Unlike the earlier apps, which were already on\nthe Google Play Store, all the APK files found on their server are not mature enough for a deliberate attack. In our opinion, these are still in the\ninitial stage, and the payloads (directed at mobile users) are still being refined further.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs seen with their phishing attacks and their mobile device tools’ continuous development, SideWinder is very proactive in using trending\ntopics like Covid-19 or various political issues as a social engineering technique to compromise their targets. Therefore, we recommend that\n[users and organizations be vigilant and follow social engineering best practices to protect themselves from these kinds of campaigns.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/best-practices-identifying-and-mitigating-phishing-attacks)\n\n## Indicator of Compromise\n\n**Android Part IoCs**\n\n**Indicator** **Package name** **Label** **C2 server**\n\n\n0c182b51ff1dffaa384651e478155632c6e65820322774e416be20e6d49bb8f9 com.example.firstandoidapp My First\nApp\n\n\n\n\n061b0379a12b88488db8540226e400e3f65fef9a4c1aa7744da9f17e1d93d78d com.example.opinionpoll OpinionPoll \n\n-----\n\nfb6ac9d93fd47db3d32f6da6320344a125e96754a94babb9d9d12b6604a42536 com.metasploit.stage MainActivity https://185.225.19[.\n\n468b74883536938ef3962655dfcc3ca4097ca9b5b687dfc1fef58d50e96dc248 com.metasploit.stage MainActivity tcp://185.225.19.46\n\n\na377e5f4bf461b86f938959256b7ab8b1b40bb9fd3cd45951c736a22366a8dd1 com.example.firstandoidapp My First\nApp\n\n**Malicious documents and related payloads IoCs**\n\n**Indicator** **Description** **Detection**\n\n\ntcp://185.225.19.46\n\n\n1CBEC920AFE2F978B8F84E0A4E6B757D400AEB96E8C0A221130060B196ECE010 docx Trojan.W97M.CVE20170199.FAIL\n\n7238F4E5EDBE0E5A2242D8780FB58C47E7D32BF2C4F860C88C511C30675D0857 RTF file Trojan.W97M.SIDEWINDER.A\n\n75C158CEA14E338C8D9D32ED988C7032DA9AE6D54F5B1126ED6A83F71B9E03BF 1.a JS file Trojan.JS.SIDEWINDER.A\n\n\nAB6E8563214EEB747ABF77F9CC50796CC6A0C0562C6BEC720D7F2C978D34C412 Fake\nDUser.dll\n\nCBD5C68F5C4345B68F018D9E5810574E8036A2BC4D826BE5C8779E8019449957 Final\npayload\n\n\nTrojan.MSIL.SIDEWINDER.A\n\nTrojan.Win32.SIDEWINDER.B\n\n\n34446F7F60F730FCCA145155D10D1AFF0A1153B085836DF38313772CD03C8D70 RTF file Trojan.W97M.CVE201711882.YQUOOW\n\n7238F4E5EDBE0E5A2242D8780FB58C47E7D32BF2C4F860C88C511C30675D0857 RTF file Trojan.W97M.SIDEWINDER.A\n\nAB7C1967BF1FEFDFFDE93626B78EB30994655AB02F59E0ADB0935E3E599A953F RTF file Trojan.W97M.SIDEWINDER.A\n\n2548A819E4C597BA5958D2D18BAA544452948E5B00271570192CCD79ABE88E8D 1.a JS file Trojan.JS.SIDEWINDER.A\n\nED5E1D6E914DE64A203F2F32AB95176FC7EFFF3A520915971D5FE748E79D611C 1.a JS file Trojan.JS.SIDEWINDER.A\n\n96BF8F579ACB8D9D0FF116D05FDADEF85953F11E5B2E703041FDAE0ABF5B75DC 1.a JS file Trojan.JS.SIDEWINDER.A\n\n\n940265867D5668956D64ADF9FC4B9C6CF9E7FCFCF5C21BA7BF0BEA77B5EDD047 Fake\nDUser.dll\n\nB22946CFEFE8646CB034F358C68CAAE5F30C1CF316CFFEAF77021C099E362C64 Fake\nDUser.dll\n\n89E392FA49C6A6AEB9056E3D2F38B07D0DD7AF230CD22E3B01C71F05A3AECA0B Fake\nDUser.dll\n\nEB2D82DD0799196FCF631E15305676D737DC6E40FF588DCF123EDACD023F1C46 Final\npayload\n\n7ECAEFCB46CDDEF1AE201B1042A62DD093594C179A6913A2DE47AB98148545DD Final\npayload\n\n799260B992C77E2E14F2D586665C570142D8425864455CAB5F2575015CD0B87A Final\npayload\n\nbrep.cdn-edu[.]net RTF\ndelivery\nserver\n\n\nTrojan.MSIL.SIDEWINDER.A\n\nTrojan.MSIL.SIDEWINDER.A\n\nTrojan.MSIL.SIDEWINDER.A\n\nTrojan.Win32.SIDEWINDER.B\n\nTrojan.Win32.SIDEWINDER.B\n\nTrojan.Win32.SIDEWINDER.B\n\n\n-----\n\nwww.mfa.filesrvr[.]net RTF\ndelivery\nserver\n\nwww.google.gov-pok[.]net RTF\ndelivery\nserver\n\nap-ms[.]net C&C\n\ncdn-sop[.]net C&C\n\nfqn-cloud[.]net C&C\n\nms-trace[.]net C&C\n\nimail.aop.gov-af[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-apfgavnp.hopto[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-apfgovnp.ddns[.]net Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-kmgcom.ddns[.]net Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-mfagovcn.hopto[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-mofagovnp.hopto[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-ncporgnp.hopto[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-nepalarmymilnp.duckdns[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-nepalgovnp.duckdns[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-nepalpolicegov.hopto[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-nepalpolicegovnp.duckdns[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-nrborg.hopto[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-nscaf.myftp[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail-ntcnetnp.serveftp[.]com Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail.arg.gov-af[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\n\n-----\n\nmail.moha.gov-np[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nmail.nsc.gov-af[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\nwebmail.mohe.gov-af[.]org Phishing\nDomain\n\n\n-----",
