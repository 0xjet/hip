The main function of the dropper_\n\nAll strings within the dropper, as well as the backdoor, are encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256\nkey. There are two forms of encrypted strings: an RSA256-encrypted string, and custom base64-\nencoded and RSA256-encrypted string.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Hardcoded RSA256 key showing the first 20 characters_\n\nUsing the setStartup() method, the dropper first checks if it is running as a root or not. Based on\n\nthat, the GET_PROCESSPATH and GET_PROCESSNAME methods will decrypt the hardcoded\npath and filename where the backdoor should be installed. The locations:\n\nFor root user\n\npath: /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP-DAL/iOSScreenCapture.plugin/Contents/Resources/\nprocessname: screenassistantd\n\nFor regular user\n\npath: ~/Library/Spelling/\nprocessname: spellagentd\n\nSubsequently, it implements the Loader::installLoader method, reading the hardcoded 64-bit\nMach-O executable (magic value 0xFEEDFACF), and writing to the previously determined path\nand file.\n\n\n-----\n\n[to random values using the touch command: touch –t YYMMDDMM “/path/filename” > /dev/null.](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/touch.1.asp)\nThe access permissions will then be changed to 0x1ed = 755, which is equal to u=rwx,go=rx.\n\n_Figure 7.

The RunAtLoad key will command launchd to run the daemon_\nwhen the operating system starts up, while the KeepAlive key will command launchd to let the\nprocess run indefinitely. This persistence file is also set to hidden with a randomly generated file\ndate and time.\n\n_Figure 8. Property list with persistence settings_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Backdoor analysis_**\n\nThe main loop of the backdoor has two main functions, infoClient and runHandle. infoClient is\nreponsible for collecting OS info, submitting this info to its C&C servers (the servers are malicious\n\nin nature), and receiving additional C&C communication information. Meanwhile, runHandle is\nresponsible for the backdoor capabilities.\n\n_Figure 9. The main functions of the backdoor_\n\n_infoClient fills up the variables in HandlePP class._\n\n_Figure 10. List of variables belonging to the HandlePP class_\n\n_clientID is an MD5 hash derived from the environment variables, while strClientID is a hexadecimal_\nrepresentation of clientID. All strings below are encrypted via AES256 and base64 encoding. The\n_HandlePP::getClientID method uses the following environment variables:_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. MAC address_\n\n_Figure 14. Randomly generated UUID_\n\nFor the initial information packet, the backdoor also collects the following:\n\n_Figure 15. OS version_\n\nRunning getpwuid ->pw_name , scutil – -get ComputerName, and uname –m will provide the\nfollowing returns respectively:\n\nMac OSX 10.12.\n\nSystem Administrator\n\n<owner’s name>’s iMac\n\nx86_64\n\nAll these data are scrambled and encrypted before sending to the C&C server. The process is\ndetailed below:\n\n1. Scrambling\n\nClass Parser has several methods, one for each variable type – Parser::inBytes, Parser::inByte,\n_Parser::inString, and Parser::inInt._\n\n_Figure 16. Parser::inBytes method_\n\nIf clientID equals the following sequence of bytes B4 B1 47 BC 52 28 28 73 1F 1A 01 6B FA 72 C0\n73, then the scrambled version is computed using the third parameter (0x10), which is treated as a\nDWORD. Each quadruple of bytes is XOR-ed with it, as shown in example below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Parser::inByte method\n\nWhen scrambling one byte, the scrambler first determines if the byte value is odd or even. If the\n\nvalue is odd, it adds the byte, along with one more randomly generated byte, to the array. In the\ncase of an even value, the randomly generated byte is added first, followed by the byte being\n\nadded. In the case above, the third parameter is ‘1’ = 0x31, which is an odd number. This means\n\nthat it adds byte ‘1’ and one randomly generated byte to the final scrambled array.\n\n_Figure 18. Parser::inString method_\n\nWhen scrambling a string, the scrambler generates a 5-byte long sequence. First, it generates\none random byte, followed by three zero bytes, one random byte, and finally, the byte with the\n\nlength of the string. Let’s say we want to scramble string ‘Mac OSX 10.12.’ Its length is 13 = 0x0d,\nand the two random bytes are 0xf3 and 0x92. The final 5-byte sequence looks like F3 00 00 00 92\n\n0D. The original string is then XOR’ed with the 5-byte sequence.\n\n_Figure 19. Scrambling ‘Mac OSX 10.12’_\n\n2. Encryption\n\nThe scrambled byte sequence is passed onto the constructor of the class Packet::Packet, which\ncreates a random AES256 key and encrypts the buffer with this key.\n\n3. Encoding the encryption key\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20. Function for scrambling AES256 key in the outgoing packet_\n\nSome screenshots taken during scrambling and encryption process:\n\n_Figure 21. The highlighted bytes represent the scrambled computer info_\n\n_Figure 22. Randomly generated AES256 key_\n\n_Figure 23. Scrambled AES256 key (0xC1 XOR 0x13 = 0xD2, 0xD2 ROL 6 = 0xB4) etc.)_\n\n_Figure 24. Computer info encrypted with AES256 key_\n\n\n-----\n\n_generated noise._\n\nWhen the backdoor receives the response from the C&C server, the final payload needs to be\n\ndecoded again in a similar manner via decryption and scrambling. Packet::getData decrypts the\nreceived payload and Converter::outString descrambles the result.\n\nThe received data from the C&C server include the following information:\n\n_HandlePP::urlRequest (/appleauth/static/cssj/N252394295/widget/auth/app.css)_\n\n_HandlePP::keyDecrypt_\n\n_STRINGDATA::BROWSER_SESSION_ID (m_pixel_ratio)_\n\n_STRINGDATA::RESOURCE_ID_\n\nThese data will be later used in the C&C communication, as shown in the Wireshark screenshot\nbelow.\n\n_Figure 26. Communication with the C&C server after the exchange of OS packet info_\n\nMeanwhile, the runHandle method of the main backdoor loop will call for the requestServer method\n\nwith the following backdoor commands (each command has one byte long code and is extracted\nby Packet::getCommand):\n\n_Figure 27. The getCommand method_\n\nThe figure below shows the example of two of several possible command codes. Both create one\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 28.
