So far, we've noted:\n\nSeveral hundred more tweets about today's attack can be found on Twitter\nusing [#petya.](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23petya)\n[The new Petya variant appears to be using the MS17-010 Eternal Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue)\nexploit to propagate.\n[Others claim the new variant uses WMIC to propagate](https://twitter.com/0x09AL/status/879702450038599681)\nStill no official word on the initial infection vector in today's attacks.\nPeople everywhere are saying today's activity is similar to last month's\nWannaCry ransomware attacks.\n\nSamples of the new Petya variant are DLL files. So far, we've confirmed the\nfollowing two SHA256 file hashes are the new variant:\n\n[027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745?environmentId=100)\n[64b0b58a2c030c77fdb2b537b2fcc4af432bc55ffb36599a31d418c7c69e94b1](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/64b0b58a2c030c77fdb2b537b2fcc4af432bc55ffb36599a31d418c7c69e94b1?environmentId=100)\n\n**_Examining the new Petya variant_**\n\nPetya is a ransomware family that works by modifying the infected Windows\nsystem's Master Boot Record (MBR). Using rundll32.exe with #1 as the DLL\nentry point, I was able to infect hosts in my lab with the above two DLL samples.\nThe reboot didn't occur right away. However, when it did, my infected host did a\nCHKDSK after rebooting.\n\n\nBrad\n\n433 Posts\n\nISC\nHandler\nJun 27th\n2017\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: An infected host immediately after rebooting._\n\nAfter CHKDSK finished, the infected Windows host's modified MBR prevented\nWindows from loading. Instead, the infected host displayed a ransom message.\n\n_Shown above: The ransom note from a compromised system._\n\nSamples of the new Petya variant appear to have WMI command-line (WMIC)\nfunctionality. Others have confirmed this variant [spreads over Windows SMB and](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/06/unit42-threat-brief-petya-ransomware/)\n[is reportedly using the EternalBlue exploit tool, which exploits CVE-2017-0144](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue)\nand was originally released by the Shadow Brokers group in April 2017. My\ninfected Windows hosts immediately generated TCP traffic on port 445 and did\nARP requests for local network hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Some of the traffic noted in my lab environment._\n\nKeep in mind this is a new variant of Petya ransomware. I'm still seeing samples\nof the regular Petya ransomware submitted to places like VirusTotal and other\nlocations. From what we can tell, those previous versions of Petya are not related\nto today's attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Difference in ransomware notes between the old and new Petya_\n_variants._\n\n**_New Petya variant ransom message_**\n\nOoops, your important files are encrypted.\n\nIf you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they have\nbeen encrypted.
