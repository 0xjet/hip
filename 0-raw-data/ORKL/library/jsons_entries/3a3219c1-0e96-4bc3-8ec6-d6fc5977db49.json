They are officers of the ‘Crimean’ FSB and traitors who defected to\nthe enemy during the occupation of the peninsula in 2014.\n\nThe SSU has managed to identify the perpetrators’ names, intercept their communication\nand obtain irrefutable evidence of their involvement in the attacks. All of that, despite the fact\nthat they used the FSB’s own malicious software and tools to remain anonymous and hidden\nonline.\n\n5 members of the group have been notified of suspicion of treason.\n\nThe ARMAGEDON hacker group is an FSB special project, which specifically targeted\nUkraine. This ‘line of work’ is coordinated by the FSB’s 18th Center (Information Security\nCenter) based in Moscow.\n\nSince the Russian aggression in 2014, this unit has carried out over 5,000 cyber attacks and\nattempted to infect over 1,500 government computer systems. The attackers’ goals were:\n\ncontrol over critical infrastructure facilities (power plants, heat and water supply\nsystems);\ntheft and collection of intelligence, including information with restricted access (related\nto security and defence sector, government agencies);\ninformational and psychological influence;\nblocking information systems.\n\nThe investigation and forensic examinations are underway to bring the FSB employees to\njustice for the following crimes: espionage; unauthorized interference in the work of\ncomputers, automated systems, etc.; creation of malicious software or hardware for use,\ndistribution or sale.\n\nThe SSU is continuously taking steps to contain and neutralize Russia’s cyber aggression\nagainst Ukraine.\n\nThe SSU Cyber  Security Department, the SSU investigators carried out the operation jointly\nwith the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and under the\nsupervision of the Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\n[Technical report Armagedon](https://ssu.gov.ua/uploads/files/DKIB/Technical%20report%20Armagedon.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
