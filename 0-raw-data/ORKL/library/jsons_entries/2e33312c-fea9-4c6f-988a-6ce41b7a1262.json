We observed the group\nusing previously unseen malware in these attacks.\n\nPalmerworm uses a combination of custom malware, dual use tools, and living-off-theland tactics in this campaign. Palmerworm has been active since at least 2013, with the\nfirst activity seen in this campaign in August 2019.\n\n## Tactics Tools and Procedures\n\n\n-----\n\nPalmerworm was observed using both dual-use tools and custom malware in these\nattacks.\n\nAmong the custom malware families we saw it use were:\n\nBackdoor.Consock\nBackdoor.Waship\nBackdoor.Dalwit\nBackdoor.Nomri\n\nWe have not observed the group using these malware families in previous attacks – they\nmay be newly developed tools, or the evolution of older Palmerworm tools. Malware used\nby Palmerworm in the past has included:\n\nBackdoor.Kivars\nBackdoor.Pled\n\nWhile the custom malware used by the group in this campaign is previously\nundocumented, other elements of the attack bear similarities to past Palmerworm\ncampaigns, making us reasonably confident that it is the same group carrying out this\ncampaign.\n\nAs well as the four backdoors mentioned, we also see the group using a custom loader and\na network reconnaissance tool, which Symantec detects as Trojan Horse and Hacktool.\nThe group also used several dual-use tools, including:\n\n**Putty – can be leveraged by attackers for remote access, to exfiltrate data and send**\nit back to attackers\n**PSExec – is a legitimate Microsoft tool that can be exploited by malicious actors**\nand used for lateral movement across victim networks\n**SNScan – this tool can be used for network reconnaissance, to find other potential**\ntargets on victim networks\n**WinRAR – is an archiving tool that can be used to compress files (potentially to**\nmake them easier to send back to attackers) and also to extract files from zipped\nfolders\n\nAll these dual-use tools are commonly exploited by malicious actors like Palmerworm,\nwith advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like this increasingly using living-off-theland tactics, including the use of dual-use tools, in recent years. These tools provide\nattackers with a good degree of access to victim systems without the need to create\ncomplicated custom malware that can more easily be linked back to a specific group.\n\nIn this campaign, Palmerworm is also using stolen code-signing certificates to sign its\npayloads, which makes the payloads appear more legitimate and therefore more difficult\n[for security software to detect. Palmerworm has been publicly documented using stolen](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/07/09/certificates-stolen-taiwanese-tech-companies-plead-malware-campaign/)\ncode-signing certificates in previous attack campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe did not see what infection vector Palmerworm used to gain initial access to victim\nnetworks in this campaign, however, in the past the group has been documented as using\nspear-phishing emails to gain access to victim networks.\n\n## Victims\n\nSymantec identified multiple victims in this campaign, in a number of industries,\nincluding media, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance. The media,\nelectronics, and finance companies were all based in Taiwan, the engineering company\nwas based in Japan, and the construction company in China. It is evident Palmerworm\nhas a strong interest in companies in this region of East Asia.\n\nWe also observed Palmerworm activity on some victims in the U.S., however, we were\nunable to identify the sector of the companies targeted.\n\nPalmerworm activity was first spotted in this campaign in August 2019, when activity was\nseen on the network of a Taiwanese media company and a construction company in\nChina. The group remained active on the network of the media company for a year, with\nactivity on some machines there seen as recently as August 2020.\n\nPalmerworm also maintained a presence on the networks of a construction and a finance\ncompany for several months. However, it spent only a couple of days on the network of a\nJapanese engineering company in September 2019, and a couple of weeks on the network\nof an electronics company in March 2020. It spent approximately six months on one of\nthe U.S.-based machines on which we observed activity.\n\nFigure. The amount of time Palmerworm spent on the networks of companies in the different sectors\n\nvaried from a year to just a few days\n\n\n-----\n\nThe finance, media, and construction industries, then, appear to be of the biggest interest\nto Palmerworm in this campaign. There have been reports previously of Palmerworm\n[targeting the media sector.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shadow-force-uses-dll-hijacking-targets-south-korean-company/)\n\n## What do the attackers want?\n\nWhile we cannot see what Palmerworm is exfiltrating from these victims, the group is\nconsidered an espionage group and its likely motivation is considered to be stealing\ninformation from targeted companies.\n\n## How do we know this is Palmerworm?\n\nWhile the custom malware used in this attack is not malware we have seen used by\nPalmerworm before, some of the samples identified in this research are detected by other\nvendors as PLEAD, which is a known Palmerworm (aka Blacktech) malware family. We\nalso saw the use of infrastructure that has previously been attributed to Palmerworm.\n\nThe group’s use of dual-use tools has also been seen in previous campaigns identified as\nbeing carried out by Palmerworm, while the location of its victims is also typical of the\ngeography targeted by Palmerworm in past campaigns. The group’s use of stolen codesigning certificates has also been observed in previous Palmerworm attacks. These\nvarious factors make us reasonably confident we can attribute this activity to\nPalmerworm.\n\nSymantec does not attribute Palmerworm’s activity to any specific geography, however,\n[Taiwanese officials have stated publicly that they believe Blacktech, which we track as](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-cyber-china/taiwan-says-china-behind-cyberattacks-on-government-agencies-emails-idUSKCN25F0JK)\nPalmerworm, is backed by the Chinese government.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAPT groups continue to be highly active in 2020, with their use of dual-use tools and\nliving-off-the-land tactics making their activity ever harder to detect, and underlining the\nneed for customers to have a comprehensive security solution in place that can detect this\nkind of activity.\n\n## Protection\n\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Palmerworm activity:\n\nBackdoor.Consock\nBackdoor.Waship\nBackdoor.Dalwit\nBackdoor.Nomri\nBackdoor.Kivars\nBackdoor.Pled\nHacktool\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan Horse\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n28ca0c218e14041b9f32a0b9a17d6ee5804e4ff52e9ef228a1f0f8b00ba24c11\n\n3277e3f370319f667170fc7333fc5e081a0a87cb85b928219b3b3caf7f1e549c\n\n35bd3c96abbf9e4da9f7a4433d72f90bfe230e3e897a7aaf6f3d54e9ff66a05a\n\n485d5af4ad86e9241abd824df7b3f7d658b1b77c7dcc3c9b74bfe1ddc074c87d\n\n4c05ee584530fd9622b9e3be555c9132fad961848ea215ecb0dd9430df7e4ed8\n\n50ba9a2235b9b67e16e6bd26ae042a958d065eb2c5273f07eee20ec86c58a653\n\n5818bfe75d73a92eb775fae3b876086a9e70e1e677b7c162b49fb8c1cc996788\n\n5a35672f293f8f586fa9cfac0b09c2c52a85d4e8bc77b1ed4d7c16c58fe97a81\n\n69d60562a8d69500e8cb47a48293894385743716e2214fd4e81682ab6ed1c46b\n\n6d40c289a154142cdd5298e345bcea30b13f26b9eddfe2d9634e71e1fb935fbe\n\n6f97022782d63c6cea53ad151c5b7e764e62533d8257e439033c0307437bfb2a\n\n73799d67d32a2b5554c39330e81e7c8069feaa56520e22a7fd0a52e8857c510c\n\n81a4b84700b5f4770b11a5fe30a8df42e5579fd622fd54143b3d2578df4b559d\n\n884cefccd5b3c3a219a176c0c614834b5b6676abbac1d1c98f39624fccc71bf9\n\n8cd6dfffc251f9571f7a82cca2eca09914c950f3b96aaaeaeaaeeac342f9b550\n\n8da532ea294cc2c99e02ce8513a15b108a7c49bd90f7001ce6148955304733cb\n\n9c436db49b27bed20b42157b50d8bdad414b12f01e2127718250565017a08d84\n\n9e3ecda0f8e23116e1e8f2853cf07837dd5bc0e2e4a70d927b37cfe4f6e69431\n\na7f3b8afb963528b4821b6151d259cf05ae970bc4400b805f7713bd8a0902a42\n\naa51b69d05741144d139b422c3b90fdf6d7d5a36dd6c7090c226a0fc155ada34\n\nb32ab70f3f441a775771d6c824d4526715460c0fd72a1dfdec8cd531aef5fabd\n\nd4d5c73c40f50cdef1500fca8329bc8f3f05f6e2ffda9c8feb9be1dcca6ccd31\n\need2ab9f2c09e47c7689204ad7f91e5aef3cb25a41ea524004a48bb7dc59f969\n\nf11e2146b4b7da69112f4681daca0c5ec18917acc4cf4f78d8bff7ac0b53e15c\n\nf21601686a2af1a312e0f99effa2c2755f872b693534dbe14f034fa23587ac0b\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nasiainfo.hpcloudnews.com\n\nloop.microsoftmse.com\n\n103.40.112.228\n\n172.104.92.110\n\n45.76.218.116\n\n45.77.181.203\n\n## About the Author\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is\nto investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\nCopyright © 2005-2020 Broadcom.
