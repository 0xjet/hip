Analysis of the file attached to a spear-phishing email that had been sent to the bank revealed the name of the malware: JSocket. Later on we found that this malware has many names: Adwind RAT (Remote Access Tool), AlienSpy, Frutas, jFrutas, Unrecom, Sockrat, JSocket, jRat. The rich features of the malware, including its ability to run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, as well as the fact that it was not detected by any antivirus solution meant that it immediately got our attention.\n\n Adwind is a backdoor available for purchase. It’s written purely in Java which makes it cross-platform. The backdoor component (called the server) can run on Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Android platforms, providing capabilities for remote desktop control, data gathering, data exfiltration and lateral movement.\n\n While it is more often used by opportunistic attackers and distributed in massive spam campaigns, there are cases where Adwind has been used in targeted attacks. In August 2015, Adwind popped up in the news in connection with a cyber-espionage campaign against an Argentinian prosecutor who had been found dead in January 2015.\n\n Currently the malware is distributed via a software-as-a-service platform which is based on an online subscription model. This report overviews the capabilities of the malware, describes its online platform and lists the cyber-attacks where this malware was used.\n\n\n-----\n\n## THE HISTORY OF ADWIND\n\n#### Frutas RAT\n\n###### The story begins in January 2012. A user of the Spanish-speaking hacking forum “indetectables.net” (the majority of whose users come from Mexico and South America), going by the name of “adwind”, started a new thread about the development and testing of a new cross-platform RAT codenamed “Frutas”, which was fully implemented in Java.\n\n A week later, on 17th January, he announced the first release of the RAT. Its development was rapid and in late February version 0 4 was released\n\n\n-----\n\n###### We found some information about that early variant:\n\n Name: Seerver.jar\n Size: 24’034 bytes\n MD5: ea68f5067c916ce6afd72aa72e89450d\n\n After that new versions were released every two months:\n\n|Date|Version|Size|MD5|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|20.02.2012|0.4|24034|ea68f5067c916ce6afd72aa72e89450d|\n|26.03.2012|0.6|32523|aa647cc251c0d63170c79c6ea64ae62d|\n|7.05.2012|0.7|28148|9d28cb35d6e16f7e3c5382bcd95b621b|\n|5.07.2012|0.8|?|?|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The author announced the following functionality in version 0.8:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Following the release of version 0.8, the Frutas RAT started to gain popularity in the cybercriminal world, mainly in Spanish-speaking countries.\n\n Version 0.8 was described by Symantec researchers back in February 2013:\n\n Building the backdoor server (image courtesy of Symantec)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Backdoor features includes custom pop-ups (image courtesy of Symantec)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### However, by that time a more powerful version, 0.9, had already been released, in September 2012:\n\n The author nicknamed “adwind” worked hard and his efforts resulted in the release of version 1.0, also in September 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This was the last release of the Frutas RAT (under this name), although we have information on at least one additional private build: “JFrutas RAT v1.0 Version Privada”:\n\n#### The Adwind RAT\n\n###### After the release of Frutas 1.0, the author changed the name of the project to “Adwind RAT”. This was the first but by no means the last “rebranding” of this malware\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The first variant of the Adwind RAT, version 1.0, seems to have been released in January 2013, just four months after the final release of Frutas 1.0.\n\n The Adwind RAT gained worldwide attention and quickly became one of the favorite tools among Arabic-speaking hackers, mostly used in conjunction with the DarkComet RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### The most popular version of Adwind was 2.0, released in May 2013. It had fresh new look and logo:\n\n One of the screenshots demonstrating the RAT revealed the user’s PC name which was “adwind”. While IP information was apparently altered by the user, he forgot to amend or ignored the country name on the following screenshot:\n\n Surprisingly, this variant of Adwind was still around in 2015, due to the freely redistributable cracked “license” protection in Adwind version 2/3.\n\n Version 3.0 was released in August 2013. The author created a new YouTube channel to announce the new release and host video tutorials.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Version 3.0 of the Adwind RAT added support for Android OS, and from that moment Adwind was truly cross-platform, supporting all major OS including mobile: Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adwind 3.0 also introduced a subscription model with different plans:\n\n In the summer of 2013, Adwind was also being used in targeted attacks around the world and, for the first time was seen in attacks in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Kaspersky Security Network detected Adwind fewer than 2,000 times during 2013, but nearly 70% of all targets were located in just ten countries, with Arabic and Spanish-speaking countries at the top:\n\n#### UNRECOM\n\n###### A second rebranding of the RAT took place in November 2013. The following note appeared at adwind.com.mx, a website owned by the Adwind developer:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### It came as a big surprise to Adwind customers and some clarification was provided by another Mexican hacker nicknamed “faria”, who was a reseller of the Adwind RAT. Below is a rough computer translation from the original Spanish:\n\nFirst of all apologize for taking so long but it was worth .... It is advised to all those who bought\nthe rat adwind of version 3.0 down the project will be managed by adwind not because they\nhave received threats and by legal issues, therefore it is removed from the project and has\ndecided to sell the company called lustrosoft. The company has purchased the adwind has\ndecided to rename the project is no longer adwind Rat was called. You may wonder who the\nhell lustroSoft, well it’s a guy programmer in java, c ++, html etc. Lo means that this guy has\ngreat knowledge, I’ve had the opportunity to talk with him and I think it does work very calidad.\nEl good to excellent launch of the new software will be starting on Thursday 11/8/2013 that\nwill bring them more options adwind new ones were added which I can not say that will be\na surprise, besides that comes to fud all antivirus and much more ... For those who bought\na new total adwind reciviran your mind free software depending on whether they bought with\nor without android android.\n\nQuestions.......\n\nWhat will happen to my remote that had the 3.0 will be lost? Redirijidos will not be lost to\nthe new software the handover.\n\nHow is the new project called? It is not yet known to be defined.\n\nWill it serve for PC and mobile android? Clearly, if\n\nI continue working with lustroSoft? Yeah I will continue to sell and support to all my clients.\n\nIf I want to buy who do I contact? Can they make their turns starting date 11.08.2013 marrow\nfaria me.\n\nWhat will be the value of the new software would be paid and where? The value is not fixed aun.\nEl be sent through paypal, werter Union.\n\nWhere I can see the site of the new software? Still under construction then they will be released.\n\nFor more information you can add me to fariastreball@hotmail.com saludoss faria att.\n\n###### Shortly after that, on 12 November 2013, the same “faria” released information about a new RAT codenamed UNRECOM.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### UNRECOM (or LustroSoft) also used a subscription based model with different plans:\n\n The individual nicknamed ”faria” used skype and gmail accounts which revealed a connection to the distribution of UNRECOM. Considering that he entered the scene as a person related to the distribution of Adwind, we believe that he is probably a friend or partner of the original Adwind author.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### UNRECOM version 1.3 was cracked by hacker Boredliner\n (boredliner.wordpress.com) in February 2014 and released to the public.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The same software cracker (“Boredliner”) released a cracked version of Adwind 3.0 in February 2014:\n\n Software protection was based on license number and hardware checks. One of new features of this variant of Adwind was a commercial obfuscation tool known as Allatori which is used for Java bytecode obfuscation.\n\n To check the serial number, Adwind established a connection to adwind.com.mx, which had to be resolved to a hardcoded IP: 65.99.225.111\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This cracked version of Adwind 3.0 was the main and most widely used variant of Adwind in targeted attacks based on Adwind during 2014-2015.\n\n The next version of UNRECOM (2.0) was released in March 2014.\n\n By the summer of 2014 there were two Java-based RATs circulating in the cybercriminal world, based on the same source code – Adwind v.2/3 (cracked) and UNRECOM (with “new owner”, also cracked).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### AlienSpy\n\n###### Obviously, the availability of free, cracked variants of the RAT caused a decline in sales that disturbed the author (regardless of how he was connected to UNRECOM) and his response was the introduction of a new “rebranded” RAT in September-October 2014: AlienSpy RAT.\n\n The first known and widely distributed versions were 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2, with the latest released in October 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Some versions of AlienSpy were also cracked and used by cybercriminals, but, as we explained earlier, most of them relied on free Adwind or UNRECOM. This and previous facts were the reason behind the increased number of targeted attacks using this RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Targeted email sample (image courtesy of contagiodump)\n\n In April 2015, Fidelis published the first detailed report on AlienSpy, based on known cases from dozens of attacks against US companies.\n\n “Fidelis researchers have observed AlienSpy being sold in the cyber- underground via a subscription model, with prices starting at $9.90 for 15-day use to $219.90 for an annual subscription. The subscription provides users with access to the malware’s complete range of capabilities, including some newer techniques like sandbox detection, antivirus tool disablement, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption-protected command-and-control capabilities.”\n\n If you compare the prices quoted for AlienSpy with those for UNRECOM, it appears that short-term subscriptions for the new “brand” were cheaper (starting at just $9.90), but an annual subscription was more expensive ($219.9 vs $200 for unlimited use of UNRECOM).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Fidelis report was focused on the last known variant of AlienSpy – version 5.1. Code analysis revealed a lot of functions from UNRECOM (meaning that it was based on this RAT, not Adwind).\n\n The authentication server for AlienSpy was located at alienspy.net, registered in June 2014. However, the domain was suspended by GoDaddy after the Fidelis report – and the business of the AlienSpy author was ruined again.\n\n After just two months, in June 2015, the fifth reincarnation of Frutas was born – this time under the name it is still known by today: the “JSocket RAT”.\n\n## THE LATEST REINCARNATION OF THE MALWARE\n\n#### JSocket.org: malware-as-a‑service\n\n###### JSocket.org is a website that implements a concept known as malware-as- a‑service, which is a commercially available malware tool that can be used on a subscription basis, and which includes basic technical support, additional paid components and modules, as well as accompanying services such as obfuscation to evade AV detection, a free VPN service for members with the ability to map ports for incoming connections at the VPN termination point and free checks using tens of different AV engines.\n\n The project runs openly as if it were providing completely legitimate products and services for benign purposes. It uses common online marketing methods to advertise the capabilities of its malware and the various techniques available for stealing information.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The website is hosted or proxied via 37.61.235.30, an IP that belongs to LayerIP UK, a mysterious hosting company for which we couldn’t find a public website.\n\n#### Registration\n\n###### As of January 2016, JSocket registration is open to everyone. To register you have to provide a valid email address which will be validated after initial sign up. Some of the additional features, such as the VPN service and additional downloads are only available to registered users.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Online malware shop\n\n###### The users who successfully complete the registration process get access to the online shop where they may purchase a subscription plan for the JSocket RAT, and buy additional components and services. Below are the membership plans available to registered users.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Additional, paid-for, standalone components are as follows:\n\n The online shop offers the following methods for the transfer of money:\n\n 1. \u0007PerfectMoney\n This internet payment system offers a number of ways to deposit funds in its virtual account, including via a bank wire transfer, Bitcoin, cash terminals and a variety of e-currencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2. \u0007CoinPayments\n This payment processing service supports 49 cryptocurrencies including the most popular, Bitcoin and Lightcoin.\n\n 3. \u0007Advcash\n This is an electronic currency and e-wallet service with a large number of exchange opportunities, including cryptocurrencies.\n\n 4. \u0007EntroMoney\n Yet another payment system with a large number of exchanges supported, mostly from Nigeria.\n\n#### YouTube channel\n\n###### The owner of JSocket runs a YouTube channel for malware users. This carries educational videos on how to build malware and how to make use of JSocket services while using the Adwind RAT.\n\n By the end of 2015 the channel carried six videos.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### According to an analysis of the video content, the creator of the videos, who is also the supposed owner of the JSocket website uses the Spanish version of Microsoft Windows 10 with a number of virtual machines running on VMWare. The author of the videos has the local time zone set to UTC-5.\n\n#### Profitability\n\n###### JSocket.org offers six types of memberships ranging from 15 days to a one year subscription term which cost from $25 USD to $300 USD respectively. In December the website had more than 1,600 registered users. The estimated annual revenue of this online project is about $200,000 USD.\n\n## LATEST KNOWN ADWIND ATTACKS\n\n###### At the end of 2015, the Adwind RAT was used to attack banks outside of Singapore, such as the Ajman bank in the United Arab Emirates, Bangkok Bank, the IBC Bank (USA), the Nordic financial services group Nordea, headquartered in Sweden, and possibly Bank Negara Malaysia.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Another attack that was discovered via an Adwind email sample uploaded to VirusTotal revealed an attempt to attack a major bank in Russia. Although the actor behind that attack seems unrelated to the original attack, the trend to target banks via direct emails to employees seems to be on the rise.\n\n An email sent to a major bank in the Russian Federation\n\n Adwind was used in another reported attack in November 2015, which centred on a spear-phishing email campaign sent on behalf of the UAE Police Force and carrying a warning about a terror threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### We found another example of an “on behalf of Police” attack, also in November but from the “Commissariat de Police” in Belgium.\n\n At the end 2015 we observed some attacks based on the theme of “shipping” instead of “money transfer”.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adwind/JSocket was also used for non-financially motivated attacks:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### During our research we analyzed about 200 different examples of Adwind attacks covering the period November 2015-January 2016. We were able to identify about 60 different targets of these attacks and extract about 150 samples of Adwind (see related C2s and some hashes in the Appendix.)\n\n Most of the recipients fall into the category of financial organisations and manufacturing/engineering. We also found some government-(or -state) owned targets.\n\n|owned targets.|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Industry/area|Number of targets|\n|Finance|9|\n|Manufacturing|11|\n|Engineering|7|\n|Shipping|3|\n|Design|6|\n|Trade|4|\n|Telecom|3|\n|Software|2|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KSN statistics\n\n###### Of course, the 200 analyzed email messages represent just the tip of the iceberg. Every Adwind attack in November-January was massive and infected messages were sent to thousands of targets.\n\n Based on KSN data we were able to uncover the real picture. We checked all MD5s from the attacks described above that had been detected by Kaspersky products and reported to KSN.\n\n Month, year Number of users\n\n August 2015 5090\n\n September 2015 611\n\n October 2015 263\n\n November 2015 22996\n\n December 2015 33127\n\n January 2016 27725\n\n Total 68567\n\n Looking at this data we concluded that some of the Adwind samples had been used before – in August-October 2015.\n\n|Month, year|Number of users|\n|---|---|\n|August 2015|5090|\n|September 2015|611|\n|October 2015|263|\n|November 2015|22996|\n|December 2015|33127|\n|January 2016|27725|\n|Total|68567|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The geographical distribution of targets also very interesting:\n\n 2015 (August-December): TOP10 countries\n\n January 2016: TOP10 countries\n\n\n-----\n\n## INFECTION VECTORS\n\n###### Adwind was distributed in November 2015 to a number of banks in Singapore in the form of an email attachment. It was reported that the email had been sent on behalf of another bank located in Malaysia (faking the email ‘From’ field).\n\n At the end of 2015 we became aware of new propagation method for Adwind samples, based on obfuscated HTA files with VBScript+JScript (sample 5a7b277e2202d308f1a755505d113986) which downloaded and silently installed a full Java Runtime Environment if the target host didn’t have it. Related URLs:\n\n http://wadesaba[.]com/admin/file2.vbs (92e3f93d11043d5f8d20922af54ad70c, VBScript that downloads JAR file)\n\n http://wadesaba[.]com/admin/file2.jar (1fbd9dabfb5b4aebc382427aae9b187f, Adwind RAT).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The HTA/VBScript was developed and provided by the JSocket platform, as stated in comments in one of the files:\n\n A distribution method via HTA files was confirmed by an analysis of the JSocket platform which sells its own HTA packer.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KSN statistics\n\n###### In the databases of Kaspersky Security Network we have statistics about Adwind detections since 2013. In 2012, detection names were mostly generic (e.g. Agent) and cannot be identified when gathering information. All known detection names are listed in the Appendix.\n\n General detection statistics:\n\n Year Number of users with detection\n\n 2013 748\n\n 2014 36,386\n\n 2015 305,168\n\n 2016 (January) 101,253\n\n Every year the list of the TOP-10 attacked countries was different. As we said above, in 2013 Arabic and Spanish-speaking countries were at the top. Let’s look at how the list changed:\n\n 2013:\n\n|Year|Number of users with detection|\n|---|---|\n|2013|748|\n|2014|36,386|\n|2015|305,168|\n|2016 (January)|101,253|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2014:\n\n In 2014, the most attacked countries were Turkey and India, followed by UAE, the US and Vietnam.\n\n 2015:\n\n In 2015, Russia was the most attacked country, with UAE and Turkey again near the top, along with the USA, Turkey and Germany.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CASE STUDY OF A TARGETED ATTACK\n\n#### Point of entry\n\n###### In November 2015 we received an email text and JAR attachment (MD5: e8388a2b7d8559c6f0f27ca91d004c7c) which had been sent to a bank in Singapore. It was reported that the email has come on behalf of another bank located in Malaysia (faking the email ‘From’ field).\n\n We requested and analysed the email headers, which revealed the real source to be the email address (alst@alst.ru) and IP (31.31.196.31). The email header is listed below. Note that the email addresses, bank name and some hostnames were redacted. The most important unedited information is marked in bold.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The email arrived with an HTML body and an attached JAR file (MD5: e8388a2b7d8559c6f0f27ca91d004c7c). Below is the text of the message with the employee name and phone number and the target institution redacted:\n\n “Attention, We have received a letter claiming of Money laundering involving your institution and 1 other institution mentioned on the letter. You are mandated to explain your involvement on the claim before appropriate actions are carried against your institution. Kindly check attached for the copy of the letter received. You have seven(5) days to respond. Thank you for your attention .\n\n Regards, %Full Name% Supervisor Money Services Business Regulation Department %Bank in Malaysia% %Phone Number%”\n\n We believe that the owner of alst.ru was not aware of or involved in the malware campaign. According to open source intelligence, the website belongs to a small software development company ООО “Альянс-Софт” in the Russian Federation. When contacted, the company owner agreed to cooperate and help with our investigation. We were provided with background information and access credentials to the compromised server in order to conduct our own analysis. The owner claimed that the website had been experiencing trouble with malware for more than a year. It had been blacklisted by Kaspersky AV and Google for spreading malware.\n\n The website used to run on a shared hosting platform provided by reg.ru. Unfortunately the preservation settings for logs were set to just seven days. This prevented us from seeing access logs for the dates when the emails were sent.\n\n We have checked the website and while there were security misconfigurations, old backups of a database, some older scripts and even a php-script that allowed passwords for a website CMS to be reset to a default one\n ith t th ti ti th i ibl t f b b kd\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In addition we found that the website had definitely been compromised and used for spreading malware in the past. For example we found Jobs.apk (MD5 6ff5e6acb43c0bcbfd649004e96aa6d3) that was detected by 31 of 57 AV engines according to VirusTotal (Kaspersky: Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a). However, that malware is not related to the Adwind platform.\n\n The web resource had more than 10 mailboxes bound to domain alst.ru. All mail was sent via mail.alst.ru (31.31.196.31). The server required authentication and the password for alst@alst.ru was not empty, so it seemed that the attacker had the credentials. On the date of our check (24.11.2015) the alst@alst.ru mailbox was disabled.\n\n#### VirusTotal activity analysis\n\n###### Analysis of the files submitted to VirusTotal revealed that the file was first seen on 2015-11-12 03:42:13. The activity log on VirusTotal indicated that the same file was distributed to potential targets in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n#### Malware analysis\n\n###### File MD5: e8388a2b7d8559c6f0f27ca91d004c7c\n Original name: MoneyLaunderingReportA00283B.jar\n File size: 128’299 bytes\n ZIP directory timestamps (last modified):\n 2015 Nov 10 11:34:22\n 2015 Nov 12 10:05:38\n\n This JAR file is an obfuscated multi-layered container for an encrypted payload package inside. It is decrypted and unpacked using classes that are constructed dynamically during program execution, which makes it very hard to analyze using a static analysis approach.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The next stage container is also a JAR file (MD5: 214c0a42a318108838f915f4afa4a966, size: 116’455 bytes). The ZIP directory of this file contains the following timestamps:\n\n 2015 Nov 12 10:02:04\n 2015 Nov 12 10:02:08\n 2015 Nov 12 10:02:10\n\n The second stage JAR decrypts the third stage JAR\n (MD5:ae4a15544a47fd007049ca8c1a28331f, size: 108,824 bytes). The third stage JAR ZIP directory contains an identical timestamp for all entries: 2015 Nov 12 10:02:08.\n\n The final JAR contains a number of classes including an obfuscated JSocket library with its own keys in JKS format, and a configuration file. The full config file can be found in Appendix A of this report, while an extract from the config file is provided below:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The manifest file reveals the main module used in this backdoor. It is a well known JSocket RAT:\n```\n Manifest-Version: 1.0\n Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.9.4\n Created-By: 1.8.0_60-b27 (Oracle Corporation)\n Main-Class: org.jsocket.main.Start\n\n Another notable resource which is packaged inside this JAR file is a Java keystore file that contains a record with single certificate:\n Alias name: test\n Creation date: Jan 17, 2015\n Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry\n\n```\nCertificate chain length: 1\nCertificate[1]:\n```\n Owner: CN=assylias, O=assylias.Inc, C=FR\n Issuer: CN=assylias, O=assylias.Inc, C=FR\n Serial number: 1f239dbd\n Valid from: Sat Jan 17 13:26:19 SGT 2015 until: Mon Dec 24 13:26:19 SGT 2114\n\n```\nCertificate fingerprints:\n```\n   MD5: AB:2E:7C:A8:E2:B9:CE:CD:E9:DB:F0:F3:89:23:B8:A2\n   SHA1: D6:2E:06:53:11:DF:FC:EC:AD:9F:8E:92:C3:16:AA:FB:60:19:39:4B\n   SHA256: 68:99:B6:1C:46:C8:26:08:83:2C:94:45:BD:BA:04:6E:EC:B7:D1:E9:0E:16:\n AE:24:46:F4:61:FA:F7:36:9E:3E\n   Signature algorithm name: SHA256withRSA\n   Version: 3\n Extensions:\n #1: ObjectId: 2.5.29.14 Criticality=false\n\n```\nSubjectKeyIdentifier [\nKeyIdentifier [\n```\n 0000: 0B F8 83 9B 8E E6 AF 75  A6 6E 1C C1 E8 D0 6E 21 .......u.n....n!\n 0010: 5A 17 F1 31                   Z..1\n ]\n\n###### This keystore file was built by the developer of the JSocket RAT, based on properties wholly copied from a developer nicknamed assylias who published a detailed tutorial in a private blog. We do not think that assylias is involved with the development of JSocket malware.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### The code of the JSocket backdoor remains obfuscated even after the unwrapping of several of layers of protection. It uses a feature of JAR/ZIP archives to store case-sensitive filenames, which means that the JAR archive was most likely created on a non-Windows system. Many tools for the Windows platform will fail to extract or analyze such an archive, because it contains several filenames which differ only in the upper case and lower case representation of the same name:\n\n Java class names consisting of upper and lowercase “i” characters\n\n According to the JSocket developer, the server component of the RAT supports agents running on Windows, Linux, Mac and Android OS.\n\n JSocket client software\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Some of the features provided by the Adwind/JSocket RAT include:\n\n • A listing of any operational security software\n\n • Listing and managing the operational processes\n\n • Listing of network connections\n\n • Listing/managing of local services\n\n • Listing/managing the startup entries\n\n • Listing/uninstalling locally installed software\n\n • Running VBS/BAT scripts or displaying text/html messages to the local user\n\n • Controlling the system power state\n\n • File transfer and file management\n\n • Capturing video from the webcam\n\n • SMS and APK management on Android devices\n\n • Command line access\n\n • Password stealing from popular browsers, Outlook, databases, download managers, and messaging services\n\n • A recording microphone\n\n • Offline and online keylogger\n\n • Stealing keys for cryptocurrency wallets (33 cryptocurrencies supported)\n\n • Clipboard data stealer\n\n • Remote desktop control\n\n • Chat with local user\n\n • A stealer of VPN keys (YourFreedom service)\n\n • Hosts file editor\n\n • Browser form grabber\n\n • UPnP port mapper\n\n • SOCKS 4/5 proxy server\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The main JAR file pushed to the victim is a generic loader of additional components, which extend functionality of the backdoor upon command from the attacker. This made the server part of the Java backdoor unusually small (less than 130Kb).\n\n#### Command & Control infrastructure\n\n###### igbankwuruns.no-ip.info (resolved to 5.254.106.216 (RO) according to malwr.com, used to be resolved to 180.74.97.18 (MY)). Coincidentally this address matched the sender IP from the email header.\n\n Based on pDNS analysis 5.254.106.216 was related to the following domains:\n\n • broadband.ddns.net\n\n • dellboy12.ditchyourip.com\n\n • emenike.no-ip.info\n\n Below is the summary list of IPs where these domains used to resolve. If grouped by countries they are mostly in Nigeria, Great Britain (leased to Romanian ISP Voxility) and Malaysia.\n\n 81 NG\n 79 GB\n 24 MY\n  8 US\n  5 DE\n  2 IE\n  1 NL\n  1 CY\n  1 CA\n  1 BE\n  1 AL\n\n According to our pDNS records, the IP from Malaysia 180.74.97.18 is related to the following additional domain: egombute.duckdns.org\n\n At the time of checking (on 26 November 2015) port 9996 at 180.74.97.18 was open, which may indicate that it is a real host used by the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Link to JSocket.org\n\n###### According to the mode of operation, the backdoor’s administrative software (client) first connects to JSocket.org to verify the user’s subscription. This software is available for purchase and is not available for download by non-customers. The website JSocket.org allows people to register and to obtain some information about other registered users. We have checked a couple of unique strings that were used by the attacker and discovered that there is a registered user called egombute. On 26 Nov 2015 we received the following information via https://jsocket.org/page/profile/egombute/ page:\n\n The time above is in the local time zone of the web server which is UTC-5.\n\n So far, we can conclude that the individual calling himself Ego Mbute is connected to the initial attack against banks in Singapore.\n\n Also, we were able to find another attack from that person in September 2015.\n\n The original dropper of the sample is RTF file “MoneyLaunderingLetter.doc” (MD5 1f14bd3706f22ae03b42510940692c50) with Exploit.CVE-2012-0158. This malicious document was sent to dozens (or probably hundreds) of victims around the world. According to VirusTotal, the document was uploaded for analysis 110 times from 89 sources between 14 September and 13 October.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Here are two examples of original spear-phishing messages:\n\n First (MD5 84ac07a82e35450d258bffe01a2ac020):\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Second (this one was forwarded by the victim to their own security team): MD5 8304f509fbaaa368ae8e4ddfdd36f303\n\n\n-----\n\n###### As you can see in this attack the attacker used exactly the same message template as for the November attacks with the Adwind backdoor. Even the typo: “You have seven(5) days to respond” wasn’t fixed.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The dropper tried to connect to previewproperty.co.uk (109.108.143.46). This domain did not represent the final stage of the operation. It was used as a Command & Control server; and not only in this case – we found more samples of the dropper:\n```\n 18 August: TTDETAILS.doc\n (50ef5396480fe75d5d68b5266471bea19524b9ac5ae18aa235de0859e617bfec)\n 30 August: BANKWIRE-DETAILS.doc\n (ed015d72b8c63d628e6d90e61af186ee6eb1609ee7cb8893b16ac1c5bf065659)\n\n It also downloads the hawkEye keylogger as “freshnow.exe” from emenike.no-ip. info. The keylogger also tries to download additional data and executables from 104.27.137.248:80 (serv.hfsoft.xyz) and 209.160.26.176:80 (www.prachiths.com).\n\n#### Attribution\n\n###### From the use of language in the email sent by the attacker we can conclude that he is either not a native speaker or, if this is their national language, might originate from a less-developed region.\n\n The ZIP directory timestamp is stored in the local user time zone. Since the email was sent at 11:10 SGT and some of the most recent files were prepared at 10:05 (in the attacker’s time zone) we may conclude that the attacker most probably operated in UTC+7 or UTC+8.\n\n A string used in a nickname field in the malware configuration file was “Baba‑MyGod--Too-Much” (another sample contains similar string “Baba‑God--Too-Much”). This seems to be a reference to a popular African gospel song, available on YouTube here and here.\n\n The domain “emenike.no-ip.info” used by the attacker is most likely a reference to the famous Nigerian soccer player Emmanuel Chineye Emenike.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### Emanuel Emenike whose name was used in a malicious domain\n\n In addition, we found that emenike.no-ip.info has been spotted in another malware attack published by FireEye researchers here.\n\n According to a Reuters publication in 2014 as of March 2014, according to the ministry of education there were 9,146 Nigerians on student visas in Malaysia, out of a total 123,000 overseas students.\n\n “Hundreds of American women are being ensnared by Internet scammers based in Malaysia, with some losing over a quarter of a million dollars, as the country becomes an epicenter for online crime perpetrated by Africans, U.S. officials say.\n\n The mostly Nigerian conmen, who enter Malaysia on student visas, take advantage of the country’s good Internet infrastructure to prey on lonely, middle-aged women, wooing them on dating websites before swindling their savings, they said.\n\n The scams are more sophisticated than most Nigeria-based operations - which most Internet users have experienced at some time either via email or advertising - helped by Malaysia’s advanced banking system, which allows perpetrators to quickly set up accounts and receive international transfers.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\n###### Based on the initial attack against banks in Singapore, we have discovered that a suspect behind this attack is most likely located in Malaysia while having Nigerian origins. The miscreant is definitely involved in targeted attacks with a major focus on financial institutions, using various techniques to reach the target. In September 2015, the attacker used spear-phishing emails with attached MS Word documents that exploited a patched vulnerability in Microsoft Office. In November of that year, the same attacker tried to hit the targets again using a Java backdoor. The attacker is not an advanced threat actor as indicated by the habit of reusing the same email message template again and again, relying on a patched, three-year old MS Office vulnerability and commercially available malware tools such as the Adwind RAT. Nevertheless, the threat coming from this actor has not yet been eradicated and his recurring attempts to attack various banks using new infection vectors are likely to continue, with the next attempt imminent.\n\n Despite several attempts to take down and stop the Adwind developers from distributing the malware, Adwind has survived for years and has been through rebranding and operational expansion that ranged from the provision of additional plugins for the malware to its own obfuscation tool and a even a warrant for FUD (fully undetected malware) to customers. The success of this commercial backdoor was so high that it inevitably led to the growth of malware resellers and copycats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### While the concept of malware written in Java isn’t new, the usage of multiple malware encryptors and obfuscators as well as unpacking in memory and a lack of full Java emulators (with the huge collection of classes that Java requires) in AV products makes this malware successful at passing through enterprise security fences.\n\n A simple infection vector based on an email with an attached JAR file is rather unique and unexpected. One of the reason why the attackers choose banks as targets may be the popularity of the Java platform in financial institutions as well as the attractive opportunity of a large-scale bank cyber -heist. The malware depends on having Java runtime installed, which is more likely to be the case for enterprise users rather than typical home users.\n\n It is recommended that the Java platform is disabled or fully uninstalled from the system unless it is used. In case of a dependency on the Java platform it is recommended that modern and updated security software is used and that the email filters are configured to block messages containing attached JAR files.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### For large organizations or users with basic experience, one simple trick may help to prevent accidental infection of the system with such JAR-based malware: changing the default handler for the JAR file extension. This can be achieved with two clicks in Windows or distributed via registry settings in a large corporate network.\n\n Replacing the default JAR file handler application with, for instance, Windows Notepad will not only protect users from running malicious JARs but may also create enough confusion from encountering gibberish text to call the system administrator and bring a strange attachment to their attention.\n\n Adwind was and is an example of successful, widespread malware which runs on any platform. This malware set the bar for other malware writers who will most likely try to extend their support to other platforms in the future.\n\n As of January 2016, the website JSocket.org was still up and running. Apparently a domain or server takedown strategy doesn’t work against prolific projects like this. The most efficient way is prosecution of the malware writers and their customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n###### 1.
