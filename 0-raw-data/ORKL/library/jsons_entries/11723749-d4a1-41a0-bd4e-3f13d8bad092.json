    "plain_text": "# Who Wrote the ALPHV/BlackCat Ransomware Strain?\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/who-wrote-the-alphv-blackcat-ransomware-strain/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/who-wrote-the-alphv-blackcat-ransomware-strain/)**\n\nIn December 2021, researchers discovered a new ransomware-as-a-service named ALPHV\n(a.k.a. “BlackCat“), considered to be the first professional cybercrime group to create and\nuse a ransomware strain written in the Rust programming language. In this post, we’ll\nexplore some of the clues left behind by a developer who was reputedly hired to code the\nransomware variant.\n\nImage: Varonis.\n\n[According to an analysis released this week by Varonis, ALPHV is actively recruiting](https://www.varonis.com/blog/alphv-blackcat-ransomware)\n[operators from several ransomware organizations — including REvil,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=REvil) [BlackMatter and](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=blackmatter)\n[DarkSide — and is offering affiliates up to 90 percent of any ransom paid by a victim](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=darkside)\norganization.\n\n“The group’s leak site, active since early December 2021, has named over twenty victim\norganizations as of late January 2022, though the total number of victims, including those\nthat have paid a ransom to avoid exposure, is likely greater,” Varonis’s Jason Hill wrote.\n\n[One concern about more malware shifting to Rust is that it is considered a much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))\nsecure programming language compared to C and C++, writes Catalin Cimpanu for The\nRecord. The upshot? Security defenders are constantly looking for coding weaknesses in\nmany ransomware strains, and if more start moving to Rust it could become more difficult to\nfind those soft spots.\n\n\n-----\n\nResearchers at Recorded Future say they believe the ALPHV/BlackCat author was\npreviously involved with the infamous REvil ransomware cartel in some capacity. Earlier this\nmonth the Russian government announced that at the United States’ request it arrested 14\nindividuals in Russia thought to be REvil operators.\n\nStill, REvil rolls on despite these actions, according to Paul Roberts at [ReversingLabs. “The](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/after-russian-arrests-revil-rolls-on?utm_campaign=FY22-Q1-CO-Blog-After%20Russian%20Arrests%20REvil%20Rolls%20On&utm_source=earnedmedia&utm_medium=pr&utm_content=blog)\nrecent arrests have NOT led to a noticeable change in detections of REvil malicious files,”\nRoberts wrote. “In fact, detections of files and other software modules associated with the\nREvil ransomware increased modestly in the week following the arrests by Russia’s FSB\nintelligence service.”\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. State Department has [a standing $10 million reward for information](https://www.state.gov/reward-offers-for-information-to-bring-sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-variant-co-conspirators-to-justice/)\nleading to the identification or location of any individuals holding key leadership positions in\nREvil.\n\n## WHO IS BINRS?\n\nA confidential source recently had a private conversation with a support representative who\nfields questions and inquiries on several cybercrime forums on behalf of a large and popular\nransomware affiliate program. The affiliate rep confirmed that a coder for ALPHV was known\nby the handle “Binrs” on multiple Russian-language forums.\n\nOn the cybercrime forum RAMP, the user Binrs says they are a Rust developer who’s been\ncoding for 6 years. “My stack is Rust, nodejs, php, golang,” Binrs said in an introductory post,\nin which they claim to be fluent in English. Binrs then signs the post with their identification\n[number for ToX, a peer-to-peer instant messaging service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tox_(protocol))\n\nThat same ToX ID was claimed by a user called “smiseo” on the Russian forum BHF, in\n[which smiseo advertises “clipper” malware written in Rust that](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rustclipper.png) swaps in the attacker’s bitcoin\naddress when the victim copies a cryptocurrency address to their computer’s temporary\nclipboard.\n\nThe nickname “YBCat” [advertised that same ToX ID on Carder[.]uk, where this user claimed](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ybcatcookiedays.png)\nownership over the Telegram account @CookieDays, and said they could be hired to do\nsoftware and bot development “of any level of complexity.” YBCat mostly sold “installs,”\noffering paying customers to ability to load malware of their choice on thousands of hacked\ncomputers simultaneously.\n\nThere is also an active user named Binrs on the Russian crime forum wwh-club[.]co who\nsays they’re a Rust coder who can be reached at the @CookieDays Telegram account.\n\nOn the Russian forum Lolzteam, a member with the username “DuckerMan” uses the\n@CookieDays Telegram account in his signature. In one thread, DuckerMan promotes an\naffiliate program called CookieDays that lets people make money by getting others to install\n\n\n-----\n\ncryptomining programs that are infected with malware. In another thread, DuckerMan is\nselling a different clipboard hijacking program called Chloe Clipper.\n\nThe CookieDays moneymaking program.\n\n[According to threat intelligence firm Flashpoint, the Telegram user DuckerMan employed](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/)\nanother alias — Sergey Duck. These accounts were most active in the Telegram channels\n“Bank Accounts Selling,” “Malware developers community,” and “Raidforums,” a popular\nEnglish-language cybercrime forum\n\n\n-----\n\n## I AM DUCKERMAN\n\nThe GitHub account for a [Sergey DuckerMan lists dozens of code repositories this user has](https://github.com/DuckerMan)\nposted online over the years. The majority of these projects were written in Rust, and the rest\nin PHP, Golang and Nodejs — the same coding languages specified by Binrs on RAMP. The\nSergey DuckerMan GitHub account also says it is associated with the “DuckerMan” account\non Telegram.\n\nSergey DuckerMan’s GitHub profile.\n\nSergey DuckerMan has left many accolades for other programmers on GitHub — 460 to be\nexact. In June 2020, for example, DuckerMan gave a star to a proof-of-concept ransomware\nstrain written in Rust.\n\nSergey DuckerMan’s Github profile says their social media account at Vkontakte (Russian\nversion of Facebook/Meta) is vk.com/duckermanit. That profile is restricted to friends-only,\nbut states that it belongs to a Sergey Pechnikov from [Shuya, Russia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuya,_Ivanovo_Oblast)\n\n[A look at the Duckermanit VKontakte profile in Archive.org shows that until recently it bore a](https://web.archive.org/web/20191118232152/https://vk.com/duckermanit)\ndifferent name: Sergey Kryakov. The current profile image on the Pechnikov account shows\na young man standing closely next to a young woman.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity reached out to Pechnikov in transliterated Russian via the instant message\nfeature built into VKontakte.\n\n\n-----\n\nI ve heard about ALPHV, Pechnikov replied in English. It sounds really cool and I m glad\nthat Rust becomes more and more popular, even in malware sphere. But I don’t have any\nconnections with ransomware at all.”\n\nI began explaining the clues that led to his VK account, and how a key cybercriminal actor in\nthe ransomware space had confirmed that Binrs was a core developer for the ALPHV\nransomware.\n\n“Binrs isn’t even a programmer,” Pechnikov interjected. “He/she can’t be a DuckerMan. I am\nDuckerMan.”\n\n**BK: Right. Well, according to Flashpoint, the Telegram user DuckerMan also used the alias**\nSergey Duck.\n\n**Sergey: Yep, that’s me.**\n\n**BK: So you can see already how I arrived at your profile?**\n\n**Sergey: Yep, you’re a really good investigator.**\n\n**BK: I noticed this profile used to have a different name attached to it. A ‘Sergey Kryakov.’**\n\n**Sergey: It was my old surname. But I hated it so much I changed it.**\n\n**BK: What did you mean Binrs isn’t even a programmer?**\n\n**Sergey: I haven’t found any [of] his accounts on sites like GitHub/stack overflow. I’m not**\nsure, does binrs sell Rust Clipper?\n\n**BK: So you know his work! I take it that despite all of this, you maintain you are not involved**\nin coding malware?\n\n**Sergey: Well, no, but I have some “connections” with these guys. Speaking about Binrs, I’ve**\nbeen researching his personality since October too.\n\n**BK: Interesting. What made you want to research his personality? Also, please help me**\nunderstand what you mean by “connections.”\n\n**Sergey: I think he is actually a group of some people. I’ve written him on telegram from**\ndifferent accounts, and his way of speaking is different. Maybe some of them somehow tied\nwith ALPHV. But on forums (I’ve checked only XSS and Exploit) his ways of speaking are the\nsame.\n\n**BK: …..**\n\n**Sergey: I don’t know how to explain this. By the way, binrs now is really silent, I think he’s**\nlying low. Well, this is all I know.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo doubt he is. I enjoyed speaking with Sergey, but I also had difficulty believing most of\nwhat he said. Also, I was bothered that Sergey hadn’t exactly disputed the logic behind the\nclues that led to his VK account. In fact, he’d stated several times that he was impressed\nwith the investigation.\n\nIn many [previous Breadcrumbs stories, it is common at this point for the interviewee to claim](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/breadcrumbs/)\nthey were being set up or framed. But Sergey never even floated the idea.\n\nI asked Sergey what might explain all these connections if he wasn’t somehow involved in\ncoding malicious software. His answer, our final exchange, was again equivocal.\n\n“Well, all I have is code on my github,” he replied. “So it can be used [by] anyone, but I don’t\nthink my projects suit for malwares.”\n\n**Update, Jan 29, 4:26 p.m. ET: Sergey Duckerman has deleted their GitHub account.**\nMeanwhile, the user Binrs has been (preemptively?) banning their profile from multiple\ncybercrime forums where they were previously active.\n\n\n-----",
