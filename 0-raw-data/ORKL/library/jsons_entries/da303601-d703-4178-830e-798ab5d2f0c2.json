The year 2020 marked the fifth year in which these schemes held the top\n[position on the annual FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report. Over half a decade,](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf)\nglobal losses ballooned from $360 million in 2016 to a staggering $1.8 billion in 2020. Put in\nperspective, the annual losses associated with BEC schemes now exceed the gross\ndomestic product (GDP) of 24 countries. Of greater concern, the combined losses in the\nthree year period 2018-2020 are now estimated to be in excess of $4.93 billion worldwide.\nThis threat shows no sign of slowing down, as losses increased 29% last year to an average\nof $96,372 per victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nOver the past half decade, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has actively monitored the evolution\nof this threat with a unique focus on threat actors based in Nigeria, which we track under the\n[name “SilverTerrier.” While BEC is a global threat, our focus on Nigerian actors provides](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0083/)\ninsights into one of the largest subcultures of this malign activity, given the country’s\nconsistent ranking as one of the top hotspots for cybercrime. We have compiled one of the\nmost comprehensive data sets across the cybersecurity industry, with over 170,700 samples\nof malware from over 2.26 million phishing attacks, linked to roughly 540 distinct clusters of\nBEC activity.\n\nSince 2016, we have witnessed several high profile arrests of BEC actors, including two\narrests of actors accused of stealing $24 million and $60 million respectively. Simultaneously,\nNigeria has demonstrated significant growth and outcomes in terms of driving reductions in\nhow brazenly these actors operate. Leveraging our data set, we continue to actively partner\nwith and support industry, government and international law enforcement efforts to combat\nthis threat.\n\nThis blog provides a brief history of BEC, examines the evolution of SilverTerrier actors over\ntime, identifies recent malware trends, describes efforts taken to date to combat this activity\nand provides recommendations to help organizations protect against these threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against the types of BEC threats discussed in\nthis blog by products including Cortex XDR and the WildFire, Threat Prevention, AutoFocus\nand URL Filtering subscription services for the Next-Generation Firewall.\n\n## Defining Business Email Compromise\n\nBefore describing the evolution of BEC, it is important to establish a baseline definition of the\nthreat. Given its name, many often mistakenly assume BEC encompasses any and all\ninstances of computer intrusions where an email system is compromised. However, this\ndefinition could easily apply to almost any computer incident, ranging from supply chain\nattacks to ransomware, and is therefore far too broad.\n\nConversely, [law enforcement and the cybersecurity industry rely on a much narrower](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise)\ndefinition. Specifically, BEC is considered a category of threat activity involving sophisticated\nscams which target legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or\ncomputer intrusion activities. Once businesses are compromised, cybercriminals leverage\ntheir access to initiate or redirect the transfer of business funds for personal gain. The\nremainder of this blog applies this narrow definition of threat activity.\n\n## Recent History\n\nThe term “business email compromise'' was first coined in 2013 when the FBI began tracking\na nascent financial cyberthreat. At the time, BEC was simply viewed as a new cybercrime\ntechnique joining the ranks of other unsophisticated schemes, for example, the notorious\n\n\n-----\n\nNigerian Prince scams. Yet, with the benefit of time, we have come to see that BEC was a\ncultural and technological evolution for the cybercrime ecosystem. The internet experienced\nunprecedented growth in a compressed time frame (2009-2013), much of which continues\ntoday. However, what is often overlooked is that the most significant growth during that\nperiod of time occurred in developing regions of the world. African nations, in particular, grew\n[at the fastest rate with 27% annual growth, and by the end of 2013, an estimated 16% of the](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf)\nAfrican population was online.\n\nConcurrently, we also witnessed a proliferation of commodity information stealers, remote\naccess trojans (RATs) and penetration testing tools. These capabilities were supplemented\nwith the emergence of cyber certification programs and educational resources, both online\nand in universities, for how to use these types of tools. It thus becomes readily apparent how\nactors involved in traditional forms of paper-based mail fraud (Nigerian Prince/advanced fee\nscams), originating from developing nations, would naturally evolve their tactics to the\ninternet using the newly available tools at their disposal. From a criminal standpoint, it was\nno longer effective or efficient to send thousands of paper letters through the international\nmail system and wait for a response. By the end of 2013, they could communicate in real\ntime over the internet and simply send victims malicious files, which enabled their desired\ncriminal outcomes.\n\nUnit 42 has been following this evolution for the past six years. In 2014 we released our first\nreport, [419 Evolution, documenting one the first known cases of Nigerians deploying](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-new-era-threat-intelligence/)\nmalware for financial gain. In 2016, we performed focused research on the threat and quickly\ndiscovered it had grown to over one hundred different actors or groups. After assigning the\ncode name “SilverTerrier” to Nigerian cyber actors, we detailed the tremendous growth of\n[both actors and malware adoption in The Next Evolution of Nigerian Cybercrime.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/silverterrier-next-evolution-nigerian-cybercrime)\n\nIn 2017, the threat continued to expand to over 300 actors or groups, and we began to track\nspecific malware tool trends in our annual report, The Rise of Nigerian Business Email\nCompromise. Our 2018 report, “SilverTerrier: 2018 Nigerian Business Email Compromise\nUpdate,” documented that the number of actors surpassed 400, as the number of attempted\nattacks against our customers climbed to an average of 28,227 per month. Additionally, we\nbegan to observe a shift away from simple information stealers as more actors started to\nembrace RATs, which afforded greater capabilities.\n\nBy the end of 2019, this shift in tools had progressed to an established trend, as\ninformational stealer usage declined steadily, while RAT adoption grew an impressive 140%\nyear over year. Our annual [report in 2019 also highlighted the emergence of the first set of](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2019-update/)\nNigerian tool developers natively developing their own RATs and crypting tools for sale to\ntheir peers.\n\nFinally, as we entered 2020 and began to feel the effects from the global COVID-19\n[pandemic, we documented yet another milestone as threat groups paused their traditional](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-covid-19-themed-business-email-compromise/)\ninvoice- and package delivery-related phishing campaigns, in favor of pandemic-related\n\n\n-----\n\nthemes. In doing so, BEC actors once again demonstrated their ability to adapt to the everchanging environment in which they operate.\n\n## Actors\n\nWhat started as a small cluster of activity in 2014 has grown significantly in scope and scale\nover the past seven years. To date, we have identified 540 distinct clusters of activity which\nwe associate with Nigerian actors and groups. Seeking to understand these actors and their\nbehaviors better, in 2016 we worked to identify commonalities among the actors. At the time,\nwe thought that our efforts would confirm existing stereotypes – that these actors were\nsimply young, unorganized script kiddies whose success was based more on luck than skill.\nThroughout our research we instead found that the actors were:\n\nLiving Comfortably – The actors were predominantly from the cities of Owerri, Lagos,\nEnugu, Warri and Port Harcourt in the southwest/coastal region of Nigeria. The majority\nstayed close to friends and family, where they lived quite comfortably based on the\nfavorable exchange rate between foreign currency and the Nigerian naira. Their social\nmedia accounts often flaunted their criminal successes with pictures of foreign\ncurrency, huge homes and luxury vehicles such as Range Rovers. Additionally, some\nof the more successful actors traveled abroad to places like the United Kingdom and\nMalaysia, where they quickly reestablished their criminal operations.\nEducated – Many of the actors had attended technical secondary school and went on\nto obtain undergraduate degrees from federal or regionally aligned technical university\nprograms.\nAdults – The actors ranged in age from late teenage years to adults in their mid-40s,\nthus representing a wide range of generations participating in the criminal activity. The\nolder actors were often found to have evolved to BEC activity from other legacy forms\nof advanced fee scams, while the younger actors graduating with fresh university\ndegrees began their criminal careers by jumping straight into malware campaigns.\nNot Hiding – While a small subset of the actors went to great lengths to conceal their\nidentities, the culture within Nigeria at the time allowed for a permissive environment for\nthese types of illicit activities. As a result, the actors frequently applied little effort\ntoward maintaining anonymity and often combined fake names or aliases with local\nstreet addresses, phone numbers and personal email addresses when registering their\nmalicious domains. In doing so, we found that it was often easy to link these users to\ntheir social media and networking accounts on platforms such as Facebook, Google+,\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Skype, Yahoo Messenger and so on.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecoming Organized – Early in the evolution of BEC, we saw that small clusters of\nactors were beginning to communicate, cooperate, and share tools and techniques.\nMost commonly, this took the form of an experienced actor standing up malware\ninfrastructure for their friends or younger protégés. Alternatively, we saw actors\nsponsoring other actors for access to hacking forums, but while there were\noccasionally large groups of actors working together, such cases were believed to be\nrare.\n\nUnit 42 is revisiting this historical assessment in 2021, and our analysis provides unique\ninsights into how these actors have evolved over time. By and large, the actors are still living\ncomfortably. Those who were most active in 2016 have grown up; they are now married,\nhave children and have launched legitimate business ventures (hotels, clubs, technology\ncompanies, etc.) that were potentially funded through their previous criminal exploits. For\nthose who chose to depart Nigeria, we observed relocation to additional countries in the\nMiddle East, such as Turkey and the UAE.\n\nThe majority of the actors continue to be well educated, having completed both secondary\nand university programs. As these actors age, we see a notable decline in criminal activity as\nactors reach their mid to late 30s. While the exact reason is difficult to pinpoint, we believe\nthat the decline may be due in part to actor maturation, including an interest in reducing risks\nas they start families, or simply that they have earned enough through their criminal exploits\nthat they wish to pivot to legitimate business ventures. Conversely, it's also worth noting that\nwe rarely see young children or teenagers involved in this type of malicious activity. New\nactors entering the space tend to be in their late teens and early 20s. On the younger side,\ntechnical skills and education, more than anything, remain a firm barrier to entry for this type\nof criminal activity.\n\nHalf a decade of change in Nigeria, as well as improved global awareness of the BEC threat,\nhave had a positive effect in driving reductions in how brazenly these actors operate. The\nNigeria Police Force (NFP) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have\ndemonstrated significant growth and outcomes in their efforts to combat this threat and\n[routinely post pictures of the actors they arrest on Twitter accounts. Aiding their efforts,](https://twitter.com/officialefcc)\norganizations like INTERPOL, the FBI and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) have worked\nto collaborate internationally to enable global prosecution efforts. Concurrently, in the\ntechnology space, there have been mixed developments as collaborative platforms like\nYahoo Messenger and Google+ were retired, while privacy improvements across social\nmedia platforms have impacted attribution efforts. As for the actors themselves, they have\nfaced growing awareness of the risks associated with their criminal activity as the culture in\nNigeria has evolved. While social media accounts may still flaunt their wealth, today it is far\nless common to see the posts openly discussing illegal activities, pictures of foreign currency\nor other content that may draw unwanted law enforcement attention.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, BEC actors have become far more organized over time. While it remains easy to\nfind actors working as a group, the practice of using one phone number, email address or\nalias to register malicious infrastructure in support of multiple actors has made it far more\ntime consuming (but not impossible) for cybersecurity and law enforcement organizations to\nsort out which actors committed specific crimes. Similarly, we continue to find that\nSilverTerrier actors, regardless of geographical location, are often connected through only a\nfew degrees of separation on social media platforms. To illustrate that case, Figure 1 shows\nsocial media connections between over 120 actors.\n\nFigure 1. Link analysis of SilverTerrier actors.\nBeyond the generalized actor trends identified above, we believe it is helpful to also examine\nindividual actors in order to provide a more comprehensive portrayal of the modern BEC\nthreat actor. Please consider the following examples:\n\nExample A – Onuegwu Ifeanyi, also known as “SSG Toolz,'' was [arrested by the NFP](https://npf.gov.ng/information/pressdetails.php?news_id=509)\nin November 2020. Having studied computer science at Imo State University, he\nlaunched Ifemonums-Solution LTD as a legitimate business venture in late 2014. That\nsame year, he began his criminal activities, and from 2014 until his arrest, he registered\nover 150 malicious domains for personal use and to support other actors. Examples\ninclude us-military-service[.]com, starwooclhotels[.]com, and gulf-capital[.]net. Many of\nthese domains also served as command and control infrastructure for over 2,200\nsamples of malware, including Pony, LokiBot, PredatorPain, ISRStealer, ISpySoftware,\nRemcos and NanoCore. In 2016, he was one of the most active members in the nowdefunct “wirewire com” Facebook group, having sponsored 30 other actors to a group\nfocused on performing fraudulent wire transfers. Today his social media portrays a\nsuccessful businessman, married, with children, driving a Range Rover and traveling\nthe world to places like France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Malta.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Onuegwu Ifeanyi posing next to a Plymouth Prowler.\n\nExample B – This individual also studied at Imo State University. Between 2015 and\n2018, he registered 180 domains using a mailing address associated with Jakarta,\nIndonesia. Several of these domains served as command and control servers for at\nleast 55 samples of malware. Aside from revealing that he also owns a Range Rover,\nhis social media account shows that the EFCC attempted to arrest him in 2018. While\nthe arrest details are unknown, this actor felt compelled to boast about his release\nafterwards.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Actor boasting after his arrest.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample C – This actor studied at Lagos State University, is in his 20s and is\nunmarried. From 2016 to the present, he has registered 55 malicious domains. These\ndomains are linked to over 480 samples of malware. Furthermore, based on the names\nof the domains, it appears that this actor is likely providing infrastructure to support\nother actors. Examples include: 247logss[.]info, fergologss[.]us, kinglogss[.]info, and\nnelsloggs[.]com. Serving as the exception to the rule, this actor is also quite public\nabout his activities on social media. In 2017 he maintained a Facebook account with a\nbackground image that said “certified cybercriminal.” Presently, his personal Facebook\naccount contains a background image of the Guy Fawkes/Anonymous mask.\n\nFigure 4a. A 2017\n\nFacebook profile picture.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4b. A 2021 Facebook profile picture.\n\n## Malware and Business Email Compromise\n\nFrom 2014 to the present, we have identified over 170,700 samples of malware directly\nattributed to Nigerian BEC actors. Representatively, this data set serves as the most\ncomprehensive collection of BEC indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the cybersecurity\nindustry. These samples have been observed in over 2.26 million phishing attacks targeting\nour customers across all industry verticals globally.\n\nOver time, we have taken steps to characterize trends from this data set to empower network\ndefenders. We observed that the period 2014-2017 was marked by steady growth in the\nadoption of information stealers like Pony, LokiBot, and AgentTesla. This was then followed\nby a decline in recent years as tool availability declined, and both industry detection rates\nand the technical skills of actors improved. As such, from 2018-2020, we witnessed a rapid\nadoption of RATs, with the most popular being NanoCore, Adwind, Remcos, Netwire and a\nhome grown/Nigerian-developed variant of HWorm called WSH RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nYet while we continue to see steady growth and adoption of RATs by SilverTerrier actors, our\nanalysis of telemetry from 2020 through the first half of 2021 found it was also important to\nconsider the influence that the global ecosystem has on their activity. In a pre-COVID world,\nit made sense to highlight new tools annually, as there were frequent changes in tools\nmarketed to actors on cybercrime forums. While that continued to a certain extent throughout\nthe pandemic, the reality is that we didn’t observe any significant shift among BEC actors\ntoward new tools or capabilities over the past year and a half. Instead, our telemetry shows\nthat these actors generally opted to stick with known tools with demonstrated capabilities and\nperformance. In doing so, they focused their attention on adapting and tailoring their delivery\ncampaigns to the shifting global environment.\n\nIf asked to consider the impact of the pandemic from a technology standpoint, many would\nquickly point out that much of the global workforce shifted to remote work arrangements.\nDepending on the size and resources of employers, employees began leveraging VPN\nsolutions, employer-provided or personal computing devices, and home internet connections.\nThese developments significantly changed how cybersecurity protections were applied\nacross enterprises, more than any other event in the last decade. Furthermore, this shift may\nhave even influenced employee risk tolerance (e.g. increased suspicion of phishing emails),\nas their work devices were now connected to their home networks. As a result, BEC actors\nsaw a massive shift in the global attack surface that necessitated a change in their delivery\nthemes and techniques.\n\nIn 2019 it was common to see BEC actors build new malware payloads as portable\nexecutable files (.exe files) and distribute them using phishing campaigns with business\nthemes such as invoices or delivery notices. At the time, Microsoft Office file formats were\nalso leveraged on occasion, adding a layer of complexity and obfuscation. Two of the most\ncommon techniques used in developing these documents included exploit code for CVE2017-11882 or embedding a malicious macro. In both cases, upon opening, these\ndocuments were designed to call out, download and run a malicious payload from an online\nresource. However, across the totality of the samples we analyzed in 2019, only 3.5% used\nmacros and only 3.6% used the CVE-2017-11882 technique.\n\nAs early as January 2020, phishing lures began to change to themes associated with the\npandemic. Examples include “Coronavirus in Indonesia: Know how to protect and prevent\nyourself. Don’t get infected” and “Covid:19 Facial Masks - New Order.” As the themes\nchanged, so too did the target audience and delivery packaging. Portable executables\nremained popular, but we observed a marked increase in Microsoft Word and Excel\ndocuments. By the end of the year, Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros\nremained steady at 3.5%, but documents utilizing the familiar and well-documented CVE2017-11882 climbed to 13.5%.\n\nFortunately, CVE-2017-11882 is now a four-year-old vulnerability, and it makes sense that its\neffectiveness, and therefore its use, would fade over time. Conversely, macros have a more\nlasting presence as they are relatively easy to code and rely on unsuspecting victims to\n\n\n-----\n\nenable them. In reviewing our telemetry from the first half of 2021, our preliminary findings\nshow only a minimal number of malware samples using the CVE technique, while 69% of all\nmalware samples are now Office documents with embedded macros.\n\nWe know that the global pandemic has driven exponential change in various technologies\nsupporting remote work (cloud computing, video conferencing, etc.). At the same time, we\nalso acknowledge that the astonishing growth curve of malware packaged as Office\ndocuments – climbing from a combined 7% in 2019, to 17% in 2020, to 69% in 2021 –\nwarrants further investigation. Taking a deeper look, we found that the raw number of\nmalware samples packaged as Office documents halfway through 2021 already meets or far\nexceeds the annual number of samples we observed in previous years. As such, we remain\nconfident that there is a definitive growth trend.\n\nAt the same time, we believe it is also critically important to understand that between mid2020 and early 2021, almost every business on the planet revised their cybersecurity\nposture, changed appliances in their environment, re-architected their network traffic flows,\nand tightened their network security policies to support remote work practices. The effect of\nthese changes must be considered when analyzing threat trends. Applied in combination and\nat a macro level, these adjustments significantly altered the visibility of threats across both\nthe perimeter (firewall) and host (endpoint) levels. For example, attachments that may have\nbeen permitted following cybersecurity analysis in a corporate work environment may have\nbecome blocked by default in a remote work environment. Depending on implementation,\nsuch a change would reduce the visibility of threats for a cybersecurity company. Thus, it is\nnearly impossible to draw an even comparison between pre- and post-pandemic threat\nactivity, as the collection posture across the entirety of the cybersecurity industry has shifted\ndramatically. We applied this lesson to our observations of malicious Office documents and\nassessed that our preliminary findings of 69% for 2021 are likely artificially inflated due to\nchanges in collection posture over the past year. However, even after accounting for any\nartificial inflation, a clear growth pattern remains worthy of recognition by network defenders.\n\n## Combating BEC\n\nAs a global cybersecurity leader, Palo Alto Networks aggressively pursues its mission to be\nthe cybersecurity partner of choice while protecting our digital way of life. In doing so, our\nfocus extends well beyond the protections that our products and services provide to our\ncustomers. We seek to provide thought leadership and threat intelligence broadly across the\ncommunity, while simultaneously working with law enforcement entities worldwide to thwart\nfuture threats.\n\nWe are not alone in our vision for stopping malicious cyber activity. Over the past few years,\nthe cybersecurity community has teamed with law enforcement to achieve successful\noutcomes against this threat on several occasions. As a leader in the industry, we continue\nto promote such efforts and encourage others across our industry to do the same. One\n\n\n-----\n\n[notable example is a joint arrest by Interpol and the EFCC in 2016 of an actor who stole](https://www.interpol.int/es/Noticias-y-acontecimientos/Noticias/2016/Ringleader-of-global-network-behind-thousands-of-online-scams-arrested-in-Nigeria)\nmore than $60 million from hundreds of victims, including $15.4 million from just one\norganization.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, the FBI launched its first global campaign targeting BEC actors,\nwhich it called Operation WireWire. Over the course of six months and in close collaboration\nwith Palo Alto Networks, FlashPoint, the National Cyber Forensics Training Alliance (NCFTA)\n[and several others, law enforcement agencies were able to arrest 74 actors worldwide.](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/losangeles/news/press-releases/business-e-mail-compromise-bec-task-force-in-los-angeles-announces-local-arrests-as-the-department-of-justice-announces-the-results-of-operation-wire-wire-including-74-charged-in-bec-schemes-internationally-)\nBuilding off this trailblazing effort, a year later the FBI launched Operation Rewired, in which\n[another 281 actors were arrested worldwide. This included 167 individuals that were arrested](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/281-arrested-worldwide-coordinated-international-enforcement-operation-targeting-hundreds)\nin Nigeria in close coordination with the EFCC.\n\nIn June 2020, a Nigerian social media influencer who goes by the handle “Hushpuppi” was\narrested in Dubai. Though he was known for influencer activities such as posing next to\n[private jets and luxury cars, he was subsequently indicted by the FBI for stealing over $24](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/six-indicted-international-scheme-defraud-qatari-school-founder-and-then-launder-over-1)\nmillion.\n\nFigure 5. Hushpuppi’s\n\nsocial media photo.\nAround the same time, we witnessed a significant shift in how U.S. law enforcement entities\nviewed the challenge of BEC actors operating beyond their reach internationally. While\narrests and prosecutions are a vital part of the law enforcement process, it's also important to\nacknowledge that BEC is not a problem that we can solve solely through arrests. Other\ninstruments of national power should be applied to this problem set. In June 2020, the United\n[States Attorney's Office in the District of Nebraska opted to apply U.S. Treasury sanctions to](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ne/pr/u-s-attorney-kelly-and-s-c-johnson-announce-unsealing-scam-indictments-and-treasury)\nsix Nigerian BEC actors for the first time. This action was novel in that it demonstrated an\nability to impose a cost on foreign cybercriminals by directly denying access to U.S. financial\nsystems. It further made it illegal for individuals and organizations to transfer funds to these\nactors and significantly raised the consequences for money mules and others that assisted\nthese actors in their crimes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a final example, in November 2020, Interpol, in conjunction with the NFP, [arrested three](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Three-arrested-as-INTERPOL-Group-IB-and-the-Nigeria-Police-Force-disrupt-prolific-cybercrime-group)\nNigerian actors accused of using 26 different malware families to conduct BEC activities\nagainst victims in over 150 countries. Although the total losses are unknown, at the time of\nthe arrest, law enforcement agents discovered a list of 50,000 victims targeted over the\ncourse of four years.\n\nCombined, these examples highlight several of the major industry successes in combating\nBEC activities over the years. Consequently, they also cause us to pause and reflect on the\nchallenges of combating this threat and the financial motives driving its continued existence.\nIn terms of the latter, there is often speculation that because of the technical skills of these\nactors, it would be devastating if they began adopting ransomware. While such a transition is\ntechnically feasible, it is also unlikely for two reasons. First, BEC activities in Nigeria and\nelsewhere evolved from advanced fee style scams. These scams were generally considered\nculturally permissible in many places as they were perceived to be akin to jokes, pranks or\nfooling victims into transferring funds. Conversely, activities demanding ransom payments do\nnot fit this model and tend to be culturally and ethically incongruent with this population of\ncyber actors. More specifically, it is common to see Nigerian actors speak out in disdain\nagainst kidnapping and other ransom-demanding events in their home country. Second, and\nequally important, it’s difficult to justify a financial motive for BEC actors to switch to\nransomware. The examples above show two actors making $60 million and $24 million\nrespectively from their BEC activities. Compare those numbers with the recent Colonial\n[Pipeline ransomware event in which DarkSide demanded $4.4 million and kept almost none](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/darkside-ransomware/)\nof it. It becomes easy to see why pursuing higher-risk, higher-visibility activities like\nransomware may not be as appealing or financially profitable as the current BEC status quo.\n\nFinally, as it applies to combating this threat, our experience has shown that the largest\nchallenge is, surprisingly, the ability of law enforcement to identify victims. Given how these\nschemes work, most victims don’t discover the fraudulent wire transfer until days, weeks or\nmonths later. By that time, calling local authorities to investigate is often a moot point, as\nfunds are irrecoverable, and therefore many victims opt not to report the crimes. Conversely,\nfrom the vantage point of law enforcement, BEC is a relatively unique form of cybercrime in\nthat the actors perpetrating the crimes are often easily identifiable. Thus, in a reversal of\nexpectations, it is common for investigators to spend considerable time and resources trying\nto find victims in their specific legal jurisdictions, as the actors themselves and their malware\ncampaigns are already known. Because of this gap, we would conclude by encouraging all\norganizations who experience a BEC loss to report the event, regardless of timing or\n[circumstances, to organizations like the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so will](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/FileComplaint)\ntremendously aid efforts to continue combating this threat in the future.\n\n## Protections and Mitigations\n\nThe best defense against these evolving threats is a security posture that favors prevention.\nWe recommend that organizations implement preventative practices including:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Review network security policies, focusing on the types of files (portable executables,\n\ndocuments with macros, etc.) that employees can download and open on devices\nattached to company networks. Additionally, as a best practice, URL filtering rules\nshould be established to restrict access by default to the following categories of\ndomains: Newly Registered, Insufficient Content, Dynamic DNS, Parked and Malware.\n2. Routinely review mail server configurations, employee mail settings and connection\n\nlogs. Focus efforts on identifying employee mail-forwarding rules and identifying foreign\nor abnormal connections to mail servers. When possible, consider implementing geo-IP\nblocking. For example, small local businesses do not need to allow logon attempts from\nforeign countries where they have no employees.\n3. Conduct employee training. Routine cyberthreat awareness training is one component;\n\nhowever, organizations should also consider tailored training focused on their sales\nand finance components. Such training should require all wire transfer requests to be\nvalidated using verified and established points of contact for suppliers, vendors and\npartners.\n4. Conduct tabletop exercises and rehearsal investigations with the intent of determining\n\nsources of evidence, as well as gaps in the types of evidence needed, and establishing\nreporting points of contact for the appropriate authorities. Additionally, rehearsals\nshould validate familiarity with the financial fraud kill chain and make clear that staff\nknow which personnel are responsible for enacting it.\n5. Conduct compromise assessments on an annual or more frequent basis to test\n\norganizational controls and validate that there is no unauthorized activity occurring in\nthe environment. By reviewing mailbox rules and user login patterns on a regular basis,\nthese assessments can verify that controls are functioning as expected and that\nunwanted behaviors are being effectively blocked throughout the environment.\n\nFinally, for Palo Alto Networks customers, our products and services provide several\ncapabilities designed to thwart BEC attempts, including:\n\n**[Cortex XDR protects endpoints from all malware, exploits and fileless attacks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)**\n**associated with SilverTerrier actors.**\n\n**[WildFire® cloud-based threat analysis service accurately identifies samples](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)**\n**associated with information stealers, RATs and Microsoft Office document**\n**packaging techniques used by these actors.**\n\n**[Threat Prevention provides protection against the known client and server-](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)**\n**side vulnerability exploits, malware and command and control infrastructure**\n**used by these actors, including CVE-2017-11882**\n\n**[Advanced URL Filtering identifies all phishing and malware domains](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering)**\n**associated with these actors and proactively flags new infrastructure**\n**associated with these actors before it is weaponized.**\n\n**[Users of AutoFocus™ contextual threat intelligence service can view](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)**\n**[malware associated with these attacks using the SilverTerrier tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SilverTerrier)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBEC schemes remain the most profitable and widespread form of cybercrime on the internet\ntoday. Last year, global losses from these crimes eclipsed $1.8 billion, and the threat shows\nno sign of slowing down. Reviewing the recent history of the threat, we have observed\npositive changes in the ecosystem as the culture in countries like Nigeria has become less\ntolerant of these activities, and law enforcement entities have stepped up their efforts to find,\narrest and prosecute these actors. There is still plenty of work to be done to combat this\nthreat as it shifts toward new delivery techniques in our rapidly evolving world.\nCommensurate with all of the changes we have seen and implemented in the cybersecurity\ndomain over the past year, we encourage all organizations to invest in a thorough review of\ncontrols they have in place to protect against this threat.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n2014 – [419 Evolution](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-new-era-threat-intelligence/)\n2016 – [SilverTerrier: The Next Evolution in Nigerian Cybercrime](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/silverterrier-next-evolution-nigerian-cybercrime)\n2017 – [SilverTerrier: The Rise of Nigerian Business Email Compromise](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/whitepapers/unit42-silverterrier-rise-of-nigerian-business-email-compromise.html)\n2018 – [SilverTerrier: 2018 Nigerian Business Email Compromise Update](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2018-nigerian-business-email-compromise/)\n2019 – [SilverTerrier: 2019 Nigerian Business Email Compromise Update](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2019-update/)\n2020 – [SilverTerrier: New COVID-19 Themed Business Email Compromise Schemes](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-covid-19-themed-business-email-compromise/)\n2021 – [Credential Harvesting at Scale Without Malware](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/credential-harvesting/)\n[Mitre: SilverTerrier Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0083/)\n[Unit 42 - Business Email Compromise - Response Services](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42/incident-response/business-email-compromise)\n[Unit 42 - Business Email Compromise - Readiness Assessment](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/bec-readiness-assessment)\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
