Today we will follow the trail left by APT3’s infrastructure procurers and will\nidentify our first APT3 operator, Mr Wu.\n\n**Mr Wu**\n\nThe trail starts in 2010, when FireEye researchers analysing the Pirpi backdoor used by\nAPT3 identified a sample that communicated with the domain twadcorp[.]com. WHOIS\ninformation from late 2009 for this domain gives a registrant name: “Mr Wu”.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistoric\n\nWHOIS data showing “Mr Wu” as registrant of twadcorp[.]comMr Wu is not a particularly\nunique name – in fact “Wu” is [the 9th most common surname in China. But if we follow the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname)\ntrail ever further back in time we can also identify Mr Wu’s given name.\n**From APT3 to mxmtmw**\n\nTo continue the investigation, we need to examine a second Pirpi sample, this time one that\ncommunicates with the domain grayflag[.]net. WHOIS information for the domain from 2009\ngives the email address mxmtmw[at]gmail.com.\n\nHistoric\n\nWHOIS showing mxmtmw[at]gmail.com as a contact for grayflag[.]netTo confirm that we’re\nstill on the trail of a Cyber actor, the e-mail address also appeared in an online advert in\nChinese for Trojan development.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvert in Chinese offering development of customised Trojans\nLuckily for us, the string “mxmtmw” is fairly unique online and has also appeared elsewhere,\nincluding in a group called Ph4nt0m in 2008, a year before the Mr Wu registration entry for\ntwadcorp[.]com above. In one of those posts the mxmtmw string was used as the username\nof a poster, part of whose email address is visible in the archives as wuyin…[at]gmail.com.\n\nGoogle Group entry associating “mxmtmw” with wuyin…[at]gmail.comContinuing our journey\nback in time, a search on the wuyin partial email address reveals other posts related to the\nsame partial address. In one posting from 2007, the poster used a username more helpful to\nour cause: “wuyingzhuo”. Might this be the same Mr Wu?\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle Group entry showing poster wuyin…[at]gmail.com using username wuyingzhuoFrom\n**mxmtmw to wyz5678**\nTwo further domain name records can be used to confirm Yingzhuo as Mr Wu’s given name.\n\nReturning to the mxmtmw e-mail address, it also briefly appeared in registration data in mid2011 for the domain grayhat[.]cn. Another e-mail address that was associated with the same\ndomain (it appeared both before and after mxmtmw in the data) is wyz5678[at]163.net. “wyz”\npossibly stands for “wuyingzhuo”, the name we found in Google Groups.\n\nHistoric\n\nWHOIS showing relationship between mxmtmw and wyz5678\nThe wyz5678 e-mail address also appears in registration information for another domainname: ciscocorp[.]com which may lead us to a possible location for APT3.\n\n**Infrastructure in Guangdong, China**\n\nDNS analysis of the ciscocorp domain shows that ssl3.ciscocorp[.]com previously resolved to\nIP address 59.42.254[.]195. That IP is owned by “guangdong guangxin tongxin fuwu you”,\nwhich translates into English as the “Guangdong Guanxin Communications Services\n\n\n-----\n\nCompany, a wireless telecommunications services company in Guangdong, China. This is\npossibly an ISP used by APT3 and may give some clue as to the location of the group.\n\nHistoric\n\nDNS resolutions pointing to 59.42.254[.]195Wu Yingzhuo\nAs shown above, similar sub-domains of two other domain names – httb[.]net and\ncaelate[.]com – have also previously resolved to the same IP address. This is significant\nbecause the registered name in 2011 for both domains was “yingzhuo wu”.\n\nHistoric\n\nWHOIS for httb.net showing the registrant as yingzhuo wu\n**In summary, it is possible to follow domain name registration data from APT3 tools**\n**and domains to Wu Yingzhuo. Wu Yingzhuo might live or work in Guangdong, China,**\n**and has expressed an interest online in Trojan development.**\n\nWe intend to continue the trail from httb[.]net and to introduce you to a second member of\nAPT3. Read our next post for more truth behind this intrusion.\n\n\n-----",
