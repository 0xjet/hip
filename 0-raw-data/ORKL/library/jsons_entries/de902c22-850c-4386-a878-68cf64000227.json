When installed these attachments will encrypt a computer and append the .kk extension to encrypted files.\n\n While the use of WSF files to distribute malware is not uncommon, when I analyzed the script I noticed that the method being used to download and install the ransomware is quite interesting. This is because the WSF script will download images with embedded ZIP files that contain the necessary files to infect the computer with SyncCrypt. This method has also made the images undetectable by almost all antivirus vendors on VirusTotal.\n\n Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by SyncCrypt for free, but if you wish to receive help or discuss this ransomware, you can use our dedicated SyncCrypt Support Topic.\n\n## Images with Embedded Ransomware Evade Antivirus Detection\n\n#### At this time we have not been able to find the actual spam emails that are distributing the SyncCrypt downloader, but we do know that the WSF attachments are pretending to be court orders with file names like CourtOrder_845493809.wsf. When executed, these WSF files contain a JScript script that will download an image from one of three sites as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Download Images Script Source**\n\n#### If a user was to open one of these image URLs directly, they would just just see an image that contains the logo for Olafur Arnalds' album titled \"& They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness\".\n\n Embedded in this image, though, is a zip file containing the sync.exe, readme.html, and readme.png files. These files are the core components of the SyncCrypt ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hex Editor View of the Image File**\n\n#### After the image is downloaded to the %Temp% folder under a random named zip file, it will extract the files into the %Temp%\\BackupClient. The sync file is the executed to install the ransomware, which is discussed in the next section.\n\n\n-----\n\n**BackupClient Folder Containing Ransomware Components**\n\n#### What makes this distribution highly effective is that the majority of antivirus vendors are not detecting these image files. When I scanned these images files on VirusTotal, only DrWeb out of 58 other vendors detected it as malware.\n\n**VirusTotal Results**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### While the images alone are not malicious in any way, the distribution vector provides an effective way to distribute malware without being detected by security software. Thankfully, the malicious sync.exe executable has a much higher VirusTotal detection rate of 28 out of 63, but is still being missed by a great deal of popular vendors.\n\n## How the SyncCrypt Ransomware Encrypts Files\n\n#### Once the Sync.exe executable is extracted from the zip file as described above, the WSF file will create a Windows scheduled task called Sync that is configured to go off 1 minute after the WSF file is executed. Once the sync.exe file is executed it will scan the computer for certain file types and encrypt them using AES encryption. The AES key used to encrypt the files will be encrypted with an embedded RSA-4096 public encryption key as saved in %Desktop%\\README\\key.\n\n The targeted file types are:\n```\naccdb, accde, accdr, adp, ach, arw, asp, aspx, backup, backupdb, bak, bat, bay, bdb,\nbgt, blend, bmp, bpw, cdf, cdr, cdr3, cdr4, cdr5, cdr6, cdrw, cdx, cer, cfg, class,\ncls, config, contact, cpp, craw, crt, crw, css, csv, d3dbsp, dbx, dcr, dcs, dds, der,\ndif, dit, doc, docm, docx, dot, dotm, dotx, drf, drw, dwg, dxb, dxf, edb, eml, eps,\nfdb, flf, fpx, frm, gif, gpg, gry, hbk, hpp, html, hwp, jpe, jpeg, jpg, kdbx, kdc,\nkey, jar, java, laccdb, latex, ldf, lit, lua, mapimail, max, mbx, mdb, mfw, mlb, mml,\nmmw, midi, moneywell, mocha, mpp, nef, nml, nrw, oab, odb, odc, odf, odg, odi, odm,\nodp, ods, odt, otg, oth, otp, ots, p12, pas, pab, pbm, pcd, pct, pcx, pdf, pef, pem,\npfx, pgm, php, pict, pntg, potm, potx, ppam, ppm, pps, ppsm, ppsx, ppt, pptm, pptx,\nppz, prf, psd, ptx, pub, qbw, qbx, qpw, raf, rtf, safe, sav, save, sda, sdc, sdd,\nsdf, sdp, skp, sql, sqlite, sqlite3, sqlitedb, stc, std, sti, stm, stw, sxc, sxg,\nsxi, sxm, sxw, tex, txt, tif, tiff, vcf, wallet, wb1, wb2, wb3, wcm, wdb, wpd, wps,\nxlr, xls, xlsb, xlsm, xlsx, xlam, xlc, xlk, xlm, xlt, reg, rspt, profile, djv, djvu,\nms11, ott, pls, png, pst, xltm, xltx, xlw, xml, r00, 7zip, vhd, aes, ait, apk, arc,\nasc, asm, asset, awg, back, bkp, brd, bsa, bz2, csh, das, dat, dbf, db_journal, ddd,\nddoc, des, design, erbsql, erf, ffd, fff, fhd, fla, flac, iif, iiq, indd, iwi, jnt,\nkwm, lbf, litesql, lzh, lzma, lzo, lzx, m2ts, m4a, mdf, mid, mny, mpa, mpe, mpeg,\nmpg, mpga, mrw, msg, mvb, myd, myi, ndf, nsh, nvram, nxl, nyf, obj, ogg, ogv, p7b,\np7m, p7r, p7s, package, pages, pat, pdb, pdd, pfr, pnm, pot, psafe3, pspimage, pwm,\nqba, qbb, qbm, qbr, qby, qcow, qcow2, ram, rar, ras, rat, raw, rdb, rgb, rjs, rtx,\nrvt, rwl, rwz, scd, sch, scm, sd2, ser, shar, shw, sid, sit, sitx, skm, smf, snd,\nspl, srw, ssm, sst, stx, svg, svi, swf, tar, tbz, tbz2, tgz, tlz, txz, uop, uot, upk,\nustar, vbox, vbs, vcd, vdi, vhdx, vmdk, vmsd, vmx, vmxf, vob, vor, wab, wad, wav,\nwax, wbmp, webm, webp, wks, wma, wp5, wri, wsc, wvx, xpm, xps, xsd, zip, zoo, \n\n When a file is encrypted it will have the .kk extension appended to the filename. For example, a file named test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed as test.jpg.kk. You can see an example of an encrypted folder below.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**SyncCrypt Encrypted Files**\n\n#### While encrypting files, SyncCrypt will skip files located in the following folders:\n```\nwindows\\\nprogram files (x86)\\\nprogram files\\\nprogramdata\\\nwinnt\\\n\\system volume information\\\n\\desktop\\readme\\\n\\$recycle.bin\\\n\n When SyncCrypt has finished encrypting a computer, a folder called README will be present on the desktop. This folder contains the AMMOUNT.txt, key, readme.html, and readme.png files. The ammount.txt file is the ransom amount, the key is the encrypted decryption key, and the other two files are the ransom notes. SyncCrypt will then automatically open and display the readme.html ransom note in the victim's default browser as shown below.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**SyncCrypt Ransom Note**\n\n#### This ransom note will contain instructions to send a payment, which in my test was 0.1001270 bitcoins or ~429 USD, to the enclosed bitcoin address. After a payment has been made the victim is told to send an email containing the key file to one of the getmyfiles@keemail.me, getmyfiles@scryptmail.com, or getmyfiles@mail2tor.com emails to get a decrypter.\n\n Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files for free, but if you wish to receive help or discuss this ransomware, you can use our dedicated SyncCrypt Support Topic.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How to Protect Yourself from the SyncCrypt Ransomware\n\n#### In order to protect yourself from SyncCrypt, or from any ransomware, it is important that you use good computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware attack.\n\n You should also have security software that contains behavioral detections such as Emsisoft Anti-Malware or Malwarebytes. I also recommend trying a dedicated ransomware protection program like RansomFree.\n\n Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following good online security habits, which in many cases are the most important steps of all:\n\n Backup, Backup, Backup! Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them. Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them, Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal. Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors. Therefore it is important to keep them updated. Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed. Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\n For a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a Computer against Ransomware article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n#### Indian airline SpiceJet's flights impacted by ransomware attack\n\n US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting\n\n New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims\n\n Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students\n\n The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust\n\n## IOCs\n\n### File Hashes:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA256: 877488d8f43548c6e3016abd33e2d593a44d450f1910084733b3f369cbdcae85 (sync.exe)\nSHA256: 3049a568c1c1cd4d225f8f333bf05e4560c8f9de5f167201253fedf35142fe3e\n(CourtOrder_845493809.wsf)\nSHA256: c6565d22146045e52110fd0a13eba3b6b63fbf6583c444d7a5b4e3a368cc4b0d (image\nfiles)\n\n### Filenames associated with the SyncCrypt Ransomware Variant:\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\BackupClient\\\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\BackupClient\\tmp.bat\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\BackupClient\\sync.exe\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\BackupClient\\readme.html\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\BackupClient\\readme.png\n%UserProfile%\\Desktop\\README\\\n%UserProfile%\\Desktop\\README\\AMMOUNT.txt\n%UserProfile%\\Desktop\\README\\KEY\n%UserProfile%\\Desktop\\README\\readme.html\n%UserProfile%\\Desktop\\README\\readme.png\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\sync\nCourtOrder_[random].wsf\n\n Registry entries associated with the SyncCrypt Ransomware:\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule\\TaskCache\\Tasks\\{FE99549BA4F1-4534-9658-2AEAAE683D25}\\Path \\sync\n\n SyncCrypt Ransomware Ransom Note Text:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nYOUR FILES WERE ENCRYPTED\nusing military grade encryption.
