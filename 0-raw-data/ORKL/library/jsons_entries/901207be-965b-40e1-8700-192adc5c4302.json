    "plain_text": "# Sucuri Blog\n\n**[blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/fake-instagram-verification-twitter-badge-phishing.html](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/fake-instagram-verification-twitter-badge-phishing.html)**\n\nLuke Leal August 9, 2022\n\nSocial media platforms like Instagram and Twitter offer verification badges as a credibility\nindicator to help show authenticity and integrity to visitors. To obtain a badge, profiles must\nmeet a list of various requirements and undergo verification process.\n\n[For example, the one found on our Sucuri Twitter profile:](https://twitter.com/sucurisecurity)\n\n\n-----\n\nLet’s examine how these coveted verification badges are being used as a phishing lure for\nsocial engineering campaigns targeting some of the most popular social networks across the\nnet.\n\n## The Quest for Instagram Verification\n\nThe reality is that actually getting an account verified can be difficult. Instagram’s guidelines\nexplicitly state that users must be a public figure, celebrity or brand and meet certain account\nand eligibility requirements.\n\nStrong requirements have led to a sort of exclusivity around Instagram’s verification badges\n— in fact, it’s become something of a social media status symbol (that money alone can’t\nbuy).\n\nInstagram’s explosion in popularity and exclusivity of verification badges has made\nverification highly desirable for many users — a sentiment which also exists on other social\nmedia platforms like Twitter.\n\nI want to be verified on Instagram. I crave that blue check next to my name. Why?\nBasically because none of my friends are verified, so the verification will prove I’m\nbetter than them; which I always suspected.\n\n_[– A joke by the writer showcasing the desire many users have for being verified](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomward/2018/04/16/how-to-get-verified-on-instagram/)_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the majority of users may want the verification symbol for bragging rights, the symbol\ncan also help monetize an IG page — and this is driving some users to pursue any way\npossible to obtain the coveted verification for their profiles.\n\n## Phishing for Instagram’s Blue Badge Verification\n\nUnfortunately, attackers are also keenly aware of the desire to get verified profiles and\ncampaigns have cropped up targeting unsuspecting Instagram users.\n\nOne clear example is this phishing page masquerading as the real Instagram Verification\nsubmission page:\n\nNote the lack of SSL. This page also uses the instagramforbusiness.info domain, which\n_might be mistaken for the legitimate https://business.instagram.com/ page if a user isn’t_\npaying close attention.\n\n\n-----\n\nLet s take a look at what happens when an unsuspecting victim is lured into submitting their\ninformation to obtain a verified badge.\n\nAfter clicking Apply Now, the page reveals a series of phishing forms on the domain\n**instagramforbusiness[.]info.**\n\nThis form targets the victim’s Instagram login information and then asks them to confirm their\nemail address — by asking for their email address and password credentials. After each\nform submission, information is sent via email to the hackers which provides them with\nunauthorized access to the victim’s social media page.\n\nInstagram employs fingerprinting and a variety of other methods to determine if an account\nlogin is suspicious. When suspicious activity is detected, they lock down the account with a\n**Suspicious Login Attempt warning.**\n\nTo circumnavigate this login attempt feature and avoid lockdown, attackers need one of the\nfollowing pieces of information:\n\n\n-----\n\nAccess to the phone number used to register the account (if applicable as Instagram\ndoesn’t require a phone number for signup)\nAccess to the email address associated with the profile.\n\nThis explains why hackers target associated email login information on this phishing page; it\nallows them to reset and verify ownership of the phished Instagram account if the\n**Suspicious Login Attempt warning is triggered.**\n\n### Red Flags for Phishing & Scams\n\nThe lure of social media verification badges works great to entice unsuspecting victims. This\nis similar to the lure of “free” (i.e nulled, cracked) products like premium WordPress plugins\nor themes.\n\nDon’t let your situational awareness be lowered by the promise of an exclusive item or\nstatus, especially if it comes at a reduced cost. There are a number of red flags that this\npage was malicious:\n\nThe domain name is clearly not instagram.com.\nInstagram will never ask for a linked email account’s password as confirmation. It\nemploys the standard method of sending verification links to the user’s email.\nA lack of HTTPS results in insecure warnings in visitor’s browsers. While you can’t\ndepend on SSL to determine if a site is trustworthy or not, large websites like Instagram\ntypically display HTTPS — especially when handling login information and other\nsensitive information.\n\nThis domain has since been taken down, but it’s a workflow that we see attackers regularly\nleveraging in their phishing campaigns.\n\n## Twitter Blue Badge Phishing\n\nUsers who’ve already obtained their verification badge aren’t in the clear, either. Here’s a\nrecent example of password phishing targeting verified Twitter accounts for blue badge\nsupport.\n\nIf you're a verified account and get this message from another verified\naccount…..obviously….like don't. It's a password phishing scam.\n[pic.twitter.com/2UTrNeUQU3](https://t.co/2UTrNeUQU3)\n\n[— Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful.com (@SeanRossSapp) May 3, 2022](https://twitter.com/SeanRossSapp/status/1521615649956581376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[This DM, reported by SeanRossSapp, is made to appear authentic by leveraging the Twitter](https://twitter.com/SeanRossSapp)\nlogo. Attackers include the corporate address at the bottom of the DM and make it appear as\nthough it’s being sent by an official Blue Badge Support account.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, victims who follow the instructions and click on these malicious links are taken to a\nfake page designed to harvest and exfiltrate stolen account information to the attacker.\n\n### Twitter Account Suspension\n\nThreats of account suspension can also lead unsuspecting victims into acting without\nthinking fully through a situation.\n\n[BleepingComputer reporter Sergiu Gatlan received a Twitter DM which claimed his account](https://twitter.com/serghei)\nwas breaching Twitter’s terms of service and was under suspension for spreading hate\nspeech.\n\nSource:\n\nBleepingComputer and Sergiu Gatlan\n[As described in Sergiu’s write-up, the tinyurl.com address in the DM redirects victims to a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verified-twitter-accounts-hacked-to-send-fake-suspension-notices/)\nphishing landing page that leverages the Twitter API to check for valid credentials and pulls\nin user account images to add credibility to the scam.\n\nThese features found on more sophisticated phishing pages can make it challenging for even\nthe most observant users.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How to protect your accounts\n\nIt’s important to stay vigilant against social engineering attacks for all of your accounts — not\njust your website.\n\nTo [avoid online scams and abuse for your social media accounts and beyond, here are some](https://sucuri.net/guides/online-scams/)\nclear guidelines for you to follow.\n\n**1. Always check for suspicious URLs.**\n\nExercise caution when clicking on links and verify that they’re safe before you take any\naction.\n\n**2. Be wary of direct messages.**\n\nSocial media services like Instagram and Twitter will never request log-in credentials via\ndirect message.\n\n**3. Don’t send personal details.**\n\nNever reveal personal information, provide selfies, or upload pictures of your personal\nidentities to unsolicited users.\n\n**4. Ignore urgent requests.**\n\nAttackers often try to leverage urgent calls to action or threats in their phishing campaigns.\nTake a moment to pause and think about any requests you receive.\n\n**5. Avoid attachments and downloads.**\n\nDon’t open attachments or download files from untrusted sources.\n\n**6. Be mindful that compromises can happen to your friends.**\n\nYour friends and acquaintances might not have their accounts on lockdown. So if you see a\nURL or request for information, don’t assume it’s safe just ‘cause someone in your network\nsent it.\n\nWhen in doubt, reach out to support for assistance. And always enable two factor\nauthentication when possible — it may not prevent password change requests, but it will help\nprevent bad actors from gaining access to your accounts.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, always verify the links you are clicking on and ensure that you are only\nsubmitting personal information on legitimate websites. Malicious users are actively looking\n[for a chance to deceive their victims with phishing campaigns. Stay safe online!](https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/11/what-is-phishing.html)\n\n\n-----",
