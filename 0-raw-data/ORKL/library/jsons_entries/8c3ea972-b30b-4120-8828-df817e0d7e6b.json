The best\n\n method for detecting TG-3279 activity is to look for modifications to system\n\n files, invalidly signed executables, and repeated non-existent domain\n\n (NXDomain) DNS replies.\n\n## Known tools\n\n###### The following tools are strong indicators of TG-3279 activity:\n\n Conpee — A modular plugin-based remote access trojan (RAT) framework\n\n that includes a \"PlugMgr\" component, which sometimes uses the filenames\n\n mspatcher.dll or mspatch.dll. Newer variants of the Conpee installer include\n\n a semi-custom PE-file loader.\n\n gsi.exe — A system profiling tool compiled by Laurentiu Moon.\n\n Etso — A tool that loads an executable remote access tool from multiple\n\n\n#### Read the Forrester report on Managed Detection and Response Services and Vendor Capabilities\n\n###### LEARN MORE\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Runxx  A tool that loads PE files from its .rsrc section.\n\n The following tools, authored by Sincoder but also shared publicly, may\n\n indicate activity by TG-3279:\n\n s — A custom, fast SYN port scanner.\n\n sqlin.php — A PHP SQL injection script created on December 15, 2013.\n\n dnsenum.py — A Python script used to enumerate DNS entries from a\n\n word list.\n\n rdp_crk — A Python script and executable to brute force Remote Desktop\n\n Protocol (RDP) usernames and passwords.\n\n icmp_shell — A reverse shell that runs on Windows hosts over ICMP\n\n traffic.\n\n Additional forked tool repositories in the Sincoder persona's GitHub repository\n\n include the following:\n\n Keylogger — A Linux kernel-based keylogger originally created by GitHub\n\n user \"enaudon.\"\n\n Jynxkit — A Linux-based rootkit with a reverse-connecting SSL backdoor,\n\n originally created by GitHub user \"Chokepoint.\"\n\n Gh0st — A common RAT.\n\n NetCommander — An Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)-spoofing tool.\n\n Carberp — A RAT that was popular years ago but is still in use.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Tactics\n\n###### Through incident response engagements and open source research, CTU\n\n researchers have gained insight into TG-3279 operations.\n\n##### Reconnaissance\n\n###### TG-3279 appears to perform reconnaissance on its targets via open source\n\n research and network scanning.\n\n##### Development\n\n###### TG-3279 reuses some network infrastructure between attacks. Some IP\n\n addresses used by the threat actors are shared by multiple domain names. Not\n\n all domain names associated with those IP addresses are related to TG-3279\n\n activity, and some may be non-malicious. The registration information for each\n\n domain name used by TG-3279 tends to be unique and sometimes uses famous\n\n names or names that appear to be intended as a joke. Much of the\n\n registration information is cloned from legitimate companies such as Google or\n\n Microsoft.\n\n##### Weaponization\n\n###### As of this publication, CTU researchers have not determined whether TG-3279\n\n\n-----\n\n###### It appears that TG-3279 uses a port scanning tool named \"s\" and an RDP\n\n brute force tool named \"rdp_crk\", which may be used to scan and exploit\n\n targets.\n\n##### Exploitation\n\n###### As of this publication, CTU researchers have not discovered packaged exploits\n\n used by TG-3279 and believe that the threat actors rely on active hands-on\n keyboard techniques to exploit targets.\n\n##### Installation\n\n###### CTU researchers have observed TG-3279 leveraging optionally loaded DLLs to\n\n establish persistence for the Conpee plugin framework. This persistence\n\n technique allows threat actors to add a file to the compromised host without\n\n modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.\n\n The optional DLL hijacking method used by TG-3279 placed the Conpee DLL\n\n file on the compromised host as C:\\Windows\\wlbsctrl.dll. The Windows\n\n operating system includes an option to start the \"IKE and AuthIP IPSec Keying\n\n Modules\" service for load balancing if the host is configured to run this\n\n service. This system-privileged, network-enabled service is controlled via the\n\n ikeext.dll service DLL, which attempts to load wlbsctrl.dll. The legitimate version\n\n of this file resides at C:\\Windows\\System32\\wlbsctrl.dll. TG-3279 actors took\n\n\n-----\n\n###### not find the file at the legitimate location. On typical Windows 7 and 2008\n\n systems, failure to load wlbsctrl.dll is not reported. CTU researchers discovered\n\n that TG-3279 placed wlbsctrl.dll into C:\\Windows\\ and configured the \"IKE and\n\n AuthIP IPSec Keying Modules\" service to run.\n\n In other cases, TG-3279 actors modified the imports of legitimate DLLs to add\n\n their malicious DLLs to the load process. For example, TG-3279 has modified\n\n mspatcha.dll to import mspatcher.dll or msdomain.dll, both of which were the\n\n malicious Conpee DLL file. When wuauserv.dll loads mspatcha.dll, the malicious\n\n file is also loaded in the DLL import table.\n\n TG-3279 has been able to install tools in these locations by compromising the\n\n account credentials of users with administrator privileges.\n\n##### Command and control\n\n###### TG-3279 command and control (C2) communication often takes place over port\n\n 443 but is not HTTPS traffic. The traffic appears to be part of a larger\n\n framework that the tool's authors named PATX. The C2 communications include\n\n two notable aspects to complicate investigations: IP calculations and domain\n\n name parking.\n\n IP calculations\n\n\n-----\n\n###### address prevents detection by defenders who only resolve the hostnames used\n\n in the tools. For example, one of TG-3279's C2 hosts is www7 . micorsofts .\n\n com, which resolves to 230.165.22.199. In this instance, each byte of the IP\n\n address's hexadecimal value is XOR-transformed with the value 0x88, so the\n\n resulting network communications actually communicate to 110.45.158.79 (the\n\n result of 230 ^ 0x88 . 165 ^ 0x88 . 22 ^ 0x88 . 199 ^ 0x88).\n\n Domain name parking\n\n TG-3279 actors appear to park the domain names used by their tools on non\n malicious IP addresses at different points in time to evade detection of the\n\n actual IP addresses used in operations. For www7 . micorosofts . org and login\n\n . 7unzip . org, TG-3279 removed the DNS resolution for the domains at least\n\n three and four times respectively while the tools were installed on\n\n compromised resources.\n\n##### Actions on objective\n\n###### In the operations observed by CTU researchers, TG-3279 maintained a long\n lived foothold within infiltrated organizations. CTU researchers have observed\n\n TG-3279 actors refreshing their implanted tools with newer versions, including\n\n versions that have been signed with valid certificates.\n\n Certificate signing\n\n\n-----\n\n###### trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). Files containing a signature from one of\n\n these CAs can execute without prompting a user for permission. TG-3279 has\n\n been observed using legitimately signed files on Windows 7 hosts. These files\n\n were signed with a Chinese technology company's certificate on February 19,\n\n 2013, which is the same date that the files were written on the compromised\n\n host. CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 compromised this signing\n\n certificate because it was revoked on Tuesday, August 28, 2012. If a\n\n compromised host has a current certificate revocation list (CRL), this signature\n\n is flagged as invalid.\n\n TG-3279 actors strive to access network and system administrators' accounts to\n\n gain the most access to the target organization. After initial exploitation, TG\n 3279 relies on a few key hosts (typically the hosts of system or network\n\n administrators, document repositories, and domain controllers) to act as\n\n beachheads running the Conpee or Etso tools. TG-3279 then adds scheduled\n\n system tasks to other key resources within an organization to use compromised\n\n credentials gathered from pwdump6.\n\n## CTU observations\n\n###### During TG-3279 investigations, CTU researchers discovered evidence linking two\n\n personas, Laurentiu Moon Colonce and Sincoder, to TG-3279 tool development\n\n and infrastructure acquisition. TG-3279 activity has also revealed loose links to\n\n the Winnti group, but it is not clear as of this publication whether TG-3279 is\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The first established persona related to the tools used by TG-3279 is Laurentiu\n\n Moon, which is found in the program database (PDB) string of the gsi.exe\n\n system profiling tool. The PDB stores debugging information for its program.\n\n The PDB string is included at compilation time and provides insight into the\n\n directory structure of the computer used to compile the executable. The\n\n gsi.exe example shown in Figure 1 illustrates the use of the \"laurentiumoon\"\n\n username on the originating host and shows that the original program was\n\n named \"getosinfo\". According to the PETimeDateStamp, this example was\n\n compiled on Sunday, October 30, 2011 at 16:42:30 UTC.\n\n Figure 1. PDB string that includes the laurentiumoon username. (Source: Dell\n\n SecureWorks)\n\n The Laurentiu Moon Colonce persona has many online profiles that contain\n\n very little information, including a Steam Community online gaming account, a\n\n Google+ account, a list of CodeBeamer code projects, and a bulletin board\n\n\n###### account\n\n\n###### on a site about mobile phone jailbreaks and cracking. Additionally, the\n\n\n###### laurentiumoon @ gmail . com email address was used to register an account on\n\n rootkit.com, which used to be a bulletin board dedicated to discussing exploits\n\n and rootkit development. In February 2011, Anonymous dumped the clear text\n\n passwords of all rootkit.com users while compromising HBGary. There is also an\n\n\n###### openrce.org user account\n\n\n###### with the laurentiumoon username. OpenRCE is a\n\n\n-----\n\n###### and cracking legitimate software.\n\n Laurentiu Moon has also been active in the Chinese cracking and hacking\n\n underground since at least 2009, based upon the threat actor's join dates on\n\n the China Cracking Group online community, AntiGameProtect, and qdppc.net.\n\n The China Cracking Group and AntiGameProtect are online communities\n\n dedicated to cracking software digital rights management (DRM) mechanisms,\n\n with a large focus on video games. Laurentiu Moon joined AntiGameProtect on\n\n December 26, 2013 and has been active as recently as January 1, 2014 (see\n\n Figure 2).\n\n Figure 2. AntiGameProtect.com profile of laurentiumoon as of January 7, 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Newer versions of the Conpee tool include a semi-custom PE loading method.\n\n This method is functionally equivalent to at least two projects on GitHub: a\n\n \"sinpeloader\" and a \"PE-loader-sample.\" Additionally, some of the C2 domains\n\n used in TG-3279 operations have shared the same IP address as the hostname\n\n www . sincoder . com. CTU researchers discovered a GitHub account for a\n\n user named \"sincoder,\" which was active as recently as December 31, 2013.\n\n The GitHub account followed and contributed to the following projects:\n\n PE-loader-sample — A PE-loader that is functionally equivalent to the semi\n custom PE-loader found in the newer versions of Conpee. The original\n\n owner of this GitHub project is a member of the 3sLabs company, which\n\n is located in Bangalore, India.\n\n sinpeloader — The Sincoder profile's development branch of the PE\n loader-sample project.\n\n jynxkit — A Linux rootkit.\n\n Multiple publicly available RATs, including Gh0st, LS4Ghost (the Linux server\n\n for Gh0st), Carberp, and NetCommander.\n\n Branches of other tools, including \"keylogger,\" http_upload, sinarp (for ARP\n\n poisoning), \"s\" port scanner, icmp_shell to provide a remote shell over\n\n ICMP, UPX, and \"nmap_scripts.\"\n\n The sincoder GitHub account includes the 2bcoder @ gmail . com email\n\n dd A l t d d i f 2b d i i t d ith th h 123\n\n\n-----\n\n###### this information may not be accurate.\n\n There is also a Weibo microblogging profile for a user named 2bcoder that\n\n references attending network security club meetings and has many Android\n\n mobile device posts with geolocation information tagging for the Nanshan\n\n District of Shenzhen. The Weibo account follows both the Wuhan University of\n\n Technology and the Wuhan University Jingwei Forum.\n\n Like Laurentiu Moon, Sincoder is also a member of the China Cracking Group.\n\n\n###### A Twitter account notes the persona's location as Shenzhen, China. The Twitter\n\n profile does not have many public posts but follows security industry Twitter\n\n accounts such as FireEye and SecurityTube, many penetration testers, and\n\n offensive-security Twitter accounts such as Nikita Tarajanov from Russia and a\n\n self-described \"Botmaster, TrueCrober, CreditCardFucker, Fraudmaster\" based in\n\n \"cardaland\" who posts in Russian.\n\n Based upon the geolocation data associated with Weibo posts, the Sincoder\n\n (2bcoder) threat actor appears to live near Kefa Road in the Nanshan District\n\n of the Guangdong Province in Shenzhen, China as of this publication, and may\n\n be affiliated with the Wuhan University of Technology. CTU researchers believe\n\n the individual is pursuing a career in the information security industry. Based\n\n upon the geolocation of older Weibo posts, Sincoder may have previously lived\n\n in Beijing's Dongcheng District.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In 2013, Kaspersky Lab produced a report on a group it named \"Winnti\" after\n\n one of the tools the group uses. The CTU research team refers to the Winnti\n\n group as TG-2633. The group targets video game companies and uses tools,\n\n techniques, and procedures similar to those used by TG-3279:\n\n Both groups have used executables signed with potentially compromised\n\n certificates. The use of malware signed with valid certificates is one\n\n technique used to circumvent protections included in recent versions of\n\n the Windows operating system.\n\n Both groups have used rootkits detected by antivirus (AV) vendors as\n\n \"winnti.\"\n\n A Chinese technology company certificate that was used by TG-3279 was\n\n used to sign a separate rootkit that AV vendors detect as \"Etso\" or\n\n \"winnti,\" which is associated with TG-2633. It is possible that the code\n\n base used to create these rootkits has been shared within the Chinese\n\n underground, leading to the same AV rule alerting on multiple tools, or\n\n that this compromised certificate has been shared with multiple threat\n\n groups.\n\n Both groups target the video game industry. However, video game\n\n companies appear to be common targets across the Chinese cracking\n\n community.\n\n Domain names used by the groups are loosely linked. TG-2633 uses a\n\n 7zbiz . org domain name, while TG-3279 uses a 7zunzip . com domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Both groups have used domain names based upon the Microsoft\n\n trademark; however, this is an extremely common emulation among\n\n malicious actors.\n\n Although CTU researchers believe a connection between TG-3279 and TG-2633\n\n is probable, there is no direct evidence to definitively link the two groups. The\n\n following are possible relationships between the groups:\n\n The threat actors in the two groups may have an indirect relationship.\n\n TG-3279 threat actors may respect and emulate TG-2633, whose operating\n\n procedures were detailed in April 2013.\n\n Members of the groups may directly collaborate within the Chinese\n\n cracking community by sharing code, tools, and signing certificates.\n\n TG-3279 and TG-2633 may be part of the same overarching group.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n###### TG-3279 actors have been observed compromising video game companies. The\n\n following practices could prevent or detect successful intrusions:\n\n Use host-based file profiling to look for new DLL files added to system\n\n directories and modifications to the imports of existing files.\n\n Maintain current certificate revocation lists and alert on files signed with\n\n revoked certificates.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CTU researchers believe with high confidence that the individuals behind the\n\n Sincoder and Laurentiu Moon Colonce personas develop tools used by TG\n 3279. Based on the online associations of these personas, an objective of\n\n these compromises is likely to obtain inside information to crack the DRM\n\n protections of the stolen software and to develop cheat patches. An alternative\n\n objective may have been to obtain the source code of the gaming applications\n\n to develop a similar product. CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 will\n\n continue operations for the foreseeable future. Although there are similarities\n\n between TG-3279 and TG-2633, also known as Winnti, CTU researchers have\n\n not established a strong link between the groups as of this publication.\n\n## Appendix A: Tools\n\n\n###### TG-3279 has been observed using the tools mentioned in the\n\n section.\n\n##### Conpee\n\n\n###### Known tools\n\n\n###### Conpee is part of the \"PATX\" framework. The PlugMgr component, which\n\n communications with the \"PATX_SERVER\" C2 host, offers a reasonably full range\n\n of backdoor functionality, including the ability to load plugins with further\n\n capabilities.\n\n Th b ilt i RAT f ti lit f th Pl M t i l d th d\n\n\n-----\n\n|iisget <remotefile> <localfile>|Download remote file to local file|\n|---|---|\n|iisput <localfile> <remotefile>|Upload local file to remote file|\n|iisgetdir <remotedir> <localdir>|Download the remote directory to local directory|\n|iiscmd <program> <mode[-h | -s | -u]>|Run a program in either hidden, system, or user mode|\n|openshell <(-u) usermode>|Open a shell on the client|\n|closeshell|Close the shell and return to the top menu|\n|exit|Close the shell and return to the top menu|\n|set_dl_speed <speed-value> (1- 1024)kb/s|Set download speed|\n|set_ul_speed <speed-value> (1- 1024)kb/s|Set upload speed|\n|reboot|Reboot the Windows operating system|\n|closesystem|Shut down the Windows operating system|\n|session|Query session info|\n\n\n###### Table 1. PlugMgr RAT commands.\n\n The PlugMgr component loads additional plugins, which are downloaded and\n\n saved as DLL files in the same directory as the PlugMgr executable. These\n\n plugins have the following exports:\n\n peer_plugin_init\n\n l i i\n\n\n-----\n\n###### peer_plugin_uninit\n\n Initial interaction with the plugins is enabled through the PlugMgr component\n\n via the commands listed in Table 2.\n\n|Command|Functionality|\n|---|---|\n|?|Show help info|\n|help|Show help info|\n|enumplug|Enumerate all plugins on remote computer|\n|uploadplug <plugin-name>|Upload special plugin to remote computer|\n|deleteplug <plugin-name>|Delete special plugin on remote computer|\n|deleteallplug|Delete all plugins on remote computer|\n|installplug <plugin-name>|Install special plugin on remote computer|\n|uninstallplug <plugin-name>|Uninstall special plugin on remote computer|\n|startplug <plugin-guid>|Start special plugin on remote computer|\n|pauseplug <plugin-guid>|Set special plugin to pause state|\n|resumeplug <plugin-guid>|Set special plugin to running state|\n|stopplug <plugin-guid>|Stop special plugin on remote computer|\n|stopallplug|Stop all plugins on remote computer|\n|uninstallallplug|Uninstall all plugins on remote computer|\n|upgrade <client.exe>|Update latest client to target computer|\n|disc|Disconnect current client|\n|settimeout|Set client timeout (minutes)|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conpee includes limited error logging to a file named %s/%s_date.log.\n\n In 2013, TG-3279 began using 64-bit custom packed versions of the Conpee\n\n PlugMgr. These files are loaded via the XT load system described in the next\n\n section.\n\n##### XT load system\n\n###### TG-3279 uses a custom form of PE loading that includes multiple files to load\n\n executable code from an INI file. This XT code loading system is composed of\n\n four files: gsi.exe, xt.bat, xt.tmp, and xt.ini.\n\n gsi.exe\n\n gsi.exe is an executable file that walks the process tree to find explorer.exe.\n\n gsi.exe then saves the security identifier (SID) for explorer.exe to c:\\\\t.ini as the\n\n value of the private profile string \"App\". This value is then used by the xt.tmp\n\n executable file.\n\n xt.bat\n\n xt.bat is a batch script that calls the xt.tmp and xt.ini components of the XT\n\n load system. The following is an example of xt.bat contents:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### xt.tmp is an executable file that loads the data within xt.ini and c:\\t.ini via the\n\n GetPrivateProfile API call.\n\n xt.ini\n\n xt.ini is an INI file that includes executable code within the \"DATA\" string. The\n\n hexadecimal characters within the DATA string decode to the data in Figure 3.\n\n Figure 3. Contents of the xt.ini file. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\n\n This routine decodes the imports for UPX from the obfuscated format in Figure\n\n 4 (four regular bytes followed by three garbage bytes), then repairs the\n\n enclosed UPX stub within the DATA string and loads this PE file. To further\n\n obfuscate the INI file from signature-based detections, the MZ header of the\n\n UPX PE file is also nullified, as shown in Figure 5. When loaded, xt.ini is the\n\n Conpee PlugMgr component.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 4. Obfuscated imports for UPX routine. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\n\n Figure 5. MZ header is replaced with null bytes and relies upon a custom PE\n\n loading mechanism. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Etso tool used by TG-3279 is named TSMSISrv.dll. An older version of the\n\n code reads executable code data from four values in the\n\n HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\ODBC.INI registry key into memory buffers on the stack. The\n\n newer version of this tool, which was released February 2013 or earlier, reads\n\n the executable code from values stored in the non-malicious\n\n HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\ODBC\\ODBC.INI registry path. When executed, the data\n\n loaded from the ODBC.INI values XOR-decodes a simple remote access tool\n\n that provides backdoor command execution access to the compromised host.\n\n##### Runxx.exe rsrc loader\n\n###### Runxx.exe is a custom loader that runs the file encoded within the runxx.exe\n\n executable's .rsrc section as the owner of the Explorer.exe process. CTU\n\n researchers have observed the executable being named runxx.exe and st.exe.\n\n The st.exe version, which is slightly different from runxx.exe, takes the\n\n command line argument -P <key>, which decodes the enclosed .rsrc file. On\n\n 32-bit Windows Vista and newer hosts, the file writes and executes\n\n %TEMP%\\w7??.tmp, where \"??\" is replaced with two random characters.
