They didn’t get in touch. All computers on the network are\nencrypted,\" as Sodinokibi said on a Russian hacker and malware forum. \"More than 50 GB\nof data was stolen, including drawings, data of employees and customers.\n\nAll this is carefully prepared for implementation on the stock exchange of information. What\nthey don’t buy, we’ll post it for free. 7 days before publication.\"\n\nThis happens after Sodinokibi posted download links to 337 MB worth of files supposedly\nstolen from Artech Information Systems, a \"minority- and women-owned diversity supplier\nand one of the largest IT staffing companies in the U.S.\"\n\nThe operators behind Sodinokibi Ransomware also said that they'll begin selling the data\nthey stole from Artech on data exchange platforms frequented by cybercriminals as they\nthreatened on January 11.\n\n## Ransomware groups now behind potential data breaches\n\nExfiltrating data before encrypting ransomware victims' systems and leaking the stolen data\nis a new tactic recently adopted by ransomware gangs.\n\nIf their victims don't pay the ransom, the attackers will then slowly start leaking parts of the\nstolen data cache until they get paid or all the files have been released.\n\nThis new trend started by [Maze Ransomware during late November 2019 and now adopted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allied-universal-breached-by-maze-ransomware-stolen-data-leaked/)\nby Sodinokibi, as well as [Nemty Ransomware and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nemty-ransomware-to-start-leaking-non-paying-victims-data/) [BitPyLock during January 2020 who are](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitpylock-ransomware-now-threatens-to-publish-stolen-data/)\nsaying that they'll start stealing data before encrypting victims' devices.\n\nEven though they would also sniff around their victims' files before publicly announcing it,\nransomware groups never released any of the data they stole until Maze\n[Ransomware leaked 700 MB worth of documents stolen from Allied Universal during late-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allied-universal-breached-by-maze-ransomware-stolen-data-leaked/)\nNovember.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompanies that get hit by ransomware aren t yet treating such security incidents as data\nbreaches even though a wide range of sensitive records containing personal, financial, and\nmedical information now also gets swiped before being encrypted and ransomed.\n\nThis will most probably change in the near future, as lawmakers will take notice and will push\nout legislation also requiring data breach disclosures following ransomware attacks.\n\n_H/T_ _[Damian](https://twitter.com/Damian1338)_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - March 18th 2022 - Targeting the auto industry](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-march-18th-2022-targeting-the-auto-industry/)\n\n\n-----",
