    "plain_text": "# Transparent Tribe: Evolution analysis,part 2\n\n**securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part-2/98233**\n\nGiampaolo Dedola\n\n## Background + Key findings\n\nTransparent Tribe, also known as PROJECTM or MYTHIC LEOPARD, is a highly prolific\ngroup whose activities can be traced as far back as 2013. In the last four years, this APT\ngroup has never taken time off. They continue to hit their targets, which typically are\nIndian military and government personnel.\n\nThis is the second of two articles written to share the results of our recent investigations\ninto Transparent Tribe. In the previous article, we described the various Crimson RAT\ncomponents and provided an overview of impacted users. Here are some of the key\ninsights that will be described in this part:\n\nWe found a new Android implant used by Transparent Tribe for spying on mobile\ndevices. It was distributed in India disguised as a porn-related app and a fake\nnational COVID-19 tracking app.\nNew evidence confirms a link between ObliqueRAT and Transparent Tribe.\n\n## Android implant\n\nDuring our analysis, we found an interesting sample, which follows a variant of the\npreviously described attack scheme. Specifically, the attack starts with a simple\ndocument, which is not malicious by itself, does not contain any macro and does not try\nto download other malicious components, but it uses social engineering tricks to lure the\nvictim into downloading other documents from the following external URLs:\n\nhxxp://sharingmymedia[.]com/files/Criteria-of-Army-Officers.doc\n\nhxxp://sharingmymedia[.]com/files/7All-Selected-list.xls\n\n\n-----\n\n**_15DA10765B7BECFCCA3325A91D90DB37 – Special Benefits.docx_**\n\nThe remote files are two Microsoft Office documents with an embedded malicious VBA,\nwhich behaves similarly to those described in the previous article and drops the Crimson\n“Thin Client”. The domain sharingmymedia[.]com was even more interesting: it was\nresolved with the IP 89.45.67[.]160 and was registered on 2020-01-10 using Namesilo\nand the following information:\n\nRegistrant Name: bluff hunnter\nRegistrant Organization:\nRegistrant Street: India Dehli\nRegistrant City: Dehli\nRegistrant State/Province: Delhi\nRegistrant Postal Code: 110001\nRegistrant Country: IN\nRegistrant Phone: +91.4214521212\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrant Fax:\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant Email: hunterbluff007@gmail.com\n\nThe same information was used to register another domain, sharemydrives[.]com, which\nwas registered seven days before, on 2020-01-03, using Namesilo. DNS resolution points\nto the same IP address: 89.45.67[.]160.\n\nUsing our Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal, we found the following related URL:\n\n**_Information in Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal_**\n\nThe file is a modified version of MxVideoPlayer, a simple open-source video player for\nAndroid, downloadable from GitHub and used by Transparent Tribe to drop and execute\ntheir Android RAT.\n\n**_Desi-porn.apk screenshot_**\n\nThe dropper tries to find a list of legitimate packages on the system:\n\nimo.android.imoim\nsnapchat.android\nviber.voip\nfacebook.lite\n\nIf the device was produced by Xiaomi, it also checks if the com.truecaller package is\npresent.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_The code used to check if legitimate packages are installed_**\n\nThe first application on the list that is not installed on the system will be selected as the\ntarget application. The malware embeds multiple APK files, which are stored in a\ndirectory named “assets”. The analyzed sample includes the following packages:\n\napk a20fc273a49c3b882845ac8d6cc5beac\napk 53cd72147b0ef6bf6e64d266bf3ccafe\napk bae69f2ce9f002a11238dcf29101c14f\napk b8006e986453a6f25fd94db6b7114ac2\napk 4556ccecbf24b2e3e07d3856f42c7072\napk 6c3308cd8a060327d841626a677a0549\n\nThe selected APK is copied to /.System/APK/. By default, the application tries to save the\nfile to external storage, otherwise it saves it to the data directory.\n\nFinally, the application tries to install the copied APK. The final malware is a modified\nversion of the AhMyth Android RAT, open-source malware downloadable from GitHub,\nwhich is built by binding the malicious payload inside other legitimate applications.\n\nThe original AhMyth RAT includes support for the following commands:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Com-**\n**mands**\n\n\n**Addi-**\n**tional**\n**fields**\n\n\n**Value** **Description**\n\n\nx0000ca extra camlist get a camera list\n\nextra 1 get a photo from the camera with the id 1\n\nextra 0 get a photo from the camera with the id 0\n\n\nx0000fm extra\npath\n\nextra\npath\n\n\nls\n%dirpath%\n\ndl\n%filepath%\n\n\nget a list of files in the directory specified in the\n“path” variable.\n\nupload the specified file to the C2\n\n\nx0000sm extra ls get a list of text messages\n\n\nextra\nto\n\nsms\n\n\nsendSMS\n%number%\n\n%message%\n\n\nsend a new text to another number\n\n\nx0000cl get the call log\n\nx0000cn get contacts\n\n\nx0000mc sec %seconds%\n\n\nrecord audio from the microphone for the specified\nnumber of seconds and upload the resulting file to\nthe C2.\n\n\nx0000lm get the device location\n\nBasically, it provides the following features:\n\ncamera manager (list devices and steal screenshots)\nfile manager (enumerate files and upload these to the C2)\nSMS manager (get a list of text messages or send a text)\nget the call log\nget the contact list\nmicrophone manager\nlocation manager (track the device location)\n\nThe RAT that we analyzed is slightly different from the original. It includes new features\nadded by the attackers to improve data exfiltration, whereas some of the core features,\nsuch as the ability to steal pictures from the camera, are missing.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operators added the following commands:\n\nx000upd – download a new APK from the URL specified in the “path” field.\nx000adm – autodownloader: not implemented in the version we analyzed, but\navailable in other samples.\n\nMoreover, the creators of the RAT also improved its audio surveillance capabilities and\nincluded a command to delete text messages with specific contents.\n\n\n**Com-**\n**mands**\n\n\n**Addi-**\n**tional**\n**fields**\n\n\n**Value** **Description**\n\n\nx000upd path %url% download a new APK from the URL specified in the\n“path” field\n\nx000adm not implemented in the analyzed version. Other\nsamples use this to start a class named\n“autodownloader”.\n\n\nx0000mc extra\nsec\n\n\nau\n%seconds%\n\n\nrecord audio for x seconds and upload the resulting file to the C2. Duration is specified in the “sec”\nvalue.\n\n\nextra mu stop recording and upload the resulting file to the\nC2\n\nextra muS start recording continuously. This generates MP3\nfiles stored in the “/.System/Records/” directory.\n\n\nx0000fm extra\npath\n\nextra\npath\n\n\nls\n%dirpath%\n\ndl\n%filepath%\n\n\nget a list of files in the directory specified in the\n“path” variable\n\nupload the specified file to\nhxxp://212.8.240[.]221:80/server/upload.php\n\n\nsms extra ls get a list of text messages\n\n\nextra\nto\n\nsms\n\nextra\nto\n\nsms\n\n\nsendSMS\n%number%\n\n%message%\n\ndeleteSMS\n%message%\n\n\nSend a new text to another number.\n\nDelete a text that contains the string specified in\nthe “sms” value. The “to” value is ignored.\n\n\n-----\n\nx0000cl get the call log\n\nx0000cn get contacts\n\nx0000lm get the device location\n\nThe “autodownloader” is a method used for performing the following actions:\n\nupload a contact list\nupload a text message list\nupload files stored in the following directories:\n\n/.System/Records/\n/Download/\n/DCIM/Camera/\n/Documents/\n/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Images/\n/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Documents/\n\nThe attacker uses the method to collect contacts and text messages automatically. In\naddition, the method collects the following: audio files created with the “x0000mc”\ncommand and stored in /.System/Records/, downloaded files, photos, images and\ndocuments shared via WhatsApp and other documents stored on the device.\n\nAnother interesting difference between the original AhMyth and the one modified by\nTransparent Tribe is the technique used for getting the C2 address. The original version\nstores the C2 server as a string directly embedded in the code, whereas the modified\nversion uses a different approach. It embeds another URL encoded with Base64 and used\nfor getting a configuration file, which contains the real C2 address.\n\nIn our sample, the URL was as follows:\n\nhxxp://tryanotherhorse[.]com/config.txt\n\nIt provided the following content:\n\n212.8.240.221:5987\n\nhttp://www.tryanotherhorse.com\n\nThe first value is the real C2, which seems to be a server hosted in the Netherlands.\n\nThe modified version communicates via a different URL scheme, which includes more\ninformation:\n\nOriginal URL scheme: http://%server%:%port?\nmodel=%val%&manf=%val%&release=%val%&id=%val%\nModified URL scheme http://%server%:%port?\nmac=%val%&battery=%val%&model=%val%&manf=%val%&release=%val%&id=%val%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Covid-19 tracking app\n\nWe found evidence of Transparent Tribe taking advantage of pandemic-tracking\napplications to distribute trojanized code. Specifically, we found an APK file imitating\n[Aarogya Setu, a COVID-19 tracking mobile application developed by the National](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/)\nInformatics Centre under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology,\nGovernment of India. It allows users to connect to essential health services in India.\n\nThe discovered application tries to connect to the same malicious URL to get the C2 IP\naddress:\nhxxp://tryanotherhorse[.]com/config.txt\n\nIt uses the same URL scheme described earlier and it embeds the following APK\npackages:\n\napk CF71BA878434605A3506203829C63B9D\napk 627AA2F8A8FC2787B783E64C8C57B0ED\napk 62FAD3AC69DB0E8E541EFA2F479618CE\napk A912E5967261656457FD076986BB327C\napk 3EB36A9853C9C68524DBE8C44734EC35\napk 931435CB8A5B2542F8E5F29FD369E010\n\nInterestingly enough, at the end of April, the Indian Army issued a warning to its\npersonnel against Pakistani agencies’ nefarious designs to hack the phones of Indian\nmilitary personnel through a malicious application similar to Aarogya Setu.\n\n[According to some Indian online news sites, these applications were found to be sent by](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intel-agencies-caution-armed-forces-against-pak-propped-fake-aarogya-setumobile-app-78549)\nPakistani Intelligence Operatives to WhatsApp groups of Indian Army personnel. It also\nmentioned that these applications later deployed additional packages:\n\nAccording to some Indian online news sites, these applications were found to be sent by\nPakistani Intelligence Operatives to WhatsApp groups of Indian Army personnel. It also\nmentioned that these applications later deployed additional packages:\n\nface.apk\nimo.apk\nnormal.apk\ntrueC.apk\nsnap.apk\nviber.apk\n\nBased on public information, the application may have been distributed by sending a\nmalicious link via WhatsApp, SMS, phishing email or social media.\n\n## ObliqueRAT connection\n\n\n-----\n\nObliqueRAT is another malicious program, described by Cisco Talos in an interesting\narticle published in February. It was attributed to Transparent Tribe because some\nsamples were distributed through malicious documents forged with macros that\nresembled those used for distributing Crimson RAT.\n\nThe report described two ObliqueRAT variants, one distributed via a malicious document\nas the infection vector and another one, named “Variant #0” and distributed with a\ndropper.\n\n4a25e48b8cf515f4cdd6711a69ccc875429dcc32007adb133fb25d63e53e2ac6\n\nUnfortunately, as reported by Talos, “The initial distribution vector of this dropper is\ncurrently unknown”.\n\nAt this time, we do not have the full infection chain, but we can add another piece to the\npuzzle, because sharemydrives[.]com also hosted another file:\n\n**_Information in Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal_**\n\nThe wifeexchange.exe sample is another dropper, which disguises itself as a porn clip.\n\nSpecifically, the executable file uses the same icon used by Windows for multimedia files.\n\n**_Dropper icon_**\n\nOnce executed, the process tries to find a specific marker (“*#@”)\ninside its file image, then drops and opens the following files:\n\nframe.exe –\n\n4a25e48b8cf515f4cdd6711a69ccc875429dcc32007adb133fb25d63e53e2ac6\nmovie.mp4\n\nFrame.exe is the dropper described by Talos, while movie.mp4 is a small porn clip.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nTransparent Tribe members are trying to add new tools to extend their operations and\ninfect mobile devices. They are also developing new custom .NET tools like ObliqueRAT,\nand as observed in the first report, we do not expect this group to slow down any time\nsoon. We will keep monitoring their activities.\n\n## IoC\n\n\n-----\n\nThe followings IoC list is not complete. If you want more information about the APT\ndiscussed here, a full IoC list and YARA rules are available to customers of Kaspersky\n[Threat Intelligence Reports.
