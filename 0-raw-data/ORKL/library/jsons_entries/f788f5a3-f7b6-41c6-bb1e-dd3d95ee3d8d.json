The attack, initially based on the Saint Bot downloader,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-saint-bot-downloader/)\nalso targeted Georgia as reported by Malwarebytes. Since June we have seen this threat\nactor expand its operation with new samples targeting government entities in Georgia. In this\nreport we will cover the new malware samples we found.\n\n## Method of Infection\n\nThe attack’s entry point is a spear phishing email referencing government-related topics\nincluding veterans, Ukraine’s Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), Georgia’s Internally Displaced\nPersons (IDPs), organizations in Georgia’s private sector and COVID-19. The attack mainly\ntargets government agencies in Ukraine and Georgia.\n\n## The Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main payload delivered by the malware is an infostealer written in AutoIt. Its main goal is\nto steal files from the victim’s machine, uploading them to a predefined Command and control\n(C2) server. Based on victimology and the fact that this attack tries to steal files from\ngovernment entities, a classic goal of nation-state groups, it is likely operated by a Russian\nnation-state. There are also several similarities between this attack and past APT28\ncampaigns which we will discuss later. Below we summarize the early stages of the attack\nand show the latest malware targeting government entities in Georgia. We assess with high\nconfidence that this attack may expand its operations to target additional Eastern European\ncountries.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n[The attack flow, described below, begins with a phishing email containing a malicious](https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/targeted-phishing-attack-against-ukrainian-government-expands-to-georgia/www.intezer.com/blog/research/global-phishing-campaign-targets-energy-sector-and-its-suppliers/)\nshortened URL. The URL redirects to a Command and control (C2) where a ZIP file or\nmalicious document is hosted. The ZIP file contains a malicious file and in some emails also a\nharmless PDF file. The malicious attachment varies between RTF, DOC, PDF, JS, LNK or\nEXE. Its main goal is to drop the packed payloads from the C2. The method in which a\ndropper contacts the C2 in order to deliver the packed payload varies between the different\nfile types and stages of the attack. The packed executable loads an AutoIt payload into\nmemory. The payload searches for files on the victim’s machine based on a list of file\nextensions and uploads them to a C2 that is hardcoded in the script.\n\n_Attack flow._\n\nAn example of one of the phishing emails sent to the Ukrainian government is below. The\nthreat actor references payments made to veterans of the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Phishing email sent to the Ukrainian government. Translation from Ukrainian – Subject:_\n_“Payments to ATO Veterans.” Content: “It must be filled in and sent back.”_\n\nThe link, masqueraded as a Ukrainian .gov domain, is actually a shortened URL\n(https[://]cutt[.]ly/WcBTVdf) which contacts http[://]gosloto[.]site/doc/form_request.doc and\ndownloads form_request.doc to the victim’s machine. This document is an RTF file that once\n[runs will present content related to the Israeli Merkava, the main battle tank used by the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava)\nIsraeli Defense Forces.\n\n_Reference to Israeli Merkava in the RTF file._\n\nThis file is incharge of dropping the final payload from the C2. In other phishing emails, this\nfile is named NATO_06042021 (44697aad796c0d82c1adbee15fd1266b).\n\n\n-----\n\n## First we Take Kyiv, then we Take Tbilisi\n\nCombined with continuous attacks against Ukraine, the threat actor has expanded its\ncampaign to target government entities in Georgia. The following malicious documents were\nuploaded to VirusTotal from Georgia on June 17 and July 5.\n\nb56975725c4e260370af540f9c0b6709 Georgia_Private_Sector_Poster_Inputs_06_2021.pdf\n\n900e892c8151f0f59a93af1206583ce6 2021-2022 Strategy Action Plan for IDPs.doc\n(translated from Georgian)\n\n333796e18eb3f3d1529d07ec90c63e61 Change to 828.doc (translated from Georgian)\n\nAll three files have low detection rates in VirusTotal at the time of this writing. In the following\nsections we will describe each file’s behavior.\n\n_b56975725c4e260370af540f9c0b6709 in VirusTotal._\n\n## The PDF File\n\nThe PDF file, named “Georgia_Private_Sector_Poster_Inputs_06_2021.pdf,” was uploaded to\nVirusTotal on June 17, 2021. The PDF contains an action object. Upon a victim opening the\nPDF it will send a query to Google containing the C2: http://www[.]google[.]com/url?\nq=http%3A%2F%2F93482432493824792343432843240234327488\n**92349702394023.xyz&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFWmVffgSGlrrv-2U9sSOJYzfUQqw) The**\nsystem will prompt a security warning allowing the document to contact\n“http[:]//www.google.com.”\n\n_Action object in_\n\n_b56975725c4e260370af540f9c0b6709_\n\n\n-----\n\n_System prompt message._\n\nOnce the document connects to Google a short series of network redirections occurs. First,\nGoogle will redirect to the C2’s URL. Then, as described in the image below, the C2 contains\na frame with an src to another C2 URL (https[://]16868138130[.]space/000/), which then\nredirects to a shortened URL (https[://]qaz[.]im/load/rKtsZD/hDKKFD) using a meta refresh\nredirect. This will finally drop georgia_private_sector_poster_inputs_06_2021.cpl\n(02f0118bd15dabf727659b9fd27c86c9).\n\n_Network redirections for delivering the payload._\n\nThis redirection process, starting with Google as the first domain the PDF attempts to access,\nis an obvious Antivirus evasion technique.\ngeorgia_private_sector_poster_inputs_06_2021.cpl is a DLL which upon clicking on it, runs\nunder a trusted control panel process. The DLL is incharge of dropping and running the\npacked payload from the C2, 16868138130[.]space/000/000.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n(41af4d9fbd0bc719212b78cd7a1b89ec).

Once a user opens this document, it will\nrun a VBA macro with the main logic to create, write to and run a batch file named\n“ballDemocrat.bat.” The script written to the batch file will run a PowerShell command that\ndrops an executable from the C2 (http[://]1221[.]site/15858415841/0407.exe) and saves it as\ncenturyarticle.exe.\n\n_VBA script (7546f382d73231a4c1fdc58ab1535ec0) in the malicious document._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Process tree of 900e892c8151f0f59a93af1206583ce6_\n\nThe file dropped from the C2 is a packed .NET file that loads the AutoIt payload into memory.\n\n## Possible Russian Connection\n\nWe noticed similarities between this attack and Russia’s APT28 campaigns. While these\nsimilarities alone are not enough to attribute APT28, victimology and intent to conduct\nespionage on various government entities in Eastern European regions gives us reason to\nbelieve that Russia is behind the attack.\n\n1. Victimology: APT28 has targeted Ukraine and Georgia in the past. [1][2][3]\n2. Phishing theme: APT28 previously used COVID-19-related phishing themes to target\n\ncountries including Ukraine. APT28 also used NATO as a phishing theme in the past. [1]\n\n[2][4][5]\n3. Use of AutoIt: One of Zebrocy’s (malware from APT28) variants is written in AutoIt. [6]\n\n[7]\n4. File search with predefined extensions: Zebrocy searches for predefined file\n\nextensions on the victim machine. [8][9][13]\n5. Compressed file holding both malicious and benign files was used in an APT28\n\nCOVID-19 phishing attack last year and in other campaigns in the past. [4][8]\n6. Use of spear phishing emails containing URL-shortener was documented in past\n\nAPT28 campaigns. In one of the campaigns, this URL hosted a ZIP file containing a\nbenign PDF and a malicious executable. [8][10][11]\n7. Use of Hex encoding: The Zebrocy AutoIt version uses String to Hex encoding. [7]\n8. Use of batch files, PowerShell and CMD are part of APT28’s documented TTPs. [8]\n\n[12]\n\n## Mitigation\n\nTake the following precautions to keep your organization clean and safe from phishing\nattacks.\n\n1. Enhance social engineering awareness within your organization.\n[2. Use an email gateway to analyze attachments and links. Intezer Analyze now supports](http://analyze.intezer.com/sign-in)\n\nanalysis for Microsoft Office documents, PDFs and scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Conduct [proactive threat hunting on all endpoints inside your organization to routinely](https://www.intezer.com/proactive-hunting-intezer/)\n\nensure that no traces of malicious code or malware exist in-memory. Intezer’s live\n[Endpoint Scanner can help you achieve this at scale by collecting all binaries running in-](https://www.intezer.com/pricing/)\nmemory, including fileless, and classifying them using Genetic Code Analysis\n[technology.
