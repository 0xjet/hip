The operation of nuclear power plants, hydroelectricity plants, oil\nand gas pipelines, and transport systems at national and world level are based on\ncomputer technology. Both the profit of a company and national security depend on\ncontrol systems safety.\n\nIndustry systems security gained great interest not very long ago — after a series of\nincidents involving particular computer viruses, Flame and Stuxnet. It was then found that\nspecial services of foreign countries, competitive companies or cyber-terrorists are able to\nprofit from the lack of attention paid to ICS/SCADA/PLC information security.\n\nThreat modeling and imitating a potential attacker are essential in building a security\nsystem. It is necessary to understand what skills the attacker possesses and what\nscheme of attack may be chosen. In order to answer these questions, the experts of\nPositive Technologies explored ICS systems security. This report consists of 2 sections:\n\n  - Statistics on Vulnerabilities in the ICS Systems;\n\n  - Assessment of the Popularity of ICS on the Internet.\n\nThe subject of the investigation comprises the vulnerabilities that were discovered for the\nperiod from 2005 to October 1, 2012.\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. Conclusions\n\n1.   The history of industrial system security is divided into two parts — prior to Stuxnet\nand afterwards. 20 times more vulnerabilities have been detected since 2010 comparing\nwith the previous five years.\n\n\n**_ICS in Figures:_**\n\n**_The number of detected vulnerabilities_**\n**_has increased by 20 times (since 2010)._**\n**_It takes more than a month to fix each_**\n**_fifth vulnerability._**\n\n**_50% of vulnerabilities allow a hacker to_**\n**_execute code._**\n\n**_There are exploits for 35% of_**\n**_vulnerabilities._**\n\n**_41% of vulnerabilities are critical._**\n**_More than 40% of systems available_**\n**_from the Internet can be hacked by_**\n**_unprofessional users._**\n\n**_The third part of systems available from_**\n**_the Internet is located in the USA._**\n\n**_The fourth part of vulnerabilities is_**\n**_related to the lack of necessary security_**\n**_updates._**\n\n**_54% and 39% of systems available from_**\n**_the Internet in Europe and North_**\n**_America respectively are vulnerable._**\n\n\n2.   The number of vulnerabilities keeps on growing rapidly in\n2012. The number of security flaws found within ten months is\nfar bigger than the number of flaws found during the whole\nprevious period starting from 2005.\n\n3.   Vulnerabilities are primarily detected in the most common\nproducts, and the major part of vendors eliminate them quite\nquickly. However, each fifth vulnerability wasn't fixed within 30\ndays from the moment of its detection.\n\n4.   About 65% of vulnerabilities are rated as of high and critical\nseverity. This figure significantly exceeds a similar index in IT\nsystems, which proves a low information security level of ICS\nsystems.\n\n5.   Exploitation of each second vulnerability allows an attacker\nto execute arbitrary code in the target ICS system.\n\n6.   More than 40% of SCADA systems available from the\nInternet are vulnerable and can be hacked by poorly trained\nmalware users.\n\n7.   The USA and Europe lead in the number of ICS systems\npublished in the Internet and demonstrate the most thoughtless\nattitude towards their security comparing with other regions.\n\n\n8.   More than a third of security flaws of available ICS systems are caused by configuration\nerrors, including the use of default passwords.\n\n9. The fourth part of vulnerabilities of available ICS systems is related to the lack of\nnecessary security updates.\n\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3. Analysis of the Vulnerabilities in the ICS Systems\n\n#### 3.1. Research Methodology\n\nInformation from different sources (e.g. vulnerability databases, vendors’ notices,\nexploit packs, science conference reports, articles published on specialized sites and blogs)\nserved as a basis for the research. It was necessary to analyze this broad spectrum of sources\nsince cooperation between the community of information security researchers and the ICS\nvendors is just getting started and a lot of vulnerabilities are published without the\ndevelopers’ approval.\n\n**The main sources used in the research**\n\nVulnerability databases:\n\n       - ICS-CERT,\n\n       - NVD,\n\n       - CVE,\n\n       - Bugtraq,\n\n       - OSVDB,\n\n       - Mitre Oval Repositories,\n\n       - exploit-db,\n\n       - Siemens Product CERT.\nExploit packs:\n\n       - SAINTexploit,\n\n       - Metasploit Framework,\n\n       - Immunity Canvas,\n\n        - Agora Pack,\n\n        - Agora SCADA+,\n\n        - D2 Exploit Pack,\n\n        - White Phosphorus exploit pack,\n\n        - VulnDisco Exploit Pack.\n\nFor each vulnerability discovered, the experts searched for generally available\nmethods of exploiting the vulnerability and provided an expert evaluation of the related\nrisks.\n\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.2. Dynamics of Vulnerability Discovery\n\nThe specialists in information security discovered only 9 vulnerabilities for the period from\n2005 to early 2010. Since the computer worm Stuxnet was discovered, both information\nsecurity experts and hackers have showed deep interest in the subject. As a result, 64\nvulnerabilities in ICS systems were discovered by the end of 2011. Moreover, for the first 8\nmonth of 2012, 98 vulnerabilities were announced — more than in the previous years since\n2005.\n\n**_A path from the discovery of vulnerabilities in_**\n**_SCADA to fixing them sometimes has to be a_**\n**_twisted one. During the investigation of the Stuxnet_**\n**_incident, it was found that one of the exploited_**\n**_vulnerabilities — a default password for MS SQL_**\n**_Server — was known long ago. It was first_**\n**_mentioned during the support forums in May, 2005._**\n**_The passwords were published in April, 2008. The_**\n**_issue was fixed after the attack, in 2010._**\n\n**_Tab. 1.

The Number of Vulnerabilities in the ICS systems of Various Vendors\n\nThe highest number of vulnerabilities for the reporting period (42) was discovered in\nthe components of the ICS developed by Siemens. The second place goes to\nBroadwin/Advantech (22 vulnerabilities); the third, to Schneider Electric (18 vulnerabilities).\n\n**_Tab. 2.

The Number of Vulnerabilities in the ICS Systems of Various Vendors_**\n\nThe highest number of vulnerabilities in ICS (also true for other systems) was\ndiscovered in the most common components. Moreover, a number of vendors changed their\napproach from reactive to proactive and took resolute measures to find and fix\nvulnerabilities in their products. For instance, Siemens organized a specialized department,\n[Siemens ProductCERT (http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/en/research-](http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/en/research-areas/siemens-cert-security-advisories.htm)\n[areas/siemens-cert-security-advisories.htm), whose main goal is to discover and fix security](http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/en/research-areas/siemens-cert-security-advisories.htm)\nissues in the company’s products. The vulnerabilities discovered by the team are also\nincluded in the general statistics; thus the number of discovered and fixed issues is\nincreasing.\n\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.4. Vulnerabilities Relating to ICS Hardware and Software Components\n\nSuch ICS components as SCADA systems and human machine interface (HMI) are\npresent a significant interest for attackers: 87 and 49 vulnerabilities were discovered,\nrespectively, in these systems. For the reporting period, the experts discovered 20\nvulnerabilities in the programmable logic controllers of different vendors.\n\n**_Tab. 3.

Classification of Vulnerabilities According to Their Types and Possible\n Consequences\n\nOver a third of vulnerabilities (36%) are associated with the buffer overflow — an\nanomaly where a program overruns the buffer's boundary while writing data. This defect in\nsecurity allows the attacker not only to cause premature ending of a program or freeze\n\n\n**_The recent rapid growth of the vulnerabilities_**\n**_discovered in ICS is caused by the ethical_**\n**_hackers getting involved in the process. The_**\n**_Positive Research Center experts discovered_**\n**_more than 50 vulnerabilities in different_**\n**_products in 2012, the most part of which has_**\n**_already been fixed by the vendors. A lot of work_**\n**_in coordination of the vulnerability fixing_**\n**_process is carried out by ICS CERT._**\n\n\n(which leads to denial of service), but\nalso to execute arbitrary code in the\ntarget system. The types of\nvulnerability which allow the\nattacker to execute code (Buffer\nOverflow, Remote Code Execution)\nmake up 50% of all vulnerabilities (an\nextremely high figure!). We should\nalso consider the large number of\nproblems in Authentication and Key\nManagement — almost 23%.\n\n\n**_Tab. 4.

Percentage of Fixed Vulnerabilities in ICS\n\nA display of fixed vulnerabilities percentage gives a clear view on how serious ICS\nvendors are about information security issues. For instance, Siemens fixed and released\npatches for 88% of vulnerabilities, while Schneider Electric fixed only 56% of security defects.\n\n**_Tab. 5.

Percentage of Vulnerabilities Fixed Promptly\n\nMost security defects (81%) have been fixed rather efficiently by ICS component\nvendors before they became widely known or within 30 days of uncoordinated disclosure.\nApproximately every fifth vulnerability was fixed with a significant delay, or was even not\nfixed in certain cases.\n\n**_August 2010 note US-CERT VU#362332 was_**\n**_published; it reported on a dangerous_**\n**_vulnerability in the real-time system VxWorks,_**\n**_which is used in industry systems. According to_**\n**_HD Moore, he discovered more than 250,000_**\n**_vulnerable systems which were accessible_**\n**_through the Internet._**\n\n\nVulnerabilities not Fixed Within 30 Days\n\nVulnerabilities Fixed Promptly\n\n\n19%\n\n81%\n\n\n**_Figure 6.

Availability of information and software to conduct attacks\n\nIf there are ready-to-use tools to exploit the vulnerability in the public domain, it is\nmuch more possible that the attack will be conducted successfully. Now for 35% of all known\nSCADA vulnerabilities exploits have been issued, which are available as single utilities, parts\nof penetration testing software or are described in security bulletins.\n\n\nNo exploit exists\n\nExploit exists\n\n\n35%\n\n65%\n\n\n**_Figure 7. Part of vulnerabilities that have exploits_**\n\nPlease note that 35% is rather a high value for the number of available SCADA\nexploits: it is several times higher than the corresponding rate for IT systems as a whole.\n\n#### 3.9. Number of exploits \n\nAs a rule, the number of detected vulnerabilities correlates with the number of published\nexploits. 50 exploits were published starting in 2011 and up to September 2012: this is six\ntimes greater than the corresponding rate for the period 2005 - 2010.\n\n**_Tab. 6.

Number of published exploits_**\n\nThe number of exploits published in 2012 is rather small. There are two possible reasons:\n\n  - Relationships between SCADA vendors and explorers are put in order: responsible\n\ndisclosure policy is used;\n\n  - There is a clear lag between the publication of vulnerability details and the\n\npublication of exploits (certain costs are incurred to develop exploitation tools).\n\n#### 3.10. Risk levels of detected vulnerabilities\n\nA great number of vulnerabilities (about 65%) are of high or critical level[1].\n\n1 Vulnerabilities of high level have CVSS v2 Base Score value > 6,5. Vulnerabilities of critical level\nare vulnerabilities of high level with known exploits.\n\n\n#### 30\n\n 20\n\n 6\n\n 2\n\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nLow Medium High Critical\n\n10%\n\n\n25%\n\n24%\n\n41%\n\n\n**_Figure 2.

SCADA vulnerabilties by risk level_**\n\nIf there are no methods to conduct the attack, the possibility that SCADA components by\nSEL, Lantronix, Emerson and Invensys will be attacked is lower, but is not ruled out. As a rule,\nan attack against an industrial enterprise is a kind of multi-move game played by\nexperienced experts who do not need “exploit packs” and other tools intended for\n“ordinary” hackers.\n\n**_Information about the ICS accessible through_**\n**_the Internet is being published constantly on_**\n**_Twitter @ntisec.

SCADA non-fixed vulnerabilities\n\nVulnerabilities for which there are already means of attack, but no means of\nresistance, provide the greatest risk. If there is a vulnerability and a fix has not been issued,\nthe risk that the system can be compromised is rather high, as an attacker does not need\ndeep knowledge and a protracted period to prepare for the attack. Moreover, the attack can\nbe conducted by hooligans. The most grievous situation concerns Schneider Electric SCADA\ncomponents, where six vulnerabilities were detected. The second place goes to General\nElectric (3 vulnerabilities); the third and fourth places are between Advantech/Broadwin and\nRockwell Automation, with one open vulnerability.\n\n**_Tab. 8.

Popularity of ICS in the Internet\n\nTo understand to what extent the vulnerabilities described above can be used by an\nattacker, the Internet has been assessed in relation to vulnerable ICS. Passive analysis\ntogether with search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing) and specialized databases such as\n[ShodanHQ, Every Routable IP Project were employed to search and check system versions.](http://www.shodanhq.com/)\nThe obtained information was analyzed from the point of view of vulnerabilities related to\nconfiguration management and updates installation.\n\nUnfortunately, the passive technique cannot be reliable in identifying all detected\nvulnerabilities, that is why the major part of the information in this section should be\nconsidered as a positive script: in case of a detailed analysis, the number of detected\nvulnerabilities will certainly increase.\n\n#### 4.1. Frequency of ICS Systems\n\nAlmost the third part of the ICS systems, which elements can be accessed from the\nInternet, are located in the USA (31.3%). Italy follows far behind (6.8%), South Korea rounds\nout the top three (6.2%). Russia holds the 12th place with 2.3%, and only 1.1% of ICS systems\navailable from the global network are located in China.\n\n**_Table 12.

South America lags\nbehind the Old World (37.46%), Asia holds the third place (12.39%).\n\n**_Table 13.

Types of ICS Systems\n\nMost often the global network contains various SCADA components including HMI.\nThey account for 70% of all detected objects. Another 27% of the ICS components are\nprogrammable logic controllers. Various network devices used in ICS networks (referred to\nas the Hardware in the following table) were detected in 3% of cases.\n\n**_Table 14.

Percentage of Vulnerable and Secure ICS Systems\n\nAt least 42% of ICS systems available from the Internet contain vulnerabilities, which\ncan be easily exploited by an attacker. Almost the same number of systems (41%) are\nexposed to risk, but as it was mentioned above passive analysis is far from being reliable in\nidentifying vulnerabilities detected in them. Therefore, a significant part of vulnerable ICS\nsystems may hide in this unreachable area. The systems, which were proved secure in the\ncourse of the research, comprise only 17%.\n\n**_Table 15.

Vulnerability Types\n\nSecurity flaws related to configuration errors being the most common vulnerabilities\nwere detected in 36% of cases. They include an incorrect password policy (as well as the use\nof default passwords), access to sensitive information, wrong restriction of user rights, and\netc. The fourth part of vulnerabilities (25.35%) is connected with the lack of necessary\nsecurity updates.\n\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Table 16.

All similar systems are vulnerable in this country. The second place belongs to the\nCzech Republic (86%), the third — to Sweden (67%)[3]. Exactly the half (50%) of ICS systems\navailable from the Internet are vulnerable in Russia.\n\n3 Table 17 and picture 19 shows countries with a considerable number of SCADA systems available\nfrom the Internet.\n\n\n#### 41.97%\n\n 36.06%\n\n 25.35%\n\n\nSCADA Safety in Numbers\n\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Table 17.

Percentage of Vulnerable ICS Systems in Different Regions \n\nEurope pays the least attention to the issues of the ICS information security — 54% of\nindustrial automation systems located in this region are vulnerable and can be attacked\nremotely. South America is the second (39%), the third is Asia, where, as it is clear from the\nprevious section, insecure objects in Taiwan and South Korea are of the essence.\n\n**_Table 18.
