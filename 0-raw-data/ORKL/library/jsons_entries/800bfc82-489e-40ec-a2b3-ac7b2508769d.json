Iran’s Cyber Threat: Timeline](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/01/04/iran-s-cyber-threat-timeline-pub-75145)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is unique in that its most powerful officials—namely Supreme\nLeader Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—are inaccessible, while its\nmost accessible officials—including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif—are far less powerful.\nIran’s offensive cyber activities are almost exclusively overseen by the IRGC—likely without\nthe oversight of the country’s publicly “elected” officials—and composed of a scattered set of\nindependent contractors who mix security work, criminal fraud, and more banal software\ndevelopment. While the relationships between proxies and governments can range from\npassive support to complete control, Iran’s indigenous threat actors maintain an arm’s-length\nrelationship to the state, with certain operations orchestrated to meet the needs of the\ngovernment.36\n\n\nAfter successfully suppressing the 2009 Green Movement and first detecting the Stuxnet\nattack in 2010, Iranian threat actors conducted sustained campaigns against domestic and\nforeign adversaries. These indigenous operations appear to be performed by small groups of\nindividuals that have varying levels of technology experience with no more than ten people\nper team. These campaigns and the resources produced by the groups range from\nrudimentary to relatively professional, but most actors still face a low capacity ceiling.37\n\nThough U.S. officials and some cybersecurity companies have speculated that Tehran has\nreceived technical assistance from countries like Russia and North Korea, the level of\nsophistication is commensurate with the established practices of amateur hacking\ncommunities inside Iran.38 While Iranians have demonstrated talents in social engineering\nand embedding themselves in compromised networks, this alone is not indicative of external\ntraining or technological transfers.\n\n\nOn several occasions, Iranian threat actors have used off-the-shelf or pirated versions of\nprofessional penetration testing tools to conduct campaigns, but there is little indication of\nTehran acquiring exploits or malware from foreign governments. Iran has acquired hardware\nfor internet surveillance from Chinese telecommunication firms and maintains cooperative\nagreements with Russia on cybersecurity; however, these relationships differ from providing\nTehran with offensive cyber capabilities.39 No publicly documented or privately observed\nattack has demonstrated the use of tools or resources that are beyond the capacity of Iranian\nthreat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn principle, the tools and tactics used in cyber operations are subject to an exposure risk.\nUnlike conventional weapons, malware attacks or other cyber activities lose their\neffectiveness when discovered and when their functionality and infrastructure is documented.\nDescribing a missile does not provide effective countermeasures, but describing malware\ncan provide antivirus companies and system administrators the ability to protect systems.\nState-aligned threat actors will likely not employ the most sophisticated tools and strategies\navailable to them unless the target is well protected and worth potentially exposing tradecraft\nto compromise. However, unlike in other countries, there are not observed examples from\nIranian threat actors of escalation into more sophisticated attacks against hardened\ntargets.40\n\nIranian threat actors conduct campaigns with established toolkits that sometimes last for\nyears and ensnare hundreds of targets. However, the fluid nature and decentralization of\nthese groups make them relatively difficult to track. Malware that is publicly attributed to\nTehran is often abandoned immediately on exposure, and identifiable members appear to\nchange groups over time. Some groups seem to split up, have members move elsewhere, or\neven collaborate, further blurring lines.41 For example, while an IRGC-affiliated group labeled\nRocket Kitten was the most active operator for a two-year period (2014–2016), attracting\npress attention as Iran’s premiere threat, it has since faded into quiescence, eclipsed by the\nactor Oilrig.42\n\n\nDespite their substantial financial impact, Tehran’s disruptive operations against foreign\ntargets have been technically simple. The compromise of a small number of IT personnel\nenabled the destruction of data on computers maintained by Saudi Aramco, eventually\nresulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.43 In only a few campaigns have\nIranian threat actors shown the professionalism and sophistication approaching that\nexpected of a nation-state actor; in one such case, the operation could be tied directly to the\nMinistry of Intelligence (Magic Kitten, discussed later).44\n\nSuccess can often be attributed to security failures and to poor protection of infrastructure on\nthe part of the victim, alongside opportunistic targeting and patience by the attacker. The\ndefacement of Voice of America’s websites by the Iranian Cyber Army, one of the first\ndisruptive attacks by Iran against the United States, was accomplished through social\nengineering the news agency’s domain name service provider.45 Other basic security failures\ngave Iranians a toehold in the networks of Las Vegas Sands Corp. after its owner, Sheldon\nAdelson, advocated military force against Iran.46 Symantec, an American cybersecurity\ncompany, noted that the perpetrators of a recent Saudi-focused campaign had invested a\n“significant amount of preparatory work for the operation,” but the custom malware was\ndescribed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky as “generally of low quality” partially\nderived from open-source toolkits.47\n\n\nSimilarly, a major attack on the American financial sector—known as Operation Ababil—\nwhich caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, was described as one of the largest\nDDoS attacks known at the time Yet it took only a few young Iranian computer experts\n\n\n-----\n\nbreaching thousands of websites that were running vulnerable software, to pool enough\nbandwidth to overwhelm the infrastructure of banks and cause unpredicted software\nfailures.48 Thus, while Iranian threat actors have limited capacity, through basic tradecraft\nand persistence they can still be effective at espionage and sabotage.\n\nThe overall sophistication and dedication observed in such campaigns has not significantly\nchanged in the decade that Iran has engaged in offensive cyber operations—the attacks\ndocumented against Las Vegas Sands Corp. in 2014 are comparable to those used against\nSaudi Arabia in renewed hostilities over the course of 2016-2017. Indeed, many research\ndisclosures cover groups that have been active for several years, using the same malware\nwith only incremental changes over the course of time.\n\nWhile sophistication alone can be a superficial metric of posed threat, Iranian operations do\nnot demonstrate the common technical precautions taken by other nation-state actors (such\nas obfuscating malware), and, even with strong social engineering capabilities, attacks are\noften betrayed by a lack of investment in nontechnical resources (such as fluency in English\nor personal tailoring of messages).49 These resource constraints also account for why\nIranians are more effective at compromising dissidents—Iranian threat actors understand\ntheir target’s context and language, as opposed to when they are tasked with European\nlanguages or other cultures. Iran shows little indication of becoming a first-tier cyber power in\nthe foreseeable future unless it begins to further organize its operations and invest in\nprofessionalism.\n\n## Magic Kitten\n\n\nIn January 2015, the German news outlet Der Spiegel released previously unpublished\ndocuments on cyber espionage conducted by American intelligence agencies.50 One of them\nrevealed an NSA tactic labeled “fourth party collection,” which is the practice of breaking into\nthe command and control infrastructure of foreign-state-sponsored hackers to look over their\nshoulders. The presentation describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and\nstealing victims from a group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic\nKitten.\n\nMagic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors originating in\nIran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent relationship with the Iranian\nMinistry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC. However, Magic Kitten’s activities mirror those\nof other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran’s regional\nrivals. The earliest observed samples of Magic Kitten’s custom malware agent dates to 2007,\nwell before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be\nactive.\n\nMagic Kitten appears to exercise the most mature tradecraft of Iran-based threat actors. It\nhas opportunistically compromised dozens of websites at random (including those of an\nIndian hospital, an Italian architect, and a well-known Canadian comedian) to create a relay\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork to hide its operations. Such attention to tradecraft appears elsewhere in Magic\nKitten’s operations, including in the design of malware, which is modular in nature.\n\nMagic Kitten has not been observed using sophisticated exploits and instead appears to rely\non social engineering and other common tactics to deceive users. In the case of the\njournalist Vahid Pour Ostad, the malware was sent by his former Ministry of Intelligence\ninterrogator with a threat attached and relied on private records that would have been\navailable only to government actors. This coordination represents both independent\nconfirmation of the NSA’s attribution and an extreme example of the strategies employed by\nMagic Kitten. Other samples of the malware agent appear to have been delivered posing as\nTurkish asylum forums for Syrian refugees.\n\nThe NSA presentation also provides a window on Magic Kitten’s targets up to May 2011,\nportraying an operation focused on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. These\ncampaigns continued through the June 2013 presidential election of Hassan Rouhani,\nprovoking a blogpost from Google about related attacks.51 As the election approached,\nexposed logs showed the daily capture of dozens of accounts connected to Iranian cultural\nand media figures, graduate students, and social activists (including individuals that would\nlater join the Rouhani administration). Magic Kitten continued to target Iranians after the\nelection, attempting to unmask pseudonymous internet users by baiting them with content on\nwomen’s rights and the security establishment.\n\n\nLike other Iranian operations, Magic Kitten maintains a strong secondary interest in\nconducting espionage against regional targets and international foreign policy institutions.\nCrowdStrike, another American cybersecurity company, accounts for part of this focus on\n“international corporations, mainly in the technology sector” and other political targets.52 An\nNSA slide with a victim map portrays a broad-reaching operation targeting nearly every\ncountry in the Middle East. Sinkhole data collected from expired domains previously used as\nrelays and other fallback infrastructure suggest that Magic Kitten, or the malware agent used,\ncontinues to actively compromise individuals in Germany, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, the\nNetherlands, Palestine, Pakistan, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United\nArab Emirates. Notably, compromised individuals in Iraq were also typically in Iraqi\nKurdistan, mirroring a common pattern with other threat actors.\n\nA diagram within the NSA presentation suggests that the malware agent employed by Magic\nKitten was also used at the time by Iran’s Shia Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, under\nindependent infrastructure. While Hezbollah has been known to maintain its own offensive\ncyber operations and engage in intelligence sharing with Iran, there has been little prior\nevidence of direct sharing of tools.53\n\n## Understanding Iranian Government Involvement and Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is often difficult to determine the origins and perpetrators of Iranian offensive cyber\noperations, as these campaigns may disappear as quickly as they appear. Public exposure\noften leads them to change tactics and abandon tools, making tracking even more difficult.\nThe history of cyber operations targeting Iranians and originating from Iran is populated by\ngroups that arise out of nowhere and conduct campaigns for ambiguous reasons over a finite\ntime span, then disappear. This unusually frenetic character conspicuously differentiates the\nIranian hacking ecosystem from that found elsewhere, particularly those tied to state actors\nin advanced countries.\n\nThe history of cyber operations targeting Iranians and originating from Iran is populated\nby groups that arise out of nowhere and conduct campaigns for ambiguous reasons\nover a finite time span, then disappear.\n\nThe amateur hackers connected to the Iranian defacement community have long been\npolitically engaged and have often vandalized foreign sites for ostensibly nationalistic\nreasons.54 In one of the first international incidents attributed to Iran, domestic hacking\ngroups in mid-2008 exchanged tit-for-tat defacements with competitors in neighboring Arab\ncountries after the official sites of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani were vandalized with antiShia content by an Emirati hacker. Such defacement activities can often evolve into stateaffiliated activities: one of the participants in the anti-Sunni website-defacement campaign in\n2008 was later linked to the Iranian Cyber Army. This transition from patriotic hackers to\nstate-aligned threat actors, and the ambiguity between civic nationalism and state\ninvolvement, mirrors the apparent development of cyber communities in China and\nelsewhere.55\n\n\nIn only two incidents have Iranian government entities taken direct credit for the defacement\nof political opposition sites, both attributed to branches of the Revolutionary Guard. The first\ncase was the March 2010 takedown of sites connected to the organization Human Rights\nActivists in Iran, which was alleged to be training cadres to mobilize against the regime like\nthe Velvet Revolution. The attack relied on the arrest of a website administrator inside the\ncountry rather than on complicated tactics. The arrests and destruction of data had a lasting\nimpact on the organization by instilling fear in members and giving rise to rumors about\ncollaboration with the government.\n\nThe second government-initiated campaign, carried out during a Shia holiday in December\n2013, led to the defacement of nine human rights and independent media websites with a\nQuranic verse in Arabic and Persian. The IRGC’s Public Relations Department announced\nthat the operation had been conducted by the Revolutionary Guard’s Kerman Branch and\nclaimed that the defaced websites had been established by the country’s enemies and\nsupported by internal seditionists.\n\nIn most cases, Iran uses cutout or proxy organizations, allowing it to keep some distance\nfrom the disruptive incidents and propagandistic defacements. These cutouts represent\nthemselves as patriotic Iranians or pan-Islamic movements acting independently in defense\n\n\n-----\n\nof the supreme leader, national sovereignty, and religious ideals. Conducting offensive cyber\noperations through covert organizations provides Tehran plausible deniability for any attacks,\nthereby protecting its claim to victimhood while also allowing the state to signal its intentions\nto its opponents. These tactics are effective: there is still no definitive public agreement on\nwho was behind the Yemen Cyber Army’s attacks that led to stolen Saudi Arabian Ministry of\nForeign Affairs documents being published by WikiLeaks, with the consensus split between\nIran and Russia.56 The cutouts tend to develop their own mythology and continue to be\ntreated as active threats past their expiration date, bolstering perceptions of Iran’s capability.\n\nConducting offensive cyber operations through covert organizations provides Tehran\nplausible deniability for any attacks, thereby protecting its claim to victimhood while\nalso allowing the state to signal its intentions to its opponents.\n\nNevertheless, a comprehensive study of Iran-linked cyber operations often reveals Tehran’s\nhand in such proxies. When the U.S. Justice Department unsealed its Operation Ababil\nindictment in March 2016, it named two Iranian corporate entities that employed at least\nseven individuals who had been contracted by the Iranian government.57 The indictment\nimplicated three of the participants as being part of the Sun Army, an Iranian cutout\ndefacement group. The Sun Army followed the typical pattern found with the Iranian Cyber\nArmy and other state-aligned defacements, arising out of nowhere to perform targeted\npolitical acts over a short life span. Its first documented defacements, in February 2010, were\nof sites connected to now-detained opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi. The vandalism\naccused him of being a traitor and was timed to blunt planned antigovernment street\nprotests.58\n\n\nAs Iran’s cybersecurity landscape has professionalized, some defacement groups have\nsought to convert their infamy into corporate success. Based on the disclosure of personal\ninformation about threat actors, there are indications that those engaged in Iranian offensive\ncyber operations work within corporate entities (such as IT consultancies) or contractors of\nIranian security forces.59 For example, aspects of the Madi espionage campaign implicated\nthe Mortal Kombat Underground Security Team, a small Iranian group that has attempted to\nsell spyware and other hacking tools since at least 2008.60 The frequent overlap of legitimate\ndigital commerce sites and servers used for intrusion campaigns is demonstrative of these\nblurred lines—a company might simultaneously provide web design services for businesses\nand hack for the government.61\n\nThe transition of amateur hackers into contractors for state security agencies is reflected in\nbasic qualities and patterns of life found across most threat actors. There are clear\nindications that the threat actors documented are solely Iranians operating inside Iran, not\ndiaspora Iranians or non-Iranians. At the most basic level, they tend to follow the normal\npatterns of life of office workers, being active during the Iranian workweek (Saturday through\nWednesday) and dormant during Iranian holidays, particularly the long holiday of Nowruz,\nthe Persian New Year.\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian threat actors have often used pornography as bait in their spearphishing\ncampaigns and display an irreverent sense of humor.\n\nDisclosures of aliases and real names, which may be discoverable because of a disregard\nfor operational security due to insulation from repercussions or a lack of professionalism,\nhelp reveal both the lives and the motivations of Iranian threat actors. While those behind the\ngroups may be nationalists or ideologically aligned with the regime, they do not appear to be\nenrolled members of the military or security apparatus. These individuals and groups also\ndiffer in social and religious predilections; some participants promote the use of narcotics\nand trade pornography on personal social media, while others are devoutly religious and\nembed Islamic references in malware code. Iranian threat actors have often used\npornography as bait in their spearphishing campaigns and display an irreverent sense of\nhumor.\n\n## Criteria for Independent Assessment of State Involvement\n\nCampaigns conducted against dissidents and others inside Iran provide the most direct\nevidence of government involvement. Whereas it can be difficult to trace the consequences\nof foreign espionage, for those on the ground the implications are more direct and tangible.62\nAs a pattern builds between cyber operations and the offline actions of security forces, the\nrelationship between both becomes clearer.63 While these cases of collaboration are\ndiscernible in only a few threat actors, the patterns support a broader narrative around the\nintrusion ecosystem.64 Indications that Iranians undertaking offensive cyber operations are\nassociated with the government include the following:\n\n\nThe campaigns have been conducted based on information that appears to have been\nprovided by security agencies. In certain cases, the campaigns have been carried out\nin coordination with government employees and in advance of the arrest of the target.\nThe targets of such operations align with the sensitivities of the Islamic Republic, and\ncertain individuals are targeted repeatedly by multiple threat actors over time.\nPersistent and costly campaigns have been sustained against thousands of targets\nwithout an apparent financial motive and without clear indication of the end use of the\ndata obtained by intrusion.\n\nIn rare cases, potential ties to the government are even disclosed by the participants\nthemselves. A malware developer associated with the Rocket Kitten group, Yaser Balaghi,\nwas identified by name based on a pseudonym found in the malware’s code. In a résumé\nfrom 2013, Balaghi listed past information security projects and a history of conducting\nhacking projects under contract to an otherwise unnamed “cyber-organization.”65 Balaghi is\nnot alone in listing his hacking activities on his résumé; still other pseudonyms embedded in\nmalware code used against Saudi Arabia and internal dissidents can be associated with\nLinkedIn profiles describing their experience as an “Information Security Researcher” with a\n“Secret” group.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo add a complication common in cybersecurity research, it is often difficult to distinguish\ncommonplace electronic fraud from politically motivated disruptions and state-sponsored\nsurveillance efforts, especially where the attacks are not sophisticated. In at least one case,\nIranians that had staged persistent attempts against U.S. foreign policy organizations and\ntwo European foreign ministries had also maintained infrastructure linked with commercial\nbanking fraud.66 In another example, the same social engineering skills used by an individual\nbehind the Iranian Cyber Army defacements also proved successful in a career in the\ncommercial theft of domains and PayPal fraud. More recently, in an indictment against an\nIranian accused of attempting to extort HBO with stolen copies of unreleased television\nepisodes in the summer of 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice claimed that the same\nindividual had worked on behalf of the Iranian government to target military systems and\nIsraeli infrastructure.67\n\nAnalyses of Iranian offensive cyber operations often rest on the country’s strict domestic\ncontrols as an indication of endorsement—that the government would not allow something to\nhappen that it didn’t want to occur. However, Tehran’s controls are not so absolute, and\nmany of the operations could occur surreptitiously given their simplicity. Cyber activity\nemanating from Iran could theoretically be conducted without the state’s sanction, consent,\nor even knowledge. Daily, millions of Iranians circumvent censorship using antifiltering tools\nthat allow them to bypass network restrictions and encrypt their communications against\nsurveillance. These tools provide space for Iranians to engage in actions against the\ngovernment without persecution, and similarly can conceal cyber activities. Therefore, an\nIranian origin does not alone indicate state sponsorship.\n\nNor does the financial damage resulting from an operation, the political implications of the\ncampaign, or the number of targets necessarily directly correlate with the probability of\ngovernment involvement. The destructive operations conducted against Saudi Aramco\nresulted in millions of dollars in damages, yet the malware was unsophisticated and the\nattack did not require significant resources, putting the incident plausibly within reach of a\nsole individual acting without sponsorship. Such straightforward metrics of harm, then, are\npoorly informative of the degree of governmental involvement in cyber activities originating\nfrom Iran.\n\n## Government Entities and Threat Actors\n\nThe coordinated timing of cyber operations with politically motivated arrests are a strong\nindication of the Iranian government’s direct involvement. Since at least July 2014 a pattern\nhas emerged: individuals in the custody of the IRGC are forced to provide access to their\nonline accounts and devices, which are then immediately used to conduct spearphishing\nattacks associated with known threat actors.\n\nA vivid example of this coordination is the case of Iranian-American Siamak Namazi, a fortysix-year-old Dubai-based energy consultant and previously a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson\nInternational Center for Scholars in Washington, DC. In October 2015, he was arrested by\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian security forces months after having had his passport confiscated while visiting the\ncountry. Within hours of his arrest, Namazi’s Google and Facebook accounts initiated\nconversations with his wide array of foreign policy and media contacts. The intruder,\npretending to be Namazi, sent contacts an article about the recent nuclear deal and in poor\nEnglish solicited edits on the document. This message was accompanied by an email\ndirecting the target to a fake Google site requiring visitors sign in to their account to view the\ndocument, a credential theft attempt connected to Rocket Kitten. Numerous individuals were\ncompromised in this campaign, including scholars, U.S. State Department employees, and\none prominent journalist whose Gmail account—which included communications with former\nU.S. secretaries of state, CIA directors, and other foreign ministers—was overtaken by the\nIranian hackers for nearly two days. 68 This pattern has been repeated in numerous cases\ninvolving other Iranians, dual nationals, and foreign nationals detained in Iran.\n\nCyber operations have also been documented in preparation for arrests.69 A prominent\nexample of target selection prior to arrest is the case of Babak Zanjani, an Iranian-Danish\nbusinessman who had been personally sanctioned by the United States and European Union\nfor involvement in Iranian sanctions evasion. After months of claims regarding his role in the\nembezzlement of oil revenue, a process that included a parliamentary investigation, at the\nend of December 2013 Zanjani was arrested and subsequently charged with “corruption on\nearth.”70 After an opaque judicial process, in March 2016 he was condemned to death, a\nsentence the Ministry of Justice indicated could be commuted if Zanjani cooperated in\nrecovering Iran’s foreign assets.\n\n\nThis overarching trend points to probable relationships between certain threat actors\nand the intelligence agencies, a business relationship that has been revealed when\nIranians have been indicted by the United States for hacking.\n\nA persistent effort targeted Zanjani’s personal accounts and business infrastructure in the\nweeks immediately preceding his arrest. Iranian threat actors sought access to Zanjani’s\niCloud services and successfully compromised employees associated with his holding\ncompany, the Sorinet Group.71 These activities indicate that in advance of the arrest of\nZanjani, the group (Flying Kitten) had acquired access to the confidential information of\nSorinet subsidiaries and personnel; however, it is not clear whether any material accessed\nduring this time was used in the investigation or prosecution of Zanjani. The case of Zanjani\nreflects a broader trend witnessed with other cases; Iranian threat actors frequently pursue\nonline the types of individuals commonly persecuted by the Islamic Republic offline.\n\n\nThe association between Iranian-origin cyber activities and Iran’s intelligence agencies is\nfurther supported by the fact that the data acquired during such operations is rarely\ndisclosed. The Navy Marine Corps Intranet breach, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. incident, and\nthe compromise of State Department employees have all led to the exfiltration of substantial\namounts of highly sensitive information. There is no indication of ulterior motives, such as\nfraud, extortion, humiliation, or disclosure to the hardline press.72 The operations required\ncostly infrastructure including dedicated servers and dozens of domain names in addition to\n\n\n-----\n\npersonnel time. The activities must have provided some degree of income to their members,\nwith the primary value being espionage. This overarching trend points to probable\nrelationships between certain threat actors and the intelligence agencies, a business\nrelationship that has been revealed when Iranians have been indicted by the United States\nfor hacking.\n\n## Notes\n\n36 Ibid.\n\n\n37 The tools and resources developed by Tehran have been almost uniformly described by\n\noutside investigators as unsophisticated, particularly in comparison with malware produced\nby other state and nonstate actors. The information security company Mandiant affirmed this\nobservation in a 2014 report: “Mandiant’s observations of suspected Iranian actors have not\nprovided any indication that they possess the range of tools or capabilities that are hallmarks\nof a capable, full-scope cyber actor. They rely on publicly available tools and capitalize solely\non Web-based vulnerabilities—constraints that suggest these cyber actors have relatively\nlimited capabilities.” See: Mandiant, “M-Trends 2014 Annual Threat Report: Beyond the\nBreach by Mandiant, a FireEye Company,” accessed December 5, 2017,\n[https://www2.fireeye.com/fireeye-mandiant-m-trends-report.](https://www2.fireeye.com/fireeye-mandiant-m-trends-report)\n\n38 For example, former representative Peter Hoekstra speculated at a U.S. House hearing\n\nthat Iran’s advances in cyberwarfare came from the “cooperation they have with Russia.”\nOther former and current officials have commented, often on background, that Russia was a\npotential partner in warfare. For the subcommittee hearing on Iran’s support terrorism\nworldwide, see the following: “Iran’s Support for Terrorism Worldwide,” Foreign Affairs\nCommittee, March 4, 2014, https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/joint-subcommitteehearing-irans-support-for-terrorism-worldwide/ . Elsewhere, claims have been made by\nlesser known cybersecurity companies, but these analyses have been flawed and not well\naccepted. For more on these flawed analyses, see: Collin Anderson, “Bears and Kittens, and\nStartup Cybersecurity Companies,” Medium, May 18, 2017,\nhttps://medium.com/@collina/bears-and-kittens-and-startup-cybersecurity-companies5c8e037ea75c .\n\n\n39 Steve Stecklow, “Exclusive: Huawei Partner Offered U.S. Tech to Iran,” Reuters, October\n\n25, 2012, http://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-iran/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-us-tech-to-iran-idUSBRE89O0E520121025 ; and “Iran and Russia Announce Plans for Cyber\nSecurity Cooperation,” YouTube video, 2:03, posted by “PressTV News Videos,” March 15,\n[2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaCukjiECWM.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaCukjiECWM)\n\n40 This could be either indicative of the ceiling of Iran’s capabilities or reflective of Iran not\n\nfacing the sort of existential threat that would provoke it to use any latent resources in its\narsenal. The former appears more likely.\n\n\n-----\n\nRocket Kitten and Flying Kitten are examples of how the line demarcating intrusion groups\nis not always clear. The structural similarities of certain intrusion tools and the reuse of lesser\nknown infrastructure indicate that parts of Flying Kitten and Rocket Kitten may have had a\ncommon heritage, including common members and shared tools; see: Collin Anderson,\n“Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code,” Iran Threats,\n[December 5, 2017, https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten/. In](https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten/)\nthe Shamoon 2 campaign, McAfee attributed unusual errors to the “involvement of different\ngroups/individuals with different skills, whereas in 2012 we believe one group was\nresponsible for the attack.” See: Christiaan Beek and Raj Samani, “The State of Shamoon:\nSame Actor, Different Lines,” McAfee, April 25, 2017,\nhttps://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/executive-perspectives/state-shamoon-actor-differentlines/.\n\n42 The authors associate Rocket Kitten with the IRGC due to its involvement in post-arrest\n\nhacking.

No official numbers have been provided on the economic loss, and in\nits annual review report for the year, Aramco downplayed the impact of the attack. “Shaping\nTomorrow: 2012 Annual Review,” Saudi Aramco, April 10, 2013,\nhttp://www.saudiaramco.com/en/home/news-media/publications/corporate-reports/annualreview-2012.html.\n\n44 The caveat attending this statement is that it is possible more incidents and actors have\n\nyet to be disclosed.\n\n\n45 Based on a Freedom of Information Act request by the authors to the Broadcasting Board\n\nof Governors on cybersecurity incidents related to Iran, which returned details of the attack,\ninvolving compromising the VOA’s account through impersonation with falsified documents\nsent through a fax.\n\n46 The intruders were able to find a weakness in a web development server for the\n\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania, location, and doing so then gave them access to the internal\ncorporate network.

Nicole Perlroth, “Google Says It Has Uncovered Iranian\nSpy Campaign,” Bits (blog), New York Times, June 12, 2013,\nhttps://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/google-says-it-has-uncovered-iranian-spycampaign/.\n\n\n52 “CrowdStrike Global Threat Report: 2013 Year in Review,” CrowdStrike, January 2014,\n\nhttps://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Threat_Intelligence/CrowdStrike%20%20Global%20Threat%20Report%202013.pdf.\n\n53 The lack of clarity in the slides is also compounded by the age of the document and could\n\nreflect an arrangement that is no longer in effect. However, within observations of activity,\nthere does appear to be a clustering of victims, with some samples of the malware agent\nspecifically used to compromise Lebanese and Qatari victims, but not Iranians or other\ntargets of exclusive interest to Iran.\n\n\n54 Members of the infamous Ashiyane hacking community and others commonly broke into\n\nArabic media and U.S. government sites with political messages, such as protesting\nalternative names for the Persian Gulf, Western perceptions of Islam, nuclear rights, the\nadministration of George W Bush and the crimes of other countries—often in broken\n\n\n-----\n\nEnglish and always bearing attribution.

For\n\nexample, Iranian telecommunications firms appear to have cooperated with the government\nin order to provide access to the recovery and two-factor authentication codes sent by text.\nThese then allowed access to Google, Telegram, and other accounts on foreign platforms.\n\n\n63 The most significant counterevidence of state-alignment is that when the Infy group was\n\ndisclosed by Palo Alto in May 2016, the domains used in the communications of the malware\nwere filtered by the censorship apparatus, blocking access to those victims. There are\nexplanations for this action that would not conflict with the theory that Infy was acting on\nbehalf of the government, including that the censorship was intended to hide evidence of the\noperation from the Iranian public.\n\n64 Specifically, we observed direct interactions between the Iranian state and the groups\n\nCharming Kitten, Flying Kitten, Magic Kitten, and Rocket Kitten. More tenuous links exist for\nInfy based on this criteria.\n\n\n65 “Rocket Kitten: A Campaign With 9 Lives,” Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.,\n\nNovember 9, 2015, https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kittenreport.pdf.\n\n66 The incident was orchestrated by a threat actor who had registered domains under\n\ncmprus1394[@]mail[.]ru and teymurov1984[@]gmail[.]com, which impacts a vast network of\nespionage and criminal activity.\n\n\n67 _United States of America v.
