    "plain_text": "# GreyEnergy: Updated arsenal of one of the most dangerous threat actors\n\n**[welivesecurity.com/2018/10/17/greyenergy-updated-arsenal-dangerous-threat-actors/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/17/greyenergy-updated-arsenal-dangerous-threat-actors/)**\n\nOctober 17, 2018\n\nESET research reveals a successor to the infamous BlackEnergy APT group targeting\ncritical infrastructure, quite possibly in preparation for damaging attacks\n\nRecent ESET research has uncovered details of the successor of the BlackEnergy APT\ngroup, whose main toolset was last seen in December 2015 during the first-ever blackout\ncaused by a cyberattack. Around the time of that breakthrough incident, when around\n230,000 people were left without electricity, we started detecting another malware\nframework and named it GreyEnergy. It has since been used to attack energy companies\nand other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland for the past three years.\n\nIt is important to note that when we describe ‘APT groups’, we’re making connections based\non technical indicators such as code similarities, shared C&C infrastructure, malware\nexecution chains, and so on. We’re typically not directly involved in the investigation and\nidentification of the individuals writing the malware and/or deploying it, and the interpersonal\nrelations between them. Furthermore, the term ‘APT group’ is very loosely defined, and\noften used merely to cluster the abovementioned malware indicators. This is also one of the\nreasons why we refrain from speculation with regard to attributing attacks to nation states\nand such.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have already extensively documented the threat actors transition towards TeleBots in\n[cyberattacks on high-value targets in the Ukrainian financial sector, the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/) supply-chain\nattacks against Ukraine and in an [analysis of TeleBots’ cunning backdoor. All from the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/07/04/analysis-of-telebots-cunning-backdoor/)\ngroup most notable for the NotPetya ransomware outbreak. At the same time, we have also\nbeen keeping a close eye on GreyEnergy – a subgroup operating in parallel, but with\nsomewhat different motivations and targeting.\n\nAlthough ESET telemetry data shows GreyEnergy malware activity over the last three\nyears, this APT group has not been documented until now. This is probably due to the fact\nthat those activities haven’t been destructive in nature, unlike the numerous TeleBots\nransomware campaigns (not only NotPetya), the BlackEnergy-enabled power grid attack,\n[and the Industroyer-caused blackout – which we have linked to these groups for the first](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/)\ntime last week. Instead, the threat actors behind GreyEnergy have tried to stay under the\nradar, focusing on espionage and reconnaissance, quite possibly in preparation of future\ncybersabotage attacks or laying the groundwork for an operation run by some other APT\ngroup.\n\nGreyEnergy’s malware framework bears many similarities to BlackEnergy, as outlined\nbelow. It is similarly modular in construction, so its functionality is dependent on the\nparticular combination of modules its operator uploads to each of the targeted victim\nsystems. The modules that we have observed were used for espionage and\nreconnaissance purposes (i.e. backdoor, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging,\npassword and credential stealing, etc.). We have not observed any modules that specifically\ntarget Industrial Control Systems (ICS). We have, however, observed that the GreyEnergy\noperators have been strategically targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA\nsoftware and servers, which tend to be mission-critical systems never meant to go offline\nexcept for periodic maintenance.\n\n[GreyEnergy: A successor to BlackEnergy](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ESET_GreyEnergy.pdf)\n\n[Download Research Paper](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ESET_GreyEnergy.pdf)\n\n## Links to BlackEnergy and TeleBots\n\nSome of the reasons ESET researchers consider BlackEnergy and GreyEnergy related are\nlisted below:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe appearance of GreyEnergy in the wild coincides with the disappearance of\nBlackEnergy.\nAt least one of the victims targeted by GreyEnergy had been targeted by BlackEnergy\nin the past. Both subgroups share an interest in the energy sector and critical\ninfrastructure. Both have had victims primarily in Ukraine, with Poland ranking second.\nThere are strong architectural similarities between the malware frameworks. Both are\nmodular, and both employ a “mini”, or light, backdoor deployed before admin rights\nare obtained and the full version is deployed.\nAll remote C&C servers used by the GreyEnergy malware were active Tor relays. This\nhas also been the case with BlackEnergy and Industroyer. We hypothesize that this is\nan operational security technique used by the group so that the operators can connect\nto these servers in a covert manner.\n\nCompared to BlackEnergy, GreyEnergy is a more modern toolkit with an even greater focus\non stealth. One basic stealth technique – employed by both families – is to push only\nselected modules to selected targets, and only when needed. On top of that, some\nGreyEnergy modules are partially encrypted using AES-256 and some remain fileless –\nrunning only in memory – with the intention of hindering analysis and detection. To cover\ntheir tracks, typically, GreyEnergy’s operators securely wipe the malware components from\nthe victims’ hard drives.\n\nIn addition to the outlined similarities with BlackEnergy, we have observed another link\nbetween GreyEnergy and the TeleBots subgroup. In December 2016, we noticed an\ninstance of GreyEnergy deploying an early version of the TeleBots’ NotPetya worm – half a\nyear before it was altered, improved, and deployed in the most damaging ransomware\noutbreak in history. There is significant code reuse between this ransomware component\nand the GreyEnergy core module. We call this early version “Moonraker Petya”, based on\nthe malware writers’ choice of filename – most likely a reference to the James Bond movie.\nIt didn’t feature the infamous EternalBlue spreading mechanism, as it had not been leaked\nat that time.\n\n\n-----\n\n## GreyEnergy Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\nWe have observed two distinct infection vectors: “traditional” spearphishing, and the\ncompromise of public-facing web servers. When such a vulnerable web server was hosted\ninternally and connected to the rest of a targeted organization’s network, the attacker would\nattempt to move laterally to other workstations. This technique is used not only as a primary\ninfection vector but also as a backup reinfection vector.\n\nThe attackers typically deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims’ networks. Such proxy\nC&Cs redirect requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C server\non the internet. This is another stealth tactic, as it is less suspicious to a defender to see\nthat multiple computers are “talking” to an internal server, rather than a remote one.\n\nA very curious observation – one that is also indicative of the group’s targeting – is that\nsome of the GreyEnergy samples we detected were signed with a certificate from\nAdvantech, a Taiwanese manufacturer of industrial and IoT hardware. These were most\n[likely stolen from the company, just as in the case of Stuxnet and a](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2010/07/19/win32stuxnet-signed-binaries/) recent Plead malware\ncampaign.\n\nThe GreyEnergy operators also employ common external tools in their arsenal, such as\nMimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the GreyEnergy toolset and operations refer to our white paper\n[GreyEnergy: A successor to BlackEnergy.
