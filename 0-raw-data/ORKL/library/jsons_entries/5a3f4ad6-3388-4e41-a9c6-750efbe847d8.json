Given the scale of those campaigns, the activity identified here is likely to reflect just a small portion of the threat actor’s operations.\n\n This report is primarily fact-based. Where we have made an assessment this has been made clear by phraseology such as “we assess”, and the use of estimative language as outlined in Appendix A.\n\n By publicly releasing this research, PwC UK and BAE Systems hope to facilitate broad awareness of the attack techniques used so that prevention and detection capabilities can be configured accordingly. It is also hoped that rapid progress can be made within the broader security community to further develop the understanding of the campaign techniques we outline, leading to additional public reports from peers across the security community.\n\n As a part of our research and reporting effort, PwC UK and BAE Systems have collaborated with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) under its Certified Incident Response (CIR) scheme to engage and notify managed IT service providers, known affected organisations and other national bodies.\n\n Supplementary to this report, an Annex containing our technical analysis will be released.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Executive summary\n\nSince late 2016, PwC UK and BAE Systems have been assisting victims of a new cyber espionage campaign conducted by a\nChina-based threat actor. We assess this threat actor to almost certainly be the same as the threat actor widely known within\nthe security community as ‘APT10’. The campaign, which we refer to as Operation Cloud Hopper, has targeted managed IT\nservice providers (MSPs), allowing APT10 unprecedented potential access to the intellectual property and sensitive data of\nthose MSPs and their clients globally. A number of Japanese organisations have also been directly targeted in a separate,\nsimultaneous campaign by the same actor.\n\nWe have identified a number of key findings that are detailed below.\n\n\n**_APT10 has recently unleashed a sustained campaign_**\n**_against MSPs. The compromise of MSP networks has_**\n**_provided broad and unprecedented access to MSP customer_**\n**_networks._**\n\n- Multiple MSPs were almost certainly being targeted from\n\n2016 onwards, and it is likely that APT10 had already\nbegun to do so from as early as 2014.\n\n- MSP infrastructure has been used as part of a complex web\n\nof exfiltration routes spanning multiple victim networks.\n\n**_APT10 has significantly increased its scale and capability_**\n**_since early 2016, including the addition of new custom_**\n**_tools._**\n\n- APT10 ceased its use of the Poison Ivy malware family\n\nafter a 2013 FireEye report, which comprehensively\ndetailed the malware’s functionality and features, and its\nuse by several China-based threat actors, including APT10.\n\n- APT10 primarily used PlugX malware from 2014 to 2016,\n\nprogressively improving and deploying newer versions,\nwhile simultaneously standardising their command and\ncontrol function.\n\n- We have observed a shift towards the use of bespoke\n\nmalware as well as open-source tools, which have been\ncustomised to improve their functionality. This is highly\nlikely to be indicative of an increase in sophistication.\n\n\n**_Infrastructure observed in APT10’s most recent campaigns_**\n**_links to previous activities undertaken by the threat actor._**\n\n- The command and control infrastructure used for\n\nOperation Cloud Hopper is predominantly dynamic-DNS\ndomains, which are highly interconnected and link to the\nthreat actor’s previous operations. The number of\ndynamic-DNS domains in use by the threat actor has\nsignificantly increased since 2016, representative of an\nincrease in operational tempo.\n\n- Some top level domains used in the direct targeting of\n\nJapanese entities share common IP address space with the\nnetwork of dynamic-DNS domains that we associate with\nOperation Cloud Hopper.\n\n**_APT10 focuses on espionage activity, targeting intellectual_**\n**_property and other sensitive data._**\n\n- APT10 is known to have exfiltrated a high volume of data\n\nfrom multiple victims, exploiting compromised MSP\nnetworks, and those of their customers, to stealthily move\nthis data around the world.\n\n- The targeted nature of the exfiltration we have observed,\n\nalong with the volume of the data, is reminiscent of the\nprevious era of APT campaigns pre-2013.\n\n**_PwC UK and BAE Systems assess APT10 as highly likely to_**\n**_be a China-based threat actor._**\n\n- It is a widely held view within the cyber security\n\ncommunity that APT10 is a China-based threat actor.\n\n- Our analysis of the compile times of malware binaries, the\n\nregistration times of domains attributed to APT10, and the\nmajority of its intrusion activity indicates a pattern of work\nin line with China Standard Time (UTC+8).\n\n- The threat actor’s targeting of diplomatic and political\n\norganisations in response to geopolitical tensions, as well\nas the targeting of specific commercial enterprises, is\nclosely aligned with strategic Chinese interests.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APT10 as a China-based threat actor\n\n#### APT10 as a China-based threat actor\n\n\nPwC UK and BAE Systems assess it is highly likely that APT10\nis a China-based threat actor with a focus on espionage and\nwide ranging information collection. It has been in operation\nsince at least 2009, and has evolved its targeting from an early\nfocus on the US defence industrial base (DIB)[1] and the\ntechnology and telecommunications sector, to a widespread\ncompromise of multiple industries and sectors across the\nglobe, most recently with a focus on MSPs.\n\nAPT10, a name originally coined by FireEye, is also referred to\nas Red Apollo by PwC UK, CVNX by BAE Systems, Stone\nPanda by CrowdStrike, and menuPass Team more broadly in\nthe public domain. The threat actor has previously been the\nsubject of a range of open source reporting, including most\nnotably a report by FireEye comprehensively detailing the\nthreat actor’s use of the Poison Ivy malware family[2] and blog\nposts by Trend Micro[3] similarly detailing the use of EvilGrab\nmalware.\n\nAlongside the research and ongoing tracking of APT10 by\nboth PwC UK and BAE’s Threat Intelligence teams, PwC UK’s\nIncident Response team has been engaged in supporting\ninvestigations linked to APT10 compromises. This research\nhas contributed to the assessments and conclusions we have\ndrawn regarding the recent campaign activity by APT10,\nwhich represents a shift from previous activities linked to the\nthreat actor.\n\n\nAs a result of our analysis of APT10’s activities, we believe that\nit almost certainly benefits from significant staffing and\nlogistical resources, which have increased over the last three\nyears, with a significant step-change in 2016. Due to the scale\nof the threat actor’s operations throughout 2016 and 2017, we\nsimilarly assess it currently comprises multiple teams, each\nresponsible for a different section of the day-to-day\noperations, namely domain registration, infrastructure\nmanagement, malware development, target operations, and\nanalysis.\n\nAPT10 withdrew from direct targeting using Poison Ivy in\n2013 and conducted its first known retooling operation,\nupgrading its capabilities and replatforming to use PlugX. It is\nhighly likely that this is due to the release of the 2013 FireEye\nreport.\n\nOur report will detail the most recent campaigns conducted\nby APT10, including the sustained targeting of MSPs, which\nwe have named Operation Cloud Hopper, and the targeting of\na number of Japanese institutions.\n\n\n1 The defence industrial base comprises the US Department of Defense and a plethora of companies that support the design, development and\nmaintenance of defence assets and enable US military requirements to be met. https://www.dhs.gov/defense-industrial-base-sector\n2 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-poison-ivy.pdf\n3 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/evilgrab-malware-family-used-in-targeted-attacks-in-asia/\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Time-based analysis of APT10’s operations\n\n\nAs part of our analysis, we have made a number of\nobservations about APT10 and its profile, which supports our\nassessment that APT10 is a China-based threat actor. For\nexample, we have identified patterns within the domain\nregistrations and file compilation times associated with\nAPT10 activity. This is almost certainly indicative of a threat\nactor based in the UTC+8 time zone, which aligns to Chinese\nStandard Time (CST).\n\n**Figure 1: APT10 domain registration times in UTC**\n\n\nShown in Figure 1 are registration times[4], represented in UTC,\nfor known APT10 top level domains since mid-2016, which\nmark a major uptick in APT10 activity.\n\nMapping this to UTC+8, as in Figure 2, shows a standard set\nof Chinese business hours, including a two-hour midday\nbreak.\n\n\nApr 2017\n\nMar 2017\n\nFeb 2017\n\nJan 2017\n\nDec 2016\n\nNov 2016\n\nOct 2016\n\nSep 2016\n\nAug 2016\n\n00:00 02:00 04:00 06:00 08:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00\n01:00 03:00 05:00 07:00 09:00 11:00 13:00 15:00 17:00 19:00 21:00 23:00\n\n\n**Figure 2: APT10 domain registration times in UTC+8**\n\nApr 2017\n\nMar 2017\n\nFeb 2017\n\nJan 2017\n\nDec 2016\n\nNov 2016\n\nOct 2016\n\nSep 2016\n\n\nAug 2016\n\n00:00 02:00 04:00 06:00 08:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00\n01:00 03:00 05:00 07:00 09:00 11:00 13:00 15:00 17:00 19:00 21:00 23:00\n\n\n**Time of Day (UTC)**\n\nFurther analysis of the compile times of PlugX, RedLeaves and\nQuasar malware samples used by APT10 reveals a similar\npattern in working hours, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n**Time of Day (UTC+8)**\n\nShifting this to UTC+8 shows a similar timeframe of\noperation to the domain registrations. There are some\noutliers, which are likely attributable to the operational\nnature of this threat actor, such as requirements to work\noutside normal business hours.\n\n\n**Figure 3: Compile times of PlugX, RedLeaves and Quasar in UTC**\n\nJul 2017\n\nJan 2017\n\nJul 2015\n\nJan 2016\n\nJul 2015\n\nJan 2015\n\nJul 2014\n\nJan 2014\n\n\n**Figure 4: Compile times of PlugX, RedLeaves and Quasar in UTC+8**\n\nJul 2017\n\nJan 2017\n\nJul 2015\n\nJan 2016\n\nJul 2015\n\nJan 2015\n\nJul 2014\n\nJan 2014\n\n\nJul 2013\n\n00:00 02:00 04:00 06:00 08:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00\n\n01:00 03:00 05:00 07:00 09:00 11:00 13:00 15:00 17:00 19:00 21:00 23:00\n\n\nJul 2013\n\n00:00 02:00 04:00 06:00 08:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00\n\n01:00 03:00 05:00 07:00 09:00 11:00 13:00 15:00 17:00 19:00 21:00 23:00\n\n\n**Time of Day (UTC)**\n\n\n**Time of Day (UTC+8)**\n\n\n4 The bubbles shown on Figures 1 through 6 are representative of the number of events observed at that time and date.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen applying the time shift to the ChChes malware (newly\nused by APT10) compilation timestamps, we see a different\npattern as shown in Figure 5. While this does not align with\nChinese business hours, it is likely to be either a result of the\nthreat actor changing its risk profile by attempting to obscure\n\n**Figure 5: Compile time of ChChes in UTC**\n\n\nor confuse attribution or a developer’s side project that has\nended up being used on targeted operations. Based on other\ntechnical overlaps, ChChes is highly likely to be exclusively\nused by APT10.\n\n**Figure 6: Compile time of ChChes in UTC+8**\n\n\nDec 15, 2016\n\nDec 1, 2016\n\n\nDec 15, 2016\n\nDec 1, 2016\n\n\nNov 17, 2016\n\nNov 3, 2016\n\n\nNov 17, 2016\n\nNov 3, 2016\n\n\nOct 20, 2016\n\nOct 6, 2016\n\n\nOct 20, 2016\n\nOct 6, 2016\n\n\nSep 22, 2016\n\n\nSep 22, 2016\n\n|6|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|Col25|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n|16|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|16 16 16 16 16||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\n00:00 02:00 04:00 06:00 08:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00\n\n01:00 03:00 05:00 07:00 09:00 11:00 13:00 15:00 17:00 19:00 21:00 23:00\n\n\n00:00 02:00 04:00 06:00 08:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00\n01:00 03:00 05:00 07:00 09:00 11:00 13:00 15:00 17:00 19:00 21:00 23:00\n\n\n**Time of Day (UTC)**\n\nTo further this analysis, we have observed the threat actor\nconducting interactive activities primarily between the hours\nof midnight and 10:00 UTC, as shown in Figure 7. When\nconverting this to UTC+8 we again see a shift to Chinese\nbusiness hours, with operations occurring between 08:00 and\n19:00. It is a realistic probability that the weekend work\nobserved in Figure 7 may be necessary as part of operational\nrequirements.\n\n\n**Time of Day (UTC+8)**\n\n**Figure 7: Operational times of APT10 in UTC+8**\n\n\nThe sum of this analysis aligns with the evidence provided by\nthe United States Department of Justice indictment against\nseveral individuals associated with APT1,[5] another Chinabased threat actor, showing a working day starting at 08:00\nUTC+8 and finishing at 18:00 UTC+8 with a two hour lunch\nbreak from 12:00 UTC+8 until 14:00 UTC+8.\n\nNumber of events\n\n\n0 1-10 11-20 21-30 31-40 41-50 50+\n\n5 https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/5122014519132358461949.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Identifying a change in APT10’s targeting\n\nAPT10 has, in the past, primarily been known for its\ntargeting of government and US defence industrial base\norganisations, with the earliest known date of its activity\nbeing in December 2009. Our research and observations\nsuggest that this targeting continues to date.\n\nDuring the 2013 – 2014 period there was a general downturn\nin the threat actor’s activities, as was also seen with other\nrelated groups. It was widely assessed that this was due to\nthe public release of information surrounding APT1, which\nexposed its toolset and infrastructure.\n\nFrom our analysis and investigations, we have identified\nAPT10 as actively operating at least two specific campaigns,\none targeting MSPs and their clients, and one directly\ntargeting Japanese entities.\n\n#### MSP focused campaign\n\n###### APT10 has almost certainly been undertaking a global operation of unprecedented size and scale targeting a number of MSPs.\n\nAPT10 has vastly increased the scale and scope of its\ntargeting to include multiple sectors, which has likely been\nfacilitated by its compromise of MSPs. Such providers are\nresponsible for the remote management of customer IT and\nend-user systems, thus they generally have unfettered and\ndirect access to their clients’ networks. They may also store\nsignificant quantities of customer data on their own internal\ninfrastructure.\n\nMSPs therefore represent a high-payoff target for espionagefocused threat actors such as APT10. Given the level of client\nnetwork access MSPs have, once APT10 has gained access to\na MSP, it is likely to be relatively straightforward to exploit\nthis and move laterally onto the networks of potentially\nthousands of other victims. This, in turn, would provide\naccess to a larger amount of intellectual property and\nsensitive data. APT10 has been observed to exfiltrate stolen\nintellectual property via the MSPs, hence evading local\nnetwork defences.\n\n\nOther threat actors have previously been observed using\na similar method of a supply chain attack, for example, in\nthe compromise of Dutch certificate authority Diginotar in\n2011[6] and the compromise of US retailer Target in 2013.[7]\n\n\nThe command and control (C2) infrastructure chosen by\nAPT10 for Operation Cloud Hopper is predominantly\nreferenced using dynamic-DNS domains. The various\ndomains are highly-interconnected through shared IP\naddress hosting, even linking back historically to the threat\nactor’s much older operations.\n\nAt present, the indicators detailing APT10’s operations\nnumber into the thousands and cannot be easily visualised.\nThe graph in Figure 8 overleaf depicts a high-level view of the\ninfrastructure used by APT10 throughout 2016. As the\ncampaign has progressed into 2017, the number of dynamicDNS domains in use by the threat actor has significantly\nincreased.\n\nThe graph in Figure 9, also shown overleaf, extracts one node\nof the newer C2 from the infrastructure shown in Figure 8\nand maps this to the older infrastructure of APT10, as\ndisclosed by FireEye in their 2014 Siesta Campaign blog\npost[8]. In terms of timing, it is highly likely that a single party\nis responsible for all of these domains, based on our\nobservations of infrastructure overlap.\n\nThrough our investigations, we have identified multiple\nvictims who have been infiltrated by the threat actor. Several\nof these provide enterprise services or cloud hosting,\nsupporting our assessment that APT10 are almost certainly\ntargeting MSPs. We believe that the observed targeting of\nMSPs is part of a widescale supply-chain attack.\n\n\n6 https://security.googleblog.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html\n7 https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/\n8 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/03/a-detailed-examination-of-the-siesta-campaign.html\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: High-level view of infrastructure used by APT10 throughout 2016**\n\n**Figure 9: Infrastructure graph linking early Plugx domains to recent APT10 domains**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Countries targeted\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Japan focused campaign\n\nIn a separate series of operations, APT10 has been\nsystematically targeting Japanese organisations using\nbespoke malware referred to in the public domain as ‘ChChes’.\nWhile linked to APT10, via shared infrastructure, this\ncampaign exhibits some operational differences suggesting a\npotential sub-division within the threat actor. These\noperations have seen APT10 masquerading as legitimate\nJapanese public sector entities (such as the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the\nLiberal Democratic Party of Japan) to gain access to the victim\norganisations.\n\nTargeting of these entities by APT10 is consistent with\nprevious targeting by China-based threat actors of a wide\nrange of industries and sectors in Japan. This includes the\ntargeting of commercial companies, and government\n\n**Table 1: Japanese language filenames used by APT10**\n\n\nagencies, both of which has resulted in the exfiltration of large\namounts of data.[9]\n\nAPT10’s standard compromise methodology begins with a\nspear phishing email sent to the target, usually with an\nexecutable attachment designed to lure the victim to open it.\nAnalysis of the filenames associated with some of the latest\nAPT10 malware samples, particularly from late 2016,\nhighlights the use of Japanese language filenames which\nclearly indicates a campaign targeting Japanese-speaking\nindividuals. Further analysis of these files can be found in\nAnnex B.\n\nTable 1 shows some example file names being used by APT10\nin this campaign.\n\n\n**Japanese Filename** **Translation**\n\n1102毎日新聞(回答)._exe 1102 Mainich Newspaper (answer)._exe\n\n2016県立大学シンポジウムA4＿1025.exe 2016 Prefectural University Symposium A4_1025.exe\n\n事務連絡案内状(28.11.07).exe Business contact invitation (28.11.07).exe\n\n個人番号の提供について.exe Regarding provision of Individual number.exe\n\n日米拡大抑止協議e Japan-US expansion deterrence conference (e)\n\nロシア歴史協会の設立と「単一」国史教科書の作成.exe Foundation of Russian historical association and Composing 「a unity」\nstate history textbook.exe\n\nThe following is an example of a malicious decoy document referencing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries:\n\n**Figure 10: Decoy document based on press**\n**release from Japanese firm Mitsubishi**\n**Heavy Industries detailing the unveiling of**\n**their new ABLASER-DUV (Deep Ultraviolet**\n**Laser)**\n\n9 http://thediplomat.com/2016/04/japans-achilles-heel-cybersecurity/\n\n\n-----\n\nA notable tactic of this APT10 subset is to register C2 domains that closely resemble legitimate Japanese organisations.

Most victims primarily conducted their business in English and had a nexus with China’s strategic priorities.|\n\n\n_2015_\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APT10 alignment with previous China-based hacking\n\n\nEspionage attacks associated with China-based threat actors,\nas noted above, have traditionally targeted organisations that\nare of strategic value to Chinese businesses and where\nintellectual property obtained from such attacks could\nfacilitate domestic growth or advancement.\n\nThere has been significant open source reporting which has\ndocumented the alignment between apparent information\ncollection efforts of China-based threat actors and the\nstrategic emerging industries documented in China’s Five Year\nPlan (FYP).[10] The 13th FYP was released in March 2016 and\nthe sectors and organisations known to be targeted by APT10\nare broadly in line with the strategic aims documented in this\nplan. These aims outlined in the FYP will largely dictate the\ngrowth of businesses in China and are, therefore, likely to also\nform part of Chinese companies’ business strategies.\n\nThe latest FYP describes five principles which underpin\nChina’s goal of doubling its 2010 GDP by 2020. At the\nforefront of these principles is innovation, largely focused\naround technological innovation, with China expected to\ninvest 2.5% of GDP in research and development to attain\ntechnological advances, which are anticipated to contribute\n60% towards economic growth objectives.[11] The areas of\ninnovation expected to receive extensive investment include,\nnext-generation communications, new energy, new materials,\naerospace, biological medicine and smart manufacturing.\n\nIn addition to the FYP principle of innovation, China is also\npromoting ten key industries in which it wants to improve\ninnovation in manufacturing as part of the ‘Made in China\n2025’ initiative.[12]\n\n\n**Figure 13: Industries of interest outlined by ‘Made in China**\n**2025’ initiative**\n\n**Next**\n**generation**\n**information**\n**technology** **Numeric**\n\n**Agricultural** **control**\n**machinery** **tools and**\n\n**robotics**\n\n**Medicine**\n**and** **Aerospace**\n**medical** **equipment**\n**devices**\n\n**_‘Made in_**\n**_China 2025’_**\nindustries\n\n**Ocean**\n**engineering**\n\n**New**\n\n**equipment**\n\n**materials**\n\n**and high-tech**\n**ships**\n\n**Power** **Railway**\n**equipment** **equipment**\n\n**Energy**\n**saving and**\n**new energy**\n**vehicles**\n\nObserved APT10 targeting is in line with many of the historic\ncompromises we have outlined previously as originating from\nChina. This targeting spans industries that align with China’s\n13th FYP which would provide valuable information to\nadvance the domestic innovation goals held within China.\nGiven the broad spectrum of priority industries, the\ncompromise of MSPs represents an efficient method of\ninformation collection. This strategy also provides additional\nobfuscation for the actor as any data exfiltrated is taken back\nthrough the initial compromised company’s systems, creating\na much more difficult trail to follow.\n\n\n10 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n11 https://www.pwccn.com/en/migration/pdf/govt-work-review-mar2016.pdf\n12 http://www.pwccn.com/en/migration/pdf/prosperity-masses-2020.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n### Shining a light on APT10’s methodology\n\n\nThis section details changes made to APT10 tools, techniques\nand procedures (TTPs) post-2014, following its shift from\nPoison Ivy to PlugX. These TTPs have been identified as part\nof our incident response and threat intelligence investigations\nand have been used in both of the recent campaigns we have\nencountered. The examples provided in this section will be\ndrawn from both of those campaigns.\n\n#### Reconnaissance and targeting\n\nIt is often difficult to identify the early stages of a threat\nactor’s preparation for an attack as these initial activities tend\nto occur below the line of visibility. Our analysis of the most\nrecently used decoy documents by APT10 in its spear phishing\ncampaigns, which is the primary delivery method of its\npayloads, indicates the actor performs a significant level of\nresearch on its targets. In line with commonly used APT actor\nmethodologies, the threat actor aligns its decoy documents to\na topic of interest relevant to the recipient.\n\nIn the example shown in Figure 14 to the right, an official\ndocument hosted on the Japan Society for the Promotion of\nScience website was weaponised and deployed as part of a\nspear phishing campaign against a Japanese target in the\neducation sector.\n\n\n**Figure 14: Decoy document used by APT10 to target the**\n**Japanese education sector**\n\nAPT10 has been known to use research from their\nreconnaissance to obtain company email addresses, and then\ncraft a message containing either a malicious attachment or a\nlink to a malicious site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 15: Timeline of APT10 related activities**\n\n\n_2014_\nTargets East Asian\nmanufacturer and\nJapanese Public\nPolicy organisations\n\n\nAs part of the same campaign, we have also observed an email\nsent by APT10,[13] referencing a Scientific Research Grant\nProgram, and targeting various Japanese education institutes\nincluding Meiji University[14] and Chuo University.[15] The email\nincluded a zip file containing a link to download a payload\nfrom one of APT10’s servers, the ChChes Powersploit exploit,\ndetailed in Annex B.\n\n#### Initial compromise and lateral movement\n\nOnce on a target network, the actor rapidly deploys malware\nto establish a foothold, which may include one or more\nsystems that provide sustained access to a victim’s network.\nAs APT10 works to gain further privileges and access, it also\nconducts internal reconnaissance, mapping out the network\nusing common Windows tools, and in later stages of the\ncompromise using open source pentesting tools, detailed in\nAnnex B.\n\nThis reconnaissance is run in parallel with the actor ensuring\nthat it has access to legitimate credentials. We have observed\nthat in cases where APT10 has infiltrated a target via an MSP,\nit continues to use the MSPs credentials. In order to gain any\nfurther credentials, APT10 will usually deploy credential theft\ntools such as mimikatz or PwDump, sometimes using DLL load\norder hijacking, to use against a domain controller, explained\nfurther in Annex B. Regular communications checks are then\nexecuted in order to maintain this level of access. In most\ncases, these stolen MSP credentials have provided\nadministrator or domain administrator privileges.\n\nWe have observed the threat actor copying malware over to\nsystems in a compromised environment, which did not have\n\n13 http://csirt.ninja/?p=1103\n14 http://www.meiji.ac.jp/isc/information/2016/6t5h7p00000mjbbr.html\n15 http://www.chuo-u.ac.jp/research/rd/grant/news/2017/01/51783/\n\n\nany outbound internet access. In one of these instances, the\nthreat actor spent more than an hour attempting to establish\nan outbound connection using PlugX until it realised that the\nhost had no internet access, at which point the malware and\nall supporting files were deleted. APT10 achieves persistence\non its targets primarily by using scheduled tasks or Windows\nservices in order to ensure the malware remains active\nregardless of system reboots.\n\nAPT10 heavily leverages the shared nature of client-side MSP\ninfrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other\nvictims. Systems that share access and thus credentials, from\nboth a MSP and one of its clients serve as a way of hopping\nbetween the two.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT10 simultaneously targets both low profile and high value\nsystems to gain network persistence and a high level of access\nrespectively. For example, in addition to compromising high\nvalue domain controllers and security servers, the threat actor\nhas also been observed identifying and subsequently\ninstalling malware on low profile systems that provide\nnon-critical support functions to the business, and are thus\nless likely to draw the attention of system administrators.\n\nAs part of the long-term access to victim networks, we have\nobserved APT10 consistently install updates and new\nmalware on compromised systems. In the majority of\ninstances APT10 used either a reverse shell or RDP connection\nto install its malware; the actor also uses these methods to\npropagate across the network.\n\nCommunication checks are usually conducted using native\nWindows tools such as ping.exe, net.exe and tcping.exe. The\nactor will frequently ‘net use’ to several machines within\nseveral seconds, connecting for as little as five seconds, before\ndisconnecting. Further details are provided in Annex B.\n\n#### Network hopping and exfiltration\n\nOnce APT10 have a foothold in victim networks, using either\nlegitimate MSP or local domain credentials, or their sustained\nmalware such as PlugX, RedLeaves or Quasar RAT, they will\nbegin to identify systems of interest.\n\nThe operator will either access these systems over RDP, or\nbrowse folders using Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\nfunctionality, to identify data of interest. This data is then\nstaged for exfiltration in multi-part archives, often placed in\nthe Recycle Bin, using either RAR or TAR. The compression\ntools are often launched via a remote command execution\nscript which is regularly named ‘t.vbs’ and is a customised\nversion of an open source WMI command executor which\npipes the command output back to the operator.\n\nWe have observed these archives being moved outside of the\nvictim networks, either back into to the MSP environments or\nto external IP addresses in two methods, which are also\nperformed via the command line using t.vbs:\n\n1. Mounting the target external network share with ‘net use’\n\nand subsequently using the legitimate Robocopy tool to\ntransfer the data; and,\n\n2. Using the legitimate Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP),\n\nsometimes named rundll32.exe, to transfer the data\ndirectly to the third party system.\n\n\nUsing these techniques, APT10 ‘pushes’ data from victim\nnetworks to other networks they have access to, such as other\nMSP or victim networks, then, using similar methods, ‘pulls’\nthe data from those networks to locations from which they\ncan directly obtain it, such as the threat actor’s C2 servers.\n\nAPT10’s ability to bridge networks can therefore be\nsummarized as:\n\n- Use of legitimate MSP credentials to management systems\n\nwhich bridge the MSP and multiple MSP customer\nnetworks;\n\n- Use of RDP to interactively access systems in both the MSP\n\nmanagement network and MSP customer networks;\n\n- Use of t.vbs to execute command line tools; and,\n\n- Use of PSCP and Robocopy to transfer data.\n\n#### APT10 malware\n\nWe classify APT10’s malware into two distinct areas: tactical\nand sustained. The tactical malware, historically EvilGrab,\nand now ChChes (and likely also RedLeaves), is designed to be\nlightweight and disposable, often being delivered through\nspear phishing. Once executed, tactical malware contains the\ncapability to profile the network and manoeuvre through it to\nidentify a key system of interest. The sustained malware,\nhistorically Poison Ivy, PlugX and now Quasar provides a more\ncomprehensive feature set. Intended to be deployed on key\nsystems, the sustained malware facilitates long-term remote\naccess and allows for operators to more easily carry out\nadministration tasks.\n\nSince late 2016, we have seen the threat actor develop several\nbespoke malware families, such as ChChes and RedLeaves.\nAdditionally, it has taken the open source malware, Quasar,\nand extended its capabilities, ensuring the incrementation of\nthe internal version number as it does so.\n\nWe have also observed APT10 use DLL search order hijacking\nand sideloading, to execute some modified versions of\nopen-source tools. For example, PwC UK has observed APT10\ncompiling DLLs out of tools, such as MimiKatz and PwDump6,\nand using legitimate, signed software, such as Windows\nDefender to load the malicious payloads.\n\nIn Annex B we provide detailed analysis of several of the\nthreat actor’s tools as well as the common Windows tools we\nhave observed being used.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Timeline_\n\n**Figure 17: Timeline of APT10 malware use**\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012\n\n**_Poison Ivy_**\n\n**_PlugX_**\n\n**_EvilGrab_**\n\n**_ChChes_**\n\n**_Quasar_**\n\n**_RedLeaves_**\n\n_Retooling Efforts_\nAlongside APT10’s TTPs, we have observed a ‘retooling’ cycle.\nGiven the pace of technological change and the wide range of\nfreely available online tools and scripts, it is not unusual for\nan actor to re-evaluate its capabilities and to benchmark\nmultiple offerings against each other. We have observed a\ndecline in the deployment of some of APT10’s traditional core\ntool set, and witnessed an increase in the development and\ndeployment of additional new tools which combine in-house\ndevelopment and open source projects. We assess that this is\nhighly likely due to the public release of APT10 malware by\ncyber security vendors.\n\nThroughout our investigations, we have observed multiple\ndeployments of the PlugX malware from 2014 to at least 2016.\nThis, along with the downturn in the use of Poison Ivy,\nsupports the notion that a major retooling operation took\nplace post 2014. Additional analysis of the infrastructure\nassociated with each distinct version of PlugX also shows an\nincrease in maturity over time. Earlier PlugX versions were\nconfigured with legacy domains and IP addresses, which were\noriginally isolated and more obvious, whereas more recent\nversions have demonstrated a standardised convention for\ndomain names and IP selection.\n\n16 https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT\n\n\nDuring our analysis of victim networks, we were able to\nobserve APT10 once again initiate a retooling cycle in late\n2016. We observed the deployment and testing of multiple\nversions of Quasar malware,[16] and the introduction of the\nbespoke malware families ChChes and RedLeaves.\n\nWe assess it is highly likely that due to the frequent public\nrelease of information linking PlugX with China-based threat\nactors, continual long-term use had become unsustainable,\nintroducing an additional operational overhead that is easily\nattributable to China-based threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n###### APT10 is a constantly evolving, highly persistent China-based threat actor that has an ambitious and unprecedented collection programme against a broad spectrum of sectors, enabled by its strategic targeting.\n\n\nSince exposure of its operations in 2013, APT10 has made a\nnumber of significant changes intended to thwart detection of\nits campaigns. PwC UK and BAE Systems, working closely\nwith industry and government, have uncovered a new,\nunparallelled campaign which we refer to as Operation Cloud\nHopper. This operation has targeted managed IT service\nproviders, the compromise of which provides APT10 with\npotential access to thousands of further victims. An additional\ncampaign has also been observed targeting Japanese entities.\n\nAPT10’s malware toolbox shows a clear evolution from\nmalware commonly associated with China-based threat actors\ntowards bespoke in-house malware that has been used in\nmore recent campaigns; this is indicative of APT10’s\nincreasing sophistication, which is highly likely to continue.\nThe threat actor’s known working hours align to Chinese\nStandard Time (CST) and its targeting corresponds to that of\nother known China-based threat actors, which supports our\nassessment that these campaigns are conducted by APT10.\n\n**_This campaign serves to highlight the importance of_**\n**_organisations having a comprehensive view of their threat_**\n**_profile, including that of their supply chain’s. More broadly,_**\n**_it should also encourage organisations to fully assess the_**\n**_risk posed by their third party relationships, and prompt_**\n**_them to take appropriate steps to assure and manage these._**\n\nA detailed technical annex supplements this main report,\nwhich provides further information about the tools and\ntechniques used by APT10 and contains Indicators of\nCompromise relating to all of this threat actor’s known\ncampaigns. These have already been provided to the National\nCyber Security Centre for dissemination through their usual\nchannels.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Appendices\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A\n\n#### Collaboration between PwC UK and BAE Systems\n\nPwC and BAE Systems’ respective Threat Intelligence teams share a mutual interest in new cyber threats. PwC and BAE\nSystems partnered through their membership of the Cyber Incident Response (CIR) scheme to share intelligence and develop\nthe most comprehensive picture possible of this threat actor’s activities.
