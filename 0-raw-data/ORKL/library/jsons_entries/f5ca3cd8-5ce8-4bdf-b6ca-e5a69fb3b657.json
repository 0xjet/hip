We devise a method for querying FinFisher’s “anonymizing\n\nproxies” to unmask the true location of the spyware’s master servers. Since the master servers are installed on the premises\nof FinFisher customers, tracing the servers allows us to identify which governments are likely using FinFisher. In some cases,\n\nwe can trace the servers to specific entities inside a government by correlating our scan results with publicly available\nsources. Our results indicate 32 countries where at least one government entity is likely using the spyware suite, and we are\n\nfurther able to identify 10 entities by name. Despite the 2014 FinFisher breach, and subsequent disclosure of sensitive\ncustomer data, our scanning has detected more servers in more countries than ever before.\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nFinFisher is a sophisticated computer spyware suite, written by Munich­based FinFisher GmbH, and sold exclusively to\n\ngovernments for intelligence and law enforcement purposes. Although marketed as a tool for fighting crime,[1] the spyware has been\n\ninvolved in a number of high­profile surveillance abuses. Between 2010 and 2012, Bahrain’s government used FinFisher to monitor\n\nsome of the country’s top law firms, journalists, activists, and opposition political leaders.[2] Ethiopian dissidents in exile in the United\n\nKingdom[3] and the United States[4] have also been infected with FinFisher spyware.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Citizen Lab researchers and collaborators,[5] published several reports analyzing FinFisher spyware, and\n\nconducted scanning that identified FinFisher command and control (C&C) servers in a number of countries. In our previous\n\nresearch, we were not yet able to differentiate between FinFisher anonymizing proxies and master servers, a distinction that we\n\nmake in this work.\n\nWhen a government entity purchases FinFisher spyware, they receive a FinSpy Master—a C&C server that is installed on the\n\nentity’s premises.[6] The entity may then set up anonymizing proxies (also referred to as “proxies” or “FinSpy Relays” in the\n\nFinFisher documentation), to obscure the location of their master. Infected computers communicate with the anonymizing proxy,\n\nwhich is “usually”[7] set up on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider in a third country. The proxy then forwards communications\n\nbetween a victim’s computer and the Master server.\n\nWe first describe how we scanned the Internet for FinFisher servers and distinguished masters from proxies (Part 1: Fishing for\n\n**FinFisher). We then outline our findings regarding 32 governments and 10 specific government entities that we believe are using**\n\nFinFisher (Part 2: Country Findings). Finally, we highlight several cases that illuminate connections between different threat\n\nactors (Part 3: A Deeper Analysis of Several Cases), before concluding (Conclusion).\n\n\n-----\n\n_In this section, we describe our scans for FinFisher servers, and how we unmasked the true location of the master servers to_\n\n_identify governments using FinFisher._\n\nEach FinFisher sample includes the address of one or more C&C servers that the spyware reports back to. These C&C servers are\n\ntypically FinSpy Relays, which forward connections back and forth between a device infected with FinFisher, and a FinSpy Master.\n\nThe purpose of the FinSpy Relay is explicitly to make it “practically impossible” (their emphasis) for a researcher to discover “the\n\n_location and country of the Headquarter [sic]”.[8]_\n\n**_Figure 1: How targets infected with FinFisher communicate with the FinSpy Master via one or more FinSpy Relays.[9]_**\n\nWe employed zmap[10] to scan the entire IPv4 Internet (/0) several times since the end of December 2014 and throughout 2015,\n\nusing a new FinFisher server fingerprint that we devised by analyzing FinFisher samples. Our scans yielded 135 servers matching\n\nour fingerprint, which we believe are a mix of FinSpy Masters and FinSpy Relays.\n\nWhen one queries a FinFisher server, or types the server’s address into a web browser, the server typically returns a decoy page. A\n\ndecoy page is a page designed to disguise the fact that the server is a spyware server. We found some variation in the decoy\n\npages used by FinFisher servers that we detected, though the bulk used either www.google.com or www.yahoo.com. Peculiarly,\n\nFinSpy Relays appear to return decoy pages fetched by their FinSpy Master, rather than directly fetching the decoy pages\n\nthemselves. Thus, in many cases, the pages returned by the FinSpy Relays contain location data apparently about the\n\n**FinSpy Master (e.g., certain Google and Yahoo pages embed the requester’s IP address or localized weather), which can**\n\n**reveal the location of FinSpy Masters.**\n\n### Okay Google, What is my IP?\n\nWe noticed that when we issued a query like “What is my IP address?” to a Google­decoy FinFisher server, the server would\n\nrespond with a different IP address. In the case below, a FinFisher server 206.190.159.xxx (located in the United States) reported\n\nthat its IP address was the Indonesian IP 112.78.143.xxx, which matches a FinFisher server first detected in August 2012 by\n\nClaudio Guarnieri.[11] We hypothesize that 206.190.159.xxx is a FinFisher proxy, designed to obscure the location of the FinFisher\n\n_master, which is at 112.78.143.xxx._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: A FinFisher server in the US seems to be a proxy for a master in Indonesia._**\n\nSpecifically, we sent queries of the form:\n\n\nGET /search?q=my+ip+address&nord=1 HTTP/1.1\nHost: [ip of server]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\n\n\n**_Figure 3: Queries we sent to Google­decoy FinFisher servers to reveal the IP address of the master.[12]_**\n\nThe fact that FinFisher proxies can apparently reveal the IP of the master is quite peculiar. We illustrate below how we believe a\n\nquery like “What is my IP address?” is routed through FinSpy Relays to the FinSpy Master:\n\n**_Figure 4: How we believe a “What is my IP address?” query is routed through FinSpy Relays to a FinSpy Master._**\n\nIt appears that the “What is my IP Address?” query is delivered from our Measurement Machine by the FinSpy Relay to the\n\n**FinSpy Master, and then submitted to Google by the FinSpy Master. Therefore, Google returns the IP address of the FinSpy**\n\n**Master, which is then sent back to the Measurement Machine via the FinSpy Relay.**\n\n### How’s the Weather in Caracas?\n\nA significant number of FinFisher servers we detected used www.yahoo.com as their decoy page. While we were unable to devise\n\na method to find the exact IP address of Yahoo­decoy FinFisher endpoints, we were still able to retrieve location information from\n\nYahoo, by examining the userLocation object in the decoy page’s source code. Yahoo utilizes a user’s location to customize\n\nseveral elements of Yahoo’s homepage, including weather and news.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Weather conditions in Caracas returned by a FinFisher server in Lithuania._**\n\nThe userLocation object returned by 185.8.106.xxx (located in Lithuania) is shown below:\n\n\n\"userLocation\":\n{\"woeid\":395269,\n\"zip\":\"Caracas\",\n\"city\":\"Caracas\",\n\"state\":\"Distrito Federal\",\n\"country\":\"Venezuela\",\n\"countryCode\":\"VE\",\n...}\n\n\n**_Figure 6: A FinFisher server in Lithuania seems to be a proxy for a master in Venezuela._**\n\nThe userLocation object allows us to obtain city and country information for FinFisher endpoints, though we cannot determine their\n\nprecise IP address. We issued a query similar to the following to each Yahoo­decoy FinFisher server to obtain a page with the\n\nuserLocation object:\n\n\nGET https://www.yahoo.com/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.yahoo.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\n\n\n**_Figure 7:_** **_Queries we sent to Yahoo­decoy FinFisher servers to reveal the location of the master.[13]_**\n\nSince Yahoo, like Google, implements SSL redirection by default, we had to devise a method to talk to Yahoo in plain HTTP. While\n\nGoogle provides the “nord=1” URL parameter to avoid SSL redirection, Yahoo apparently does not have an analogous publicized\n\nsolution. However, we found that by sending plain HTTP GET requests to the resource “https://www.yahoo.com/” we could\n\ncommunicate with www.yahoo.com in plain HTTP without triggering SSL redirection.\n\n### Other Decoys\n\nWhile the majority of FinFisher servers we detected used either Google or Yahoo as a decoy page, we identified a number of other\n\nservers whose operators had apparently customized the decoy page to a different URL.\n\nOne server used the Italian news source libero.it as a decoy. We noted that libero.it sets the “Libero” cookie, which contains the IP\n\naddress of the computer that visited the libero.it website. When accessing 185.8.106.xxx, the Libero­decoy FinFisher server, the\n\ncookie was set to include the Italian IP 93.146.250.xxx.[14] Servers that we traced to Macedonia used Macedonian newsmagazine\n\n**time.mk as a decoy. Servers we traced to Taiwan used Taiwanese web portal pchome.com.tw as a decoy. We were unable to**\n\ntrace other servers which used file download site filehippo.com as a decoy. A handful of other untraceable servers returned\n\ncustom HTML code as a decoy (e.g., a webpage with a META redirect to www.google.com).\n\n### General Comments\n\nThis design peculiarity is only the latest instance of fingerprintable anomalies in spyware decoy pages. FinFisher competitor\n\nHacking Team formerly used decoy pages on its C&C server for Remote Control System (RCS), but apparently removed them[15]\n\nafter our research revealed that anomalies in the decoy pages could be used to fingerprint RCS servers.[16] We have also previously\n\nused decoy pages to fingerprint FinFisher servers.[17] We believe that FinFisher or its clients may also be realizing that decoy pages\n\nare problematic, as we have observed fewer FinFisher servers returning decoy pages over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n_In this section, we provide a list of likely FinFisher government users identified by our scans, and also map out which FinSpy relays_\n\n_serve which FinSpy Masters._\n\nBelow, we identify 33 likely government users of FinFisher in 32 countries, based on the presence of a FinFisher master at an IP\n\naddress in a country[18] or belonging to a specific government department.\n\n**_Figure 8: Suspected FinFisher government users that were active at some point in 2015._**\n\nIn presenting our scan results, we do not wish to disrupt or interfere with legitimately sanctioned investigations or other\n\nactivities. Instead, we hope to ensure that citizens have the opportunity to hold their governments transparent and accountable. To\n\nthis end, we identify government users, but redact certain details we have discovered about their infrastructure whose disclosure\n\nmight interfere with legitimately sanctioned activities. Redacted details include the last octet of live IP addresses, and part of live\n\ndomain names.

We have also previously identified potential legal concerns regarding locating relays in other countries.[21]\n\n### Attribution to Specific Entities\n\nWe attributed some FinFisher Master servers to specific government entities by correlating our scan results with publicly available\n\ndata, including emails from FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team. This section briefly describes how we identified these entities,\n\nand summarizes what is publicly known about their functions. While we do not provide a vignette for each country where we have\n\nidentified FinFisher, we note that a number of countries have dubious or problematic histories of oversight of the security services.\n\n### Bangladesh\n\n**Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI)**\n\n\nOur investigation uncovered a FinFisher server at an IP address in the same /30 as the mail server for Bangladesh’s DGFI,\n\n**[redacted].dgfi.gov.bd. Additionally, leaked Hacking Team emails claim that Bangladesh’s DGFI is a FinFisher customer.[22]**\n\n\nEstablished in 1976, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) is Bangladesh’s military intelligence agency. The director\n\nof the agency holds the rank of Lieutenant General or Major General and directly reports to the Prime Minister.[23] In a report\n\npublished in 2008, Human Rights Watch associated the DGFI with long­standing human rights violations (e.g., torture and\n\nextrajudicial killings) and the stifling of political opposition in the country.[24]\n\nThe US State Department has reported that the DGFI has previously conducted surveillance on citizens for their criticism of the\n\ngovernment.[25] Leaked emails show that DGFI officials were engaged in discussions with FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team in\n\nJune 2014.[26]\n\n### Belgium\n\n**Federal Police Service**\n\n\nOur investigation found a FinFisher server in a /28 assigned to Belgacom denoted “SKY 5904592 / SOCC 2131136 ” This\n\n\n-----\n\nBelgium’s Federal Police Service was established in January 2001. The agency is headed by a General Commissioner who\n\ncoordinates the work of five general directorates, including administrative police, judicial police, operational support, logistics, and\n\nhuman resources, as well as several departments that report directly to him/her.[27] Leaked Hacking Team emails have revealed the\n\ncompany’s participation in a tender for “tactical interception of communications via computer systems” by the Belgian Federal\n\nPolice.[28]\n\n### Serbia\n\n**Security Information Agency (BIA)**\n\n\nOur investigation found a FinFisher server in the same /26 as bia.gov.rs, the website of Serbia’s Security Information Agency\n\n(BIA). The server was also in the same /28 as a computer that identified itself to Shodan as “DPRODAN­PC”.[29] According to\nthe leaked Hacking Team emails, a person with the email dprodan@open.telekom.rs contacted Hacking Team in reference to\n\na February 8, 2012 demo in Belgrade.[30] From February 7­9, 2012, Hacking Team was in Belgrade to give a demo to a\n\npotential client, Vladimir Djokic, who worked for the BIA according to his email address vladimirdj@bia.gov.rs.[31] Thus, we\n\nbelieve “dprodan” is also a BIA employee, and the FinFisher server we found belongs to the BIA.\n\n\nSerbia’s Security Information Agency (BIA) was created in 2002 by the Law on the Security Information Agency. BIA is a civil\n\nnational security service and a part of the security­intelligence system of the Republic of Serbia.[32]\n\nWhile the BIA is generally regarded as operating with appropriate oversight and as being free from major abuses, some elements of\n\nits electronic surveillance practices have been challenged. Prior to 2014, the Law on the Security Information Agency was\n\nconsidered to be not in compliance with the constitution. In 2012, a constitutional court struck down several provisions of the Law on\n\nthe Security Information Agency, ruling that Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the Law, which govern the wiretapping of private\n\ncommunications, were unconstitutional.[33] The court ruled that these Articles were “not formulated clearly and precisely enough” and\n\nthat citizens are “thus prevented from ascertaining which legal rule will be applied in the given circumstances and are thus deprived\n\nof the possibility to protect themselves from inadmissible restrictions of their right or arbitrary interference in their right to respect of\n\ntheir private life and correspondence”.[34] Further, measures related to the ability of the BIA’s Director to authorize wiretapping in\n\nsome circumstances without a court order were also challenged.[35] The court delayed its decision in order to give legislators the\n\nopportunity to revise the offending Articles in the Law.[36] The amendments to the Law were adopted in June 2014.[37] While\n\nacknowledged as a positive step, these amendments have been criticized as remaining “insufficient to fully democratize\n\nsurveillance that is carried out by the BIA”.[38]\n\nLeaked emails indicate that members of the Security Information Agency and the Ministry of Defense engaged in purchase\n\nnegotiations with FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team.[39]\n\n### Egypt\n\n**Technology Research Department**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server at IP address 62.114.252.xxx. We also found an email in the leaked Hacking Team emails that,\n\naccording to the headers, was sent from the same IP address.[40] The email was sent by Hacking Team employee Davide\n\nRomualdi on June 25, 2015, when he was scheduled to be performing delivery[41] in Egypt for Hacking Team customer\n\nTREVOR, identified as the TRD[42] (Technology Research Department).[43] Thus, we believe the email was sent from the\npremises of the TRD, and the IP address 62.114.252.xxx belongs to the TRD.\n\n\nEgypt’s troubling human rights situation has continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al­Sisi. In recent years, cases of\n\nmass arrests, significant violence against protesters and due process violations have increased.[44] Numerous Egyptian security\n\nagencies are permitted to conduct electronic surveillance, frequently with limited court oversight. In somes, personal data\n\nimproperly collected from civil society actors has led to their arrest and imprisonment.[45] While there is limited open source\n\ninformation available about the activities of the Technology Research Department, we closely examine a malware campaign linked\n\ni f i f hi\n\n\n-----\n\n**National Encryption Body (Lembaga Sandi Negara)**\n\n\nTwo of the FinFisher servers we found in Indonesia were in the same /28. We found an IP address in this same /28 included\n\nin the headers of an email sent by a Hacking Team employee[46] while he was in Indonesia[47] performing a demo for the\n\nNational Encryption Body. The email was sent at 12:39 PM Jakarta time on February 6, 2013, and a meeting at the agency\n\nwas set for 10:00 AM on the same day.[48] Thus, it seems probable that the email was sent from the premises of the National\nEncryption Body, and that the two FinFisher servers belong to the same organization.\n\n\nThe National Encryption Body is an agency headed by a director, who has the same stature as a minister and reports directly to the\n\nPresident. In a recent interview, the Body’s current director, Major General Djoko Setyadi, describes the agency’s responsibilities as,\n\namong others, securing state secrets and decrypting/decoding communication from would­be terrorists.[49]\n\nThe threat of terrorism is a concern for Indonesia. Several bombing incidents have occurred in the country, including two Western\n\nhotels in the capital city of Jakarta in 2009. As the world’s largest Muslim­majority country, the emergence of the Islamic State of\n\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) has also resulted in concerns that their militant ideology will gain ground. It is believed that as\n\nmany as 200 Indonesian citizens have headed to Syria to fight with ISIS.[50] Challenges from restive regions like Papua and Central\n\nSulawesi are also ongoing. There are fears that the fight against these threats may be used as justification to perpetrate human\n\nrights abuses, such as to target others for their religious or political beliefs and to kill suspected militants unlawfully.\n\nIn 2013 Citizen Lab report, we identified at least twelve laws, two government regulations, and two ministerial regulations that\n\ngovern wiretapping and interception in Indonesia. Although wiretapping and interception are helpful, and sometimes even\n\nnecessary to expose crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption, the lack of comprehensive legislation regulating their\n\nuse in Indonesia means that there is an increased risk for misuse and privacy violations.[51]\n\n### Kenya\n\n**National Intelligence Service**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Kenyan user named “National Security Intelligence.”\nKenya’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) was formerly known as the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS).\n\n\nKenya’s NSIS replaced the former Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI), commonly known as the “Special Branch”.[52] The NIS is\n\nknown as one of Kenya’s security institutions with the biggest budgetary allocation—along with the Kenya National Defence Forces\n\nand the National Police Service—and considered to be among the country’s critical security organs in the new constitution.[53] In\n\n2014, Human Rights Watch named the NIS, as well as the Anti­Terrorism Police Unit and other Kenyan intelligence agencies, as\n\nbeing implicated in abuses including torture, disappearances, and extrajudicial killings.[54]\n\nThe powers of the NIS were expanded significantly in December 2014 when the Parliament of Kenya rushed to pass the\n\ncontroversial Security Laws (Amendment) Bill.[55] The amendments came following a series of deadly terrorist attacks by the militant\n\ngroup al­Shabab, including the 2013 killing of 67 people at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.[56] This bill expanded the powers\n\nof the NIS to monitor communications without a warrant, as well as expanding their powers to search and seize private property.[57]\n\nArticle 62 of the amended bill authorized NIS agents to “do anything necessary to preserve national security” and to detain\n\nindividuals on simply the suspicion of engaging in acts which pose a threat to national security.[58] Section 66 of the bill amended the\n\nNational Intelligence Services Act, permitting the Director General of the NIS to monitor communications or “obtain any information,\n\nmaterial, record, document or thing” in order to protect national security, without court oversight, leading rights organization Article\n\n19 to argue that the amendment “effectively [gives] carte blanche to the Director­General to order mass surveillance of online\n\ncommunications”.[59] While a court ruling in February 2015 struck down some provisions of the amendment, the provisions\n\nenhancing the powers of the NIS remained.[60]\n\n### Lebanon\n\n**General Directorate of General Security**\n\n\n-----\n\nLebanon’s General Directorate of General Security was established in 1921 under Decree No. 1061.[61] The functions of the General\n\nSecurity include collecting and gathering intelligence, monitoring the media, and issuing passports and travel documents to\n\nLebanese citizens.[62] The organization is categorized as a general directorate under the supervision of the Ministry of Internal\n\nAffairs.[63]\n\nAlthough Lebanon has legislation (Law No. 140) which establishes safeguards and oversight protecting electronic communications\n\nfrom unlawful surveillance, there is a systemic practice of this law being ignored.[64] Privacy International has criticized the\n\nsurveillance practices of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies, suggesting that the agencies, including the General Directorate of\n\nGeneral Security, operate without sufficient independent oversight, and that a lack of trust between different agencies leads the\n\ngroups to operate their own operations out of view of the Ministry of the Interior.[65] Controversies surrounding government\n\nsurveillance practices have become particularly salient in the wake of several recent high­profile assassinations, including the 2005\n\nkilling of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Organizations investigating the assassinations have had “unregulated access to the data of\n\nprivate citizens”, including mobile phone records, which raises privacy concerns.[66]\n\n**Internal Security Forces**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server at a Lebanese IP address that was formerly pointed to by what was apparently a mail server with\n\ndomain “[redacted].intelligence.isf.gov.lb” in 2012. We assume that the IP still belongs to the Internal Security Forces (ISF).\n\n\nThe Internal Security Forces (ISF) are the national police and security force of Lebanon. The ISF’s creation was mandated by\n\nDecree 138 in 1959.[67] Throughout its history, the ISF has had a troubled record of human rights abuses, in spite of recent efforts to\n\npromote proper conduct within the organization. In consultation with the UN Human Rights Office, the ISF adopted a January 2012\n\ncode of conduct designed to ensure the forces’ operations guaranteed respect for human rights and public freedoms, including\n\n“refraining from resorting to torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment”.[68] However, a number of incidents in recent years\n\nhave called into questions the effectiveness of this code of conduct.\n\nAn extensive Human Rights Watch report in 2013 detailed dozens of instances of vulnerable individuals subject to physical abuse,\n\ntorture and sexual assault at the hands of ISF officials.[69] In June 2015, five ISF officers were arrested after videos released on\n\nsocial media showed the officers beating prisoners.[70] The ISF and other state agencies have summoned and questioned bloggers,\n\njournalists, and activists over social media and blog posts critical of politicians.[71]\n\nThe organization also has a history of overreach in the collection of Lebanese citizens’ private user data. In 2012, it was reported\n\nthat the ISF had requested that the Ministry of Telecommunications turn over the content of all SMS text messages sent over a two\n\nmonth span for all users in Lebanon, followed later by a request for Lebanese users’ login credentials for BlackBerry Messenger\n\nand Facebook.[72] The request was made following the assassination of the ISF’s Information Branch head Wissam al­Hassan, and\n\nwas rejected by the Ministry.[73]\n\n### Morocco\n\n**Conseil Superieur De La Defense Nationale (CSDN) / Supreme Council of National Defense**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Moroccan user named “Conseil Superieur De La\n\nDefense Nationale.” We assume that this is a reference to the eponymous agency.\n\n\nThere is limited open source information available about the activities of the CSDN. Leaked Hacking Team emails indicate that the\n\nCSDN — among other Moroccan Government agencies — was a customer of FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team.\n\nIn 2012, spyware from Hacking Team was used against Mamfakinch, an award­winning group of Moroccan citizen journalists.[74]\n\nPrivacy International released a report detailing the impact of surveillance on the group, as well as other political activists and\n\njournalists.[75]\n\n### Mongolia\n\n\n-----\n\n“td.sssd.mn.” We believe that “SSSD” is a reference to the Mongolian agency of the same name. We also found what\nappears to be a test or demonstration FinFisher sample, whose bait content includes emails apparently between Gamma\n\nGroup and Mongolia’s SSSD, discussing a visit by Gamma personnel to Mongolia.\n\n\nThere is limited open source information available about the SSSD; however, leaked emails from the spyware firm Hacking Team\n\nindicate that in 2012 the company was in contact with members of the SSSD.[76] Additional leaked emails from 2013 indicate that\n\nHacking Team scheduled a product demonstration with the SSSD in April 2013.[77]\n\n# Part 3: A Deeper Analysis of Several Cases\n\n_The following section provides additional details for several countries_\n\n### Egypt: Use of FinFisher illuminates connections between different groups\n\nWe noted an interesting connection between Egypt’s Technology Research Department (TRD) and two other malware groups in the\n\nregion: MOLERATS, and an as­yet uncharacterized group. We have previously observed both groups targeting UAE­based\n\nactivists.\n\n**MOLERATS Attacks with FinFisher**\n\nWe found an Egypt FinFisher sample, Egyptian_army.rar, hosted on google.wwwhost.biz.\n\n\n**SHA256:  1610fc805f980f5c70cec8e138ba800b01ebc86919f42b375cfb161ce6365a48**\n**Filename: Egyptian_army.rar**\n\n\nExtracting the .rar file yields an .exe file.\n\n\n**SHA256:  94abf6df38f26530da2864d80e1a0b7cdfce63fd27b142993b89c52b3cee0389**\n**Filename: ﺔﻠﻬﻤﻟا ءﺎﻀﻘﻧا ﺪﻌﺑ ﺶﻋاد ﺪﻳ ﻰﻠﻋ ﺔﺒﺳﺎﺴﻜﻟا ﺢﺑذ رﻮﺻ.exe**\n\n\nThe name of the .exe file promises pictures of Jordanian Air Force pilot burned alive by ISIS, a popular news story at the time.\n\nWe suspect that the domain name google.wwwhost.biz is linked to MOLERATS, a threat actor active in the Middle East region\n\nthat appears to engage in politically motivated targeting. We describe the link below:\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz had IP address 200.74.241.111 at the same time as info.dynamic­dns.net, which also had IP**\n\naddress 192.161.48.59, shared with update.ciscofreak.com, which also had IP address 162.220.246.117. This IP address\n\nis linked to several known MOLERATS domains, like natco{1,2,3,4,5}.no­ip.net,[78] and uae.kim.[79]\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz also hosted two DarkComet samples, which communicated with r.ddns.me, which shared IP address**\n\n**198.105.125.158 with a.ddns.me, which shared IP address 23.229.3.37 with MOLERATS domain test.cable­**\n\n**modem.org.[80]**\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz also hosted a GMail phishing page, 64c1ef8e0923bf44aaa96caeb28a6c11, also hosted by**\n\n**googlecombq6xx.ddns.net, which shared IP address 131.72.136.28 with tvnew.otzo.com, which shared IP address**\n\n**172.227.95.162 with several known MOLERATS domains, like natco{1,2,3,4}.no­ip.net,[81] and uae.kim.[82]**\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz served a Hotmail phishing page, 57ab5f60198d311226cdc246598729ea, also served by**\n\n**google.com.r3irv2ykn0qnd7vr7sqv7kg2qho3ab5tngl5avxi5iimz1jxw9pa9.uae.kim; uae.kim is a known MOLERATS**\n\ndomain.[83]\n\nA significant portion of MOLERATS bait content we have observed indicates targeting of Israel and “political Islam” groups like\n\nHamas. This MOLERATS activity could be accounted for by any number of intelligence agencies active in the region, or a\n\nPalestinian faction, but it is also possible that MOLERATS is a multi­faceted group with several interests and/or clients.\n\nThat MOLERATS apparently used spyware linked to the TRD suggests a possible connection between the TRD and MOLERATS.\n\n**The Curious Case of the Shared Exploit**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256:  22deea26981bc6183ac3945da8274111e7fd7a35fbb6da601348cc6d66240114**\n**Filename: ﺔﻳﺎﻐﻠﻟ يﺮﺳ ﺮﻳﺮﻘﺗ.doc**\n\n\nThe document, whose name translates to “A Highly Classifed Report” downloads a FinFisher sample from\n\n**http://workingulf.net/DFServ.exe.**\n\n\n**SHA256:  e2ecf89a49c125e0b4292645a41b5e97c0f7bf15d418faeac0d592205f083119**\n**Filename: DFServ.exe**\n\n\nThe sample communicates with 50.31.252.xxx and 95.170.82.xxx, which are proxies for 62.114.252.xxx, the FinFisher Master we\n\nassociated with Egypt’s TRD. The domain workingulf.net appears to be connected to the TRD, because it is linked to a cluster of\n\nother domains, several of which were used to distribute TRD FinFisher samples.\n\nWe developed a fingerprint for the exploit, based on the presence of a 1.1MB binary embedded in the Word Document. A week\n\nlater, we identified another instance of this same exploit (the binary was the same).\n\n\n**SHA256:  d759dcbebee18a65fda434ba1da5d348c16d9d3775fe1652a1dacf983ffc93b8**\n**Filename: تاﺪﺠﺘﺴﻤﻟا.doc**\n\n\nThis instance downloaded spyware from http://wp.piedslibres.com/wp/wp­includes/js/Next.scr, which appeared to be a hacked\n\nWordPress site.\n\n\n**SHA256:  08b32da8995ae094bfb703d7d975c3816cf04c075c32281e51158164d76cd655**\n**Filename: Next.scr**\n\n\nNext.scr is a bespoke malware that exfiltrates system information and files via email. The malware logs into an email account on\n\nthe C&C server via SMTP, and sends mail to another account on the same server. We have seen C&Cs including: pal4u.net,\n\n**pal2me.net, and shop8d.net. All of the domains have similar registrant information, indicating the work of a single group.**\n\nThe group appears to be based in Palestine. The use of a shared exploit suggests some link between the TRD and this group.\n\n**FinFly Web in the Wild**\n\nWe traced workingulf.net, to a number of other domain names, including news­youm7.com (see Figure 10 below).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10: Domain names and IP addresses that we believe are associated with Egypt’s TRD. We redact only live domains_**\n\n**_and IP addresses, and show full details for inactive ones._**\n\nWe found a FinFly Web sample at http://videos.news­youm7.com/youm7/videos/5671264.html. FinFly Web is a FinFisher\n\nproduct that allows customers to create a website to infect targets with spyware. We identified the sample as FinFly Web given\n\nsubstantial similarity with leaked FinFly Web code.[84]\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: The FinFly Web page, asking users to install Adobe Reader XI. The download link points to a FinFisher spyware_**\n\n**_sample._**\n\nThe FinFly Web page appears to have a number of deficiencies. The attacker appears to have copied a page from the website of\n\nEgyptian newspaper Youm7, which appears in the background of the Adobe Reader popup. The attacker apparently did not notice\n\nthat the paths to the CSS resources are relative. Thus, the attack page tries to fetch CSS stylesheets and images from the attack\n\nsite, rather than the legitimate page. Since the attacker neither copied these resources to the attack site, nor changed the relative\n\npaths to point to the legitimate site, the attack page looks malformatted. The attacker made the same mistake with the news ticker\n\nIFRAME, resulting in the “Not Found” message in the background. Also, the attacker entitled the page “Video: Islamic State Enters\n\nEgypt,” but created a popup to install Adobe Reader, which is Adobe’s product for viewing PDF files. It is likely that the attacker\n\ninstead wanted to create a popup to install Adobe Flash, a plugin for viewing web videos. Additionally, the download link points to a\n\n.rar file,[85] which is suspicious as Adobe does not distribute its products in .rar files. Finally, the .exe inside the .rar file is not melded\n\nwith the Adobe Reader setup program, so a victim who executes the file may become suspicious when no Adobe setup program\n\nruns.\n\n### Italy: Shift from Hacking Team to FinFisher?\n\nWe identified one IP address in Italy (2.228.65.xxx) which served as a FinFisher server from 2014 to present. Earlier in 2014, and\n\nbefore our publication of our report on Hacking Team, the same IP address instead matched our fingerprint for Hacking Team\n\nspyware servers. This might indicate an Italian government agency switching from Hacking Team to FinFisher.\n\n### Oman: Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC\n\n\n-----\n\ny g, g g y g y, y,\n\nWarith Al­Maawali.[86] Leaked emails describe Warith as part of Oman’s Ministry of Interior, as well as a reseller of FinFisher\n\nproducts.[87] Other sites apparently run by Eagle Eye include a major Omani online forum, “oman0.net.” Eagle Eye founder Warith\n\nAl Maawali says the forum is “one of the most active sites with the largest user­base in Oman.”\n\nAn archived version of Eagle Eye’s website on the Wayback Machine showed Elaman GmbH as one of their partners, and “Security\n\nOrganizations” as their clients. Elaman is known to be a reseller of FinFisher products.[88]\n\n**_Figure 12: Old version of Eagle Eye’s website showing FinFisher reseller Elaman as a partner, and “Security_**\n\n**_Organizations” as among the firm’s clients._**\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this report we provided the first update on Citizen Lab’s previous FinFisher scanning work since a widely discussed 2014 hack of\n\nFinFisher. Despite the disclosure of sensitive customer data in that hack,[89] and the potential customer concerns this might cause,\n\nour latest scans have detected FinFisher servers in more countries than any previous round of scanning.\n\nFinFisher is still being used by a number of previously identified government clients, including Ethiopia, which is the defendant in an\n\nongoing lawsuit over previous FinFisher use.[90] We have also identified newly identified suspected customers, including: Angola,\n\nEgypt, Gabon, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey,\n\nand Venezuela.\n\nWhile we may not be detecting all FinFisher installations, this report’s methods improved on both our ability to detect installations,\n\nand to attribute FinFisher servers to specific governmental customers, whom we named. A key goal of this research is to provide a\n\nresource to those working on policy and research in this space. We also believe this kind of reporting is essential to help ensure\n\nthat citizens have the opportunity to hold their governments accountable. To this end, we identify government users, but redact\n\ncertain details about live infrastructure (like removing the last octet of IP addresses), whose disclosure might interfere with\n\nlegitimately sanctioned activities.\n\n### The Global Intrusion Software Market: Difficult to Study, Tricky to Regulate\n\nTh k t f i t i ft lik Fi Fi h i h ll i t t k b th k l f t t t\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q, g\n\nAs customer lists grow, so should concern over the documented abuse potential of intrusion software. Some governments clearly\n\nbelieve that it can be used, with proper oversight, in the service of legitimate criminal investigations and intelligence gathering.\n\nHowever, there are also well documented cases in which government customers have abused intrusion software to compromise\n\npolitical opponents within their borders, and overseas.\n\nThe current market seems to bypass some historic limits on the spread of advanced technical intrusion capabilities. Lack of a\n\nstrong Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, or absence of long term investment in research and\n\ndevelopment pipelines, are no longer impediments to obtaining computer exploitation and intrusion capabilities. These tools are\n\nnow available for purchase by any government. Certainly, lack of development in STEM should not preclude a country from having\n\naccess to sophisticated investigative tools. Indeed, an under­resourced state is likely to face security challenges that are just as\n\nserious as a more developed one.\n\nHowever, it can be difficult even for democratic governments with a strong rule of law to oversee secret investigative capabilities like\n\nintrusion software. These tools are likely to be acquired and used by divisions that are professionally discreet in their budgeting and\n\ninformation sharing. The information they generate may also have its origins deliberately disguised before being shared with other\n\ndepartments or agencies. Intrusion software presents a challenge for accountability in any country, and the oversight authorities in\n\nunder­resourced countries facing domestic or international security threats may be particularly ill­equipped in expertise and political\n\nclout, to identify or act on signs of misuse.\n\nPrevious research has shown that FinFisher has been used to target regime opponents in several cases. Notably, FinFisher has\n\nbeen used to hack Ethiopian and Bahraini democracy activists and opposition political figures. Meanwhile, research and revelations\n\nabout Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS), a competitor product, have also made it clear that some government\n\ncustomers used these tools to target their political opponents, rather than security threats to their citizens.\n\nDespite the well documented potential for abuse, the companies who develop and market these capabilities are reluctant and ill­\n\nequipped to conduct rigorous due diligence about potential customers, as recent revelations about Hacking Team have made clear.\n\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement, which regulates the export of weapons, as well as “dual use” technologies, was amended in 2013 to\n\ninclude items related to intrusion software, like FinFisher and Hacking Team’s RCS. Now, as participants like the European Union\n\nhave undertaken their own implementations (or are still developing theirs as in the case of the United States), it remains to be seen\n\nwhether or not this will lead to greater transparency and control, and what impact, if any, it will have on abusive surveillance.\n\nWe hope that continued evidence­based research of this sort will contribute to greater overall transparency about this market, and\n\nprovide much­needed points of reference for policy making and tracking the impact of regulatory efforts.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to Citizen Lab colleagues Morgan Marquis­Boire and Claudio Guarnieri, as well as Ron Deibert and Masashi Crete­\n\nNishihata.
