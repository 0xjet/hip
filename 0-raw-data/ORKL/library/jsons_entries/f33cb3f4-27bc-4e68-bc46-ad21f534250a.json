    "plain_text": "# Aggah Malware Campaign Expands to Zendesk and GitHub to Host Its Malware\n\n**[blogs.juniper.net/en-us/security/aggah-malware-campaign-expands-to-zendesk-and-github-to-host-its-malware](https://blogs.juniper.net/en-us/security/aggah-malware-campaign-expands-to-zendesk-and-github-to-host-its-malware)**\n\nSeptember 8, 2021\n\nJuniper Threat Labs has detected a new development in the Aggah malware campaign.\nPreviously, Aggah was known to be using legitimate infrastructures like BlogSpot, WordPress and\nPastebin to host its malware. Recently, we discovered an ongoing campaign where Aggah threat\nactors host their malware using Zendesk attachments and GitHub. This campaign delivers several\ntypes of malware that are focused on stealing sensitive information, such as usernames and\npasswords, credit card information stored in browsers and crypto wallets.\n\nWe detected a malicious Microsoft PowerPoint sample,\n```\ned70f584de47480ee706e2f6ee65db591e00a114843fa53c1171b69d43336ffe, which was\n\n```\ndownloaded from Zendesk’s own infrastructure as an attachment:\n\n```\nhttp://p17[.]zdusercontent[.]com/attachment/9061705/eyckz3zuedoivxtp0i629aoxe\n\n```\n\nThe PowerPoint document contains a malicious macro file that connects to a shortened\n```\nbitly.com URL which expands to\nhttps://mujhepyaslagihaimujhepanipilao[.]blogspot[.]com/p/mark2html in order\n\n```\ndownload and execute a malicious Script via mshta.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nVB script in .ppt executes another script from bitly.com using mshta.\n\n\nFig.1. The\n\nFig.2. Bitly url expands to\n\n\nhttps://mujhepyaslagihaimujhepanipilao[.]blogspot[.]com/p/mark2htmlThe script, `mark2.html,`\nhosted on `mujhepyaslagihaimujhepanipilao[.]blogspot[.]com, performs a series of`\noperations, such as creating a Run entry in the registry to execute a PowerShell script, download\nand execute another script using scheduled task and use WMI in the registry Run key to\ndownload and execute another script.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig.3. Series of operations done by mark2.html\nThe code shown in Figure 3 downloads from the following links and executes them.\n\nhttps://ia801405us[.]archive[.]org/11/items/pg_20210716/blessed.txt\n\nhttps://randikhanaekminar[.]blogspot[.]com/p/elevatednew1.html\n\nhttps://backbones1234511a[.]blogspot[.]com/p/elevatednew1backup.html\n\nhttps://startthepartyup[.]blogspot.com/p/backbone15.html\n\nhttps://ghostbackbone123[.]blogspot.com/p/ghostbackup14.html\n\n**Blessed.txt**\n\n[The PowerShell script is hosted on archive.org as](http://archive.org/) `blessed.txt . The PowerShell loads a stealer`\nmalware, known as Oski. The Oski malware is included in the PowerShell script as a hex-encoded\nstring. It uses a technique known as Signed Binary execution via `RegSvcs.exe and .NET`\n```\nAssembly.Load to load this binary as an added layer of protection since it’s not saved to the\n\n```\ndisk and only stays in memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4 Blessed.txt is a PowerShell script that contains a Windows executable which it loads via\nRegSvcs.exe\nOski was first seen in 2019. Today, it’s sold in Russian hacking forums for $70-$100. Oski\nmalware’s capabilities include:\n\nStealing cryptocurrency wallets\n\nStealing sensitive information stored in browsers such as credit card data, autofill data and\ncookies\n\nStealing credentials from various applications such as FTP, VPN and web browsers\n\nCapturing screenshots\n\nCollecting system information\n\nDownloading and installing additional malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFig . 5 Oski code that steals crypto and browser data\nOski connects to the following C2 server: 103.153.76.164\n\nAfter it collects and exfiltrates the data, it will delete traces of itself in the system.\n\n**Elevatednew1.html**\n\nOne other routine that we have listed above in Fig. 3 includes creating a scheduled task to\ndownload and execute another malicious script hosted on\n```\nhttps://randikhanaekminar[.]blogspot[.]com/p/elevatednew1.html . This malicious\n\n```\nscript loads another PowerShell script named `blessed.txt . This time, the script is hosted in`\nGitHub as follows:\n\n```\nhttps://raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/manasshole/newone/main/blessed.txt\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFig. 6 Script code inside elevatednew1.html executes a PowerShell hosted in GitHub.com\nThe malware that it tries to install is Agent Tesla, a .NET keylogger and RAT that logs keystrokes\nand the host’s clipboard content.\n\nThe other malicious scripts `backbone15.html and` `ghostbackup14.html are no longer`\navailable for download, while `elevatednew1backup.html is the same as` `elevatednew1.html`\n\nBefore publication of this blog, we have contacted Zendesk and Github and they quickly\nresponded to disable the hosted malware.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe threat actors’ primary goal is to steal sensitive information such as usernames and\npasswords, credit cards and crypto wallets. On the surface, this may seem to have a low impact in\ncomparison with ransomware operations targeting enterprises. However, the Aggah threat actors’\nmethod of using legitimate infrastructure is worrisome. As a defender, one way to disrupt\nmalicious activity is to detect their infrastructure. This is usually effective as it’s not that easy to\nchange infrastructures.\n\nAs we have observed and noted, threat actors using GitHub, Archive.org, Zendesk, GitHub,\nPastebin and Google Drive are not going away anytime soon and we expect their malicious efforts\nto continue. For instance, Juniper Threat Labs has also seen a growing usage of Zendesk to host\nmalware, which may warrant its own blog in the future.\n\nIn this particular case, [Juniper Networks’ Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP) solution detects the](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/security/advanced-threat-prevention.html)\nAggah malware file as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOC**\n```\ned70f584de47480ee706e2f6ee65db591e00a114843fa53c1171b69d43336ffe\n103[.]153[.]76[.]164\nhttps://raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/manasshole/newone/main/blessed.txt\nhttp://p17[.]zdusercontent[.]com/attachment/9061705/eyckz3zuedoivxtp0i629aoxe\nhttps://ia801405us[.]archive[.]org/11/items/pg_20210716/blessed.txt\nhttps://randikhanaekminar[.]blogspot[.]com/p/elevatednew1.html\nhttps://backbones1234511a[.]blogspot[.]com/p/elevatednew1backup.html\nhttps://startthepartyup[.]blogspot.com/p/backbone15.html\nhttps://ghostbackbone123[.]blogspot.com/p/ghostbackup14.html\n\n```\n\n-----",
