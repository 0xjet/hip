TA505 has been active in South Korea in 2019 and frequently distributes the_\n_FlawedAmmyy RAT, but we cannot verify the connection at this time._\n\n## Overview\n\nIn September 2019, Proofpoint researchers observed a prolific threat actor, [TA505, sending email](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter)\ncampaigns that attempt to deliver and install Get2, a new downloader. Get2 was, in turn, observed\n[downloading FlawedGrace,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505) [FlawedAmmyy, Snatch, and SDBbot (a new RAT) as secondary payloads.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leaked-ammyy-admin-source-code-turned-malware)\n\nIn this blog post, Proofpoint will detail the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with these\nlatest campaigns and provide a detailed analysis of Get2 downloader and SDBbot RAT.\n\nThese new developments are a continuation of a pattern where, since 2018, Proofpoint researchers\nobserved numerous threat actors increasingly distributing downloaders, backdoors, information stealers,\nremote access Trojans (RATs), and more as they abandoned ransomware as their primary payloads.\n\n[TA505 has been at the forefront of this trend, which began with the distribution of a new backdoor](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-shifts-times)\n[“ServHelper” in November 2018, and a new downloader malware, AndroMut earlier this year.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\n\n## Campaigns\n\nSince September 9, 2019, Proofpoint researchers started observing TA505 using Get2 as their initial\ndownloader (still at the time of this publication). At first, it downloaded traditional payloads including\nFlawedAmmyy and FlawedGrace. However, on October 7 Proofpoint researchers observed Get2\ndownloading the new RAT, SDBbot.\n\nIn addition to the new malware, these campaigns have continued to innovate in other aspects:\n\nTA505 remains a serious contender for the top positions in the volumes of emails distributed (most\ndays tens or hundreds of thousands of messages, but sometimes pushing into millions).\n\n\n-----\n\nTA505 continues to focus on targeting financial institutions alternating with more widely-targeted\ncampaigns going after other verticals.\nA recent focus on Greece, Germany, and Georgia as targeted geographies.\nNew Microsoft Office macros are used specifically with the Get2 downloader.\n\n_Figure 1: A selected chronology of TA505 malspam campaigns culminating with Get2 and SDBbot in_\n_September and October of 2019._\n\nBelow are the details of several notable malicious email campaigns.\n\n### September 9, 2019\n\nOn September 9 Proofpoint researchers observed tens of thousands of emails attempting to deliver\nMicrosoft Excel attachments with English and Greek lures. These emails targeted financial institutions in\nGreece, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Georgia, Sweden, Lithuania, and a few other countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe emails used the following example subjects and attachment names:\n\nSubject “HPE INV-02 - Invoice and documents” and attachment “hpe_s_hp-inv_02[.]xls”\nSubject “Need to Apply” and attachment “dc123456[.]xls”\nSubject “Παραστατικό” (translated from Greek: “Document”) and attachment “business cloud\n**invoice no142 09-09-2019[.]xls”**\nSubject “ΣΤΕΛΙΟΣ ΠΡΟΤΙΜΟΛΟΓΙΟ” (translated from Greek: “EXECUTIVE SUMMARY”) and\nattachment “προτιμολογιο[.]xls”\n\nThis was the first campaign where the new downloader Get2 was observed. However, in Proofpoint’s\ntesting, the later stage payloads were not observed at the time.\n\n_Figure 2: Example email delivering a malicious Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with an embedded Get2_\n_payload._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Example Microsoft Excel attachment using Greek language and targeting Greece._\n\n### September 20, 2019\n\nOn September 20, we observed hundreds of thousands of emails attempting to deliver Microsoft Excel and\n.ISO attachments with English and French lures. These emails targeted companies from different verticals\nin the United States and Canada.\n\nThe emails used the following example subjects and attachment names:\n\nSubject \"Reçu de paiement (facture 12345)\" and attachment \"facture_no_432478_v2[.]xls\"\nSubject \"Account opening form\" and attachment \"formulaire_01234.iso\" (ISO contains an Excel file\nsuch as \"0920_0123456[.]xls\")\n\nIn this campaign, Proofpoint researchers again observed the installation and execution of Get2 which in\n[turn downloaded FlawedGrace.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Email delivering an ISO attachment in a French-language email targeting Canada._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Microsoft Excel attachment using the French language and targeting Canada._\n\n### October 7, 2019\n\nOn October 7, instead of directly attached malicious Microsoft Excel files, Proofpoint researchers observed\nthousands of emails containing URL shortener links redirecting to a landing page that in turn links to an\nExcel sheet “request[.]xls”. This campaign only used the English language and targeted companies from\nvarious industries primarily in the United States.\n\nThe emails used the following example subjects:\n\nSubject ‘Admin shared \"request[.]xls\" with you’ where email contained a Bit.ly URL\n\nIn this campaign, Proofpoint researchers observed the execution of Get2, which downloaded SDBbot for\nthe first time.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Example email with a Bit.ly URL leading to a landing page that links to download of a malicious_\n_document; this uses stolen branding to increase the legitimacy of the shared file lure._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Dropbox-themed landing page with a lure asking users to click a button that links to the malicious_\n_document._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with embedded Get2 downloader luring the user to open the_\n_document and enable macros._\n\n## Microsoft Excel Document Analysis\n\nIn addition to TA505’s use of new malware, it should be noted that the new Get2 loader works in\nconjunction with a new Microsoft Excel macro. Get2 is embedded into the Microsoft Excel file as an object,\nwhich can be found as an image icon by scrolling through the document. It is extracted by the macro using\nthe following logic (note that this is an analysis of the September 9 macro and incremental changes were\nintroduced since):\n\nThe original Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is copied into the %TEMP% directory\nThe embedded object “xl\\embeddings\\oleObject1[.]bin” inside the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is\ncopied into the %TEMP% directory\nThe DLL inside oleObject1.bin is extracted and copied into %APPDATA% by the\n**“ReadAndWriteExtractedBinFile” function**\nThe DLL is loaded with LoadLibraryA\nThe DLL’s exported function, such as “Get2”, is run by the macro\n\nAn excerpt from the VBA code from the Microsoft Excel file that performs some of this is shown below. This\n[code appears to be in part borrowed from a Stack Overflow article (except it works to extract a file starting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52778729/download-embedded-pdf-file-in-excel/52778730)\nwith the “MZ” header instead of “PDF”).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Visual Basic macro code sample from the malicious Microsoft Excel spreadsheet used in_\n_conjunction with the Get2 downloader._\n\n## Get2 Downloader\n\nGet2 is a new downloader malware written in C++ and used in recent TA505 campaigns. The name is\nderived from the DLL export name used in the initial sample that was analyzed. Successive campaigns\nused different export names such as Amway, Hadno, Seven, and Wakeup.\n\nThe downloader collects basic system information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded\ncommand and control (C&C) server (Figure 10):\n\n_Figure 10: Example Get2 C&C request_\n\nThe POST data contains the following URL-encoded parameters:\n\n**D - Computer name**\n**U - Username**\n**OS - Windows version**\n**PR - Pipe-delimited process list**\n\nFigures 11 and 12 depict some example responses from the C&C server:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Example Get2 C&C response_\n\n_Figure 12: Example Get2 C&C response_\n\nThe C&C response data is pipe-delimited and each section contains a payload URL and an optional\nargument delimited by a semicolon.\n\nIn earlier observed versions of Get2, it’s payloads were executables run with the argument passed on the\ncommand line. In later samples, authors included additional code to check the argument for “RD86” and\n“RD64” (possibly short for “run DLL”). RD86 indicated the payload was a DLL to be injected and loaded.\nThe system was also scheduled to reboot a random amount of time later (more on the reboot in the SDBbot\nsection below). At the time of research, the RD64 code path had not been implemented, but will likely be\nsimilar to RD86 for 64-bit DLLs.\n\n## SDBbot Remote Access Trojan\n\nSDBbot is a new remote access Trojan (RAT) written in C++ that has been delivered by the Get2\ndownloader in recent TA505 campaigns. Its name is derived from the debugging log file (sdb.log.txt) and\nDLL name (BotDLL[.]dll) used in the initial analyzed sample. It also makes use of application shimming [1]\nfor persistence. SDBbot is composed of three pieces: an installer, a loader, and a RAT component.\n\n## Installer Component\n\nThe installer stores the RAT component in the registry and establishes persistence for the loader\ncomponent. In the analyzed sample, the installer was named “SdbInstallerDll[.]dll”. Most of its important\nstrings and data were XOR-encoded with a hardcoded 128-byte key.\n\nA registry value is created at “\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\<random 3 characters subkey>[random 1\n**character value name]” in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER depending on user**\nprivileges. A binary blob is stored at the value and has the following structure:\n\nCopyright notice (“Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.”)\nLoader shellcode (stored as a function in the installer)\nString consisting of “<random 3 characters from registry subkey>0INIT”\nCompressed RAT payload (stored in “.data1” PE section of the installer)\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the bot is running with a regular user privilege, persistence is established using the registry Run method.\nThe loader DLL component is written to “%APPDATA%\\mswinload[.]dll” and a “mswinload” value is\nadded to the “Run” key to execute ordinal #1 of the DLL with rundll32[.]exe.\n\nIf the bot is running with admin privileges on a Windows version newer than Windows 7, persistence is\nestablished using the registry “image file execution options” method. The loader DLL component is written\nto “%SYSTEM%\\mswinload0[.]dll” and added to the “VerifierDlls” value for “winlogon[.]exe”.\n\nIf the bot is running as admin on Windows XP or 7, persistence is established using application shimming\n\n[1]. It uses a method very similar to the one described by FireEye in their blog post “To SDB, Or Not To\nSDB: FIN7 Leveraging Shim Databases for Persistence” [3]. A shim database (SDB) is created (Figure 13)\nto patch services[.]exe with the loader code and then installed with sdbinst[.]exe:\n\n_Figure 13: Example shim database (SDB) created by SDBbot_\n\nAll three of the persistence mechanisms require a reboot to take effect and there is no additional code to\ncontinue executing the loader and RAT components from the installer. Proofpoint researchers speculate\nthat the reboot functionality in the Get2 downloader (described above) is used to continue SDBbot’s\nexecution after installation in the TA505 campaigns.\n\n## Loader Component\n\nIn the registry-based persistence mechanisms, a separate loader DLL is used to execute the RAT payload.\nIn the analyzed sample, the loader was named “RegCodeLoader[.]dll” and saved to disk as\n**“mswinload[.]dll” or “mswinload0[.]dll”. The application shimming-based persistence doesn’t use a**\nseparate DLL, but the code it patches into services[.]exe is similar in functionality. In both cases the\nrandom registry key and value name is patched into the loader code.\n\nThe loader component reads the binary blob stored in the registry and starts executing the loader shellcode\nstored there. The shellcode decompresses the RAT payload then loads and executes the DLL.\n\n## RAT Component\n\nIn the analyzed sample the RAT component was named “BotDLL[.]dll”. It has some typical RAT\nfunctionality such as command shell, video recording of the screen, remote desktop, port forwarding, and\nfile system access.\n\n\n-----\n\nSDBbot stores its C&Cs in a plaintext string or file ( ip.txt ). It uses a plaintext protocol over TCP port 443;\nan example session is shown in Figure 14:\n\n_Figure 14: Example SDBbot C&C protocol_\n\nThe bot starts the communication by sending and receiving an acknowledgment DWORD: 0xC0DE0000. It\nthen continues by sending basic system information:\n\n**ver - Likely malware version**\n**domain - Domain name**\n**pc - Computer name**\n**geo - Country code**\n**os - Windows version**\n**rights - User rights**\n**proxyenabled - Whether a proxy is configured**\n\nAfter the malware sends system information, the C&C server responds with a command DWORD.\nDepending on the command, the C&C server then sends additional arguments. Some of the commands\n(mostly the shell and video related ones) make use of 48-byte data structures to store various data. There\nare other commands which create, delete, and query the status of these data structures, so it is defined in\nFigure 15:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: 48-byte data structure used by some of the commands_\n\nThe available commands are:\n\n**2 - Get subcommand from C&C:**\n\n**“cmd” - Start a cmd[.]exe shell**\n**“shutdown_pc” - Shutdown**\n**“reboot” - Reboot**\n**“sleep utc” - Set sleep time**\n**“video online” - Get existing or create new video data structure**\n**“video stop” - Set a “stop” event in video data structure**\n**“rdpwrap install” - This command enables RDP in the registry, but despite its name does not**\ninstall the RDP Wrapper [4]\n**“rdpwrap uninstall” - If RDP Wrapper [4] was installed, uninstall it**\n**“portforward” - Setup a proxy between a target host and port and the C&C**\n**“run” - Execute command via cmd[.]exe, but don’t send output to the C&C**\n**“runreflective” - Download DLL from C&C, inject it into a freshly created rundll32[.]exe, and**\nreflectively load it\n**“keep_bot_online on” - Sets a flag and sleep timeout**\n**“keep_bot_online off” - Turns off a flag and sets sleep timeout to zero**\n**4 - Send number, type, and index of data structures**\n**5 - If shell or video recording is enabled, send shell output or screenshots to the C&C**\n**11 - Send number, index, and tag of command shell data structures**\n**12 - Write a command to a shell**\n**13 / 32 - Create a new, empty data structure and send its index to the C&C**\n**14 - Clean up and remove existing data structure**\n**15 - Write file**\n**23 - Get drive information or directory listing**\n\n\n-----\n\n**24 - Read file**\n**25 - Create directory**\n**26 - Delete file**\n**27 - Clean up and remove all data structures**\n**31 - Exact functionality is unclear. It writes a file using two data structures: one associated with the file**\nand other used for reading data from the C&C\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTA505 has helped shape the threat landscape for years, largely because of the massive volumes\nassociated with their campaigns through the end of 2017 and 2018. Over the last two years, Proofpoint\nresearchers have observed TA505 and a number of other actors focus on downloaders, RATs, information\nstealers, and banking Trojans. With this recently observed October 2019 push by TA505 with attacks on a\nwide range of verticals and regions, the actor’s usual “follow the money” behavioral pattern remains\nconsistent. The new Get2 downloader, when combined with the SDBbot as its payload appears to be\nTA505’s latest trick (or treat) for the Fall of 2019.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1138/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1138/)\n\n[2] [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/)\n\n[3] [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/fin7-shim-databases-persistence.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/fin7-shim-databases-persistence.html)\n\n[4] [https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**IOC** **IOC Type** **Description**\n\nhttps[://update365-office-ens[.com/rb8 URL Get2 callback\n\n                                            -
