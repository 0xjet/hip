This trend continued in 2019,\nwith further attacks in response to\nsanctions, diplomatic tensions, and\ntrade deals. This report considers\nmultiple examples of this parallel, from:\n\n    - Repeated cases of threat actors\nincorporating timely real-world events\ninto crafting convincing lures; to,\n\n    - Pakistan-based and India-based\nthreat actors engaging in ripostes to\none another’s cyber operations, and\neven copying techniques used by\nother threat actors; and,\n\n    - Information operations in the lead up\nto national elections.\n\nAs with 2018, PwC assesses it likely that\nthe alignment between cyber attacks\nand geopolitics will continue to be\nprominent through 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Intelligence gathering\n\n Action and reaction special status to Kashmir.

Following\nthe US withdrawal from the Joint\nComprehensive Plan of Action in 2018,\nIran announced at multiple times\nthroughout 2019 that it had resumed its\nnuclear enrichment programme – which it\nhad previously stopped in order to relieve\ninternational sanctions imposed on oil\nexports. Throughout the year, the US\nwere also engaged in sustained talks with\nthe North Korean government about a\nproposed nuclear energy agreement, with\na view to halt or delay North Korea’s\nnuclear program in exchange for the\nlifting of currently-imposed export\nsanctions. Meanwhile, the Indian\nsubcontinent is also witnessing a race\nbetween the two main nuclear players in\nthe region, India and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2019, PwC observed intense targeting\nof the nuclear energy space by multiple\nthreat actors, with a strong concentration\nof activity by Asia-based threat actors. At\nthe very beginning of 2019, PwC\nidentified a fake webmail login page\npretending to belong to the Pakistan\nAtomic Energy Commission (PAEC), and\nwhich looked like an exact copy of the\nlegitimate PAEC equivalent. The fake\nwebpage was configured by an IP\naddress controlled by the India-based\nthreat actor that PwC tracks internally as\nOrange Berserker (a.k.a. Viceroy Tiger).\nAround the same time, the Orange\nBerserker-controlled IP also set up\n\n\ndomains spoofing the Pakistan Navy\nwebmail login.[5] Later in the year, PwC\nalso observed a further campaign\ndelivering a malicious document titled\n‘PAEC_Security_Advisory.doc’,[6] which\nwas concerned with the reported\ncompromise of a large set of Pakistani\nsocial media by ‘our adversaries’. The\nmalicious document used macros to\ndeliver a malware family that PwC\ninternally named RaveRAT, and which\nbears some similarities to CrimsonRAT as\nwell as PeppyRAT.\n\nOne of the most notable campaigns\ntargeting the nuclear sector in 2019\ncompromised the Kudankulam Nuclear\nPower Plant (KKNPP) in Tamil Nadu, a\njoint venture between India and Russia.[7]\nPwC analysts were able to independently\nverify that the malware assessed to have\ninfected KKNPP’s networks was a highly\ntailored sample of a backdoor known in\nopen source as DTrack and Preft.[8] PwC\nassesses that DTrack, and the\ncustomised DTrack sample involved in the\nKKNPP incident, are tied to North\nKorea-based threat actor Black Artemis,\nwidely known in open source as Lazarus.\nThe malware had been configured with\nspecific knowledge of the KKNPP internal\nnetwork, and used a further compromised\nhost on the network as a traffic proxy,\nimplying that the threat actor had\ncompromised and reconnoitered KKNPP\nprior to the deployment of the customised\nDTrack payload. Analysing the sample,\nPwC analysts did not find evidence of\ndestructive capability in the malware,\n\n\nrather, it appeared more oriented towards\ninformation theft. This is not the first time\nthat North Korea-based threat actors had\ntargeted, and successfully compromised,\nnuclear plants or organisations in the\nnuclear sector. In 2014, for example,\nBlack Banshee had breached the Korea\nHydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP)\nCorporation,[9] leaking stolen confidential\ndocuments as well as attempting\nsabotage wiper attacks against\nvictim machines.\n\nThe targeting of nuclear organisations\nthat PwC observed in 2019 broadly aligns\nwith individual states’ national interests\nand strategic objectives, it also reflects at\na higher-level the current geopolitical\nbalances and international relations.\nPwC expects the nuclear sector to\ncontinue drawing cyber targeting,\nespecially by espionage motivated threat\nactors, throughout 2020.\n\n\n5 ‘An atomic phish’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20190102-01A\n\n6 ‘Recycling and renewal chez Green Havildar’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190403-01A\n\n7 ‘An Indian nuclear power plant suffered a cyberattack. Here's what you need to know’, The Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/04/\nan-indian-nuclear-power-plant-suffered-cyberattack-heres-what-you-need-know/ (4th November 2019)\n\n8 ‘Hello! My name is Dtrack’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/ (23rd September 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In the Python’s coils\n\nThroughout 2019, PwC analysts tracked\nsustained activity assessed to be\nconducted by the Russia-based\nespionage threat actor Blue Python\n(a.k.a. Turla or Snake). Blue Python\nconsistently targeted Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries, including Austria,\nCzech Republic, Moldova, Ukraine and\nArmenia. The threat actor continued to\nfocus on compromising government\nministries (with special attention on the\nMinistries of Foreign Affairs and\nMinistries of the Interior) as well as other\ngovernment entities and government\norganisations, with some targeting of\nNGOs involved in business and defence.\n\nThe threat actor continues to rely on a\nwide toolset consisting of multiple\ndownloader, dropper, and backdoor\nmalware families. In 2019, PwC analysts\nobserved Blue Python adding new\nmalware to its arsenal, including the\nTopinambour downloader,[10] but also\ncontinuing to develop existing tools, with\nupdated variants of the Kazuar backdoor\nused to target the Czech Republic.[11] In\nthat instance, the threat actor leveraged\ncompromised WordPress sites for\ncommand and control infrastructure. In\nJuly 2019, Blue Python compromised the\nwebsites of legitimate organisations in\nthe Armenian NGO sector to act as\nwatering holes for further victims. The\ncompromised websites delivered the\nBlue Python implant known as Skipper –\na first-stage profiling tool used to deploy\nother, more powerful backdoors to\nvictims of special interest.\n\n\nIn summer 2019, PwC detected samples\nof Skipper used in a multi-stage infection\nchain targeting a private sector entity that\ndeviated from Blue Python’s typical\nvictimology: an Asian shipbuilding\ncompany, active in the production of\nArctic-capable vessels.[12] The downloader\nfor the sample contained unobfuscated\nmacros; this is uncharacteristic of Blue\nPython’s well-designed decoys and\nmight indicate that the particular\ndocument chain used in the attack was\nstill under development at the time it was\ndeployed. Moreover, analysing the\nmetadata of the malicious document and\ncomparing with the date a sample was\nuploaded to an online multi-antivirus\nscanner indicates that the threat actor\nbegan targeting potential victims less\nthan a week after creating the malicious\ndocument. The Arctic is a strategically\nsensitive region due to its access to\nnatural resources and the opening up of\ntransport routes, and the Arctic Shipping\nRoute has been a crucial element in\ncooperation between South Korea and\nRussia. In light of this, the targeting of the\nAsian shipbuilding company operating in\nthe Arctic would align with Russian\nstrategic economic interests and\nintelligence requirements.[13]\n\nBlue Python continues to conduct\ngovernment espionage and intelligence\ngathering operations; in October 2019,\nthe UK National Cyber Security Centre\n(NCSC) and the US National Security\nAgency (NSA) publicly assessed that\nBlue Python gained access to assets\nincluding malware and cryptographic\n\n\nkeys belonging to an Iran-based threat\nactor – which a linked open-source\nreport indicates is Yellow Maero (a.k.a.\nOilRig).[14] Blue Python was then able to\ndeploy malware using Yellow Maero’s\nown infrastructure, and to exploit Yellow\nMaero’s established access to\ncompromised victims for its own\nintelligence collection purposes against\ntargets in the Middle East. The NCSC’s\nand NSA’s description of this activity\nreinforces the assessment of Blue\nPython as a highly sophisticated and\nwell-resourced threat actor, able to\nexperiment with new tools and even\nrepurpose complex tools developed by\nother foreign actors. PwC assesses it is\nlikely Blue Python will continue with\nsophisticated campaigns going into\n2020, with government entities and the\ndefence sector particularly at risk.\n\n\n10 ‘Taste of Topinambour: Turla hacking group hides malware in anti-internet censorship software’, Kaspersky, https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2019_\ntaste-of-topinambour (15th July 2019)\n\n11 ‘Kazuar in Flight’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20190205-01A\n\n12 ‘The Skipper's New Ships’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190624-01\n\n13 ‘PolarBear: cyber espionage in the Arctic’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20190703-01A\n\n14 ‘Ad i T l l it I i APT t d f i ti A j i t t f th NCSC d NSA hi hli hti T l ti it ’ NCSC NSA\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2019, cyber espionage campaigns continued to align, in targeting and aims, with changing\ninternational relations.

Mirroring this association in phishing campaigns, threat actors often\nsent timely and relevant malicious lure documents to victims in order to infect them. While this\ntechnique is not new, in 2019 PwC observed threat actors frequently stealing official\ngovernment documents and using them as infection vectors, or repurposing them shortly after\n\n\n**Case study – Phishing emails exploit**\n**article hours after its release**\n\nIn late October 2019, PwC tracked the\nespionage threat actor Red Lich (a.k.a.\nMustang Panda) as it used a lure\ndocument themed around a visit made\nto Tibet by the US ambassador for\nInternational Religious Freedom. The\nthreat actor crafted the malicious\npayload by taking material from a news\narticle published just hours earlier, as\nwell as pictures from the Central Tibetan\nAdministration’s website.[15] The timeliness\nof the lure was likely intended to make\nthe document appear to be a legitimate\nnews item, enticing victims to open the\nmalicious attachment. Red Lich has\nused similar types of lure documents, as\nwell as fake CVs, to compromise victims\nsince at least 2017.[16,17] The threat actor\nhas historically targeted nongovernmental organisations (NGOs),\npro-democracy activists and minority\nrights groups across Asia, as well as\ninternational policy think tanks.\n\n\n**Case study – Summits and**\n**anniversaries exploited**\n\nIn mid-April 2019, PwC analysts\ndetected a sample of the NOKKI\nbackdoor, which is attributed to North\nKorea-based espionage threat actor\nBlack Shoggoth (a.k.a. APT37).[18] In that\ninstance, NOKKI was delivered to targets\nvia a .exe file masquerading as a PDF\ndocument with the filename ‘Kim, Putin\nhave high hopes for their 1st one-on-one\nmeeting.exe’. The executable would\ninstall NOKKI on victim systems while\ndisplaying to the user a benign\nAssociated Press article about the\nKim-Putin summit of that same month.[19]\n\nPwC identified another NOKKI sample\ncreated on the same day as the sample\ndescribed above. This sample likely\ntargeted individuals involved in\ndiplomatic relations between Norway\nand South Korea, as the backdoor was\nlaced with an RSVP for a May 2019\nreception in South Korea for the\n‘Constitution Day of the Kingdom of\nNorway and the 60th anniversary of the\ndiplomatic relations’.[18]\n\n\n**Case study – Invitations used to**\n**lure victims**\n\nIn summer 2019, PwC discovered that\nGreen Havildar had been targeting\nindividuals associated with the Indian\nmilitary, sending them an invitation to a\nformal event allegedly to be held in\nNovember 2019 at the Indian National\nDefence College.[20] The threat actor highly\ntailored the lures to masquerade as the\ntargets’ wives.\n\n**Case study – Military conferences high**\n**on White Ioke’s agenda**\n\nEspionage threat actor White Ioke (a.k.a.\nOceanLotus) timed its phishing\ndocuments around real-world events of\ninterest to its targets. In April 2019, PwC\nobserved the threat actor delivering a\nmalicious document titled ‘Form_\nProvisional Agenda of the ASEAN Senior\nOfficials Preparatory Meeting.doc’.[21]\nInterestingly, an ASEAN Senior Officials’\nMeeting was scheduled to take place in\nThailand on 28th May 2019. White Ioke\nhas used lure documents about military\nand ASEAN-themed conferences before,\nfor example ‘2018 Cambodia Outlook\nConference.doc’. Many of the threat\nactor’s lures were written in Vietnamese,\nKhmer, or Mandarin, reflecting White\nIoke’s known targeting.\n\n\n15 ‘Red Lich slight TTP shift’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20191101-01A\n\n16 ‘Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for June: MUSTANG PANDA’, CrowdStrike, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversaryof-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/ (15th June 2018)\n\n17 ‘2018 Global Threat Report’, CrowdStrike, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreatReport.pdf\n\n18 ‘NOKKI against Norway’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20190424-01A\n\n19 ‘Threats under the Spotlight’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TUS-20190528-01A\n\n20 ‘Green Havildar Malicious Event Invitation’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20190731-01A\n\n21 ‘Whit I k ASEAN i t ti ’ P C Th t I t lli CTO TIB 20190417 01A\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Working the supply chain: a continued focus\n\n\nSince at least 2017, a significant trend for\nsophisticated threat actors has been their\ntargeting of third parties in order to reach\ntheir customers. Threat actors will mask\nbackdoors with legitimate digital\ncertificates, direct malicious traffic\nthrough trusted companies (as\ncompromised command and control\nservers (C2s)), and use established\norganisations to spread malware, in order\nto gain access to victims and\navoid detection.\n\nIn particular, China-based threat actors\nhad an increased focus on exploiting the\ntrust and privileged access afforded to\nthird-party suppliers.\n\n**Case study – Compromised**\n**software updates**\n\nASUS Live Update is a utility that is\npre-installed on Asus products, and is\nrequired to provide real-time updates to\ncore software components such as a\nmachine’s BIOS. In 2019, it was\ndiscovered that ASUS pushed\ncompromised software updates for\nseveral months in the latter half of 2018 in\nan operation called ShadowHammer.[22]\nThreat actors compromised ASUS and\nmanipulated Live Update in order to\ninstall a backdoor on victim machines\nwithout end users’ knowledge. Although\nit is estimated that the number of\ncompromised victims may be in the\nhundreds of thousands, it is likely that\nonly a few hundred of these were the\nultimate victims of Operation\nShadowHammer, which is assessed to\nbe a highly targeted operation despite\nits blanket-attack tactic for delivery of\nthe malware.\n\n**Winnti collective exploits the**\n**supply chain**\n\nPwC assesses that the users of Winnti\nencompasses activity by multiple\nChina-based threat actors, which\n\n\noccasionally share infrastructure,\ntechniques, and implants. Most notably,\nthese actors are known for having access\nto a version of the ‘Winnti backdoor’.\nWhile the threat actors share tools,\ntechniques, and procedures, they often\noperate independently with different\nobjectives. This could be attributed to a\nsmall number of key developers moving\naround threat actors, however, PwC\nassesses it likely that they operate under\na digital quartermaster arrangement. The\nPwC Threat Intelligence team tracks at\nleast five China-based clusters as part of\nthe Winnti collective, although it is\nnotoriously difficult to distinguish among\nthreat actors due to their likely use of a\ndigital quartermaster.\n\nThe threat actors PwC tracks as part of\nthe Winnti collective have also been\nlinked to multiple supply chain attacks.\nProminent examples include the\ncompromises of CCleaner and\nNetSarang in 2017,[23, 24, 25] in which the\nthreat actor deployed the ShadowPad\nbackdoor, developed by one of the core\nthreat actors in the Winnti collective. In\nOctober 2019, open sources reported\nthat the ShadowPad backdoor had been\nupdated, and was being used to target\nan Asian mobile software and hardware\nmanufacturer, likely as part of a supply\nchain attack.\n\nSince 2011, the Winnti malware family\nhas been, and continues to be, deployed\nin targeted intrusions across a range of\nsectors. PwC research from May 2019\nidentified more than 150 systems\nspanning 23 countries and a wide variety\nof sectors that had been compromised\nby the Winnti malware.[26]\n\nVictims within the entertainment and\nmedia sector include gaming companies,\nwhich aligns to the earliest known\ntargeting by a threat actor using the\nWinnti backdoor.\n\n\n22 ‘Operation ShadowHammer: a high-profile supply chain attack’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/ (23rd April 2019)\n\n23 ‘Connecting the dots: Exposing the arsenal and methods of the Winnti Group’, ESET, https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-unnerving-supply-chain-attack-that\ncorrupted-ccleaner/ (14th October 2019)\n\n24 ‘ShadowPad in corporate networks’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/ (15th August 2017)\n\n25 ‘Inside the unnerving supply chain attack that corrupted CCleaner’, Wired, https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methodswinnti/ (17th April 2018)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This graph displays the sectors targeted by the Winnti collective in order of most targeted.\n\nTechnology and\ntelecommunications\n\nReligious organisation/Dissident\n\nManufacturing\n\nGovernment/public sector\n\nTransport and logistics\n\nEntertainment and media\n\nEducation\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DNS hijacking\n\nDNS hijacking involves compromising\nDNS infrastructure providers or related\nparts of the DNS ecosystem in order to\naccess further victims. Compromising\nDNS infrastructure providers allows\nthreat actors to modify DNS records and\nredirect traffic meant for a legitimate\nserver to an attacker-controlled server\ninstead. There were two large-scale DNS\nhijacking campaigns active during 2019,\nreferred to as DNSpionage and Sea\nTurtle. DNSpionage was uncovered in\nNovember 2018, as a campaign initially\ntargeting Lebanon and the UAE.\nIn April 2019, a state-sponsored attack\nmanipulating DNS systems was\ndisclosed and named Sea Turtle.\n\n- The two campaigns use different\nperson-in-the-middle technologies,\ndifferent proxies, and different\ninfrastructure, yet both targeted DNS\ninfrastructure providers and\ngovernment entities.\n\n\n\n- The Iran-based threat actor behind\nDNSpionage compromised the name\nservers of legitimate public sector\nwebsites in Lebanon and the UAE.[27 ]\n\nThis allowed the threat actor to\nchange DNS records for victim\nwebsites and, as a result, users\nattempting to reach the legitimate\nwebsites were unwittingly redirected\nto rogue IP addresses instead.\nWebsites including ministries,\nairlines, and public domains in the\nMiddle East were impacted.\n\n- Teal Kurma – the Turkey-based threat\nactors behind Sea Turtle – used\nvarious methods to carry out DNS\nhijacking attacks.[28] They\ncompromised organisations, pivoting\nthrough networks searching for\ncredentials that would allow them to\nchange DNS records. They also\ncompromised DNS registrars. DNS\nregistrars sell domain names and\nmanage the DNS records on behalf\n\n\nof the customers. By compromising\nthe registrars, the threat actor could\nchange the registrars’ customers’\nDNS records. Open-source reporting\nalleges that the Sea Turtle threat\nactor compromised at least one DNS\nregistry. Registries manage top level\ndomains, such as .com and .co.uk;\ncompromising a DNS registry would\nallow the threat actor to alter a much\ngreater number of DNS records.\n\nA concern for the near future is that other\nthreat actors will follow Sea Turtle’s\nsuccess and also attack the global DNS\nsystem – attacks that ultimately\nundermine the trust users have in the\ninternet itself.\n\n\n27 ‘DNSpionage campaign targets Middle East’, Cisco Talos, https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html (27th November 2018)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Certified!\n\nNorth Korea-based threat actor Black\nArtemis is known for its abuse of valid\ncode-signing certificates to exploit trust\nand pass antivirus checks.[29] In June\n2019, PwC analysts detected Black\nArtemis activity resembling the\ntradecraft displayed in an earlier\nintrusion against a Chilean bank.[30]\nThe threat actor was using a valid digital\ncertificate, issued by a global security\ncompany to a UK-based private limited\ncompany, to sign a GUI application\nmimicking a recruitment form, but\nactually downloading a malicious\npayload in the background. PwC\nassesses it is highly likely that the threat\nactor, or a cyber crime signing service in\nits supply chain, impersonated the\nUK-based company to obtain a valid\ncertificate, rather than compromising the\nlegitimate company, and that it is unlikely\nthat the threat actor was trying to phish\nvictims by posing as such a company.\n\nWhat was notable in this campaign was\nthat the threat actor employed a\nsophisticated process in order to obtain\nthe certificate. Firstly, it likely conducted\nreconnaissance of vendors based in the\nUK with some software development\ncapability, then, the threat actor directly\ncontacted the certificate issuer\nmasquerading as a legitimate company.\n\n\nThe certificate issuer likely verified the\nlegitimate company’s identity based on\nthe spoofed email address and other\nreputation-based services – which\nmeans that to succeed in spoofing the\nUK-based company, the threat actor had\nto socially engineer a reputation-based\nservice, requesting an update of the\ncontact details for the legitimate\ncompany and providing a spoofed email\naddress instead. The same certificate\nwas then used to sign a code injector\nutility utilised in a different campaign.[31]\n\nThreat actor Andariel, which PwC tracks\nas a sub-group of Black Artemis, also\nabused valid digital certificates in the\nsummer of 2019.[32] The threat actor\nexploited a certificate issued by a South\nKorean software security company to\nsign binaries of a new reloaded version\nof its historic tool Rifdoor in an\nespionage campaign PwC tracked as\nANONYBR.\n\n###### No Mr. Bond, I expect to read all your texts\n\nIn 2019, PwC analysed a malicious\nimplant targeting mobile\ntelecommunications infrastructure,[33]\nlater called ‘MESSAGETAP’ in opensource reporting.[34] The implant runs at\nroot level, which requires a threat actor\nto have already compromised a target in\n\n\nthe telecommunications sector before\ndeploying this tool. The malware is\nspecifically designed to target Short\nMessage Service (SMS) Centres and is\nable to monitor SMS messages in real\ntime and extract their content and\nmetadata. Given the features and\ncapabilities of the malware, PwC\nassesses it is likely that the threat actor\nbehind MESSAGETAP compromised\ntelecommunications infrastructure used\nfor SMS, and exploited the knowledge\ngained for cyber espionage activities.\nMESSAGETAP has the ability to target\nspecific phone and International Mobile\nSubscriber Identity (IMSI) numbers, and\neven specific keywords contained in\nmessages. PwC saw evidence\nsuggesting that the malware was in\ndevelopment around May 2018, and that\nparticular countries were being\nspecifically targeted.\n\nSimilar tools were previously reported as\nbeing operated by intelligence agencies.\nIt will be crucial to continue monitoring\nthe evolution of this tool and activity\nassociated with it, as the ability for a\nthreat actor to deploy MESSAGETAP\nimplies a capability to conduct both\nmass-scale as well as precise\nsurveillance on targets.\n\n\n29 ‘Exploiting inherent trust in certificates’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20190312-01A\n\n30 ‘Bluenoroff's recruitment drive’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190605-01A\n\n31 ‘Lazarus is Watching’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190621-01A\n\n32 ‘Rifdoor reloaded The ANONYBR campaign’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190905-02A\n\n33 ‘Nono Mr Bond I expect to read all your texts’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20191030-01A\n\n34 ‘MESSAGETAP: Who is reading your text messages?’ FireEye http://www fireeye com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/messagetap-who-is-reading-your-text-messag\n\n-----\n\n###### Threats to mobile\n\n\nOne of the defining trends of 2019 was\nthe growing attention that threat actors\nturned to mobile malware and\ntrojanised mobile applications, as well\nas to the exploitation of mobile devices\nmore broadly.\n\nPwC saw numerous threat actors active\nin this space, either using exploits to\ndirectly compromise victim mobile\ndevices, or socially engineering targets\ninto installing malicious applications on\ntheir mobile phones. Aside from\nfinancially motivated cyber criminal\nactivities, in many of the cases that PwC\nobserved mobile malware, it was used to\ntarget specific demographics, groups, or\neven individuals.\n\n\nIn August 2019, PwC tracked an\nespionage campaign by North Koreabased threat actor Black Shoggoth.\nThe threat actor posed as an exponent\nof a Christian minority within North\nKorea in need of aid, indicating\npossible targeting of religious\ncommunities or defectors. The threat\nactor also sent spear-phishing emails\nmentioning a North Korean uranium\nmine; with realistic probability, the\nthreat actor was trying to attract\ninterest from the victim given the\nconcurrent escalation of North Korean\nmissile testing. The spear-phishing\nemails delivered samples of one of\nBlack Shoggoth’s main tools, ROKRAT,\nas well as a malicious Android\napplication that PwC named\nROKDROID. The application has\nin-built malicious functionality, is\ndesigned to remain persistent across\nphone reboots, and starts collecting\ninformation as soon as it is installed on\na victim device. Its permissions\nindicate its functionality, which\nincludes accessing the phone’s camera\nand microphone, reading SMS\n\n\n###### Malware in your pocket: Malicious applications make the rounds\n\n\n**Case study – ROKDROID, DragonMessenger, KevDroid**\n\n\nmessages, and processing calls.\nROKDROID is able to communicate\nwith Yandex or Dropbox C2s, and\ncontains false-flag configuration\ninformation as well as anti-analysis\nmeasures.\n\nAround the same time as the\nROKDROID campaign, Black\nShoggoth also developed a malicious\nAndroid application known in open\nsource as DragonMessenger, which,\naccording to third-party research, was\nadded to Google Play in October 2019.[35]\nThe application was distributed via a\nWordPress website posing as a\nfundraising service for supporting\nNorth Korean defectors, and targeted\nthat same demographic for espionage\npurposes.\n\nThis is not the first time that North\nKorea-based threat actors have\nexperimented with trojanised or\nmalicious applications, suggesting that\nthis will, with realistic probability,\ncontinue to be an area of capability for\ndevelopment by the threat actors.\n\n\n**Case study – Fake voices in Kashmir**\n\nIn July 2019, PwC detected a malicious\nAndroid application attempting to\nimpersonate ‘Kashmir Voice’, a blog\ncontaining news about the Kashmir\nregion.[26] Pivoting on the application’s\nmetadata, PwC analysts identified\nmultiple related resources: fragments\nof document exploits, process dumps,\nnetwork fingerprinting tools and\nanonymity tools, as well as Android\ndevelopment frameworks. PwC\nassesses that an individual that\n\n\noperates within a known India-based\nespionage threat actor likely\ndeveloped the Android application.\nThe application was highly likely\ndesigned for espionage rather than\ncyber criminal purposes, targeting\nindividuals in Kashmir or with an\ninterest in Kashmir, during a\nheightened state of geopolitical\ntension around the region.\n\n\n35 ‘Dragon Messenger’, ALYac EST Security, https://blog.alyac.co.kr/attachment/cfile1.uf@99A46A405DC8E3031C9E2A.pdf (11th November 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Dangers to two-factor authentication\n\nCyber criminal threat actors also\nincreasingly targeted mobile devices as\na new revenue stream. The techniques\nand tools used varied from fraudulent\nbanking applications used to capture\naccess credentials, to full-scale malware\nsystems designed to intercept messages\nand harvest data stored on infected\ndevices.[36] The introduction of the\nSecond European Payment Services\nDirective (PSD2) in 2019 added Strong\nCustomer Authentication (SCA) to online\n\n\ntransactions and contactless payments.\nOnce fully implemented, online\ntransactions will require some form of\ntwo-factor authentication (2FA), and\nmany 2FA solutions rely on\nauthentication via SMS or voice\nmessages to confirm transactions.\nCyber criminal threat actors have already\ndeveloped techniques targeting SMS\n2FA solutions used for online banking\nand ecommerce systems. For example,\nin February 2019, threat actors\nintercepted text messages containing\ntwo-factor authentication codes for\ncustomer transactions with a UK-based\n\n\nbank.[37] They exploited flaws in the\nSignalling System 7 protocol to bypass\nthe two-factor authentication used by\nthe bank, defrauding a small number of\ncustomers. In a later case, the threat\nactors behind the TrickBot malware\nintroduced a new module in July 2019 to\ncapture data required to conduct\nSIM-swapping attacks, which enables\nthem to port a victim’s mobile phone\naccount to a device under criminal\ncontrol. Once established, the attackers\ncan intercept incoming voice and SMS\nmessages and authorise payments via\nSMS-based 2FA.[38]\n\n\n36 'McAfee Mobile Threat Report', McAfee, https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-mobile-threat-report-2019.pdf\n\n37 ‘Criminals hit Metro Bank with multi-factor authentication bypass SS7 attack’, SC Media, https://www.scmagazineuk.com/criminals-hit-metro-bank-multiauthenticati b 7 tt k/ ti l /1524670 (4th F b 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cyber crime scene\n\n\nCyber criminal activity continued to be\nan extremely significant threat to\ncommercial organisations and\nenterprises. Despite law enforcement\ncrackdowns and temporary lulls in\nactivity, the cyber criminal market\neffectively consolidated around large,\nestablished players behind some of the\nlargest cyber criminal operations. PwC\nalso observed a solid continuation of\n2018 trends, including formjacking and\nMagecart skimmers (which we discuss\nlater in this section), as well as the\nproliferation of ransomware variants –\nranging between spam operations and\nextremely narrowly targeted attacks.\n\nHowever, PwC also saw new financially\nmotivated threat actors rise to\nprominence, such as TA505, known for\nlarge scale spam operations, and White\nJackalope (a.k.a. Silence) with its\ninternational targeting of banks.\nLikewise, the cyber criminal market\nincreasingly sought a diversification of\nrevenue streams; rather than relying on\nthe theft of banking credentials or POS\nmalware, ransomware was often seen as\nan effective means to this end.\n\nFinally, one of the most interesting\nobservations on the cyber criminal front\nin 2019 was evidence suggesting that\ncertain threat actors, long considered to be\nespionage motivated and with objectives\naligned to national interests, have been\nduplicating and dividing their efforts to\nalso perform cyber criminal activities.\n\n###### Double-down espionage-crime\n\nHistorically, criminal threat actors and\nadvanced persistent threats (APTs) acted\nin strict alignment with their individual\naim or tasking, focusing on fulfilling one\nspecific objective – either espionage or\n\n\nfinancial gain for example. Even in cases\nwhere a threat actor would run multiple\nconcurrent campaigns with different\nvictims, these tended to be linked by an\noverarching purpose such as intellectual\nproperty theft, or intelligence collection.\nIn 2019 however, PwC observed a\ngrowing trend of threat actors ‘doublingdown’ their operations: conducting\nsophisticated and targeted espionage\ncampaigns as well as financially\nmotivated ones, at times even\nconcurrently. In some cases, the\nfinancially motivated element of these\n‘double’ operations is run on the side of\nother tasking by the same operators\nresponsible for espionage campaigns.\nHowever, in other cases, this duplication\nof purpose and targets highly likely\nstems from direct or indirect state\ntasking aligning with government\nstrategic objectives.\n\n**It’s not all games**\n\nThe threat actor that PwC tracks as Red\nKelpie (a.k.a. APT41) has been active\nsince at least 2012, and has\ncompromised a significant number of\norganisations on a global scale and\nacross sectors including technology,\ntelecommunications, and healthcare. In\ncompromising such organisations, Red\nKelpie mostly sought to exfiltrate\nintellectual property, confidential\nbusiness information, or intelligence to\nbe used for surveillance – but the same\nthreat actor is also known to attack\nvictims for financially motivated\nreasons.[39, 40] In its continued targeting of\nthe video game industry since 2012, and\nof cryptocurrency organisations since at\nleast 2019, Red Kelpie used the same\ntoolset for both financially motivated\nattacks and espionage operations.\n\n\nHowever, despite overlaps in toolset and\ninfrastructure,[41] the manipulation of\nin-game currencies as well as attempts\nto deploy commodity ransomware on\ncertain victims’ systems suggest that\nRed Kelpie runs financially motivated\noperations that are separate, and very\ndifferent, from its espionage activity.\n\n**Crimson for crime**\n\nAnother espionage-focused threat actor\nthat also engaged in cyber criminal\nactivity is Green Havildar. Green Havildar\nhas been consistent in its targeting of the\nIndian government and military, as well\nas other nations, such as Kazakhstan,\nsince 2016. In this timespan, the threat\nactor has progressively widened its\ntoolset, automated the building of its\nmain malware tool CrimsonRAT, and\ntaken steps to incrementally improve its\nanti-detection capabilities as well as\noperational security.[42] However, in 2018,\nPwC was able to connect Green Havildar\nto Gorgon Group, a threat actor\nengaging in financially motivated cyber\ncriminal activity. At that time, PwC\nassessed that Gorgon Group at the very\nleast shared access to resources as well\nas infrastructure with Green Havildar.[32] In\nthe autumn of 2019, PwC tracked a spam\ncampaign by Gorgon Group distributing\ncommodity backdoors as well as\nCrimsonRAT for cyber criminal purposes,\nrather than espionage. The use of\nCrimsonRAT, which so far is uniquely\ntied to Green Havildar, supports the\nassessment that Gorgon Group is an\nintegral part of Green Havildar, and that\nit is able to conduct financially motivated\ncampaigns that are independent of the\nthreat actor’s espionage operations.[43]\n\n\n39 ‘Nono, Mr Bond, I expect to read all your texts’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-2019-10-30-01A\n\n40 'Knock Knock Whos there', PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190514-01A\n\n41 ‘Double Dragon: APT41, a dual espionage and cyber crime operation’, FireEye, https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/ (7th August 2019)\n\n42 ‘Unmasking Green Havildar’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-20181127-01A\n\n\n-----\n\n**Formjacking frenzy: Magecart**\n\nThe umbrella term ‘Magecart’ describes\nthe use of JavaScript-based malware to\ncapture payment card information from\ncompromised online retailers or their\nthird-party ecommerce platforms. The\ntechnique is often referred to as ‘digital\nskimming’ or ‘formjacking’ as the\nmalware grabs the data entered by a\nconsumer during the checkout process.\nUnlike POS malware, Magecart not only\ncaptures payment card information, but\nalso the billing address, CVV2 number,\nand (depending on the data required by\nthe retailer) email and phone number.\n\nMagecart is not a single entity but rather\nconsists of at least 30 different threat\nactors that possess varying levels of\nsophistication and employ different\nTTPs. The most prominent Magecart\nthreat actor is Magecart Group 5, which\nis associated with the compromise of a\nmajor ticket sales and distribution\ncompany, and specialises in targeting\nthird-party suppliers to compromise\n\n\n**Shoot to the stars (and the crypto)**\n\nContinuing on from their 2018 activity,\nNorth Korea-based threat actors Black\nArtemis and Black Banshee aggressively\npursued and mixed cyber espionage and\nfinancially motivated cyber criminal\nactivity.[44] In 2019, both threat actors had\na shared focus on the aerospace and\ndefence sectors from an espionage\nstandpoint, while also showing\nconsistent targeting of financial\ninstitutions and organisations in the\ncryptocurrency space.[45, 46, 47]\n\n###### Incumbent leaders in cyber crime: Old dogs, new tricks – Part 1\n\nSome of the most prominent criminal\nthreat actors have been active since the\nearly 2000s, often originally as\nsubordinate members or affiliates of\nnow-defunct groups. These groups used\nto be active on criminal forums, where\nthey recruited affiliates for their own\nenterprises or hired services from third\nparties. In 2019, the old guard were far\nless active in this respect, instead relying\non trusted relationships that they built up\nfrom years of successful cooperation.\n\nFinancial Services\n\nProfessional Services\n\nPower & Utilities\n\nOil & Gas\n\nRetail\n\nManufacturing\n\nTechnology &\nTelecommunications\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\n\nAlthough identified as an emerging\nphenomenon in 2018, 2019 has seen a\nclear convergence in some of the tools,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nemployed by a range of established\nthreat actors. Those previously focused\non point-of-sale (POS) systems in the\nretail and hospitality sector broadened\ntheir targeting to include online retailers\nand modified their toolsets as a\nconsequence. Similarly, while threat\nactors in control of high-profile\ncredential stealing malware, such as\nTrickBot and Dridex, continued to\nharvest financial data from consumers,\nthese threat actors increasingly used\nthose systems as a platform from which\nto launch targeted ransomware attacks\nagainst a range of corporate victims.\nHowever, targeted ransomware attacks\nwere also carried out by threat actors\nthat had previously been engaged\nexclusively with POS malware, possibly\nthrough cooperation with specialist\nransomware actors or by becoming\naffiliates of ransomware operations.\n\n\nHealthcare\n\nResearch & Development\n\nHospitality & Leisure\n\nEducation\n\nAerospace & Defence\n\nGovernment\n\nEntertainment & Media\n\n44 Cyber Threats 2018: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n###### The PwC Incident Response team responded to multiple cyber attacks targeting the sectors seen in the figure to the left and motivated by the causes seen in the figure to the right\n\n\n45 ‘A Month of Manuscrypt’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20190809-01A\n\n46 ‘A Black Banshee goes Wild(Command)’, PwC Threat Intelligence’, CTOTIB-20190509-02\n\n\n-----\n\nmultiple ecommerce operators.\nMagecart Group 6 targets ‘household\nname’ companies and was attributed to\nattacks on an international airline and a\nmajor consumer electronics retailer. In\nOctober 2019, reports revealed that\nMagecart Group 6 is likely linked to\nWhite Giant (a.k.a. FIN6), also\nresponsible for an attack on an\necommerce platform provider that put\nover 3,000 online retailers at risk.[48]\n\n**FINs can only get better?**\n\nFIN6, FIN7, and FIN8 are threat actors\nthat specialise in targeting the retail and\nhospitality sectors, with the primary\nobjective of harvesting payment card\ninformation from compromised\nnetworks. Their attacks involve either the\ndeployment of malware onto multiple\nPOS devices within a compromised\nnetwork or attacking the victim’s\npayment processing systems. While all\nthe threat actors share similar TTPs\n(spear-phishing attacks, living off the\nland, and penetration testing tools) they\nall have unique characteristics: FIN6 and\nFIN8 have their own bespoke POS\nmalware (FrameworkPOS and ShellTea\nrespectively) while FIN7 has developed\nand deployed a new range of tools in\n2019. In most of their attacks, the threat\nactors attempt to maintain persistence in\nthe compromised network for as long as\npossible in order to harvest payment\ncard information over an extended\nperiod. These intrusions can last for\nseveral months and in the past resulted\nin the compromise of hundreds of\nthousands, and in some high-profile\ncases, millions of payment cards.[49, 50]\nSuccessful POS malware attacks harvest\n\n\nthe data encoded on the magnetic stripe\nof a payment card when it is swiped\nthrough a card reader. This data, known as\na ‘dump’ by criminal actors, is sold on\nspecialist criminal vendor sites, the most\nprominent of which is Joker’s Stash.\n\nIn 2019, it was predicted that the cost of\ncounterfeit payment card fraud in the US\nwould drop in line with the growing use of\nEMV technology in the restaurant,\nhospitality and retail sectors.[51] Within\ncriminal forums, there was speculation that\nwider use of EMV in the US would disrupt\nthe market for dumps. However, both the\nprice and supply of dumps appears to\nhave been stable throughout 2019. In\nAugust 2019, Joker’s Stash announced the\nsale of 5.3 million dumps in what was\nadvertised as the Solar Energy Breach,\nalthough they were careful to release the\ndata in batches rather than flood the market\nwith all 5 million cards in one go. The data\nappeared to be harvested from a US\nretailer. In October 2019, Joker’s Stash\nadvertised a further 1.3 million dumps, this\ntime originating from India.[52, 53] In view of\ncontinued release and sale of dumps data,\nit is clear that the hoped-for decline in\nPOS malware operations did not\nmaterialise in 2019.\n\n###### Enter the stage: new players in the cyber criminal space\n\n**In a Silence way**\n\nThe financially motivated threat actor\nWhite Jackalope (a.k.a. Silence) has\nbeen active since mid-2016, and was\nfirst reported on in open source at the\nend of 2017.[54, 55] In 2018 and 2019, the\nactivity of the threat actor significantly\nincreased, as well as the scope of its\ntargeting.[56, 57] Originally focusing on the\nbanking sector in Russia, the threat actor\n\n\nexpanded its targeting to include Asia,\nand eventually the rest of Europe.\n\nWhite Jackalope has evolved its toolset\nover time, adjusting its initial downloaders\nand payloads to constantly evade\ndetection. Its ongoing campaign, being\nconducted across countries in Eastern\nEurope, uses a technique called 'ATM\njackpotting' – compromising ATM\nsystems in order to dispense cash at will,\nand relying on a network of money mules\nto physically move and launder the notes.\n\nThe cyber criminal threat actor achieved\nits aims through two alternative paths\nof intrusion:\n\n- Compromising the bank’s internal\nATM network (known as a card\nmanagement system) and enabling a\nwaiting money mule to physically\nwithdraw money using bank-issued\ncredit cards at the victim bank’s\nATMs; and\n\n- Compromising the card processing\nsystem to remove or alter the\nwithdrawal limit (usually USD 1,000)\nfor use in conjunction with stolen\ncards to yield the greatest amount\nper stolen card.\n\nIn July 2019, the threat actor reportedly\ncost a targeted bank a total of USD 3 million\nand leveraged a combination of physical\nand cyber aspects to enable the theft\nof money.[58]\n\nThe tactics of White Jackalope led us to\nassess that this cyber criminal threat\nactor is likely to be sophisticated and\ncontinue attempting to remain\nstealthy (excluding the activities of its\nmule operators).\n\n\n48 ‘FIN6 compromised ecommerce platform via Magecart to inject credit card skimmers into thousands of online shops’, TrendMicro, https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fin6-compromised-e-commerce-platform-via-magecart-to-inject-credit-card-skimmers-into-thousands-of-online-shops/ (9th October 2019)\n\n49 ‘Dissecting the activities and operations of FIN6 threat actor group’, cyware, https://cyware.com/news/dissecting-the-activities-and-operations-of-fin6-threat-actorgroup-ebc7df0a (13th April 2019)\n\n50 ‘HBC says data breach lasted up to 9 months’, CBC, https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hbc-saks-data-breach-1.4638249 (27th April 2018)\n\n51 ‘The future of US fraud in a post-EMV environment’, Retail Payments Risk Forum, June 2019, https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/rprf/publications/2019/06/23/future-of-us-fraud-in-post-emv-environment-king-doug.pdf\n\n52 ‘Breach at Hy-Vee supermarket chain tied to sale of 5M+ stolen credit, debit cards’, KrebsonSecurity, https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/hy-vee-breach/ (19th August 2019)\n\n53 ‘Joker’s Stash lists 1.3 million stolen Indian payment cards’, BankInfoSecurity, https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/jokers-stash-lists-13-million-indian-paymentcards-a-13302 (29th October 2019)\n\n54 ‘Silence – a new Trojan attacking financial organisations’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/the-silence/83009/ (1st November 2017)\n\n55 ‘Silence’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20171106-01B\n\n56 ‘Silence: Moving into the darkside’, Group-IB, September 2018, https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/silence_moving-into-the-darkside.pdf\n\n57 ‘Silence 2.0: Going Global’, Group-IB, August 2019, https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/silence_2.0.going_global.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Spotlight on TA505\n\nTA505 is a cyber criminal threat actor,\nactive since at least 2014, which first\ncame to prominence for large-scale\nmalicious spam operations primarily\ndelivering Dridex. Since then, the group\nhas been associated with numerous\nspam campaigns delivering a broad\nrange of malicious payloads, including\nthe banking trojans TrickBot and Shifu\nand the ransomware systems Locky and\nGlobeImposter.[59] In addition to providing\na delivery mechanism for other threat\nactors, TA505 is associated with the\ndevelopment and deployment of its own\nbespoke malware, including\nFlawedAmmyy and FlawedGrace.\n\n\nIn 2019, the threat actor redoubled its\nefforts, introducing multiple new tools\nand broadening its range of targets. In\nOctober 2019, the actor began deploying\na new modular malware system known\nas SDBot after introducing two new\ndownloaders: Andromut and Get2.[60] In\nNovember 2019, PwC identified a new\nhigh-volume TA505 campaign targeting a\nwide range of industry sectors and\nvictims,[61] which used several legitimate\nURL shortening services to direct\nvictims to fake landing pages. These\nwere used to host downloadable\nversions of the penetration testing\ntool Cobalt Strike as part of an initial\ninfection process.\n\n\n###### Spotlight on Cobalt Group\n\nThe Cobalt Group is a threat actor that\nhas specialised mainly in ATM attacks\nsince it first became active in 2016. Its\nname is derived from the legitimate\npenetration testing tool Cobalt Strike: the\nthreat actor was one of the first criminal\ngroups to adopt the use of this tool as\npart of its standard TTPs. Throughout\nthe year, the threat actor used a\ncombination of third-party tools,\nincluding Terraloader (also known as\nmore_eggs) and a malicious document\nbuilder for dropping and executing\nJavaScript. The most distinguishing\naspect of its operations was the\ncontinued use of its own bespoke\nmalware, CobInt. Cobalt campaigns were\nalmost continuous during 2019, with a\nvariety of phishing lures designed for\nattacking financial institutions. Many of\nthese were spoofed to appear to be from\nthe European Central Bank, while others\npurported to contain the outcome of\nlegal or financial arbitration decisions.\nBased on the language used for its\nphishing messages, Cobalt was mainly\ntargeting victims in Eastern Europe and\nCentral Asia, with a smaller number of\nattacks focused on Central America and\nthe Middle East.\n\n\n**ATM cashouts**\n\nThe first case of ATM jackpotting took place in Mexico in 2013,[62] where threat\nactors attached a new boot disk that installed malware on the ATMs. Attacks\nhave since become more sophisticated, with prominent campaigns including the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n- Since at least late 2016, Black\nArtemis has targeted banks in\nAfrica and Asia in order to gain\naccess to payment switch\napplication servers and enable\nfraudulent ATM cash withdrawals;[63]\n\n- In late 2018, Black Artemis\ncompromised the corporate\nnetwork of the Chilean ATM\ninterbank network – while the\n\n\norganisation claims the incident\nwas mitigated before any money\nwas stolen, it is likely the attack\nwas financially motivated;[64] and,\n\n- In 2019, reporting uncovered\nattacks against banks across Asia\nthat resulted in ATM jackpotting.\nThese are attributed to a criminal\nthreat actor, White Jackalope\n(a.k.a. Silence).[58]\n\n\n59 ‘Threat actor profile: TA505, from Dridex to GlobeImposter’, Proofpoint, https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridexglobeimposter (27th September 2017)\n\n60 ‘TA505 distributes new SDBbot remote access trojan with Get2 downloader’, Proofpoint, https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-distributes-newsdbbot-remote-access-trojan-get2-downloader (16th October 2019)\n\n61 ‘TA505 ups the ante with fake landing pages’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20191118-01A\n\n62 ‘Criminals hit the ATM jackpot’, Symantec, https://www.symantec.com/connect/blo gs/criminals-hit-atm-jackpot (11th October 2013)\n\n63 ‘HIDDEN COBRA – FASTCash campaign’, CISA, https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A (2nd October 2018)\n\n64 ‘One unified platform to run your entire business’, ZDNet, https://www.zdnet.com/article/north-korean-hackers-infiltrate-chiles-atm-network-after-skype-job-inter\n\n-----\n\n###### Diversification of revenue\n\n\n**Emotet resurgent**\n\nIn the first quarter of 2019, Emotet was\none of the most prolific malware delivery\nsystems, accounting for 60% of email\ntraffic containing malicious payloads\n(attachments and hyperlinks).[65] At the\nend of May 2019, Emotet suspended\noperations: its C2 network dropped\nconnections to infected hosts and spam\ncampaigns halted. On 22nd August 2019,\nEmotet’s C2 network reactivated and by\n9th September its C2 servers began\npushing out new binaries to infected\nhosts. Spam operations resumed on\n16th September and began pushing out\nnew spam campaigns almost daily.[66] The\nreliance of multiple threat actors on\ndelivery systems such as Emotet saw a\ncontinuation of a well-established trend:\nthe use of phishing techniques to deliver\nweaponised attachments that all but\nsupplanted the use of exploit kits as a\nmeans of introducing malware into\ntargeted networks.\n\nIn addition to its capacity to deliver high\nvolumes of broadcast spam, increasing\nuse was made of Emotet’s spearphishing capabilities in 2019. The\nmalware harvests the content of email\naccounts on infected hosts and can\ninsert messages into existing email\nthreads between the infected host and\nthird parties. It is likely that email thread\ninjection attacks are more effective than\nthe bulk delivery of unsolicited\nmessages: a recipient will be less\nsuspicious of an attachment in a\nmessage they were expecting to receive\nfrom a known contact. Both broadcast\nand spear-phishing techniques were\nused as a delivery system by a range of\nsophisticated cyber crime threat actors,\nincluding the Trickbot/Ryuk, Gozi/Ursnif\nand Qakbot groups. Emotet was also\nused less frequently for the delivery\nof Dridex.\n\n\n**Old dogs, new tricks – Part 2**\n\nAs with all leading credential-stealing\nmalware, systems like TrickBot, Dridex,\nUrsnif and Ramnit are modular in design\nand can tailor their functionality based\non customer requirements. This is\nespecially the case with inject codes\nused to capture bank and ecommerce\nlogin credentials from infected hosts. For\nexample, TrickBot variants delivered by\nan Emotet campaign targeting the UK\nare configured to download inject\nmodules crafted for a range of UK banks\nand other entities. But TrickBot can do\nmore than just capture banking\ncredentials: in late 2018 TrickBot added\na module to identify POS systems,\nenabling threat actors to conduct POS\nattacks similar to those employed by\nFIN6 and FIN7. As noted earlier in this\nreport, in 2019 it added a new inject\nmodule to support SIM-swapping\nattacks. And along with Dridex and\npossibly Qakbot, TrickBot was\nincreasingly used in targeted\nransomware attacks.\n\n**The DiabolicalTrinity: Emotet/**\n**TrickBot/Ryuk**\n\n2019 saw a succession of high-profile\nransomware attacks attributed to Ryuk.\nThe majority of these incidents involved\nan initial infection via Emotet that carried\nTrickBot as a secondary payload. The\nthreat actor used TrickBot’s worming\nand lateral movement modules in\ncombination with legitimate penetration\ntesting tools and living-off-the-land\ntechniques to spread through targeted\nnetworks, identify key infrastructure and\ninstall and execute Ryuk. In many cases,\nthe threat actors spent at least two\nweeks inside the victim network before\ndeploying Ryuk, mainly because the\npost-exploitation phase of the attack\ninvolved time-consuming, semi-manual\nprocesses. The impact of a Ryuk attack\nmeans that it was often difficult for\nincident responders to demonstrate that\n\n\ndata was exfiltrated prior to the\nactivation of the ransomware. However,\nas the primary delivery method for Ryuk\nis a combination of two powerful\ncredential stealers, which both\nautomatically harvest data, it is likely that\nsome degree of data exfiltration\noccurred prior to encryption.\n\n**Dridex and BitPaymer**\n\nAlthough Dridex threat actors used\nEmotet as a delivery mechanism in 2019,\nthey did not do so as frequently as\nTrickBot or Ursnif threat actors. They also\nused compromised websites as an\ninfection vector, inserting malicious\nJavaScript into vulnerable websites to\ndisplay a fake browser update. Clicking\non the update would activate the initial\nmalware insertion process. Dridex is\nalmost uniquely associated with its\nransomware counterpart, BitPaymer.\nAfter the initial Dridex installation process,\na BitPaymer incident follows the same\npattern described in an Emotet/TrickBot/\nRyuk attack. BitPaymer underwent an\nupgrade in 2019, and emerged with new\nnetwork enumeration capabilities in the\nmiddle of the year to improve the\nefficiency of attacks[67] – the upgrade\nincluded the use of the address resolution\nprotocol (arp) to identify devices on a\nvictim network to add a degree of\nautomation to the post-exploitation phase\nof a Dridex/BitPaymer incident.\n\n**Follow the cryptocurrency**\n\nThe diversification into ransomware\noperations was certainly one of the main\ncyber crime themes of 2019, but it would\nbe incorrect to assume Dridex or\nTrickBot threat actors abandoned\ncredential theft in favour of ransomware\noperations. Dridex and TrickBot were\noriginally designed as banking trojans,\nand along with other threat actors like\nthe Ramnit, Ursnif and Qakbot groups,\nthey still retain this capability and attacks\non online banking systems leveraged by\n\n\n65 ‘Latest Quarterly Threat Report – Q1 2019’, Proofpoint, 2019, https://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/threat-reports/latest-quarterly-threat-research\n\n66 ‘Analysis of a recent Emotet Trickbot campaign’ PwC Threat Intelligence CTO-TIB-20191011-01A\n\n\n-----\n\nthese groups continued throughout\n2019. But these ‘business-as-usual’\nactivities were overshadowed by the\nmedia attention focused on high-profile\nransomware attacks that resulted from\nTrickBot or Dridex infections.\n\nIn reality, many of the principal cyber\ncriminal threat actors operated affiliate\nprogrammes and leased access to their\nsystems on a fee-paying or profit-sharing\nbasis. In the case of TrickBot, it is likely\nthat only a small number of affiliates had\naccess to Ryuk and that the majority of\nTrickBot threat actors were focused on\ntraditional, credential-stealing activities.\nLikewise, only a subset of Dridex actors\nappeared to have access to BitPaymer.\nThe attraction of ransomware was\nalmost certainly due to its high return\non investment compared to online\nbanking attacks:\n\n- The majority of online banking\nattacks were detected before funds\nwere transferred;[68]\n\n\n\n- Even after funds were transferred to a\nbank account under criminal control\n(a mule account), in many cases the\nvictim’s bank was able to freeze the\ntransfer and prevent the criminals\nfrom withdrawing the funds;\n\n- A successful transfer of stolen money\nrequired careful coordination with the\nmule controllers and is labour intensive;\n\n- The threat actors must have paid\ncommission fees to the mule\ncontrollers and often received\nlittle more than 30-40% of the\nfunds transferred in a successful\nattack; and\n\n- Threat actors engaged in the transfer\nand laundering of stolen funds risked\ndetection and prosecution by law\nenforcement organisations.\n\nBy contrast, apart from the overheads\nassociated with managing malware\ninfrastructure, and membership fees for\nparticipating in an affiliate programme,\nransomware threat actors got to keep\n\n\nthe majority of the funds generated from\nsuccessful attacks, and incurred lower\ncommission fees when they convert\ncryptocurrency into fiat currency.\n\nOther threat actors, such as FIN6 and\nFIN7, comprehensively demonstrated\ntheir ability to infiltrate and compromise\ncorporate networks. They mostly did so\nfor the purpose of deploying POS\nmalware, which by necessity restricts\ntheir range of available targets. Their\nbusiness model is not fully understood,\nespecially the share of the profits they\nmake from the sale of compromised\npayment card information. While there is\nisolated reporting that FIN6 was involved\nin LockerGoga and possibly Ryuk\nincidents in early 2019,[69] PwC is not\naware that they did so in the second half\nof the year. However, PwC assesses that\nthreat actors such as FIN6 have the\ntechnical capability to conduct further\nransomware attacks if they choose.\n\n\n68 ‘Fraud the facts 2019’, UK Finance, 2019, https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-publications/fraud-facts-2019\n\n69 ‘Pick-Six: Intercepting a FIN6 intrusion an actor recently tied to Ryuk and LockerGoga ransomware’ FireEye https://www fireeye com/blog/threat-re\n\n-----\n\n**Case study – BitPaymer strikes**\n**professional services**\n\nIn November 2019, the Spanish\nprofessional services company\nEveris was the victim of a\nransomware attack.[75] Initially, there\nwas widespread media speculation\nthat the victim had been targeted by\nRyuk – this was partly because\nmultiple Ryuk incidents were\nunderway at the time of the attack,\nbut also possibly because Ryuk had\ngained such notoriety in the\npreceding months that it had\nbecome almost synonymous with\nransomware. In reality, the incident\nwas the result of a BitPaymer attack\nthat had been leveraged through a\nconventional Dridex campaign.\n\n\n**Resident Evil: The indictment of**\n**Maksim Yakubets**\n\nFrom a crime perspective, the highlight\nof 2019 was the high-profile indictment\nof members of the Dridex group,\nself-styled as ‘Evil Corp’. Maksim\nYakubets, also known by his online\nidentity Aqua, and Igor Turashev, a\nsenior member of the group known\nonline as Nintutu, were both indicted by\nthe US Department of Justice on\n5th December 2019. Other members of\nthe group were named (but not indicted)\nincluding Denis Gusev, whose businesses\nwere subject to US sanctions imposed\nby the US Treasury Department. The\nindictments were the result of years of\nwork by the FBI and the UK’s National\nCrime Agency (NCA), with the latter\nrevealing details of the group’s lavish\nlifestyle. A significant part of the Dridex\nsaga was the revelation that Yakubets\nhad also been working on behalf of the\nFederal Security Service (FSB)[70, 71] since\n2017, in addition to his purely criminal\noperations. This appears to be the mirror\nimage of state actors either officially or\nunofficially conducting financially\nmotivated attacks: a long-established\ncriminal actor carrying out undisclosed\nactivities on behalf of the state.[72]\n\n**Ransomware threat intensifies in 2019**\n\nThe last 12 months have seen a\nsuccession of high-profile ransomware\nattacks affecting a broad range of\nvictims and sectors. In 2018, there was a\nnotable change in threat actor behaviour,\nwith an emphasis on targeted attacks in\npreference to the large-scale distribution\nof ransomware. In 2019, this trend for\n‘big game hunting’ became firmly\nestablished with an increase in the\nintensity and frequency of attacks, the\n\n\narrival of new ransomware threat actors\nand the deployment of ransomware by\nestablished crime groups that previously\nspecialised in other types of attack.\nBusinesses in the manufacturing, oil and\ngas, professional services, healthcare\nand logistics sectors were all prominent\nvictims in 2019. Local government and\nthe education sector were also hit hard,\nwith the latter experiencing highly\ndamaging attacks timed to coincide with\nthe reopening of schools and colleges\nin September 2019.\n\nOne threat actor known as GandCrab,\nwhich ran an affiliate-based,\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nplatform, announced its ‘retirement’ and\nceased operations in June 2019.\nHowever, a new ransomware strain\nknown as Sodinokibi or REvil emerged\nsoon afterwards, and given the coding\nsimilarities between the two malware\nfamilies it is likely that Sodinokibi was\nlittle more than a rebranding exercise by\nthe GandCrab threat actor and the\n‘retirement’ was merely a smokescreen.[73]\nSodinokibi attacks increased in tempo\nduring the fourth quarter of 2019, with a\nnumber of high profile incidents reported\nin the last few weeks of the year.\n\n\n**Case study – Lockergoga**\n\nLockerGoga ransomware struck\nvictim organisations of all sizes\nacross multiple continents and\nindustries, yet, in early 2019, a\nLockerGoga campaign appeared to\nintentionally target organisations in\nthe manufacturing sector. Norsk\nHydro, one of the largest aluminium\nand renewable energy companies,\nhad systems across 40 countries\ninfected with LockerGoga malware.\nTo carry out this targeted attack, the\nthreat actor likely compromised and\nstudied Norsk Hydro’s internal IT\narchitecture prior to deploying the\nransomware. Norsk Hydro was\nforced to resort to manual\noperations as a result, and the\noperational downtime and mitigation\nefforts cost the company more than\nGBP 47 million in losses.[74]\n\n\n70 ‘Russian contractor document leak’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20190812-01A\n\n71 ‘Hackers breach FSB contractor, expose Tor deanonymization project and more’, ZDNet, https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-breach-fsb-contractor-exposetordeanonymization-project/ (20th July 2019)\n\n72 ‘Russian national charged with decade-long series of hacking and bank fraud offenses resulting in tens of millions in losses and second Russian national charged\nwith involvement in deployment of ‘Bugat’ malware’, Department of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hackingand-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens (5th December 2019)\n\n73 ‘Notorious GandCrab hacker group returns from retirement’, BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49817764 (24th September 2019)\n\n74 ‘Norsk Hydro reveals initial cyber insurance payout’, Insurance Business UK, https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/uk/news/cyber/norsk-hydroreveals-initialb i t 189461 (24th O t b 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The PwC Threat Intelligence team issued 221 intelligence reports in 2019 covering a range of sectors and threat actor locations, as seen below.\n\nGovernment\n\nFinancial Services\n\nAerospace & Defence\n\nTechnology\n\nEducation\n\nCharity/NGO\n\nTelecommunications\n\nChina-based\n\nHealthcare\n\nRussia-based\n\nReligious Organisation\n\nIran-based\n\nPower & Utilities Unknown/Awaiting\n\nclassification\n\nOil & Gas\n\n**Location of** Pakistan-based\n\nHospitality & Leisure **threat actor**\n\nCross border/\nmultiple regions\n\nProfessional Services\n\nIndia-based\n\nEntertainment & Media\n\nTurkey-based\n\nRetail Syria-based\n\nTransport & Logistics South Korea-based\n\nConsumer Markets\n\nHealthcare\n\n|Locat threat|ion of actor|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Looming larger: distributed denial of service attacks keep growing\n\n\nThroughout 2019, distributed denial of\nservice (DDoS) attacks remained a\nsteady trend in the background of other\ncyber operations. DDoS attacks rose to\nprominence many years earlier as one of\nthe preferred tools in the arsenal of\nhacktivist threat actors as a means to\nconduct disruptive action. This was\npartly due to the relatively low barrier to\nentry for conducting such attacks, and\nthe highly visible nature of their impact\n(i.e. knocking a website or service offline\nfor a period of time).\n\nAs organisations have moved to protect\nthemselves from DDoS attacks, threat\nactors increasingly sought to launch\nfewer but more targeted attacks and\ndeveloped novel techniques to amplify\nattacks and overcome DDoS mitigations.\nFurthermore, with the proliferation of\nconnected devices and the growth of the\nInternet of Things (IoT), more and more\nexploitation paths and malware families\nhave emerged to compromise these\ndevices and enslave them into botnets.\nAn example from 2019 includes a\nmulti-stage infection chain delivering a\nBillGates malware variant, which was\nused to hijack non-updated versions of\nElasticsearch databases and coerce\ntheir host systems into botnet activity.[76]\nJust as the creation of these large-scale\nbotnet networks in turn facilitated\nlarger-scale DDoS attacks, the cyber\ncriminal ecosystem also turned to\nDDoS-as-a-Service and DDoS-for-hire\nofferings to monetise botnet creation.\n\n\nMany DDoS-for-hire services are\nadvertised on the darkweb as stresser\nservices. Typically, they purport to be\nlegitimate services for network\nadministrators, providing a resource to\ntest the resilience of a network to a\nDDoS attack. Pricing for stresser\nservices varies according to duration of\nattacks, with ‘reputable’ services offering\nattacks for USD 10 per hour.[77] Despite\nprominent law enforcement operations\nagainst stresser sites, in 2019 they\ncontinued to persist and were frequently\nadvertised within online gaming\ncommunities. The attack capabilities of\nthese services varied, and it is likely that\nin many cases their advertised capability\nwas exaggerated. Academic research\nsuggests that the commissioning of\nDDoS attacks by juveniles within the\nonline gaming community served as an\nentry-level cyber crime and some cases\nled to other cyber offending.[78]\n\n**Ransom DDoS**\n\nIn 2019, cyber criminal threat actors\ncontinued targeting businesses with\nDDoS attacks – even attempting to extort\nvictims for financial gain to refrain from, or\ncease, targeted DDoS attacks. In some\ncases, threat actors will send victims a\nransom note demanding payment even\nbefore an actual attack is performed,\npromising a ‘small attack’ as a tester to\nthreaten victims and coerce them into\npaying attackers to deter them from\nlaunching an actual DDoS attack. In one\nexample, a financially motivated threat\nactor posed as Russia-based espionage\nthreat actor Blue Athena (a.k.a. Fancy\nBear),[79] to appear more intimidating to\n\n\nvictims given Blue Athena’s reputation.\nThe threat actor indicated the time when\nit would start a prospective DDoS against\nthe victim, and requested payment of\naround USD 15,000 in Bitcoin to desist\nfrom the attack.\n\nIn other cases, threat actors directly\nattacked victims with DDoS attacks, only\nto then send ransom requests.\nSouth African financial institutions were\none of the primary targets for such\nattacks in the last quarter of 2019,[80]\nleading the South African Banking Risk\nInformation Centre (SABRIC) to issue an\nadvisory on the matter. Reportedly, the\nattacks mainly affected the banks’\ncustomer-facing services rather than\ninternal operations. Although these\nattacks did not cause material impact,\nthe danger posed by DDoS attacks to\nsectors heavily relying on web portals\n– finance and retail, for instance –\nremains significant.\n\n**Hacktivists strike back**\n\nAs organisations continued to improve\ntheir cyber defences, and law\nenforcement increasingly cracked down\non individuals and collectives\nresponsible for computer misuse,\nhacktivist activity has relatively\nsubsided. However, in April 2019,\nEcuador came temporarily under siege,\nas DDoS attacks were directed at\nwebsites including those of Ecuador’s\nForeign Ministry, Presidential office, and\nCentral bank.[81] The attacks against\nEcuadorian internet infrastructure\nallegedly came in retaliation against the\nEcuadorian government’s decision to\n\n\n76 ‘Multistage Attack Delivers BillGates/Setag Backdoor, Can Turn Elasticsearch Databases into DDoS Botnet ‘Zombies’', TrendMicro, https://blog.trendmicro.com/\ntrendlabs-security-intelligence/multistage-attack-delivers-billgates-setag-backdoor-can-turn-elasticsearch-databases-into-ddosbotnet-zombies/ (23rd July 2019)\n\n77 ‘Hire a DDoS Service to Take Down Your Enemies’, CSO Online, https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180246/hire-a-ddos-service-to-take-down-your-enemies.html\n(15th March 2017)\n\n78 ‘Exploring the provision of online booter services’, 2015, https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/252340/Hutchings%20&%20Clayton%20\n2015%20Deviant%20Behavior.pdf\n\n79 ‘A DDoS Gang is extorting businesses posing as Russian government hackers’, ZDNet, https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-ddos-gang-is-extorting-businesses-posing-as-russian-government-hackers/ (24th October 2019)\n\n80 ‘Sustained DDoS Attack on South African Banks Accompanied by Ransom Notes’, CPO Magazine, https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/sustained-ddosattack-on-south-african-banks-accompanied-by-ransom-notes/ (4th November 2019)\n\n81 ‘Free Julian Assange or ‘CHAOS IS COMING!’ Anonymous warns as they threaten crime agency’, Express, https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1114863/julian\n\n-----\n\nstop supporting Julian Assange, who\nhad remained in asylum in the\nEcuadorian Embassy in London since\n2012. In April 2019, Assange was\nexpelled from the embassy and arrested\nby British authorities. Following this,\nthreat actors self-identifying as Grey\nAres – the loosely-tied hacker syndicate\ncollectively known as Anonymous –\nlaunched a DDoS attack against the\nNCA, causing intermittent minimal\ndowntime to the NCA’s website.\n\nThe operations of hacktivist threat actors\nlike Grey Ares can be unpredictable,\ngiven that the rationale with which they\npick their targets may not always, like in\nthe case above, be immediately\napparent. Hacktivist activity involving\nDDoS can cause disruption when\nexecuted at scale but PwC, as well as\nnumerous independent studies, observe\nthat such operations are becoming rarer\nwith time[82, 83] – and that effective\npreparation can help fend off such\nattacks.\n\n\n**No news good news: DDoS silencing**\n\nThe ability of DDoS attacks to\noverwhelm web servers and take internet\ninfrastructure offline makes it an\neffective, if temporary, means to disrupt\ninformation sources. In late October\n2019, Georgia was the target of a wave\nof cyber attacks bringing excessive\ntraffic to servers and effectively knocking\noffline about 2,000 websites as well as\nthe national TV station.[84] While\nthousands of web pages including that\nof the Georgian President were defaced\nwith warnings of other future cyber\nattacks, two TV broadcasters were sent\noffline, with one reportedly having\nequipment damaged as a consequence\nof the attacks. Georgia had already been\na victim of various DDoS attacks during\nthe Russian-Georgian war, including\nDDoS attacks directed at the South\nOssetian government.\n\nIn September 2019, online encyclopedia\nWikipedia was also targeted by a\nlarge-volume DDoS attack that lasted\naround nine hours,[85, 86] causing\ndowntime across Europe, Africa, and the\nMiddle East as well as slower connection\nin the US and Asia. The Wikimedia\nFoundation characterised the incident as\na ‘malicious attack’ by ‘a bad faith actor’.\n\n\nEarlier in 2019, numerous Philippine\nalternative media outlets had also come\nunder sustained DDoS attacks that\nrepeatedly knocked the websites offline\nand made them temporarily inaccessible\nby visitors as well as administrators.[87]\nThe National Union of Journalists of the\nPhilippines (NUJP) was also targeted\nnumerous times. The DDoS attacks on\nthese media outlets took place around\nthe same time, between December 2018\nand February 2019, in the period of the\n2019 midterm elections. According to a\nforensic investigation, the DDoS\nattacks were performed using a botnetfor-hire service.[88]\n\nAs organisations increasingly adopt\nDDoS mitigation solutions, the scale of\nDDoS attacks will continue to grow as\nthreat actors find new amplification\ntechniques. Threat actors seeking to\nlaunch DDoS attacks are also\nincreasingly reliant on larger botnets to\nbe able to impart significant downtime\non victims. This, in turn, is fuelling\ndemand in the cyber criminal\nmarketplace, leading to continued\nactivity aimed at amassing bots for\nmalicious purposes.\n\n\n82 ‘Return to Normalcy: False Flags and the Decline of International Hacktivism’, Recorded Future, 21st August 2019, https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/\ncta-2019-0821.pdf\n\n83 ‘The Decline of Hacktivism: Attacks Drop 95 Percent Since 2015’, Security Intelligence, https://securityintelligence.com/posts/the-decline-of-hacktivism-attacks-drop-95-percent-since-2015/ (16th May 2019)\n\n84 ‘Georgia hit by massive cyber-attack’, BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50207192 (28th October 2019)\n\n85 ‘Malicious attack on Wikipedia—What we know, and what we’re doing’, Wikimedia Foundation, https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2019/09/07/maliciousattack-on-wikipedia-what-we-know-and-what-were-doing/ (7th September 2019)\n\n86 ‘Analysing the Wikipedia DDoS attack’, ThousandEyes: Alex Henthorne-Iwane, https://blog.thousandeyes.com/analyzing-the-wikipedia-ddos-attack/\n(9th September 2019)\n\n87 ‘STATEMENT: DDoS attacks on NUJP, alternative media continue’, National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, Minda News, https://www.mindanews.com/\nstatements/2019/02/statement-ddos-attacks-on-nujp-alternative-media-continue/ (11th February 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Sowing chaos\n\n Shamoon arisen\n\nSabotage attacks rose to prominence in\n2011, with the infamous campaign\ntargeting Iran’s nuclear programme using\ndestructive malware, dubbed Stuxnet.\nSince then, the use of destructive\nmalware has evolved to no longer be\nentirely motivated by sabotage.\n\nStoneDrill is a sophisticated wiper used\npredominantly to cause destruction to\nthe oil and gas sector in the Middle East,\nhowever, StoneDrill also contains\nespionage tools in its arsenal indicating\nthe destructive malware serves multiple\npurposes. StoneDrill is attributed in open\nsource to Yellow Orc (a.k.a. APT33 or\nElfin),[89] an Iran-based threat actor that\nhas been known to target a wide range\nof sectors. Recent StoneDrill activity\ncould be linked to a statement by the US\nCyber Security and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) from June 2019,\nwhich reported a rise in malicious cyber\nsecurity activity directed at US industries\nand government agencies by Iran-based\nthreat actors – in particular an increase\nin destructive wiper attacks.[90]\n\nTraditional destructive attacks purely\nseeking to cause destruction still occur.\nFirst observed in 2012, when it wiped the\nsystems of a state-owned oil producer in\nthe Middle East, Shamoon was used to\nrepeatedly target Saudi Arabia and its\n\n\ncritical sectors, causing major data and\nfinancial losses and disruption. In\nDecember 2018, a third wave of\nShamoon attacks targeted Italian oil and\ngas contractor Saipem, as well as two\nsimilar organisations from Saudi Arabia\nand the UAE.\n\nShamoon malware is inherently\ndestructive, wiping data on victim\nsystems and impeding their reboot. It\nconsists of a tripartite structure, with its\ndropper, wiper, and reporter functionality\ncontained in three different implants.\n10% of Saipem’s systems were infected,\nthe vast majority of which were located\nin the Middle East.\n\nIn late 2019, researchers identified a new\nwiper malware family called ZeroCleare\nin open-source reporting. Similarly to\nShamoon, ZeroCleare was deployed\nagainst targets in the Middle East, and\nexploited a specific unsigned system\ndriver to load wiper code on victim\nsystems.[91]\n\n###### Information operations\n\nInformation operations – i.e. attempts to\n‘influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the\ndecision making of adversaries and\npotential adversaries while protecting\n\n[its] own’[92] – rose to prominence in 2016\nwith the infamous case of Russia-based\nthreat actors accused of meddling in the\n\n\n2016 US presidential election. Election\ninterference via information operations is\nnow a well-documented phenomena,\nhowever, 2019 highlighted the use of\ninformation operations for other\nnefarious activities.\n\nResearch from 2019 identified 53 cases\nof foreign influence efforts (FIEs)[93] –\ncoordinated campaigns by one state to\nimpact politics in another state through\nmedia channels – in 24 victim countries\nfrom 2013 to 2018.[94] Two of the cases\nwere ongoing as of April 2019. In total,\n72% of the campaigns were conducted\nby threat actors based in Russia, with\nthreat actors based in China and Iran\naccounting for most of the remainder.\n\nWhile many of the cases sought to shape\nelection outcomes, others focused on\ndiscrediting specific political actors,\nsuch as a campaign targeting the Syrian\nCivil Defence Force. In other campaigns,\nthreat actors attempted to shift the\npolitical agenda on specific topics, such\nas from health to security. The proposal\nof the extradition bill sparked protests in\nHong Kong, and disinformation was\nused in support of both the protestors\nand the police.[95] Finally, campaigns\nencouraged political polarisation –\nRussia-based threat actors\nsimultaneously supported the Black\nLives Matter and the White Lives Matter\ncounter-movements. Within Australian,\nBrazilian, Candian, and South African\npolitics, Russia-based threat actors\nattempted to polarise the debate.\n\n\n89 ‘Elfin: Relentless espionage group targets multiple organisations in Saudi Arabia and US’, Symantec, https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfinapt33-espionage (27th March 2019)\n\n90 ‘US government warns of data wipers used in Iranian cyberattacks’, Bleeping Computer, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-government-warnsof-data-wipers-used-in-iranian-cyberattacks/ (22nd June 2019)\n\n91 'New Destructive Wiper 'ZeroCleare' Targets Energy Sector in the Middle East’, IBM Security, https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OAJ4VZNJ (December 2019)\n\n92 ‘Information operations: Joint Publication 3-13’, US Department of Defense, November 2014, https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_13.pdf\n\n93 ‘ Managing and mitigating foreign election interference’, Lawfare, https://www.lawfareblog.com/managing-and-mitigating-foreign-election-interference (21st July 2019)\n\n94 In addition, the research identified 40 purely domestic online influence campaigns, in which state actors targeted their own populations in ways designed to mask\ngovernment involvement.\n\n95 ‘Chinese covert social media propaganda and disinformation related to Hong Kong’, The Jamestown Foundation, https://jamestown.org/program/chinese-covertsocial-media-propaganda-and-disinformation-related-to-hong-kong/ (6th September 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\nA leak of apparent FSB contractor\ndocuments made the headlines in July\n2019,[96, 97] after a hacktivist group leaked\na cache of data pertaining to be from the\ninternal networks of Moscow-based\ncompany SyTech. Whilst the documents\nprovide interesting insight into the type\nof research being conducted – including\ninto Tor deanonymisation, social media\ntracking and email monitoring – it is\nimportant to bear in mind that the cache\nremains unverified and the authenticity\nof the documents therefore\nquestionable. The motivation behind this\nattack is unknown, however, PwC has\nseen similar hack and leak operations\nattempting to further the threat actor’s\ncause, as seen in the following example.\n\n\nIn June 2019, information on tools and\ninfrastructure attributed to Iran-based\nthreat actor, Yellow Maero, were\nexposed in a series of leaks.[98] PwC\nassesses it highly likely that this activity\nforms part of an information operation\nseeking to disrupt Iran’s espionage\noperations. By promoting the narrative\nthat the Ministry of Intelligence of the\nIslamic Republic of Iran (MOIS) is\nsinister and betraying the Iranian people,\nthe threat actor is likely attempting to\nsow discord within Iran’s domestic\npopulation.\n\n\n**Case study – Document leak** **Case study – Oil(Rig) leaks expose an**\n\nA leak of apparent FSB contractor **information operation**\ndocuments made the headlines in July In June 2019, information on tools and\n\n[96, 97]\n\n\n96 'Russian contractor document leak', PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20190812-01A\n\n97 ‘Hackers breach FSB contractor, expose Tor deanonymization project and more’, ZDNet, https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-breach-fsb-contractor-exposetordeanonymization-project/ (20th July 2019)\n\n98 ‘A mystery agent is doxing Iran’s hackers and dumping their code’, Wired, https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-oilrig-read-my-lips/ (18th April 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Shattering the mirror maze of information operations\n\n\nIn 2016, Russia-based threat actors were\naccused of interfering in the US\npresidential election, highlighting how\nsocial media can be exploited to\npromote a political agenda, sow discord,\nand incite polarisation. Meanwhile, in\nother cases, information operations\naimed to undermine the objective\nassessment of evidence, providing\nmultiple ‘alternative narratives’ or\npromoting falsehoods. In the fallout of\n2016, social media companies vowed to\nstep up to identify and combat\ndisinformation on their platforms. The\nsame research that identified 53 cases\nof foreign influence efforts also\nconcluded that the information\noperations’ preferred social media\nplatforms were Twitter and Facebook,\nlikely due to the scale of their reach.[99, 100]\n\nIn 2019, Facebook alongside Twitter and\nGoogle continued disabling accounts\nassociated with information operations\nfrom around the world. Overall, they\ndisclosed 51 campaigns through 2019,\nfrom threat actors based in at least 28\ncountries and targeting more than 68\ncountries around the world.\n\nIn addition to social media platforms,\ncountries around the world are making\nchanges to protect against information\noperations. In May 2019, the European\nUnion adopted a new sanctions regime\nthat would impose penalties on\nindividuals, companies, and government\norganisations that are involved in cyber\nattacks.[101] The new regime came into\neffect ahead of the European Union\nparliament elections, as both a deterrent\nand a response.\n\n\n## 51\n###### campaigns\n\n\n###### Targeting at least \n## 68\n###### different countries around the world\n\n\n###### From threat actors based in at least \n## 28\n###### different countries\n\n\n99 83% of the information operations used Twitter, and 50% used Facebook.\n\n100 'Managing and mitigating foreign election interference’, Lawfare, https://www.lawfareblog.com/managing-and-mitigating-foreign-election-interference (21st July 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The following accounts, pages, groups, channels, events, and blogs were suspended for being associated with information operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nIn 2019, PwC analysts witnessed and\ndocumented a convergence of the\nphysical and cyber domains, as\ncampaigns continued to align, in\ntargeting and aims, with international\nrelations. Mirroring this association, in\nphishing campaigns in particular, threat\nactors often delivered timely and relevant\nmalicious lure documents to victims in\norder to infect them, with short\nturnaround periods between a piece of\nnews being published and its\nweaponisation in malicious operations.\nPwC observed tit-for-tat operations\nalongside longer-term intelligence\ncollection efforts, threat actors’\noverlapping interests turn into cases of\nfourth-party collection, as well as an\nincreasing focus on surveillance by\nespionage motivated threat actors.\n\n\nEspecially – though not exclusively – in\nrelation to surveillance and information\ncollection, one of the defining trends of\n2019 was the growing attention threat\nactors afforded to mobile devices. PwC\nsaw multiple cyber criminal and\nespionage threat actors either using\nexploits to directly compromise mobile\ndevices, or socially engineering victims\ninto installing malicious applications on\ntheir mobile phones. In many cases,\nPwC observed mobile malware used to\ntarget specific demographics, groups, or\neven individuals.\n\nSupply chains continued to be a key\ntargeting focus, with sophisticated threat\nactors (and especially China-based\nthreat actors) going after third parties or\nacquired companies, or even trusted\nsoftware providers, in order to reach\norganisations and their customers –\nexploiting the trust and privileged access\nafforded to third-party suppliers.\n\n\nIn 2019, PwC saw evidence suggesting\nthat certain threat actors, long\nconsidered to be espionage motivated\nand with objectives aligned to national\ninterests, have duplicated and divided\ntheir efforts to also perform cyber\ncriminal activities.\n\nWhile PwC saw new threat actors rise to\nprominence in the cyber criminal space,\nthe cyber criminal market effectively\nconsolidated around large, established\nplayers that maintained, managed, and\nupdated some of the largest cyber\ncriminal operations. Many of the\nprincipal cyber criminal threat actors\n– the likes of Emotet, Dridex, as well as\nFIN threat actors – operated affiliate\nprogrammes and leased access to\ntheir systems on a fee-paying or\nprofit-sharing basis.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven in the financially motivated cyber\ncrime space, PwC observed a solid\ncontinuation of 2018 trends, including\nformjacking, Magecart skimmers, theft\nof banking credentials and POS\nmalware. Yet the diversification into\nransomware operations was one of the\nmain cyber crime themes of 2019. The\nlast 12 months, continuing from a trend\nestablished in 2018, have seen a\nsuccession of high profile ransomware\nattacks affecting a broad range of\nvictims and sectors. More and more, the\naffiliate programmes mentioned above\nalso see ‘stable’ relationships between\nspecific spam operations and\nransomware actors – for example the\ntriad Emotet – TrickBot – Ryuk.\n\n\nIn terms of sabotage attacks, throughout\n2019, DDoS attacks remained a steady\ntrend in the background of other cyber\noperations. With the proliferation of\nconnected devices and the growth of the\nIoT, more and more exploitation paths\nand malware families are emerging to\ncompromise these devices and enslave\nthem into botnets.\n\nNevertheless, sabotage operations\nleveraging malware are increasingly\ntaking on destructive objectives. In 2019,\nwiper and destructive malware have\ncontinued posing a threat to\norganisations – specifically in the Middle\nEast and United States – between\nDecember 2018’s third wave of Shamoon\nattacks and destructive activity\nusing ZeroCleare malware in late\nDecember 2019.\n\n\nYet also in 2019, sabotage operations\nexhibited a more subtle, treacherous\nside that has been on the rise for\nthe past few years: that of causing\ndisruption through information\noperations. For example, election\ninterference via information operations is\nnow a well-documented phenomena,\nand in 2019 social media companies\nhave moved to tackle increasing\n‘inauthentic coordinated behaviour’ on\ntheir platforms. In the future, PwC\nassesses it highly likely that novel\ndetection techniques will be required to\nbuild confidence assessments on\nmedia integrity.\n\n\n###### Now at the beginning of 2020, PwC has already seen new aggressive intelligence collection campaigns unfold, all while financially motivated threat actors continue using tried and tested, as well as novel techniques, to exact profit from victims. PwC assesses that this will continue throughout 2020 as cyber espionage and sabotage continue to align with international dynamics\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PwC Cyber Security\n\n\nIf you would like more information on any\nof the threats discussed in this report\nplease feel free to get in touch at\n**threatintelligence@uk.pwc.com.**\n\nPwC is globally recognised by industry\nanalysts as a leader in cyber security\nand as a firm with strong global delivery\ncapabilities and the ability to address\nthe security and risk challenges our\nclients face.\n\nWe underpin our board-level security\nstrategy and advisory consulting\nservices with expertise gleaned from the\nfront lines of cyber defence across our\nniche technical expertise in services\nsuch as red teaming, incident response\nand threat intelligence.\n\n\nWe differentiate ourselves with our ability\nto combine strategic thinking, strong\ntechnical capabilities and complex\nengagement delivery with client service\nexcellence.

It involves a multi-stage, script-based delivery and execution chain\nwhich refers back to the C2 throughout, and it also sets persistence on victim\nsystems and results in a backdoor payload being installed on infected systems.\n\n**BitPaymer** A ransomware family almost always delivered in conjunction with a Dridex\ninfection. BitPaymer, which embeds numerous anti-analysis and UAC bypass\ntechniques, often has individual samples and ransom notes tailored to specific\nvictim environments.\n\n**Business Email Compromise (BEC)** A BEC attack involves a threat actor hijacking or closely imitating a legitimate email\naccount in order to more effectively socially engineer individuals.\n\n**Cobalt Strike** Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool, that is marketed as 'adversary\nsimulation software designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate the postexploitation actions of advanced threat actors'. Despite its legitimate purposes,\nCobaltStrike's fully-featured module suite is often used by malicious threat actors\n(including advanced persistent threats) in their operations.\n\n**Code injection** The malicious introduction of code into a running process, to achieve execution of\nmalicious actions without any input validation from the system.\n\n**CrimsonRAT** A C#/.Net backdoor implant thought to be unique to Green Havildar, capable of a\nseries of functions including logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and taking\nscreenshots from infected systems.\n\n**DNS hijacking** An attack that maliciously alters the correct resolution of queries to the Domain\nName System (DNS). Such an attack can lead users to unknowingly be redirected to\nthreat actor-controlled sites, creating the opportunity for traffic interception and\ninstallation of malware.\n\n**DragonMessenger** A malicious Android application attributed to Black Shoggoth and added to Google\nPlay in October 2019 according to third-party research. It was allegedly distributed\nvia a WordPress website posing as a fundraising service for supporting North\nKorean defectors, targeting that same demographic for espionage purposes.\n\n**Dridex** A banking trojan active since at least 2014, delivered via spearphishing emails,\nDridex was used to steal banking credentials and to drop ransomware on victim\nsystems. Despite a takedown in 2015, and the 2019 FBI indictment of one of the\nindividuals behind the management of the malware, Dridex continues operations and\nremains a substantial threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Term Definition\n\n\n**DTrack**\n\n**Dumps**\n\n**Emotet**\n\n**Formjacking**\n\n**GermanWiper**\n\n**GlobeImposter**\n\n**Hooking**\n\n**Incident response**\n\n**Information operations**\n\n**Joker’s Stash**\n\n\nDTrack is a RAT that we assess has likely been used by Black Artemis since at least\n2014. It has been used against numerous targets worldwide, including banks and the\nKundankulam Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nStolen credit card information – specifically, the raw information stored on a card’s\nmagnetic strip. Dumps are mostly collected through skimming of point of sale\nterminals. Criminals may cash out ‘dumps’ by embedding them into a fake credit\ncard and physically making a purchase in a store – a process known as ‘carding’.\n\nEmotet was developed off the Bugat/Cridex/Feodo malware family, and was first\nobserved in 2014 as a banking trojan. Although it retains credential-stealing\ncapabilities, Emotet has been converted into a malware delivery system focused on\ngaining an initial foothold on victim machines, and is used by a range of\nsophisticated cyber crime threat actors. PwC assesses it is highly likely that Emotet\nis run on an affiliate model, whereby Emotet administrators form a core group with\nmultiple affiliates that include Trickbot, Dridex, and IcedID.\n\nAlso known as ‘digital skimming’, formjacking involves the surreptitious injection of\nmalicious JavaScript code into the checkout pages of legitimate websites, to enable\nthe theft of credit card information and other data (such as billing addresses) from\npayment forms.\n\nA ransomware variant highly likely linked to another mature ransomware family\nknown as Sodinokibi, based on overlaps in targeting and infrastructure. In a\ncampaign in the summer of 2019, spear-phishing emails targeted German speakers,\nclaiming to be from an individual reaching out to a prospective employer seeking a\nnew professional challenge, with a zip embedding a malicious LNK file.\n\nThe second most prevalent ransomware family in 2017, GlobeImposter variants\nabused spear-phishing, exploit kits and RDP bruteforce to gain access to networks\nand encrypt system files. Recently, we observed GlobeImposter not completely\nencrypt files, leaving some sections legible, to make file encryption faster (and thus\nharder to stop).\n\nAny technique that alters the behaviour of the operating system (OS) or any program\nby intercepting a program’s execution at a particular point to take another action.\nHooking can enable malware to establish persistence, or to load additional malicious\ncode within another process.\n\nThe organised process of investigating, addressing, and mitigating a cyber security\nincident or cyber attack. Incident response often involves pre-incident planning, and\nties in with other critical business functions, ensuring that an organisation can\ncontinue business as usual while countering a threat or recovering from an incident.\n\nInformation operations are attempts to ‘influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the\ndecision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting [its] own’.\n\nA criminal marketplace specialised in stolen card data, where data coming from a\nsingle breach is often sold in several tranches. Joker’s Stash was opened in 2014,\nand has representation on numerous other cyber criminal and carding forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Term Definition\n\n**Kazuar backdoor** A .Net backdoor attributed to Blue Python, consisting of an executable and a loaded\nDLL. Kazuar supports numerous capabilities, including acting as an HTTP server\nable to receive commands from a remote attacker.\n\n**Living off the land** Using legitimate tools and processes, often already installed on a victim’s device, to\nreduce the chance of an attack being detected.\n\n**LookBack** LookBack is a C++ RAT with capabilities that include system, process, and file\ndiscovery and manipulation, screen capture as well as remote interaction with the\nhost. The RAT leverages a proxy communication module to create a proxied C2\nchannel, through which LookBack exfiltrates data from the infected host. LookBack\nhas been observed targeting a few specific sectors, including academia.\n\n**Lure document** A document designed to attract the attention of a user – to ‘lure’ them – while\nmalware is being installed on the victim’s machine. The document can be simply a\ndecoy, or weaponised with malicious code.\n\n**Magecart** The umbrella term Magecart describes threat actors that use JavaScript-based\nmalware to capture payment card information from compromised online retailers or\ntheir third party ecommerce platforms.\n\n**MESSAGETAP** A malicious implant targeted at mobile telecommunications infrastructure, that\ncarries out real-time monitoring of SMS services.\n\n**Nodersok** A strain of fileless malware, installed via the execution of a HTML Application (HTA)\nfile. Nodersok uses a multi-stage process to download and install several legitimate\ntools, including Node.exe (the Windows implementation of Node.js), and WinDivert, a\npacket capture tool. Nodersok then abuses these tools to proxy victims’ traffic, in\norder to intercept personal data and credentials.\n\n**NOKKI backdoor** A backdoor attributed to Black Shoggoth, consisting of a main executable and\nloaded DLL. NOKKI is designed to steal information from victims, and has been\ndeployed against numerous targets, including victims in South Korea and victims\nspeaking Cambodian and Cyrillic.\n\n**Owl** The Owl backdoor uses the Windows HTTP API to serve HTTP endpoints, providing\ncommand execution on the host and the ability to proxy traffic into an internal\nnetwork, making an infected webserver a potential pivot point for the threat actor.\n\n**POS malware** Malware installed on point of sale terminals used to harvest credit card and debit\ncard information, by intercepting its processing at checkout and forwarding it to\nattacker-controlled servers. An example of POS malware is FIN6’s FrameworkPOS.\n\n**Reconnaissance** The process, undertaken by threat actors, of researching available information about\na target, including attempting to identify vulnerabilities in target systems or\nindividuals of interest.\n\n**Rifdoor** A backdoor attributed to Andariel, a threat actor that PwC tracks as a subset of\nNorth Korea-based Black Artemis. Rifdoor has been documented in its basic form\nsince at least 2015; in 2019, PwC observed an updated variant of the malware with\nadded capabilities such as screen capture.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Term Definition\n\n\n**ROKRAT**\n\n**ROKROID**\n\n**Ryuk**\n\n**ShadowPad backdoor**\n\n**Shamoon**\n\n**Skipper**\n\n**Spoof**\n\n**Stonedrill**\n\n**Supply chain attack**\n\n**Threat actor**\n\n\nOne of Black Shoggoth's main tools, ROKRAT is a backdoor using Cloud services for\nC2 that was first observed in 2016, and has undergone active development at least\nup until 2018.\n\nA malicious Android application attributed to Black Shoggoth, and delivered to\nvictims via URL shortened links embedded in spear-phishing emails. ROKDROID has\na large set of capabilities, including recording calls, exfiltrating call logs, and\ninteracting with a C2 server.\n\nA ransomware family almost always deployed after an initial infection of Emotet has\ninstalled TrickBot on victim systems. It has been used in a number of highly targeted\nattacks against enterprises, with ransom notes unique to compromised victims.\n\nA backdoor that was used to trojanise management software: this was the first stage\nin a complex supply-chain attack aimed at profiling victims to identify interesting\ntargets to compromise further. ShadowPad contains multiple anti-analysis\ntechniques, and is able to set persistence on victim systems and escalate privileges,\nas well as to send system profiling information back to its C2.\n\nShamoon is a destructive malware family that was observed in extremely targeted\nattacks in 2012, 2016, and 2018. Comprising of three components – a dropper, a\nreporter, and a wiper – Shamoon is engineered to cause the greatest damage\npossible by spreaing like a worm on a network, completely erasing victims’ file and\nbooting systems to render them factually unusable.\n\nA Blue Python implant that acts as a first-stage profiling tool to gather victims’\ninformation, which is then used to then deploy other, more powerful tools such as\nthe Snake backdoor.\n\nTo spoof an email account, domain, or entity is to imitate it, with the aim to deceive a\nvictim as to the account, domain, or entity’s legitimacy (trustworthiness) and identity.\n\nA disk wiping malware also called SHAPESHIFT, Stonedrill also contains espionage\ntools indicating the destructive malware serves multiple purpose.\n\nAttacks in which threat actors seek ways to exploit computer networks via the\nprivileged access given to third-party suppliers, using them as entry points into\ntargeted entities. Supply chain attacks can involve compromising software or\nhardware providers, and creating malicious versions of the products.\n\nA malicious entity responsible for an intrusion attempt (successful or unsuccessful),\nwhich can be motivated by factors including a desire to steal confidential data,\ncommit financial fraud, disrupt or destroy a system or cause reputational damage.\n\n\n**Threat intelligence** Threat intelligence consists of the analysis and collection of information pertaining to\ndifferent malicious cyber threat actors, understanding the techniques they employ\nand their targets, so as to better protect a specific organisation given the particular\nthreats it faces.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Term Definition\n\n**Topinambour** Blue Python dropper malware written in .Net, used to deliver malware including the\nKopiLuwak JavaScript backdoor to victims.\n\n\n**TrickBot**\n\n**Trojanised (program)**\n\n**UAC**\n\n**UAC bypass**\n\n**Vishing**\n\n**Watering hole**\n\n**WhiteShadow**\n\n**Winnti backdoor**\n\n**ZeroCleare**\n\n\nFirst seen in 2016, TrickBot is a modular banking trojan and credential stealer\ndesigned to steal banking and other online account details. It is often delivered after\nan initial Emotet infection. PwC assesses that one core threat actor is in charge of\nthe overall TrickBot system, with sub botnets that are configured to individual\nrequirements for ‘clients’.\n\nThe term refers to a trusted legitimate program that has been altered or tampered\nwith by a threat actor to hide malware in transit and deliver it to targets, or to perform\nmalicious functionality on victim systems.\n\nUser Account Control (UAC) is a Windows component that makes applications and\ntasks run in a context with non-administrative privileges on a system. It is meant to\nprevent inadvertent system changes caused by a standard user, and to impede\nmalware from taking system administrator-level actions.\n\nThe term ‘UAC bypass’ refers to any measure that leads a program (including, but\nnot exclusively, malware) to elevate its system privileges, and take actions normally\nreserved for system administrators even if the signed-in user does not have\nadministrator rights.\n\nShort for ‘voice phishing’, it consists of an attacker attenmpting to socially engineer\na victim over a phone call, to discover more information about them or convince\nthem to perform certain actions (for example, unwittingly installing malware).\n\nAlso referred to as strategic web compromises, a watering hole attack is a method of\ninfiltration. A threat actor will compromise a specific trusted website and use this to\ninfect visitors to the site.\n\nA macro-based downloader malware attributed to Green Havildar, that uses SQL\nqueries to download a payload (which can be CrimsonRAT or commodity RATs like\nAzoRULT) to the infected machine from a remote server.\n\nA backdoor first identified in 2011, Winnti has been used by multiple threat actors\ncollectively known as the ‘Winnti’ metagroup. Used as a backdoor implant as well as\na first pivot point to further compromise victim environments, Winnti has been\ndeployed against numerous targets: from gaming companies and commercial\norganisations to telecommunication companies and dissident communities.\n\nA new wiper malware family disclosed in late 2019, ZeroCleare has links to Shamoon\nmalware and was also deployed against targets in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThis content is for general information purposes only, and should not be used as a substitute for consultation with professional advisors.\n\n© 2020 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP All rights reserved PwC refers to the UK member firm and may sometimes refer to the PwC network\n\n\n-----",
