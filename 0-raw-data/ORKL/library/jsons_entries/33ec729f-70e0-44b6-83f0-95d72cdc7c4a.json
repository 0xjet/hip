Within the large volumes of samples submitted daily to these\n\nservices, some submissions appear to be different from others and show interesting\n\n[characteristics. At USENIX Security 2015 I presented a paper in which we proposed a](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions)\n\nmethod to automatically discover malware developments from samples submitted to\n\nonline dynamic analysis systems. The research was conducted by dissecting the [Anubis](https://anubis.iseclab.org/)\n\nsandbox dataset which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years. The\n\nmethodology we proposed was effective and we were able to detect many interesting\n\ncases in which the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the\n\ndevelopment phase of the threats.\n\nAnother interesting result that came from the research concerns the samples attributed\n\nto Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. Surprisingly, some of the malware\n\nsamples used in these sophisticated attacks had been submitted to the Anubis sandbox\n\nmonths -- sometimes even years -- before the attack had been attributed to the proper\n\nAPT campaign by a security vendor. To be perfectly clear, we are not saying that it took\n\nsecurity vendors months or years to detect a threat. Most times, we are able to detect\n\nthe threats in no more than a few hours. It is just that the malware samples were\n\nmislabeled and not properly associated with APT campaigns. In general, the same goes\n\nfor non-APT malware campaigns. In this blog post, we tried to see if the same applied to\n\nthe Cisco dataset. Speci�cally, we chose ten APT campaigns, -- some of which were\n\nalready covered in the Usenix paper. We decided to inspect two different datasets: our\n\nincoming sample feeds / malware zoo, and the telemetry associated with our Advanced\n\nMalware Protection (AMP) solutions. Talos receives samples from over 100 external\n\n\n-----\n\nThe remaining part of this post is organized as follows. First, we show the APT\n\ncampaigns we investigated. Second, we summarize the results of the analysis of the\n\nTalos dataset. Third, we show the results from the AMP dataset. Finally, we summarize\n\nour �ndings.\n\n## APT CAMPAIGNS\n\nAPT CAMPAIGN MADE PUBLIC\n\nBeebus February 2013\n\nArid Viper February 2015\n\nRed October January 2013\n\nEquation February 2015\n\nPaci�c RAT July 2014\n\nRegin November 2014\n\nAurora January 2010\n\nPitty Tiger July 2014\n\nNet Traveller June 2013\n\nBrutPOS July 2014\n\nThe ten malware campaigns in the table above garnered signi�cant media attention\n\nwhen discovered, with some of them clearly falling in the area of APT. They were found\n\nby different security companies between 2010 and 2015, having different levels of\n\nsophistication and different objectives. Moreover, these APT campaigns were not limited\n\nto western countries. They have affected organizations all over the world. Most of the\n\ntime, connecting the dots and drawing relationships between samples and campaigns\n\ntake months and many experts. This means the security company that releases a\n\ndetailed report documenting the campaign is aware of it long before the information is\n\nmade public. However, we believe the “public release” date is still a good metric, because\n\nit is the moment at which all the other security companies and the entire world are made\n\naware of these threats.\n\nAnother important aspect during an APT investigation is attribution. While detection is\n\ndone quickly attribution for these campaigns is often an open and hard problem to solve\n\n|APT CAMPAIGN|MADE PUBLIC|\n|---|---|\n|Beebus|February 2013|\n|Arid Viper|February 2015|\n|Red October|January 2013|\n|Equation|February 2015|\n|Paci c RAT|July 2014|\n|Regin|November 2014|\n|Aurora|January 2010|\n|Pitty Tiger|July 2014|\n|Net Traveller|June 2013|\n|BrutPOS|July 2014|\n\n\n-----\n\nattribute the attack to a threat actor. This was the case for some of the APT campaigns\n\ndiscussed so far. Some of these threats have been attributed to state-sponsored actors,\n\nothers to cyber criminals or to espionage attacks. However, like in the USENIX\n\npublication, in this post we will make no speculation about attribution.\n\nIn the next paragraphs, we will present the results of searching for samples associated\n\nwith these APT campaigns in our datasets.\n\n## TALOS DATASET\n\nAPT AVG DAYS BEFORE APT CAMPAIGN PUBLICALLY\n\nCAMPAIGN IDENTIFIED\n\nBeebus 574\n\nArid Viper 178\n\nRed October 68\n\nEquation 1371\n\nPaci�c RAT 455\n\nRegin 1018\n\nAurora 80\n\nPitty Tiger 602\n\nNet Traveller 105\n\nBrutPOS 68\n\nThis table shows the results of the analysis of our incoming sample feeds/malware zoo.\n\nFor every campaign, we checked in our malware zoo to see when they had been initially\n\nsubmitted to us. Given that we know when information about these APT campaigns was\n\nmade public, we can compute the number of days it took the security community to\n\npublicly tie the samples to an APT campaign, even though the samples had been marked\n\nmalicious for other reasons. On average, these samples went for 458 days before being\n\ntied to an APT campaign. The table presents the average number of days for the entire\n\ncampaign, and we go from a few months as in the case of “Aurora” to more than three\n\nyears for “Equation”. Notice that these �gures come from our malware zoo which\n\ncollects samples from external sources and in general are a good indicator given the\n\namount of samples received per day Notice that these numbers vary based on the\n\n|APT CAMPAIGN|AVG DAYS BEFORE APT CAMPAIGN PUBLICALLY IDENTIFIED|\n|---|---|\n|Beebus|574|\n|Arid Viper|178|\n|Red October|68|\n|Equation|1371|\n|Paci c RAT|455|\n|Regin|1018|\n|Aurora|80|\n|Pitty Tiger|602|\n|Net Traveller|105|\n|BrutPOS|68|\n\n\n-----\n\n## VIRUS TOTAL\n\nThe vast majority of the submissions come from big organizations such as Antivirus\n\ncompanies. Interestingly, a signi�cant percentage is submitted by [VirusTotal. For this](https://www.virustotal.com/)\n\nreason we decided to check the submitters for possible links and intelligence\n\ninformation. As already documented by [Dixon, information about the submitters of](http://blog.9bplus.com/watching-attackers-through-virustotal/)\n\nsamples is not publicly available, but can partially be retrieved from their Intelligence\n\nservice. For every sample, it is possible to know a hash (a hexadecimal unique identi�er\n\nof the submitter), the country (from the geolocalization of the IP address of the\n\nsubmitter) and the method (the way the sample has been submitted, for instance via the\n\nweb interface or the APIs). This opaque information complicates the analysis a little bit,\n\nbut it is still possible to obtain interesting results.\n\nSUBMITTER CAMPAIGNS\n\nAridViper Nettraveller RedOctober BrutPOS\n6exxxxxx\n\nPittyTiger\n\n14xxxxxx AridViper Regin\n\n22xxxxxx AridViper Regin Nettraveller BrutPOS PittyTiger\n\nAridViper Nettraveller Paci�cRAT BrutPOS\n20xxxxxx\n\nPittyTiger\n\n5exxxxxx Equation Regin BrutPOS Auror\n\n72xxxxxx Equation Regin BrutPOS\n\n4bxxxxxx Regin\n\n3bxxxxxx Regin\n\ncdxxxxxx Beebus PittyTiger Nettraveller BrutPOS\n\nb4xxxxxx Aurora\n\nThe table above summarizes our �ndings from VirusTotal. The �rst column shows the\n\nhash of the submitter. This means that the submitter sent one or more samples of a\n\ngiven APT campaign to VirusTotal before its public release. One can only speculate on\n\nwho these submitters are. They could very likely be the threat actors themselves, testing\n\nto see if their malware is detected by the AV companies. They could also be security\n\n|SUBMITTER|CAMPAIGNS|\n|---|---|\n|6exxxxxx|AridViper Nettraveller RedOctober BrutPOS PittyTiger|\n|14xxxxxx|AridViper Regin|\n|22xxxxxx|AridViper Regin Nettraveller BrutPOS PittyTiger|\n|20xxxxxx|AridViper Nettraveller Paci cRAT BrutPOS PittyTiger|\n|5exxxxxx|Equation Regin BrutPOS Auror|\n|72xxxxxx|Equation Regin BrutPOS|\n|4bxxxxxx|Regin|\n|3bxxxxxx|Regin|\n|cdxxxxxx|Beebus PittyTiger Nettraveller BrutPOS|\n|b4xxxxxx|Aurora|\n\n\n-----\n\nto different APT campaigns.\n\n## CISCO AMP\n\nWe went through our logs to search for entries that contained hashes related to the ten\n\nAPT campaigns we have been investigating. Interestingly, we got hits for eight different\n\nhashes belonging to three different campaigns that were discovered on Cisco AMP\n\ncustomer machines before the APT campaign was publicly identi�ed.\n\nAPT CAMPAIGN (NUM DAYS BEFORE APT CAMPAIGN\n\nOF SAMPLES) PUBLICALLY IDENTIFIED\n\nArid Viper (1 SAMPLE) -50\n\nEquation (1 SAMPLE) +1\n\nBrutPOS (6 SAMPLES) -64\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, we identi�ed eight malicious samples that were in the\n\nwild before being associated with APT campaigns. It is important to repeat that most of\n\nthese samples were detected as malicious the moment they �rst appeared on our\n\ncustomers’ machines.\n\nSurprisingly, one sample of the Equation APT campaign (fanny worm) was found and\n\nblocked on a Cisco AMP customer’s machine a day after the public release of the\n\nKaspersky [report.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf)\n\n|APT CAMPAIGN (NUM OF SAMPLES)|DAYS BEFORE APT CAMPAIGN PUBLICALLY IDENTIFIED|\n|---|---|\n|Arid Viper (1 SAMPLE)|-50|\n|Equation (1 SAMPLE)|+1|\n|BrutPOS (6 SAMPLES)|-64|\n\n|HASH (SHA256)|DATE|DISPOSITION|APT|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|003315B0AEA2FCB9F77D29223DD8947D0E6792B3A0227E054BE8EB2A11F443D9|2015-02-17|MALICIOUS|EQUATION|\n|003315B0AEA2FCB9F77D29223DD8947D0E6792B3A0227E054BE8EB2A11F443D9|2015-02-17|MALICIOUS|EQUATION|\n|015FBC0B216D197136DF8692B354BF2FC7BD6EB243E73283D861A4DBBB81A751|2014-12-20|UNKNOWN|ARID VIPER|\n|015FBC0B216D197136DF8692B354BF2FC7BD6EB243E73283D861A4DBBB81A751|2014-12-20|MALICIOUS|ARID VIPER|\n|015FBC0B216D197136DF8692B354BF2FC7BD6EB243E73283D861A4DBBB81A751|2015-01-02|MALIICIOUS|ARID VIPER|\n|015FBC0B216D197136DF8692B354BF2FC7BD6EB243E73283D861A4DBBB81A751|2015-01-16|MALICIOUS|ARID VIPER|\n\n\n-----\n\n|508909C8A00026C904F52099DD62BBF4062B4E8E40FC0601BD9E13570514B4F5|2014-05-06|MALICIOUS|BRUTPOS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|7170A07BCB5B0467A75CBD17A1A1877AEC3C8EA43C45D3BED6AB5E6C95A62713|2014-05-06|MALICIOUS|BRUTPOS|\n|9A10916AD0F43FA3376C2E54FD5CFDD06D684B3A19895ED4107FAF9F3313DCDA|2014-05-07|MALICIOUS|BRUTPOS|\n|E28EABEB678AFB5E172F4127C5692E742809FD86DFA8478C1DC6F9C13B2A8E5F|2014-05-06|UNKNOWN|BRUTPOS|\n|E28EABEB678AFB5E172F4127C5692E742809FD86DFA8478C1DC6F9C13B2A8E5F|2014-05-07|MALICIOUS|BRUTPOS|\n\n\nBased on our logs, Cisco AMP found the sample\n\n015FBC0B216D197136DF8692B354BF2FC7BD6EB243E73283D861A4DBBB81A751\n\ntwice on 2015-12-20. It was “unknown” to AMP the �rst time, but detected as malicious\n\nthe second time.\n\nE28EABEB678AFB5E172F4127C5692E742809FD86DFA8478C1DC6F9C13B2A8E5F\n\nwas “unknown” to AMP on 2014-05-06, but detected as malicious the next time it was\n\nseen on a customer’s machine on 2014-05-07. In all the other cases the samples were\n\nalready considered malicious.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nAs the number of threats per day continues to increase, the number of malware samples\n\nsecurity companies automatically analyze increases. Much of the analysis is comprised\n\nof dynamic analysis systems, such as sandboxes, to determine whether the sample is\n\nmalicious or not. These samples are then stored for further analysis. Due to the large\n\nnumbers of samples, in many organizations the vast majority of these samples remain\n\ncategorized solely on the initial sandbox run. Even when these samples are shared\n\namong companies or via other services like VirusTotal some malware samples can go\n\nunnoticed for months because they are marked as malware but given some generic\n\nname, such as “Win.Trojan.Agent”. Then we are shocked when a security company\n\ndiscovers an APT campaign that has supposedly gone unnoticed for years.\n\nThe results of this post con�rm the assumption of the Usenix [paper, also based on a](http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/docs/usenixsec15_graziano.pdf)\n\ndataset of a big security company and similar results are expected throughout the\n\nsecurity industry. Many times, malware is initially submitted to sandbox systems and\n\nmarked as malicious based on the output of the sandbox. Then the authors use that\n\ninformation to tweak the sample to avoid detection in future sandbox runs through\n\nvarious evasion tactics. In other situations, the initial sample may not even be �agged as\n\nmalicious due to evasion techniques being utilized By performing statistical analysis and\n\n\n-----\n\np y y\n\nanalytical systems to identify campaigns and link the samples together.\n\nIdentifying today’s threats requires multiple layers of protection at various points across\n\nthe network, along with constantly updated threat intelligence information. Cisco\n\nanalyzes a massive amount of telemetry data and is able to �ag malware as malicious\n\nbased on multiple factors. By performing manual and programmatic analysis of sandbox\n\ndata in conjunction with identifying behaviors which are associated with malicious\n\nactivity, even unknown APT campaigns can be neutralized.\n\nP O S T E D B Y [E A R L C A R T E R](https://www.blogger.com/profile/07833323932899203321) AT [1 1 : 0 3 A M](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/haystack.html)\n\nL A B E L S : [A P T,](http://blog.talosintel.com/search/label/APT) [C A M PA I G N,](http://blog.talosintel.com/search/label/campaign) [M A LWA R E,](http://blog.talosintel.com/search/label/Malware) [TA L O S,](http://blog.talosintel.com/search/label/Talos) [W H I T E PA P E R](http://blog.talosintel.com/search/label/White%20Paper)\n\nS H A R E T H I S P O S T\n\nNO COMMENTS:\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n\n-----\n\n[N E W E R P O S T](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/bypassing-miniupnp-stack-smashing.html) [H O M E](http://blog.talosintel.com/) [O L D E R P O S T](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/ms-tuesday.html)\n\nS U B S C R I B E T O : [P O S T C O M M E N T S (AT O M)](http://blog.talosintel.com/feeds/4135572735713245294/comments/default)\n\n**SEARCH THE BLOG**\n\nSearch\n\n**SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FEED**\n\nPosts\n\nComments\n\n**BLOG ARCHIVE**\n\n[▼ 2 0 1 6](javascript:void(0)) (21)\n\n[► A P R I L](javascript:void(0)) (4)\n\n[► M A R C H](javascript:void(0)) (7)\n\n[► F E B R U A R Y](javascript:void(0)) (6)\n\n[▼ J A N U A R Y](javascript:void(0)) (4)\n\n[Bypassing MiniUPnP Stack Smashing Protection](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/bypassing-miniupnp-stack-smashing.html)\n\n[Research Spotlight: Needles in a Haystack](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/haystack.html)\n\n[Microsoft Patch Tuesday - January 2016](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/ms-tuesday.html)\n\n[Rigging compromise - RIG Exploit Kit](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/01/rigging-compromise.html)\n\n[► 2 0 1 5](javascript:void(0)) (62)\n\n[► 2 0 1 4](javascript:void(0)) (67)\n\n[► 2 0 1 3](javascript:void(0)) (30)\n\n[► 2 0 1 2](javascript:void(0)) (53)\n\n\n-----\n\n[► 2 0 0 9](javascript:void(0)) (146)\n\n[► 2 0 0 8](javascript:void(0)) (38)\n\n**RECOMMENDED BLOGS**\n\n[C I S C O B L O G](http://blogs.cisco.com/)\n\n[Cisco Digital Ceiling: Enhanced Learning through Technology and Digitization](http://blogs.cisco.com/digital/cisco-digital-ceiling-enhanced-learning-through-technology-and-digitization)\n\n[S N O R T B L O G](http://blog.snort.org/)\n\n[Snort Subscriber Rule Set Update for 04/08/2016](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Snort/~3/eSAGzdyEmvE/snort-subscriber-rule-set-update-for_8.html)\n\n[C L A M AV ® B L O G](http://blog.clamav.net/)\n\n[ClamAV Community Signature contest winner for March, 2016](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Clamav/~3/jQgNzYi5uZo/clamav-community-signature-contest.html)\n\n\n[Software](http://talosintel.com/software)\n\n[Community](http://talosintel.com/community)\n\n[Vulnerability Reports](http://talosintel.com/vulnerability-reports)\n\n[Additional Resources](http://talosintel.com/additional-resources)\n\n[Microsoft to SID Mapping Archive](http://talosintel.com/ms-advisory-rules)\n\n[Shared Object Rule Generator](http://talosintel.com/so-rule-generator)\n\n[IP Blacklist Download](http://talosintel.com/feeds/ip-filter.blf)\n\n[AWBO Exercises](http://talosintel.com/awbo)\n\n[About Talos](http://talosintel.com/about)\n\n[Join Our Team](http://talosintel.com/careers)\n\n[Contact](http://talosintel.com/contact/)\n\n[Blog](http://blog.talosintel.com/)\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n\n-----\n\n© 2015 Cisco Systems, Inc. and/or its affiliates.
