    "plain_text": "# Operation Cobalt Kitty\n\n## Threat Actor Profile &\n Indicators of Compromise\n\n#### By: Assaf Dahan\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attribution\n\nIn this APT, the threat actor was very aware of the risks of exposure and tried to combat\nattribution as much as possible. This is often the case in this type of large-scale cyber\nespionage operations. At the time of the attack, there weren’t many classic indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) that could lead to attribution. However, at the same time, the threat actors\nbehind Operation Cobalt Kitty left enough “behavioral fingerprints” to suspect the involvement of\nthe OceanLotus Group (which also goes by the names APT-C-00, SeaLotus and APT32),\nwhich was first documented by [Qihoo 360's SkyEye Labs in 2015](https://ti.360.com/upload/report/file/OceanLotusReport.pdf) and further researched by\n[other security companies, including FireEye’s report. Reports of the group’s activity in Asia date](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html)\n[back to 2012, attacking Chinese entities. Over the years, the group was observed attacking a](https://web.archive.org/web/20151013184335/http:/drops.wooyun.org/papers/6335)\nwide spectrum of targets in other Asian countries (Philippines and Vietnam). Cybereason\nconcludes that the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed throughout operation\nCobalt Kitty are consistent with the group’s previous APT campaigns in Asia.\n\nThe Lotus Group appears to have a tendency of using similar and even identical names for their\npayloads (seen in their PowerShell payloads, Denis backdoor and fake Flash installers). In\naddition, they also used similar anonymization services for their domains repeatedly. That type\nof “small” details also played a role in attributing Operation Cobalt Kitty to the OceanLotus\nGroup.\n\nLastly, during the investigation, Cybereason noticed that some of the C&C domains and IPs\nstarted to emerge on VirusTotal and other threat intelligence engines, with payloads that were\nnot observed during Cobalt Kitty. This was a cutting proof that Cobalt Kitty was not an isolated\nAPT, but part of something bigger. Example of the C&C domains and IPs used by the group\nacross different APT campaigns and caught in the wild:\n\n*.chatconnecting(.)com teriava(.)com 23.227.196(.)210\nblog.versign(.)com tonholding(.)com 104.237.218(.)72\nvieweva(.)com nsquery(.)net 45.114.117(.)137\ntulationeva(.)com notificeva(.)com\n\nSome of these domains were also mentioned in FireEye’s [APT32 report, further confirming our](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html)\nsuspicions that the group behind the attack is the OceanLotus Group.\n\nThe group includes members who are fluent in at least two Asian languages. This claim is\nsupported by the language used in the spear-phishing emails, which appear to be written by\nnative speakers. In addition, the language localization settings found in few of the payloads\nsuggest that the malware authors compiled the payloads on machines with Asian languages\n\n©2017 Cybereason Inc.

The threat actors are not likely native English speakers since multiple typos were found\nin their payloads.\n\nFor example, the following typo was observed in the file metadata of one of the backdoors.\nNotice the “Internal Name” field (“Geogle Update”):\n\n### Threat Actor Profile\n\nThe attackers behind **Operation Cobalt Kitty were extremely persistent. Even when their**\ncampaign was exposed, the attackers did not give up. They took “pauses” that lasted between\n48 hours and four weeks and used the downtime to learn from their “mistakes” and develop\nworkarounds before resuming the APT campaign.\n\nThe members of the **OceanLotus Group demonstrated a remarkable ability to quickly adapt,**\nintroduce new tools and fine tune existing ones to bypass security solutions and avoid detection.\nThe high number of payloads and the elaborate C2 infrastructure used in this attack can be\nindicative of the resources that the attackers had at their disposal. Simultaneously orchestrating\nmultiple APT campaigns of such magnitude and sophistication takes time, financial resources\nand a large team who can support it.\n\n###### Threat actor’s main characteristics \nHere are the main characteristics that can help profile the threat actor:\n\n  - **Motivation**   - Based on the nature of the attack, the proprietary information that the\n\nattackers were after and the high-profile personnel who were targeted, Cybereason\nconcluded the main motivation behind the attack was cyber espionage. The attacker\nsought after specific documents and type of information. This is consistent with [previous](https://web.archive.org/web/20151013184335/http:/drops.wooyun.org/papers/6335)\n[reports](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html) about the group’s activity show that the group has a very wide range of targets,\nspanning from government agencies, media, business sector, and more.\n\n©2017 Cybereason Inc. All rights reserved. 2\n\n\n-----\n\n  - **Operational working hours**   - Most of the malicious activity was mostly done around\n\nnormal business hours (8AM-8PM). Very little active hacking activity was detected\nduring weekends. The attackers showed a slight tendency to carry out hacking\noperations towards the afternoon and evening time. These observations can suggest the\nfollowing:\n\n      - Time zone(s) proximity.\n\n      - An institutionalized threat actor (possibly nation-state)\n\n  - **Outlook backdoor and data exfiltration - One of the most interesting tools introduced**\n\nby the attackers was the Outlook backdoor, which used Outlook as a C2 channel. This\nbackdoor has not been publicly documented and is one of the most unique TTPs with\nregards to the threat actor. Outlook backdoors are not a new concept and have been\n[observed in different APTs in the past. However, this specific type of Outlook backdoor](https://www.cybereason.com/cybereason-labs-research-a-new-persistent-attack-methodology-targeting-microsoft-owa/)\nis can be considered as one of the “signature tools” of the OceanLotus Group.\n\n  - **Publicly available tools**   - The attackers showed a clear preference to use publicly\n\navailable hacking tools and frameworks. Beyond being spared the hassle of creating a\nnew tool, it is much harder to attribute a tool that can be used by anyone rather than a\ncustom-made tool. However, the attackers should not be considered script-kiddies. Most\nof the publicly available tools were either obfuscated, modified and even merged with\nother tools to evade antivirus detection. This type of customization requires good coding\nskills and understanding of how those tools work.\n\n  - **Cobalt Strike usage in APT -** [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/) is a commercial offensive security\n\nframework designed to simulate complex attacks and is mainly used by security\nprofessionals in security audits and penetration testing. The **OceanLotus Group** [was](https://read01.com/yxjnL2.html)\n[previously documented](https://read01.com/yxjnL2.html) [using Cobalt Strike as one of its main tools. Other Large scale](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html)\nAPTs using Cobalt Strike have been reported before, such as [APT-TOCS](http://www.antiy.net/p/analysis-on-apt-to-be-attack-that-focusing-on-chinas-government-agency/) (could be\n[related to OceanLotus), Ordinaff, Carbanak Group, and the](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/odinaff-new-trojan-used-high-level-financial-attacks) [Cobalt Group.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53758/cyber-crime/jackpotting-attacks.html)\n\n  - **Custom-built backdoors -** The threat actor used very sophisticated and stealthy\n\nbackdoors (Denis & Goopy) that were written by highly skilled malware authors. During\nthe attack, the authors introduced new variants of these backdoors, indicating “on-thefly” development capabilities. Developing such state-of-the-art backdoors requires skillful\nmalware authors, time and resources. In addition, both the Denis and Goopy backdoors\nused DNS Tunneling for C2 communication. The OceanLotus Group is known to have a\n[backdoor dubbed SOUNDBITE by FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html) that use this stealthy technique. However, no\npublic analysis reports of SOUNDBITE is available to the time of writing this report.\n\n  - **Exploiting DLL hijacking in trusted applications - The attackers exploited three DLL-**\n\nhijacking vulnerabilities in legitimate applications from trusted vendors: **Microsoft,**\n**Google and Kaspersky. This further indicates the group’s emphasis on vulnerability**\nresearch. DLL-hijacking / Side-loading attacks are not uncommon in APTs, some of\nwhich are also carried out by nation-state actors and advanced cyber-crime groups.\n\n©2017 Cybereason Inc.

For instance, Cobalt strike\npayloads communicated with certain sets of IPs/domains while the backdoors\ncommunicated with different sets of IPs/domains.\n\n      - **Re-use of domains and IPs across campaigns - Quite a few domains and IPs**\n\nthat were observed in Operation Cobalt Kitty were found in-the-wild, attacking\nother targets. It’s rather peculiar why the threat actor re-used the same domains\nand IPs. It could be assumed that the malware operators wanted to have\ncentralized C&C servers per tool or tools, where they could monitor all of their\ncampaigns from dedicated servers.\n\n      - **Anonymous DNS records**      - Most of the domains point to companies that\n\nprovide DNS data privacy and anonymization, such as [PrivacyProtect](http://privacyprotect.org/) and\n[PrivacyGuardian.](https://www.privacyguardian.org/)\n\n      - **C&C server protection**      - Most of the C&C servers IP addresses are protected\n\nby [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [SECURED SERVERS LLC.](https://securedservers.com/)\n\n###### OceanLotus Group activity in Asia \n\nAs part of the analysis of the domains and IPs that were used in this operation, Cybereason\nfound samples that were caught “in-the-wild” (that were **not part of Operation Cobalt Kitty).**\nAnalysis of those samples clearly indicates the involvement of the threat actor in Asia and\nVietnam in particular. Both Qihoo 360 and FireEye demonstrate in their reports that the threat\nactor is involved in campaigns in different Asian countries, such as Vietnam, China, and the\nPhilippines.\n\nMost of the samples caught in-the-wild seem to target Vietnamese speakers. Some of the\nsamples exhibit clear evidence of targeting Vietnamese entities.
