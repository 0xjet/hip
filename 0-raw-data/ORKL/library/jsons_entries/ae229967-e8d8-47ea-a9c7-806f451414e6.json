There has been a lot of good work describing how clusters of activities by different\nthreat actors (APT41, Fishmonger, Tonto Team, RedFoxTrot, BackdoorDiplomacy are all the\n“big names” we know) are linked by ShadowPad. I thought to join in the fun of reverse\nengineering one of the variant of ShadowPad that I found from VirusTotal. So let’s begin!\n\nSide-note: Kaspersky calls this variant “ShadowShredder” [1]. This variant has also been\ndocumented by PTSecurity [2] in Jan 2021 and was also recently in TeamT5’s presentation\nin VB2021localhost conference [3].\n\nThe malware trinity (DLL load-order attack) analyzed in this post:\n\nLegitimate EXE, bdreinit.exe (Bitdefender’s Crash Handler) — SHA256:\n386EB7AA33C76CE671D6685F79512597F1FAB28EA46C8EC7D89E58340081E2BD\n\nMalicious DLL, log.dll — SHA256:\n8D1A5381492FE175C3C8263B6B81FD99AACE9E2506881903D502336A55352FEF\n\nEncrypted Payload, log.dll.dat — SHA256:\n0371FC2A7CC73665971335FC23F38DF2C82558961AD9FC2E984648C9415D8C4E\n\n\n-----\n\nI found these files separately, so they may not be originally intended as a package. I\nmanaged to piece them together based on their filenames, and they work fine as a set.\nThese files happened to have debugging strings included, which makes the analysis slightly\nmore pleasing to follow.\n\nLet’s start with observations from dynamic analysis.\n\nHere’s what the log looked like in the debugger upon execution without breakpoints:\n\nlogged by x32dbg\nThe same debugging information is also written into a file C:\\ProgramData\\bee.log.\n\nbee.log\n\n\n-----\n\nmore of bee.log\nIt seems that I’ve picked up a test sample. The C2 domain configured within is a subdomain\nof wikimedia[.]vip, which has been associated with Funnydll and other ShadowPad samples.\n\nI’m curious about the author’s choice of name — What does “BEE” stand for?\n\nI extracted all the interesting filename strings, for reference if anyone is interested at\nguessing the full suite of capabilities within ShadowPad:\n\n\n-----\n\nsource filenames\nAnd here’s the list of debugging messages found in memory:\n\n\n-----\n\ndebugging messages\nThe processes created are as such:\n\n\n-----\n\nlogged with APIMonitor\n“Test.exe” is a copy of bdreinit.exe and is part of the persistency mechanism of the malware\n— The EXE and DLL are started via Services, and the encrypted payload is loaded from\nRegistry. I supposed if service installation fails, then the malware shall persist through Run\nregkey.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe EXE and DLL are copied to C:\\ProgramData\\DRM\\Test (specified by configuration),\nwhile the DAT payload file is deleted after the first execution. For subsequent executions, the\npayload is read from Registry.\n\nThe payload is re-encrypted by the malware before it is being written into the Registry for\npersistency. For some reasons, the initialization value used in the re-encryption algorithm is\nthe compilation timestamp of the malicious DLL file, while the initialization value used in the\noriginal encryption algorithm is the first 4 bytes within the dat file, hence the encrypted data\nseen in the registry differs from the log.dll.dat file.\n\n\n-----\n\nencrypted payload in registry\n\nencrypted payload file\nHere is the python script I used to decrypt the payload file log.dll.dat:\n\n## SHADOWPAD-analysis/decrypt_payload_dat.py at main · asuna- amawaka/SHADOWPAD-analysis\n\n### This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below…\n\ngithub.com\n\nAnd here is the script for decrypting the payload from registry:\n\n## SHADOWPAD-analysis/decrypt_payload_reg.py at main · asuna- amawaka/SHADOWPAD-analysis\n\n### This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below…\n\ngithub.com\n\nThe malware has keystroke logging capabilities, and the keystroke log file is encrypted and\nsaved to a random-looking filepath in %PROGRAMDATA% like this:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\MOO\\JKISIQ\\EWGSE\\LECIIOGK\n\n\n-----\n\nDecryption of the keystroke log file is done in the same manner as the configuration data (I ll\ntalk about how to get this in awhile):\n\n## SHADOWPAD-analysis/decrypt_keystroke_log.py at main · asuna- amawaka/SHADOWPAD-analysis\n\n### You can't perform that action at this time. You signed in with another tab or window. You signed out in another tab or…\n\ngithub.com\n\n**Anti-reverse engineering obfuscation**\n\nNow, here comes details on how I handled the reverse engineering. This is slightly harder\nthan usual, because of the obfuscation technique used in the malware. The original malware\nbinary is “shredded” into pieces, with 1 instruction per piece, and put back together with a\n“jumper” function as glue. Oh, and there are some junk “cmp” followed by “jb” instructions\njust to make your eyes hurt.\n\nLet’s see what it looks like in IDA.\n\nUp till this point at address 0x100011D6, everything is normal.\n\ndisassembly at beginning of malware logic\nThen came this jmp:\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowed by another call:\n\nIf we follow the instructions starting from 0x10004465, you will see something like this:\n\nwithin “jumper” function\nIt looks terribly complicated, but all it does is to read the next dword after the call and add it\nto original intended return address.\n\nillustrate jumper (1)\nAnd these “bits and pieces” of instructions occur from here onwards, throughout the whole\nmalware. The “real” instruction that is part of the malware’s logic is the single instruction\nbefore the call to jumper. Trying to recover these instructions makes me feel like I am picking\n\n\n-----\n\nup the pieces from the shredding machine and gluing them back.\n\nillustrate jumper (2)\n\nillustrate jumper (3)\n\nillustrate jumper (4)\n\nillustrate jumper (5)\n\nillustrate jumper (6)\nAfter doing away with the jumper calls, here’s a snippet of recovered “shreds” of instructions:\n\n\n-----\n\nI greyed out the junk “cmp” and “jb” instructions. Up till this point, the process of recovery is\nvery manual, with abit of help from this IDAPython script I wrote:\n\n## SHADOWPAD-analysis/ida_get_next_instr.py at main · asuna- amawaka/SHADOWPAD-analysis\n\n### You can't perform that action at this time. You signed in with another tab or window. You signed out in another tab or…\n\ngithub.com\n\nThe python script is not perfect — at some point it will fail to work as intended, and I will have\nto apply the script again at the position where it failed. Furthermore, this manner of\n“advancing” through the disassembly in IDA didn’t feel very efficient. As it turns out, using the\n“trace” feature in the debugger produced the expected results with ease.\n\n\n-----\n\ntrace in x32dbg\n\n\n-----\n\ntraced log\nAfter some cleaning up, here’s the code logic that decrypts the payload from registry, for a\ntaste of what we can see after doing away with the jumper calls and junk cmp-jbs.\n\n\n-----\n\ntraced instructions for decrypting payload from registry\n**Malware Configuration**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to recover the configuration data, it helps to know what it looks like from older\nvariants of ShadowPad (without the shredding obfuscation) — so that we can recognize it in\nmemory. I used APIMonitor to look out for memory copies, because I knew that was what\nShadowPad will do with its configuration.\n\nAPIMonitor log of memcpy\nOne visual characteristic of the configuration data is that it will start and end with many\nzeroes, and it is not very long (the part that looks like encrypted data is approx. ~400 bytes\nlong). In this particular sample, the memory size expected for the configuration is 2198 bytes\nlong. This can perhaps be a helping value to look out for the memcpy call dealing with the\nconfiguration.\n\nDecryption of the configuration data uses the exact same algorithm as what is used to\ndecrypt the keystroke log file. Earlier I shared the standalone python script used to decrypt\nthe keystroke log file. Here’s the IDAPython version to handle the configuration data in IDA:\n\n## SHADOWPAD-analysis/ida_decrypt_config.py at main · asuna- amawaka/SHADOWPAD-analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n### You can t perform that action at this time. You signed in with another tab or window. You signed out in another tab or…\n\ngithub.com\n\nAnd here’s the decrypted configuration:\n\nShadowPad configuration decrypted\nHmmm~ it looks like someone was testing his BEE some 3 months ago, based on that\ntimestamp in the configuration.\n\nWell then, that is all I have. Come chat with me on Twitter if you have any idea how I can\nautomate this analysis; I seem to have done most stuff in the painful way :|\n\n**Network IOC:**\n\nti0wddsnv[.]wikimedia[.]vip:443\n\n**Host IOCs:**\n\nlog.dll — SHA256:\n8D1A5381492FE175C3C8263B6B81FD99AACE9E2506881903D502336A55352FEF\n\nlog.dll.dat — SHA256:\n0371FC2A7CC73665971335FC23F38DF2C82558961AD9FC2E984648C9415D8C4E\n\nScripts mentioned in this post are here:\n\n## GitHub - asuna-amawaka/SHADOWPAD-analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n### You can t perform that action at this time.
