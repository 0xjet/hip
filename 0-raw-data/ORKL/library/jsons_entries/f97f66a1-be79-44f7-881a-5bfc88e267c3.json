Various artifacts indicate that the main target\nof this campaign is IEC – Israel Electric Company. These include domains, file names, Java package names, and\nFacebook activity. We dubbed this campaign “Operation Electric Powder“.\n\n[Israel Electric Company (also known as Israel Electric Corporation) “is the largest supplier of electrical power in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Electric_Corporation)\nIsrael. The IEC builds, maintains, and operates power generation stations, sub-stations, as well as transmission and\ndistribution networks. The company is the sole integrated electric utility in the State of Israel. It installed generating\ncapacity represents about 75% of the total electricity production capacity in the country.”\n\nIt is notable that the operational level and the technological sophistication of the attackers are not high. Also, they\nare having hard time preparing decoy documents and websites in Hebrew and English. Therefore, in most cases a\nvigilant target should be able to notice the attack and avoid infection. We do not have indication that the attacks\nsucceeded in infecting IEC related computers or stealing information.\n\nCurrently we do not know who is behind Operation Electric Powder or what its objectives are. See further discussion\nin the Attribution section.\n\n## Impersonating Israeli news site\n\nThe attackers registered and used in multiple attacks the domain ynetnewes[.]com (note the extra e). This domain\nimpersonates ynetnews.com, the English version of ynet.co.il – one of Israel’s most popular news sites.\n\nCertain pages within the domain would load the legitimate Ynet website:\n\n\n-----\n\nOthers, which are opened as decoy during malware infection, had copied content from a different news site:\n\nThe URL ynetnewes[.]com/video/Newfilm.html contained an article about Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard copied from\nanother site. At the bottom was a link saying “Here For Watch It !”:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link pointed to goo[.]gl/zxhJxu (Google’s URL shortening service). According to the [statistics page, it had been](https://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/zxhJxu/all_time)\ncreated on September 25, 2016 and have been clicked only 11 times. When clicked, it would redirect to\n_iecr[.]co/info/index_info.php ._\n\nWe do not know what was the content in the final URL. We estimate that it served malware. The domain iecr[.]co\nwas used as a command and control server for other malware in this campaign.\n\nAnother URL,  http://ynetnewes[.]com/resources/assets/downloads/svchost.exe\n\nhosted a malware file called program_stream_film_for_watch.exe.\n[(d020b08f5a6aef1f1072133d11f919f8)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/6909674a3af0960675ca6184d890e0b294da4c66b9e512b35112474f58a4c900/analysis/)\n\n## Fake Facebook profile – Linda Santos\n\nOne of the above mentioned malicious URLs was spread via comments by a fake Facebook profile – Linda Santos\n[(no longer available):](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100012012675632)\n\nIn September 2016, the fake profile commented to posts by Israel Electric Company:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe profile had dozens of friends, almost all were IEC employees:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fake profile was following only three pages, one of which was the IEC official page:\n\n## Pokemon Go Facebook page\n\nIn July 2016, when mobile game “Pokemon Go” was at the peak of its popularity, the attackers created a Facebook\npage impersonating the official Pokemon Go page:\n\n[The page, which is no longer available, had about one hundred followers – most were Arab Israelis and some were](https://www.facebook.com/Pokemon-Go-1683341815318370/)\nJewish Israelis.\n\nOnly one post was published with text in English and Hebrew Grammatical mistakes indicate the attackers are not\n\n\n-----\n\nThe post linked to a malicious website hosted in yolasite.com (which is a legitimate website building and hosting\nplatform):\n\n**pokemonisrael.yolasite[.]com**\n\nThe button – “ומחשב טלפון להורדה” (literal translation – “To download phone and computer”) linked to a zip file in\nanother website:\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that the domain being impersonated is that of Israel Electric Company’s website (iec.co.il).\n\n[Pokemon-PC.zip (40303cd6abe7004659ca3447767e4eb7) contained Pokemon-PC.exe](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e5f3adf2e7d34a23f37e4ed754fd57f23d40f0bf67b12c6b9f854195362a75ab/analysis/)\n[(e45119a72677ed15ee0f04ef936a9803), which at run time drops monitar.exe](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/0ab1b7eeffdaeb0d554a6378e09728fed6cf8cb22b8e797e1570ec01843ab83b/analysis/)\n[(d3e0b129bad263e6c0dcb1a9da55978b):](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3a36bee1411da9ce3fd5a287ce43e8943e4b1fc5abe62926a0a3a9db9a4f2ee9/analysis/)\n\n## Android phone malware\n\nThe attackers also distributed a malicious app for Android devices – pokemon.apk\n[(3137448e0cb7ad83c433a27b6dbfb090).
