Once regarded as a\n“second-tier” cyber power, China has aggressively and consistently built its national cyber\nprogram to the point where it is now considered one of the world’s preeminent cyber players.\nA [recent study ranked China as a “Most Comprehensive Cyber Power,” second only to the](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/national-cyber-power-index-2020)\nUnited States. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used a multi-pronged strategy to\nachieve this remarkable ascent, prioritizing computer science and technology education\nwithin China and creating a pipeline of talent for cyber military operations.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, the U.S. government and its allies — including the EU, the Five Eyes\ncountries, and NATO — publicly condemned and blamed the PRC for a series of malicious\ncyberattacks, including the Microsoft Exchange Hacks, global ransomware attacks, and\ncyberattacks against medical research institutes and universities.\n\nAlong with this, the U.S. Department of Justice released an indictment in May (unsealed July\n16th) that charged four Chinese nationals with a campaign to hack into the computer\nsystems of dozens of companies, universities, and governmental entities around the world\nfrom 2011 to 2018. The nationals are believed to be members of the group tracked as\nAPT40, which is connected to the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) Hainan State\nSecurity Department (HSSD). The indictment alleges that China has been leading a\nworldwide hacking and economic espionage campaign, using cyberattacks to steal\nintellectual property in disregard of bilateral and multilateral agreements.\n\n### China targets Taiwanese finance institutions\n\nTLDR: In early February, [Symantec released a report detailing a persistent campaign by the](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/china-apt-antlion-taiwan-financial-attacks)\nChinese state-sponsored APT Antlion, targeting Taiwanese financial institutions for at least\n18 months. In the attacks, the threat actors deployed a backdoor dubbed xPack to maintain\nextensive access to victim systems, and the primary goal of the campaign is deemed to be\nespionage as researchers observed the threat actors exfiltrating data from infected\nnetworks.\n\nMore information: What is notable about the campaign is the extremely long dwell time of\nmany of the compromises that allowed the threat actors ample time for reconnaissance and\nexfiltration without detection. For example, in one of the undisclosed financial institution’s\nnetworks, the threat actors spent almost 250 days undetected in the network between\nDecember 2020 and August 2021, and spent over 175 days in another victim’s network\nundetected. The initial access vector is reportedly unclear, but researchers believe Antlion\nexploited a web application flaw to establish a foothold and drop xPack, which is then used\nto execute system commands, drop additional executables, and stage data for exfiltration.\nThe last activity seen in the campaign was August 2021.\n\n### APT15 Campaign Targeting Entities in Over 29 Countries\n\n\n-----\n\n[Microsoft has observed APT15 targeting governments, diplomatic entities, and NGOs in over](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/06/nickel-targeting-government-organizations-across-latin-america-and-europe/)\n29 countries across Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America.\n\nSince September 2019, APT15 has conducted activity across several countries, with a large\namount of activity targeting Central and South American governments. Using exploits against\nunpatched systems to compromise remote access services and applications, APT15\nleverages credential dumpers or stealers upon intrusion to obtain legitimate credentials,\nwhich they use to gain access to victim accounts. APT15 threat actors developed and\ndeployed custom malware that enabled them to maintain persistence on victim networks\nover extended periods of time. This has allowed it to achieve long-term access to multiple\ntargets, which it uses to perform frequent and scheduled data collection and exfiltration. In\nthe wake of discovering this campaign, Microsoft successfully obtained a court warrant that\nallowed it to seize 42 domains used by APT15 in the operations.\n\n### HAFNIUM Abuse of Log4Shell\n\n[Microsoft reports HAFNIUM is exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability to attack virtualization](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/)\ninfrastructure in order to extend their usual targeting.\n\nIn these attacks, Microsoft observed HAFNIUM-associated systems leveraging a DNS\nservice typically associated with testing activity to fingerprint systems.\n\n### Geopolitical\n\nTwitter [shuts down thousands of state-linked accounts in China that seek to counter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/xinjiang-twitter-closes-thousands-of-china-state-linked-accounts-spreading-propaganda)\nevidence of human rights abuses in Xinjiang\n\nIn early December, the U.S. [announces a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/6/us-announces-diplomatic-boycott-of-2022-beijing-olympics)\nOlympics in Beijing, citing “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”\n\n[China and Japan agree to set up a joint communication hotline by the end of 2022](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/asia/japan-china-military-hotline-intl-hnk/index.html)\namid tensions over Taiwan and issues in the East and South China seas.\n\nIn mid-December, U.S. Congress [passes a bill called The Uyghur Forced Labor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59692826)\nPrevention Act that requires companies to prove that goods imported from China's\nXinjiang region were not produced with forced labour.\n\n\n-----\n\nAround the same time Congress passes The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the\nU.S. [imposes trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/us-blacklists-34-chinese-entities-over-human-rights-abuses-brain-control-weapons.html)\nentities over human rights violations and the alleged development of biotechnology to\nsupport Chinese military end uses and end users, to include purported brain-control\nweaponry.\n\nThe U.S. department of commerce states China \"is choosing to use these\ntechnologies to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of\nethnic and religious minority groups.\"\n\n[U.S. intelligence agencies state Saudi Arabia is now actively manufacturing its own](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/23/politics/saudi-ballistic-missiles-china/index.html)\nballistic missiles with the help of China.\n\nThe U.S. is now concerned about whether Saudi's ballistic missile advancements\ncould change regional power dynamics and complicate efforts to discuss the\nnuclear deal with Iran.\n\n### TAG-28 attacks on Indian entities\n\nAs the bilateral relations between China and India continue to deteriorate over the Line of\nActual Control (LAC) dispute in the Galwan Valley, India has become the target of several\n[Chinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. Researchers at Recorded Future [PDF] have](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0921.pdf)\nidentified intrusions targeting Indian entities led by suspected Chinese state-sponsored\nthreat activity group TAG-28. The victims of these intrusions include Indian media\nconglomerate Bennett Coleman And Co Ltd (BCCL), a multimillion-dollar news organization\ncommonly known as “The Times Group” that consistently reports on the China-India war. It\nalso includes the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which contains the\nbiometric data of one billion Indian citizens, as well as the Madhya Pradesh Police\n[Department (MPP), whose Chief Minister was critical of China after the border clashes that](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/china-india-border-dispute-what-know)\noccurred in the Ladakh region in June 2020.\n\nIn this campaign, TAG-28 used Winnti malware, which is a family of malware that several\nChinese threat actors have historically used. In relation to the attack on BCCL, between\nFebruary and August 2021, four IPs were seen communicating with two Winnti C2 Servers\nand possibly a Cobalt Strike server, which led to approximately 500 MB of data being\nexfiltrated from the network. From June 10 to at least July 20, 2021, researchers observed\ntwo IPs registered to UIDAI communicating with the same suspected Cobalt Strike C2 server\nused to target BCCL. Less than 10 MB was egressed from the UIDAI network with an\ningress of almost 30 MB, potentially indicating the deployment of additional malicious tooling\nfrom the TAG-28 infrastructure. For the targeting of the MPP, the department’s website\nbegan communicating with a Winnti C2 server on June 1, 2021. Another MPP IP began\ntalking to the malicious server on July 7 to at least August 9, with around 5MB of data being\ntransferred.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Chinese APTs infiltrate major Afghan telecom provider\n\n[Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has detected separate intrusion activity linked to 4 distinct](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-APT-groups-target-afghan-telecommunications-firm/?__hstc=156209188.bb009bd700ffdb42f1bd71351aa875c2.1628778103997.1632758893662.1632844704571.22&__hssc=156209188.1.1632844704571&__hsfp=4085325968)\nChinese state-sponsored threat actors targeting a mail server of Roshan, one of\nAfghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers. The APTs are RedFoxtrot and Calypso\nAPT, and there are 2 additional clusters using the Winnti and PlugX backdoors that haven’t\n[been linked to groups yet. Data exfiltration activity for these intrusions, particularly the](https://therecord.media/suspected-chinese-state-linked-threat-actors-infiltrated-major-afghan-telecom-provider/)\nCalypso APT activity and the unknown threat actor using the Winnti malware, spiked\nthroughout August and September 2021, which coincided with major geopolitical events like\nthe withdrawal of US troops and the Taliban takeover.\n\nIt’s not clear from the latest research how the Roshan server was infected, but Chinese APT\nattacks often begin by exploiting external-facing services or spearfishing campaigns. Roshan\noffers a hugely valuable platform for strategic intelligence collection, allowing for things like\nthe monitoring of downstream targets, bulk collection of communication data, as well as the\nability to track and monitor individual targets. The Chinese government also considers the\ntelecom sector to be of strategic significance in countries participating in the Belt and Road\nInitiative. So there are many motives here.\n\n### Chinese espionage group targets critical infrastructure orgs in Southeast Asia\n\n[A Chinese cyber-espionage group has been identified targeting at least four critical](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/critical-infrastructure-south-east-asia-espionage)\ninfrastructure organizations in a southeast Asian country from November 2020 to March\n2021. Organizations targeted include a water company, a power company, a communications\n[company, and a defense organization, and researchers said they found evidence that the](https://therecord.media/chinese-espionage-group-targets-critical-infrastructure-orgs-in-southeast-asia/)\nattackers were interested in targeting information about SCADA systems.There is evidence\nthat the attacker behind this campaign is based in China, but there is not enough information\navailable to attribute the activity to a known actor. The threat actors made extensive use of\nliving-off-the-land / dual-use tools, including Windows Management Instrumentation,\nProcDump, PsExec, and Mimikatz. Espionage seems like the likeliest motive of these\nattacks, indicated by the activities of credential stealing, lateral movement, and keylogger\ndeployment as well as the types of machines targeted in some of the organizations - most of\nwhich were involved in design and engineering. An attacker gaining access to multiple critical\ninfrastructure organizations in the same country could potentially give them access to a vast\namount of sensitive information.\n\n### DeadRinger Campaign\n\n[Security researchers identified three distinct clusters of malicious activities operating on](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos#conclusion)\nbehalf of Chinese state interests, namely Gallium, APT 30/Naikon, and APT27 / Emissary\nPanda, in a campaign dubbed “DeadRinger.” In this campaign, the groups staged a series of\nattacks that targeted networks belonging to at least five major telecommunications\ncompanies located in Southeast Asia from 2017 to at least mid-2021. Researchers assess\n\n\n-----\n\nthat the goal behind these intrusions was to gain and maintain continuous access to\ntelecommunication providers and to facilitate cyber espionage against select targets. In this\ncampaign, there are three observed clusters of activity conducted over various time periods\nand deploying different malware. Overall, there has been an interesting overlap between\nthese clusters: they were all observed in the same target environment, around the same\ntimeframe, and even on the same endpoints. Overlaps in attacker TTPs across the clusters\nare evidence of a likely connection between the threat actors, and it is assumed that each\ngroup was tasked with parallel objectives in monitoring the communications of specific highvalue targets under the direction of a single Chinese body.\n\n### SparklingGoblin\n\n[ESET researchers recently discovered a new undocumented modular backdoor called](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nSidewalk, which has been linked to a new APT they are calling SparklingGoblin.\n[SparklingGoblin was first detected in May 2020 by researchers tracking the Winnti group,](https://threatpost.com/sparklinggoblin-apt/168928/)\naka APT41. Even though this campaign exhibited links to Winnti Group, the modus operandi\nwas quite different, leading researchers to start tracking it as a separate threat actor. The\nnew undocumented modular backdoor, Sidewalk, was used during SparklingGoblin’s recent\ncampaign targeting a computer retail company in the US. Sidewalk is a backdoor that\ndynamically loads additional modules sent from its C2 server, uses a Google Docs document\nas a dead drop resolver, and uses Cloudflare workers web services as a C2 server.\nSideWalk can collect information about running processes, write received data to file, and\ncall plugins received from the C2 server. SparklingGoblin has been very active from mid2020 to now and has targeted organizations mostly in East and Southeast Asia, but has\ntargeted a broad range of entities around the world including in the USA.\n\n### UNC 215 cyber espionage campaign in Israel\n\n[A cyber-espionage group based out of China called UNC215 has been identified conducting](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/08/unc215-chinese-espionage-campaign-in-israel.html)\na campaign against Israeli government entities, IT providers, and telecommunications\ncompanies since January 2019. UNC215 is linked with low confidence to APT27 and is said\nto target organizations that are of great interest to Beijing's financial, diplomatic, and strategic\nobjectives, demonstrating China's consistent strategic interest in the Middle East related to\nthe Belt and Road Initiative and interest in Israel’s robust technology sector. UNC215 has a\nhigh level of operational security: it makes a consistent effort to delete tools and any forensic\nartifacts from compromised systems; uses other victim networks to proxy its C2 instructions\nin order to evade detection and blend in with normal network traffic; and incorporates false\nflags. For example, on at least three occasions, UNC215 employed a custom tool leaked\n[from Iranian actors in order to deceive analysts and make it look like Iranian actors were](https://therecord.media/chinese-cyber-spies-targeted-israel-posing-as-iranian-hackers/)\nbehind the attacks.\n\n### HAFNIUM attacks on Microsoft Exchange servers\n\n\n-----\n\nDominating the headlines of Chinese cyber attacks is the on-premise Microsoft Exchange\nserver attack, presumed to be carried out by the Chinese APT HAFNIUM. This group has\nbeen identified as exploiting Exchange servers through a collection of several zero-day\nvulnerabilities. The supposed motive behind this attack aligns with the typical strategy of\nChinese cyber attacks: intellectual property theft. The four vulnerabilities affect unpatched\non-premise Microsoft Exchange servers - versions 2013 to 2019, excluding only Exchange\nOnline (Office365). You can read detailed IronNet analysis and response in our blog\n[\"HAFNIUM Targets Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Vulnerabilities.\"](https://www.ironnet.com/blog/hafnium-targets-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities)\n\n### LuminousMoth\n\nA Chinese APT, dubbed LuminousMoth by Kaspersky, was discovered spreading fake Zoom\nsoftware to spy on targets in South East Asia since at least October 2020. The earliest\nsightings of this currently ongoing campaign were in Myanmar, but the attackers now appear\nmuch more active in the Philippines and have an interest in targeting government entities.\nWith activities and tactics appearing to overlap with that of Mustang Panda, LuminousMoth\nuses two infection vectors in these attacks. The first provides initial access to a system\nthrough a spearphishing email containing a DropBox download link. The second infection\nvector comes after the first has succeeded, in which the malware attempts to spread by\ninfecting removable USB drives. The attackers deploy a post-exploitation tool that\nimpersonates Zoom software with a valid digital signature, using it to scan compromised\nsystems for files with pre-defined extensions that are then copied and transferred to a C2\nserver. On some compromised systems, the attackers also deployed another postexploitation tool that steals cookies from a Chrome browser for the purpose of hijacking and\nimpersonating the Gmail sessions of the targets. It is clear that the attacks of this campaign\nare very large-scale and affect a wide range of targets with the ultimate goal of compromising\na few that are of particular interest.\n\n### Tag-22\n\nIn July 2021, Recorded Future identified a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group\ntracked as Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22) targeting telecommunications, academia, R&D,\nand government organizations in Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The group\nwas first detected in September 2020 targeting a Hong Kong university and airport, but in\nJune 2021, TAG-22 was identified targeting the Industrial Technology Research Institute\n(ITRI) in Taiwan, Nepal Telecom, and the Department of Information and Communications\nTechnology in the Philippines. In this most recent campaign, TAG-22 used compromised\nGlassFish servers and Cobalt Strike for initial access before pivoting to Winnti, ShadowPad,\nand Spyder backdoors for long-term access using actor-controlled C2 infrastructure. Tracked\nas an independent activity cluster that overlaps with the wider network defined as Winnti\nGroup, TAG-22 leverages shared custom backdoors unique to Chinese state-sponsored\ngroups — including ShadowPad and Winnti — while also using open-source/offensive\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity tools like Cobalt Strike and Acunetix. The group s continued use of publicly reported\ninfrastructure indicates that it is experiencing a high degree of operational success despite a\nrange of public reporting regarding its operations.\n\n### IndigoZebra\n\nA Chinese APT group dubbed “IndigoZebra” has been identified conducting an ongoing\nspearphishing campaign against the Afghan government, impersonating the Afghan\npresident as a lure to infiltrate government agencies, leading to the compromise of the\nAfghan National Security Council (NSC). IndigoZebra has been observed targeting other\nCentral Asian countries as well, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, since at least 2014.\n\nIn IndigoZebra’s infection chain used in its attacks against the Afghan government, the threat\nactors begin with an email containing a malicious password-protected RAR archive (NSC\nPress conference.rar), which thwarts some sandbox solutions because it requires user\ninteraction. The RAR archive drops the extracted file (NSC Press conference.exe), which\nthen drops and executes the BoxCaon backdoor (spools.exe). The BoxCaon backdoor,\nwhich is a variant of the xCaon malware family, uses Dropbox as a command-and-control\n(C2) server, sending and receiving commands contained in a specific folder in an attackercreated Dropbox account. The threat actors’ use of Dropbox for C2 communications aids in\nmasking the malicious traffic in the victim’s network and appears as benign activity in user\nenvironments where Dropbox is used (Dropbox comes default on some Windows\ncomputers). The backdoor uses a hardcoded access token and has the ability to download,\nupload, and execute files. Other malware that the group has used in 2020-2021 (primarily\nagainst political entities in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) are hosted on ASN 20473 (CHOOPA)\nand Vultr - a subsidiary of CHOOPA that is commonly used for malicious purposes by\ncriminals and Chinese APTs.\n\n### Linux attacks / RedXOR\n\nIn most recent news, a new [sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers](https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/new-linux-backdoor-redxor-likely-operated-by-chinese-nation-state-actor/)\nwas discovered by security researchers at Intezer in early March, and TTPs indicate it is the\nwork of high-profile Chinese threat actors. Dubbed RedXOR, the backdoor masquerades as\na polkit daemon (which is a toolkit used for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate\n[with privileged processes), and it is very similar to malware associated with the Winnti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-state-hackers-target-linux-systems-with-new-malware/)\nUmbrella — a term used to describe a collective of state-backed hacking groups linked to\nChinese government interests. The operation is still believed to be ongoing as researchers\nexperienced an “on and off” availability of the C2 server, indicating that the operation is still\nactive. The [malware samples were first uploaded from Indonesia and Taiwan— two countries](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-state-hackers-target-linux-systems-with-new-malware/)\nknown to be heavily targeted by Chinese APTs. The samples were compiled with a legacy\nGCC compiler on an old version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, indicating that RedXOR is\nused in targeted attacks against legacy Linux systems. It is packaged with the usual suite of\ntools, including the ability to gather system information, perform file operations, run arbitrary\nshell commands and even options to remotely update the malware\n\n\n-----\n\nOf note: Victim types and motivations have not been indicated in reports, but the groups that\nfall under the Winnti Umbrella share an arsenal of malicious tools used in cyber espionage\nand financially motivated attacks and it has been stated that there has been a large increase\nin unique Linux malware tools tailored for espionage operations.\n\n### Additional China cyber attack threat campaigns\n\nTo summarize the threat at a more tactical level, the following sections highlight several of\nthe most recent and notable Chinese state-sponsored campaigns uncovered by\ncybersecurity researchers. Each section identifies a sample of the countries and sectors\ntargeted by a given group, and the behaviors or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nutilized to succeed in their objectives. Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed,\nreading.\n\n## APT31\n\n**Overview:**\n\nAPT31 is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage group focused primarily on acquiring\ninformation that can provide political, economic, and military advantages to the Chinese\ngovernment and state-owned enterprises. Active since at least 2013, APT31 conducts mainly\nintellectual property theft and espionage operations using a range of tools and techniques to\ninfect target systems, steal credentials, and move laterally within a compromised network.\nAPT31 targets numerous organizations in various sectors, often seeking intellectual property,\ninformation that provides a commercial advantage, or sensitive details about government\nand defense targets of interest.\n\n**Recent Activity:**\n\nSecurity researchers uncovered approximately 10 attacks carried out from January to July\n2021 by APT31, in which the group used a new dropper and targeted entities in the U.S.,\nCanada, Mongolia, Belarus, and Russia. APT31, also known as Judgement Panda and\nZirconium, has been active since at least 2016 and is known to provide data to the Chinese\n[government and enterprises for political, economic, and military advantages. PT Security](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/apt31-new-attacks/)\nwas able to link these attacks and the new dropper to APT31 because numerous overlaps\nwere found between these malware instances and APT31’s DropboxAES RAT trojan in\nrelation to functionality, techniques, and mechanisms used.\n\nOn July 21st, the French national cyber-security agency (CERT-FR) warned of an ongoing\ncampaign by Chinese-backed APT31 against a large number of French organizations.\nCERT-FR investigations show that in these attacks, APT31 compromises routers to leverage\nthem as anonymization relays before carrying out reconnaissance and attack activities. In\nother words, APT31 uses a network of compromised home routers as operational relay\n\n\n-----\n\nboxes to gather information and carry out further malicious actions. CERT-FR shared a list of\nIOCs to help entities assess potential compromises, and more information about the extent\nof these attacks will likely be made public by French authorities in the near future.\n\nIn February 2021, it was reported that APT31 cloned and used a Windows-hacking tool,\n[code-named EpMe, that was originally created by the Equation Group — an APT with links](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/equation-group)\nto various branches of the NSA. Essentially, APT31 extracted the core functionality of the\n[tool and created its own replication, known as “Jian” or “double-edged sword,” around the](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/the-story-of-jian/)\nexploits included in EpMe. What is concerning (and remarkable) about this reconstructed\nEpMe tool is that evidence points to the exploit first being used in 2014 — almost three years\n[before it became publicly available with the Shadow Brokers dump and was patched by](https://www.wired.com/story/china-nsa-hacking-tool-epme-hijack/)\nMicrosoft.\n\nJian was first discovered on a U.S.-based network by security researchers at Lockheed\nMartin, indicating that the tool has largely been used against U.S. targets. Evidence points to\nthe notion that APT31 managed to access both the 32-bit and 64-bit samples of the EpMe\nEquation Group exploit and replicate them to construct Jian, then using the new version of\nthe exploit alongside their unique multi-staged packer.

Incarnations of](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation.html)\nAPT41 began to appear in the early 2010s, and the group is believed to have been behind\nintrusions into a wide variety of sectors, including the healthcare, pharmaceutical,\ntelecommunications, and video game industries, with victims on nearly every continent. Over\nthe years, the group has leveraged a variety of custom malware, including a Trojan that\n[came to be known as Winnti.](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\n\nThe group is probably best known for a series of software supply chain attacks where the\nthreat actors obtain access to software provider systems and inject malicious code into the\nvictim’s legitimate software, often managing to distribute the poisoned software through the\nvictim’s established channels. Such attacks are especially challenging to detect and mitigate\nfrom a consumer perspective, as end users and system administrators invariably trust\nsoftware that has been downloaded directly from the publisher. Notably, some of the\nindividuals comprising APT41 appear to have engaged in not just state-sponsored\nespionage, but have also dabbled in operations designed to reap personal financial gain.\n\n[There is notable overlap and a significant lack of clarity within the commercial cybersecurity](https://risky.biz/whatiswinnti/)\ncommunity on precisely which groups are behind the many intrusions that have been lumped\ntogether under the Winnti umbrella. Some notable software supply chain attacks that have\nbeen potentially linked to the group by various cybersecurity researchers include the\n[CCleaner,](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/evidence-aurora-operation-still-active-part-2-more-ties-uncovered-between-ccleaner-hack-chinese-hackers/) [NetSarang, and](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) [Asus Live Update compromises. Given the history of software](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/)\ntool sharing amongst Chinese threat actors and the likelihood that multiple state-sponsored\nactors are targeting similar sets of victims, it becomes quite difficult to parse exactly which\ngroup may be behind a given intrusion, especially given the limited visibility that any one\nvictim or vendor may have. In any case, the overarching tactics and targets described above\ncan safely be ascribed to PRC cyber operators, regardless of how specifically each discrete\nintrusion can be attributed.\n\n**Recent Activity:**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn June 2021, Mandiant discovered a potential APT41 campaign targeting at least four U.S.\nstate governments in May 2021, in which they used three C2 servers, previously identified\nmalware, and multiple SQL injection attempts. Researchers suspect the group is targeting\nvulnerable internet-accessible servers of U.S. state government entities to gain initial access\nfor intrusion operations. There is currently an ongoing investigation of these intrusions, so\nthey have not been able to label a specific motive at this time; however, the direct targeting\nof U.S. state government entities is a concerning development given the nature of APT41\ncampaigns. This perhaps is an attempt to circumvent better prepared and/or resourced\nfederal agencies and to target state and local government for easier access to the same or\nsimilar material.\n\nIt was [revealed in June 2021 that APT41 is believed to be responsible for an almost three](https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/chinese-hackers-believed-to-be-behind.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheHackersNews+%28The+Hackers+News+-+Cyber+Security+Blog%29)\n[month long cyberattack against Air India.

After this initial\ncompromise, the APT41 threat actors acquired passwords and achieved persistence to\nmove laterally into the larger network with the objective of collecting information inside Air\nIndia's local network. Reportedly, at least 20 devices were compromised in the course of this\nlateral movement, and the attackers managed to use hashdump and mimikatz to exfiltrate\nNTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local systems. All in all, APT41 was able to\nextract almost 24 MB of information from five devices, taking just over 24 hours to spread\nCobalt Strike beacons to other systems in Air India’s network.\n\n[Another large-scale APT41 campaign occurred in early 2020, once again affecting a wide](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html)\nvariety of industries in multiple global regions. The operators appeared to be systemically\nleveraging a number of recently identified high severity vulnerabilities, specifically in Cisco\nrouters, Citrix infrastructure devices, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central, an endpoint\nmanagement software tool. Notably, the Citrix and Zoho vulnerabilities were also highlighted\n[in a recent NSA advisory detailing public technical vulnerabilities known to have been](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF)\nactively exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also shone a light on APT41 in September of 2020,\n[unsealing three indictments that brought charges against five Chinese nationals and two](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nMalaysians for a sweeping series of network intrusions. The DOJ linked the activity to a\nChinese company known as Chengdu 404 Network Technology, which likely operates at the\nbehest of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. The indictments stated that the hackers\nwere responsible for intrusions across over 100 victim organizations in numerous countries.\nOne of the indictments charged the two Malaysian individuals with profiting from information\nstolen from video game companies that was provided to them by Chinese actors. Both men\nwere apprehended by Malaysian authorities. The operators apparently also participated in\nransomware and crypto-jacking attacks, which highlight the type of for-profit criminal\nendeavors the group has undertaken apart from their more traditional information gathering\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Known**\n**Targets**\n\n**Sample**\n**TTPs**\n\n\nNumerous sectors, including healthcare, media, and video games with multiple\ncountries targeted, including the U.S., Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and\nthe U.K.\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks which modified legitimate software to\nfacilitate intrusions against the software’s customers\nUse of stolen digital certificates to sign malware\nCommand and control (C2) dead drops leveraging seemingly legitimate\nweb pages to surreptitiously pass encoded instructions to deployed\nmalware\nExploitation of remote access or internet facing services to gain initial\naccess to victim networks\n\n\n**AKA** Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda, Wicked Spider\n\n## APT40\n\n**Overview:**\n\n[Likely active since at least 2013, APT40 is a Chinese threat group with a predominant focus](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor.html)\non nations and issues related to the South China Sea, a region the PRC has claimed\n[territorial sovereignty over despite numerous disputes.

The group has\nleveraged a variety of malicious software, including publicly available tools such as Cobalt\nStrike and custom tools, some of which overlap with other known Chinese groups. Analysis\nof data obtained from APT40 infrastructure showed malware administrators accessing the\ngroup’s servers from Hainan, China, which strongly suggests Chinese state sponsorship\nwhen coupled with the group’s targeting patterns.\n\n**Recent Activity:**\n\nRecent analysis released by Microsoft indicates that APT40 threat actors have on multiple\n[occasions attempted to use cloud-native services within Azure to conduct malicious C2.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/09/24/gadolinium-detecting-empires-cloud/)\nAlthough the activity was identified and disrupted, the threat actors appear to have\nspecifically designed malware to abuse proprietary cloud services including the Outlook Task\nAPI, OneDrive API, and Microsoft Graph API.\n\n[APT40 was also among the Chinese groups Taiwan publicly accused of targeting multiple](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3098012/mainland-chinese-hackers-attacked-government-agencies-steal)\nTaiwanese government agencies, alongside BlackTech, Mustang Panda, and other groups.\nThis coincides with particularly aggressive Chinese cyber targeting of Taiwan’s technology\n\n\n-----\n\nsector witnessed over the past couple years.

The group has also been noted targeting Western think tanks and\nNGOs with a nexus to Chinese minority groups. The group has likely been active since at\nleast 2017.\n\n[Mustang Panda frequently relies on phishing lures centered around themes directly relevant](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\nto their targeted victims. These lures use official-looking documents written in the target’s\nnative language and containing information that would prompt the victim to open the\nattached document. These decoy documents frequently contain a .zip archive that executes\na malicious loader when opened. This leads to the installation of the venerable PlugX\nmalware or a Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\n**Recent Activity:**\n\n[In the summer of 2020, Recorded Future reported newly identified activity related to Mustang](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)\nPanda, which they track as RedDelta. Notably, the group targeted a number of organizations\nrelated to the Catholic Church.

These two campaigns share a number of tactics, including the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta410-group-behind-lookback-attacks-against-us-utilities-sector-returns-new)\ntimeframes they were active, the use of malicious attachments contained in phishing emails,\nthe installation techniques used, and overlapping infrastructure. Like LookBack, the\nFlowCloud campaign appears to have targeted victims in the utilities sector using wellcrafted phishing emails impersonating professional organizations within the industry such as\nthe American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\nNotably, the researchers investigating TA410 identified similarities to the tactics used by\nTA429 (also known as APT10: see below). However, it is not fully clear whether the two\ngroups’ activity is truly related or whether this may have been a deliberate attempt by those\n\n\n-----\n\nresponsible to plant false flags to help hide those behind the campaigns.

The group’s focus appears to be access enablement, providing](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Chinese-Cyber-Activity-Targeting-Managed-Service-Providers.pdf)\ninroads to support commercial and economic espionage against regional and international\ncompetitors including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Like so many\nthreat groups, APT10 has historically used spearphishing tactics to gain initial footholds on\nvictim networks. The operators then rely upon a combination of custom and publicly available\nhacking tools to move laterally throughout victim networks and establish persistence.\n\nIn 2017, [details surrounding an APT10 campaign known as Operation Cloud Hopper came to](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-report-final-v4.pdf)\nlight. The campaign focused on compromising IT managed service providers (MSPs), which\nare businesses that remotely manage IT infrastructure on behalf of their clients.\nCompromising these MSPs provided APT10 actors with access to the service providers as\nwell as their customers. The MSPs’ connections to their customer environments were at\n[times used by APT10 to exfiltrate data from within customer environments. 2018 indictments](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nby the U.S. Department of Justice revealed that those behind these campaigns worked for a\ncompany operating at the behest of the Ministry of State Security’s Tianjin State Security\n[Bureau. Later media reporting revealed just how widespread and successful this strategy](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-cyber-cloudhopper/)\nhad been, as several major MSPs appear to have been victimized by the group over the\nspan of several years.\n\n[Additional reporting in 2019 asserted that APT10 actors had penetrated at least ten](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers)\ntelecommunications or cellular provider companies across the globe in a campaign dubbed\nOperation Soft Cell. During this campaign, APT10 operators appeared to have been\ntargeting Call Detail Records which contain metadata regarding individual mobile\n\n\n-----\n\nsubscribers including information such as device identifiers, locations, and call history. Such\ninformation would be considered highly useful to a foreign intelligence service and fits with\nAPT10’s history of facilitating access to sensitive datasets.\n\n**Recent Activity:**\n\nAn A41APT campaign, attributed to APT10, is noted to be a sophisticated campaign that\ndeploys malicious backdoors to exfiltrate information from a number of Japan-linked\ncompanies in different industry sectors across the world. The activity was first detected in\nMarch 2019, carrying out through December 2020, with latest attacks said to have occurred\nin January 2021 and JPCERT/CC stating attacks are still ongoing. The campaign includes a\nmulti-stage attack process, with initial intrusion happening via the exploitation of\nvulnerabilities in Pulse Connect Secure, a widely used SSL-VPN, in order to hijack VPN\nsessions. In this campaign, APT10 uses previously undocumented malware, most notable of\nwhich is one particular piece of malware called Ecipekac, which is a multi-layer loader\nmodule used to deliver as many as 3 payloads, such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAnti.\nIronNet has created TIRs related to this campaign and pushed them to customer\nenvironments.\n\n[In addition, published research details continued cyber espionage activity being conducted](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)\nby APT10 operators. This latest research provides evidence of yet another large-scale\nintrusion campaign targeting multiple global regions and sectors between Fall 2019 and Fall\n2020. Most of the victims appear to have a connection to Japanese companies, with the\nautomotive, pharmaceutical, and engineering sectors among those targeted. The campaign\nonce again went after MSPs, the group’s most favored target. During the campaign, APT10\nwas observed using a variety of dual-use and custom malware, extensively using DLL sideloading techniques to execute their malware and exploiting the recently publicized\nZeroLogon vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows systems.\n\n\n**Known**\n**Targets**\n\n**Sample**\n**TTPs**\n\n\nTelecommunications, defense, construction, engineering, aerospace, and\ngovernment sectors (among others) in the U.S., Europe, and Japan with a\nconsistent focus on MSPs\n\nSpearphishing using malicious attachments\nDLL side-loading techniques\n[Use of publicly available, quasi-legitimate remote access tool Quasar](https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT)\nUse of various shared Chinese malware families, including Poison Ivy and\nPlugX\nPersistent targeting of MSPs for use as conduits to their customer\nnetworks\n\n\n**AKA** TA429, Menupass, Red Apollo, Stone Panda, Cicada\n\n\n-----\n\n## Collective Defense against China cyber attack threats\n\nAs evidenced by the numerous examples of Chinese cyber campaigns waged against\ncommercial, government, and nongovernmental entities around the world, it is clear that\nChina has made cyber espionage a hallmark of its global strategy. Chinese leadership has\nfocused massive resources on building out their nation’s cyber capabilities to both secure the\nCommunist Party’s preeminence within the country and project power beyond its borders.\nOrganizations working in an immensely broad number of fields have been targeted, ranging\nfrom renewable energy to nanotechnology to human rights. These broad and persistent\ntargeting patterns are likely to continue the years to come.\n\nChinese tactics, techniques, and procedures have grown in sophistication as well. Once well\nknown for executing “smash and grab” operations seeking to simply steal large amounts of\ndata from their victims as quickly as possible, Chinese threat groups have since evolved. As\nthe case studies above highlight, Chinese threat actors now seek new and novel ways to\nexecute their attacks and hide them from network defenders. Innovation and collaboration\nhave thus become paramount for defenders to identify and prevent such threats.\n\nIronNet’s mission is to provide companies, sectors, and nations with the cutting-edge tools\nrequired to defend against sophisticated threats in cyberspace.
