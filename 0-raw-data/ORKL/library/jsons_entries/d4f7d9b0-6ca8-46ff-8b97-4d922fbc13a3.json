While analyzing the technical\ndetails of this malware, which includes two new espionage backdoors, we noticed striking\nsimilarities to other malware attributed to the threat actor known as APT37, also known as\nReaper or Group 123.\n\nBy: William Gamazo Sanchez December 15, 2020 Read time: ( words)\n\nDetermining who is behind a malware campaign can be a challenging endeavor. Threat\nactors generally don’t leave easily identifiable signatures in software designed to disrupt or\notherwise harm an adversary. However, by comparing key pieces of information with known\nsources, it is possible to determine when a campaign was likely perpetrated by a certain\ngroup. This is even more true when the group has existed for many years and has many\n[pieces of evidence to compare. Recently, we uncovered the Operation Earth Kitsune](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-earth-kitsune-tracking-slub-s-current-operations)\ncampaign and published a detailed analysis of its tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs). While analyzing the technical details of this malware, which includes two new\n\n\n-----\n\nespionage backdoors, we noticed striking similarities to other malware attributed to the threat\nactor known as [APT37, also known as Reaper or Group 123. We hope our thorough analysis](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-37)\nof Operation Earth Kitsune will help others with data points for attribution in the future.\n\nBy some accounts, this group has been active since 2012, so there are many examples\nattributed to them to compare. It is important to note that previous analysis of suspected\n[APT37 activities from different security vendors date from 2016, and the captured samples](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067/)\nfor the Operation Earth Kitsune have been developed recently. Because of this, finding code\nsimilarity is unlikely. However, we were able to match some code reuse in one of the\nespionage backdoor’s functionalities. In that sense, we are emphasizing TTPs correlation in\nthis case. In other words, even when the new samples are developed, the attacker may have\nreused many of the operational techniques.\n\nAnother important consideration for attribution is that we have some historical background for\nOperation Earth Kitsune. Previously, we uncovered two different campaigns in 2019 under\nthe name of SLUB malware. Operation Earth Kitsune is a continuation of those campaigns.\nConsequently, some of the attribution indicators will span and include the previous SLUB\nmalware campaigns.\n\nThe following sections describe the different correlations and are divided into two main\ncategories:\n\nCorrelation related to the malware author developing environment\nCorrelation associated with TTPs\n\nNote that some leads are stronger than others; however, when combined, they suggest that\nthe same threat actor behind malware previously attributed to APT37 is likely responsible for\nOperation Earth Kitsune.\n\n### Malware author’s developer environment\n\nWhen determining attribution, the most interesting leads are the ones that can deduce\ninformation about the malware author’s working environment. Sometimes, these leads can\ndetermine the preferred languages used in the developers’ environment. There are also\ntimes when developers intentionally remove these associations and plant misleading\ninformation to avoid attribution. That action by itself potentially introduces other leads that\ndevelopers may forget to clean.\n\n**Operating system language version**\n\nDuring the analysis of the samples captured from the previous campaign related to SLUB in\n2019, one of the samples, the SLUB loader exploiting CVE-2019-0803, contained a version\nresource section that included intentionally misleading planted data. Figure 1 shows this:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Planted version information\nThis kind of misleading version data is quite common and does not have information relevant\nto attribution. However, there is a secondary effect when the version resource is added to a\nbinary. For this, we are assuming this binary was compiled with a Visual Studio toolchain,\nwhich is indicated for various compiler identification tools. When the version resource is\ncompiled into the binary, a language ID is generated and created not in the resource payload\nbut in the internal structure of the resource information that is not visible with Windows\nExplorer. What is interesting is that this language ID is not determined by the Visual Studio\ncurrent language. Instead, it is determined by the operating system language at the time of\nthe version resource inclusion. Viewing this language ID requires the use of other tools.\nFigure 2 shows the language ID for the SLUB dropper.\n\nFigure 2. Language ID of the Version Resource\nWe found this type of OS language leak in prior samples attributed to APT37. One of the\n[previous malware families attributed to APT37 is known as Freenki. Some Freenki samples](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.freenki)\nhad leaked the OS language ID through this same mechanism. The image (Figure 3) taken\nfrom an analysis of Freenki shows that the same logic applies when the resource is compiled\ninto the binary.\n\nFigure 3. Freenki embedded resource\nWe assume there are multiple developers within APT37, and not all of them follow the same\npractices. As such, not all samples may have the embedded resource that leaks the same\nOS language. However, this commonality is just the first of many that lead us to believe the\nteam attributed to the Freenki malware is the same team behind Operation Earth Kitsune.2\n\n**Leaked assert path and external blog references**\n\n\n-----\n\nSometimes, the malware authors know that releasing symbol information is dangerous from\nan attribution point of view since it can reveal information about the working environment.\nThat information often gets stripped from binaries. However, that is not the only scenario\nwhere malware developers leak path information about their environment. In some\ninstances, malware projects require external libraries, and some libraries used the “assert()”\nmechanism to help the developers debug unexpected conditions. In these cases, the\ncompiler includes a path to the source code file along with those “assert()” calls. These paths\nleak information about the third-party libraries’ installed paths. In our case, the samples from\nthe Operation Earth Kitsune implemented the Mattermost command and control (C2)\ncommunication and leaked a local path. Figure 4 shows the leaked path.\n\nFigure 4. Leaked assert() path\n[Public references to this path (the path to the c++ boost library) consist of Korean language](https://www.boost.org/)\nblogs explaining how to set up a developer environment configuration using the same path.\nWe can also determine that this configuration was created manually because the default\npath installation does not support static compilation. Here is a translation of the relevant\nsection:\n\n_“Well, in the end, I modified the project configuration file as below, but it doesn't seem like_\n_best practice. There seems to be a neat way to do it, but I seek advice from experienced_\n_people.”_\n\nIt is also important to note that the same paths leaked through all the SLUB samples. This\nincludes samples from the older SLUB campaign in 2019 and the new version that supports\nMattermost.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Public blog in the Korean Language\nThese two indicators reveal that the malware author used an “assert()” path and referenced\nan external blog in the same manner as previously analyzed malware.\n\nTTPs Correlation\n\n\n-----\n\nIn our previous detailed analysis of Operation Earth Kitsune, one of the delivery architecture\nfor the espionage backdoors is designed as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Delivery architecture\nWhile this mechanism may sound quite common in other campaigns, what is interesting is\nthe details they have in common with previous campaigns attributed to APT37. In 2017, Palo\n[Alto’s Unit 42 detailed their findings around the Freenki malware. Even though this analysis](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-freemilk-highly-targeted-spear-phishing-campaign/#:~:text=In%20May%202017%2C%20Palo%20Alto,various%20individuals%20across%20the%20world.&text=individuals%20with%20indirect%20ties%20to%20a%20country%20in%20North%20East%20Asia)\nwas three years before Operation Earth Kitsune, the attackers appear to have reused the\nsame TTPs for delivering the malware.\n\nFigure 7 shows delivery PowerShell script sections for both campaigns.\n\nFigure 7. PowerShell scripts downloading JPG files\nThe following TTPs are common in both campaigns related to the scripts in Figure 7:\n\nBoth have compromised websites where the malware samples are hosted and\ndelivered to victim machines.\nBoth use PowerShell scripts to download and run the samples.\nBoth PowerShell scripts download multiple malware to the victim machine. It appears\nthe attacker is willing to implement multiple mechanisms for infecting the victim\nmachine once it is compromised.\nBoth use different samples for the multiple malware downloaded.\nBoth use JPG as a delivering extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nMultiple samples are delivered at the same time. In both cases, at least one sample\nreceived command line arguments.\n\nAnother surprising similarity in the TTPs related to both campaigns is the path pointing to\n“udel_ok.ipp,” as shown in Figure 7. This is a JavaScript file that executes with wscript.exe.\nFigure 8 shows the partial source code for this JavaScript.\n\nFigure 8. Javascript executing the malware.\nWhat got our attention is that the samples were renamed to be similar to the naming\nconvention of Windows update files (i.e., “Windows-KB275122-x86.exe”). While analyzing\nthe samples that have been previously attributed to APT37, we noticed that the persistence\nmechanism in Operation Earth Kitsune uses the same naming convention to auto-start itself\nthrough the Windows run registry key. We also found that older samples from the previous\nSLUB campaigns in 2019 used a similar naming convention. Figure 9 shows that SLUB used\n“Windows-RT-KB-2937636.dll,” while Freenki used “Windows-KB275122-x86.exe.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 Naming convention for persistence.\nWe can see how the Freenki malware, previous SLUB campaigns, and Operation Earth\nKitsune share many common TTPs in their delivery and persistence mechanisms. However,\nthese are not the only commonalities. Again, on its own, this might not be coincidental.\nHowever, our analysis shows further similarities that imply correlation.\n\n### GNUBoard compromised web sites\n\nIn the blog describing Operation Earth Kitsune, we noted sites using the GNUBoard Content\nManagement System (CMS) had been compromised and were used to host malware. The\nmalware campaigns previously attributed to APT37 also extensively used the exploitation of\nweb sites hosted with GNUBoard CMS. While analyzing multiple samples, we found\nindicators of this strategy across the various campaigns. Figure 10 shows an example\nattributed to APT37 and Operation Earth Kitsune as a comparison. The SLUB campaign also\nexploited and used GNUBoard websites as part of the infrastructure.\n\nFigure 10. Websites created using GNUBoard CMS\n\n\n-----\n\n### Exfiltration commands\n\nAs mentioned in the previous report on Operation Earth Kitsune, one of the espionage\nbackdoors, named agfSpy, received a “JSON” configuration with a list of native Windows\ncommands to execute. The output of those commands is exfiltrated back to the agfSpy\ncommand and control (C2) server. While analyzing one malware previously attributed to\nAPT37, it executed practically the same command sequences including the paths and\nextensions. Even when the threat actor was not using the “JSON” format, the commands\nembedded in the various samples show a surprising amount of similarities. Figure 11 shows\na comparison of the exfiltration commands between malware previously attributed to APT37\nand Operation Earth Kitsune. Note the following similarities:\n\nThe usage of paths C:\\Users and D:\\ are similar\nThe searching patterns are very similar\nThe extension list is very similar\n\nNote that we are comparting a sample from 2016 with agfSpy, which is from 2020. It makes\nsense that new campaigns coming from the same authors/groups will add new extensions\nlike “.xlsx” to support updated versions of Office documents. It is also clear that the actual\ninterest is on the “.hwp” extension for Korean Office document listing support during\nexfiltration.\n\nFigure 11. Exfiltration command similarities.\n\n### Code sharing\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen doing attribution, finding code sharing between different samples is one of the most\ndesired discoveries. However, in our case, this was difficult as we are comparing samples\nfrom 2016-2017 to those developed in 2020. At the same time, practically all code for the\nSLUB malware was created from scratch. Also, dneSpy and agfSpy are based on custom\nand newly developed code. That makes it difficult to match code similarities, and that is why\nmany of the indicators of code sharing are sparse across different samples.\n\nHowever, one feature that is present in the previous malware attributed to APT37 and\nOperation Earth Kitsune is the screenshot capture. We tried to find how this feature evolved\nacross previous samples and the older SLUB samples. During the analysis, we found a clear\nindication of code sharing for the screenshot functionality. Figure 12 shows a comparison\nbetween the two samples. While this code may have some related “internet code sharing\npost” origin, both samples share it. They also have some changes that make sense, such as\nremoving the error “failed to take…,” since this is not required for the malware functionality. It\nis likely a late refactor to the code.\n\nFigure 12. Screenshot functionality comparison between SLUB and APT37\n\n### Working Hours\n\nAnalyzing the compile time of binaries between different samples can also provide a level of\ncorrelation between samples. While malware authors can fake this, useful information can\nstill be gleaned with enough samples. In our case, we collected many samples across 2020,\n\n\n-----\n\nand we found that the compile dates and times follow a logical timeline according to the\nmalicious activity. Based on our analysis, we believe the malware author did not fake the\ncompile times of the binaries. Other public references also used the compiled binary time of\nsamples attributed to APT37. When compared to the compile times seen in Operation Earth\nKitsune, there are several similarities.\n\nThe compile times that are listed on binaries provide an estimate of the threat actor's working\nhours and help approximate possible time zones where the malware was developed. It is fair\nto assume that the developers work on daily working times. When you have many samples\nto analyze, you can refine that expectation over time. Figure 14 (below) shows a raw\ncomparison across many samples using two time zones. We can see how the UTC+9 time\nzone matches those previously attributed to APT37 and those from Operation Earth Kitsune.\nThese both equate to the daily working times for that time zone.\n\nFigure 13. Compile Time APT73 and Kitsune\nDuring the capture of samples for Operation Earth Kitsune, we managed to dump information\n[about the Mattermost server using its API and the token used by the malware itself.](https://mattermost.com/)\nMattermost was being used as a C2 channel for the malware. Part of the dumped\ninformation contained the action of the user with administration roles on the system. That\nuser was doing manual activities the majority of the time. At the same time, we were able to\nlocate the Mattermost server hosted in Greece, and that gave us the current time zone of the\nMattermost server. Having that reference, we plotted the actions of all users whose\ninformation we could obtain. It is important to remember that, except for the administrator\nuser, all other accounts were used as part of the malware deployment (SLUB malware).\nFigure 15 shows a plot with “Y” representing the number of actions. For example, an action\nfor the SYSTEM_ADMIN could be to create a user, add a user to a channel, etc. The “X” axis\nrepresents the hour of the day (in 24 hours). No months are plotted, so this figure is like\ncompressing all the activity across the full 2020-year in one day just to show the active hours\nin a day. All the plots are located in UTC+9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Mattermost server activity.\nFigure 15 shows that User_3 and User_4 have like random counts. This is because those\naccounts are actually the ones the malware used during the infection logging activities to the\nMattermost server. However, the SYSTEM_ADMIN account has a different pattern because\nthe actions are mostly due to manual administration activities. Unsurprisingly, the\nSYSTEM_ADMIN hours perfectly line up with the daily working hours at UTC+9.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWhile no attribution is perfect, there are striking similarities between the malware attributed\nto APT37 and Operation Earth Kitsune. Little can be gleaned from each individual piece, but\nwhen viewed as a whole, the group behind Operation Earth Kitsune is likely the same one\nbehind the Freenki malware and other malware campaigns attributed to APT37. This is\nsomewhat surprising, considering Operation Earth Kitsune’s espionage tools were entirely\nfresh-developed.\n\nWe can summarize the correlated indicators in a general form as:\n\nUse of Korean language in the system environment of the developers\nReuse of multiple TTPs during operation deployments:\nGNUBoard compromised web sites\nMultiple malware samples deployed at the same time\nA similar organization in the deployment architecture\nReliance on public services and watering hole attacks to compromised victims\nSome code reuse, even when the samples are completely different otherwise\nWorking hours for both matches\nExfiltration techniques and information interest are very similar if not fully matched\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it is always possible for another group to imitate the TTPs of a different group to\nconfuse attribution, there does not seem to be any indication of that here. Instead, what we\nsee in SLUB and Operation Earth Kitsune is the evolution of an advanced threat actor over\ntime: one that builds on what worked in the past to become more efficient in the present.\n\n\n-----",
