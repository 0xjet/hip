This tool is often abused by\nransomware attackers as a reconnaissance tool, as well as to equip the attackers with the\n\n\n-----\n\nresources that they need for lateral movement via Active Directory. Just days after the\nsuspicious AdFind activity was observed on the victim organization, the attackers attempted\nto deploy the Yanluowang ransomware.\n\nBefore the ransomware is deployed on a compromised computer, a precursor tool carries out\nthe following actions:\n\nCreates a .txt file with the number of remote machines to check in the command line\nUses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to get a list of processes running\non the remote machines listed in the .txt file\nLogs all the processes and remote machine names to processes.txt\n\nFigure 1. Yanluowang stops multiple services on compromised computers\nThe Yanluowang ransomware is then deployed and carries out the following actions:\n\nStops all hypervisor virtual machines running on the compromised computer\nEnds processes listed in processes.txt, which includes SQL and back-up solution\nVeeam\nEncrypts files on the compromised computer and appends each file with the\n.yanluowang extension\n\n\n-----\n\nDrops a ransom note named README.txt on the compromised computer\n\nFigure 2. Yanluowang ends the SQL and Veeam processes before encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\nYanluowang uses the Windows API for encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransom note dropped by Yanluowang warns victims not to contact law enforcement or\nransomware negotiation firms. If the attackers’ rules are broken the ransomware operators\nsay they will conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the victim, as well\nas make “calls to employees and business partners.” The criminals also threaten to repeat\nthe attack “in a few weeks” and delete the victim’s data.\n\nFigure 4.
