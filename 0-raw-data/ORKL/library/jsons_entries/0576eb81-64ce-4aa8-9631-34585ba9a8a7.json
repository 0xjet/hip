(Source Images: belterz, EThamPhoto and BardoczPeter/\nGetty Images)\n\n## Experts say a recent wave of pro-Putin disinformation is consistent with the work of Russia’s Internet Research Agency, a network of paid trolls who attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our\nbiggest stories as soon as they’re published.\n\nJust before 11 a.m. Moscow Standard Time on March 1, after a night of Russian strikes on\nKyiv and other Ukrainian cities, a set of Russian-language Twitter accounts spread a lie that\nUkraine was fabricating civilian casualties.\n\nOne account created last year, @Ne_nu_Che, shared a video of a man standing in front of\nrows of dark gray body bags that appeared to be filled with corpses. As he spoke to the\ncamera, one of the encased bodies behind him lifted its arms to stop the top of the bag from\nblowing away. The video was taken from [an Austrian TV report about a climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o3Rph8DcUY)\ndemonstration held in Vienna in February. But @Ne_nu_Che claimed it was from Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFour Russian-language Twitter accounts posted a video that they claimed showed Ukrainian\nmedia had faked reports of civilian casualties. It is actually an unrelated clip from an Austrian\nTV report in February. The accounts were later removed by Twitter for violating its platform\nmanipulation and spam policy. Credit: Screenshots captured by ProPublica\n“Propaganda makes mistakes too, one of the corpses came back to life right as they were\ncounting the deaths of Ukraine’s civilians,” the tweet said.\n\n### Get Our Top Investigations\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nArrow Right\n**Thanks for signing up.

One of the ‘corpses’ came back to life during a segment about civilian deaths\nin the Ukraine. Information war is reaching a new level,” they said.\n\nTwo other accounts created last fall within a few days of @Enot_Kremle_Bot soon shared\nthe same video and accusations of fake civilian casualties. “Ukrainian propaganda does not\nsleep,” said one.\n\nThe Twitter profiles are part of a pro-Putin network of dozens of accounts spread across\nTwitter, TikTok and Instagram whose behavior, content and coordination are consistent with\nRussian troll factory the Internet Research Agency, according to Darren Linvill, a Clemson\nUniversity professor who, along with another professor, Patrick Warren, has spent years\nstudying IRA accounts.\n\nThe IRA burst into the American consciousness after its paid trolls used thousands of\nEnglish-language accounts across social media platforms to influence American voters\nduring the 2016 presidential election. The IRA was at the center of a 2018 Department of\nJustice criminal indictment for its alleged effort to “interfere with elections and political\nprocesses.”\n\n“These accounts express every indicator that we have to suggest they originate with the\nInternet Research Agency,” Linvill said. “And if they aren’t the IRA, that’s worse, because I\ndon’t know who’s doing it.”\n\nAn analysis of the accounts’ activity by the Clemson Media Forensics Hub and ProPublica\nfound they posted at defined times consistent with the IRA workday, were created in the\nsame time frame and posted similar or identical text, photos and videos across accounts and\nplatforms. Posts from Twitter accounts in the network dropped off on weekends and Russian\nholidays, suggesting the posters had regular work schedules.\n\nMany of the accounts also shared content from facktoria.com, a satirical Russian website\nthat began publishing in February. Its domain registration records are private, and it’s unclear\nwho operates it. Twitter removed its account after being contacted by ProPublica.\n\nRussian Twitter Accounts That Disseminated Propaganda Posted Mostly During Working\nDays\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Twitter sees relatively constant use throughout the week, these accounts posted\nmostly during Russian working days.\n\nweekdays\n\nweekends\n\n400 posts\n\nRussian New\n\nYear Holiday\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\nDec. 18,\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nJan. 1\n\nFeb. 1\n\nMar. 3,\n\n2022\n\nweekdays\n\nweekends\n\n400 posts\n\n\n-----\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\nFeb. 1\n\nDec. 18,\n\n2021\n\nJan. 1\n\nMar. 3,\n\n2022\n\nNote: Data includes posts on Twitter from 28 accounts identified in the Clemson Media\nForensics Hub and ProPublica analysis as exhibiting coordinated or bot-like behavior. The\naccounts were removed by Twitter. Source: Twitter. Credit: Jeff Kao/ProPublica\nThe pro-Putin network included roughly 60 Twitter accounts, over 100 on TikTok, and at least\nseven on Instagram, according to the analysis and removals by the platforms. Linvill and\nWarren said the Twitter accounts share strong connections with a set of hundreds of\n[accounts they identified a year ago as likely being run by the IRA. Twitter removed nearly all](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2021-03-24/real-target-authoritarian-disinformation)\nof those accounts. It did not attribute them to the IRA.\n\nThe most successful accounts were on TikTok, where a set of roughly a dozen analyzed by\nClemson researchers and ProPublica racked up more than 250 million views and over 8\nmillion likes with posts that promoted Russian government statements, mocked President\nJoe Biden and shared fake Russian fact-checking videos that were revealed by ProPublica\nand Clemson researchers earlier this week. On Twitter, they attacked jailed Russian\nopposition leader Alexei Navalny and blamed the West for preventing Russian athletes from\ncompeting under the Russian flag in the Olympics.\n\nLate last month, the network of accounts shifted to focus almost exclusively on Ukraine,\nechoing similar narratives and content across accounts and platforms. A popular post by the\naccount @QR_Kod accused the Ukrainian military of using civilians as human shields.\nAnother post by @QR_Kod portrayed Ukraine as provoking Russia at the behest of its NATO\nmasters. Both tweets received hundreds of likes and retweets and were posted on the same\nday as the body bag video. At least two Twitter accounts in the network also shared fake\nfact-checking videos.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nTwitter accounts such as @QR_Kod shared memes that echo propaganda spread\ndomestically by Russian state media. @QR_Kod was later removed by Twitter for violating\nits platform manipulation and spam policy. Credit: Screenshots captured by ProPublica\nThe findings indicate that professionalized trolling remains a force in domestic Russian\npropaganda efforts and continues to adapt across platforms, according to Linvill.\n\n“I can’t stress enough the importance of understanding the way that this is a tool for Putin to\ncontrol narratives among his own people, a way for him to lie to his own people and control\nthe conversation,” Linvill said. “To suggest that the West is blanketly winning this information\nwar is true only in some places. Putin doesn’t have to win the information war, he just has to\nhold his ground. And these accounts are helping him do that.”\n\nAfter inquiries from ProPublica, all of the active accounts were removed from TikTok, and\nnearly all were suspended by Twitter. Meta said it removed one Instagram account for\nviolating its spam policy and that the others did not violate its rules. None of the platforms\nattribute the accounts to the IRA. Twitter and TikTok said the accounts engaged in\ncoordinated behavior or other activity that violated platform policies.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the initial eight accounts shared with it violated its policy against\n“harmful misinformation.” TikTok removed an additional 98 accounts it determined were part\nof the same pro-Putin network.\n\n“We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources\nto detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation,” said a statement provided\nby the company. “We also partner with independent fact-checking organizations to support\nour efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.”\n\n\n-----\n\nA Twitter spokesperson called the roughly 60 accounts it removed malicious and said they\nviolated its [platform manipulation and spam policy, but declined to be more specific. They](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation)\nsaid the company had determined that the active accounts shared by ProPublica had\nviolated its policies prior to being asked about them. Twitter decided to leave the set of 37\naccounts online “to make it harder for bad actors to understand our detections,” according to\nthe spokesperson.\n\nThe accounts were removed by Twitter within 48 hours of ProPublica contacting the\ncompany about them. The week before, Twitter removed 27 accounts that the Clemson\nresearchers also identified as likely IRA accounts.\n\n“Our investigation into these accounts remains ongoing, and we will take further action when\nnecessary,” said a statement from a Twitter spokesperson. “As is standard, when we identify\ninformation operation campaigns that we can reliably attribute to state-linked activity, we will\ndisclose this to the public.”\n\nTwitter declined to offer more details on why it left roughly 30 accounts that it identified as\nviolative online to continue spreading propaganda. It also declined to comment on\nconnections between the roughly 60 accounts in this recent network and the hundreds of\naccounts flagged by Linvill and Warren last spring as possible IRA profiles. Linvill said he\nidentified the recent accounts largely based on their commonality with the previous set of\n200.\n\n“I connect these current accounts to the ongoing activity over the course of the past year by\ncarefully tracking accounts’ tactics, techniques and procedures,” he said.\n\nPlatforms may be hesitant to attribute activity to the IRA in part because the agency has\nadapted and made its efforts harder to expose, according to Linvill. But he said social\nplatforms should disclose more information about the networks it removes, even if it can’t say\nwith certainty who is running them.\n\n“In every other area of cybersecurity, dangerous activity from bad actors is disclosed\nroutinely without full confidence in the source of the activity. We name and disclose computer\nviruses or hacker groups, for instance, because that is in the public interest,” he said. “The\nplatforms should do the same. The Russian people should know that some sophisticated and\nwell-organized group is covertly using social media to encourage support for Putin and the\nwar in Ukraine.”\n\nThe Internet Research Agency is a private company owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian\nentrepreneur known as “Putin’s Chef.” Prigozhin is linked to a sprawling empire ranging from\n[catering services to the military mercenary company Wagner Group, which was reportedly](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20211213-eu-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-mercenary-group-wagner-over-human-rights-abuses)\ntasked with assassinating President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The IRA launched in St.\nPetersburg in 2013 by hiring young internet-savvy people to post on blogs, discussion\nforums and social media to promote Putin’s agenda to a domestic audience. After being\n\n\n-----\n\n[exposed for its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA attempted to outsource](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/world/russia-ghana-troll-farms-2020-ward/index.html)\nsome of its English-language operations to Ghana ahead of 2020. Efforts to reach Prigozhin\nwere unsuccessful.\n\nBut it never stopped its core work of influencing Russian-speaking audiences. The IRA is\npart of a sprawling domestic state propaganda operation whose current impact can be seen\nby the number of Russians who refuse to believe that an invasion has happened, while\nasserting that Ukrainians are being held hostage by a Nazi coup.\n\nPrior to the invasion, accounts in the network identified by the Clemson Media Forensics Hub\nand ProPublica celebrated Russian achievements at the Olympics.\n\n“They were deep in the Olympics, tweeting about Russian victories and the Olympics and\nhow the Russians were being robbed by the West and not allowed to compete under their\nown flag,” Linvill said.\n\nAfter the invasion began, they moved to unify people behind Putin’s war.\n\n“It was a slow shift,” he said. “And this is something I’ve seen from the IRA before: When a\nsignificant world event happens, they don’t always know immediately how to respond to it.”\n\nBy late February, the network had found its voice in part by echoing messages from Russian\nofficialdom. The accounts justified the invasion, blamed NATO and the West and seeded\ndoubts about civilian death tolls and Russian military setbacks. When sanctions kicked in\nand Western companies began pulling out of Russia, they said it was good news because\nRussian products are better. (Two Twitter accounts in the network shared the same video of\na man smashing an old iPad with a hammer.)\n\n\n-----\n\nAccounts\n\nin the network responded to sanctions by posting videos disparaging Western products.\nCredit: Screenshot captured by ProPublica\n“These accounts were sophisticated, they knew their audience, and they got engagement far\nsurpassing the number of followers that they had,” Linvill said.\n\nPaul Stronski, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie\nEndowment for Peace, reviewed content shared by more than two dozen of the Twitter\naccounts prior to their suspension. “A lot of this is the type of stuff I would expect from\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian trolls, said Stronski, who reads and speaks Russian.\n\nHe said many of the accounts adopt an approachable and humorous tone to generate\nengagement and appear relatable to younger audiences present on social media.\n\n“They’re very critical of prominent Russians who have criticized this war, questioning their\npatriotism,” Stronski said. “They’re saying in effect that during wartime you shouldn’t be\ncriticizing your own. You should be lining up behind the state.”\n\nWhen President Biden flubbed the pronunciation of “Ukrainians” during his recent State of\nthe Union address, several of the accounts on Twitter, TikTok and Instagram shared the clip\nand mocked him. While that clip spread widely outside of the suspected IRA network as well,\nthe accounts often spread more obscure content in coordination. Multiple Twitter accounts,\nfor example, shared a screenshot of a Russian actor’s tweet that he cared more about being\nable to use Apple Pay than the war in Ukraine. The accounts criticized him, with one warning\nthat “the internet remembers everything.”\n\nRead More\n\n**Native Hawaiians Are Split Over How to Spend $600 Million to Help Those Who Need**\n**Housing**\n\nBefore the account takedowns, the Russian government had begun closing off the country\nfrom global social media and information sources. It restricted access to Twitter and blocked\nFacebook. The Russian legislature passed a law that allows for a 15-year sentence for\npeople who contradict the official government position on the war. As a result, TikTok\nannounced it would pause uploads of new videos in Russia.\n\nSome of the accounts in the network saw the writing on the wall and prepared their audience\nto move to Telegram, a Russian messaging service.\n\n“Friends! With happiness I'd like to tell you that I decided to make the t.me/enot_kremlebot\nchannel, in which you will see analytics to the fullest extent. Twitter could block us any\nminute!” tweeted @Enot_Kremle_Bot on March 5. “I really don’t want to lose my treasured\nand close-to-my-heart audience!
