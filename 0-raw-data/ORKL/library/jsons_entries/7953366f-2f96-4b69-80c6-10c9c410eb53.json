    "plain_text": "# EtterSilent: the underground’s new favorite maldoc builder\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/ettersilent-maldoc-builder-macro-trickbot-qbot](https://intel471.com/blog/ettersilent-maldoc-builder-macro-trickbot-qbot/)**\n\nApr 06, 2021\n\nThe cybercrime underground often mimics behaviors that we see in everyday facets of life.\nIntel 471’s latest discovery is an example of one of these patterns: when a product takes off in\nthe marketplace, users will rush to obtain it and find unique ways to use it in order to fit their\nneeds.\n\nThe latest “product” is a malicious document builder, known in the underground as\n“EtterSilent,” that Intel 471 has seen leveraged by various cybercrime groups. As it has grown\nin popularity, it has constantly been updated in order to avoid detection. Used in conjunction\nwith other forms of malware, it’s a prime example of how ease of use and a concentration of\nskill sets leads to a commoditization of the cybercrime economy.\n\n## How it works\n\nFirst advertised on a well-known Russian cybercrime forum, the seller offered two types of\nweaponized Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) to users: one that exploits a known\n[vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-8570) and another that uses a malicious macro.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2017-8570)\nTo our knowledge, the maldoc with the macro is the more popular choice, possibly due to\nlower pricing and higher compatibility when compared to the exploit.\n\nThe malicious document, when opened, shows a template that poses as DocuSign, the\npopular software that allows individuals and organizations to electronically sign documents.\nThe maldoc then leverages Excel 4.0 macros stored in a hidden sheet, which allow an\nexternally-hosted payload to be downloaded, written to disk and executed using regsvr32 or\nrundll32. From there, attackers can follow up and drop other assorted malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nEtterSilent DocuSign template from December 2020\n\nEtterSilent DocuSign template from March 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n## A cybercrime extravaganza\n\nEttersilent is being used in many malware campaigns, many of which will be familiar to most\ncybersecurity experts.\n\nIt was used in a recent spam campaign to drop an updated version of Trickbot. The maldoc\nwas attached in an email that pretended to be from a well-known multinational appliance\nmanufacturer, claiming to be a payment invoice.\n\nOn March 19, 2021, EtterSilent was used as part of a Bazar loader campaign. The analyzed\nmaldoc did not use a DocuSign template, but the main Excel sheet was named “DocuSign®.”\nThe maldoc downloads the Bazar payload, which in turn connects to another URL that\ndownloads the related Bazar backdoor.\n\n## Everyone needs hosting\n\nThree banking trojans — BokBot, Gozi ISFB and QBot —have also used EtterSilent in\nconjunction with their schemes. However, what makes these campaigns stand out is their\nreliance on bulletproof hosting, which is needed to stand up their schemes. All three\ncampaigns use services run by Yalishanda, one of the world’s most notorious BPH providers.\n\nIntel 471 tracked a particular campaign tied to BokBot that had numerous distribution URLs\nembedded in the EtterSilent maldocs. As of the time this blog was published, all of those\ndomains resolved to one particular IP address. That address is tied to bulletproof\ninfrastructure provided by Yalishanda. The usage of Yalishanda’s BPH service specifically for\nthe delivery URL is reminiscent of years worth of Hancitor campaigns observed by Intel 471.\n\n[We have written extensively how bulletproof hosting works hand-in-glove with cybercrime](https://intel471.com/blog/bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers/)\nfor decades, supplying criminals with the infrastructure they need to carry out their crimes.\n[EtterSilent’s attachment to Yalishanda is another example of that notion.](https://intel471.com/blog/top-bulletproof-hosting-providers-yalishanda-ccweb-brazzzers-2021/)\n\n## A piece in a bigger puzzle\n\nThe widespread use of EtterSilent shows how commoditization is a big part of the cybercrime\neconomy. Different players specialize in their respective area, whether that be robust hosting,\nspam infrastructure, maldoc builders, or malware as a service, and find ways to leverage each\nother’s products in services by working together. A better understanding of not only the\nmalware being used, but how the cybercrime economy works and who the major players are,\nhelps defenders focus on the threats most relevant to our organizations.\n\n## Appendix 1 - Indicators of compromise\n\n**Description** **Value**\n\n\n-----\n\nTrickbot\npayload\n\nTrickbot\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nIcedID\npayload\n\nIcedID\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nQBot\npayload\n\nQbot\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nUrsnif\npayload\n\nUrsnif\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nBazar\npayload\n\nBazar\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nQbot\npayload\n\n\n9118198afca6e2479fdbcca55a08a4408570d2186a7dd8f261f1821178deb595\n\nhttp://costacars[.]es/ico/ortodox.php\n\n50fd4b2e51908a55f2c891fb3ffde2c3661e4324c1887e65fabfb1a93a41efb2\n\n8e51ccc6c8d14f0365d2d597c8aaf6015238839c0dab90e419107782bf460414\n\nhttp://188[.]127.254.114/44270.7082388889.dat\n\n2baf563da8db9e2ed765fa7697025d277d06ee53424f6513671f2f6b7441387b\n\n24753d9f0d691b6d582da3e301b98f75abbdb5382bb871ee00713c5029c56d44\n\n16a0c2f741a14c423b7abe293e26f711fdb984fc52064982d874bf310c520b12\n\nd5b05a81f377c33a2fba292002d0474b68483225aa09c97a00336fc368383d6a\n\n267a54f074b688d591d5cfb7831f1adb443ec1441076775cb158bed0d385f712\n\nb7ce29ffbdf00771b539b28ce01d57cd5805ca3a6ca2eb1b694eed4466912286\n\nhttp://itelsys[.]ma/prod/education.php\n\n5f8e3b19cd4d25ac396cf64f6f448d88e301cf899142bdb03a28cec42eb71389\n\n6a984d3aaffeeec32f3803489c71bfd907e2fb74dbc8eeb931c084f11293e1cc\n\n\n-----\n\nQbot\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nTrickbot\npayload\n\nTrickbot\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\nUrsnif\npayload\n\nUrsnif\ndistribution\nURL\n\nEtterSilent\nmaldoc\n\n\nhttp://pokojewewladyslawowie[.]pl/orlpzhiy/44270.5684626157.dat\n\n3a5d67bdc42b7a9ebd1137e49a34d82c0ee99343ae32f3367137db19131c2cf4\n\naa40f9dd1212993f79cc23111de3a8dd5e529dd1a8ca5dceaa30fba53f6f96b4\n\nhttp://mineiro[.]ch/casrtnoar/count.php\n\n9b1c03b0cca23a94f2d6988c66eb0d246ec2648623765e83dbf20548ac874837\n\n1c65c1a53f1cf5372bb35b5af5130e966b4bb7e7941cc1460f28628249ce5189\n\n2a3316b69ec787ca13a3e35697bcfc4a5e37a9a3080434c56fdf17e0593e0a12\n\n\n-----",
