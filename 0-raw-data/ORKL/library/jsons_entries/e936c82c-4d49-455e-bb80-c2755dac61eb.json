The recent leaks of the group's chat logs have uncovered\nan unprecedented wealth of information and insights into how these veteran cybercriminals\norganize themselves.\n\nCyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) vendors and independent researchers have spent weeks\nporing over the Conti leaked chat logs and have uncovered dozens of very significant\nfindings.\n\nIn this blog, I didn't want to duplicate what is already known (too much). I wanted to share\nsome of the findings that I thought were the most interesting to me. To rapidly get up to\nspeed on the Conti Leaks, I highly recommend other researchers to read the work in the\nfollowing blogs:\n\n\n-----\n\nI will also recommend to read what other researchers have tweeted about what they found in\nthe Conti Leaks:\n\nObservable Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\n[https://twitter.com/TheDFIRReport/status/1498642505646149634](https://twitter.com/TheDFIRReport/status/1498642505646149634)\nCobalt Strike commands from RocketChat logs\n[https://twitter.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/status/1499130574321197058](https://twitter.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/status/1499130574321197058)\nAll CVEs discussed in the Conti chat server\n[https://twitter.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/status/1499570311460753408](https://twitter.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/status/1499570311460753408)\nProof Conti members are active on Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1498761290709409792](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1498761290709409792)\nСonti member interviewed by local police\n[https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1498400616615395328](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1498400616615395328)\nConti members acquire CarbonBlack and Sophos\n[https://twitter.com/albertzsigovits/status/1498237945685422087](https://twitter.com/albertzsigovits/status/1498237945685422087)\nConti's Exploit[.]in account\n[https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz/status/1499108972258906123](https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz/status/1499108972258906123)\n[Conti's Bitcoin wallets https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz/status/1498347648637624326](https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz/status/1498347648637624326)\n\nWith those out of the way, we can get to the meat of this blog. I cannot emphasize enough\nthat these leaks are gargantuan and span years of the group's operations. I seem to find\nsomething new every time I take another look at them but now have enough for a blog of my\nown.\n\n## Reconnaissance\n\nOne major discovery in the Conti leaks is that multiple vendors have covered is the existence\nof an \"OSINT Team\" who gathers details on Conti's targets. This team uses multiple\ntechniques, as well as commercial tools, to find every piece of information about a target that\nwill support the end goal of domain-wide Conti ransomware deployment. This OSINT Team\nalso may engage with the targets (HUMINT), posing as marketing or sales people, gathering\ndetails and information about managers, executives, and how the company operates for\nexploitation later.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 1 - Overview of the Conti OSINT Team_\n\n## Phishing\n\nIt is well-documented that Conti ransomware attacks often begin via a phishing email. The\ngroup has been launching widespread and targeted phishing campaigns for years using a\n[multitude of tactics. The Conti Leaks also shared some insights into how these phishing](https://www.cyjax.com/2021/04/20/wizardspider-using-legitimate-services-as-cloak-of-invisibility/)\ncampaigns are orchestrated.\n\n_Fig. 2 - Example Phishing Email Templates used by Conti_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 3 - Iterable Email Marketing Dashboard shared in Conti Leaks in September 2020_\n\n## Malware\n\nThe Conti Leaks revealed details on how a persistent cybercriminal operation develops its\nmalware campaigns. The image below (see Fig. 4) highlights how the group works to test\nand develop its payloads against common detections systems used by its targets, such as\nESET and Windows Defender.\n\n_Fig. 4 - Conti members testing and making payloads fully undetectable (FUD)_\n\n## Command and Control (C2)\n\n\n-----\n\nLike any malware group, Conti needs server and hosting infrastructure to be able to launch\nits campaigns. This includes payload staging servers, proxy servers, C2 domains, Virtual\nPrivate Servers (VPS), and remote storage for exfiltrated data.\n\n_Fig. 5 - Conti members discussed using ZEHost for hosting_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 6 - Unknown botnet C2 panel shared by a Conti member_\n\n## Tradecraft, Exploits, and 0days\n\nWhat sets Conti apart from the rest of their peers in the cybercrime ecosystem is that\nmembers of this ransomware group are innovators and quick to leverage newly disclosed\ntechniques. The Conti Leaks revealed multiple techniques used by Conti that had not been\npreviously discussed publicly online.\n\n_Fig. 7 - Conti member \"target\" stating intentions in September 2020 to acquire a developer_\n_account in the Microsoft Store to approve their own files_\n\n_Fig. 8 - Conti member \"giovanni\" sharing a manual (aka \"mana\") for the PetitPotam exploit_\n_for Microsoft’s NTLM authentication system in August 2021_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 9 - Conti member \"mango\" sharing the opportunity to buy a 0day privilege escalation_\n_exploit in the Windows WIDFRD.sys driver for \"60k\" in June 2021_\n\n_Fig. 10 - Conti member \"revers\" shares that they read reports on the \"Turla\" group (a_\n_Russian cyber-espionage APT linked to the FSB)_\n\n## A Cybercrime Empire\n\nResearchers have stated that they believe Conti has up to 150+ members worldwide. If we\ndo the math, each member is allegedly getting paid on average $2,000 per month which\nequals around roughly $300,000 per month in Conti \"employee\" salaries and roughly\n$3,600,000 per year. This is a LOT for a cybercrime group. With this amount of purchasingpower, it is only natural Conti leadership began to wonder about acquisitions and starting\n[their own forums, carding shops, and even cryptocurrency platforms.](https://twitter.com/BushidoToken/status/1512401043690336256?s=20&t=W-3i9aeB0IxJZlvWuv5Zpg)\n\n_Fig. 11 - Conti members design what their new cybercrime forum might look like_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 12 - Logo of \"McDuckGroup\" shared to Conti Leaks_\n\nResearchers shared screenshots of all the links pasted into the Conti chats. One stood out to\nme: a logo with \"McDuckGroup\" and Scrooge McDuck. While some researchers I collaborate\nwith theorized this was a ransomware rebrand, I managed to uncover it was the logo for a\ncarding market currently under development. After Googling \"McDuckGroup\", a site called\n\"mcduckgroup[.]shop\" popped up as the first result. This is evidently a carding marketing due\nto the search bars for BIN numbers, Expiry dates, cardholder names, and addresses.\nCurrently no data has been loaded onto the site.\n\n## Ransomware\n\nA number of other ransomware groups are mentioned in the Conti Leaks. Trellix researchers\nhighlighted how representatives of NetWalker, MAZE, and LockBit all have a presence in the\nConti chat server. Ryuk, Diavol, REvil, AvosLocker, BlackMatter, and Crylock ransomware\nfamilies are all also mentioned in the Conti Leaks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 13 - \"bomba777\" and \"gagarin66\" (a MAZE affiliate) discuss REvil depositing 900k in_\n_Bitcoin to XSS[.]is_\n\n_Fig. 14 - \"rags\" discusses REvil arrests in January 2022 by Russian FSB, blaming them for_\n_the alleged crackdown on cryptocurrency in Russia_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 15 - \"CRYPTOHAZARD\" leak site linked to MAZE ransomware (newsmaze[.]top)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 16 - mango and stern shared adverts for AvosLocker and BlackMatter_\n\n_Fig. 17 - Logos and designs for CryLock ransomware shared to Conti server_\n\n_Fig. 18 - Conti V3 Locker source code disclosed publicly by @contileaks Twitter account_\n\nSamples of Conti v3\n\nlocker.exe\ne1b147aa2efa6849743f570a3aca8390faf4b90aed490a5682816dd9ef10e473\nlocker_x86.dll\nfb737da1b74e8c84e6d8bd7f2d879603c27790e290c04a21e00fbde5ed86eee3\n\n\n-----\n\ncryptor.exe\n5f3ae6e0d2e118ed31e7c38b652f4e59f5d5745398596c8b31248eda059778af\n\n## Closing Comments\n\nThe Conti Leaks have provided cybercrime researchers an unparalleled look into how\nRussian-speaking organized hacking groups operate. The leaks also supplement the Conti\n[Playbook that was leaked by a disgruntled member in August 2021. As a community of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/Conti-leak-translation.html)\ncybersecurity researchers, we now know more about the Conti ransomware group than any\nother threat group in history.\n\nFor the Conti group itself, however, it appears to be business as usual (BAU). Less than one\nweek after the Conti chats were leaked, new victims were uploaded to the ContiNews\ndarknet site.\n\n_Fig. 19 - New victims added to ContiNews shortly after the Conti Leaks_\n\n[BleepingComputer also reported on hacktivist groups, such as Network Battalion 65 (aka](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\nNB65), are leveraging a modified version of the leaked Conti v3 source code already. The\ngroup has targeted organizations in Russia for retribution over the invasion in Ukraine.\n[(Sample available here)](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/7f6dbd9fa0cb7ba2487464c824b6d7e16ace9d4cd15e4452df4c9a9fd6bd1907/#intel)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 20 - NB65 modified version of Conti v3 ransomware_\n\nConti has seemingly recovered from the leaks and might be at the 'too big to fail' stage of\noperations. The Russian state is clearly fully aware of Conti's operations and allows them to\noperate with impunity. Researchers at Trellix highlighted the group's connections to the\nRussian state and how the intelligence services also benefit from Conti's coveted network\naccess to high-profile organizations around the world.\n\nLastly, I hope you enjoyed the blog. There are still likely some secrets yet to be revealed in\nthe Conti Leaks. I appreciate the help and resources shared by researchers online.
