Paying a**\n**ransom also does not result in Karakurt deleting data.**\n\n### Summary\n\nTetra Defense, an Arctic Wolf® company, partnered with Chainalysis to analyze the link\nbetween the Karakurt cyber extortion group to both Conti and Diavol ransomware through\nTetra’s digital forensics and Chainalysis’ blockchain analytics. As recent leaks have revealed,\nConti and Trickbot are complicated operations with sophisticated structures. But, our findings\nindicate that web is even wider than originally thought, to include additional exfiltration-only\noperations. The web is stickier too as we have confirmed on numerous occasions that the\nKarakurt group does not delete victim data and maintains a copy even after an extortion\npayment.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Background\n\nIn 2021 Tetra Defense was approached by a client who claimed to have been hit with\nransomware re-extortion. They were previously a victim of Conti ransomware and had paid\nthe demand only to later discover another extortion attempt from an unknown group. Except,\nin the second attempt, no encryption occurred. After successfully recovering from the first\nintrusion, this client logged in to their systems to find yet another ransom note stating\nsensitive data had been stolen and exacting an additional ransom.\n\nThe timing was interesting. As Tetra Defense took the case and started examining the\nclient’s systems, it was clear that the second extortionist had utilized the exact same\nbackdoor left by the Conti group to access the victim’s network. This was a Cobalt Strike\nback door indicating that the second intruder would have needed access to the Conti Cobalt\nStrike server in order to use the persistence mechanism. Such access could only be\nobtained through some sort of purchase, relationship, or surreptitiously gaining access to\nConti group infrastructure.\n\nThis all occurred during a turbulent period in which Conti was struggling with disgruntled\naffiliates angry over low pay and leaking sensitive information such as Conti’s playbooks and\ntraining materials. Tetra noted the possibility that this second actor could have been a Conti\noperative or affiliate, particularly given their access to the backdoor. Perhaps it was a\ndisgruntled employee trying to “cut out the middleman” and walk away with more profit by\nquietly returning to steal data. Or, alternatively, perhaps this was the trial run of a strategic\ndiversification authorized by the main group.\n\nThus began a more regular emergent pattern of data theft extortions. Just a few days later\nTetra Defense encountered the first victim of what was called “Karakurt” employing similar\ntradecraft to what was observed in the previous re-extortion attempt just days before. Again,\nthe victim reported no encryption, only a ransom note indicating that large amounts of\nsensitive data had been stolen. This was not unheard of. Other groups such as Marketo\nbegan using the tactic earlier and a few others such as Bl@ckt0r and Bonaci Group were\nlargely contemporaneous. But Karakurt seemed to outlive each of its competitors in this\nnascent exfiltration-only space as Tetra Defense responded to numerous incidents over the\nnext few months. Our analysis might shed light on Karakurt’s relative longevity.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Karakurt's logo_\n\n## Who is Karakurt?\n\nKarakurt is branded after the common name of a venomous widow spider, an image the\ngroup does not hesitate to allegorize in describing who they are. As evinced by the excerpt\ntaken from the group’s dark web leak site, a data theft extortion is compared to a toxic bite.\nThe antidote? Cooperation, of course.\n\n_Screenshot from Karakurt dark web leak site._\n\nAs opposed to typical ransomware in which the adversary will deny a victim access to data\nthrough encryption, Karakurt is a cybercrime group which infiltrates networks and engages in\nextortion by stealing and threatening to release data without any attempt to encrypt. Since its\nfirst observed attacks in August 2021, Karakurt has victimized organizations across a\nnumber of industries and in at least eight countries.[1]\n\n\n-----\n\nTypically, Karakurt threatens to release victims’ data on a branded dark web site, noted for its\nbizarre aesthetic. Until recently, Karakurt posted lists of victim names who chose not to\naccede to the group’s demands but is now beginning to make good on threats to release\nstolen data.\n\n### Karakurt Dark Web Home Page\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conti Hypothesis\n\nIn responding to well over a dozen Karakurt incidents to date, Tetra Defense has built a\ndataset of intrusions, leading to additional insight. The most ubiquitous point of initial\nintrusion for Karakurt attacks are Fortinet SSL VPNs as was also the point of compromise for\nthe earlier seemingly Conti-related re-extortion.\n\nWhile Karakurt attacks can vary with respect to tools, some notable overlaps began to\nemerge between some Karakurt intrusions and the earlier suspected Conti-related reextortion, including the use of the same tools for exfiltration, a unique adversary choice to\ncreate and leave behind a file listing of exfiltrated data named “file-tree.txt” in the victim’s\nenvironment, as well as the repeated use of the same attacker hostname when remotely\naccessing victims’ networks (see table below).\n\nAny single data point is far from a smoking gun but taken together as a series of choices\nmade by an attacker to accomplish the unique goal of data theft extortion, there is evidence\nto make an inference-based assertion that these intrusions could be linked. If the mystery re\n\n-----\n\nextortion gang were indeed connected to Conti and likewise related to Karakurt then by\ntransitive inference this might indicate a connection between Conti and Karakurt.\n\nIn addition, Tetra was engaged by another client victimized by a Karakurt attack, only upon\nperforming forensics analysis did we learn that they had been the prior victim of Ryuk\nransomware in the past. This was the second indication of a potential Conti link, as Ryuk and\nConti are both deployed by the Trickbot Group and exhibit significant technical as well as\nfinancial overlap.[2] Armed with a hypothesis that something more systemic was occurring,\nTetra Defense collaborated with our intel partners at Chainalysis.\n\n**Conti-Related Re-Extortion** **Karakurt**\n\n\n**Root Point of**\n**Compromise**\n\n\nFortinet SSL VPN Fortinet SSL VPN\n\n\n**Exfiltration Tool** WinSCP WinSCP\n\n\n**File Listing** “file-tree.txt” left on victim\nsystem\n\n\n“file-tree.txt” left on victim\nsystem\n\n\n**Attacker Hostname** Identical Identical\n\n**Actions on Objective** Data Exfiltration Data Exfiltration\n\n_Comparison of earlier non-attributed re-extortion and a cluster of Karakurt intrusions_\n\n### Conti and Karakurt’s Financial Connections\n\nIn partnership with Chainalysis and its world-class blockchain analysis team, we can analyze\ncryptocurrency transactions carried out by Conti and Karakurt to reveal financial connections\nbetween the two. Blockchain analysis provided some of the earliest indication of Karakurt’s\nties to Conti ransomware, as the relevant transactions pre-date the discovery of the\nsimilarities in Karakurt and Conti’s software and attack strategy.\n\nChainalysis has identified dozens of cryptocurrency addresses belonging to Karakurt,\nscattered across multiple wallets. Victim payments to those addresses range from $45,000 to\n$1 million worth of cryptocurrency. Right off the bat, we can see examples of Karakurt wallets\nsending substantial sums of cryptocurrency to Conti wallets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, in the Chainalysis Reactor screenshot above, we see a Karakurt extortion\nwallet moving 11.36 Bitcoin — worth approximately $472,000 at the time of transfer — to a\nConti wallet. But the connections run even deeper. Chainalysis has also found that several\nKarakurt victim payment addresses are hosted by wallets that also house Conti victim\npayment addresses.\n\nShared wallet hosting leaves virtually no doubt that Conti and Karakurt are deployed by the\nsame individual or group.\n\n**How Diavol Fits**\n\nTetra has discovered some oversights by Karakurt operatives which reveal a connection to\nDiavol ransomware, another group which emerged around the same time (July 2021) and\nhas been associated with Trickbot.[3] Tetra responders observed adversary actions across\nmultiple cases which proved shared use of tools and infrastructure, though, like Conti, Diavol\nemploys encryption whereas Karakurt does not.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiavol, Conti, and Ryuk had been reported using the same malware loader[4] and the Conti\nJabber chat leaks in Feb – March 2022 further revealed the nature of the connection with\nDiavol.[5] In the chats, Stern (the Trickbot Group administrator and Conti manager) wrote to\nMango (the people manager) in early July 2021 to inform that Baget, another operative, had\ncompleted the Diavol locker and that it had come back clean on antivirus detection tests.\nBoth Karakurt and Diavol sprang from within the heart of Conti and Tetra Defense was able\nto confirm that Karakurt and Diavol operators were sharing attacker infrastructure during the\nsame period of time.\n\nOnce again though, blockchain analysis confirms Diavol’s connection to Karakurt and Conti.\nSimilar to Karakurt, the Reactor graph below shows a Diavol extortion address hosted by a\nwallet containing addresses used in Conti ransomware attacks.\n\nAgain, this common address ownership confirms with near total certainty that Diavol is\ndeployed by the same actors behind Conti and Karakurt.\n\n**Karakurt may be Conti’s diversification strategy, but not a wise one**\n\nWe have been able to demonstrate relatively high-confidence connections between Conti,\nKarakurt, and Diavol. However Karakurt is being run, it no doubt gains some advantage with\naccess to Conti resources such as access to victims or the tools and infrastructure used by\nthe rest of the group. Knowing who you are dealing with in the fight against ransomware is a\n\n\n-----\n\nrare opportunity, which helps defenders know how to respond. Through collaborative efforts\nin Tetra’s forensic investigations with Chainalysis’ blockchain analytics and IR partners, there\nis a strong case to be made that Karakurt and Diavol are part of the evolving Conti web.\n\nWhy might Conti deploy a quasi-ransomware strain like Karakurt? The Conti Leaks may hold\nthe answer. Chats between Trickbot Group managers show that they’ve thought long and\nhard about how to diversify their business model, with some proposing ideas like selling\nexfiltrated data or access to victims. Operating multiple ransomware strains could also be a\nway to enhance resiliency and enable business continuity amid any possible government\nactions. Amid unprecedented Law Enforcement action on ransomware in 2021 when\nKarakurt emerged, Conti managers may have perceived that launching a strain that does not\nencrypt can bypass scrutiny incurred by “ransomware” while still achieving financial\nobjectives.\n\nWhether Karakurt is an elaborate side hustle by Conti and Diavol operatives or whether this\nis an enterprise sanctioned by the overall organization remains to be seen. What we can say\nis this connection perhaps explains why Karakurt is surviving and thriving despite some of its\nexfiltration-only competitors dying out.\n\nBut in the long run, the strategy may backfire, as these discoveries discredit Conti\nransomware’s standard pledge to victims that paying the demanded ransom will keep them\nsafe from future attacks and result in the criminal enterprise keeping its word. We have been\nable to confirm on numerous occasions that the Karakurt group does not delete victim data\nafter payment and maintains a copy. However, the motivation behind this is unclear. While\nwe have not as yet observed re-extortion after a Karakurt payment, the victim’s deal is only\npartially honored. In addition, there is plausible evidence to assert that Conti has used\nKarakurt against former victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image Credit: Team Cymru[6]_\n\nCheck out the highlighted portion of the Conti ransom note above. Ransomware attacks are\npremised on the victim’s trust that their payment will end the attack and return to them control\nof their data. If victims and their incident response firms know Conti may have re-extorted\nprior victims using Karakurt and that data won’t actually be deleted, there’s much less\nincentive to pay.
