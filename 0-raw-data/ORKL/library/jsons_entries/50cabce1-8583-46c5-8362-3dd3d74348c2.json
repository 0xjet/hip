The group rented Internet\nProtocol (IP) addresses, servers, and domains to cybercriminal clients, who used this\ntechnical infrastructure to disseminate malware used to gain access to victims’ computers,\nform botnets, and steal banking credentials for use in frauds. Malware hosted by the\norganization included Zeus, SpyEye, Citadel, and the Blackhole Exploit Kit, which rampantly\nattacked U.S. companies and financial institutions between 2009 and 2015 and caused or\nattempted to cause millions of dollars in losses to U.S. victims. A key service provided by the\ndefendants was helping their clients to evade detection by law enforcement and continue\ntheir crimes uninterrupted; the defendants did so by monitoring sites used to blocklist\ntechnical infrastructure used for crime, moving “flagged” content to new infrastructure, and\nregistering all such infrastructure under false or stolen identities.\n\n\n-----\n\nEvery day, transnational organized cybercriminals deploy malware that ravages our\neconomy and victimizes our citizens and businesses,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General\nNicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The criminal\norganizations that purposefully aid these actors — the so-called bulletproof hosters, money\nlaunderers, purveyors of stolen identity information, and the like — are no less responsible\nfor the harms these malware campaigns cause, and we are committed to holding them\naccountable. Prosecutions like this one increase the costs and risks to cybercriminals and\nensure that they cannot evade responsibility for the enormous injuries they cause to victims.”\n\n“Fraud over the internet has had a major economic impact on our community, and all over\nour nation and the world,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Saima S. Mohsin of the Eastern\nDistrict of Michigan. “An essential part of reducing the fraud involves vigorously investigating\nand prosecuting individuals such as these ‘bulletproof hosters’ who enable the fraudsters in\nvictimizing people over the internet.”\n\n“Over the course of many years, the defendants facilitated the transnational criminal activity\nof a vast network of cybercriminals throughout the world by providing them a safe-haven to\nanonymize their criminal activity,” said Special Agent in Charge Timothy Waters of the FBI’s\nDetroit Field Office. “This resulted in millions of dollars of losses to U.S. victims. Today’s\nguilty plea sends a message to cybercriminals across the globe that they are not beyond the\nreach of the FBI and its international partners, and that anyone who facilitates or profits from\ncriminal cyber activity will be brought to justice.”\n\nAccording to court filings and statements made in connection with their guilty pleas,\nGrichishkin and Skvortsov were founding members of the organization and its proprietors.\nSkvortsov was responsible for marketing the organization’s criminal business and served as\na point of contact for important and/or disgruntled clients, and Grichishkin was the\norganization’s day-to-day leader and oversaw its personnel. Skorodumov was one of the\norganization’s lead systems administrators, and at some points, its only systems\nadministrator. In this role, he configured and managed the clients’ domains and IP\naddresses, provided technical assistance to help clients optimize their malware and botnets,\nand monitored and responded to abuse notices. Stassi undertook various administrative\ntasks for the organization, including conducting and tracking online marketing to the\norganization’s criminal clientele and using stolen and/or false personal information to register\nwebhosting and financial accounts used by the organization.\n\nStassi, Skorodumov, and Grichishkin pleaded guilty in February and March 2021 to one\ncount of RICO conspiracy. Skvortsov pleaded guilty today to the same charge. All four guilty\npleas took place before Chief U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood in the Eastern District of\nMichigan. Sentencing of Stassi, Skorodumov, Grichishkin, and Skvortsov has been set for\nJune 3, June 29, July 8, and Sept. 16, respectively. Each defendant faces a maximum\npenalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine each sentence after\nconsidering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI investigated the case with critical assistance from law enforcement partners in\nGermany, Estonia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nSenior Counsel Louisa K. Marion of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual\nProperty Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick E. Corbett of the Eastern District of\nMichigan prosecuted the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs\nprovided substantial assistance.\n\n\n-----",
