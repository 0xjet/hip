Our experts\n[presented their research at the Security Analyst Summit 2018, and here we will try to explain](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/the-sas-2018/)\nthat complex work in a short post.\n\n## Jackpotting ATMs and beyond\n\nWhile researching malware for ATM jackpotting used by a Brazilian group called Prilex, our\nresearchers stumbled upon a modified version of this malware with some additional features\nthat was used to infect point-of-service (POS) terminals and collect card data.\n\nThis malware was capable of modifying POS software to allow a third party to capture the\ndata transmitted by a POS to a bank. That’s how the crooks obtained the card data.\nBasically, when you pay at a local shop whose POS terminal is infected, your card data is\ntransferred right away to the criminals.\n\nHowever, having the card data is just half the battle; to steal money, they also needed to be\nable to clone cards, a process made more complicated by the chips and their multiple\n[authentications.](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/authentication/?utm_source=kdaily&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\n\nThe Prilex group developed a whole infrastructure that lets its “customers” create cloned\ncards — which in theory shouldn’t be possible.\n\n[To learn why it’s possible, you might first want to take a quick look at how EMV cards work.](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~erikpoll/papers/EMVtechreport.pdf)\nAs for the cloning, we’ll try to keep it as simple as possible.\n\n## How the chip-and-PIN standard works\n\nThe chip on the card is not just flash memory, but a tiny computer capable of running\napplications. When the chip is introduced into a POS terminal, a sequence of steps begins.\n\nThe first step is called initialization: The terminal receives basic information such as\ncardholder name, card expiration date, and the list of applications the card is capable of\nrunning.\n\nSecond is an optional step called data authentication. Here, the terminal checks if the card is\nauthentic, a process that involves validating the card using cryptographic algorithms. It’s\nmore complicated than needs to be discussed here.\n\nThird is another optional step called cardholder verification; the cardholder must provide\neither the PIN code or a signature (depending on how the card was programmed). This step\nis used to ensure that the person trying to pay with a card is actually the same person the\ncard was issued for.\n\nFourth, the transaction happens. Note that only steps 1 and 4 are mandatory. In other words,\nauthentication and verification can be skipped — that’s where the Brazilians come in\n\n\n-----\n\n## Carding unlimited\n\nSo, we have a card that is capable of running applications, and during its first handshake, the\nPOS asks the card for information about the apps available to it. The number and complexity\nof steps needed for the transaction depend on the available applications.\n\nThe card-cloners created a Java application for cards to run. The application has two\ncapabilities: First, it tells the POS terminal there is no need to perform data authentication.\nThat means no cryptographic operations, sparing them the near-impossible task of obtaining\nthe card’s private cryptographic keys.\n\nBut that still leaves PIN authentication. However, there’s an option in the EMV standard to\nchoose as the entity checking if the PIN is correct…your card. Or, more precisely, an app\nrunning on your card.\n\nYou read that right: The cybercriminals’ app can say a PIN is valid, no matter what PIN was\nentered. That means that the crook wielding the card can simply enter four random digits —\nand they’ll always be accepted.\n\n## Card fraud as a service\n\nThe infrastructure Prilex created includes the Java applet described above, a client\napplication called “Daphne” for writing the information on smart cards (smart card\nreader/writer devices and blank smart cards are inexpensive and completely legal to buy.)\nThe same app is used for checking the amount of money that can be withdrawn from the\ncard.\n\nThe infrastructure also includes the database with card numbers and other data. Whether the\ncard is debit or credit doesn’t matter; “Daphne” can create clones of both. The crooks sell it\nall as a package, mostly to other criminals in Brazil, who then create and use the cloned\ncards.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAccording to [Aite’s 2016 Global Consumer Card Fraud report, it is safe to assume that all](https://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/trends/2016-global-consumer-card-fraud-where-card-fraud-is-coming-from.pdf)\nusers have been compromised. Whether you use a card with a magnetic stripe or a more\nsecure chip-and-PIN card doesn’t matter — if you have a card, its information has probably\nbeen stolen.\n\nNow that criminals have developed a method to actually clone the cards, that starts to look\nlike a very serious financial threat. If you want to avoid losing significant amounts of money\nthrough card fraud, we recommend you do the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nKeep an eye on your card s transaction history, using either mobile push or SMS\nnotifications. If you notice suspicious spending, call your bank ASAP and block the card\nright away.\nUse AndroidPay or ApplePay if possible; these methods don’t disclose your card data\nto the POS. That’s why they can be considered more secure than inserting your card\ninto a POS.\nUse a separate card for Internet payments, because this card is even more likely to be\ncompromised than those you use only in brick-and-mortar stores. Don’t keep large\nsums of money on that card.\n\n[bank cards](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/bank-cards/)\n[banking](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/banking/)\n[credit cards](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/credit-cards/)\n[fraud](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/fraud/)\n[malware](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/malware-2/)\n[Prilex](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/prilex/)\n[SAS](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/sas/)\n[SAS 2018](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/sas-2018/)\n[Security Analyst Summit](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/security-analyst-summit/)\n\nShare article\n\nRelated\n\n\n-----",
