This is the first time that we have observed Negasteal with\na ransomware payload.\n\n[Only a few months ago, Deep Instinct published the first reported case of a Negasteal variant](https://www.deepinstinct.com/2020/10/29/the-hasty-agent-agent-tesla-attack-uses-hastebin/)\nthat used hastebin[.]com, a paste site for online content. Negasteal is a spyware trojan that\nwas [discovered in 2014. It offers its services in the form of paid subscriptions in cybercriminal](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/who-is-agent-tesla/)\nunderground forums, with its developers constantly making changes to improve its evasion\ntactics and remain relevant in their market.\n\n[The Crysis ransomware, meanwhile, is behind several high-profile attacks, with variants that](https://www.zdnet.com/article/texas-hospital-becomes-victim-of-ransomware-patient-data-potentially-leaked/)\n[continuously demonstrate different techniques. Similar to Negasteal, Dharma works on a](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/e/dharma-ransomware-uses-av-tool-to-distract-from-malicious-activities.html)\n[ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model that makes it accessible for other cybercriminals to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-as-a-service-ransomware-operators-find-ways-to-bring-in-business)\npay for.\n\n## Behavior\n\nThis is the first time that we have observed these two malware services being used together.\nAccording to the sample that we encountered, the variant arrives through a phishing email,\nas seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. An image of the phishing email that was used\n\nAs part of its evasion tactics, it tries to exclude itself from debugging by Windows Defender,\nwhich it can also try to disable as a possible alternative evasion method. These tactics are\nshown in Figures 2 and 3.\n\nFigure 2. The malware excludes itself from being debugged.\n\nFigure 3. The malware disables Windows Defender.\n\nFor persistence, it adds itself to the startup folder and CurrentVersion\\Run. Eventually, the\nloader will connect to “hastebin[.]com” and decode the binary (Crysis) from the commandand-control (C&C) server, thereby allowing fileless delivery of the ransomware.\n\nFigure 4. A snippet of the malware adding itself to the startup folder\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. The malware connects to hastebin[.]com\n\nFigure 6. The Crysis ransomware payload\n\n## Security Recommendations\n\nThis campaign shows the potential of Negasteal to deliver other malware filelessly through\nits hastebin C&C server. The combination of these two active malware services\ndemonstrates how cybercriminals can cobble together accessible malware in hopes of a\nsuccessful campaign. Fileless delivery also adds a further challenge in removing this threat,\nas it leaves no trace after execution.\n\nFor organizations, following security best practices will help minimize the success of similar\ncampaigns. As with this campaign, stopping threats from their initial entry can prevent larger\nproblems caused by their payloads. In this case, the campaign has a ransomware payload\nthat can encrypt important files and freeze operations.\n\nHere are some general security practices to implement:\n\n[Secure email gateways. Secured email gateways thwart threats that are delivered via](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\nspam and phishing. They also help users to avoid opening suspicious emails and\nattachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Regularly back up files. This also serves as a good precaution against ransomware](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/best-practices-backing-up-data)\nattacks.\n[Keep systems and applications updated. Use virtual patching for legacy or unpatchable](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/virtual-patching-patch-those-vulnerabilities-before-they-can-be-exploited)\nsystems and software.\n[Enforce the principle of least privilege. Implement network segmentation and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cyber-attacks/protecting-data-through-network-segmentation/) data\ncategorization to minimize further exposure of mission-critical data.\nImplement defense in-depth.
