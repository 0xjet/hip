    "plain_text": "# Operation PZCHAO\n\n## Inside a highly specialized espionage infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n### Foreword\nMore than 30 years after the end of the Cold War, digital infrastructures worldwide have become strategic national fronts with the same\nimportance as the geographical frontiers of air, land, sea and space.\n\nAt the same time, cyber-attacks are growing in complexity as threat actors divide payloads in multiple modules with highly specialized\nuses to achieve a target’s compromise. The past few years have seen high-profi le cyber-attacks shift to damaging the targets’ digital\ninfrastructures to stealing highly sensitive data, silently monitoring the victim and constantly laying the ground for a new wave of attacks.\n\nThis is also the case of a custom-built piece of malware that we have been monitoring for several months as it wrought havoc in Asia. Our\nthreat intelligence systems picked up the fi rst indicators of compromise in July last year, and we have kept an eye on the threat ever since.\n\nAn interesting feature of this threat, which drew our team to the challenge of analyzing it, is that it features a network of malicious\nsubdomains, each one used for a specifi c task (download, upload, RAT related actions, malware DLL delivery). The payloads are diversifi ed\nand include capabilities to download and execute additional binary fi les, collect private information and remotely execute commands on\nthe system.\n\nIn the analysis process, we managed to retrieve the malware payloads hosted on one of the command and control servers along with\nsome statistics, such as the total number of downloads and logs containing the targeted victims. Among the most-downloaded malicious\nfi les, we found variants of Gh0st RAT used in Iron Tiger APT operation. Interestingly enough, these new samples now connect to the new\nattack infrastructure.\n\nThis whitepaper takes an in-depth look at the the attack chain, the infrastructure used by the threat actors, the malware subdomains they\ncontrol and the payloads delivered on the targeted systems, as well as other telltale signs about a possible return of the Iron Tiger APT.\n\n### 1. Victimology\nSince its debut, this malware has been targeting important institutions, mainly in Asia and the USA, the victims being part of Government\nsector, Technology, Education and Telecommunications. This map offers a simplifi ed view of the location and nature of the targets.\n\n\nTechnology\nGovernment\nEducation\nTelecommunications\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n### 2. The attack chain\n\nThe initial point of compromise seems to be highly targeted spam messages with a malicious VBS fi le attached. The VBS script acts as a\ndownloader for further malicious payloads from a distribution server, as shown in the diagram below.\n\nThe distribution server has been resolved to an IP address located in South Korea as of July 17 2017, when we fi rst isolated the initial\npayload. The IP address “125.7.152.55” hosts the “down.pzchao.com”. As shown in the diagram below, new components are downloaded\nand executed on the compromised hosts in every stage of attack.\n\n**2.1. Overview of the malware delivery infrastructure**\n\nThe threat actors behind the attack have control over fi ve subdomains of the “pzchao.com” domain. Suggestively named, these domains\nserve specifi c functionalities, such as upload, download and RAT related communication.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n**2.2. The fi rst stage payload – “UP”**\n\nOne sample we dug from the malware zoo has also been spotted in various regions in Asia. It consists of a self-extracting 7zip archive\n(SFX) which, when extracted, writes two batch scripts (up.bat, new.bat) to disk and one legitimate application called curl.exe.\n\nThis payload is particular to Asia, as the messages that the SFX Install Script displays as part of the setup on the compromised system are\nwritten in Chinese. The malicious batch scripts, along with the downloader tool, are dropped in the %systemroot%\\\\temp folder. The fi rst\nbat script to run is “up.bat” and is set in the “RunProgram” variable.\n\n**2.2.1.** **A closer look at up.bat**\n\nThe install script in the self-extracting archive executes the fi rst batch script dropped on the system. This script called “up.bat” sits in the\ntemporary folder and serves four main purposes:\n\n        - It renames the second batch script from tnew.bat to win32shell.bat;\n\n        - Assigns system fi le attributes to it;\n\n        - Modifi es its Access Control List (ACL) to be easily controlled;\n\n        - Kills all scheduled tasks that might interfere with the sample. Some of these tasks include legitimate Adobe services\nas well as legit security solutions like 360.;\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\nThe new win32shell.bat script is subsequently scheduled to run as a task under the “Adobe Flash Updates” name every other day at 3 AM\nwith the “down” parameter. The task name disguise helps keep a low profi le and evade scrutiny in case of an investigation:\n\n_schtasks /create /tn “Adobe Flash Updaters” /tr “%systemroot%\\temp\\win32shell.bat down” /sc daily /mo 2 /st 03:00:00 /ru “”_\n\n**2.2.2.** **new.bat**\n\nThe “new” batch script is used by the network’s operators as a downloader for additional companion tools, as well as to upload system\ninformation (and other confi dential data) to a command and control server. The BAT fi le is saved in the %TEMP% folder as “win32shell.bat”.\n\n**2.2.3.** **The upload server component – “up.pzchao”**\n\nDuring its execution, win32shell.bat contacts the command and control server at up.pzchao.com:864/install.asp? to send a fi ngerprint of\nthe system. The information is passed along in a POST request made by another batch script fi le that is decrypted and dropped by win32.\nshell.bat. This dropped batch script is called “360.bat” (most likely because of its resemblance to a highly popular security suite in China)\nand sends information such as username, domain, MAC address, OS version and the RDP port 3389 status via a POST request to the /\ninstall.asp script. The request is sent via the legitimate application curl.exe that gets extracted from the initial 7zip archive.\n\nOnce the script fi nishes profi ling the infected device, it starts uploading confi dential information, such as passwords. Password achievement\nis done via a Mimikatz implementation downloaded along with the rest of the fi les. This POST request containing the password is sent to\nanother server-side script, called /upload864. This information is scheduled for collection and exfi ltration every week at 3 AM.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n**2.3. The Download Server – “down.pzchao”**\n\nWin32shell.bat contacts the download server at “down.pzchao.com” to request the four additional second-stage payloads that are\ndiscussed in detail below.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper2.3.1. Second stage payloads\n\n**The Bitcoin Miner**\n\nThe fi rst payload deployed to the infected system is a self-extracting 7zip archive that drops a set of miner application tools for Bitcoin\n\nmining. The original installation batch script ensures that the miner application works well so that it will kill all scheduled tasks (other\nbitcoin mining applications) which may interfere with the running tool. Subsequently, it identifi es the operating system used and sets the\ncorresponding Bitcoin miner application into the %TEMP% system folder.\n\nThe script proceeds to create a service called named wmiapsrv.exe that runs a BitcoinMinerPooling Application. The wmiapsrv32/64.exe\nis a fake application set as a service, which runs java. exe (the actual Bitcoin miner). The Bitcoin miner application (both 32-bit and 64-bit)\nis renamed as java.exe and used for bitcoin mining every three weeks at 3 AM.\n\n**The Password Stealer**\n\nTo harvest passwords from the target system, the malware deploys two versions of the Mimikatz password-scraping utility for both\noperating system architectures (x86, x64). Mimikatz comes in a self-extracted 7zip archive also and, once extracted, it drops four distinct\nfi les, called mimikatz.exe, mimilib.dll, mimidrv.sys, and pass.bat.\n\nThe batch script executes the Mimikatz binary. Once dumped, the confi dential information gets uploaded to the command and control\nserver at a later time.\n\n**The Remote Access Trojan component (Gh0st RAT)**\n\nThe last payload downloaded is a slightly modifi ed Gh0st RAT sample designed to act as a backdoor implant. Its behavior is very similar\nto the versions detected in attacks associated with the Iron Tiger APT group. This executable represents the “dropper” - a Windows\napplication that contains all the code required to prepare a compromised host for installation of the Gh0st RAT server service. The binary\nthat is decrypted and dropped on the system is the same as the one that communicates with the attacker’s endpoint (also known as the\nRAT client or the C2 controller) on startup and awaits further instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\nOnce this service is installed on the targeted host, the system is completely compromised, as it has a vast array of espionage capabilities\n(including Remote Terminal) that can be used to move laterally across the network. A list of main capabilities, along with a short description,\nare shown below in Table 1.\n\n**Process Explorer** Listing of all active processes and opened windows\n\n**Keystroke Logger** Real-time and offline remote keystroke logging\n\n**Web Cam Eavesdropping** Live video feed of remote web camera, if available\n\n**Voice Monitoring** Remote listening using microphone if available\n\n**Session Management** Remote shutdown and reboot of host\n\n**Remote File Downloads** Ability to download binaries from the Internet to remote host\n\n**Remote Terminal** Fully functional remote shell\n\n**File Manager** Complete fi le explorer capabilities for local and remote hosts\n\nThe Gh0st architecture takes advantage of the ability to create custom Windows resources in a Windows binary. This mechanism is used\nquite often by malware authors, as it is extremely convenient for attackers to create custom binaries for different targets.\n\nBefore installation of the main communication component, the dropper takes several actions on the infected system: it will fi rst call the\nGetInputState() function that verifi es if there are mouse or keyboard messages in the calling thread’s queue being followed by calls to\nPostThreadMessage() and GetMessage(). However, none of the return values of these called functions are processed, which is highly\nspecifi c to many of the versions of Gh0st RAT we have seen in the past.\n\nThe malware then searches inside its own binary for a string delimiter SSSSSSS, returning a string pointer to the beginning of the encrypted\nconfi guration string. The delimiter points to the beginning of the C2 hostname:port pairs. The application searches again for another string\ndelimiter AAAAAAA. This time the marker string points to the beginning of the encrypted server service name. If the confi guration strings\nare not found, the application exits. The encrypted confi gurations previously located will be decrypted using AES.\n\nIt will then ensure that only one instance of the program runs at a given moment by checking for the presence of a particular mutex on the\nsystem. Subsequently, the payload enables its automatic execution upon every system startup by adding the path of the executable in the\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” registry key.\n\nIt also registers itself as a system service by adding the following registry keys:\n\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Wsfbpy sahblabg”\n\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Maobeu xqiyes”\n\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\Wsfbpy sahblabg\n\nReleiceName = „Oracle.exe””\n\n|Process Explorer|Listing of all active processes and opened windows|\n|---|---|\n|Keystroke Logger|Real-time and offline remote keystroke logging|\n|Web Cam Eavesdropping|Live video feed of remote web camera, if available|\n|Voice Monitoring|Remote listening using microphone if available|\n|Session Management|Remote shutdown and reboot of host|\n|Remote File Downloads|Ability to download binaries from the Internet to remote host|\n|Remote Terminal|Fully functional remote shell|\n|File Manager|Complete fi le explorer capabilities for local and remote hosts|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\nReleiceName = „Maobeu xqiyes””\n\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\Maobeu xqiyes\n\nConnectGroup = „””\n\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\Maobeu xqiyes\n\nMarkTime = „2017-10-19 17:21”\n\nThese steps that the dropper follows to install the RAT server are contained within a try-except block, which makes any potential error\nterminate the execution of the application.\n\nAlong with the server binary dropped on the system, a Visual Basic script (“jingtisanmenxiachuanxiao.vbs”) that is used for process cleanup is also written in the current folder.\n\nThe server’s binary gets extracted from its own resource section and is written to the \\Windows\\System32 folder with the name of the\ninstalled service (“Oracle.exe”).\n\nFinally, it calls StartService() to execute the second component, namely the RAT server that will have total control over the compromised\nhost from now on. It starts to communicate with the C2 servers and await instructions.\n\nUntil it checks in with its C2 controller, the RAT server searches for the encrypted confi guration buffer containing the C&Cs that will get\ndecrypted using an AES key derived from a hardcoded string “Mother360”. The C&C servers revealed after decryption are:\n\nrat.pzchao.com – used for sending instructions\n\ncenturiosa.info – used for sending instructions\n\nzl855.no-ip.info – used for requesting new confi guration fi le of the C2 servers\n\nIt will then set a Windows station, fi rst by saving the current station by calling GetProcessWindowStation() then creating a new one named\nwinsta0 by calling OpenWindowStation(). This happens because, according to MSDN, “Kernel objects are securable, while user objects\nand GDI objects are not. Therefore, in order to provide additional security, user interface objects are managed using window stations\nand desktops, which themselves are securable objects.”. It verifi es if an instance of this service is already running by checking if a global\ninstance variable is not “null”.\n\nNext, the RAT calls a function that uses the decrypted confi guration data to populate the following fi elds: lpszHost, dwPort, lpszProxyHost,\ndwProxyPort, lpszProxyUser, lpszProxyPass. If the proxy variables exist and are being populated, the socket used to connect to the C2\nRAT client gets confi gured to use the PROXY_SOCKS confi g. To determine how long the server has been connected to the client, the return\nvalue of the function GetTickCount() gets saved. The fi rst check-in to the client consists of a login token (TOKEN_LOGIN) that is followed\nby the data encapsulated in a “LOGINDATA” structure. The attacker uses this initial information as a fi ngerprint of the system, which proves\nt l f l i d t i i th i t f th i f t d t t d it t ti l l th t k\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\nOnce the attacker receives the fi ngerprint packet, it is decrypted and parsed. A new row is then added to the Connections tab grid of the\nclient interface and the details of the server host are populated in the appropriate fi elds. The number of active connections displayed on\nthe Connections tab grid status bar is incremented by 1.\n\nOnce the handshake is completed successfully with the client (C2), the RAT waits for commands. When a user of the C2 client needs to\n\nperform an action on a server from a compromised host, a Command packet containing the highlighted capabilities is created and sent.\n\nAnother trick that helps the malware fly below the radar is to change the C2 address to localhost when the attacker is not using the\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe network communication between the Gh0st RAT C2 client and a compromised host (server) is AES encrypted using the same string\n“Mother360” to derive the decryption key. The packets passed between the two endpoints consist of two fi elds, but lack the plaintext\nheader that was typical of Gh0st RAT in previous versions:\n\n1. A four-byte integer that contains the size in bytes of the entire packet.\n\n2. A variable-sized packet that contains the packet payload AES encrypted.\n\nThe client sends small requests - packets containing commands - and the server responds to those commands with the requested data.\n\nThe two endpoints communicate using a series of pre-defi ned commands. After the four byte integer that represents the size, the fi rst\nbyte of the packet payload contains an operation code. There are three types of codes: Commands, Tokens, and Modes. In the source\ncode, these codes are contained in a large enum in a header fi le.\n\n Command codes are sent by the attacker instructing the victim what to do. Examples:\n\n_COMMAND_WEBCAM_\n\n_COMMAND_SCREEN_SPY_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n_COMMAND_AUDIO_\n\n_COMMAND_SCREEN_BLOCK_INPUT_\n\n_COMMAND_PSLIST_\n\n Token codes that are passed between the two endpoints to ensure a clear protocol of the data being sent. Examples:\n\n_TOKEN_LOGIN_\n\n_TOKEN_DRIVE_LIST_\n\n_TOKEN_FILE_LIST_\n\n_TOKEN_FIRST_SCREEN_\n\n_TOKEN_AUDIO_DATA_\n\n Mode codes are used to determine in what circumstances the actions will be executed and to respond to specifi c\naction settings accordingly. Examples:\n\n_TRANSFER_MODE_NORMAL_\n\n_TRANSFER_MODE_UPDATE_\n\n_TRANSFER_MODE_CANCEL_\n\nAll these capabilities leave no doubt about the tool’s initial purpose and reach into the compromised device. It allows a remote attacker to\ntake full control of the system, spy on the victims and exfi ltrate confi dential information easily.\n\n### 3. The malware hosting infrastructure  \n\n**3.1. The HTTP File Server**\n\nWhile analyzing the download URL down.pzchao.com, we realized that it runs on a HTTP fi le server and we managed to obtain a list of\nall fi les hosted on it, including meta-information such as last modifi cation timestamps and number of downloads. A partial list of fi les\nand the number of hits can be seen in the image below:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\nAnother interesting aspect is that attackers often reset the download counters along with the IP Logs that keep a record of the targeted\nvictims of different campaigns. As shown in the hit log above, the most-downloaded malicious modules are the SFX installer and the\nGh0st RAT backdoor. The statistics also show that the number of hits (and implicitly, the number of victims) is constantly increasing, as\n\nper the graphic below:\n\n3.1.1. Backdoors\n\nThe malware server also hosts fi ve payloads that act as backdoors on the targeted systems. All fi ve payloads are versions of the Gh0st\nRAT tool. Two of these (8060.exe and 8555-.exe) communicate with the same main C&C server _rat.pzchao.com._ What differs is that\nthe packets exchanged between the client and the server begin with a plaintext header “Spidern”, followed by the data packet that is\ncompressed using zlib.\n\nThe other two samples (9527.exe and 8555++.exe) communicate with other two servers that are part of the infrastructure dll.pzchao.\n_com ; 455 pzchao com These versions will download the RAT server from dll pzchao com_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n**3.1.2.** **YPrat**\n\nThe download server also contains a Remote Access Trojan developed in Python (both client and server). This server is used to listen\nfor connections on the same IP but on a different port (444). Our analysis revealed that it has extra features, such as downloading and\nuploading fi les on remote infected systems, as well as information harvesting. Judging by the small number of downloads, we presume\nthat this payload is currently undergoing testing.\n\n**3.1.3** **Port Scanning Tools**\n\nAnother category of tools hosted on the same server is port scanning applications, complemented by a set of IP logs passed as an\nargument to the scanning tools. These logs feature a range of subnets, mainly located in Asia. They are contained within the IP logs,\nwhich means that, prior to an infection, the attackers fi rst search for vulnerabilities to exploit on the targeted systems.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nEven though the tools used in this particular attack are a few years old, they are battle-tested and more than suitable for future\nattacks. The ability to download most of these for free on certain underground hacking forums decreases the cost of attack without\ncompromising on stealth or effectiveness. Usually, threat actors are constantly modifying these tools to make them suitable for their\ntargets they have in their crosshairs: governments or strategic institutions such as education, telecommunication and so on.\n\nAs described in this paper, this remote access Torjan’s espionage capabilities and extensive intelligence harvesting from victims turns it\ninto an extremely powerful tool that is very diffi cult to identify. The C&C rotation during the Trojan’s lifecycle also helps evade detection at\nthe network level, while the impersonation of legitimate, known applications takes care of the rest.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhitepaper\n\n**4.** **Indicators of compromise (IoC)**\n\n718f9ca7a38a15b0d34a29a0b8b50c88bea9d67501ca6e2ae96fbc79edecdb9d\n\n2b98d9c0d30d09e791ad4dc981a17fa3e48fda7f1dfd68fd037946531e2cf718\n\nd26fb51be2d3db37fa37ba542365f616a1cecc3e4e0287e7a29a3a5a2dce7083\n\nd2591f4fe1c65e687c69cac007af27d24f656af5bc8eb8ff20064264fb71d56b\n\nda4f90ad50df05899bbcb7e9359da4541f989c57602ad2705eef1d561c99cfc3\n\ndca2e23324f7a740d431eef0083c0b795c63fb2f4ae4bc55bc236b12ea0510e2\n\nd26fb51be2d3db37fa37ba542365f616a1cecc3e4e0287e7a29a3a5a2dce7083\n\n2234a0ecb268aa8a855b23ad0c12cf39d1a18768c857ff6b8cd7af5e2f694525\n\nfb602ff538f71c04b2c8271514b3923d72543ed92e717c046884f3eb1317e2af\n\n97b69d8e0cf55708309c37d332137d10242a201c0dd93d6a513e5038dc139f57\n\n19841507ccf88d717a09bbba06a36644f1a555d1a53a11a2dea384bfccb9749f\n\n0ccc0fec930917707cf8573f4c5d0845197b95e300f8692757060910e50a1de6\n\n698db26e6f87e19dae93034fb9e1543e8675135e6da85120de20ab6ebbe9f30b\n\na1ea427062bc9c497ed0660845c7e395500bf3d7f2f64c2a3f1137437d8ab6c9\n\nd7c0d5f399cf3f6738373aa72a5624352ce9eec1d2420c2aa91f73c565b721fd\n\n5a28683ee05c11670e17639f4eb99609ac3d665c45d50746e5898d9efdfd4a83\n\nba2ffb1ff4003db3fdf3cf48b38b3ba6c447844b4399781cbb930fc9e11c23a4\n\n7b33a8c1184683f94598b4bb558f5050d5512b2cb66efa27d58322b97cf5569c\n\n81141007975251abadaa4c055f79999c0e61fb95724bfa4f98a91ced00534ebb\n\ndown.pzchao.com\n\nup.pzchao.com\n\ndll.pzchao.com\n\npzchao.com.445\n\nrat.pzchao.com\n\ncenturiosa.info\n\nzll855.no-ip.info\n\nzll855.gicp.net\n\n**h** l d hili i i b h lli b\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nBitdefender is a global security technology company that provides cutting edge end-to-end cyber security solutions and advanced threat protection to more than 500 million users in more than\n150 countries.
