Loader.dll decrypts the readme.txt file using a three byte XOR**\n\n**algorithm with 0xd07858 as a key, which results in shellcode that is responsible for decrypting**\n\n**the remainder of readme.txt containing the actual Bookworm Trojan. The shellcode then loads**\n\n**Bookworm by manually loading another DLL named “Leader.dll” embedded in the decrypted**\n\n**readme.txt and passes a buffer to Leader.dll containing additional DLLs. Leader.dll is the main**\n\n**component of Bookworm, which will we refer to as “Leader” for the remainder of this blog.**\n\n**The initial execution of Leader results in the installation of Bookworm. The installation process**\n\n**involves moving the legitimate executable and actor-created DLL to a new location. Bookworm**\n\n**also creates an additional file in this new location that has the same filename as the actor-**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\MsMpEng.exe_**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\MpSvc.dll_**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\MpSvc_**\n\n**Figure 2 Files created if the Microsoft Malware Protection was used to Sideload the DLL**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\ushata.exe_**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\ushata.dll_**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\ushata_**\n\n**Figure 3 Files created if the Kaspersky Antivirus application was used to Sideload the**\n\n**DLL**\n\n**After this process is completed, Bookworm changes how it loads itself, now reading the newly**\n\n**created file “MpSvc” or “ushata” instead of readme.txt. The newly created file is encrypted with**\n\n**RC4 using the contents of the following registry value as its key:**\n\n**_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Registration\\ProductID_**\n\n**The decrypted contents of this new file contain a path to the following file:**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\MachineKeys\\sgkey.data_**\n\n**The sgkey.data file contains the shellcode from readme.txt that loads the Bookworm modules,**\n\n**but instead of being encrypted with the three byte XOR algorithm like readme.txt, sgkey.data is**\n\n**encrypted with RC4 using the “ProductID” value as the key. The installation process finishes**\n\n**with the creation of a service named “Microsoft Windows DeviceSync Service”, which results in**\n\n**the addition of registry keys listed in Figure 4, which will run Bookworm when the system starts.**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\Type: 0x00000120_**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\Start: 0x00000002_**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\ErrorControl: 0x00000001_**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\ImagePath: “C:\\Documents and_**\n\n**_Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\MsMpEng.exe”_**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\DisplayName: “Microsoft Windows_**\n\n**_DeviceSync Service”_**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\ObjectName: “LocalSystem”_**\n\n**_HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DeviceSync\\Description: “Allows USB devices to_**\n\n**_be hosted on this computer.

If this service is disabled, any_**\n\n**_services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.”_**\n\n**Figure 4 Registry Keys Resulting from the Creation of the Bookworm Service**\n\n**Leader is Bookworm’s main module and controls all of the activities of the Trojan, but relies on**\n\n**the additional DLLs to provide specific functionality. The developers of Bookworm use these**\n\n**modules in a rather unique way, as the other embedded DLLs provide API functions for Leader**\n\n**to carry out its tasks. To load additional modules, Leader parses the buffer passed to it by the**\n\n**shellcode in readme.txt for the other DLLs, which exist in the following structure:**\n\n**_struct embedded_dll {_**\n\n**_DWORD dll_identifier;_**\n\n**_DWORD length_of_dll;_**\n\n**_char[length_of_dll] embedded_dll;_**\n\n**_};_**\n\n**Table 1 contains all of the embedded DLLs in each Bookworm sample, their ID numbers, and a**\n\n**description of the functionality of each DLL’s API functions provided to Leader. It should be noted**\n\n**that Bookworm does not write any of these DLLs to the filesystem, as the Trojan operates**\n\n**entirely in memory.**\n\n**Name** **DLL ID #** **Description**\n\n**Leader.dll** **0x5** **Main module.

Leader then uses the “dll_identifier” (DLL ID # in Table**\n\n**1) value to determine the appropriate arguments to send to the DLL when calling the**\n\n**ProgramStartup function. Leader then passes a pointer to a structure to each loaded DLL with**\n\n**each DLL receiving a different offset that it will set with addresses of its internal functions. The**\n\n**purpose of passing a structure to each DLL is to populate one large structure that allows Leader**\n\n**to call specific functions within each DLL, which is very similar conceptually to the import**\n\n**address table of a portable executable. Figure 5 below visualizes this concept, showing Leader**\n\n**calling example functions in the Bookworm modules to carry out various tasks.**\n\n**Figure 5 Visualization of Leader using other Bookworm Modules’ API Functions to Carry**\n\n**out Tasks**\n\n**By using this type of modular framework, the developers of Bookworm have made static**\n\n**analysis of the Trojan quite challenging. To perform static analysis of Bookworm, an analyst**\n\n**must recreate the structure used by Leader to store the API functions of each DLL and apply**\n\n**them throughout the entire Trojan. Without performing this task, an analyst would be unable to**\n\n**determine which API function Leader calls within the supporting DLLs. For example, Figure 6**\n\n**below shows a code block within Leader that is responsible for encrypting a buffer using**\n\n**functions within the AES module; however, the red, blue, and green boxes show calls to**\n\n**functions based on an offset in a structure.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6 Bookworm Calling API Functions using an Offset to its Structure**\n\n**At first glance, an analyst would be unable to determine the purpose of the code block displayed**\n\n**in Figure 6, as the functions called are not readily apparent. By creating a structure and**\n\n**populating it with the correct API functions however, an analyst can determine the API functions**\n\n**called in this code block. In Figure 7 below, the red, blue and green boxes show calls to three**\n\n**functions within the AES module that allow Leader to encrypt data using the AES algorithm.**\n\n**Figure 7 Applying Bookworm’s API Structure Exposes the API Functions Called**\n\n**Not only does this modular approach require an analyst to create a structure, but it also takes**\n\n**away an analyst’s ability to use cross references (XREFs) on the API functions within the**\n\n**supporting modules. Using XREFs during static analysis is a common technique to quickly find**\n\n**where functions of interest are called. An analyst cannot use this method to find where Leader is**\n\n**calling specific Bookworm APIs because the functions are not called directly; rather they are**\n\n**called based on the structure offset. We are unsure if the developers of Bookworm created this**\n\n**as an analysis hurdle, but it certainly contributes to anti-analysis tactics.**\n\n**Although the developers of Bookworm have included only keylogging functionality in Bookworm**\n\n**as a core ability, as suggested in Table 1, several of the embedded DLLs provide Leader with**\n\n**cryptographic and hashing functions, while others support Leader’s ability to communicate with**\n\n**its C2 server. The developers designed Bookworm to be a modular Trojan not limited to just the**\n\n**initial architecture of the Trojan, as Bookworm can also load additional modules provided by the**\n\n**C2 server. The ability to load additional modules from the C2 extends the capabilities of the**\n\n**Trojan to accommodate any activities the threat actors need to carry out on the compromised**\n\n**system.**\n\n**The KBLogger.dll module, which we will refer to as KBLogger, provides key logging and**\n\n**clipboard grabbing functionality and is the only Bookworm module that does not provide Leader**\n\n**with API functions. Instead, Leader creates a new process “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\dllhost.exe**\n\n**–user” that it injects itself into and uses to execute the KBLogger functionality.**\n\n**KBLogger runs on its own by creating a new window called “DolefulClass<username><PID>”,**\n\n**which is hidden so it is invisible to the user. The new window executes code that will create the**\n\n**following folder to store files that contain logged keystrokes and stolen clipboard contents:**\n\n**_%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\MachineKeys\\<crc32 hash>bk_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**keystrokes and clipboard contents are encrypted before KBlogger saves them to the file system**\n\n**using the RC4 algorithm using a key derived from the value at the following registry key:**\n\n**_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Registration\\ProductID_**\n\n**KBLogger will generate the key for the RC4 algorithm by using XOR and an eight-byte key**\n\n**(specifically 0x6E, 0x30, 0xD0, 0x30, 0xB9, 0x30, 0xB1, 0x30) on the value of the above**\n\n**registry key. KBLogger creates files with the naming format “<username XOR with 2 byte key**\n\n**0x5878>_<seconds since EPOCH>” to store the captured keystrokes and clipboard. For**\n\n**example, on November 3, 2015, we saw the following file created during by KBLogger on an**\n\n**analysis system with a username of “administrator”:**\n\n**_191c351136112b0c2a192c172a_56391E90_**\n\n**Bookworm uses a state machine to keep track of and carry out communications between the**\n\n**compromised system and the C2 server. Also, Bookworm uses a combination of encryption and**\n\n**compression algorithms to obfuscate the traffic between the system and C2 server. We have**\n\n**seen the following encryption and compression methods used at various stages and in differing**\n\n**combinations in the C2 communications:**\n\n**RC4**\n\n**AES**\n\n**XOR with 0x5a**\n\n**LZO**\n\n**Bookworm first creates an HTTP request that acts as a network beacon to notify the C2 of the**\n\n**compromised system. The initial network beacon is either an HTTP GET or POST request,**\n\n**which varies between Bookworm samples. Unit 42 analyzed the contents of a beacon seen in**\n\n**Figure 8, which was sent to a URL that follows a structure of “http://<c2 server>:<port>/0<crc32**\n\n**hash of tick count><tick count><encrypted data>”. The encrypted data in the URL is a 32**\n\n**character string (16 hexadecimal bytes) created by RC4 and AES encrypting an empty data**\n\n**buffer using the tick count and crc32 hash of the tick count as a key.**\n\n**Figure 8 Initial C2 Beacon from Bookworm sample 8ae2468d3f208d07fb47ebb1e0e297d7**\n\n**Subsequent HTTP POST requests from Bookworm to the C2 server include campaign identifier**\n\n**and system uptime. The data in the HTTP POST has a structure of “\\x03\\x04<campaign**\n\n**code>\\x00<system uptime>”. Leader then compresses this string using the LZO compression**\n\n**algorithm and compares the compressed length to the original string length. Leader uses the**\n\n**shorter of the two strings and appends it to a DWORD that is the size of the data and encrypts**\n\n**the combined string using AES with a key of “0123456789” and XOR with a key of 0x5a. We**\n\n**believe the threat actors use the data in these POST requests to map the compromised system**\n\n**to the appropriate campaign and to filter out analysis systems. In our follow-up blog we will**\n\n**further discuss the campaign codes identified in our analysis.**\n\n**The threat actors also deliver additional modules to Bookworm via C2 communications. To load**\n\n**additional modules into Bookworm, Leader parses C2 responses for data that have the following**\n\n**structure:**\n\n**<MD5 of cleartext of module><encrypted module>**\n\n**Leader skips the first 16 bytes and RC4 decrypts the remaining data with the key “0123456789”.**\n\n**It then computes the MD5 hash of the resulting cleartext and checks this hash with the MD5 in**\n\n**the first 16 bytes of the C2 response data to see if it is the same. If the MD5 hashes match, then**\n\n**the code will carry out further checks on the decrypted data to determine if the data is a new**\n\n**DLL for Leader to load as an additional module. At this time, Unit 42 has not seen a Bookworm**\n\n**C2 server provide additional modules via network communications. By performing static**\n\n**analysis on Leader.dll, we know that Leader will load the additional modules and attempt to call**\n\n**“ProgramStartup” and “QueryBuffer” functions exported by the DLLs.**\n\n**While we did not discuss the surrounding attacks using Bookworm in detail, we have observed**\n\n**threat actors deploying Bookworm primarily in attacks on targets in Thailand. The developers of**\n\n\n-----\n\n**actors will continue development Bookworm, and will continue to use it for the foreseeable**\n\n**future.**\n\n**sgkey.data**\n\n**bkmail.blogdns[.]com**\n\n**debain.servehttp[.]com**\n\n**linuxdns.sytes[.]net**\n\n**news.nhknews[.]hk**\n\n**sswmail.gotdns[.]com**\n\n**sswwmail.gotdns[.]com**\n\n**sysnc.sytes[.]net**\n\n**systeminfothai[.]gotdns.ch**\n\n**thailandbbs.ddns[.]net**\n\n**ubuntudns.sytes[.]net**\n\n**web12.nhknews[.]hk**\n\n**0f41c853a2d522e326f2c30b4b951b04**\n\n**8ae2468d3f208d07fb47ebb1e0e297d7**\n\n**35755a6839f3c54e602d777cd11ef557**\n\n**87d71401e2b8978c2084eb9a1d59c172**\n\n**599b6e05a38329081b80a461b57cec37**\n\n**ba1aea40182861e1d1de8c0c2ae78cb7**\n\n**de1595a7585219967a87a909f38acaa2**\n\n**f8c8c6683d6ca880293f7c1a78d7f8ce**\n\n**0b4ad1bd093e0a2eb8968e308e900180**\n\n**cba74e507e9741740d251b1fb34a1874**\n\n**fcd68032c39cca3385c539ea38914735**\n\n**3e69c34298a8fd5169259a2fef506d63**\n\n**04d63e2a3da0a171e5c15d8e904387b9**\n\n**0d57d2bef1296be62a3e791bfad33bcd**\n\n**4389fc820d0edd96bac26fa0b7448aee**\n\n**74c293acdda0d2c3b5087763dae27ec6**\n\n**b030c619bb24804cbcc05065530fcf2e**\n\n**29df124f370752a87b3426dcad539ec6**\n\n**9df45e8d8619e234d0449daf2f617ba3**\n\n**40f1b160b88ff98934017f3f1e7879a5**\n\n**210816c8bde338bf206f13bb923327a1**\n\n**187cdb58fbc30046a35793818229c573**\n\n**0b4ad1bd093e0a2eb8968e308e900180**\n\n**499ccc8d6d7c08e135a91928ccc2fd7a**\n\n**5e4852c8e5ef3cbceb69a9bc3d554d6c**\n\n**5282b503b061eaa843c0bcda1c74b14f**\n\n\n-----\n\n**November 10, 2015 4:34 PM**\n## Kaspersky and Microsoft Security Products Abused to Install Spying Trojan | Wolf Halton, Open-Source Security\n\n**November 11, 2015 5:37 AM**\n## Attackers Abuse Security Products to Install \"Bookworm\" Trojan | Cyber Security News\n\n**November 11, 2015 11:19 PM**\n## Hackers Exploit Kaspersky, Microsoft Security Products to Install Snooping Trojan | HacktheW0r1d-Hacking News affairs\n\n**November 13, 2015 10:36 PM**\n## Троян Bookworm использует для работы компоненты антивирусов | Around Cyber\n\n**November 15, 2015 10:46 AM**\n## Attackers Abuse Security Products to Install “Bookworm” Trojan | »XoZZeN«\n\n\n-----",
