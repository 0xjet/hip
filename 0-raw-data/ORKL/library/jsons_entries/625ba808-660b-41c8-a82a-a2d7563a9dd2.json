Over the past four years, these actors have gained_\n_access to multiple U.S. and global IT service providers and their customers in an effort to steal the_\n_intellectual property and sensitive data of companies located in at least 12 countries. The U.S._\n_Government is taking steps to hold the Chinese government accountable for these unacceptable_\n_actions and help victim organizations secure their networks and data._\n\n_For more information related to this activity, go to_ _[https://www.us-cert.gov/china.](https://www.us-cert.gov/china)_\n\nThe National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), a part of the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has become aware of an emerging\nsophisticated campaign, occurring since at least May 2016, that uses multiple malware implants. Initial\nvictims have been identified in several sectors, including Information Technology, Energy, Healthcare\nand Public Health, Communications, and Critical Manufacturing.\n\nAccording to preliminary analysis, threat actors appear to be leveraging stolen administrative credentials\n(local and domain) and certificates, along with placing sophisticated malware implants on critical\nsystems. Some of the campaign victims have been IT service providers, where credential compromises\ncould potentially be leveraged to access customer environments. Depending on the defensive\nmitigations in place, the threat actor could possibly gain full access to networks and data in a way that\nappears legitimate to existing monitoring tools.\n\nAlthough this activity is still under investigation, NCCIC is sharing this information to provide\norganizations information for the detection of potential compromises within their organizations.\n\nNCCIC will update this document as information becomes available.\n\nFor a downloadable copy of this report and listings of IOCs, see:\n\nTo report activity related to this Incident Report Alert, please contact NCCIC at\n[NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 1-888-282-0870.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov)\n\n## Description\n\n Risk Evaluation\n\n\n-----\n\n**NCCIC Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS) Rating Priority Level (Color)**\n\nYellow (Medium)\n\nA medium priority incident may affect public health or safety, national security, economic security,\nforeign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.\n\n## Details\n\nWhile NCCIC continues to work with a variety of victims across different sectors, the adversaries in this\ncampaign continue to affect several IT service providers. To achieve operational efficiencies and\neffectiveness, many IT service providers often leverage common core infrastructure that should be\nlogically isolated to support multiple clients.\n\nIntrusions into these providers create opportunities for the adversary to leverage stolen credentials to\naccess customer environments within the provider network.\n\n_Figure 1: Structure of a traditional business network and an IT service provider network_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe threat actors in this campaign have been observed employing a variety of tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs). The actors use malware implants to acquire legitimate credentials then leverage\nthose credentials to pivot throughout the local environment. NCCIC is aware of several compromises\ninvolving the exploitation of system administrators’ credentials to access trusted domains as well as the\nmalicious use of certificates. Additionally, the adversary makes heavy use of PowerShell and the open\nsource PowerSploit tool to enable assessment, reconnaissance, and lateral movement.\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand and Control (C2) primarily occurs using RC4 cipher communications over port 443 to\ndomains that change IP addresses. Many of these domains spoof legitimate sites and content, with a\nparticular focus on spoofing Windows update sites. Most of the known domains leverage dynamic DNS\nservices, and this pattern adds to the complexity of tracking this activity. Listings of observed domains\nare found in this document’s associated STIX package and .xlsx file. The indicators should be used to\nobserve potential malicious activity on your network.\n\nUser impersonation via compromised credentials is the primary mechanism used by the adversary.\nHowever, a secondary technique to maintain persistence and provide additional access into the victim\nnetwork is the use of malware implants left behind on key relay and staging machines. In some\ninstances, the malware has only been found within memory with no on-disk evidence available for\nexamination. To date, the actors have deployed multiple malware families and variants, some of which\nare currently not detected by anti-virus signatures. The observed malware includes PLUGX/SOGU and\nREDLEAVES. Although the observed malware is based on existing malware code, the actors have\nmodified it to improve effectiveness and avoid detection by existing signatures.\n\nBoth REDLEAVES and PLUGX have been observed being executed on systems via dynamic-link library\n(DLL) side-loading. The DLL side-loading technique utilized by these malware families typically involves\nthree files: a non-malicious executable, a malicious DLL loader, and an encoded payload file. The\nmalicious DLL is named as one of the DLLs that the executable would normally load and is responsible\nfor decoding and executing the payload into memory.\n\n## REDLEAVES Malware\n\nThe most unique implant observed in this campaign is the REDLEAVES malware. The REDLEAVES\nimplant consists of three parts: an executable, a loader, and the implant shellcode. The REDLEAVES\nimplant is a remote administration Trojan (RAT) that is built in Visual C++ and makes heavy use of\nthread generation during its execution. The implant contains a number of functions typical of RATs,\nincluding system enumeration and creating a remote shell back to the C2.\n\n**Capabilities**\n\n**System Enumeration. The implant is capable of enumerating the following information about the victim**\nsystem and passing it back to the C2:\n\nsystem name,\nsystem architecture (x86 or x64),\noperating system major and minor versions,\namount of available memory,\nprocessor specifications,\nlanguage of the user,\nprivileges of the current process,\ngroup permissions of the current user,\nsystem uptime,\nIP address, and\nprimary drive storage utilization.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command Execution. The implant can execute a command directly inside a command shell using**\nnative Windows functionality by passing the command to run to cmd.exe with the “/c” option (“cmd.exe\n/c <command>”).\n\n**Command Window Generation. The implant can also execute commands via a remote shell that is**\ngenerated and passed through a named pipe. A command window is piped back to the C2 over the\nnetwork as a remote shell or alternatively to another process or thread that can communicate with that\npipe. The implant uses the mutexRedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex.\n\n**File System Enumeration. The implant has the ability to enumerate data within a specified directory,**\nwhere it gathers filenames, last file write times, and file sizes.\n\n**Network Traffic Compression and Encryption. The implant uses a form of LZO compression to**\ncompress data that is sent to its C2. After compression, the data for this implant sample is then RC4ciphered with the key 0x6A6F686E3132333400 (this corresponds to the string “john1234” with the null\nbyte appended).\n\nNetwork Communications REDLEAVES connects to the C2 over TCP port 443, but does not use the\nsecure flag when calling the API function InternetOpenUrlW. The data is not encrypted and there is no\nSSL handshake as would normally occur with port 443 traffic, but rather the data is transmitted in the\nform that is generated by the RC4 cipher.\n\nCurrent REDLEAVES samples that have been examined have a hard-coded C2. Inside the implant’s\nconfiguration block in memory were the strings in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1: REDLEAVES Sample Strings Found in C2_\n```\n QN4869MD – mutex used to determine if the implant is already running (Varies from\n sample to sample)\n\n```\n```\n2016-5-1-INCO –Unknown\n\n```\n```\n%windir.\\system32\\svchost.exe - process that the implant was injected into\n\n```\n```\njohn1234 (with the null byte afterward) – RC4 Key\n\n```\n\nWhile the name of the initial mutex, QN4869MD in this sample, varies among REDLEAVES samples,\nthe RedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex mutex name appears to be consistent. Table 2 contains a sample\nof the implant communications to the domain windowsupdates.dnset[.]com over TCP port 443.\n\n_Table 2: REDLEAVES Sample Beacon_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n--- BEGIN SAMPLE BEACON --\n```\n```\n00000000 c1 0c 00 00 7a 8d 9b dc 88 00 00 00 ....z... ....\n\n```\n```\n0000000C 14 6f 68 6e 16 6f 68 6e c4 a4 b1 d1 c4 e6 24 eb .ohn.ohn ......$.\n0000001C cf 49 81 a7 a1 c7 96 ff 6d 31 b4 48 8b 3e a3 c1 .I...... m1.H.>..\n0000002C 92 e2 c3 7c e4 4c cf e9 e1 fa fb 6a fa 66 2c bf ...|.L.. ...j.f,.\n0000004C 7b 13 a7 30 17 3d eb fb d3 16 0e 96 83 21 2e 73 {..0.=.. .....!.s\n0000005C dc 44 a2 72 fb f4 5e d0 4d b7 85 be 33 cd 13 21 .D.r..^.

The first header comes in its own packet, with the second header and the payload\nfollowing in a separate packet within the same TCP stream. The last four bytes of the first header\ncontain the number of the remaining bytes in little-endian format (0x88 in the sample beacon above).\n\nThe second header, starting at position 0x0C, is XOR’d with the first four bytes of the key that is used to\nencrypt the payload. In the case of this sample, those first four bytes would be “john” (or 0x6a6f686e\nusing the ASCII hex codes). After the XOR operation, the bytes in positions 0x0C through 0x0F contain\nthe length of the decrypted and decompressed payload. The bytes in positions 0x10 through 0x13\ncontain the length of the encrypted and compressed payload.\n\nTo demonstrate, in the sample beacon, the second header follows:\n\n0000000C 14 6f 68 6e 16 6f 68 6e c4 a4 b1 d1\n\nThe length of the decrypted and decompressed payload is 0x7e000000 in little-endian format\n(0x146f686e XOR 0x6a6f686e). The length of the encrypted and compressed payload is 0x7c000000 in\nlittle-endian (0x166f686e XOR 0x6a6f686e). This is verified by referring back to the sample beacon\nwhich had the number of remaining bytes set to 0x88 and subtracting the length of the second header\n(0x88 – 0xC = 0x7c).\n\n**Strings**\n\n_Note: Use caution when searching based on strings, as common strings may cause a large number of_\n_false positives._\n\n_Table 3: Strings Appearing in the Analyzed Sample of REDLEAVES_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[ Unique Ascii strings ] -------------------\n```\n```\nred_autumnal_leaves_dllmain.dll\n\n```\n```\nwindowsupdates.dnset.com windowsupdates.dnset.com\n\n```\n```\nwindowsupdates.dnset.com\n\n```\n```\n2016-5-10-INCO\n\n```\n```\njohn1234\n\n```\n```\nFeb 04 2015\n\n```\n```\n127.0.0.1 169.254\n\n```\n```\ntcp\n\n```\n```\nhttps\n\n```\n```\nhttp\n\n```\n```\n[ Unique Unicode strings ] -----------------\n```\n```\nRedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex\n\n```\n```\nQN4869MD\n\n```\n```\n\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\NamePipe_MoreWindows\n\n```\n```\nnetwork.proxy.type\n\n```\n```\nnetwork.proxy.http_port\n\n```\n```\nnetwork.proxy.http network.proxy.autoconfig_url\n\n```\n```\nnetwork.proxy.\na([a-zA-Z0-9])\n\n```\n```\nb([ \\\\t])\n\n```\n```\nc([a-zA-Z])\n\n```\n```\nd([0-9])\n\n```\n```\nh([0-9a-fA-F])\n\n```\n```\nn(\\r|(\\r?\\n)) q(\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\")|('[^']*')\n\n```\n```\nw([a-zA-Z]+)\n\n```\n```\nz([0-9]+)\n\n```\n\n**Malware Execution Analysis**\n\n**File Name: VeetlePlayer.exe**\n\n**MD5: 9d0da088d2bb135611b5450554c99672**\n\n**File Size: 25704 bytes (25.1 KB)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Description: This is the executable that calls the exports located within libvlc.dll**\n\n**File Name: libvlc.dll**\n\n**MD5: 9A8C76271210324D97A232974CA0A6A3**\n\n**File Size: 33792 bytes (33.0 KB)**\n\n**Description: This is the loader and decoder for mtcReport.ktc, the combined shellcode and implant file.**\n\n**File Name: mtcReport.ktc**\n\n**MD5: 3045E77E1E9CF9D9657AEA71AB5E8947**\n\n**File Size: 231076 bytes (225.7 KB)**\n\n**Description: This is the encoded shellcode and implant file.

The implant has the MZ and PE flags replaced with the value 0xFF.\n\nAll three of these files must be present for execution of the malware to succeed.\n\nWhen all files are present and the VeetlePlayer.exe file is executed, it will make calls to the following\nDLL exports within the libvlc.dll file:\n\nVLC_Version checks to see if its calling file is named “VeetlePlayer.exe”.

It checks the QN4869MD mutex to see if it\n is already running. It will then perform initial enumeration of the system to\n include operating system versions, number of processors, RAM, and CPU information.\n\n```\n**PLUGX**\n\nPLUGX is a sophisticated Remote Access Tool (RAT) operating since approximately 2012. Although\nthere are now many variants of this RAT in existence today, there are still characteristics common to\nmost variants.\n\nTypically, PLUGX uses three components to install itself.\n\n1. A non-malicious executable\n2. A malicious DLL/installer\n3. An encoded payload – the PLUGX RAT.\n\nA non-malicious executable with one or more imports is used to start the installation process. The\nexecutable will likely exist in a directory not normally associated with its use. In some cases, the actor\nmay use an executable signed with a valid certificate, and rename the DLL and encoded payload with\nfile names that suggest they are related to the trusted file. Importantly, the actor seems to vary the\nencoding scheme used to protect the encoded payload to stifle techniques used by AV vendors to\ndevelop patterns to detect it. The payload is either encoded with a single byte or encrypted and\ndecompressed. Recently, NCCIC has observed a case where the encoded payload contains a decoding\nstub within itself, beginning at byte zero. The malware simply reads this payload and executes it starting\nat byte zero. The stub then decodes and executes the rest of itself in memory. Notably, this stub varies\nin its structure and algorithm, again stifling detection by signature based security software. The PLUGX\nmalware is never stored on disk in an unencrypted or decoded format.\n\nWhen the initial executable is launched, the imported library, usually a separate DLL, is replaced with a\nmalicious version that in turn decodes and installs the third and final component, which is the PLUGX\nrat itself. Typically, the PLUGX component is obfuscated and contains no visible executable code until it\nis unpacked in memory, protecting it from AV/YARA scans while static. During the evolution of these\nPLUGX compromises, NCCIC noted an increasing implementation of protections of the actual decoded\nPLUGX in memory. For example, the most recent version we looked at implements a secure strings\nmethod, which hides the majority of the common commands used by PLUGX. This is an additional\nfeature designed to thwart signature based security tools.\n\nOnce the PLUGX RAT is installed on the victim, the actors has complete C2 capabilities of the victim\nsystem, including the ability to take screenshots and download files from the compromised system. The\ncommunications between the RAT (installed on the victim system) and the PLUGX C2 server are\nencoded to secure the communication and stifle detection by signature based network signature tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe advanced capabilities of PLUGX are implemented via a plugin framework. Each plugin operates\nindependently in its own unique thread within the service. The modules may vary based on variants.\nTable 5 lists the modules and capabilities contained within one sample recently analyzed by NCCIC.\n\n_Table 5: Modules and Capabilities of PLUGX_\n\n**Module**\n**Name** **Capability**\n\nDisk wide range of system-related capabilities including file / directory / drive enumeration, file /\ndirectory creation, create process, and obtain environment variables\n\nKeylog logs keystrokes and saves data to log file\n\nNethood enumerates the host's network resources via the Windows multiple provider router DLL\n\nNetstat set the state of a TCP connection or obtain the extended TCP or UDP tables (lists of\nnetwork endpoints available to a process) of each active process on the host\n\nOption provides the ability to initiate a system shutdown, adjust shutdown-related privileges for a\ngiven process, and lock the user's workstation\n\nPortmap port mapping\n\nProcess process enumeration, termination, and capability to obtain more in-depth information\npertaining to each process (e.g. CompanyName, FileDescription, FileVersion of each\nmodule loaded by the process)\n\nRegedit create, read, update & delete registry entries\n\nScreen capability to capture screenshots of the system\n\nService start, stop, remove, configure & query services\n\nShell remote shell access\n\nSQL enumerate SQL databases and available drivers; execute SQL queries\n\nTelnet provides a telnet interface\n\nThe PLUGX operator may dynamically add, remove, or update PLUGX plugins during runtime. This\nprovides the ability to dynamically adjust C2 capabilities based on the requirements of the C2 operator.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork activity is often seen as POST requests similar to that shown in table 6. Network defenders can\nlook to detect non-SSL HTTP traffic on port 443, which can be indicative of malware traffic. The PLUGX\nmalware is also seen using TCP ports 80, 8080, and 53.\n\n_Table 6: Sample PLUGX Beacon_\n\n```\nPOST /D15DB9E25ADA34EC9E559736 HTTP/1.1    \n\n```\n```\nAccept:       */*\n\n```\n```\nHX1:   0\nHX2:   0\n\n```\n```\nHX3:   61456\n\n```\n```\nHX4:   1\n\n```\n```\nUser-Agent:    Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET\nCLR 2.0.50727; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\n```\n```\nHost:  sc.weboot.info:443\n\n```\n```\nContent-Length:       0\n\n```\n```\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\n\nEven though the beacon went to port 443, which is commonly used for encrypted HTTP\ncommunications, this traffic was plaintext HTTP, as is common for this variant of PLUGX.\n\n**For IT Service Providers**\n\nAll organizations that provide IT services as a commodity for other organizations should evaluate their\ninfrastructure to determine if related activity has taken place. Active monitoring of network traffic for the\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) provided in this report, as well as behavior analysis for similar activity,\nshould be conducted to identify C2 traffic. In addition, frequency analysis should be conducted at the\nlowest level possible to determine any unusual fluctuation in bandwidth indicative of a potential data\nexfiltration. Both management and client systems should be evaluated for host indicators provided. If an\nintrusion is suspected, please reach out to the NCCIC at the contact information provided at the end of\nthis report.\n\n**For Private Organizations and Government Agencies**\n\nAll organizations should include the IOCs provided in their normal intrusion detection systems for\ncontinual analysis. Organizations that determine their risk to be elevated due to alignment to the sectors\nbeing targeted, unusual detected activity, or other factors, should conduct a dedicated investigation to\nidentify any related activity. Organizations which leverage external IT service providers should validate\nwith their providers that due diligence is being conducted to validate if there are security concerns with\ntheir specific provider. If an intrusion is suspected, please reach out to the NCCIC at the contact\ninformation provided at the end of this report.\n\n**Detection**\n\n\n-----\n\nNCCIC is providing a compilation of IOCs from a variety of sources to aid in the detection of this\nmalware.

In addition, tools like System Internals PSEXEC will mount the\nshares automatically for the user. Since administrators may map administrative shares legitimately while\nmanaging components of the network, this must be taken into account.\n\nFilter network traffic for SMB mapping events and group the events by source IP, destination IP,\nthe mounted path (providing a count of total mounts to that path), the first map time, and the last\nmap time\nCollect Windows Event Logs – Event ID 5140 (network share object was accessed) can be used\nto track C$ and ADMIN$ mounts by searching the Share Name field\n\n**VPN User authentication mismatch: A VPN user authentication match occurs when a user account**\nauthenticates to an IP address but once connected the internal IP address requests authentication\ntokens for other users. This may create false positives for legitimate network administrators but if this is\ndetected, organizations should verify that the administrative accounts were legitimately used.\n\n**VPN activity from VPS providers: While this may also produce false positives, VPN logins from Virtual**\nPrivate Server (VPS) providers may be an indicator of VPN users attempting to hide their source IP and\nshould be investigated.\n\n## Impact\n\nA successful network intrusion can have severe impacts, particularly if the compromise becomes public\nand sensitive information is exposed. Possible impacts include:\n\ntemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\ndisruption to regular operations,\nfinancial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and\npotential harm to an organization’s reputation.\n\n## Solution\n\nProperly implemented defensive techniques and programs make it more difficult for an adversary to\ngain access to a network and remain persistent yet undetected. When an effective defensive program is\nin place, actors should encounter complex defensive barriers. Actor activity should also trigger detection\nand prevention mechanisms that enable organizations to contain and respond to the intrusion more\nrapidly. There is no single or set of defensive techniques or programs that will completely avert all\nmalicious activities. Multiple defensive techniques and programs should be adopted and implemented in\na layered approach to provide a complex barrier to entry, increase the likelihood of detection, and\ndecrease the likelihood of a successful compromise. This layered mitigation approach is known as\ndefense-in-depth.\n\nNCCIC mitigations and recommendations are based on observations made during the hunt, analysis,\nand network monitoring for threat actor activity, combined with client interaction.\n\n**Whitelisting**\n\nEnable application directory whitelisting through Microsoft Software Restriction Policy (SRP) or\nAppLocker;\n\n\n-----\n\nUse directory whitelisting rather than trying to list every possible permutation of applications in an\nenvironment. Safe defaults allow applications to run from PROGRAMFILES,\nPROGRAMFILES(X86), and SYSTEM32. All other locations should be disallowed unless an\nexception is granted.\nPrevent the execution of unauthorized software by using application whitelisting as part of the\nsecurity hardening of operating systems insulating.\nEnable application directory whitelisting via the Microsoft SRP or AppLocker.\n\n**Account Control**\n\nDecrease a threat actor’s ability to access key network resources by implementing the principle of\nleast privilege.\nLimit the ability of a local administrator account to login from a local interactive session (e.g.,\n“Deny access to this computer from the network”) and prevent access via a Remote Desktop\nProtocol session.\nRemove unnecessary accounts, groups, and restrict root access.\nControl and limit local administration.\nMake use of the Protected Users Active Directory group in Windows Domains to further secure\nprivileged user accounts against pass-the-hash compromises.\n\n**Workstation Management**\n\nCreate a secure system baseline image and deploy to all workstations.\nMitigate potential exploitation by threat actors by following a normal patching cycle for all operating\nsystems, applications, software, and all third-party software.\nApply asset and patch management processes.\nReduce the number of cached credentials to one if a laptop, or zero if a desktop or fixed asset.\n\n**Host-Based Intrusion Detection**\n\nConfigure and monitor system logs through host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) and\nfirewall.\nDeploy an anti-malware solution to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the\noperating system security baseline.\nMonitor antivirus scan results on a regular basis.\n\n**Server Management**\n\nCreate a secure system baseline image, and deploy to all servers.\nUpgrade or decommission end-of-life non Windows servers.\nUpgrade or decommission servers running Windows Server 2003 and older versions.\nImplement asset and patch management processes.\nAudit for and disable unnecessary services.\n\n**Server Configuration and Logging**\n\nEstablish remote server logging and retention.\nReduce the number of cached credentials to zero.\nConfigure and monitor system logs via a centralized security information and event management\n(SIEM) appliance.\nAdd an explicit DENY for “%USERPROFILE%”\n\n\n-----\n\nRestrict egress web traffic from servers.\nIn Windows environments, utilize Restricted Admin mode or remote credential guard to further\nsecure remote desktop sessions against pass-the-hash compromises.\nRestrict anonymous shares.\nLimit remote access by only using jump servers for such access.\n\n**Change Control**\n\nCreate a change control process for all implemented changes.\n\n**Network Security**\n\nAn Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should:\n\nImplement continuous monitoring.\nSend alerts to a SIEM tool.\nMonitor internal activity (this tool may use the same tap points as the netflow generation\ntools).\nNetflow Capture should:\n\nSet a minimum retention period of 180 days.\nCapture netflow on all ingress and egress points of network segments, not just at the\nManaged Trusted Internet Protocol Services (MTIPS) or Trusted Internet Connections (TIC)\nlocations.\nNetwork Packet Capture (PCAP):\n\nRetain PCAP data for a minimum of 24 hours.\nCapture traffic on all ingress and egress points of the network.\nUse a virtual private network (VPN):\n\nMaintain site-to-site VPN with customers.\nAuthenticate users utilizing site-to-site VPNs through adaptive security appliance (ASA).\nUse authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for controlling network access.\n\nRequire Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication to an HTTPS page on the ASA in\norder to control access. Authentication should also require explicit rostering of PIV\ndistinguished names (DNs) that are permitted to enhance the security posture on both\nnetworks participating in the site-to-site VPN.\nEstablish appropriate secure tunneling protocol and encryption.\nStrengthen router configuration (e.g., avoid enabling remote management over the Internet\nand using default IP ranges; automatically logout after configuring routers; use encryption).\nTurn off Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS), enforce the use of strong passwords, keep router\nfirmware up-to-date; and\nImprove firewall security (e.g., enable auto updates, revise firewall rules as appropriate,\nimplement whitelists, establish packet filtering, enforce the use of strong passwords, and\nencrypt networks).\nConduct regular vulnerability scans of the internal and external networks and hosted content to\nidentify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\nDefine areas within the network that should be segmented to increase visibility of lateral\nmovement by an adversary and increase the defense in-depth posture.\nDevelop a process to block traffic to IP addresses and domain names that have been identified as\nbeing used to aid previous malicious activities.\n\n**Network Infrastructure Recommendations**\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure you are following National Security Agency (NSA) network device integrity (NDI) best\npractices.\nEnsure your networking equipment has the latest available operating system and patches.\n\n**Host Recommendations**\n\nImplement policies to block workstations-to-workstation remote desktop protocol (RDP)\nconnections through group policy object (GPO) on Windows, or a similar mechanism.\nStore system logs of mission critical systems for at least one year within a SIEM.\nReview the configuration of application logs to verify fields being recorded will contribute to an\nincident response investigation.\n\n**Users Management**\n\nImmediately set the password policy to require complex passwords for all users (minimum of 15\ncharacters); this new requirement should be enforced as user passwords expire.\nReduce the number of domain and enterprise administrator accounts.\nCreate non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the non-privileged\naccount for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access);\nIf possible, use technical methods to detect or prevent browsing by privileged accounts\n(authentication to web proxies would enable blocking of domain administrators).\nUse two-factor authentication (e.g., security tokens for remote access and to any sensitive data\nrepositories);\nIf soft tokens are used, they should not exist on the same device that is requesting remote access\n(laptop), and instead should be on a telephone or other out-of-band device.\nCreate privileged role tracking;\n\nCreate a change control process to all privilege escalations and role changes on user\naccounts;\nEnable alerts on privilege escalations and role changes; and\nLog privileged user changes in the environment and alert on unusual events.\nEstablish least privilege controls; and\nImplement a security-awareness training program.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\nImplement a vulnerability assessment and remediation program.\nEncrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest.\nCreate an insider threat program.\nAssign additional personnel to review logging and alerting data.\nComplete independent security (not compliance) audit.\nCreate an information sharing program.\nComplete and maintain network and system documentation to aid in timely incident response,\nincluding:\n\nnetwork diagrams,\nasset owners,\ntype of asset, and\nan up-to-date incident response plan.\n\n## References\n\n\n-----\n\n## Revisions\n\nApril 27, 2017: Initial post\n\nApril 28, 2017: Updated guidance under the sub-section: Network Infrastructure Recommendations\n\nMay 2, 2017: In table 11, fixed trailing quote on date\n\nMay 11, 2017: STIX and XLSX package was updated\n\nDecember 20, 2018: Added attribution of activity covered in this Alert to Chinese cyber actors\nassociated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\n\n\n-----",
