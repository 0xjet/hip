Today, we are releasing the full](http://cccc-2015.com/#program)\nwhitepaper on the Potao malware with additional findings, the cyberespionage campaigns\nwhere it was employed, and its connection to a backdoor in the form of a modified version\nof the TrueCrypt encryption software.\n\n[Like BlackEnergy, the malware used by the so-called Sandworm APT group (also known as](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/14/cve-2014-4114-details-august-blackenergy-powerpoint-campaigns/)\nQuedagh), Potao is an example of targeted espionage malware directed mostly at targets in\nUkraine and a number of other post-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and\nBelarus\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1- Detection statistics for Win32/Potao according to ESET LiveGrid®\n\n**Attack Timeline**\n\nThe attacks conducted using the Win32/Potao malware family span the past 5 years, the\nfirst detections dating back to 2011. The attackers are, however, still very active, with the\nmost recent infiltration attempts detected by ESET in July 2015.\n\nThe timeline below lists a selection of Potao attack campaigns and other related events.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – Timeline of selected Patao campaigns\n\nAmong the victims identified, the most notable high-value targets include Ukrainian\ngovernment and military entities and one of the major Ukrainian news agencies. The\n[malware was also used to spy on members of MMM, a Ponzi scheme popular in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMM_%28Ponzi_scheme_company%29)\nand Ukraine.\n\n**Malware Techniques**\n\nWhen the criminals shifted their focus from attacking targets in Russia to others in Ukraine,\nthey began sending personalized SMS messages to their potential victims to lure them to\nlanding pages hosting the malware, disguised as postal tracking sites.\n\nWe haven’t noticed Win32/Potao employing any exploits and the malware isn’t particularly\ntechnically advanced. (Shouldn’t call it an APT then, right?) Yet it does contain a few other\ninteresting techniques that ‘get the job done’, like the mechanism for spreading via USB\ndrives and disguising executables as Word and Excel documents, as in the following\nexamples:\n\nFigure 3 – Potao droppers with MS Word icons and file names used in attacks against high-value\n\nUkrainian targets to capture the interest of recipients\n\n**Trojanized TrueCrypt**\n\nAn (A)PT malware family that has gone relatively unnoticed for five years and that has also\nbeen used to spy on Ukrainian governmental and military targets is certainly interesting in\nand of itself. However, perhaps the most attention-grabbing discovery related to this case\nwas when we observed a connection to the popular open-source encryption software,\nTrueCrypt.\n\nWe found out that the website truecryptrussia.ru has been serving modified versions of the\nencryption software that included a backdoor to selected targets. Clean versions of the\napplication are served to normal visitors to the website, i.e. people who aren’t of interest to\n\n\n-----\n\nthe attackers. ESET detects the trojanized TrueCrypt as [Win32/FakeTC. TrueCrypt Russia s](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_FakeTC/detail)\ndomain was also used as a C&C server for the malware.\n\nFigure 4 – TrueCrypt Russia’s Website\n\nThe connection to Win32/Potao, which is a different malware family from Win32/FakeTC, is\nthat FakeTC has been used to deliver Potao to victims’ systems in a number of cases.\n\nFakeTC is not, however, merely an infection vector for Potao (and possibly other malware)\nbut a fully functional and dangerous backdoor designed to exfiltrate files from the espionage\nvictims’ encrypted drives.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Interface of the trojanized Russian TrueCrypt\n\nIn addition to the selective targeting (deciding to whom to serve the trojanized version\ninstead of the clean one), the backdoor code also contained triggers that would only\nactivate the malicious data-stealing functionality for active, long-term TrueCrypt users.\nThese were surely contributing factors to the malware’s going unnoticed for such a long\ntime.\n\nFurther details on both Win32/Potao and Win32/FakeTC, including a technical analysis of\nthe malware, description of plugins, infection vectors, C&C communication protocol and\nother spreading campaigns not mentioned in this blog post are included in our\ncomprehensive whitepaper.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOC) that can be used to identify an infection can be found in the\n[whitepaper or on github: https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/potao](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/potao)\n\n30 Jul 2015 - 10:49AM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n\n-----\n\n## Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
