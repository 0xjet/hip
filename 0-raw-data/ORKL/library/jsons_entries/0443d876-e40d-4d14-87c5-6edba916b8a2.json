Ransomware can directly impact the operational technology (OT)\nenvironment if it is able to bridge the gap between enterprise and operations due to\nimproper security hygiene. Ransomware can also have indirect access on operations\nby impacting resources such as logistics, fleet management, sales operations and\nfulfillment, or loss of view to enterprise resource management tools. Additionally,\nin 2019 and through 2020, ransomware strains began incorporating ICS-focused\nmechanisms, such as containing code that can stop industrial processes, which can\nhave potentially disruptive effects. Attackers are becoming increasingly hostile in\nterms of attack behavior, including stealing data before deploying ransomware and\nthreatening companies with its release if ransomware is not paid.\n\nDragos monitors cyber events impacting ICS entities. IBM Security X-Force provides\nincident response and intelligence services to organizations across a range of\nverticals, including those with ICS and OT networks as part of their infrastructure.\nDragos and X-Force have observed a real appreciable rise in the number of both nonpublic and public ransomware events affecting ICS environments and operations.\nThrough joint collaboration, intelligence analysts mapped publicly known and\ninternal client incidents of ransomware attacks on industrial entities from 2018\nthrough October 2020. The goal of this research is to identify trends, impacts, and\nconsequences of ransomware on ICS.\n\nDragos and IBM assessed 194 confirmed ransomware attacks against ICS and\nsupporting entities. Researchers found ransomware against ICS entities and\nsupporting organizations increased 75% in this timeframe, with activity peaking in\nMay 2020. Of the attacks in which the scope of impact is known, 56% of ransomware\nattacks affected operations functionality at victim organizations, including in some\ncases weeks-long downtime. Manufacturing was the most targeted industry,\nfollowed by utility companies.\n\nThe information shared in this report is based on publicly available information as\nwell as data from incidents identified and responded to by X-Force and Dragos’\nServices team. It is worth noting that entities who experience disruptive ransomware\nevents frequently do not report them unless compelled by regulators. Thus, publicly\nreported details of ransomware attacks on ICS and related entities neglect to\nprovide a full picture of the threat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\n**•** **Ransomware attacks on industrial entities**\n**increased more than 500% from 2018 to**\n**2020.**\n\n**• Manufacturing entities comprise over one-**\n**third of confirmed ransomware attacks**\n**on industrial organizations, followed by**\n**utilities, which make up 10%.**\n\n**• Newer ransomware strains have the ability**\n**to stop industrial processes.**\n\n**• Ransomware operators are increasingly**\n**incorporating data theft and extortion**\n**operations into their attack techniques,**\n**potentially posing even greater impact from**\n**ransomware than disrupted operations**\n**through leaked intellectual property and**\n**other critical data.**\n\n**• Data stolen and leaked on publicly available**\n**websites could provide ICS-targeting**\n**attackers with victim data that could inform**\n**or guide future ICS-disruptive attacks.**\n\n**• Asset owners and operators should engage**\n**in effective defense-in-depth security**\n**strategies. Ensure an understanding of**\n**network interdependencies and conduct**\n**crown jewel analysis to identify potential**\n**weaknesses that could disrupt business**\n**continuity and production.**\n\n\n###### Ransomware Against ICS: Definition, History, Implications\n\nMalicious software that encrypts files and\ndisrupts computer operations for monetary\n\n\nextortion, known as ransomware, has existed\nfor decades. It is a large and increasing threat\nto ICS operations as ransomware attackers\nrecognize the value of targeting organizations\nthat have little tolerance for downtime—\nincluding many manufacturing and energy\ncompanies—and capitalize on that low tolerance\nin an effort to more consistently extract ransom\npayments from victims.\n\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya worms in 2017\ncrystalized the threat that ransomware and\ndisruptive IT malware posed to enterprise – and\nin many cases industrial – operations. These\nstate-sponsored cyberattacks disrupted global\noperations—from automotive production lines\nto shipping and logistics to semiconductor\nmanufacturing. With automated functionality\nleveraging vulnerabilities in Windows\ncomputers, these worms spread quickly and\nhaphazardly across the globe.\n\nHistorically, cybercrime operators largely\ntargeted victims with ransomware\nindiscriminately and actors aimed to get\nmoney from individual victims who would pay\nto get their sensitive data – such as financial\nor personal information – unlocked. In 2018,\ncriminal operators began shifting to what\nis known as “big game hunting.” Human\noperators specifically targeted a smaller pool\nof corporate and government victims with\nransomware in an effort to receive a higher\npayoff. The assumption was organizations\nand corporations would be willing to pay larger\nransoms to prevent extensive downtime and\nloss of productivity or revenue. An October\n2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation alert\ndescribed the issue thus: Since early 2018,\nthe incidents of “broad, [indiscriminate]\nransomware campaigns [have] sharply declined,\nbut the losses from ransomware attacks have\n\n1\n\nincreased significantly.”\n\n\n1 [FBI warns of major ransomware attacks as criminals go “big-game hunting” – Ars Technica (https://arstechnica.com/information-technolo-](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/fbi-warns-of-major-ransomware-attacks-as-criminals-go-big-game-hunting)\n\n[gy/2019/10/fbi-warns-of-major-ransomware-attacks-as-criminals-go-big-game-hunting/)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/fbi-warns-of-major-ransomware-attacks-as-criminals-go-big-game-hunting)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### RANSOMWARE IMPACTING INDUSTRIAL AND RELATED ENTITIES\n\n\nDragos and IBM identified ransomware attacks impacting industrial and related entities from 2018\nthrough October 2020. Analysts have observed a real, appreciative rise in ransomware targeting\nindustrial organizations, and many of the incidents have resulted in disruption to industrial\noperations.\n\nBetween January 2018 and October 2020, the number of tracked ransomware incidents impacting\nindustrial companies increased over 500%. In addition, analysis of the frequency of ransomware\nattacks on industrial organizations per month indicates that attacks have been trending slightly\nupward over time—with an all-time high in May 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Percent of total ransomware attacks on organizations with or supporting ICS networks, 2018 - 2020\n\nThe increase in ransomware events in 2020 appears to coincide with the spread of the coronavirus\npandemic globally. Ransomware adversaries leveraged coronavirus-themed phishing lures for initial\naccess operations, preying on users’ concern for health and safety.[3] In some cases, ransomware\nadversaries are targeting cold storage facilities and biomedical, and pharmaceutical manufacturers\nresearching and developing virus vaccines and distribution methods, which could disrupt the\ndevelopment and distribution of the vital drugs.

However,\nanalysts must acknowledge the major\ndisruptions to healthcare and hospitals due to\nransomware, and the significant harm caused\nby these events.[5] The amount and scope of\nattacks on healthcare entities is concerning\nand Dragos assesses with high confidence\nthese attacks will continue, especially while\nthe industry remains under stress from the\npandemic.\n\nMost ransomware attacks occurred in North\nAmerica, followed by Europe and Asia. In\nfact, North America saw nearly half (45%)\nof ransomware attacks on ICS-connected\nnetworks since 2018, followed by Europe at\n31% and Asia at 18% of total attacks we have\ntracked.\n\nThe largest increase in targeting was observed\n\n\nin the manufacturing sector, with the number\nof incidents in that sector tripling from 2018 to\n2020. Manufacturing was also the hardest hit,\nexperiencing 36% of all ransomware attacks\non ICS-related networks from 2018-2020.\nUtility companies came in second, at 10%\nof attacks—a percentage that has increased\ndramatically since 2018.\n\nOf incidents in which the scope of impact\nis known, 56% of ransomware attacks\naffected operations functionality at victim\norganizations. Sodinokibi, Ryuk and Maze were\nthe most commonly observed ransomware\nstrains compromising industrial organizations\nfrom 2018-2020. Specifically, Sodinokibi\naccounted for 17% of the ransomware attacks\nagainst industrial organizations where the\nransomware strain was known, while Ryuk\nmade up 14% and Maze 13%. Doppelpaymer\nand WannaCry tied for fourth, at 7% of\nransomware attacks against industrial\norganizations.\n\n\nFigure 2: Geographies targeted by ransomware attacks on organizations with or supporting ICS networks, 2018 - 2020\n\n\n[vaccine-maker suffers cyber-attack – BBC (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54642870)](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54642870)\n5 Cyberattacks targeting health care must stop [Microsoft (https://blogs microsoft com/on the issues/2020/11/13/health care](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Geographies targeted by ransomware attacks on\norganizations with or supporting ICS networks, 2018 - 2020\n\n###### RANSOMWARE DATA\n\nDragos and X-Force identified 194 confirmed\nransomware attacks impacting industrial\nentities. The dataset includes managed service\nproviders and telecommunications companies\nas these industries greatly support industrial\nprocesses. Their functionality – including\nmobile and satellite infrastructure and data\nmanagement and processing – can be deeply\nintegrated into OT environments.\n\nA disruption to such integrations due to a\nransomware attack can potentially impact the\noperations environment. Additionally, the data\nincludes ransomware attacks on government\nentities only if they impacted utility operations.\nThe dataset only includes organizations\nwhich experienced confirmed ransomware\nattacks. It does not include organizations\nlisted on ransomware leak sites if attempted\nor successful ransomware deployment and file\nencryption could not be confirmed.\n\n\n###### COMMON ATTACK PATHS\n\nDespite the large number of ransomware\ntypes, ransomware strains share many\ncommonalities in initial access, credential theft,\nlateral movement, and encryption techniques.\nAccording to data collected by Dragos and\nX-Force, the most common initial access vectors\nare phishing, remote services compromise\nsuch as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and\nexploiting software vulnerabilities like virtual\nprivate network (VPN) concentrators and\nenterprise network equipment.\n\nAn April 2020 Microsoft assessment of common\nhuman-operated ransomware families found\ngroups using common tools or built-in services\nfor credential theft and lateral movement\nincluding Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike, PSExec, and\nthe abuse of Windows service accounts and\nmanagement tools.[6]\n\nMany human-operated ransomware strains\nincluding LockerGoga, Maze, and EKANS\nencrypt systems in the same effective manner:\nWindows Active Directory compromise. Active\nDirectory is used for a variety of authentication,\nsecurity, and administrative services within\nWindows environments, and a compromise\ncan enable an attacker to quickly encrypt\ncomputers across the entire organization’s\ndomain.\n\nThe good news for organizations is that it is\npossible to defend against many types of\nransomware by practicing proper security\nhygiene as described in the Recommendations\nsection of this report.\n\nThe surge in attacks and attention paid on\nransomware has prompted companies to be\nmore proactive in their defense against the\nthreat. Such activities – like maintaining offline\n\n\n[6 Ransomware groups continue to target healthcare, critical services; here’s how to reduce risk – Microsoft (https://www.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/)\n[microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/)\n[reduce-risk/)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### CASE STUDY\n\n\n-----\n\n##### RANSOMWARE AND EXTORTION\n\n\nRansomware attackers adopting the hack\nand leak method is concerning for a variety of\nreasons, including:\n\n - Victims are unable to confirm whether data\nis destroyed.\n\n - Data stolen or leaked by attackers could\ncontain sensitive information on the target\ncompany and customers that could aid in\nfuture attack planning.\n\n - Different regulatory and legal issues arise\nfrom data breaches than ransomware.\n\n - Data leaks provide additional incentive for\nvictims to pay a ransom—yet, when paid,\nransoms validate cybercriminals’ business\nmodel and encourages additional attack\nactivity from ransomware cartels.\n\n - Once information is stolen, victims generally\nhave no control over, or visibility into, what\nattackers do with it.\n\n - Releasing sensitive intellectual property\n– for instance manufacturing details\n– could enable counterfeit products\nbeing produced. People can copy the\nmanufacturing process more specifically\ncreating better counterfeits.\n\n\n[spirits-and-wine-giant-hit-by-cyberattack-1tb-of-data-stolen/)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-spirits-and-wine-giant-hit-by-cyberattack-1tb-of-data-stolen/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### STOLEN DATA PERSISTS LONGER THAN RANSOMWARE’S EFFECTS\n\nTraditionally, ransomware attackers will\nprovide decryption keys to victims once a\nransom is paid, which confirms the criminal\nupholds their end of the transaction. The issue\ncan be addressed within the confines of the\nimpacted network, with the victim maintaining\nvisibility into malicious activities. Data theft\nand extortion activities introduce additional\nuncertainty into the calculus, particularly since\nan organization loses complete control over\nsensitive data once it is released publicly. In\naddition, the timeframe for potential damage is\nnot finite as with ransomware, but can extend\nto months or even years. There is no way for\na victim organization to know with certainty\nwhat a data theft has done with the victim’s\nsensitive data, or what the attacker may do\nwith it in the future.\n\n###### ATTACK PLANNING\n\nMultiple ransomware and data leak incidents\nidentified by Dragos and X-Force have included\nattackers leaking data relating to a victim’s\ncustomers, including in the manufacturing,\nutility, defense, and aerospace industries.\nAlthough ransomware attackers may only be\ninterested in leveraging such data for financial\npurposes – i.e. encouraging the company to\npay the ransom – attackers interested in\nspecifically targeting ICS could use the leaked\ndata to aid in attack development. Additionally,\n\n\neven if data is not shared publicly, adversaries\ncould potentially buy data from ransomware\nattackers. Sodinokibi, for instance, created an\nauction site for interested parties to buy stolen\ndata with no limits on what will be done with\nit. [11]\n\nAn attacker focused on infiltrating or\npotentially disrupting ICS could use stolen\nvictim and customer data to identify potential\nopportunities for third-party or supply\nchain compromise. Customers or employees\ncould be likely targets for phishing activity,\nor sensitive financial data that could aid in\nespionage operations. An attacker could also\nuse data like schematics, network diagrams,\nor other internal documentation to identify\ntargets for operational gain and assess the\nlevel of obscurity a target has from internal and\nexternal resources.\n\nFor example, Dragos reviewed select files from\na compromised oil and gas services company\npublished on the Maze ransomware leak\nwebsite and identified multiple items of interest\nin the publicly available data leak. This included\nlists of companies that used the firm’s services,\nemployee information, natural gas flow data,\ninformation related to a Canadian government\nenergy regulator, and geospatial data which\ncould be related to companies’ sites of current\nupstream and midstream operations.\n\nIt is possible to see the value of such data\nwhen mapped to frameworks such as IBM’s\nCyberattack Preparation Framework and\nMITRE’s PRE-ATT&CK tactics. Data leaks\ncan facilitate external reconnaissance—a key\ncomponent of the “Prepare Attack” phase that\naligns with MITRE’s PRE-ATT&CK tactics[12] of\nTarget Selection [TA0014]; Technical, People,\nand Organizational Information Gathering\n\n\n[11 Sodinokibi ransomware gang auctions off stolen data – Malwarebytes (https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/06/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/06/sodinokibi-ransomware-gang-auctions-off-stolen-data/)\n[sodinokibi-ransomware-gang-auctions-off-stolen-data/)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/06/sodinokibi-ransomware-gang-auctions-off-stolen-data/)\n[12 RE-ATT&CK Tactics – MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/pre/)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/pre/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[TA0015, TA0016, TA0017]; or Organizational\nWeakness Identification [TA0020].\n\nFigure 4: Cyberattack preparation framework\nas mapped to MITRE PRE-ATT&CK\n\n###### REGULATORY AND LEGAL ISSUES\n\nGovernment agencies globally encourage\ncompanies to report ransomware and other\ncyberattacks to authorities, but informing\ncustomers, users, or the general public is\nnot required, except in some circumstances.\nFor instance, the North American Electric\nReliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure\nProtection (NERC CIP) regulations require\nelectric organizations supporting the Bulk\nElectric System (BES) to report downtime and\nremediation efforts if it involves the critical\n\n\ninfrastructure network.[13] Public companies will\nalso report ransomware incidents that have\nmaterial business impacts in financial filings\nwith federal agencies but otherwise attacks\nfrequently go unreported.\n\nData breach laws vary globally, and not every\ncountry has them. But such laws generally\nrequire companies to publicly report incidents\nwhen people’s sensitive data is lost or stolen,\nincluding personally identifiable information\nlike email addresses, passwords, and human\nresources records.[14] In Europe, for instance,\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nrules govern data breach notification laws, and\nin North America and Australia, privacy statues\nvary between federal legislation and state or\nterritorial rules.\n\nUltimately, a company impacted by a cyber\ndata breach faces more legal hurdles and will\nface more scrutiny than one impacted by a\nransomware attack alone—potentially causing\nmore financial and reputational damages.\n\n###### RANSOMWARE AND STATE SPONSORED OPERATIONS\n\nMultiple government agencies attributed the\ndisruptive global WannaCry attack in 2017 to\nstate actors known as the Lazarus Group.15\nShortly after, the NotPetya worm encrypted\n(and ultimately wiped) systems around the\nglobe, and multiple government entities\nassociated this event with a state-sponsored\ngroup.\n\nRecently, ransomware events have\ndemonstrated the hallmarks of statesponsored activity, including a series of attacks\n\n\n[13 CIP-008-6 — Cyber Security — Incident Reporting and Response Planning – NERC (https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliabili-](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-008-6.pdf)\n[ty%20Standards/CIP-008-6.pdf)](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-008-6.pdf)\n[14 Data Protection Laws of the World – DLA Piper (https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=world-map&c=US)](https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=world-map&c=US)\n[15 WannaCry ransomware attack ‘linked to North Korea’ – The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/wannacry-ransomware-attack-linked-north-korea-lazarus-group)\n[wannacry-ransomware-attack-linked-north-korea-lazarus-group)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/wannacry-ransomware-attack-linked-north-korea-lazarus-group)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### FUTURE PREDICTIONS\n\nRansomware will continue to be a major\nthreat to industrial operations in the future.\nDespite efforts to improve security hygiene\nacross multiple business sectors, poor security\npractices including improper segmentation\nbetween enterprise and operations networks\nwill enable the infection and propagation of\nransomware across business and ICS systems.\nAdditionally, attacker behavior is adapting to\ncorporate ransomware security efforts and\nexpanding behaviors to include data theft and\nextortion.\n\nRansomware operators will likely continue to\nincorporate data theft and extortion techniques\ninto their ransomware campaigns—potentially\nat increasing rates going forward, particularly if\ncurrent threat actors using this technique find\nthe business model to be successful. Dragos\nand X-Force also anticipate that ransomware\nattacks in the future will be used as a cover for\nstate-sponsored operations.\n\nDragos and X-Force assess with high confidence\nthat the threat of ransomware attacks to\nICS and OT-connected networks is likely to\nincrease, as future attacks build on the new\nefforts of ransomware such as EKANS, capable\nof disrupting industrial processes. This trend\nis also driven by the growing adoption of “big\ngame hunting” efforts as well as data breach\ncomponents forcing companies to publicly\nreport incidents of compromise.\n\n#### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n - Conduct architecture reviews to identify all\nassets, connections, and communications\nbetween IT and OT networks. Identify\n\n\nDemilitarized Zones (DMZs) to restrict\ntraffic between enclaves. Critically examine\nand limit connections between corporate\nand ICS networks to only known, required\ntraffic.\n\n- Engage in effective defense-in-depth\nsecurity strategies. Especially for\nransomware attacks, having effective\npreventative, detective, and corrective\ncontrols in place is critical for reducing\nrisk. Even if malware can evade anti-virus\ndetection, endpoint detection systems and\nother controls can stop the threat before it\nspreads.\n\n- Enforce Multifactor Authentication (MFA)\nwherever possible. Focus critically on\nconnections to integrators, maintenance,\nvendor personnel, and crown jewels such\nas safety equipment. Ensure that critical\nnetwork services, such as Active Directory\n(AD) and the servers hosting it, are welldefended and that administrative access to\nhosting devices is restricted to the greatest\ndegree possible.\n\n- Ensure remote access services such as\nvirtual private network (VPN) and Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) connections use\nindustry standard secure credentials and\ncross to a separate OT domain.\n\n- Ensure employees are trained to detect\nphishing attempts and report to security\npersonnel when observed.\n\n- Ensure backups of enterprise and\noperations network systems are maintained\non a daily basis and test backups during\ndisaster recovery simulations. For greatest\nsecurity, store backups offline, but if this\nis not cost effective, ensure that any main\nnetwork access to backups has only read—\nnot write—access to prevent attackers\nfrom encrypting or destroying backup\nfiles. Testing backup reconstitution plans\nis critical.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Create an ICS-specific ransomware incident\nresponse plan and test this plan under\npressure using a tabletop or cyber range\nexercise. These attacks move quickly, so\ndeveloping your security team’s muscle\nmemory is critical and can make all the\ndifference in preventing millions of\ndollars’ worth of damage. Additionally,\nthese experiences can help address the\npsychological impact of a breach event.\n\n- Establish an alternate location from\nwhich critical business functions can run\ntemporarily should a destructive malware\n\n\nor ransomware attack occur. Organizations\nthat have been able to restore even some\nbusiness operations following a destructive\nor ransomware attack have fared better\nthan their counterparts. This capability\nallows your business to run even as attack\nremediation is ongoing.\n\n- Leverage industrial-specific threat\ndetection mechanisms to identify malware\nwithin OT and reinforce defense in depth\nstrategies at the network level, leading\nto a more robust investigation ability by\ndefenders and analysts.\n\n\n###### TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DRAGOS AND OUR TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES, AND THREAT INTELLIGENCE, PLEASE VISIT  WWW.DRAGOS.COM.\n\n TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IBM X-FORCE’S THREAT INTELLIGENCE AND INCIDENT RESPONSE SERVICES, PLEASE VISIT IBM.COM/ SECURITY/SERVICES/ THREAT-INTELLIGENCE\n\n OR\n\n IBM.COM/SECURITY/SERVICES/ INCIDENT-RESPONSE-SERVICES.\n\n\n# THANK YOU\n\n\n-----",
