See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/matrices/enterprise/)_\n_all referenced threat actor techniques._\n\n**Note: the analysis in this joint cybersecurity advisory is ongoing, and the information**\nprovided should not be considered comprehensive. The Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will update this advisory as new information is\navailable.\n\nThis joint cybersecurity advisory was written by CISA with contributions from the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nCISA has recently observed advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting multiple\nlegacy vulnerabilities in combination with a newer privilege escalation vulnerability—CVE2020-1472—in Windows Netlogon. The commonly used tactic, known as vulnerability\nchaining, exploits multiple vulnerabilities in the course of a single intrusion to compromise a\nnetwork or application.\n\nThis recent malicious activity has often, but not exclusively, been directed at federal and\nstate, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government networks. Although it does not appear\nthese targets are being selected because of their proximity to elections information, there\nmay be some risk to elections information housed on government networks.\n\nCISA is aware of some instances where this activity resulted in unauthorized access to\nelections support systems; however, CISA has no evidence to date that integrity of elections\ndata has been compromised. There are steps that election officials, their supporting SLTT IT\nstaff, and vendors can take to help defend against this malicious cyber activity.\n\nSome common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT actors include\nleveraging legacy network access and virtual private network (VPN) vulnerabilities in\n[association with the recent critical CVE-2020-1472 Netlogon vulnerability. CISA is aware of](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\nmultiple cases where the Fortinet FortiOS Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN vulnerability\n[CVE-2018-13379 has been exploited to gain access to networks. To a lesser extent, CISA](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379)\n[has also observed threat actors exploiting the MobileIron vulnerability CVE-2020-15505.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15505)\nWhile these exploits have been observed recently, this activity is ongoing and still unfolding.\n\n\n-----\n\n[After gaining initial access, the actors exploit CVE-2020-1472 to compromise all Active](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\nDirectory (AD) identity services. Actors have then been observed using legitimate remote\naccess tools, such as VPN and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), to access the environment\nwith the compromised credentials. Observed activity targets multiple sectors and is not\nlimited to SLTT entities.\n\nCISA recommends network staff and administrators review internet-facing infrastructure for\nthese and similar vulnerabilities that have or could be exploited to a similar effect, including\n[Juniper CVE-2020-1631, Pulse Secure CVE-2019-11510, Citrix NetScaler CVE-2019-19781,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1631)\n[and Palo Alto Networks CVE-2020-2021 (this list is not considered exhaustive).](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021)\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-283A-APT_Actors_Chaining_Vulnerabilities.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n Initial Access\n\nAPT threat actors are actively leveraging legacy vulnerabilities in internet-facing\ninfrastructure (Exploit Public-Facing Application [[T1190], External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1190/) [[T1133])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1133/)\nto gain initial access into systems. The APT actors appear to have predominately gained\n[initial access via the Fortinet FortiOS VPN vulnerability CVE-2018-13379.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379)\n\nAlthough not observed in this campaign, other vulnerabilities, listed below, could be used to\ngain network access (as analysis is evolving, these listed vulnerabilities should not be\nconsidered comprehensive). As a best practice, it is critical to patch all known vulnerabilities\nwithin internet-facing infrastructure.\n\n[Citrix NetScaler CVE-2019-19781](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\n[MobileIron CVE-2020-15505](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15505)\n[Pulse Secure CVE-2019-11510](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510)\n[Palo Alto Networks CVE-2020-2021](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021)\nF5 BIG-IP [CVE-2020-5902](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5902)\n\n**Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN CVE-2018-13379**\n\n[CVE-2018-13379 is a path traversal vulnerability in the FortiOS SSL VPN web portal. An](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379)\nunauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to download FortiOS system files\n[through specially crafted HTTP resource requests.[1]](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384)\n\n## MobileIron Core & Connector Vulnerability CVE-2020-15505\n\n[CVE-2020-15505 is a remote code execution vulnerability in MobileIron Core & Connector](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15505)\n[versions 10.3 and earlier.[2] This vulnerability allows an external attacker, with no privileges,](https://www.mobileiron.com/en/blog/mobileiron-security-updates-available)\nto execute code of their choice on the vulnerable system. As mobile device management\n\n\n-----\n\n(MDM) systems are critical to configuration management for external devices, they are\nusually highly permissioned and make a valuable target for threat actors.\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\nPost initial access, the APT actors use multiple techniques to expand access to the\n[environment. The actors are leveraging CVE-2020-1472 in Windows Netlogon to escalate](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472)\nprivileges and obtain access to Windows AD servers. Actors are also leveraging the\nopensource tools such as Mimikatz and the CrackMapExec tool to obtain valid account\ncredentials from AD servers (Valid Accounts [[T1078]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1078/)\n\n**Microsoft Netlogon Remote Protocol Vulnerability: CVE-2020-1472**\n\n[CVE-2020-1472 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\n[NRPC), a core authentication component of Active Directory.[3] This vulnerability could allow](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\nan unauthenticated attacker with network access to a domain controller to completely\ncompromise all AD identity services (Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts [[T1078.002]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1078/002/)\nMalicious actors can leverage this vulnerability to compromise other devices on the network\n(Lateral Movement [[TA0008]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0008/)\n\n## Persistence\n\nOnce system access has been achieved, the APT actors use abuse of legitimate credentials\n[(Valid Accounts [T1078]) to log in via VPN or remote access services (External Remote](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1078/)\n_Services_ [[T1133]) to maintain persistence.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1133/)\n\n## Mitigations\n\nOrganizations with externally facing infrastructure devices that have the vulnerabilities listed\nin this joint cybersecurity advisory, or other vulnerabilities, should move forward with an\n“assume breach” mentality. As initial exploitation and escalation may be the only observable\nexploitation activity, most mitigations will need to focus on more traditional network hygiene\nand user management activities.\n\n## Keep Systems Up to Date\n\nPatch systems and equipment promptly and diligently. Establishing and consistently\nmaintaining a thorough patching cycle continues to be the best defense against adversary\nTTPs.

Existing hosts from the old compromised forest cannot be\nmigrated in without being rebuilt and rejoined to the new domain, but migration may be done\nthrough “creative destruction,” wherein as endpoints in the legacy forest are\ndecommissioned, new ones can be built in the new forest. This will need to be completed on\non-premise as well as Azure-hosted AD instances.\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that fully resetting an AD forest is difficult and complex; it is best done with the\nassistance of personnel who have successfully completed the task previously.\n\nIt is critical to perform a full password reset on all user and computer accounts in the AD\nforest. Use the following steps as a guide.\n\n1. Create a temporary administrator account, and use this account only for all\n\nadministrative actions\n[2. Reset the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket ( krbtgt ) password [4]; this must be](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/ad-forest-recovery-resetting-the-krbtgt-password)\n\ncompleted before any additional actions (a second reset will take place in step 5)\n3. Wait for the krbtgt reset to propagate to all domain controllers (time may vary)\n4. Reset all account passwords (passwords should be 15 characters or more and\n\nrandomly assigned):\n\n1. User accounts (forced reset with no legacy password reuse)\n2. Local accounts on hosts (including local accounts not covered by Local\n\nAdministrator Password Solution [LAPS])\n3. Service accounts\n4. Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) account\n5. Domain Controller machine account\n6. Application passwords\n5. Reset the `krbtgt password again`\n6. Wait for the `krbtgt reset to propagate to all domain controllers (time may vary)`\n7. Reboot domain controllers\n8. Reboot all endpoints\n\nThe following accounts should be reset:\n\nAD Kerberos Authentication Master (2x)\nAll Active Directory Accounts\nAll Active Directory Admin Accounts\nAll Active Directory Service Accounts\nAll Active Directory User Accounts\nDSRM Account on Domain Controllers\nNon-AD Privileged Application Accounts\nNon-AD Unprivileged Application Accounts\nNon-Windows Privileged Accounts\nNon-Windows User Accounts\nWindows Computer Accounts\nWindows Local Admin\n\n## CVE-2020-1472\n\nTo secure your organization’s Netlogon channel connections:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Update all Domain Controllers and Read Only Domain Controllers. On August 11,**\n[2020, Microsoft released software updates to mitigate CVE-2020-1472. Applying this](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\nupdate to domain controllers is currently the only mitigation to this vulnerability (aside\nfrom removing affected domain controllers from the network).\n**Monitor for new events, and address non-compliant devices that are using**\nvulnerable Netlogon secure channel connections.\n**Block public access to potentially vulnerable ports, such as 445 (Server Message**\nBlock [SMB]) and 135 (Remote Procedure Call [RPC]).\n\n[To protect your organization against this CVE, follow advice from Microsoft, including:](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4557222/how-to-manage-the-changes-in-netlogon-secure-channel-connections-assoc)\n\nUpdate your domain controllers with an update released August 11, 2020, or later.\nFind which devices are making vulnerable connections by monitoring event logs.\nAddress non-compliant devices making vulnerable connections.\n[Enable enforcement mode to address CVE-2020-1472 in your environment.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472)\n\n## VPN Vulnerabilities\n\nImplement the following recommendations to secure your organization’s VPNs:\n\n**Update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices being used to remote**\ninto work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.\n[See CISA Tips Understanding Patches and Software Updates and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006) Securing Network\nInfrastructure Devices. Wherever possible, enable automatic updates. See table 1 for\npatch information on VPN-related CVEs mentioned in this report.\n**Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all VPN connections to increase**\n**security. Physical security tokens are the most secure form of MFA, followed by**\nauthenticator app-based MFA. SMS and email-based MFA should only be used when\nno other forms are available. If MFA is not implemented, require teleworkers to use\n[strong passwords. See CISA Tips Choosing and Protecting Passwords and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002)\n[Supplementing Passwords for more information.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012)\n\nDiscontinue unused VPN servers. Reduce your organization’s attack surface by\ndiscontinuing unused VPN servers, which may act as a point of entry for attackers. To protect\nyour organization against VPN vulnerabilities:\n\n**Audit configuration and patch management programs.**\n**Monitor network traffic for unexpected and unapproved protocols, especially outbound**\nto the internet (e.g., Secure Shell [SSH], SMB, RDP).\n**Implement MFA, especially for privileged accounts.**\n**Use separate administrative accounts on separate administration workstations.**\n**Keep** [software up to date. Enable automatic updates, if available.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006)\n\n## How to uncover and mitigate malicious activity\n\n\n-----\n\n**Collect and remove for further analysis:**\n\nRelevant artifacts, logs, and data.\n**Implement mitigation steps that avoid tipping off the adversary that their presence in**\nthe network has been discovered.\n**Consider soliciting incident response support from a third-party IT security**\norganization to:\n\nProvide subject matter expertise and technical support to the incident response.\nEnsure that the actor is eradicated from the network.\nAvoid residual issues that could result in follow-up compromises once the incident\nis closed.\n\n## Resources\n\n[CISA VPN-Related Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/vpn-related-guidance)\nCISA Infographic: Risk Vulnerability And Assessment (RVA) Mapped to the MITRE\nATT&CK FRAMEWORK\n[National Security Agency InfoSheet: Configuring IPsec Virtual Private Networks](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/02/2002355501/-1/-1/0/CONFIGURING_IPSEC_VIRTUAL_PRIVATE_NETWORKS_2020_07_01_FINAL_RELEASE.PDF)\nCISA Joint Advisory: AA20-245A: Technical Approaches to Uncovering and\nRemediating Malicious Activity\nCISA Activity Alert: [AA20-073A: Enterprise VPN Security](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-073a)\nCISA Activity Alert: [AA20-031A: Detecting Citrix CVE-2019-19781](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-031a)\nCISA Activity Alert: AA20-010A: Continued Exploitation of Pulse Secure VPN\nVulnerability\n**[Cybersecurity Alerts and Advisories: Subscriptions to CISA Alerts and](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSUSCERT/subscriber/new)** MS-ISAC\nAdvisories\n\n## Contact Information\n\nRecipients of this report are encouraged to contribute any additional information that they\nmay have related to this threat.\n\nFor any questions related to this report or to report an intrusion and request resources for\nincident response or technical assistance, please contact:\n\n[CISA (888-282-0870 or Central@cisa.dhs.gov), or](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:Central@cisa.dhs.gov)\n[The FBI through the FBI Cyber Division (855-292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov) or a](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov) local\nfield office\n\n**_DISCLAIMER_**\n\n_This information is provided \"as is\" for informational purposes only.
