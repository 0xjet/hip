    "plain_text": "# Using Poison Ivy\n\nWe’ve uncovered some new data and likely attribution regarding a series of APT watering hole attacks this\n\npast summer. Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many\n\npeople are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in\n\nunsolicited emails. Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve\n\ncompromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These\n\nare often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political\n\nsympathies to which the actors want to gain access.\n\nThe attacks discussed in this blog are related to an APT campaign commonly referred to as “th3bug”,\n\nnamed for the password the actors often use with their Poison Ivy malware. Of note, only the older of the\n\nsamples we cover in this blog used that password. We don’t know the reason the actors changed this, but\n\nit could possibly be in reaction to information widely published on the Internet about their activities,\n\n[which use that password as a key component to tie the activity together. FireEye in particular published a](http://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-poison-ivy-report.pdf)\n\npaper describing several APT campaigns whose activity they correlate using Poison Ivy passwords.\n\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims,\n\n“th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent.\n\nOver the summer they compromised several sites, including a well-known Uyghur website written in that\n\nnative language.\n\nWhile we were unable to recover the initial vulnerability used, it is possibly the same CVE 2014-0515\n\n[Adobe Flash exploit first reported by Cisco TRAC in late July. We cannot confirm the initial compromised](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/far-east-targeted-by-drive-by/)\n\nsites, but we noted traffic to several known re-direct sites and the malware was configured to use the same\n\ncommand and control (C2) server.\n\nIn addition, the download dates of many of our files pre-date those noted by Cisco by only a few days. All\n\nof the malware were variants of the Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool (RAT) and were properly\n\nidentified as such by our WildFire platform. The targets of the attack were:\n\nUyghur sympathizers\n\nAn East Asian office for a major US based computer manufacturer\n\nA major US university\n\nAn international wholesale and retail telecom provider\n\nWe saw the first sample on July 14, 2014. This sample had an interesting PDB string – C:\n\n\n-----\n\nexactly matched the PE timestamp of 11 July, 2014.\n\n## Table 1\n\n**SHA256** ba509a1d752f3165dc2821e0b1c6543c15988fd7abd4e56c6155de09d1640ce9\n\n**MD5** 18ad696f3459bf47f97734f2f14506e3\n\n**File Name** diff.exe\n\n**File Size** 97280\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-14 13:55:36\n\n**Download**\nwww.npec.com .tw/flash/diff.exe\n**URL**\n\n**Resolution** 203.69.42.22\n\n**C2 Domain** diff.qohub.info\n\n**Resolution** 115.23.172.151\n\nThe next day we collected several copies of the same malware intended for the same industry.

The file was named “PYvBte.jar” but was actually a\n\nWindows executable. The file has the characteristics listed in Table 3, and appears to be a stand-alone\n\nexecutable version of the Metasploit Meterpreter shell. When this file runs, it downloads a payload from\n\nuyghurweb.net/player/gmuweb.exe and executes it. This file is the same Poison Ivy RAT described in\n\nTable 2.\n\nThe Meterpreter payload masquerades as a copy of the ApacheBench tool made by the Apache Software\n\nFoundation.\n\n|SHA256|ba509a1d752f3165dc2821e0b1c6543c15988fd7abd4e56c6155de09d1640ce9|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|18ad696f3459bf47f97734f2f14506e3|\n|File Name|diff.exe|\n|File Size|97280|\n|First Seen|2014-07-14 13:55:36|\n|Download URL|www.npec.com .tw/flash/diff.exe|\n|Resolution|203.69.42.22|\n|C2 Domain|diff.qohub.info|\n|Resolution|115.23.172.151|\n\n|SHA256|9d149baceaaff2a67161fec9b8978abc22f0a73a1c8ce87edf6e2fb673ac7374|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|1ea41812a0114e5c6ae76330e7b4af69|\n|File Name|diff.exe|\n|File Size|126976|\n|First Seen|2014-07-15 18:22:25|\n|Download URLs|www.aanon.com .tw/flash/diff.exewww.npec.com .tw/flash/diff.exeuyghurweb .net/player/gmuweb.exe|\n|Resolution|203.69.42.22|\n|C2 Domain|diff.qohub.info|\n|Resolution|115.23.172.151|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Table 3\n\n**SHA256** ccfe61a28f35161c19340541dfd839075e31cd3b661f0936a4c667d805a65136\n\n**MD5** 7b0cb4d14d3d8b6ccc7453f7ddb33997\n\n**File Name** PYvBte.jar\n\n**File Size** 73802\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-16 01:42:24\n\n**Download**\nuyghurweb .net/player/PYvBte.jar\n**URL**\n\nOn 21 July, we detected another sample that was noted in the Cisco TRAC blog.

Additionally, the files PE\n\ntimestamp was January 21, the day before we detected the sample.
