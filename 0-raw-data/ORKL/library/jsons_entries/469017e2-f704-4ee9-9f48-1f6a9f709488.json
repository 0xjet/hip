    "plain_text": "# Operation Ghoul: targeted attacks on industrial and engineering organizations\n\n###### By Mohamad Amin Hasbini on August 17, 2016. 8:56 am\n\n\n[RESEARCH](https://securelist.com/all?category=24)\n\n\n[MALWARE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=458) [PHISHING](https://securelist.com/all?tag=723) [SOCIAL ENGINEERING](https://securelist.com/all?tag=29) [SPYWARE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=143)\n\n##### Mohamad Amin Hasbini\n\nSenior Security Researcher\n\n\n[@MaHasbini](http://twitter.com/MaHasbini)\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nKaspersky Lab has observed new waves of attacks that started\n\non the 8th and the 27th of June 2016. These have been highly\n\nactive in the Middle East region and unveiled ongoing targeted\n\nattacks in multiple regions. The attackers try to lure targets\n\nthrough spear phishing emails that include compressed\n\nexecutables. The malware collects all data such as passwords,\n\nkeystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.\n\n#### #OpGhoul targeting industrial,\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F75718%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F&text=%23OpGhoul+targeting+industrial%2C+manufacturing+and+engineering+organizations+in+30%2B+countries) manufacturing and\n\n#### engineering organizations in 30+ countries\n\nWe found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly\n\nindustrial engineering and manufacturing organizations in more\n\n\n-----\n\nidentified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky\n\nSecurity Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and\n\nattack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March\n\n2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the\n\nattackers’ motivations are apparently financial, whether through\n\nthe victims’ banking accounts or through selling their intellectual\n\nproperty to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations\n\nare considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30­300\n\nemployees), the utilization of commercial off­the­shelf malware\n\nmakes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.\n\n#### In total, over 130 organizations have\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F75718%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F&text=In+total%2C+over+130+organizations+have+been+identified+as+victims+of+Operation+Ghoul+%23OpGhoul) been identified as\n\n#### victims of Operation Ghoul #OpGhoul\n\nIn ancient Folklore, the Ghoul is an evil spirit associated with\n\nconsuming human flesh and hunting kids, originally a\n\nMesopotamian demon. Today, the term is sometimes used to\n\ndescribe a greedy or materialistic individual.\n\n## Main infection vector: malicious emails\n\nThe following picture represents emails that are being used to\n\ndeliver malware to the victims, in what looks like a payment\n\ndocument. The e­mails sent by attackers appear to be coming\n\nfrom a bank in the UAE, the Emirates NBD, and include a 7z file\n\nwith malware. In other cases, victims received phishing links. A\n\nquick analysis of the email headers reveals fake sources being\n\nutilised to deliver the emails to victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malicious attachments\n\nIn the case of spear phishing emails with an attachment, the 7z\n\ndoes not contain payment instructions but a malware executable\n\n(EmiratesNBD_ADVICE.exe). We have observed executables\n\nwith the following MD5s:\n\n**Malware MD5 hashes**\n\nfc8da575077ae3db4f9b5991ae67dab1\n\nb8f6e6a0cb1bcf1f100b8d8ee5cccc4c\n\n08c18d38809910667bbed747b2746201\n\n55358155f96b67879938fe1a14a00dd6\n\n**Email file MD5 hashes**\n\n5f684750129e83b9b47dc53c96770e09\n\n460e18f5ae3e3eb38f8cae911d447590\n\nThe spear phishing emails are mostly sent to senior members\n\nand executives of targeted organizations, most likely because the\n\nattackers hope to get access to core intelligence, controlling\n\naccounts and other interesting information from people who have\n\nthe following positions or similar:\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nChief Operations Officer\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nGeneral Manager, Sales and Marketing\n\nDeputy General Manager\n\n\n-----\n\nManager\n\nExport manager\n\nFinance Manager\n\nPurchase manager\n\nHead of Logistics\n\nSales Executive\n\nSupervisor\n\nEngineer\n\n## Technical details\n\n### Malware functionality\n\nThe malware is based on the Hawkeye commercial spyware,\n\nwhich provides a variety of tools for the attackers, in addition to\n\nmalware anonymity from attribution. It initiates by self­deploying\n\nand configuring persistence, while using anti­debugging and\n\ntimeout techniques, then starts collecting interesting data from the\n\nvictim’s device, including:\n\nKeystrokes\n\nClipboard data\n\nFileZilla ftp server credentials\n\nAccount data from local browsers\n\nAccount data from local messaging clients (Paltalk, Google\n\ntalk, AIM…)\n\nAccount data from local email clients (Outlook, Windows Live\n\nmail…)\n\nLicense information of some installed applications\n\n#### #OpGhoul malware collects all data such\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F75718%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F&text=%23OpGhoul+malware+collects+all+data+such+as+%23passwords%2C+keystrokes+and+screenshots) as #passwords,\n\n#### keystrokes and screenshots\n\n**Data exfiltration**\n\nData is collected by the attackers using primarily:\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail messages\n\nmail.ozlercelikkapi[.]com (37.230.110.53), mail to\n\ninfo@ozlercelikkapi[.]com\n\nmail.eminenture[.]com (192.185.140.232), mail to\n\neminfo@eminenture[.]com\n\nBoth ozlercelikkapi[.]com and eminenture[.]com seem to belong\n\nto compromised organisations operating in manufacturing and\n\ntechnology services.\n\n### Malware command center\n\nThe malware connects to 192.169.82.86 to deliver collected\n\ninformation from the victim’s PC. This information includes\n\npasswords, clipboard data, screenshots…\n\nhxxp://192.169.82.86/~loftyco/skool/login.php\n\nhxxp://192.169.82.86/~loftyco/okilo/login.php\n\nThe IP address 192.169.82.86 seems to belong to a\n\ncompromised device running multiple malware campaigns.\n\n## Victim information\n\nVictim organizations are distributed in different countries\n\nworldwide with attackers focused on certain countries more than\n\nothers:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Number of Victim Organisations by Country_**\n\nCountries marked as “others” have less than three victim\n\norganizations each, they are: Switzerland, Gibraltar, USA,\n\nSweden, China, France, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Turkey, Romania, Iran,\n\nIraq and Italy.\n\n### Victim industry information\n\nVictim industry types were also indicators of targeted attacks as\n\nattackers were looking to infiltrate organizations that belong to the\n\nproduct life cycle of multiple goods, especially industrial\n\nequipment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Number of Victim Organizations by Industry Type_**\n\n**Victim industry description**\n\nPetrochemical, naval, military,\n\n\n**Industrial**\n\n**Engineering**\n\n\naerospace, heavy machinery,\n\nsolar energy, steel, pumps,\n\nplastics\n\nConstruction, architecture,\n\nautomation, chemical,\n\ntransport, water\n\n\n**Shipping** International freight shipping\n\nProduction/research of\n\n\n**Pharmaceutical**\n\n\npharmaceutical and beauty\n\nproducts\n\n\n**Manufacturing** Furniture, decor, textiles\n\nIndustrial, electronics and food\n**Trading**\n\ntrading\n\n\nTraining centers, universities,\n**Education**\n\nacademic publishing\n\n**Tourism** Travel agencies\n\nProviders of IT technologies\n**Technology/IT**\n\nand consulting services\n\n**Unknown** Unidentified victims\n\n### The last attack waves\n\nKaspersky Lab user statistics indicate the new waves of attacks\n\nthat started in June 2016 are focused on certain countries more\n\n\n-----\n\nHundreds of detections have been reported by Kaspersky Lab\n\nusers; 70% of the attacked users were found in the United Arab\n\nEmirates alone, the other 30% were distributed in Russia,\n\nMalaysia, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Algeria, Germany, Iran,\n\nEgypt, Japan, Switzerland, Bahrain and Tunisia.\n\n## Other attack information\n\nPhishing pages have also been spotted through 192.169.82.86,\n\nand although they are taken down quickly, more than 150 user\n\naccounts were identified as victims of the phishing links sent by\n\nthe attackers. Victims were connecting from the following devices\n\nand inserting their credentials, a reminder that phishing attacks\n\ndo work on all platforms:\n\nWindows\n\nMac OS X\n\nUbuntu\n\niPhone\n\nAndroid\n\n\n-----\n\n**signatures:**\n\nTrojan.MSIL.ShopBot.ww\n\nTrojan.Win32.Fsysna.dfah\n\nTrojan.Win32.Generic\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOperation Ghoul is one of the many attacks in the wild targeting\n\nindustrial, manufacturing and engineering organizations,\n\nKaspersky Lab recommends users to be extra cautious while\n\nchecking and opening emails and attachments. In addition,\n\nprivileged users need to be well trained and ready to deal with\n\ncyber threats; failure in this is, in most cases, the cause behind\n\nprivate or corporate data leakage, reputation and financial loss.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe following are common among the different malware\n\ninfections; the presence of these is an indication of a possible\n\ninfection.\n\n### Filenames and paths related to malware\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\bthse\n\nrv.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\BsBh\n\nvScan.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Client\\WinHttpAutoProxy\n\nSync.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Client\\WdiServiceHost.ex\n\ne\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AF7B1841C6A70C\n\n858E3201422E2D0BEA.dat\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\Browser.txt\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\Mail.txt\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\Mess.txt\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\OS.txt\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Mails.txt\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Browsers.txt\n\n### List of malware related MD5 hashes\n\n\n-----\n\nf9ef50c53a10db09fc78c123a95e8eec\n\nb8f6e6a0cb1bcf1f100b8d8ee5cccc4c\n\n07b105f15010b8c99d7d727ff3a9e70f\n\nae2a78473d4544ed2acd46af2e09633d\n\n21ea64157c84ef6b0451513d0d11d02e\n\n08c18d38809910667bbed747b2746201\n\nfc8da575077ae3db4f9b5991ae67dab1\n\n8d46ee2d141176e9543dea9bf1c079c8\n\n36a9ae8c6d32599f21c9d1725485f1a3\n\ncc6926cde42c6e29e96474f740d12a78\n\n6e959ccb692668e70780ff92757d2335\n\n3664d7150ac98571e7b5652fd7e44085\n\nd87d26309ef01b162882ee5069dc0bde\n\n5a97d62dc84ede64846ea4f3ad4d2f93\n\n5a68f149c193715d13a361732f5adaa1\n\ndabc47df7ae7d921f18faf685c367889\n\naaee8ba81bee3deb1c95bd3aaa6b13d7\n\n460e18f5ae3e3eb38f8cae911d447590\n\nc3cf7b29426b9749ece1465a4ab4259e\n\n### List of malware related domains\n\nIndyproject[.]org\n\nStudiousb[.]com\n\ncopylines[.]biz\n\nGlazeautocaree[.]com\n\nBrokelimiteds[.]in\n\nmeedlifespeed[.]com\n\n468213579[.]com\n\n468213579[.]com\n\n357912468[.]com\n\naboranian[.]com\n\napple­recovery[.]us\n\nsecurity­block[.]com\n\ncom­wn[.]in\n\nf444c4f547116bfd052461b0b3ab1bc2b445a[.]com\n\ndeluxepharmacy[.]net\n\nkatynew[.]pw\n\nMercadojs[.]com\n\n### Observed phishing URLs\n\nhxxp://free.meedlifespeed[.]com/ComCast/\n\nhxxp://emailreferentie.appleid.apple.nl.468213579[.]com/\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://verificatie.appleid.apple.nl.referentie.357912468[.]com/em\n\nailverificatie­40985443/home/lo…\n\nhxxp://192.169.82.86/~gurgenle/verify/webmail/\n\nhxxp://customer.comcast.com.aboranian[.]com/login\n\nhxxp://apple­recovery[.]us/\n\nhxxp://apple.security­block[.]com/Apple%20­\n\n%20My%20Apple%20ID.html\n\nhxxp://cgi.ebay.com­wn[.]in/itm/2000­Jeep­Wrangler­Sport­4×4­/?\n\nViewItem&item=17475607809\n\nhxxp://https.portal.apple.com.idmswebauth.login.html.appidkey.05\n\nc7e09b5896b0334b3af1139274f266b2hxxp://2b68.f444c4f547116\n\nbfd052461b0b3ab1bc2b445a[.]com/login.html\n\nhxxp://www.deluxepharmacy[.]net\n\n### Other malware links\n\nMalware links observed on 192.169.82.86 dating back to March\n\nand April 2016:\n\nhxxp://glazeautocaree[.]com/proforma­invoice.exe\n\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/cdn/images/bro.exe\n\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/cdn/images/onowu.exe\n\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/cdn/images/obe.exe\n\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/wp­admin/css/upload/order.exe\n\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/wp­admin/css/upload/orders.exe\n\nhxxp://papercuts[.]info/SocialMedia/java.exe\n\nhxxp://studiousb[.]com/mercadolivrestudio/f.zip\n\nhxxp://copylines[.]biz/lasagna/gate.php?request=true\n\nFor more information on how you can protect your business from\n\n[similar attacks, please visit this post from Kaspersky Business.](https://business.kaspersky.com/ghoul/5897/)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n\n###### FACEBOOK MALWARE – THE MISSING PIECE\n\n\n-----",
