Scope**\n\nAs directed in Joint Publication (JP) 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United\n_States, the DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (DOD Dictionary) sets forth_\nstandard US military and associated terminology to encompass the joint activity of the\nArmed Forces of the United States. These military and associated terms, together with\ntheir definitions, constitute approved Department of Defense (DOD) terminology for\ngeneral use by all DOD components.\n\n**2. Purpose**\n\nThis publication supplements standard English-language dictionaries and standardizes\nmilitary and associated terminology to improve communication and mutual understanding\nwithin DOD with other US Government departments and agencies and among the United\nStates and its allies.\n\n**3. Application**\n\nThis publication applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Services, the\nJoint Staff (JS), combatant commands, DOD agencies, and all other DOD components. It\nis the primary terminology source when preparing correspondence, to include policy,\nstrategy, doctrine, and planning documents. Criteria for inclusion of terminology in the\nDOD Dictionary is enumerated in Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5025.12,\n_Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, and_ Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\nof Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5705.01, _Standardization of Military and Associated_\n_Terminology._\n\n**4.  Format**\n\nThe primary parts of the DOD Dictionary are:\n\na. Explanatory notes.\n\nb. Terms and definitions.\n\nc. Shortened word forms (abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms).\n\nd. Summary of changes.\n\n**5. DOD Dictionary Online Availability and Update Schedule**\n\nThe DOD Dictionary is accessible online as a searchable database and in PDF format\nat the following Internet address: http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology/ and at\nthe following Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) address:\nhttps://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/. The contents of the DOD Dictionary are updated as necessary,\n\n\n-----\n\nto include terminology additions, modifications, or deletions made, in accordance with\nCJCSI 5705.01.\n\n**6. Terminology Repository for DOD (Office of the Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff)**\n**Issuances**\n\nThis publication is supplemented by the Terminology Repository for DOD (Office of the\nSecretary of Defense [OSD]/JS) Issuances (Terminology Repository) (For Official Use Only).\nOver the last 65 years, specific and technical DOD terms and definitions established in senior\npolicy document glossaries reside outside of the DOD Dictionary and not subject to joint\ndoctrine terminology criteria for general and universal usage listed in CJCSI 5705.01. The\n25,000+ policy term Terminology Repository provides awareness on those specific or\ndescriptive terms in defense documents (policy, strategy, planning, doctrine, etc.) that support\nthe foundation of the 2,500+ doctrine term DOD Dictionary. Its creation is the primary step in\ndeconflicting terminology nuances within organizational documents that may impact joint\ndoctrine.\n\n**7. Department of Defense Term and Definition Approach**\n\nAfter consulting DODI 5025.12 and CJCSI 5705.01 for term and definition criteria,\nproponents of new or existing terms will first review the DOD Dictionary and then access\nthe Terminology Repository before defaulting to commonly used, English-language\ndictionaries in creating new DOD terms and definitions. The repository is combined access\ncard-enabled and located at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology-Program/.\n\n**8. Revision and Distribution**\n\nFuture editions of the DOD Dictionary will be updated according to policy and posted\nonline at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology-Program/. For distribution, Joint\nStaff, J-7, does not print copies of the DOD Dictionary. Electronic versions are available on\nJEL+ [Joint Electronic Library Plus] at https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp?pindex=4\n(NIPRNET) and https://jdeis.js.smil.mil/jdeis/index.jsp (SIPRNET) and on the JEL [Joint\nElectronic Library] at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine.aspx (Internet).\n\n**9. Citation**\n\nPer JP 1, and for reference purposes in official DOD materials, this document will be\nlisted as: Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “DOD Dictionary of Military\nand Associated Terms,” as amended. For all other documentation, this will be cited as:\nOffice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, _DOD Dictionary of Military and_\n_Associated Terms, (Washington DC: The Joint Staff, date), page # if necessary._\n\n\n-----\n\n### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTES ..................................................................................................1\n\nTERMS AND DEFINITIONS. ............................................................................................7\n\nSHORTENED WORD FORMS (ABBREVIATIONS, ACRONYMS, AND\nINITIALISMS) ................................................................................................................261\n\nSUMMARY OF CHANGES ...........................................................................................391\n\n\n-----\n\nIntentionally Blank\n\n\n-----\n\n### EXPLANATORY NOTES\n\n**1. Updates and Terminology Actions**\n\na. Per guidance in CJCSI 5705.01, **terminology actions for the DOD Dictionary**\n**(additions; modifications; revalidations, to include those parts of a JP or**\n**issuance/directive policy revision process; or** **deletions) are approved using one of the**\nfollowing five methods:\n\n(1) DOD terminology proposed from JPs;\n\n(2) DOD terminology directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) via specific memorandum;\n\n(3) DOD terminology proposed from DOD (Office of the Secretary of Defense\n\n[OSD] and CJCS) issuances;\n\n(4) Terminology proposed from Allied Administrative Publication-6, _North_\n_Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Glossary of Terms and Definitions (English and_\nFrench); and/or\n\n(5) Approved administrative changes/updates by the DOD Terminologist.\n\nb. Per guidance in CJCSI 5705.01, any DOD Dictionary term and definition, where the\nidentified proponent is an OSD/JS issuance that remains in the document as part of an\norganizational change or other revision process must be revalidated or modified as a part of\nthe revision process. Proponents of terms and definitions that do not follow this process will\nresult in automatic removal from the DOD Dictionary and movement to the Terminology\nRepository of DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances. Any terms identified for removal from OSD/JS\nissuances will subsequently be removed from the DOD Dictionary and automatically placed\nin the Terminology Repository of DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances.\n\n**2. Terminology Categorization (Policy and Joint Doctrine)**\n\na. Military Terminology. Standardized military and associated terminology forms the\nfoundation of joint doctrine. It enables the joint force to organize, plan, train, and execute\noperations with a common language that is clearly articulated and universally understood.\nSince 1948, military terms have been codified in the DOD Dictionary. Although different in\npurpose, policy documents also require standardized terminology. While some policy terms\nare included in the DOD Dictionary, the bulk are codified in the Terminology Repository of\nDOD (OSD/JS) Issuances. Policy terms may form the basis of doctrinal terms, further\ndescribe doctrinal concepts, or temporarily fill gaps in joint doctrine until adopted as extant\npractice. If included in the DOD Dictionary, policy terms will conform to the CJCSI 5705.01\nand standing operating procedure guidelines.\n\nb. Policy and Joint Doctrine. Policy directs and assigns tasks, prescribes desired\ncapabilities, and provides guidance for ensuring the Armed Forces of the United States are\nprepared to perform their assigned roles. Implicitly, policy can create new roles and\n\n\n-----\n\nrequirements for new capabilities. Joint doctrine enhances the operational effectiveness of\nthe Armed Forces by providing authoritative guidance and standardized terminology on topics\nrelevant to the employment of military forces. Although joint doctrine is neither policy nor\nstrategy, it serves to make United States policy and strategy effective in the application of US\nmilitary power. Terminology developed within policy and joint doctrine serves different\npurposes. The terminology required to support the employment of forces (doctrinal terms)\nmay not be optimal for policy developers, whose purpose may be to illuminate resource or\nrequirement documents. Terminology developed for DOD policy is not limited by the\nconstraints imposed on doctrine terminology. Policy definitions may provide the basis for the\ndoctrinal terms. Doctrinal terms cannot be in conflict with the law, regulation, or policy.\n\n**3. Terminology Definition Development**\n\nThe DOD Dictionary is designed to supplement common English-language dictionaries\nwith standard terminology for military and associated use. After reviewing policy for criteria\nand the DOD Dictionary for existence, developers must consult the Terminology Repository\nbefore defaulting to commonly used, English-language dictionaries as a starting point in\ncreating new DOD Dictionary terms and definitions. A definition should address the meaning\nof the term only and should not contain doctrinal or procedural information (i.e., it should\n**focus on describing “what” a term is and not “how” or “why” it is used). If additional text**\nis desired to elaborate on a definition, that information should be provided in the text of the\npublication. Accordingly, the following CJCSI 5705.01 and standing operating procedure\ncriteria are used to determine the acceptability of terminology for inclusion in the DOD\nDictionary:\n\na. The term in a standard, commonly accepted dictionary is inadequate for DOD use.\n\nb. The term is not a standard dictionary definition with non-definitional text added.\nExample: capability - The ability to complete a task or execute a course of action under\nspecified conditions and level of performance.\n\nc. The term is not self-defining. Example: bomber aircraft – An aircraft that is capable\nof delivery bombs.\n\nd. The term is not a policy term that competes or overrides a doctrinal term in the\nDOD Dictionary.\n\ne. The proposed term follows established procedures in this issuance. Verification\nmust be provided that the DOD Terminologist approved; otherwise, the term will only be\nreflected in the Terminology Repository.\n\nf. Reflects extant DOD capabilities and practices.\n\ng. Of general military or associated significance. Technical or highly specialized\nterms may be included if they can be defined in easily understood language and if their\ninclusion is of general military or associated significance.\n\nh. Terms for weaponry are limited to generic weapon systems.\n\n\n-----\n\ni. Are not to consist of or contain shortened word forms (e.g., abbreviations,\nacronyms, or initialisms).\n\nj. Must be UNCLASSIFIED (including shortened word forms) and marked as such if\nin controlled (e.g., FOUO) or classified documents.\n\nk. Are not prowords, code words, brevity words, or NATO [North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization]-only terms.\n\nl. Are not Service-specific or functionality-specific unless they are commonly\nemployed in US joint force operations.\n\nm. An approved joint term with similar definition does not exist.\n\nn. Must be consistent with US law, treaties, international agreements, and executive\norders.\n\no. Noun terms should be in singular form.\n\np. With few exceptions, should be general terms, not proper names.\n\nq. Cross reference entries (i.e., ‘also called’ terms) will not have a separate entry.\nExample: ‘Universal Time’ is also called ‘ZULU time,’ but no separate entry for ‘ZULU\ntime’.\n\nr. Terms must appear and be used in the body of the document, not just in its glossary.\n\ns. Proposed entries should be written as a definition and not as a description.\n\n_See CJCSI 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, Enclosure_\n_C,_ Definition Writing Guide, for specific guidance that should be followed when\n_developing terms and definitions intended for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary._\n\n**4. Shortened Word Forms (Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms)**\n\nThe DOD Dictionary includes shortened word forms (abbreviations, acronyms, and\ninitialisms) for DOD and associated military terms. Shortened word forms in the DOD\nDictionary are solely derived from currently approved JP glossaries and not centrally\nmanaged by the program for the joint force. Although all are shortened versions of a word\nor phrase, typically by a series of letters, there is a difference.\n\na. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase pronounced as a word (e.g.,\nSecDef).\n\nb. An acronym is a shortened form of a phrase of words, where the letters of the\nacronym stand for the terms of its meaning and is also read as a word (e.g., ASAP [as soon\nas possible]).\n\n\n-----\n\nc. An initialism is a shortened form of a word or phrase that is not spoken as a word;\neach letter is spoken separately (e.g., DOD).\n\nd. Parenthesis Use After Definitions\n\n(1) The term associated with an abbreviation, acronym, or initialism is referred\nto as the definition (e.g., the initialism definition for FOUO is ‘for official use only’). In\nsome cases, there may be another abbreviation, acronym, or initialism in parenthesis\nfollowing the definition. If the term is associated with a specific organization, the\ndefinition will include this tag in parenthesis showing it is an organizational-specific term.\nFor example: ACE -- aviation combat element (USMC) or AFNORTHWEST -- Allied\nForces North West Europe (NATO).\n\n(2) There should only be a DOD Dictionary-approved abbreviation, acronym, or\ninitialism in the parenthesis.\n\ne. Other Criteria for Shortened Word Forms\n\nThe list below is not an exhaustive list of criteria for shortened word forms but is\nprovided as general guidance for organizations in their creation and management.\nShortened word forms reflect those used in individual joint doctrine publications.\nAdditional detail on shortened word form construction and guidance may be found in\norganizational standard operating procedures. Avoid overuse of shortened word forms.\n\n(1) Must be unclassified and marked as such if in controlled or classified\ndocuments. This means a glossary has to be marked unclassified to have the terms and\ndefinitions considered for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary or Terminology Repository.\n\n(2) Must be more than one letter.\n\n(3) Should avoid duplicating existing shortened word forms and must only have\none meaning within a single document.\n\n(4) Should generally use capital letters.\n\n(5) Should only be created when needed and commonly used. All terms do not\nneed a shortened word form.\n\n(6) Establish in a document only when the term is used more than once within\nthe body.\n\n(7) Should **not** be used to create other shortened word forms (e.g., “Director,\nNRO” does not establish “DNRO,” regardless if “NRO” was established earlier in the text).\n\n(8) Should **not** be established as part of another shortened word form for use later\nin the text (e.g., if “C-2X” is being established using “counterintelligence and human\nintelligence staff element,” the definition cannot be written as “counterintelligence [CI]\n\n\n-----\n\nand human intelligence [HUMINT] staff element” to establish CI and HUMINT for later\nuse).\n\n**5. Terminology Repository for Department of Defense (Office of the Secretary of**\n**Defense/Joint Staff) Issuances**\n\nThe Terminology Repository was established to provide awareness on specific and\ntechnical policy terms and definitions that reside outside the DOD Dictionary (universal and\ngeneral terms). The Terminology Repository supports the foundation that the DOD Dictionary\nis the primary terminology source. When accessing joint publications or policy, strategy, and\nplanning documents, users should review both the DOD Dictionary and the Terminology\nRepository to develop a full understanding of how a term may be described, defined, or used\nto proceed accordingly. It is also recommended that all glossary developers also use the criteria\nenumerated in paragraph 2 in maintaining terms and definitions. Like the DOD Dictionary,\nthe Terminology Repository is unclassified and uncontrolled. Unlike the DOD Dictionary, the\nTerminology Repository is not meant to capture or track shortened word forms such as\nabbreviations, acronyms, or initialisms. The Terminology Repository can be found on the\nTerminology Program webpage at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/DOD-Terminology-Program/.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntentionally Blank\n\n\n-----\n\n### TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\n A\n\n**acceptability — The plan review criterion for assessing whether the contemplated course**\nof action is proportional, worth the cost, consistent with the law of war, and is\nmilitarily and politically supportable.
