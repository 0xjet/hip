Gemini has translated and analyzed\nthis investigation, although we have not confirmed the entirety of the evidence.\n\nThe anonymous author alleges that Bogdan Koliesniev and Alexander Dyriavin, both\nUkrainian citizens, are responsible for Hydra’s operations. Gemini has confirmed only\nsome of the author’s findings.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis anonymous post began with the author purporting to have attempted to blackmail\nthese individuals for monetary gain. According to the author, these individuals did not\npay, so the author decided to reveal their identities. Telegra.ph forum user “monarkhov,”\nwho claims to be Bogdan Koliesniev, denied his connection to Hydra.\n\nBased on an analysis of the anonymous author’s investigation, Gemini Advisory\nassesses with moderate confidence that Bogdan Koliesniev is likely one of the\nperpetrators behind the Hydra dark market due to significant evidence pointing to this\nindividual related to shared infrastructure and linked contact information. However,\nGemini assesses with low confidence that Alexander Dyriavin may be involved with\nHydra, although likely at a lower level with indirect contributions to their operations.\n\n## Background\n\nGemini analysts have found a post by an anonymous author on the hydra[.]expert domain\nclaiming to have uncovered the true identities of the individuals running Hydra, one of the\nlargest Russian-language dark web marketplaces for drugs. While formerly part of Hydra’s\ninfrastructure, hydra[.]expert now appears to be solely dedicated to identifying Hydra’s\noperators. Gemini has translated and analyzed the investigation pointing to the identities of\nHydra’s alleged operators, although we have not confirmed the entirety of the evidence. The\npost circulated among multiple dark web channels, including an anonymous image forum\n[and a Telegram channel. It has also reached Russian-language media](https://daily.afisha.ru/news/47522-v-set-slili-dannye-predpolagaemyh-razrabotchikov-gidry-ploschadki-po-prodazhe-narkotikov-v-darknete/)\n\n**Hydra**\n\nHydra was founded in 2015, and gradually conquered the market for illegal goods. The\nplatform has become one of the largest in the world and is the single largest platform for the\nsale of drugs in the Former Soviet Union (FSU). It serves as an intermediary between sellers\nand buyers; while it mainly focuses on the sale of drugs, it also has a section on counterfeit\nbank notes, hacking services, counterfeit documents, and other prohibited items. As of this\nwriting, there are 2.5 million accounts registered on the platform and the number of accounts\ngrows every month.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1: The main page of the Hydra dark web marketplace. The top advertisement offers\nthe synthetic stimulant drug Mephedrone and the bottom offers counterfeit documents.\n\n## In-Depth Analysis\n\n**[OperationsBlockchain analysis company Chainalysis examined the Bitcoin wallets](https://demo.chainalysis.com/request-a-demo/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand-Exact&utm_term=chainalysis&utm_content=432217494685&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4L2BBhCvARIsAO0SBdaB6EgSbEtrKt8QcJKSdmxjY12s2P8NSf6ocqORCHOqsyYCbqojAp8aAlf7EALw_wcB)**\nassociated with this market and estimated that over the lifetime of the shop, there were at\nleast $3.4 billion worth of transactions. The Hydra market has also had $1,260,875 in\ntransactions with three crypto currency exchanges. While only about $430,000 in direct\nexposure could be confirmed with one large international exchange, its indirect sending\nexposure was much larger – $1,875,000 USD. Such activities could indicate that the\nmarket’s operators were using legitimate exchanges to launder some of the illicit profits.\n\nImage 2: Total transaction amounts over Hydra’s lifespan, according to Chainalysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: The Hydra market was linked to three cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n**The Investigation**\n\nAccording to the post on hydra[.]expert, Bogdan Koliesniev (Kolesnev) and Alexander\nDyriavin (Daryavin), both citizens of Ukraine, are responsible for Hydra’s operations. The\npost’s author claims to have conducted an analysis after a distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attack hit Hydra, and purportedly uncovered JavaScript code installed on the\nmarketplace. The author’s investigation included the following key points, only some of which\nGemini has confirmed:\n\nThe JavaScript code was connected to the domain name z[.]team.\nAnalysis of z[.]team subdomain qp[.]z[.]team revealed a .json file. The analysis of this\nfile revealed that it was created by “Askold Monarkhov,” and also included the email\naddress. Analysis of the subdomain git[.]z[.]team revealed another name, Alexander\nDyriavin.\nA search for the above email address led to the GitHub page of “ASKOLDEX,” which\nalso displays the name of Bogdan Kolesnev as an event bug fixer.\nA search for ASKOLDEX reveals a YouTube page that has video tutorials on creating\nTelegram bots and the management of QIWI panels, as well as other videos.\nAdditional searches revealed a VK social media page for Askold Monarkhov.\nA Whois record search for the above email indicated that it was used to register the\ndomain name monarkhov[.]pro with the registration name is Bogdan Koliesniev.\nAdditional personally identifiable information (PII) was obtained on Bogdan Kolesnev,\nsuch as his passport number and telephone number.\n\n\n-----\n\nA search for Alexander Dyriavin revealed a profile for an individual with the same name\non GitHub. Their Github profile page also indicated that Dyriavin worked with\nASKOLDEX.\nAdditional searches revealed Alexander Dyriavin’s email address, social media\naccounts, and other PII.\nThe post noted additional links between uncovered IP addresses and various domains,\nand various directory name overlaps.\n\nImage 4: Part of the anonymous post’s investigation on hydra[.]expert included images of the\nalleged operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Blackmail**\n\nIt is worth pointing out that this anonymous post began with the author claiming to have\nattempted to blackmail these individuals for monetary gain. According to the author, these\nindividuals did not pay, so the author decided to reveal their identities. It is also worth noting\nthat according to [WaybackMachine, in 2018 hydra[.]expert used to be a mirror domain of the](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201413/http://hydra.expert/)\nHydra market on the surface web, however, it remains unclear if this was the official mirror of\nthe actual Hydra market, which was primarily hosted in the dark web. Furthermore, according\nto Whois records, the domain hydra[.]expert was recently purchased, which could indicate\nthat it was purchased for the sole purpose of posting this research.\n\n**It Wasn’t Me**\n\nOn the same day as this post, on Telegra.ph, which is a Russian-language forum for\nanonymous posts, user “monarkhov” created a post claiming to be Bogdan Koliesniev\n(hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Kak-ya-stal-razrabotchikom-Gidry-bez-registracii-i-sms-02-19). The user\nmonarkhov indicated that the investigation’s findings were incorrect and that they have\nnothing to do with Hydra. User monarkhov claimed that they create the framework for making\nTelegram bots and create admin panels to control Qiwi wallets. Additionally, monarkhov\nclaimed that many of their source codes are available on Github and that anyone could have\nused them. This purportedly explains why Hydra used infrastructure linked to Koliesniev,\nalthough it does not explain why Hydra specifically chose Koliesniev’s code.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on an analysis of the anonymous author’s investigation, Gemini Advisory assesses\nwith moderate confidence that Bogdan Koliesniev is likely one of the perpetrators behind the\nHydra dark market due to significant evidence pointing to this individual related to shared\ninfrastructure and linked contact information. However, Gemini assesses with low confidence\nthat Alexander Dyriavin may be involved with Hydra, although likely at a lower level with\nindirect contributions to their operations.\n\n**Gemini Advisory Mission Statement**\n\n_Gemini Advisory provides actionable fraud intelligence to the largest financial organizations_\n_in an effort to mitigate ever-growing cyber risks.
