We discovered the malicious apps victimizing Android users in India, and believe a\nhacking group—one previously known for victimizing government officials—carried out the\nattacks. We identified these malicious apps as PoriewSpy (detected by Trend Micro as\nANDROIDOS_PORIEWSPY.HRX). We also suspect that the group used malicious apps built\nusing DroidJack or SandroRAT (detected as ANDROIDOS_SANRAT.A), based on similarities in\n[their command-and-control (C&C) server. DroidJack is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allows](https://blog.trendmicro.com/malware-gotta-catch-em-all/)\nintruders to take full control of a user’s Android device when installed.\n\n[The operators behind these malicious apps might be related to a suspected cyberespionage group](http://www.securityweek.com/pakistan-apt-group-targets-indian-government)\ndiscovered in 2016, but it’s possible that the group may be launching different attacks unrelated to\ntheir previous campaign.\n\n**_PoriewSpy turns device into an audio recorder, steals other device info_**\n\nExisting as far back as 2014, PoriewSpy steals sensitive information from victims’ devices such as\nSMS, call logs, contacts, location, and SD card file list. It can also record victims’ voice calls. The\nmalware was developed from an open-source project called android-swipe-image-viewer, or\n[Android Image Viewer, which the malware operator/s modified to add the following components:](https://github.com/chiuki/android-swipe-image-viewer)\n\n**Permissions**\nandroid.permission.INTERNET Allows applications to open network sockets\nandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO Allows applications to record audio\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE Allows applications to access information about networks\nandroid.permission.READ_SMS Allows applications to read SMS messages\nandroid.permission.READ_LOGS Allows applications to read the low-level system log files\nandroid.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS Allows access to the list of accounts in the Accounts Service\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS Allows applications to read the user’s contacts data\nandroid.permission.READ_CALL_LOG Allows applications to read the user’s call log.\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE Allows read only access to phone state\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORA Allows applications to write to external storage.\nGE\n\n\nandroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAG\nE\n\n\nAllows applications to read from external storage.\n\n\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETEAllows applications to receive the\nD ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the\n\nsystem finishes booting\nandroid.permission.BATTERY_STATS Allows applications to collect battery statistics\naandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION Allows applications to access fine(e.g., GPS) location\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi\nnetworks\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATIO Allows applications to access coarse (e.g., Cell-ID, WiFi)\nN location\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION Allows applications to create mock location providers for\n\ntesting\nandroid permission CHANGE NETWORK STATE Allows applications to change network connectivity state\n\n\n-----\n\n**Services**\nAudioRecord Main espionage component\nLogService For log collection\nRecordService Audio record\n**Receivers**\nOnBootReceiver Auto start after device reboot\nBatteryReciever For device power connect action\nCallBroadcastReceiver Handle Call actions\nNetworkChangeReceiver Handle device network actions\nCameraEventReciver Handle Camera related actions\n\n\n_Figure 2._\n_Services and_\n\n_receivers_\n_added by the_\n\n_malware_\n_author/s to_\n_the modified_\n\n_Android_\n\n_Image_\n_Viewer_\n\n\nPoriewSpy apps were automatically downloaded from malicious websites visited by users. When\nthe malicious app is launched, it will initially show nude photos of an Indian actress, but will later\nhide its icon to obscure itself from users’ sight. When the user calls using an infected device, the\nmalware will start recording the audio, which it saves to /sdcard/.googleplay.security/ named as\n_“_VoiceCall_” + currentTime. It can also turn the mobile device into an audio recorder to timely_\nrecord audio every 60 seconds even when the user is not having a phone call.\n\n_Figure 3. Code snippet of malware performing offline audio recording on user device_\n\nApart from secretly recording audio using the affected device, the malware can also write and steal\ncontacts, SMS, call logs, and location information.\n\n_Figure 4. Code snippet of malware stealing contacts from user device_\n\n_Figure 5. Code snippet of malware stealing SMS content from user device_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6.

Code snippet of malware accessing http://mylocation.org to steal the user device’s](http://mylocation.org/)_\n_location related to its IP address. Note: the malware can still compromise the user even when they_\n\n_are outside India or South Asia._\n\n_Figure 8. Code snippet of malware stealing location information from user device through GPS or_\n\n_network_\n\nIn our research, we also found a malicious app, named after an Indian model-actress, which bears\nsimilarities to the code of PoriewSpy apps. Created in 2014, we speculate that this is an earlier\nversion of PoriewSpy that also shares the same C&C server with some of the latest ones. The\nmalicious app is capable of stealing call logs, contacts, SMS, SD card file list, and audio recording.\n\n_Figure 9. Left: Configuration code of the seemingly earlier version of PoriewSpy. Right:_\n\n\n-----\n\nApps built using DroidJack also appear to have been used by the hacking group behind PoriewSpy,\nbased on the C&C servers they share. The operators disguised these DroidJack-built apps as\nfreeCall, BatterySavor, Secure_Comm, and Nexus_Compatability.\n\nThe malicious apps are capable of obtaining all necessary permissions for an Android device’s\nmain functions, including accessing, modifying, and executing calls, SMS, phonebook, camera,\naudio recorder, as well as enable or disable Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\n**_The C&C servers of PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps_**\n\nSome of PoriewSpy’s C&C servers were located at 5[.]189[.]137[.]8 and 5[.]189[.]145[.]248, while\nsome of the DroidJack-built apps’ were at 93[.]104[.]213[.]217 and 88[.]150[.]227[.]71. Our\nresearch revealed that these four C&C servers were previously used by a hacking group who\nallegedly engaged in cyberespionage activities. The abused IPs 5[.]189[.]137[.]8,\n5[.]189[.]145[.]248, and 93[.]104[.]213[.]217 can be traced back to a legitimate hosting service\nprovider based in Germany. Meanwhile, 88[.]150[.]227[.]71’s is in the UK. 62[.]4[.]2[.]211, the\nC&C server of the initial version of PoriewSpy used by some of the latest versions, belongs to a\nservice provider in France. The hacking group also used draagon[.]ddns[.]net, located in South\nAsia.\n\n_Figure 10. The chart above shows the connections between the C&C servers of PoriewSpy and_\n\n_DroidJack-built apps, and the suspected cyberespionage group. The green dots represent the_\n_current malicious samples. IPs colored in yellow are the ones used by the group in their previous_\n\n_campaign, while the ones in red are presumably the extension to the mobile platform._\n\nThe period PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps became active also appear to match that of the\nhacking group’s campaign. It was observed that the activities of the abovementioned mobile\nmalware became active in late 2015 to early 2016, which was around the same period the hacking\ngroup’s campaign was also active.\n\n**_Countermeasures_**\n\nTargeted attacks on mobile devices may be few compared to ones for desktops or PCs, but the\ndiscovery of PoriewSpy and other malicious apps that spy on the mobile platform should caution\nusers of the threat that may come their way if their devices remain unsecured. Downloading only\nfrom legitimate app stores can prevent PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps from compromising\nyour mobile device. It is also important to be aware of what apps are allowed to access, and\n[to understand the risks before accepting any terms or granting certain permissions to apps.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/threat-intelligence-center/mobile-safety/)\n\nEnd users and enterprises can also benefit from multilayered mobile security solutions such\n[as Trend Micro™](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/mobile-security.html) [Mobile Security for Android™ which is also available on Google Play.
