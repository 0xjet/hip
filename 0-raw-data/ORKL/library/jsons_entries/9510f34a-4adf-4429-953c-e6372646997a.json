    "plain_text": "# FIN7.5: the infamous cybercrime rig “FIN7” continues its activities\n\n**[securelist.com/fin7-5-the-infamous-cybercrime-rig-fin7-continues-its-activities/90703/](https://securelist.com/fin7-5-the-infamous-cybercrime-rig-fin7-continues-its-activities/90703/)**\n\nAuthors\n\n[Yury Namestnikov](https://securelist.com/author/yurynamestnikov/)\n\nFélix Aime\n\nOn August 1, 2018, the US Department of Justice announced that it had arrested several\nindividuals suspected of having ties to the FIN7 cybercrime rig. FIN7 operations are linked to\nnumerous intrusion attempts having targeted hundreds of companies since at least as early\nas 2015. Interestingly, this threat actor created fake companies in order to hire remote\npentesters, developers and interpreters to participate in their malicious business. The main\ngoal behind its malicious activities was to steal financial assets from companies, such as\ndebit cards, or get access to financial data or computers of finance department employees in\norder to conduct wire transfers to offshore accounts.\n\nIn 2018-2019, researchers of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team analyzed\nvarious campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs) as the historic\nFIN7, leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite\n\n\n-----\n\nthe 2018 arrests. In addition, during the investigation, we discovered certain similarities to\nother attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the FIN7 TTPs in their own operations.\n\n## Recent FIN7 campaigns\n\nThe FIN7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last year.\nKaspersky Lab has been able to retrieve some of these exchanges from a FIN7 target. The\nspear phishing campaigns were remarkably sophisticated from a social engineering\nperspective. In various cases, the operators exchanged numerous messages with their\nvictims for weeks before sending their malicious documents. The emails were efficient socialengineering attempts that appealed to a vast number of human emotions (fear, stress, anger,\netc.) to elicit a response from their victims. One of the domains used by the attackers in their\n2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email aliases, leading us to think\nthat more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018.\n\n### Malicious Documents\n\nWe have seen two types of documents sent to victims in these spear phishing campaigns.\nThe first one exploits the INCLUDEPICTURE feature of Microsoft Word to get context\ninformation about the victim’s computer, and the availability and version number of Microsoft\nWord. The second one, which in many cases is an Office document protected with a trivial\npassword, such as “12345”, “1234”, etc., uses macros to execute a GRIFFON implant on the\ntarget’s computer. In various cases, the associated macro also scheduled tasks to make\nGRIFFON persistent.\n\nInterestingly, following some open-source publications about them, the FIN7 operators\nseems to have developed a homemade builder of malicious Office document using ideas\nfrom ThreadKit, which they employed during the summer of 2018. The new builder inserts\nrandom values in the Author and Company metadata fields. Moreover, the builder allows\nthese to modify different IOCs, such as the filenames of wscript.exe or sctasks.exe copies,\netc.\n\n**wscript.exe copy** **sctasks copy** **Task name** **C2**\n\n**byzNne10.exe** byzNne17.exe TaskbyzNne logitech-cdn.com\n\nc9FGG10.exe c9FGG17.exe Taskc9FGG logitech-cdn.com\n\n**zEsb10.exe** zEsb17.exe TaskzEsb servicebing-cdn.com\n\nIOCs extracted from docs which use sctasks for GRIFFON persistence\n\n**Author** **Company** **wscript.exe copy** **C2**\n\nmogjxjtvte mogjxjtvte mswmex44.exe logitech-cdn[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nsoxvremvge soxvremvge c9FGG10.exe logitech-cdn[.]com\n\ngareljtjhvd gareljtjhvd zEsb10.exe servicebing-cdn[.]com\n\nIOCs extracted from regular documents associated to GRIFFON\n\n### GRIFFON Implant\n\n_Griffon Malware attack pattern_\n\nThe GRIFFON implant is a lightweight JScript validator-style implant without any persistence\nmechanism. The malware is designed for receiving modules to be executed in-memory and\nsending the results to C2s. We were able to obtain four different modules during the\ninvestigation.\n\n**Reconnaissance module**\n\nThe first module downloaded by the GRIFFON malware to the victim’s computer is an\ninformation-gathering JScript, which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context of\nthe infected workstation. This module mainly relies on WMI and Windows objects to deliver\nresults, which will be sent back to the operators. Interestingly, more than 20 artifacts are\nretrieved from the system by this implant during the reconnaissance stage, from the date and\ntime of operating system installation and membership in a Windows domain to a list of and\nthe resolutions of the workstation’s monitors.\n\n**Meterpreter downloader**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second module is used by the operators to execute an obfuscated PowerShell script,\nwhich contains a Meterpreter downloader widely known as “Tinymet“. This downloader, seen\nin past FIN7 campaigns, downloads a one-byte XOR-encrypted (eg. with the key equal to\n0x50 or 0x51) piece of meterpreter shellcode to execute.\n\n**Screenshot module**\n\nThe third module allows the operators to take a screenshot of the remote system. To do that,\nit also drops a PowerShell script on the workstation to execute. The script executes an opensource .NET class used for taking a screenshot. The resulting screenshot is saved at\n“%TMP%/image.png”, sent back to the attackers by the GRIFFON implant and then deleted.\n\n**Persistence module**\n\nThe last retrieved module is a persistence module. If the victim appears valuable to the\nattackers, a GRIFFON implant installer is pushed to the victim’s workstation. This module\nstores another instance of the GRIFFON implant inside the registry to achieve persistence.\nHere is a PowerLinks-style method used by the attackers to achieve persistence and\nexecute the GRIFFON implant at each user logon. The new GRIFFON implant is written to\nthe hard drive before each execution, limiting the “file-less” aspect of this method.\n\nThrough its light weight and modular architecture, the GRIFFON implant is the perfect\nvalidator. Even though we have been able to retrieve four different modules, it is possible\nthat the FIN7 operators have more modules in their toolsets for achieving their objectives on\nthe victim’s workstation.\n\n## On the hunt for GRIFFON infrastructure\n\nAttackers make mistakes, and FIN7 are no exception. The major error made by its operators\nallowed us to follow the command and control server of the GRIFFON implant last year. In\norder to trick blue teams and other DFIR analysts, the operators created fake HTTP 302\nredirection to various Google services on their C2s servers.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\n\nServer: nginx\n\nDate: [retracted]\n\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n\nContent-Length: 0\n\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nLocation: https://cloud.google.com/cdn/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Returned headers for most of the GRIFFON C2s servers on port 443**\n\nThis error allowed us to follow the infrastructure week by week, until an individual pushed on\nTwitter the heuristic to track their C2 at the end of December 2018. A few days after the\ntweet, in January 2019, the operators changed their landing page in order to prevent this\ntype of tracking against their infrastructure.\n\n### Fake pentest company\n\nDuring the investigation related to the GRIFFON infrastructure, we found a strange overlap\nbetween the WHOIS record of an old GRIFFON C2 and the website of a fake company.\n\nAccording to the website, that domain supposedly belongs to a legitimate security company\n“fully owned by the Russian Government” (sic.) and having offices in “Moscow, Saint\nPetersburg and Yekaterinburg”, but the address says the company is located in Trump\nTower, in New York. Given FIN7’s previous use of false security companies, we decided to\nlook deeper into this one.\n\nAs we were looking at the content of the website, it became evident that almost all of the text\nused was lifted from legitimate security-company websites. Phrases and sentences were\nborrowed from at least the following companies/sites:\n\nDKSec – www.dksec.com\nOKIOK – www.okiok.com/services/tailored-solutions\nMainNerve – www.mainnerve.com\nDatics – www.datatics.com/cyber-security\nPerspective Risk – www.perspectiverisk.com\nSynack – https://www.synack.com/company\nFireEye – https://www.fireeye.com/services/penetration-testing.html\n\nThis company seems to have been used by the FIN7 threat actor to hire new people as\ntranslators, developers and pentesters. During our research, we found various job\nadvertisements associated with the company on freelance and remote-work websites.\n\nIn addition to that, various individuals have mentioned the company in their resumes. We\nbelieve that some of these individuals may not even be aware that they are working for a\ncybercrime business.\n\n## Links to other intrusion sets\n\nWhile tracking numerous threat actors on a daily basis during the final days of 2018 and at\nthe beginning of 2019, we discovered various activity clusters sharing certain TTPs\nassociated with the FIN7 intrusion set. The link between these threat actors and FIN7 is still\nweak, but we decided to disclose a few hints regarding these in this blog post.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CobaltGoblin/EmpireMonkey\n\nIn his history, FIN7 has overlapped several times with Cobalt/EmpireMonkey in terms of\nTTPs. This activity cluster, which Kaspersky Lab has followed for a few years, uses various\nimplants for targeting mainly banks, and developers of banking and money processing\nsoftware solutions. At the end of 2018, the cluster started to use not only CobaltStrike but\nalso Powershell Empire in order to gain a foothold on the victims’ networks. After a\nsuccessful penetration, it uses its own backdoors and the CobaltStrike framework or\nPowershell Empire components to hop to interesting parts of the network, where it can\nmonetize its access.\n\nFIN7’s last campaigns were targeting banks in Europe and Central America. This threat actor\nstole [suspected of stealing €13 million from Bank of Valetta, Malta earlier this year.](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20190225/local/how-bov-hackers-got-away-with-13-million.702800)\n\nExample of malicious documents used in the end of 2018 to beginning of 2019\n\nA few interesting overlaps in recent FIN7 campaigns:\n\nBoth used macros to copy wscript.exe to another file, which began with “ms” (mses.exe\n– FIN7, msutil.exe – EmpireMonkey).\n\nBoth executed a JScript file named “error” in %TEMP% (Errors.txt in the case of FIN7,\nErrors.bat for EmpireMonkey).\nBoth used DocuSign decoy documents with different macros. The macros popped the\nsame “Document decryption error” error message—even if macro code remain totally\ndifferent.\n\nWe have a high level of confidence in a historic association between FIN7 and Cobalt, even\nthough we believe that these two clusters of activity are operated by different teams.\n\n### AveMaria\n\n\n-----\n\nAveMaria is a new botnet, whose first version we found in September 2018, right after the\narrests of the FIN7 members. We have medium confidence that this botnet falls under the\nFIN7 umbrella. In fact, AveMaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all possible\ncredentials from various types of software: browsers, email clients, messengers, etc., and\ncan act as a keylogger. Since the beginning of 2019, we have collected more than 1300\nsamples and extracted more than 130 C2s.\n\nTo deliver their malware, the cyber criminals use spearphishing emails with various types of\nattachments: MS Office documents or spreadsheet files exploiting some known vulnerability\nlike CVE-2017-11882, or documents with Ole2Link and SCT. They also use AutoIT droppers,\npassword-protected EXE files and even ISO images. What is interesting, in some emails,\nthey ask targets to phone them if they have any questions, like the FIN7 guys do.\n\nExample of AveMaria spearphing emails. Criminals suggest calling them.\n\nDuring the investigation into FIN7, our threat-hunting systems found an interesting overlap in\nbetween the infrastructure of FIN7 and AveMaria. Basically, two servers in the same IP range\nand AS14576 (autonomous system) share a non-standard SSH port, which is 222. One of\nthe servers is a Griffon C2, and the other one, an AveMaria C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nDistribution of targets is another factor suggesting that these two malware families may be\nconnected. We analyzed AveMaria targets during February and March of 2019. The\nspearphishing emails were sent to various kinds of businesses only and did not target\nindividuals. Thirty percent of the targets were small and medium-sized companies that were\nsuppliers or service providers for bigger players and 21% were various types of\nmanufacturing companies. We also spotted several typical FIN7 targets, such as retailers\nand hotels. Most AveMaria targets (72%) were in the EU.\n\n### CopyPaste\n\nAt the end of 2018, while searching for new FIN7 campaigns via telemetry, we discovered a\nset of activity that we temporarily called “CopyPaste” from a previously unknown APT.\nInterestingly, this actor targeted financial entities and companies in one African country,\nwhich lead us to think that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training\ncenter.\n\nThis set of activity relied on open-source tools, such as Powershell Empire, and welldocumented red teaming techniques, in order to get a foothold within the victim’s networks\nand avoid detection.\n\nHere are the main similarities between CopyPaste and FIN7:\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth used the same Microsoft PowerShell argument obfuscation order: powershell.exe\n-NoP -NonI -ExecutionPolicy Bypass”. We have only seen FIN7 and CopyPaste use\nthis argument list for executing their malicious Powershell Scripts.\nBoth used decoy 302 HTTP redirections and typosquatting on their C2s (reminiscent of\nCobalt and FIN7). The Empire C2s associated with CopyPaste had decoy redirections\nto Digitcert and Microsoft websites and used decoy job employment and tax websites\nwith decoy redirections to host their payloads. FIN7 and Cobalt used decoy 302 HTTP\nredirections too, FIN7 on its GRIFFON C2s before January 2018, and Cobalt, on its\nstaging servers, similar to CopyPaste.\nQuite recently, FIN7 threat actors typosquatted the brand “Digicert” using the domain\nname digicert-cdn[.]com, which is used as a command and control server for their\nGRIFFON implants. CopyPaste, in turn, also typosquatted this brand with their\ndomains digicertweb[.]com and digi-cert[.]org, both used as a Powershell Empire C2\nwith decoy HTTP 302 redirects to the legitimate Digicert website.\n\nThe links between CopyPaste and FIN7 are still very weak. It is possible that the CopyPaste\noperators were influenced by open-source publications and do not have any ties with FIN7.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nDuring 2018, Europol and DoJ announced the arrest of the leader of the FIN7 and\nCarbanak/CobaltGoblin cybercrime groups. It was believed that the arrest of the group\nleader will have an impact on the group’s operations. However, recent data seems to indicate\nthat the attacks have continued without significant drawbacks. One may say CobaltGoblin\nand FIN7 have even extended the number of groups operating under their umbrella. We\nobserve, with various level of confidence, that there are several interconnected groups using\nvery similar toolkits and the same infrastructure to conduct their cyberattacks.\n\nThe first of them is the well-known FIN7, which specializes in attacking various companies to\nget access to financial data or PoS infrastructure. They rely on a Griffon JS backdoor and\nCobalt/Meterpreter, and in recent attacks, Powershell Empire. The second one is\nCobaltGoblin/Carbanak/EmpireMonkey, which uses the same toolkit, techniques and similar\ninfrastructure but targets only financial institutions and associated software/services\nproviders.\n\nWe link the AveMaria botnet to these two groups with medium confidence: AveMaria’s\ntargets are mostly suppliers for big companies, and the way AveMaria manages its\ninfrastructure is very similar to FIN7. The last piece is the newly discovered CopyPaste\ngroup, who targeted financial entities and companies in one African country, which lead us to\nthink that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center. The links\nbetween CopyPaste and FIN7 are still very weak. It is possible that the operators of this\ncluster of activity were influenced by open-source publications and do not have any ties with\nFIN7.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of the aforementioned groups greatly benefit from unpatched systems in corporate\nenvironments. They thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction\nwith well-known MS Office exploits generated by the framework. So far, the groups have not\nused any zero-days.\n\nFIN7/Cobalt phishing documents may seem basic, but when combined with their extensive\nsocial engineering and focused targeting, they are quite successful. As with their previous\nfake company “Combi Security”, we are confident that they continue to create new personas\nfor use in either targeting or recruiting under a “new” brand, “IPC”.\n\nMore information about these and related attacks is available to customers of Kaspersky\nIntelligence Reports.
