Dragonfly is an APT hacker group, who have been reported to\n\nspecifically target organizations in the energy sector as well as companies in other ICS sectors such as\n\nindustrial/machinery, manufacturing and pharmaceutical.\n\nIn my 4SICS talk I disclosed a previously unpublished comprehensive view of ICS software that has been\n\ntrojanized with the Havex backdoor, complete with screenshots, version numbers and checksums.\n\n[Dale Petersen, founder of Digital Bond, expressed the following request regarding the lack of public](http://www.digitalbond.com/blog/2014/07/02/havex-hype-unhelpful-mystery/)\n\ninformation about the software trojanized with Havex:\n\nIf the names of the vendors that unwittingly spread Havex were made public, the wide coverage\n\nwould likely reach most of the affected asset owners.\n\nFollowing Dale's request we decided to publish the information presented at 4SICS also in this blog post,\n\nin order to reach as many affected asset owners as possible. The information published here is based on\n\n[our own sandbox executions of Havex malware samples, which we have obtained via CodeAndSec and](https://twitter.com/CodeAndSec)\n\n[malwr.com. In addition to what I presented at 4SICS, this blog post also includes new findings published](https://malwr.com/)\n\n[by Joel \"scadahacker\" Langill in version 2.0 of his Dragonfly white paper, which was released just a couple](http://twitter.com/scadahacker)\n\nof hours after my talk.\n\n[In Symantec's blog post about Havex they write:](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-companies-under-sabotage-threat)\n\nThree different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the\n\nsoftware bundles\n\n**Trojanized MESA Imaging driver**\n\nThe first vendor known to have their software trojanized by the Dragonfly group was the Swiss company\n\nMESA Imaging, who manufacture industrial grade cameras for range measurements.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image: Screenshot of trojanized MESA Imaging driver installer from our sandbox execution_\n\n**Company:** MESA Imaging\n\n**Product:** Swiss Ranger version 1.0.14.706 (libMesaSR)\n\n**Filename:** SwissrangerSetup1.0.14.706.exe\n\n**Exposure:** Six weeks in June and July 2013 (source: Symantec)\n\n**Backdoor:** Sysmain RAT\n\n**MD5:** e027d4395d9ac9cc980d6a91122d2d83\n\n**SHA256:** 398a69b8be2ea2b4a6ed23a55459e0469f657e6c7703871f63da63fb04cefe90\n\n**eWON / Talk2M**\n\n[The second vendor to have their software trojanized was the Belgian company eWON, who provide a](http://www.ewon.biz/)\n\nremote maintenance service for industrial control systems called “Talk2M”.\n\n[eWon published an incident report in January 2014 and then a follow-up report in July 2014 saying:](http://www.ewon.biz/en/talk2m-incident-report.html?cmp_id=7&news_id=4860)\n\nBack in January 2014, the eWON commercial web site www.ewon.biz had been compromised.

Additionally, only the mbCHECK version for users in Europe was\n\ninfected with Havex, but not the one for US / Canada. These facts indicate that the Dragonfly / Energetic\n\nBear threat actor seems to primarily target ICS companies in Europe.\n\n**Next: Detecting Havex with NSM**\n\nWe're currently working on a follow-up blog post, which shows how to detect and analyze network traffic\n\nfrom ICS networks infected with Havex.\n\n|Company:|MB Connect Line GmbH|\n|---|---|\n|Product:|VCOM_LAN2|\n|Filename:|setupvcom_lan2.exe|\n|Exposure:|April 16 to April 23, 2014 (source: MB Connect Line)|\n|Backdoor:|unknown|\n|MD5:|unknown|\n|SHA256:|unknown|\n\n\n-----\n\nPosted by Erik Hjelmvik on Monday, 27 October 2014 11:11:00 (UTC/GMT)\n\n\n-----",
