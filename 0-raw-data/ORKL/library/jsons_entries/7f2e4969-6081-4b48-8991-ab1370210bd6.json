Two [large-scale blackouts in Ukraine caused by Russian cyberattacks in](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/)\n2015 and 2016 showed just how feasible it is. But grid hacking comes in less dramatic forms\n[as well—which makes Russia's continued probing of US critical infrastructure all the more](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems/)\nalarming.\n\nAt the CyberwarCon forum in Washington, DC on Wednesday, researchers from threat\nintelligence firm FireEye noted that while the US grid is relatively well-defended, and difficult\nto hit with a full-scale cyberattack, Russian actors have nonetheless continued to benefit\nfrom their ongoing vetting campaign.\n\n\"There’s still a concentrated Russian cyber espionage campaign targeting the bulk of the US\nelectrical grid,\" says FireEye analyst Alex Orleans says. \"The grid is still getting hit.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye calls the Russia-linked hacking group that has been targeting the US grid\n\"TEMP.Isotope.\" It's [also known as Dragonfly 2.0, or Energetic Bear. The group mostly uses](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hacking-teams-infrastructure/)\ngeneric hacking tools and techniques created by other actors—a strategy known as \"living off\nthe land\"—to minimize development time and costs, while also making it harder to identify\nand track its movements. But TEMP.Isotope has also created at least one custom system\nbackdoor, and often uses spearphishing and infected websites to compromise targets. And\nthe group has brought these tools to bear against the US grid in a patient and methodical\nway.\n\n\"The grid is still getting hit.\"\n\nAlex Orleans, FireEye\n\nUS infrastructure does have some advantages here. In the wake of the massive 2003\nNortheastern blackout, utilities implemented resilience and defense standards known as the\nNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection\nrequirements, more digestibly referred to as NERC CIP. These created minimum baselines\nfor defending against and dealing with natural disasters, but also promoted best practices for\nnetwork defense, including two-factor authentication, network segmentation, data storage\nprotections, and strict access controls for both network owners and third-parties.\n\nAll of these protections combined have hardened electricity generation and transmission\nsystems against attack. But not all segments of the grid are held to those standards.\nDistribution entities, which often subcontract with larger organizations to deliver power\nlocally, often lack adequate resources and defenses. And while hackers may have a harder\ntime fully compromising more formidable targets, they can still achieve many of their goals\nthrough persistent probing.\n\nIn many ways, TEMP.Isotope's actions are in the interest not of triggering large-scale\nblackouts, but of traditional intelligence-gathering. The group seems to deliver information\nthat can be used both to expand Russian energy capabilities and to vet US systems for\nweaknesses that could potentially be exploited in attacks. But the FireEye researchers point\nout that the canvassing also serves other more subtly aggressive counterintelligence goals\nas well.\n\n\"All of this threat activity you see from actors like Isotope requires defensive responses from\nincident responders, threat intelligence within a given organization, all the way up to\npotentially governments,\" Orleans says. \"So you have this ripple upward and outward. And\nthis counterintelligence is for the purpose of frustrating your adversary. Utilities are the\nadversary for active threat Isotope, so wearing them down through activity, creating anxiety,\nfulfills what is in counterintelligence terminology known as 'degradation.'\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you can sow discord, confusion, and fatigue, you can attack an adversary by frustrating\nthem rather than by masterminding an all-out physical assault. And though grid hacking may\nnot have yet reached a boiling point in the US, the FireEye researchers warn that consistent\nprobing should be taken as seriously as dramatic attacks. This is particularly true given that\nthe security community has seen hints over the years of potential US grid probing activity\n[from other countries as well, including Iran and North Korea.](https://www.wired.com/story/hacking-a-power-grid-in-three-not-so-easy-steps/)\n\nFor now, though, the FireEye researchers say Russian state-sponsored hackers are the\nones to watch in the US grid. \"The most consistent people are likely the Russians,\" Orleans\nsays. \"And I also think we likely haven’t fully uncovered the extent to which they have gotten\ninto the wires.\"\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\nHey, [turn off Siri on your lock screen](https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-siri-lock-screen-attacks/?BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3)\nIs Lord of the Rings [prejudiced against Orcs?](https://www.wired.com/2018/11/geeks-guide-lotr-orcs/?BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3)\n[Machine learning can create fake fingerprints](https://www.wired.com/story/deepmasterprints-fake-fingerprints-machine-learning/?BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3)\n[Wish List 2018: 48 smart holiday gift ideas](https://www.wired.com/gallery/wish-list-2018-48-awesome-holiday-gift-ideas/?BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3)\nFei-Fei Li's quest to make AI [better for humanity](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence-humanity/?BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3)\n[Looking for more?
