Here, we are tackling a much bigger threat given the frequency it is abused by\ndiverse threat actors. In this blogpost, we describe step by step how to ensure a proactive\n**and defensive posture against Cobalt Strike, one of the most powerful pentesting tools**\nhijacked by attackers in their numerous campaigns.\n\nWe show examples of how to track Cobalt Strike command and control servers (C2) and\nMalleable profiles by focusing on their SSL certificates and HTTP responses.\n\nWe also describe ways to detect: (i) Cobalt Strike payloads such as the DNS beacon based\non the nature and volume of Cobalt Strike DNS requests, (ii) Cobalt Strike privilege\nescalation with the Cobalt Strike built-in service svc-exe, (iii) Cobalt Strike lateral movement\nwith the Cobalt Strike built-in service PsExec and (iv) Cobalt Strike beacons communication\nthrough named pipes.\n\n## Why should defenders focus on Cobalt Strike hunting and detection ?\n\nWhat do APT29, APT32, APT 41, APT19, UNC2452, FIN6, Wizard Spider and most of the\ncybercriminals have in common in their toolset?\n\n\n-----\n\nWell, as shown on the figure above, the answer is Cobalt Strike.\n\nCobalt Strike is a commercial, post-exploitation agent, designed to allow pentesters to\nexecute attacks and emulate post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors. It aims at\nmimicking threat actors’ tactics, techniques and procedures to test the defenses of the target.\nHowever, over the last years, it’s purposes were hijacked by attackers who managed to crack\nits official versions and leverage them in their attacks thus taking advantage of Cobalt\nStrike’s remote access and defense evasion capabilities.\n\nCobalt Strike is now widely being used by threat actors regardless of their capabilities, skill\nsets, the sophistication of their attacks or the objectives of their campaigns. To mention just a\nfew examples, it has been leveraged in the recent advanced and state-sponsored\n\n\n-----\n\n[SolarWinds supply chain attacks [1], as well as in the frequent and offensive campaigns](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/20/deep-dive-into-the-solorigate-second-stage-activation-from-sunburst-to-teardrop-and-raindrop/)\n[conducted by different cybercriminals groups such as Wizard Spider [2], [3] and the Egregor](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/01/31/bazar-no-ryuk/)\ngroup [[4] ultimately delivering ransomware payloads.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/egregor-raas-continues-the-chaos-with-cobalt-strike-and-rclone/)\n\nIn 2020, it was seen as one the most leveraged pentesting tools by attackers, alongside\n[Mimikatz and PowerShell Empire [5]. Overall, in Q4 of 2020, 66% of all ransomware](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/crowdcasts/threat-hunting-report-insights-2020/)\n**attacks involved Cobalt Strike payloads** **[[6].](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/CTIR-quarterly-trends-Q4-2020.html)**\n\nTherefore, all these data highlight our need as a defender to be aware and up to date\nregarding the threat posed by the use of Cobalt Strike for malicious purposes.\n\n## In a few words, how does Cobalt Strike work?\n\nCobalt Strike works in a client/server mode. The server is known as the Team Server, it runs\non a Linux system, controls the beacon payload and receives all information from the\ninfected hosts. The client software (known as the Aggressor) runs on multiple operating\nsystems and enables the user to connect to different Team Servers in order to configure the\nbeacon, deliver the payload and fully use all of Cobalt Strike’s features remotely.\n\nBeacon is the Cobalt Strike payload, highly configurable through the so-called “Malleable C2\nprofiles” allowing it to communicate with its server through HTTP, HTTPS or DNS. It works in\nasynchronous or interactive mode, and can build stageless or staged payload, offering\noverall considerable flexibility.\n\nOnce connected to its C2 server, the user configures a “listener” (HTTP, DNS …) and a\nstageless or staged beacon (Windows PE, PowerShell …). The beacon delivery can be\ndirectly achieved from the Cobalt Strike server or through another user tool.\n\n[This tool is straightforward to use and very well documented [7] which explains its increasing](https://cobaltstrike.com/support)\npopularity.\n\nTo adopt a proactive posture and protect our customers from attacks leveraging Cobalt\nStrike, we have focused on both tracking Cobalt Strike servers and implementing up-to-date\nrules capable of detecting each version of Cobalt Strike.\n\nAttacks performed with leaked versions of Cobalt Strike are generally carried out with old\nversions depending on how easy it is to find these leaks. For this lab session we chose to\nuse the version 4.2 (released the 06/11/2020), which has been leaked on hacker forums and\nwas easy to stumble upon.\n\nThe latest 4.3 version was just released (03/03/2021). Aside from the usual new features and\nbug fixes for each release, we have witnessed some efforts to fix the most specific technical\ndetails that help detect Cobalt Strike. We discuss some of them in this article, but it is\nundoubtedly a never ending game.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Télécharger](https://info.sekoia.io/analyse-infrastructures-des-attaquants-cyber)\n\n## This is how we hunt for Cobalt Strike C2 servers\n\nWe currently possess more than 50 trackers for Cobalt Strike C2 servers and Malleable\nprofiles, which enabled us to feed, with high confidence, our Intelligence database with more\nthan 10.000 IPs in 2020, that detected Cobalt Strike intrusions. To know more about our\n[hunting results, you can read our analysis following this link.](https://info.sekoia.io/analyse-infrastructures-des-attaquants-cyber)\n\nYou will find below an example of three features you can track to spot Cobalt Strike servers.\nSeveral trackers are valid for old versions of Cobalt Strike. But as you will notice when\nconsidering the number of servers we still detect by dint of these trackers, they are still\neffective. As said previously, threat actors usually use leaked versions which are not\nnecessarily the most recent ones.\n\n## Keep a close eye on default certificates\n\nCobalt Strike servers come with a default certificate displaying specific values for the serial\nnumber, the issuer, the subject and the certificate validity as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf they have not been modified by the attackers, these servers can be easily spotted using a\nshodan request. At the time of writing, 700 servers match this certificate serial number.\n\n## What does the HTTP response tell us?\n\n[For Cobalt Strike versions prior to version 3.13, the http response displays an extraneous](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/releasenotes.txt)\nspace at the end of the http status.\n\nAt the time of writing, we can still catch 30 servers using this tracker. The same detection\ncould be done using Snort rules.\n\n## Let’s check a malleable C2 profile\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Malleable C2 profiles allow to customize Cobalt Strike, which also\nmeans that some public configuration could be used to track C2 servers.\n\n[Here is an example of a malleable C2 profile, with a self-signed certificate [8] that we can](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/microsoftupdate_getonly.profile)\nhunt using shodan.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe certificate issuer information (common name, organization, organization unit, location,\nand country) matched with 116 servers online in 2020.\n\n## How can we detect Cobalt Strike with our SIEM?\n\nWe performed some attacks using Cobalt Strike beacons in laboratory conditions, so we\n[could figure out some ways to detect it with our SIEM SEKOIA.IO.](https://www.sekoia.io/en/homepage/)\n\nFor this blogpost, we chose to focus on an attack that was carried out using a DNS beacon\nas a first stage listener and the SMB beacon for lateral movement. We then managed to\ndetect each step using either Cobalt Strike leaked source code or the generated logs.\n\nTo detect it using the following rules you will need to have access these events logs:\n\nMicrosoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational (and the relevant symon config, especially for\nNamed Pipe)\nMicrosoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational (or any other AntiVirus logs)\nDNS and Proxy logs\n\nHere is an explanation of rules that can be implemented into your SIEM to specifically detect\nthis attack.\n\nDNS beaconing is a very useful feature, which allows to bypass any other HTTP filtering or\nproxy inspection that may exist in the targeted company.\n\nLast year the Cobalt Strike source code (4.0 version) was leaked, and a security researcher\nquickly spotted some interesting characteristics for DNS beaconing:\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the CobaltStrike source code, you can now build nice query rules for your local\nPassive DNS database or NIDS.\n\n[https://t.co/EzLrBljp8b](https://t.co/EzLrBljp8b) [pic.twitter.com/wqOTew28u1](https://t.co/wqOTew28u1)\n\n[— Alexandre Dulaunoy (@adulau) November 12, 2020](https://twitter.com/adulau/status/1326813096711761921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe mentioned source code reveals that Cobalt Strike is using three constant DNS labels in\npair with DNS question type: “cdn” for A type, “api” for TXT type and “www6” for AAAA type.\nThat means that at some point when the beacon will try to reach its C2 server, aside from\ntwo random labels and the one chosen by the user, that constant string will be used: it is very\nconvenient in terms of detection and enables us to build this kind of rule:\n```\n(dnsquery.value LIKE ‘www6.%’ AND dnsquery.type = ‘AAAA’) OR (dnsquery.value LIKE\n‘cdn.%’ AND dnsquery.type = ‘A’) OR (dnsquery.value LIKE ‘api.%’ AND dnsquery.type =\n‘TXT’)\n\n```\nUsing this rule we were able to detect the first stage of our attack that leveraged the DNS\nbeacon as shown below.\n\nThe rule needs some exceptions (e.g. cdn.onenote.net, cdn.fwupd.org) in order to avoid\npossible false positives in your DNS traffic, but seems reliable. Latest Cobalt Strike 4.3\n[version brings new options to override the default values through a Malleable C2 profile [9].](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/releasenotes.txt)\nWith the previous versions attackers will need to modify the source code or patch their\nbeacon binaries.\n\n## Beaconing network traffic\n\nAnother behavior that can be detected relies on the interval value between two beacon\nnetwork requests, which has no “sleep” time by default. This configuration could be modified\nwith a Malleable C2 profile.\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore, working with Cobalt Strike in interactive mode will generate a considerable\namount of network requests especially with some beacon (e.g. DNS) when it comes to\ndownloading/uploading files. That could be leveraged for detection using classical behavior\nrules.\n\nDuring our attack, we observed that for both DNS and HTTP beacons, even with only the\nbeacon activity (no exfiltration or command), the total DNS/HTTP requests from the infected\nhost exceeded 200 requests by minutes.\n\nThe rule could take this form:\n```\nselection DNS/HTTP requests | count() by minute src_ip > 200\n\n## Detects when an attacker elevate its privileges using svc-exe and move laterally using PsExec\n\n```\nWe managed to elevate our privileges within the victim system. We chose to achieve this\nusing svc-exe, which is a built-in Cobalt Strike exploit.\n\nIt will drop an executable that runs a payload, create a service to run it, assume control of the\npayload, and cleanup the service and executable. Thus allowing us to get SYSTEM.\n\nThen, we wanted to perform a lateral movement and jump to the new targeted host. We\nchose to do so leveraging an SMB beacon which is a good candidate frequently leveraged in\nattacks.\n\nWe ran a command on Cobalt Strike that leverages psexec64 as follows:\n```\n$ jump psexec64 <host-ip> <name-of-our-SMB-beacon-listener>\n\n```\nThis is one of the features that make Cobalt Strike a strong and efficient tool. It relies on\nnative Windows APIs and not a third-party protocol stack, thus increasing its defense\nevasion capabilities. Hence, Cobalt Strike has a built-in PsExec, which strength lies in its\nability to launch interactive command-prompts on remote systems. It can be run on the\nvictim’s system since it uses native Windows components.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed that these operations resulted in a service creation. They both spawned\nrundll32.exe that initiated a network connection, which is the event ID 3 of the MicrosoftWindows-Sysmon/Operational journal. What makes it different from the usual behavior of\nrundll32, is that the dll is run without any command line arguments.\n\nThis behavior is anchored in Cobalt Strike. Unless attackers wisely decide to change this\nconfiguration in the source code, this surely will spot many other attacks.\n\n## Pipes to detect them all\n\nA pipe is a section of shared memory that processes use for communication. The process\nthat creates a pipe is the pipe server. The one that connects to a pipe, is the pipe client. A\nprocess writes information to the pipe, while the other process reads the information from the\npipe.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two types of pipes: named and anonymous pipes.\n\nNamed pipes are one-way or duplex pipes that are used for network interprocess\ncommunication that can take place between a pipe server and one or more pipe clients.\nMultiple pipe clients can use the same named pipe simultaneously in the same instance.\n\nAnonymous pipes are unnamed, one-way pipes that are used for interprocess\ncommunications between a parent and a child process, only on a local computer.\n\nCobalt Strike has the ability to pivot over named pipes. It uses pipes to allow a beacon to\nreceive its commands and send its ones to another beacon. In this situation, both beacons\nwill communicate over pipe channels as highlighted by the orange arrow in the pivot graph\nshown below. Cobalt Strike also uses TCP sockets and SSH sessions to connect a beacon\nsession to another.\n\nHence, when we connected a listener (e.g. DNS beacon) with another beacon (e.g. SMB\nbeacon) to perform lateral movement, we observed the creation of the sysmon event ID 17\n“Pipe created”, in our logs.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our various tests, we observed that the created pipe displayed the same pattern that\ncan be detected by this regex:\n```\nMSSE-[0-9]{4}-server\n\n```\nCobalt Strike users cannot change the default value of these pipes without accessing and\nmodifying the source code configuration of Cobalt Strike.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the pipes that are created to allow beacons to communicate,\nfrom the named pipes that are generated specifically for the SMB beacon, and which default\nvalue is in the form of: msagent_39 as shown below. Unlike the MSSE pipes, the default\nvalue of the pipe name of the SMB beacon can be easily modified on the attack interface.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Default payload\n\nFor a lot of user interactions, Cobalt Strike displays a default value, and especially for the\npayload naming. Of course it is a very weak detection indicator, but a mistake is always\npossible and defenders only need one.\n\nDuring our lab tests with different use cases, we had theses default binaries names:\n```\nbeacon.{bin|exe|dll|ps1}, artifact.{dll|exe}, payload.{java|ps1|py|rb|vba}\n\n```\nAnti-virus logs at that point could also be an easy win: most AVs have specific signatures that\ncould be used to trigger an alert in your SIEM, and detect an attacker who forgot to use its\ncustom payload.\n\nMore globally, binaries’ other characteristics (on disk or in memory), could also be used as\ndetection indicators. That is why Cobalt Strike’s editor advises to customize it with a\n[Malleable C2 profile or the Artifact Kit [10].](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-artifact-kit)\n\n\n-----\n\nMany public yara rules exist in order to precisely do that, and try to follow existing payload\n[available in the wild [11]. This is recommended if you have an EDR capability.](https://www.randhome.io/blog/2020/12/20/analyzing-cobalt-strike-for-fun-and-profit/)\n\n## How to mitigate Cobalt Strike?\n\nAs said before, most of Cobalt Strike beacons characteristics can be customized. Either\ndirectly on the user interface for some of them, through a malleable profile or by directly\nreversing the source code. Hence, it is essential to be as exhaustive as possible regarding\nthe detection capacity.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that Cobalt Strike designer made it one of its priority to always ensure\nthat its tool can not be detected, releasing a new version each time the last version was well\ndocumented by defenders. Highlighting for us the need to be up to date regarding the new\nversions characteristics. Since, attackers mostly used leaked versions, we are still a step\nahead in detecting the latest threats.\n\nGiven the volumes of attacks performed with Cobalt Strike, combining both C2 server\nhunting and beacon detection as shown in this article, is definitely a good way to ensure the\nbest protection and tighten the net around that threat.\n\nTo be protected against it, we highly recommend you to rely on a real-time detection solution\nfuelled by cyber threat intelligence.\n\nBesides having an up-to-date SIEM, there are also these evident course of actions that\ndefenders could leverage:\n\nCobalt Strike can be dropped in victims systems following phishing campaigns\nleveraging VBS scripts. It is recommended to disable document macro in MS office.\nTraining users to notice malicious emails should also be performed on a regular basis.\nCobalt Strike payload can be delivered as a powershell script. It is recommended to\nrestrict powershell script execution to allow signed scripts only.\nSome Cobalt Strike payload signatures can be identified by antivirus. It is\nrecommended to have a good antivirus product.\nCobalt strike beacons generate abnormal behaviors that can be hunted using Sysmon,\nSecurity, PowerShell and WMI logs.\nIt is recommended to hunt for parent processes spawning unexpected child processes.\nMonitor suspicious modifications to registry keys, startup folders, task scheduler and\nservice execution.\n\nIf you have been infected by Cobalt Strike, it is recommended to carry out memory forensics.\nThe tool CobaltStrikeScan available on github scan for files and process memory for Cobalt\n[Strike beacons and parse their configuration [12]. It scans Windows process memory for](https://github.com/Apr4h/CobaltStrikeScan)\nevidence of DLL injection.\n\n\n-----",
