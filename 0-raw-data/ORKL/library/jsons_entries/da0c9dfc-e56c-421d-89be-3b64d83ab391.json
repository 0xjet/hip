Investigating deeper into these potential adversary IPs revealed\na much larger infrastructure used to execute the attacks. We found the infrastructure was\nsegregated into different functions for specific malicious objectives. We found some sites that\nwere set up as credential harvesters (likely used in phishing attacks), a compromised system\nthat was used to interact with a TwoFace webshell to hide the actor’s location, and finally\nsystems that interact with TwoFace webshell-compromised systems to provide command\nand control direction of those compromised systems.\n\nIn addition to uncovering the attack infrastructure for this adversary, we were able to\n[determine a significant link between the operators of the set of attacks involving TwoFace](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/twoface/)\n[and another attack campaign we have published on in detail: OilRig](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/oilrig/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spoofing Sites and Credential Harvesters\n\nWe observed the IP address 137.74.131[.]208 interacting with the TwoFace webshell as\ndescribed in our previous blog. Our investigation of the passive DNS entries for this IP\nrevealed a potential link to a credential harvesting campaign carried out by the threat group\nbehind the TwoFace webshell attacks. Looking into passive DNS entries for the IP gave us\nthe following domain resolutions:\n\nowa-insss-org-ill-owa-authen[.]ml\nwebmaiil-tau-ac-il[.]ml\nmail-macroadvisorypartners[.]ml\nwebmail-tidhar-co-il[.]ml\nmy-mailcoil[.]ml\nlogn-micrsftonine-con[.]ml\nso-cc-hujii-ac-il[.]ml\n\nThese domain names, on initial inspection, appear to be emulating legitimate webmail login\nportals, indicating that these are likely to be credential harvesters. We confirmed this as seen\nbelow:\n\n_Figure 1a. Example of a credential harvester_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 b. Example of a credential harvester_\n\nOur further examination revealed that these credential harvesters were crafted to be exact\nreplicas of the legitimate sites they were purporting to be. This is a common tactic deployed\nby adversaries leveraging credential harvesters to increase the chance that a user will input\ntheir credentials and decrease suspicion of nefarious activity.\n\nBreaking down the intended targeting for these credential harvesters reveals interesting\ntarget grouping.\n\nowa-insss-org-ill-owa-authen[.]ml is likely intended to mimic the INSSS or the Institute\nof National Security Studies, a thinktank for Israel’s national security agenda.\n[webmaiil-tau-ac-il[.]ml is likely intended to mimic Tel Aviv University, the largest](https://english.tau.ac.il/)\nuniversity in Israel.\n[mail-macroadvisorypartners[.]ml is likely intended to mimic Macro Advisory Partners, a](http://www.macroadvisorypartners.com/)\nprominent strategic consulting firm that has published insights into the Israel region.\n[webmail-tidhar-co-il[.]ml is likely intended to mimic the Tidhar Group, an Israeli based](https://www.tidhar.co.il/en/default.aspx)\nreal estate and property management company.\n[my-mailcoil[.]ml is likely intended to mimic Bezeq International’s webmail application.](https://www.bezeqint.net/english)\nBezeq International is an Israeli based telecommunications company providing\nconsumer and enterprise services.\n[so-cc-hujii-ac-il[.]ml is likely intended to mimic the Hebrew University of Jerusalem](http://new.huji.ac.il/en)\nwhich is the second oldest university in Israel.\n\nEach of these organizations appear to be either Israeli based or have strong Israeli\nconnections and interests. Credential harvesters in general are not uncommon, but it is\nsignificant to have a grouping of region and company specific harvesters. This grouping\n\n\n-----\n\nleads us to believe that this adversary is likely to have had a specific mission to accomplish,\nwhich involved breaching specific organizations. This is in contrast to more generic\ncredential harvesting by targeting common applications such as Gmail or Facebook.\n\nThe relationship between the credential harvesters hosted on 137.74.131[.]208 and the\ninteraction with TwoFace is still unclear at this time. We do know the operator of TwoFace\nhad access to both TwoFace and these spoofing sites. And it is highly unlikely that it is a\ncoincidence that these specifically designed spoofing sites were on the same infrastructure\nas TwoFace when both target the same geopolitical region.\n\n## Additional Webshells\n\nBy analyzing additional TwoFace samples, as well as the traffic seen associated with\nTwoFace, we were able to find additional webshells used by this threat group. The additional\nwebshells show that this threat group does not solely rely on TwoFace when deploying a\nwebshell on a compromised web server.\n\n**RunningBee**\n\nA second IP of high interest seen interacting with the TwoFace webshell was 192.155.x.x,\nwhich is owned by SoftLayer. This IP resolves to a domain owned by the Ministry of Oil of a\nnation-state in the Middle East. The use of this IP is interesting as there are only two\npossibilities as to why this specific IP would be directly interfacing with the TwoFace shell:\neither it is the adversary themselves, or it has been compromised and is being used as part\nof the adversary infrastructure.\n\nBased upon additional telemetry found in AutoFocus, we believe it is highly likely that this IP\nwas indeed compromised and added to the adversary infrastructure. The telemetry revealed\nthat this IP was not only used to interact directly with the TwoFace shell discussed in our\nprevious blog, but also used to upload post-exploitation tools to another shell hosted on a\nMiddle Eastern educational institution. We have named this second webshell “RunningBee”.\n\nRunningBee is a webshell that requires an actor to enter a password before running\ncommands or uploading files to the webserver much like TwoFace. However, the shell itself\nis different from a UI and code perspective. The samples of RunningBee that we identified\nrequires the password “NeshaNesha12” for interaction. This is notable because this same\npassword was mentioned in Cylance’s [Operation Cleaver report as a password for webshells](https://www.cylance.com/content/dam/cylance/pages/operation-cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf)\nused by one of the members of that operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 RunningBee webshell_\n\nInvestigating RunningBee activity revealed that the 192.155.x.x IP uploaded at least four\nadditional tools to that compromised system with RunningBee on it, as seen in Table 1.\nPlease reference the 'Post-exploitation Tools SHA256' section at the end of this blog for full\nhashes of the tools mentioned throughout in this blog.\n\n**Date Uploaded** **SHA256** **Filenames** **Tool**\n\n\n10/06/2016,\n02/19/2017\n\n\n3b08535b4add194...

The tools listed in Table 2 include the same\ntools that were uploaded to RunningBee such as PsExec, Mimikatz and Local.exe. In\naddition to these tools, we also discovered the existence of the remote connection tool\nknown as PuTTY Link (plink) and a custom Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) web\nserver backdoor that we track as RGDoor. We believe the threat actors may have used plink\nto connect to additional systems on the compromised network after obtaining legitimate\ncredentials using a tool such as mimikatz. RGDoor is an HTTP module that the threat actors\nare likely loading into the IIS web server to maintain an additional, backup access point\nshould the compromised organization detect and remediate the installed webshell (e.g.\nTwoFace, RunningBee) from the server.\n\n**SHA256** **Filename** **Tool** **Shells** **IP addresses**\n**uploading**\n\n744e0ce108598aa...

After\ngathering additional TwoFace loader shells, we noticed that some of these TwoFace loaders\ncontained an embedded shell that differed from the TwoFace payload we originally found\n[and published in our previous blog. This different shell, which we call LittleFace, contains](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/07/unit42-twoface-webshell-persistent-access-point-lateral-movement/)\nmuch less functionality and is relatively simple compared to its TwoFace payload\ncounterpart. LittleFace also differs from the previous TwoFace payloads as once it is saved\nto the system, it no longer requires authentication.\n\nThe LittleFace shell does not display a web-based user interface like most webshells.\nInstead, it is a webshell that allows the threat actor to pass commands to Windows command\nprompt by issuing HTTP POST requests with the desired command within the “c” field of the\n\n\n-----\n\nposted data, as seen in the following code block that is the command handler on the\nwebshell. The webshell will receive the commands embedded in the HTTP POST requests\nand hand them off to another function (“r” function in the following code block) for processing.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\nvoid Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\ntry\n{\nstring cmd = Request[\"c\"];\nr(cmd);\n}\ncatch (Exception)\n{\n}\n}\n\n\nThe LittleFace shell will execute the command (‘r’ function seen in code block above) by\ncreating a “cmd.exe” process and writing the desired command to the process’ standard\ninput. The result of the command is provided back to the actor directly within the HTTP\nresponse to the POST request.\n\n## OilRig Link\n\nWhile examining each of the tools that were found on the compromised sites, one specific\nsample of Mimikatz showed evidence of a potential relationship with the OilRig campaign.\n\nAs detailed in our April 2017 blog \"OilRig Actors Provide a Glimpse into Development and\nTesting Efforts\", we were able to track an entity that appeared to be testing and iterating\nthrough different variations and versions of tools associated with the OilRig campaign. This\nsame entity was found submitting a specific sample of Mimikatz a day after testing multiple\nHelminth samples. We observed actors uploading this specific sample of Mimikatz to the\nTwoFace webshell hosted at the Saudi education institution mentioned earlier in this blog,\nleading us to believe that there is a likely relationship between the OilRig campaign and the\nTwoFace campaign. The extent of this relationship is unknown at this time. While we cannot\nbe absolutely certain that this is the same adversary in both attacks, we are able to ascertain\nthat this specific entity does have access to OilRig tools and also has access to a very\nspecific sample of Mimikatz only found in this attack infrastructure.\n\nExpanding on the possible relationship between TwoFace and OilRig, examining the tactical\noverlap of both attacks may also provide additional data points to link them. Specifically,\nsignificant targeting overlap exists with both attacks, with multiple organizations in multiple\nnation states throughout the Middle East region being targeted either as a final target or\nadded as part of the attack infrastructure. One possible scenario of how TwoFace and OilRig\nare used in conjunction could be where the adversary uses the ClaySlide documents to\ndeliver Helminth, which is then used as an initial landing point or beachhead into the target’s\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork. From there, the adversary may use the initial ingress point and its corresponding\npermissions to install the TwoFace webshell on accessible systems. Additional postexploitation tools such as the ones we discovered may then have been uploaded to the now\ncompromised systems via the TwoFace file upload function.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we have continued our research into operations in the Middle East, we are beginning to\nuncover more and more overlaps between the various adversary groups and campaigns\noutlined by us and others in the public domain. In this incident, we were able to follow a trail\nstarting from a single webshell to a bevy of compromised sites, credential harvesters, postexploitation tools, and even an operational overlap with what we originally thought was an\nunrelated attack campaign. The Middle East region has proven to be a hotbed of threat\nactivity in recent times, with continued acceleration of pacing as well as development in the\ntactics and techniques used. There is no indication that this type of threat activity will cease,\nbut with continued discovery of the adversary’s playbooks, implementation of strong security\npolicies, and effective deployment of technology, we can make it far less worthwhile for the\nadversary to execute their attacks.\n\n## Post-exploitation Tools SHA256 Hashes\n\n28a0db561ff5a525bc2696cf98d96f443f528afe63c5097c5e0ccad071fcb8c2\n744e0ce108598aaa8994f211e00769ac8a3f05324d3f07f7705277b9af7a7497\ncaf5f9791ab3049811e16971b4673ec6d4baf35ffaadd7486ea4c5e318d10696\n6ae32cd3b5a8a1dbb5464372ded370f31802fd1f5031795b43d662c64fc5b301\n3b08535b4add194f5661e1131c8e81af373ca322cf669674cf1272095e5cab95\n450ebd66ba67bb46bf18d122823ff07ef4a7b11afe63b6f269aec9236a1790cd\n5b7eb534a852c187eee7eb729056082eec7a028819191fc2bc3ba4d1127fbd12\n6e623311768f1c419b3f755248a3b3d4bf80d26606a74ed4cfd25547a67734c7\n497e6965120a7ca6644da9b8291c65901e78d302139d221fcf0a3ec6c5cf9de3\nd3b03c0da854102802c21c0fa8736910ea039bbe93a140c09689fc802435ea31\n5ead94f12c307438e6475e49f02bedaee0cd09ce6cebb7939f9a2830f913212c\nbb9b4e088eb99100156f56bbd35a21ff7e96981ffe78ca9132781e9b3f064f44\n\n## Credential Harvesting Domains\n\nowa-insss-org-ill-owa-authen[.]ml\n\nwebmaiil-tau-ac-il[.]ml\n\nmail-macroadvisorypartners[.]ml\n\nwebmail-tidhar-co-il[.]ml\n\nmy-mailcoil[.]ml\n\nlogn-micrsftonine-con[.]ml\n\nso-cc-hujii-ac-il[.]ml\n\n\n-----\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
