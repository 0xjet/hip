A quick triage of the\n[sample found overlap with malware tracked internally as CopperStealer. This external interest caused](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\nProofpoint researchers to investigate further, eventually leading to coordinated disruptive actions by Facebook,\nCloudflare, and other service providers.\n\nOur investigation uncovered an actively developed password and cookie stealer with a downloader function,\ncapable of delivering additional malware after performing stealer activity. The earliest discovered samples\ndate back to July of 2019. While we analyzed a sample that targets Facebook and Instagram business and\nadvertiser accounts, we also identified additional versions that target other major service providers, including\nApple, Amazon, Bing, Google, PayPal, Tumblr and Twitter.\n\nCopperStealer exhibits many of the same targeting and delivery methods as SilentFade, a Chinese-sourced\nmalware family first reported by Facebook in 2019. Proofpoint believes Copperstealer to be a previously\n[undocumented family within the same class of malware as SilentFade, StressPaint, FacebookRobot and](https://www.radware.com/security/malware/stresspaint-malware-targeting-facebook-credentials)\n[Scranos. Facebook](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2019/04/inside-scranos-a-cross-platform-rootkit-enabled-spyware-operation/) [attributed the creation of SilentFade to Hong Kong-based ILikeAD Media International](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/taking-action-against-ad-fraud/)\n[Company Ltd and during the 2020 Virus Bulletin conference disclosed it was responsible for over $4 million in](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Karve-Urgilez.pdf)\ndamages by “compromising people’s Facebook accounts and then using people’s accounts to run deceptive\nads”.\n\n**Distribution Methods**\n\nProofpoint researchers observed suspicious websites advertised as “KeyGen” or “Crack” sites, including\nkeygenninja[.]com, piratewares[.]com, startcrack[.]com, and crackheap[.]net, hosting samples that have\ndelivered multiple malware families including CopperStealer. These sites advertise themselves to offer\n“cracks”, “keygen” and “serials” to circumvent licensing restrictions of legitimate software. However, we\nobserved these sites ultimately provide Potentially Unwanted Programs/Applications (PUP/PUA) or run other\nmalicious executables capable of installing and downloading additional payloads (Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: A “cracked” application being hosted which dropped CopperStealer._\n\n**Sinkholing Activity**\n\nDuring this investigation, Proofpoint researchers worked closely with researchers at Facebook, Cloudflare, and\nother service providers to coordinate disruptive action. This included Cloudflare placing a warning interstitial\npage in front of the malicious domains and establishing a sinkhole for two of the malicious domains before they\ncould be registered by the threat actor.\n\nThis sinkhole, a method of concurrently limiting the actor’s ability to collect victim data while enabling\nresearchers to gain visibility into victim demographics, provided valuable insight into the malware’s behavior\nand scope. In the first 24 hours of operation, the sinkhole logged 69,992 HTTP Requests from 5,046 unique IP\naddresses originating from 159 countries representing 4,655 unique infections. The top five countries based on\nunique infections were India, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan and The Philippines.\n\nAfter approximately 28 hours of operating the sinkhole, the amount of traffic declined sharply. At the same\ntime, it was observed that CopperStealer was no longer being distributed via the keygenninja[.]com website.\n\n**Malware Analysis**\n\nA sample with the SHA256 hash of\n[5fa60303a0c4fd13ecd69e7c1a17788b72605473c2fb3f93eb758010326c76e5 was used for this analysis.](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/5fa60303a0c4fd13ecd69e7c1a17788b72605473c2fb3f93eb758010326c76e5/)\n\n**Naming**\n\nSince November 2019, Proofpoint and Emerging Threats have identified this threat as ‘CopperStealer’ and\n[have tracked it internally since then, as well as in ETPRO signatures. This name originates from observed](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/daily-ruleset-update-summary-20191114)\nPDB and process memory strings referencing 'DavidCopperfield' (Figure 2). In January 2021, after other\nresearchers had shown interest in this malware, ESET created specific anti-virus detection for this threat under\n[the name ‘Mingloa’; however, Proofpoint continues to refer to this as CopperStealer.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/eset_nod32%253AWin32%252FMingloa/files)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Process Memory Strings\n\n**Anti-Analysis**\n\nThe malware does make use of several basic anti-analysis techniques to avoid running within researcher\nsystems.\n\nIsDebuggerPresent() check\nGetSystemDefaultLCID() == 0x804 (Chinese (Simplified, PRC)  zh-CN) check\nWindow/class enumeration looking for common analysis tools:\n\nTCPViewClass\nTStdHttpAnalyzerForm\nHTTP Debugger\nTelerik Fiddler\nASExplorer\nCharles\nBurp Suite\nDevice enumeration looking for indicators of virtualization:\n\nvmware\nvirtual\nvbox\n\n**Facebook and Instagram Data Retrieval**\n\nThe malware contains the ability to find and send saved browser passwords. The following Internet browsers\nare searched specifically for Facebook saved credentials:\n\nChrome\nEdge\nYandex\nOpera\nFirefox\n\nIn addition to the saved browser passwords, the malware uses stored cookies to retrieve a User Access Token\nfrom Facebook. Once the User Access Token is gathered, the malware requests several API endpoints for\nFacebook and Instagram to gather additional context, including a list of friends, any advertisement accounts\nconfigured for the user and a list of pages the user has been granted access (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: The Facebook and Instagram requests generated by the malware\n\nAll requests created from the analyzed sample contain a static Accept-Language header of \"koKR,ko;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7\". The analyzed sample produces many lowercased request headers,\nthough this behavior does not appear in all versions (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: The malware sending a request using stolen cookies to gather additional information of the victim\nFacebook account.\n\n**Downloader Function**\n\nCopperStealer’s downloader function retrieves a download configuration from the c2 server. The analyzed\nsample extracts a 7z archive named xldl.dat (18c413810b2ac24d83cd1cdcaf49e5e1) and then executes one\nof the extracted files (ThunderFW.exe - f0372ff8a6148498b19e04203dbb9e69) via:\n\n_C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\download\\ThunderFW.exe ThunderFW \"C:\\Users\\_\n_<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\download\\MiniThunderPlatform.exe\"_\n\nThe executed binary appears to be a legitimate download manager called Xunlei created by Xunlei Networking\nTechnologies, LTD, that while legitimate, was previously identified being bundled with malware in 2013\n[reported by ESET. CopperStealer uses an API exposed from the Xunlei application in order to download the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/10/11/win32kankan-chinese-drama/)\nconfiguration for the follow-up binary.\n\nThe analyzed sample downloads a configuration from the C2 server with a URI path of \"/info/dd\" (Figure 5).\nThe download configuration has also been retrieved from alternative URI paths (See Malware Evolution\nSection below). The configuration returned by the server is encrypted and encoded using the same method as\nother messages detailed within this report. The configuration contains details pertaining to the location and\nexecution of the payload (Figure 6).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Encrypted download configuration returned from the C2 server.\n\nFigure 6: Decrypted download configuration served by the C2 server.\n\n**Dropped Malware**\n\nMost recently, Smokeloader has been observed as a downloaded payload\nfrom hxxp://dream[.]pics/setup_10.2_mix1.exe. However, historical network traffic shows a variety of malware\nbeing delivered from a handful of urls.\n\nRecent SmokeLoader samples:\n\n9f9ec27591faea47ca6c72cf26911d932a2a7efe20fdd1a6df8ea82e226fbf38\nc9d92e36006663f53a01a14800389bd29f3266f00727cce1f39862cceccc50b0\nbb5d2c07ce902c78227325bf5f336c04335874445fc0635a6b67ae5ba9d2fefc\n381ab701bc1e092cb3ad5902e3b828e4822500418fbde8f8102081892e0a095a\n29c0dca8a7ce4f8be136e51bb4a042778277198e76ddd57dda995b7fb0ce5b35\n3c1f7af5e69a599268bcb3343b8609006a255090234d699c77922c95743e9e98\n679150089d1fa44cf099ff4cf677dc683a3fb1bab81b193a56414ac5a046aeeb\n9902a7fdaac2e764b8e50adbd9ebca4d8d510c2df9af6c5c6a19c721621dd873\n\n\n-----\n\nd74b612aa9f21f0d12bdb8a8e8af894bd718a1145c41ec64a646cf4fa78e9f75\n\n**Host Artifacts**\n\nWhile there are no observed persistence techniques in the analyzed sample, there are several opportunities\nfor host-based detection.\n\n**Mutex Creation**\n\nThe analyzed sample created a mutex called \"Global\\exist_sign_install_r3\" while other samples have created\nrelated mutexes:\n\nGlobal\\exist_sign__install_r3\nGlobal\\exist_sign_task_Hello001\nGlobal\\exist_sign_task_Hello002\n\n**Created Registry Key**\n\nThe analyzed sample first attempts to open a specific registry key (below) and is later created. This registry\nkey is used to determine the malware has been previously run on the victim machine and is used when\ndetermining the value of \"isfirst\" flag in the exfiltrated data.\n\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\vindiesel_\n\n**Dropped Certificates**\n\nA certificate, SHA1 Fingerprint=6C:0C:E2:DD:05:84:C4:7C:AC:18:83:9F:14:05:5F:19:FA:27:0C:DD, related to\n[Charles Proxy is loaded into the victim machine's \"My\" and \"Trusted Root\" certificates stores. The existence of](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)\nthis certificate in the \"My\" certificate store is used when determining the value of the \"isfirst\" flag in addition to\nthe vindiesel registry key. The Subject Common Name of this certificate contains:\n\n_Charles Proxy CA (19 十月 2019, DESKTOP-BNAT11U)_\n\n**Dropped Kernel Driver**\n\nThe analyzed sample also can drop and load a kernel driver\n(d4d3127047979a1b9610bc18fd6a4d2f8ac0389b893bcb36506759ce2f20e7e4). The purpose of this driver is\ncurrently unknown.\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nThis malware uses HTTP in order to communicate with C2 servers which are generated using a Domain\nGeneration Algorithm (DGA). During investigation into various CopperStealer samples Proofpoint researchers\ndiscovered two distinct DGA methods in use, which are detailed below. While the use of TLS has been\nobserved in more recent samples, most communication does not make use of TLS.\n\n**Domain Generation Algorithm**\n\n[Initially reported by \"Johann Aydinbas\" on Twitter the malware uses a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) in](https://twitter.com/jaydinbas/status/1355193203725643780)\n[order to generate new command and control servers on a daily basis. A Python3 script is publicly available to](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/tree/master/copperstealer)\ngenerate all domains for the observed DGA methods.\n\n**_Version 10 – Version 47_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DGA is based on the middle 16 characters of an MD5 hash of a concatenated string of a seed and the\ncurrent UTC date in YYYYMMDD format. As observed within process memory strings, the analyzed sample\nutilizes the \"seed\" of \"exchangework\" (Figure 7).\n\nAs an example, the process of generating the DGA domain for Feb 10, 2021 using the seed of\n\"exchangework\" is detailed below:\n\n1. Create the string: \"exchangework20210210\"\n2. Calculate the md5 of string: \"2fe5b3641cd81defbab5fc17db5c36c9\"\n3. Extract the middle 16 characters of md5: \"1cd81defbab5fc17\"\n4. Apply the Top-Level Domain (TLD): \"1cd81defbab5fc17[.]xyz\"\n\nWe identified several different seeds using this domain pattern among other artifacts.  A timeline of seed use\ncan be found in the Malware Evolution section below.\n\nDavidCopperfield\nFrankLin\nWebGL\nVindiesel\nexchangework\nchangenewsys\nhellojackma\n\nFigure 7: The DGA seed observed in process memory strings.\n\n**_Version 50.0 – Version 52.0_**\n\nAs of February 21, 2021, we observed a slightly modified DGA beginning with Version 51.0\n(cde543ca4a84d89bd3c7c0e908b044f2).  The DGA is still based on the middle 16 characters of an MD5 hash\nof a concatenated string of a “seed” and the current UTC month in YYYYMM format. Five additional DGA\ndomain variants created by appending the digit “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5” to the concatenated string and contains a\nsingle hardcoded backup server (Figure 8).\n\n**C2 string** **MD5** **DGA Domain**\n\nhellojackma202102 6efdb73ec8224b778f8d7e733cdda77a c8224b778f8d7e73[.]com\n\nhellojackma2021021 92fc307e52959825ae41ce72ebbe0bc6 52959825ae41ce72[.]com\n\nhellojackma2021022 8e4bb5a0574e0f440d5d411d0189ab9d 574e0f440d5d411d[.]com\n\nhellojackma2021023 4e2b0de8844106c92ac5210af536e236 844106c92ac5210a[.]com\n\nhellojackma2021024 42f6d2b8687b318f1a4e0afc52fa4eb9 687b318f1a4e0afc[.]com\n\nhellojackma2021025 52612d7eeaa5cd71691e472c2e4182da eaa5cd71691e472c[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1: February 2021 C2 domains for Version 51.0 DGA.\n\nFigure 8: Version 51 DGA seed observed in process memory strings.\n\n**_Version 60.0_**\n\nOn March 11, 2021, we identified another slight modification in Version 60.0 that resulted in additional DGA\ndomains being generated for each month. These are the same methods from Version 50.0, but this version\nincluded two additional hardcoded domains and extended the DGA domain variants by appending the digits “1”\n– “10” to the concatenated string. This results in an “extended” list of domains compared to the Version 50.0\nsample.\n\n**C2 Traffic Examples**\n\nThe analyzed sample exhibits several different types of messages sent to the C2 server. All messages from\nthe client to the server are sent via POST requests using encrypted message content within the \"info\" key and\nall decrypted content is `^A` (\\x5e\\x41) delimited.\n\n**_Status Updates_**\n\nThe analyzed sample sends status update messages to the HTTP Request URI of `/info/step` via a POST with\nthe key of `info` and the value contains encrypted message data (Figure 9). The decryption and encoding\nmethods are detailed within the report.\n\nFigure 9: A status update being delivered via an HTTP request made by the malware.\n\nThe status update message contains three fields (Figure 10). The “guid” value, a 16 character string matching\nthe regex \"^(?:[a-f0-9]{16}|[A-F0-9]{16})$\", appears to be generated based on the MachineGuid value and the\nComputerName.\n\nThe analyzed sample has the following \"status\" values:\n\n\n-----\n\nmain_start\ncheck_start\nfb_start\nins_start\ndl_start\n\nFigure 10: Decrypted and split content of a status update message.\n\n**_Data Exfiltration_**\n\nCopperStealer sends the exfiltrated data to the C2 server via a POST request to a variety of target specific\nURIs (Figure 11). The data is stored withing the “info” key and is encrypted as described within the “C2 Traffic\nencryption” section of this report. The data exfiltrated contains target specific data fields (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 11: Facebook Data exfiltrated to the C2 server via “/info/fb”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: The decrypted Facebook data sent to the C2 server.\n\nThe ads_info key contains a modified base64 encoded string (not encrypted) which decodes to a json string\nwith information of any setup ad accounts (Figure 13).\n\nFigure 13: Details of the ads_info decoded data.\n\nReverse engineering indicated Instagram data is exfiltrated via POST requests to \"/info/ins\" with the following\nkeys:\n\nguid\nver\nseller\nos\ncookie\nfans\n\n**_Download Status Updates_**\n\nAfter completing the downloader function, a downloader specific status update message is sent the C2 server.\nThese status updates messages are sent using the same encryption method as other messages via a POST\nrequests to \"/info/retdl\" with the following keys:\n\n\n-----\n\nname\nchannel\nos\nguid\ndownok\nregok\n\nFigure 14: Downloader status update being send to the C2 server.\n\n**C2 Traffic encryption**\n\nWhile the malware does not use HTTPS communications, it does leverage DES encryption and a modified\nbase64 encoding.  Within the HTTP traffic, the 'info' form item contains the encrypted details. Several different\nkey and iv values have been observed (Table 2).\n\n**Key** **IV**\n\ntaskhost winlogon\n\nrundll32 explorer\n\nloadfaid unsigned\n\nTable 2: DES Encryption Keys and IVs for network communication.\n\nA [Python3 script has been created to decrypt the communications using the observed key and ivs.](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/tree/master/copperstealer)\n\n**Malware Evolution**\n\nThe first observed sample using the DGA method is associated with Version 10 of the malware. Proofpoint has\nobserved rapid development most recently finding Version 52 first observed on March 5, 2021.\n\n**Seed Changes**\n\n\n**Seed** **First**\n**Observed**\n\n\n**Sample SHA256**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Seed** **First**\n**Observed**\n\nDavidCopperfield July 26,\n2019\n\nFrankLin June 1,\n2020\n\nWebGL September\n22, 2020\n\nVindiesel December\n8, 2020\n\nexchangework January\n10, 2021\n\nchangenewsys January\n13, 2021\n\nhellojackma February\n8, 2021\n\nhellojackma February\n21, 2021\n\nhellojackma March\n11, 2021th\n\n\n**Sample SHA256**\n\n\n81202529443a234489720c0030b05d3b5c28fe046a412953e95110699cc9b7cf\n\n\n3225ce04d0b89652ac6b1f59180eefd41b5a6fdcbabd9066da710cdab462383e\n\n\n449973a46282cfbce784d86b42a26a5a259b3f552627986aec57bac4902d3461\n\n\ndaa6931054a125d49f43537a7c07a3bfad8854e18c0c25b49ad7808040f92bb8\n\n\n6ec80bae15601abfa57fc8ca0a3a83bd6af876a47123c3d8a0ac1761ca3b1289\n\n\n10bb601f27c0aae7fb9cc88a45434a8dcd759c03698c00b322f8b7f78ed64164\n\n\nf9188822ce06ba4017508737fd6304babaee4832cfb94803b7ef83e0de9d5327\n\n\n1edec40732a728195ffea9946dd65ede6072c3c5061cfa3cc6e7cf6b7769052c\n\n\nb2996f082d4b43cf9ea3de083ba882269b5f63d6ac53bf31449831e75cb6e4a9\n\n\nTable 3: A Timeline of DGA Seeds\n\n**Major Version Updates**\n\nThere have been 80 different versions observed in the year and half CopperStealer has been distributed in the\nwild. Our investigation found that the release of new versions increased in frequency starting in August 2020\nand accelerated between October 2020 and February 2021, with several updates being released every month\n(Figure 15).\n\nFigure 15: A graph showing the frequency of new version observations.\n\n**C2 Traffic Changes**\n\n\n-----\n\nSome versions exhibit different URI structures for sending status updates and exfiltrated data (Figure 16).\n\nFigure 16: Network Traffic from Version 46.0.0\n\n**Target Variation**\n\nWhile the analyzed sample targets Facebook and Instagram, network traffic gathered from other versions\nindicates other service providers were targeted with unique URI paths that were used for exfiltration (Table 4).\n\nTable 4: Samples observed targeting other service providers.\n\n**Dynamic Cookie Collection**\n\nDuring a brief dynamic analysis of a Ver 51.0 sample (ed21e90c75aec59d0278efb7107f9253) an HTTP\nrequest to “/info/r” is made. The response from the C2 server contains an encrypted partial domain name\n“amazon.” (Figure 17). The next HTTP request made by the malware is a data exfiltration containing data fields\nwhich reference of the amazon URL (Figure 18).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: The C2 server responding with a partial domain.\n\nFigure 18: Amazon details exfiltrated to the C2 server.\n\n**Hardcoded Backup C2s**\n\nStarting with Version 47.0 (c2227bff513c463298e61ef82a5c4665) the malware implements hardcoded backup\nservers in addition to the standard DGA generated domains. The specific hardcoded domains have changed\nfrom version to version. In the case of Version 47.0, the sample introduced hardcoded backup C2 servers\nfrom the \"changenewsys\" seed covering the DGAs for Feb 12, 2021 to Feb 23, 2021 (Figure 19). The most\nVersion 60.0 sample is configured to use domains in other Top Level Domains (TLDs) such as the .io, .ru and\n.su. These domains can be found in the Indicators of Compromise section of this report.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: Process memory strings of Version 47.0 showing backup C2 servers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile CopperStealer isn't the most nefarious credential/account stealer in existence, it goes to show that even\nwith basic capabilities, the overall impact can be large. Previous research from Facebook and Bitdefender has\nexposed a rapidly increasing ecosystem of Chinese-based malware focused on the monetization of\ncompromised social media and other service accounts. Findings from this investigation point towards\nCopperStealer being another piece of this everchanging ecosystem. CopperStealer’s active development and\nuse of DGA based C2 servers demonstrates operational maturity as well as redundancy. After sinkholing\nactivities helped disrupt CopperStealers current activities, we will continue to monitor the threat landscape to\nidentify and detect future evolutions of this malware.\n\nProofpoint threat research would like to thank those in the information security research community who share\nand provide observations for all to use. As described earlier in this post, the collaborative efforts granted us the\nopportunity to proceed further than just creating detections. Our team encourages researchers to work\ncollaboratively and share information together to move detections, disruption, and research forward.
