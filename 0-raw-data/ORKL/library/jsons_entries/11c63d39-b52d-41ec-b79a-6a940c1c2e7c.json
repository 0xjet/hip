The interruption of power, water, or transportation systems can have\na major impact on ordinary citizens and put huge pressure on organizations\nand governments to restore systems quickly.\n\nThe Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear enrichment program that was\ndiscovered in 2010, an attack on the power grid in Ukraine in 2015, and\nthe recent attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the U.S., are just some of the\nhigh-profile incidents affecting CNI that have been publicly reported. Cyber\nattacks on power grids can cause anxiety due to the potential negative\nimpacts they can have on ordinary citizens: the attack in Ukraine occurred\nin December, cutting out power and heat for citizens in the middle of\nEurope’s winter. Thankfully, in that case, power was restored reasonably\nquickly, but the fact that attackers were able to gain access to the power\ngrid to shut it down in the first place was a cause for significant concern.\n\nThe recent Colonial Pipeline attack in the U.S. also caused a huge reaction,\nleading to people stockpiling gasoline amid fears of a fuel shortage. In a\nworld where almost all systems are internet connected to some degree,\ngood cyber security in CNI has never been more important.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis paper will look at some of the most high-profile cyber attacks on CNI we have observed, including the\nColonial Pipeline attack, and some previously unpublished research into an attack campaign aimed at some CNI\ninfrastructure in a South East Asian country.\n\nWe will also look at what Symantec data tells us about malicious activity aimed at the CNI sector, and the steps you\ncan take to help protect your organization.\n\nSome of the key points covered in this paper:\n\n  - The Colonial Pipeline incident and other recent attacks have underlined the disruptive potential of\nransomware for CNI and the pressure that can be exerted on organizations to pay ransoms in an effort to\nrestore essential services quickly, making them a prime target for ransomware criminals.\n\n  - Attacks on CNI are a global issue, with high-profile incidents having occurred in the U.S., Europe, and the\nMiddle East.\n\n  - Symantec data indicates that an increasing number of malicious actors are attempting to attack CNI\norganizations, but the number of attackers successfully installing malware on the endpoint in the sector is\ntrending down.\n\n  - Attacks on CNI can be hard to contain or keep under wraps for affected businesses, leading to potential\ndamage to business reputation as well as major effects on ordinary citizens. This was demonstrated in both\nthe Colonial Pipeline and Ukraine power grid attacks.\n\n  - A comprehensive cyber security strategy with the implementation of policies like network segmentation, Zero\nTrust, and multi-factor authentication is essential for businesses in this sector, particularly in order to keep\nproduction networks safe even if corporate networks become infected.\n\n  - Malicious actors targeting this sector use living-off-the-land tools and techniques, as well as malware, to\ntarget and infect victims.\n\n  - Though rare, we have seen both destructive attacks and attacks with physical impact aimed at organizations\nin the CNI sector, so this is something companies in this sector need to be aware of. Due to the wide impact\ndisruption of organizations in this sector can have, organizations need to be aware they could be the subject\nof attacks from highly skilled, nation-state-backed malicious actors.\n\n### Methodology\n\nCritical National Infrastructure (CNI) is a broad sector that encompasses a number of different industries. The\n[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) lists 16 critical infrastructure sectors “whose assets,](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)\nsystems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their\nincapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national\npublic health or safety, or any combination thereof.” This includes the following:\n\n  - Healthcare and Public Health\n\n  - Financial Services\n\n  - Food and Agriculture\n\n  - Transportation Systems\n\n  - Information Technology\n\n  - Government Facilities\n\n  - Emergency Services\n\n  - Dams\n\n  - Communications\n\n  - Chemical\n\n  - Commercial Facilities\n\n  - Critical Manufacturing\n\n  - Defense Industrial Base\n\n  - Energy\n\n  - Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, given the size of some of these sectors, for the purposes of this paper we will be concentrating primarily\non a subset of these sectors, including the following:\n\n  - Energy Sector\n\n  - Dams\n\n  - Chemical\n\n  - Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste\n\n  - Water and Wastewater Systems\n\n  - Critical Manufacturing\n\n  - Transportation Systems\n\n  - Commercial Facilities\n\n### Colonial Pipeline: U.S. Infrastructure Under Attack\n\nOn May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline, one of the biggest fuel pipelines in the U.S., providing 45% of the fuel consumed\n[on the East Coast, was forced to shut down operations following a ransomware attack.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/08/cyber-attack-colonial-pipeline/)\n\nThe finger of blame for this incident was quickly pointed at a group called Darkside (aka Coreid), a ransomware-asa-service operation that is widely believed to operate from Eastern Europe. This attack attracted a huge number of\nheadlines in the U.S. and around the globe, a response from the White House, and, seemingly, the shutdown of the\noperations of the ransomware gang responsible.\n\n##### The Attack\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline is 5,500 miles long, travels through 14 states and is responsible for providing almost half of the\nfuel supply of the East Coast of the U.S. Its shutdown caused alarm among residents of eastern and southeastern\nstates of the U.S., with fears that a prolonged shutdown could lead to fuel shortages and price hikes. The level of\npanic was such that there were reports of gas stations running out of fuel, and people going so far as to fill plastic\nbags with gasoline.\n\nIn a statement about the attack, Colonial said it temporarily shut down all its pipeline operations after learning it\nhad been hit by a cyber attack on some of its “information technology” systems. The firm said it “proactively took\ncertain systems offline to contain the threat.”\n\nThe seriousness of the attack was underlined when the government invoked emergency powers in response to the\nhack. The Department of Transportation issued an emergency declaration on May 9 in response to the incident\nto relax regulations for drivers carrying gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products in 17 states\nand the District of Columbia. It allowed them to work extra or more flexible hours to make up for any fuel shortage\nrelated to the pipeline outage.\n\nThankfully, Colonial was able to restart the pipeline five days after it had shut it down, although it did say it would\ntake “several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal.”\n\n[While it wasn’t initially clear whether or not Colonial had paid a ransom to the attackers, Bloomberg News reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom)\n[on May 13 that the company had paid a ransom of $4.4 million. The company reportedly paid the ransom within](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom)\nhours of the attack occurring, and received a decryption key from the attackers. However, the decryption process\nwas reportedly so slow that the company also continued to use its own backups to recover from the attack.\n\nSpeaking in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on June 8, Colonial\nPipeline’s CEO Joseph Blount defended his decision to pay the ransom to the attackers, stating that he had “put\nthe interests of the country first.” He also revealed that the attackers gained initial access to the company’s network\n[through a “legacy VPN” account that the company’s IT team did not know existed. The account was protected with](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/colonial-ceo-at-senate-hearing-details-ransomware-attack-a-16836)\nonly a password and did not have multi-factor authentication enabled.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Attackers\n\nDarkside, which Symantec tracks as Coreid, is a ransomware-as-a-service operation that works with affiliates\nto conduct ransomware attacks and takes a share of the profits. Coreid develops the malware and affiliates\ncarry out the attacks. Like most ransomware actors these days, Coreid carries out what are known as “double\nextortion” attacks, where they steal victims’ data and threaten to publish it to further pressure victims into paying\nthe ransom demand. An unusual aspect of Coreid’s operation is that it claims to prohibit affiliates from attacking\ncertain organizations, including hospitals, hospices, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and government\nagencies.\n\nThe group was first seen in August 2020, but a new level of interest was drawn to the group in the wake of the\nattack on Colonial Pipeline. Coreid had been noted for the level of “professionalism” employed by the group since it\nemerged, with the gang reportedly even providing a phone number and a help desk to facilitate negotiations with\nvictims. This “professionalism” was evident in the wake of the Colonial attack too, with the group issuing a press\nrelease after it was named as the perpetrator of this attack. The group said it was “apolitical” and not associated\nwith any government, and also stated that its goal was to make money, and not create problems for society. It said\nthat in the future it would introduce moderation and check each company that its partners want to encrypt to\navoid “social consequences.”\n\nCoreid is believed to be a financially-motivated cyber crime group, and is not thought to be nation-state-backed or\ninterested in cyber espionage. While Symantec cannot definitively say where Coreid is based, public reports state\nthe group is based in Eastern Europe, with Russia considered to be its most likely base. The group does check for\nthe language used on infected machines and does not proceed with an attack if Russian or several other languages\nspoken in former Soviet bloc nations are installed on the machine.\n\nCoreid is thought to be a very profitable ransomware group, having reportedly taken in around $90 million.\n[Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic found and analyzed payments made to Coreid from 47 different Bitcoin wallets,](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/darkside-ransomware-has-netted-over-90-million-in-bitcoin)\nwith the payments totaling $90 million, which would mean the average ransom paid to Coreid was approximately\n$1.9 million. This would put Coreid at the high end of ransomware earners that we have seen, with this amount of\nmoney also collected in a reasonably short period of time, considering the group only emerged in August 2020.\nThe Coreid operators are believed to keep 10% to 25% of the profits of attacks, with the rest going to affiliates,\nso the malware developers themselves are estimated to have made approximately $15.5 million. Nevertheless, it\nis difficult to determine exactly how much money is made by ransomware actors, so the true figure may be even\nhigher.\n\nHowever, it appears the Colonial Pipeline attack may have been an attack too far for the group, with Darksupp, an\n[admin for the Coreid group, announcing on an underground forum on May 14 that the group had lost access to its](https://therecord.media/darkside-ransomware-gang-says-it-lost-control-of-its-servers-money-a-day-after-biden-threat/)\ndata leaks site, payment servers, and content delivery network (CDN) servers following law enforcement action in\nthe wake of the Colonial attack. This news came after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that countries harboring\nransomware networks must take action to shut them down. “We have been in direct communication with Moscow\nabout the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,” he said.\n\nThe group was paid $9.4 million in ransoms—from Colonial Pipeline ($4.4 million) and German chemical company\nBrenntag ($5 million)—in the weeks before it shut down, causing speculation that the group may have decided\nto cash out and keep those profits rather than sharing with affiliates. However, on June 7 it was announced that\n[authorities in the U.S. had recovered 63.7 of the 75 bitcoins Colonial had paid to Coreid. The Department of Justice](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-retrieves-millions-paid-to-colonial-pipeline-hackers-11623094399)\nsaid the FBI recovered the money after they gained access to one account’s private key.\n\nThere is no doubt the increased attention on the group following the Colonial attack put it under pressure, but\nwhether this is in fact the last we see of these ransomware actors remains to be seen.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Impact\n\nAs well as the obvious and immediate impact of this attack on Colonial itself, and the disruption to fuel supplies, the\nattack was also followed by some political pronouncements.\n\n[U.S. President Biden signed an executive order (EO) on May 12 aimed at modernizing U.S. defenses against cyber](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)\nattacks, and allowing more timely access to information needed for law enforcement to conduct investigations. The\n34-page EO followed several attacks targeting U.S. interests over the preceding few months, including the attack\n[on Colonial, and the SolarWinds supply chain attacks.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds)\n\nThe Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity called for a number of actions, including:\n\n  - Removing barriers to threat information sharing between government and the private sector\n\n  - Modernizing and implementing stronger cyber security standards in the federal government\n\n  - Improving software supply chain security\n\n  - Establishing a cyber security safety review board\n\n  - Creating a standard playbook for responding to cyber incidents\n\n  - Improving detection of cyber security incidents on federal government networks\n\n  - Improving investigative and remediation capabilities\n\nThe White House said the EO was the “the first of many ambitious steps the Administration is taking to modernize\nnational cyber defenses.”\n\n[In the wake of the Colonial attack, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security also issued a Security Directive](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/27/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators)\n[for the oil and gas pipeline industry. The Directive, which will be administered by the Transportation Security](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/27/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators)\nAdministration (TSA) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), was published on May 27, 2021,\nand replaced voluntary guidelines that had been in place for more than a decade.\n\nThe Directive requires critical pipeline owners and operators to report any confirmed or potential cyber security\nincidents to CISA. They are also required to have a designated cyber security coordinator who is available 24/7. The\nDirective also stipulated that pipeline owners and operators needed to review their practices to identify any gaps\nand related remediation measures, and report the results to TSA and CISA within 30 days. TSA said it would also\nconsider follow-on mandatory measures in the future that would “further support the pipeline industry in enhancing\nits cyber security.” When announcing the directive, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas\nreferenced the Colonial attack, stating: “The recent ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline demonstrates\nthat the cyber security of pipeline systems is critical to our homeland security.” He also said the DHS would work\nclosely with the private sector to “increase the resilience of our nation’s critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) also established a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force in the wake of\nthe attack, which it said was “established to investigate, disrupt and prosecute ransomware and digital extortion\n[activity.” The DoJ also said that ransomware incidents would be given a similar priority as investigations into acts of](https://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL2N2NC1SD)\n[terrorism.](https://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL2N2NC1SD)\n\n[The Colonial attack also had an impact outside of the U.S., with the South Korean government ordering a review of](https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/12/south_korea_security_review)\nthe cyber security preparedness of its energy infrastructure. South Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy,\nMoon Seung-wook, said that in the wake of the disruption at Colonial it was “necessary to thoroughly examine\nwhether cyber security preparations and countermeasures for our energy-related infrastructure are properly in\nplace.” He ordered all operators of oil pipelines, power grids, gas pipelines, and emergency response systems to\ncheck the status of their systems and report back on their findings.\n\n[The Japanese government also announced it would introduce new regulations for 14 critical infrastructure sectors](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-restrict-use-of-foreign-tech-in-telecom-power-grids)\nto bolster cyber defenses, in the wake of the Colonial attack. The sectors included areas like telecommunications,\nelectricity, railroads, government services, and healthcare. The government will require operators of such key\ninfrastructure to address national security concerns when procuring foreign-made equipment.\n\nThe wide-ranging impact of the Colonial attack is interesting. It appears to have raised awareness worldwide of\nthe dangers posed by potential cyber attacks on companies involved in CNI, and has led to authorities in the U.S.,\nparticularly, showing a determination to crack down on ransomware attackers to a degree we hadn’t previously seen.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Case Study: Concerted Attacks on CNI in South East Asia\n\n\n## Case Study: Concerted Attacks on CNI in South East Asia\n\n\nSymantec researchers observed attacks on a\nnumber of organizations that were part of the\nCNI sector in a South East Asian country. These\nattacks were ongoing since at least November\n2020, and continued right up to March 2021.\nIntelligence gathering was thought to be the\nlikely motivation in these attacks.\n\nVictims were seen in multiple organizations\nthat all fall under the umbrella of CNI, including\nin the areas of water, power, defense, and\ncommunications. There are some indications that\nthe attacker is based in China, but the activity\ncannot be attributed to any one particular group.\n\nThere are numerous indications that the attacks\non the different organizations were carried out by\nthe same attacker, including:\n\n  - The geographic and sector links of the\naffected organizations\n\n  - The presence of certain artifacts on\nmachines in the different organizations,\nincluding a downloader (found in two of the\norganizations), and a keylogger (found in\nthree of the organizations)\n\n  - The same IP address is also seen in attacks\non two of the organizations\n\nCredential theft and lateral movement on victim\nnetworks seemed to be a key aim of the attacker,\nwho made extensive use of living-off-the-land\ntools in this campaign. While we do not know\nwhat the initial infection vector used by the\nattacker to get onto targeted networks was, we do\nsee how they moved through infected networks.\n\n\nWater Company\n\nThe first activity we saw in the attack on this\norganization was suspicious use of Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI); there is no\nindication of what infection vector was used to\ngain initial access to the machine. A legitimate\nfree multimedia player called PotPlayer Mini was\nexploited by the attackers to load a malicious DLL.\n[FireEye has previously published research about](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/abusing-dll-misconfigurations.html)\nhow this player was susceptible to DLL search\norder hijacking. DLL search order hijacking is not\na new technique, but we do still see it frequently\nleveraged by attackers to insert malicious\nfiles onto victim machines. We saw PotPlayer\nMini added as a service to launch a file called\npotplayermini.exe, we then saw multiple dual-use\nand hacking tools launched, including:\n\n  - ProcDump\n\n  - PsExec\n\n  - Mimikatz\n\nProcDump was used for credential theft by\nabusing the LSASS.exe process, and domain\nshares were enumerated using net view. We\nthen observed a suspected tunneling tool being\nlaunched on the system. The machine targeted by\nthe attackers in this instance had tools on it that\nindicate it may have been involved in the design of\nSCADA systems.\n\nPower Company\n\nSimilar activity was seen in a company in the\npower sector. In that instance too, PotPlayer Mini\nwas exploited to carry out DLL search order\nhijacking and ProcDump was deployed alongside\nanother payload that we suspect was malware.\nWe also saw the attacker once again carrying out\ncredential theft by using ProcDump of the LSASS.\nexe process. There were indications here too\nthat this machine may also have been involved in\nengineering design.\n\nThere was some file overlap between the attacks\non both the water and power company as well as\nsimilar tactics used—pointing to the same actor\nbeing behind both events.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### What the Data Tells Us\n\nWhen we examine the malicious activity targeted at our CNI customers, it would appear that an increasing number\nof attackers are attempting to attack CNI organizations, but the number of attackers successfully gaining access\nand installing malware on the endpoint in this sector is trending down.\n\nNetwork-based detections indicate that malicious activity targeted at CNI organizations is on the rise. Attacks\nblocked on the network by our Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technologies help reveal information about the\nextent of malicious activity on organizations’ networks. If a machine on a network becomes infected, the malware is\nlikely to attempt to contact a command and control (C&C) server, which can also trigger these detections. Looking\nat the number of network detections attempting to contact a C&C server gives an indication of the number of\ninfected machines on a network and a picture of the extent of malicious activity in a sector.\n\nNetwork-based activity trended upwards over the time period we looked at, with an increase in June 2020 carrying\nthrough to February 2021. While these detections dropped slightly in March and April 2021, the overall trend is still\nincreasing.\n\nFigure 1: Malicious Activity Blocked on the Network by Month in CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n\n400,000\n\n200,000\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr\n2020 2021\n\nThe top 10 signatures blocked are primarily signatures that block attempts to exploit remote code execution (RCE)\nvulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute attacks on target organizations from wherever they are in the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Top 10 IPS Signatures Blocked on the Networks of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\nOS Attack: Microsoft SMB MS17-010 Disclosure Attempt\n\nAttack: SMB Double Pulsar Ping\n\nMalicious Site: Malicious Domain Request 22\n\nWeb Attack: Passwd File Download Attempt\n\nMalicious Site: Malicious Domain Request 21\n\nWeb Attack: Microsoft IIS 3 File Creation CVE-1999-0191\n\nAttack: Apache Struts CVE 2017 9805 2\n\nWeb Attack: ColdFusion Remote Code Exec CVE-2010-2861\n\nWeb Attack: Cisco RV320 & RV325 Routers CVE-2019-1653\n\nWeb Attack: Hylafax Faxsurvey Remote Password Access CVE-1999-0262\n\n.0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0\n\nBlocked IPS Signatures (Million)\n\nThe most commonly seen blocking signature—OS Attack: Microsoft SMB MS17-010 Disclosure Attempt—detects\nattempts to exploit a RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Windows SMB Service, which was famously used in the\n[disruptive WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wannacry-ransomware-attack)\n\nThe U.S. is the country that sees by far the most activity targeting the networks of CNI organizations, with it\naccounting for 10-times as many network blocks as Singapore and China—the countries in second and third position\nin the top 10. Despite the concentration of malicious activity on the network of CNI customers in the U.S., overall the\ntop 10 is a global picture, featuring countries from Europe and South America as well as Asia and the U.S.\n\nFigure 3: Top 10 Countries for Network Blocks on the Machines of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, in something of a contrast, reviewing the data for malware activity on the endpoint in the CNI sector\nsince the beginning of 2020 to April 2021 doesn’t reveal any particularly dramatic trends. Malware activity on the\nendpoint in the sector has remained reasonably steady in that time period. We saw something of a spike in May\n2020, but after that, activity returned to a fairly steady level, even declining slightly.\n\nFigure 4: Malware Detections by Month for CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n90,000\n\n80,000\n\n70,000\n\n60,000\n\n50,000\n\n40,000\n\n30,000\n\n20,000\n\n10,000\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr\n2020 2021\n\nWhen we look at the top 10 detections being triggered by CNI customers, a lot of those detections are heuristic\ndetections, which detect and block a wide range of different malware. This could include ransomware, crypto\nmining software, information stealers, or other backdoors that could give attackers a grip on the targeted network.\n\nFigure 5: Top 10 Malware Blocked on the Machines of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nChina and the U.S. were the countries where we saw the highest number of endpoint malware detections in the CNI\nsector, with those two countries combined accounting for 80% of the top 10 detections. However, the presence of\ncountries in other parts of Asia and also Europe in the top 10 does further demonstrate that malware attacks aimed\nat CNI are a global issue.\n\nFigure 6: Top 10 Countries for Malware Detections on the Machines of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n**Italy 2%**\n\n**Singapore 2%**\n\n**Indonesia 2%**\n\n**France 2%**\n\n**Germany 3%**\n\n**Great Britain 3%**\n\n**China**\n\n**South Korea 3%**\n\n48%\n\n**Brazil 3%**\n\n**U.S.**\n32%\n\n##### Ransomware\n\nRansomware activity aimed at organizations in the CNI sector remained reasonably steady over the period\nexamined, although there was a spike in May 2020, with ransomware numbers somewhat elevated for several of the\nmiddle months of 2020. While we did see a small drop in malicious activity in general at the very beginning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as threat actors presumably also adjusted to a new way of working and targeting victims, this\ndrop did not last long, and malicious activity did, in many cases, return to and even exceed pre-pandemic levels. It\nis possible the May spike was a return to activity for actors after a small decline in March and April.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Ransomware Detections by Month for CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n500\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr\n2020 2021\n\nWhile the ransomware numbers may not appear to be huge, ransomware attacks now are a lot more targeted,\nwith the days of mass spamming ransomware campaigns largely a thing of the past. Most ransomware groups\nthese days spend a long time planning attacks, potentially spending a long time on compromised systems carrying\nout reconnaissance and exfiltrating data before deploying ransomware. Due to the large paydays offered by\nransomware attacks now, malicious ransomware actors tend to carry out fewer attacks for greater rewards.\n\nFigure 8: Targeted Ransomware Detections by Month for CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the number of targeted ransomware attacks aimed at organizations in the CNI sector over the period we\nexamined may seem low—averaging at around two per month—just one attack every few weeks can easily give\nattackers the outcome they want. It should also be noted that the data shown in Figure 8 is only a representative\nsample of the overall number of attacks involving targeted ransomware. Most targeted ransomware operators\nrecompile their payloads for every new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack\nmay be blocked by a generic or machine learning-generated detection signature rather than a detection linked to\nthat ransomware family.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack demonstrated that just one ransomware attack on a key organization can lead to\nwide-ranging disruption, and potentially a big payday for attackers. JBS Foods, one of the world’s largest meat\n[producers, paid $11 million to the REvil ransomware gang on June 1, 2021, after a ransomware attack on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jbs-paid-11-million-to-revil-ransomware-225m-first-demanded/)\ncompany encrypted some of its operations in North America and Australia, leading to significant disruption. REvil\nhad also threatened to leak data it said it had stolen from the company.\n\nFor organizations that become infected with ransomware—particularly when they are in critical sectors like\nenergy, food production, or health—trying to balance the risks of not paying with the knowledge that paying\nonly encourages attackers to continue carrying out these kinds of attacks can be a difficult balancing act. An\norganization’s desire and sometimes need to avoid long-term disruption, and potentially recovery costs significantly\ngreater than the cost of paying a ransom, can lead to big paydays for ransomware criminals.\n\n##### Attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nIn 2021, malware detections tell only part of the malicious activity story, with the popularity of living-off-the-land\ntechniques among malicious actors these days meaning that a lot of malicious activity can occur without any\nmalicious tools being deployed. For this reason, Symantec Cloud Analytics doesn’t just detect malicious tools, but\nrather it draws on intelligence gathered from analyst investigations and leverages advanced machine learning to\n[identify and block patterns of suspicious activity. It then classifies all incidents with a MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) technique\n[name. With millions of incidents logged each year, it is possible to form a picture of what the most frequently used](https://attack.mitre.org/)\ntechniques are.\n\nFigure 9: Top 10 MITRE Techniques Used in Attacks Against CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nThe top 10 MITRE techniques used in attacks against CNI customers are familiar names that we frequently see\nleveraged by malicious actors in a wide range of attacks. PowerShell, for example, the technique we see leveraged\nmost often by attackers, is by far the most popular dual-use tool used by attackers. It is a powerful and versatile\ntool for malicious actors, but it is also widely used for legitimate purposes. Malicious usage still only accounts for a\nsmall percentage of overall PowerShell usage, meaning that attackers abusing it are often able to hide in plain sight\non victim machines.\n\nLiving-off-the-land techniques allow attackers to minimize malware usage, deploying it only when necessary and\nsometimes, as often in the case of ransomware, at such a late stage in the attack that the victim has little or no time\nto respond and stop the attack. The popularity of living-off-the-land tools for attackers is demonstrated in the\ncase study earlier in the paper, where the attackers made wide use of living-off-the-land tools and techniques in\ntheir attack chain.\n\nActivity like that is why having protection in place that can spot suspicious activity before malware is deployed is\nimportant for organizations striving to keep their networks safe.\n\n### Other Noteworthy Attacks on CNI\n\nWhile extremely high-profile, the attack on Colonial Pipeline was not the first impactful attack on CNI infrastructure\nwe have seen.\n\n##### Stuxnet and the Threat of “Cyber-Physical” Attacks\n\n[Probably one of the most famous cyber attacks to ever occur, the Stuxnet attack is believed to have begun in late](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument/stuxnet-05-disrupting-uranium-pro?CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n2007 when the digital weapon was deployed against centrifuges at a uranium enrichment plant. That attack was\ndiscovered and widely reported on in 2010. The immense sophistication of the attack meant that the presumption\nwas that a nation state was behind it, with the Stuxnet attack now widely believed to have been powered by a\ncyber weapon developed over the course of a number of years in a collaborative effort between the U.S. and Israel.\n\nStuxnet was the first example of a cyber attack having a physical impact, damaging, as it did, centrifuges at a\nnuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran. Stuxnet worked by modifying the centrifuge speeds, causing them to\nspeed up and become damaged or destroyed. The output at the nuclear plant was reported as dropping by a third\nduring the time it was infected with Stuxnet. Stuxnet was a highly targeted attack that was only ever intended to\ninfect the targeted networks but an error in the code meant it spread to a computer that had been connected to\nthe centrifuges and then made its way onto the internet to spread further. However, as Stuxnet was specifically\nprogrammed to target Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling programmable logic controllers (PLCs), it\ncaused little damage outside of the targeted networks.\n\nStuxnet showed for the first time in real life that it was possible for “cyber” attacks to cross over and become\n“physical” attacks with a real-world impact. The possibility of this occurring was—and remains—a major fear for\ngovernments and corporations worldwide. The sophistication of Stuxnet showed that, while not easy to execute, it\nwas possible to carry out attacks like this.\n\nFor a long time Stuxnet appeared to be an outlier, and we didn’t see another cyber attack causing physical\n[damage to infrastructure until 2014. Just before Christmas that year, a report was released revealing that hackers](https://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/)\n[had struck an unnamed steel mill in Germany. They manipulated and disrupted the control systems in the mill so](https://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/)\nmuch that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in what was described as “massive” damage.\nGermany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which issued the report about the incident, indicated that\nthe attackers gained access to the steel mill through the plant’s business network, then successively gained access\nto the production network, which allowed them to access systems controlling plant equipment. The attackers were\nbelieved to have gained initial access to the corporate network through a spear-phishing email. Once they had\nan initial foothold they were able to explore the company’s networks and eventually compromise a “multitude”\nof systems, including industrial components on the production network. The report said that as a result of this\nunauthorized access the plant was “unable to shut down a blast furnace in a regulated manner” which resulted in\n“massive damage to the system.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAuthorities in Germany did say at the time that the attackers appeared to possess knowledge of industrial control\nsystems, however, it is not clear if causing destructive physical damage to the steel mill was part of the attacker’s\nplan, or if the incident was collateral damage of their presence on the network.\n\nIf it was accidental, it demonstrates that it isn’t just extremely sophisticated attackers like those behind Stuxnet that\norganizations need to worry about causing physical damage. It is unlikely that all the malware used to infiltrate ICS\nand other networks will be as well designed as Stuxnet, leading to the possibility that incidents that lead to realworld damage could be unintentionally caused as collateral damage.\n\nWhile Stuxnet took elaborate steps in order to gain access to air-gapped networks, the attackers who targeted\nthe German steel mill appear to have been able to jump from the corporate network to the production side of the\nplant. Incidents like this serve to underline the importance of good cyber practices like network segmentation and\nZero Trust policies, so that if attackers compromise one part of your network they do not gain access to the entire\nsystem.\n\n##### Blackout: The Dangers of Power Grid Attacks\n\nThe attack on the Ukraine power grid took place on December 23, 2015, and was the first confirmed hack to bring\ndown a power grid. Such an attack had been long feared given the immense disruption such an outage could\ncause. That this attack took place in the depths of Europe’s winter underlined the seriousness of the situation, with\nthe average temperature in Ukraine in December often dipping below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius).\n\n[The attack on the Ukrainian power grid was very sophisticated, with the attackers thought to have been on the](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/)\npower grid systems for several months before they deployed the malware. The attack began with a spear-phishing\ncampaign targeting IT staff and system administrators working for multiple companies responsible for distributing\nelectricity throughout Ukraine. The email had an attachment that contained malicious macros; if this was opened\na malicious backdoor called BlackEnergy was downloaded onto the corporate network. However, this only gave\nhackers access to the corporate network, and it is understood that the targeted power distribution companies in\nUkraine did have network segmentation in place, with a firewall separating the corporate network from the SCADA\nnetwork that controlled the power grid. However, the attackers explored the corporate network, conducting\nreconnaissance and eventually gaining access to the Windows Domain Controllers, where they were able to harvest\nworker credentials for the VPNs used to remotely log in to the SCADA network. As workers logging remotely into\nthe SCADA network weren’t required to use multi-factor authentication, once the attackers had access to those\ncredentials they were able to log in to the SCADA network.\n\nThis shows the importance of having all the different facets of your organization’s cyber security strategy\nimplemented. While the power grid companies in Ukraine were doing the right thing by having their networks\nsegregated, the fact they didn’t have multi-factor authentication set up for all workers logging remotely into the\nSCADA network meant that attackers were ultimately able to overcome that hurdle to gain access to the SCADA\nnetwork anyway.\n\nOnce on the SCADA network, the attackers went to the trouble of replacing the legitimate firmware on Serial-toEthernet converters in order to prevent the operators from sending remote commands to re-close breakers once\na blackout occurred. They were then ready to carry out their attacks, opening circuit breakers to plunge tracts of\nUkraine into darkness. They also flooded the power companies’ customer call centers with phone calls to take them\noffline when customers wanted to contact them. The attackers also deployed a wiper malware called KillDisk to\nwipe files from operator stations to render them inoperable.\n\nUltimately in this incident, the attackers hit three power distribution centers, took around 60 substations offline,\nand left almost a quarter of a million Ukrainians in darkness. In this instance, authorities were able to get the lights\nturned back on quickly—with the longest outage lasting six hours—but the impact of the attacks were felt in the\npower distribution centers for several months as several actions could no longer be performed remotely. Given the\nskill levels of the actors in this attack and the access they achieved on the network, the consequences of this attack\ncould have been a lot more serious than they were, and it certainly served as a warning to power companies of the\nlevel of destruction attackers could deploy on power grids.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this attack occurred in a European country, and not the U.S., similar environments are likely to exist in U.S.\npower distribution centers, meaning the threat of such an attack is there wherever in the world your organization\n[may be located. While we have not yet seen U.S. electricity disrupted by a cyber attack, an AP investigation in](https://phys.org/news/2015-12-power-grid-vulnerable-foreign-hacks.html)\nthe same year the Ukraine attack took place showed that the U.S. power grid was certainly of interest to foreign\nadversaries, a fact that is unlikely to have changed in the last few years.\n\n##### Shamoon: Destructive Attacks Threaten Oil Industry in Middle East\n\n[The threat widely known as Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first appeared in 2012, when it was used in a targeted attack](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=281521ea-2d18-4bf9-9e88-8b1dc41cfdb6&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nagainst at least one organization in the energy sector in Saudi Arabia. Shamoon is notable because it is a wiper\nmalware that corrupts files on an infected machine and overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) in order to\nmake the computer unusable. Those deploying Shamoon appear to have destruction as their goal, as opposed to\nespionage or financial gain, the more common motives for cyber attacks.\n\n[Shamoon was seen again in 2016, when a slightly modified version of the malware was once again used in](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-back-destructive)\ndestructive attacks aimed at the Saudi energy sector. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their MBRs wiped\nand replaced with an image of a burning U.S. flag. The 2016 attacks instead used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi,\na three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015. The attacks appeared timed to\ncause maximum destruction. The malware was configured to trigger on Thursday night, local time, on November\n17, 2016. The Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped after most staff\nhad left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the attack was complete. It also appeared the\nattackers had done a significant amount of preparatory work for the operation, as the malware was configured with\ncredentials that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations, allowing it to move laterally across\nmachines on the network.\n\n[Shamoon reappeared again in 2018, again focusing on targets in the Middle East, with victims that time in the](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail)\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as Saudi Arabia. Once again, the victims operated in the oil and gas sector.\nHowever, these attacks were slightly different from prior incidents as they involved a new, second piece of wiping\nmalware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware would delete and overwrite files on the infected computer, while Shamoon\nitself erased the computer’s MBR. The addition of the Filerase malware made the attacks even more destructive as\ndeleting the files before erasing the MBR meant they could not be recovered.\n\nAlthough attacks involving destructive malware such as Shamoon are relatively rare, they can be highly disruptive\nfor the targeted organization, potentially knocking mission-critical computers offline and leading to the loss of\nimportant files. The fact that Shamoon seems to reappear every few years means that corporations, particularly any\nthat have operations in the Middle East, need to be aware of this threat and prepared, with comprehensive backups\nand a robust security strategy in place.\n\n[Shamoon attacks are believed to be associated with malicious actors operating out of Iran, with the attacks often](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tensions-iran-destructive-attacks)\ntending to coincide with periods of heightened instability in the region. The fact the attackers also seemed to have\nbeen evolving their attacks, with the addition of the Filerase malware in the most recent wave of attacks, should\nalso be a cause of heightened vigilance against attacks of this type.\n\nIranian hackers were also linked to an intrusion at the Bowman Avenue Dam, a small dam in New York State, in 2013.\n[Media reports said the hackers were believed to have gained access to the dam through a cellular modem. The](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iranian-hackers-infiltrated-new-york-dam-in-2013-1450662559)\nhackers reportedly didn’t take control of the dam but probed the system, possibly discovering information about\nhow the computers running the flood control system worked. This intrusion occurred in 2013, but information about\nit didn’t emerge until 2015. While no damage was caused during this attack, it serves to demonstrate the interest\nforeign adversaries have in U.S. critical infrastructure organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack underlined that ransomware, with its ability to shut down operations and cause\nsignificant business impact, can be just as disruptive a threat as the so-called “destructive” malware that we saw\n[deployed in, for example, the Shamoon and Stuxnet attacks. A recent Conti ransomware attack on the Irish Health](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977)\n[Service Executive (HSE), the country’s national healthcare service, also demonstrated how disruptive ransomware](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977)\nattacks can be. The attack on the HSE led to the cancellation of many services and major disruption, with\nauthorities there vowing not to pay a ransom and predicting it would take many weeks for the service to recover\nfrom the attack. Targeted ransomware attacks that also steal data and demand large ransoms are one of the\nbiggest cyber security threats for all sectors at the moment, and CNI is no exception.\n\nThe impact on the public that can be caused by cyber attacks on CNI industries, such as essential services being\nforced offline for a period, also means that attacks on organizations in this industry can be hard to keep from the\npublic and media, potentially leading to awkward questions and possible damage to businesses’ reputations.\n\nMeanwhile, a somewhat unique challenge faced by CNI is the effect cyber-physical attacks could have on the\nsector, with the prospect of attackers being able to destroy equipment or gain control of things like dams or\nelectricity substations a particular danger that this sector has to deal with.\n\nWe have seen companies in the CNI sector from the U.S. to Europe to the Middle East targeted with serious and\ndisruptive attacks, so there is no region in which CNI organizations can assume they are not under threat of a\nserious cyber attack. All these threats underline that organizations operating in this sector need to have a robust\ncyber security strategy in place in order to keep their networks, equipment, and customers, safe.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mitigation\n\nSymantec security experts recommend users observe the following best practices to protect their networks:\n\n  - Look to deploy an integrated cyber defense platform that shares threat data from endpoint, email, web, cloud\napps, and infrastructure.\n\n  - Ensure multi-factor authentication is enabled for all accounts using your network.\n\n  - Monitor the use of dual-use tools inside your network.\n\n  - Ensure you have the latest version of PowerShell and you have logging enabled.\n\n  - Restrict access to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services by only allowing RDP from specific known IP\naddresses.\n\n  - Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time\ncredentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.\n\n  - Ensure any legacy applications that are no longer in use are removed from all machines on your network so\nthey cannot be misused.\n\n  - Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally\nundetected through a network.\n\n  - Use application allow lists where applicable.\n\n  - Implement offline backups that are onsite. Make sure you have backups that are not connected to the\nnetwork to prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.\n\n  - Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business.\n\n  - Educate staff to ensure they understand cyber security principles and do not engage in any behaviors that\nmay put network security at risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Protection\n\n**How Symantec Solutions Can Help**\nThe Symantec Enterprise Business provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to address today’s\nsecurity challenges and protect data and digital infrastructure from multifaceted threats.
