It appears to be a novel two-step zero-click exploit, with each step targeting a\n_different process on the iPhone. The first step targets HomeKit, and the second step_\ntargets iMessage.\nNSO Group’s second 2022 zero-click (“FINDMYPWN”) was deployed against iOS 15\nbeginning in June 2022. It also appears to be a two-step exploit; the first step targets\nthe iPhone’s Find My feature, and the second step targets iMessage.\nWe shared forensic artifacts with Apple in October 2022, and additional forensic\nartifacts regarding PWNYOURHOME in January 2023, leading Apple to release\nseveral security improvements to HomeKit in [iOS 16.3.1](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT213635)\nOnce we had identified FINDMYPWN and PWNYOURHOME, we discovered traces of\nNSO Group’s first 2022 zero-click (“LATENTIMAGE”) on a single target’s phone. This\nexploit may also have involved the iPhone’s Find My feature, but is a different exploit\nchain than FINDMYPWN.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a brief period, targets that had enabled iOS 16 s Lockdown Mode feature received\nreal-time warnings when PWNYOURHOME exploitation was attempted against their\ndevices. Although NSO Group may have later devised a workaround for this real-time\nwarning, we have not seen PWNYOURHOME successfully used against any devices\non which Lockdown Mode is enabled.\n\n## 1. Targeting in Mexico\n\nThe Citizen Lab first gained forensic visibility into NSO Group’s 2022 zero-click exploits in\nOctober 2022 in the course of a joint investigation with Mexican NGO Red en Defensa de los\nDerechos Digitales (R3D). After examining several devices belonging to members of\nMexican civil society, we discovered FINDMYPWN, which helped us subsequently discover\n**_PWNYOURHOME and LATENTIMAGE within a broader target population (including outside_**\nMexico). Two Mexican civil society targets consented to be named in this report.\n\n### Extrajudicial Killings and Forced Disappearances\n\nMexico’s government and military have a long history of grave human rights abuses,\nextrajudicial killings, and disappearances. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Mexico\nexperienced the so-called “Dirty War” (“Guerra Sucia”), a conflict between the government\nruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), guerrilla groups, and left-wing student\n[movements. Between 1968 and 1982, an estimated 1,200 individuals were disappeared.](https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN08316698)\n\nIn 2022, the United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances and the Working Group\n[on Enforced and Voluntary Disappearances noted that there were now more than 100,000](https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/05/mexico-dark-landmark-100000-disappearances-reflects-pattern-impunity-un-experts)\nofficially registered disappearances in Mexico.\n\nOne widely publicized case of disappearances relevant to this case of spyware infection\noccurred in September 2015 when a group of 43 students at a teacher training college were\nforcibly disappeared after traveling to Iguala to protest teacher hiring practices. Their\nsubsequent disappearance is referred to as the “Iguala mass kidnapping,” or simply the\n“Ayotzinapa case.” In 2017, we reported that three members of the Mexican legal aid and\n[human rights organization, Centro PRODH, were targeted with Pegasus spyware, along with](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/mexico-disappearances-nso/)\n[investigators involved in the Ayotzinapa case. At the time of targeting, which was in 2016,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/)\nCentro PRODH was representing families of the disappeared students.\n\n### 2022 Targets: Human Rights Defenders\n\nOur research collaboration with R3D led to the identification of two human rights defenders\nworking at Centro PRODH whose devices were infected with Pegasus spyware. Both targets\nconsented to participate in a research study with the Citizen Lab and to be named in this\nreport. The timing of the infections on their devices corresponds to events of importance to\n\n\n-----\n\nthe activities of Centro PRODH, and suggests that the Pegasus operator may have been\nseeking to penetrate and perhaps blunt the impact of Centro PRODH’s work relating to\nhuman rights violations committed by the Mexican Army.\n\n**Figure 1: Human rights defenders in Mexico infected with Pegasus spyware.**\nOne infected device belongs to Jorge Santiago Aguirre Espinosa, the Director of Centro\nPRODH. Mr. Aguirre was previously identified as one of the Centro PRODH Pegasus targets\nby Citizen Lab in 2017, which found evidence of Pegasus infection attempts via text\nmessage on his device that he had been sent in 2016. In 2022, he was infected at least twice\nvia the FINDMYPWN exploit. The spyware was active on his device on June 22, 2022 and\n**July** **13, 2022.**\n\nOn June 22, 2022, the same date as the first infection of Mr. Aguirre’s phone, Mexico’s truth\ncommission investigating the Dirty War launched its activities in a ceremony at a Mexican\nmilitary camp where many of the abuses had taken place. Victims of human rights violations\nparticipated in the ceremony, including Alicia de los Ríos, who is represented by Centro\nPRODH. She is currently appealing to national and international bodies to seek justice for\nthe disappearance of her mother at the hands of the Mexican army.\n\nA second Centro PRODH staffer was infected the day after the ceremony. María Luisa\nAguilar Rodríguez, International Coordinator at Centro PRODH, was infected on June 23,\n**2022. Her work includes representing victims of human rights violations perpetrated by the**\nMexican army, including the Ayotzinapa case. She was subsequently infected twice more via\nthe FINDMYPWN exploit. The spyware was active on her device on September 24, 2022\nand September 29, 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe September 2022 Pegasus attacks coincided with several events in the Ayotzinapa case,\nin which Centro PRODH represents the families of the disappeared. This includes the\n[publication of a report by an international group of experts that questioned the authenticity of](https://centroprodh.org.mx/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/04.-Informe-IV.pdf)\nevidence published by the government, denounced the Mexican Army for refusing to\nsurrender key documents for the case, and called out governmental interference in the\ninvestigation.\n\nThe attacks also coincide with the cancellation of several arrest warrants against military\npersonnel involved in the Ayotzinapa case after pushback from the Mexican Army, and the\nresignation of the Special Prosecutor for the case who denounced interference by Mexico’s\nGeneral Prosecutor in his investigation.\n\n## 2. NSO Group Zero-Clicks Released in 2022\n\nIn 2022, while examining cases of suspected infections in Mexico, including the two cases\nnamed in this report, we found matches with four Pegasus indicators that we had seen in\n[previous infections between August and December 2021 using both FORCEDENTRY and](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/)\none-click attacks. Further analysis yielded additional indicators, which were then applied to\nanalyze additional devices in the global pool of 2022 Pegasus victims to uncover more\ndetails about NSO Group’s 2022 exploits.\n\nThese indicator overlaps allow us to attribute the 2022 zero-click chains to NSO Group’s\nPegasus spyware with high confidence. Overall, we believe NSO Group deployed at least\nthree zero-click chains in 2022 (Figure 2), exploiting a variety of apps and features on the\niPhone. We have observed cases of some of the chains deployed as zero-days against iOS\nversions 15.5 and 15.6 (FINDMYPWN), and 16.0.3 (PWNYOURHOME).\n\n**Figure 2: Three exploit chains released by NSO Group in 2022.**\nTo protect our continued ability to identify Pegasus infections, we are not releasing further\ndetails about these Pegasus indicators at this time as we continue to observe what we\ninterpret to be concerted efforts by NSO Group to evade detection by the methods deployed\nby researchers. For example, in contrast to previous versions of Pegasus, the versions\n\n\n-----\n\ndeployed in 2022 appear to more thoroughly remove data from various iPhone log files, in an\napparent attempt to thwart researchers from understanding the nature of the vulnerabilities\nexploited to compromise phones, and to evade detection.\n\nWe shared our observations of these exploit chains with Apple in October 2022 and in\nJanuary 2023. Targets we found in the 2022 target pool reported receiving notifications from\nApple in November and December 2022, and March 2023.\n\nIn the next sections, we review the three exploit chains in reverse chronological order.\n\n## 3. PWNYOURHOME: An iOS 15 and iOS 16 Zero-Click Exploit\n\nThe PWNYOURHOME exploit appears to be a novel two-phase zero-click exploit, with each\nof the two phases targeting a different process on the phone. The first phase of the exploit\ninvolves the HomeKit functionality built into iPhones (via the homed process), and the\nsecond phase of the exploit involves iMessage (via the MessagesBlastDoorService process).\n**_PWNYOURHOME appears to succeed against a target even if the target has never_**\nconfigured a “Home” inside HomeKit. However, in some cases, the email address of the\n**_PWNYOURHOME attacker is logged and Pegasus fails to delete this email from the_**\n_HomeKit database._\n\nWe obtained logs from multiple devices compromised with PWNYOURHOME. In one case,\nthe attacker’s email address ([REDACTED]@gmail.com) was logged. The phone logs\nshowed that the [REDACTED]@gmail.com email address was added to HomeKit\napproximately eight minutes before the Pegasus spyware was recorded running on the\nphone, and an iMessage attachment was deleted.\n\n### Phase One: HomeKit Daemon Crashes\n\nLogs from another PWNYOURHOME-exploited device from the 2022 global target pool\nexamined in the course of this investigation showed the homed process decoding what\nappears to be an unusual NSKeyedUnArchiver when it crashed. Logs showed that the\n_NSKeyedUnArchiver decoding had been kicked off by the following function:_\n```\n-[HMDHomeManager _handleHomeDataSync:] (in HomeKitDaemonLegacy)\n\n```\nThe NSKeyedUnArchiver decoder invoked the decoder for NSDictionary, which in turn\ninvoked the decoder for an implausible class not normally used within HomeKit. [Issues with](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/01/remote-iphone-exploitation-part-1.html)\n_NSKeyedUnArchiver deserialization have been used in past iOS zero-click exploits targeting_\niMessage, so we redact the specific class to avoid assisting attackers. We disclosed this\nissue to Apple, who made several changes to HomeKit in iOS 16.3.1, including adding a new\nmethod, -[HMDHomeManager _shouldDecodeMessage:error:], which declines to decode\ncertain HomeKit messages unless they arrive from a plausible source. This check guards the\n_HomeKit code path we saw exploited._\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phase Two: BlastDoor Crashes\n\nLogs from yet another PWNYOURHOME-exploited device from the 2022 target pool show\nthat, following the homed phase of PWNYOURHOME, the phone downloaded PNG images\nfrom iMessage. Processing these images caused crashes in the MessagesBlastDoorService\nprocess. These crashes give us glimpses of what the exploit was doing at various stages,\n[and suggest that the exploit may have circumvented pointer authentication codes (PAC) in](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication)\nsome cases by repurposing PAC-valid pointers already present in memory, such as signed\npointers to callback functions present in constant structs.\n\nThis is a well-known technique to circumvent PAC, and a mitigation exists in the form of\n_contexts, which include an additional salt value in the PAC to thwart repurposing of signed_\npointers. However, in practice, the context is often set to zero, as it may be nontrivial for the\ncompiler to automatically retrofit existing legacy code with a suitable context.\n\nWhen MessagesBlastDoorService crashed, it appeared to be processing (via ImageIO)\nApple MakerNote metadata included in a PNG image file. We have reconstructed a vignette\nof the exploit’s activity that seems to illustrate some gadgets it employs, though we have not\nyet fully identified the vulnerabilities exploited.\n\n**A CFTree‘s CopyDescription Method is Called**\n\nWhile deallocating various data structures as part of the _CGImageMetadataFinalize\nfunction, a series of events transpired, causing the CFCopyDescription method to be called\non a CFTree object. Somehow, the attackers had set this CFTree‘s copyDescription\ncallback function to be an unrelated function, “func1” (a name we assigned to the function in\nlieu of its real name, in order to avoid assisting attackers), in another framework within the\niOS shared cache.\n\nThe copyDescription callback is invoked using the blraaz instruction, which validates the\npointer’s PAC using a zero context. Because a pointer to func1 exists in a constant struct\nwithin the shared cache, a PAC-valid pointer with zero context is automatically generated at\na known offset in the shared cache after relocation, when the library is loaded.\n\n**A Gadget is Invoked**\n\nThe func1 function calls another function, “func2” (also a name we assigned in order to\navoid assisting attackers), in a loop that appears intended to execute five times, followed by\na sixth, final call.\n\nThe func2 function can be thought of as an “execute function with first argument” gadget.\nWithin the func2 function, there are two possible locations where branches can be made (via\nblraaz). The first location sets the first function argument (register x0) to a value read from\nmemory, and the second argument (register x1) to a fixed constant of 0xE7. The second call\n\n\n-----\n\nsets the first argument in the same way, but does not set register x1. The first call (and\nclobbering of x1) can be avoided if the pointer to the first function is null. The second call can\nbe avoided if the first function returns an integer not equal to one.\n\nBecause the attacker (presumably) controls the data in the CFTree, and because the\n**_CFTree‘s copyDescription callback gets a pointer to the CFTree‘s root node, the attacker_**\ncan craft the contents of the node to line up a series of additional gadgets (and first\narguments) to be executed, provided that PAC-valid (with context of zero) pointers to these\ngadgets are available.\n\n**Figure 3: Vignette of BlastDoor crash in PWNYOURHOME.**\nThe exploit could execute arbitrarily many gadgets by recursively invoking func1, though we\ncannot say for sure if the exploit does this or not. The loop will be broken if func2 takes the\nsecond call and the second call returns a value greater than 3.\n\nAnother function, func3, whose signed pointer is present in the same struct as the signed\npointer to func1, appears to be a loop around an “execute function with first two arguments”\ngadget.\n\n**A Possible Memory Copy Gadget**\n\nWe were not able to identify the full library of gadgets used by this exploit, but we did notice\nthat a particular memory copy gadget caused a segfault in the crash we observed. This\nmemory copy gadget, which takes two arguments, dereferences the first argument, and\nstores a 64-bit value comprising the bottom 32-bits of the value read (setting the top 32-bits\nto zero) at the location pointed to by the second argument. Since the memory offsets for the\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ldr and str instructions do not need to be doubleword aligned, with manipulation of x1 (via a_**\nseparate gadget), this gadget could be chained together to copy chunks of memory of\narbitrary size, with the caveat that a single zero word is copied to the end of the destination.\n\nThe crash showed that the first call within func2 had been made, thus supplying 0xE7 for the\nmemory copy gadget’s second argument. Because 0xE7 is not a valid memory address, the\ngadget caused MessagesBlastDoorService to crash. We redact specific details of the\nmemory copy gadget to avoid assisting attackers, but we note that a pointer to this memory\ncopy gadget is located within a constant struct within a library in the shared cache, thus\nensuring availability of a signed pointer to attackers who are able to read known offsets\nwithin the shared cache.\n\n[We are presently unsure how PWNYOURHOME escapes the BlastDoor sandbox. However,](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html)\nthe exploit ultimately launches Pegasus via mediaserverd.\n\n### Lockdown Mode Highlights Attack\n\nApple’s Lockdown Mode feature makes signs of an attempted PWNYOURHOME attack\nvisible to the phone’s user by displaying notifications (Figure 4). We have seen no recent\nnotifications on Lockdown Mode, nor have we seen any evidence of successful\n**_PWNYOURHOME compromise on Lockdown Mode. Given that we have seen no indications_**\nthat NSO has stopped deploying PWNYOURHOME, this suggests that NSO may have\nfigured out a way to correct the notification issue, such as by fingerprinting Lockdown Mode.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Illustration derived from victim screenshots illustrating how lockdown mode**\n**displayed notifications related to the PWNYOURHOME exploit**\nAdditionally, we have not seen any cases of exploitation of iOS versions 16.1 and greater,\nsuggesting that PWNYOURHOME may have been fixed or mitigated around this time.\n\n## 4. FINDMYPWN: An iOS 15 Zero-Day, Zero-Click Exploit\n\nWe also identified an earlier exploit, FINDMYPWN, deployed against iOS 15 as a zero-day,\nzero-click exploit. We believe that, like PWNYOURHOME, FINDMYPWN is also a two-phase\nexploit.\n\nIn FINDMYPWN, exploitation appears to begin with the fmfd process exiting and\nrelaunching. The fmfd process is associated with the iPhone’s built-in Find My functionality.\nWe were unable to determine the reason for fmfd exiting and relaunching. In several cases\nwe observed, FINDMYPWN apparently caused an item (which we suspect is the\n_unacceptedShares folder) to be written and then deleted inside a cache directory related to_\nthe Find My app.\n\nAfter fmfd exits and relaunches, phone logs indicate that MessageBlastDoorService is\nlaunched or relaunched, indicating that the phone was likely processing items received via\niMessage.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe did not obtain sufficient crash logs from FINDMYPWN victims to identify whether the\n_MessagesBlastDoorService activity was related to the PWNYOURHOME crashes, though_\nwe suspect that it is, as FINDMYPWN launches the Pegasus spyware via mediaserverd, just\nlike PWNYOURHOME.\n\n## 5. LATENTIMAGE: Traces of an Earlier Zero-Click Come to Light\n\nAfter we had characterized PWNYOURHOME and FINDMYPWN, we re-checked our\nforensic analysis for earlier cases, and found a case of a third, distinct iOS 15 zero-click\nexploit deployed in January 2022. We call the exploit LATENTIMAGE because it appears to\nleave very few traces on the device.\n\nThe LATENTIMAGE exploit could also involve the iPhone’s Find My feature, as fmfd exited\nand re-loaded during exploitation, though we were unable to determine if it was the initial\nvector.\n\nIn contrast to FINDMYPWN and PWNYOURHOME, the LATENTIMAGE exploit launches the\nPegasus spyware via springboard, indicating a different exploit chain. We identified a single\ncase of LATENTIMAGE used against a target on 17 January 2022, using iOS version 15.1.1,\nwhich was out-of-date at the time.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\n**NSO Group’s Evolving Attack Techniques**\n\nNSO Group’s Pegasus spyware remains a threat, and their attack techniques continue to\nevolve. PWNYOURHOME and FINDMYPWN are the first zero-click exploits we have\nobserved that makes use of two separate remote attack surfaces on the iPhone.\n\nThe use of multiple attack surfaces should encourage developers to think holistically about\ndevice security, and treat the entire surface reachable through a single identifier as a single\nsurface. For example, an attacker may be able to leak information or set up a framework in\none process, and use that information or framework to attack a second process.\n\nAlso, it is clear that modern exploit mitigations like pointer authentication codes (PAC)\nsignificantly reduce attacker freedom to execute arbitrary code on a device, but as\n**_PWNYOURHOME demonstrates, real-world attackers can (and do) find practical ways_**\naround these mitigations, such as by repurposing signed pointers located at known offsets in\nthe iOS shared cache. Further work should focus on improvements to legacy code to add\nmeaningful context values to safeguard these pointers.\n\nAs we noted in this report, NSO Group’s escalating efforts to block researchers and obscure\ntraces of infection, while still ultimately unsuccessful, underline the complex challenges of\nthese sorts of investigations, including balancing the publication of indicators while\n\n\n-----\n\nmaintaining the ability to identify future infections.\n\n**Mexico: A Serial Spyware Abuser**\n\n[The targeting of Mexican civil society with Pegasus spyware is but the latest in a long series](https://citizenlab.ca/tag/mexico/)\nof cases [dating back to 2016 which we and our partners, and other investigative teams](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\nincluding Amnesty Tech and the Pegasus Project collective, have uncovered in Mexico\nconcerning the abuse of commercial spyware.\n\nA first wave of abuse disclosures (2016-2019) showed widespread targeting of many sectors\nof Mexican civil society, which all took place during the presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto.\nAfter a change of government, the new President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose\n[intimate circle was among potential Pegasus targets, claimed that his administration stopped](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/fifty-people-close-mexico-president-amlo-among-potential-targets-nso-clients)\n[using Pegasus. However, recent reporting, and our collaborative investigations, suggest](https://citizenlab.ca/2022/10/new-pegasus-spyware-abuses-identified-in-mexico/)\n[otherwise.](https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/spyware-vendor-quadream-exploits-victims-customers/)\n\n[In March 2023, Mexican civil society groups published documents](https://ejercitoespia.r3d.mx/) [showing that the Mexican](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/world/americas/mexico-military-surveillance.html)\narmy used Pegasus to hack the device of Raymundo Ramos, a human rights defender\ninvestigating yet another massacre involving Mexican army personnel. In October 2022, the\n[Citizen Lab and R3D had reported that Ramos ‘ device was hacked with Pegasus during the](https://citizenlab.ca/2022/10/new-pegasus-spyware-abuses-identified-in-mexico/)\nsame time period in which those documents showed senior Mexican army officials receiving\na report summarizing Ramos ‘ private communications with investigative journalists.\n\nIt is particularly concerning that human rights defenders representing victims of human rights\nabuses, including families of the Ayotzinapa students, had their phones hacked with\n[Pegasus spyware. It is widely suspected that individuals connected to the Mexican army](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-crime-caribbean-arrests-city-51f83376f1efea86be65e4c5f58f5c2d)\nwere involved in those disappearances, and the subsequent cover-up that followed.\n\nAlthough we are not conclusively identifying a particular Pegasus operator at this time, the\ntargeting of human rights defenders representing victims of human rights violations in which\nthe Mexican military is involved, in addition to reports and evidence of military involvement in\nprevious recent Pegasus attacks, provides troubling circumstantial evidence suggestive of\ngovernmental involvement in these latest cases.\n\n**Recommendation: High-Risk Users, Give Lockdown Mode a Try**\n\nIt is encouraging to see that Apple’s Lockdown Mode notified targets of in-the-wild attacks.\nWhile any one security measure is unlikely to blunt all targeted spyware attacks, and security\nis a multi-faceted problem, we believe this case highlights the value of enabling this feature\nfor high-risk users that may be targeted because of who they are or what they do.\n\n[We highly encourage all at-risk users to enable Lockdown Mode on their Apple devices.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212650)\nWhile the feature comes with some usability cost, we believe that the cost may be\noutweighed by the increased cost incurred on attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank R3D for their invaluable logistical and investigative assistance with\nthese and [other recent cases, especially their director Luis Fernando Garcia.](https://citizenlab.ca/2022/10/new-pegasus-spyware-abuses-identified-in-mexico/)\n\n[We also thank Access Now, and especially their Digital Security Helpline for their ongoing](https://www.accessnow.org/help/)\ncollaboration and support in investigating the targeting of high-risk individuals with spyware.\n\nWe acknowledge additional collaborators and organizations that refer cases to us, and\nprovide additional investigative assistance.\n\nWe thank Siena Anstis, Adam Senft, Paolo Nigro H, and Alberto Fittarelli for review and\nediting.
