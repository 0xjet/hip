Lisp sourcecode files have the extension\nLSP and the compiled Lisp-scripts FAS. This program will decrypt the resource part of fas\nand fsl files (write it to disk) and disassemble the it. With help of the disassembling you can\n\n\n-----\n\nsee exactly :) what the program does, how thing are done and you can change some things\nwith help of a Hexeditor.\n\n### Keys:\n\nEnter, Space, double click on a line to jump to a offset that is in the Disasm Like \"Goto 0213\"\n\nBackspace, Num'-' to go back to old offset\n\n´(key beside Backspace), Num'+' to go forward\n\n### Getting FSL-Files\n\nAll internal lisp programs of Visuallisp are store in the resource section of vllib.dll (or vl.arx in\nAutocad LT). Use \"Resource Hacker\" or \"Exescope\" to dump these resources to disk and\nrename them to *.fsl.\n\n### FAS to LSP-Files\n\nThe data from the decompiler colum it written to some *_.lsp. However decompiler is far from\nbeing perfect. I really advice you to always also open the *.txt which contains all information.\n\n### Editing FAS-Files\n\nFor this purpose enable [HexWorkShop] and click some item. Fas-Dis will start\nHexWorkShop jump there in via sendkey. Sending keystrokes to another program is a little\nfragile. For best results place the HexWorkShop Window beside Fas-Dis's main window and\navoid overlapping. Also take care for possible editing the fas file by error. When asked to\n'Save changes'. Click NO! In HexWorkShop options enable 'Highlight changes' to better see\nunintented changes. Use HWorks UNDO to revert changes.\n\nWhen hexediting fas-files maybe this two commands come in handy:\n\nNo Operation Good for deleting (= Nop out) unwanted instructions Bytecode: 20h (Just\nSpace) [or 62 or 63] Parameters: none\n\nshort Jump to offset Good for jumping over unwanted instructions i.e. Fix Conditional Jump\n(=IF) Bytecode: 0Fh [57h for FAR Jump] Size: 3 Byte [5 Byte] Parameters: 1 Word 2 Bytes\n\n[Dword 4 Bytes] specify Bytes to Skip Example: '0F 0000' will point to the next instruction\nafter jmp\n\nWhen doing changes pay attention about the stack being embalenced. In case there are\nerrors after editing - Decompiled the edited Fas again to check/fix possible stack corruptions.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the moment there is no documentation file for fas-commands. To get more information\nabout the command please look at the function 'InterpretStream()' in FasFile.cls and learn\nfrom the fas-disassembling.\n\n## Some specifications about the Fas-format are here: http://files.planet-dl.org/cw2k/Fas%20AutoLisp-Decompiler/fas- format.htm\n\n Version history:\n\n0.11 Feb 2018\n\nimproved decompilation\n\nsupport for local vars\nstarted to manage/take care for types\nbranches cons, repeat\nadded inspector tool\ncolored output ( Each command and type has it's own color )\n\n0.10\n\nUploaded to Git-hub\nSome bugfix ( on reload content of *_.lsp was appended)\n\n0.9 Dez 2013\n\nSupport for 'AutoCAD PROTECTED LISP file' *.lsp\n\n0.8\n\nSupport for vlx-files (vlx-splitter)\nforward backward buttons for navigation add\n\n0.7\n\nopcodes names for fsl-disassembling improved\nadd loop recognition\ndecompilation column added\n\n0.6\n\nadded Quick jump function for Hexworkshop\nadded Case in sensitiv search Checkbox\n\n0.5\n\n\n-----\n\nFasCommand disassembling improved\nsmall bug's fixed\n\n0.4 Nov 2005\n\nFirst public Version\n\n0.3..0.1\n\ninternal alpha-version (based on AutoLisp Resource Decrypter V0.9)\n\n\n-----",
