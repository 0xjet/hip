The attack was of a degree of sophistication that led to a\nquick consensus of involvement by a foreign government, and was extraordinary in both the\namount of care taken in crafting it and the exotic vector of entry; instead of the usual phishing\nor even exploitation, the attackers carried out an elaborate supply chain attack. In this post,\nwe share a focused analysis of some choice features of the backdoor used (SUNBURST)\nand one of its payloads (TEARDROP), including an exhaustive deobfuscation of\nSUNBURST’s hashes encoding strings and an analysis of TEARDROP’s control flow and\ndecryption method; and we share our perspective on what these findings say about the\nattack and the people behind it, as well as what bearing this attack has on the future of\nnetwork security in general.\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nHere s a story you [might](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) [have](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/) [heard](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/) [already: Mr. Exemplary CISO wakes up early one](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/overview-of-recent-sunburst-targeted-attacks.html)\nmorning and goes to work as usual, a spring in his step and a bunch of one-time recovery\npasswords in his wallet that he never ever loses. He reaches the lobby, swipes his smart\ncard which performs an Adi-Shamir-Level challenge-response scheme, and walks past\nreception where shoulder-surfers are shot on sight. He boots up his laptop, types the BIOS\npassword which is three sentences from Moby Dick, presents his retina for scanning and\nwaits patiently as the mail exchange server remotely verifies the integrity of his laptop down\nto the network card circuit design. A spear-phishing email reaches 40 of his colleagues, all of\nwhom report the incident then delete the email without consciously registering the event.\nSomewhere on the third floor the signing certificate for a certain device driver expires, and\nthe offending server spontaneously combusts, as per protocol. Just when he thinks life can’t\nget any better, Mr. Exemplary CISO receives one of his favorite things in the world: A\nsoftware update notification. The updated DLL is signed with the right certificate, its hash had\nnever been seen before, it’s almost identical byte-for-byte to the one sent last version, its\nsandbox run produces no suspicious behavior; and so the update is installed, and Mr.\nExemplary CISO’s organization is, how goes the parlance, “pwned”, because the software\nsupplier’s production server was compromised — via social engineering, an unpatched 1-day\nvulnerability or the admin password being `password123, pick your favorite — and so a`\nsufficiently clever attacker could access that server and flawlessly arrange all the above.\n\nThere are so many ways that sufficiently clever attackers could make all our lives miserable,\nbut usually don’t, and this whole ordeal is a somber reminder of that. President of Microsoft,\nBrad Smith, [put it this way: “This is not ‘espionage as usual,’ even in the digital age [..] this is](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)\nnot just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of the world’s critical\ninfrastructure”. We’re not quite as eloquent and will just say that this isn’t the Sony hack and\nit can’t be dismissed with “don’t click update later, don’t click enable macros“. To deflect\nfuture attacks of this sort, defenders will have to get technical, get creative, and be willing to\nmake trade-offs that would have seemed wasteful and paranoid before. Somewhere, the\nauthor of your favorite banking Trojan just read this news, raised an eyebrow and said “hey,\nwill someone run me a port scan on `notepad-plus-plus.org “. Even if every vendor of`\nevery popular piece of software does become hyper-vigilant now, we all can’t get too\ncomplacent trusting in their hyper-vigilance. That’s what we mean by the threat of a “NetSec\nNew Normal”: an unsettling step into a future of zero trust.\n\n## SUNBURST and the Art of Tactical Retreat\n\nTechnical details of the SUNBURST backdoor are widely available now in greater abundance\nthan you will ever require, which puts us at liberty to focus on one feature that interests us\nand perhaps hasn’t been drilled into quite like the others: The backdoor’s elaborate evasion\nscheme.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The evasions employed by SUNBURST are similar in concept to sandbox evasions.](https://evasions.checkpoint.com/)\nSandbox evasions are engineered to make sure that the malware doesn’t run on virtual\nmachines designed to detect malware; SUNBURST’s evasions are engineered to make sure\nthat the malware doesn’t run on machines belonging to people who have thought of the word\n“malware” in the last thirty days. We’ve seen malware that includes blacklists of forensic\ntools, AV processes and such — but 1. Usually these blacklists were used to violently\nsmother these processes instead of opting not to run the malware at all; and 2. None of them\nwere half as comprehensive as this one. The list is an OCD-level of thorough and can be\nlegitimately used as a resource for reverse engineers to be acquainted with new tools (ever\n[heard of pdfstreamdumper? Well, you have now).](https://github.com/dzzie/pdfstreamdumper)\n\nIn-line with the overall theme of not wanting to be seen, this blacklist is not given in the form\n[of an array of readable strings. Rather, the readable strings are replaced with FNV-1a hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1_hash)\nvalues. This alone has been an occasional malware feature for years now (except the\nhipster-ish use of FNV-1a instead of SHA256, or even CRC32 checksums), but the feature\nthat really stands out here is the dedication to maintaining an illusion of code legitimacy even\nwhen under direct review. The below code literally attempts to use a Jedi mind trick on the\nreader: “This is not the malware you are looking for, move along”. The list of processes to\nblacklist is a “service list” belonging to the “Orion Improvement Business Layer”, and these\naren’t hash values of process names associated with AV engines — they are “timestamps”.\n\nThe authors weren’t satisfied with just blacklisting processes and services. They also made\nsure to blacklist some device drivers and entire ranges of IP addresses (by translating the\ninfected machine’s IP to a domain name and including domain names in the blacklist), a\n[feature that was used to blacklist all internal Solarwinds domains. This teaches us that not](https://twitter.com/megabeets_/status/1339308801112027138)\n\n\n-----\n\nonly the attackers decided to use Solarwinds as a Uber to get to their targets, they also\nlearned in-detail the topology of Solarwinds’ internal networks to evade the prying eyes of\nvigilant employees. In total, the list of hash-encoded strings embedded in SUNBURST is a\nparanoid manifesto of over 200 domains, providers and services that SUNBURST will just\nflatly refuse to deal with. [Mark Russinovich put it](https://www.markrussinovich.com/) [tersely, saying that the attackers are “afraid](https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1339611259524640769)\nof [sysinternals“. Which goes to show, even the most advanced and persistent of attackers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)\ndon’t believe themselves to be invincible — they believe in being just invincible enough, and\nabove all, in not tempting fate.\n\nThe full list of FNV-1a obfuscated strings included in SUNBURST is available in Addeneum I.\n\n## TEARDROP and Settling for the Ordinary\n\nThis attack was, no doubt, an incredible technical achievement on a large scale. Check Point\nThreatcloud telemetry shows over 250 organizations that were infected with the SolarWinds\nbackdoor, half of which are in the United States. The attackers dotted their i’s and crossed\ntheir t’s: they made sure to follow Solarwinds’ coding convention when pushing malicious\ncode; they included a “logic bomb” in their initial payload to delay malicious activity a full two\nweeks from initial infection, and fool dynamic analysis; they limited their lateral movement to\nlegitimate-seeming operations made with stolen, but valid, user credentials. For all these\nreasons, it’s noteworthy that this Übermensch-tier attack was used to deploy TEARDROP, a\nmerely human malware dropper.\n\nAt the time of discovery TEARDROP was a novel concoction: never-before-seen, possibly\neven tailor-made for this attack. It was only deployed against a select few targets. If you’re\neager to feel its bits and bytes, there’s hashes courtesy of [Talos and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/12/solarwinds-supplychain-coverage.html) [Sophos, as well as](https://github.com/sophos-cybersecurity/solarwinds-threathunt/blob/master/iocs.csv)\n[YARA rules by FireEye. TEARDROP runs in-memory but it does register a Windows service,](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/tree/main/rules/TEARDROP/yara)\nwhich involves editing the registry.\n\nTEARDROP’s control flow is straightforward. One of the DLL exported functions,\n```\nTk_CreateImageType, is called during the service’s execution. This function writes a JPEG\n\n```\nimage to the current directory, the name of which varies; [Symantec reports having come](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sunburst-supply-chain-attack-solarwinds)\nacross `upbeat_anxiety.jpg and` `festive_computer.jpg, and FireEye has seen a`\n```\ngracious_truth.jpg . To the untrained eye, these might seem to have been named by a\n\n```\npoet; but more likely the image name is randomly generated by concatenating two words\nfrom a hard-coded word list that’s out there somewhere, on whatever machine was used to\ncompile this piece of malware.\n\nTEARDROP then performs decryption using a homebrew cipher and a hardcoded key of\nlength `0x96 . The process is implemented using the following gem of disassembly:`\n\n\n-----\n\nAt a high level, this reads like some sort of homebrew PRNG deciding which key byte to use\neach time, except the more you attempt to follow the actual process, the less sense it makes.\nAmazingly, when run dynamically, via some dark magic the generated key indexes simply\nmap to `0, 1, 2, ..., 149, 0, 1, ... and so on; that’s some new level of “pseudo” in`\n“pseudo-random”! As it turns out, this isn’t a PRNG — it’s a compiler-optimized\n[implementation of the modulo operation. Feast your eyes on its underlying reasoning, which](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1397/how-can-i-reverse-optimized-integer-division-modulo-by-constant-operations)\n[is somewhat reminiscent of the Quake Fast Inverse Square Root Hack. If anything, this is](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-quakes-fast-inverse-square-root/)\nmainly a testament to the power of dynamic analysis if we ever saw it. You weren’t going to\nstatically reverse-engineer that. (Alternatively, it is a testament to the power of hex-rays\ndecompiler, which sees through it immediately).\n\nOnce the optimization is understood, the decryption code is equivalent to the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nCTXT_START_OFFSET 0x30\nKEY_LENGTH = 0x96\nPREV_CTXT_BYTE_INITIAL_DEFAULT = 0xcc\nprev_ctxt_byte = PREV_CTXT_BYTE_INITIAL_DEFAULT\nfor i, ctxt_byte in enumerate(ciphertext[CTXT_START_OFFSET:]):\n     ptxt_byte = ctxt_byte ^ (prev_ctxt_byte ^ key[i % KEY_LENGTH]) \n     plaintext[i] = ptxt_byte\n     prev_ctxt_byte = ctxt_byte\n\n```\nSo, the original encryption was a simple rotating XOR, followed by also XORing every\nciphertext byte with the previous ciphertext byte. There’s probably no purer distillation than\nthis of “homebrew cipher thrown together in five minutes for a piece of malware”. This is a\n[perfectly good obfuscation scheme, mind you, but for the thousandth time, there is no reason](https://youtu.be/loy84K3AJ5Q?t=121)\nfor that extra XOR to be there. No one is randomly launching the Kasiski attack against inmemory binary blobs in hopes of encountering rotating XOR ciphertexts.\n\nThe decrypted payload has the following custom header format, which reads like the tl;dr of a\nproper PE header:\n\nAnd here’s a taste of the payload code itself. The First image shows the code of the\ndecrypted BEACON payload found on TEARDROP while the second image shows the code\nof a known BEACON sample we picked randomly. We won’t fault you for not being able to\nfind the differences between this picture and that picture. Even the PE base address is the\nsame.\n\n\n-----\n\nTEARDROP’s BEACON payload\n\n\n-----\n\nCobalt Strike’s BEACON\n\n(sha256: 3cfbf519913d703a802423e6e3fb734abf8297971caccc7ae45df172196b6e84)\nThe way TEARDROP is built, it could have dropped anything; in this case, it dropped\nBEACON, a payload included with Cobalt Strike (a “penetration testing” tool based on the\nwell-known Metasploit framework). According to the Cobalt Strike website, BEACON’s\npurpose is to model advanced attackers. It supports network lateral movement across a\nvariety of protocols, “passive” and “active” modes for C2 check-in, and a configurable C2\ncommunication scheme that can be made to imitate other malware or blend in with the target\nnetwork’s legitimate traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis really bears consideration. These attackers were riding on the tail of a network breach\nof almost unprecedented sophistication, and now they had to pick their weapon of choice for\nconducting lateral movement and data exfiltration. Armed with boundless ambition and\nabundant resources, they looked over their options and picked… Cobalt Strike? Even Dton,\n[the Nigerian hustler who was covered here earlier this year and objectively ranks in the top](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/the-inside-scoop-on-a-six-figure-nigerian-fraud-campaign/)\n50 of least competent cybercriminals of all time, had an intuition that using well-known\ncommodity malware will cost him in detection rates. We can’t argue with success, and this\ndecision clearly paid off for the attackers, but we’re sure curious about the reasoning behind\nit. Possibly it was meant to make attribution harder, and we can’t rule out the use of highertier payloads for higher-tier targets.\n\n## Conclusion: Where to from here?\n\nIf we had to pick one actionable pithy phrase in the wake of this breach, it would be “Defense\nin Depth”. It seems like a cliché that has been with us since forever ago, but it apparently\n[originates with a 2012 paper by the NSA, and the principle behind it is sound and relevant:](https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/library/ia-guidance/archive/defense-in-depth.cfm)\ndon’t spend all your energy building a single wall. There are no perfect walls, and someday,\nsomeone is going to get through to the other side. When configuring a component, imagine\nan ongoing attack that is within reach of it now — what will help secure the component? Or\nan attack that has compromised the component already — how best to pre-empt the attack\nfrom propagating further? A lot of principles and practices go into this; the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, to name one.\n\nWe’re not Naïve: organizations want to Get Stuff Done, and the incentives they set effectively\nmandate a Principle of Most Privilege. Employees the world over are constantly demanding,\n“Just let me do this thing! Don’t make me do something ‘more secure’ that’s 4 times as\ncomplicated!”. Even as we rush to zealously Secure Everything, these concerns should be\n[taken seriously. We couldn’t put it better than Avi Douglen has: “how often does strict](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase?newsletter=1&nlcode=390222%7c5068)\npassword complexity policy enforced by IT [..] result in the user writing down his password,\nand taping it to his screen? That is a direct result of focusing too much on the computer\naspect, at the expense of the human aspect. [..] Security at the expense of usability comes at\nthe expense of security.”\n\nLooking at the binaries for SUNBURST and TEARDROP, we’ve learned that even this wildly\nsuccessful operation had its rough edges. Far from a worry-free power trip, the attackers\nwere wary all the while of having their activity seen at all, never mind recognized for what it\nwas; extensive blacklists of domains and processes had to be created to make sure of that.\nWe’ve learned that even a campaign on this level will not consist purely of ingenuous rabbitpulls, textbook solutions and tour-de-forces; even while pulling off an astounding network\nsecurity coup like this, at some points an actor will say “eh, it’ll do” and reach for the olereliable forgettable loader, rotating XOR encryption and used-to-death commodity tool.\nThere’s something comforting about that; the attackers won this round, but maybe the game\nin general is not so hopeless — if defenders step up.\n\n\n-----\n\n[For full technical details on our
