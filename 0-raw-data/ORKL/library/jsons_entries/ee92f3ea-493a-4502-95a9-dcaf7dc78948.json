Recorded Future’s Insikt\nGroup identified overlaps with a threat actor tracked by other companies as Callisto Group,\nCOLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM.\n\n“TAG-53 infrastructure was uncovered by analyzing specific combinations of domain\nregistrars, autonomous systems, domain name structures, and related TLS certificates,” the\nresearchers write. “Based on this information, it is highly likely that this threat group is\ncontinuing its phishing and credential-harvesting operations. While monitoring TAG-53\ninfrastructure, Insikt Group observed a spoofed Microsoft login page masquerading as a\nlegitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the US, suggesting that some TAG-53\ninfrastructure has likely already been operationalized.”\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future isn t sure if the impersonated entities are the specific targets of the\noperation, but the researchers note that most of these organizations “share a focus around\nindustry verticals that would likely be of interest to Russia-nexus threat groups, especially in\nlight of the war in Ukraine.”\n\n“The TAG-53 domain “drive-globalordnance[.]com” includes a spoofed sign-in page for the\nlegitimate company Global Ordnance, a military weapons and hardware supplier in the US,”\nthe researchers write. “The spoofed sign-in page…uses Global Ordnance branding and is\nsuspected to be used for follow-on credential harvesting after a target has been phished. It is\nunclear whether Global Ordnance is the intended target of this attempted credential\nharvesting operation or whether TAG-53 is using a Global Ordnance-styled domain and\nspoofed sign-in page to masquerade as a legitimate entity to target victims.”\n\nOther impersonated entities included Polish defense company UMO Poland, the nonprofit\nCommission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), US-based satellite\ncommunications company Blue Sky Network, logistics company DTGruelle, and Russia’s\nMinistry of Internal Affairs.\n\n[New-school security awareness training can enable your employees to thwart social](https://www.knowbe4.com/products/kevin-mitnick-security-awareness-training/)\nengineering attacks.\n\n[The Record has the story.](https://therecord.media/russian-hacking-group-spoofed-microsoft-login-page-of-us-military-supplier-report/)\n\n[Return To KnowBe4 Security Blog](https://blog.knowbe4.com/)\n\n## Free Phishing Security Test\n\nWould your users fall for convincing phishing attacks?
