Multiple individuals involved in Middle Eastern\npolitical affairs research [tweeted that than an individual claiming to work for the U.S. Atlantic](https://twitter.com/_RDadpur_/status/1628733517785075712)\nCouncil think tank had contacted them about contributing to an Atlantic Council report in\n[progress. This individual used the name Sara Shokouhi and the @SaShokouhi (archived)](https://twitter.com/SaShokouhi)\nTwitter account (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Twitter profile for Sara Shokouhi (@SaShokouhi). (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn these solicitations, the SaShokouhi persona claimed to work with Holly Dagres, an Atlantic\nCouncil Senior Fellow. Dagres has publicly denied working with Shokouhi (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Holly Dagres publicly denying that Sara Shokouhi is a colleague. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nCTU™ researchers discovered that the individual in these photos is not Sara Shokouhi. The\nimage belongs to a psychologist and tarot card reader based in Russia. The threat group\nresponsible for the fake Sara Shokouhi persona stole these images from an Instagram\naccount (see Figure 3) and used them as the basis for the SaShokouhi Twitter account and a\ncorresponding Instagram account (@sarashokouhii). The fake Instagram profile claims\nShokouhi was studying for or holds a “PhD in Middle East Polotics [sic]”.\n\n_Figure 3.

(Source: Secureworks)_\n\n[Multiple hallmarks of this activity suggest involvement of the Iranian COBALT ILLUSION](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/cobalt-illusion)\nthreat group (also known as Charming Kitten, APT42, Phosphorous, TA453, and Yellow\nGaruda), which is suspected of operating on behalf of the Intelligence Organization of the\n\n\n-----\n\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC-IO) in Iran. COBALT ILLUSION targets a wide\nrange of individuals and is particularly interested in academics, journalists, human rights\ndefenders, political activists, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs) that focus on Iran. The threat actors create a fake persona and then\nuse it to contact a target with a request for an interview, assistance on a report, or to discuss\na shared interest. Over a period of days or weeks, COBALT ILLUSION develops a rapport\nwith the target and then attempts to phish credentials or deploy malware to the target's\ncomputer or mobile device. The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued an\n[advisory in January that included details of COBALT ILLUSION spearphishing activity.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC_Advisory-SEABORGIUM-and-TA453.pdf)\n\nThis would not be the first time the threat actors masqueraded as Atlantic Council\nemployees. In September 2022, CERTFA [identified numerous real individuals that COBALT](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-can-we-wave-a-meeting/)\nILLUSION impersonated, including an Atlantic Council employee. In that campaign, the\ngroup attempted to engage targets in video calls and delivered phishing links via the chat\nfunction at an appropriate point in the conversation.\n\nThe @SaShokouhi account has been operating since October 2022. It tweets or retweets\n[posts supportive of the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran. To appear sympathetic to the](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/oct/31/mapping-irans-unrest-how-mahsa-aminis-death-led-to-nationwide-protests)\nprotestors' interests and demands, the account owner has posted cynical content such as\nimages of dead children, physical abuse suffered by protesters, anti-Iranian government\ncommentary, and anti-Iranian symbolism.\n\n[CERTFA Lab reported a set of phishing indicators related to this suspicious activity. As of this](https://twitter.com/certfalab/status/1629083616268394496)\npublication, CTU researchers cannot independently verify an association between the\nCERTFA indicators and the @SaShokouhi account. However, these indicators align with\npatterns observed in past COBALT ILLUSION activity.\n\nMultiple targets reported that the SaShokouhi persona engaged them in discussion (see\nFigure 4). The interactions included requests to visit multiple links.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Twitter user reporting that SaShokouhi had contacted them. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIt is common for COBALT ILLUSION to interact with its targets multiple times over different\nmessaging platforms. The threat actors first send benign links and documents to build\nrapport. They then send a malicious link or document to phish credentials for systems that\nCOBALT ILLUSION seeks to access. These systems include online email services, social\nmedia services, and other systems used by the target.\n\nPhishing and bulk data collection are core tactics of COBALT ILLUSION operations. In\nAugust 2022, Human Rights Watch [reported that COBALT ILLUSION targeted their staff and](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/05/iran-state-backed-hacking-activists-journalists-politicians)\n[obtained user credentials. The threat actors then used the Google Takeout service to export](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Takeout)\ndata from the various services associated with the compromised account, including email,\ncloud data storage, and contacts. This information could feed into additional rounds of\nphishing attacks, targeting users of interest who have had contact with the initial victim. In\nDecember 2021, the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) [reported on COBALT ILLUSION's](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-iranian-apt-data-extraction-tool/)\nuse of the custom HYPERSCRAPE (also known as EmailDownloader) tool to steal user data\n[from Gmail, Yahoo, and Microsoft accounts. PwC identified a similar tool called](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/old-cat-new-tricks.html)\nTelegramGrabber that enabled bulk data collection from Telegram accounts after the threat\nactor had obtained the victim's credentials. Data stolen from victims' accounts could be used\nto inform intelligence priorities for the IRGC-IO and other COBALT ILLUSION customers.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1.
