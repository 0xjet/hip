It translates to “hide in plain sight” or “mask your true goals”.\n\n\n-----\n\nAndroid banking trojan actors have taken this stratagem to heart and have been very adaptable over years to new Google Play app\nstore restrictions introduced to limit their operations. These restrictions include setting limitations on the use of certain (dangerous)\napp permissions, which play a big role in distributing or automating malware tactics.\n\n[In this blog we will discuss the recent techniques used to spread Android banking trojans via Google Play (MITRE T1475) resulting in](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1475/)\nsignificant financial loss for targeted banks. We will also discuss the, sometimes forgotten, by-product of collecting contacts and\nkeystrokes by Banking trojans, resulting in severe data leakage.\n\n## Tactics used by threat actors\n\nWhat makes these Google Play distribution campaigns very difficult to detect from an automation (sandbox) and machine learning\nperspective is that dropper apps all have a very small malicious footprint. This small footprint is a (direct) consequence of the\npermission restrictions enforced by Google Play.\n\n[A good example is the modification introduced on November 13th, 2021 by Google, which limits the use of the Accessibility Services,](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491)\nwhich was abused by earlier dropper campaigns to automate and install apps without user consent.\n\nThis policing by Google has forced actors to find ways to significantly reduce the footprint of dropper apps. Besides improved\nmalware code efforts, Google Play distribution campaigns are also more refined than previous campaigns. For example, by\nintroducing carefully planned small malicious code updates over a longer period in Google Play, as well as sporting a dropper C2\nbackend to fully match the theme of the dropper app (for example a working Fitness website for a workout focused app).\n\nTo make themselves even more difficult to detect, the actors behind these dropper apps only manually activate the installation of the\nbanking trojan on an infected device in case they desire more victims in a specific region of the world. This makes automated\ndetection a much harder strategy to adopt by any organization.\n\nVirusTotal does not showcase the evolution of detections of antivirus products over time, but almost all campaigns have or had a 0/62\nFUD score on VirusTotal at some point in time, confirming the difficulty of detecting dropper apps with a minimal footprint.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Families and statistics\n\nIn the paragraphs below we outline the Modus Operandi (MO) of each of the families distributed recently via Google Play. Each of\n[these families has its own banking apps target list, which can be found in the Appendix.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/google-play-droppers.html#appendix-targeted-apps)\n\n## Anatsa campaign\n\nDuring the research dedicated to the distribution techniques of different malware families, our analysts found numerous droppers\nlocated in Google Play, designed to distribute specifically the banking trojan Anatsa. Anatsa was discovered by ThreatFabric in\nJanuary 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnatsa is a rather advanced Android banking trojan with RAT and semi ATS capabilities. It can also perform classic overlay attacks in\norder to steal credentials, accessibility logging (capturing everything shown on the user’s screen), and keylogging. Previously\n[ThreatFabric reported cases when Anatsa was distributed side-by-side with Cabassous in smishing campaigns all over Europe. Our](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/smishing-campaign-in-nl-spreading-cabassous-and-anatsa.html)\nlatest findings show that Anatsa now utilizes Google Play dropper apps.\n\n**Thousands of victims**\n\nWe discovered the first dropper in June 2021 masquerading as an app for scanning documents. In total, ThreatFabric analysts were\nable to identify 6 Anatsa droppers published in Google Play since June 2021.\n\nThese apps posed as QR code scanners, PDF scanners, and cryptocurrency apps. One dropper app was installed more than 50.000\ntimes, with the combined total of installations of all droppers reaching more than 100.000 installations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe process of infection with Anatsa looks like this: upon the start of installation from Google Play, the user is forced to update the\napp in order to continue using the app. In this moment, Anatsa payload is downloaded from the C2 server(s), and installed on the\ndevice of the unsuspecting victim.\n\nActors behind it took care of making their apps look legitimate and useful. There are large numbers of positive reviews for the apps.\nThe number of installations and presence of reviews may convince Android users to install the app. Moreover, these apps indeed\npossess the claimed functionality, after installation they do operate normally and further convince victim in their legitimacy.\n\nDespite the overwhelming number of installations, not every device that has these droppers installed will receive Anatsa, as the\nactors made efforts to target only regions of their interest. We will cover this and other technical details in the next section.\n\n**Technical details**\n\nAll Anatsa droppers look similar code-wise. Upon the start of the app, a service is started to check if the “update” was installed. The\ndropper makes a request towards the C2 sending information about the device, including device ID, device name, locale, country,\nAndroid SDK version.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned previously, not every device will receive the “update”. At this point, the C2 backend decides whether to provide the\nAnatsa payload or not based on the device information. Depending on the C2 response, the dropper will decide whether or not to\ndownload Anatsa.\n\nSuch approach allows actors to target devices from specific regions and easily switch focus to another area. This behavior is in line\nwith Anatsa moving from region to region, constantly updating its list of targeted financial institutions. Moreover, filtering allows\ncybercriminals to prevent the dropper from downloading the “update” during the evaluation process when publishing the app on\nGoogle Play.\n\nOur analysts have identified Anatsa droppers that initially (in their first versions published on Google Play) had no malicious\nfunctionality but modified their behavior in later versions adding the dropping functionality and a wider set of permissions required\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen all conditions are met and the payload is ready, the user will be prompted to download and install it.\n\nAfter successfully downloading the “update”, the user will be asked for the permission to install apps from unknown sources. The\nuser, previously convinced that the update is necessary for the app to work properly, grants the permission. After the installation is\ncomplete, Anatsa is running on the device and immediately asks the victim to grant Accessibility Service privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter enabling Accessibility Service, Anatsa has full control over the device and can perform actions on the victim’s behalf. At the\nsame time, the dropper app is also running and operating as a legitimate app, the victim will probably remain unsuspecting.\n\n## Hydra and Ermac campaign\n\n**Brunhilda : The return of the Valkyrie**\n\nThreatFabric identified multiple instances of malware dropped by the Brunhilda threat actor group, and in line with previous\ncampaigns, it constituted of trojanized apps. Brunhilda was observed dropping different malware families.\n\nIn the first case, we observed Brunhilda posing as a QR code creator app, Brunhilda dropped samples from established families, like\n[Hydra, as well as novel ones, like Ermac.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/bianlian_from_rags_to_riches_the_malware_dropper_that_had_a_dream.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe apps dropped by this Brunhilda campaign do not differ in functioning too much from the previous versions we have observed\nduring 2021. As it did in the previous iterations, Brunhilda sends a registration request to its C2 using the gRPC protocol. Upon\nsuccessful registration, and after communicating more detailed information about the device, the dropper is instructed by the C2 to\ndownload and install the payload package.\n\nBoth families have been very active in the last months, even adventuring to markets that were previously untapped, like the United\nStates. This new wave of malware, which started in August 2021, includes also other families like Gustuff and Anatsa.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Alien campaign\n\nAs mentioned before, ThreatFabric observed Brunhilda serving different malware families. Some samples were observed having\n[more than 50.000+ installations, and dropping the android trojan Alien.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/alien_the_story_of_cerberus_demise.html)\n\n[Also in this case, as it happened with the deployment of Vultur, these aps reached thousands of downloads before being taken down](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/vultur-v-for-vnc.html)\nfrom the store. The samples were very successful in their operation, with samples ranging from 5.000+ downloads to the impressive\nvalues of 50.000+ downloads. With these numbers in mind, it is fair to say that this dropper family was likely able to infect hundreds of\nthousands of victims during its operation.\n\n**Gymdrop : a Gym you do not want to visit**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn November 2021 ThreatFabric analysts discovered yet another dropper in Google Play. It had 10.000 installations and\nmasquerades as an app for self-training.\n\nThis dropper, that we dubbed “Gymdrop”, is another example of how cybercriminals try to convince victims and detection systems\nthat their app is legitimate. The app website is designed to look legitimate at first glance. However, it is only a template for a gym\nwebsite with no useful information on it, even still containing ‘Lorem Ipsum’ placeholder text in its pages.\n\nThe developer website also serves as C2 for Gymdrop. Just like previously observed, this dropper tried to convince victims to install a\nfake update. However, in this case, it is done in a more inventive way: the payload is posed as a new package of workout exercises in\nconformity with the app. After the user clicks “OK”, the dropper will request the permissions needed.\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after the dropper gets its configuration from the C2. The configuration file contains the link to download the payload.\nMoreover, the configuration contains filter rules based on device model. Based on the models being filtered out and the code of the\ndropper, we can draw a conclusion that this is done to avoid downloading the payload on emulators or research environment.\n\nIf all conditions are met, the payload will be downloaded and installed. This dropper also does not request Accessibility Service\nprivileges, it just requests permission to install packages, spiced with the promise to install new workout exercises - to entice the user\nto grant this permission. When installed, the payload is launched. Our threat intelligence shows that at the moment this dropper is\nused to distribute Alien banking trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile writing this blog post, Gymdrop was updated (a new version was uploaded to Google Play). However, the configuration file was\nnot found on C2. It could probably be done to not serve the payload to pass security checks performed by Google before publishing\nthe update on Google Play.\n\n**2 dropper APPS to boost botnet-building**\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the Alien samples of this campaign connect to the same C2 as samples from previously described\ncampaign powered by Brunhilda dropper.\n\nThis leads us to the conclusion that the actor(s) behind these Alien campaigns use at least 2 different dropper services in their\ndistribution strategy.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the span of only 4 months, 4 large Android families were spread via Google Play, resulting in 300.000+ infections via multiple\ndropper apps.\n\nA noticeable trend in the new dropper campaigns is that actors are focusing on loaders with a reduced malicious footprint in Google\nPlay, considerably increasing the difficulties in detecting them with automation and machine learning techniques.\n\nThe small malicious footprint is a result of the new Google Play restrictions (current and planned) to put limitations on the use of\nprivacy concerning app permissions. Permissions such as Accessibility Service, which in previous campaigns was one of the core\ntactics abused to automate the installation process of Android banking trojans via dropper apps in Google Play.\n\nBy limiting the use of these permissions, actors were forced to choose the more conventional way of installing apps, which is by\nasking the installation permission, with the side-effect of blending in more with legitimate apps. This is one of the core reasons of the\nsignificant success of mobile banking threat actors in sneaking into Google’s trusted app store.\n\nA second big factor behind their success is that actors have set restrictions, with mechanisms to ensure that the payload is installed\nonly on the victim’s device and not on testing environments. To achieve this, criminals use a multitude of techniques, which range\nfrom location checks to incremental malicious updates, passing by time-based de-obfuscation and server-side emulation checks.\n\nThis incredible attention dedicated to evading unwanted attention renders automated malware detection less reliable. This\nconsideration is confirmed by the very low overall VirusTotal score of the 9 number of droppers we have investigated in this blogpost.\n\n## How we help our customers\n\nThreatFabric makes it easier than it has ever been to run a secure mobile payments business.
