    "plain_text": "# Protecting people from recent cyberattacks\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/)**\n\nDecember 6, 2021\n\nThe Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has disrupted the activities of a China-based\n[hacking group that we call Nickel. In documents that were unsealed today, a federal court in](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi#page=51)\nVirginia has granted our request to seize websites Nickel was using to attack organizations\nin the United States and 28 other countries around the world, enabling us to cut off Nickel’s\naccess to its victims and prevent the websites from being used to execute attacks. We\nbelieve these attacks were largely being used for intelligence gathering from government\nagencies, think tanks and human rights organizations.\n\nOn December 2, Microsoft filed pleadings with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District\nof Virginia seeking authority to take control of the sites. The court quickly granted an order\nthat was unsealed today following completion of service on the hosting providers. Obtaining\ncontrol of the malicious websites and redirecting traffic from those sites to Microsoft’s secure\nservers will help us protect existing and future victims while learning more about Nickel’s\nactivities. Our disruption will not prevent Nickel from continuing other hacking activities, but\nwe do believe we have removed a key piece of the infrastructure the group has been relying\non for this latest wave of attacks.\n\nMicrosoft’s DCU has been a pioneer in using this legal strategy against cybercriminals and,\nmore recently, against nation-state hackers. To date, in 24 lawsuits – five against nation-state\nactors – we’ve taken down more than 10,000 malicious websites used by cybercriminals and\nnearly 600 sites used by nation-state actors. We have also successfully blocked the\nregistration of 600,000 sites to get ahead of criminal actors that planned to use them\nmaliciously in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has been tracking Nickel since 2016 and\n[analyzing this specific activity since 2019. As with any observed nation-state actor activity,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/06/nickel-targeting-government-organizations-across-latin-america-and-europe/)\nMicrosoft continues to notify customers that have been targeted or compromised, when\npossible, providing them with the information they need to help secure their accounts. The\nattacks MSTIC observed are highly sophisticated and used a variety of techniques but nearly\nalways had one goal: to insert hard-to-detect malware that facilitates intrusion, surveillance\nand data theft. Sometimes, Nickel’s attacks used compromised third-party virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) suppliers or stolen credentials obtained from spear phishing campaigns. In\nsome observed activity, Nickel malware used exploits targeting unpatched on-premises\nExchange Server and SharePoint systems. However, we have not observed any new\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft products as part of these attacks. Microsoft has created unique\nsignatures to detect and protect from known Nickel activity through our security products, like\nMicrosoft 365 Defender.\n\nNickel has targeted organizations in both the private and public sectors, including diplomatic\norganizations and ministries of foreign affairs in North America, Central America, South\nAmerica, the Caribbean, Europe and Africa. There is often a correlation between Nickel’s\ntargets and China’s geopolitical interests. Others in the security community who have\nresearched this group of actors refer to the group by other names, including “KE3CHANG,”\n“APT15,” “Vixen Panda,” “Royal APT” and “Playful Dragon.”\n\nIn addition to the U.S., the countries in which Nickel has been active include: Argentina,\nBarbados, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech\nRepublic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras,\nHungary, Italy, Jamaica, Mali, Mexico, Montenegro, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland,\nTrinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.\n\n\n-----\n\nNation-state attacks continue to proliferate in number and sophistication. Our goal in this\n[case, as in our previous disruptions that targeted Barium, operating from China, Strontium,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/we-are-taking-new-steps-against-broadening-threats-to-democracy/)\n[operating from Russia, Phosphorus, operating from Iran, and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/03/27/new-steps-to-protect-customers-from-hacking/) [Thallium, operating from North](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/12/30/microsoft-court-action-against-nation-state-cybercrime/)\nKorea, is to take down malicious infrastructure, better understand actor tactics, protect our\ncustomers and inform the broader debate on acceptable norms in cyberspace. We will\nremain relentless in our efforts to improve the security of the ecosystem and we will continue\nto share activity we see, regardless of where it originates.\n\nNo individual action from Microsoft or anyone else in the industry will stem the tide of attacks\nwe’ve seen from nation-states and cybercriminals working within their borders. We need\nindustry, governments, civil society and others to come together and establish a new\nconsensus for what is and isn’t appropriate behavior in cyberspace. We’re encouraged by\n[recent progress. Last month, the United States and the European Union joined the](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-supports-the-paris-call-for-trust-and-security-in-cyberspace/) Paris Call\nfor Trust and Security in Cyberspace, the world’s largest multistakeholder confirmation of\n\n\n-----\n\n[core cybersecurity principles with more than 1,200 endorsers. The Oxford Process has](https://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/the-oxford-process#/)\nbrought together some of the best legal minds to evaluate the application of international law\nto cyberspace. And the United Nations has taken critical steps to advance dialogue across\nstakeholders. It is our responsibility, and that of every entity with the relevant expertise and\nresources, to do whatever we can to help bolster trust in technology and protect the digital\necosystem.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cyberfraud,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberfraud/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Digital Crimes Unit,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/digital-crimes-unit/) [MSTIC,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/mstic/) Paris Call for\nTrust and Security in Cyberspace\n\n\n-----",
