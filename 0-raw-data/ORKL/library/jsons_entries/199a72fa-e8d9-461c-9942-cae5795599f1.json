Over the past year it has been\nused primarily for the distribution of Locky ransomware and Dridex. Earlier this year, we\n[wrote about how the Necurs botnet went offline and seemingly disappeared, taking most of](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/01/locky-struggles.html)\nthe high volume Locky malspam with it. Talos recently identified a significant increase in the\namount of spam emails originating from the Necurs botnet, indicating that it may have come\nback to life, but rather than distributing malware in the form of malicious attachments, it\nappears to have shifted back to penny stock pump-and-dump messages. This is not the first\ntime that Necurs has been used to send high volume pump-and-dump emails. In analyzing\nprevious telemetry data associated with these campaigns, we identified a similar campaign\non December 20, 2016 shortly before the Necurs botnet went offline for an extended period.\nThis strategic divergence from the distribution of malware may be indicative of a change in\nthe way that attackers are attempting to economically leverage this botnet.\n\n## Detailed Information\n\nOn March 20, 2017 we observed a marked increase in the amount of spam messages that\n\n\n-----\n\nappear to be originating from the Necurs botnet. Interestingly, these messages don t appear\nto follow the same theme that we have grown accustomed to seeing from Necurs, which has\nbeen one of the primary distribution mechanisms for the Locky ransomware family and the\nDridex banking trojan. Email campaigns associated with Locky and Dridex generally pose as\ntransaction notifications, and purport to contain shipping notifications, ACH transaction\nnotifications, etc. In this particular campaign, the emails do not contain any hyperlinks to\nmalicious servers or any malicious attachments and are simply claiming to be stock market\nalerts about a specific stock ticker ($INCT) that the messages claim is about to go higher.\n\nThe message was structured to entice the user into thinking that this was too good of an\nopportunity to pass up -- a classic get rich quick scheme. First, the email begins with a\nsimple introduction:\n\n\"It's been a long time since I sent you my special newsletter containing a hot stock tip.\"\n\nIt then claims that InCapta Inc ($INCT) is going to be bought out at $1.37 per share by DJI (a\ndrone company) based on information purportedly obtained from colleagues at an M&A firm\nin Manhattan. The email explains that DJI is moving forward with the buyout because\nInCapta has:\n\n\"revolutionized the drone industry by creating the first independent drones that can be\ndispatched to areas of interest such as crime scenes, car chases, wild fires, etc.\"\n\nFurthermore:\n\n\"The network of drones operates by connecting to a cloud and complex algorithms efficiently\ndispatch the drones within moments of an incident being reported.\"\n\n\"This way the media outlet that owns the drones can be the first to the scene and get\nexclusive, live-streamed.\"\n\nTo add urgency, they mention that the buyout is supposed to be announced on March 28,\nand recommend setting a buying limit by recommending purchasing before the stock\nreaches 20 cents a share to guarantee \"massive returns.\" The email adds further urgency by\nclaiming that DJI is going to pay 1000% more than the current value because:\n\n\"This has the potential to literally change the world of news broadcasting as we know it and\nDJI (the most prominent drone-maker in the world) sees the potential of this technology\nwhich is why they are willing to pay $1.37 a share to acquire it. A premium of over 1,000%\nover Friday's closing price.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Sample Message**\n\nAs is normal when dealing with email campaigns, these messages were sent in relatively\nhigh volumes, with tens of thousands seen just over the course of the morning on March 20.\nIn analyzing our email telemetry, we can clearly see a change in the volume of emails being\nseen versus when Necurs was offline. While the volume of messages was high, the spam\ncampaign itself did not appear to last long at all, with the majority of messages sent over the\ncourse of only a couple of hours.\n\nThe stock ticker in question appears to be associated with InCapta Inc., a mobile application\ndevelopment company. The stock has seen a significant increase in the volume of shares\nbeing traded. While analyzing this particular spam campaign, we observed that the volume of\nshares being traded reached over 1 million shares (the total later in the day was over 4.5\nmillion shares), which is exponentially higher than the average volume of shares traded.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Google Finance for $INCT**\n\nShortly after analyzing this initial campaign, we observed a second higher volume spam\ncampaign within our SpamCop telemetry.\n\n**Figure 3: SpamCop Statistics**\n\nInterestingly enough, the stock price also increased around the time this second wave of\n\n\n-----\n\nspam emails was being sent. This second email campaign was very similar to the first but\ncontained a slightly different subject and message body:\n\n**Figure 4: Second Sample Message**\n\n## Historical Necurs Campaigns\n\n[On September 21, 2016, Talos published a blog post outlining the \"Rising Tides of Spam\"](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2016/09/the-rising-tides-of-spam.html)\nwhich detailed the increase of spam emails sent by Necurs in the summer of 2016. These\n[emails often carried Dridex or](https://blogs.cisco.com/talos/spam-dridex) [Locky malware variants, delivering millions of messages per](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/06/gotta-be-swift-for-this-spam-campaign.html)\nday to inboxes around the globe.\n\nIn late December, 2016, however, [this email flow suddenly stopped, and email volume](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/01/locky-struggles.html)\nreduced to less than half of the flow typical of Necurs infrastructure. During this downtime,\nour spam block lists have been averaging 50K addresses. The addresses being blocked\nspiked to over 150K during these new campaigns. This spike is reflected in the email volume\nfrom March 20, 2017, discussed earlier and displayed in the graph below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5:** **[SpamCop Email Flows - Early 2017](https://www.spamcop.net/spamgraph.shtml?spamyear)**\n\nBut does Necurs have a history of sending pump-and-dump spam? Prior to the arrests in\nearly 2016 which led to a quiet period of low botnet activity, Necurs had often sent different\npump-and-dump stock scams. Just before this most recent downtime began, we saw a\nmoderate amount of pump-and-dump scam email volume coming through our data sources\non December 20, 2016. These scam messages urged recipients to buy $SWRM and had\nemail subjects similar to the following:\n\n\"Read Now if you want a stock that will more than double by Christmas.\"\n\"This stock will quadruple before Christmas. Time to buy now!\"\n\nThis December 20 campaign shares headers and attributes similar to the March 20\ncampaign, indicating that the December 20 campaign was also facilitated by the Necurs\nbotnet. One such attributes is the X-PHP-Originating-Script header found in emails from the\npump-and-dump campaigns.\n\nX-PHP-Originating-Script: 1001:Sendmail.php\n\nThis header does not exist in the emails sent during the massive 2016 malware campaigns\nthat were distributing Locky and Dridex however, revealing behind-the-scenes differences\nbetween Necurs' services and infrastructure. On the other hand, both of these campaign\ntypes share common recipients, hinting at the fact that Necurs operators may use a shared\ndatabase of email addresses even when clients request different services.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNecurs is a good example of how over time attackers may change their methodologies as\nwell as the strategies they use to monetize systems under their control. Botnets like Necurs\n\n\n-----\n\nrepresent one vector that Talos continues to monitor for activity and changes in attack\ntechniques. As threats continue to change and evolve, Talos will continue to monitor the\nevolving threat landscape to ensure that our customers remain protected against any new\nthreats.\n\nTalos will continue to monitor the Necurs botnet for signs that it has once again been\nactivated, for whatever purposes it may be used.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n\n-----",
