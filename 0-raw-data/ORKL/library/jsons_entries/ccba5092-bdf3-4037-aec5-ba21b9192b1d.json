Compared to the previous\nmonths, the number of organisations that\nnotified NÚKIB about an incident has\ngrown by one-fifth.\n\nThe growth in the number of incidents was\nmainly caused by a campaign led by a proRussian hacktivist group known as Killnet.\nNÚKIB was notified about associated cyber\nincidents by seven organisations. The attacks were generally less sophisticated,\ncausing the unavailability of web pages.\nThe group did not compromise the information systems of their targets and hence\ndid not access the data stored in them. It is\nlikely that Killnet’s motivation was to harm\nthe reputation of its targets.\n\nThe attacks are likely to be associated with\nthe Czech Republic’s support to Ukraine.\nKillnet is a Russian-speaking group and\nbased on its statements, supports the Russian Federation. Since the beginning of the\ninvasion, the group has attacked not only\norganisations and governmental institutions in the Czech Republic but also other\nNATO states and Ukraine. The DDoS attacks\nin partner states coincided with important\nevents, typically military or humanitarian\nsupport to Ukraine. The attacks in the\nCzech Republic were no exception in this\nregard.\n\n\nNumber of cyber incidents reported to NÚKIB\n\nSeverity of the addressed cyber incidents\n\nClassification of the incidents reported to NÚKIB\n\nTrends in cyber security in April\n\nTechnique of the month: Malicious File\n\nFocused on the threat: DDoS campaign launched by\n\nKillnet\n\n\nThe following report summarises the events of the month. The data, information and conclusions contained herein are\nprimarily based on cyber incidents reported to NÚKIB. Where the report contains information from open sources in\nsome sections, the source of this information is always stated.\n\nYou can send comments and suggestions for improving the report to the address komunikace@nukib.cz.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Number of cyber security incidents reported to NÚKIB\n\nApril was a month with the second highest number of incidents in the last twelve months. It was\nonly surpassed by November when the ProxyShell vulnerability was actively abused.[1]\n\n25\n\nactive exploitaion of MS\nProxyShell vulnerabilties\n\n**20**\n\nand increase in\n\n20 ransomware attacks\n\n15\n\naverage of the last 12 months\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nApr 21 May Jun July Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan 22 Feb Mar Apr\n\n### Severity of the handled cyber incidents[2]\n\nTwo-thirds of April’s incidents had significant impacts. They were mainly caused by DDoS attacks,\nwhich, among others, targeted important state institutions, and ransomware, which attacked\nsmaller non-regulated entities.\n\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\nless important\ncyber security\nincident\n\nimportant cyber\nsecurity incident\n\nvery important\ncyber security\nincident\n\n|Col1|Col2|7 6 13|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n||||\n\n\nApr 21 May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan 22 Feb Mar Apr\n\n\n1 Thirteen incidents were reported to NÚKIB by obligated persons according to the Cyber Security Act. The remaining\nseven incidents were reported by entities that do not fall under this law.\n2 NÚKIB determines the severity of cyber incidents on the basis of Decree No. 82/2018 Coll. and its internal methodology.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Classification of the incidents reported to NÚKIB[3]\n\nNÚKIB classified April’s incidents within the following four categories:\n\n`o` Three-quarters of all the incidents resulted in the unavailability of services. Seven of these incidents were\ncaused by DDoS attacks, which had only represented a minor part of the incidents reported to NÚKIB in the\npreceding months. Ransomware and cryptomining malware had adverse effects on availability in five cases; in\nthree incidents, the service unavailability was caused by a technical failure;\n\n`o` The second most frequent category included incidents with unauthorised access to information. One of them\nwas an attack against a local authority’s database, whose content the attackers stole. The attackers have not\npublished the data so far; nevertheless, its publishing cannot be ruled out in the near future;\n\n`o` NÚKIB classified one attack as fraud. The attackers probably compromised an e-mail account of an important\nstate institution’s employee. subsequently, they sent phishing e-mails with diplomatic theme from the e-mail\naccount to governmental organisations in other European countries (see page 4);\n\n`o` The last remaining April’s incident was classified by NÚKIB within the malicious code category after NÚKIB had\nfound elements of a Czech company’s infrastructure communicating with Emotet malware control servers.\n\n**April 2021** **April 2022**\n\n\nAvailability\ne.g. availability disruption caused by a\nDoS/DDoS attack or sabotage\n\nInformation security\ne.g. unauthorised access to data, unauth.\nmodification of information\n\nFraud\ne.g. phishing, identity theft or\nunauthorised use of ICT\n\nMalicious code\ne.g. virus, worm, Trojan, dialer, spyware\n\nIntrusion\ne.g. compromising an application or user\naccount\n\nIntrusion attempts\ne.g. attempt to exploit a vulnerability,\nattempt to log in, etc\n\nInformation gathering\ne.g. scanning, sniffing, social engineering\n\nAbusive content\ne.g. spam, cyberbullying, inappropriate\ncontent\n\nOther\n\n\n46 % **75 %**\n\n0 % **15 %**\n\n**5 %**\n0 %\n\n54 % **5 %**\n\n0 % 0 %\n\n0 % 0 %\n\n0 % 0 %\n\n0 % 0 %\n\n0 % 0 %\n\n\n3 The cyber incident classification is based on the ENISA taxonomy: [Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy —](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/reference-incident-classification-taxonomy)\n[ENISA (europa.eu)](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/reference-incident-classification-taxonomy)\n\n\n-----\n\n### April trends in cyber security from the NÚKIB’s perspective[4]\n\nPhishing, spear-phishing, and social engineering Malware\n\n\nOne of April’s incidents involved an intercepted\nphishing e-mail that the attackers were sending from\nan infected e-mail of a state organisation’s employee.\nThe phishing had diplomatic theme and was sent from\nthe Czech e-mail address to another nearly 200\naddresses of governmental organisations in European\ncountries.\n\nAs fraudulent vishing phone calls continue, NÚKIB\n[drew attention to this campaign again. The alert on our](https://www.nukib.cz/cs/infoservis/hrozby/1830-upozornujeme-na-stale-trvajici-kampan-podvodnych-vishingovych-telefonatu/)\nwebsite lists features typical for this wave.\n\nVulnerabilities\n\nIn April, a new critical vulnerability of VMware\n[Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager (CVE-](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22954)\n[2022-22954) products appeared. This vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22954)\nenables an attacker to bypass authentication\nmechanisms and remotely upload a malicious code\nonto a server. Since attackers instantly started to\nexploit the vulnerability, NÚKIB warned the regulated\nsubjects with vulnerable systems about the problem\nand sent them recommendations regarding its\nmitigation.\n\nAttacks on availability\n\nIn the last twelve months, DDoS attacks had only represented a minor part of the incidents registered by\nNÚKIB. The situation changed in April, though. More\nthan one-third of the incidents were caused by DDoS\nattacks launched against Czech targets by Killnet,\na pro-Russian hacker group (for more information, see\npage 6). In some cases, DDoS attacks took down web\npages for several hours. NÚKIB was notified about such\nincidents by seven organisations regulated under the\nCyber Security Act; however, the actual number of Killnet’s Czech victims was approximately three times\nhigher.\n\n\nWithin the scope of its pro-active activities (known as\nthreat hunting), NÚKIB uncovered an infrastructure of\na Czech company hat communicated with Emotet C2\nserver. Attackers deploy Emotet as a first stage payload,\nwhich is often spread by phishing. Upon compromising\nthe victim’s network, Emotet downloads other malware.\nEmotet is currently active in the Czech Republic. Since\nlast autumn, when Emotet re-appeared on the\ncybersecurity scene, NÚKIB has been finding Czech\ncompanies infected with this malware.\n\nRansomware\n\nSince the beginning of the year, ransomware attacks\nhave constantly amounted to approximately one-fifth of\nthe incidents registered by NÚKIB. This trend continued\nin April. The Phobos ransomware was behind the\nmajority of attacks. Phobos primarily aims at smaller and\nmore vulnerable targets. It regularly appears among the\nincidents reported to NÚKIB. One of April’s incidents also\ninvolved LokiLocker, which is quite a new ransomware\noffered as a service; it started to spread in the summer of\n2021, and this was its second occurrence reported to\nNÚKIB so far.\n\n\n4 The development illustrated by the arrow is evaluated in relation to the previous month.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technique of the month: Malicious File\n\n[NÚKIB also evaluates cyber incidents on the basis of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which serves](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nas an overview of known techniques and tactics used in cyber attacks. The prevailing method among\nApril’s incidents was Malicious File, which is a method employed by most APT and cybercriminal\ngroups in their campaigns and which is a common part of phishing attacks.\n\nWith Malicious File, attackers rely on a user to open a file and run the malicious code. This\nmethod is typical for spear-phishing e-mails, for example, which try to persuade the user\nto open an infected attachment and thereby launch the malicious code hidden in it. Among\nApril’s incidents, the Malicious File method was most often reported in connection with\nphishing. The attackers used the method in the initial stages of cyberattacks; however, it\ncan also be used later when the attackers are already present in the victim’s network. After\ncompromising the network, they can create a file, save it on a shared disc and wait until\nother users open it and enable them lateral movement.\n\n**MITRE ID:** **[T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/)**\n\n**Mitigation: The T1204.002 technique can be mitigated at two levels. At the technical level,**\nsandboxing of attachments, at least in the case of potentially problematic file types (zip,\nexe, ps1, and js) and warning users about password-protected archives are suitable\nmeasures. The most frequently abused method in connection with malicious attachments\nis still macros in Office documents. At the level of technical measures, this attack vector\ncan be most easily prevented via domain policies by blocking macro functions for users that\ndo not need them for their work. Yet technical measures alone are not enough. It is essential to train users continuously and draw their attention to the risks associated with social\nengineering and the latest trends in phishing so that they are able to detect them themselves.\n\nA representation of the Malicious File in the Kill Chain showing at which point attackers use the\ntechnique:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Focus on a threat: DDoS campaign launched by Killnet\n\nIn the second half of April, a pro-Russian hacker group known as Killnet launched two series of DDoS\nattacks against webpages of Czech subjects. The attacks are likely connected to the Czech Republic’s\nsupport to Ukraine.\n\nFig. 1: Killnet’s telegram account\n\nThe first wave occurred between 19 and 21 April and affected thir[teen subjects, including NÚKIB and Czech Ministries. The beginning](https://twitter.com/NUKIB_CZ/status/1516865189244809223?cxt=HHwWjsC9kcu2_owqAAAA)\nof the attacks coincided with the announcement of Ukrainian\nheavy weaponry being repaired in the Czech Republic. The second\nwave took place in the night of 27 April, when the attackers\nlaunched attacks against another nine subjects. Killnet announced\nthe initiation of the attacks against Czech organisations on its Telegram account (see Figure 1).\n\nThe attacks were generally less sophisticated, causing the unavailability of web pages. In principle, DDoS attacks overwhelm a service accessible via the Internet with a flood of traffic but do not\ncompromise the organisation’s information systems. Consequently, Killnet did not get to the data stored in the attacked organisations. Its goal probably was to harm the reputation of the\nattacked organisations.\n\n\nTechnical aspects of the attacks by Killnet\n\nBased on data from one of the incidents, NÚKIB identified the attacks as L4 TCP ACK DDoS. It is an\nattack on the transport layer that employs TCP ACK or TCP ACK-PUSH segments, which are used to\nconfirm received data in legitimate communication. This sort of attack is more difficult to mitigate\nsince it is not easy to distinguish legitimate ACK packets from the malicious ones. As a result, the\ncomputational power of the infrastructure’s server or firewall is exhausted due to the heavy traffic\nof forged communication.\n\n\n[Killnet is a Russian-speaking group that, based on its statements,](https://therecord.media/russia-or-ukraine-hacking-groups-take-sides/?msclkid=235244a7ba6611ec92f21c9bd3b8ee49) supports the Russian Federation.\nThis affects its choice of targets. Besides those in the Czech Republic, the group has also attacked\norganisations and governmental institutions in other NATO states and Ukraine. But for one case, all\nthe attacks were of the DDoS type. An exception was an alleged theft of the Kyiv prosecutor’s data,\nwhich coincided with the discovery of the Bucha massacre.[5] Bucha falls under the jurisdiction of the\nprosecution office in the capital of Ukraine. Like in the Czech Republic, the DDoS attacks in other\nstates also coincided with important events, typically military or humanitarian support to Ukraine.\n\nNÚKIB has been pointing out the increased risk of cyberattacks since the beginning of the Russian\naggression. On 25 February, NÚKIB issued a Warning, which, among others, contains a whole range\nof preventive and reactive measures against DDoS attacks. Since the Ukrainian war is very likely to\ncontinue affecting the Czech Republic in cyberspace, we draw attention to the Warning again and\nrecommend all organisations to implement the mentioned measures. The document provides\na guide on how to prepare for a potential DDoS attack and mitigate one that has already occurred.\n\n5 Killnet informed about the attack on its Telegram account\n\n\n-----\n\n### Probability terms used\n\nProbability terms and expression of their percentage values:\n\nTerm Probability\n\nAlmost certain 90–100 %\n\nHighly likely 75–85 %\n\nLikely 55–70 %\n\nRealistic probability 25–50 %\n\nUnlikely 15–20 %\n\nHighly unlikely 0–10 %\n\n### Conditions for the information use\n\nThe information provided shall be used in accordance with the Traffic Light Protocol methodology\n[(available at the website www.nukib.cz).
