Boyle for the District of\nConnecticut said.\n\n\"The defendant designed and operated a service that was an essential tool for some of the\nworld’s most destructive cybercriminals, including ransomware attackers,\" added Acting\nAssistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department's Criminal\nDivision.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[New stealthy BotenaGo malware variant targets DVR devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-botenago-malware-variant-targets-dvr-devices/)\n\n\n-----",
