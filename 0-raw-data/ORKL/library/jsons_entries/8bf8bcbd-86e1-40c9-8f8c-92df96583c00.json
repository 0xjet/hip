This activity took place between at least September\n2020 and October 2020, with its targeting focused on a large volume of entities associated\nwith U.S. state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) networks and aviation sector networks. The\nRussian entity named as responsible has been linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service\n(FSB) by [the Washington Post in connection to past activity attributed by the U.S.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-officials-say-russian-government-hackers-have-penetrated-energy-and-nuclear-company-business-networks/2017/07/08/bbfde9a2-638b-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.html)\n[government to “Russian government cyber actors” and by the New York Times in relation to](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/russia-election-interference-hacks.html)\nAA20–296A; for the sake of argument let’s say that attribution is plausible, if not correct.\n[(*For additional context, Joe Slowik has also published an exceptional blog on the history](https://pylos.co/2020/11/04/the-enigmatic-energetic-bear/)\nand implications of this entity and its operations.) I’d rather not try to summarize all the\nactivity described in the alert here, but instead to address its operational logic and how it can\nbe taken as a likely exemplar of Russian active measures: an insidious blend of offensive\ncounterintelligence and influence operations that, in the words of George Smiley, “would be\nbeautiful in another context.”\n\nThe operation’s apparent targeting parameters provide our first clear clue. While the scope\nwas clearly focused geographically on the United States and sectorally on SLTT-related\nentities, the described scale — in both the text of the alert (e.g., “wide variety of U.S.\ntargets”, “targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation networks”, a one-off reference to\nat least one apparent education sector target likely related to SLTT networks) and a\n[*subsequently published heat map — is relatively large. To my eye, an operation so large](https://indd.adobe.com/view/64463245-3411-49f9-b203-1c7cb8f16769)\nagainst that target scope casts some doubt on as to how much actual value its operators\nreasonably could have expected to draw from the activity if the intention was intelligence\ncollection in advance of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020. Regardless of if it\nrelied on the same logic, the U.S. government seems to have arrived at a similar conclusion,\nnot mentioning a possible collection motive but rather that “…the actor may be seeking\naccess to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to\ndelegitimize SLTT government entities.”\n\nI would take that conclusion a bit further. I believe these targeting parameters suggest a\ndifferent motive than either intelligence collection or acquiring network/system disruption\noptions, because in either case — facing the election day time crunch — the actor would\nfocus their targeting much more narrowly if they really needed to deliver results. I am\ndisinclined to believe the FSB (for the sake of argument) would invest the time and effort\nrequired of such a large operation, so close to a major event of strategic significance (i.e.,\nthe U.S. presidential election), if it was really meant as a shotgun approach to acquire\noptions or data. If those requirements existed, they would’ve certainly predated September\n2020 and been the subject of more highly-targeted activity before autumn.\n\nOur second clue is the tradecraft employed: exploit-chaining that relies on the “CVE greatest\nhits” of the last few years. Given the aforementioned asymmetries within the targeting\nparameters, the picture I see emerging is something akin to the actor artificially constructing\n\n\n-----\n\na game reserve and then opportunistically hunting within it. The targeting parameters are the\ngame reserve: entities in the United States, associated with SLTT government no matter how\ntangentially. The heavy reliance on exploit chaining — easily enough automated — is the\nopportunistic hunting, so opportunistic that it borders on indiscriminate. Yet it remains\nconfined to the boundaries of the artificial reserve. With that kind of model, a viable goal\nemerges in my mind: the offensive counterintelligence effect known as degradation.\n\n[I have previously talked about the potential degradation functions of large-scale targeted](https://youtu.be/4XTTYr5rrrw?t=883)\nintrusion campaigns. Such campaigns require defensive efforts to be expended by a large\ngroup of particular public and private sector entities. From initial incident responders\npotentially all the way up to senior government officials, this effort ripples upward and\noutward as it gathers steam. From a counterintelligence perspective, this exertion and the\nanxieties that accompany it serve the function of frustrating an adversary on multiple levels.\n(In an academic sense, it is an interesting example of capitalizing on Clausewitzian friction.)\nThe anxiety element of such friction also presents further exploitable possibilities.\n\n[Specifically, an actor could harness the collateral psychological effects of such a](https://youtu.be/4XTTYr5rrrw?t=929)\ndegradation-oriented campaign for the purpose of active measures, including influence\noperations, against a wide variety of audiences. In essence, the psychological stress\nendured by blue team personnel and decision-makers is both the core degradation effect as\nwell as the first-order influence impact. The second-order influence impacts would be\ndirected at any individuals that responders et al. would tell about their trials and tribulations,\nincluding individuals who may inform the press or general public. Thus, the third-order\ninfluence impacts could affect at least a portion of the wider public. And once you are trying\nto get average people to wrap their heads around a campaign like that, you can count on\npitfalls of the domestic information environment to help do some of the heavy lifting for the\nadversary when it comes to FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) generation. The anxiety that was\nprimarily designed to wear down security and government communities now has actual\npotential to cause alarm among a susceptible percentage of the public.\n\nDo you see where I’m going with this?\n\nI personally think there’s a good chance that the reported activity was intended primarily as a\ndegradation operation targeting the U.S. government and secondarily as an influence\noperation against both the U.S. government and the American public. In that sense, I’m\nadvocating for the potential motives of “influence U.S. policies and actions” and “delegitimize\nSLTT government entities” as described in AA20–296A. I base this on the reported targeting\nparameters and tradecraft employed, as well as the effects possible from both\ncounterintelligence- and active measures-oriented operational planning perspectives. To\nreturn to my earlier metaphor: the opportunistic hunting within the chosen game reserve in\nsuch close temporal proximity to the election would present ideal conditions for that rippleupward-and-outward anxiety that is so ripe for exploitation. In particular, the politicization of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe integrity of the election presents some extraordinary opportunities for undermining faith in\ndemocratic institutions — to include elections and their outcomes — and maybe sow a little\ngeneral chaos in the process. It would be most Chekist in its logic.\n\nThere is, again to paraphrase le Carré’s Smiley, a last clever knot. I think of it as a dead\nman’s switch for the influence operation goals of this activity. It revolves around whether or\nnot the activity is disclosed and ensuring some level of effects across a variety of scenarios.\nIf the activity is discovered but not publicly disclosed, at least the first-order targets and some\nof the second-order targets have been impacted. If the activity is made public by entities\nother than the U.S. government, then first-order, second-order, and third-order target sets are\nimpacted to at least some degree. If the U.S. government chooses to disclose the activity, all\nthree orders of targets are impacted and the potential for general alarm among the public\nincreases because an official government announcement almost guarantees a greater\nminimum level of public consumption (including via media amplification). It even may be the\nactor’s intent to make this latter potential evident in some way to government decisionmakers as an attempt to create a disclination to disclose or attribute the activity, knowing that\ninternal debate over what course of action to take could intensify friction within relevant\ngovernment entities.\n\nHowever, that third option — disclosure and attribution by the U.S. government — offers\nsignificant positive trade-offs that could counter the some of the intended effects of such\nactivity, if done properly. Being the first to disclose, and disclosing in sufficient detail, would\ngrant the U.S. government a strong opportunity to set the narrative and in doing so\npotentially engage in some meaningful inoculation of the general public against\nmisunderstanding, manipulation, and panic. It also presents a chance to throw the adversary\noff their operational timelines, as a bit of retaliatory degradation. There of course remains the\nvery real risk that the actor responsible may still leverage knowledge gained in this activity in\na variety of ways both during and after election day (e.g., so-called “perception hacks”, hackand-leak operations, website defacements, system/network disruptions, etc.); however, those\npossibilities would exist regardless of if the underlying activity was disclosed or not.\n\n*There also exists the risk that domestic actors, not just the foreign ones associated with the\nSLTT-targeted intrusion activity, could attempt to use the existence of the aforementioned\nactivity to bolster independent efforts (e.g., legal challenges, influence narratives, etc.) meant\n[call into question the validity of the outcome of the election. Kudos to Kyle Ehmke for](https://twitter.com/kyleehmke/status/1324760801803120641)\npointing out this very important point. It is likely that the actor responsible for the activity\ncovered in AA20–296A anticipated, and even desired, that their actions could be potentially\nexploited in such a manner by domestic actors.\n\nIn the spirt of that third option well-executed, I believe the 22 October disclosure represents a\nmeaningful response to Russian active measures. Some may view it as a pyrrhic victory in\nthe absence of some kind of tangible cost imposition like indictments or disruption of\nadversary networks, but to take that stance ignores the more intangible, subtle dynamics\nlikely at play To be clear — I do not attempt to say the theory I’ve outlined definitely is what\n\n\n-----\n\nthis activity represents, merely that I think there is sufficient evidence to make a good case\nfor it. In the same vein, I must acknowledge there are details about the reported activity that I\ndo not know and those details could weaken or outright contradict my theory. However, at the\nend of the day, I fundamentally remain impressed with the adversary’s apparent logic — at\nleast from how I perceive it — and feel further secured in the belief that to not respect your\nadversary’s capacity for cunning is hubristic.\n\n_Disclaimer: As a reminder, all views expressed on this blog, including this post, solely_\n_represent my personal views and not those my employer._\n\n\n-----",
