This attack appears to overlap with the Operation Transparent Tribe and](https://www.proofpoint.com/tw/threat-insight/post/Operation-Transparent-Tribe)**\n\n**[Operation C-Major campaigns that targeted Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan,](http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/indian-military-personnel-targeted-by-information-theft-campaign-cmajor.pdf)**\n\n**as well as the Indian military.**\n\n**We are tracking the group of actors involved in this campaign as ‘ProjectM.’ During our**\n\n**research, we found a linkage between the infrastructure used by ProjectM and an individual**\n\n**from Pakistan. We cannot definitively confirm this individual is involved with this attack**\n\n**campaign, but the evidence that we will discuss in this blog post suggests that it is highly likely**\n\n**that this individual has some involvement with the threat group.**\n\n**This blog post highlights the trail of evidence individuals leave on the Internet when they are not**\n\n**careful about disguising their identity. All of the information collected about this actor is public**\n\n**and accessible through open source research.**\n\n**The ProjectM actors rely on both spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to deliver a**\n\n**variety of different tools to target the Indian government and military. ProjectM actors used a**\n\n**blog with a theme related to the Indian military titled “India News Tribe” (intribune.blogspot.com)**\n\n**as a watering hole to deliver their payloads. This group also used spear-phishing emails with**\n\n**malicious RTF files exploiting CVE-2010-3333 or CVE-2012-0158, in addition to Excel files that**\n\n**contained malicious macros to download and install their payloads as well.**\n\n**The actors have access to a sizeable toolset of Trojans that they use in their attack campaigns,**\n\n**including custom developed tools called Crimson and Peppy, along with off-the-shelf remote**\n\n**administration tools (RATs) and downloaders, such as DarkComet and Bozok. Another**\n\n**interesting part of this campaign is the use of techniques and Trojans often seen in cybercrime**\n\n**attacks, such as the use of the Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload in their attacks to**\n\n**[download and execute other tools in their toolset. The Operation Transparent Tribe report by](https://www.proofpoint.com/tw/threat-insight/post/Operation-Transparent-Tribe)**\n\n**Darien Huss of Proofpoint provides an excellent analysis of the various tools used by this group,**\n\n**including Crimson and Peppy and their associated infrastructure.**\n\n**During our research, we analyzed the registration information of the Andromeda, Crimson and**\n\n**Peppy Trojan command and control domains used by ProjectM. A majority of the infrastructure**\n\n**associated with ProjectM was registered using WHOIS protection services, which conceals the**\n\n**actual registrant’s information (name, email, etc.) used to register the domain name. However,**\n\n**we discovered that the actors had in all likelihood, inadvertently neglected to use WHOIS**\n\n**protection on two domains in their infrastructure that they used to host C2 servers for the**\n\n**Andromeda Trojan.**\n\n**The two undisguised domains were “winupdater[.]info” and “ordering-checks[.]com”, which were**\n\n**registered using the email address “mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com”, as seen in Figure 1. The**\n\n**Andromeda samples used these undisguised domains to deliver Peppy Trojans that used the**\n\n**previously observed ProjectM domain “bbmdroid.com” as a C2 server. The email address and**\n\n**information used to register these domains appears to be real and associated with the actor,**\n\n**which differs from most infrastructure used in targeted attacks that use fake information and a**\n\n**disposable email account during registration. On August 5, 2014, the actor seemingly discovered**\n\n**his mistake as the “ordering-checks[.]com” domain was updated with WHOIS protection.**\n\n\n**Get Updates**\n**Sign up to receive the latest news, cyber**\n**threat intelligence and research from Unit**\n**42.**\n\n**Business Email**\n\n**Submit**\n\n\n## How the New PAN-OS 7.1 Release Benefits Government Organizations�\n\n\n## Ignite 2016: Conquering the Cyber Range\n\n**[posted by Chad Berndtson on April 6, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/cberndston/)**\n\n## How the New PAN-OS 7.1 Release Benefits Government Organizations�\n\n**[posted by Pamela Warren on April 6, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/pwarren/)**\n\n## Ignite 2016: A Next-Generation Security Platform Built for the Prevention Age\n\n**[posted by Chad Berndtson on April 5, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/cberndston/)**\n\n## Announcing PAN-OS 7.1: Extending Breach Prevention to the Cloud\n\n**[posted by Chris Morosco on April 5, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/chris-morosco/)**\n\n## Rejoice!

All of the accounts have corroborative biographical content, giving us a**\n\n**possible identity of a potential actor, who appears to be a 26-year-old individual from Karachi,**\n\n**Pakistan. At this time, we cannot absolutely confirm this individual’s involvement with ProjectM,**\n\n**Operation Transparent Tribe or Operation C-Major campaigns; however, strong evidence was**\n\n**discovered linking this individual’s online presence to entities related to the threat group, which**\n\n**can be seen in the chart in Figure 2. Additionally, content posted to the social networking**\n\n**accounts suggest that the actor has an anti-Indian sentiment, which may be a motivating factor**\n\n**for the actor to participate in such attack campaigns.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We believe the individual associated with the email address “mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com”**\n\n**was at one time and possibly still involved in web design services, as well as revenue**\n\n**generating efforts using Google AdSense. Interestingly, it appears that the individual reused**\n\n**servers and domains set up during web design efforts to host malicious content used in attack**\n\n**campaigns as well.**\n\n**The web design and technology services company hosted at “apnits[.]4t[.]com” listed the phone**\n\n**number “0345-2183117” for its chief executive and as its support number. This phone number is**\n\n**the same as seen in the registration information in Figure 1 without the country code “+92”. We**\n\n**did not find any malicious content on this site; however, we did find content that suggests it was**\n\n**last revised in November 2006.**\n\n**Another web design company created by the individual was discovered at “xtexhosts.com”. The**\n\n**phone number “+92.3452183117” was also found in the WHOIS information and was registered**\n\n**using the email “spid3rsoft [at] gmail.com”. We do not have any indication of malicious content**\n\n**hosted on xtexhosts.com, but it appears that the actor created it for Xtex Studios, which appears**\n\n**to be another web design company started by the actor.**\n\n**We found a third domain, “easternkingsology[.]com,” that contained registration information with**\n\n**the name “Xtex Studios” and the registration email of “mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com” until the**\n\n**domain expired in December 2015. The “easternkingsology[.]com” domain hosted a Bozok RAT**\n\n**sample at hxxp://easternkingsology[.]com/det/dllbb.exe (SHA256:**\n\n**e4dfcf3db512260e1a4ff414907610d5d5279143fa9ade9219d8691be02e512f), which suggests**\n\n**the threat actor hosted this Trojan on an Xtex Studios related domain for use in a ProjectM**\n\n**campaign. Figure 3 shows an advertisement of the services provided by Xtex Studios using**\n\n**“mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com” and “karachian.gem [at] hotmail.com” for contact purposes.**\n\n**_Figure 3 Website Advertising Xtex Studios Services Linking Two Email Addresses_**\n\n**We found the registration phone number and email address for xtexhosts[.]com on an**\n\n**advertisement for another web design company called SPID3R[.]SOFT. The advertisement seen**\n\n**in Figure 4 was hosted on “sahirlodhi[.]com”, which was a domain also used by ProjectM as the**\n\n**download location for a sample of the Crimson tool. At first we hypothesized that**\n\n**sahirlodhi[.]com may have been a compromised site, as it appeared to be the official site for the**\n\n**Pakistani television actor Sahir Lodhi. On May 10, 2008, the domain registration information**\n\n**was updated to include the registrant email of “mshoaib.yaseen[at]gmail.com”, suggesting the**\n\n**threat actor was involved in the creation of this website. The registration information for this**\n\n**domain remained the same until May 21, 2014 when it was updated to include WHOIS privacy**\n\n**protection. We believe that the threat actor still had access to the sahirlodhi[.]com webserver**\n\n**and used it to host the payload for ProjectM, further suggesting that the actor reuses domains**\n\n**and servers to host content and payloads unrelated to its original purpose.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4 Advertisement of SPID3R.SOFT Web Design_**\n\n**In addition to xtexhosts[.]com, the domain “thefriendsmedia[.]com” was also registered using the**\n\n**email “spid3rsoft[at]gmail.com”. This domain hosts a multimedia website that claims it is “Asia’s**\n\n**Biggest Entertainment Portal”. Unit 42 saw this domain hosting several ProjectM tools, including**\n\n**the exact same Andromeda and Peppy samples as those previously observed using**\n\n**bbmdroid[.]com as a C2, which were hosted at “/est/estma.exe” and “/est/controller.exe”**\n\n**respectively.**\n\n**The “thefriendsmedia[.]com” site makes references to “thefriendsfm[.]com”, which was originally**\n\n**registered in October 2010 using the email “mshoaib.yaseen[at]gmail.com”. On March 24, 2014,**\n\n**the actor shared a link on his Facebook (figure 5) and Google+ accounts to an article hosted on**\n\n**“thefriendsfm[.]com” titled “MOD Assistant Director and Staff Grade NTS Results 2014”, which is**\n\n**currently still present on the “thefriendsmedia[.]com” domain. The post discusses applying for**\n\n**positions at the Pakistani Ministry of Defense (MOD), but we do not have any conclusive**\n\n**evidence that the actor applied to or is connected in anyway with the MOD.**\n\n**_Figure 5 Actor’s Facebook post to an article regarding jobs in Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense_**\n\n**The email address “karachian.gem[at]hotmail.com” seen in the advertisement of Xtex Studios**\n\n**led to the discovery of the possible identity of an individual that is likely involved with ProjectM.**\n\n**Unit 42 found the individual’s Google+ profile, seen in Figure 6 and noticed that the profile had**\n\n**several posts that included domains that had hosted payloads or were C2 servers associated**\n\n**with ProjectM, such as:**\n\n**bbmdroid[.]com (Peppy, Bozok)**\n\n**shobitech[.]com (Peppy, DarkComet, Andromeda)**\n\n**mustache-styles[.]com (Andromeda)**\n\n**messagerieneuf[.]com (Crimson)**\n\n**sahirlodhi[.]com (Crimson)**\n\n**_Figure 6 Possible Actor Involved with ProjectM_**\n\n**Also Facebook and Google+ posts include “Bind an exe in excel file | Microsoft Excel Exploit |**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7 – Actor discusses technique seen in campaigns_**\n\n**The “shobitech[.]com” domain also appeared in one of the actor’s Facebook accounts. This**\n\n**Facebook account provided a great deal of information about the actor, specifically in the photos**\n\n**section. The actor used the shobitech[.]com domain in 2013 to host details of a training course**\n\n**(Figure 8) that he was conducting on how to monetize YouTube using Google AdSense.**\n\n**_Figure 8 Advertisement Associated with a Training Conducted by Actor_**\n\n**The photos also show the actor obtained a certificate for completing the “Windows Exploit**\n\n**Development Megaprimer” online course hosted on udemy.com and screenshots of the actor**\n\n**using various offensive security tools, such as Metasploit on Kali Linux (Figure 9). The**\n\n**Operation Transparent Tribe report suggested that Meterpreter samples were used as payloads**\n\n**in the campaign, which is interesting as Meterpreter is part of the Metasploit Framework that the**\n\n**individual has had experience with according to the photos uploaded to his Facebook account.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9 Photo Uploaded to Facebook Account of Individual Using Metasploit_**\n\n**Furthermore, another Facebook account belonging to this actor points to “shoaibyaseen[.]com”,**\n\n**which appears to host this individual’s personal blog. The blog has a total of twelve posts**\n\n**between February 29, 2016, and March 2, 2016. The topics posted to this blog include network**\n\n**port scanning and data gathering techniques, as well as commands to run using Metasploit and**\n\n**Meterpreter to accomplish various tasks to exploit systems and carry out post-exploitation**\n\n**activities. While the use of Meterpreter in Figure 9 and the topics in the “shoaibyaseen[.]com”**\n\n**blog in Figure 10 do not directly implicate this individual, it does strongly suggest that he**\n\n**possesses skills that would be valuable to offensive campaigns like those conducted by**\n\n**ProjectM.**\n\n**_Figure 10 Recent posts on the actor’s blog with topics including Metasploit and post exploitation_**\n\n**_activities_**\n\n**Another interesting observation about this actor is that his name shows up in the debug symbol**\n\n**path of several Crimson tools. The actor’s name appears in the debug symbol path of samples**\n\n**of the Crimson downloader and the remote administration tool, suggesting the actor may have**\n\n**been involved with the development of this Trojan. For instance, the following shows an**\n\n**example of the actor’s name in the debug symbol path of a Crimson downloader (SHA256:**\n\n**dc8bd60695070152c94cbeb5f61eca6e4309b8966f1aa9fdc2dd0ab754ad3e4c):**\n\n**_E:\\Projects\\m_project\\main\\mj shoaib\\Thin_**\n\n**_Client\\secure_scan\\secure_scan\\obj\\x86\\Debug\\secure_scan.pdb_**\n\n**The email address “karachian.gem[at]hotmail.com” also led us to the individual’s blogger**\n\n**account, which was created in April 2008. The “About Me” section of this blogger account states**\n\n**that this individual lives in Karachi, Pakistan and studied computer science. This account also**\n\n**created several other blogs as well, most of which had little content of interest with the following**\n\n**exceptions:**\n\n**bbmdroid[.]blogspot[.]com**\n\n**indian-attack[.]blogspot[.]com**\n\n**Freeowlsofminerva[.]blogspot[.]com**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11 Picture of Individual Associated with Blogger Accounts_**\n\n**The first related blog of interest is bbmdroid[.]blogspot[.]com that contains a link to**\n\n**“bbmdroid[.]com”, which hosted C2 services for various ProjectM tools. The indian-**\n\n**attack[.]blogspot[.]com does not contain any malicious exploit code or payloads, but has a**\n\n**theme of terrorism in India. A blog with a theme related to India closely resembles the India**\n\n**News Tribe (intribune[.]blogspot[.]com) blog that ProjectM used in Operation Transparent Tribe**\n\n**to deliver Crimson payloads.**\n\n**The “freeowlsofminerva[.]blogspot[.]com” blog was created on August 24, 2013, to offer a**\n\n**service for players of the MapleStory MMORPG. The links on the blog point to Excel**\n\n**spreadsheets hosted on “microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us”, such as:**\n\n**_hxxp://microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us/Downloads/(Bera)%20FM%20Price%20List.xls_**\n\n**The blog also includes a link at the bottom of the page to a VirusTotal scan of a file named**\n\n**“(Bera) FM Price List.xlsx” that showed that no antivirus vendors detected the file as malicious.**\n\n**We do not have access to the spreadsheets hosted “microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us” to confirm**\n\n**if they were malicious or not; however, we did observe a DarkComet payload (SHA256:**\n\n**cc488690ce442e9f98bac651218f4075ca36c355d8cd83f7a9f5230970d24157) hosted on this**\n\n**server at “microsoftexcel[.]united-host[.]us/update.exe”. The fact that a payload was hosted on**\n\n**this server leads us to believe the inclusion of the link to a VirusTotal analysis is a social**\n\n**engineering attempt to increase the likelihood a victim would click the links.**\n\n**_Figure 12 Use of VirusTotal Report to Increase Likelihood of Victim Clicking Links_**\n\n**ProjectM is a threat group conducting targeted attacks on government and military personnel of**\n\n**India. Unit 42 has linked several different domains within ProjectM’s infrastructure to an**\n\n**individual residing in Pakistan. This corresponds with the suspicions of David Sancho and Feike**\n\n**Hacquebord at Trend Micro, who documented a likely Pakistani link to the activity in their**\n\n**[Operation C-Major report.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/indian-military-personnel-targeted-by-information-theft-campaign/)**\n\n**At this time, we cannot elaborate on the extent of this individual’s involvement with the targeted**\n\n**attacks; however, it does appear that the individual was involved with setting up some portion of**\n\n**the infrastructure used by the various payloads delivered in the attack campaign. According to**\n\n**the individual’s social media pages and blogs, it strongly suggests he possesses skills to carry**\n\n**out offensive activities in ProjectM campaigns. Also, the individual’s name appearing within**\n\n**Crimson Trojan samples suggests that he may have been involved with the creation of the**\n\n**malware as well.**\n\n**Trend Micro reported finding gigabytes of personal identifiable information (PII) in open**\n\n**directories on C2 servers related to ProjectM, mostly belonging to Indian Army personnel.**\n\n**Although such PII might be used for financial gain, we find multiple instances in social media**\n\n**and blogs where this actor states anti-Indian sentiments, suggesting he is potentially politically**\n\n**motivated.**\n\n**While knowing the identity and motivations of a possible actor is not necessarily actionable from**\n\n**a defensive perspective, it does provide a good reminder that people are always behind an**\n\n**attack, as it is easy to become fixated solely on the technical aspects of malware and**\n\n**infrastructure.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Name *\n\n Email *\n\n Website\n\n\n**[Privacy Policy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal/privacy.html)** **[Legal Notices](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal.html)** **[Site Index](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/site-index.html)** **[Subscriptions](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions.html)** **Copyright © 2007-2013 Palo Alto Networks**\n\n\n# Post Comment\n\n\n-----",
