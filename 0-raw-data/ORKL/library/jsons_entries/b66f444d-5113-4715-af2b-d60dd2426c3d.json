Stuart Jones, and Adam McNeil\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nA clever and complicated new SMS malware attack has been discovered in the United\nStates and Canada.\nThis malware, coined TangleBot, can directly obtainpersonal information, control device\ninteraction with apps and overlay screens, and steal account information from financial\nactivities initiated on the device.\n\n## Overview\n\nCloudmark threat analysts have discovered a new piece of mobile malware spreading via\nSMS and currently targeting Android mobile users in the United States and\nCanada.TangleBot uses SMS text message lures with content about COVID regulations\nand the third dose of COVID vaccines to trick mobile subscribers into\ndownloading malware that compromises the security of the device and configures the system\nto allow for the exfiltration of confidential information to systems controlled by the\nattacker(s). The malware has been given the moniker TangleBot because of its many levels\nof obfuscation and control over a myriad of entangled device functions, including contacts,\nSMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet access, and camera and microphone.\n\n## TangleBot Malware Function\n\n[Following in the footsteps of the FluBot SMS Android malware that has proven to be an](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android-malware-spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon)\nongoing threat in Europe and the UK, TangleBot attempts to trick mobile users into\ndownloading malicious software by sending COVID-19 warning notifications (Figures 1 and\n2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nShould a user fall victim and click on the link in the message, a website appears notifying the\nuser that the Adobe Flash Player on the device is out of date and must be updated. If the\nuser clicks on the subsequent dialog boxes, TangleBot malware is installed on the Android\ndevice.\n\n\n-----\n\nTangleBot is then granted privileges to access and control many device functions (Figures\n3 through 5), including contacts, SMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet, camera and\nmicrophone, and GPS.\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5.\n\nThe attacker can now do the following:\n\nmake and block phone calls\nsend, obtain, and process text messages\nrecord the camera, screen, or microphone audio or stream them directly to the attacker\nplace overlay screens on the device covering legitimate apps and screens\nimplement other device observation capabilities\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ability to detect installed apps, app interactions, and inject overlay screens is extremely\nproblematic. As we have seen with FluBot, TangleBot can overlay banking or financial apps\nand directly steal the victim’s account credentials. Also, TangleBotcan use the victim’s device\nto message other mobile devices spreading throughout the mobile network. The capabilities\nalso enable the theft of considerable personal information directly from the device\nand through the camera and microphone, spying on the victim. Harvesting of personal\ninformation and credentials in this manner is extremely troublesome for mobile users\nbecause there is a growing market on the dark web for detailed personal and account data.\nEven if the user discovers the TangleBot malware installed on their device and is able to\nremove it, the attacker may not use the stolen information for some period of\ntime, rendering the victim oblivious of the theft.\n\n## Mobile Users Should Be Aware\n\nMobile users should be alert and on the lookout for these unexpected SMS warning\nmessages and follow these SMS best practices:\n\n**Do’s**\n\n1. Be on the lookout for suspicious text messages. Criminals are increasingly using mobile\nmessaging and SMS phishing as an attack vector.\n\n2. Carefully consider before providing your mobile phone number to an enterprise or other\ncommercial entity.\n\n3. If you receive a message from any enterprise, includingsome sort of warning or package\ndelivery notification that contains a web link, use your device’s browser to access\nthe enterprise’s or service’s website directly. Do not use the web link provided in the text\nmessage. Do this as well for any offer codes you receive by entering them directly into\nthe enterprise’s or service’s website from your browser.\n\n4. Report SMS phishing and spam. Use the spam reporting feature in your messaging client\nif it has one, or forward spam text messages to 7726, which spells “SPAM” on the phone\nkeypad.\n\n5. Be careful downloading and installing new software to your mobile device and read install\nprompts closely, looking out for information regarding rights and privileges that the app may\nrequest.\n\n**Don’ts**\n\n1. Don’t respond to any unsolicited enterprise or commercial messages from a vendor or\nenterprise you don’t recognize. Doing so will often confirm that you’re a “real person.”\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Don t install software on your mobile device outside a certified app store from the vendor\nor Mobile Network Operator.\n\nFor more information on our security platform for mobile messaging, please\nvisit: [https://www.cloudmark.com/en/s/products/cloudmark-security-platform-for-mobile.](https://www.cloudmark.com/en/s/products/cloudmark-security-platform-for-mobile)\n\n\n-----",
