    "plain_text": "# TrickBot is Dead. Long Live TrickBot!\n\n**[labs.bitdefender.com/2020/11/trickbot-is-dead-long-live-trickbot/](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/11/trickbot-is-dead-long-live-trickbot/)**\n\n[Anti-Malware Research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n4 min read\n\nOne product to protect all your devices, without slowing them down.\n\n[Free 90-day trial](http://10.10.0.46/media/html/consumer/new/get-your-90-day-trial-opt/index.html)\n\nTrickBot still crawls despite law enforcement kneecapping operation. It’s operators are\nscrambling to restore the botnet back to its former glory, Bitdefender researchers have found.\nAn analysis of samples reveals updated communication mechanisms, new C2 infrastructure\nthat uses Mikrotik routers, and packed modules\n\nTrickBot has arguably been one of the most popular Trojans for the past couple of years,\nused by threat actors mostly because of its modular design and highly resilient infrastructure.\n[Bitdefender researchers even analyzed one of its modules earlier this year, particularly](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/03/new-trickbot-module-bruteforces-rdp-connections-targets-select-telecommunication-services-in-us-and-hong-kong/)\nbecause it targeted telecom, education, and financial services in the US and Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, when Microsoft decided to take down TrickBot before the US elections, fearing the\nmassive botnet could be used to thwart the voting process in some way, the endeavor\nproved to be more like a “kneecapping” operation rather than cutting the hydra’s heads. This\nwas likely a short-term tactic, potentially just to make sure that TrickBot wouldn’t cause any\nissues during the elections.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\nMikrotik routers used as C&C servers\nVersion update responses are digitally signed with bcrypt for some\nPlugin sever list no longer contains hidden services\n\nThe group behind TrickBot seems to have actively pushed new versions of the Trojan and\nmaintained the full list of modules used in previous versions. However, in the recently\nanalyzed samples, it seems that the shareDll – or mshareDll in its packed version – was no\nlonger present. In fact, now there’s only the shareDll, which is packed, with mshareDll\ncompletely removed. This probably indicates that TrickBot operators are moving away from\nunpacked modules, cleaning up their list of lateral movement modules to only use packed\nones.\n\n**Versioning**\n\nBefore Trickbot’s takedown, the latest known version was `1000513, from August 19, 2020.`\nHowever, on November 3, we found the new “rd `2000016 ” version that seems to feature all`\nthe improvements mentioned above. TrickBot operators seem to have then settled on going\nback to the original format, but resetting the versioning. Consequently, the latest version\nwe’ve found is now “ 100003 ”, available from November 18.\n\n**C&C infrastructure**\n\nIn terms of communication between victims and C&Cs, TrickBot update responses seem to\nhave been digitally signed using `bcrypt, potentially in an effort to impede future`\ntakedowns. This particular improvement ensures that each new update for TrickBot is\nlegitimate. This particular behavior was observed for the `2000016` version, but not for the\n\n`100003` version.\n\nThe C&C servers for the “ 100003 ” version seem to involve only the use of Mikrotik routers:\n\nIP COUNTRY\n\n103.131.157.161 BD\n\n103.52.47.20 ID\n\n102.164.206.129 ZA\n\n103.131.156.21 BD\n\n103.150.68.124 Not found\n\n103.30.85.157 ID\n\n103.131.157.102 BD\n\n\n-----\n\n103.146.232.5 Not found\n\n103.156.126.232 Not found\n\nAnother interesting change is that, among the updated C&C sever list, there’s also an\nEmerDNS domain used as a backup in case no known C&C server responds. What’s\ninteresting about this particular domain is that the EmerCoin key\n( EeZbyqoTUrr4TpnBk67iApX2Wj3uFbACbr ) used to administer the server, also administers\nsome C&C servers that belong to the Bazar backdoor. The analyzed sample\n( 82e2de0b3b9910fd7f8f88c5c39ef352 ) uses the `morganfreeman.bazar domain, which`\nhas the 81.91.234.196 IP address and running `Mikrotik v6.40.4 .`\n\n**Plugin server configuration**\n\nThere are also some major differences between the lists of plugin server configurations, as\nseen below:\n\nFig. 1 – Previous versions of\n\nTrickBot plugin server configurations\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 2 – New versions of TrickBot\n\nplugin server configurations\n\nIP COUNTRY\n\n156.96.62.82 US\n\n62.108.34.45 DE\n\n185.234.72.248 DE\n\n195.123.241.206 US\n\n194.5.249.216 RO\n\n195.123.240.238 US\n\n46.21.153.247 US\n\n195.123.241.207 US\n\n156.96.119.28 US\n\nTrickBot operators have apparently eliminated the Tor plugin services and have added the\nnew `<psrva> tags, which seem to be obfuscated IPs, a technique also used by the Bazar`\nbackdoor. Although these look like legitimate IP address, they’re not.\n\nThe `<srva> tag appears to only be used for C&C servers, a number that seems to have`\nbeen reduced considerably compared to previous TrickBot versions.\n\n**Victims of the new version**\n\nBased our own telemetry, the most reports from systems that have encountered this new\nversion of TrickBot seem to involve connections from Malaysia, followed by the United\nStates, Romania, Russia and Malta.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nCompletely dismantling TrickBot has proven more than difficult, and similar operations in the\npast against popular Trojans has proven that the cybercriminal community will always push\nto bring back into operation something that’s profitable, versatile and popular. TrickBot might\nhave suffered a serious blow, but its operators seem to be scrambling to bring it back,\npotentially more resilient and difficult to extirpate than ever before.\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Liviu ARSENE\n\nLiviu Arsene is the proud owner of the secret to the fountain of never-ending energy.
