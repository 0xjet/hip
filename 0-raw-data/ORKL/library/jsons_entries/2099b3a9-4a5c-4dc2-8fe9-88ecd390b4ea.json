It is\nused for stealing user data, performing network reconnaissance, moving laterally, or\ndropping additional payloads such as Cobalt Strike and ransomware in particular.\n\n[It has been spotted growing slowly but steadily since the beginning of the year, but its](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-growing-slowly-but-steadily-since-november-resurgence/)\noperators may be shifting up a gear now.\n\n## Spike in distribution\n\nAccording to a report Kaspersky released today, Emotet activity is seeing a sharp rise from\nFebruary to March, going from 3,000 to 30,000 emails.\n\nThe languages used in these messages include English, French, Hungarian, Italian,\nNorwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Chinese.\n\nAs for the themes, Emotet distributors are known for changing the topics regularly to take\n[advantage of seasonal interest swifts. This time it’s the Easter celebration they're taking](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-campaign-impersonates-the-irs-for-2022-tax-season/)\nadvantage of.\n\n[Check Point also released a report, which ranked Emotet as the number one most prevalent](https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2022/march-2022s-most-wanted-malware-easter-phishing-scams-help-emotet-assert-its-dominance/)\nand active malware in March 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Emotet email using Easter lures on many languages**\n\n_(Check Point)_\n\nKaspersky mentions that the ongoing Emotet email distribution campaigns also employ\n[discussion thread hijacking tricks, seen in Qbot campaigns linked to the same operators.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-servers-hacked-in-internal-reply-chain-attacks/)\n\n“Cybercriminals intercept already existing correspondence and send the recipients an email\ncontaining a file or link, which often leads to a legitimate popular cloud-hosting service,”\n[Kaspersky](https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_kaspersky-finds-malicious-spam-campaign-targeting-organizations-grows-10-fold-in-a-month-spreads-qbot-and-emotet-malware)\n\n“The aim of the email is to convince users to either (i) follow the link and download an\narchived document and open it – sometimes using a password mentioned in the email, or (ii)\nsimply open an email attachment,” the researchers note.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause the threat actors have access to previous correspondence, it is reasonably easy for\nthem to present the attachment as something the recipient would expect as a continuation of\nthe discussion with colleagues.\n\n## Switch to 64-bit\n\nThe [Cryptolaemus security research group, who is keeping a sharp eye on Emotet botnet](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1)\nactivity, said that the malware operators have also switched to 64-bit loaders and stealer\nmodules on Epoch 4, one of subgroups of the botnet that run on separate\ninfrastructure. Previously, it relied on 32-bit code.\n\n[#Emotet Update - Looks like Ivan laid an egg for easter and has been busy. As of](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emotet?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nabout 14:00UTC today 2022/04/18 - Emotet on Epoch 4 has switched over to using 64bit loaders and stealer modules. Previously everything was 32-bit except for occasional\n[loader shenanigans. 1/x— Cryptolaemus (@Cryptolaemus1) April 19, 2022](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1516261512372965383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe switch is not visible on Epoch 5 but the delay is expected, since Epoch 4 typically serves\nas a development test-bed for the Emotet operators, researchers from Cryptolaemus say.\n\nAlready, the detection rate for Epoch 4 has dropped by 60%, which is believed to be a direct\nresult of this change.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Emotet malware infects users again after fixing broken installer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-infects-users-again-after-fixing-broken-installer/)\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure included](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/historic-hotel-stay-complementary-emotet-exposure-included/)\n\n[EmoCheck now detects new 64-bit versions of Emotet malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emocheck-now-detects-new-64-bit-versions-of-emotet-malware/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
