[5] But the group has also use\n\nciated with threat actors in China [6] — so much so that PIVY\n\n\n**ALL POSTS** **FIREEYE HOME**\n\n**View more videos »**\n\n### F b k\n\n\nattacks linked to China.\n\n\nblog post analyzes several recent Molerats attacks that deplo\ne U.S. We also examine additional PIVY attacks that leverage\ns in Egypt and the wider Middle East to lure targets into openin\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware sample we analyzed was unusual for two reasons:\n\n\nIt referenced an article that was published last year\n\n\nThe compile time for the dropped binary was also dated from last year, seemingly consistent with the\nreferenced article. But this malware was signed, and — in contrast to the compile time, which can be\nfaked — the signing time on its certificate was much more recent: Monday, July 08, 2013 1:45:10 A.M.\n\n\nHere are the file details:\n\nHamas shoot down Israeli F-16 fighter jet by modern weapon in Gaza sea.doc- – - – – - – - – - -.scr\n\nMD5: 7084f3a2d63a16a191b7fcb2b19f0e0d\n\nThis malware was signed with a forged Microsoft certificate similar to previous XtremeRat samples. But the serial\nnumber (which is often reused by attackers, enabling FireEye researchers to link individual attacks, including those\nby the Molerats) is different this time.\n\nThe malware dropped an instance of PIVY with the following configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nDNS/Port: Direct: toornt.servegame.com:443,\nProxy DNS/Port:\nProxy Hijack: No\nActiveX Startup Key:\nHKLM Startup Entry:\nFile Name:\nInstall Path: C:\\Documents and Settings\\Admin\\Local Settings\\Temp\\morse.exe\nKeylog Path: C:\\Documents and Settings\\Admin\\Local Settings\\Temp\\morse\nInject: No\nProcess Mutex: gdfgdfgdg\nKey Logger Mutex:\nActiveX Startup: No\nHKLM Startup: No\nCopy To: No\nMelt: No\nPersistence: No\nKeylogger: No\nPassword: !@#GooD#@!\n\nWe collected additional PIVY samples that had the same password or linked to CnC infrastructure at a common IP\naddress (or both). We observed three PIVY passwords (another potential identifier) used in the attacks:\n“!@#GooD#@!”, “!@#Goood#@!” and “admin100”.\n\n**Additional Samples with Middle Eastern Themes**\n\nWe also found a PIVY sample used by this group that leveraged what are known as key files instead of passwords.\nThe PIVY builder allows operators to load .pik files containing a key to secure communications between the\ncompromised computer and the attacker’s machine. By default, PIVY secures these communications with the ascii\ntext password of “admin” — when the same non-­default password appears in multiple attacks, researchers can\nconclude that the attacks are related.\n\nThe PIVY sample in question had an MD5 hash of 9dff139bbbe476770294fb86f4e156ac and communicated with a\nCnC server at toornt.servegame.com over port 443. The key file used to secure communications contained the\nfollowing ascii string ‘Password (256 bits):\\x0d\\x0aA9612889F6’ (where \\x0d\\x0a represents a line break).\n\nThe 9dff139bbbe476770294fb86f4e156ac sample dropped a decoy document in Arabic that included a transcript of\nan interview with Salam Fayyad, the former Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample a8714aac274a18f1724d9702d40030bf dropped a decoy document in Arabic that contained a biography of\nGeneral Adbel Fattah el-­Sisi – the Commander-­in-­Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces.\n\n\n-----\n\nA recent sample (d9a7c4a100cfefef995785f707be895c) used protests in Egypt to entice recipients to open a\nmalicious file.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother sample (b0a9abc76a2b4335074a13939c59bfc9) contained a decoy with a grim picture of Fadel Al Radfani,\nwho was the adviser to the defense minister of Yemen before he was assassinated.\n\nAlthough we are seeing Egyptian-­ and Middle Eastern-­themed attacks using decoy content in Arabic, we cannot\ndetermine the intended targets of all of these attacks.\n\n**Delivery Vector**\n\nWe believe that the Molerats attacker uses spear phishing to deliver weaponized RAR files containing their malicious\npayloads to their victims in at least two different ways. The Molerats actor will in some cases attach the weaponized\nRAR file directly to their spear-­ phishing-­emails. We also believe that this actor sends spear-­phishing emails that\ninclude links to RAR files hosted on third-­party platforms such as Dropbox.\n\nIn one such example we found the following link was used to host Ramadan.rar\n(fc554a0ad7cf9d4f47ec4f297dbde375):\n\nhxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/uiod7orcpykx2g8/Ramadan.rar?token_hash=AAHAVuiXpTkOKwar9e0WH-­\nEfrK7PEB9O7t7WC6Tgtn315w&dl=1\n\n**CnC Infrastructure**\n\nWe have found 15 PIVY samples that can be linked through common passwords, common CnC domain names, and\ncommon IP addresses to which the CnC domains resolve. The CnC servers for this cluster of activity are:\n\n\ntoornt.servegame.com\n\n\nupdateo.servegame.com\n\n\negypttv.sytes.net\n\n\nskype.servemp3.com\n\n\nnatco2.no-­ip.net\n\n\nTwo of the domain names (natco2.no-­ip.net and skype.servemp3.com) that were used as CnCs for PIVY were both\ndocumented as XtremeRat CnCs that were used in previous attacks. [8]\n\n\n-----\n\nWe focused on these domains and their IP addresses — which they had in common with toornt.servegame.com. In\naddition, we added the well-­known CnCs good.zapto.org and hint.zapto.org used in previously documented attacks.\n\nBy observing changes in DNS resolution that occurred within the same timeframe, we were able to ensure that the\npassive DNS data we collected was the same. Interestingly, we also found that the domains often shifted to a new\nIP address over time.\n\nCnC Date IP\n\ntoornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-­ip.netskype.servemp3.comgood.zapto.orghint.zapto.org 2013-­07-­10 209.200.39.48\n22:06:562013-­\n\n07-­10\n22:05:312013-­\n\n07-­10\n23:45:462013-­\n\n07-­10\n23:48:412013-­\n\n07-­10\n23:48:41\n\ntoornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-­ip.netskype.servemp3.comgood.zapto.orghint.zapto.org 2013-­07-­16 209.200.39.88\n09:14:302013-­\n\n07-­16\n11:33:212013-­\n\n07-­16\n12:47:592013-­\n\n07-­16\n12:50:512013-­\n\n07-­16\n12:50:51\n\ntoornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-­ip.nethint.zapto.org 2013-­07-­21 173.225.126.166\n15:00:382013-­\n\n07-­21\n15:28:432013-­\n\n07-­21\n16:31:07\n\ntoornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-­ip.net 2013-­07-­21 173.225.126.103\n22:06:192013-­\n\n07-­21\n22:04:49\n\ntoornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-­ip.netskype.servemp3.comgood.zapto.orghint.zapto.org 2013-­07-­29­ 209.200.39.220\n\n|CnC|Date|IP|\n|---|---|---|\n|toornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-i­p.netskype.servemp3.comgood.zapto.orghint.zapto.org|2013-0­7-1­0 22:06:562013-­ 07-1­0 22:05:312013-­ 07-1­0 23:45:462013-­ 07-1­0 23:48:412013-­ 07-1­0 23:48:41|209.200.39.48|\n|toornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-i­p.netskype.servemp3.comgood.zapto.orghint.zapto.org|2013-0­7-1­6 09:14:302013-­ 07-1­6 11:33:212013-­ 07-1­6 12:47:592013-­ 07-1­6 12:50:512013-­ 07-1­6 12:50:51|209.200.39.88|\n|toornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-i­p.nethint.zapto.org|2013-0­7-2­1 15:00:382013-­ 07-2­1 15:28:432013-­ 07-2­1 16:31:07|173.225.126.166|\n|toornt.servegame.comnatco2.no-i­p.net|2013-0­7-2­1 22:06:192013-­ 07-2­1 22:04:49|173.225.126.103|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|16:46:352013-­ 07-­29 16:49:272013-­ 07-­29 16:49:27|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|natco2.no-­ ip.netgood.zapto.orghint.zapto.orgtoornt.servegame.comomagle.serveblog.netskype.servemp3.com|2013-0­7-1­0 22:05:312013-­ 07-1­0 22:06:352013-­ 07-1­0 22:06:372013-­ 07-1­0 22:06:562013-­ 07-1­0 22:19:032013-­ 07-1­0 22:19:31|209.200.39.48|\n|egypttv.sytes.nettoornt.servegame.com|2013-0­8-1­0 14:07:382013-­ 08-1­0 14:08:43|173.225.126.179|\n\n\nOne interesting discovery concerns a sample (5b740b4623b2d1049c0036a6aae684b0) that was first seen by\nVirusTotal on September 14, 2012. This date is within the timeframe of the original XtremeRat attacks, but the\npayload in this case was PIVY. This indicates that the attackers have been using PIVY in addition to XtremeRat for\nlonger than we had originally believed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe do not know whether using PIVY is an attempt by those behind the Molerats campaign to frame China-­based\nthreat actors for their attacks or simply evidence that they have added another effective, publicly-­available RAT to its\narsenal. But this development should raise a warning flag for anyone tempted to automatically attribute all PIVY\nattacks to threat actors based in China. The ubiquity of off-­the-­shelf RATs makes determining those responsible an\nincreasing challenge.\n\nThe ongoing attacks are also heavily leveraging content in Arabic that uses conflicts in Egypt and the wider Middle\nEast to lure targets into opening malicious files. But we have no further information about the exact targets of these\nArabic lures.\n\nAs events on the ground in the Middle East — and in Egypt in particular — receive international attention, we expect\nthe Molerat operators to continue leveraging these headlines to catalyze their operations.\n\n**Notes**\n1. http://www.timesofisrael.com/how-­israel-­police-­computers-­were-­hacked-­the-­inside-­story/\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/blogs/diplomania/israel-­s-­foreign-­ministry-­targeted-­by-­computer-­virus-­bearing-­idf-­chief-­s-­\nname.premium-­1.472278\n\n2. http://download01.norman.no/whitepapers/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf\n\n3. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-­security-­intelligence/new-­xtreme-­rat-­attacks-­on-­usisrael-­and-­other-­foreign-­\ngovernments/\n\n4. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-­security-­intelligence/new-­xtreme-­rat-­attacks-­on-­usisrael-­and-­other-­foreign-­\ngovernments/\n\n5. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-­security-­intelligence/new-­xtreme-­rat-­attacks-­on-­usisrael-­and-­other-­foreign-­\ngovernments/\n\n6. http://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-­poison-­ivy-­report.pdf\n\n7.
