    "plain_text": "## Executive Summary\n\nIn early July 2015, Chinese APT actors used an Adobe Flash Player exploit within a specific webpage\n\ndetailing a noteworthy international legal case between the Philippines and China. This precedent setting\n\nlegal case would be followed by many Southeast Asian nations, as well as others around the globe. The\n\nexploit appeared on day three of the Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal, exposing an untold number\n\nof interested parties that visited the webpage to potential exploitation.\n\nWhen considered holistically, the intelligence supports the conclusion that this exploitation campaign was\n\npurposefully carried out against the backdrop of diplomatic and legal maneuvering. Despite Beijing’s\n\nunwillingness to participate in the international arbitration and their rejection of the PCA’s jurisdiction,\n\nthere appears to be a distinct effort to surreptitiously target those who are interested in this landmark\n\ninternational legal case via electronic means.\n\nThreatConnect has shared the details of this incident to our Common Community within Incident\n\n[20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit.

The significance of this is that the PCA is an “intergovernmental organization\n\n_providing a variety of dispute resolution services to the international community” located at the “Peace_\n\nPalace” within The Hague, Netherlands. The 102-year-old Peace Palace is a historic fixture within the\n\nsphere of international law because it also houses the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial\n\nbody of the United Nations, as well as other bodies and resources that uphold and support international\n\nlaws and norms to which many nations adhere.\n\n[The exploit was posted to the PCA website during the first round of arguments of a notable international](http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-timeline/)\n\n[legal case where the Philippines is contesting Chinese territorial expansion within the South China Sea](http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/in-the-philippines-south-china-sea-case-is-international-law-on-trial/)\n\n(SCS), specifically challenging encroachment into the Philippines exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n\n\n-----\n\nThese arbitral proceedings were initially instituted by the Republic of the Philippines against the People’s\n\n[Republic of China under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on](http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf)\n\nJanuary 22, 2013.\n\nTwo years later, on July 09, 2015, an attacker compromised the official PCA webpages at:\n\n[http:]//www.pca-cpa[.]org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1529\n\n[http:]//www.pca-cpa[.]org/showproj.asp?pag_id=1529\n\nThis exploitation was almost certainly not a random compromise of the PCA website; rather, it occurred\n\n\n-----\n\nthat specifically described the legal case of The Republic of the Philippines v. The People s Republic of\n\nChina.\n\n[According to URLQuery, the attackers placed a CVE-2015-5119 Flash Exploit at the malicious URL](http://urlquery.net/report.php?id=1436446646272)\n\n[http:]//pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org/movie.swf, and altered the PCA webpages to load that URL when\n\nvisited.\n\nThe domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org resolved to the IP address 192.243.116[.]241 (Phoenix, Arizona,\n\nUS) at the time of initial exploitation. IP Address 192.243.116[.]241 is owned by IT7 Networks, Inc., which\n\nprovides self-managed Virtual Private Server (VPS) infrastructure. The attackers shifted the domain later,\n\n\n-----\n\ntribunal convened in The Hague.\n\nThe malware payload associated with this exploit has been identified as MD5:\n\n[B4522D05A9E3A034AF481A7797A445EA (Rdws.exe). This payload is a dropper executable that deploys](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d749fd6f24349e82803d85aee5e7c6165baf473ecc2dd76ddd37e33c6f2e3e4b/analysis/)\n\nits main malware component using a dynamic link library (DLL) sideloading technique, where a malicious\n\nDLL is dropped alongside a legitimate program executable that will load that malicious DLL by filename.\n\nIn this instance the attackers leveraged the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable MD5:\n\n\n-----\n\n[2EE25DE7BD6A2705F3F8DDE0DD681E96 (dbghelp.dll). LMS.exe will load any DLL file name](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ce62f34c6d41ee6790279d1fec1b949f9f5f60c345a250fc3e222c4b595f9260/analysis/)\n\ndbghelp.dll that is found in the same path, hence the sideloading technique. In turn, The malicious DLL\n\n[loads a backdoor binary blob MD5: 16E5A27BD55E0B4E595C9743F4C75611 (ticrf.rat).](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/bfa974b02e0fd5130983ff991409fb3d3f9738ab3804d4773adbaa8ebf59b3e2/analysis/)\n\nThe malware connects back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org as well as the subdomain\n\nssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org. The domain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org resolved to 175.45.233[.]205 (Seoul,\n\nSouth Korea) at the time of analysis.\n\n[ThreatConnect also uncovered a related malware sample MD5: 5877D15215B7F398319F0DE7BA7B1947,](https://malwr.com/analysis/N2U2YTJiZjRjMzZlNDk0NTkyMDkzMjVjYWZkZGVmNGQ/)\n\nwhich was submitted to Malwr.com on July 15, 2015. This malware implant matches the type used above,\n\nand leverages the C2 domains books.blueworldlink2015[.]net and vpn.nicklockluckydog[.]org. The former\n\ndomain resolves to the same Netherlands IP 108.61.117[.]9 which resolved pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org on\n\nJuly 10th. blueworldlink2015[.]net was registered by the email address nicklock2004[@]aol[.]com, which\n\nnoticeably uses the same “nicklock” pseudonym found in the domain nicklockluckydog[.]org, and uses the\n\nfalsified address info “zhongguohunansheng” Beijing, China.\n\nThe domain nicklockluckydog[.]org was registered on July 9th, 2015 at 06:22Z by a Chinese domain\n\nreseller using falsified information such as the name Lanny Chen and address 7946 N Bridle Creek Way in\n\nXiamen, Taiwan. On an interesting note, the registration address 7946 N Bridle Creek Way is the same\n\n[observed within a civil suit between the National Football League and various Chinese domain resellers](http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2014/05/20/0ap2000000352462.pdf)\n\noriginally filed in May 2014.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn early July 2015, Chinese APT actors would operationalize an Adobe Flash Player exploit within 72\n\nhours of its public disclosure, strategically staging it within a specific webpage detailing a noteworthy\n\ninternational legal case between the Philippines and China. This precedent setting legal case would be\n\nfollowed by many Southeast Asian nations, as well as those around the globe. The exploit appeared during\n\nthe first round of hearings, exposing an untold number of interested parties that visited the webpage. The\n\ntactic of leveraging strategic website compromises with patched or unpatched exploits is a well known\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen considered holistically, the intelligence supports the conclusion that this exploitation campaign was\n\npurposefully carried out against the backdrop of diplomatic and legal maneuvering. Manila has long\n\nrecognized they are unable to independently lock horns with China diplomatically or militarily, by\n\ninvoking dispute settlement procedures under the UNCLOS, an agreement in which both China and the\n\nPhilippines are signatories. The Philippines is seeking to leverage international law to level the playing\n\nfield against China’s regional diplomatic and military dominance, the ultimate goal being to deter\n\naggressive Chinese expansion activities within the Philippine EEZ and the broader South China Sea.\n\nDespite Beijing’s unwillingness to participate in the international arbitration and their rejection of the\n\nPCA’s jurisdiction, there appears to be a distinct effort to surreptitiously monitor those who are interested\n\nin this landmark international legal case via electronic means.\n\nThis vignette also highlights the critical difference between threat data and threat intelligence. The latter\n\ngoes beyond simply pulling in a stream of open source indicators and blindly pushing them to your\n\nenterprise network security devices and SIEM tools hoping something hits (it works great; you’ll get TONS\n\nof hits…or misses, depending on your perspective). A true Threat Intelligence Platform enables tactical,\n\noperational, and strategic analysis of the details behind the technical how within the context of the non\ntechnical, socio-political why.\n\n[ThreatConnect has previously shared Threat Intelligence research of espionage activity tied to the](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/piercing-the-cows-tongue-china-targeting-south-china-seas-nations/)\n\nincreasing tensions within the South China Sea. In a similar fashion, ThreatConnect has shared\n\nadditional details of this incident to our Common Community within Incident 20150710D: Permanent\n\nCourt of Arbitration Flash Exploit.
