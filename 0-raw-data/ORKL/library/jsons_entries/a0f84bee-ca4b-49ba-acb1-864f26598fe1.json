This malicious activity was the subject\nof a May 27 Microsoft security alert, titled “New sophisticated email-based attack from\nNobelium,” and a May 28 FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency joint\ncybersecurity advisory.\n\nThe Department’s seizure of the two domains was aimed at disrupting the malicious actors’\nfollow-on exploitation of victims, as well as identifying compromised victims. However, the\nactors may have deployed additional backdoor accesses between the time of the initial\ncompromises and last week’s seizures.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast week s action is a continued demonstration of the Department s commitment to\nproactively disrupt hacking activity prior to the conclusion of a criminal investigation,” said\nAssistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department’s National Security\nDivision. “Law enforcement remains an integral part of the U.S. government’s broader\ndisruption efforts against malicious cyber-enabled activities, even prior to arrest, and we will\ncontinue to evaluate all possible opportunities to use our unique authorities to act against\nsuch threats.”\n\n“Cyber intrusions and spear-phishing email attacks can cause widespread damage\nthroughout affected computer networks, and can result in significant harm to individual\nvictims, government agencies, NGOs, and private businesses,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Raj\nParekh for the Eastern District of Virginia. “As demonstrated by the court-authorized seizure\nof these malicious domains, we are committed to using all available tools to protect the\npublic and our government from these worldwide hacking threats.”\n\n“Friday’s court-authorized domain seizures reflect the FBI Washington Field Office’s\ncontinued commitment to cyber victims in our region,” said Assistant Director in Charge\nSteven M. D’Antuono of the FBI’s Washington Field Office. “These actions demonstrate our\nability to quickly respond to malicious cyber activities by leveraging our unique authorities to\ndisrupt our cyber adversaries.”\n\n“The FBI remains committed to disrupting this type of malicious cyber activity targeting our\nfederal agencies and the American public,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the\nFBI’s Cyber Division. “We will continue to use all of the tools in our toolbelt and leverage our\ndomestic and international partnerships to not only disrupt this type of hacking activity but to\nimpose risk and consequences upon our adversaries to combat these threats.”\n\nOn or about May 25, malicious actors commenced a wide-scale spear-phishing campaign\nleveraging a compromised USAID account at an identified mass email marketing company.\nSpecifically, the compromised account was used to send spear-phishing emails, purporting to\nbe from USAID email accounts and containing a “special alert,” to thousands of email\naccounts at over one hundred entities.\n\nUpon a recipient clicking on a spear-phishing email’s hyperlink, the victim computer was\ndirected to download malware from a sub-domain of theyardservice[.]com. Using that initial\nfoothold, the actors then downloaded the Cobalt Strike tool to maintain persistent presence\nand possibly deploy additional tools or malware to the victim’s network. The actors’ instance\nof the Cobalt Strike tool received C2 communications via other subdomains of\ntheyardservice[.]com, as well as the domain worldhomeoutlet[.]com. It was those two\ndomains that the Department seized pursuant to the court’s seizure order.\n\nThe National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and the\nUnited States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia are investigating this matter\nin coordination with the FBI’s Cyber Division and Washington Field Office.\n\n\n-----",
