U.S. prosecutors say Mikhail Pavolovich Matveev, a.k.a.\n“Wazawaka” and “Boriselcin” worked with three different ransomware gangs that extorted\nhundreds of millions of dollars from companies, schools, hospitals and government agencies.\n\nAn FBI wanted poster for Matveev.\n\n\n-----\n\nIndictments returned in New Jersey and the District of Columbia allege that Matveev was\ninvolved in a conspiracy to distribute ransomware from three different strains or affiliate\ngroups, including Babuk, Hive and LockBit.\n\nThe indictments allege that on June 25, 2020, Matveev and his LockBit co-conspirators\ndeployed LockBit ransomware against a law enforcement agency in Passaic County, New\nJersey. Prosecutors say that on May 27, 2022, Matveev conspired with Hive to ransom a\nnonprofit behavioral healthcare organization headquartered in Mercer County, New Jersey.\nAnd on April 26, 2021, Matveev and his Babuk gang allegedly deployed ransomware against\nthe Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Treasury has [added Matveev to its list of persons with](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20230516)\nwhom it is illegal to transact financially. Also, the U.S. State Departmentis offering a $10\nmillion reward for the capture and/or prosecution of Matveev, although he is unlikely to face\neither as long as he continues to reside in Russia.\n\nIn a January 2021 discussion on a top Russian cybercrime forum, Matveev’s alleged alter\nego Wazawaka said he had no plans to leave the protection of “Mother Russia,” and that\ntraveling abroad was not an option for him.\n\n“Mother Russia will help you,” Wazawaka concluded. “Love your country, and you will always\nget away with everything.”\n\nIn January 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published Who is the Network Access Broker\n‘Wazawaka,’ which followed clues from Wazawaka’s many pseudonyms and contact details\non the Russian-language cybercrime forums back to a 33-year-old Mikhail Matveev from\nAbaza, RU (the FBI [says his date of birth is Aug. 17, 1992).](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/mikhail-pavlovich-matveev/@@download.pdf)\n\nA month after that story ran, a man who appeared identical to the social media photos for\nMatveev began posting on Twitter [a series of bizarre selfie videos in which he lashed out at](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/02/wazawaka-goes-waka-waka/)\nsecurity journalists and researchers (including this author), while using the same Twitter\naccount to drop exploit code for a widely-used virtual private networking (VPN) appliance.\n\n“Hello Brian Krebs! You did a really great job actually, really well, fucking great — it’s great\nthat journalism works so well in the US,” Matveev said in one of the videos. “By the way, it is\nmy voice in the background, I just love myself a lot.”\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/G1LclbndLaM\n\nProsecutors allege Matveev used a dizzying stream of monikers on the cybercrime forums,\nincluding “Boriselcin,” a talkative and brash personality who was simultaneously the public\npersona of Babuk, a ransomware affiliate program that surfaced on New Year’s Eve 2020.\n\nPrevious reporting here revealed that Matveev’s alter egos included “Orange,” the founder of\nthe RAMP ransomware forum. RAMP stands for “Ransom Anon Market Place, and analysts\nat the security firm Flashpoint say the forum was created “directly in response to several\nlarge Dark Web forums banning ransomware collectives on their site following the Colonial\n[Pipeline attack by ransomware group ‘DarkSide.”](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=darkside)\n\nAs noted in last year’s investigations into Matveev, his alleged cybercriminal handles all were\ndriven by a uniquely communitarian view that when organizations being held for ransom\ndecline to cooperate or pay up, any data stolen from the victim should be published on the\nRussian cybercrime forums for all to plunder — not privately sold to the highest bidder.\n\nIn thread after thread on the crime forum XSS, Matveev’s alleged alias “Uhodiransomwar”\ncould be seen posting download links to databases from companies that have refused to\nnegotiate after five days.\n\nMatveev is charged with conspiring to transmit ransom demands, conspiring to damage\nprotected computers, and intentionally damaging protected computers. If convicted, he faces\nmore than 20 years in prison.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Who is the Network Access Broker Wazawaka?](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/who-is-the-network-access-broker-wazawaka/)\n\n[Wazawaka Goes Waka Waka](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/02/wazawaka-goes-waka-waka/)\n\nThe [New Jersey indictment against Matveev (PDF)](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Matveev.Indictment.pdf)\n\nThe [indictment from the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C.
