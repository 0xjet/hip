At the FBI, we know “cyber risk is business risk” and “cyber security is national security.”\nThere is no shortage of recent examples showing the wide-ranging economic and national security effects of cyber\ncrimes. We have seen cyber threats emanate from around the world and witnessed the scope and sophistication of\nthese scams and attacks deepen. As these threats increase, we continue to encourage victims to report cyber incidents\nand cyber-enabled frauds to the FBI so that we may impose risks and consequences on malicious cyber actors.\n\nBecause cyberattacks and cyber-enabled frauds continue to affect our everyday lives, the FBI’s Internet Crime\nComplaint Center (IC3) is critical to combatting the cyber threat. The IC3 serves as a public resource to submit reports\nof cyberattacks and incidents, which allows us to collect data, identify trends, and pursue the threat at hand. In 2022,\nthe IC3 received 800,944 complaints, which is a 5 percent decrease from 2021. However, the potential total loss has\ngrown from $6.9 billion in 2021 to more than $10.2 billion in 2022.\n\nWhile the number of reported ransomware incidents has decreased, we know not everyone who has experienced a\nransomware incident has reported to the IC3. As such, we assess ransomware remains a serious threat to the public\nand to our economy, and the FBI and our partners will remain focused on disrupting ransomware actors and increasing\nthe risks of engaging in this activity. In concert, the public can play a crucial role by taking proactive measures to\nprevent and prepare for a potential cyber attack and, if there is an incident, by reporting it to the FBI through the IC3.\nThough cybercriminals are continuously seeking to make their attacks more resilient, more disruptive, and harder to\ncounter, public reporting to the IC3 helps us gain a better understanding of the threats we face daily.\n\nThe FBI’s commitment to assisting victims of cyber crimes and cyber-enabled frauds, as well as our dedication to\nworking with partners to combat these crimes, allows for continued success through programs such as the IC3’s\nRecovery Asset Team (RAT). Established in 2018, RAT streamlines communications with financial institutions and FBI\nfield offices to assist freezing of funds for victims. In 2022, RAT initiated the Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) on 2,838\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) complaints involving domestic-to-domestic transactions with potential losses of\nover $590 million. A monetary hold was placed on approximately $433 million, which represents a 73 percent success\nrate. In 2022, RAT saw a 64 percent increase in FFKCs initiated compared to 2021.\n\nWhile the cyber threat is ever-growing, the FBI remains appreciative of those individuals and entities who report cyber\nincidents to the IC3, as that valuable information helps fill in gaps that are crucial to advancing our investigations. Your\nefforts are critical to our ability to pursue the perpetrators and share intelligence to protect your fellow citizens. Cyber\nis the ultimate team sport, and we are in this fight together. The FBI is relentlessly focused on promoting safety,\nsecurity, and confidence into our digitally connected world, and we are eager to continue working with the American\npublic to bring cybercriminals to justice around the globe.\n\nTimothy Langan\nExecutive Assistant Director\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\n\n-----\n\n#### THE IC3\n\nToday’s FBI is an intelligence-driven and threat focused national security organization with both intelligence\nand law enforcement responsibilities. We are focused on protecting the American people from terrorism,\nespionage, cyber-attacks, and major criminal threats which are increasingly emanating from our digitally\nconnected world. To do that, the FBI leverages the IC3 as a mechanism to gather intelligence and internet\ncrime so that we can support the public and our many partners with information, services, support, training,\nand leadership to stay ahead of the threat.\n\nThe IC3 was established in May 2000 to receive complaints crossing the spectrum of cyber matters, to\ninclude online fraud in its many forms including Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) matters, Computer\nIntrusions (Hacking), Economic Espionage (Theft of Trade Secrets), Online Extortion, International Money\nLaundering, Identity Theft, and a growing list of Internet facilitated crimes. As of December 31, 2022, the\nIC3 has received over seven million complaints. The IC3 mission to provide the public and our partners with\na reliable and convenient reporting mechanism to submit information concerning suspected cyber-enabled\ncriminal activity and to develop effective alliances with law enforcement and industry partners to help\nthose who report. Information is analyzed and disseminated for investigative and intelligence purposes for\nlaw enforcement and public awareness.\n\nThe information submitted to the IC3 can be impactful in the individual complaints, but it is most impactful\nand in the aggregate. That is, when these individual complaints are combined with other data, it allows the\nFBI to connect complaints, investigate reported crimes, track trends and threats, and, in some cases, even\nfreeze stolen funds. Just as importantly, the IC3 shares reports of crime throughout its vast network of FBI\nfield offices and law enforcement partners, strengthening our nation’s collective response both locally and\nnationally.\n\nTo promote public awareness and as part of its prevention mission, the IC3 aggregates the submitted data\nand produces an annual report on the trends impacting the public as well as routinely providing intelligence\nreports about trends. The success of these efforts is directly related to the quality of the data submitted by\nthe public through the public, www.ic3.gov interface. Their efforts help the IC3, and the FBI better protect\ntheir fellow citizens.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### THE IC3’S ROLE IN COMBATTING CYBER CRIME [1]\n\n1 Accessibility description: Image lists the IC3’s primary functions including partnering with private sector and with\nlocal, state, federal, and international agencies: hosting a victim reporting portal at www.ic3.gov; providing a central\nhub to alert the public to threats; Perform Analysis, Complaint Referrals, and Asset Recovery; and hosting a remote\naccess database for all law enforcement via the FBI’s LEEP website.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### IC3 CORE FUNCTIONS [2]\n\n2 Accessibility description: Image contains icons with the core functions.

The following are two\nexamples of the RAT’s successful contributions to investigative and recovery efforts:\n\nSeattle\nIn September 2022, the IC3 received a complaint filed by a victim located in the Seattle, Washington area\nof a BEC who intended a wire of $650,000.00 be sent to an investor, not realizing their email account was\nintercepted by a hacker providing fraudulent bank account instructions. The IC3 RAT immediately initiated\nthe Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) process to freeze the fraudulent financial bank account. Further\ncollaboration with the domestic financial institution enabled a full return to the business of approximately\n$645,000.00. The RAT team walked the victim through the recovery process which enabled the return of\nfunds.\n\nCharlotte\nIn July 2022, the IC3 received notice from the Charlotte field office of an IC3 complaint filed by an attorney\nseeking assistance with a FFKC on behalf of his clients. The clients were in the process of purchasing a home\nand received a spoofed email from their supposed realtor instructing them to wire $400,000.00 to a\nfinancial institution for an escrow payment. Once the wire was initiated, it was realized the instructions\ncame from a spoofed email. Upon notification, the IC3 requested a FFKC to the recipient bank. Further\ncollaboration between the attorney and the Charlotte field office confirmed the full amount of $400,000.00\nwas returned to the victim, making a full recovery possible due to the FFKC process taken by RAT and the\nlegitimate purchase of the home was able to be made.\n\n6 Accessibility description: Image shows Success to Date to include 73% Success Rate; 2,838 Incidents; $590.62 Million\nin Losses; and $433.30 Million Frozen.\n\n\n-----\n\n## THREAT OVERVIEWS FOR 2022\n\n#### BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE (BEC)\n\nIn 2022, the IC3 received 21,832 BEC complaints with adjusted losses over $2.7 billion.\nBEC is a sophisticated scam targeting both businesses and individuals performing transfers\nof funds. The scam is frequently carried out when a subject compromises legitimate\nbusiness email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to\nconduct unauthorized transfers of funds.\n\nAs fraudsters have become more sophisticated and preventative measures have been put in place, the BEC\nscheme has continually evolved in kind. The scheme has evolved from simple hacking or spoofing of\nbusiness and personal email accounts and a request to send wire payments to fraudulent bank accounts.\nThese schemes historically involved compromised vendor emails, requests for W-2 information, targeting\nof the real estate sector, and fraudulent requests for large amounts of gift cards. More recently, fraudsters\nare more frequently utilizing custodial accounts held at financial institutions for cryptocurrency exchanges,\nor having victims send funds directly to cryptocurrency platforms where funds are quickly dispersed.\n\nIn 2022, the IC3 also saw a slight increase of targeting victims’ investment accounts instead of the\ntraditional banking accounts. There was also an increasingly prevalent tactic by BEC bad actors of spoofing\nlegitimate business phone numbers to confirm fraudulent banking details with victims. For one example,\nthe victims report they have called a title company, realtor, etc., using a known phone number, and then\nfind later the phone number has been spoofed. With this increased tactic of “spoofed” phone numbers it\nemphasizes the importance of leveraging two-factor or multi-factor authentication as an additional security\nlayer. Procedures should be put in place to verify payments and purchase requests outside of e-mail\ncommunication and can include direct phone calls but to a known verified number and not relying on\ninformation or phone numbers included in the e-mail communication. Other best practices include\ncarefully examining the email address, URL, and spelling used in any correspondence and not clicking on\nanything in an unsolicited email or text message asking you to update or verify account information.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### INVESTMENT [7]\n\nIn 2022, investment scams were the costliest scheme reported to the IC3. Investment\nfraud complaints increased from $1.45 billion in 2021 to $3.31 billion in 2022, which\nis a 127%. Within those complaints, cryptocurrency investment fraud rose from $907\nmillion in 2021 to $2.57 billion in 2022, an increase of 183%.\n\nCrypto-investment\nscams saw unprecedented increases in\nthe number of victims and the dollar\nlosses to these investors. Many victims\nhave assumed massive debt to cover\nlosses from these fraudulent\ninvestments and the most targeted age\ngroup reporting this type of scam are\nvictims ages 30 to 49. Some variations of\ncrypto-investment scams reported in\n2022 are:\n\n- Liquidity Mining: victims are enticed\nto link their cryptocurrency wallet to\na fraudulent liquidity mining\napplication. Scammers then wipe\nout the victims' funds without\nnotification or permission from the\nvictim. (PSA I-072122-PSA[8]).\n\n- Hacked Social Media: scammers used hacked social media accounts to perpetrate a fraudulent\ninvestment opportunity using cryptocurrency, targeting existing friends of the hacked user.\n\n- Celebrity Impersonation: impersonating a well-known celebrity or social figure, the scammers feign a\nfriendship with the targeted victim who is eventually enticed to learn how to invest in cryptocurrency\nor is given the opportunity to invest by the scammer.\n\n- Real Estate Professionals: the scammer contacts a real estate agent, usually offering to buy a very\nexpensive property for cash or cryptocurrency. Once engaged, the fraudster will expose their control\nof fictitious accounts with purported value of millions of dollars to entice them to engage in their\ninvestment scheme.\n\n- Employment: victims apply for fake positions online at an investment firm or company supposedly\naffiliated with investing. Instead of a job, the victims are instead offered advice investment advice.\nThe investment is fraudulent and designed to retrieve as much money from the target as possible.\n\n7 Accessibility description: Chart shows Investment Fraud Losses Reported to the IC3 by Year for 2017 to 2022.\n[8 Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) | Scammers Target and Exploit Owners of Cryptocurrencies in Liquidity Mining](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220721)\n[Scam](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220721)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### RANSOMWARE [9]\n\nIn 2022, the IC3 received 2,385 complaints identified as ransomware with adjusted losses\nof more than $34.3 million. Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that\nencrypts data on a computer, making it unusable. In addition to encrypting the network,\nthe cyber-criminal will often steal data off the system and hold that data hostage until the\nransom is paid. If the ransom is not paid, the victim’s data remains unavailable.\n\nAlthough cyber criminals use a variety of techniques to infect victims with ransomware, phishing emails,\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top\ninitial infection vectors for ransomware incidents reported to the IC3. Once a ransomware threat actor has\ngained code execution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. In 2022, the IC3 has\nseen an increase in an additional extortion tactic used to facilitate ransomware. The threat actors pressure\nvictims to pay by threatening to publish the stolen data if they do not pay the ransom.\n\n\n**Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to**\n\n**Protect Against Ransomware:**\n\n- Update your operating system and software.\n\n- Implement user training and phishing exercises to raise awareness\n\nabout the risks of suspicious links and attachments.\n\n- If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), secure and monitor it.\n\n- Make an offline backup of your data.\n\n\n**Incident reporting**\n\nRansomware infections impact individual users and businesses regardless of size or industry by causing\nservice disruptions, financial loss, and in some cases, permanent loss of valuable data. While ransomware\ninfection statistics are often highlighted in the media and by computer security companies, it has been\nchallenging for the FBI to ascertain the true number of ransomware victims as many infections go\nunreported to law enforcement. By reporting the incident, the FBI may be able to provide information on\ndecryption, recover stolen data, possible seizure/recovery of ransom payments, and gain insight on\nadversary tactics. Ultimately, the information you provide will lead us to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n9 Accessibility description: Image shows actions you can take to protect against ransomware: Update your operating\nsystem. Implement user training and phishing exercises to raise awareness, secure and monitor Remote Desktop\nProtocol (DDP) if used, and make an offline backup of your data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransomware and Critical Infrastructure Sectors**\n\nThe IC3 received 870 complaints that indicated organizations belonging to a critical infrastructure sector\nwere victims of a ransomware attack. Of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, IC3 reporting indicated 14\nsectors had at least 1 member that fell victim to a ransomware attack in 2022.[10]\n\n#### Infrastructure Sectors Victimized by Ransomware\n\nDefense Industrial Base 1\n\nWater and Wastewater Systems 3\n\nEmergency Services 9\n\nChemical 9\n\nEnergy 15\n\nCommunications 17\n\nTransportation 32\n\nFood and Agriculture 48\n\nCommercial Facilities 58\n\nFinancial Services 88\n\nInformation Technology 107\n\nGovernment Facilities 115\n\nCritical Manufacturing 157\n\nHealthcare and Public Health 210\n\n10 Accessibility description: Chart shows Infrastructure Sectors Victimized by Ransomware.

Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries\nto target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of\nransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files\nwill be recovered. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI\n[urges you to report ransomware incidents to the IC3. Doing so provides investigators with the critical](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\ninformation they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent\nfuture attacks.\n\n11 Accessibility description: Chart shows Top Ransomware Variants Victimizing Critical Infrastructure 2022 Incidents.\nlock bit, ALPHV/BlackCat, and Hive.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CALL CENTER FRAUD [12]\n\nTECH AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT/GOVERNMENT IMPERSONATION\nIllegal call centers defraud thousands of victims each year. Two categories of fraud\nreported to the IC3, Tech/Customer Support and Government Impersonation, are\nresponsible for over $1 billion in losses to victims.\n\n**Victims** **Losses** **Trend**\n**Government Impersonation** 11,554 $240,553,091 68%\n**Tech and Customer Support** 32,538 $806,551,993 132%\n**TOTAL** **44,092** **$1,047,105,083**\n\nCall centers overwhelmingly target\nthe elderly, with devastating\neffects. Almost half the victims\nreport to be over 60 (46%), and\nexperience 69% of the losses (over\n$724 million). To learn more about\nthese types of scams, please see\nthese 2022-published Public\nService Announcements on the IC3\nwebsite [13] and recently published\npodcast[14] on FBI.gov            [15]\n\nThe scams primarily emanate from call centers in South Asia, mainly India. In response to the increasing\nvictimization, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are collaborating with law enforcement in India,\nsuch as the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber-enabled\nfinancial crimes and transnational call center fraud. The cooperation has secured the testimony of U.S.\nvictims of call center fraud for use in enforcement proceedings against the alleged perpetrators.\n\nIn 2022, with the assistance of U.S. law enforcement, Indian law enforcement accomplished multiple call\ncenter raids, disruptions, seizures, and arrests of the individuals alleged to be involved in perpetrating these\ncyber-enabled financial crimes and global telemarketing frauds.\n\n12 Accessibility description: Chart shows number of Government Impersonation and Tech and Customer Support\nvictims and losses for 2022.\n[13 Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) | Technical and Customer Support Fraud; Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220316)\n[(IC3) | Scammers Using Computer-Technical Support Impersonation Scams to Target Victims and Conduct Wire](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221110)\n[Transfers; Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) | FBI Warns of the Impersonation of Law Enforcement and](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221110)\n[Government Officials](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220307)\n14 https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside-the-fbi-tech-support-scams\n15 Accessibility description: Chart shows 2022 Tech/Customer Support and Government Impersonation Losses by age\nrange.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IC3 BY THE NUMBERS[16]\n\n# $10.3 Billion\n\n#### Victim losses in 2022\n\n# 2,175+\n\n#### Average complaints received daily\n\n# 651,800+\n\n#### Average complaints received per year (last 5 years)\n\n# Over 7.3 Million\n\n#### Complaints reported since inception\n\n16 Accessibility description: Image depicts key statistics regarding complaints and victim loss.
