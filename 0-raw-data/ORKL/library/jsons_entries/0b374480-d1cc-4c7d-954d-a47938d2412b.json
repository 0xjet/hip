A typical university phishing campaign is medium volume\n(thousands or tens of thousands of messages per day). Campaigns are typically not\ngeographically targeted, but rather tied to specific universities with phishing templates\ndeveloped for library and student management portals. While many of the examples here are\nfrom schools in the United States, we regularly observe campaigns affecting hundreds of\nuniversities worldwide.\n\nThreat actors distribute messages that contain links or HTML attachments that direct victims\nto cloned university login portals. These portals incorporate stolen branding, accurate street\naddresses, and other social engineering techniques to manipulate users into disclosing login\ncredentials.\n\nThe fraudulent webpages range in complexity and accuracy compared to the original, but\nmany are indistinguishable from their genuine counterparts. We included several examples\nof these fake login pages below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Spoofed university library login portal used for phishing_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Spoofed university library login portal used for phishing_\n\n_Figure 3: Spoofed university library login portal used for phishing_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delivery\n\nThe emails that lead recipients to these phishing portals frequently contain either: (1) HTML\nattachments with URLs that link to the fraudulent login page, or (2) embedded URLs that link\ndirectly to the spoofed portal. The malicious attachments often have generic file names\nincluding “new_attached.html”, “ fafsa_2018.pdf”, or “new_rule.html”, some of which, like the\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) PDF example, will resonate particularly\nwith students.\n\nAfter entering their login credentials into the fraudulent login page, victims are often\nredirected to the genuine university login portal, at which point it simply appears that the\nlogin attempt failed. The stolen credentials are then sent to an external site controlled by the\nattacker, saved in a text file on the same server to be retrieved later, or emailed to inboxes\nthat are controlled by the phisher.\n\n## Silent Librarian\n\nTA407, also known as Silent Librarian, is another notable threat for students. The group was\nindicted by the FBI for its spear phishing campaigns that impersonate university library\nadministration in order to phish for students' login credentials. Ultimately, the group uses\nthese credentials to steal and resell intellectual property, journal subscription credentials, and\nmore.\n\nTA407 primarily targets universities and higher education institutions within the US with lowvolume (hundreds or thousands of messages), highly personalized campaigns. These\ncampaigns utilize well-crafted social engineering mechanisms including:\n\nStolen branding\nFake email signatures/credentials/addresses\nPersonalized email bodies/portal clones\nThemed subject lines (e.g., “Renewal of loaned items”, “Renew your loaned items”, and\n“Renewal of materials”)\n\nSince the beginning of 2019, Proofpoint researchers observed several TA407 campaigns\ndistributing phishing campaigns with clones of university library login pages. Although TA407\nhas made minor variations to its social engineering techniques and infrastructure, their\nstrategies have been rather consistent. Many of these campaigns use the same lures with\nminor variations in phrasing.\n\nA typical message contains a brief message that warns the student about overdue library\nmaterials or outdated library login credentials. The following figures are message bodies\nexcerpted from recent Silent Librarian campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Silent Librarian email message body template_\n\n_Figure 5: Silent Librarian “Renewal of Materials” message from early 2019_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Silent Librarian message with spoofed sender address and fake signature block_\n\nThe URLs in these messages link to cloned university login portals that use stolen branding\nand lookalike domains to manipulate recipients into disclosing their login credentials. After\nsubmitting credentials, victims are often redirected to the actual university library login page,\nleaving no indication that their information had just been phished.\n\nThe group is also known for leveraging local events and alerts to add legitimacy to their lures\nand time attacks to periods during which security and IT staffing may be minimal as shown in\nFigure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Fake university login portal with spoofed display name, stolen branding, and_\n_accurate weather forecast warning_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPhishing is one of the most prevalent types of threats that Proofpoint observes. Collectively,\nphishing campaigns account for millions of messages per year. Threat actors use stolen\nbranding and other social engineering mechanisms to manipulate victims into disclosing\npersonal data or login credentials. Phished credentials often serve as the foundation for\nbusiness email compromise, which is difficult to detect because affected accounts are\nlegitimate.\n\nTA407/Silent Librarian has proved to be a notable threat in the phishing landscape, using low\nvolume, highly targeted, socially engineered campaigns to steal students’ login credentials.\nThese campaigns affect hundreds of universities in the US.\n\nSignificantly, recent Proofpoint research revealed that the education sector is particularly\nvulnerable to attacks on cloud services with the highest success rates for unauthorized login\nattempts of any industry. This demonstrates the value of stolen credentials to threat actors\nand the broad attack surface inherent in university environments.\n\nAs a recommendation to mitigate these risks, we advise universities to:\n\n\n-----\n\nImplement comprehensive antivirus/anti-phishing services\nInstruct students on how to recognize malicious emails\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA) in university email systems, client devices,\nand application portals\nAdvise their students and faculty on how to:\n\nRecognize malicious emails that often rely on similar social engineering\ntechniques\nAvoid emails that contain typical indications of malicious intent:\n\nSpelling mistakes\nGrammatical issues\nUnsolicited requests for information\nSuspicious links that may spoof reputable domains\nReport suspected malicious emails to the university IT department\nAvoid interacting with suspicious messages, especially ones that request\npersonal information or prompt the student to log in to a university service\nBe aware of potential phishing attacks when threat actors, including TA407, are\nmost active:\n\nSeptember-November (Beginning of school year)\nJanuary-February (return from winter break)\nApril-June (conclusion of the school year)\n\n## References\n\n[1]https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/proofpoint-releases-q4-2018-threatreport-and-year-review\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
