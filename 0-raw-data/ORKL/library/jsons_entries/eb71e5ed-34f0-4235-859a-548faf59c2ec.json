Its victims are all involved with China’s foreign relations in some\nway, and are generally caught through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.\n\nOverall, the activities of this actor show that low investment and ready-made offensive\ntoolsets can be very effective when combined with high quality social engineering. We have\nseen more such open source toolset dependency with meterpreter and BeEF, and expect to\nsee this trend continue.\n\n## The Attack Method: Infection Vector\n\nDropping Elephant uses two main infection vectors that share a common, and fairly\nelaborately maintained, social engineering theme – foreign relations with China.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first approach involves spear-phishing targets using a document with remote content. As\nsoon as the user opens the document, a “ping” request is sent to the attackers’ server. At this\npoint, the attackers know the user has opened the document and send another spearphishing email, this time containing an MS Word document with an embedded executable.\nThe Word document usually exploits CVE-2012-0158. Sometimes the attackers send an MS\nPowerPoint document instead, which exploits CVE-2014-6352.\n\nOnce the payload is executed, an UPX packed AutoIT executable is dropped. Upon\nexecution, this downloads additional components from the attackers’ servers. Then the\nstealing of documents and data begins.\n\nThe second approach involves capturing victims through watering hole attacks. The actor\ncreated a website that downloads genuine news articles from other websites. If a website\nvisitor wants to view the whole article they would need to download a PowerPoint document.\nThis reveals the rest of the article, but also asks the visitor to download a malicious artifact.\n\nThe two main infection vectors are supported by other approaches. Sometimes, the\nattackers email out links to their watering hole websites. They also maintain Google+,\nFacebook and twitter accounts to develop relevant SEO and to reach out to wider targets.\nOccasionally, these links get retweeted, indiscriminately bringing more potential victims to\ntheir watering holes.\n\n## The Attack Tools\n\n### 1. Malware Analysis\n\nThe backdoor is usually UPX packed but still quite large in size. The reason for this is that\nmost of the file comprises meaningless overlay data, since the file is an automatically\ngenerated AutoIT executable with an AutoIT3 script embedded inside. Once started, it\ndownloads additional malware from the C2 and also uploads some basic system information,\nstealing, among other things, the user’s Google Chrome credentials. The backdoor also\npings the C2 server at regular intervals. A good security analyst can spot this while analyzing\nfirewall log files and thereby find out that something suspicious might be going on in the\nnetwork.\n\nGenerally speaking, backdoors download additional malware in the form of encrypted or\npacked executables/libraries. But, in the case of Dropping Elephant, the backdoor downloads\nencoded blobs that are then decoded to powershell command line “scripts”. These scripts\nare run and, in turn download the additional malware.\n\nOne of the more interesting malware samples downloaded is the file-stealer module. When\nthis file-stealer is executed, it makes another callback to the C2 server, downloading and\nexecuting yet another malware sample. It repeatedly attempts to iterate through directories\n\n\n-----\n\nand to collect files with the following extensions: doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx,\nand pdf. These files are then uploaded to the C2 server.\n\nAlso interesting are the resilient communications used by this group. Much like the known\nactors Miniduke or CommentCrew, it hides base64 encoded and encrypted control server\nlocations in comments on legitimate web sites. However, unlike the previous actors, the\nencrypted data provides information about the next hop, or the true C2 for the backdoor,\ninstead of initial commands.\n\n### 2. C2 Analysis\n\nIn many cases it was very difficult to get a good overview of the campaign and to find out\nhow successful it is. By combining KSN data with partner-provided C2 server data, we were\nable to obtain a much fuller picture of the incident.\n\nWe examined connections and attack logins to this particular C2. As it turned out, the\nattackers often logged in via a VPN, but sometimes via IPs belonging to an ordinary ISP in\nIndia. We then looked at the time the attackers were active, of which you can find an image\nbelow.\n\n## Victim Profile and Geography\n\nWe also wanted to get a better idea of the geolocation of most visitors. Analysis of the image\nprovided access counts and times, along with the IP of the visiting system.\n\nNoteworthy are the many IPs located in China. This focus on China-related foreign relations\nwas apparent from the ongoing social engineering themes that were constant throughout the\nattacks. The concentration of visits from CN (People’s Republic of China) could be for a\n\n\n-----\n\nvariety of reasons – diplomatic staff are visiting these sites from their CN offices, CN\nacademics and analysts are very interested in researching what they believe to be CNfocused think tanks, or some of the IPs are unknown and not self-identifying as bots or\nscrapers. Regardless, because we were able to determine that multiple targets are\ndiplomatic and governmental entities, these foreign relations efforts are likely to represent\nthe main interest of the attackers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCampaigns do not always need to be technically advanced to be successful. In this case, a\nsmall group reusing exploit code, some powershell-based malware and mostly social\nengineering has been able to steal sensitive documents and data from victims since at least\nNovember 2015.\n\nOur analysis of the C2 server confirmed the high profile of most victims, mainly based in the\nAsian region and specially focused on Chinese interests. Actually, some hints suggest the\ngroup has been successful enough to have recently expanded its operations, perhaps after\nproving its effectiveness and the value of the data stolen.\n\nThis is quite worrying, especially given the fact that no 0 days or advanced techniques were\nused against such high profile targets. Simply applying software patches will prevent attacks\nbased on old exploits, as well as training in the most basic social engineering attacks.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that in this case Microsoft´s patch for exploit CVE-2014-1761\njust warns the user not to allow the execution of the suspicious file.\n\nDropping Elephant artifacts are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as:\n\nExploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.*\n\nExploit.MSWord.CVE-2014-1761.*\n\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.Genome.*\n\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\n\nAs usual Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and\nhelp to mitigate the threat.
