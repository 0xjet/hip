    "plain_text": "# The Next Generation of Info Stealers\n\n**ke-la.com/information-stealers-a-new-landscape/**\n\nJuly 13, 2022\n\nIn recent years, information-stealing Trojans have become a very popular attack vector. This\ntype of malware is used for harvesting saved information on machines including usernames\nand passwords (“logs”) which are further sold on automated botnet marketplaces such as\nRussianMarket, TwoEasy, and Genesis, or privately. If purchased by threat actors, these\ncredentials pose a significant risk to an organization, as they allow actors to access various\nresources which may result in data exfiltration, lateral movement, and malware deployment,\nsuch as ransomware.\n\nSome of the most popular info-stealers advertised on cybercrime forums and identified on\nthese marketplaces are RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar. While some of these commodity\nstealers remain relevant, KELA observed that the threat landscape started to change under\nvarious conditions. The Russia-Ukraine war, the info-stealer operators’ need to improve\nmalware capabilities, and their financial motivation, resulted in new stealers and services\nbecoming available.\n\nThis report focuses on the currently active information stealers, highlighting the evolution of\nthe old stealers, as well as the debut of new ones.\n\n## Diversification of Stealers\n\n\n-----\n\nChanges in the threat landscape, as listed above, have determined a more evident\ndiversification of stealers. While some of the well-known commodity information stealers\ncontinue to stay relevant for threat actors and be observed in malicious campaigns, other\noptions, such as private stealers, have also become available. Commodity information\nstealers refers to malware and tools that are widely available for purchase on cybercrime\nforums and markets, thus used by a wide range of threat actors. Private information stealers,\non the other hand, refers to customized malware that is not made available to all threat\nactors, mostly to avoid being widely spread and losing the capability to remain undetected by\nsecurity tools.\n\nIn this chapter, KELA highlights both the journey of commodity stealers and how they\nevolved and changed over time, and the newly advertised private stealers.\n\n## The Journey of Commodity Stealers\n\n RedLine Stealer\n\nRedLine has been advertised and sold on various cybercrime forums since early 2020. For\ninstance, threat actor Glade aka REDGlade, potentially one of the RedLine developers, first\nannounced the stealer in February 2020 on the WWH Club and BHF forums and the\nTelegram channel. The RedLine stealer is still being sold for USD150 per month or for\nUSD800 for the “pro” unlimited version.\n\nThe information-stealing malware seems to maintain its popularity among threat actors, a\nfact confirmed by the number of infected machines listed on marketplaces. For instance, the\nTwoEasy marketplace currently has around 575,000 bots available for sale, out of which over\n[55% are machines infected with RedLine. When compared with KELA’s analysis on](https://ke-la.com/2easy-logs-marketplace-on-the-rise/)\nDecember 21, 2021, this seems to be a continuing trend for the info-stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n_User Glade introduces RedLine Stealer. Source: WWH Club_\n\nAs more and more users are anxiously looking to acquire the RedLine software, complaints\nhave been recorded regarding the delays in the support chat.\n\n_User complaining about delays. Source: WWH Club_\n\nA common tactic observed among users is to try the “cracked” free versions for testing\npurposes, to avoid purchasing the software, however, with less successful outcomes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: XSS_\n\n_User claiming that the logs obtained with the “cracked” version are also sent to others. Source: BHF_\n\nWhile RedLine still remains relevant, it is evident that the information stealer is not fulfilling\nthe expectations of all users, therefore some of them choose to look for alternatives.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Distribution of bots offered for sale in Russian Market in January 2022 – July 2022, by stealer, as collected_\n_by KELA’s systems_\n\n## Raccoon Stealer\n\nRaccoon stealer was among the recommendations for users willing to leave RedLine. The\ninformation stealer was offered for rent for USD200 per month for basic use plus USD50 for\nadditional services. However, on March 25, 2022, the operators announced that, after three\nyears of activity, they are suspending the project due to the loss of their developer during\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine (“the special operation”). They stated that the project will return\nin an optimized form in a few months.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: XSS_\n\nSeveral users expressed their disappointment following Raccoon’s decision to suspend the\noperations stating that they are looking forward to their return, while others started searching\nfor other options.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: WWH Club_\n\nOn June 2, 2022, the actors behind Raccoon Stealer claimed they developed version 2.0 of\ntheir malware. On June 30, 2022, threat actors behind the Raccoon Stealer officially\nreleased its 2.0 version.\n\n## Mars Stealer\n\nAlthough threat actors may be loyal to their providers, the business must go on. KELA\nobserved the MarsTeam – developers of the Mars stealer – claiming on the XSS forum that\nmany Raccoon users switched to the Mars stealer, even prior to Raccoon suspending their\noperations. The Mars stealer, first advertised on June 21, 2021, is being offered for USD140\nper month or USD800 as a lifetime subscription.\n\n_Auto-translated from Russian. Source: XSS_\n\nBased on the above screenshot, the Mars stealer seemed to be a promising stealer to\nreplace Raccoon, however, at the beginning of April 2022, KELA observed several\ncomplaints from users on XSS who stated that the Mars operators were not responsive. On\n\n\n-----\n\nApril 16, threat actor JohnCrystall opened a dispute, claiming that, upon making a purchase,\nMarsTeam failed to provide the requested tools. Upon these allegations, on April 17, the\nforum’s administrator banned the MarsTeam account and marked them as “scammers”.\n\nAs of now, there is no recent activity from MarsTeam, and some users suggested that the\noperations may have been affected by the invasion in Ukraine, however, the reason remains\nunclear.\n\n_Translation from Russian: The “scam” status is set. If the defendant appears and settles the claim, we will_\n_consider the possibility of removing the status. This is not the first complaint, people have already written_\n_to me, complained. Source: XSS_\n\n## Vidar Stealer\n\nVidar was first introduced in November 2018 and remains one of the most popular and used\ninformation stealers. The operators maintain a support Telegram channel @Vidar_supwwh\nwhere they sell the software for USD1500 and offer additional installation services. KELA\nalso identified Vidar in recent bots on RussianMarket and TwoEasy.\n\nOn April 25, 2022, KELA observed several actors on the Exploit forum complaining about the\nstealer’s capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: Exploit_\n\nMoreover, on April 26 and 27, 2022, users stated that the Vidar Telegram support team is not\nresponsive. This seems to be a pattern in some of the commodity stealers services and it is\nyet to be determined if Vidar stealer will continue to be a primary choice for threat actors.\n\n_Source: Exploit_\n\n## BlackGuard Stealer\n\nAs cybercriminals are constantly testing the capabilities of such malicious tools, they do not\nshy away from demanding more quality and improvements. One example in this regard is the\nBlackGuard stealer, launched in early 2021. KELA came across several recent discussions\nin which users were complaining about BlackGuard not being able to properly avoid\ndetection. As in any business, the operators promised to provide an updated version in no\ntime.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation from Russian: Guys, the cleaning is almost finished in the coming days, most likely after the_\n_weekend I will write to everyone and start issuing the already cleaned builds. (…) Added more reliable_\n_obfuscation of the main link to the panel and the link that is responsible for transferring information to the_\n_panel, both are obfuscated with different keys. Source: XSS_\n\n## Private Stealers\n\nThe previous chapter showed that some of the well-known commodity stealer operators,\nalthough present in the cybercrime ecosystem for a long time, may encounter difficulties in\nthe way they conduct business, which leaves their customers unsatisfied. As the threat\nlandscape is constantly changing, other threat actors may find new financial opportunities in\ndeveloping “private stealers”, either by using the source code of commodity stealers or by\ncreating brand-new ones. KELA has observed several such stealers being advertised on\ncybercrime forums and researchers also confirmed them being actively exploited in the wild.\n\n## META Stealer\n\nOn March 7, 2022, KELA observed a threat actor named _META_ announcing the launch of\nMETA – a new information-stealing malware, available for sale for USD125 per month or\nUSD1000 for unlimited use. The actor claimed it has the same functionality, code, and panel\nas the Redline stealer, but with several improvements:\n\n_1) Removed unnecessary functionality from the panel_\n\n_2) Added setting for collecting extensions from the browser_\n\n_3) Added the Reset default settings button, which allows you to return the default settings of_\n_the panel if you suddenly need it_\n\n_4) Cleaned stub_\n\n_5) Changed the color scheme of the panel_\n\n_6) Removed AntiCNG_\n\n\n-----\n\n_7) Added the ability to view the private key for the generator (needed for auto-build in your_\n_bots for the team), to view it, you must re-enter the password from the panel (2FA, not to_\n_steal the key)_\n\n_8) The weight of the build is reduced to 88KB, thanks to the new stub_\n\n_9) Cleaned build runtime_\n\n_User _META_ announcing the META stealer. Source WWH Club_\n\nKELA also identified the stealer in several bots sold on the TwoEasy botnet marketplace and\ncan confirm its similarities with Redline based on the folder’s structure. As of now, there are\naround 1200 bots containing the META strain available for sale on the TwoEasy market.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bot sample infected with Meta stealer malware.

Based on the findings, the malicious files are\ndistributed via phishing emails.\n\n## Arkei Stealer\n\n[In February 2022, researchers observed new variants of the Arkei malware – an information](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/02/threat-thursday-arkei-infostealer)\nstealer focused on collecting, among others, 2FA or MFA data from its victims. Arkei has also\nbeen previously seen in the wild and advertised on cybercrime forums, and it now has\nimproved its malware capabilities. The malware only targets Windows-operating machines\nand their initial attack vector may vary, however it has been recently seen deployed from\nphishing websites offering malicious software masquerading as legitimate applications and\nprograms.\n\n[Arkei was observed being deployed by SmokeLoader aka Dofoil – a malware downloader](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0226/)\ninitially observed in 2011 and used to deliver other malware via email attachments in\nphishing campaigns. Later, the [malware was seen delivering information stealers including](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/malware-masquerades-privacy-tool)\nRaccoon and RedLine. Since the beginning of 2022, KELA has observed several actors on\ncybercrime forums interested in purchasing SmokeLoader.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Threat actor willing to purchase SmokeLoader.

The malware\ncan exfiltrate credentials, steal cryptocurrency wallet information, and perform crypto mining.\n[According to researchers, the ZingoStealer is currently being distributed under the guise of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/04/haskers-gang-zingostealer.html)\n[game cheats, cracks, and code generators. In several cases, ZingoStealer also delivers](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/04/haskers-gang-zingostealer.html)\nadditional malware such as the RedLine Stealer. On April 13, 2022, HaskersGang\nannounced on their Telegram channel that an updated version of the bot has been released\nand that they are transferring the ownership to user CryptoGinzo, as the previous “owner” –\npart of the HaskersGang – is no longer involved in the operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation from Russian: We are pleased to present to you our free product that can freely compete with\n_other projects – @ginzostealer_bot (…). Source: Telegram_\n\n_Translation from Russian:_ _Attention! We have updated our bot! You need to enter /start again to update_\n_the bot. A little about recent events: the stealer is now owned by @CryptoGinzo, the previous owner is no_\n_longer involved in the stealer. At the moment, the project is in good hands, I declare this with confidence –_\n_Keepye. Source: Telegram._\n\n## Eternity Stealer\n\nEternity Stealer was announced by EternityTeam on the XSS forum on March 26, 2022. The\nstealer is able to gather passwords, cookies, tokens, history, bookmarks, credit card and\ncrypto-wallet information from the infected machines. It works on a variety of browsers,\npassword managers, VPN and FTP clients, email clients and messengers, and gaming\nsoftware.\n\nUsers can create and customize the stealer through a web builder with options such as\npreventing second start from one computer (AntiRepeat), enabling AntiVM, self-destruction\nupon execution, preventing execution in CIS countries, as well as selection the preferred\noutput file execution. The builder price is USD300 for a lifetime subscription and USD320\nwith crypt included.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: XSS_\n\n## 7.62mm Private Stealer\n\nOn April 25, 2022, KELA observed threat actor Shamel advertising a new private stealer –\n7.62mm – on the XSS forum. The actor stated that they will sell only two copies to prevent\nmass usage and wide antivirus detection. Based on the post, the 7.62mm stealer is, as of\ndate, undetectable, and can target crypto wallets such as Ethereum, Exodus, Bitcoin Core,\nArmory, wallet browser extensions including Binance, Coinbase, Phantom, browsers such as\nChrome, Mozilla, Opera, Edge, Waterfox, as well as sessions of client applications including\nTelegram, Steam, Minecraft, FileZilla.\n\nThe stealer is sold in two formats – DLL or EXE and the actor also provides a search engine\nfor the “logs” obtained. The price for unlimited use is USD500.\n\n_Threat actor Shamel advertising the 7.62mm private stealer. Source: XSS_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Inno Stealer\n\nOn April 18, 2022, [researchers revealed that cybercriminals are using a malicious website](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unofficial-windows-11-upgrade-installs-info-stealing-malware/)\noffering fake Windows 11 upgrades. Users are lured into downloading an ISO file that\ncontains the executable for the new Inno information-stealing malware. The stealer’s\ncapabilities include collecting web browser cookies and stored credentials, data in\ncryptocurrency wallets, and data from the filesystem. Researchers stated that although this is\nthe typical activity for stealers, Inno does not have any code similarities to other known\ninformation-stealers. This is an advantage of such private stealers that allows for a limited\nnumber of users to deploy the malware and reduces the chances of detection.\n\n## Info-stealers’ “affiliate programs”\n\nTo ensure good business development and to facilitate the use of their products, informationstealer operators started to offer additional tools and services. KELA also observed threat\nactors looking for users to help test their products prior to their release, to speed up the\ndeveloping process.\n\nParticularly interesting are info-stealers’ “affiliate programs”: KELA observed various groups\nadvertising new so-called “traffer kits/sets” – an operational structure where interested users\n(“traffers” – related to the word traffic, potentially referring to actors who have the means to\ninfect multiple targets) are provided with the necessary tools including the information stealer\nbuild, channels to exfiltrate the data, software to exploit the obtained logs, and technical\nsupport, in exchange for various deals. For instance, some would require affiliates to pay a\nfee in exchange for access to the kit and full ownership of the obtained logs, while others\nwould request a percentage of the logs.\n\n## TigersTeam\n\nOn April 1, 2022, TigersTeam introduced its information-stealer services: “The best stealer on\nthe market – RedLine; free promotion for active “traffers”; automatic issuance of crypto build;\necho channel (logs coming in); excellent and helpful colleagues; all logs are yours! We work\nout only the crypt – 80% to you!”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: BHF_\n\nOn April 14, upon being banned from the BHF forum, the TigersTeam offered to sell their\nteam of “traffers” for USD300. The deal would include all related channels, RedLine stealer +\n“dedik” (dedicated server), the bot script, and over 200 people in the team.\n\n_Source: BHF_\n\n## Aurora Project\n\nOn April 18, 2022, KELA observed actor cheshire666 on the WWH Club forum who\nintroduced themselves as a coder for the “Aurora project” looking for 3-5 people to beta test\ntheir product before the final release. The actor promised that those who will take an active\npart in finding bugs or improving the project will be awarded a free subscription for a month.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe product would consist of:\n\n_1) Builder (with the possibility of polymorphic compilation and compression)_\n\n_2) Stealer_\n\n_3) Clipper BTC, ETH, LTC_\n\n_4) The botnet is located on a shared dedicated server and has spare servers for migration_\n\n_5) If the server is unavailable, the bots will automatically start searching for a new server_\n\n_6) 2FA via Telegram_\n\n_Actor cheshire666 looking for testers for the “Aurora project”.

KELA\nexpects to see more and more changes around information-stealers, their capabilities, and\nthe instances in which they are being leveraged.\n\n\n-----",
