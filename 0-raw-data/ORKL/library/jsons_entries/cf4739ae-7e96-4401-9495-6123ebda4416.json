    "plain_text": "# Iranian agents blackmailed BBC reporter with ‘naked photo’ threats\n\n**arabnews.com/node/1195681/media**\n\nElise Knutsen November 18, 2017\n\nLONDON: Iranian agents blackmailed a BBC Persian journalist by threatening to publish\nrevealing photos of her as part of a wider campaign against the British media outlet, staff at\nthe broadcaster told Arab News.\n\nNew details emerged on Saturday about alleged harassment of BBC Persian reporters’\nfamily members and loved ones at the hands of the Iranian security services.\n\nNegin Shiraghaei, a BBC Persian anchor, told The Times that her elderly father, who has\nstage-four cancer, had been interrogated by the security services. Rana Rahimpour, a\npresenter, also said that her parents were brought in for questioning on multiple occasions by\nIranian authorities.\n\nAnother BBC Persian presenter told Arab News she had been blackmailed by Iranian\nagents, who threatened to spread rumors about her sex life and compromising pictures. The\ntawdry tactics had also been used against men, the reporter said, declining to be named due\nto security concerns. A fake news story about the sexual misconduct of another BBC Persian\npresenter had been widely disseminated by Iranian agents, she added.\n\n“If they want to make women silenced, they just threaten, (saying) ‘OK, we are publishing\nstories about your sex life’,” the reporter said.\n\nThe reporter told Arab News that Iranian agents had raided her family’s home in Tehran\n\n\n-----\n\nconfiscating a number of cameras and laptops, and arresting a family member.\nThat’s when the menacing Facebook messages started.\n“I got many threatening messages on Facebook and social media from different people\nsaying that (a family member) was arrested and ‘we found many photos of you — if you don’t\ncooperate with the Iranian intelligence we are going to (publish them),” she told Arab News.\nThe journalist said she did not know what, if any, intimate photos the Iranian intelligence\nservices have of her, but decried the ploy as “very dirty.”\nThe smear campaign was intended as leverage to pressure her into resigning from her job\nas a reporter with BBC Persian, she said. Failing that, she said, the intelligence services\nwanted her to provide them information about the British news organization.\nBlackmail is just part of a string of tactics the Iranian authorities have allegedly used to\npressure BBC Persian employees. Family members and friends of BBC Persian staffers,\nincluding the elderly and ill, have been arrested and interrogated, according to reports.\nAccording to an internal survey of 96 BBC Persian employees, 44 had been accused of\nsexual impropriety while the vast majority, 86, reported being harassed. Almost half said their\nparents had been questioned by authorities in Iran.\nIran has ratcheted up its campaign against BBC Persian reporters and their families since\nthe contested 2009 presidential election.\nWhile BBC Persian is technically banned in Iran, the broadcasts draw listeners eager to hear\nnews updates that have not been filtered through the regime’s official channels. According to\nthe BBC, 13 million Iranians tune into the marquee World Service broadcast despite the\nofficial injunction.\nLast month, the Iranian government initiated a criminal probe into many of the journalists\nworking for BBC Persian in London, accusing them of conspiracy against the country’s\nnational security. Over the summer, the Iranian judiciary froze the assets of more than 150\nBBC Persian staffers because of their work with the British broadcaster.\nThe experiences of the BBC Persian staffers and their families — who have been subjected\nto violence, threats or indignities by the Iranian authorities — have been decried by the BBC.\nTony Hall, director general of the BBC, has called the campaign an “unprecedented collective\npunishment of journalists who are simply doing their jobs.”\nOfficials at the Iranian Embassy in London did not immediately respond to requests for\ncomment.\n\n© 2022 SAUDI RESEARCH & PUBLISHING COMPANY, All Rights Reserved And subject to\nTerms of Use Agreement.\n\n\n-----",
