Known victims include healthcare providers, pharmaceuticals, IT\n\n solution providers for healthcare and equipment manufacturers that serve the healthcare\n\n industry, likely for the purpose of corporate espionage.\n\n\n###### \"Orangeworm installs the Kwampirs custom backdoor in large firms in the healthcare sector in the U.S., Europe & Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sights set on healthcare\n\n###### Based on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets randomly or\n\n conduct opportunistic hacking. Rather, the group appears to choose its targets carefully\n\n and deliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before launching an attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 1. Nearly 40 percent of Orangeworm’s victims operate within the healthcare industry\n\n\n###### According to Symantec telemetry, almost 40 percent of Orangeworm’s confirmed victim\n\n organizations operate within the healthcare industry.

Orangeworm’s secondary targets include Manufacturing, Information\n\n Technology, Agriculture, and Logistics. While these industries may appear to be unrelated,\n\n we found them to have multiple links to healthcare, such as large manufacturers that\n\n produce medical imaging devices sold directly into healthcare firms, IT organizations that\n\n\n-----\n\n### Post-compromise activities\n\n###### Once Orangeworm has infiltrated a victim’s network, they deploy Trojan.Kwampirs, a\n\n backdoor Trojan that provides the attackers with remote access to the compromised\n\n computer.\n\n When executed, Kwampirs decrypts and extracts a copy of its main DLL payload from its\n\n resource section. Before writing the payload to disk, it inserts a randomly generated string\n\n into the middle of the decrypted payload in an attempt to evade hash-based detections.\n\n To ensure persistence, Kwampirs creates a service with the following configuration to\n\n ensure that the main payload is loaded into memory upon system reboot:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### computer including some basic network adapter information, system version information,\n\n and language settings.\n\n Orangeworm likely uses this information to determine whether the system is used by a\n\n researcher or if the victim is a high-value target. Once Orangeworm determines that a\n\n potential victim is of interest, it proceeds to aggressively copy the backdoor across open\n\n network shares to infect other computers. \n\n It may copy itself to the following hidden file shares:\n\n ADMIN$\n\n C$WINDOWS\n\n D$WINDOWS\n\n E$WINDOWS\n\n### Information gathering\n\n###### At this point, the attackers proceed to gather as much additional information about the\n\n victim’s network as possible including any information pertaining to recently accessed\n\n\n-----\n\n###### present on the compromised computer.\n\n We have observed the attackers executing the following commands within victim\n\n environments:\n\n\n-----\n\n### No concern about being discovered\n\n###### Kwampirs uses a fairly aggressive means to propagate itself once inside a victim's network\n\n by copying itself over network shares. While this method is considered somewhat old, it\n\n may still be viable for environments that run older operating systems such as Windows XP.\n\n This method has likely proved effective within the healthcare industry, which may run\n\n legacy systems on older platforms designed for the medical community. Older systems like\n\n Windows XP are much more likely to be prevalent within this industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### the C&Cs are active and continue to beacon until a successful connection is established.\n\n Despite modifying a small part of itself while copying itself across the network as a means\n\n to evade detection, the operators have made no effort to change the C&C communication\n\n protocol since its first inception.\n\n Both of these methods are considered particularly “noisy” and may indicate that\n\n Orangeworm is not overly concerned with being discovered. The fact that little has changed\n\n with the internals of Kwampirs since its first discovery may also indicate that previous\n\n mitigation methods against the malware have been unsuccessful, and that the attackers\n\n have been able to reach their intended targets despite defenders being aware of their\n\n presence within their network.\n\n##### Kwampirs uses a fairly aggressive means to\n\n propagate itself once inside a victim's\n\n network by copying itself over network\n\n# “\n##### shares.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### While Orangeworm is known to have been active for at least several years, we do not\n\n believe that the group bears any hallmarks of a state-sponsored actor—it is likely the work\n\n of an individual or a small group of individuals. There are currently no technical or\n\n operational indicators to ascertain the origin of the group.\n\n### Protection\n\n###### Symantec customers are protected against Orangeworm and Symantec has also made\n\n efforts to notify identified targets of its operations.\n\n Customers with Intelligence Services or WebFilter-enabled products are protected against\n\n activity associated with the Orangeworm group.
