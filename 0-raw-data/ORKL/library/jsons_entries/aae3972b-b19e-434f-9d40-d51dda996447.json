These templates include those for Google Chrome](https://github.com/mrd0x/BITB)\nfor Windows and Mac and dark and light mode variants.\n\n**Example BitB Chrome phishing windows for Facebook**\n\n_Source: mr.d0x_\nmr.d0x told BleepingComputer that the templates are very simple to use in creating\nconvincing Chrome windows to display single sign-on login forms for any online platform.\n\nThe researcher said that redteamers could simply download the templates, edit them to\ncontain the desired URL and Window title, and then use an iframe to display the login form.\n\nIt is also possible to add the HTML for the login form directly into the template, but mr.d0x\ntold BleepingComputer that you would need to align the form properly using CSS and HTML.\n\n[Kuba Gretzky, the creator of the](https://twitter.com/mrgretzky) [Evilginx phishing toolkit, tested the new method and showed](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2)\nhow it worked perfectly with the Evilginx platform, meaning it could be adapted to steal 2FA\nkeys during phishing attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpoofing the reverse-proxied Sec-Fetch-Dest value to document worked like a charm\nand it's beautiful\n\nEvilginx loves it!\n\n[Kudos again to @mrd0x](https://twitter.com/mrd0x?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/ODjblvNvho](https://t.co/ODjblvNvho)\n\n— Kuba Gretzky (@mrgretzky) [March 15, 2022](https://twitter.com/mrgretzky/status/1503864129488142343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nmr.d0x told BleepingComputer that this is not a new technique and that Zscaler reported it\nbeing used by fake gaming sites in 2020 to steal Steam credentials.\n\nHuh, looks like Steam scams are evolving. Someone tried phishing me with this really\nclever fake Steam login page earlier today, which mostly failed because I opened the\nwindow on my small second monitor. Watch out, everyone.\n[pic.twitter.com/npGbmAqjgH](https://t.co/npGbmAqjgH)\n\n[— TheAppleFreak (@theaaplfreak) January 5, 2020](https://twitter.com/theaaplfreak/status/1213961057217196032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHowever, now that premade templates for fake Chrome windows are available, redteamers\ncan use them to create convincing phishing sign-in forms to test the defense of their clients\nor their own company's employees.\n\nFor those who wish to try out the new Browser in the Browser phishing attack, you can grab\nthe [templates from GitHub.](http://github.com/mrd0x/BITB)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Intuit warns of QuickBooks phishing threatening to suspend accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intuit-warns-of-quickbooks-phishing-threatening-to-suspend-accounts/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[Screencastify Chrome extension flaws allow webcam hijacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/screencastify-chrome-extension-flaws-allow-webcam-hijacks/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Phishing websites now use chatbots to steal your credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-websites-now-use-chatbots-to-steal-your-credentials/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
