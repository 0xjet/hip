You may\nhave the most up to date cyber security software, but when the software you are trusting to\nkeep you protected gets infected there is a problem. A backdoor, inserted into legitimate\ncode by a third party with malicious intent, leads to millions of people being hacked and\ntheir information stolen.\n\nAvast’s CCleaner software had a backdoor encoded into it by someone who had access to\nthe supply chain. Through somewhere that had access to the source code of CCleaner, the\nmain executable in v5.33.6162 had been modified to include a backdoor. The official\nstatement from Avast can be found [here](https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident)\n\n**The Big Connection:**\n\n\n-----\n\nCostin Raiu, director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab, was the first\nto find a code connection between APT17 and the backdoor in the infected CCleaner:\n\n[The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CCleaner?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nof the APT groups from the [#Axiom APT 'umbrella'.](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Axiom?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[— Costin Raiu (@craiu) September 19, 2017](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/910059453948579840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nUsing [Intezer Analyze™, we were able to verify the shared code between the backdoor](https://www.intezer.com//intezer-analyze/)\nimplanted in CCleaner and earlier APT17 samples. The photo below is the result of\n[uploading the CCBkdr module to Intezer Analyze™, where the results show there is an](https://www.intezer.com//intezer-analyze/)\noverlap in code. With our technology, we can compare code to a huge database of\nmalicious and trusted software — that’s how we can prove that this code has never been\nseen before in any other software.\n\nA deeper analysis leads us to the functions shown below. The code in question is a unique\nimplementation of base64 only previously seen in APT17 and not in any public repository,\nwhich makes a strong case about attribution to the same threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis code connection is huge news. APT17, also known as Operation Aurora, is one of the\nmost sophisticated cyber attacks ever conducted and they specialize in supply chain\nattacks. In this case, they probably were able to hack CCleaner’s build server in order to\nplant this malware. Operation Aurora started in 2009 and to see the same threat actor still\nactive in 2017 could possibly mean there are many other supply chain attacks by the same\ngroup that we are not aware of. The previous attacks are attributed to a Chinese group\ncalled PLA Unit 61398.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nThe infected CCleaner file that begins the analysis is from\n6f7840c77f99049d788155c1351e1560b62b8ad18ad0e9adda8218b9f432f0a9\n\nA technical analysis was posted by Talos here\n[(http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/avast-distributes-malware.html).](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/avast-distributes-malware.html)\n\nThe flow-graph of the malicious CCleaner is as follows (taken from the Talos report):\n\n\n-----\n\nInfected function:\n\n\n-----\n\nLoad and execute the payload code:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the embedded code is decrypted and executed, the next step is a PE (portable\nexecutable) file loader. A PE file loader basically emulates the process of what happens\nwhen you load an executable file on Windows. Data is read from the PE header, from a\nmodule created by the malware author.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PE loader first begins by resolving the addresses of imports commonly used by loaders\nand calling them. GetProcAddress to get the addresses of external necessary functions,\nLoadLibraryA to load necessary modules into memory and get the address of the location of\nthe module in memory, VirtualAlloc to create memory for somewhere to copy the memory,\nand in some cases, when not implemented, and memcpy to copy the buffer to the newly\nallocated memory region.\n\nAfter the module is copied to memory, to load it properly, the proper loading procedure is\nexecuted. The relocation table is read to adjust the module to the base address of the\nallocated memory region, the import table is read, the necessary libraries are loaded, and\nthe import address table is filled with the correct addresses of the imports. Next, the entire\n\n\n-----\n\nPE header is overwritten with 0 s, a mechanism to destroy the PE header tricking security\nsoftware into not realizing this module is malicious, and after the malicious code begins\nexecution.\n\nThe main module does the following:\n\n1. Tries an anti-debug technique using time and IcmpSendEcho to wait\n\n2. Collect data about the computer (Operating system, computer name, DNS domain,\nrunning processes, etc)\n\n3. Allocates memory for payload to retrieve from C&C server\n\n4. Contacts C&C server at IP address 216.126.225.148\n\na. If this IP address is unreachable, uses a domain generation algorithm and uses a\ndifferent domain depending on the month and year\n\n5. Executes code sent by C&C\n\nBy the time of the analysis, we were unable to get our hands on the code sent by the C&Cs.\n\nIf you would like to analyze the malware yourself, you may refer to my tweet.\n\n[#ccleaner malware DLL w/ IAT fix](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ccleaner?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [https://t.co/FprmtmkV64](https://t.co/FprmtmkV64) [https://t.co/dgWiQVd31k](https://t.co/dgWiQVd31k)\n[@TalosSecurity](https://twitter.com/TalosSecurity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@malwrhunterteam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/TxsbveFoHJ](https://t.co/TxsbveFoHJ)\n\n[— Jay Rosenberg (@jaytezer) September 18, 2017](https://twitter.com/jaytezer/status/909807005266825216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Jay Rosenberg**\n\n\n-----",
