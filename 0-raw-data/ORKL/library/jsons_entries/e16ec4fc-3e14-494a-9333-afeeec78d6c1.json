This raised questions about the usage and impact of\n“digital weapons” within the security community, even though wipers themselves weren’t\nnew. The infamous Shamoon wiper dates back more than a decade ago. How can it be that\nwipers were as effective a decade ago as they are in the present day? What has changed?\nAnd what remains the same?\n\nThis blog will include an analysis of more than twenty recent wiper families, their trends,\ntechniques, and overlap with other wipers. Reused code and techniques may link several\nwipers to the same actor, although the mere presence of such a link often leads to a hasty\nconclusion. This is not a generic, run-of-the-mill comparison of malware families, as it\nincludes technical aspects of the analyzed wipers, along with a focus on both the high- and\nlow-level aspects of the destructive software.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis analysis does not only focus on the wipers used against Ukrainian victims, but also\nmore generic wipers that were found in the wild around the same time. The parallels and\ndifferences between the targeted and generic wipers provide several interesting insights.\n\nTo conclude, defensive tips with regards to wipers will be given, allowing anyone to reduce\nthe impact of future wiper related incidents.\n\nBefore diving into the topic, I’d like to thank all researchers and their organizations for their\nopenness and willingness to share these reports publicly, allowing both the general public\nand other researchers to work with their analysis, rather than duplicating efforts.\n\n### Fear, uncertainty, and doubt\n\nBefore moving on to the wipers, a brief word about the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (often\nabbreviated as FUD) which is used in some reports. Earlier this year, we briefly touched on\n[this subject in our War, Weapons, and Wipers blog. Elaborating on this, the expressed](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/war-weapons-and-wipers.html)\nurgency and impact of digital attacks and the subsequently used malware varies per\nsource, but hot takes are often made during times of crises. If the majority of malware\ncampaigns are met with such fearmongering, the eventual effect will be detrimental. In\nshort, [to cry wolf: claiming all campaigns are equally impactful for everybody can limit the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf)\nresponse from organizations, thus limiting the effect of the warnings overall.\n\nThis is not to say that urgent calls regarding malware campaigns are always spreading fear,\nuncertainty, and doubt. It is meant to say that context and nuance are crucial, especially\nwhen tensions are high.\n\n### Defining wipers\n\nIt is important to clearly specify what a wiper is, as the definition isn’t set in stone. The more\ntraditional definition refers to malware with the intent to cripple the victim’s system. Malware\nwith multiple features can also be used to destroy a system using a wiper component.\n\nThere is, however, also an unintended wiper use case in some ransomware cases. If the\nransomware’s encryption is faulty, there is no recovery option, or if the threat actor who\ndeployed the ransomware cannot be reached, the ransomed system remains dysfunctional.\nIn some cases, the email addresses of actors are blocked, or their website is taken offline,\nwhich might make it impossible to obtain a decryption key.\n\nThird, a more obscure wiper variant: fake ransomware. Using ransomware as a cover, the\nmalware might pretend the system is ransomed, whereas there never was the intention to\ndecrypt the data in the first place. Properly encrypting a file system, as also noted in the\nparagraph above, is equal to wiping the data of said system, as it remains inaccessible in\nboth cases.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this blog, malware which has the intention to wipe a device is considered a wiper, be it as\na part of malware or as the malware’s sole purpose.\n\n### Wipers old and new\n\nA decade ago, the Shamoon wiper wreaked havoc within Saudi Aramco’s network as it\nwiped numerous machines. Over the past 10 years, security measures have greatly\nimproved, as have the adversarial tactics and techniques. The constant cat and mouse\ngame between blue teams and their adversaries now iterates faster than before. What once\nstarted with the physical mail of a new floppy to update a system can now be performed in\nnear real-time. And yet, old techniques prove to be valuable, even if only for a short period\nof time. Afterall, attackers don’t need much time to capitalize.\n\n#### Achieving goals\n\nThe most important aspect of a wiper attack is to understand the goal and motive of the\nattack. While ransomware operators are generally financially motivated, wipers are used\ndifferently. There is no direct monetary benefit from wiping machines at corporations or\ngovernments. The benefits are often indirect, such as a competitive advantage as a\ncompetitor has been shut down, be it temporarily or permanently.\n\nThe term “competitor” in the paragraph above should be taken in a broad sense. It can\nmean someone who has a competing business, which the actor tries to distort with the help\nof illegal means. Another meaning can be a competitive business or government branch.\nUkraine is a prime example of the latter case, and one of the first cases where multiple\ndifferent wipers were used preceding and during a military invasion with the goal to help the\nattacker’s military.\n\nFigure 1 - A timeline of wiper occurrences, ranging from January through April in 2022\n\nWhile some of the wipers in the timeline above were attributed to Russia, some of the\nwipers were made by activists, be it opponents or proponents of the war. One such example\n[is a NodeJS inter process communication package known as node-ipc, as observed by](https://snyk.io/blog/peacenotwar-malicious-npm-node-ipc-package-vulnerability/)\nSnyk. This package is commonly used, where the malicious version used to overwrite all\nfiles in the current project with the heart emoji if the user’s IP indicates their geolocation\nrefers to Russia. Additional changes, such as the inclusion of the peacenotwar package,\ncreated by the same user, have shown anti-war messages aimed towards Russia, such as\nthe one given below\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 - The activist's message, image courtesy of Snyk\n\nAside from activism, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) can utilize wipers to wreak havoc.\nMany of the wipers which targeted Ukrainian entities have been attributed to pro-Russian\nactors by a variety of security companies. The return-on-investment for a wiper can be high,\ngiven the low effort that is required to create one. However, not all wipers are created equal,\n[as some are more complex than others. HermeticWiper shows how its creator(s) got an](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/digging-into-hermeticwiper.html)\nunderstanding of NTFS and FAT file systems, iterating and altering the file system in a more\nadvanced manner than simply deleting or overwriting all encountered files. The images\nbelow show a segment of the NTFS parsing code within the wiper, before and after\nassigning the correct data types during the analysis. These structures aren’t included in\nmost analysis programs by default and take additional time to be found and created. The\nadditionally required time benefits the attackers, as their goal is to slow the defenders down\nas much as possible. The two images below show the “fileData” variable, first with raw\noffsets, and secondly with the applied structure names.\n\nFigure 3 - Pseudo code of NTFS related objects in HermeticWiper without the correct types\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 - Pseudo code of NTFS related objects in HermeticWiper with the correct types\n\nThe destruction of the file system, rather than files within the file system, makes it harder to\nsimply restore some files to “repair” the victimized machine. A complete back-up needs to\nbe restored instead, which takes more time, especially if this needs to be done in bulk.\n\n#### Target selection\n\nThe selection of the target(s) from an actor’s point of view mainly depends on two factors.\nFirst, the nature of the attack. Where APT groups are often inclined to remain undetected,\nactivists usually want to make their cause known, relying on the media to amplify their\nmessage.\n\nEven though the reasoning is different, there is a parallel to be drawn with regards to other\nmalware attacks where targeted attacks are carried out by more sophisticated groups.\nMassively spread malware is generally classified as commodity malware, and while both\ncan have a disastrous impact, their modus operandi of spreading varies.\n\nThe second factor is the targeted operating system. Windows is the most used platform for\ncorporate networks, whereas various Linux distributions are often used to host servers.\nWiping files from employee machines already impacts the functioning of a business and can\nbe done with little effort as it requires no escalation of privileges.\n\nMost of the wipers that were observed in this research target the Windows operating\nsystem. However, using a different platform as a defense against wipers is not a solution, as\nsome of the observed wipers target a very specific niche. Examples of such niches are the\n\n\n-----\n\nwiping of Viasat KA-SAT modems with the AcidRain wiper, as [reported by SentinelOne.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/)\n[Other examples are the Shred wipers, as observed by ESET, which target Linux](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)\ndistributions as well as the Solaris operating system.\n\n#### Delivery methods\n\nOne way or another, actors want to execute the malware of their choice on the victim’s\nmachine(s). There are numerous ways to do so, and the below is not meant as an\nexhaustive list, but rather the most seen methods that were used to deliver the wipers.\n\nOne execution strategy that has been observed is manual execution of the wipers, either\nper device or via the group policy to execute it on numerous machines at once. The\nHermeticWiper has been executed via a scheduled task on the victimized devices, as\n[reported by Symantec.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia)\n\nAdditionally, or alternatively, actors can create a worm-like spreading mechanism to execute\nthe wiper on all devices it can connect to. HermeticWizard has such a capability, which\ndeploys HermeticWiper, as [explained by ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\n\n#### Similarities and useful differences\n\nWhile some wipers contain overlap in the code, it’s not always a link to a specific actor. Two\nexamples where it is likely that the same actor is behind the code are the RURansom and\nits alleged development version dubbed dnWipe, and the two different versions of the\nCaddyWiper. The former two were [discovered by TrendMicro, whereas the latter was found](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/new-ruransom-wiper-targets-russia.html)\nby ESET.\n\nThe dnWipe sample, although it only base64 encodes files rather than wiping, has several\nto-be-implemented functions, one of which can be seen below.\n\nFigure 5 - dnWipe's lacking spread function\n\nThe RURansom wiper uses very similar code, which is unlikely to be copied from dnWipe\nby another actor due to its minimal spreading. The image below shows the implementation\nof the spread function.\n\nFigure 6 - RURansom's implemented spread function\n\n\n-----\n\nCaddyWiper was used twice. Where the two versions contain minor, yet useful, differences\nrelated to the used assembly instructions, the malware’s behavior hasn’t changed. The\ninitial version built the (wide) stack-strings character by character, as seen in the screenshot\nbelow.\n\nFigure 7 - The creation of a wide stack-string in CaddyWiper\n\nThe [second version, also originally observed by ESET and obtained after dumping it from](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)\nmemory, built the (wide) stack-strings using double words whenever possible, as shown in\nthe screenshot below. Note that both wide stack-strings are taken from the entry points of\nboth samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 - The creation of a wide stack-string in CaddyWiper II\nSuch minor (and likely compiler related) changes often indicate source code level access by\nwhoever compiled the malware. It is, however, easy to mistakenly attribute source code\nlevel access to the same actor. The code could have leaked, or could be widely available\n[within a nation state’s arsenal, as is the case with PlugX.](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/plugx-a-talisman-to-behold.html)\n\nNote that minor changes in the code might not always be related to source code access, as\nfiles can be patched to alter their behavior, as is the case with [WannaCry’s many edited](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/bitdefender-threat-debrief-february-2022)\nvariants still roaming around with edited kill switches, ready to permanently encrypt devices.\n\n#### Attribution, and difficulties thereof\n\nBased on the attribution issues that are described above, there is an observation to make:\nthe actor who uses the malware can be very different form the actor which creates the\nmalware. This is already seen when looking at ransomware affiliates, who use the\nransomware, but rarely write it themselves. With regards to nation state actors, it could very\nwell be possible for actors to contract software engineers to create a program for them. This\nwould make code-based attribution even harder than it already is, as different contractors\nhave vastly different coding styles, ranging from subtle nuances all the way to the usage of\ndifferent programming languages altogether.\n\nWhile there is no bullet proof evidence for this hypothesis, it does provide food for thought.\nNot all wipers look the same, though multiple were used in Ukraine, likely stemming from a\nsingle nation state with regards to geopolitical issues, even though code-based evidence is\n[lacking. As mentioned in June 2022, we observed an actor who intended to wipe the](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/growling-bears-make-thunderous-noise.html)\nsystems of a victim with the WhisperGate wiper, but failed in doing so. A second attempt\nused the HermeticWiper instead. Although this is only anecdotal evidence given the public\navailability of the wipers at the time, it is the exact scenario of the above-described\nhypothesis.\n\n#### Recovery options\n\n\n-----\n\nEven though the term wiper might lead one to assume that files are deleted from the\ntargeted system, this isn’t necessarily the case. The wiper’s goal is to cripple the system,\nwhich can also be done by overwriting files. Note that disk type specifics are omitted here\nfor the sake of brevity, as well as different file systems. Most the wipers focus on Windows,\nwhich has been using NTFS as the default file system for well over a decade.\n\nThere are different reasons as to why one would choose to overwrite files over the deletion\nof files. Whoever wrote the wiper might have simply chosen one or the other without giving\nit much thought, but there is a difference when attempting to recover files. Deleting a file\noften leaves the file on the disk as-is while marking the size as free-to-use for new write\noperations. As such, the deletion of all files from the device leaves a lot of free disk space,\nwhile preserving a lot of data. When carving the disk, numerous files can be recovered this\nway.\n\nThe [WhisperGate wiper, however, shows few advanced mechanisms, as the targeted files](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/return-of-pseudo-ransomware.html)\nwere corrupted by overwriting the first megabyte of each file with 0xCC repeatedly.\nSimilarly, both CaddyWiper variants use zero files, whereas RURansom uses a random\n[encryption key per file, and Nominatus_ToxicBattery (as reported by G-Data) wipes the](https://twitter.com/struppigel/status/1501473254787198977)\nsystem by overwriting files with copies of itself. The images below show excerpts from the\nmentioned samples. As some files are larger than the targeted file sizes, it is possible that\nfiles are corrupted, rather than overwritten. In either case, the files remain unusable.\n\nFigure 9 - WhisperGate's wiper's pseudocode to overwrite the first megabyte with 0xCC\n\nFigure 10 - CaddyWiper (both I and II) overwriting the first 10 megabytes of targeted files\nwith zeros\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 - RURansom's random password generation, called per file\n\nFigure 12 - Nominatus_ToxicBattery's \"encryption\" function where it replaces files with a\ncopy of itself\n\nThis is not to say that overwritten files cannot be recovered. The reorganizing of files on the\ndisk, along with overwriting files, can overwrite the free-to-use disk segments, although this\nis no certainty. Even with (partially) overwritten disk segments, file recovery tools can\nsometimes manage to recover most, if not all, of the lost data.\n\nThe recovery of data ties in with the next step, which is related to back-ups.\n\n#### Restoring back-ups\n\nThe destruction of wipers is often not limited to the device’s main drive, which is usually C:\non Windows. The 26 letter bound drives can be targeted as well, as is the case with both\nthe WhisperGate wiper and the HermeticWiper. This can significantly increase the amount\nof data which has to be restored from the backup, increasing the wiper’s impact.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 - HermeticWiper iterating over drive numbers\n\nFigure 14 - WhisperGate's wiper iterating logical drives to wipe\nThe restoration speed can be too slow, especially when people work from home and use\ntheir private broadband access to download significant amounts of data. Additionally, the\nuplink of the back-up location is limited until a certain point. If the restoration covers\nhundreds of machines, the uplink cannot handle all machines concurrently at a decent\nspeed, or it might not even support the concurrent number at all.\n\nThe slow restoration speed for a few machines might not seem more than a hinderance, but\nif the number of affected machines rises, so does the restoration time, creating a longer\nthan anticipated downtime once the initial malware infection has been remediated.\n\n#### Benign drivers\n\n\n-----\n\nThe industry s constant dilemma is to create detection rules without false positives. The\nShamoon wiper used a benign driver to manipulate the file system. Since the driver was\nsigned and used in a manner which is expected for such a driver, it is difficult to heuristically\ndefine the software as malicious. When looking at the type of file system changes, it\nbecomes obvious that the program is malware. On the 23rd of February 2022,\nHermeticWiper was first discovered. This wiper also used a benign driver, one with a similar\npurpose as the one Shamoon used, as is shown in the image below.\n\nFigure 15 - The usage of a benign driver in HermeticWiper\n\n### Safety measures\n\nThe measures below are not meant as an exhaustive list, but rather as a few key points\nblue teams can use to further strengthen their infrastructure against wipers, as well as other\nsimilarly operating malware such as ransomware.\n\nMuch like ransomware, wipers interact with thousands of files in a matter of minutes. As\nsuch, a detection rule to flag processes which remove, rename, or rewrite hundreds of files\nwithin a short timespan can help. Note that depending on the ingested logs, such a rule\nmight be prone to false positives, as creating compressed archives (be it encrypted or not)\nwith a lot of files will match the same characteristics.\n\nAdditionally, or alternatively, some wipers might simply delete all the files they encounter,\nincluding shadow copies and event logs. These two are normally not deleted, nor\ncompletely overwritten, making them interesting objects to monitor. The same advice\napplies to the Master Boot Record (MBR), which is only changed rarely, if at all.\n\nThe following advice is not only useful when one or more machines fall victim to a wiper:\ncreate and test back-ups. The back-up system should only be connected to the machines\nwhen storing the back-up, or it is at risk of being affected by various types of malware, not\nonly wipers. Ransomware tends to encrypt files in all connected drives, thus including\nattached back-up drives.\n\nThe last advice in this section, is to restrict the privilege of users to the minimum\nrequirements to do their job. Administrative privileges can change the impact of the wiper\nfrom losing files to not being able to boot the machine. In either case, it is likely for the\n\n\n-----\n\nmachine to be reimaged, but it does make the restoration process lengthier as the laptop\ncannot be restored remotely, and the victim must find another way of contacting the Security\nOperations Center.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll in all, wipers have proven to be effective. A wiper’s heuristic behavior can look quite a lot\nlike ransomware, with an equal, if not higher, initial devastating impact. For individuals who\nare stuck, the impact likely depends on the quality of the available back-ups, if any. For\ncorporations and nation states alike, the impact depends on the number of affected\nmachines, and the moment in time when the incident occurs. Communication is vital during\nwartime, which is why the impact of the wipers in Ukraine could have been disastrous, even\nif back-ups could be restored within a few days without any hiccups, as the few days with\nlimited communication might give an opponent the edge.\n\nWipers can be effective regardless of the technical skills of the attacker, as even the\nsimplest wiper can wreak havoc on affected systems. The required time to create such a\npiece of malware is low, especially when compared to complex espionage backdoors and\nthe often-accompanying vulnerabilities that are used. The return of investment need not be\nhigh in those cases, although it is unlikely that a few wipers are to wreak that much havoc in\nand of themselves.\n\nThe security posture of an organization can only benefit from preparing against such a\ndisastrous event, as less impactful yet similar events can be mitigated using the same\nplaybook. As the saying goes: forewarned is forearmed.\n\n### Hashes\n\nIn this section, hashes of the wipers which were mentioned in detail are shared below, in\ntheir order of appearance.
