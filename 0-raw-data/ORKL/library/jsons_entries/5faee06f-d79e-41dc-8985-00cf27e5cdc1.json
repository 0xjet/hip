Currently, it’s most common](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware)\ndistribution method is spam where a malicious executable is dropped by a VB script\nbelonging to the e-mail’s attachment.\n\n[The building blocks of Rokku reminded us of the Chimera ransomware. That’s why we](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/threat-analysis/2015/12/inside-chimera-ransomware-the-first-doxingware-in-wild/)\ndecided to take a closer look, not only at the internal structure of this malware but also at the\nsimilarities and differences between these two products.\n\n## Analyzed samples\n\n**Malware:**\n\n**Decryptor:**\n\n_[Special thanks to MalwareHunterTeam for sharing the sample.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)_\n\n## Behavioral analysis\n\nWhen we deploy the executable it runs silently – first dropping ransom notes (in two formats\n– HTML and TXT), and after that substituting files with their encrypted versions.\n\nRokku doesn’t retrieve keys from the server, so the encryption process can be executed offline as well.\n\n### Encryption process\n\n\n-----\n\nFiles encrypted by this ransomware can be identified by the extension .rokku added to the\noriginal name.\n\nThe encrypted content has a high level of entropy and no patterns are visible. See below a\nvisualization of bytes.\n\n**_square.bmp : left – original, right encrypted with Rokku:_**\n\nWhen the encryption finishes, the ransom note pops up:\n\n### Website for the victim\n\nAs many products of this type, Rokku has a web panel for victims, used to manage the\npayment and decrypt files. It is available via Tor.\n\nThe website have a neat design, however is very simple in comparison to other recent\nransomware:\n\n\n-----\n\nRather than forcing a victim to type a unique ID it simply ask them to upload one file. All the\nnecessary data are automatically fetched from the file.\n\nThen it redirects to the personalized part of the panel and shows the order ID. This unique\nidentifier can be used further to regain access to this page without the necessity to upload a\nfile again:\n\nThe required ransom amount is relatively low in comparison to other ransomware – 0.2402\nBTC (around 100 USD). Currently we found no information suggesting that price is going to\nbe incremented with time – so we can assume, that in this case distributors decided to use a\nfixed price.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the same site we can download the decrypting application. After the payment is\nprocessed, the root key, required to decrypt all the files is made available.\n\nEven without a payment, one chosen file can be unlocked for demonstration purposes. Once\nan encrypted file is uploaded, it’s individual file key is released. Then, it can be decrypted\nusing this key and the decryptor available on the site.\n\n### Findings\n\nLooking at the features described above, we can deduce quite a lot of information about the\ninternal logic of the encryption process. As usual, two types of cryptographic algorithms are\nused: asymmetric – for the root key, and symmetric – for the keys of individual files.\nIndividual (random) key is used to encrypt the file content – then, itself is encrypted by the\npublic root key and stored in the same file. Only an owner of the private root key can retrieve\nit – and with its help decrypt the original content.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample s individual key, displayed to a user is 45 characters long (it can also be\ninterpreted as a Base64 encrypted, 36 byte long content).\n\nAlso, every file contains the Order ID. The displayed value is 86 characters long (may be\ninterpreted as 66 byte long value Base64 encoded).\n\n## Inside the malware\n\nLets’ have a look inside the malicious sample…\n\nThe original payload that is being distributed in a campaigns is UPX encrypted. This layer\ncan be easily removed using typical UPX.\n\n[The next layer consists of some underground crypter/FUD.](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/threat-analysis/2015/12/malware-crypters-the-deceptive-first-layer/)\n\nAfter unpacking the crypter layer we can find the DLL with core malicious functionality –\n**_encryptor.dll_** [(be6552aed5e7509b3b539cef8a965131)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/186073cd4539725cbc26f8dac867c97e21d4c88836305a16acf50a70d6121f51/analysis/)\n\nSimilarly to the _[Core.dll of](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/core_dll.png)_ [Chimera ransomware, it uses ReflectiveLoader.](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2015/12/inside-chimera-ransomware-the-first-doxingware-in-wild/)\n\n**[ReflectiveLoader is a special stub belonging to the technique of Reflective DLL Injection.](http://www.harmonysecurity.com/files/HS-P005_ReflectiveDllInjection.pdf)**\nThis technique allows to produce a DLL that can be easily injected into another process.\nSimilarly to a shellcode, such DLL is self-contained and automatically loads all it’s\ndependencies.\n\n### Execution flow\n\nExecution of the malicious core follows several steps:\n\nFetches information about the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nRemoves local backups. It is very precise in this goal and it attacks several programs\nused for this purpose (used commands are listed below).\nEnumerates local disks, checking their existence by the alphabet (from Z to A) and\nmakes a list of all their directories. Directories on network disks are also listed.\nProcess the list of directories:\n\ndrops the ransom note in each of them\n[enumerates their files (using NtQueryDirectoryFile) and makes a list of paths.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff567047%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\nEncrypting routine takes the list of paths and encrypts them one by one. Information\n[about the file, i.e size is retrieved using ZwQueryInformationFile.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff567052%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n\nIn the initial phase, the malware makes a preparation to deploy its malicious features. It\nscans the environment and closes some programs. For example – searches if any console\nwindow is open, and if so, hides it:\n\n_In order to make analysis harder, this malware uses encrypted strings. They are decrypted_\n_on fly, just before they are needed. As you can see at the above screenshot – it is_\n_[implemented with the help of small in-line routine using SSE (highlighted in the picture).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions)_\n_Using an in-line routine have an advantage over a separate decrypting function – it is harder_\n_to locate all the calls to it and to decrypt strings just by tracing it’s output._\n\nNext, it reads a unique identifier of the current machine: retrieves GUID from the registry…\n```\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography -> \"MachineGuid\"\n\n```\n…and the volume serial number of the disk, where the Windows is installed (using\n[GetVolumeInformation). Both parts are concatenated together (<machine_guid>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/library/windows/desktop/aa364993%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n_<volume_serial>) and hashed using local implementation of SHA512 (this implementation_\ncomes from OpenSSL)…\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see the typical SHA512 constants in the code:\n\nFirst half of the SHA512 hash and the <machine_guid><volume_serial> are concatenated\ntogether and used as a mutex name (with the help of mutex malware prevent from being run\nmore than once at the same time).\n\nFinally, removing backups and stopping backup services is performed – by execution of the\nfollowing commands:\n```\nwmic shadowcopy delete /nointeractive\nvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\VSS\" /v Start /t REG_DWORD /d 4 /f\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SystemRestore\" /v\nDisableSR /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f\nnet stop vss\nnet stop swprv\nnet stop srservice\n\n### How does the encryption work?\n\n```\nFrom the behavioral analysis and experiments we concluded, that Rokku – like most of the\nransomware – uses symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n\nAs the main, symmetric encryption algorithm, authors decided to use Salsa20 (Salsa was\n[also used by the Petya ransomware). Fragment of the implementation is shown below:](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/threat-analysis/2016/04/petya-ransomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nEvery file is encrypted by Salsa20 with a new, random key. Random values are retrieved\nusing advapi32.SystemFunction036 – that is [RtlGenRandom. Then, the random key is](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387694%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\nencrypted with a locally implemented RSA algorithm.\n\nResearch about the implementation details and possible flaws is in progress.\n\n### What is attacked?\n\nRokku attacks local disks as well as network shares.\n\nThis malware doesn’t have any external configuration – all the strings (including attacked file\nextensions and blacklisted paths) are hardcoded in obfuscated form and decrypted in-line.\nLoading the hardcoded settings is performed by dedicated functions (in the described\nsample it starts at RVA = 0x2dcf):\n\nAttacked extensions are decrypted in chunks (each chunk contains several extensions) and\nthen added to the list. Below you can see decrypting chunk of extensions:\n\n\n-----\n\nSummary of all the file extensions that are attacked:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n001 1dc 3ds 3fr 7z a3s acb acbl accdb act ai ai3 ai4 ai5 ai6 ai7 ai8 aia aif aiff aip\nait anim apk arch00 ari art arw asc ase asef asp aspx asset avi bar bak bay bc6 bc7\nbgeo big bik bkf bkp blob bmp bsa c c4d cap cas catpart catproduct cdr cef cer cfr\n...\ncgm cha chr cld clx cpp cr2 crt crw cs css csv cxx d3dbsp das dayzprofile dazip db\ndb0 dbf dbfv dcr dcs der desc dib dlc dle dlv dlv3 dlv4 dmp dng doc docm docx drf dvi\ndvr dwf dwg dxf dxg eip emf emz epf epk eps eps2 eps3 epsf\n...\nepsp erf esm fbx ff fff fh10 fh11 fh7 fh8 fh9 fig flt flv fmod forge fos fpk fsh ft8\nfxg gdb ge2 geo gho h hip hipnc hkdb hkx hplg hpp hvpl hxx iam ibank icb icxs idea\niff iiq indd ipt iros irs itdb itl itm iwd iwi\n...\nj2k java jp2 jpe jpeg jpf jpg jpx js k25 kdb kdc kf kys layout lbf lex litemod lrf\nltx lvl m m2 m2t m2ts m3u m4a m4v ma map mat mb mcfi mcfp mcgame mcmeta mdb mdbackup\nmdc mddata mdf mdl mdlp mef mel menu mkv mll mlx mn\n...\nmodel mos mp mp4 mpqge mrw mrwref mts mu mxf nb ncf nef nrw ntl obm ocdc odb odc odm\nodp ods odt omeg orf ott p12 p7b p7c pak pct pcx pdd pdf pef pem pfx php php4 php5\npic picnc pkpass png ppd ppt pptm pptx prj\n...\nprt prtl ps psb psd psf psid psk psq pst ptl ptx pwl pxn pxr py qdf qic r3d raa raf\nrar raw rb re4 rgss3a rim rofl rtf rtg rvt rw2 rwl rwz sav sb sbx sc2save shp sid\nsidd sidn sie sis skl skp sldasm sldprt slm\n...\nslx slxp snx soft sqlite sqlite3 sr2 srf srw step stl stp sum svg svgz swatch syncdb\nt12 t13 tax tex tga tif tiff tor txt unity3d uof uos upk vda vdf vfl vfs0 vpk vpp_pc\nvst vtf w3x wb2 wdx wma wmo wmv wallet ycbcra\n...\nwotreplay wpd wps x3f xf xl xlk xls xlsb xlsm xlsx xvc xvz xxx zdct zip ztmp py rb\ntar gz sdf yuv max wav dat\n\n```\nIn the same way, blacklisted paths are deobfuscated and loaded.\n\nHere are some examples of in-line routines used to decrypt blacklisted paths:\n\nExample 1 – adding hardcoded value “roaming”:\n\nExample 2 – decrypting “system volume information”\n\n\n-----\n\nSummary of folders excluded from encryption:\n```\n$recycle.bin\nsystem volume information\nwindows.old\n$windows.~bt\nwindows\nwindows\nlocallow\nlocal\nroaming\nprogramdata\nprogram files\nprogram files (x86)\n\n```\nSome files – including ransom notes – are also excluded from encryption, i.e:\n```\nthumbs.db\niconcache.db\nbootsec.bak\n\n## Inside the decryptor\n\n```\nDecryptor is an application that can be downloaded from the website for the victim and used\nto recover the files after purchasing the key.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt comes with a simple GUI, allowing two modes of decryption – for individual file of for full\nfolder.\n\nIt is also UPX packed, but after removing this layer we can see valid strings. We can find\nthere elements corresponding to the encryptor.dll – but with much less obfuscation added.\nFor example – the same paths are skipped, but this time we can see them in clear text:\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow – fragment of Salsa20 implementation containing typical constants:\n\nGUI programming in C++ is not the strong point of the authors. In the code of decryptor we\ncan find fragments of a ready-made template. See below:\n\ncode fragment found in Rokku’s decryptor:\n\ncorresponding code fragment – part of a skeleton application that have been\n[demonstrated in a GUI programming course:](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb384843.aspx)\n\nAuthors of Chimera also didn’t felt confident in native GUI programming. Although they wrote\nmost of the code in C++, the decryptor’s GUI was prepared in .NET framework (that makes\nGUI programming much easier). Decryptor’s core functions were called from a DLL written in\nC++.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn terms of architecture, Rokku shows several similarities with Chimera ransomware:\n\n\n-----\n\nthe main part is a DLL, using ReflectiveLoader\ncryptography implemented locally (not via API calls)\nexternal decryptor that can be downloaded from the given location, before paying the\nransom\n\nBoth products use, however, different ways to communicate with victims: Chimera uses\nbitmessage, while Rokku uses a Tor website (like most of the ransomware). Chimera\nrequires an Internet connection in order to work – Rokku in contrary is fully independent from\nthe CnC server.\n\nThe found similarities lead us to the conclusion, that Rokku may be a product of the same\nauthors – prepared with a similar schema but with different needs in mind.\n\n_Rokku is detected by Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) as well as by Malwarebytes Anti-_\n_Ransomware (MBARW)._\n\n## Appendix\n\nAbout Rokku by other vendors:\n\nhttp://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rokku-ransomware-encrypts-each-filewith-its-own-unique-key/ – Bleeping Computer\n\n**About Chimera:**\n\n[Inside Chimera Ransomware – the first ‘doxingware’ in wild](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2015/12/inside-chimera-ransomware-the-first-doxingware-in-wild/)\n\nThis video cannot be displayed because your Functional Cookies are currently disabled.\n[To enable them, please visit our privacy policy and search for the Cookies section.
