According to Twitter user MaelSecurity, there was a Phishing-as-](https://twitter.com/maelsecurity/status/1204604810793607169)\na-Service associated with Kuzuluy impersonating PayPal in late 2019. At the time of our\nresearch, the service is no longer available, but we found multiple variants of a Kuzuluy kit\ntargeting PayPal customers from Germany, Austria, and Slovakia.\n\n[View the VMRay Platform report for Kuzuluy Phishing Kit](https://www.vmray.com/analyses/kuzuluy/report/overview.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Phishing page from Kuzuluy (left) and the legitimate PayPal login page_**\n**_(right)._**\n\nFigure 1. shows the phishing page (left) asking for PayPal credentials. Compared to the\nlegitimate online presence (right), we can see the phishing page uses a similar look and style\nthat can fool inattentive page visitors.\n\n**_Figure 2: VMRay Analyzer – VTI matches of the phishing page._**\n\nRegardless of the similarity, the VMRay Platform successfully detects the phishing attempt of\nthe Kuzuluy kit. The VTI matches reveal it recognizes the page pretending to be the\nlegitimate PayPal login page based on heuristics (Figure 2). For example, the phishing page\nuses the same title and contains a logon form.\n\n**_Figure 3: Embedded JavaScript that process the credentials._**\n\nThe JavaScript shown in Figure 3. is embedded into the page and validates the logon form\ndata by sending it to CheckLoginAndSend.php via POST-request. Depending on the result,\nthe page can redirect to Zweiter-Schritt.php, which then asks for further personal details and\ncredit card information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Content of the script CheckLoginAndSend.php._**\n\nThe script named CheckLoginAndSend.php sends the credentials via email and additionally\nwrites the data into a file on the server (Figure 4).\n\nLike most kits, this one uses multiple stages in which it tries to protect itself against web bots\nand to ensure the visitor is a potential victim. After all of these checks are passed, it redirects\nto the phishing page as seen in Figure 1. By looking at the index page in the root folder, we\ncan see that the page includes nine scripts that are responsible for blocking bots and\ncommon (analysis) tools. Each of these scripts works similarly. They compare some of the\nvisitor’s properties like his IP address or user-agent string against a blocklist. On a match,\nthe script stops the visitor from reaching the phishing page by sending a 404-page and\nredirecting to “hxxp:://2m[.]ma”.\n\n**_Figure 5: Stage testing the remote host name (left) and the ISP (right) against a_**\n**_blocklist._**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. shows two examples of those tests. On the left, the kit resolves the host name of\nthe client and sends a 404-page if it contains one of the strings from the block list\n“$f6650d6e”. Similar to the first test, the host name is compared again against another list\nthat includes AV vendors (Figure 5 right). Next, the script utilizes the third-party service\n“hxxp://ipinfo.io” to test the client’s ISP. Note that the server is connecting to the service and\nnot the client.\n\nAfter passing all of the tests, Kuzuluy generates a random id and makes a local copy of the\n“art” directory to “/Reference/Ref-ID-<random id>”. Next, it redirects to the newly-created\ncopy which leads us to the previously seen phishing page in Figure 1. The copy-behavior\nallows us to identify URLs referencing the phishing page of Kuzuluy.\n\nA search for this string reveals the kit has been used in the wild since May. In addition, we\nfound multiple archives that are labeled as “cracked” or “leaked” associated with Kuzuluy.\nCriminals sell their phishing kits online or provide a Phishing-as-a-Service that customers\ncan use to start their own phishing campaign.\n\nDepending on the kit, the customer can configure and customize it to his own needs. Typical\nexamples are the language and delivery method of stolen credentials. More advanced kits\nprovide features to automatically setup servers and distribute spam emails. Criminals enrich\ntheir kits with some kind of copy protection to protect their kits. A leaked or cracked version\nof the kit claims to be a version without those protections.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this Malware Analysis Spotlight, we have taken a look at a Kuzuluy phishing kit used in the\nwild. We discussed how phishing kits can block certain (analysis) tools or ISPs, and\npresented indicators to detect phishing attempts from the kit.\n\n### IOCs\n\n**Kit Varients:**\n\n3d07c983f48a12a41229a79aa19e801065b158c62d99e158b2c7ed64f7327c54\n\n2f6793d192c248b5c680007f5da7d2a85289c4b14632bb20051136d9fa643380\n\nb8481430438bc401e91e648ff8eafb5ef34f230dbbac216bdb9663a9b57936eb\n\nad1aa8899568ff0dce43d1858fdc789ccf0a88467c17338b7e2a26061139a195\n\nce1dcedab4b5c2570c59b8e076f42cc751eaff7d5a44618278364f73d082840b\n\n**Domain/ URLs**\n\n“*/Reference/Ref-id-*”\n\n\n-----\n\npayplticket<number>.info/reference/ref-id\n\n-----",
