REUTERS/Raphael Satter\n\n\n-----\n\n[The attempted intrusions, many of which were internally flagged by Microsoft Corp MSFT.O](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O)\nover the summer, were carried out by a group often nicknamed \"Fancy Bear.\" The hackers'\nactivity provides insight into how Russian intelligence is targeting the United States in the\nrun-up to the Nov. 3 election.\n\nThe targets identified by Reuters, which include the Center for American Progress, the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for\nInternational Peace, said they had not seen any evidence of successful hacking attempts.\n\nFancy Bear is controlled by Russia’s military intelligence agency and was responsible for\nhacking the email accounts of Hillary Clinton’s staff in the run-up to the 2016 election,\naccording to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018.\n\n[News of the Russian hacking activity follows last month's announcement here by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cyber-microsoft/microsoft-foreign-hackers-are-targeting-biden-and-trump-camps-idUSKBN26136Z)\nthat Fancy Bear had attempted to hack more than 200 organizations, many of which the\nsoftware company said were tied to the 2020 election. Microsoft was able to link this year's\ncyber espionage campaign to the Russian hackers through an apparent programming error\nthat allowed the company to identify a pattern of attack unique to Fancy Bear, according to a\nMicrosoft assessment reviewed by Reuters.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on Reuters’ findings, citing customer privacy. But Tom Burt,\ncorporate vice president, customer security and trust, said in a statement that the company and the U.S. government - “have been working hard to keep this election safe and secure.”\n\nThe thrust of espionage operations could not be determined by Reuters. The Office of the\n[Director of National Intelligence said in August here that Russian operations were attempting](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-interference/u-s-counterspy-chief-warns-russia-china-iran-trying-to-meddle-in-2020-election-idUSKCN253304)\nto undermine the campaign of presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesman Chris Meagher said it was “no surprise” that\nforeign actors were attempting to interfere with the election.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington said it does not interfere in America’s internal affairs\nand denied any link to “Fancy Bear,” calling the allegation “fake news.”\n\nThe Trump campaign did not return messages.\n\nOver the summer, a specialized cybersecurity unit at Microsoft and federal law enforcement\nagents notified many of the targets who were in Fancy Bear’s crosshairs, according to six\npeople with knowledge of the matter. Reuters last month identified SKDKnickerbocker, a\nlobbying firm allied with Biden, as one of them.\n\nThe targeting of Democrats in Indiana and California - confirmed by four people familiar with\nthe matter - suggests that the Russians are “casting their net wide,” said Don Smith of\ncybersecurity company Secureworks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Indiana Democratic Party said in a statement it was unaware of any successful\nintrusions.” California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks acknowledged being targeted, but\nstopped short of naming Fancy Bear, saying in an email that “the effort by the foreign entity\nwas unsuccessful.”\n\nThe FBI declined comment.\n\nATTACKS ON INFLUENTIAL NON-PROFITS Fancy Bear also targeted think tanks and\nforeign policy organizations that hold sway in Washington and have, in the past, provided\nstaff for presidential administrations.\n\nAmong them was the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning group whose\nfounder, John Podesta, was at the center of the 2016 Russian hack and leak operation,\naccording to a person with direct knowledge of the incident.\n\nA CAP spokesperson said the organization had not been breached and declined further\ncomment. The Open Society Foundations, one of the first organizations to see its\ncorrespondence leaked to the public by Fancy Bear in 2016, was targeted by the Kremlin\nagain earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the matter. The group’s founder,\nGeorge Soros, has provided substantial funding to pro-democracy causes and is a regular\ntarget of Russian disinformation as well as domestic conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a statement, the Open Society said “obviously tensions are extraordinarily high heading\ninto this election, and we are taking many steps to ensure the safety of our staff.”\n\nOthers targeted by Fancy Bear in 2020 included the New York-based Council on Foreign\nRelations (CFR), the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment, and the Center for Strategic\nand International Studies (CSIS) - all of whom were notified by Microsoft, according to\npeople familiar with the respective organizations.\n\nA CSIS spokesman declined comment on the hacking activity. A Carnegie spokeswoman\nconfirmed the targeting, but declined to provide further detail. A spokeswoman with the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations said they had not been breached.\n\nEditing by Jonathan Weber, Chris Sanders, Edward Tobin and Sonya Hepinstall\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
