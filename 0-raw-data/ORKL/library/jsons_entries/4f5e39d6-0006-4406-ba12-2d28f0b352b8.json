Additionally, officials in Lithuania, Sweden, and Ukraine assisted in this major\ncyber investigative action.\n\n“The Emotet malware and botnet infected hundreds of thousands of computers throughout\nthe United States, including our critical infrastructure, and caused millions of dollars in\ndamage to victims worldwide,” said Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. “Cyber\ncriminals will not escape justice regardless of where they operate. Working with public and\nprivate partners around the world we will relentlessly pursue them while using the full arsenal\nof tools at our disposal to disrupt their threats and prosecute those responsible.”\n\nAccording to an unsealed search warrant affidavit, Emotet is a family of malware that targets\ncritical industries worldwide, including banking, e‑commerce, healthcare, academia,\ngovernment, and technology. Emotet malware primarily infects victim computers through\n\n\n-----\n\nspam email messages containing malicious attachments or hyperlinks. Emails were\ndesigned to appear to come from a legitimate source or someone in the recipient’s contact\nlist. Once it has infected a victim computer, Emotet can deliver additional malware to the\ninfected computer, such as ransomware or malware that steals financial credentials.\nRansomware, in particular, has increased in scope and severity in the past year, harming\nbusinesses, healthcare providers, and government agencies even as the country has\nstruggled to respond to the pandemic.\n\n“The coordinated disruption of Emotet was a great success for the FBI and our international\npartners,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The FBI utilized sophisticated techniques, our\nunique legal authorities, and most importantly, our worldwide partnerships to significantly\ndisrupt the malware. The operation is an example of how much we can achieve when we\nwork with our international law enforcement partners to combat the cyber threat. The FBI\nremains committed, now more than ever, to imposing risk and consequences on cyber\ncriminals to put an end to this type of criminal activity.”\n\nThe computers infected with Emotet malware are part of a botnet (i.e., a network of\ncompromised computers), meaning the perpetrators can remotely control all the infected\ncomputers in a coordinated manner. The owners and operators of the victim computers are\ntypically unaware of the infection.\n\n“Cybercrime transcends physical and political boundaries and costs U.S. citizens and\nbusinesses billions each year,” said U.S. Attorney Matt Martin of the Middle District of North\nCarolina. “That was certainly true with Emotet. Now, more than ever, international\ncollaboration is an imperative as we employ a technically and legally sophisticated approach\nto thwart cybercriminals in whatever corner of the globe they are found. This investigation will\nbe a paradigm for effective international law enforcement cooperation directed at global\ncybercrime, and we applaud the FBI and the international law enforcement partners who\ncontributed to the effort to take down this global threat.”\n\nAccording to the affidavit, in 2017, for example, the computer network of a school district in\nthe Middle District of North Carolina was infected with the Emotet malware. The Emotet\ninfection caused damage to the school’s computers, including but not limited to the school’s\nnetwork, which was disabled for approximately two weeks. In addition, the infection caused\nmore than $1.4 million in losses, including but not limited to the cost of virus mitigation\nservices and replacement computers. From 2017 to the present, there have been numerous\nother victims throughout North Carolina and the United States, to include computer networks\nof local, state, tribal, and federal governmental units, corporations, and networks related to\ncritical infrastructure.\n\n“The Emotet malware quickly elevated to one of the top cyber threats in the world,” said\nSpecial Agent in Charge Robert R. Wells of the FBI Charlotte Field Office. “The strong\nrelationships with international law enforcement partners were critical to the success of this\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI investigation which began with a small North Carolina school system that did the right\nthing and quickly contacted their local FBI office for help.”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Emotet\ninfections have cost local, state, tribal, and territorial governments up to $1 million per\nincident to remediate. More information about the malware, including technical information\nfor organizations about how to mitigate its effects, is available from CISA here: https://uscert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, foreign law enforcement agents, working in coordination with the\nFBI, gained lawful access to Emotet servers located overseas and identified the Internet\nProtocol addresses of approximately 1.6 million computers worldwide that appear to have\nbeen infected with Emotet malware between April 1, 2020, and Jan. 17, 2021. Of those, over\n45,000 infected computers appear to have been located in the United States.\n\nForeign law enforcement, working in collaboration with the FBI, replaced Emotet malware on\nservers located in their jurisdiction with a file created by law enforcement, according to the\naffidavit. This was done with the intent that computers in the United States and elsewhere\nthat were infected by the Emotet malware would download the law enforcement file during an\nalready-programmed Emotet update. The law enforcement file prevents the administrators of\nthe Emotet botnet from further communicating with infected computers. The law enforcement\nfile does not remediate other malware that was already installed on the infected computer\nthrough Emotet; instead, it is designed to prevent additional malware from being installed on\nthe infected computer by untethering the victim computer from the botnet.\n\nThe scope of this law enforcement action was limited to the information installed on infected\ncomputers by the Emotet operators and did not extend to the information of the owners and\nusers of the computers.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, in coordination with foreign law enforcement officials, FBI\npersonnel also gained lawful access to an Emotet distribution server located overseas and\nidentified several servers worldwide that were used to distribute the Emotet malware. These\nservers were typically compromised web servers belonging to what appear to be unknowing\nthird parties. The perpetrators uploaded the Emotet malware to the servers through\nunauthorized software applications. Victims who clicked on spam email messages containing\nmalicious attachments or hyperlinks would then download the initial Emotet malware file from\na distribution server.\n\nIn addition, according to the affidavit, FBI personnel notified more than 20 U.S.-based\nhosting providers that they hosted more than 45 IP addresses that had been compromised\nby the perpetrators associated with the Emotet malware and botnet. FBI Legal Attachés\nfurther notified authorities in more than 50 countries that hosting providers in their respective\njurisdictions hosted hundreds of IP addresses that were compromised by Emotet.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe U.S. Attorney s Office for the Middle District of North Carolina, the FBI Charlotte\nDivision, and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\n(CCIPS) conducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust who were\nan integral part of coordination and messaging, and investigators and prosecutors from\nseveral jurisdictions, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, France’s National Police\nand Judicial Court of Paris, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police and General Public\nProsecutor’s Office Frankfurt/Main, Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, Netherlands National\nPolice and National Public Prosecution Office, Swedish Police Authority, National Police of\nUkraine and Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, and the United Kingdom’s National\nCrime Agency and Crown Prosecution Service. The Justice Department’s Office of\nInternational Affairs and the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork (FinCEN) also provided significant assistance. CCIPS Senior Counsel Ryan K.J.\nDickey and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eric Iverson and Anand Ramaswamy of the Middle\nDistrict of North Carolina led the U.S. efforts.\n\n[More information about the operation is available by clicking: Eurojust/Europol.
