Conversations with the creator of crimeware\n\n**[malwareint.blogspot.com/2010/02/spyeye-bot-part-two-conversations-with.html](http://malwareint.blogspot.com/2010/02/spyeye-bot-part-two-conversations-with.html)**\n\nIn recent weeks, SpyEye (a new financial trojan) has been the talk of many for the positive\nacceptance was so in the underground scene due to its balance about cost/benefit, and the\ngreat impact that achievement to whiten the features in its latest version that allows systems\nto eliminate the activities of your competition: ZeuS.\n\nOur previous report, “SpyEye. Analysis of a new crimeware alternative scenario,” addressed\nknown technical issues involving the activities of this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this second part we present the exclusive interview by Ben Koehl, Crimeware Researcher\nof Malware Intelligence. Through interviews with the creator of crimeware, we reveal\ninformation that shows some of the thought process and brains behind the creator of\nSpyEye. We also see the source code for the Zeus Killer addition.\n\nThe way that Gribodemon thinks is not unique anymore in the cybercrime world. We are\nseeing individuals and groups becoming more specialized in the services they provide and\nare no longer spreading themselves thin. There are many industries within the cybercrime\nworld. From coding to infrastructure support to public relations.\n\nThere was a large language barrier between me and the author so I had to keep the\nquestions short and basic so his translator program could handle them (Lingvo.) We broke\nup the conversation in pieces to make it flow better to the reader.\n\nThis document can be downloaded from:\n\n[English version](http://www.malwareint.com/docs/spyeye-analysis-ii-en.pdf)\n[Spanish version](http://www.malwareint.com/docs/spyeye-analysis-ii-es.pdf)\n\nRelated information\n[SpyEye Bot.
