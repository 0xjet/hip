The transactions totaled just over $90 million since\nOctober 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/darkside-ransomware-has-netted-over-90-million-in-bitcoin)\nAssuming these are all the payments that DarkSide received from its victims, the group’s\naverage ransom would be $1.9 million, making the threat actor one of the greediest in the\nransomware business.\n\nA [blog post from Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service provider eSentire on May](https://www.esentire.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-the-darkside-ransomware-group)\n12, a day before [DarkSide operations closed, counted 59 victims listed on the gang’s leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-servers-reportedly-seized-operation-shuts-down/)\nsite, which would add to the 47 associated with the Bitcoin wallets that Elliptic analyzed.\n\n[Although DarkSide launched in August 2020, the gang became a prolific actor on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/)\nransomware scene and saw a significant surge in profits lately.\n\n[Elliptic notes in a report last week that the operation made $17.5 million, which is around](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/elliptic-follows-bitcoin-ransoms-paid-by-darkside-ransomware-victims)\n20% of its known total profits, only in the past three months.\n\nAttacks on [Colonial Pipeline and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/colonial-pipeline-restores-operations-5-million-ransom-demanded/) [Brenntag chemical distribution company brought the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chemical-distributor-pays-44-million-to-darkside-ransomware/)\ncybercriminals about $10 million, as the former paid nearly $5 million and the latter paid a\n$4.4 million ransom.\n\n## Splitting the profit\n\nBeing a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, the DarkSide profits were split between\nthe developers of the malware and the affiliates that breached victim networks, stole data,\nand deployed the file-encrypting malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nAffiliates, or partners, typically get the lion s share of the money because they do most of the\nwork. In the case of DarkSide, they got between 75% and 90% of the profit, depending on\nthe size of the ransom.\n\nFor ransoms smaller than $500,000, the DarkSide developers would take 25%; the share\ndecreased to 10% for larger payments of more than $5 million.\n\nElliptic co-founder and chief scientist Dr. Tom Robinson says that the “split of the ransom\npayment is very clear to see on the blockchain” and that the malware developer received\n$15.5 million worth of bitcoins from the total profits.\n\nsource: [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/darkside-ransomware-has-netted-over-90-million-in-bitcoin)\nFollowing the transactions from wallets belonging to DarkSide affiliates, Robinson found that\n18% of the proceeds were sent to some exchange services and 4% went to a large dark\nmarket that provides, among others, cash-out services.\n\nWith $90 million from ransoms over a period of nine months, DarkSide sits among the most\nprofitable ransomware groups:\n\nRyuk - at least [$150 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-bitcoin-wallets-point-to-150-million-operation/)\nGandCrab - [$150 million (self-claim) in one year and a half](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-shutting-down-after-claiming-to-earn-2-billion/)\nREvil - [$100 million (self-claim) in one year](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-gang-claims-over-100-million-profit-in-a-year/)\nMaze/Egregor - [over $63 million received to one Bitcoin address in four months](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ransomware-ecosystem-crypto-crime-2021)\n(between August 2020 and the end of the year)\nNetwalker - [$25 million in five months](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-earned-25-million-in-just-five-months/)\nQlocker - [$260,000 in 5 days](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-ransomware-gang-made-260-000-in-5-days-using-the-7zip-utility/)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
