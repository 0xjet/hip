In this case, you are\nrecommended to replace your device with a new one.\n\nIf you own WatchGuard network devices and are looking for that advisory instead, you can\n[find the vendor's threat mitigation advice on this webpage.](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-news/blog/important-detection-and-remediation-actions-cyclops-blink-state-sponsored-botnet)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[US, UK link new Cyclops Blink malware to Russian state hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-uk-link-new-cyclops-blink-malware-to-russian-state-hackers/)\n\n[US offers $10 million reward for tips on Russian Sandworm hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-offers-10-million-reward-for-tips-on-russian-sandworm-hackers/)\n\n[Sandworm hackers fail to take down Ukrainian energy provider](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-fail-to-take-down-ukrainian-energy-provider/)\n\n[US disrupts Russian Cyclops Blink botnet before being used in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-disrupts-russian-cyclops-blink-botnet-before-being-used-in-attacks/)\n\n[Google shut down caching servers at two Russian ISPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/google-shut-down-caching-servers-at-two-russian-isps/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
