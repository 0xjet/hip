According to this new alert, Hidden Cobra (the\nU.S. government’s code name for Lazarus) has been conducting “FASTCash” attacks\nstealing money from Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) from banks in Asia and Africa\nsince at least 2016.\n\nLazarus is a very active attack group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. The\ngroup was initially known for its espionage operations and a number of high-profile\ndisruptive attacks, including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures. More recently, Lazarus has\nalso become involved in financially motivated attacks, including an US$81 million dollar\n[theft from the Bangladesh Central Bank and the WannaCry ransomware.](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group)\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup's recent wave of financial attacks. The operation, known as “FASTCash” has enabled\nLazarus to fraudulently empty ATMs of cash. To make the fraudulent withdrawals, Lazarus\nfirst breaches targeted banks’ networks and compromises the switch application servers\nhandling ATM transactions.\n\nOnce these servers are compromised, previously unknown malware ( [Trojan.Fastcash) is](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-110615-2942-99)\ndeployed. This malware in turn intercepts fraudulent Lazarus cash withdrawal requests and\nsends fake approval responses, allowing the attackers to steal cash from ATMs.\n\nAccording to the U.S. government alert, one incident in 2017 saw cash withdrawn\nsimultaneously from ATMs in over 30 different countries. In another major incident in 2018,\ncash was taken from ATMs in 23 separate countries. To date, the Lazarus FASTCash\noperation is estimated to have stolen tens of millions of dollars.\n\n## How FASTCash attacks work - Details\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) executable into a running, legitimate process on the\nswitch application server of a financial transaction network, in this case a network handling\nATM transactions. The malicious executable contains logic to construct fraudulent ISO\n8583 messages. ISO 8583 is the standard for financial transaction messaging. The\npurpose of this executable has not been previously documented. It was previously believed\nthat the attackers used scripts to manipulate legitimate software on the server into\nenabling the fraudulent activity.\n\nHowever, analysis by Symantec has found that this executable is in fact malware, which we\n[have named Trojan.Fastcash. Trojan.Fastcash has two primary functions:](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-110615-2942-99)\n\n1. It monitors incoming messages and intercepts attacker-generated fraudulent\n\ntransaction requests to prevent them from reaching the switch application that\nprocesses transactions.\n2. It contains logic that generates one of three fraudulent responses to fraudulent\n\ntransaction requests.\n\nOnce installed on the server, Trojan.Fastcash will read all incoming network traffic,\nscanning for incoming ISO 8583 request messages. It will read the Primary Account\nNumber (PAN) on all messages and, if it finds any containing a PAN number used by the\nattackers, the malware will attempt to modify these messages. How the messages are\nmodified depends on each victim organization. It will then transmit a fake response\nmessage approving fraudulent withdrawal requests. The result is that attempts to withdraw\nmoney via an ATM by the Lazarus attackers will be approved.\n\nHere is one example of the response logic that Trojan.Fastcash uses to generate fake\nresponses. This particular sample has logic to construct one of three fake responses based\non the incoming attacker request:\n\nFor Message Type Indicator == 200 (ATM Transaction) and Point of Service Entry\nMode starts with 90 (Magnetic Strip only):\n\nIf Processing Code starts with 3 (Balance Inquiry):\n\nResponse Code = 00 (Approved)\n\nOtherwise, if the Primary Account Number is Blacklisted by Attackers:\n\nResponse Code = 55 (Invalid PIN)\n\nAll other Processing Codes (with non-blacklisted PANs):\n\nResponse Code = 00 (Approved)\n\nIn this case, the attackers appear to have built in a capability to selectively deny\ntransactions based on their own blacklist of account numbers. However, the capability was\nnot implemented in this sample, and the check for blacklisting always returns “False”.\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent response logic. We believe that each variant is tailored for a particular transaction\nprocessing network and thus has its own tailored response logic.\n\nThe PAN numbers used to carry out the FASTCash attacks relate to real accounts.\nAccording to the US-CERT report, most accounts used to initiate the transactions had\nminimal account activity or zero balances. How the attackers gain control of these\naccounts remains unclear. It is possible the attackers are opening the accounts\nthemselves and making withdrawal requests with cards issued to those accounts. Another\npossibility is the attackers are using stolen cards to perform the attacks.\n\nIn all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers have compromised banking\napplication servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, beyond the\nend of their service pack support dates.\n\n## Who is Lazarus?\n\nLazarus is a very active group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. Lazarus was\ninitially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile\n[disruptive attacks, including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures that saw large amounts of](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation)\ninformation being stolen and computers wiped by malware.\n\nIn recent years, Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks. The\n[group was linked to the $81 million theft from the Bangladesh central bank in 2016, along](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/swift-attackers-malware-linked-more-financial-attacks)\nwith a number of other bank heists.\n\n[Lazarus was also linked to the WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017. WannaCry](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group)\nincorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in\n[Windows (CVE-2017-0144 and CVE-2017-0145) to turn the ransomware into a worm,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/vulnerability.jsp?bid=96704)\ncapable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim’s network and also\nto other vulnerable computers connected to the internet. Within hours of its release,\nWannaCry had infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.\n\n## Ongoing threat to the financial sector\n\nThe recent wave of FASTCash attacks demonstrates that financially motivated attacks are\nnot simply a passing interest for the Lazarus group and can now be considered one of its\ncore activities.\n\nAs with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists, including the Bangladesh Bank heist,\nFASTCash illustrates that Lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems\nand transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in\norder to steal large sums from vulnerable banks.\n\nIn short, Lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and\norganizations should take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are\nfully up to date and secured.\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec has the following detections in place to protect customers against Lazarus\nFASTCash attacks:\n\n[Trojan.Fastcash](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-110615-2942-99)\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOrganizations should ensure that operating systems and all other software are up to date.\nSoftware updates will frequently include patches for newly discovered security\nvulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. In all reported FASTCash attacks to\ndate, the attackers have compromised banking application servers running unsupported\nversions of the AIX operating system, beyond the end of their service pack support dates.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nD465637518024262C063F4A82D799A4E40FF3381014972F24EA18BC23C3B27EE\n(Trojan.Fastcash Injector)\n\nCA9AB48D293CC84092E8DB8F0CA99CB155B30C61D32A1DA7CD3687DE454FE86C\n(Trojan.Fastcash DLL)\n\n10AC312C8DD02E417DD24D53C99525C29D74DCBC84730351AD7A4E0A4B1A0EBA\n(Trojan.Fastcash DLL)\n\n3A5BA44F140821849DE2D82D5A137C3BB5A736130DDDB86B296D94E6B421594C\n(Trojan.Fastcash DLL)\n\n\n-----\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Security Response Attack Investigation Team\n\nThe Attack Investigation Team is a group of security experts within Symantec Security\nResponse whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in\nSymantec products, and offer analysis which helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
