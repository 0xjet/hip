Instead, it purely focuses on exploiting IoT device vulnerabilities. So, we name it\n**IoT_reaper.**\n\n**IoT_reaper is fairly large now and is actively expanding. For example, there are multiple C2s**\nwe are tracking, the most recently data (October 19) from just one C2 shows the number of\nunique active bot IP address is more than 10k per day. While at the same time, there are\nmillions of potential vulnerable device IPs being queued into the c2 system waiting to be\nprocessed by an automatic loader that injects malicious code to the devices to expand the\nsize of the botnet.\n\nCurrently, this botnet is still in its early stages of expansion. But the author is actively\nmodifying the code, which deserves our vigilance.\n\nHere we are sharing some quick summary so the security community may stop its before it\ncauses bigger damage.\n\n## From Mirai, Beyond Mirai\n\nThe botnet partially borrows some mirai source code, but is significantly different from mirai\nin several key behaviors, including:\n\nNo longer crack any weak password, only exploit IoT devices vulnerabilities;\nA LUA execution environment integrated, so more complex attacks can be supported\nand carried out;\nScan behavior is not very aggressive, so it can stay under the radar.\n\n## Sample Delivery, C2 Distribution and Traffic Pattern\n\nTake hxxp://162.211.183.192/sa as an example, IoT_reaper's sample delivery and C2\ndistribution are as follows. There is a `downloader, quite different from Mirai:`\n\n**downloader: 162.211.183.192, samples can be downloaded from this server and it**\nusually uses \"d\" as subdomain, like d.hl852.com\n\n\n-----\n\n**controller: 27.102.101.121, which can control bots, send commands and usually uses**\n\"e\" as subdomain, like e.hl852.com\n**reporter: 222.112.82.231, which is used to receive potentially vulnerable device info**\ncollected by bots, it usually uses \"f\" as subdomain, like f.hl852.com.\n**loader: 119.82.26.157, implants bot program through vulnerabilities into devices**\ncollected by reporter\n\nThe following figures shows traffic pattern of the above 4 IPs：\n\n## 9 IoT Vulnerability Exploits Integrated in the Malware\n\nUnlike Mirai that uses weak password cracking, IoT_reaper infects IoT devices by exploiting\nmultiple IoT device vulnerabilities.\n\nWe noticed 9 IoT vulnerability exploits have been integrated into current samples as follows:\n\n**Dlink** [https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3364](https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3364)\n**Goahead** [https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-03-08-camera-goahead-0day.html](https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-03-08-camera-goahead-0day.html)\n**JAWS** [https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/pwning-cctv-cameras/](https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/pwning-cctv-cameras/)\n**Netgear** [https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3409](https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3409)\n**Vacron NVR** [https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3445](https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3445)\n**Netgear** [http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Jun/8](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Jun/8)\n**Linksys** [http://www.s3cur1ty.de/m1adv2013-004](http://www.s3cur1ty.de/m1adv2013-004)\n**dlink** [http://www.s3cur1ty.de/m1adv2013-003](http://www.s3cur1ty.de/m1adv2013-003)\n**AVTECH** [https://github.com/Trietptm-on-Security/AVTECH](https://github.com/Trietptm-on-Security/AVTECH)\n\n\n-----\n\nNote just in the last 10 days, the attacker has continuously added more new exploits into\nsamples, one of which is adopted only 2 days after the disclosure of the vulnerability was\nmade.\n\nVacron NVR remote exploit was exposed on 2017-10-08 and was added into bot\nsample before 2017-10-10;\n3 and 1 exploits are added separately in two updates on 2017-10-12 and 2017-10-16;\n\n## The LUA Execution Environment Integrated in the Malware\n\nMd5: CA92A3B74A65CE06035FCC280740DAF6\n\nBased on the integrated LUA execution environment, author will be able to write very\ncomplex and efficient attack scripts now\n\n## Approximately 100 DNS Open Resolvers Were Integrated in This Malware\n\nThe botnet has embedded more than 100 DNS open resolvers in its lua sample, so dns\namplification attack can be easily carried out. And a cross-checking with our DRDoS data\nfeed indicates that about one-third of these open DNS servers have been used as reflector in\nreal dns amplification attacks. We have yet to see this type of config in any other mirai\nvariants.\n\n## No DDoS Attack Command observed Till Now\n\n\n-----\n\nIn terms of attacking command, although we saw support of DDoS attack in the source file of\nLua execution environment, we have not seen actual DDoS attack so far. The only\ninstructions we saw are to download samples. This means the attacker is still focusing on\nspreading the botnets.\n\n## Infection Measurement\n\nBy using some tricks, we are able to draw some fairly accurate measurement on the scale of\nthe infection, here are a sample of the numbers.\n\nNumber of vulnerable devices in one c2 queue waiting to be infected : over 2m;\nInfected bots controlled by one c2 in last 7 days: over 20k ;\nNumber of daily active bots controlled by one c2 : around 10k for yesterday(October\n19) ;\nNumber of simultaneous on-line bots controlled by one c2 : around 4k\n\n## IoC URLs\n\nhxxp://cbk99.com:8080/run.lua\n\nhxxp://bbk80.com/api/api.php\n\nhxxp://103.1.221.40/63ae01/39xjsda.php\n\nhxxp://162.211.183.192/down/server.armel\n\nhxxp://162.211.183.192/sa\n\nhxxp://162.211.183.192/sa5\n\nhxxp://162.211.183.192/server.armel\n\nhxxp://162.211.183.192/sm\n\nhxxp://162.211.183.192/xget\n\nhxxp://198.44.241.220:8080/run.lua\n\nhxxp://23.234.51.91/control-ARM-LSB\n\nhxxp://23.234.51.91/control-MIPS32-MSB\n\nhxxp://23.234.51.91/ht_am5le\n\nhxxp://23.234.51.91/ht_mpbe\n\nhxxp://27.102.101.121/down/1506753086\n\nhxxp://27.102.101.121/down/1506851514\n\n## IoC Hashes\n\n3182a132ee9ed2280ce02144e974220a\n\n3d680273377b67e6491051abe17759db\n\n41ef6a5c5b2fde1b367685c7b8b3c154\n\n4406bace3030446371df53ebbdc17785\n\n4e2f58ba9a8a2bf47bdc24ee74956c73\n\n596b3167fe0d13e3a0cfea6a53209be4\n\n6587173d571d2a587c144525195daec9\n\n\n-----\n\n6f91694106bb6d5aaa7a7eac841141d9\n704098c8a8a6641a04d25af7406088e1\n726d0626f66d5cacfeff36ed954dad70\n76be3db77c7eb56825fe60009de2a8f2\n95b448bdf6b6c97a33e1d1dbe41678eb\n9ad8473148e994981454b3b04370d1ec\n9f8e8b62b5adaf9c4b5bdbce6b2b95d1\na3401685d8d9c7977180a5c6df2f646a\nabe79b8e66c623c771acf9e21c162f44\nb2d4a77244cd4f704b65037baf82d897\nca92a3b74a65ce06035fcc280740daf6\ne9a03dbde09c6b0a83eefc9c295711d7\nf9ec2427377cbc6afb4a7ff011e0de77\nfb7c00afe00eeefb5d8a24d524f99370\n\n\n-----",
