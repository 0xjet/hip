    "plain_text": "# Taurus: The New Stealer in Town\n\n**zscaler.com/blogs/research/taurus-new-stealer-town**\n\nA sandbox is a valuable tool in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals and bad actors are\ncontinually looking for ways to avoid detection. One of the newest ones we observed,\nTaurus, includes techniques to evade sandbox detection. Was this new malware able to go\n[undetected by the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox? (Spoiler alert: It wasn't.)](https://www.zscaler.com/products/sandboxing)\n\nLet's take a closer look at the Taurus stealer.\n\nIn early June 2020, we observed and began tracking a new malware campaign. During our\nresearch, we observed that the \"Predator the Thief\" cybercriminal group is behind the\ndevelopment of this stealer, named Taurus, and is selling it on dark forums for $100 or\nrebuilt with a new domain for $20.\n\nThe group selling Taurus claims that this stealer is capable of stealing passwords, cookies,\nand autofill forms along with the history of Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers.\nTaurus can also steal some popular cryptocurrency wallets, commonly used FTP clients\ncredentials, and email clients credentials. This stealer also collects information, such as\ninstalled software and system configuration, and sends that information back to the\nattacker. Taurus is designed to not execute in countries within the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), which includes Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia,\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and\nUkraine. (Turkmenistan and Ukraine are both unofficial members of the organization.\nGeorgia was a member of the CIS but left the group in 2008.)\n\n**Infection cycle**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Infection cycle of the Taurus campaign_\n\n**Distribution method**\n\nWhile tracking the campaign, we noticed that attackers initiated this campaign by sending a\nspam mail to the victim containing a malicious attachment. Below are the details of the\nspam mail we observed:\n\n[From: \"[email protected]\" <[email protected]>](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nReceived: from daqrey.site (unknown [91.191.184.35])\n\nDate: Fri, 5 Jun 2020 16:56:35\n\nSubject: Penalty Charge Notice\n\nAttachment: pay-violation1011066.doc\n\nThe attachment (pay-violation1011066.doc) contained malicious macro code to download\nfurther payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: The attached malicious doc asks users to enable a macro._\n\n**Installation**\n\nOnce the document is opened, it prompts the user to enables the macro. Once the content\nis enabled, an AutoOpen() subroutine is called, which will run the malicious Visual Basic for\nApplications (VBA) macro wherein a PowerShell script is executed via\nBitsTransfer, downloads three different files of the Taurus Project from the Github site,\nthen saves them in a Temp folder with predefined names.\n\n_Figure 3: The obfuscated VBA macro code_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe macro contains the URL of the payload as a combination of the following obfuscations:\nBase64 encoded and reversed string.\n\nUpon decrypting the obfuscated macro code, we see the PowerShell script, as shown in\nFigure 4.\n\n_Figure 4: The decrypted PowerShell script used to download the payload._\n\nFurther, these three files get downloaded from Github and dropped in the %Temp%\ndirectory. The three files are:\n\n1.    GeTNht.com → saved with the name “j2tyq.com” → Legitimate AutoIt3.exe\n\n2.    bAMI.com → saved with the name “st6zh” → Base64-encoded AutoIt script having\ncertificate header\n\n3.    wsNcf.com → saved with the name “wsNcf.com” → Taurus Stealer\n\nHere, PowerShell is using the Certutil.exe command to decode the payload and execute it\non the victim's machine.\n\n[The Twitter handle @3xp0rt, which exposes documents from a Russian hacking forum,](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1254079067810336768)\nshows some of the claims of the Taurus project.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: The Taurus project claims to have the stealing ability of malware._\n\nThe author claims that Taurus has the following stealing capabilities:\n\nStealing cookies, Auto-form details, browsing history, and credit card information from\nChromium- and Gecko-based browsers.\nCookies and passwords from Microsoft Edge browsers.\nCredential stealing of some cryptocurrency wallets, including Electrum, MultiBit,\nEthereum, Jaxx Liberty, Bytecoin, Atomic, and Exodus\nStealing credential of FTP clients, including FileZilla, WinFTP, and WinSCP\nStealing session files from applications, including Discord, Steam, Telegram, and\nAuthy\nStealing account information of the Battle.Net service\nStealing Skype history\nStealing credentials from NordVPN\nStealing credentials from Pidgin, Psi+, and Psi\nStealing credentials from Foxmail and Outlook\nCollects system information, such as system configuration and list of installed\nsoftware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: The_ _[Taurus login panel.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a30ef818603b0a0f2b8153d9ba6e9494447373e86599bcc7c461135732e64b2/detection)_\n\nThe Taurus project has also built a dashboard where the attacker can keep an eye on the\ninfection counts according to geolocations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 7: The Taurus dashboard to see infection count according to geolocation.](https://twitter.com/MalwareInt/status/1257838534993621002/photo/3)_\n\nThis dashboard also provides the attacker with the ability to customize the configuration of\nTaurus.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 8: The attacker can update the configuration of Taurus in the dashboard.](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1254079343581675525/photo/2)_\n\n**Technical analysis of the payload**\n\nOnce PowerShell downloads the three different files from the GitHub repository, it uses the\nutility “Certutil.exe” to decode the payload. Out of three downloaded files, the first one is an\nAutoIT interpreter that is used to run the decoded AutoIT script. Then, Certutil.exe decrypts\nthe second file, which is a Base64-encoded AutoIT file having a certificate as a header. This\nAutoIT file will decrypt the third file, which is the Taurus Stealer.\n\nAfter deobfuscating the AutoIT script, we noticed that it has multiple anti-sandbox\ntechniques. It checks for the Sleep patch in the sandbox using the GetTickCount function.\n\n_Figure 9: The anti-sandbox patch with the GetTickCount API._\n\nIt also checks for the existence of specific files, the computer name, and internet\nconnectivity using the Ping function.\n\n_Figure 10: Taurus performs multiple checks for files, the computer name, and internet_\n_connectivity._\n\nFinally, the AutoIT script reads and decodes the wsNcf.com file, then loads the\ndeobfuscated shellcode for injecting the decoded payload into dllhost.exe.\n\n_Figure 11: Building a path for dllhost.exe._\n\nFigure 12 shows details of the deobsfucated shellcode, which will inject the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: The shellcode checking for the executable to inject in the dllhost.exe._\n\nBefore starting the actual activity of the stealer, the malicious program is started by loading\nconfiguration into memory step by step.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: Storing config into memory._\n\nWe have successfully been able to see the further activity of the malicious program, which\nis the actual purpose of this malware—stealing.\n\nFigure 14 shows the system information being fetched by the stealer.\n\n_Figure 14: The system information fetched by the stealer._\n\n**Fileless approach**\n\nWhile disassembling the code, we figured out that all the stolen data is being sent as a Zip\nfile. Interesting part is that malware allocates a memory space for the Zip file and embeds\nthe Zip file directly to the request data.\n\n_Figure 15: All the stolen data is put into a Zip file._\n\n**Network Communication**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter zipping all the stolen data, the malicious program tries to send that data to a\nCommand and Control (C&C) server after building the URL at run time, which is also predefined in the malicious program (Ofcourse XORed).\n\n_Figure 16: The URL building to send the stolen data to the C&C._\n\nURL pattern: http://<Domain>/gate/cfg/?post=<digit>&data=<data>\n\n**Cloud Sandbox detection**\n\nWe have analyzed the sample in the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox and successfully detected the\nmalware.\n\n_Figure 17: The Zscaler Cloud Sandbox successfully detected the malware._\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe are actively monitoring for new threats in the Zscaler cloud to protect our customers.\nWe have added details of this malware to our threat library.\n\nVBA - [https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/3e4e094a-66e1-407a-8b42-7a683a54bfb1/](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/3e4e094a-66e1-407a-8b42-7a683a54bfb1/)\n\nEXE - [https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/b26933a4-31f8-4618-a6cf-775f8a383116/](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/b26933a4-31f8-4618-a6cf-775f8a383116/)\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping**\n\n\n-----\n\nT1064 Macros in document used for code execution.\n\nT1086 PowerShell commands to execute payloads\n\nT1132 Data Encoding\n\nT1020 Automated Exfiltration\n\nT1003 Credential Dumping\n\nT1503 Credentials from Web Browser\n\nT1539 Steal Web Session Cookie\n\nT1106 Execution through API\n\nT1518 Software Discovery\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\nECCD93CFA03A1F1F4B2AF649ADCCEB97 - Doc file\n\n3E08E18CCC55B17EEAEEDF3864ABCA78 - Encrypted AutoIT script\n\n221BBAC7C895453E973E47F9BCE5BFDC - Encrypted Taurus Stealer\n\n5E3EA2152589DF8AE64BA4CBB0B2BD3B - Decrypted Taurus Stealer\n\n**CnC:**\n\nbit-browser[.]gq\n\nAtest001[.]website\n\n**Panel**\n\n64.225.22[.]106/#/login\n\n\n-----",
