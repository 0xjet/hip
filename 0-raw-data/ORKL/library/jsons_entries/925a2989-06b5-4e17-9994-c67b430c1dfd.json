Some of CLOP’s victims this year alone include Stanford\n**University Medical School, the University of California, and University of Maryland.**\n\nA still shot from a video showing Ukrainian police seizing a Tesla, one of many high-end vehicles\n\nseized in this week’s raids on the Clop gang.\n\nAccording to [a statement and videos released today, the Ukrainian Cyber Police charged six](https://www.npu.gov.ua/ua/news/kiberzlochini/kiberpolicziya-vikrila-xakerske-ugrupovannya-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-virusu-shifruvalnika-ta-nanesenni-inozemnim-kompaniyam-piv-milyarda-dolariv-zbitkiv/)\ndefendants with various computer crimes linked to the CLOP gang, and conducted 21\nsearches throughout the Kyiv region.\n\nFirst debuting in early 2019, CLOP is one of several ransomware groups that hack into\norganizations, launch ransomware that encrypts files and servers, and then demand an\nextortion payment in return for a digital key needed to unlock access.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PqGaZgepNTE\n\n/\nCLOP has been especially busy over the past six months exploiting four different zero-day\nvulnerabilities in File Transfer Appliance (FTA), a file sharing product made by Californiabased [Accellion.](https://www.accellion.com/company/security-updates/mandiant-issues-final-report-regarding-accellion-fta-attack/)\n\nThe CLOP gang seized on those flaws to deploy ransomware to a significant number of\nAccellion’s FTA customers, including U.S. grocery chain Krogers, the law firm Jones Day,\nsecurity firm Qualys, and the Singaporean telecom giant Singtel.\n\nLast year, CLOP adopted the practice of attempting to extract a second ransom demand\nfrom victims in exchange for a promise not to publish or sell any stolen data. Terabytes of\ndocuments and files stolen from victim organizations that have not paid a data ransom are\nnow available for download from CLOP’s deep web site, including Stanford, UCLA and the\nUniversity of Maryland.\n\n\n-----\n\nCLOP’s victim shaming blog on the deep web.\n\nIt’s not clear how much this law enforcement operation by Ukrainian authorities will affect the\n[overall operations of the CLOP group. Cybersecurity intelligence firm Intel 471 says the law](https://www.intel471.com/)\nenforcement raids in Ukraine were limited to the cash-out and money laundering side of\nCLOP’s business only.\n\n“We do not believe that any core actors behind CLOP were apprehended, due to the fact that\nthey are probably living in Russia,” Intel 471 concluded. “The overall impact to CLOP is\nexpected to be minor although this law enforcement attention may result in the CLOP brand\n[getting abandoned as we’ve recently seen with other ransomware groups like DarkSide and](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/darkside-ransomware-gang-quits-after-servers-bitcoin-stash-seized/)\n[Babuk” [links added].](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/)\n\nWhile CLOP as a moneymaking collective is fairly young organization, security experts say\n[CLOP members hail from a group of Threat Actors (TA) known as “TA505,” which MITRE‘s](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/)\n**ATT&CK database says is a financially motivated cybercrime group that has been active**\nsince at least 2014. “This group is known for frequently changing malware and driving global\ntrends in criminal malware distribution,” MITRE assessed.\n\n\n-----",
