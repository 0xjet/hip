In case of\nfailure to fully decrypt, It is further found that this backdoor needs the check code bound to\nthe host to run normally. Then the researchers cracked the check code and successfully ran\nthe backdoor. Judging from some behavioral functions, this is a top-tier APT backdoor, but\nfurther investigation requires the attacker's asymmetric encrypted private key to activate the\nremote control function. Based on the most common string \"Bvp\" in the sample and the\nnumerical value 0x47 used in the encryption algorithm, the team named the corresponding\nmalicious code \"Bvp47\" at the time.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, “The Shadow Brokers” published two batches of hacking files claimed to\nbe used by \"The Equation Group\". In these hacking files, researchers form Pangu Lab found\nthe private key that can be used to remotely trigger the backdoor Bvp47. Therefor, It can be\nconcluded that Bvp47 is a hacker tool belonging to \"The Equation Group\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough further research, the researchers found that the multiple procedures and attack\noperation manuals disclosed by \"The Shadow Broker\" are completely consistent with the\nonly identifier used in the NSA network attack platform operation manual [References 3 and\n4] exposed by CIA analyst Snowden in the \"Prism\" incident in 2013.\n\nIn view of the US government's prosecution of Snowden on three charges of \"spreading\nnational defense information without permission and deliberately spreading confidential\ninformation\", it can be determined that the documents published by \"The Shadow Brokers\"\nare indeed NSA, which can fully prove that \"The Equation Group\" belongs to NSA, that is,\nBvp47 is the top-tier backdoor of NSA. Besides the files of \"The Shadow Brokers\" revealed\nthat the scope of victims exceeded 287 targets in 45 countries, including Russia, Japan,\nSpain, Germany, Italy, etc. The attack lasted for over 10 years. Moreover, one victim in Japan\nis used as a jump server for further attack.\n\nPangu Lab has a code named \"Operation Telescreen\" for several Bvp47 incidents.\nTelescreen is a device imagined by British writer George Orwell in his novel \"1984\". It can be\nused to remotely monitor the person or organization deploying the telescreen, and the\n\"thought police\" can arbitrarily monitor the information and behavior of any telescreen.\n\nThe Equation Group is the world's leading cyber-attack group and is generally believed to be\naffiliated with the National Security Agency of the United States. Judging from the attack\ntools related to the organization, including Bvp47, Equation group is indeed a first-class\nhacking group. The tool is well-designed, powerful, and widely adapted. Its network attack\ncapability equipped by 0day vulnerabilities was unstoppable, and its data acquisition under\ncovert control was with little effort. The Equation Group is in a dominant position in nationallevel cyberspace confrontation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Translations:\n\n[\"中文\" |](https://www.pangulab.cn/post/the_bvp47_a_top-tier_backdoor_of_us_nsa_equation_group/)\n\n\n-----",
