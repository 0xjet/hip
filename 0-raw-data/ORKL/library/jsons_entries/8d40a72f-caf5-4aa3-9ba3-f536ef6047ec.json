PRC statesponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and\nallied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property\nand develop access into sensitive networks.\n\nThis joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state,\nlocal, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Defense\nIndustrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends and persistent\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nNSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private\nsector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section and\nAppendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from\nPRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.\n\nFor more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s China\nCyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, FBI’s [Industry Alerts, and NSA’s](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts)\n[Cybersecurity Advisories & Guidance.](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Cybersecurity-Advisories-Guidance/)\n\n[Download the PDF version of this report: pdf, 409 KB](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/06/2003092365/-1/-1/0/Joint_CSA_Top_CVEs_Exploited_by_PRC_cyber_actors_.PDF)\n\n### Technical Details\n\nNSA, CISA, and FBI continue to assess PRC state-sponsored cyber activities as being one\nof the largest and most dynamic threats to U.S. government and civilian networks. PRC\nstate-sponsored cyber actors continue to target government and critical infrastructure\nnetworks with an increasing array of new and adaptive techniques—some of which pose a\nsignificant risk to Information Technology Sector organizations (including telecommunications\nproviders), Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizations, and other critical\ninfrastructure organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nPRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities and use publicly\navailable tools to target networks of interest. NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC statesponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as software\nand hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive\nnetworks.

Many of the\nCVEs indicated in Table 1 allow the actors to surreptitiously gain unauthorized access into\nsensitive networks, after which they seek to establish persistence and move laterally to other\ninternally connected networks.

It is awaiting**\n**reanalysis, which may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw**\nwas found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A\nmalicious actor could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the\ndirectories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not\nprotected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied,\" these requests can\nsucceed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code\nexecution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache\n2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see\nCVE-2021-42013).\n\n**Recommended Mitigations**\n\nApply update or patch.\n\n**Detection Methods**\n\nCommercially available scanners can detect CVE.\n\n**Vulnerable Technologies and Versions**\n\nApache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50\n\nFedoraproject Fedora 34 and 35\n\nOracle Instantis Enterprise Track 17.1-17.3\n\nNetapp Cloud Backup\n\n### Revisions\n\nInitial Publication: October 6, 2022\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.cisa.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa22-279a)\n\n\n-----",
