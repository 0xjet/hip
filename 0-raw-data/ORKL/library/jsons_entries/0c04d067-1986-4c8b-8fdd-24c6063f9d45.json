Criminals steal\ncard data during online shopping. Who are behind these notorious hacks, how does it\nwork, and how have Magecart attacks evolved over time?\n\n[About Magecart](https://sansec.io/what-is-magecart)\n\n**North Korean state sponsored hackers are implicated in the interception of online**\n**payments from American and European shoppers, Sansec research shows. Hackers**\n**associated with the APT Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA1** **group were found to be breaking**\n\n\n-----\n\n**into online stores of large US retailers and planting payment skimmers as early as**\n**May 2019.**\n\nPreviously, North Korean hacking activity was mostly restricted to banks and South Korean\ncrypto markets,2 covert cyber operations that earned hackers $2 billion, according to a 2019\nUnited Nations report .3 As Sansec’s new research shows, they have now extended their\nportfolio with the profitable crime of digital skimming.\n\n\nSansec researchers have attributed the activity to HIDDEN COBRA because infrastructure\nfrom previous operations was reused. Furthermore, distinctive patterns in the malware code\nwere identified that linked multiple hacks to the same actor.\n\n## HIDDEN COBRA & digital skimming\n\nDigital skimming, also known as Magecart,4 is the interception of credit cards during online\nstore purchases. This type of fraud has been growing since 2015 and was traditionally\ndominated by Russian-5 and Indonesian-speaking6 hacker groups. This is no longer the\ncase, as the incumbent criminals now face competition from their North Korean\ncounterparts.\n\n\nIn order to intercept transactions, an attacker needs to modify the computer code that runs\nan online store. HIDDEN COBRA managed to gain access to the store code of large\nretailers such as international fashion chain Claire’s7 . How HIDDEN COBRA got access is\nyet unknown, but attackers often use spearphishing attacks (booby-trapped emails) to\nobtain the passwords of retail staff.\n\nUsing the unauthorized access, HIDDEN COBRA injects its malicious script into the store\ncheckout page. The skimmer waits for keystrokes of unsuspecting customers. Once a\ncustomer completes the transaction, the intercepted data - such as credit card numbers are sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.\n\n## Italian model agency as money mule\n\nCuriously, HIDDEN COBRA used the sites of an Italian modeling agency and a vintage\nmusic store from Tehran to run its global skimming campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo monetize the skimming operations, HIDDEN COBRA developed a global exfiltration\nnetwork. This network utilizes legitimate sites, that got hijacked and repurposed to serve as\ndisguise for the criminal activity. The network is also used to funnel the stolen assets so\nthey can be sold on dark web markets. Sansec has identified a number of these exfiltration\nnodes, which include a modeling agency8 from Milan, a vintage music store9 from Tehran\nand a family run book store10 from New Jersey.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nSansec monitors millions of online stores for skimming activity and typically finds 30 to 100\ninfected stores per day. Many cases have a common modus operandi, such as shared\ninfrastructure or striking features in programming style. These traits can be obvious, such\n\n\n-----\n\nas the debug message Success bro that led to the arrest of three Indonesians in\nDecember .6 However, sometimes they are more subtle, as is the case with HIDDEN\nCOBRA.\n\nSansec research has identified multiple, independent links between recent skimming\nactivity and previously documented North Korean hacking operations. The following\ndiagram shows (a small subset of) victim stores in green and HIDDEN COBRA controlled\nexfiltration nodes in red. Yellow indicates a uniquely identifying modus operandi (or TTP),\nwhich will be discussed next.\n\n### The first campaign: clienToken=\n```\n<script src=\"https://www.luxmodelagency.com/wp-includes/js/customize-gtag.min.js\">\n</script>\n\n```\nOn June 23rd, 2019, Sansec discovered a skimmer on a US truck parts store that uses a\ncompromised Italian modeling site11 to harvest payment data. The injected script\n\n\n`customize-gtag.min.js` 12 is scrambled with a popular Javascript obfuscator13. Hidden\nin the code, the string `WTJ4cFpXNTBWRzlyWlc0OQ== is found, which is the double-base64`\nencoded representation of `clientToken= . This particular keyword is later used as HTTP`\n\n\n-----\n\nGET parameter to send the stolen payload to the collector exfiltration node. The specific\nencoding and the attempt to disguise the stolen payload as “clientToken” form a uniquely\nidentifying characteristic.\n\nThe malware was removed within 24 hours but a week later, the very same malware\nresurfaced on the same store. This time, it used a New Jersey book store to harvest credit\ncards14:\n```\n<script src=\"https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/js/gmaps.min.js\"></script>\n\n```\nDuring the following months, Sansec discovered the same malware on several dozen\nstores. Each time, it uses one of these hijacked sites as loader and card collector:\n```\nstefanoturco.com (between 2019-07-19 and 2019-08-10)\ntechnokain.com (between 2019-07-06 and 2019-07-09)\ndarvishkhan.net (between 2019-05-30 and 2019-11-26)\nareac-agr.com (between 2019-05-30 and 2020-05-01)\nluxmodelagency.com (between 2019-06-23 and 2020-04-07)\nsignedbooksandcollectibles.com (between 2019-07-01 and 2020-05-24)\n\n### The second campaign: __preloader\n\n```\nIn February and March 2020, several domain names were registrered that closely resemble\npopular consumer brands:\n```\n2020-02-10 PAPERS0URCE.COM\n2020-02-26 FOCUSCAMERE.COM \n2020-03-21 CLAIRES-ASSETS.COM \n\n```\n\nSubsequently, Sansec found the web stores of the three corresponding brands\ncompromised with payment skimming malware installed. The anonymously registered\ndomains were used as loader and card collector15.\n\nThe three malware cases not only share infrastructure (domain registrar & DNS service),\nbut they also share a particularly odd code snippet, that Sansec has not observed\nanywhere else. The three relevant malware segments are displayed below for reference.\nCommon behavior: upon form submission a hidden, dynamic image is added to the page\nwith the deceptive name `__preloader . The image address is controlled by the attacker,`\nand the intercepted and encoded payload is sent as argument to this image, along with\n\n\n-----\n\nseveral random numbers. Immediately, the dynamic image is removed from the page, so\nthe theft is invisible to the customer. Sansec has previously discussed this exfiltration\nmethod when it first reported on the Claire’s hack on June 15th .7\n\n_(code slightly modified for readability)_\n\nThe common code, behavior, registrar and DNS server are unique traits that link these\ncases to the same source.\n\n## The North Korean link\n\nAs the diagram above shows, Sansec has established multiple, independent links to\npreviously documented North Korean hacking activity. We will discuss each link separately.\n\n**technokain.com**\n\nSouth Korea based EST Security has published two articles16 17 documenting a North\nKorea-attributed attack where a malicious loader is embedded in Korean office documents.\nThe loader installs remote access software for Windows on the victim’s computer, which is\ndownloaded from this address:\n```\n2019-07-12 https://technokain.com/ads/adshow1.dat\n\n```\nAdditionally, US-based security firm Rewterz reported a spearphishing attack targeting\nattendees of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas18. This attack uses\nmalware from the same address.\n\nThese attacks took place on July 11 and 12th, less than a week after the placement of a\nskimmer on the same site:\n```\n2019-07-06 https://technokain.com/vendor/jquery.validate.min.js\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### darvishkhan.net\n\nBoth Fortiguard Labs19 and EST Security20 document a DPRK-attributed spearphishing\ncampaign that took place between June 26th and July 2nd 2019. The campaign used\nmalicious Korean office documents containing malware installers, where remote access\nsoftware was downloaded from:\n\n```\n2019-06-27 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/update6.dat \n\n```\nTwo weeks earlier, multiple digital skimmers were launched from the same site, harvesting\ncredit cards from several US, UK and Australia-based stores:\n```\n2019-06-12 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-includes/js/hotjar.min.js\n2019-06-14 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-includes/js/dist/gtm.min.js\n\n```\n**areac-agr.com**\n\nOn October 25, Beijing-based Netlab360 discovered a novel remote access trojan (RAT)\nthat showed multiple similarities with previously DPRK attributed malware21. Components of\nthe tool were loaded from\n```\n2019-10-25 http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/check.vm\n\n```\nBefore and after the presence of this malware, digital skimmers were hosted on the same\nsite, that would intercept payments from multiple American stores:\n```\n2019-08-16 https://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-includes/Requests/Security1.3.min.js\n2020-05-01 https://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-includes/Requests/Utility/json.min.js\n\n### papers0urce.com\n\n```\nThe three malware domains from the `__preloader campaign use distinct IPs. One of`\nthem - `papers0urce.com - uses an address from Dutch ISP Leaseweb,`\n\n```\n23.81.246.179 . This IP is not known to have been used for other domain names since\n\n```\n201522, however, it is featured in the same North Korea research as the previously\ndiscussed `areac-agr.com` 21. The IP is hardcoded in the RAT, and used as a command\nand control (C2) server.\n\n### Discussion\n\n\nDoes the usage of common loader sites, and the similarity in time frame, prove that the\nDPRK-attributed operations are run by the same actor as the skimming operations?\nTheoretically, it is possible that different nefarious actors had simultaneous control over the\nsame set of hijacked sites, but in practice, this would be extremely unlikely. First, thousands\nof sites get hacked each day23, making an overlap highly coincidental. Secondly, when a\nsite gets hacked, it is common practice for a perpetrator to close the exploited vulnerability\nafter gaining access, in order to shield the new asset from competitors.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSansec has found proof of global skimming activity that has multiple, independent links to\npreviously documented, North Korea attributed hacking operations. Sansec believes that\nNorth Korean state sponsored actors have engaged in large scale digital skimming activity\nsince at least May 2019.\n\n## References\n\n[1. https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra](https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra) ↩\n\n2. https://www.cyberscoop.com/north-korea-sanctions-lazarus-group-treasury\ndepartment/ ↩\n\n3. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-cyber-un/north-korea-took-2-billion-in\ncyberattacks-to-fund-weapons-program-u-n-report-idUSKCN1UV1ZX ↩\n\n[4. https://sansec.io/what-is-magecart](https://sansec.io/what-is-magecart) ↩\n\n[5. https://sansec.io/research/magento-bruteforce-dashboard](https://sansec.io/research/magento-bruteforce-dashboard) ↩\n\n\n[6. https://sansec.io/research/magecart-hackers-arrested](https://sansec.io/research/magecart-hackers-arrested) ↩ ↩2\n\n\n[7. https://sansec.io/research/magecart-corona-lockdown](https://sansec.io/research/magecart-corona-lockdown) ↩ ↩2\n\n[8. http://luxmodelagency.com/](http://luxmodelagency.com/) ↩\n\n[9. https://www.darvishkhan.net/](https://www.darvishkhan.net/) ↩\n\n[10. https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/](https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/) ↩\n\n\n[11. https://urlscan.io/result/e84b5381-4c24-4bff-b2f3-c600a07538d1/#transactions](https://urlscan.io/result/e84b5381-4c24-4bff-b2f3-c600a07538d1/#transactions) ↩\n\n12. https://urlscan.io/responses/9fe97ae18c45e22fe76b8bd5165d0e152bec464d92ef5f73\n\n19b1723aba1c0edb/ ↩\n\n[13. https://obfuscator.io/](https://obfuscator.io/) ↩\n\n[14. https://urlscan.io/result/18e3546d-8da0-49ac-9484-450a8ed90cd5/#transactions](https://urlscan.io/result/18e3546d-8da0-49ac-9484-450a8ed90cd5/#transactions) ↩\n\n[15. https://urlscan.io/result/f2052c0e-7df1-4b3a-b008-35476683a82f/#transactions](https://urlscan.io/result/f2052c0e-7df1-4b3a-b008-35476683a82f/#transactions) ↩\n\n[16. https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2416](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2416) ↩\n\n[17. https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2418](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2418) ↩\n\n\n-----\n\n18. https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-news/rewterz-threat-alert-ces-themed-targeting\nfrom-lazarus ↩\n\n19. https://fortiguard.com/resources/threat-brief/2019/08/09/fortiguard-threat-intelligence\nbrief-august-09-2019 ↩\n\n[20. https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2397](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2397) ↩\n\n\n[21. https://blog.netlab.360.com/dacls-the-dual-platform-rat-en/](https://blog.netlab.360.com/dacls-the-dual-platform-rat-en/) ↩ ↩\n\n\n2\n\n\n[22. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/23.81.246.179/relations](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/23.81.246.179/relations) ↩\n\n23. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameslyne/2013/09/06/30000-web-sites-hacked-a-day\nhow-do-you-host-yours/#135be6dd1738 ↩\n\n[data-size=\"large\" > Follow @sansecio](https://twitter.com/sansecio)\n\n\n-----",
