Ursnif/Gozi is\nactive from over a decade and was one of the most active malwares listed in 2017 and 2018. Today it constantly\nreaches several organization across Italy presenting itself in several ways, for instance as a malicious document\ndelivered through email.\n\nThe malware has evolved over time and has added functionality, in fact, apart from collecting banking credentials it is\nalso able to collect keystrokes, cryptocurrencies, screenshots, webmail, integrating spyware features together with\nbanking Trojans features.\n\nDuring their investigations, researchers of ZLab Yoroi-Cybaze intercept a new variant of this malware delivered\nthrough malspam campaign towards Italian companies. This latest Ursnif variant shows the same modus operandi: a\nmalicious document in which is embedded an highly obfuscated VBA macro that acts as a first stage dropper.\n\n### The Ursnif Threat Evolution\n\nAccording to [Microsoft since its appearance in 2009, Ursnif has shown incredible capabilities to steal users’](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?name=Win32/Ursnif)\ncredentials, credentials for local webmail, cloud storage, cryptocurrency exchange platforms and e-commerce sites\nwhile remaining more stealthiness as possible. It uses many advanced trick to evade several sandboxes environment\nand today is the most popular malware spreading in the wild. ZLab researchers have studied many samples in the\npast to profile the techniques used by the malware, to track its evolution and sophistication over time.\n\nTable 1: Ursnif techniques evolution\nFirst analyzed sample backs to January 2018. That Ursnif variant has delivered through a macro document and\nconsist of a few obfuscated stage and a process hollowing injection technique to execute its payload. After few\nmonths, in June 2018, we find evidence that Ursnif was delivered through Necurs Botnet. The latter is one of the\nmost famous botnets known nowadays and it has been used to deliver this Ursnif variant. The hidden link among\n[necurs and ursnif has been discovered by ZLab researchers as explained in this link. In December 2018, a first shift is](https://www.difesaesicurezza.com/en/cyber-en/the-cybercrime-has-targeted-italy-with-necurs-botnet-and-ursnif-malware/)\nabout the implementation of many dropper stages, in order to hide the final payload; moreover, in order to execute its\npayload, the malware does not perform a classical process injection as in the previous samples but an APC injection,\nnot yet seen as payload injection trick used by Ursnif.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample spread in February 2019 use two new features: the first one is a several obfuscated powershell stages in\norder to evade AVs and reduce its detection, the second one is the use of steganography technique. The latter permit\nto hide code into a legit image manipulating specific bits. Next, another code perform a decryption and execution of\nmalicious code into the victim machine.\n\nIn March 2019 another weaponized variant of Ursnif has been detected: in this case, to spread the malicious software,\na google drive document combined with an obfuscated VBA Script is used over steganography. The last sample\nshown in previous table is similar to February’s sample but include another interesting feature: in this case a first VBS\nstage is encrypted using the Vigenere cipher; this allow to hide its malicious code and evade many sandboxes\nenvironment. We are observing a continuous evolution due to several features added in few months, this is an\nindicator that this malware is still in development and, observing also features fragmentation among variants lets us\nthink, with high confidence, that there are various fork of the same codebase spreading in the wild.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**Sha 256** 34669dde1e33ec96147540433f60e90056d38df1e3bb952fdc600e979d74f690\n\n**Threat** Ursnif dropper\n\n\n**Descrizione**\n**Breve**\n\n\nExcel with macro\n\n\n**ssdeep** 1536:hn1DN3aMePUKccCEW8yjJTdrBX/3t4k3hOdsylKlgryzc4bNhZFGzE+cL4LgldAK:hn1DN3aM+UKc\n\nTable 2: information about Ursnif dropper\n\nThe most widespread infection vector observed were the macro enabled office documents, and this variant uses the\nsame technique too. The malicious document looks like an invoice that requires enabling macros in order to proper\nview its contents.\n\nFigure 1: excel document requiring macro enabling\nThe whole infection chain begins when the macro is enabled. This Ursnif variant presents a macro protection\ntechnique technique that it’s not present in previous variants, in order to make the analysis hard avoiding manipulation\nand extraction. After extraction of OLE object inside the document we are able to see the content of macros and their\nassociated name, as shown in the following figure:\n\nFigure 2: macros isolation\nNow it is possible to isolate an interesting macro in order to further analyze it in detail. It contains a piece of VBA that\nwas extracted.\n\nFigure 3: VB macro source code\nIn a different way than the past waves, the malware author added a “VigenereDo” function to decrypt and reconstruct\nthe initial infection step, using an algorithm based on the Vigenère cipher, a classical polyalphabetic cipher.\n\nThe resulting command text is obtained combining the obfuscated strings defined in “jeneric” function with other\nstrings (not visible in figure) and after further some manipulations is possible to spot the whole script will be executed.\nWhen user enable macros, the “wmic.exe” process run the following code through the “wmic 'PRocesS'  \"Call\"\n_'CREATe'” command._\n\nFigure 4: the powershell script (crypted)\nSo, at this point, several powershell deobfuscation steps occurs. First of all, every value (“${1F}”) defined in the ps\nstring is replaced with content stored into “$1F” variable corresponding to “,” (comma) character. After having replaced\nthese values, the script is run through “iex” primitive invoked by “.($psHomE[4]+$pshOMe[34]+'X')” and next through “(\n_\". ( `$ShELLid[1]+`$shelLID[13]+'X')”. The complete deobfuscated script is the following._\n\nFigure 5: the first powershell script (decrypted)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: image with malicious embedded powershell script\n\nFirst of all the malware checks the current TimeZone in order to verify if it is set on +01:00. If true, it download the\nnext stage from “hxxps://i[.]imgur[.]com/TVkWKQa[.]png”. As well as in other [recent attacks, the downloaded image](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/ursnif-long-live-the-steganography/)\nhides another powershell stage leveraging steganography techniques.\n\nThe malware code iterates over each pixel of the image and through several mathematical binary operation converts\ngrabs the two Least Significant Bits of every byte of the picture, concatenating them with other LSBs to produce a\ncomplete Powershell code.\n\nFigure 7: second powershell script extracted from the steganographic image\nEt voilà, another URL is found but, before download the next stage from it, the malware perform a further checking in\norder to evaluate the value returned by “CurrentCulture”.\n\nFigure 8: CurrentCulter verification in powershell\nIf check is verified, once again through the “IEX” primitive it try to download other components named\n“ose000000.exe” from “hxxps://nuovalo[.]site/RGI82B3.-tmp-tmp”, saving it into “%TEMP%” folder. In the following\ntable are shown the information about sample.\n\n**Sha 256** 0f2245eec921949d9a1d8e13cab747a7fbb137aaee3b9ddacee0681c8b2e4fa8\n\n**Threat** Ursnif\n\n**Descrizione Breve** Final payload of Ursnif banking malware\n\n**ssdeep** 6144:LCLAh6EzJYJtmavTXyulcNcyuo8PGJMewXo79y:L54EzetmCb3cNc3o0PR4\n\nTable 3: information about Ursnif final payload\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis latest Ursnif wave keeps showing a complex infection process. The starting point of the entire chain was the\nusual Visual Basic macro, this time protecting its code with a Vigenère cipher, responsible of the decryption of the\nadditional Powershell stage launched abusing the Windows Management Infrastructure (WMI) functionalities,\ndecoupling it to the original infection tree and then completing the infection chain exploiting steganography techniques\nto bypass network detection and several environmental check, to ensure the malware is running into expected\nmachines confirming the highly evasive trend of this aggressive malware threat.\n\n## Indicator of Compromise\n\nHashes:\n\n34669dde1e33ec96147540433f60e90056d38df1e3bb952fdc600e979d74f690\n0f2245eec921949d9a1d8e13cab747a7fbb137aaee3b9ddacee0681c8b2e4fa8\n\nDropurl:\n\nhxxps://i[.]imgur[.]com/TVkWKQa[.]png\nhxxps://nuovalo[.]site/RGI82B3.-tmp-tmp\n\nC2:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://nuovalo[.]icu/images/VYs5UVqTBYpg/\nNLIzhwT9sEr/k5V7J2HpECsh9Q/PEQNY9sYYk6JJwA_2F2Bo/pJhVLIob8XfZrIAv/Z4Kfzn93mPtOoBm/\nXSvYLd89VPxLpVwdy4/wEwkKFt2N/HAOr6bgXfRaPw2gN3hlS/qqBsTeYAfyj/qODGq[.]avi\n\n### Yara Rules\n```\nimport \"pe\"\nrule Ursnif_documentDropper_201904 {\nmeta:\n     description = \"Yara rule for Ursnif loader - April 2019 version\"\n     author = \"Yoroi - ZLab\"\n     last_updated = \"2019-04-02\"\n     tlp = \"white\"\n     category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n     $a1 = { 43 6F 77 61 6E 64 43 6F 77 }\n     $a2 = { 56 69 67 65 6E 65 72 65 44 6F }\n     $b1 = \"xlTickLabelPositionNextToAxis\" ascii wide\ncondition:\n     all of them\n}\nrule Ursnif_201904 {\nmeta:\n     description = \"Yara rule for Ursnif - April 2019 version\"\n     author = \"Yoroi - ZLab\"\n     last_updated = \"2019-04-02\"\n     tlp = \"white\"\n     category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n     $a1 = \"PECompact2\" ascii wide\ncondition:\n     all of them and pe.imphash()==\"09d0478591d4f788cb3e5ea416c25237\"\n}\n\n```\n_This blog post was authored by Davide Testa and Antonio Pirozzi of Cybaze-Yoroi Z-LAB_\n\n\n-----",
