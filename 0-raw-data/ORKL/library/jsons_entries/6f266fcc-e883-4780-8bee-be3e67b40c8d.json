This uncommon whitespace in its server responses represents\none of the characteristics Fox-IT has been leveraging to identify Cobalt Strike Servers, with\n\n\n-----\n\nhigh confidence, for the past one and a half year. In this blog we will publish a full list of\nservers for readers to check against the logging and security controls of their infrastructure.\n\nCobalt Strike is a framework designed for adversary simulation. It is commonly used by\npenetration testers and red teamers to test an organization’s resilience against targeted\nattacks, but has been adopted by an ever increasing number of malicious threat actors.\n\nSubtle anomalies like these should not be underestimated by blue teams when it comes to\ncombating malicious activity.\n\n## About Cobalt Strike\n\nCobalt Strike is a framework designed for adversary simulation. It is commonly used by\npenetration testers and red teamers to test an organization’s resilience against targeted\n[attacks. It can be configured using Malleable C&C profiles which can be used to customize](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2)\nthe behavior of its beacon, giving users the ability to emulate the TTP’s of in the wild threat\nactors. The framework is commercially and publicly available, which has also led to\npirated/cracked versions of the software.\n\nThough Cobalt Strike is designed for adversary simulation, somewhat ironically the\nframework has been adopted by an ever increasing number of malicious threat actors: from\nfinancially motivated criminals such as Navigator/FIN7, to state-affiliated groups motivated by\n[political espionage such as APT29. In recent years, both red teams and threat actors have](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\nincreasingly made use of publicly and commercially available hacking tools. A major reason\nfor this is likely their ease of use and scalability. This two-sided element of pentesting suites\nmakes it a critical avenue for threat research.\n\n### Cobalt Strike Team Servers\n\nWhile the implant component of Cobalt Strike is called the “beacon”, the server component is\nreferred to as the “team server”. The server is written in Java and operators can connect to it\nto manage and interact with the Cobalt Strike beacons using a GUI. On top of collaboration,\nthe team server also acts as a webserver where the beacons connect to for Command &\nControl, but it can also be configured to serve the beacon payload, landing pages and\narbitrary files.\n\nCommunication to these servers can be fingerprinted with the use of Intrusion Detection\nSystem (IDS) signatures such as Snort, but with enough customization of the beacon, and/or\nusage of a custom TLS certificate, this becomes troublesome. However, by applying other\nfingerprinting techniques (as described in the next section) a more accurate picture of the\nCobalt Strike team servers that are publicly reachable can be painted.\n\n## Identifying Cobalt Strike Team Servers\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of Fox-IT s [InTELL analysts, with a trained eye for HTTP header anomalies, spotted an](https://www.fox-it.com/intell/)\nunusual space in the response of a Cobalt Strike team server in one of our global\ninvestigations into malicious activity. Though this might seem irrelevant to a casual observer,\ndetails such as these can make a substantial difference in combating malicious activity, and\nwarranted additional research into the set-up of the team servers. This ultimately led to FoxIT being able to better protect our clients from actors using Cobalt Strike.\n\n[The webserver of the team server in Cobalt Strike is based on NanoHTTPD, an opensource](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd-java-1.1)\nwebserver written in Java. However this webserver unintendedly returns a surplus\nwhitespace in all its HTTP responses. It is difficult to see at first glance, but the whitespace is\nthere in all the HTTP responses from the Cobalt Strike webserver:\n\nUsing this knowledge it is possible to identify NanoHTTPD servers, including possible Cobalt\nStrike team servers. We found out that public NanoHTTPD servers are less common than\nteam servers. Even when the team server uses a Malleable C2 Profile, it is still possible to\nidentify the server due to the “extraneous space”.\n\nThe “extraneous space” was fixed in Cobalt Strike 3.13, released on January 2nd of 2019.\nThis means that this characteristic was in Cobalt Strike for almost 7 years, assuming it used\nNanoHTTPD since the first version, released in 2012. If you look carefully, you can also spot\n[the space in some of the author’s original YouTube videos, dating back to 2014.](https://youtu.be/XkBvo6z0Tqo?t=540)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fact that the removal of this space is documented in the change log leads us to believe\nthat the Cobalt Strike developers have become aware of the implications of such a space in\nthe server response, and its potential value to blue teams.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe change log entry highlighted above refers to the removed space being extraneous, in a\nliteral sense meaning not pertinent or irrelevant. Due to its demonstrated significance as\nfingerprinting mechanism, this description is contested here.\n\n### Scanning and results\n\n[By utilizing public scan data, such as Rapid7 Labs Open Data, and the knowledge of how to](https://opendata.rapid7.com/)\nfingerprint NanoHTTPD servers, we can historically identify the state of publicly reachable\nteam servers on the Internet.\n\nThe graphs shows a steady growth of Cobalt Strike (NanoHTTPD) webservers on port 80\nand 443 which is a good indication of the increasing popularity of this framework. The decline\nsince the start of 2019 is most likely due to the “extraneous space” fix, thus not showing up in\nthe scan data when applying the fingerprint.\n\nIn total Fox-IT has observed 7718 unique Cobalt Strike team server or NanoHTTPD hosts\nbetween the period of 2015-01 and 2019-02, when based on the current data (as of 26 Feb\n[2019) from Rapid7 Labs HTTP and](https://opendata.rapid7.com/sonar.http/) [HTTPS Sonar datasets.](https://opendata.rapid7.com/sonar.https/)\n\nThe table below contains several examples of Cobalt Strike team servers, used by malicious\nthreat actors:\n\n**IP Address** **First seen** **Last seen** **Actor**\n\n95.128.168.227 2018/04/24 2018/05/22 APT10\n\n185.82.202.214 2018/04/24 2018/09/11 Bokbot\n\n206.189.144.129 2018/06/05 2018/07/03 Cobalt Group\n\nThe full list of Cobalt Strike team servers identified using this method can be found on the\n[following Fox-IT GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/fox-it/cobaltstrike-extraneous-space)\n\nDo note that possible legitimate NanoHTTPD servers are listed here and that some IP\naddresses may have been rotated and reused swiftly, for example due to being part of\nAmazon or Azure cloud infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore we recommend to investigate connections to these IP addresses within the\ncorresponding time ranges. A starting point is to verify whether requested URI matches a\nCobalt Strike beacon checksum, or by using historical DNS data using passive DNS. Going\nbeyond this can be done in various ways and we challenge readers to use their investigative\ncreativity.\n\nPlease also note that this list contains servers of both legitimate and illegitimate operations,\nsince these cannot be distinguished easily. Fox-IT recognizes the merit of building and\ndistributing offensive tooling, particularly for security testing purposes. In our opinion the\nbenefits of publishing this list (allowing everyone to detect unwanted attacks retroactively)\noutweigh the downsides, which could include potentially affecting ongoing red team\noperations. We believe that we all have an interest in raising the bar of security operations,\nand therefore increasing visibility across the board will inform a higher level of operational\nsecurity and awareness on all sides.\n\n### Network IDS Signatures\n\nFox-IT developed a Snort rule for network detection. The rule checks for the “extraneous\nspace” in the HTTP header. Please note that this detection rule only works to detect plaintext\nHTTP traffic to and from Cobalt Strike Team servers with the Cobalt Strike version up until\nrelease 3.13. Nevertheless, this is still a valuable detection rule, considering threat actors\ntend to use pirated and cracked- and therefore inherently unsupported- versions.\n\nThis file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently\nthan what appears below.

The IP addresses can be checked\nwith e.g. firewall and proxy logs, or on aggregate against SIEM data. To minimize the\namount of false positives, the reader is urged to take the corresponding first and last\nseen dates into consideration.\nFor the ‘red team readers’ of this blog looking for ways to avoid their Cobalt Strike team\nserver being both publicly available and easy to fingerprint, see the Cobalt Strike Team\nServer Population Study blog for a detailed set of mitigations. Furthermore, Red Teams\nare encouraged to critically examine their toolsets in use or rely on their Blue Team, for\npotential tell-tales and determine the appropriate way to apply and mitigate such\nfindings for both Red and Blue team purposes.\n\nWatch this space (pun intended) for further analysis on this subject.\n\n\n-----",
