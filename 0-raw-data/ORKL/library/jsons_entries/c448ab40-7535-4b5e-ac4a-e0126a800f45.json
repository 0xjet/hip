    "plain_text": "# Linux/CDorked FAQs\n\n**blogs.cisco.com/security/linuxcdorked-faqs**\n\nMary Landesman May 1, 2013\n\nLast Friday (April 26), [ESET and](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/04/26/linuxcdorked-new-apache-backdoor-in-the-wild-serves-blackhole/) [Sucuri simultaneously blogged about the discovery](http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/apache-binary-backdoors-on-cpanel-based-servers.html)\nof [Linux/CDorked, a backdoor impacting Apache servers running cPanel. Since that](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=29133)\nannouncement, there has been some confusion surrounding the exact nature of these\n[attacks. Rather than reinvent the analysis that has already been done, this blog post is](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/04/26/linuxcdorked-new-apache-backdoor-in-the-wild-serves-blackhole/)\nintended to clear up some of the confusion.\n\n**_When did Linux/CDorked first appear?_**\n\nAccording to Cisco TRAC analysis, the first encounter was on March 4, 2013.\n\n**_How is Linux/CDorked related to DarkLeech?_**\n\nThe appearance of Linux/CDorked coincided with a drop in the number of DarkLeech\ninfections, an indication the attacker(s) may be one and the same.\n\nUnlike DarkLeech, the Linux/CDorked infections appear to be only targeting Apache servers\nwith cPanel installed. Conversely, DarkLeech was found on servers running a variety of\ncontrol panels (or not).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Why are cPanel installs being targeted?_**\nThat cPanel installs are targeted does not imply attackers are exploiting a vulnerability in\ncPanel to gain access. Rather, Linux/CDorked exploits the fact that cPanel doesn’t use a\npackaging system to install Apache. This, along with some logging differences, makes it\nmuch more difficult to detect the backdoor on Apache servers running cPanel, which is key\nto its success.\n\n**_How are attackers gaining access to the host servers?_**\nHow the attackers are gaining root access to begin with is a separate matter, still unresolved.\nAttackers may have stolen login credentials via phishing, or via a localized infection on a\nmanagement system, or simply by brute-force guessing the login.\n\n**_Who are the compromised hosts?_**\nThe compromised host servers observed thus far have all been smaller, less mainstream\nproviders. This is also in contrast to DarkLeech, which netted some significantly sized host\nproviders in those attacks.\n\n**_How many websites have been affected?_**\nWhile there have been thousands of encounters with Linux/CDorked injected sites, decoding\nthe URLs reveals only a few hundred compromised sites, unlike DarkLeech, which affected\nthousands of innocent websites.\n\nThe size (number of impacted websites) isn’t the whole story, however. The Linux/CDorked\n[attacks appear to be in concert with local trojan Medfos infections. The Medfos family of](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Win32%2fMedfos)\ntrojans installs browser extensions which automatically redirect search results when clicked.\nAs a result, 37% of the encounters with the Linux/CDorked injected sites have been via\nsearches performed on Google, Bing, and Yahoo.\n\n**_What exploits are involved?_**\n[The Linux/CDorked attackers are using Blackhole exploit kit v4. Hence, when a Web surfer](http://www.malwaresigs.com/2013/01/29/bek2-variant-4/)\nclicks through a link to one of the sites hosted on the compromised server, the visited URL is\nbase64 encoded before the request is handed off to the malware domain. The exploits we’ve\nobserved have been a mix of known PDF and Java exploits, no zero days. Thus far, all\nobserved malware domains (the actual redirect destination) track back to 7 unique IP\naddresses:\n\n94.23.48.114\n62.212.130.115\n178.17.41.212\n109.123.66.30\n94.242.251.151\n94.23.47.211\n87.229.26.138\n\n\n-----\n\nReference Links:\n[Linux/Cdorked.A: New Apache backdoor being used in the wild to serve Blackhole](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/04/26/linuxcdorked-new-apache-backdoor-in-the-wild-serves-blackhole/)\n[Apache Binary Backdoors on Cpanel-based servers](http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/apache-binary-backdoors-on-cpanel-based-servers.html)\n[Malicious Apache Linux/Cdorked.A Trojan in Compromised Web Servers](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=29133)\n[Admin beware: Attack hitting Apache websites is invisible to the naked eye](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/admin-beware-attack-hitting-apache-websites-is-invisible-to-the-naked-eye/)\n[Apache DarkLeech Compromises](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/apache-darkleech-compromises/)\n\nShare:\n\n\n-----",
