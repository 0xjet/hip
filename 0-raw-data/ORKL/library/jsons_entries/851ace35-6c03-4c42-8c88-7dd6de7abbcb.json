The researchers believed the malware operators are related to the China-based cybercrime group Rocke, a\nmalicious team detected in 2019 for using cloud-targeted malware.\n\nIn recent days, security researchers have detected that the financially-motivated Rocke hacking group is using a new piece of Cryptojacking\nmalware named Pro-Ocean to target all the vulnerable servers of Apache ActiveMQ, Oracle WebLogic, and Redis.\n\nThe Pro-Ocean Cryptojacking malware is equipped with an advanced rootkit and worm capabilities, also using the most advanced techniques\nand tactics as a way of bypassing security appliances, EDR and AV.\n\n## Modus Operandi\n\nThis new piece of malware is using the XMRig miner, which is disreputable for its use in every Cryptojacking operation. Some key point about\nthe malware are:\n\n_[The binary is packed using UPX. This means that the actual malware is compressed inside the binary and is extracted and executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX)_\n_during the binary execution._\n_Advanced static analysis tools can unpack UPX binaries and scan their content. However, in this case, the UPX magic string has been_\n_deleted from the binary, and therefore, static analysis tools cannot identify this binary as UPX and unpack it._\n_The modules are gzipped inside the unpacked binary._\n_The XMRig binary is inside one of the gzipped modules and is also packed by UPX and does not have the UPX magic string._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn detail, the Pro-Ocean malware was developed in Go, which is organized with an x64 architecture binary, and it generally targets the typical\ncloud apps like Apache ActiveMQ, Oracle Weblogic, and Redis.\n\n## Modules & Functions\n\nThe malware uses four modules of Pro-Ocean, and these modules are gzipped inside the binary and are removed and executed one by one\nwith four different functions.\n```\nmain_ReleaseExe\nmain_ReleaseExelk\nmain_ReleaseExerkt\nmain_ReleaseExescan\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**The Four modules are:**\n```\nRootkit Module\nMining Module\nWatchdog Module\nInfection Module\n\n## List of the vulnerable software\n\n```\nAccording to the **[report, Pro-Ocean also operates to eliminate opposition by killing other malware and miners, and all these include Luoxk,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pro-ocean-rocke-groups-new-cryptojacking-malware/)**\nBillGates, XMRig, and Hashfish, and all these runs on the negotiated host.\n\nIn detail, this malware also comes with a watchdog module that is being written in Bash that guarantees endurance and takes care of\ndismissing all the processes that are being utilized by more than 30% of the CPU with the purpose of mining Monero efficiently.\n\nApart from this, more information are yet to extract, as the experts are trying to circulate all the necessary details regarding this malware. So,\nthe list of vulnerable software are still not finite; however, this malware is an illustration that demonstrates cloud providers’ agent-based\nsecurity answers.\n\n[More details about this threat here.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pro-ocean-rocke-groups-new-cryptojacking-malware/)\n\n[Pedro Tavares](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/author/pipocaz/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**ed o** **a a es s a p o ess o a** t e e d o o at o secu ty o g as a t ca ac e / e teste, a a e esea c e a d a so a\n[Security Evangelist.
