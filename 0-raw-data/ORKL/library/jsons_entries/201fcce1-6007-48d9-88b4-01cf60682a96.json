The malware uses a highly-modularized\narchitecture and is designed around a central component, called a dispatcher.\n\nThis is not strange, as most malware uses a modularized structure. However, Attor shows its sophistication by the use of encryption to hide the\nmodules, something seen only on very rare occasions, and in malware strains usually developed by nation-state hacker groups.\n\n\"Attor's plugins are delivered to the compromised computer as DLLs, asymmetrically encrypted with RSA,\" Hromcová said. \"The plugins are\nonly fully recovered in memory, using the public RSA key embedded in the dispatcher. As a result, it is difficult to obtain Attor's plugins, and to\ndecrypt them without access to the dispatcher.\"\n\nOver the course of the past year, Hromcová and other ESET researchers have spent months toiling over Attor to decipher its secrets.\nEventually, they had a breakthrough.\n\n\"We were able to recover eight of Attor's plugins,\" she said.\n\nThe Slovak researcher said they found a module for taking screenshots, one for recording audio, one to upload files to a remote server, one for\nsetting up a SOCKS proxy to disguise its traffic, a keyboard and clipboard logger, an installer watchdog, a device monitor, and a module to\nsupport communications via the Tor network.\n\n\n-----\n\nattor structure.png\n\n\nImage: ESET\n\n### The GSM fingerprinting module\n\nOf all the plugins, by a very wide margin, the most interesting one was the module that performed device monitoring.\n\nThis module, found in many other malware strains, usually works by creating a fingerprint of devices a user connects to a computer or laptop.\nFor example, POS malware uses similar modules to detect when certain types of devices are connected, so they can watch for incoming data\nstreams that may contain payment card data.\n\nOther malware strains uses similar modules to detect when users plug in a USB thumb drive, to plant malware-laced files on its storage.\n\nHowever, Attor's device monitor module was specifically designed to detect when users connected modems and older phones to their devices.\nWhen this happened, Attor would collect info about the files present on each device.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ s odu e] s espo s b e o co ect o o etadata, ot t e es t e se es, so e co s de t a p ug used o de ce ge p t g, a d\nhence likely used as a base for further data theft,\" Hromcová said.\n\nBut there was more. Attor's device monitoring module also included a very strange function that used ancient AT commands to fingerprint\nGSM-capable devices.\n\n\"Whenever a modem or a phone device is connected to a COM port, Device monitor uses AT commands to communicate with the device, via\nthe associated serial port,\" Hromcová said.\n\nAT commands were developed in the 80s as a way to control with early versions of internet modems. They are still supported today, even on\nmodern high-end smartphones -- all of which come with modems to be able to connect to a telco provider's LTE network.\n\nThe Attor device monitor module used these ancient commands to determine when targets were connecting GSM equipment to their\ncomputers.\n\nBut here's the catch. The Attor gang was completely ignoring modern smartphones connected via USB. Stealing or planting malware on\nsmartphones via the USB port would have been much easier than using AT commands via old serial ports.\n\n### Malware targeting spies?\n\nESET speculates that Attor creators specifically created this module to target users who employed older mobile handsets -- or even a custom\nGSM-capable platform used by one of their targets.\n\n\"In this scenario, it is possible the attackers have learned about the victim's use of these devices using some other reconnaissance\ntechniques,\" Hromcová said.\n\nMany diplomatic and intelligence operations use custom GSM-capable platforms for secure communications -- showing just how targeted this\nmalware really was.\n\nWhile ESET didn't provide any thoughts on who might have developed and deployed Attor, it is clear that this malware was used by some of\nthe world's most sophisticated espionage players.\n\n[More in ESET's 32-page Attor report [PDF].](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Attor.pdf)\n\n**The world's most famous and dangerous APT (state-developed) malware**\n\n\n-----",
