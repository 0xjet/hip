A number of APT33 domains previously identified in a\n[TrendMicro report on obfuscated command and control infrastructure — zeverco[.]com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=zeverco.com&owner=Common+Community)\n[(oliverleftley@inbox[.]com),](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/emailaddress.xhtml?emailaddress=oliverleftley%40inbox.com&owner=Common+Community) [service-eset[.]com (wata.nakatsu@mail[.]com),](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service-eset.com&owner=Common+Community) [simsoshop[.]com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=simsoshop.com&owner=Common+Community)\n[(tsuda2016@mail[.]com), and](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/emailaddress.xhtml?emailaddress=tsuda2016%40mail.com&owner=Common+Community) [qualitweb[.]com (tsuyukisogawa@inbox[.]lv) — began](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=qualitweb.com&owner=Common+Community)\n[resolving to 109.230.199[.]157 starting in late July 2020. At this time, we do not know if this](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=109.230.199.157&owner=Common+Community)\nIP address is a sinkhole or parking IP used for previous malicious infrastructure. Further, we\ndon’t know the extent to which the aforementioned domains are still under APT33’s control. If\n109.230.199[.]157 is a sinkhole or not under APT33’s control, then the following additional\ninfrastructure is not necessarily associated with APT33 and may be associated with a\ndifferent actor.\n\nSeveral additional domains not previously associated with APT33 or other actors’ activity\nalso began resolving to this IP in the last two months. The identified domains (and their\nregistrants when known) include the following:\n\n[publicsecur[.]com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=publicsecur.com&owner=Common+Community)\n\n[akadnsplugin[.]com (joshua.toon1978@mail[.]com)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=akadnsplugin.com&owner=Common+Community)\n\n[service-houston[.]com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service-houston.com&owner=Common+Community)\n\n[support-newyork[.]com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=support-newyork.com&owner=Common+Community)\n\n[ocsp-support[.]com (warren.jones2626@mail[.]com)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=ocsp-support.com&owner=Common+Community)\n\nGiven our uncertainty on whether the previous domains and 109.230.199[.]157 IP address\nare under APT33’s control, we do not know if these domains are also associated with\nAPT33. Regardless, they merit further scrutiny as some of them were registered through\nsuspicious resellers like THCservers that various state and criminal actors have used to\nprocure infrastructure.\n\nAlso of note, the ocsp-support[.]com domain may be associated with two other domains —\n[prefmsedge[.]com (warren.jones6363@inbox[.]lv) and](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=prefmsedge.com&owner=Common+Community) [tracking-protection[.]net](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=tracking-protection.net&owner=Common+Community)\n[(warrenjones39458@protonmail[.]com) — based on the reuse of the “Warren Jones” strings](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/emailaddress.xhtml?emailaddress=warrenjones39458%40protonmail.com&owner=Common+Community)\nin the email address. Unlike ocsp-support[.]com, these domains were registered through\nAminServe.\n\n**ThreatConnect Research Team Intelligence: Items recently created or updated in the**\nThreatConnect Common Community by our Research Team.\n\n[20200908B: File Matching YARA Rule Associated to RedDelta PlugX ThreatConnect](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=3960880511#/)\nResearch identified a RedDelta PlugX binary and extracted Command and Control\nlocations from the embedded configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\n20200909A: CDN and News-spoofing Probable Phishing Domains Hosted at\n185.228.83[.]110 ThreatConnect Research identified a set of suspicious domains\nhosted on a probable dedicated server that spoof various content delivery networks\n(CDNs), news organizations, and file sharing sites. At least one of the domains was\nidentified in phishing activity spoofing an Italian organization. Additional associated\ndomains were identified based on SSL certificate reuse.\n\n**Technical Blogs and Reports Incidents with Active and Observed Indicators: Incidents**\nassociated to one or more Indicators with an Active status and at least one global\nObservation across the ThreatConnect community.
