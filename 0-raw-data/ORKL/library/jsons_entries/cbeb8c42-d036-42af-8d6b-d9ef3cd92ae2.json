Gh0st Remote Administration\nTool was created by a Chinese hacking group named C. Rufus Security Team that released it\npublicly in 2008. The public release of Gh0st RAT source code made it easy for threat actors\nto obtain and tailor the tool to their needs. Its feature set expanded over the years to include\nvarious surveillance, persistence, and information-stealing capabilities:\n\nTaking full control of the infected machine\nRecording keystrokes in real time with offline logging available\nAccessing live web cam feeds including microphone recording\nDownloading files remotely\nRemote shutdown and reboot\nDisabling user input\n\nOver Gh0st RAT’s long life, Chinese nation-state threat actors have used it to breach highvalue targets such as governments, embassies, economic targets, and media. One such\nbreach was the operation known as “GhostNet” in 2009, in which a large-scale cyber-attack\nused Gh0st RAT to conduct surveillance and espionage. The breach impacted the Dalai\nLama’s Tibetan exile centers in multiple countries.\n\nAlthough Gh0st RAT was first identified in reports of threat activity almost 15 years ago, it is\nstill actively distributed today. Cofense Intelligence identified an email targeting a Europeanowned medical technology organization located in China, attempting to deliver Gh0st RAT\nvia an embedded link. The embedded link that hosted the malware was affiliated with\nTencent and based in Hong Kong. The sample’s command and control (C2) server is also\nlocated on the CHINANET Jiangsu province network in the city of Nanjing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: A screenshot of the recent phishing email used to deliver Gh0st RAT via an_\n_embedded link._\n\n_Figure 2: A translation of the body of the recent Gh0st RAT campaign shows that it used an_\n_unpaid invoice as a theme._\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough Ghost RAT has a history of use by nation-state threat actors, Cofense Intelligence\ndoes not have conclusive evidence that this recent campaign is associated with known\nnation-state activity. The activity we observed activity shares certain characteristics with\nsome advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including APT27, which is known for\nintellectual property theft against healthcare and technology companies, and is also known\nfor the use of Gh0st RAT. However, since Gh0st RAT’s source code is publicly available, it\nremains plausible that any threat actor could download and modify the code for their own\nneeds. With Chinese universities (including more than one in Nanjing) being heavily involved\nin training talent for the Chinese defense industry, it is also plausible that students or other\nthreat actors that are at times associated with APT groups may be carrying out independent\nthreat activity using tools they are familiar with.\n\n_Figure 3: Details of the recent Gh0st RAT sample’s C2 server on the network information_\n_service Shodan._\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nFiles\n\n1680478346389.zip\nMD5: 9e6c45b6b8b20bf3c5959dbba8f27117\n\nLiveUpdate360.dat\nMD5: f149d3f3ef0361ebe4d346811f29b527\n\nLiveUpdate.exe\nMD5: 96e4b47a136910d6f588b40d872e7f9d\n\nsetting.ini\nMD5: 91aab4bbe634be62d11d132738c23a82\n\n\n-----\n\nSqlVersion9.dll\nMD5: 317f9ff06c076e87e5b1d11242396d5f\n\nú¿╡τ-╫╙-╖ó-╞▒ú⌐.exe\nMD5: 4723a2a8f68c1eaf82809cff29b8e56f\n\nURLs\n\nhxxps://api[.]youkesdt[.]asia/admin/down/hash/79b7c6ed-c4d8-4b36-b1cd-f968e6570010\n\nhxxp://datacache[.]cloudservicesdevc[.]tk/picturess/2023/SqlVersion9[.]dll\n\nhxxp://datacache[.]cloudservicesdevc[.]tk/picturess/2023/Media[.]xml\n\nhxxp://datacache[.]cloudservicesdevc[.]tk/picturess/2023/LiveUpdate360[.]dat\n\nhxxp://datacache[.]cloudservicesdevc[.]tk/picturess/2023/LiveUpdate[.]exe\n\nhxxp://datacache[.]cloudservicesdevc[.]tk/picturess/2023/223[.]114[.]txt\n\nCommand and Control\n\nhxxp://61[.]160[.]223[.]114:18076\n\n_All third-party trademarks referenced by Cofense whether in logo form, name form or product_\n_form, or otherwise, remain the property of their respective holders, and use of these_\n_trademarks in no way indicates any relationship between Cofense and the holders of the_\n_trademarks.
