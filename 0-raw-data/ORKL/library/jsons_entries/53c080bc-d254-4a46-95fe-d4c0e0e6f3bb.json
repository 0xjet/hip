Based on our research, SWEED —\nwhich has been operating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with\nstealers and remote access trojans.\n\nSWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns have featured a\nmyriad of different types of malicious documents, the actor primarily tries to infect its\nvictims with a packed version of Agent Tesla — an information stealer that's been around\nsince at least 2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly from\n[what we've seen in the past in the way that it is packed, as well as how it infects the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/10/old-dog-new-tricks-analysing-new-rtf_15.html)\nsystem. In this post, we'll run down each campaign we're able to connect to SWEED,\nand talk about some of the actor's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).\n\n## 2017: Steganography\n\nOne of the earliest SWEED campaigns Talos identified dates back to 2017. In this attack,\nthe actors placed droppers inside of ZIP archives, and then attached those ZIPs to\n\n\n-----\n\nemails. The attachments usually had file names similar to Java_Updater.zip or P-O of\nJun2017.zip\". Here's an example of an email associated with this campaign:\n\nThe attached ZIP archive contained a packed version of Agent Tesla. The packer uses\n.NET and leverages steganography to hide and decode a second .NET executable,\nwhich uses the same technique to retrieve the final Agent Tesla payload. Here's the file\nstored in the resource:\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd here s the algorithm used to decode the PE stored in that image:\n\nThe decoded binary is stored in the array.\n\n## January 2018: Java droppers\n\nIn early 2018, we observed that SWEED began leveraging Java-based droppers. Similar\nto previous campaigns, the JAR was directly attached to emails and used file names\nsuch as \"Order_2018.jar\". The purpose of the JAR was to obtain information about the\ninfected system and facilitate the download of a packed version of Agent Tesla.\nInterestingly, only a few months prior to these campaigns, a HackForums user with the\naccount name \"Sweed\" actively sought out a Java crypter — but we'll get to that activity\nlater.\n\n## April 2018: Office exploit (CVE-2017-8759)\n\nIn April 2018, SWEED began making use of a previously disclosed Office exploit. One of\nthe documents featured in these email campaigns was notable because it was a\nPowerPoint document (PPXS). Code contained inside one of the slides triggers an\nexploit for [CVE-2017-8759, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft .NET](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8759)\nframework.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can see the execution of external content hosted on the attacker-controlled web\nserver using the file name \"chuks.png\". As expected, the PNG is not actually an image.\nInstead, it is a Soap definition in XML, as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nThe purpose of this code is to decode a URL and download a PE32 hosted on an\nattacker-controlled web server. The resulting executable is a packed version of Agent\nTesla.\n\n## May 2018: Office exploit (CVE-2017-11882)\n\nIn May 2018, campaigns being conducted by SWEED began leveraging another\nvulnerability in Microsoft Office: [CVE-2017-11882, a remote code execution bug in](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882)\nMicrosoft Office that is commonly observed being leveraged in malicious documents\nused in commodity malware distribution.\n\nWe see how the vulnerability abuses the Equation Editor in Office when executing the\nsample in [ThreatGrid:](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-grid/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs seen below, the malicious document is designed to appear as if it is an invoice.\n\nAs consistent with previous campaigns, the purpose of this malicious document is to\ndownload and execute a packed version of Agent Tesla.\n\n## 2019: Office macros and AutoIT droppers\n\nBeginning in 2019, the campaigns associated with SWEED began leveraging malicious\nOffice macros. As with previous attacks, they are leveraging spear-phishing emails and\nmalicious attachments to initiate the infection process.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attached XLS contains an obfuscated VBA macro, which executes a PowerShell\nscript using a WMI call. The PowerShell script is also obfuscated using XOR operations\nto hide its code. Once decoded, it reveals itself to be .NET.\n\nThis .NET code is responsible for performing some checks and downloading another\nexecutable file. The obfuscation scheme used in this code is the same as the one used\nin the previously described PowerShell. The downloaded file is then saved and\nexecuted.\n\n_Call graph after WMI execution._\n\nThe downloaded binary is an AutoIT-compiled script. The script has a lot of junk code\ndesigned to make the analysis more difficult and time-consuming.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Extracted AutoIT script._\n\nThe strings and some of the commands contained in the AutoIT script have been\nobfuscated using XOR operations, as described below.\n\nThe decoder receives two hex strings: The first is the string to deobfuscate, while the\nsecond determines the number of rounds of the XOR operation. The XOR operation is\nperformed on each character against the length of the second parameter. This operation\nis then repeated for as many times as the length with the length and the position. If the\nlength value is one, then the operation is repeated twice using the same key, which\nleads to a plaintext hex string.\n\nAfter performing environment checks, the malware will reconstruct the assembly code\nwhich is obfuscated in a hex string. Using the AutoIT scripting language Dll* family\nfunctions the code is loaded into the current process address space.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Memory allocation_\n\nFinally, the malware executes the assembly code with two arguments. The first argument\nis the path for an executable. This assembly will create a process with the executable\nand will inject the payload into this process.\n\nAs expected, the final payload in this campaign is another packed version of Agent\nTesla.\n\n## UAC bypass\n\nOne of the common characteristics with several of the campaigns associated with\nSWEED is the use of various techniques to bypass User Account Control (UAC) on\ninfected systems. An example of this is present within the campaigns observed in 2019.\nWhen the malware is first executed on systems, it executes \"fodhelper.exe\", which is a\nWindows process running as high integrity. Prior to executing it, the malware sets the\nfollowing registry key:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\n\nThis registry key points to the location of the malicious executable:\n\nThis key is used by \"fodhelper.exe\" and its value is executed as administrator whenever\nfodhelper.exe is executed. This functionality simply allows for the malware to bypass\nUAC and is not a privilege escalation vulnerability — the user must already have\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrative access rights on the system. It is used to avoid displaying a UAC prompt\nto the user. This second instance of the malware is then executed with administrative\naccess to the infected system.\n\n## SWEED infrastructure\n\nThe various distribution campaigns linked to SWEED feature use of a limited amount of\ndistribution and C2 infrastructure with the same servers used across many different\ncampaigns over long periods of time. The majority of the registrants associated with the\ndomains used by SWEED list the following email addresses:\n\naaras480@gmail[.]com\nsweed.[redacted]@gmail[.]com\n\nThe registrant contact information used to register most of the domains is also\nconsistent:\n\nIn April 2018, a security researcher published a [screenshot of an RDP server believed to](https://twitter.com/mrglaive/status/987780707551469569)\nhave been actively leveraged by SWEED (84.38.134[.]121):\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the screenshot above, the list of user accounts established on the RDP server can be\nseen, which includes an account named \"sweed.\" The fact that multiple users are\ncurrently active indicates that this server is being used in a multi-user capacity and\nprovides a platform on which members of SWEED can function collaboratively. This also\nlikely indicates a business relationship between multiple individuals responsible for these\nongoing malware distribution campaigns.\n\nWe also identified several DDNS domains which were being used to facilitate\nconnectivity to the shared RDP server that feature many of the same values as the RDP\nuser accounts:\n\n_sweedoffice[.]duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-olamide[.]duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-chuks[.]duckdns[.]org_\n_www.sweedoffice-kc.duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-kc.duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-goodman.duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-bosskobi.duckdns[.]org_\n_www.sweedoffice-olamide.duckdns[.]org_\n_www.sweedoffice-chuks.duckdns[.]org_\n\nDuring our analysis of various campaigns associated with SWEED, we identified several\ncommon elements that also reflect the distinct values associated with users of the RDP\nserver. In many cases, the distribution servers being used to host malicious PE32 being\ndistributed by SWEED contained a directory structure consisting of multiple directories\ncontaining the binaries being distributed. In many cases, the binary file names used, as\nwell as the directory names used to host the malicious content reflected the same users\npresent on the RDP server.\n\nFor example, in June 2019, the following URLs were hosting malicious content\nassociated with these campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\n_hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/chuks.exe_\n_hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/sweed.exe_\n_hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/duke.exe_\n\nLikewise, when investigating samples associated with known domains used to exfiltrate\nsensitive information from infected systems, we can see the following binary file names\nbeing used repeatedly across campaigns over a long period of time:\n\n_dadi.exe_\n_kelly.exe_\n_chuks.exe_\n_olamide.exe_\n_sweed.exe_\n_kc.exe_\n_hero.exe_\n_goodman.exe_\n_duke.exe_\n_hipkid.exe_\n\nIn several cases, the directory structure present on the distribution servers contained\nmultiple directories hosting malicious files, an example listing below using the domain\nsodismodisfrance[.]cf:\n\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/2/chuks.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/6/chuks.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/5/goodman.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/1/chuks.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/1/hipkid.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/5/sweed.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/2/duke.boys.exe_\n\nThese appear to match the handles used by actors known to be associated with\nSWEED. Another known domain used to exfiltrate sensitive information collected by\nAgent Tesla is sweeddehacklord[.]us. Analysis of known malware seen communicating\nwith this domain shows similar patterns of operations.\n\nIn analyzing the malware activity associated with SWEED, we also investigated the use\nof interesting paths in the hosting of the administration panels associated with the\nvarious RATs and stealers being distributed by this group. Indeed, on a single C2 server,\nwe identified several panel with the following URLs:\n\n_sweed-office.comie[.]ru/goodman/panel_\n_sweed-office.comie[.]ru/kc/panel/_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/omee/panel/login.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/humble1/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/sima/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/omee/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/kc/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/olamide/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/jamil/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/niggab/panel/post.php_\n\n\n-----\n\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/humble2/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/harry/panel/post.php_\n\nBased on our research, as well as the panel-hosting locations, we believe that wiki,\nolamide, chuks, kc, goodman, bosskobi, dadi, hipkid, and others are SWEED customers\nor business associates. Using the binary file names, directory structures, and other\nartifacts, we have been able to identify interesting online behavior and interests exhibited\nacross various hacking forums, IRC servers, etc. that appear to link some of these users\nwith various elements of the malware distribution campaigns.\n\nThere are several other domains that can be linked to SWEED that appear to be\nassociated with various malware families and distribution campaigns. These have been\nobserved to resolve to the IP associated with the aforementioned RDP server, as well.\n\n_sweeddehacklord[.]us_\n_sweed-office.comie[.]ru_\n_sweed-viki[.]ru_\n\n### Use of typosquatting\n\nAnother interesting element of many of the campaigns associated with SWEED is the\nuse of typosquatting for the domains used to host the packed Agent Tesla binaries that\nhave been distributed over the past few years.\n\n_Victims' geographic dispersion._\n\nLooking at the victimology from a country point of view it is clear that there is no\ngeographic focus, when choosing their target. SWEED target companies all over the\nworld.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Breakdown of victim's activity by industry._\n\nThe breakdown by activity however does show a clear tendency for manufacturing and\nlogistics companies.\n\nHere's a rundown of these domains, along with the companies they are supposed to look\nlike and the industry that the company is associated with. In some cases we were unable\nto determine the targeted organization from the typosquatted domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all of the domains listed above, the registrant account information associated with the\ndomains is consistent with what we have identified as associated with SWEED campaign\nactivity.\n\n## Operational Security (OPSEC)\n\nWe identified various behavior on hacking forums, IRC channels, and other web sites\nthat appeared consistent with the TTPs we observed with the actor distributing this\nmalware.\n\n### \"SWEE D\"\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our analysis, we identified a user on HackForums using the moniker SWEE D.\nIn most of the online posts associated with this user, their contact information was\nincluded in the post and listed the Skype address \"sweed.[redacted]\".\n\nIn the months leading up to the January 2018 campaigns, we observed this user posting\nasking for access to a Java crypter. Typically, crypters are used to help evade antivirus\ndetection as they \"crypt\" the contents of the malicious payload being distributed.\n\nThe same user posted repeatedly in threads related to Java crypters, and even annoyed\nother users with how often they were posting:\n\nThe same Skype account listed in the HackForums posts was also used by someone\nusing the name \"Daniel\" in 2016 while commenting on a blog related to the creation of\nFacebook phishing pages:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis same Skype account was also used in 2015 by someone going by the name \"\n\n[redacted] Daniel.\"\n\nNote: [redacted] is also the name used in the email address associated with the\nregistrant account for the domain wlttraco[.]com (sweed.[redacted]@gmail.com).\n\nWe also located screenshots that were [published on the Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sS55752750/status/983260208091852800/photo/1) [.sS!.! showing](https://twitter.com/sS55752750)\nthe Discord server \"Agent Tesla Live\" that listed sweed ([redacted] Daniel) as a member\nof the staff.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that the avatar used by this Discord user (SWEE D) is the same\navatar that is used by Skype user sweed.[redacted].\n\nWe actually contacted SWEE D on Skype and were able to confirm that the same user\noperates the Discord and Skype accounts:\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our interaction with SWEE D, they mentioned that they are a student studying\nethical hacking and that they work in the IT departments of various companies to help\nremove malware and increase their security.\n\nThis is contrary to the following activity which was observed in an IRC transaction where\na user named \"sweed\" was submitting credit card information to a bot listening in the\nchannel in an effort to check the validity and usability of presumably stolen credit card\ninformation.\n\nThe IRC channel appeared to be created and used solely for this purpose, with a bot\nnamed \"chkViadex24\" returning information related to the credit card that was submitted:\n\nThis is an example demonstrating how stolen credit information is actively being used by\nadversaries to determine whether or not they can monetize the information once they\nhave stolen it from victims.\n\nIt's possible that \"SWEE D\", \"sweed\" and [redacted] Daniel may be the same person.\nWe also identified the following LinkedIn profile that listed the same name:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis account lists Nigeria as their location. \"[redacted]\" is a Nigerian novel. Many of the\ndetails we identified during our analysis of \"sweed,\" such as information in the LinkedIn\nprofile, the references to \"[redacted],\" the registrant information used, and the location\nlisted in the Skype account indicate the individual is likely located in Nigeria. We believe\n\"sweed\" is a key member of the group and that other accounts are likely associated with\ncustomers or business partners.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSWEED has been active for at least three years — and a user with that name has been\nactive on various forums, IRC channels and Discord servers since at least 2015.\nCurrently, SWEED is actively targeting small and medium-sized companies around the\nworld. Based on the TTPs used by this group, SWEED should be considered a relatively\namateur actor. They use well-known vulnerabilities, commodity stealers and RATs (Pony,\nFormbook, UnknownRAT, Agent Tesla, etc.) and appear to rely on kits readily available\non hacking forums. SWEED consistently leverages packing and crypting in order to\nminimize detection by anti-malware solutions. We assess that SWEED also does not\nhave effective operational security, as they used several of the same online accounts for\nabout five years, allowing for the discovery of a lot of their information, operations and\nassociates.\n\nAt this time, we cannot say with certainty whether the other accounts and associated\nindividuals associated with SWEED are business associates or customers. However,\nthey all use the same infrastructure in a coordinated manner across domains, rely on the\nsame malware and packers, and all operate very similarly. While SWEED is relatively\nwell-known in the security research community, this research provides insight into how\nthese cybercriminal organizations operate and evolve over time in an effort to maximize\ntheir ability to generate revenue and evade detection. We expect SWEED to continue to\noperate for the foreseeable future and we will continue to monitor their activities to\nensure that customers remain protected.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\nAdvanced Malware Protection\n[(AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nexecution of the malware detailed in\nthis post.
