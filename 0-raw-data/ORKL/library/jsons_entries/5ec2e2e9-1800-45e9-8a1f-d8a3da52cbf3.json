The attackers involved in these email campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nleveraged a variety of distribution mechanisms to deliver the information stealing FormBook\nmalware, including:\n\nPDFs with download links\nDOC and XLS files with malicious macros\nArchive files (ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISOs) containing EXE payloads\n\nThe PDF and DOC/XLS campaigns primarily impacted the United States and the Archive\ncampaigns largely impacted the Unites States and South Korea.\n\n## FormBook Overview\n\nFormBook is a data stealer and form grabber that has been advertised in various hacking\nforums since early 2016. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the online advertisement for the\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFormBook advertisement\n\n\nFigure 1: FormBook advertisement\n\n\n-----\n\nFormBook underground pricing\n\n\nFigure 2: FormBook underground pricing\nThe malware injects itself into various processes and installs function hooks to log\nkeystrokes, steal clipboard contents, and extract data from HTTP sessions. The malware can\nalso execute commands from a command and control (C2) server. The commands include\ninstructing the malware to download and execute files, start processes, shutdown and reboot\nthe system, and steal cookies and local passwords.\n\nOne of the malware's most interesting features is that it reads Windows’ ntdll.dll module from\ndisk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and\nAPI monitoring mechanisms ineffective. The malware author calls this technique \"Lagos\nIsland method\" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name).\n\nIt also features a persistence method that randomly changes the path, filename, file\nextension, and the registry key used for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware author does not sell the builder, but only sells the panel, and then generates\nthe executable files as a service.\n\n**Capabilities**\n\nFormBook is a data stealer, but not a full-fledged banker (banking malware). It does not\ncurrently have any extensions or plug-ins. Its capabilities include:\n\nKey logging\nClipboard monitoring\nGrabbing HTTP/HTTPS/SPDY/HTTP2 forms and network requests\nGrabbing passwords from browsers and email clients\nScreenshots\n\nFormBook can receive the following remote commands from the C2 server:\n\nUpdate bot on host system\nDownload and execute file\nRemove bot from host system\nLaunch a command via ShellExecute\nClear browser cookies\nReboot system\nShutdown system\nCollect passwords and create a screenshot\nDownload and unpack ZIP archive\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nThe C2 domains typically leverage less widespread, newer generic top-level domains\n(gTLDs) such as .site, .website, .tech, .online, and .info.\n\nThe C2 domains used for this recently observed FormBook activity have been registered\nusing the WhoisGuard privacy protection service. The server infrastructure is hosted on\nBlazingFast.io, a Ukrainian hosting provider. Each server typically has multiple FormBook\npanel installation locations, which could be indicative of an affiliate model.\n\n## Behavior Details\n\n**File Characteristics**\n\nOur analysis in this blog post is based on the following representative sample:\n\n\nFilename MD5 Hash Size\n(bytes)\n\n\nCompile Time\n\n\n-----\n\nUnavailable CE84640C3228925CC4815116DDE968CB 747,652 2012-06-09\n13:19:49Z\n\nTable 1: FormBook sample details\n\n**Packer**\n\nThe malware is a self-extracting RAR file that starts an AutoIt loader. The AutoIt loader\ncompiles and runs an AutoIt script. The script decrypts the FormBook payload file, loads it\ninto memory, and then executes it.\n\n**Installation**\n\nThe FormBook malware copies itself to a new location. The malware first chooses one of the\nfollowing strings to use as a prefix for its installed filename:\n\nms, win, gdi, mfc, vga, igfx, user, help, config, update, regsvc, chkdsk, systray, audiodg,\ncertmgr, autochk, taskhost, colorcpl, services, IconCache, ThumbCache, Cookies\n\nIt then generates two to five random characters and appends those to the chosen string\nabove\n\nfollowed by one of the following file extensions:\n\n.exe, .com, .scr, .pif, .cmd, .bat\n\nIf the malware is running with elevated privileges, it copies itself to one of the following\ndirectories:\n\n%ProgramFiles%\n%CommonProgramFiles%\n\nIf running with normal privileges, it copies itself to one of the following directories:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\n%APPDATA%\n%TEMP%\n\n**Persistence**\n\nThe malware uses the same aforementioned string list with a random string to create a\nprefix, appends one to five random characters, and uses this value as the registry value\nname.\n\nThe malware configures persistence to one of the following two locations depending on its\nprivileges:\n\n\n-----\n\n(HKCU|HKLM)\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n(HKCU|HKLM)\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\n\n**Startup**\n\nThe malware creates two 16-byte mutexes. The first mutex is the client identifier (e.g., 83503835SZBFHHZ). The second mutex value is derived from the C2 information and the\nusername (e.g., LL9PSC56RW7Bx3A5).\n\nThe malware then iterates over a process listing and calculates a checksum value of process\nnames (rather than checking the name itself) to figure out which process to inject. The\nmalware may inject itself into browser processes and explorer.exe. Depending on the target\nprocess, the malware installs different function hooks (see the Function Hooks section for\nfurther detail).\n\n**Anti-Analysis**\n\nThe malware uses several techniques to complicate malware analysis:\n\nTiming checks using the RDTSC instruction\nCalls NtQueryInformationProcess with InfoClass=7 (ProcessDebugPort)\nSample path and filename checks (sample filename must be shorter than 32\ncharacters)\nHash-based module blacklist\nHash-based process blacklist\nHash-based username blacklist\nBefore communicating, it checks whether the C2 server is present in the hosts file\n\nThe results of these tests are then placed into a 16-byte array, and a SHA1 hash is\ncalculated on the array, which will be later used as the decryption key for subsequent strings\n(e.g. DLL names to load). Failed checks may go unnoticed until the sample tries to load the\nsupporting DLLs(kernel32.dll and advapi32.dll).\n\nThe correct 16-byte array holding the result of the checks is:\n\n00 00 01 01 00 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 00\n\nHaving a SHA1 value of:\n\n5b85aaa14f74e7e8adb93b040b0914a10b8b19b2\n\nAfter completing all anti-analysis checks, the sample manually maps ntdll.dll from disk into\nmemory and uses its exported functions directly in the code. All API functions will have a\nsmall stub function in the code that looks up the address of the API in the mapped ntdll.dll\nusing the CRC32 checksum of the API name, and sets up the parameters on the stack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis will be followed by a direct register call to the mapped ntdll.dll module. This makes\nregular debugger breakpoints on APIs inoperable, as execution will never go through the\nsystem mapped ntdll.dll.\n\n**Process Injection**\n\nThe sample loops through all the running processes to find explorer.exe by the CRC32\nchecksum of its process name. It then injects into explorer.exe using the following API calls\n(avoiding more commonly identifiable techniques such as WriteProcessMemory and\nCreateRemoteThread):\n\nNtMapViewOfSection\nNtSetContextThread\nNtQueueUserAPC\n\nThe injected code in the hijacked instance of explorer.exe randomly selects and launches (as\na suspended process) a built-in Windows executable from the following list:\n\nsvchost.exe, msiexec.exe, wuauclt.exe, lsass.exe, wlanext.exe, msg.exe, lsm.exe,\ndwm.exe, help.exe, chkdsk.exe, cmmon32.exe, nbtstat.exe, spoolsv.exe, rdpclip.exe,\ncontrol.exe, taskhost.exe, rundll32.exe, systray.exe, audiodg.exe, wininit.exe,\nservices.exe, autochk.exe, autoconv.exe, autofmt.exe, cmstp.exe, colorcpl.exe,\ncscript.exe, explorer.exe, WWAHost.exe, ipconfig.exe, msdt.exe, mstsc.exe,\nNAPSTAT.EXE, netsh.exe, NETSTAT.EXE, raserver.exe, wscript.exe, wuapp.exe,\ncmd.exe\n\nThe original process reads the randomly selected executable from the memory of\nexplorer.exe and migrates into this new process via NtMapViewOfSection,\nNtSetContextThread, and NtQueueUserAPC.\n\nThe new process then deletes the original sample and sets up persistence (see\nthe Persistence section for more detail). It then goes into a loop that constantly enumerates\nrunning processes and looks for targets based on the CRC32 checksum of the process\nname.\n\nTargeted process names include, but are not limited to:\n\niexplore.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe, MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe, explorer.exe, opera.exe,\nsafari.exe, torch.exe, maxthon.exe, seamonkey.exe, avant.exe, deepnet.exe, kmeleon.exe, citrio.exe, coolnovo.exe, coowon.exe, cyberfox.exe,\ndooble.exe, vivaldi.exe, iridium.exe, epic.exe, midori.exe, mustang.exe, orbitum.exe,\npalemoon.exe, qupzilla.exe, sleipnir.exe, superbird.exe, outlook.exe, thunderbird.exe,\ntotalcmd.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter injecting into any of the target processes, it sets up user-mode API hooks based on the\nprocess.\n\nThe malware installs different function hooks depending on the process. The primary\npurpose of these function hooks is to log keystrokes, steal clipboard data, and extract\nauthentication information from browser HTTP sessions. The malware stores data in local\npassword log files. The directory name is derived from the C2 information and the username\n(the same as the second mutex created above: LL9PSC56RW7Bx3A5).\n\nHowever, only eight bytes from this value are used as the directory name (e.g., LL9PSC56).\nNext, the first three characters from the derived directory name are used as a prefix for the\nlog file followed by the string log. Following this prefix are names corresponding to the type\nof log file. For example, for Internet Explorer passwords, the following log file would be\ncreated:\n\n%APPDATA%\\LL9PSC56\\LL9logri.ini.\n\nThe following are the password log filenames without the prefix:\n\n(no name): Keylog data\nrg.ini: Chrome passwords\nrf.ini: Firefox passwords\nrt.ini: Thunderbird passwords\nri.ini: Internet Explorer passwords\nrc.ini: Outlook passwords\nrv.ini: Windows Vault passwords\nro.ini: Opera passwords\n\nOne additional file that does not use the .INI file extension is a screenshot file:\n\nim.jpeg\n\n**Function Hooks**\n\nKeylog/clipboard monitoring:\n\nGetMessageA\nGetMessageW\nPeekMessageA\nPeekMessageW\nSendMessageA\nSendMessageW\n\nBrowser hooks:\n\nPR_Write\n\n\n-----\n\nHttpSendRequestA\nHttpSendRequestW\nInternetQueryOptionW\nEncryptMessage\nWSASend\n\nThe browser hooks look for certain strings in the content of HTTP requests and, if a match is\nfound, information about the request is extracted. The targeted strings are:\n\npass\ntoken\nemail\nlogin\nsignin\naccount\npersistent\n\n## Network Communications\n\nThe malware communicates with the following C2 server using HTTP requests:\n\nwww[.]clicks-track[.]info/list/hx28/\n\n**Beacon**\n\nAs seen in Figure 3, FormBook sends a beacon request (controlled by a timer/counter) using\nHTTP GET with an \"id\" parameter in the URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nFormBook beacon\n\n\nFigure 3: FormBook beacon\nThe decoded \"id\" parameter is as follows:\n\nFBNG:134C0ABB 2.9:Windows 7 Professional x86:VXNlcg==\n\nWhere:\n\n\"FBNG\" - magic bytes\n\"134C0ABB\" - the CRC32 checksum of the user's SID\n\"2.9\" - the bot version\n\"Windows 7 Professional\" – operating system version\n\"x86\" – operating system architecture\n\"VXNlcg==\" - the Base64 encoded username (i.e., \"User\" in this case)\n\n**Communication Encryption**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware sends HTTP requests using hard-coded HTTP header values. The HTTP\nheaders shown in Figure 4 are hardcoded.\n\n\nHard-coded HTTP header values\n\n\nFigure 4: Hard-coded HTTP header values\nMessages to the C2 server are sent RC4 encrypted and Base64 encoded. The malware\nuses a slightly altered Base64 alphabet, and also uses the character \".\" instead of \"=\" as the\npad character:\n\nStandard Alphabet:\n\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\nModified Alphabet:\n\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RC4 key is created using an implementation of the SHA1 hashing algorithm with the C2\nURL. The standard SHA1 algorithm reverses the DWORD endianness at the end of the\nalgorithm. This implementation does not, which results in a reverse endian DWORDs. For\nexample, the SHA1 hash for the aforementioned URL\nis \"9b198a3cfa6ff461cc40b754c90740a81559b9ae,\" but when reordering the DWORDs, it\nproduces the correct RC4 key: 3c8a199b61f46ffa54b740cca84007c9aeb95915. The first\nDWORD \"9b198a3c\" becomes \"3c8a199b.\"\n\nFigure 5 shows an example HTTP POST request.\n\n\nExample HTTP POST request\n\n\nFigure 5: Example HTTP POST request\nIn this example, the decoded result is:\n\nClipboard\\r\\n\\r\\nBlank Page - Windows Internet Explorer\\r\\n\\r\\ncEXN{3wutV,\n\n\n-----\n\n**Accepted Commands**\n\nWhen a command is sent by the C2 server, the HTTP response body has the format shown\nin Figure 6.\n\n\nFormBook C2 server response with command\n\n\nFigure 6: FormBook C2 server response with command\nThe data begins with the magic bytes \"FBNG,\" and a one-byte command code from hex\nbytes 31 to 39 (i.e., from \"1\" to \"9\") in clear text. This is then followed by the RC4-encoded\ncommand data (where the RC4 key is the same as the one used for the request). In the\ndecrypted data, another occurrence of the magic FBNG bytes indicates the end of the\ncommand data.\n\nThe malware accepts the commands shown in Table 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand Parameters (after\ndecryption)\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n'1' (0x31) <pe_file_data>FBNG Download and execute file from %TEMP%\ndirectory\n\n'2' (0x32) <pe_file_data>FBNG Update bot on host machine\n\n'3' (0x33) FBNG Remove bot from host machine\n\n'4' (0x34) <command_string>FBNG Launch a command via ShellExecute\n\n'5' (0x35) FBNG Clear browser cookies\n\n'6' (0x36) FBNG Reboot operating system\n\n'7' (0x37) FBNG Shutdown operating system\n\n'8' (0x38) FBNG Collect email/browser passwords and create a\nscreenshot\n\n'9' (0x39) <zip_file_data>FBNG Download and unpack ZIP archive into %TEMP%\ndirectory\n\nTable 2: FormBook accepted commands\n\n## Distribution Campaigns\n\nFireEye researchers observed FormBook distributed via email campaigns using a variety of\ndifferent attachments:\n\nPDFs with links to the \"tny.im\" URL-shortening service, which then redirected to a\nstaging server that contained FormBook executable payloads\nDOC and XLS attachments that contained malicious macros that, when enabled,\ninitiated the download of FormBook payloads\nZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISO attachments that contained FormBook executable files\n\n**The PDF Campaigns**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PDF campaigns leveraged FedEx and DHL shipping/package delivery themes (Figure 7\nand Figure 8), as well as a document-sharing theme. The PDFs distributed did not contain\nmalicious code, just a link to download the FormBook payload.\n\nThe staging servers (shown in Table 3) appeared to be compromised websites.\n\n\nExample PDF campaign email lure with attachment\n\n\nFigure 7: Example PDF campaign\n\n\nemail lure with attachment\n\n\n-----\n\nExample PDF campaign attachment\n\n\nFigure 8: Example PDF campaign attachment\n\nSample Subject Lines Shorted\nURLs\n\n\nStaging Servers\n\n\n-----\n\n<Recipient’s_Name> - You have a parcel\nawaiting pick up\n\n<Recipient’s_Name> – I shared a file with you\n\n\ntny[.]im/9TK\n\ntny[.]im/9Uw\n\ntny[.]im/9G1\n\ntny[.]im/9Q6\n\ntny[.]im/9H1\n\ntny[.]im/9R7\n\ntny[.]im/9Tc\n\ntny[.]im/9RM\n\ntny[.]im/9G0\n\ntny[.]im/9Oq\n\ntny[.]im/9Oh\n\n\nmaxsutton[.]co[.]uk\n\nsolderie[.]dream3w[.]com\n\nlifekeeper[.]com[.]au\n\nbrinematriscript[.]com\n\njaimagroup[.]com\n\n\nTable 3: Observed email subjects and download URLs for PDF campaign\n\nBased on data from the tny.im-shortened links, there were a total of 716 hits across 36\ncountries. As seen in Figure 9, most of the malicious activity from the PDF campaign\nimpacted the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nGeolocation statistics from tny.im URL shortener\n\n\nFigure 9: Geolocation statistics from tny.im URL shortener\n\n**The DOC/XLS Campaigns**\n\nThe email campaigns distributing DOC and XLS files relied on the use of malicious macros\nto download the executable payload. When the macros are enabled, the download URL\nretrieves an executable file with a PDF extension. Table 4 shows observed email subjects\nand download URLs used in these campaigns.\n\nSample Subject Lines Staging Server URL Paths\n\n\n-----\n\n61_Invoice_6654\n\nACS PO 1528\n\nNEW ORDER - PO-074\n\nNEW ORDER - PO#074\n\nREQUEST FOR QUOTATION/CONTRACT\nOVERHAUL MV OCEAN MANTA//SUPPLY P3PROPELLER\n\nURGENT PURCHASE ORDER 1800027695\n\n\nsdvernoms[.]ml /oc/runpie.pdf\n\n/sem/essen.pdf\n\n/drops/microcore.pdf\n\n/damp/10939453.pdf\n\n/sem/essentials.exe\n\n/oc/runpie.pdf\n\n/sem/ampama.pdf\n\n/js/21509671Packed.pdf\n\n/sem/essen.pdf\n\n\nTable 4: Observed email subjects and download URLs for the DOC/XLS campaign\n\nFireEye detection technologies observed this malicious activity between Aug. 11 and Aug.\n22, 2017 (Figure 10). Much of the activity was observed in the United States (Figure 11), and\nthe most targeted industry vertical was Aerospace/Defense Contractors (Figure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\nDOC/XLS campaign malicious activity by date\n\n\nFigure 10: DOC/XLS campaign malicious activity by date\n\n\n-----\n\nTop 10 countries affected by the DOC/XLS campaign\n\n\nFigure 11: Top 10 countries affected by the DOC/XLS campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nTop 10 industry verticals affected by the DOC/XLS campaign\n\n\nFigure 12: Top 10 industry verticals affected by the DOC/XLS campaign\n\n**The Archive Campaign**\n\nThe Archive campaign delivered a variety of archive formats, including ZIP, RAR, ACE, and\nISO, and accounted for the highest distribution volume. It leveraged a myriad of subject lines\nthat were characteristically business related and often regarding payment or purchase\norders:\n\nSample Subject Lines\n\n\n-----\n\nHSBC MT103 PAYMENT CONFIRMATION Our Ref: HBCCTKF8003445VTC\n\nMT103 PAYMENT CONFIRMATION Our Ref: BCCMKE806868TSC Counterparty:.\n\nFwd: INQUIRY RFQ-18 H0018\n\nFw: Remittance Confirmation\n\nNEW ORDER FROM COBRA INDUSTRIAL MACHINES IN SHARJAH\n\nPO.

Much of the activity was observed in South Korea and the United\nStates (Figure 14), with the Manufacturing industry vertical being the most impacted (Figure\n15).\n\n\n-----\n\nArchive campaign malicious activity by date\n\n\nFigure 13: Archive campaign malicious activity by date\n\n\n-----\n\nTop 10 countries affected by the Archive campaign\n\n\nFigure 14: Top 10 countries affected by the Archive campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nTop 10 industry verticals affected by the Archive campaign\n\n\nFigure 15: Top 10 industry verticals affected by the Archive campaign\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile FormBook is not unique in either its functionality or distribution mechanisms, its\nrelative ease of use, affordable pricing structure, and open availability make FormBook an\nattractive option for cyber criminals of varying skill levels. In the last few weeks, FormBook\nwas seen downloading other malware families such as NanoCore. The credentials and other\ndata harvested by successful FormBook infections could be used for additional cyber crime\nactivities including, but not limited to: identity theft, continued phishing operations, bank fraud\nand extortion.\n\n\n-----",
