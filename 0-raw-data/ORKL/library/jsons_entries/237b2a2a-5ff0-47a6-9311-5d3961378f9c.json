To show they mean business, the\nransomware gang has deposited $320 thousand on a hacker forum.\n\nDarkSide is run as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) where developers are in charge of\nprogramming the ransomware software and payment site, and affiliates are recruited to\nhack businesses and encrypt their devices.\n\nAs part of this arrangement, the DarkSide ransomware developers receive a 10-25% cut,\nand an affiliate gets 75-90% of any ransom payments they generate.\n\nAs DarkSide is a private operation, hackers who want to distribute their ransomware\nmust first apply for access.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Distributed storage system to leak data\n\n[Yesterday, cybersecurity intelligence firm Kela shared a new topic posted by the DarkSide](https://ke-la.com/)\nRansomware operators on a Russian-speaking hacker forum with BleepingComputer.\n\nIn this topic, DarkSide has stated that they are working on a distributed storage system to\nstore and leak victims' stolen data.\n\nSince late 2019, ransomware operations have been actively performing a double-extortion\nstrategy of stealing unencrypted data and then encrypting the victim's computers. The\n[encrypted files and the threat to publicly release data on ransomware data leak sites are](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\nused to extort victims into paying the ransom.\n\nTo disrupt these extortion demands, law enforcement and cybersecurity firms actively try to\ntake down these data leak sites.\n\nTo prevent this, DarkSide states that they plan to create a distributed \"sustainable storage\nsystem\" in Iran to host the victim's stolen data for six months.\n\n\"Some targets think that if a lot of data has been downloaded from them, then after their\npublication, hackers and other people will download it for a long time through the TOR. We\nthink so too, so we will change it.\"\n\n\"We are already working on a sustainable storage system for your data. All your data will be\nreplicated between multiple servers, blocking one server won't delete data.\"\n\n\"Those companies that have already been published will be uploaded there, their data will\nbe guaranteed to be stored for 6 months. So you can download their data much faster.\"\n\n\"We will specifically use servers in Iran or unrecognized republics so that you cannot block\nthem, and an automatic system will determine the availability and give you a suitable\ndownload link,\" the DarkSide operators stated.\n\nThey state that all the stolen data will be replicated between the various servers, so if one\nserver is taken down, the data could still be accessed from the others.\n\n## DarkSide deposits $320 thousand on a hacker forum\n\nAs part of this same forum topic, the DarkSide operation announced that they were looking\nfor new Russian affiliates to join their program, who they claim to earn an average of $400k\nper victim.\n\nAs part of this recruitment drive, affiliates must pass an interview and answer any questions\nthe developers have about their level of experience.\n\n\n-----\n\nPass an interview, show your work and payments, answer the necessary questions. DarkSide developers.\n\nUnlike other ransomware operations, such as Ryuk, Egregor, and others, DarkSide states\nthat do not allow attacks on:\n\nMedicine (hospitals, hospices).\nEducation (schools, universities).\nNon-profit organizations.\nGovernment sector.\n\nIt is too soon to tell if DarkSide will keep its promises about not targeting\nthese organizations.\n\nIn addition to recruiting affiliates, DarkSide states that they are willing to spend 400K to\nhackers with access to large companies in the USA that can be encrypted.\n\nTo back up their claims, the DarkSide gang deposited 20 bitcoins on the forum, which is\nworth approximately $320 thousand at today's values.\n\n**Deposit of 20 bitcoins**\nAs you can see below, the public-facing representative of DarkSide, known as 'darksupp',\nnow has 20 bitcoins deposited in their account.\n\n\n-----\n\n**20 bitcoin deposit**\n\nThese deposited bitcoins can then be transferred to other members to purchase software,\nservices, or information.\n\nThis show of wealth is similar to REvil's recruitment drive in September when they\n[deposited $1 million in bitcoins to the same forum.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-deposits-1-million-in-hacker-recruitment-drive/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Affiliates](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/affiliates/)\n[Bitcoin](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bitcoin/)\n[DarkSide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/darkside/)\n[Hacker Forum](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hacker-forum/)\n[RaaS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/raas/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ransomware-as-a-Service](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware-as-a-service/)\n\nL Ab\n\n\n-----\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
