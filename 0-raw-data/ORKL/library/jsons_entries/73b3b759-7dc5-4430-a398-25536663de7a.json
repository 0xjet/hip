The group behind this operation\nhas been launching targeted and possibly politically-motivated attacks to spy on\nindividuals.\n\nThis paper presents ESET’s findings about Operation Groundbait based on our research into the Prikormka malware family. This includes detailed technical analysis\nof the Prikormka malware family and its spreading mechanisms, and a description\nof the most noteworthy attack campaigns.\n\nKey findings:\n\n   - The country where the malware has been seen most is Ukraine.\nIt has been active since at least 2008.\n\n   - The primary targets of Operation Groundbait are anti-government\nseparatists in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's\nRepublics in Eastern Ukraine.\n\n   - There have also been a large number of other targets, including\nUkrainian government officials, Ukrainian politicians, Ukrainian\njournalists and others.\n\n   - The attackers most likely operate from within Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The discovery\n\nIn the third quarter of 2015 ESET identified a previously unknown modular mal[ware family, Prikormka. Further research revealed that this malware has been](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Prikormka/detail)\nactive since at least 2008 and the country where the malware has been seen most\nis Ukraine. The reason why it had gone unnoticed for so long is the relatively low\ninfection ratio before 2015. The number of infections surged significantly in 2015.\n\n\nOne of the first examples of this malware that we analyzed in our laboratory had\nthe name prikormka.exe. The Russian and Ukrainian word prikormka (Прикормка)\nmeans groundbait, a type of fish bait that is cast into the water to attract fish. We\nused this codename during our research and afterward we decided to keep it, so the\nmalware has the names Win32/Prikormka and Win64/Prikormka respectively.\n\nThe low detection ratio and ability to stay undetected for years is a common characteristic of targeted attacks (APTs). The investigation of campaigns and Prikormka activity has increased our confidence that this malware is used in targeted\nattacks.\n\nTargeted attacks are generally carried out for various purposes, including reconnaissance, intellectual property theft, sabotage, and espionage. After analyzing\ntactics, techniques and procedures employed by this particular malware group,\nwe came to the conclusion that individuals are targeted rather than companies.\nEven when the Prikormka malware was detected in a corporate environment, we\nnever saw any lateral movement — a technique used by advanced adversaries in\ncyber-attacks.\n\nWe suspect that this group operates in Ukraine, where most of the victims are\nlocated. For that reason and due to the nature of these attacks, we classified them\nas cyber-surveillance operations.\n\n\n178\n\n\n44\n\n\n39\n\n\n1\n\n\n12 13\n7\n0 2\n\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nFigure 1. The number of unique samples retrieved by ESET, by years, based on timestamps.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of unique Prikormka samples compiled in each year\nsince 2008, according to the PE header timestamps. While timestamps by themselves usually are not a reliable indicator, in this case, their accuracy was confirmed by ESET’s LiveGrid® telemetry.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The campaigns\n\nIn this section, we will show the most noteworthy and prominent campaigns and\nthe decoy documents with which they are associated.\n\nLet’s examine detection statistics by country based on our ESET LiveGrid® statistics:\n\n2015 2016\n\nBelgium 2% Tajikistan 1%\n\nRussia 13% Russia 12%\n\nUkraine 86% Ukraine 87%\n\nFigure 2. Detection statistics for Prikormka malware according to ESET LiveGrid®.\n\nAccording to our telemetry, Ukraine is the country with the majority of detections\nof this malware. In addition, our research revealed that the attackers behind this\nmalware demonstrate native fluency of the Ukrainian and Russian languages and\ncomprehensive understanding of the current political situation in Ukraine.\n\nTo answer the question of what kind of victims were attacked in the above-listed\ncountries, we have analyzed the decoy documents used to target them.\n\n\nThe main infection vector that we identified during our research consists of spearphishing emails with attached malicious executables or with a download link to\na malicious file hosted on a remote server. When the user clicks on a malicious\nattachment that is masquerading as a document, the Prikormka dropper displays a\ndecoy document in order to trick victims and distract their attention, since victims\nnormally expect to see a document open when they click on an attachment. This\ntechnique works against less tech-savvy computer users; infection success, however, depends on the quality of spearphishing emails. The attacker has a greater\nchance to infect the computer when spearphishing letters and decoy documents\nare relevant to the victim — in other words, when the victim would not be surprised to receive such a message from someone. Thus, analyzing such decoy documents can reveal information about the intended targets of these cyber-attacks.\n\nSecondly, there is another artefact embedded in each sample of Prikormka malware, that we call the Campaign ID. These Campaign IDs are unique text strings\nused to identify specific infections or attempts at infection by the Prikormka\nmalware operators. The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes\nreveal information about the intended targets.\n\nSo far we have identified more than 80 different Campaign IDs and even more\ndecoy documents linked to these IDs. It was observed that usually one Campaign\nID is used against one target, which can be an individual, some entity, or group\nof people. This means that one particular ID might be discovered on multiple\ncomputers.\n\nA more comprehensive listing of representative campaigns, along with their compilation timestamps and unique Campaign IDs is in Appendix A.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in some cases it is hard to identify intended victims,\nespecially when the Prikormka malware infections were discovered at the stage\nwhen the malware was already installed and active. However, we have become\naware of some active Prikormka infections on computer networks belonging to\nhigh-value targets, including the Ukrainian government. Other noteworthy targets are mentioned in the following descriptions of Groundbait campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Campaigns against separatists\n\nAmong Prikormka's primary targets are separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Since 2014\nthis region has been involved in an armed military conflict.\n\nIn April 2014 a group of people unilaterally proclaimed independence in two\nregions of Eastern Ukraine: Donetsk and Luhansk. In response, the Ukrainian\ngovernment classified these two entities as terrorist organizations and, therefore,\n[the territory of these regions was declared an Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) zone.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO_zone)\nIn May 11[th ]2014, the authorities of these self-proclaimed republics held\n[a referendum seeking to legitimize the establishment of the republics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass_status_referendums,_2014)\n\nA significant number of decoy documents that were used in Prikormka attacks exploited various topics related to the self-proclaimed states of the Donetsk People’s\n\nRepublic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Moreover, a number of\ndecoy documents contain private data including internal statistics and documents\napparently used in the internal workflow of these self-proclaimed states. This\nfact leads us to believe that operators are intentionally targeting people located\nin these two regions. These assumptions are confirmed by our ESET LiveGrid®\ntelemetry: the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are at the two most infected regions\nin Ukraine by the Prikormka malware.\n\nThe attackers use social engineering tricks to convince a victim to open a malicious attachment. These tricks include giving provocative or attractive names to\nthe email attachments. Here are few examples of such filenames:\n\n   - Нацгвардейцы со шприцами сделали из донецкого\nмальчика мишень для ракет.exe (From the Russian: National\nGuard of Ukraine aimed rockets at boy from Donetsk). Compilation\ntimestamp: November 5th 2014\n\n   - Последнее обращение командира бригады 'Призрак'\nМозгового Алексея Борисовича к солдатам и офицерам ДНР\n[и ЛНР.scr (From the Russian: Leader of the Prizrak Brigade Aleksey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksey_Mozgovoy)\n_[Borisovich Mozgovoy's last appeal to soldiers and officer of Donetsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksey_Mozgovoy)_\n\n\nPeople’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic). Compilation\ntimestamp: May 24[th] 2015\n\n   - Места дислокации ВСУ в зоне проведения АТО.scr\n(From the Russian: Dislocation of the armed forces of Ukraine\nin ATO zone). Compilation timestamp: December 15[th ]2015\n\nHere are examples of decoy documents that were used in attacks against\nseparatists in Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\n   - The first example is an executable with the filename СПРАВОЧНИК\nпо МИНИСТЕРСТВАМ обновленный.exe (From the Russian:\nMinistries directory – updated) that drops a decoy document with a\nlist of Ministries of the self-proclaimed republic. The Campaign ID for\nthis executable is D _ xxx. (Figure 3)\n\n   - Here is another example of a decoy document, which was\ndropped by an executable named материалы к зачету по\nзаконодательству.exe (From the Russian: Materials for the law\nexam). This executable drops several documents including the LPR\ntemporary constitution and other legal and political documents.\nThe Campaign ID is L _ ment; the word “ment” is Russian slang for a\npoliceman. Thus, the attackers demonstrate intimate knowledge of\nthe Russian language. (Figure 4)\n\n   - [Some of the decoy documents use the Minsk agreement topic. Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_II)\nis an example of one such document, which comes from a dropper\nwith the filename Схема демилитаризованной зоны в районе\nШиокино.exe (From the Russian: Scheme of the demilitarized zone\n[in the Shyrokyne (Shyrokyne written with a typo in Russian)). The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyrokyne)\nCampaign ID was Lminfin. (Figure 5)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Decoy document, with a list of Ministries of DPR. (Here and in further images, potentially sensitive data have been redacted by ESET.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Decoy document containing the law, which describes the rules Figure 5. Decoy document, which exploits the Minsk Agreement topic.\nfor special crime investigation activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Another decoy document even contains a map of the buffer zone\nestablished by the Minsk Protocol. Here is an example, which came\nfrom a dropper with the filename Отвод с 4 участками по\nсост на 14.08.exe (From the Russian: Pullout [of heavy weapons]\non 14.08). The Campaign ID was BUR. (Figure 6)\n\nImportant note: Most of the Prikormka binaries that seem to have been intended\nfor use against separatists have Campaign IDs starting with D or L characters. It's\npossible that this means Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, respectively. Also, we observed an executable named Заявление Эдуарда\nБасаргина 13 октября 2015 года в 15 часов.exe (From the Russian: Eduard Basargin's statement on 13[th] October 2015 at 3pm), which uses the Campaign\nID RF _ lgm. Since we have identified detections in Russia, the RF prefix could\nmean Russian Federation.\n\n\nFigure 6. Decoy document with a map of the buffer zone.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Campaign against Ukrainian nationalist political party\n\nAll previously mentioned decoy documents were extracted from executables that had\n\n[Russian filenames. Ukrainian is the official state language; however, people in Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Ukraine)\n\nUkraine tend to use Russian, as opposed to Western regions, which use Ukrainian.\n\nSome of the Prikormka binaries had names in Ukrainian. For example, we have seen\nthe filename План ДНР на 21 липня, щодо відводу військ.exe (From the\nUkrainian: The DPR plan for withdrawal of troops on 21[st] July). Names of attachments in the Ukrainian language might suggest that the receiver of such malicious\nletters prefer to speak Ukrainian over Russian. The fact that Prikormka malware\nwas detected in Western regions of Ukraine strengthens this assumption. The\nCampaign ID for this particular executable was Psek, which inclines us to believe\nwith a high degree of confidence that members of Ukrainian nationalist party\n_[Right Sector (Ukrainian: Pravyi Sektor) were targeted with Prikormka malware.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector)_\n\n\nFigure 7. Decoy document possibly used against members of a Ukrainian nationalist party.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Other campaigns\n\nSeparatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and the other targeted high profile victims\nweren’t the only targets of Operation Groundbait. We have observed some other\ncampaigns with interesting decoy documents, but we can't identify the intended\nvictims solely on the basis of those documents.\n\nHere is an example of a decoy document which was possibly used against a religious institute. The decoy document comes from dropper with filename Новое\nслово жизни.exe (From the Russian: New word of life). The Campaign ID was\n[medium. This choice of Campaign ID may refer to mediumship and spiritualism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship)\n\nFigure 8. Decoy document possibly used against religious organizations.\n\n\nAnother campaign was discovered in March 2016. This time, the name of the\nmalicious file was in Hungarian: Önéletrajz fizikai munka 2.pdf.scr, which\ntranslates to English as “CV physical work”. The decoy document dropped by this\nfile was a person's CV (curriculum vitae or resume), written in Hungarian. This\nmalicious .SCR file was sent compressed in single archive with two other documents: the CV of the same person in Ukrainian, and a certificate in Hungarian that\nconfirms that this person is able to perform the physical job. Based on this information it is hard to say who might be the intended target, but the fact its recipient possibly knows Hungarian and Ukrainian makes this campaign interesting.\nThe Campaign ID was F _ ego.\n\nFigure 9. The Hungarian document that was sent to the victim in a single archive\nwith the Prikormka malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is an example of a decoy document, dropped from a file with the name\nbitcoin.exe. The Campaign ID in this case was hmod.\n\nFigure 10. Decoy document that explains how to commit credit card fraud.\n\nThe Russian text in the decoy document explains, step by step, how to buy bitcoins\nusing stolen credit cards. The text abounds in slang words often used by Russian-speaking carders. ¹\n\nAnother example is a mysterious decoy document extracted from a malware\ndropper with the name prikormka.exe. The Campaign ID is 30K _ alfa.\n\nFigure 11. The mysterious decoy document dropped by the file named prikormka.exe.\n\nThis decoy document contains the pricelist of a Ukrainian shop that sells various\n1 Cybercriminals involved in stolen credit card crime. types of groundbait.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical details\n\nIn this section, we will describe technical aspects of Prikormka malware, including\nmalware architecture, C&C communication and detailed analysis of modules used.\n\n\nFigure 12. Simplified scheme of the Prikormka malware's architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The dropper\n\nThe dropper is the initial component of this malware, which is usually sent through\nemail as an attachment. Usually the dropper has a .SCR or .EXE file extension and\nis compressed into an archive. In order to trick the victim, the Prikormka dropper\ncan masquerade as various types of document or self-extracting archive.\n\nFigure 13. Icons used by Prikormka malware.\n\nWhen executed, the dropper infects the computer, but also displays one or more\ndecoy documents. To this end, the malware displays a WinRAR self-extraction\n(SFX) archive window. In some cases, the dropper creates a legitimate, non-malicious SFX executable on disk and then launches it. Interestingly, that SFX archive\nalways has a Russian localized graphic user interface, even in cases where the filename of the dropper is in Ukrainian. The dropper which has a Hungarian filename\ndoes not display this window at all.\n\nFigure 14. The Russian interface of SFX archive.\n\n\nThe SFX executable can contain one or more decoy documents. For example one\nSFX that was dropped by Prikormka contained 24 documents. Of course, the number and size of the decoy documents affects the size of the droppers. The biggest\ndropper we identified had a file size of 25MB.\n\nMost of the dropper executables have an embedded application manifest, which\nspecifies that the executable requires administrator privileges in order to run on\nthe system. If the user does not have administrator privileges, the system will\nprompt for credentials.\n\nFigure 15. The embedded application manifest embedded in Prikormka dropper.\n\nThe dropper needs administrator privileges because of the technique used by the\nmalware to become persistent on the infected system. Specifically, the malware\nuses so-called DLL load-order hijacking in order to start automatically on every\nsystem boot. The dropper saves one of the Prikormka DLL modules to the Windows-directory under the name ntshrui.dll. Because this DLL file is stored in\nthe Windows directory, it will be loaded on system boot by the explorer.exe\nprocess instead of the legitimate ntshrui.dll file, which is stored in the\nC:\\Windows\\System32 subdirectory. Thus, the Prikormka module hijacks the\norder of loading DLL files. This persistency method is not something new; it has\nbeen publicly examined multiple times by anti-malware research community.\n\nAnother interesting technique is used by the Prikormka malware, specifically by\ndroppers with .SCR file extensions. The .SCR file extension stands for screensaver\nand represents a standard Windows executable file. The main difference between\n```\n.EXE and .SCR is that a screensaver is executed with special command line argu\n```\n_[ments. Usually, cybercriminals just rename an executable with the .SCR extension](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/182383)_\nin order to bypass various security measures based on file extension. Prikormka's\nauthors implemented a check for such command line arguments, so when the\n\n\n-----\n\nbinary is executed as a standard executable (without the required arguments),\nit won’t infect the system. Thus, this simple check allowed the malware to bypass\nsome sandboxes used for automatic sample processing.\n\nIn the case where the infection starts from a .SCR file, the Trojan uses standard\nmethods for loading its DLL via rundll32.exe and for maintaining persistence, by\nsetting an entry with the name guidVGA or guidVSA in the registry Run key:\n\n[HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run]\n\nIn order to be loaded by the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of Windows Explorer the\nmalware has binaries for both platforms. Most modules are written in the C programming language and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\nThe dropper stores modules in its resources; some of these resources are encrypted with a simple XOR operation.\n\nFigure 16. Resources located inside the Prikormka dropper binary.\n\nThe dropper is responsible for creation of the rbcon.ini file, which used by the\nmalware to store Campaign ID and other values.\n\n\nEarlier versions of Prikormka used a different technique – Campaign IDs were\nembedded in the binary file of one of modules:\n\nFigure 17. The Campaign ID with value hmyr32 is embedded in the binary.\n\nThe Campaign ID value was hardcoded in the Prikormka binary at compilation\ntime; moreover, the ID in the 32-bit version of binaries ended with 2, while the\nCampaign ID in 64-bit version of binaries ended with 4.\n\nThis technique was probably efficient for a small number of victims, but it presumably created problems for the attackers once the number of victims grew. Perhaps\nrecompiling and repacking the core parts of a toolset for every new victim became\ntoo time consuming, so somewhere around mid-2015, the attackers changed\nthis scheme. Since June 2015 the Campaign ID is stored in a separate file named\nrbcon.ini, which the attackers call objectset. The malware authors have also\nincluded a new value called roboconid, which represents the Operator’s ID. Our\ninvestigation allowed us to confirm that this ID is a unique number for the malware operator, who performs cyber operations and is assigned to infect, spy on,\nand track a particular target.\n\nFigure 18. The rbcon.ini file which contains both Campaign ID and Operator ID.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the binaries of the dropper contain a PDB-path, which can reveal the\ndirectory structure used by attackers.\n\nFigure 19. Some of the PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka droppers.\n\nThe malware writers internally call this Trojan PZZ; we have other evidence that\nsupports this theory. The Prikormka family is a typical cyber-espionage Trojan\nwith a modular architecture. The functionality of the Trojan allows attackers to\nsteal sensitive data from the infected computer and upload them to command and\ncontrol (C&C) servers.\n\n### Prikormka modules\n\nThe Prikormka modules are stored on disk in the infected system in the form of\nDLL files. There are modules for various purposes, such as communication with\nC&C servers, auxiliary purposes (e.g. persistence), and exfiltration of different\ntypes of sensitive information from the infected computer. As mentioned before,\nPrikormka modules are compiled for both 32- and 64-bit Windows platforms.\n\nThere is a standard set of downloadable modules with pre-defined names, which\nwill be described in detail in the next sections. So as to be executed, the module\n(DLL file) should be stored under a specific filename on the disk and should have\none of the following export functions: Starting, KickInPoint, Cycle. However,\nattackers are able to push any custom module to a particular victim. Specifically,\nwe observed that custom modules are usually named mp.dll.\n\n\nIt should be noted that malware operators are responsible for deciding which\nmodules should be pushed to the infected computer.\n\nPrikormka might store modules with different functionality under similar names\nor, conversely, it can store modules with similar functionality under various names.\nSome versions of the malware store modules with a filename that contains only\nthe current date and time. For these reasons we refer to the plugins by code\nnames in the following text.\n\nModule code name Internal name of FIlename Purpose\nmodule\n\nPERSISTENCE samlib.dll samlib.dll, ntshrui.dll Used for persistence\n\nDOWNLOADER helpldr.dll helpldr.dll, _wshdmi.dll Downloads CORE module\n\nCORE hauthuid.dll hauthuid.dll, _svga.dll, Loads all other modules,\n_wshdmi.dll communicates with C&Cservers, uploads logs\n\nDOCS_STEALER iomus.dll iomus.dll Collects documents\n\nKEYLOGGER kl.dll, hlpuctf.dll hlpuctf.dll Logs keystrokes\n\nSCREENSHOTS scrsh.dll scrsh.dll Grabs screenshots of\ndesktop\n\nMICROPHONE snm.dll snm.dll Captures audio from\nmicrophone\n\nSKYPE swma.dll swma.dll Records Skype audio calls\n\nLOGS_ENCRYPTER atiml.dll atiml.dll Compresses and encrypts\ncollected logs\n\nGEOLOCATION geo.exe Inv.exe Geo-locates the infected\ncomputer\n\nOS_INFO InfoOS mp.dll Collects information about\ninfected computer\n\nPASSWORDS Brother mp.dll Collects saved passwords\nfor various installed\napplications\n\nFILE_TREE mpTREE mp.dll Collects file tree of fixed disk\nof infected computer\n\nTable 1. List of Prikormka modules identified during our research.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following list contains filenames of modules that were referenced within malware code, but we haven’t seen them during our research and thus were unable to\nassess their functionality:\n\n   - miron.dll\n\n   - meta.dll\n\n   - hmuid.dll\n\n   - sh.exe\n\n   - mupdate.exe\n\nIt is important to note that Prikormka components made in the \"old\" period (between 2008 and 2010) used a completely different naming scheme. Here are some\nexamples of such filenames:\n\n   - smdhostn.dll\n\n   - heading.dll\n\n   - lgs.dll\n\n   - la.dll\n\n   - `lh.exe`\n\n   - `lp.exe`\n\n   - `inl.exe`\n\n   - lid.dll\n\n\n### PERSISTENCE module\n\nAs described above, this module uses the DLL load-order hijacking technique to\nmaintain persistence in the system.\n\nWhen launched, this module creates the folder %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\\nMMC and copies the following files there from the %WINDIR% directory:\n\n   - hauthuid.dll (CORE)\n\n   - hlpuctf.dll (KEYLOGGER)\n\n   - atiml.dll (LOGS _ ENCRYPTER)\n\n   - iomus.dll (DOCS _ STEALER)\n\n   - swma.dll (SKYPE)\n\n   - helpldr.dll (DOWNLOADER)\n\n   - rbcon.ini\n\nThis component then loads and passes execution to the CORE module, or to the\nDOWNLOADER module if the CORE module is not found.\n\nIf the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\nullstate.cfg file exists, then the\ncomponent deletes all the filenames listed above from the MMC directory and\nquits, thus deactivating itself.\n\nSome of the binaries of the PERSISTENCE module contain a PDB-path, which reveals the directory structure used by the malware authors at compile time. Three\nof these paths contain a time stamp, possibly from when the project was created\nor modified. One such path contains the Russian string Раб. программы, which\ntranslates as “computer programs for work”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Some of the PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka's PERSISTENCE module.\n\n### DOWNLOADER module\n\nThe main purpose of this component is to download the CORE module and ex\necute it. The DOWNLOADER module makes an HTTP request to one of its C&C\nservers, receives data, decrypts the data, saves it under the name hauthuid.dll\nand then loads the DLL. The communication is encrypted with the Blowfish cipher\nand then base64 encoded.\n\nFigure 21. Traffic captured from the Prikormka malware's DOWNLOADER module.\n\n\nAlong with the Campaign ID and Operator ID, the module includes in the request\na date and time when infection occurred and whether the platform is 32-bit or\n64-bit Windows. Some of the binaries of the DOWNLOADER module contain PDBpaths, revealing that internally this module is called Loader or helpldr:\n\nFigure 22. PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka's DOWNLOADER module.\n\n### CORE module\n\nThe CORE module is responsible for communications with C&C servers and other\ntasks, including downloading additional modules, loading them, and uploading\nstolen data to the remote server.\n\nSince this malware (and specifically the CORE module) has existed for several\nyears, the details of implementation might vary, but the main concept of the CORE\nmodule has remained unchanged over the years. The concept of the Prikormka\nmalware is simple: the CORE module downloads additional components, which\nare used to harvest various types of data. When such a component is loaded, it\ngathers sensitive information and saves this information to some specific log file.\nThe log file might store collected data in plain-text or it may be encrypted. The\nCORE module checks periodically for such log files and when a log is available, it\nuploads it to the remote server. The CORE module won’t upload a log file if it is\nbigger than 500MB.\n\nIn order to store downloadable modules and collected log files, the CORE module\ncreates two directories:\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\SKC\\\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MMC folder is primarily used for additional downloadable malware components; the SKC folder is used for storing collected log files. In the subsequent text\nwe will use the term “log folder” to refer the SKC directory.\n\nThe downloadable modules are not able to upload collected data. In fact, only the\nCORE and DOWNLOADER modules communicate with C&C servers. The communication protocol of the CORE module is very similar to that of the DOWNLOADER\nmodule.\n\nFigure 23. Traffic captured from the Prikormka malware's CORE module.\n\nThe only difference between DOWNLOADER and CORE HTTP requests is the st\nparameter in the URL. This parameter indicates which of the downloadable modules are active and loaded by Prikormka. With the current implementation, there\nis room for 11 additional modules. The server responds with the content of the\nmodule that should be executed, or with a dummy answer.\n\nThe logs are uploaded during a POST request to a similar URL:\n\n   - hxxp:/server.ua/wd.php?sn=%DATE _ TIME _ OF _ INFECTION%\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that early versions of Prikormka stored C&C servers in\nplain-text; later, attackers used the base64 algorithm in order to hide the servers’\naddresses. Finally, the latest versions of the CORE modules use simple encryption: to decrypt it, the researcher should add the hexadecimal value 0x17 to each\nencrypted byte.\n\nFigure 24. Example of simple encryption used by Prikormka to hide C&C servers.\n\n### DOCS_STEALER module\n\nThis module is responsible for collecting documents from removable media or\nfixed drives, connected via a USB interface.\n\nThe module focuses on collecting files with document-type extensions: .DOC,\n.XLS, .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPT, .PPTX, .PPS, .PPSX, .PDF, .RTF, .TXT, .ODT. However,\nit does not collect all files, but only those which were modified in the last 7 days\n(or 14, or 30, depending on which version of the module).\n\nThe collected files then are compressed, encrypted with Blowfish, and stored\nunder the following scheme:\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\ioctl\\%DISK _ ID%\\\n%DATE% _ %TIME%.kf\n\n\n-----\n\n### KEYLOGGER module\n\nThis module is responsible for collecting keystrokes and the titles of foreground\nwindows. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the following\nnames:\n\n   - %DATE% _ %TIME% _ fix.lg\n\n   - lgfix\n\n   - `lpl`\n\n   - fplid\n\n   - fmmlg\n\nIf the log file is bigger than 10Mb, the module removes the log and starts anew.\nSome versions of the module encrypt the log file using Blowfish.\n\n### SCREENSHOTS module\n\nThis module is responsible for capturing screenshots of the victim’s desktop.\nBy default, the module captures a screenshot every 15 minutes. However, if the\nvictim opens a VoIP application Skype or Viber, then the period between screenshots is lowered dramatically to 5 seconds. The captured screenshot is saved in the\nJPEG format. The collected information is saved to the log folder under filenames\n%DATE% _ %TIME%.tgz.scrsh or %DATE% _ %TIME%.stgz.\n\n### MICROPHONE module\n\nThis module is responsible for recording sound from a microphone. The module\nrecords audio with 10 minutes duration. It stops recording on command, or when\nthere is no more free disk space available. The recorded audio is encoded with the\nLAME MP3 encoder. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the\nfilename %DATE% _ %TIME%.snm.\n\n\n### SKYPE module\n\nThis module is responsible for recording Skype audio chats. In order to record\n[Skype calls, the module uses a legitimate interface, called the Skype Desktop API.](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA214/what-is-the-desktop-api)\nWhen a third party application is about to use this API, the Skype messenger\ndisplays a warning, which asks the user to allow the access. To bypass this Skype\nsecurity feature, the Prikormka module creates a thread that attempts to find the\nwindow and click the “Allow access” button programmatically, without human\ninteraction.\n\nFigure 25. The warning displayed by Skype.\n\nThe strings and some code fragments in this Prikormka module suggest that the\nimplementation of this module was partly borrowed from the code published on\n[the website openrce.org in 2006.](https://www.openrce.org/repositories/users/Kostya/plugin_slave.c)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26. The string CREATE APPLICATION minishell suggests copied-and-pasted code.\n\nThe collected information is saved to the log folder using %DATE% _ %TIME%.skw\nand _ skype.log filenames.\n\n### LOGS_ENCRYPTER module\n\nThis module is responsible for log encryption. The module compresses data via the\nLZSS algorithm and encrypts the following log files with Blowfish:\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\inf\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\fsh\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\SKC\\*.scrsh\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\SKC\\*.snm\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\SKC\\*.skw\n\n   - Files listed in %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\ierdir.dat\n\nThe file ierdir.dat is created by the CORE module; it contains an encrypted list\nof files requested by attackers to upload from victim’s computer.\n\n\nAfter encryption, the original (but not the encrypted) files are deleted. Results of\nthe encryption are stored in the following files:\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\ipl\n\n   - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\MMC\\kpl\n\nThe encrypted content is additionally encoded with the base64 algorithm. Interestingly, before the content starts, the module puts an additional signature there:\n\nFigure 27. The “atKsoft” signature at the beginning of encrypted log files.\n\nWe have not found any legitimate application which can read such files or any\nother meaning of this mysterious “atKsoft” signature.\n\n\n-----\n\n### GEOLOCATION module\n\nThis module is responsible for geo locating the infected computer. Unlike other\nmodules, this module is written in the C# programming language. This module\ncollects information about currently available WiFi networks, including Service Set\nIdentifier (SSID) and MAC-address. Afterward, the module makes a request to the\nGoogle service, providing collected information as parameters; the Google service\nresponse contains the possible location based on the information supplied.\n\nFigure 28. Traffic captured from Prikormka malware's GEOLOCATION module.\n\n\nThe collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename\ngeo%DATE%.inf.\n\nThe binary of the GEOLOCATION module has a PDB-path; the structure of this\npath is similar to the PDB-path of the DOWNLOADER module:\n\nFigure 29. The PDB-path discovered inside the GEOLOCATION module.\n\n### OS_INFO module\n\nThis module is responsible for collecting information about the infected computer.\n\nThe following information is collected by this module:\n\n   - Battery info for Notebooks\n\n   - Windows OS version\n\n   - Computer name and User name\n\n   - IP Addresses and MAC Addresses\n\n   - Physical memory\n\n   - Available disk drives\n\n   - Available printers\n\n   - Desktop resolution\n\n   - Installed antivirus software\n\nThe module uses Windows API functions in order to collect this information.\nThe collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename\n%DATE% _ %TIME%.inf.\n\n\n-----\n\n### PASSWORDS module\n\nThis module is responsible for collecting passwords stored in applications installed\non the infected computer.\n\nThe module gathers the application version, logins and passwords stored in the\nfollowing applications:\n\n   - Google Chrome\n\n   - Opera Browser\n\n   - Yandex Browser\n\n   - Comodo Dragon Internet Browser\n\n   - Rambler Browser (Nichrome)\n\n   - Mozilla Firefox\n\n   - Mozilla Thunderbird\n\nFor some reason, this module does not collect passwords for Microsoft Internet\nExplorer and Microsoft Edge browsers. Because the Yandex Browser and the\nRambler Browser are popular mostly in Russian speaking countries, we think that\nit indicates that this module was designed for use against users located in such\ncountries.\n\nThe collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename\n%DATE% _ %TIME%.inf.\n\n\n### FILE_TREE module\n\nThis module is responsible for collecting information about the file system of the\ncomputer's fixed drives, including paths of files with specific file extensions, their\nsize and creation time. The actual content of the file is not collected by this module.\n\nThe attackers are interested in the following file extensions:\n\n   - Documents: TXT, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF\n\n   - Archives: ZIP, RAR\n\n   - Databases: DB, SQLITE\n\n   - The Bat! email client: TBB, CFG, CFN, TBN, TBB\n\n   - Microsoft Outlook: OST, PST\n\n   - Other: DAT, WAV, EXE\n\nSince The Bat! email client is popular in Russian-speaking countries, the fact that\nmalware is focused on file extensions associated with this email client is another\nindicator that the malware is created with the intention of using it against Russian-speaking users.\n\nIt should be noted that the list of all file extensions does not represent the list\nfound in any particular sample. This list contains all the possible file extensions\nthat we observed in different versions of the FILE_TREE module. The attackers\nmight build a custom version of this module for a specific victim. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename %DATE% _ %TIME% _ tree.\ninf. Some binaries of FILE_TREE modules have PDB-paths; one such path reveals\nthe username of the malware writer.\n\nFigure 30. A PDB-path discovered inside a FILE_TREE module.\n\n\n-----\n\n## C&C servers\n\nDuring our research into Operation Groundbait we have observed a number of\nC&C server domain names and IP addresses. Most of them are located in Ukraine\nand are hosted by Ukrainian hosting providers. Appendix B contains a more comprehensive listing.\n\nOne of the C&C servers, gils.ho[.]ua has been in operation since 2008, according to information from the hosting company. In order to hide their illegal activity,\nthe attackers created a bogus website. The website is dedicated to the capital of\nUkraine—Kiev.\n\nFigure 31. Bogus website created by attackers.\n\n\nDuring our investigation we obtained access to an Operation Groundbait C&C\nserver that was misconfigured and allowed a public directory listing.\n\nFigure 32. Operation Groundbait C&C server Figure 33. The internal directory structure\ndirectory listing. of a subfolder.\n\nAt one point, the root directory contained 33 subdirectories, with an individual\nfolder for each victim. This means that the server was used to control 33 Prikormka-infected computers. The name of each sub-folder contains an Operator ID,\na Campaign ID and the architecture of the infected device.\n\nEach folder contains two sub-folders with the following names: data and util.\nThe first folder contains encrypted exfiltrated data and the second folder has\nencrypted Prikormka modules.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the data and util folders, each victim-specific subfolder contained\ntwo plain-text log files: journal and log, revealing interesting findings about the\nmalware operators and their victims.\n\nThe log file contains the communication log between the server and the infected\ncomputer: specifically, the IP address of the infected computer, date and time, type\nof request (GET or POST), the size of request, and the status of Prikormka modules\n(in cases where it is a GET request).\n\nFigure 34. The content of one log file located on the Operation Groundbait C&C server.\n\nThe journal file contains the communication log between the server and the\nmalware operator. The communication log contains the IP address of the operator,\nthe date, time, and type of request. It should be noted that once downloaded by\nthe malware operator, the file with exfiltrated data gets removed from the server.\n\n\nFigure 35. The content of the journal file located on an Operation Groundbait C&C server.\n\nAccording to our analysis of the communication logs from one server there were\n33 victims, located mostly in Eastern Ukraine. In addition to those, there were\na few victims located in Russia or in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nThe analysis of logs revealed that several malware operators connected to the\nserver using various internet service providers in Kiev and Mariupol. Some of them\naccessed the C&C via the Tor network.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nIn this section we make an attempt to identify the origin of the threat based on\nclues that were intentionally or unintentionally left by the attackers:\n\n   - Most of Prikormka's C&C servers are located in Ukraine and hosted\nby Ukrainian hosting companies\n\n   - The group behind this threat has fluent knowledge of the Russian\nand Ukrainian languages, as evidenced by text in the decoy\ndocuments and malware binaries\n\n   - Some of the PDB-paths revealed that attackers used directories with\nnames in Russian\n\n   - All analyzed Prikormka droppers contained language codes that\n\ncorrespond to Ukrainian (hexadecimal code 0x0422) or Russian\n(0x0419) languages in their PE resources (Figure 37)\n\n   - The compilation timestamps of Prikormka binaries suggest that the\nmalware authors operate in the Eastern European time zone\n\n   - According to C&C server logs, a number of malware operators\nparticipating in Operation Groundbait have been making\nconnections through various internet providers in two Ukrainian\ncities: Kiev and Mariupol.\n\n\nFigure 36. The language codes distribution between droppers.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the droppers from earlier period (2012-2015) do contain resources\nwith Russian language codes. The malware authors gradually switched from Russian to Ukrainian in the mid of 2015.\n\nFigure 38 depicts the distribution of the compilation hour of Prikormka samples.\n\n\nWe can deduce from this that the malware authors work from 6.00 to 16.00 (UTC),\nsometimes staying late in the evening. This corresponds to the period 8.00 to 18.00\nEastern European Time, which would include normal Ukraine working hours.\n\nBased on our research and the abovementioned facts, we conclude that the attackers behind Operation Groundbait are people with an interest in surveillance\nor spying on separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and a few specific\nhigh-profile targets, including Ukrainian politicians. The malware operators and/\nor authors have a knowledge of the Ukrainian and Russian language, and likely\noperate from within Ukrainian borders.\n\n\n36\n\n\n36\n\n\n31\n29\n\n\n25\n\n\n24\n\n\n25\n\n\n21\n\n\n17\n\n\n12\n\n\n12\n\n\n7 7\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\n2\n1 1\n0 0 0\n\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n\nFigure 37. Samples sorted by hour (UTC).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur research into these attack campaigns and the Prikormka malware itself suggests that this threat is the first publicly known Ukrainian malware that is being\nused in targeted attacks.\n\nIn terms of technical advancement, the attackers didn’t demonstrate any sophisticated methods or novel techniques. But whether an attacker uses sophisticated\nmethods or not does not matter as long as they reach their ultimate goal: stealing\nthe sensitive information they need from their targets.\n\nThe most noteworthy achievement accomplished by the attackers behind\nOperation Groundbait is that they have stayed under the radar for over 7 years.\nThe malware has been seen in the wild since at least 2008. This finding is confirmed by the timestamps of binaries, ESET telemetry, and by hosting providers used.\n\n[Operation Groundbait is, after BlackEnergy and Operation Potao Express, yet another](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/20/new-wave-attacks-ukrainian-power-industry/)\ndemonstration that that using highly targeted malware for espionage amidst an\narmed conflict is an everyday reality.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOC) that can be used to identify an infection can be\n[found in Appendix B or on github.](http://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/groundbait)\n\nFor any inquiries or to make sample submissions related to the subject,\n[contact us at: threatintel@eset.com](mailto:threatintel%40eset.com?subject=Operation%20Groundbait)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credits\n\n[Special thanks to @TheEnergyStory](mailto:%40TheEnergyStory?subject=Operation%20Groundbait)\n\n\n-----\n\n## APPENDIX A.
