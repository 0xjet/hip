The\nbot communicates with the command and control server using a custom binary protocol over\nTCP and uses RC4 encryption. This malware has evolved its capabilities since it was\n[documented by Proofpoint [1] back in 2019, and now it can also download and run additional](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/systembc-christmas-july-socks5-malware-and-exploit-kits)\nfiles. Moreover, this malware can target both Windows and Linux platforms.\n\nSystemBC is sold on underground marketplaces, and after completing the purchase, the\nbuyer receives an archive containing the bot executable, the command and control (C2)\nserver executable, and a PHP admin panel.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Archive contents\nThe main capability of SystemBC is to turn the infected computers into SOCKS5 proxies.\nSince most bots are not reachable from the internet, this malware uses a backconnect\narchitecture that allows clients to use the proxies (infected computers) through the\nbackconnect (C2) server without ever needing to interact directly with them.\n\nIn practice, what happens is that for each infected computer that connects to the\nbackconnect (C2) server, the server opens a new TCP port that will accept the SOCKS5\ntraffic from clients. That traffic is wrapped inside SystemBC's communications protocol and\nforwarded to the infected computers that will unwrap the traffic, send it to the destination, and\nsend the response back to the backconnect (C2) server that will finally forward that response\nback to the client that initialized the communication.\n\nFigure 2. SystemBC backconnect architecture\nThere are a couple of variants of SystemBC with some differences in the bot capabilities. All\nvariants turn the infected computer into a SOCKS5 proxy and can perform self-updates, but\nthe more complete variant of SystemBC also presents the following capabilities:\n\nSupport for C2 communications over TORCheck for the Emsisoft Anti-Malware process\n(a2guard.exe)\nDownload and execute executable files (.exe and .dll)\nDownload and execute shellcode\nDownload and execute batch scripts (.cmd and .bat)\nDownload and execute PowerShell scripts (.ps1)\nDownload and execute Visual Basic scripts (.vbs)\n\nSeveral threat actors leveraged SystemBC to maintain a foothold within a company's\nnetwork and launch additional post-exploitation tools. In some panels, we could find tasks\n[showing that SystemBC was used to push CobaltStrike [2] and](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/) [PoshC2 [3].](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Tasks issued to an infected machine\n\nFigure 4. Tasks issued to an infected machine\nWhen the downloaded file is a DLL, SystemBC maps it into its own memory space and\ncreates a new thread to execute the entry point meaning that the DLL file does not touch the\ndisk. Similarly, to download and run files containing shellcode, SystemBC allocates memory\ninside its process memory and creates a new thread to start the execution.\n\nAll other types of files are downloaded and saved to disk under the C:\\Windows\\Temp\ndirectory with a random name and executed using scheduled tasks. The tasks registered to\nrun the PowerShell files will launch powershell.exe with the following command line:\n\n-WindowStyle Hidden -ep bypass -file “<DOWNLOADED POWERSHELL FILE>”.\n\n## Infections telemetry\n\nWhile the usage of this malware has declined among threat actors, our telemetry via\nsinkholes and active command and control (C2) servers still reveals a significant number of\ninfected systems. Since early August, BitSight has observed over 56,000 unique IP\naddresses infected with SystemBC.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Daily infections observed by BitSight\nThe geographic distribution reveals the wide impact of SystemBC around the world.\nCountries like India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Brazil, United States, Egypt, Philippines,\nAlgeria and Turkey are in the top 10 of the most affected countries, representing around 58%\nof the total number of infections observed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Geographic distribution of infected systems\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSystemBC is an interesting piece of malware that can be leveraged differently depending on\nthe threat actor's goals. Sometimes infected computers are only used to send traffic, but they\ncan also be instructed to download and run post-exploitation tools such as CobaltStrike.\nWhile the usage of this malware has decreased compared to the previous years, we\ncontinue to see significant numbers of victims all over the world.\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/systembc-christmas-july-socks5malware-and-exploit-kits\n\n[2] [https://www.cobaltstrike.com/](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\n\n[3] [https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nBackconnect (C2) servers observed since early August:\n\n193.106.191[.]168\n\n188.127.224[.]46\n\n45.10.42[.]221\n\n193.106.191[.]184\n\n193.106.191[.]185\n\n\n-----\n\n185.215.113[.]105\n188.214.129[.]3\n\n139.144.79[.]152\n\n45.66.248[.]209\n\n89.22.225[.]242\n\n195.62.53[.]253\n\n20.115.47[.]118\n\n92.53.90[.]84\n\n152.89.198[.]73\n\n194.36.177[.]46\n\n162.33.179[.]100\n\nUpdated list available in the following url:\n\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/main/systembc/c2.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/main/systembc/c2.txt)\n\n## Get the Weekly Cybersecurity Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to get security news and industry ratings updates in your inbox.\n\nRead more\nBy checking this box, I consent to sharing this information with BitSight Technologies,\nInc. to receive email and phone communications for sales and marketing purposes as\n[described in our privacy policy.
