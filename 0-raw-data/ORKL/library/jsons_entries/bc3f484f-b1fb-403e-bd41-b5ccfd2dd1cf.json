They\nprovide a common place for all victim machines to reach out to, be controlled from, and allow\nmultiple users to interact with the same victims. When performing authorized testing, this is\nvery important as logs are kept in a single place to aid reporting. However, more and more of\nthese tools are being utilized by criminals, including open-source and commercial tools. Their\nease of use and stability allows them to run for long periods without issues, which is one of\nthe reasons that even criminals are moving to these C&C platforms instead of building their\nown.\n\nWith most of the attention being paid on established commercial tools such as Cobalt Strike,\ncriminals have been looking for other alternatives that provide many of the same functions.\nFor defenders, this means that as criminals turn to open-source C&C software (which gives\nthem many different options available, and in some cases using multiple platforms on one\nhost), the threat landscape is evolving, incorporating a larger number of tools that will make\nattacks more difficult for both individuals and organizations to defend themselves against.\n\n[Some of the popular alternative frameworks that attackers have turned to include Brute Ratel](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/j/black-basta-infiltrates-networks-via-qakbot-brute-ratel-and-coba.html)\n[and Sliver. In this publication, we will focus on providing information on another similar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/24/looking-for-the-sliver-lining-hunting-for-emerging-command-and-control-frameworks/)\nframework defenders might encounter — DeimosC2, another open-source alternative. We\nwill explain how DeimosC2 works and how you can identify related traffic and binaries to help\ndefend your networks.\n\n## Open-Source C&C software\n\nMuch like some of the other open-source C&C frameworks such as Ares C2, PoshC2 and\nTrevorC2, DeimosC2 provides classic C&C framework features but also provides a user\ninterface that feels and behaves much like a commercial tool such as Cobalt Strike or\nMetasploit Pro. As such, red teamers have been discussing DeimosC2 more frequently.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. A tweet listing DeimosC2 as one of the C&C frameworks for red teamers\nThe [2matrix website is designed to help red teamers find the right framework for their](https://www.thec2matrix.com/)\nengagements and includes a matrix comparing open-source and commercial products. While\nsome are popular and recognizable frameworks, others are new and upcoming frameworks\nwith specific purposes. While these sites can help red teams and penetration-testing teams\nfind the right product for their needs, they could also aid criminals find the next framework to\nuse: preferably one that is growing in support and not detected well by the security industry.\n\nTo date, in the criminal underground, there is not as much discussion around DeimosC2 as\nan alternative, but attackers might be using DeimosC2 in the near future as a tool of choice\nand as part of their migration away from Cobalt Strike. The other tools that we’ve observed\nbeing discussed and used are PoshC2, PHPSploit, and Merlin. Similar to red teamers,\ncybercriminals like to use a mix of command line- and GUI-based C&C frameworks,\ndepending on their preference among ease to build, maintain, and operate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. DeimosC2 appearing in a list of recommended alternatives to Cobalt Strike on one\nRussian-speaking forum\n[In July 2022, Censys published a blog entry on the open-source C&C frameworks being](https://censys.io/russian-ransomware-c2-network-discovered-in-censys-data/)\nused by ransomware groups. This included PoshC2 and DeimosC2 being employed in\npartnership with Metasploit and Acunetix, which are used for vulnerability scanning and\nsystem exploitation. Either PoshC2 or DeimosC2 was then used for the post-exploitation\nC&C communications.\n\nWhile DeimosC2 is not the most popular choice for attackers currently looking for other C&C\nplatforms to use, this is also exactly one of the reasons that it is important to study it in\nadvance. Attackers will continue to evaluate tools that are lower in popularity, hoping that\nthese systems go undetected for longer. Because of this, we have decided to look at\nDeimosC2 to get a better idea of what might make a criminal want to use this platform as\ntheir C&C framework of choice.\n\n## What is DeimosC2?\n\n[DeimosC2 is an open-source C&C framework that was released in June 2020. It is a fully-](https://github.com/DeimosC2/DeimosC2/commit/4d4e3160219cfaffd1572eb6aa68470007c76fc1)\nfunctional framework that allows for multiple attackers to access, create payloads for, and\ninteract with victim computers. As a post-exploitation C&C framework, DeimosC2 will\ngenerate the payloads that need to be manually executed on computer servers that have\nbeen compromised through other means such as social engineering, exploitation, or brute\n\n-----\n\nforce attacks. Once it is deployed, the threat actors will gain the same access to the systems\nas the user account that the payload was executed as, either as an administrator or a regular\nuser. Note that DeimosC2 does not perform active or privilege escalation of any kind.\n\nPost-exploitation C&C servers are popular with red teams since they provide a convenient\nmethod of interacting with multiple victim machines, collecting notes, and storing evidence of\nwhat was done to each machine so that when incident responses are involved in any\ncleanup efforts, they can be provided information on everything that was done while the red\nteam was in the systems.\n\n## The features Of DeimosC2\n\nDeimosC2 has two options for installation on a system: a pre-built binary that does not\ndepend on Go being installed, and the source code that can be compiled and run on any\nsystem with Go installed. For this research, the pre-built binaries inside of a Debian virtual\nmachine (VM) were used, so some behaviors might be different compared to if the source\ncode directly downloaded from the GitHub project had been used.\n\nFigure 3. DeimosC2 server binaries on GitHub\nDeimosC2 combines a lot of the same features as other C&Csoftware platforms. One of the\nmain purposes for a C&C system like DeimosC2 is to help red teams and penetration testers\nconsolidate their infrastructure, collaborate with others by sharing compromised hosts during\nthe engagement, and aid with reporting when engagements are finished. With that in mind,\nDeimosC2 has multiple user support with two roles for the users: Administrator and User.\nFigure 4 shows the two user setups in our tests of DeimosC2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of user configuration in DeimosC2\nSince DeimosC2 is also aimed at red teams, it has support for multifactor authentication\n(MFA), an API, backup, and restore features, as well as an ability to mark systems as either\na development or a production system.\n\nOnce the users are set up, the next step is to set up the listeners, which are the sockets and\nprotocols that the victim machines will reach out to. DeimosC2 has five types of listeners that\nusers can configure for their payloads, with the most common that we’ve seen so far being\nHTTPS and TCP. We expect that as the popularity of tools like these grow, it is likely that we\nwill see malicious actors use the DNS over HTTPS DNS over HTTPs (DoH) option as well.\n\nFigure 5. Screenshot showing the listener setting types\nOnce a selection is made, in this case HTTPS, the listener is configured by entering the data\nrequired for mandatory and certain optional settings. Settings such as domain names and IP\naddresses are required by the user, while the key and most of the advanced settings are\noptional.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Screenshot showing the HTTPS listener settings\nInside the advanced settings, there are some configurable options for how the C&C server\nworks. This is where you will find the settings for changing the default paths that the victim\nwill use over HTTP POST to the C&C server. By default, these paths are /login, /index,\n/settings, and /profile, but these can be changed during the creation of the listener. They can\nalso be changed at a later time; however, new binaries will need to be created.\n\nOnce all the settings are configured, the binaries will be created based on the options in the\n“compile options” portion of the settings. These settings determine which binaries are to be\ncreated and if they should be obfuscated.\n\nOnce the binaries are created, they are downloaded via the interface by selecting “interact”\nfrom the listener options.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Screenshot of the listeners created for the HTTPS listener\nOnce downloaded, these are ready to deploy on a machine that has been compromised via\nanother means such as through phishing or an exploit. The ease of use to create postexploitation binaries for C&C communications makes this an attractive framework for red\nteamers and penetration testers to include in their arsenal of tools.\n\n## DeimosC2 agent analysis\n\n[While many of the DeimosC2 samples are obfuscated with gobfuscate, an open-source tool](https://github.com/unixpickle/gobfuscate)\nfor obfuscating programs written in Go language, we also found non-obfuscated samples.\nThese allowed us to spot DeimosC2 package names, where we figured out that this was an\nopen-source post-exploitation C2 framework. It is also possible to manually de-obfuscate the\nimplemented changes of a tool like gobfuscate, but this will take more time for the\ninvestigator.\n\nIn DeimosC2 terminology, a client binary intended to infect victims is called an agent.\nDeimosC2 leverages the multi-platform nature of the Go language to compile agents for\ndifferent architectures such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android.\n\nThe agent is straightforward: When executed, it immediately tries to contact the listener in\nthe hard-coded C&C domain or IP address, except when an execution time range is set.\n\nDeimosC2 agents use three different keys to exchange messages with the listener.\n\n## Agent key\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is a unique key that identifies the agent. The key is initially set to\n\"000000000000000000000000000000000000\", but the first response from the listener\nupdates it to a new version, 4 UUID.\n\n## AES key\n\nThis 256-bit AES key is randomly generated every time an agent talks to a C&C listener. This\nis used to encrypt messages exchanged with the C&C listener.\n\n## RSA key\n\nAside from AES encryption, DeimosC2 uses RSA-2048 to encrypt both the agent and the\nAES keys previously explained. The agent uses a hard-coded public key to encrypt the other\nkeys, while the C&C listener decrypts the data with its private key.\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the encryption process from the agent's perspective.\n\nFigure 8. The DeimosC2 Agent encryption scheme\nThe first message sent to the C&C listener includes information about the infected machine\nin JSON format, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Sample JSON data sent to the C&C listener for the first time\nThe data sent includes information about the operating system, installed antivirus products,\nthe host name, the logged username, the internal IP address, the agent path on the file\nsystem, available shell programs, the Process ID (PID), and user privileges.\n\n## Commands\n\nThe C2 listener response can include one or more commands (called \"jobs” in DeimosC2\nterminology). Table 1 provides a description of these commands.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nshell Executes shell commands\n\ndownload Downloads a file to the C&C server\n\nupload Uploads a file to the infected machine\n\noptions The jitter and delay options set the sleep time for C&C communications.\nThe eol (which we assume means end-of-life) option sets a date for the\nagent to exit, while the hours option configures the time range for\ncommunication.\n\nfileBrowser Asks the agent to list all files and directories on a given path\n\nshellInject Injects and runs custom shellcode in the agent process\n\nmodule Executes a module\n\n\n-----\n\nreinit Reconnects the agent, which causes the agent to get a new Agent Key\n\npivotTCP Starts a TCP server in the infected machine so it can be used as a listener\nby other agents; useful for infecting machines that do not have internet\naccess\n\npivotJob Handles pivot jobs\n\npivotKill Resets the list of pivot listeners\n\nkill Uninstalls the agent\n\nTable 1. DeimosC2 commands and their descriptions\n\n## Modules\n\nDeimosC2 extends its functionalities through modules that can be executed in the victim's\nmachine. In our lab, the following modules were available:\n\n**Module** **Description**\n\nscreengrab Takes a screenshot on an infected machine\n\nminidump Generates a user-mode minidump of a given process\n\nlsadump Downloads SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives for credentials stealing\n\nntdsdump Downloads Ntds.dit and SYSTEM files for credentials stealing\n\nsamdump Downloads SECURITY, SYSTEM, and SAM registry hives for credentials\nstealing\n\nshadowdump Downloads /etc/shadow files from Linux machines\n\nTable 2. The available DeimosC2 modules, as seen in our lab\n\nThe module interface of DeimosC2 allows the C&C listener to push new modules and\nexecute them from either disk or memory (using code injection).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network analysis\n\nAs we previously mentioned, there are a few listener types that users can choose while using\nDeimosC2, including HTTPS, TCP, and DoH. These are likely to be the most common\noptions as they are popular with other C&C platforms. We were able to investigate how these\nlisteners worked in detail because of DeimosC2’s open-source nature.\n\n## HTTPS listener\n\nOnce the listener is running for HTTPS, we observed that there was a default webpage that\nwas configured. By reviewing the GitHub page, we confirmed that it was a default Ubuntu\nwebpage for Apache.\n\nFigure 10. Nmap results showing the default Apache Ubuntu page for the title\nBased on the configuration of the listener during setup, we know that the tool uses a few\npaths. Looking into the .go version of the agent source code, we can see the processes that\nhave been set up and are being used.\n\nFigure 11. Go\n\nvariables for the paths used by the agent\nThe variable “firsttime” is used for the initial communication to the server. From then on, the\nvariable “checkin” will be used as a heartbeat.\n\nBased on this, we can fingerprint if the C&C server is in the default configuration and if\nHTTPS inspection is enabled. The agents will send HTTP POST to /login, and then to /index\nafterward at periodical intervals. The default port used for the HTTPS listener is 4443.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, this can be changed easily when creating the listener on any other port. The\nvariable “moduleloc” at /profile is used to send data from the agent back to the server. Finally,\nthe “piviotloc” variable is used to pass data through the current victim as part of the\npreviously described piviotTCP functionality of the agents.\n\nFigure 12. The sendMsg function in the HTTPS_agent.go showing http.Post call\nFigure 13 shows an encrypted POST request sent by an agent configured to use an HTTPS\nlistener. By default, it uses /login to send the first message, after which the agent sends\nrequests to /checkin by default.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. An encrypted POST request sent by an agent configured to use a HTTPS listener\n\n## TCP listener\n\n\n-----\n\nThe TCP listener utilizes the Go language functions to create a packet and send it to a\ncreated socket. The flow for encryption works the same as it does with the HTTPS\nencryption. The only difference, in this case, is that there is a length for the overall message\nthat will aid in the decryption of the data. To accomplish this, it prepends the encrypted data\nwith the length of the data that was encrypted and is to be sent. This is sent to the socket,\nand then to the C&C server.\n\nFigure 14. The sendMsg function from the TCP listener Go code\nBased on our analysis of the packets that were being sent from the TCP agent to the listener,\nthis part has a predictable behavior. Because of the uint64 call, the created length will be in\nan unsigned integer that is 64 bits or 8 bytes long. The start of the data portion of the packet\nwill have 8 bytes for the length of the packet to follow. This was the case with most of the\ninformation we observed on the heartbeat communications to the C&C server. Each packet\nwas 350 bytes in total with 296 bytes of data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Data portion of the packet (highlighted) of the TCP agent communicating to the\nC&C server\nSince we know that the packet size is prepended to the data portion of the packet, and that it\nis an unsigned integer of 8 bytes, we can conclude that the first 8 bytes of the data is the size\nthat will be followed in processing the packets.\n\nIn this case, where there is a data field of 296 bytes, if we take away the 8 bytes for the\nlength field, this will leave 288 bytes for the commands from the C&C server. This is easily\ncalculated if we take 288 bytes and convert it to the hexadecimal system, resulting in 0x120\nor 01 20, which is what we find after the first 6 bytes of 0s in the examples we have seen.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Packet structure of the DeimosC2 TCP packets\nOne possible way to detect this behavior is with a snort rule that looks for the heartbeat\n[traffic. Here is an example of a Snort rule that would detect our sample packets:](https://www.snort.org/)\n\nalert tcp any any -> any any (content: \"|00 00 00 00 00 00 01 20|\"; offset: 0; depth: 8;\nmsg:\"Possible DeimosC2 TCP\n\nAgent Heartbeat Communications\"; sid:123400; priority:3; rev:1;)\n\nBased on testing in Snort with only this rule enabled, we confirmed that it will detect the\nheartbeat communications from the TCP agent. Note that this rule might need tuning based\non specific setups to remove false positives and enhance sensor performance.\n\nFigure 17. Screenshot of an example alert from the Snort Rule\n\n## DoH listener\n\nThe DoH or DNS over HTTPS listener uses DNS queries to communicate with the C&C\nserver. One of the advantages of using DoH is that there are no direct communications with\nthe C&C server. However, there is a delay in the communications; therefore, DoH is often\nused if stealth is a requirement for the red-team engagement DeimosC2 utilizes the HTTPS\n\n\n-----\n\nJSON API for DNS from Google. This is different from the RFC 8484-compliant DoH\nrequests that [Google also supports. It is an easier solution programmatically and is common](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh)\nfor attackers to use.\n\nFigure 18. Screenshot of the Go code showing the use of dns.google.com/resolve\nWithin the listener configuration, there are two names you can change: the firsttime and\ncheckin variables. When setting up the listener, the default names for these are getname and\ncheckin, respectively. When the agent first reaches out to the listener, it will first use the\nfirsttime variable, after which the checkin variable will be used for the heartbeat\ncommunications. Unlike HTTPS and TCP, the agent will not communicate directly with the\nlistener, but it will communicate to the DNS Google service previously mentioned.\n\nFigure 19. Variables used for the initial communications to the DoH listener\nOn initial setup, one query that can be observed looks like the following:\n\nhttps://dns.google.com/resolve?\nname=0000000000.6765746e616d65.ftr.trendmicro.com\n\nWhen you look at this query, there are a few things that stand out, one of which is the\n6765746e616d65 subdomain that is generated from the code during the check-in process. In\nthis case, the value takes the variable firsttime and converts its content to a hexadecimal\nsystem based on its ASCII values (getname in our case). This is then used as the first\nsubdomain sent to dns.google.com. To decode this, the AES key is needed from either the\nagent or the C&C server itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. The DoH agent code for the initial check-in process\nAll these methods we’ve discussed are based on the paths and variables that are set to the\ndefaults in the configuration, which is easy to change while building the listeners. Changing\nthe default settings is good for when a red team is using it, since they can work with the blue\nteams to help find their traffic in the network logs. However, when a criminal changes these\nsettings, it will make it more difficult to find them in future campaigns, since they change their\nvariables to alter their tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) slightly to avoid detection or\nmodify configurations based on the campaign. We present this information to help defenders\nunderstand what is happening behind the scenes in DeimosC2 should they encounter nondefault behavior in an attack.\n\n## Changing default listener settings\n\nChanging the paths is easy to achieve in the DeimosC2 user interface; take for example the\ndefault paths for the HTTPS Listener of /login, /index, /settings and /profile. To change this,\nall an attacker needs to do is to expand the Advanced Options while building the listener.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. Screenshot of the Advanced Options while building the HTTPS listener\nChanging the paths is likely something that an attacker will do, and this will cause some of\nthe things we’ve previously discussed to change in the binaries and in the traffic patterns.\nFor instance, if the getname in the DOH agent is changed, it will no longer go to\n6765746e616d65 but will instead redirect to a subdomain of whatever it was changed to,\nconverted to the hexadecimal system (an example being “trendmicroftr”, which would look\nlike 7472656e646d6963726f667472 in the DoH query). This is one of the things that makes\nfinding some of these red team tools increasingly more difficult since the evasion techniques\nare built into the options.\n\nEach of the listeners can be updated for specific information that will change some of the\npaths and subdomains that are used. The TCP listener has the least number of options and\nas of writing, will likely be one of the easiest listeners to detect via network monitoring\nmethods.\n\n## Recommendations for defending networks against DeimosC2\n\nDetecting C&C traffic can be a difficult proposition for network defenders across the globe.\nFortunately, during our investigation into DeimosC2, we have found some techniques that\ncan be used to detect the presence of the agents communicating with the servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile some network activities are dynamic, such as the inspection of the paths of the\nURL (as these can be changed by malicious actors while setting up the listeners),\nothers are predictable. For example, the first 8 bytes of the TCP listener\ncommunication can be used for detection using the provided Snort rule in an intrusion\ndetection system (IDS).\nIn the case of the DoH example, if defenders are not using a service that leverages the\nJSON version of DoH within normal business operations, it is recommended that\nHTTPS to dns[.]google is blocked or at least logged. Most of the current DeimosC2\nsamples that leverage DoH currently use the JSON version of DoH provided by\nGoogle, which will stop this agent from working altogether.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that DeimosC2 is a post-exploitation C&C framework,\nand if you are seeing its traffic on your network, you have already been compromised by\nanother means, and this is just the actor setting up persistency. If you detect DeimosC2 in\nyour system, you should be aware there will likely be other attack tools deployed that you\nmight not be aware of. Assuming a stance that you are already compromised also provides\nadditional defensive options:\n\nDefenders should perform regular monitoring of outbound communications for top\ntalkers. In particular, they should flag any hosts that have a significantly larger amount\nof data sent than during a normal monitoring period.\nLooking for communications that are new but also occur suddenly and frequently is an\nimportant part of network defense and helps not only in spotting DeimosC2\ncommunications but also in helping spot other malware and communications that are\nmalicious in nature early — especially if they are based on any sort of phone home or\nheartbeat patterns.\n\nAlthough not designed to be a defensive measure, these kinds of tools can also sometimes\nprovide an unexpected advantage for the defenders. As we mentioned, a C&C framework is\nmeant to make the lives of penetration testers and red teamers easier through a variety of\nfunctions, such as by logging every command they run (whether this is on by default varies\nfrom framework to framework).\n\nWhile non-malicious actors use these kinds of tools to enable faster report creation, if\ninvestigators are able to seize a server in which the attackers had this option configured\n(perhaps unknowingly), it can be a fantastic source of intelligence on the attacker’s postcompromise activities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report was intended to shed light on one of several C&C frameworks that criminals are\nusing. DeimosC2 is one of the alternative tools that SOC teams will likely see being used\nagainst their networks for post-compromise activities. Over the coming months and years,\n\n\n-----\n\nwe expect to see a rise in the use of many of these alternative C&C frameworks. We have\nalready seen malicious actors switching from Cobalt Strike to these alternatives as defenders\nget better at identifying and blocking the communications and agents that are deployed.\n\nIt is important to remember that tools like these are dual-purpose: Their presence does not\nimmediately indicate cybercriminal behavior since they are also popular with both internal\nand external penetration testers and red teams. While the red team’s role is to perform\nadversary simulations and work with companies to help them defend their networks from\nthese exact same tools, it is still in the interest of network defenders to be aware of their\npresence. By learning how to identify and block these tools, an organization can strengthen\ntheir defensive posture and prevent attackers from pivoting within networks, exfiltrating data,\nor generally doing harm to enterprises.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n Known historical DeimosC2 servers\n\nThese are IP addresses that were observed to have a DeimosC2 panel.
