    "plain_text": "# FBI, DHS, HHS Warn of Imminent, Credible Ransomware Threat Against U.S. Hospitals\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/fbi-dhs-hhs-warn-of-imminent-credible-ransomware-threat-against-u-s-hospitals/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/fbi-dhs-hhs-warn-of-imminent-credible-ransomware-threat-against-u-s-hospitals/)**\n\nOn Monday, Oct. 26, KrebsOnSecurity began following up on a tip from a reliable source that\nan aggressive Russian cybercriminal gang known for deploying ransomware was preparing\nto disrupt information technology systems at hundreds of hospitals, clinics and medical care\nfacilities across the United States. Today, officials from the FBI and the U.S. Department of\n**Homeland Security hastily assembled a conference call with healthcare industry executives**\nwarning about an “imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe agencies on the conference call, which included the U.S. Department of Health and\n**Human Services (HHS), warned participants about “credible information of an increased**\nand imminent cybercrime threat to US hospitals and healthcare providers.”\n\nThe agencies said they were sharing the information “to provide warning to healthcare\nproviders to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect their\nnetworks from these threats.”\n\nThe warning came less than two days after this author received a tip from Alex Holden,\n[founder of Milwaukee-based cyber intelligence firm Hold Security. Holden said he saw online](https://www.holdsecurity.com/)\ncommunications this week between cybercriminals affiliated with a Russian-speaking\n[ransomware group known as Ryuk in which group members discussed plans to deploy](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ryuk&x=0&y=0)\nransomware at more than 400 healthcare facilities in the U.S.\n\nOne participant on the government conference call today said the agencies offered few\nconcrete details of how healthcare organizations might better protect themselves against this\nthreat actor or purported malware campaign.\n\n[“They didn’t share any IoCs [indicators of compromise], so it’s just been ‘patch your systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise)\nand report anything suspicious’,” said a healthcare industry veteran who sat in on the\ndiscussion.\n\nHowever, others on the call said IoCs may be of little help for hospitals that have already\nbeen infiltrated by Ryuk. That’s because the malware infrastructure used by the Ryuk gang is\noften unique to each victim, including everything from the Microsoft Windows executable files\nthat get dropped on the infected hosts to the so-called “command and control” servers used\nto transmit data between and among compromised systems.\n\nNevertheless, cybersecurity incident response firm Mandiant today released a list of\ndomains and Internet addresses used by Ryuk in previous attacks throughout 2020 and up\nto the present day. Mandiant refers to the group by the threat actor classification “UNC1878,”\n[and aired a webcast today detailing some of Ryuk’s latest exploitation tactics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhjQ6zsCVSc)\n\n**[Charles Carmakal, senior vice president for Mandiant, told Reuters that UNC1878 is one of](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-cyber/fbi-probes-string-of-recent-ransomware-attacks-on-us-hospitals-idUSKBN27D35U)**\nmost brazen, heartless, and disruptive threat actors he’s observed over the course of his\ncareer.\n\n“Multiple hospitals have already been significantly impacted by Ryuk ransomware and their\nnetworks have been taken offline,” Carmakal said.\n\nOne health industry veteran who participated in the call today and who spoke with\nKrebsOnSecurity on condition of anonymity said if there truly are hundreds of medical\nfacilities at imminent risk here, that would seem to go beyond the scope of any one hospital\ngroup and may implicate some kind of electronic health record provider that integrates with\nmany care facilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo far, however, nothing like hundreds of facilities have publicly reported ransomware\nincidents. But there have been a handful of hospitals dealing with ransomware attacks in the\npast few days.\n\n–Becker’s Hospital Review [reported today that a ransomware attack hit Klamath Falls, Ore.-](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/oregon-hospital-shuts-down-computer-system-after-ransomware-attack-4-notes.html)\nbased Sky Lakes Medical Center’s computer systems.\n\n–WWNY’s Channel 7 News in New York [reported yesterday that a Ryuk ransomware attack](https://www.wwnytv.com/2020/10/27/gouverneur-canton-potsdam-hospitals-dealing-with-computer-problems/#:~:text=(WWNY)%20%2D%20St.%20Lawrence,and%20employee%20information%20was%20compromised.&text=Patient%20care%20continues%20to%20be%20delivered%20safely%20and%20effectively.%E2%80%9D)\non St. Lawrence Health System led to computer infections at Caton-Potsdam, Messena and\nGouverneur hospitals.\n\n–SWNewsMedia.com [on Monday reported on “unidentified network activity” that caused](https://www.swnewsmedia.com/chanhassen_villager/news/local/unusual-network-activity-at-ridgeview-medical-center/article_5fc12f6e-c320-59d4-9ad4-24f5cb985a36.html)\ndisruption to certain operations at Ridgeview Medical Center in Waconia, Minn. SWNews\nsays Ridgeview’s system includes Chaska’s Two Twelve Medical Center, three hospitals,\nclinics and other emergency and long-term care sites around the metro area.\n\n–NBC5 [reports The University of Vermont Health Network is dealing with a “significant and](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/cyberattack-being-investigated-as-possible-cause-of-uvm-health-network-outage/34514337)\nongoing system-wide network issue” that could be a malicious cyber attack.\n\n-A [story at BleepingComputer.com says Wyckoff Hospital in New York suffered a Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brooklyn-and-vermont-hospitals-are-latest-ryuk-ransomware-victims/)\nransomware attack on Oct. 28.\n\nThis is a developing story. Stay tuned for further updates.\n\n**Update, 10:11 p.m. ET: The FBI, DHS and HHS just jointly issued an alert about this,**\n[available here.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-302A_Ransomware%20_Activity_Targeting_the_Healthcare_and_Public_Health_Sector.pdf)\n\n**Update, Oct. 30, 11:14 a.m. ET: Added mention of Wyckoff hospital Ryuk compromise.**\n\n\n-----",
