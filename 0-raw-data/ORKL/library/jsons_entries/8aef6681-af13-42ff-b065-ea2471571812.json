While investigating MiniDuke\nloaders in April 2014, we were surprised to notice that the\nmalicious executable being decompressed and loaded\ninto memory was very similar to the Cosmu family of\ninformation-stealers, which we saw as long ago as 2001.\nCosmu is the first malware family we have seen to share\ncode with MiniDuke.\n\nThis analysis is focused on those Cosmu samples that\nshare code with MiniDuke. Some of these are older than\nthe oldest publicly documented MiniDuke samples,\nimplying that the shared code might have been originally\nused by Cosmu, not MiniDuke. For convenience, we\ndecided to name the samples showing this amalgamation\nof MiniDuke-derived loader and Cosmu-derived payload\nCosmicDuke.\n\nThe filenames and content used in CosmicDuke’s\nattack files to lure victims into opening them contain\nreferences to the countries of Ukraine, Poland, Turkey\nand Russia,either generally in use of language or included\ndetail, or in allusions to events or institutions. The\nfilenames and content chosen seem to be tailored to their\ntarget’s interests, though at the time of writing, we have\nno further information on the identity or location of these\nvictims.\n\nCosmicDuke infections start by tricking victims into\nopening either a PDF file that contains an exploit or a\nWindows executable whose filename is manipulated to\nmake it look like a document or image file.\n\nOnce the victim opens the file, the malware gains\npersistence on the system and starts collecting\ninformation. The data collection components include a\nkeylogger, clipboard stealer, screenshotter, and password\nstealers for a variety of popular chat, email and web\n\n\nbrowsing programs. It also collects information about\nthe files on the system, and has the capability to export\ncryptographic certificates and the associated private keys.\n\nOnce the information has been collected, it is sent out to\nremote servers via FTP. In addition to stealing information\nfrom the system, Cosmu allows the attacker to download\nand execute other malware on the system.\n\nF-Secure has detections for all the different malicious\ncomponents used by the Cosmu variants described in this\nreport.\n\n###### SCOPE\n\nWe have seen dozens of Cosmu samples that share code\nwith MiniDuke. Rather than cover the entire spectrum\nof samples, the scope of this analysis was intentionally\nlimited to highlighting the most interesting of the\nrecent samples. This includes examining the attack files\nused to infect targets, the remote servers storing data\ncollected from the victims and the differences between\nthe MiniDuke loaders and Cosmu info-stealers used in the\nsamples.\n\n###### TARGET\n\nThis analysis is based on examination of files we gathered\nthrough our sample collection systems. Based on the\nnature of the filenames and decoy documents used, and\nthe fact that the MiniDuke loader is known to be used as a\npart of targeted attacks, we suspect that CosmicDuke may\nalso be used in such operations. At the time of writing,\nwe have not identified any victims ourselves, nor are we\naware of any public reports confirming this scenario.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ARRIVAL\n\nAt this time, we have no information on how the\nCosmicDuke attack files are delivered to the victims,\nthough based on the findings from the analysis, we can\nmake an educated guess.\n\nIt is possible that the PDF documents containing exploits\nwere emailed to the targeted users as file attachments.\nAssuming that the email gateway used by the victims does\nnot include an antivirus solution capable of identifying the\nexploit, such files would have little impediment to being\nspread by email.\n\nIt is however unlikely that the samples which camouflaged\nthe executable files as image or document files would\nbe distributed in the same way. Regardless of any tricks\nplayed with the filenames, the files themselves are\nWindows executables, and many email solutions today\nprevent users from opening attached executable files.\n\n###### INFECTION\n\nThe attackers are using at least two different methods for\ninfecting the systems: exploits and social engineering.\n\n###### DOCUMENT-BASED EXPLOIT\n\nCosmicDuke malware samples that use exploits to gain\nentry onto a target system (referred to as exploit files\nin the rest of this document) start with a malicious\nFlash object embedded into a PDF file. When the file is\nlaunched, the object exploits the known CVE-2011-0611\nvulnerability in specific versions of Adobe Flash, Reader\nand Acrobat products.\n\nUnlike the CosmicDuke files geared towards social\nengineering, the exploit files do not actually display\nany documents to the user as a form of distraction; the\nmalware simply straightaway exploits the vulnerability.\n\n###### SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\nLess technically challenging CosmicDuke samples use\nsimple social engineering to trick the user into willingly\nlaunching the attack file. Once launched, the file drops\nthe malware onto the system (such files are therefore\nreferred to as droppers in the rest of this documents).\n\nTo do so, the malware’s executable file is first disguised as\nan image or document to make it seem innocuous. When\nlaunched, a document or image is displayed in order to\ndraw the user’s attention away from any background\nactivity. In the meantime, the malware’s malicious files are\nsilently installed and executed on the system.\n\n\n###### 3\n\n DATA THEFT \n\nCosmicDuke’s primary purpose is to steal information. The\ndifferent ways it collects information from the infected\nmachine are as follows:\n\nyy Keylogger\n\nyy Taking screenshots\n\nyy Stealing data from clipboard\n\nyy Stealing files\n\nyy Stealing PKI certificates and associated private keys\n\nyy Stealing usernames and passwords from browsers,\ninstant messengers and email clients\n\nyy Stealing WLAN passwords\n\nyy Stealing Windows password hashes\n\n###### DATA TRANSMISSION\n\nThe information collected by the malware is automatically\nuploaded to remote servers via FTP. Our analysis also\nreveals various details of the remote sites contacted by\nCosmicDuke, including the login credentials used and the\nFTP folder structure.\n\nAt the time of writing, most of these remote sites are live.\nA list of the servers CosmicDuke malware connects to is\non page 15.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4\n\n### TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nCosmicDuke samples can be divided into 3 distinct groups\nbased on similarities between the C&C servers they\ncontact, file characteristics and decoy document used.\nThe full details of how the samples were grouped is listed\non page 11; Figure 2 at left provides a quick summary of the\ngrouping as they relate to how CosmicDuke is delivered,\nand the decoy documents shown.\n\nThe first group of samples (Group #1) is spread using 3\ndropper files that display specific decoy documents. The\nsecond sample group (Group #2) uses both exploit-loaded\nfiles and dropper files. The third group (Group #3) is rather\nan exception, as it does not use the droppers or exploits\nlisted here; for the sake of simplicity, we will exclude\nconsidering Group #3’s delivery method.\n\n\n###### FIGURE 2: COSMICDUKE SAMPLES GROUPED BY INFECTION VECTOR\n\n\n###### GROUP #1\n\nDROPPERS:\nrcs.Заказ.doc\nrcs.18.jpg\nrcs.DSC_1365527283.jpg\n\n\n###### GROUP #2 GROUP #3\n\nEXPLOITS & **?**\nDROPPERS\n\n\nImage 1: Screenshot of folder containing CosmicDuke dropper files\n\n\n###### DROPPER: RLO\n\nCosmicDuke’s author(s) disguised the fact that the\nmalware is an executable file by using the Right-to-Left\nOverride (RLO) feature in Windows to hide the file’s\ncorrect file extension, .exe or .scr, and replace it with .jpg,\n.pdf or .doc, in order to make the file appear to be an\ninnocuous document or image.\n\nImage 1 is a screenshot of how the filenames look like in\nWindows 7. The real file extension for the top four files is\n.scr, while the real extension for the bottom one is .exe.\n\nNote that the attacker has also carefully changed the icon\nof the executable to reflect the fake filetype for the first\nfour.\n\nThe bottom file is a curious exception, as it does not use a\nPDF icon as would be expected with a .pdf file extension;\ninstead, it uses an NVIDIA icon, most likely to reflect the\nfact that the product name of the executable is listed\nas “NVIDIA Update Components” in the file’s version\ninformation. This seems to be a common fake product\nname used in the latest Cosmu samples. Meanwhile, the\n\n\nfilename readily visible to the users is translated from\nTurkish as “civilian crisis center status report”.\n\nThe use of RLO is a smart move from the attackers. Why\ngo through the trouble of exploiting anything if you can\nsimply trick the user into double-clicking an executable\nthat looks a lot like a document file?\n\nAs the screenshot demonstrates, unchecking “Hide\nextensions for known filetypes” does not help. The threeletter file extensions seen at the end of the filename is not\nthe real file extension. Even though the information in the\nType column is correct, most of the users probably do not\neven check it.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 5\n\n\n###### DROPPER: DECOYS\n\nCosmicDuke dropper files all display some kind of a decoy\ndocument or image to distract the user when the attack\nfile is launched.\n\n\nImage 2: Decoy shown\nby rcs.Заказ.doc\n\n\nrcs.Ukraine-Gas-Pipelines-Security-Report-March-2014.pdf\n\n\nImage 4: Decoy shown by\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 6\n\n EXPLOIT\n\nThe code used by CosmicDuke to exploit the CVE-20110611 vulnerability appears to be derived from this proofof-concept code that was made available in early 2011:\n\nyy http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17473/\n\nThe samples we analyzed of the exploit-based\nCosmicDuke variety had the file names and SHA1 values\nlisted in Figure 3 at right (see “Appendix A | Samples” for\nmore details).\n\nSome of these exploit files have interesting filenames,\nsuch as “dip.mail march.pdf” and “Bulletin-PISM-No31-(625)-March-10-2014.pdf”. The PISM mentioned in\nthe latter presumably refers to the Polish Institute of\nInternational Affairs[ [1]].\n\n###### LOADER: MINIDUKE 3RD STAGE\n\nThe CosmicDuke samples we analyzed used the same\nloader as MiniDuke’s stage 3 [[2] ]samples, making this the\nfirst occasion in which we’ve seen other malware using\nthis particular loader.\n\nThe parallel usage of the loader in the CosmicDuke and\nMiniDuke families is interesting. The oldest samples we\nhave of this loader that loads Cosmu malware show the\ncompilation date of the loader as March 24 2011, which\npredates the oldest publicly documented MiniDuke\nsample (with a recorded loader compilation date of\nJune 18 2012). The earlier use of the loader with a Cosmu\npayload leads us to suspect the existence of a link\nbetween the author(s) of Cosmu and MiniDuke.\n\nThe most common compilation date seen for the loaders\nthat load the Cosmu malware is November 13 2012.\nPerhaps coincidentally, we found one MiniDuke sample\n(originally reported by CrySys [[3]]) that also shows the same\ncompilation date. In this case however, the MiniDuke\ncomponent is actually a downloader; it connects to an\nIP address in Turkey, and when it receives a response,\ndecrypts and executes it.\n\nAlso of interest is that once the MiniDuke loader was\nupdated, we saw CosmicDuke samples take the updated\nloader into use in mid-April 1 2014, a few months after\nMiniDuke started using the latest loader in mid-December\n2013. It seems possible that the actors behind the two\nmalware families share code and/or tools.\n\n1.

The technical description of the\ninfo-stealer is based on analysis of the following sample:\n\nSHA1: b072577447cdf3936d95e612057e510dd3435963.\n\n###### PERSISTENCE\n\nCosmu has a couple of different mechanisms for achieving\npersistence on the system. It creates a scheduled task and\ninstalls a Windows service.\n\nThe scheduled task is typically named “Watchmon\nService”. It executes the malware at system startup.\n\nThe service typically has name javamtsup, and the display\nname is ”Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service”. The\nsize of the service binary on disk varies, but typically the\nreal size is 5120 bytes (based on PE headers) and the SHA1\nvalue is 7803f160af428bcfb4b9ea2aba07886f232cde4e.\n\nThe service itself is very straightforward: it opens a handle\nto explorer.exe process, duplicates its process token,\nreads the path of the actual malware binary from registry\n(key HKLM\\Software\\JavaSoft, value Supplement) and\nstarts the malware using the duplicated process token.\n\nCosmu copies itself with a couple of different filenames\nto %WINDIR%\\system32. The binaries on the disk have a\nvariable length of zero-padding but they are all essentially\ncopies of the original malware binary.\n\nThe filenames for both the Cosmu copies and the service\nbinary are generated by randomly taking two items from\nthe following list and concatenating them, resulting in\nfilenames like usbmon.exe, urllsa.exe, and rasdns.exe:\n\n\n###### 7\n\n PASSWORD STEALING\n\nThe malware targets the following software:\n\nyy Instant messaging\n\n� Skype\nThe malware steals Skype login MD5. The attacker\ncan obtain victim’s Skype username and password\nby using a bruteforce or dictionary attack to crack\nthe MD5. The attack was publicly documented in\n2006 [[4]].\n\n� Google Talk\nCosmu decrypts and steals saved credentials from\nGoogle Talk.\n\n� MSN Messenger\nCosmu decrypts and steals saved credentials from\nMSN Messenger.\n\nyy Browsers\n\n� Google Chrome\nCosmu steals saved credentials from Google\nChrome.\n\n� Internet Explorer\nCosmu steals autocomplete passwords from IE.

The malware uses the password\n“saribas” to encrypt the exported data.\n\n###### TARGETED FILETYPES\n\nCosmu searches the hard drives and network drives for\nfiles that match any of the below patterns:\n\n\nyy *.doc\nyy *.xps\nyy *.xls\nyy *.ppt\nyy *.pps\nyy *.wps\nyy *.wpd\nyy *.ods\nyy *.odt\nyy *.lwp\nyy *.jtd\n\n\nyy *.pdf\nyy *.zip\nyy *.rar\nyy *.docx\nyy *.url\nyy *.xlsx\nyy *.pptx\nyy *.ppsx\nyy *.pst\nyy *.ost\nyy *psw*\n\n\nyy *pass*\nyy *login*\nyy *admin*\nyy *sifr*\nyy *sifer*\nyy *vpn\nyy *.jpg\nyy *.txt\nyy *.lnk\n\n\nPatterns *sifr* and *sifer* are interesting because they\nclearly target non-English filenames, given that ‘sifr’ is the\nArabic word for zero (and interestingly enough, also the\nbase word for an encryption cipher in many languages).\n\nCosmu searches removable drives for a broader set of files\n– only files whose filename matches any of the following\npatterns are skipped/ignored:\n\nyy *.exe\nyy *.ndb\nyy *.mp3\nyy *.avi\n\nAn interesting detail is that Cosmu skips searching the\nremovable drive if the volume name is “trandescend”\n(case insensitive comparison).\n\n5. Microsoft Developer Network; 2.5 LZNT1 Algorithm Details;\n\n\n###### KEY LOGGER\n\nThe keylogger is implemented using the\nGetKeyboardState API. Key logging is skipped if one of the\nfollowing AV process is running on the system:\n\nyy avp.exe\nyy acs.exe\nyy outpost.exe\nyy mcvsescn.exe\nyy mcods.exe\nyy navapsvc.exe\nyy kav.exe\nyy AvastSvc.exe\nyy AvastUi.exe\nyy nod32krn.exe\nyy nod32.exe\nyy ekern.exe\nyy dwengine.exe\nyy MsMpEng.exe\nyy msseces.exe\nyy ekrn.exe\nyy savservice.exe\nyy scfservice.exe\nyy savadminservice.exe\n\n###### SCREENSHOTTER\n\nCosmu takes screenshots periodically and sends them to\nthe attacker, together with other stolen data.\n\n###### CLIPBOARD STEALER\n\nCosmu copies the content of the clipboard every 30\nseconds and sends those to the attacker together with\nother stolen data.\n\n###### CONFIGURATION\n\nThe configuration can contain the following information:\n\nyy HTTP server IPs and URL paths\nyy FTP server IPs, usernames and passwords\nyy WebDav IPs, usernames and passwords\nyy Filename prefix and file extension for downloaded files\nyy Filename prefix and file extension for exfiltrated data\n\nIn all the configurations we have seen, the servers are\nspecified using IP addresses, not domain names.\n\nThe configuration is embedded into the info-stealer. It is\ncompressed using an algorithm similar to but simpler than\nLZNT-1 [[5]].\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThe sample makes HTTP GET requests to the server(s)\nspecified in the configuration. The GET request contains\nthe following fields in this order:\n\nyy m or mgn\nyy Auth\nyy Session\nyy DataID\nyy FamilyID\nyy BranchID\nyy VolumeID\nyy User\nyy Query.\n\nThe first field, m or mgn, does not have any value.\n\nThe value of Auth is the ID of the sample. It is the same\n8-character hex digit that can be found in the PDB path,\namong other places.\n\nThe value of Query depends on the request. It is either\nencoded using URL safe base64, or then the value is\na 1792-character string. That string is composed of a\n256-character string that is repeated seven times.\n\nThe 256-character string is generated by selecting\ncharacters randomly from the following 32-character\nalphabet:\n\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\n\nThe malware uses the FTP servers and WebDav servers\nboth for exfiltrating the collected data and for updating\nthe malware.\n\nAll servers used by the info-stealers listed in “Appendix A |\nSamples” are listed in “Appendix B | Servers”.\n\n###### RC4 ENCRYPTION\n\nCosmu uses RC4 to decrypt incoming data and encrypt\noutgoing data. The RC4 routine is not standard RC4, but\ninstead of an intentional customization it seems that the\nimplementation is simply buggy. The mistake is illustrated\nin Figure 5 that shows a Python re-implementation of the\nbuggy RC4.\n\nAll RC4 keys are 32 bytes. Here are the known keys:\n\nyy pHG5AS4deKLil9ADdR2BcA1hTNm0FQz3\nyy 3Pf4GxTaDnx50qWe2Xz62uSptFsR3g3P\nyy AdjustKernelTableFromSSDTSpace2\\x00\nyy FB7V61C7509E4L99BDZ7F74A79A69CDF\n\nEven though only the first 32 bytes are used as the RC4\nkey, the first two RC4 keys in the above list are followed by\n\n\n###### 9\n\n FIGURE 5: PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE  BUGGY RC4 ENCRYPTION\n\nan interesting string:\n\nAtruefriendissomeonewhothinksthatyouareagoodegg\neventhoughheknowsthatyouareslightlycrackedgroove\n\n“A true friend is someone who thinks that you are a good\negg even though he knows that you are slightly cracked”\nis a Bernard Meltzer quote.\n\n###### SAMPLES COMPARISON\n\nA comparison of the compilation times of the\nsamples, and of other similarities observed in the file\ncharacteristics, reveals some interesting patterns. For\nmore details, see “Appendix A | Samples”.\n\n###### LEGACY CREDENTIALS AND FTP FOLDER STRUCTURE\n\nThe oldest Cosmu samples we saw have a compilation\ntimestamp of 2001-09-25. Since it is possible for the\ncompilation timestamp to be manipulated, it may be that\nthe samples are not that old. We have however not seen\nany samples that would give us reason to suspect that the\ntimestamp has been tampered with.\n\nThese old samples do not use the MiniDuke loader and\ntherefore are not discussed in detail in this analysis. They\ndo however show some characteristics that link them\nto these fresh variants. For example, the credentials and\nsame FTP folder structure used by the old samples have\nbeen used on another Cosmu FTP server that is still active.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 10\n\n\n###### FIGURE 6: TIMELINE OF COMPILATION TIMESTAMPS & FILENAMES  FOR COSMICDUKE’S DROPPERS, LOADERS & INFO-STEALERS\n\n\n###### Loaders Info-stealers\n\n\n###### 2014\n\n\n###### Droppers\n\n\n9700c8a41a929449cfba6567a648e9c5e\n\n###### Nov 13 *.tmp\n\n4e3c9d7eb8302739e6931a3b5b605efe8f211e51\n55f83ff166ab8978d6ce38e80fde858cf29e660b\n6db1151eeb4339fc72d6d094e2d6c2572de89470\ned14da9b9075bd3281967033c90886fd7d4f14e5\n\nGenerated with an algorithm\n580eca9e36dcd1a2deb9075bcae90afee46aace2\n6a43ada6a3741892b56b0ef38cdf48df1ace236d\n8aa9f5d426428ec360229f4cb9f722388f0e535c\n\n*.tmp or generated with an algorithm\n5c5ec0b5112a74a95edc23ef093792eb3698320e\n\nSivil Durum Raporu Kriz Merkexe.yazi.pdf\nccb29875222527af4e58b9dd8994c3c7ef617fd8\n\n[Unknown]\nb54b3c67f1827dab4cc2b3de94ff0af4e5db3d4c\n\n\n###### Jul 27 [Unknown] \n\n764add69922342b8c4200d64652fbee1376adf1c\n\n\n###### Dec 4 *.tmp\n\n9700c8a41a929449cfba6567a648e9c5e 4fc6701a621f2a5ce3451c7969e4361bc3b836eb\n\n\n###### Feb 7 853679ae3172e448d676cbc9503f1474a5ca656f\n\n\n###### Feb 27 fb3b8f6494b211386381a7e4f6524d3e4643c9e9\n\n\n##### 2013\n\n###### Sep 3  2c7c9ceeb61eac89e18b6e4ae0c855d982a0f232\n\n\n###### Mar 3  b072577447cdf3936d95e612057e510dd3435963\n\n\n###### Mar 6  3e76dfa82161c64417e214b7607ad22ab40a8d69\n\n\n###### Jun 13 f9ba115b673be04ac09c9ee497ef03c5aa75429e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 11\n\n\n**RUSSIA**\n\n**ROMANIA**\n\n188.241.115.41\n\n**CZECH REPUBLIC**\n\n176.74.216.14\n\n**SWEDEN**\n\n46.246.120.178\n\nLIVE IN JUNE 2014\n\nDOWN IN JUNE 2014\n\n\n**LUXEMBOURG**\n94.242.199.88\n\n**GREECE**\n178.21.172.157\n\n###### GROUP #3\n\nRC4 KEYS:\nPHG5AS4DEKLIL9ADD\nR2BCA1HTNM0FQZ3\n\n3PF4GXTADNX50QW\nE2XZ62USPTFSR3G3P\nDELIVERY:\n?\n\nPBD PATH CONTAINS:\n“KSK” (LATEST SAMPLES)\n\n**POLAND**\n188.116.32.164\n\n###### COMPILATION TIMELINE\n\n\n###### FIGURE 7: INFO-STEALER GROUPS & C&C SERVERS USED PER GROUP\n\n**NETHERLANDS**\n91.224.141.235\n\n###### GROUP #1\n\nRC4 KEY:\nFB7V61C7509E4L99\nBDZ7F74A79A69CDF\nDELIVERY:\n3 DROPPERS, NO EXPLOITS 195.43.94.104\n\nPBD PATH CONTAINS:\n“BOTGENSTUDIO”\n\n###### GROUP #2\n\nRC4 KEY:\nADJUSTKERNELTABLE\n\n**UNITED STATES** FROMSSDTSPACE2\\X00\n199.231.188.109\n\nDELIVERY:\nDROPPERS, EXPLOITS\n\nPBD PATH CONTAINS:\n“NITRO” AND “SVA”\n\n**UNITED KINGDOM**\n95.154.228.106\n\n**GERMANY**\n178.63.149.142\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|GROUP #3 RC4 KEYS: PHG5AS4DEKLIL9ADD R2BCA1HTNM0FQZ3 3PF4GXTADNX50QW E2XZ62USPTFSR3G3P DELIVERY: ?

The\nmajority of the loaders were compiled on 2012-1113, though one was compiled on 2012-12-04 - oddly\nenough, the same day when one MiniDuke payload\nreported by BitDefender [[6] ]and Kaspersky [[7]], (md5:\n6bc34809e44c40b61dd29e0a387ee682) was compiled.\nThis was a downloader that connects to an IP address in\nTurkey. As the server is no longer up however, we were\nunable to investigate it further.\n\nThe compilation timestamps of the info-stealers show\nmore variation. The oldest variant loaded with the\nMiniDuke loader was compiled on 2012-12-04. Most of the\ninfo-stealers were compiled in February and March 2014.\n\n\n###### INFO-STEALER GROUPING\n\nThe info-stealer samples we have analyzed can be also\nbe separated into three distinct groupings based on the\nfollowing attributes:\n\nyy The program database (PDB) path\nyy Server address and credentials\nyy The loader\nyy Filenames and decoy content\n\nFull list of the servers contacted by samples in these\ngroupings in available in Appendix B | Servers on page 15.\n\nGroup #1\n\nAll samples in this group have a PDB path on the\ninfected system’s C:\\ drive that contains the directory\n“botgenstudio”.\n\n\n6.

The IP address of the servers used by this\ngroup of samples are in Luxembourg, Netherlands, and\nRussia. See “Appendix B | Servers” for details.\n\nWe have seen three different droppers for this sample\ngroup. All droppers use the RLO trick.\n\nWe have not found any exploits associated to this group of\nsamples.\n\nGroup #2\n\nAll samples in this group have a PDB path that contains\ndirectories named “NITRO” and “SVA”. The PDB path is\nalways on D:\\ drive. Here are some examples:\n\nyy D:\\production\\nitro\\sva\\generations\\809113dd\\bin\\\nBot.pdb\nyy D:\\SVA\\NITRO\\PRODUCTION\\Generations\\805B1D01\\\nbin\\bot.pdb\nyy D:\\PRODUCTION\\NITRO\\SVA\\Generations\\8052B6C0\\\nbin\\Bot.pdb\nyy D:\\PRODUCTION\\NITRO\\SVA\\Generations\\80B8A0BA\\\nbin\\bot.pdb\n\nAll samples except one in this group use PDF files with\nexploits as an infection vector. The sole exception is\nsha1:98f81b03a3b0f7b0b914d783683817953e8d4cf0. It\ndoes not use an exploit and it does not use a dropper;\ninstead the loader has a filename (Sivil Durum Raporu Kriz\nMerk?fdp.izay.exe) that uses the same RLO trick used in\nGroup #1 samples.\n\nAnother interesting detail for this sample is the PDB path:\n\nd:\\sva\\nitro\\botgenstudio\\interface\\\ngenerations\\80ddfcc1\\bin\\Bot.pdb\n\nEven though this contains both “SVA” and “NITRO”, it\nalso contains “botgenstudio”, again making it similar\nto Group #1. One other sample in Group #2 (sha1:\nfb3b8f6494b211386381a7e4f6524d3e4643c9e9) shows a\nsimilar PDB path.\n\nThe servers used by this group are exclusive to this group,\ni.e., the other sample groups do not use any of the servers\ngroup #2 uses.\n\n\nGroup #3\n\nThe most recent CosmicDuke samples all belong to this\ngroup. Unlike Groups #1 and #2, no exploits or droppers\nare known to be associated with Group #3 samples, and\nthe loader filenames do not use the RLO trick. As such, we\nwill not cover Group #3’s delivery method further.\n\nOf more interest with Group #3 is that older samples\nwithin this groupin show some differences from the\nlatest variants. A few older samples in Group #3 still use\nthe original MiniDuke loader, while most recent ones are\nusing the updated MiniDuke loader.\n\nAnother difference is that unlike the older ones, the latest\nsamples use the following PDB path:\n\nyy D:\\PRODUCTION\\NITRO\\KSK\\Generations\\70BCDEA1\\\nbin\\Bot.pdb.\n\nThis is quite similar to Group #2, though it seems “SVA” has\nbeen replaced by “KSK”.\n\nAll samples in Group #3 connect to an FTP server at IP\n188.116.32.164 using the same username (“adair”) and\npassword. This is the only server that the samples with the\noriginal MiniDuke loader use.\n\nMeanwhile, the most recent sample in Group #3,\nwhich uses the updated loader with t the SHA1 value\nfecdba1d903a51499a3953b4df1d850fbd5438bd, also\nconnects to another server at IP address 178.21.172.157.\nThe updated loader has PDB path, C:\\Projects\\NEMESIS\\\nnemesis-gemina\\nemesis\\bin\\carriers\\ezlzma_x86_exe.\npdb.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 13\n\n\n### APPENDIX A | SAMPLES\n\nExploit files\n\nFirst seen Filename SHA1
