Commonly referred to as tracking pixels, web bugs embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the body of an email\nthat, when enabled, will attempt to retrieve a benign image file from an actor-controlled server. This provides a “sign of life” to threat actors\nand indicates that the targeted account is valid with the user being inclined to open emails that utilize social engineering content. TA416\nhas been using web bugs to target victims prior to delivering malicious URLs that have installed a variety of PlugX malware payloads. The\noperational tempo of these campaigns, specifically those against European governments, have increased sharply since Russian troops\nbegan amassing on the border of Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of the web bug reconnaissance technique suggests TA416 is being more discerning about which targets the group chooses to\ndeliver malware payloads. Historically, the group primarily delivered web bug URLs alongside malware URLs to confirm receipt. In 2022,\nthe group started to first profile users and then deliver malware URLs. This may be an attempt by TA416 to avoid having their malicious\ntools discovered and publicly disclosed. By narrowing the lens of targeting from broad phishing campaigns to focus on targets that have\nproven to be active and willing to open emails, TA416 increases its chance of success when following up with malicious malware\npayloads.\n\n## What’s In a Web Bug – Delivery in 2020 and 2021\n\nStarting in early November 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified web bug reconnaissance campaigns targeting European diplomatic\nentities. Notably this activity aligned with the escalation of tensions between Russia, Ukraine, and, by extension, NATO member states in\nEurope. The emails first originated from a spoofed sender that impersonated a Meetings Services Assistant at the United Nations General\nAssembly Secretariat. Proofpoint did not observe these campaigns targeting the United Nations (UN), but did observe the targeting of\ndiplomatic entities in Europe under the pretense of communicating with the UN. The threat actor achieved this impersonation by utilizing\nthe legitimate email marketing service SMTP2Go, which allows users to alter the envelope sender field while using a unique sender\naddress generated by the service.\n\nTA416 has used SMTP2Go to impersonate various European diplomatic organizations since at least 2020. The threat actor in an August\n2020 campaign impersonated the same Meetings Services Assistant at the UN General Assembly and again targeted governmental\nentities in Europe. In this historical campaign, TA416 delivered a DropBox URL that delivered a PlugX variant aligning with Recorded\nFuture’s [analysis of \"Red Delta\" PlugX malware. Proofpoint assesses that there is sizeable overlap between the entities TA416 and the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations/)\npublicly disclosed group “Red Delta.” Both campaigns from August 2020 and November 2021 targeted European diplomatic entities and\nutilized SMTP2Go to impersonate an external diplomatic organization that may communicate with the end targets. Included below is a\npublicly available malicious Zip file hash from August 2020 delivered via a DropBox URL which is attributable to TA416/Red Delta.\n\nAdvance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace .zip |\n0e3e47697539f1773fb53114ab53229c0304d86ed35aec05e5f5bfdf3bd35f9a\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1.

Fundamentally, a web bug URL includes infrastructure that hosts a benign image file, several\ndesignations about the email campaign, which can include date and campaign name, and a unique designation for each individual user\ntargeted in the email campaign. This allows a threat actor to validate which recipients received and opened the phishing email. TA416\nweb bugs appear rudimentary while demonstrating slight evolution over time. The web bug URL structure began with an actor-controlled\nIP which retrieved jpg resources named after the email aliases of the targeted victims from the actor-controlled servers. Proofpoint\nresearchers next observed base64 encoded values of the entire email address.\n\nExample:\n\nhxxp://45.154.14[.]235/jdoe.jpg\nhxxp://45.154.14[.]235/amRvZUBwcm9vZnBvaW50LmNvbQ==/328.jpg\n\nResearchers identified the same method of base64 encoded target emails, including in the web bug URL, consistently from August to\nNovember 2020 in TA416 campaigns that preceded the delivery of PlugX malware. On more than one occasion in 2020, this web bug\ntechnique appeared in an email alongside a Dropbox URL that ultimately delivered the Trident Loader variant of PlugX\nmalware. [Proofpoint,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta416-goes-ground-and-returns-golang-plugx-malware-loader) [Avira, and](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong) [Recorded Future have publicly attributed this installation technique to TA416/Red Delta. In the above](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nreferenced campaign from August 2020 in which TA416 impersonated UN personnel, the threat actor utilized base64 encoded web bug\nresources representing targeted emails alongside the cloud hosted URLs that delivered PlugX malware. Actor-controlled IPs observed\nduring web bug reconnaissance campaigns during the November to December 2021 period included the IP 45.154.14[.]235.\n\nBeginning on January 17, 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed TA416 threat actors utilizing the IP address 45.154.14[.]235 in phishing\nemails attempting to deliver a malicious Zip file to European Diplomatic entities. These entities had previously received web bug URLs in\nphishing emails during the prior months. Rather than the emails delivering further reconnaissance URLs, this IP now attempted to deliver\nmalicious Zip files. The phishing email also included a Dropbox URL attempting to deliver the same malicious archive file. Like historical\nTA416 campaigns, the Zip file had a geopolitically themed title, which was shared with a PDF decoy that would be later downloaded as\npart of the infection chain. For example, the campaign on January 17, 2022 included the following Zip and PDF file titles:\n\nState_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.zip\nState_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\n_Figure 2. TA416 January 2021 PDF decoy - EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fora in 2022.zip._\n\nWhile historically TA416 has delivered Zip files from cloud hosting providers containing a decoy file, legitimate PE file, a DLL loader, and a\nPlugX malware configuration DAT file, recent campaigns used a different tactic. Proofpoint researchers noted that the malicious Zip files\ndelivered from DropBox now contain a rudimentary executable which is a dropper malware. This malware establishes persistence for a\nlegitimate executable file used in DLL search order hijacking, as well as initiates the download of four components. These components\nare included below and resemble the components used in the past to install PlugX malware. Public research has previously documented\nTA416’s propensity for including PlugX Trident Loader components and decoy in the initial delivered Zip file. Actors in recent months use\na more convoluted delivery chain, in which a PE dropper is used to retrieve the Trident Loader components from an actor-controlled\nresource. The method of installing PlugX via DLL Search Order hijacking that displays a PDF decoy remains constant.\n\nRequests Resulting from the Execution of Malware Dropper Executable\n\nPDF Decoy File\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022- 2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\nLegitimate PotPlayer PE file used in DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.exe\n\nMalicious PlugX Malware Loader\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.dll\n\nPlugX Malware Configuration Executed by DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\n\n-----\n\nMost recently on February 28, 2022, TA416 began using a compromised email address of a diplomat from a European NATO country to\ntarget a different country’s diplomatic offices. The targeted individual worked in refugee and migrant services. The below URL was sent in\na phishing email and delivered a compressed archive containing a PE dropper. This dropper similarly called out to an actor-controlled\nURL to deliver a decoy document and the components of an updated Trident Loader PlugX malware payload.\n\nhxxp://www.zyber-i[.]com/europa/2022.zip\nSituation at the EU borders with Ukraine.zip|8a7fbafe9f3395272548e5aadeb1af07baeb65d7859e7a1560f580455d7b1fac\nSituation at the EU borders with Ukraine.exe|effd63168fc7957baf609f7492cd82579459963f80fc6fc4d261fbc68877f5a1(Stage 1\nDropper)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/2022/eu.docx (Decoy Document)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/FontEDL.exe (PE Legit)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/DocConvDll.dll (DLL Loader)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/FontLog.dat (PlugX Encrypted Payload)\n\n## Communicates with C2\n\nhxxps://92.118.188[.]78/\n\n_Figure 3. TA416 February 28, 2022 Word document decoy – eu.docx._\n\n## A More Discerning Breed of TA416 PlugX Malware\n\nClose analysis of the delivered payloads and legitimate resources retrieved from URLs by the first stage malware dropper reveals that\nTA416 is once again using an updated version of PlugX malware to target their victims. Historically, the group has relied on a variety of\nlegitimate antivirus files, including the Avast file resource wsc_proxy.exe, to begin the process of DLL search order hijacking that results in\nPlugX malware installation. In the January 2022 campaigns, TA416 used the PE file potplayermini.exe to initiate DLL search order\nhijacking. This is a legitimate executable file that is part of the publicly available media player Daum PotPlayer 1.5.29825, which Mandiant\n[has previously documented as being susceptible to search order hijacking since at least 2016. Numerous Chinese APT groups, which are](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/abusing-dll-misconfigurations)\nnot directly correlated to TA416, have utilized it since that time. This campaign leveraged the vulnerability of potplayermini.exe to load the\nfile PotPlayer.dll which contains an obfuscated launcher that in turn executes the file PotPlayerDB.dat. The file DocConvDll.dll has also\nintermittently been used as a loader of the PlugX DAT configuration files. For those that are familiar with TA416’s historic tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs), this is highly similar to the Trident Loader method which the group used to install PlugX in previous\ncampaigns.\n\nWhile PotPlayerDB.dat is a variant of PlugX malware, TA416 has updated the payload by changing both its encoding method and\nexpanding the payload’s configuration capabilities. Historically, TA416 relied on the DLL launcher to decode the PlugX payload utilizing an\nXOR key included at the offset 0 within the PlugX DAT configuration file. In this case, TA416 has abandoned that approach in favor of\nsomething with less dependencies that is more convoluted. The latest version contains obfuscation to thwart analysis. One of the main\nways it does this is by resolving API functions during runtime. Generally, malware loads a DLL, iterates over the set of exports of the DLL\nand hashes the string, looking for a matching hash. This iteration of PlugX does standard API hashing, but only to resolve the address of\nthe functions GetProcAddress as well as LoadLibrary. Once those functions are resolved properly, it loads the rest of the functions via\ntheir text name.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. PlugX malware API hashing method._\n\nIn addition to this obfuscation attempt, most of the functions that contain the \"business logic\" of the malware are obfuscated with a state\nmachine. At a high level this obscures the order of which blocks are executed within a function. It does this by maintaining a state variable\nwith many comparisons in the function. After each block, the state variable is modified to whatever the subsequent block should be,\nmaking analysis more difficult. This sample further implements anti-analysis techniques via the malware’s design. After every iteration of\nthe state machine, the malware sample will modify the state with a XOR operation. This makes it difficult to analyze as the states are not\nhardcoded as the result of a function. This control obfuscation is apparent below with the highly cyclical nature of the control flow graph.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. PlugX malware control flow graph._\n\nOnce researchers defeated the PlugX anti-analysis techniques, they were able to examine the malware’s configuration. Notably the\nconfiguration contained three additional fields that were not present in the previous versions nor in standard PlugX malware. The new\nversion included:\n\nTwo hardcoded dates for latest write time used to filter over files within a specified directory.\nA minimum and maximum file size to filter over files within a specified directory.\nA format string that defaults to “public/Publics” that modifies characteristics of the folder and hide it from the infected user.\n\nIn the past, when fields have been added to PlugX malware configurations they have persisted in future samples identified in subsequent\ncampaigns. Recently, this has not always proven to be true. In recent campaigns, a consistent and clear configuration that is repeated has\nnot been present. The expansion of the malware’s configuration fields demonstrates that this tool is undergoing additional development by\nTA416. Further, the type of added features that enable better filtering of victim files for exfiltration and better concealment from the\ninfected user demonstrates that the actor is going beyond anti-analysis to create a more functional and precise tool to use during\nintrusions. It also indicates the varying versions of the PlugX payload that are being used in a short period of time.\n\n## Command and Control\n\nThe January 2022 version of PlugX malware utilizes RC4 encryption along with a hardcoded key that is built dynamically. For\ncommunications, the data is compressed then encrypted before sending to the command and control (C2) server and the same process\nin reverse is implemented for data received from the C2 server. Below shows the RC4 key \"sV!e@T#L$PH%\" as it is being passed along\nwith the encrypted data. The data is compressed and decompressed via LZNT1 and RtlDecompressBuffer. During the January 2022\ncampaigns, the delivered PlugX malware samples communicated with the C2 server 92.118.188[.]78 over port 187. In the February 2022\ncampaign, Proofpoint researchers observed a variation in which PlugX malware used an RC4 key that was sent to the bot in the first\nHTTP response which was then used to encrypt data going to the C2 server.\n\n_Figure 6. PlugX malware RC4 encryption key with encrypted data._\n\n**A Rapid Pace of Malware Development**\n\nIn response to historical disclosures detailing TA416 PlugX malware infection and encoding methods, the group appears to have adopted\na rapid rate of development for their PlugX payloads. While the distinctly TA416 installation method of a PE dropper retrieving Trident\nloaded payload components using a legitimate PE and a DLL loader file to load a PlugX payload remains constant, the components in\nthis infection chain are regularly changing. The group uses different legitimate PE files to initiate sideloading, as well as a variety of PlugX\nDLL loaders including the PotPlayer and DocCon versions noted in this publication. TA416 also uses different variants of the final PlugX\n\n\n-----\n\npayload in which the communication routines are observed to be different when closely analyzed. Additionally, the payload DAT file\ndecryption method has evolved regularly since the beginning of 2022. Several observed decryption schemas and a sample configuration\nare included below with date ranges detailing the evolution of observed PlugX payloads.\n\n_Figure 7. 2020 - 2022 PlugX DAT file decryption._\n\n_Figure 8.

PlugX malware configuration sample._\n\n## Attribution\n\nProofpoint researchers assess with high confidence that the operator identified in recent campaigns delivering PlugX malware is the same\nas previously identified in 2020 as part of Recorded Future's Red Delta campaign. This assessment is based on the use of the same\nemail marketing service to deliver emails, the consistent impersonation of European diplomatic entities, the repetition of web bug patterns\nin the 2020, 2021, and 2022 campaigns, the consistent victimology observed between the campaigns, a nearly identical file naming\nstructure observed between Zip and PDF decoy files, and the highly similar Trident Loader TTPs used for the execution of PlugX\nmalware.\n\n\n**Tactic** **2020**\n\n**TA416 Campaigns**\n\n**Spoofing Via SMPT2Go**\n\n**Impersonation of UN Personnel**\n\n**Rudimentary Base64 Web Bugs**\n\n**Trident Loaded PlugX**\n\n\n**2021 – 2022**\n\n**TA416 Campaigns**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Politically Themed PDF Decoys**\n\n**Shared Zip and PDF Decoy File Names**\n\n**Targeted European Diplomatic Entities**\n\n_Figure 11. Mapping TA416 TTPs over time._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe multiyear campaign against diplomatic entities in Europe suggests a consistent area of responsibility belonging to TA416. This\nmandate may have increased against entities in Europe during the current period of geopolitical conflict and economic upheaval in\nEurope. While historically the phishing tactics and tools of this group have not been so thoroughly explored, the consistent reliance on\nupdating PlugX malware installation using the Trident Loader method belies a lack of innovation on the part of TA416 following several\nmajor publications surrounding this actor. TA416 has chosen to compensate for this lack of innovation with a greater tempo of variation.\nThe group has proved to be pragmatic, making incremental and staggered changes to their PlugX toolkit rapidly and regularly altering a\ntoolset it has used for the past number of years. Despite these variations, the group’s persistent targeting of a habitual target set paired\nwith ingrained phishing tactics often leads to periodic discovery by threat researchers. Once TA416 reads this latest publication regarding\ntheir tactics, researchers at Proofpoint fully anticipate they will remain the metaphorical “Tubthumping” of the APT landscape.\nResearchers can publish their tactics but will never keep them down.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**IOC**\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.zip\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.zip?dl=1\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fora in 2022.zip/?dl=1\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities%20in%20UN%20human%20rights%20fora%20in%\ndl=1\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities%20in%20UN%20human%20rights%20fora%20in%20\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fora in 2022.zip\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fora in 2022.zip/?dl=1\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities%20in%20UN%20human%20rights%20fora%20in%\ndl=1\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities%20in%20UN%20human%20rights%20fora%20in%20\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fora in 2022.zip\n\nhttps://upespr[.]com/Council conclusions on the European security situation.zip\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/mfa/Council%20conclusions%20on%20the%20European%20security%20situation.pdf\n\nhxxp://www.zyber-i[.]com/europa/2022.zip\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/2023.rar\n\nCouncil conclusions on the European security situation.exe 6fd9d745faa77a58ac84a5a1ef360c7fc1e23b32d49ca9c3554a1ed\n\n\nState_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.exe\n\n\n5851043b2c040fb3dce45c23fb9f3e8aefff48e0438dec7141999062\n\n\nSituation at the EU borders with Ukraine.exe effd63168fc7957baf609f7492cd82579459963f80fc6fc4d261fbc688\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE\nCOUNCIL.exe\n\nAdvance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on\nPeacebuilding and Sustaining Peace.pdf\n\n\nb2ff5535caa1d70c9d0d59cd68619b142858ae018064c891b46711\n\n54b491541376bda85ffb02b9bb40b9b5adba644f08b630fc1b47392\n\n\nCouncil conclusions on the European security situation.pdf a4ff2c5913cce536759777acee3cfcc8824b927304c8a93ac64d37d\n\nSituation at the EU borders with Ukraine.docx a07cece1fa9b3c813c0b6880b24a6494a9db83e138102da3bce30e\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE\nCOUNCIL.pdf\n\nState_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\n\n0c2f5b6fe538d088fed11ab10925210cb2eb782f471e6f09c484677e\n\nec32ff0c049bd8812a35aeaaaae1f66eaf0ce8aefce535d142862ae8\n\n\nPotPlayer.exe 76da9d0046fe76fc28b80c4c1062b17852264348fd873b7dd781f39\n\nFontEDL.exe 19870dd4d8c6453d5bb6f3b2beccbbbe28c6f280b6a7ebf5e0785ec\n\nPotPlayer.dll e1dbe58393268d7ddabd4bed0cdedf0fbba85d4c3ef1300580ed4c7\n\nDocConvDll.dll 436d5bf9eba974a6e97f6f5159456c642e53213d7e4f8c75db5275b\n\nDocConvDll.dll a01f353c92afcd45b5731815c79f1e1d01366cefa75b41550a28d99\n\n\n-----\n\nPotPlayer.dll 472822c6bdc710175987eb7d9171f780c974a83ea2b26f117b748b\n\nPotPlayerDB.dat fac8de00f031299f6c698b34534d6523428b544aad6a40fdc4b000a\n\nFontLog.dat 82df9817d0a8dca7491b0688397299943d9279e848cdc4a5446d3\n\nFontLog.dat b9e330373b382beaf4f0bcce83d65f13399d42dc3e9fcdc7b4ef26fa\n\nPotPlayerDB.dat 03a836034360841fd6b99927c5b639d074e9fce4f16bd4f77ab57a9\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/2023/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/2023/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/2023/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/2022/eu.docx\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/FontEDL.exe\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/DocConvDll.dll\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/FontLog.dat\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/2022.pdf\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/FontEDL.exe\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/DocConvDll.dll\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/FontLog.dat\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\n103.107.104[.]19\n\n69.90.184[.]125\n\n45.154.14[.]235\n\nupespr[.]com\n\nwww.zyber-i[.]com\n\nhxxps://92.118.188[.]78\n\n**Emerging Threats Signatures**\n\n\n-----\n\n2851112     ETPRO TROJAN ta416 Related PlugX Activity (POST)\n\n\n-----",
