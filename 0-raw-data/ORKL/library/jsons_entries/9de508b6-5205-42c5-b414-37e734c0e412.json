However, you should be\nextra careful of bogus security software, especially if it tries to use the coronavirus as a\nselling point.\n\n## Corona antivirus: 100% fake\n\nThe latest scam we found is a website (antivirus-covid19[.]site) advertising “Corona Antivirus\n-World’s best protection.” That’s right, scammers are trying to get you to install a digital\nantivirus that supposedly protects against the actual COVID-19 virus infecting people across\nthe world.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo add to the nonsense, the site goes on by adding:\n\nOur scientists from Harvard University have been working on a special AI development\nto combat the virus using a windows app. Your PC actively protects you against the\nCoronaviruses (Cov) while the app is running.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infected victims added to BlackNET RAT\n\nUpon installing this application, your computer will be infected with malware. The file, packed\nwith the commercial packer Themida turns your PC into a bot ready to receive commands:\n```\nhxxps[://]instaboom-hello[.]site//connection[.]php?data=[removed]\nhxxps[://]instaboom-hello[.]site//getCommand[.]php?[removed]\nhxxps[://]instaboom-hello[.]site//receive[.]php?command=[removed]\n\n```\nThe command and control server hosted at instaboom-hello[.]site reveals the control panel\nfor the BlackNET botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The full source code for this toolkit was published on GitHub a month ago. Some of its](https://github.com/BlackHacker511/BlackNET)\nfeatures include:\n\nDeploying DDOS attacks\nTaking screenshots\nStealing Firefox cookies\nStealing saved passwords\nImplementing a keylogger\nExecuting scripts\nStealing Bitcoin wallets\n\n\n-----\n\n## Choose the right protection\n\nDuring this period, it is important to stay safe both at home and online. The number of scams\nwe have seen during these past few weeks shows that criminals will take advantage of any\nsituation, no matter how dire it is.\n\nWe recommend that you keep your computer up to date and use extra caution when\ndownloading new programs. Beware of instant notifications and other messages, even if they\nappear to come from friends.\n\nMalwarebytes users were already protected even though we had not seen this malware\nsample before, thanks to our Machine learning engine.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also informed CloudFlare since the threat actors were abusing their service and they\ntook immediate action to flag this website as a phish.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\nMalicious site\n```\nantivirus-covid19[.]site\n\n```\nBogus corona antivirus\n```\nantivirus-covid19[.]site/update.exe\n146dd15ab549f6a0691c3a728602ce283825b361aa825521252c94e4a8bd94b4\n\n```\nC2 panel\n```\ninstaboom-hello[.]site\n\n```\n\n-----",
