APT 32, APT-C-00,](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/06/unit42-new-improved-macos-backdoor-oceanlotus/)\n[SeaLotus, and Cobalt Kitty). OceanLotus was responsible for launching targeted attacks](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2017/11/06/oceanlotus-blossoms-mass-digital-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-asean-nations-the-media-human-rights-and-civil-society/)\nagainst human rights organizations, media organizations, research institutes, and maritime\nconstruction firms. The attackers behind OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D target MacOS computers\nwhich have the Perl programming language installed.\n\nThe MacOS backdoor was found in a malicious Word document presumably distributed via\nemail. The document bears the filename “2018-PHIẾU GHI DANH THAM DỰ TĨNH HỘI\n_HMDC 2018.doc,” which translates to “2018-REGISTRATION FORM OF HMDC ASSEMBLY_\n_[2018.doc.” The document claims to be a registration form for an event with HDMC, an](https://changevietnam.wordpress.com/2017/06/23/hmdc-thong-cao-bao-chi/)_\norganization in Vietnam that advertises national independence and democracy.\n\nFigure 1. Graphic used by the malicious document\n\nUpon receiving the malicious document, the user is advised to enable macros. In our\nanalysis, the macro is obfuscated, character by character, using the decimal ASCII code.\nThis is shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Code snippet of the obfuscated document\n\nAfter deobfuscation, we can see that the payload is written in the Perl programming\nlanguage. It extracts theme0.xml file from the Word document. theme0.xml is a Mach-O 32bit executable with a 0xFEEDFACE signature that is also the dropper of the backdoor, which\nis the final payload. theme0.xml is extracted to /tmp/system/word/theme/syslogd before it’s\nexecuted.\n\n[Figure 3](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_3_deobfuscated_payload.jpg)\n\nFigure 3. Deobfuscated Perl payload from the delivery document\n\n**Dropper analysis**\n\nThe dropper is used to install the backdoor into the infected system and establish its\npersistence.\n\n[Figure 4](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_4_main_function_dropper.jpg)\n\nFigure 4. The main function of the dropper\n\nAll strings within the dropper, as well as the backdoor, are encrypted using a hardcoded\nRSA256 key. There are two forms of encrypted strings: an RSA256-encrypted string, and\ncustom base64-encoded and RSA256-encrypted string.\n\n[Figure 5](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_5_hardcoded_rsa_key.jpg)\n\nFigure 5. Hardcoded RSA256 key showing the first 20 characters\n\nUsing the setStartup() method, the dropper first checks if it is running as a root or not. Based\non that, the GET_PROCESSPATH and GET_PROCESSNAME methods will decrypt the\nhardcoded path and filename where the backdoor should be installed. The locations:\n\n**_For root user_**\n\npath: /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP_DAL/iOSScreenCapture.plugin/Contents/Resources/_\nprocessname: screenassistantd\n\n**_For regular user_**\n\npath: ~/Library/Spelling/\nprocessname: spellagentd\n\nSubsequently, it implements the Loader::installLoader method, reading the hardcoded 64-bit\nMach-O executable (magic value 0xFEEDFACF), and writing to the previously determined\npath and file.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 6](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_6_dropper_installing_backdoor.jpg)\n\nFigure 6. The dropper installs the backdoor, sets its attributes to “hidden”, and sets a random\nfile date and time\n\nWhen the dropper installs the backdoor, it sets its attributes to “hidden” and sets file date and\n[time to random values using the touch command: touch –t YYMMDDMM “/path/filename” >](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/touch.1.asp)\n/dev/null. The access permissions will then be changed to 0x1ed = 755, which is equal to\nu=rwx,go=rx.\n\n[Figure 7](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_7_magic_value.jpg)\n\nFigure 7. The magic value 0xFEEDFACF that belongs to Mach-O Executable (64 bit)\n\n_Methods GET_LAUNCHNAME and GET_LABELNAME will return the hardcoded name of_\nthe property list “.plist” for the root user (com.apple.screen.assistantd.plist) and for the\nregular user (com.apple.spell.agent.plist).\n\nAfterwards, the persistence file will be created in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or\n_~/Library/LaunchAgents/ folder. The RunAtLoad key will command launchd to run the_\ndaemon when the operating system starts up, while the KeepAlive key will command\n_launchd to let the process run indefinitely. This persistence file is also set to hidden with a_\nrandomly generated file date and time.\n\n[Figure 8](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_8_property_list.jpg)\n\nFigure 8. Property list with persistence settings\n\n_launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/filename.plist > /dev/nul or launchctl load_\n_~/Library/LaunchAgents/ filename.plist > /dev/nul will then command the operating system to_\nstart the dropped backdoor file at login. The dropper will delete itself at the end of the\nprocess.\n\n**Backdoor analysis**\n\nThe main loop of the backdoor has two main functions, infoClient and runHandle. infoClient\nis reponsible for collecting OS info, submitting this info to its C&C servers (the servers are\nmalicious in nature), and receiving additional C&C communication information. Meanwhile,\n_runHandle is responsible for the backdoor capabilities._\n\n[Figure 9](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_9_backdoor_main_function.jpg)\n\nFigure 9. The main functions of the backdoor\n\n_infoClient fills up the variables in HandlePP class._\n\n[Figure 10](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_10_variable_list.jpg)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. List of variables belonging to the HandlePP class\n\n_clientID is an MD5 hash derived from the environment variables, while strClientID is a_\nhexadecimal representation of clientID. All strings below are encrypted via AES256 and\nbase64 encoding. The HandlePP::getClientID method uses the following environment\nvariables:\n\n[Figure 11](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_11_serial_number.jpg)\n\nFigure 11.

Hardware UUID\n\n[Figure 13](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_13_MAC_address.jpg)\n\nFigure 13.

Randomly generated UUID\n\nFor the initial information packet, the backdoor also collects the following:\n\n[Figure 15](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_15_OS_version.jpg)\n\nFigure 15. OS version\n\nRunning getpwuid ->pw_name, scutil - -get ComputerName, and uname –m will provide the\nfollowing returns respectively:\n\nMac OSX 10.12.\nSystem Administrator\n<owner’s name>'s iMac\nx86_64\n\nAll these data are scrambled and encrypted before sending to the C&C server. The process\nis detailed below:\n\n**_Scrambling_**\n\nClass Parser has several methods, one for each variable type – Parser::inBytes,\n_Parser::inByte, Parser::inString, and Parser::inInt._\n\n[Figure 16](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_16_Parser.jpg)\n\nFigure 16 Parser::inBytes method\n\n\n-----\n\nIf clientID equals the following sequence of bytes B4 B1 47 BC 52 28 28 73 1F 1A 01 6B FA\n72 C0 73, then the scrambled version is computed using the third parameter (0x10), which is\ntreated as a DWORD. Each quadruple of bytes is XOR-ed with it, as shown in example\nbelow.\n\n[Figure 17](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_17_Parser2.jpg)\n\nFigure 17. Parser::inByte method\n\nWhen scrambling one byte, the scrambler first determines if the byte value is odd or even. If\nthe value is odd, it adds the byte, along with one more randomly generated byte, to the array.\nIn the case of an even value, the randomly generated byte is added first, followed by the byte\nbeing added. In the case above, the third parameter is ‘1’ = 0x31, which is an odd number.\nThis means that it adds byte ‘1’ and one randomly generated byte to the final scrambled\narray.\n\n[Figure 18](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_18_Parser3.jpg)\n\nFigure 18. Parser::inString method\n\nWhen scrambling a string, the scrambler generates a 5-byte long sequence. First, it\ngenerates one random byte, followed by three zero bytes, one random byte, and finally, the\nbyte with the length of the string. Let’s say we want to scramble string ‘Mac OSX 10.12.’ Its\nlength is 13 = 0x0d, and the two random bytes are 0xf3 and 0x92. The final 5-byte sequence\nlooks like F3 00 00 00 92 0D. The original string is then XOR’ed with the 5-byte sequence.\n\n[Figure 19](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_19_scrambling.jpg)\n\nFigure 19. Scrambling ‘Mac OSX 10.12’\n\n**_Encryption_**\n\nThe scrambled byte sequence is passed onto the constructor of the class Packet::Packet,\nwhich creates a random AES256 key and encrypts the buffer with this key.\n\n**_Encoding the encryption key_**\n\nIn order for the C&C server to decrypt the encrypted data, the randomly generated AES256\nkey must be included in the packet along with the encrypted data. However, this key is also\nscrambled with operation XOR 0x13 followed by ROL 6 operation applied to each byte.\n\n[Figure 20](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_20_scrambling_AES.jpg)\n\nFigure 20. Function for scrambling AES256 key in the outgoing packet\n\n\n-----\n\nSome screenshots taken during scrambling and encryption process:\n\n[Figure 21](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_21_highlighted_bytes_computer_info.jpg)\n\nFigure 21. The highlighted bytes represent the scrambled computer info\n\n[Figure 22](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_22_random_AES.jpg)\n\nFigure 22.

Screenshot of the final payload to be sent to C&C server. The scrambled AES256\nkey is marked green, while the encrypted computer info is marked red. Other bytes are just\nrandomly generated noise.\n\nWhen the backdoor receives the response from the C&C server, the final payload needs to\nbe decoded again in a similar manner via decryption and scrambling. Packet::getData\ndecrypts the received payload and Converter::outString descrambles the result. The received\ndata from the C&C server include the following information:\n\n_HandlePP::urlRequest (/appleauth/static/cssj/N252394295/widget/auth/app.css)_\n_HandlePP::keyDecrypt_\n_STRINGDATA::BROWSER_SESSION_ID (m_pixel_ratio)_\n_STRINGDATA::RESOURCE_ID_\n\nThese data will be later used in the C&C communication, as shown in the Wireshark\nscreenshot below.\n\n[Figure 26](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_26_C2_communication.jpg)\n\nFigure 26. Communication with the C&C server after the exchange of OS packet info\n\nMeanwhile, the runHandle method of the main backdoor loop will call for the requestServer\nmethod with the following backdoor commands (each command has one byte long code and\nis extracted by Packet::getCommand):\n\n[Figure 27](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/04/Figure_27_GetCommand.jpg)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27.
