The broader Elastic\nSecurity solution delivers endpoint security, SIEM, threat hunting, cloud monitoring, and\nmore.\n\n[Today we are excited to announce the introduction of Elastic Endpoint Security, based on](https://www.endgame.com/endpoint-security)\n[Elastic’s acquisition of Endgame, a pioneer and industry-recognized leader in endpoint](https://www.endgame.com/mitre-attck-coverage)\nthreat prevention, detection, and response based on the MITRE ATT&CK™ matrix. Elastic\n[is combining SIEM and endpoint security into a single solution to enable organizations to](https://www.endgame.com/siem)\nautomatically and flexibly respond to threats in real time, whether in the cloud, on-premises,\nor in hybrid environments. Also announced today, Elastic is eliminating per-endpoint pricing.\n\n“Two key trends in endpoint security — the importance of a strong analytics back-end and\nthe rise of the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a lingua franca — help make the case for\ngreater emphasis on threat hunting and incident response use cases,” said Fernando\nMontenegro, Principal Analyst at 451 Research. “Elastic’s acquisition of Endgame fits well\nwithin these trends, and the combination of SIEM and endpoint security should enable\norganizations to pursue efficiencies around those use cases.”\n\n\n-----\n\nEndgame has been validated by numerous independent testing organizations, including\nNSS Labs, SE Labs, MITRE, and others as having both the strongest preventions and\ndetections available. This was recently illustrated by its performance in the AV\nComparatives Independent Anti-Virus Test, where Endgame demonstrated exceptional\nprotection against real-world threats, preventing 99.7% of malware with no cloud\nconnectivity required.\n\nAdditionally, Elastic Endpoint Security brings one of the strongest sources of endpoint\nsecurity data, raw endpoint event data, and alerts to the Elastic Stack, joining the existing\nlogging, security, APM, and infrastructure event collection. With the average threat dwell\ntime exceeding 100 days, shipping, scaling, and storing data efficiently in Elasticsearch\nmakes searching through all of this disparate security-related data practical, easy, and fast.\nAccordingly, endpoint security is a natural fit for the Elastic Stack to provide prevention\nagainst threats and the fastest detection and response to stop attacks at the earliest stages\npossible.\n\n“Users deserve more from the tools they deploy. That’s why we are providing immediate\nvalue today through the simplicity of a single stack to search, store, analyze,\nand secure your data,” said Shay Banon, founder and chief executive officer of Elastic.\n“This is an exciting step toward realizing our vision for applying search to multiple use\ncases, as we are now able to offer users the best threat hunting solution with the best\nendpoint protection.”\n\n## Our journey into SIEM and endpoint security\n\n\n-----\n\nTools working in isolation can t safeguard an organization, and the data that those tools\ncollect isn’t actionable without a centralized management console. Security teams are faced\nwith siloed data, slow query times, and compromised analysis that lacks relevance and\ncontext. Organizations already know they need to work in real time; they need to ingest and\nstore all types of data in a way that is unbounded; and they need to produce relevant results\nand automatically operationalize them into existing and new security workflows.\n\nNearly two years ago, we embarked on a mission to help organizations evolve their security\nefforts. While the Elastic Stack has been adopted and is used as a security solution for use\ncases like threat hunting, fraud detection, and security monitoring, we wanted to make it\neven easier for users to deploy our products for security. We first worked in collaboration\nwith our community to develop the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) to provide an easy way\nto normalize data from disparate sources from network and host data. Then we launched\n[Elastic SIEM, the world’s first free and open SIEM... but we didn’t stop there.](https://www.endgame.com/siem)\n\nNow, when you deploy a data collection agent for Elastic SIEM, you can protect the\nendpoint simultaneously and remove the inefficiency of multiple solutions that can’t respond\nin time to prevent damage and loss.\n\n“Stopping attacks as early as possible is the goal. That requires the best preventions and\nthe highest fidelity detections on the endpoint. The combination of Endgame’s leading\nendpoint protection technology with Elastic SIEM creates an interactive workspace for\nSecOps and threat hunting teams to stop attacks and protect their organizations,” said Nate\nFick, formerly CEO of Endgame and now general manager of Elastic Security.\n\n## The end of endpoint pricing\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to combining the world’s first free and open SIEM with the best endpoint\nprotection technology, Elastic is eliminating per-endpoint pricing.\n\n“Why should users need to count the number of devices they need to protect? Or choose\nhow many days of threat intelligence data they can afford to retain?” added Banon. “We\nwant organizations to have the best protection, use it everywhere, and not be penalized\nwith per-endpoint pricing.”\n\nElastic customers pay for resource capacity for any solution they use — Elastic Logs, APM,\nSIEM, App Search, Site Search, Enterprise Search, and now Endpoint Security — with a\nconsistent and transparent pricing framework. This ensures organizations can capture\nmaximum value from their data. With Elastic Endpoint Security, customers get full protection\nfor as many endpoints as they need, and full data collection and shipping without having to\ncompromise.\n\n## Security leaders comment on Elastic Endpoint Security\n\n**Texas A&M University, Andrew Stokes, Assistant Director and Information Security**\n**Officer**\n\n“We value speed of response and the ability to learn from and analyze our historical data.\nElastic Endpoint Security has dramatically dropped our mean time to remediate from seven\ndays to 30 minutes over legacy antivirus, and the Elastic Stack has provided an\nunparalleled way to store, analyze, and react to data well beyond any competitor in the\nmarket. Combining Elastic Endpoint Security and the Elastic Stack into a single,\nintelligence-led platform will further simplify and automate our security operations.”\n\n**Optiv, Anthony Diaz, Divisional Vice President, Emerging Services**\n\n\"Elastic is bringing together the integration of a next-generation SIEM, robust visualization\nengine and a best-in-class endpoint product all backed by the world's leading search\ntechnology. This combination provides a foundation for enterprises to combat the growing\ncomplexity of cyber threats. Elastic's vision for bringing together these components in an\nopen ecosystem is a revolutionary, yet practical idea that helps organizations of all sizes\nmaximize all of their data to manage their cyber security needs.\"\n\n**Infotrack, Sebastian Mill, Chief Technology Officer, Global Development**\n\n“At InfoTrack, we’ve come to realize just how valuable endpoint data can be for gaining\nvisibility into our operations and making sure our infrastructure remains secure. Toward\nthese goals, our innovation team has already been scoping Auditbeat into our\nenvironments, but introducing Elastic Endpoint Security takes it to a whole new level. We\n\n\n-----\n\nare intrigued by the ability to stop threats with Elastic Endpoint Security while pairing\nsecurity event data with some Elastic machine learning-powered anomaly detection. It will\nbe a killer setup.\"\n\n**SANS Institute, John Pescatore, Director, Emerging Security Trends**\n\n“When SANS surveyed SOC managers about the tools they wish new SOC hires were\nskilled in the Elastic (ELK) Stack was one of the top ones mentioned. The components of\nthe ELK stack are used both by SOC analysts and application developers. Having strong\nEDR capability integrated into the endpoint side of the standard packages deployed by\nDevOps and CI/CD pipelines can be a real game changer in visibility, detection and\nprevention of cyber attacks.”\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you want to see Elastic Endpoint Security in action and hear more about our\n[developments, please join us at one of our Elastic{ON} Tour stops in the US, EMEA, or Asia](https://www.endgame.com/elasticon/)\nPacific.\n\n**We're hiring**\n\nWork for a global, distributed team where finding someone like you is just a Zoom\nmeeting away.
