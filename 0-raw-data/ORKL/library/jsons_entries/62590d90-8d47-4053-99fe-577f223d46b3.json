Dragos currently publicly tracks five ICS-focused activity groups targeting manufacturing: CHRYSENE, PARISITE, MAGNALLIUM, WASSONITE, and XENOTIME in addition to various ransomware activities capable of disrupting operations.\n\nManufacturing relies on ICS to scale, function, and ensure consistent quality\ncontrol and product safety. The sector produces crucial materials, finished goods,\nand medicine and is classified as critical infrastructure. Due to the interconnected\nnature of facilities and operations, an attack on a manufacturing entity can have\nripple effects across the supply chain that relies on timely and precise production\nto support product fulfillment, health and safety, and national security objectives.\n\nRansomware adversaries are adopting ICS-aware functionality with the ability\nto stop industrial related processes and cause disruptive – and potentially\ndestructive – impacts. Dragos has not observed ICS-specific malware targeting\nmanufacturing operations on the same scale or sophistication as that used in\nthe disruptive TRISIS[1] and CRASHOVERRIDE[2] malware attacks that targeted\nenergy operations in Saudi Arabia and Ukraine, respectively. However, known\nand ongoing threats to manufacturing can have direct and indirect impact to\noperations. This report provides a snapshot of the threat landscape as of October\n2020 and is expected to change in the future as adversaries and their behaviors\nevolve.\n\n1 [TRISIS: Analyzing Safety System Targeting Malware](https://www.dragos.com/resource/trisis-analyzing-safety-system-targeting-malware/) – Dragos\n2 CRASHOVERRIDE R i th 2016 Uk i [El](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE.pdf) t i P E t P t ti F d Att k J Sl ik\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\n- Ransomware with the ability to disrupt industrial processes is the biggest\n\nthreat to manufacturing operations.

The goal, as defined by the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, is to delineate an adversary by their\nobserved actions, capabilities, and demonstrated impact– not implied or assumed intentions. These attributes create a construct around which defensive plans can\nbe built. At this time, two activity groups possess ICS-specific capabilities and tools to cause disruptive events: XENOTIME and ELECTRUM.\n[4 CHRYSENE – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/threat/chrysene/)\n[5 OilRig – MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/)\n[6 MAGNALLIUM – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/threat/magnallium/)\n[7 APT33 – MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064/)\n[8 Fox Kitten – Widespread Iranian Espionage-Offensive Campaign – Clear Sky; Who is PIONEER KITTEN? – CrowdStrike](https://www.clearskysec.com/fox-kitten/)\n[9 COVELLITE – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/threat/covellite/)\n[10 XENOTIME – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/threat/xenotime/)\n[11 TEMPVeles – MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0088/)\n\n\n##### X t\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### THREATS TO MANUFACTURING\n\n\n#### Ransomware and fulfillment, or loss of view to enterprise\n\nresource management tools.

For example, an adversary\ncould use customer data to identify potential\nopportunities for third-party or supply chain\ncompromise. Data like schematics, process\ndetails, network diagrams, or other internal\ndocumentation could be used to identify\ntargets for operational gain and assess the\nlevel of obscurity a target has from internal\nand external resources.\n\nRansomware is not just for financially\nmotivated operators. State-sponsored\nactors may also leverage ransomware in\ncyber operations targeting manufacturers.\nIn May 2020, the Republic of China (Taiwan)\ngovernment attributed ransomware events\ntargeting oil and gas and semiconductor\ncompanies to the Winnti Group[18] a threat\ngroup that is likely state-associated activity.\nThe LockerGoga ransomware attack on Norsk\nHydro in 2019 may have been the work of\nstate-sponsored adversaries aiming to cause\ndisruption rather than make money from the\noperation.[19]\n\n#### Internet-Exposed Assets\n\nIndustrial and networking assets exposed to\nthe internet are a high risk for manufacturing\nthat can facilitate initial access to a victim\nenvironment. Various tracked ICS-targeting\nactivity groups – PARISITE, MAGNALLIUM,\nALLANITE, and XENOTIME – have previously\ntargeted or currently attempt to exploit\nremote access technology or logon\ninfrastructure.\n\n\nAccording to the 2019 Dragos Year in\nReview report detailing lessons learned\nfrom the incident response and services\nteam, 66 percent of incident response cases\ninvolved adversaries directly accessing\nthe ICS network from the internet, and\n100 percent of organizations had routable\nnetwork connections into their operational\nenvironments.[20] Recent cyber intrusions\ntargeting water infrastructure[21] in Israel were\nthe result of Programmable Logic Controllers\n(PLCs) exposed to the open internet.\nDragos also responded to ransomware\nevents at industrial entities that leveraged\ninternet-connected remote access portals to\ninfiltrate the operations network and deploy\nransomware.\n\nIn July 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) and the National\nSecurity Agency (NSA) published an alert\nencouraging asset owners and operators to\ntake immediate actions restricting exposure\nof OT assets to the internet.[22] According to\nthe alert, behaviors observed recently before\npublication include: spearphishing to gain\ninitial access to Information Technology (IT)\nbefore pivoting to Operational Technology\n(OT), deploying commodity ransomware\nto impact both IT and OT environments,\nconnecting to internet accessible PLCs that\nrequire no authentication, using common\nports and standard application layer\nprotocols to communicate with controllers\nand download modified control logic, using\nvendor engineering software and program\ndownloads, and modifying control logic\nand parameters on programmable logic\ncontrollers.\n\n\n[18 國內重要企業遭勒索軟體攻擊事件調查說明 – Taiwan Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau; Bureau Names Ransomware Culprits – Taipei Times](https://www.mjib.gov.tw/news/Details/1/607)\n19 [Spyware, Stealer, Locker, Wiper: LockerGoga Revisited – Joe Slowik, Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/Spyware-Stealer-Locker-Wiper-LockerGoga-Revisited.pdf)\n[20 Dragos Year In Review 2019 Lessons Learned – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/Lessons_Learned_from_the_Front_Lines_of_ICS_Cybersecurity.pdf?hsCtaTracking=ea40a828-084b-4ee9-a0fc-0908864d3f8e%7C4eafb14d-2e38-44e0-9e6d-08c2aea4a480)\n21 [Hackers Target PLCs and SCADA Systems at Water Facilities in Israel – Control Automation](https://control.com/news/hackers-target-water-sector-facilities-in-israel/)\n[22 NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across all Operational Technologies and Control Systems – U S Department of Defense](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/23/2002462846/-1/-1/1/OT_ADVISORY-DUAL-OFFICIAL-20200722.PDF)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\n\nAdversaries are quick to weaponize and exploit\nvulnerabilities in internet-facing services\nincluding Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and\nVPN services. New vulnerabilities revealed in\nthe summer of 2020 impact critical network\ninfrastructure services including F5, Palo Alto\nNetworks, Citrix, and Juniper network devices\nwill likely be exploited by ICS-targeting\nadversaries, if they are not already.[23] These\nvulnerabilities can enable adversaries to gain\ninitial access to enterprise operations and\npotentially pivot into industrial operations.\n\n\ncause a loss of view and/or loss of control\nwithin a compromised environment.\n\nOf the vulnerabilities assessed by Dragos\nimpacting manufacturing industrial\nequipment, 70 percent require access to\nthe victim network to exploit, 26 percent\nrequire an adversary to have access to\nthe vulnerable device itself, and 8 percent\nrequire an adversary to be on the local area\nnetwork to facilitate exploitation. Asset\nowners and operators are encouraged to\nbe aware of the threat these vulnerabilities\npose to manufacturing operations. A\nloss of view or control, for instance, may\ncause safety concerns and potentially put\nworkers’ lives or the environment at risk.\n\n#### IP Theft\n\nDragos assesses with high confidence\nintellectual property theft and industrial\nespionage are major threats to manufacturing\nentities, especially by state-sponsored\nadversaries and malicious insiders. In the\n2018 report Foreign Economic Espionage\nin Cyberspace, [24] the U.S. National\nCounterintelligence and Security Center stated\nChina, Russia, and Iran are, “…three of the\nmost capable and active cyber actors tied to\neconomic espionage and the potential theft of\nU.S. trade secrets and proprietary information.”\n\nFor example, insiders working on behalf\nof Chinese state interests have stolen or\nattempted to steal data from manufacturing and\nrelated entities including Dow Chemical[25] wind\nturbine manufacturer Sinovel Wind Group,[26]\nGlaxoSmithKline,[27] and biopharmaceutical\ncompany Genentech[28] In July 2020, the U.S.\n\n\n23 [Caught In The Middle With You – Joe Slowik, Dragos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OlLsvMlUXQ&feature=youtu.be)\n[24 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace – NCSC](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf)\n[25 Ex-Dow Scientist Is Convicted of Selling Secrets in China – New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/business/global/08bribe.html)\n[26 Chinese Company Sinovel Wind Group Convicted of Theft of Trade Secrets – U.S. DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-company-sinovel-wind-group-convicted-theft-trade-secrets)\n[27 Second Former Glaxosmithkline Scientist Pleads Guilty to Stealing Trade Secrets to Benefit Chinese Pharmaceutical – Company – U.S. D](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/second-former-glaxosmithkline-scientist-pleads-guilty-stealing-trade-secrets-benefit)\n[28 Former Genentech Employees Charged With Theft Of Trade Secrets – U.S. DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-genentech-employees-charged-theft-trade-secrets)\n\n\n-----\n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) published an\nindictment charging two Chinese nationals\nwith hacking hundreds of victim organizations\nglobally for over a decade on behalf of the\nMinistry of State Security and other Chinese\ngovernment interests. Manufacturing and\nrelated companies accounted for at least five\nof the targeted victims, in addition to multiple\nother ICS entities. The adversaries operating\nunder the Winnti Group umbrella have targeted\nmanufacturing and other industrial entities\nglobally, conducting initial access and espionage\noperations. The information could support\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive\nland and sea infrastructure and economic\ndevelopment project across Asia, Europe, Indian\nOcean, South Pacific, and East Africa.\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\nIn 2019, Bayerischer Rundfunk reported adversaries\ninfiltrated automotive manufacturers BMW and\nHyundai. These adversaries were linked to Vietnamese\ninterests.[29] Car manufacturer VinFast – a subsidiary of\nVinGroup, the Vietnamese conglomerate with close ties\nto the country’s government[30] – had recently closed a\ndeal with BMW to license the carmaker’s technology,\narchitecture, and an engine, but not the manufacturing\nprocess or sequencing automation details.[31] It is\npossible adversaries were looking for data to further\nenrich the automotive manufacturing data already\nobtained by VinFast to improve production quality,\nthough this is not confirmed. According to BMW, no\nsensitive data was obtained.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is also causing an\nincrease in attacks targeting manufacturing\nrelated entities. As countries race to develop\na vaccine for the pandemic that has killed\nmore than one million people globally,\nadversaries have increasingly targeted\n\n\npharmaceutical and healthcare organizations\nto steal ongoing research and development\nrelated to the virus and potential vaccines.[32]\nCurrently, publicly reported attacks targeting\nentities researching and/or developing\ncoronavirus vaccines and prevention have\ndemonstrated intrusion and reconnaissance\nactivities within enterprise resources, which\ncould facilitate movement into operations or\nvaccine production tampering or disruption\nin a worst-case scenario.\n\nIP and theft of trade secrets related to\nprocess and automation functions can enable\nindustrial organizations and interested states\nand governments to fast-track development\nof critical infrastructure, including\nmanufacturing. It can also support statesponsored espionage activities for political or\nnational security efforts. Obtaining material\nspecifications for products is likely not\nenough to replicate them. Businesses rely on\nengineering and industrial design schematics,\nand sequencing automation details. According\nto Dragos researchers, adversaries may want\nto steal the algorithms, engineering designs,\nand programming specifications to replicate\nthe entire production process, not just the\nmaterial goods and services output.\n\n#### Third-Party/Supply Chain\n\nSince 2017, multiple threats migrated toward\ncompromising vendors, Managed Service\nProviders (MSPs), and external network\nservices as the first step in victim compromise.\nAdversaries can abuse existing trust\nrelationships and interconnectivity to gain\naccess to sensitive resources – including ICS\n\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\n\n[29 Autoindustrie im Visier von Hackern: BMW ausgespäht – BR](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/wirtschaft/fr-autoindustrie-im-visier-von-hackern-bmw-ausgespaeht,RjnLkD4)\n[30 The Rise and Rise of a Vietnamese Corporate Empire – FT](https://www.ft.com/content/84323c32-9799-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36)\n[31 VinFast – Follow The Birth of a Car Company Using BMW Tech and Italian Design from Pininfarina – TopSpeed](https://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/vinfastfollow-the-birth-of-a-car-company-using-bmw-tech-and-italian-design-from-pininfarina-ar182463.html)\n[32 Exclusive: Iran-linked hackers recently targeted coronavirus drugmaker Gilead – sources – Reuters; DOJ says Chinese hackers targeted coronavirus vaccine](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-gilead-iran-ex/exclusive-iran-linked-hackers-recently-targeted-coronavirus-drugmaker-gilead-sources-idUSKBN22K2EV)\n[research – Politico ; Advisory: APT29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development – NCSC; Chinese hackers accused of stealing information from Spanish centers](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/21/doj-chinese-hackers-coronavirus-research-375855)\nworking on Covid-19 vaccine – El País\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems in some cases – with little likelihood\nof detection.\n\nExamples of this activity include activity\ngroups DYMALLOY and ALLANITE that\ncompromised vendors and contractors for\nsubsequent phishing campaigns targeting\nthe electric sector, [33] XENOTIME that targeted\nseveral original equipment manufacturers and\nvendors, and a widespread hacking campaign\nby APT10 that hijacked connections between\nMSPs and their customers, which included\nmanufacturing organizations.[34]\n\nContractors, vendors, and other thirdparty individuals often have direct access\nto operational environments for activities\nlike updates, inspections, or new equipment\ninstallations. It is possible for adversaries\nto compromise equipment used by these\nindividuals as an access point into their\nultimate target.\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\nIn 2018, a shipping industry group detailed an incident\nin which a bunker surveyor accidentally infected\nshipboard computers with malware.[35] The ship had\ncompleted bunkering operations, transporting oil to\nanother ship, and the bunker surveyor came aboard\nto conduct quality assurance and documentation\nefforts. The surveyor asked to use a host in the\nengine control room to print documents and inserted\na USB drive containing malware. The ship operators\ndid not identify the malware until a subsequent\ncybersecurity assessment.\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) providers\nalso provide potential infection vectors that\ncould bridge the IT and OT gap if proper\nsegmentation and security are not in place.\nERP services require access to operations\nassets like data historians to monitor and store\n\n\ninformation relating to production, supply\nchain, inventory, and safety. They should\nbe integrated into enterprise functions, like\ncompliance or finance. Recent vulnerability\nexposures highlight the threat and potential\nexploitation of these systems. In July 2020,\nmajor ERP provider SAP published details and\npatches for a critical vulnerability affecting\nthe SAP NetWeaver Application Server\n(AS) Java component impacting numerous\nSAP business solutions, including ERP. An\nadversary could use the vulnerability to take\ncontrol of trusted SAP connections.[36]\n\nManufacturing entities are part of a\nglobal supply chain supporting multiple\nother industries, making them a target\nfor adversaries targeting industries like\nelectric utility or pharmaceutical. Some\nmanufacturing companies’ activities stretch\ninto multiple industrial verticals. Automotive\nmanufacturer Volkswagen in 2019 became\na renewable power provider and aims to\ncompete with energy companies on battery\nenergy storage and management [37]\n\nLeveraging third-party connections can\nenable an adversary to conduct espionage,\nreconnaissance, and data theft operations\nto pre-position themselves for a potentially\ndisruptive OT attack. Due to interconnected\nrelationships manufacturing companies have\nacross industrial verticals, asset owners and\noperators should be aware of threats to all ICS\nentities and incorporate ICS-specific threat\nintelligence into security operations and risk\nmanagement.\n\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\n\n[33 America’s Electric Grid has a Vulnerable Back Door – and Russia Walked Through It – The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-electric-grid-has-a-vulnerable-back-doorand-russia-walked-through-it-11547137112)\n[34 Inside the West’s failed fight against China’s ‘Cloud Hopper’ hackers – Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-cyber-cloudhopper/)\n[35 The Guidelines on Cyber Security Onboard Ships – International Chamber of Shipping](https://www.ics-shipping.org/docs/default-source/resources/safety-security-and-operations/guidelines-on-cyber-security-onboard-ships.pdf?sfvrsn=16)\n[36 Critical Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS Java – CISA](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-195a)\n[37 Volkswagen plans to tap electric car batteries to compete with power firms – Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-electric-energy/volkswagen-plans-to-tap-electric-car-batteries-to-compete-with-power-firms-idUSKBN20Z2D5)\n\n\n-----\n\n### IT/OT CONVERGENCE\n\n\nenvironments, and a lack of access restrictions,\nmalware wormed its way through industrial\noperations causing billions of dollars in losses.\n\nAlthough the WannaCry and NotPetya events\nserved as a wakeup call across manufacturers\nglobally, three years later improper network\nsegmentation remains an issue.\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\nIn 2020, Dragos observed EKANS ransomware\nincorporating domain checks to identify if a victim\nnetwork’s Windows Active Directory (AD) instance\ncould be contacted. Honda was one of its victims,\nand the ransomware disrupted the automotive\nmanufacturer’s operations across five countries. This\nsuggests poor network segmentation in at least parts\nof its global operations.[39]\n\n#### Wi-Fi Connections\n\nIn addition to internet-connected process\nautomation and other “smart” manufacturing\nprocesses, operators are adopting WiFi enabled machine tools and diagnostic\nequipment that enable workers to move\naround plants and factories without tripping\nover power cords.

Dragos\nAsset Identification allows for certain\nanalytics to function by detecting malicious\nbehaviors against asset types.\n\n- Leverage industrial-specific threat detection\n\nmechanisms to identify malware within OT\nand reinforce defense in depth strategies at\nthe network level, leading to a more robust\ninvestigation ability by defenders and\nanalysts.\n\n- Ensure corporate networks are patched to\n\nprevent malware infections from entering\nthe environment and to prevent subsequent\npropagation.\n\n- Ensure that critical network services, such\n\nas Active Directory (AD) and the servers\nhosting it, are well-defended and that\nadministrative access to hosting devices is\nrestricted to the greatest degree possible.\n\n- Evaluate and limit AD federation and\n\nsharing between IT and ICS networks to\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION \n\n\nA concerning upward trend of ransomware targeting manufacturing companies leading to op­\nerations disruptions exists. Internet exposed assets, supply chain and third-party compromise\nrisks, and a growing convergence of interconnected enterprise and operations networks are\ncontributing to a growing threat landscape.\n\nDragos continues to monitor malicious activity groups and threats targeting manufacturing\noperations, including concerning ICS-aware ransomware capable of disrupting operations. Addi­\ntionally, adversaries do not need to specifically target industrial processes to achieve widespread\ndisruption across plants, fleets, or automation processes, as detailed in this report.\n\nDragos assesses with high confidence the threats to manufacturing will continue to increase\nover the next year.\n\n\n###### TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DRAGOS AND OUR TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES, AND THREAT INTELLIGENCE FOR THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR, PLEASE VISIT WWW.DRAGOS.COM.\n\n\n# THANK YOU\n\n\n-----",
