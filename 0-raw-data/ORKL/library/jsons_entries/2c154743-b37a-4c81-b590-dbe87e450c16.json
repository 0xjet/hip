Being a threat actor of interest in the context of the Israel-Hamas](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/the-israel-hamas-war-cyber-domain-state-sponsored-activity-of-interest/)\n[war, we track Gaza Cybergang as a group composed of several adjacent sub-groups](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068/)\nobserved to share victims, TTPs, and use related malware strains since 2018. These include\nGaza Cybergang Group 1 (Molerats), Gaza Cybergang Group 2 (Arid Viper, Desert Falcons,\n[APT-C-23), and Gaza Cybergang Group 3 (the group behind Operation Parliament).](https://securelist.com/operation-parliament-who-is-doing-what/85237/)\n\nThe goal of this post is twofold:\n\nTo highlight relations between recent and historical operations, providing a new\ncommon context connecting the Gaza Cybergang sub-groups.\nTo provide recent findings and previously unreported IOCs, which add to the\naccumulated knowledge of the group and support further collective tracking of Gaza\nCybergang activities.\n\nIn the midst of Gaza Cybergang activity spanning from late 2022 until late 2023, we\nobserved that the group introduced a new backdoor to their malware arsenal used in\ntargeting primarily Palestinian entities. We track this backdoor as Pierogi++. We assess that\n\n\n-----\n\nPierogi++ is based on an older malware strain named Pierogi, first observed in 2019. We\nalso observed consistent targeting of Palestinian entities in this time period using the group’s\nstaple Micropsia family malware and Pierogi++.\n\nThis targeting is typical for Gaza Cybergang. These activities are likely aligned with the\ntensions between the Hamas and Fatah factions, whose reconciliation attempts had been\nstagnating before and after the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war. At the time of writing, our\nvisibility into Gaza Cybergang’s activities after the onset of the conflict does not point to\nsignificant changes in their intensity or characteristics.\n\nOur analysis of recent and historical malware used in Gaza Cybergang operations highlights\nnew relations between activities that have taken place years apart – the Big Bang campaign\n(2018) and Operation Bearded Barbie (2022). Further, technical indicators we observed,\noriginating from a recently reported activity, reinforce a suspected relation between Gaza\nCybergang and the lesser-known threat group WIRTE. This group has historically been\nconsidered a distinct cluster and then associated with low confidence with the Gaza\nCybergang. This demonstrates the intertwined nature of the Gaza Cybergang cluster making\n[the accurate delineation between its constituent and even other suspected Middle Eastern](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/alien-labs-2019-analysis-of-threat-groups-molerats-and-apt-c-37)\ngroups challenging.\n\nThroughout our analysis of Gaza Cybergang activities spanning from 2018 until present date\nwe observed consistent malware evolution over relatively long time periods. This ranges\nfrom minor changes in used obfuscation techniques, to adopting new development\nparadigms, and resurfacing old malware strains in the form of new ones (as Pierogi++\ndemonstrates). In addition, the observed overlaps in targeting and malware similarities\nacross the Gaza Cybergang sub-groups after 2018 suggests that the group has likely been\nundergoing a consolidation process. This possibly includes the formation of an internal\nmalware development and maintenance hub and/or streamlining supply from external\nvendors.\n\n## Micropsia and Pierogi++ Target Hamas Opposition\n\n[The Gaza Cybergang umbrella has continuously](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/arid-viper-targets-palestine/) [targeted Israeli and Palestinian entities](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/mantis-palestinian-attacks)\npreceding the Israel-Hamas war. We observed additional activities spanning from late 2021\nto late 2023 aligned with previous research. Our visibility into these activities, and the theme\nand language of the used lure and decoy documents, indicate that they were primarily\ntargeting Palestinian entities. The majority involved malware variants of the staple Micropsia\nfamily.\n\nAmong the Micropsia family malware, we observed its Delphi and Python-based variants\ndeploying decoy documents written in Arabic and focussing on Palestinian matters, such as\nthe Palestinian cultural heritage and political events. Many of the associated C2 domain\nnames, such as bruce-ess[.]com and wayne-lashley[.]com, reference public figures,\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich aligns with the known domain naming conventions of the group. To support further\ncollective tracking of Gaza Cybergang activities, we focus at the end of the report on listing\npreviously unreported Micropsia indicators.\n\nDecoy document\n\nAmong the Micropsia activities we identified a backdoor that we assess is based on a\n[malware first reported in 2020 and named Pierogi. This backdoor, which we labeled](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-2-the-discovery-of-the-new-mysterious-pierogi-backdoor)\nPierogi++, is implemented in C++, and we observed its use in 2022 and over 2023. The\nmalware is typically delivered through archive files or weaponized Office documents on\nPalestinian matters, written in English or Arabic.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious documents distributing Pierogi++\n\nThe documents distributing Pierogi++ use macros to deploy the malware, which then\ntypically masquerades as a Windows artifact, such as a scheduled task or a utility\napplication. The malware implementation is embedded either in the macros or in the\ndocuments themselves, often in Base64-encoded form.\n\n\n-----\n\nOffice macro deploying Pierogi++\n\nPierogi++ executables also masquerade as politically-themed documents, with names such\nas “The national role of the revolutionary and national councils in confronting the plans for\n_liquidation and Judaization”, “The situation of Palestinian refugees in Syria refugees in_\n_Syria”, and “The Ministry of State for Wall and Settlement Affairs established by the_\n_Palestinian government”._\n\nWe assess that Pierogi++ is based on the Pierogi backdoor, whose variants are implemented\nin Delphi and Pascal. Pierogi and Pierogi++ share similarities in code and functionalities,\nsuch as strings, reconnaissance techniques, and deployment of decoy documents, some\nalso seen in Micropsia malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nString indicating that no anti-virus solution has been detected: Pierogi++ (Tm9BVg==\n\ndecodes to NoAV)\n\nMicropsia\n\nFurther, Pierogi++ samples implement in the same order the same backdoor functionalities\nas Pierogi: taking screenshots, command execution, and downloading attacker-provided\nfiles.\n\nWhen handling backdoor commands, some Pierogi++ samples use the strings download and\n```\nscreen, whereas earlier Pierogi samples have used the Ukrainian strings vydalyty,\nZavantazhyty, and Ekspertyza. This raised suspicions at the time of potential external\n\n```\ninvolvement in Pierogi’s development. We have not observed indicators pointing to such\ninvolvement in the Pierogi++ samples we analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nPierogi++ backdoor strings\n\nMost of the Pierogi++ C2 servers are registered at Namecheap and hosted by Stark\nIndustries Solutions LTD, aligning with previous infrastructure management practices of the\n[Gaza Cybergang umbrella. The backdoor uses the curl library for exchanging data with the](https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/master/lib)\nC2 server, a technique that we do not often observe in Gaza Cybergang’s malware arsenal.\n\nUse of the curl library\n\nPierogi++ represents a compelling illustration of the continuous investment in maintenance\nand innovation of Gaza Cybergang’s malware, likely in an attempt to enhance its capabilities\nand evade detection based on known malware characteristics.\n\n## From Molerats to Arid Viper And Beyond\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the first report on the Pierogi backdoor in February 2020, late 2020 and 2021 mark\nthe association of the backdoor and its infrastructure with Arid Viper. The Micropsia activity\nlinked to Arid Viper, which led to the [discovery of the then-new PyMicropsia malware in](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pymicropsia/)\nDecember 2020, includes Pierogi samples. Further historical Pierogi samples use the\n```\nescanor[.]live and nicoledotso[.]icu domains for C2 purposes, which have been\n\n```\n[associated with Arid Viper in December 2020 and](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/mapping-out-aridviper-infrastructure-using-recon-s-malware-module) [April 2021. The latest variant of Pierogi is](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf)\nPierogi++, which we observed targeting Palestinian entities in 2022 and over 2023 – this\ntargeting is typical for Arid Viper.\n\nOur investigations into malware used by Gaza Cybergang prior to 2022, which share\ncapabilities, structure, and infrastructure with Pierogi, resulted in a multitude of samples\nimplemented in Delphi, Pascal, and C++. This highlights the frequent adoption of different\n[development paradigms by Gaza Cybergang and aligns with the observations by Facebook,](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf)\nwhich associates these variants with Arid Viper and tracks them using different names under\nthe broader Micropsia malware family, such as Glasswire, Primewire, and fgref.\n\nMalware attributions\n\n\n-----\n\nIn late 2020, victims targeted with Pierogi variants as part of a suspected Arid Viper\noperation were [observed to be also infected with the then-new SharpStage and DropBook](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf)\nmalware, an overlap assessed to strengthen the ties between the Molerats and Arid Viper\nGaza Cybergang sub-groups.\n\n[Later in June 2021, the LastConn malware, which has been discovered as part of activities](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-ta402-molerats-malware-targets-governments-middle-east)\nattributed to the TA402 cluster, was assessed with high confidence to be an updated version\nof SharpStage.\n\n[Based on our followup investigation into recent 2023 TA402 activity targeting Middle Eastern](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta402-uses-complex-ironwind-infection-chains-target-middle-east-based-government)\ngovernment entities, we highlight concrete overlaps in malware used by TA402 and a lesserknown threat actor named WIRTE. First [disclosed in April 2019, WIRTE was initially](https://lab52.io/blog/wirte-group-attacking-the-middle-east/)\n[considered to be a distinct cluster but later associated with low confidence to the Gaza](https://securelist.com/wirtes-campaign-in-the-middle-east-living-off-the-land-since-at-least-2019/105044/)\nCybergang umbrella (primarily based on the use of decoys on Palestinian matters, which are\ntypical for the Gaza Cybergang constituent sub-groups).\n\nWIRTE is known for using a unique custom user agent for C2 communication when staging\nmalware, with the value of the rv field likely being an intrusion identifier. WIRTE’s stagers\nencapsulate C2 communication attempts in an infinite loop, separated by sleep periods of\nrandomly generated lengths within defined lower and upper boundaries. We observe the\nsame unique user agent format and C2 communication pattern in TA402’s .NET malware\nstagers.\n\nUser agent and C2 communication in 2020 WIRTE malware\n\n\n-----\n\nUser agent and C2 communication in 2022 TA401 malware\n\nThe involvement of malware artifacts previously seen only in the context of WIRTE indicates\na likely relation between the TA402, WIRTE, and Gaza Cybergang clusters. This aligns with\nthe latest TA402 attribution assessment as a cluster overlapping with Gaza Cybergang and\nWIRTE.\n\n## Back To The Big Bang\n\n[Operation Bearded Barbie, revealed in April 2022 and attributed with moderate-high](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-bearded-barbie-apt-c-23-campaign-targeting-israeli-officials)\n[confidence to Arid Viper, is a campaign that has been targeting Israeli individuals and](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/arid-viper-apts-nest-of-spyc23-malware-continues-to-target-android-devices/)\nofficials in the law enforcement, military, and emergency services sectors. The operation\nhighlights the BarbWire backdoor as a novel malware in Arid Viper’s arsenal.\n\nA closer look at the implementation of the BarbWire variants observed as part of Operation\nBearded Barbie reveal relations to a malware strain used as part of the 2018 Big Bang\n[campaign, which was considered an evolution of a 2017 campaign targeting Palestinian](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/palestine-delphi/)\nindividuals and entities. Without making a concrete attribution at the time, the campaign was\n[loosely associated with the Gaza Cybergang, noting some links to Arid Viper in particular.](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/conference_slides/2018/FinkelsteinKayal-VB2018-APTC23.pdf)\n\nThe Big Bang campaign involves the use of a C++ implant, assessed to be an upgraded\nversion of older Micropsia variants. In addition to some similarities in execution flow and\nstructure, we observed that the backdoors used in the Big Bang and Bearded Barbie\ncampaigns share unique strings that report the execution status and/or indicate internal\nreferences to malware modules.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BarbWire samples used as part of Operation Bearded Barbie are reported to implement\na custom base64 algorithm [(cit.) to obfuscate strings. The backdoor does not implement](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-bearded-barbie-apt-c-23-campaign-targeting-israeli-officials)\nchanges to the Base64 encoding algorithm itself, but modifies Base64 strings by adding an\nextra character that is removed before decoding. String decoding of BarbWire strings in this\nway reveals exact matches between BarbWire and the backdoor observed in the Big Bang\ncampaign.\n\nBackdoor string matches\n\nIn contrast to BarbWire, BigBang backdoor samples obfuscate the same strings present in\nBarbWire using Base64-encoding only. The malware authors have likely introduced the\nBase64 string modification technique in later malware development efforts (reflected in\nOperation Bearded Barbie), as a relatively simple but effective attempt to evade detection\nbased on known string artifacts.\n\nThis technique also allows for quick changes of the modified Base64 strings by only\nchanging the second character to keep evading detection over time. For example, both of the\nstrings IZERvZXMgbm90IGV4aXN0Lg and IHERvZXMgbm90IGV4aXN0Lg Base64-decode to “\n```\nDoes not exist.” once the second character is removed.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n```\nGaza Cybergang operations over 2022 and 2023 reveal a sustained focus on targeting\nPalestinian entities. The discovery of the Pierogi++ backdoor shows that the group continues\nto evolve and supplement its staple malware arsenal, including transforming older\nimplementations into new tooling.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe intertwined nature of its constituent sub-groups sharing TTPs, malware, and victims,\nindicates that Gaza Cybergang is a unified front against anti-Hamas interests. The persistent\nnature of the Gaza Cybergang threat underscores the necessity for sustained vigilance and\ncooperative measures to address the challenges posed by these threat actors.\n\nSentinelLabs continues to monitor Gaza Cybergang activities to further improve the\ncollective knowledge on the group’s dynamics and to supply indicators, which are relevant to\nsecurity teams defending their organizations and individuals at risk of being targeted.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### SHA-1 Hashes\n\n003bb055758a7d687f12b65fc802bac07368335e Micropsia family malware\n\n19026b6eb5c1c272d33bda3eab8197bec692abab Micropsia family malware\n\n20c10d0eff2ef68b637e22472f14d87a40c3c0bd Pierogi backdoor\n\n26fe41799f66f51247095115f9f1ff5dcc56baf8 TA402 malware staging executable\n(2022 version)\n\n278565e899cb48138cc0bbc482beee39e4247a5d Pierogi backdoor\n\n2a45843cab0241cce3541781e4e19428dcf9d949 Micropsia family malware\n\n32d0073b8297cc8350969fd4b844d80620e2273a Document distributing Pierogi++\n\n3ae41f7a84ca750a774f777766ccf4fd38f7725a Document distributing Pierogi++\n\n42cb16fc35cfc30995e5c6a63e32e2f9522c2a77 Pierogi++\n\n4dcdb7095da34b3cef73ad721d27002c5f65f47b BarbWire backdoor\n\n5128d0af7d700241f227dd3f546b4af0ee420bbc Pierogi++\n\n5619e476392c195ba318a5ff20e40212528729ba Micropsia family malware\n\n599cf23db2f4d3aa3e19d28c40b3605772582cae Pierogi backdoor\n\n5e46151df994b7b71f58556c84eeb90de0776609 Document distributing Pierogi++\n\n5fcc262197fe8e0f129acab79fd28d32b30021d7 WIRTE PowerShell script\n\n60480323f0e6efa3ec08282650106820b1f35d2f Archive distributing Pierogi++\n\n694fa6436302d55c544cfb4bc9f853d3b29888ef BarbWire backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n708f05d39df7e47aefc4b15cb2db9f26bc9fad5f TA402 malware staging executable\n(2022 version)\n\n745657b4902a451c72b4aab6cf00d05895bbc02f Micropsia family malware\n\n75a63321938463b8416d500b34a73ce543a9d54d Pierogi++\n\n95fc3fb692874f7415203a819543b1e0dd495a57 Micropsia family malware\n\n994ebbe444183e0d67b13f91d75b0f9bcfb011db Operation Big Bang backdoor\n\naeeeee47becaa646789c5ee6df2a6e18f1d25228 Pierogi++\n\nc3038d7b01813b365fd9c5fd98cd67053ed22371 Micropsia family malware\n\nda96a8c04edf8c39d9f9a98381d0d549d1a887e8 Pierogi++\n\nee899ae5de50fdee657e04ccd65d76da7ede7c6f Operation Big Bang backdoor\n\nf3e99ec389e6108e8fda6896fa28a4d7237995be Pierogi++\n\n### Domains\n\naracaravan[.]com Pierogi++ C2 server\n\nbeatricewarner[.]com Pierogi++ C2 server\n\nbruce-ess[.]com Micropsia C2 server\n\nclaire-conway[.]com Micropsia C2 server\n\ndelooyp[.]com Micropsia C2 server\n\nescanor[.]live Pierogi backdoor C2 server\n\nizocraft[.]com Micropsia C2 server\n\njane-chapman[.]com Micropsia C2 server\n\nlindamullins[.]info Operation Big Bang backdoor C2 server\n\nnicoledotson[.]icu Pierogi backdoor C2 server\n\noveringtonray[.]info Pierogi backdoor C2 server\n\nporthopeminorhockey[.]net Micropsia C2 server\n\nspgbotup[.]club Operation Big Bang backdoor C2 server\n\nstgeorgebankers[.]com WIRTE C2 server\n\n\n-----\n\nswsan-lina-soso[.]info Pierogi++ C2 server\n\ntheconomics[.]net TA402 C2 server\n\nwanda-bell[.]website BarbWire C2 server\n\nwayne-lashley[.]com Micropsia C2 server\n\nzakaria-chotzen[.]info Pierogi++ C2 server\n\n\n-----",
