Using the power of machine learning and behavior-based detection, the Falcon\nplatform is able to identify and block REvil ransomware in the early stages of the attack. For\nthe best protection, Falcon customers should enable “Suspicious Processes” detection,\nwhich is among the policies CrowdStrike recommends for the Falcon platform.\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has been tracking the evolution of REvil ransomware and the\nPINCHY SPIDER threat actor group developing it since 2018. The group is believed to have\nalso been involved in the development of the now defunct GandCrab ransomware.\nSimilarities between REvil (also known as “Sodinokibi”) and GandCrab led CrowdStrike\nIntelligence to suspect these two ransomware are related.\n\n## What Happened?\n\nOn Friday, July 2, REvil ransomware operators managed to compromise Kaseya VSA\nsoftware, used to monitor and manage Kaseya customer’s infrastructure. REvil ransomware\n[operators used zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver a malicious update, compromising fewer](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-day-exploit/)\nthan 60 Kaseya customers and 1,500 downstream companies, according to Kaseya’s public\nstatement.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were previously identified and privately reported to Kaseya by the\n[Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure. Current reports suggest that the REvil operator](https://csirt.divd.nl/)\nmade use of a privately disclosed vulnerability, now tracked as CVE-2021-30116, in order to\nachieve execution.\n\nKaseya has recommended that on-premises partners keep their VSA servers offline, as they\nare currently in the process of releasing a patch to address the issues. Meanwhile, recent\n[reports suggest REvil operators initially asked for a ransom of $70 million USD, claiming to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2021/07/05/70-million-demanded-as-revil-ransomware-attackers-claim-1-million-systems-hit/)\nhave infected more than 1 million systems. A surprising development is that REvil operators\n[may have lowered the ransom demand to $50 million USD along with an offer of a universal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/05/revil-hackers-behind-massive-ransomware-outbreak-drop-demand-to-50m.html)\ndecryptor for all victims.\n\n## How CrowdStrike Falcon Protects Customers From REvil Ransomware\n\nThe Falcon platform was designed from the ground up to leverage the power of the cloud,\nmachine learning and behavioral detection to protect organizations from sophisticated\nattacks and threats, such as [ransomware.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\n\nThe Falcon platform takes a layered approach to prevent, identify and protect customers\nfrom ransomware, including REvil ransomware. In this particular case, the Falcon sensor can\nprevent the attack whenever a suspicious process usually associated with ransomware is\ntriggered, as well as detect the REvil ransomware using on-sensor and in-the-cloud machine\n[learning as well as behavioral detection with indicators of attack (IOAs). It can also detect if a](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/)\nlegitimate process, such as the one associated with the Kaseya VSA, is attempting to load\n[malicious code. In addition, the Falcon OverWatch™ team is constantly monitoring and will](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-overwatch-threat-hunting/)\nimmediately notify customers if they observe behaviors associated with nation-state or\neCrime threat actors like PINCHY SPIDER, enabling the customer to take action against the\nthreat.\n\n\n-----\n\nFalcon has the ability to protect clients from this campaign by identifying suspicious\nprocesses associated with ransomware. The Falcon platform uses IOAs to detect and\nprevent suspicious processes from being executed and protects customers from\nransomware campaigns early in the attack chain, before the payload is executed.\n\nThe unique leverage that machine learning brings to the security industry is that it can\nidentify both known and unknown malware, by understanding malicious intent based solely\non the attributes of a file without prior knowledge of it. Falcon machine learning can provide\ncoverage for REvil ransomware by accurately identifying and blocking the attack in multiple\nplaces.\n\nFalcon protects customers from ransomware including new or unknown REvil samples, as\nwell as accurately identifies and blocks malicious behavior indicative of ransomware.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nFalcon utilizes a multi-layered approach to IOA coverage that targets multiple steps in an\nattack chain. In this case, the Kaseya process spawns a cmd shell to perform subsequent\nmalicious actions such as disabling various scanning and other security solutions on the\nendpoint. Falcon detects this behavior and terminates the cmd shell, thwarting the attack.\nThis prevents REvil being dropped to disk and sideloaded into MsMpeng.exe, an older but\nlegitimate version of a Windows Defender binary. Such coverage is the result of intelligence\nderived from our continuous monitoring of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nassociated with malware and threat actors’ behavior.\n\nThe Falcon platform also has the ability to identify the proxying execution of malicious\ncommands, even if the parent is a trusted process with signed binaries — effectively\ndetecting and preventing adversaries from abusing the VSA vulnerability and delivering the\nmalicious payload. This ability is demonstrated in the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nThe Falcon platform protects customers from threats such as REvil ransomware as well as\nsophisticated adversaries every day. It’s through our layered approach to security that we\nsecure the assets that matter most to our customers and remain focused on our mission to\nstop breaches.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Use leading security technologies. Organizations need to use the right security\n\ntechnologies to protect their infrastructure and most valuable assets from ransomware.\n2. Use an endpoint security solution that takes a layered approach to preventing,\n\nidentifying and protecting customers from ransomware.\n3. Do not give in to ransomware demands. The U.S government, law enforcement and\n\nsecurity companies recommend that organizations faced with ransomware demands\nshould not give in to extortion.\n4. You are not alone — seek help and advice from experts. Companies experiencing\n\nsecurity incidents may have a difficult time or not have the resources for investigating\nand recovering on their own.\n\nIf you suspect that your organization may have been impacted by REvil or any other threat,\n[we are here to help immediately with a Compromise Assessment to identify ongoing or past](https://www.crowdstrike.com/services/am-i-breached/compromise-assessment/)\nattacker activity in your organization’s environment.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon has been named a leader in in the Gartner 2021 Magic Quadrant for\nEndpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) and The Forrester Wave™ Endpoint Security Software\nAs A Service, as well as demonstrated its detection and protection capabilities in tests\n\n\n-----\n\nperformed by MITRE, SE Labs and AV-Comparatives, all leading independent testing\norganizations.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Learn more about PINCHY SPIDER, CARBON SPIDER and other ransomware_\n_[adversaries in the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)_\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report for more information about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/)_\n_adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence in 2020._\n_[See how the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform protects customers](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/)_\n_from DarkSide ransomware in this blog: DarkSide Goes Dark: How CrowdStrike Falcon_\n_Customers Were Protected._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
