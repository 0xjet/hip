So far in August, we have observed only two small and selectively targeted\n[attacks distributing this ransomware. One was primarily aimed at Healthcare and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/solutions/healthcare-information-security) [Education verticals;](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/solutions/higher-education-security)\nanother targeted Manufacturing and Technology verticals. We selected the name “Defray” based on\nthe command and control (C&C) server hostname from the first observed attack:\n\ndefrayable-listings[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nCoincidentally, the verb defray means to provide money to pay a portion of a cost or expense,\nalthough what victims are defraying in this case is unclear.\n\n**Defray Malware Distribution**\n\n[The distribution of Defray malware has several notable characteristics:](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\n\nDefray is currently being spread via Microsoft Word document attachments in email\nThe campaigns are as small as several messages each\nThe lures are custom crafted to appeal to the intended set of potential victims\nThe recipients are individuals or distribution lists, e.g., group@ and websupport@\nGeographic targeting is in the UK and US\nVertical targeting varies by campaign and is narrow and selective\n\nOn August 22, Proofpoint researchers detected an email campaign targeted primarily at Healthcare\nand Education involving messages with a Microsoft Word document containing an embedded\nexecutable (specifically, an OLE packager shell object). In the screenshot shown in Figure 1, the\nattachment uses a UK hospital logo in the upper right (not shown) and purports to be from the\nDirector of Information Management & Technology at the hospital.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: The Word document, patient_report.doc, delivered in malicious email messages_\n\nThis was similar to a campaign observed by Proofpoint researchers on August 15 targeting\nManufacturing and Technology verticals and involving messages with the subject “Order/Quote” and\na Microsoft Word document containing an embedded executable (also an OLE packager shell\nobject).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the August 15 campaign, the attachment used a lure referencing a UK-based aquarium with\ninternational locations (Figure 2), and purported to be from a representative of the aquarium.\n\n_Figure 2: Word document attachment, presentation.doc, delivered in malicious email messages_\n\nIf the potential victim double clicks on the embedded executable, the ransomware is dropped with a\nname such as taskmgr.exe or explorer.exe in the %TMP% folder and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Defray Analysis**\n\nTo alert the victim that their computer has been infected and that their files are encrypted, this\nransomware creates FILES.TXT (Figure 3) in many folders throughout the system. HELP.txt, with\nidentical content to FILES.txt, also appeared on the Desktop folder where we executed the\nransomware.\n\n_Figure 3: FILES.txt ransom message_\n\nThe ransom note shown in Figure 3 follows a recent trend of fairly high ransom demands; in this\ncase, $5000. However, the actors do provide email addresses so that victims can potentially\nnegotiate a smaller ransom or ask questions, and even go so far as to recommend BitMessage as an\nalternative for receiving more timely responses. At the same time, they also recommend that\norganizations maintain offline backups to prevent future infections.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware contains a hardcoded list of file extensions, shown below, for files that it will encrypt\n(although we observed others such as .lnk and .exe encrypted that were not on this list). The file\nextensions of modified files were not changed. We observed that the modified files all end in bytes\n“30 82 04 A4 02 01 00 02 82 01 01 00 9F CF 52 84” for our sample. We did not investigate the\nspecifics of the encryption routine.\n\n.001 | .3ds | .7zip | .MDF | .NRG | .PBF | .SQLITE | .SQLITE2 | .SQLITE3 | .SQLITEDB | .SVG | .UIF |\n.WMF | .abr | .accdb | .afi | .arw | .asm | .bkf | .c4d | .cab | .cbm | .cbu | .class | .cls | .cpp | .cr2 | .crw |\n.csh | .csv | .dat | .dbx | .dcr | .dgn | .djvu | .dng | .doc | .docm | .docx | .dwfx | .dwg | .dxf | .fla | .fpx |\n.gdb | .gho | .ghs | .hdd | .html | .iso | .iv2i | .java | .key | .lcf | .matlab | .max | .mdb | .mdi | .mrbak |\n.mrimg | .mrw | .nef | .odg | .ofx | .orf | .ova | .ovf | .pbd | .pcd | .pdf | .php | .pps | .ppsx | .ppt | .pptx |\n.pqi | .prn | .psb | .psd | .pst | .ptx | .pvm | .pzl | .qfx | .qif | .r00 | .raf | .rar | .raw | .reg | .rw2 | .s3db |\n.skp | .spf | .spi | .sql | .sqlite-journal | .stl | .sup | .swift | .tib | .txf | .u3d | .v2i | .vcd | .vcf | .vdi | .vhd |\n.vmdk | .vmem | .vmwarevm | .vmx | .vsdx | .wallet | .win | .xls | .xlsm | .xlsx | .zip\n\nDefray has been observed communicating with an external C&C server via both HTTP (clear-text,\nshown in Figure 4) and HTTPS, to which it will report infection information.\n\n_Figure 4: Screenshot of the clear-text C&C beacon_\n\nAfter encryption is complete, Defray may cause other general havoc on the system by disabling\nstartup recovery and deleting volume shadow copies. On Windows 7 the ransomware monitors and\nkills running programs with a GUI, such as the task manager and browsers. We have not observed\nthe same behavior on Windows XP.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDefray Ransomware is somewhat unusual in its use in small, targeted attacks. Although we are\nbeginning to see a trend of more frequent targeting in ransomware attacks, it still remains less\ncommon than large-scale “spray and pray” campaigns. It is also likely that Defray is not for sale,\neither as a service or as a licensed application like many ransomware strains. Instead, it appears that\nDefray may be for the personal use of specific threat actors, making its continued distribution in\nsmall, targeted attacks more likely. We will continue to monitor this threat and provide updates as\nnew information emerges.\n\n**[Defray Ransomware Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/glossary/indicators-compromise)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n947b360b76dd815f5b5d226b8a9aba22fe6b5589a3c16c765625ce2f9d1f5db2 sha256 Defray\nbinary\n\ndefrayable-listings.000webhostapp[.]com dns C&C\nDomain\n\n145.14.145[.]115 ip C&C IP\n\nkinaesthetic-electr.000webhostapp[.]com dns C&C\nDomain\n\n08cf8ed94cc1ef6ae23133f3e506a50d8aad9047c6fa74568a0373d991261aa4 sha256 Defray\nbinary\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Signatures**\n\n2827545     ETPRO TROJAN W32.Defray Ransomware Checkin\n\n2827635     ETPRO TROJAN Observed Malicious Domain SSL Cert in SNI (Defray Ransomware)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
