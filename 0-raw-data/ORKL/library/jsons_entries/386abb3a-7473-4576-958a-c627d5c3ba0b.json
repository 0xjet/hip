control systems.\n      Adhere to UFC 1-300-02 Unified Facilities Guide\n      Specifications (UFGS) Format Standard when editing\n      this guide specification or preparing new project\n      specification sections. Edit this guide\n      specification for project specific requirements by\n      adding, deleting, or revising text. For bracketed\n      items, choose applicable item(s) or insert\n      appropriate information.\n      Remove information and requirements not required in\n      respective project, whether or not brackets are\n      present.\n      Comments, suggestions and recommended changes for\n      this guide specification are welcome and should be\n      as a Criteria Change Request (CCR).\n**************************************************************************\n**************************************************************************\n      Note: Facility-related control systems are a subset\n      of control systems that are used to monitor and\n      control equipment and systems related to DoD real\n      property facilities (e.g., building control systems,\n      utility control systems, electronic security\n      systems, and fire and life safety systems). This\n      section includes Cybersecurity requirements to be\n      included on every DOD project which includes a\n      facility-related control system. This Section does\n      not provide general requirements for a control\n      system, nor are the requirements in this section\n      sufficient to procure a control system. This\n      section must be used in conjunction with another\n      controls system specification. For example, for a\n      HVAC controls project, this section should be used\n      in conjunction with Section 23 09 00 and related\n      sections.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n      Requirements and activities in this section must be\n      coordinated with the other relevant control\n      specification sections.\n      This section includes requirements in support of the\n      DOD Risk Management Framework (RMF) for implementing\n      cybersecurity. Refer to UFC 4-010-06, Cybersecurity\n      for Facility-Related Control Systems for\n      requirements on incorporating cybersecurity into\n      control system design and for general information on\n      the RMF process as it applies to control systems.\n      Assistance for control system cybersecurity is\n      available from the following Service organizations:\n        Army: Control System Cybersecurity Center of\n      Expertise,\n           Huntsville Engineering and Support Center\n        Navy: Naval Facilities Engineering Command, \n           Command Information Office (CIO)\n        Air Force: Civil Engineer Maintenance,\n             Inspection, and Repair Team (CEMIRT)\n             ICS Branch, Tyndall AFB\n        Marine Corps: Contact Navy POC for Marine Corps\n               POC information\n      Since this Section covers a wide range of control\n      systems, and those systems often have different\n      capabilities and requirements, there are\n      requirements identified in this Section which need\n      extensive designer input or decisions.\n      Many designer selections in this Section will\n      require coordination with the project site, System\n      Owner, Authorizing Official or a subject matter\n      expert in the specific control systems being\n      installed. \n**************************************************************************\n**************************************************************************\n      NOTE: This Section is for use on control systems\n      with no impact rating higher than LOW. If the\n      project includes systems where there systems with\n      impact ratings of MODERATE or HIGH, this\n      specification must be modified to include those\n      additional requirements.\n      Systems of different types at the same impact level\n      may have different requirements based on the\n      specific needs and capabilities of the control\n      system. This is addressed in this Guide\n      Specification by indicating when requirements apply\n      to a specific system type.\n      Systems of the same type may have different\n      requirements. This may be due to those systems\n      having different impact levels or due to\n      system-specific requirements for systems at the same\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n       impact level.\n       If a project includes multiple systems, it's\n       critical that it be clear which requirements apply\n       to which systems. This can be done by a) using a\n       single Section and specifying the applicability of\n       requirements or b) using multiple Sections. Which\n       approach to employ depends on the needs of the\n       project and the preferences of the specifier and\n       project manager. If using multiple sections use the\n       fourth level specification numbering to\n       differentiate the Sections and indicate in each\n       which systems the Section applies to.\n **************************************************************************\n **************************************************************************\n       NOTE: This specification makes use of SpecsIntact\n       Tailoring Options.\n       Services tailoring options:\n         Army\n         Air Force\n       Control system type tailoring options:\n         HVAC Control Systems\n         Electronic Security Systems (ESS)\n **************************************************************************\nPART 1  GENERAL\n **************************************************************************\n       NOTE: This subpart points the contractor to the\n       locations of STIGs and SRGs, as this Section\n       requires the contractor to meet available STIGs or\n       SRGs. It's not necessary for the designer/specifier\n       to review the STIGs or SRGs for applicability. The\n       contractor is responsible for determining which\n       STIGs or SRGs are applicable and for meeting the\n       relevant requirements.\n **************************************************************************\n Many subparts in this Section contain text in curly braces (\"{\" and \"}\")\n indicating which cybersecurity control and control correlation identifier\n (CCI) the requirements of the subpart relate to. The text inside these\n curly braces is for Government reference only, and enables coordination of\n the requirements of this Section with the RMF process throughout the design\n and construction process. Text in curly braces are not contractor\n requirements.\n This Section refers to Security Requirements Guide (SRGs) and Security\n Technical Implementation Guide (STIGs). STIGs and SRGs are are available\n online at the Information Assurance Support Environment (IASE) website at \n http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/index.aspx.

A device lacking a network\n transceiver (and accompanying protocol implementation) can never be\n considered network connected. Note that a device connected to a non-IP\n network is still considered network connected (an IP connection or IP\n address is not required for a device to be network connected).\n Any device that supports wireless communication is network connected,\n regardless of whether the device is communicating using wireless.\n1.4.3  User Account Support Levels\n The support for user accounts is categorized in this Section as one of\n three levels: \n1.4.3.1  FULLY Supported\n Device supports configurable individual accounts. Accounts can be created,\n deleted, modified, etc. Privileges can be assigned to accounts.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n1.4.3.2  MINIMALLY Supported\n Device supports a small, fixed number of accounts (perhaps only one). \n Accounts cannot be modified. A device with only a \"User\" and an\n \"Administrator\" account would fit this category. Similarly, a device with\n two PINs for logon - one for restricted and one for unrestricted rights\n would fit here (in other words, the accounts do not have to be the\n traditional \"user name and password\" structure).\n1.4.3.3  NOT Supported\n Device does not support any Access Enforcement therefore the whole concept\n of \"account\" is meaningless.\n1.4.4  User Interface\n Generally, a user interface is hardware on a device allowing user\n interaction with that device via input (buttons, switches, sliders,\n keyboard, touch screen, etc.) and a screen. There are three types of user\n interfaces defined in this Section: Limited Local User Interface, Full\n Local User Interface and Remote User Interface. In this Section, when the\n term \"User Interface\" is used without specifying which type, it refers only\n to Full Local User Interface and Remote User Interface (NOT to Limited\n Local User Interface).\n1.4.4.1  Limited Local User Interface\n A Limited Local User Interface is a user interface where the interaction is\n limited, fixed at the factory, and cannot be modified in the field. The\n user must be physically at the device to interact with it.\n Examples of Limited Local User Interface include thermostats (Space Sensor\n Modules as defined in Section 23 09 13 INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL DEVICES\n FOR HVAC).\n1.4.4.2  Full Local User Interface\n A Full Local User Interface is a user interface where the interaction and\n displays are field-configurable.\n Examples of a Full Local User Interface include local applications on a\n computer and user interfaces to Variable Speed Drives.\n1.4.4.3  Remote User Interface\n A Remote User Interface is a user interface on a Client device allowing\n user interaction with a different Server device. The user need not be\n physically at the Server device to interact with it.\n Examples of Remote User Interfaces include web browsers and Local Display\n Panels as defined in Section 23 09 00 INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL FOR HVAC.\n1.5  ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS\n1.5.1  Coordination\n **************************************************************************\n       NOTE: This subpart deals with coordination\n       requirements for the contractor, and does not\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n      indicate coordination that must be done by the\n      designer/specifier. In addition to the normal\n      project coordination, authorization for wireless\n      use, alternate account lock permissions and devices\n      with multiple IP connections may be impacted by site\n      (or Service) policies and need to be coordinated\n      with the appropriate Government representatives\n      before authorization is provided.\n**************************************************************************\nCoordinate the execution of this Section with the execution of all other\nSections related to control systems as indicated in the paragraph RELATED\nREQUIREMENTS. Items that must be considered when coordinating project\nefforts include but are not limited to:\n\n```\n```\na. If requesting permission for wireless communication, the Wireless\n\n```\n```\nCommunication Request submittal must be approved prior to control\nsystem device selection and integration.\n\n```\n```\nb. If requesting permission for alternate account lock permissions, the\n  Device Account Lock Exception Request must be approved prior to control\n  system device selection and integration.\n\n```\n```\nc. If requesting permission for the use of a device with multiple IP\n\n```\n```\nconnections, the Multiple IP Connection Device Request must be approved\nprior to control system device selection and integration.\n\n```\n```\nd. Wireless testing may be required as part of the control system\n\n```\n```\ntesting. See requirements for the Wireless Communication Test Report\nsubmittal.\n\n```\n```\ne. If the Device Audit Record Upload Software is to be installed on a\n\n```\n```\ncomputer not being provided as part of the control system, coordination\nis required to identify the computer on which to install the software.\n\n```\n```\nf. Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule must be coordinated with other\n\n```\n```\n  work that will be interconnected to, and interconnections must be\n  approved by the Government before relying on them for system\n  functionality.\ng. Cybersecurity testing support must be coordinated across control\n  systems and with the Government cybersecurity testing schedule.\nh. Passwords must be coordinated with the indicated contact for the\n  project site.\n\n```\n```\ni. If applicable, HTTP web server certificates must be obtained from the\n  indicated contact for the project site.\n\n```\n```\n j. Contractor Computer Cybersecurity Compliance Statements for each\n    contractor using contractor owned computers.\n1.6  SUBMITTALS\n **************************************************************************\n       NOTE: Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions\n       in Section 01 33 00 SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit\n       the following list to reflect only the submittals\n       required for the project.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n      The Guide Specification technical editors have\n      designated those items that require Government\n      approval, due to their complexity or criticality,\n      with a \"G.\" Generally, other submittal items can be\n      reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control\n      System.

The site IT staff should implement\n       boundary protection via rules (e.g. a firewall)\n       isolating the control system from the wider\n       network. This is true even for a control system\n       which will be later integrated to a larger system;\n       the field point of connection (FPOC) should be\n       configured to allow the minimum traffic necessary\n       for operation. Critical to this is the\n       Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule, which\n       defines what traffic must be allowed through the\n       boundary for the proper operation of the system.\n       Note that reducing the dependence on the network\n       helps mitigate threats caused by a weak boundary\n       defense.\n **************************************************************************\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n {For Reference Only: This subpart (and its subparts) relates to SC-5,\n SC-39, SC-7(a); CCI-001093, CCI-002385, CCI-002386, CCI-002430, CCI-001097}\n To the greatest extent practical, implement control logic in non-computer\n hardware and without reliance on the network.\n[3.10.2  Cryptographic Protection\n **************************************************************************\n       NOTE: With regard to cryptography, there are 3\n       possibilities to consider:\n         1.

First, confirm that the system truly\n       needs to contain classified information - if this is\n       only to fulfil some reporting requirement, consider\n       removing the information from the CS and meeting the\n       reporting requirement via some other means. If the\n       requirement for cryptography cannot be eliminated,\n       select text requiring cryptography.\n       In generally, the need for cryptography should be\n       avoided, or at least minimized. (Note that even for\n       systems where cryptography is required, it may not\n       be required at every node and interconnection in the\n       system.) \n       If cryptography is required, select whether to\n       require it everywhere, only on the IP network, or\n       only at specific locations within the system.\n **************************************************************************\n {For Reference Only: This subpart (and its subparts) relates to SC-13;\n CCIs: CCI-002449, CCI-002450}\n For devices that have STIG/SRGs related to cryptographic protection\n (CCI-002450), comply with the requirements of those STIG/SRGs.
