According to Google Play’s data, the apps has so far been downloaded between\n3 million and 7 million times.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nDubbed ‘AdultSwine’, these malicious apps wreak havoc in three possible ways:\n\n1. Displaying ads from the web that are often highly inappropriate and pornographic.\n2. Attempting to trick users into installing fake ‘security apps’.\n3. Inducing users to register to premium services at the user’s expense.\n\nApart from these current three main activities, the malicious code can use its infrastructure to\nbroaden its goals to other purposes, such as credential theft.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: AdultSwine operation flow_**\n\nOnce the malicious app is installed on the device, it waits for a boot to occur or for a user to\nunlock his screen, upon which it initiates its malicious activity.\n\n**Illegitimate and Inappropriate Ads**\n\nFirst, the malicious code contacts its Command and Control server (C&C) to report the\nsuccessful installation, sends data about the infected device and then receives the\nconfigurations, which determine its course of operation. These configurations instruct it on\nwhether to hide its icon (to encumber removal), which ads to display, over which apps and on\nwhat terms. It is interesting to note that the server however forbids ads to be displayed over\ncertain apps such as browsers and social networks, in order to avoid suspicion.\n\nThe malicious code then verifies certain conditions regarding the device’s status and checks\nwhich app is currently running on screen. Once all its terms are met, it begins to display the\nillegitimate ads outside of the app’s context. If it is embedded inside a web browser app the\nads will be displayed inside that browser, if not they will be displayed inside a designated\nweb view.\n\nAs for the ads being displayed, they come from two main sources; the first is that of the main\nad providers, which forbid such illegitimate display of their ads. The second is the malicious\ncode’s own ad library, which contains ads of an offensive nature, including pornographic ads.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll these are displayed to children while playing the game that the app is masquerading as.\n\nBelow is a mild example of the ads presented and a comment from one of the victims, whose\nson had an unfortunate experience.\n\n**_Figure 2: Examples of ad displayed and user reviews on_**\n_Google Play_\n\n**Scareware – Deceptive App Install Tactics**\n\nAnother course of action the malicious app pursues is scaring\nusers into installing unnecessary and even harmful “security”\napps.\n\nFirst, the malicious app displays an ad that claims the user’s\ndevice is infected by a virus. Should the user press the\nnotification of “Remove Virus Now” he is redirected to an app\nin the Google Play Store with a somewhat questionable\nconnection to virus removal. An experienced eye could easily\nforesee this tactic, though a child playing a game app is easy\nprey for such nefarious apps.\n\n**_Figure 3 – Left image: Scareware Ad_**\n_Displayed_\n_Centre image: The redirect ‘anti-virus’ app_\n_in Google Play._\n_Right image: User reviews in Google Play_\n\n**Registering To Premium Services**\n\nAnother technique used by the malicious\napp is registering to premium services and\ncharging the victim’s account for\nfraudulent premium services they did not\nrequest to send or receive. In a similar way to\nthe scareware tactic seen above, the malicious\napp initially displays a pop-up ad, which\nattempts to persuade the user to click through.\n\nThis time however, the ad claims that the user is\nentitled to win an iPhone by simply answering\nfour short questions. Should the user answer\nthem, the malicious code informs the user that\nhe has been successful, and asks him to enter his phone number to receive the prize. Once\nentered, the malicious code then uses this number to register to premium services.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe flow is presented in the images below.\n\n_Notification of Winning the iPhone_ _Request to Enter Phone_\n_Number_\n\n**A Comprehensive Threat**\n\nAlthough for now this malicious app seems to be a nasty\nnuisance, and most certainly damaging on both an emotional and\nfinancial level, it nevertheless also has a potentially much wider\nrange of malicious activities that it can pursue, all relying on the\nsame common concept.\n\nThe malicious code simply receives a target link from its\n\nCommand and Control server and displays it to the user. While in\nsome cases this link is merely an advertisement, it could also lead\nto whatever social engineering scheme the hacker has in mind.\n\nIndeed, these plots continue to be effective even today, especially\nwhen they originate in apps downloaded from trusted sources\nsuch as Google Play.\n\n**Appendix 1 – List of App Names**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**App Name**
