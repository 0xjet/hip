But in this blog\nentry, we discuss how the use of the RomCom backdoor in recent attacks shows how Void\nRabisu's motives seem to have changed since at least October 2022.\n\nBy: Feike Hacquebord, Stephen Hilt, Fernando Merces, Lord Alfred Remorin\nMay 30, 2023\nRead time: ( words)\n\n_With contributions from Veronica Chierzi and Jayvee Mark Villaroman_\n\nSince the start of [the war in Ukraine in February 2022, the number of cyber campaigns](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/russian-forces-invade-ukraine.html)\nagainst Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries has increased\nsignificantly. These campaigns come from many different angles: known advanced persistent\nthreat (APT) actors, APT actors that were not publicly reported on before, and cyber\nmercenaries, hacktivists, and criminal actors who appear to have shifted from purely financial\nmotives to geopolitical goals. In the past, these actors had different motivations, mode of\noperations, and targets, but the line between their campaigns has started to blur: Not only is\nan overlap in their targeting becoming apparent, but the distinction between their modes of\noperation is less clear. For instance, in 2022, one of [Conti’s affiliates was found to be using](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti)\n[its initial access techniques against Ukraine instead of using them to spread ransomware.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/Ransomware)\n\nAnother example of this is Void Rabisu, also known as Tropical Scorpius, an actor believed\n[to be associated with Cuba ransomware and the RomCom backdoor. Because of its many](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-cuba)\nransomware attacks, Void Rabisu was believed to be financially motivated, even though its\n[associated Cuba ransomware allegedly attacked the parliament of Montenegro in August](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/montenegro-blames-criminal-gang-cyber-attacks-government-2022-08-31/)\n2022, which could be considered part of a geopolitical agenda. The motives of Void Rabisu\nseem to have changed since at least October 2022, when Void Rabisu’s associated\nRomCom backdoor was reported to have been used in attacks against the Ukrainian\ngovernment and military: In a campaign in December 2022, a fake version of the Ukrainian\narmy’s DELTA situational awareness website was used to lure targets into installing the\nRomCom backdoor. Normally, this kind of brazen attack would be thought to be the work of a\n\n\n-----\n\nnation state-sponsored actor, but in this case, the indicators clearly pointed towards Void\nRabisu, and some of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used were typically\nassociated with cybercrime.\n\nTrend Micro’s telemetry and research corroborates that the RomCom backdoor has been\nused in geopolitically motivated attacks since at least October 2022, with targets that\nincluded organizations in Ukraine’s energy and water utility sectors. Targets outside of\nUkraine were observed as well, such as a provincial local government that provides help to\nUkrainian refugees, a parliament member of a European country, a European defense\ncompany, and various IT service providers in Europe and the US. Independent research from\nGoogle showed that RomCom was being used in campaigns against attendees of the\nMasters of Digital conference, a conference organized by DIGITALEUROPE, and the Munich\nSecurity Conference.\n\nIn this blog entry, we will discuss how the use of the RomCom backdoor fits into the current\nlandscape, where politically motivated attacks are not committed by nation-state actors\nalone. Even though we cannot confirm coordination between the different attacks, Ukraine\nand countries who support Ukraine are being targeted by various actors, like APT actors,\nhacktivists, cyber mercenaries, and cybercriminals like Void Rabisu. We will also delve into\nhow RomCom has evolved over time and how the backdoor is spread both by methods that\nlook like APT, as well as methods used by prominent cybercriminal campaigns taking place\ncurrently, to show that RomCom is using more detection evasion techniques that are popular\namong the most impactful cybercriminals.\n\nWe assess that RomCom makes use of the same third-party services that are being utilized\nby other criminal actors as well, like malware signing and binary encryption. RomCom has\nbeen spread through numerous lure sites that are sometimes set up in rapid bursts. These\nlure sites are most likely only meant for a small number of targets, thus making discovery\nand analysis more difficult. Void Rabisu is one of the most evident examples of financially\nmotivated threat actors whose goals and motivations are becoming more aligned under\nextraordinary geopolitical circumstances, and we anticipate that this will happen more in the\nfuture.\n\n**RomCom campaigns**\n\nWe have been tracking RomCom campaigns since the summer of 2022, and since then,\nhave seen an escalation in its detection evasion methods: Not only do the malware samples\nroutinely use VMProtect to make both manual and automated sandbox analysis more\ndifficult, they also utilize binary padding techniques on the payload files. This adds a\nsignificant amount of overlay bytes to the files, increasing the size of the malicious payload\n(we've seen a file with 1.7 gigabytes). Additionally, a new routine has been recently added\nthat involves the encryption of the payload files, which can only be decrypted if a certain key\nis downloaded to activate the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to these technical evasion techniques, RomCom is being distributed using lure\nsites that often appear legitimate and are being utilized in narrow targeting. This makes\nautomated blocking of these lure websites through web reputation systems harder. Void\nRabisu has been using Google Ads to entice their targets to visit the lure sites, similar to a\ncampaign that distributed IcedID botnet in December 2022. A key difference is that while\nIcedID’s targeting was wider, Void Rabisu probably opted for narrower targeting that Google\nAds offers to its advertisers. RomCom campaigns also make use of highly targeted spear\nphishing emails.\n\nOn the RomCom lure sites, targets are offered trojanized versions of legitimate applications,\nlike chat apps such as AstraChat and Signal, PDF readers, remote desktop apps, password\nmanagers, and other tools, that are typically used by system administrators.\n\ndirwinstat.com\n\n(as of April 4, 2023)\n\n\n-----\n\ndevolrdm.com\n\n(as of March 23, 2023)\n\nvectordmanagesoft.com\n\n(as of March 22, 2023)\n\n\n-----\n\ncozy-sofware.com\n\n(as of March 13, 2023)\n\ndevolutionrdp.com\n\n(as of March 6, 2023)\n\n\n-----\n\nastrachats.com\n\n(as of February 27,\n2023)\n\nchatgpt4beta.com\n\n(as of February 23,\n2023)\n\n\n-----\n\nsingularlabs.org\n\n(as of January 30,\n2023)\n\ngotomeet.us\n\n(as of December 14,\n2022)\n\n\n-----\n\ngllmp.com\n\n(as of December 8,\n2022)\n\nlnfo-messengers.com\n\n(as of November 3,\n2022)\n\n\n-----\n\npass-shield.com\n\n(as of October 15,\n2022)\n\npdffreader.com\n\n(as of October 12,\n2022)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nveeame.com\n\n(as of September, 9\n2022)\n\nnpm-solar.com\n\n(as of July 31, 2022)\n\n\n-----\n\nadvanced-ipscanners.com\n\n(as of July 20, 2022)\n\nTable 1. RomCom lure sites\n\nImage credit: [DomainTools](https://www.domaintools.com/)\n\n[As reported by the Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) in the fall of](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ukrainian-agencies-targeted-by-ransomware/)\n2022, RomCom was used in specific campaigns against Ukrainian targets, including the\nUkrainian government and the Ukrainian military. Trend Micro’s telemetry confirms this\ntargeting, and, as shown in a selection of the numerous RomCom campaigns over time\n(Table 1), it is immediately clear that RomCom already had Ukrainian-language social\nengineering lures back in October and November 2022.\n\nWe count a few dozen lure websites that have been set up since July 2022. RomCom shows\na mix in their targeting methodologies, mixing typical cybercriminal TTPs with TTPs that are\nmore common for APT actors. For example, RomCom used spear phishing against a\nmember of a European parliament in March 2022, but targeted a European defense\ncompany in October 2022 with a Google Ads advertisement that led to an intermediary\nlanding site that would redirect to a RomCom lure site. That intermediary landing site used\nthe domain name “kagomadb[.]com,” which was later used for Qakbot and Gozi payloads in\nDecember 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the targets we have seen based on Trend Micro s telemetry were a water utility\ncompany, entities in the financial and energy sectors, and an IT company in Ukraine. Outside\nUkraine, other targets included a local government agency that supports Ukrainian refugees,\na defense company in Europe, a high-profile European politician, several IT service\nproviders in Europe and the US, a bank in South America, and a couple of targets located in\nAsia. Combined with the targets that were published by CERT-UA and Google, a clear\npicture emerges of the RomCom backdoor’s targets: select Ukrainian targets and allies of\nUkraine.\n\n**RomCom 3.0: The AstraChat Campaign**\n\nIn this section, we will analyze one of the RomCom backdoor samples that was used in\nFebruary 2023 against targets in Eastern Europe. Previous RomCom versions analyzed by\nPalo Alto's Unit 42 use a modular architecture and support up to 20 different commands.\nSince then, the malware evolved significantly in terms of the number of supported\ncommands, but its modular architecture remains almost unchanged. The threat actor behind\nRomCom 3.0 also makes use of different techniques to drop and execute the malware. This\nanalysis is based on a campaign that embedded RomCom 3.0 in an AstraChat instant\nmessaging software installation package.\n\n**Dropper**\n\nThe file astrachat.msi is a Microsoft Installer (MSI) archive. Despite installing files related to\nlegitimate AstraChat software, it unpacks a malicious InstallA.dll file and calls its Main()\nfunction (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. CustomAction table from a RomCom MSI dropper\n\nThe InstallA.dll file extracts three Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) files under the\n_%PUBLIC%\\Libraries folder:_\n\n_prxyms<number>.dll_\n\n\n-----\n\n_winipfile<number>.dll0_\n_netid<number>.dll0_\n\nThe number in these DLL files is an integer number based on the Machine GUID read from\nWindows Registry at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nFor persistence, RomCom uses COM hijacking, hence its name. InstallA.dll writes the\nfollowing registry value in Windows Registry:\n\n_[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{C90250F3-4D7D-4991-9B69-_\n_A5C5BC1C2AE6}\\InProcServer32]_\n\n_@=\"%PUBLIC%\\\\Libraries\\\\prxyms<number>.dll\"_\n\nThis overwrites the same key under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive, causing processes\nthat request this Class ID (CLSID) to load the RomCom loader DLL at\n_%PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\prxyms<number>.dll. One such process is explorer.exe, which is_\nrestarted by RomCom dropper, so the loader DLL is called.\n\nThe RomCom loader also redirects calls to its exported functions to the legit actxprxy.dll by\nmaking use of forwarded exports (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Forwarded exports from the RomCom 3.0 loader (prxyms<number>.dll)\n\nHowever, before a call is forwarded, the malicious code at the DLL entry point of RomCom\nloader runs. This code uses rundll32.exe to execute the exported Main() function from both\n_winipfile<number>.dll0 and netid<number>.dll0._\n\n**Architecture**\n\nRomCom 3.0 is divided into three components: a loader, a network component that interacts\nwith the command-and-control (C&C) server, and a worker component that performs the\nactions on the victim’s machine. The network component is handled by netid<number>.dll0,\nwhich is responsible for receiving commands from the C&C server and sending back their\nresults. When this component receives a command, the command is sent through a\n\n\n-----\n\nlocalhost socket to winipfile<number>.dll0, which handles the worker component, as shown\nin Figure 3. If initial loopback addresses or ports are in use, both components try to find other\navailable combinations.\n\nFigure 3. Overall RomCom 3.0 architecture\n\n**Bot Commands**\n\nRomCom 3.0 commands are received as responses to HTTP POST requests made by the\nmalware network component.\n\nFigure 4. RomCom 3.0 command structure\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 shows an example of command 5 – a command to download a file to the victim s\nmachine – being received. The ID used for communication is 0x950, and command 0x05 is\nreceived with additional data. In this case, the additional data tells the malware running on\nthe infected machine that the downloaded file should occupy 939 (0x3ac – 1) 4KB blocks.\nThe file itself is downloaded in a separate response, so in this instance, the final file size on\nthe victim’s side will be 3,846,144 bytes. As an evasion technique, null bytes are appended\nto the file to achieve this result. The contents of the additional data field may vary according\nto the command.\n\nIn RomCom 3.0, we could enumerate 42 valid commands, as shown in Table 2. This is a\nhigh number of commands for a regular backdoor, but a few commands are simply variations\nof others.\n\n**Command** **Purpose (from the victim’s perspective)**\n\n1 Send information about connected drives\n\n2 Send a list of file names under a specified directory\n\n3 Start cmd.exe to run an existing program\n\n4 Upload a specified file to the C&C server\n\n5 Download a file to the victim's machine\n\n6 Delete a specified file in the victim's machine\n\n7 Delete a specified directory in the victim's machine\n\n8 Spawn a given process with PID spoofing (the PID is also given as part of\nthe command data)\n\n12 Call startWorker() from %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\PhotoDirector.dll, then send\n_%PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\PhotoDirector.zip to the C&C server and delete it_\n\n13 Call startWorker() from %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\PhotoDirector.dll and write\nscreen information to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\update.conf\n\n14 Upload %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\PhotoDirector.zip to the C&C server and delete\nit\n\n15 Send a list of running process with its PIDs\n\n16 Send a list of installed software\n\n17 Delete the worker component (winipfile<number>.dll0)\n\n18 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\PhotoDirector.dll\n\n\n-----\n\n19 Download a file, save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\BrowserData\\procsys.dll,\nand call its stub() exported function\n\n20 [Download a ZIP archive likely containing 3proxy and](https://3proxy.ru/) [plink (see command 21)](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)\n\n21 Use 3proxy and plink to set up a proxy via SSH. The IP address, password,\nlocal, and remote ports are received as command parameters. SSH server\nusername is fixed as “john.”\n\n22 Kill the 3proxy.exe and plink.exe processes\n\n23 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\upd-fil<number>.dll0 to\nupdate the worker\n\n24 Send the contents of %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\BrowserData\\Result\n\n25 Duplicate the worker\n\n26 Send the Windows version\n\n29 [Download freeSSHd from the C&C server](http://www.freesshd.com/)\n\n30 Run freeSSHd and use plink to create a reverse connection with\n51.195.49.215 using “john” as the username and\n“eK6czNHWCT569L1xK9ZH” as the password\n\n31 Kill the freeSSHd process\n\n32 Send .txt, .rtf, .xls, .xlsx, .ods, .cmd, .pdf, .vbs, .ps1, .one, .kdb, .kdb, .doc,\n.doc, .odt, .eml, .msg, and .email files in Downloads, Documents, and\nDesktop folders under %USERPROFILE%\n\n34 Run AnyDesk on the victim’s machine on a hidden window and send the\nAnyDesk ID to the C&C server\n\n35 Kill the AnyDesk process and delete its executable\n\n36 Download the AnyDesk executable and save it to\n_%PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\dsk.exe_\n\n38 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\wallet.exe\n\n39 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\7z.dll\n\n40 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\7z.exe\n\n41 Send the contents of %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\tempFolder compressed with 7Zip\n\n42 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\7za.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n43 Use %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\7za.exe to compress a given folder to a fold.zip\narchive and send the compressed archive to the C&C server\n\n44 Kill the PhotoDirector.dll process\n\n45 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\msg.dll\n\n46 Call stW() function exported by %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\msg.dll\n\n47 Download a file and save it to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\FileInfo.dll\n\n48 Call fSt() function exported by %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\FileInfo.dll\n\n49 Update the network component\n\nTable 2. RomCom 3.0 commands\n\n**Additional Malware**\n\nBased on messages sent back to the C&C server and how the commands use these files,\nwe can infer the purpose of a few additional components:\n\n**_PhotoDirector.dll – a program that takes one or more screenshots and compresses_**\nthem in a %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\PhotoDirector.zip archive\n**_procsys.dll – a stealer known as STEALDEAL to retrieve browser cookies and write_**\nthem to %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\BrowserData\\Result\n**_wallet.exe – a crypto wallet grabber that writes stolen information to_**\n_%PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\tempFolder_\n**_msg.dll – an Instant Messaging grabber to steal chat messages_**\n**_FileInfo.dll – a stealer of FTP credentials, or a component to make the victim’s_**\nmachine upload files to an FTP server\n\nDespite these additional pieces of malware, RomCom 3.0 also seems to have commands to\ndownload and run legitimate software:\n\n**_dsk.exe – a portable version of AnyDesk software_**\n**_7z.dll, 7z.exe, and 7za.exe – files related to the 7-Zip program_**\n\n**STEALDEAL**\n\nThe stealer that is downloaded through RomCom’s C&C servers is a relatively simple one\nthat steals stored credentials and browsing history from the following browsers:\n\nGoogle Chrome\nMicrosoft Edge\nMozilla Firefox\n\n\n-----\n\nChromium\nChrome Beta\nYandex Browser\n\nThe stealer also collects information on installed mail clients. The stolen data is stored locally\non the victim’s machine at %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\BrowserData\\Result, and through C&C\ncommand 24, this data is exfiltrated through a RomCom C&C server. We detected the\nstealer as TrojanSpy.Win64.STEALDEAL, which is also known as SneakyStealer.\n\n**Evasion Techniques**\n\nRomCom 3.0 binaries are protected with VMProtect. Some binaries are also signed with\nvalid certificates. Because the actors decided to use VMProtect’s anti-VM feature, any\nattempt to run it in a virtual machine (VM) without modification or VM hardening will cause\nthe malware to show an error message and exit (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5. Default VMProtect anti-VM detection in RomCom 3.0 samples\n\nAnother interesting technique RomCom uses is the ability to add null bytes appended to the\nfiles received from a C&C server. Making the file bigger can be an attempt to avoid sandbox\nproducts or security software scanners that impose a file size limit.\n\nIn later versions of RomCom, the binary that is hosted on a lure site contains an encrypted\npayload. To correctly decrypt the payload, it will need to reach out to a web server at the IP\naddress 94.142.138.244 and download the decryption key. We suspect this website is a\nthird-party service that is also being used by other malware, including the Vidar stealer that is\nalso known as StealC. Also, recent RomCom droppers have stopped dropping the worker\ncomponent. Instead, the network component downloads it from the C&C server.\n\n**Packet Structure and Communications Flow**\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our observations of the communication between victim machines and RomCom\nC&C servers, we were able to determine what the packet structure of this communication\nlooks like (Figure 6). Initially, the client will reach out to the server with information on the\nvictim’s computer, such as its Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), username, and the\ncomputer name. The server will then respond with a session ID that is four bytes long, as\nmentioned previously. This session ID is then incremented by one on the first byte by the\nC&C server with each command that is sent to the victim machine.\n\nFigure 6. Packet structure of the observed packets\n\nOne of the first commands we observed was command 3, which uses cmd.exe to run a\n_Nltest command with the argument /domain_trusts. This is done to gather information on any_\ndomains that the victim machine may know about. Once the command is finished, it returns\nthe results of the command with the Session ID five bytes in; the first four bytes are unknown\nat this time, but we observed the first byte will be 0x01 if it is returning data to the server, or\n0x00 if it is receiving data from the server. The C&C server then appears to ask for specific\ninformation in an automated manner, as the same requests are sent in quick succession\n(Figure 7). From our analysis, we have determined that the server is asking for the victim\nmachine to:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Return ntlest /domain_trusts with command 3\n2. Download StealDeal to collect certain information\n3. Use StealDeal to collect cookies and other information from the victim’s machine\n4. Collect files from the Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders using command 32\n\nFigure 7. Flow of the communication between the C&C server and victim machine\n\n**Use of fake companies and websites**\n\nThe malware uses certificates to lend credibility to the software that the targeted victims\ndownload. On the surface, the companies that are signing these binaries look like legitimate\ncompanies that have undergone the process of becoming a signer of these certificates.\nHowever, a closer look at these companies’ websites reveals several oddities, including nonexistent phone numbers, stock photos of executives, office addresses that do not seem to\nmatch. This leads us to believe these are either fake companies or legitimate companies that\nare being abused in order to pass the checks needed to become an authorized signer of\nbinaries.\n\nThe RomCom 3.0 sample that was used in the AstraChat campaign was signed by a\nCanadian company called Noray Consulting Ltd., which has a LinkedIn page (Figure 8), a\nwebsite, and even a listing in a business registry in Canada (Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Screenshot of Noray Consulting's LinkedIn page\n\nFigure 9. Ontario business registry search results for Noray Consulting\n\nThe company’s LinkedIn page goes on to mention that Noray Consulting works on SOX\ncompliance, an annual audit mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), as well as other\nareas of risk control. However, the LinkedIn page also points to a website, noray[.]ca, that\ndoes not exist.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the company claims to be based in Ontario according to its LinkedIn page, we looked for\nany information about it in public records for businesses in Canada. It appears that in 2020,\nthe owners of Noray Consulting. Changed the name of the company to just “Noray.” This new\ncompany name is not related to any of the things mentioned in this blog post or, from what\nwe can tell, is doing anything malicious. It appears that the actors are watching out for\ncompanies that become inactive, or in a similar status, then will appropriate these\ncompanies’ names.\n\nInternet searches for Noray Consulting show that its main website has a non-matching\ndomain name, firstbyteconsulting[.]com. The website used to be for a company that\nspecialized in project management. This domain appears to have expired in 2020, but was\nbought and repurposed to resemble the website from before 2020. What ties this domain to\nNoray Consulting now is that the address details on the website match that which is found on\nNoray Consulting’s LinkedIn page: a Canadian company in Milton, Ontario. The contact page\nhas a map that shows the company’s location, but the map is in Russian (Figure 10). This\ncould mean that the person who made this Google map had their primary language set to\nRussian, which would be unusual for a seemingly Canadian-based company.\n\nFigure 10. Screenshot of the website’s contact page map\n\nWe also found that the people mentioned on their website are likely stock images or AIgenerated photos of people who are not related in any way to the business, as shown in\nFigure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Screenshot of the website’s team members page\n\nFurther investigation reveals that Figure 11 has a number of red flags:\n\nNone of these people appear to have real personas on the internet\nReverse image search reveals these are stock photo images used on several sites\nTwo members of the team have the same job title of \"Manager, HR Process and\nCompensation\"\n\nWe have also observed that the text in other parts of Noray Consulting’s website has been at\nleast partially copied from other websites. This illustrates that these actors are trying to make\nthe sites believable, offering what seems like realistic services that were lifted from real\ncompanies found online.\n\nVoid Rabisu has had many lure websites that attempt to convince targets to download\ntrojanized legitimate applications. These lure sites look legitimate at first, but usually have\nsimilar oddities on the websites. For example, a site that had a business address of a\nshopping mall, and the contact phone number of a grocery store.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Screenshot of the contact information of a Void Rabisu lure site\n\nWe can link the two Canadian companies that were used to sign RomCom binaries in the\nAstraChat campaign and a campaign against the Ukrainian armed forces with more than 80\nother mostly Canadian companies in total, based on an analysis of internet infrastructure.\nAmong these 80 other mostly Canadian companies, about two dozen companies were used\n[to sign other malware binaries like Emotet, Matanbuchus Loader,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/e/bruised-but-not-broken--the-resurgence-of-the-emotet-botnet-malw.html) [BatLoader, another](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/a/batloader-malware-abuses-legitimate-tools-uses-obfuscated-javasc.html)\nbackdoor known as SolarMarker, and coinminers. This makes us believe that Void Rabisu is\nlikely to be using a third-party service that aids in signing binaries with certificates of\nseemingly legitimate Canadian companies.\n\n**Conclusions and Recommendations**\n\nThe war against Ukraine has made cyber campaigns against Ukraine, Eastern Europe, and\nNATO countries more visible for two reasons: the number of attacks has increased\ndramatically, and both the private and public sectors are looking closely at what happens in\n[Ukraine. More information from intelligence agencies is being declassified by Western](https://www.wsj.com/articles/release-of-secrets-represents-new-front-in-u-s-information-war-with-russia-11649070001)\ngovernments, so privately-owned companies can investigate further for themselves. Another\nimportant factor is that many actors who previously had different motivations are becoming\nmore aligned towards the same goal, even when their campaigns do not appear to be part of\na coordinated effort.\n\nThe line is blurring between cybercrime driven by financial gain and APT attacks motivated\nby geopolitics, espionage, disruption, and warfare. Since the rise of Ransomware-as-aService (RaaS), cybercriminals are now using advanced tactics and targeted attacks that\nwere previously thought to be the domain of APT actors. Inversely, tactics and techniques\nthat were previously used by financially motivated actors are increasingly being used in\nattacks with geopolitical goals.\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently, APT actors like [Pawn Storm and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/probing-pawn-storm-cyberespionage-campaign-through-scanning-credential-phishing-and-more) [APT29, cyber mercenaries like Void Balaur,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/d/mitre-evaluation2020.html)\n[hacktivism groups like Killnet, along with cybercriminals like former Conti affiliates and Void](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/ciso/23/b/cyber-risk-types-2023.html)\nRabisu, are targeting Ukraine and its allies, but their campaigns do not yet look coordinated.\nWe expect that significant geopolitical events like the current war against Ukraine will\naccelerate the alignment of the campaigns of threat actors who reside in the same\ngeographic region. This will lead to new challenges for defenders, as attacks can then come\nfrom many different angles, and it will be less clear who is the actor responsible for them.\n\nBased on our analysis, we believe the following activity should be monitored in endpoints:\n\nDownloading and executing MSI packages that contain entries in CustomAction tables\nreferring to DLL exported functions\nWriting access to SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\<CSLID> under both\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM), which can_\nbe a sign of COM hijacking\nInitiation of localhost sockets by rundll32.exe, as RomCom DLLs are loaded by this\nprocess — we observed that RomCom listens on the port range 5554-5600 when\nsetting up localhost sockets\nBinary padding with null bytes, a known technique to evade scanners. Although\nRomCom didn’t use this feature in our tests, it is present in command 5. We included a\n[YARA ruleset to look for such files in our GitHub research repository.](https://github.com/trendmicro/research/tree/main/romcom)\nBinary padding with non-zero data, which we observed in one sample when it was\ndropping another. This alone is not malicious, but it is worth flagging once detected for\nfurther investigation.\n\nEndpoint solutions like Trend Micro's [Smart Protection Suites and](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/complete-user-protection/index.html) Worry-Free Business\nSecurity solutions also offer protection for both users and businesses against threats like\nRomCom. These solutions come equipped with behavior-monitoring capabilities that enable\nthem to detect malicious files, scripts, and messages. They can also block all related\nmalicious URLs. Additionally, the [Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ solution includes an email](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/)\ninspection layer that can identify and protect enterprises from malicious attachments and\nURLs. By leveraging these powerful tools, users and businesses can effectively defend\nthemselves against the damaging effects of RomCom and other similar threats.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n[Download the full list of indicators here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/23/e/void-rabisu%E2%80%99s-use-of-romcom-backdoor-shows-a-growing-shift-in-threat-actors%E2%80%99-goals-/ioc-list-void-rabisus-use-of-romcom-backdoor-shows-a-growing-shift-in-threat-actors-goals.txt)\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n**ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nT1583.008 Acquire Infrastructure:\nMalvertising\n\nT1566.002 Phishing: Spear Phishing\nLink\n\nT1027.002 Obfuscated Files or\nInformation: Software\nPacking\n\nT1027.001 Obfuscated Files or\nInformation: Binary\nPadding\n\nT1546.015 Event Triggered Execution:\nComponent Object Model\nHijacking\n\n\nRomCom uses malvertising to redirect targets\nto lure websites from which to download fake\ninstaller applications\n\nRomCom sent highly targeted spear phishing\nemails\n\nRomCom uses VMProtect\n\nRomCom uses binary padding on dropped files\nto avoid security solutions\n\nRomCom uses COM hijacking for persistence\n\n\nT1571 Non-Standard Port RomCom listens on port ranges 5554 to 5600\nfor communication between dropped\ncomponents\n\n\nT1071.001 Application Layer Protocol:\nWeb Protocols\n\nT1555.003 Credentials from Password\nStores: Credentials from\nWeb Browsers\n\n\nRomCom uses HTTPS for C&C\ncommunications\n\nRomCom uses a stealer to gather credentials\nof several browsers\n\n\nT1113 Screen Capture RomCom can capture screenshots of the\nvictim's machine\n\nT1219 Remote Access Software RomCom's backdoor has a functionality to run\nAnyDesk application\n\n\n-----",
