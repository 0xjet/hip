In fact, a new network reconnaissance group— FireEye\ncalls them Advanced Persistent Threat 34—has spent the last few years burrowing deep into\ncritical infrastructure companies.\n\nGiven how aggressively Iran has pursued infrastructure hacking, previously targeting the\n[financial sector and even a dam in upstate New York, the new findings serve as a warning,](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/feds-set-risky-precedent-indicting-7-iranian-hackers/)\nand highlight the evolving nature of the threat.\n\nFireEye researchers tracked 34 of the group's attacks on institutions in seven Middle Eastern\ncountries between 2015 and mid-2017, but says APT 34 has been operational since at least\n2014. The group appears to target financial, energy, telecommunications, and chemical\n\n\n-----\n\ncompanies, and FireEye says it has moderate confidence that its hackers are Iranians. They\nlog into VPNs from Iranian IP addresses, adhere to normal Iranian business hours, their work\nhas occasionally leaked Iranian addresses and phone numbers, and their efforts align with\nIranian interests. Namely, targeting the country's adversaries.\n\nNew APT in Town\n\n[There isn't definitive evidence of a direct link between APT 34 and APT 33, an Iranian](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-apt33/)\nhacking group and malware distributor FireEye published findings on in September. But\nresearchers have seen APT 34 operating concurrently inside many of the same target\nnetworks as other Iranian hackers.\n\n'The more we divulge things we know about them, the more they’ll shift and change.'\n\nJeff Bardin, Treadstone 71\n\n\"We have seen, and this is with a lot of the Iranian actors, a very disconcerting or aggressive\nposture towards critical infrastructure organizations,\" says John Hultquist, director of\nintelligence analysis at FireEye. \"APT 33 has targeted a lot of organizations in critical\ninfrastructure in the Middle East and so has APT 34. They obviously represent opportunities\nfor intelligence collection. But we always have to think about the alternative use of those\nintrusions or accesses as possible means for disruption and destruction, especially given the\ndestructive incidents we’ve already seen with other Iranian actors.\"\n\nTo establish what Hultquist describes as beachheads, APT 34 uses involved operations to\nmove deeper and deeper into a network, or exploit a toehold within one organization to pivot\ninto another. FireEye has observed the group compromising someone's email account at a\ntarget company, rifling through their archive, and restarting threads as old as a year, to trick\nthe recipient into clicking a malicious attachment. The hackers also use compromised email\naccounts to spearphish other companies, and leapfrog into their systems as well.\n\nWhile the APT 34 Iranian hacking activity doesn't appear to target the United States, any\nIranian efforts in that space are noteworthy. The countries have a long history of cyber\n[antagonism, which includes the deployment of Stuxnet, malware thought to be a product of](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/)\nthe NSA and their Israeli counterparts, to cripple Iran's uranium enrichment activities.\nTensions between the countries have escalated recently as well, with President Donald\n[Trump recently taking steps to decertify the nuclear agreement between the US and Iran.](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-iran-decertify-cyberattacks/)\n\n'A Multilayered Approach'\n\n[APT 34 uses malicious Excel macros and PowerShell-based exploits to move around](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-powershell-security/)\nnetworks. The group also has fairly extensive social media operations, deploying fake or\ncompromised accounts to scope out high-profile targets, and using social engineering to get\ncloser to particular organizations. FireEye researchers speculate that APT 34 may be a\nreconnaissance and persistence unit, focused on finding ways into new networks and\n\n\n-----\n\nbroadening access within existing targets. Some evidence indicates that the group may work\ndirectly for the Iranian government, but it's also possible that the hackers are effectively\ncontractors, selling backdoors to the government as they find them.\n\n\"When you look at this, it’s a multilayered approach,\" says Jeff Bardin, the chief intelligence\nofficer of the threat-tracking firm Treadstone 71, which monitors Iranian hacking activity.\n\"They get in and make a lot of modifications, download new malware, manipulate the\nmemory, so it’s definitely pretty sophisticated. And the Powershell activity has been largely a\nhallmark of Iranian activity lately. They change their tactics constantly. The more we divulge\nthings we know about them, the more they’ll shift and change.\"\n\nThough much remains unknown about APT 34, its capabilities and prowess make the\ngroup's interest in critical infrastructure targets all the more noteworthy, whether it's tasked\nwith carrying out full operations itself, or charged with laying the groundwork for others to do\nso.\n\n\"This is yet another example of Iranian cyber capability, which only seems to grow every\nday,\" FireEye's Hultquist says. \"It’s a challenge for people who are concerned with Iranian\nactors, and as geopolitics shifts, the number of people who should be concerned with Iranian\nactors will probably only increase.\"\n\n\n-----",
