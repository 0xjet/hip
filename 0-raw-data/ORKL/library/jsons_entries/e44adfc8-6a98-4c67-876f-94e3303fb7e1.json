While Carbanak focused primarily on banks, Fin7 targeted](https://securelist.com/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/68732/)\nmostly businesses, potentially making off with millions of dollars in financial assets, such as\npayment card credentials or account information on the computers of financial departments.\nOnce the threat actors got what they needed, they wired money to offshore accounts.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab’s new investigation, the group has continued its activity - despite\nthe arrest last year of alleged group leaders - implementing sophisticated spear-phishing\ncampaigns throughout 2018 and distributing malware to each target through specially\ntailored emails. In different cases, the operators exchanged messages with their intended\nvictims over a period of weeks before finally sending the malicious documents as\nattachments. Kaspersky Lab estimates that by the end of 2018, more than 130 companies\nmight have been targeted in this way.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe researchers also discovered other criminal teams operating under the Fin7 umbrella.\nThe use of shared infrastructure and the same tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs),\nshows that Fin7 is likely to be collaborating with the AveMaria botnet and groups known as\nCobaltGoblin/EmpireMonkey, believed to be behind bank robberies in Europe and Central\nAmerica.\n\nKaspersky Lab also found that Fin7 has created a fake company that claims to be a\nlegitimate cybersecurity vendor with offices across Russia. The company website is\nregistered to the server that Fin7 uses as a Command and Control center (C&C). The fake\nbusiness has been used to recruit unsuspecting freelance vulnerability researchers, program\ndevelopers and interpreters through legitimate online job sites. It seems that some of the\nindividuals working in these fake companies did not suspect that they were involved in a\ncybercrime business, with many including the experience of working in the organizations in\ntheir CVs.\n\n_“Modern cyberthreats can be compared to the mythical creature Hydra of Lerna – you cut off_\n_one of its heads and it grows two new ones. Therefore, the best way to protect yourself from_\n_such actors is to implement advanced, multi-layered protection: install all software patches_\n_as soon as they are released and do regular security analysis across all networks, systems_\n_and devices,” said Yury Namestnikov, security researcher at Kaspersky Lab._\n\nTo reduce the risk of infection, users are advised to:\n\nUse security solutions with dedicated functionality aimed at detecting and blocking\nphishing attempts. Businesses can protect their on-premise email systems with\n[targeted applications inside the Kaspersky Endpoint Security for BusinessKaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/endpoint-advanced)\nSecurity for Microsoft Office 365 helps to protect the cloud-based mail service\nExchange Online inside the Microsoft Office 365 suite.\nIntroduce security awareness training and teach practical skills.

But Kaspersky Lab\nresearchers have detected a number of new attacks by the same groups using GRIFFON\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles Press Releases\n\n## Share of high severity cybersecurity incidents facing organizations increases by half in a year\n\nResearch based on the analysis of incidents reported to customers of Kaspersky\nManaged Detection and Response (MDR) has revealed that the share of critical\nincidents experienced by organizations increased from one-in-ten (9%) in 2020, to onein-seven (14%) in 2021.\n\n[Read More >](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_share-of-high-severity-cybersecurity-incidents-facing-organizations-increases-by-half-in-a-year)\n## Kaspersky research finds third-party automotive apps bear significant privacy risks\n\nMobile applications for connected cars provide various features to make life easier for\nmotorists, but they can also be a source of risk. Kaspersky experts have analyzed 69\npopular third-party mobile applications designed to control connected cars and defined\nthe main threats drivers may face while using them. They found out that more than half\n(58%) of these applications use the vehicle owners’ credentials without asking for their\nconsent. On top of this, one in five of the applications have no contact information,\nwhich makes it impossible to report a problem. These and other findings are published\nin the new Kaspersky Connected Apps report.\n\n[Read More >](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_kaspersky-research-finds-third-party-automotive-apps-bear-significant-privacy-risks)\n## AV-TEST finds Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection stands out for its streaming capabilities\n\nKaspersky VPN Secure Connection was awarded among the best VPNs for streaming,\ngaming and torrenting for private users by AV-TEST, the independent IT security\ninstitute.\n\n[Read More >](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_av-test-finds-kaspersky-vpn-secure-connection-stands-out-for-its-streaming-capabilities)\n\n\n-----",
