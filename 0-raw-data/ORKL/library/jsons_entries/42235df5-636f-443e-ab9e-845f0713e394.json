The ransomware was previously used in](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-does-ransomware-work/)\n[the high-profile infection encrypting computers in the City of Greenville and most recently in](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/05/07/baltimore-city-government-computer-virus/)\nthe [City of Baltimore. It was originally coded in the Go programming language and compiled](https://statescoop.com/robinhood-ransomware-knocks-out-city-services-in-baltimore/)\nto a 32-bit executable. In this technical analysis, we will explore the `main_CoolMaker`\nfunctions meant to disable the machine and interrupt backup and other PC vital services.\n\n## Overview of RobinHood Ransomware\n\nRobinHood is a malware that encrypts the victim’s hard drive with the RSA+AES\ncryptographical combination and instructs the victim to reach out to them via Onion Tor\nwebsite. The RobinHood ransomware drops the victim notification file on the desktop\ndetailing the demands and how to make contact.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce contact is made, the attackers claim they will make a decryption tool available, thereby\nallowing the victim to recover their precious files, in return for payments made in bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, it is unclear what the initial infection vector is. There is only one confirmed\nRobinHood Golang ransomware that we know of so far. It is also notable that the\nransomware does not spread within the network; quite the opposite, it drops all Windows\nshares via “cmd.exe /c net use * /DELETE /Y”. That likely means that the ransomware is\npushed on each machine individually after the initial network breach via the `psexec and/or`\nthe domain controller.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Update (July 26):_** Since this analysis, others have claimed that Robinhood was\n[leveraging EternalBlue as a means to propagate. Those claims are incorrect, and it](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/eternalblue-nsa-developed-exploit-just-wont-die/)\nhas now [been confirmed by the City of Baltimore that Robinhood ransomware was not](https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/city-baltimore-faq)\nexploiting #EternalBlue/#BlueKeep vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-0708).\n\nThe ransomware expects to read “C:windowstemppub.key”, and if the file is not found, the\nsample terminates. This suggests a possible antidote of creating and saving a “pub.key” file\nin “C:windowstemp” with no read or write privileges, which would cause the ransomware to\nabort its initial execution in its current known setup.\n\nThe ransomware contains the following debug artifacts:\n\n```\nC:/Users/valery/go/src/oldboy/main.go\n\n```\n\nIt is also notable that the ransomware contains full debugging capabilities to write logs to\n“C:windowstemprbf.log”; however, the ransomware was compiled with\n```\nmain_EnableEventLogDATA disabled, but it could be patched to retrieve and activate this\n\n```\nfeature.\n\n\n-----\n\n## RobinHood Ransomware’s CoolMaker Function\n\nRobinHood ransomware’s `main_CoolMaker function contains a plethora of subfunctions`\nmeant to disable and disrupt the victim’s PC backups and services. Some of the most\ninteresting Golang functions are stored here, with names riddled with expletives. These are\nresponsible for actions such as deleting shadow copies via the impolitely named\n```\nShadowFucks function (vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet and WMIC shadowcopy\n\n```\ndelete), `RecoveryFCK (Bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no, Bcdedit.exe /set`\n{default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures), and `ServiceFuck (cmd.exe /c sc.exe stop <list`\nof services).\n\nAside from these, the somewhat more temperately named `wevtutil (wevtutil.exe cl`\nApplication, wevtutil.exe cl Security, and wevtutil.exe cl System.exe) is also found here,\nwhich functions to clear logs.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nWhile the RobinHood ransomware does not appear to be sophisticated, it does include\nhigher-level Go programming language code, and its related network intrusions are more\ninteresting as they targeted large government entities such as City of Greenville and City of\n[Baltimore, a tactic reminiscent of previous SamSam ransomware attacks demanding high](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/samsam-ransomware-hit-city-atlanta-systems/)\npayouts with individual ransoms set per machine.\n\nThe group behind this ransomware and its attacks may prove to be more interesting than the\nransomware itself due to the apparent well-planned and orchestrated network intrusions prior\nto the deployment of their new Go ransomware. It’s reasonable to assume that we can\nexpect to see more attacks from this [threat actor on public institutions that fail to implement a](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/threat-actor-basics-understanding-5-main-threat-types/)\n[ransomware-resistant security solution.](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\n\n### Read more about Cyber Security\n\n[Ursnif – A Polymorphic Delivery Mechanism Explained](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ursnif-polymorphic-delivery-mechanism-explained/)\n[Asus ShadowHammer Episode – A Custom Made Supply Chain Attack](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/asus-shadowhammer-story-custom-made-supply-chain-attack/)\n[7 Reasons To Move Away From Legacy AV](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/7-reasons-to-move-away-from-legacy-av/)\n[How Malware Can Easily Defeat Apple’s macOS Security](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/malware-can-easily-defeat-apples-macos-security/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[What Is Windows PowerShell (And Could It Be Malicious)?](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/windows-powershell-malicious/)\n\n\n-----",
