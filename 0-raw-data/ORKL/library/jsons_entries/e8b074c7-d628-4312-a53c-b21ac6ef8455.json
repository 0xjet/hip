The presence of a phone number in the data does alone not reveal whether a\ndevice was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack – technical examination of\nthe phone’s data is needed for that.\n\nIndependent digital forensic analysis conducted by Amnesty International’s Security Lab on\n10 Indian phones whose numbers were present in the data showed signs of either an\nattempted or successful Pegasus hack.\n\nOf equal importance is how the results the forensic analysis threw up shows sequential\ncorrelations between the time and date a phone number is entered in the list and the\nbeginning of surveillance The gap usually ranges between a few minutes and a couple of\n\n\n-----\n\nhours. In some cases, including forensic tests conducted for two India numbers, the time\nbetween a number appearing on the list and the successful detection of a trace of Pegasus\ninfection is just seconds.\n\nPegasus is sold by\nthe Israeli company,\nNSO Group, which\nsays it only offers its\nspyware to “vetted\ngovernments”. The\ncompany refuses to\nmake its list of\ncustomers public but\nthe presence of\nPegasus infections\nin India, and the\nrange of persons\nthat may have been\nselected for targeting, strongly indicate that the agency operating the spyware on Indian\nnumbers is an official Indian one.\n\nTwo founding editors of The Wire are on this list, as is its diplomatic editor and two of its\nregular contributors, including Rohini Singh. Singh’s number appears after she filed back-toback reports on the business affairs of home minister Amit Shah’s son, Jay Shah, and Nikhil\nMerchant, a businessman who is close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and while she was\ninvestigating the dealings of a prominent minister, Piyush Goyal, with businessman Ajay\nPiramal.\n\n[Also read: Read: NSO Group’s Response to the Pegasus Project and Our Take](https://thewire.in/tech/pegasus-project-nso-response)\n\nThe number of former Indian Express journalist Sushant Singh appears on the list in mid2018, at a time when he was working on an investigation into the controversial Rafale aircraft\ndeal with France, besides other stories. Digital forensics conducted on Singh’s current phone\nshowed signs of Pegasus infection earlier this year.\n\n**Leaked data, NSO disputes purpose**\n\nThe France-based media non-profit, Forbidden Stories, and Amnesty International first had\naccess to this leaked list which they shared with The Wire and 15 other news organisations\nworldwide as part of a lengthy collaborative investigation called the Pegasus Project.\n\nWorking together, these news organisations – which include The Guardian, The Washington\n_Post, Le Monde and Suddeutsche Zeitung – were able to independently identify the owners_\nof over 1,571 numbers across at least 10 countries, and forensically examine a small cross\n\n-----\n\nsection of phones associated with these numbers to test for the presence of Pegasus.\n\nNSO disputes the claim that the leaked list is linked in any way to the functioning of its\nspyware. In a letter to The Wire and Pegasus Project partners, the company initially said it\nhad “good reason to believe” that the leaked data was “not a list of numbers targeted by\ngovernments using Pegasus”, but instead, may be part of “a larger list of numbers that might\nhave been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”.\n\nHowever, the forensic testing of targeted phones has confirmed the use of Pegasus spyware\nagainst some of the Indian numbers on this list and has also established that this highly\nintrusive form of surveillance – technically illegal under Indian law as it involves hacking – is\nstill being used to spy on journalists and others.\n\n**Pegasus and India**\n\nFounded in 2010, the NSO Group is best known for having created Pegasus, which allows\nthose operating it to remotely hack into smartphones and gain access to their contents and\nfunctions, including the microphone and camera. The company has always insisted Pegasus\nis not sold to private entities or even to any and every government. In fact, in its letter to The\n_Wire and its media partners, NSO reiterated that it sells its spyware only to “vetted_\ngovernments”.\n\nNSO will not confirm whether the Indian government is a customer but the presence of\nPegasus infections in the phones of journalists and others in India and the nature of the\ntargets selected for a potential hack suggests that one or more official agencies here are\nactively using the spyware. This inference must be drawn because Pegasus can only be\nused by a client of NSO and NSO has only “vetted governments” as clients.\n\n[Also read: FAQ: On the Pegasus Project’s Digital Forensics](https://thewire.in/tech/faq-pegasus-project-digital-forensics)\n\nWhile the Narendra Modi government has not so far issued a categorical denial that Pegasus\nis officially being used, it has been dismissive of allegations that Pegasus might have been\nused to conduct illegal surveillance of targets in India.\n\nOn Saturday, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology reiterated this stand in a\nresponse to a questionnaire about individual targets sent by Pegasus Project partners.\n\nIndependent forensic analysis conducted by Amnesty International’s Security Lab on a small\nworldwide cross-section of the smartphones of the people on the leaked list threw up traces\nof Pegasus spyware infection in over half the cases. Among the 13 iPhones examined in\nIndia, nine showed evidence of being targeted, of which seven were successfully infected\nwith Pegasus. Among nine Androids tested, one showed evidence of targeting while 8 were\ninconclusive, mainly because Android logs do not provide the kind of detail Amnesty’s team\nneeds to confirm the presence of Pegasus.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpecific digital forensics conducted by AI s Security Lab found traces of Pegasus spyware\non the mobile phones of six Indian journalists who agreed to have their phones examined\nafter discovering their number was in the leaked data.\n\nThe list of journalists to emerge from the Pegasus Project’s reporting cannot be considered\nexhaustive list or even a representative sample of reporters subject to official snooping as it\nis limited to an analysis of one leaked dataset over a narrow time period and covering only\none potential vector of surveillance, i.e. Pegasus.\n\n**Delhi journalists dominate list of persons of interest**\n\nA good chunk of the journalists who appear in the records are based out of the national\ncapital and work with prominent organisations.\n\nFor instance, the leaked data shows that at least four current employees and one former\nemployee of the Hindustan Times group were of potential interest to the Indian Pegasus\nclient – executive editor Shishir Gupta, editorial page editor and former bureau chief\nPrashant Jha, defence correspondent Rahul Singh, a former political reporter who covered\nthe Congress Aurangazeb Naqshbandi, and a reporter in HT’s sister paper, Mint.\n\nOther prominent media houses also had at least one journalist whose phone number\nappears in the leaked records. This includes Ritika Chopra (who covers education and the\nElection Commission) and Muzamil Jaleel (who writes on Kashmir) of the Indian Express,\nSandeep Unnithan (who covers defence and the Indian military) of India Today, Manoj Gupta\n(editor investigations and security affairs) at TV18, and Vijaita Singh, who covers the home\nministry for The Hindu and whose phone contained traces of an attempted Pegasus\ninfection.\n\nThe Pegasus Project is withholding the names of some of those targeted because they have\neither moved on to other jobs or have other other reasons not to be identified.\n\nAt The Wire, those targeted were founder-editors Siddharth Varadarajan and M.K. Venu, for\nwhom specific forensic analysis showed evidence of their phones being infected by Pegasus.\nThe number of Devirupa Mitra, The Wire’s diplomatic editor, also appears in the records.\n\nApart from Rohini Singh, the phone number of another regular contributor to The Wire –\nsenior columnist Prem Shankar Jha, who writes mainly on political and security matters –\nalso appears in the records, as does freelance journalist Swati Chaturvedi, who was also\nwriting for The Wire at the time she was selected.\n\n“Given the abandon with which this government is abusing the Indian constitution to\nincarcerate its staunchest defenders, I am torn between considering this a threat and a\ncompliment,” Jha said, when informed about his selection as a target for surveillance.\n\n\n-----\n\nMy job is to continue [doing] stories… News doesn t stop, stories should be told as they are,\nwithout suppressing the facts or with any embellishment,” The Hindu’s Vijaita Singh told The\n_Wire, adding that it would not be “appropriate to hazard a guess” on why anyone would view_\nher as a potential target for surveillance.\n\n“Whatever information we gather is in the newspaper the following day.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Rohini Singh, “surveillance is seen as something that a powerful\ngovernment would do… It’s not even criticised as much by many journalists in mainstream\nmedia and I think that’s the unfortunate part.”\n\n“My investigative book on the BJP’s secret digital army exposed the Modi government\nattacking citizens in a democracy… I take Modi’s illegal surveillance as a compliment to the\ninvestigative journalism I do,” said Chaturvedi.\n\n“I did not know about this,” Jaleel told The Wire. “But if you have it from reliable sources, it is\na matter of serious concern.”\n\nAnother journalist that finds mention on the list is J. Gopikrishnan, an investigative reporter\nwith The Pioneer, credited with having broken the 2G telecom scam. “Being a journalist, I\ncontact many people and [there are] many [who] want to know who all I contact,” he told The\n_Wire._\n\nAlso Read: Pegasus Project: How Phones of Journalists, Ministers, Activists May Have Been\nUsed to Spy On Them\n\nSeveral senior journalists who have left mainstream organisations also appear in the leaked\ndata as individuals who were selected.\n\nThis includes: national security reporter Saikat Datta, who was South Asia editor of Asia\n_Times Online when his number was listed, former Economics and Political Weekly editor_\nParanjoy Guha Thakurta, who now writes regularly for Newsclick.in, former TV18 anchor and\ndiplomatic reporter at The Tribune Smita Sharma, former Outlook journalist S.N.M. Abdi and\nformer DNA reporter Iftikhar Gilani.\n\n_The Wire’s analysis of the data shows that most of the above mentioned names were_\ntargeted between 2018 and 2019 – in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha general elections.\n\nWhile some journalists appear to have been added to the list at more or less the same time,\nsuggesting official interest in the group, others figure as standalone entries, perhaps for the\nstories they were working on at the time. And these stories are not always the obvious ones.\n\nOne young television reporter, who requested that her name be withheld as she has left the\nprofession to pursue a career in another field, told The Wire that the only story she can\nremember doing during the period the data suggests she might have been targeted for\n\n\n-----\n\nsurveillance was on the CBSE paper leak.\n\nAn Appeal: [Support Investigative Journalism That Brings You The Truth. Support The Wire.](https://support.thewire.in/)\n\n**Prior Pegasus targets?**\n\nIn 2019, WhatsApp, along with Canada-based Citizen Lab, alerted dozens of Indians who\nhad been affected by a Pegasus attack that exploited a hole in the messaging app firm’s\nsecurity.\n\nTwo journalists whose phone numbers appear in the leaked records obtained by the\nPegasus Project, are among those who received messages from WhatsApp in 2019 that\ntheir phones were compromised.\n\nOf that group, records show that former Lok Sabha MP and veteran journalist Santosh\nBharatiya was also marked on the list in early 2019. The former parliamentarian, who early in\nhis career worked as a journalist, publicly stated that he too had received a message from\nWhatsApp.\n\n**Far away from Delhi**\n\nThe leaked data also throws up the numbers of journalists who work far away from Lutyens’\nDelhi and the national glare. This includes north-east-based editor in chief of Frontier TV\nManoranjana Gupta, Bihar-based Sanjay Shyam and Jaspal Singh Heran.\n\nHeran is editor-in-chief of the Ludhiana-based Punjabi daily Rozana Pehredar. The\nnewspaper has reporters in every district of Punjab, is read widely and has a sizeable impact\non the narrative in the state. The octogenarian told the Pegasus Project that due to his\nnewspapers’ critical reportage, he has had run-ins with all governments over the years and\nhas been at the receiving end of several legal notices.\n\nHe believes that any and all surveillance of journalists is “shameful”. “They don’t like it if we\nare critical of the direction in which this country is heading under their leadership. They try to\nsilence us,” Heran said.\n\n1,500 kilometres south east of Ludhiana we find another journalist not immediately prominent\nbut of immense interest to the Indian client of NSO group. Roopesh Kumar Singh is an\nindependent journalist based in Jharkhand’s Ramgarh and three phone numbers belonging\nto him are part of the leaked data.\n\nSingh was not surprised to learn that he was marked as a potential snooping target. “I have\nalways known that I am being watched, especially after a 2017 story about the killing of an\ninnocent Adivasi by the Jharkhand police,” Singh told us. The story Singh mentioned was\n[published by The Wire Hindi on June 15, 2017 and raised questions about the killing of an](http://thewirehindi.com/11235/alleged-fake-encounter-of-motilal-baske-by-jharkhand-police-in-giridih-district/)\nindividual whom the police claimed was associated with a banned Maoist group.\n\n\n-----\n\nSingh s phone appears in the leaked records just a few months after the story, according to\nPegasus Project data.\n\nIn June 2019, Singh was arrested by the Bihar police and booked for possession of\nexplosives under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). He was released\nsix months later on bail as the police failed to file a charge sheet within the stipulated time.\n“The police planted the explosives. It was an attempt to intimidate me because of my\nreporting,” Singh said.\n\nDeepak Gidwani, another name on the list, was principal correspondent with DNA based in\nLucknow between 2006 and 2016. Since then he has stepped away from journalism to\npursue spiritual interests. Two numbers used by him were selected in 2019.\n\n“I have no idea why I may have been under surveillance. Apart from posting occasionally on\nFacebook and WhatsApp I don’t write anything now. I prefer to follow the path of spirituality.”\n\n**What do forensic analyses show?**\n\nAmnesty International’s Security Lab was able to conduct digital forensics on the phones of\nseven journalists. The organisation’s results were tested for robustness through a blind test\ncarried out by experts at Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto-based institute whose research\npartially laid the groundwork for WhatsApp’s landmark lawsuit against the NSO Group in\n2019.\n\nThe security lab’s overarching methodology was peer-reviewed and endorsed by Citizen\nLab.\n\nThe phones of former Indian Express journalist Sushant Singh, India Ahead News\ncontributing editor Smita Sharma, former EPW editor Paranjoy Guha Thakurta,\nformer Outlook journalist S.N.M. Abdi, The Hindu’s Vijaita Singh and The Wire’s two founding\neditors Siddharth Varadarajan and M.K. Venu were analysed.\n\nOut of these, Amnesty found evidence that the phones of Sushant Singh, Thakurta, Abdi,\nVaradarajan and Venu were compromised with Pegasus spyware.\n\nFor Smita Sharma, the analysis found evidence of a hacking attempt through a vulnerability\nin Apple’s iMessage system, but nothing to indicate that her phone was successfully\ninfected. She reports on foreign policy issues and was deputy editor with The Tribune when\nthe hacking attempts allegedly took place.\n\nAlso read: Old RTI Response Enough To Deny Govt-Pegasus Link, Media Didn’t Do Due\nDiligence: MeitY\n\nVijaita Singh’s Android phone also showed evidence of an attempted hack, but no evidence\nof a successful compromise was detected.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the results do not indicate what the attacker did using Pegasus, it comes to a few key\nconclusions for the following people:\n\n1) S.N.M. Abdi: Phone compromised by Pegasus during the months of April 2019, May\n2019, July 2019, October 2019 and December 2019. Amnesty was not able to verify the\nattack vector (I.e., the method through which the spyware used to infect the phone).\n\n2) Sushant Singh: Phone compromised by Pegasus from March 2021 to July 2021, through\nwhat Amnesty International calls a zero-click exploit in the iMessage service. The attack is\nreferred to as ‘zero-click’, because it does not require the victims to take any action (such as\nclicking on a malicious link in a SMS or e-mail) for the infection to occur.\n\n3) Paranjoy Guha Thakurta: Phone compromised by Pegasus during parts of April 2018,\nMay 2018, June 2018 and July 2018. Amnesty was not able to identify the attack vector that\nthe spyware used to infiltrate the phone.\n\n4) M.K. Venu: Analysts at Amnesty found that the phone was infected with Pegasus as\nrecently as June 2021, through what they called a zero-click iMessage exploit.\n\n5) Siddharth Varadarajan: Phone compromised by Pegasus during parts of April 2018.\nDigital forensics could not determine the manner in which the spyware infected the phone\n(I.e., the attack vector).\n\nDigital forensic analysis was also conducted for the iPhone of a senior editor at a\nmainstream Indian newspaper, but no traces of Pegasus were found — primarily because it\nwas not the same device being used by the journalist when her number showed up on the\nlist.\n\nForbidden Stories and The Wire also reached out to a number of other journalists, both at\nmainstream publications and otherwise, to ask whether they would be open to participating in\na forensic analysis. They refused, citing a number of reasons including a lack of support from\ntheir management or their inability to trust the underlying process.\n\n_(Additional reporting by Pawanjot Kaur, Ajoy Ashirwad Mahaprashasta and Devirupa Mitra)_\n\n_The Pegasus Project is a collaborative investigation that involves more than 80 journalists_\n_from 17 news organisations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories with the_\n_[technical support of Amnesty International’s Security Lab.
