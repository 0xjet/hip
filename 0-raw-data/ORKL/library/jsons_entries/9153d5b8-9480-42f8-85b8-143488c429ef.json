At [CyberWarCon 2021, MSTIC analysts presented their analysis of these](https://www.cyberwarcon.com/)\ntrends in Iranian nation state actor activity during a session titled “The Iranian evolution:\n_Observed changes in Iranian malicious network operations”. This blog is intended to_\nsummarize the content of that research and the topics covered in their presentation and\ndemonstrate MSTIC’s ongoing efforts to track these actors and protect customers from the\nrelated threats.\n\nMSTIC consistently tracks threat actor activity, including the groups discussed in this blog,\nand works across Microsoft Security products and services to build detections into our\nproducts that improve customer protections. We are sharing this blog today so that others in\nthe community can also be aware of the latest techniques we have observed being used by\nIranian actors.\n\nAs with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified customers that\nhave been targeted or compromised, providing them with the information they need to help\nsecure their accounts. Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to\n\n\n-----\n\nan unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as\na unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the\nactor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, a DEV is converted to a named actor.\n\nThree notable trends in Iranian nation-state operators have emerged:\n\nThey are increasingly utilizing ransomware to either collect funds or disrupt their\ntargets.\nThey are more patient and persistent while engaging with their targets.\nWhile Iranian operators are more patient and persistent with their social engineering\ncampaigns, they continue to employ aggressive brute force attacks on their targets.\n\n## Ransomware\n\nSince September 2020, MSTIC has observed six Iranian threat groups deploying\nransomware to achieve their strategic objectives. These ransomware deployments were\nlaunched in waves every six to eight weeks on average.\n\n_Figure 1: Timeline of ransomware attacks by Iranian threat actors_\n\nIn one observed campaign, PHOSPHORUS targeted the Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN and\nunpatched on-premises Exchange Servers globally with the intent of deploying ransomware\n[on vulnerable networks. A recent blog post by the DFIR Report describes a similar intrusion](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/)\nin which actors leveraged vulnerabilities in on-premise Exchange Servers to compromise a\nvictim environment and encrypt systems via BitLocker. MSTIC also attributes this activity to\nPHOSPHORUS. PHOSPHORUS operators conducted widespread scanning and ransomed\ntargeted systems through a five-step process: Scan Exploit Review Stage Ransom\n\n\n-----\n\n### Scan\n\nIn the early part of 2021, PHOSPHORUS actors scanned millions of IPs on the internet for\n[Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN that were vulnerable to CVE-2018-13379. This vulnerability](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384)\nallowed the attackers to collect clear-text credentials from the sessions file on vulnerable\nFortinet VPN appliances. The actors collected credentials from over 900 Fortinet VPN\nservers in the United States, Europe, and Israel so far this year. In the last half of 2021,\nPHOSPHORUS shifted to scanning for unpatched on-premises Exchange Servers\nvulnerable to ProxyShell (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE2021-27065).\n\n### Exploit\n\nWhen they identified vulnerable servers, PHOSPHORUS sought to gain persistence on the\ntarget systems. In some instances, the actors downloaded a Plink runner named\n_MicrosoftOutLookUpdater.exe. This file would beacon periodically to their C2 servers via_\nSSH, allowing the actors to issue further commands. Later, the actors would download a\ncustom implant via a Base64-encoded PowerShell command. This implant established\npersistence on the victim system by modifying startup registry keys and ultimately functioned\nas a loader to download additional tools.\n\n### Review\n\nAfter gaining persistence, PHOSPHORUS actors triaged hundreds of victims to determine\nwhich of them were fitting for actions on objectives. On select victims, operators created local\nadministrator accounts with a with a username of “help” and password of “_AS_@1394” via\nthe commands below. On occasion, actors dumped LSASS to acquire credentials to be used\nlater for lateral movement.\n\n### Stage and Ransom\n\nFinally, MSTIC observed PHOSPHORUS employing BitLocker to encrypt data and ransom\nvictims at several targeted organizations. BitLocker is a full volume encryption feature meant\nto be used for legitimate purposes. After compromising the initial server (through vulnerable\nVPN or Exchange Server), the actors moved laterally to a different system on the victim\nnetwork to gain access to higher value resources. From there, they deployed a script to\nencrypt the drives on multiple systems. Victims were instructed to reach out to a specific\nTelegram page to pay for the decryption key.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Patience and persistence\n\nMSTIC has observed PHOSPHORUS threat actors employing social engineering to build\nrapport with their victims before targeting them. These operations likely required significant\ninvestment in the operator’s time and resources to refine and execute. This trend indicates\nPHOSPHORUS is either moving away from or expanding on their past tactics of sending\nunsolicited links and attachments in spear-phishing email campaigns to attempt credential\ntheft.\n\n### PHOSHORUS – Patient and persistent\n\nPHOSPHORUS sends “interview requests” to target individuals through emails that contain\ntracking links to confirm whether the user has opened the file. Once a response is received\nfrom the target user, PHOSPHORUS attackers send a link to a benign list of interview\nquestions hosted on a cloud service provider. The attackers continue with several back-andforth conversations discussing the questions with the target user before finally sending a\nmeeting invite with a link masquerading as a Google Meeting.\n\nOnce the meeting invite is sent, the attackers continuously reach out to the target user,\nasking them to test the Google Meeting link. The attackers contact the targeted user multiple\ntimes per day, continuously pestering them to click the link. The attackers even go so far as\nto offer to call the target user to walk them through clicking the link. The attackers are more\nthan willing to troubleshoot any issues the user has signing into the fake Google Meeting\nlink, which leads to a credential harvesting page.\n\nMSTIC has observed PHOSPHORUS operators become very aggressive in their emails after\nthe initial lure is sent, to the point where they are almost demanding a response from the\ntargeted user.\n\n### CURIUM – In it for the long run\n\nCURIUM is another Iranian threat actor group that has shown a great deal of patience when\ntargeting users. Instead of phishing emails, CURIUM actors leverage a network of fictitious\nsocial media accounts to build trust with targets and deliver malware.\n\nThese attackers have followed the following playbook:\n\nMasquerade as an attractive woman on social media\nChat with the target daily\nSend benign videos of the woman to the target to prime them to lower their guard\nSend malicious files to the target similar the benign files previously sent\n\n\n-----\n\nRequest that the target user open the malicious document\nExfiltrate data from the victim machine\n\nThe process above can take multiple months from the initial connection to the delivery of the\nmalicious document. The attackers build a relationship with target users over time by having\nconstant and continuous communications which allows them to build trust and confidence\nwith the target. In many of the cases we have observed, the targets genuinely believed that\nthey were making a human connection and not interacting with a threat actor operating from\nIran.\n\nBy exercising patience, building relationships, and pestering targets continuously once a\nrelationship has been formed, Iranian threat actors have had more success in compromising\ntheir targets.\n\n## Brute force\n\nIn 2021, MSTIC observed DEV-0343 aggressively targeting Office 365 tenants via an\nongoing campaign of password spray attacks. DEV-0343 is a threat actor MSTIC assesses\nto be likely operating in support of Iranian interests. MSTIC has blogged about DEV-0343\nactivity previously.\n\n[Analysis of Office 365 logs suggests that DEV-0343 is using a red team tool like o365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray)\nto conduct these attacks.\n\nTargeting in this DEV-0343 activity has been observed across defense companies that\nsupport United States, European Union, and Israeli government partners producing militarygrade radars, drone technology, satellite systems, and emergency response communication\nsystems. Further activity has targeted customers in geographic information systems (GIS),\nspatial analytics, regional ports of entry in the Persian Gulf, and several maritime and cargo\ntransportation companies with a business focus in the Middle East.\n\nAs we discussed in our previous blog, DEV-0343 operators’ ‘pattern of life’ is consistent with\nthe working schedule of actors based in Iran. DEV-0343 operator activity peaked Sunday\nthrough Thursday between 04:00:00 and 16:00:00 UTC.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: DEV-0343 observed operating hours in UTC_\n\n_Figure 3: DEV-0343 observed actor requests per day_\n\nKnown DEV-0343 operators have also been observed targeting the same account on the\nsame tenant being targeted by other known Iranian operators. For example, EUROPIUM\noperators attempted to access a specific account on June 12, 2021 and ultimately gained\naccess to this account on June 13, 2021. DEV-0343 was then observed targeting this same\naccount within minutes of EUROPIUM operators gaining access to it the same day. MSTIC\nassesses that these observed overlapping activities suggest a coordination between different\nIranian actors pursuing common objectives.\n\n## Closing thoughts: Increasingly capable threat actors\n\nAs Iranian operators have adapted both their strategic goals and tradecraft, over time they\nhave evolved into more competent threat actors capable of conducting a full spectrum of\noperations including:\n\nInformation operations\nDisruption and destruction\nSupport to physical operations\n\nSpecifically, Iranian operators have proven themselves to be both willing and able to:\n\nDeploy ransomware\nDeploy disk wipers\nDeploy mobile malware\nConduct phishing attacks\nConduct password spray attacks\nConduct mass exploitation attacks\nConduct supply chain attacks\nCloak C2 communications behind legitimate cloud services\n\n\n-----\n\nMSTIC thanks CyberWarCon 2021 for the opportunity to present this research to the broader\nsecurity community. Microsoft will continue to monitor all this activity by Iranian actors and\nimplement protections for our customers.\n\n\n-----",
