See the_ _ATT&CK for_\n_[Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques and the D3FEND framework for referenced](https://d3fend.mitre.org/)_\n_defensive tactics and techniques._\n\nThe National Security Agency, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI) assess that People’s Republic of China state-sponsored malicious cyber activity is a\nmajor threat to U.S. and Allied cyberspace assets. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors aggressively target\nU.S. and allied political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and\norganizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging key technologies, intellectual property, and\npersonally identifiable information (PII). Some target sectors include managed service providers,\nsemiconductor companies, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), universities, and medical institutions. These\ncyber operations support China’s long-term economic and military development objectives.\n\nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nused by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. This advisory builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting\nto inform federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government, CI, DIB, and private industry\norganizations about notable trends and persistent TTPs through collaborative, proactive, and retrospective\nanalysis.\n\nTo increase the defensive posture of their critical networks and reduce the risk of Chinese malicious cyber\nactivity, NSA, CISA, and FBI urge government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations to apply the\nrecommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory and in Appendix A: Chinese Statesponsored Cyber Actors' Observed Procedures. Note: NSA, CISA, and FBI encourage organization leaders to\nreview [CISA Joint Insights: Chinese Malicious Cyber Activity: Threat Overview for Leaders for information on](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/chinese-cyber-threat-overview-and-actions-leaders)\nthis threat to their organization.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/19/2002805003/-1/-1/1/CSA_CHINESE_STATE-SPONSORED_CYBER_TTPS.PDF)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Trends in Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Operations**\n\nNSA, CISA, and FBI have observed increasingly sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored cyber activity\ntargeting U.S. political, economic, military, educational, and CI personnel and organizations. NSA, CISA, and\nFBI have identified the following trends in Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber operations through\nproactive and retrospective analysis:\n\n**Acquisition of Infrastructure and Capabilities. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors remain agile**\nand cognizant of the information security community’s practices. These actors take effort to mask their\nactivities by using a revolving series of virtual private servers (VPSs) and common open-source or\ncommercial penetration tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exploitation of Public Vulnerabilities. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors consistently scan target**\nnetworks for critical and high vulnerabilities within days of the vulnerability’s public disclosure. In many\ncases, these cyber actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities in major applications, such as Pulse Secure,\nApache, F5 Big-IP, and Microsoft products. For information on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n(CVE) known to be exploited by malicious Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, see:\n\nCISA-FBI Joint CSA AA20-133A: [Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-133a)\n\nCISA Activity Alert: AA20-275A: Potential for China Cyber Response to Heightened U.S.-China\nTensions, and\n\nNSA CSA U/OO/179811-20: Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known\nVulnerabilities.\n\n**Encrypted Multi-Hop Proxies. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors have been routinely observed**\nusing a VPS as an encrypted proxy. The cyber actors use the VPS as well as small office and home\noffice (SOHO) devices as operational nodes to evade detection.\n\n**Observed Tactics and Techniques**\n\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors use a full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks\nof interest worldwide and to acquire sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information.\nAppendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Framework lists the tactics and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored\n[cyber actors. A downloadable JSON file is also available on the NSA Cybersecurity GitHub page.](https://github.com/nsacyber/chinese-state-sponsored-cyber-operations-observed-ttps)\n\nRefer to Appendix A: Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Actors’ Observed Procedures for information on\nprocedures affiliated with these tactics and techniques as well as applicable mitigations.\n\n_Figure 1: Example of tactics and techniques used in various cyber operations._\n\n## Mitigations\n\n\n-----\n\nNSA, CISA, and FBI urge federal and SLTT government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations to apply\nthe following recommendations as well as the detection and mitigation recommendations in Appendix A, which\nare tailored to observed tactics and techniques:\n\n**Patch systems and equipment promptly and diligently. Focus on patching critical and high**\nvulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on externally facing equipment\nand CVEs known to be exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. Consider implementing a\npatch management program that enables a timely and thorough patching cycle.\n**Note: for more information on CVEs routinely exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors refer to**\nthe resources listed in the Trends in Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Operations section.\n\n**Enhance monitoring of network traffic, email, and endpoint systems. Review network signatures**\nand indicators for focused activities, monitor for new phishing themes, and adjust email rules accordingly.\nFollow the best practices of restricting attachments via email and blocking URLs and domains based\nupon reputation. Ensure that log information is aggregated and correlated to enable maximum detection\ncapabilities, with a focus on monitoring for account misuse. Monitor common ports and protocols for\ncommand and control (C2) activity. SSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted\nsessions to look for network-based indicators of malware communication protocols. Implement and\nenhance network and endpoint event analysis and detection capabilities to identify initial infections,\ncompromised credentials, and the manipulation of endpoint processes and files.\n**Use protection capabilities to stop malicious activity. Implement anti-virus software and other**\nendpoint protection capabilities to automatically detect and prevent malicious files from executing. Use a\nnetwork intrusion detection and prevention system to identify and prevent commonly employed\nadversarial malware and limit nefarious data transfers. Use a domain reputation service to detect\nsuspicious or malicious domains. Use strong credentials for service accounts and multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA) for remote access to mitigate an adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials,\nbut be aware of MFA interception techniques for some MFA implementations.▪\n\n## Resources\n\nRefer to [us-cert.cisa.gov/china,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/china) [https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts, and](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts) https://www.nsa.gov/What-WeDo/Cybersecurity/Advisories-Technical-Guidance/ for previous reporting on Chinese state-sponsored malicious\ncyber activity.\n\n## Disclaimer of Endorsement\n\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or\nguarantees.
