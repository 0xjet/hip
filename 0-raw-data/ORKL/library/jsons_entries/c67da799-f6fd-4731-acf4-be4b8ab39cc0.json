But one of Android’s greatest\nstrengths, the ability to sideload apps from non-official sources, is also a weakness.\n\nUsing a combination of tricks to persuade users to install apps outside of the official store,\ncriminals spread most of their malware through sideloading. If mobile devices have no\nsecurity solution installed, malicious apps roam free.\n\nThe TeaBot and Flubot are the newest banker trojan families, as multiple security\n[researchers identified them in the early months of 2021. Bitdefender researchers have](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1348936359436804096)\ndiscovered a batch of new malicious Android applications that impersonate real ones from\npopular brands but with a malware twist.\n\n### TeaBot Strikes Again\n\n\n-----\n\nTeaBot (also known as ‘Anatsa’) and its working mechanisms are known. According to an\n[early analysis report, the malware can carry out overlay attacks via Android Accessibility](https://www.cleafy.com/documents/teabot)\nServices, intercept messages, perform various keylogging activities, steal Google\nAuthentication codes, and even take full remote control of Android devices.\n\nCriminals welcome the opportunity to spread malware directly from app stores, but that isn’t\neasy. Instead, they go for the next available method – imitating top-rated apps in the hopes\nof tricking at least some users into downloading and installing their malicious versions.\n\nBitdefender researchers have identified five new malicious Android applications that pack\nthe Teabot banking trojan and impersonate real ones. Two of the apps are mentioned as\n[banking malware on Twitter, and we made the connection to the Anatsa malware.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1353816938892423169)\n\nThe fake apps housing the Teabot payload are based on popular apps residing on Google\nPlay, some with as many as 50M+ downloads. It’s no surprise that criminals try to take\nadvantage and weaponize their popularity. The developers of the official apps have no fault\nin this matter.\n\nThe start of this fake malicious Android apps campaign dates to the beginning of December\n[2020, earlier than previously identified. This was also indicated in a tweet when the original](https://www.cleafy.com/documents/teabot)\narticle was published.\n\n\n**App label - infected**\n**version**\n\nUplift: Health and\nWellness App\n\n\n**App label – clean version** **Clean app**\n**icon**\n\nUplift: Health and Wellness App\n\n\n**Infected app**\n**icon**\n\n\nBookReader Bookmate: Read Books & Listen\nto Audiobooks\n\nPlutoTV Pluto TV - It's Free TV\n\n\nГосуслуги: Возврат\nНДС\n\n\nГосуслуги\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky: Free\nAntivirus\n\n\nKaspersky Antivirus: Security,\nVirus Cleaner\n\n\nVLC MediaPlayer VLC for Android\n\nThe campaign to distribute these apps in the wild remains active. Bitdefender has identified\na strange distribution method with attackers using a fake Ad Blocker app that acts as a\ndropper for the malware. It’s just one new distribution method. We suspect others are used,\nbut they remain unknown for the time being.\n\nWe put together a list of all banks targeted by the Teabot, but there’s a caveat: Its operators\ncan adapt it any given time, add more banks or remove support for some. The list is valid\nright now, but it’s likely to change in the future.\n\n**App name** **App package name**\n\nBankia Wallet com.bankia.wallet\n\nBankinterMóvil com.bankinter.launcher\n\nBBVA Spain | Online banking com.bbva.bbvacontigo\n\nBBVA Net Cash | ES & PT com.bbva.netcash\n\nKutxabank com.kutxabank.android\n\nSantander es.bancosantander.apps\n\nBankia es.cm.android\n\nCaixaBankNow es.lacaixa.mobile.android.newwapicon\n\nBanca Digital Liberbank es.liberbank.cajasturapp\n\nOpenbank – bancamóvil es.openbank.mobile\n\nUnicajaMovil es.univia.unicajamovil\n\nBBVA México (BancomerMóvil) com.bancomer.mbanking\n\n\nBanco Sabadell App. Your mobile\nbank\n\n\nnet.inverline.bancosabadell.officelocator.android\n\n\n-----\n\nCommerzbank Banking – The app at\nyour side\n\n\nde.commerzbanking.mobil\n\n\ncomdirect mobile App de.comdirect.android\n\nSparkasseIhre mobile Filiale com.starfinanz.smob.android.sfinanzstatus\n\nDeutsche Bank Mobile com.db.pwcc.dbmobile\n\n\nBanco Sabadell App. Your mobile\nbank\n\n\nnet.inverline.bancosabadell.officelocator.android\n\n\nVR Banking Classic de.fiducia.smartphone.android.banking.vr\n\nCajasur com.cajasur.android\n\nGrupoCajamar com.grupocajamar.wefferent\n\n\nBW-Mobilbankingmit Smartphone und\nTablet\n\n\ncom.starfinanz.smob.android.bwmobilbanking\n\n\nIbercaja es.ibercaja.ibercajaapp\n\nING España. Banca Móvil www.ingdirect.nativeframe\n\nFrom Bitdefender’s telemetry, we were able to identify two new infection vectors, namely\nthe applications with package names’ com.intensive.sound’ and ‘com.anaconda.brave’,\nwhich downloads Teabot. These are malware dropper applications known for imitating\nlegitimate applications (such as Ad Blocker in our case).\n\nThe fake Ad Blocker apps don’t have any of the functionality of the original version. They\nask permission to display over other applications, show notifications, and install applications\noutside of Google Play, after which they hide the icon.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom time to time, the fake apps will show out-of-context ads and will eventually download\nand attempt to install Teabot, as instructed by the CnC.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is not a surprise; offering malware download as a service is a fairly common practice in\nthe underground malware industry.\n\n/Android/data/com.intensive.sound/files/Download/MediaPlayer.apk\n\n/Android/data/com.anaconda.brave/files/Download/MediaPlayer.apk\n\nWe detect these dropper applications with Bitdefender Mobile Security as\nAndroid.Trojan.HiddenApp.AID.\n\nThis is the current distribution, with an app simply named MediaPlayer ruling the landscape.\nBut it’s not the only one. As it turns out, the MediaPlayer.apk actually tries to impersonate\none of the most famous multimedia players in the Google Play Store, named VLC. Security\nresearchers from Cleafy were the first to identify the malware impersonating the VLC app.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe country distribution of Teabot is already known and rather interesting, with countries\nsuch as Spain, Italy and Netherland highly targeted.\n\n**TeaBot heatmap distribution:**\n\n\n-----\n\n### FluBot is not far behind\n\n[Flubot (also known as Cabassous) is another banker family quickly gaining popularity. The](https://twitter.com/PRODAFT/status/1367764339420241920)\nheatmap shows that this family of banking trojans has been more successful in spreading\ninternationally, predominantly in Germany, Spain, Italy and the UK.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike Teabot, which is sometimes dropped by an app posing as an ad blocker, Flubot\noperators have a much more direct campaign, using spam SMS as a means of delivery.\n\nWhile its malicious functionality is not as complex as Teabot’s (which through accessibility\nlogging enables threat actors to monitor the device in real-time), FluBot is still a banker\ntrojan. It steals banking, contact, SMS and other types of private data from infected devices,\nand has an arsenal of other commands available, including the ability to send an SMS with\ncontent [provided by the CnC.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/master/FluBot/FluBot.pdf)\n\nFlubot uses that command to spread, through its SMS spamming and worm-like behavior.\nIn our analysis, we have observed over 100 different domains used in the campaign to host\nthe fake APK files. These domains belong to hacked/hijacked sites, where the threat actors\ninjected their malware to spread further. In many cases, these are legitimate websites and\ndomains that criminals have successfully attacked through existing vulnerabilities, allowing\nthem to inject download links for malware.\n\nSome examples of sent SMS:\n\n\nTarget\nvictims\n\nSpanish\nspeaking\n\nSpanish\nspeaking\n\nSpanish\nspeaking\n\nPolish\nspeaking\n\n\nSamples of SMS sent to victims\n\nHola,\nTiene (1) Paquete de Media Markt!\nRef: UPS-20147\nUltima oportunidad para recogerlo>> http://wxz14[.]com/p/?o5l08o8nmt\n\nNo hemospodidoentregarsupaquete.

The malware steals real contact names and phone\nnumbers from the victim’s phone and sends them to servers hosted by the threat actors.\nThe server composes the SMS message, using that real information and sends it back to\nthe malware on infected phones. Flubot then sends SMS messages directly from the\nvictim’s device.\n\nAn observed example of such a template:\n\nHola<CONTACT_NAME>, confirmesuscredenciales para la entrega de hoy, de lo\ncontrario, supaquete sera devuelto al remitente: <MALWARE DOWNLOAD LINK>\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of Flubot SMS messages:\n\nHolaRuben, confirmesuscredenciales para la entrega de hoy, de lo contrario, supaquete\nsera devuelto al remitente: https://defencelover[.]in/out/?iaw1g6md2w\n\nHolaMarci, confirmesuscredenciales para la entrega de hoy, de lo contrario, supaquete\nsera devuelto al remitente: http://www.zyzlk[.]com/pack/?qq3s32hc4q\n\nHolaRamiro, confirmesuscredenciales para la entrega de hoy, de lo contrario, supaquete\nsera devuelto al remitente: http://patchbuy[.]com/url/?rfzw0d1p8o\n\nLike in the case of Teabot, the FluBot operators go after banks and their apps, but the list of\ntargeted apps can change at any time, as commanded by the attackers.\n\nFluBot imitates the following apps, among others:\n\n**App label** **App icon** **Google Play Installs**\n\nDHL Express Mobile 1,000,000+\n\nFedEx Mobile 5,000,000+\n\nCorreos 500,000+\n\nThis is a top 10 list of the countries where Bitdefender’s telemetry identified the largest\nnumber of samples, but FluBot’s reach extends to many others including Hungary, Japan,\nIreland, Greece, Argentine, Austria, France and others.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Flubot heatmap**\n\nThe file name distribution of Flubot is seen in this chart.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators of compromise**\n\n**MD5** **Package name**\n\n4642c7a56039a82d8268282802c2fee9 trust.royal.vibrant\n\n30ce352e03a873122ec9f701145893a7 double.slide.clip\n\na5ec451a40194e55765c77457b6060b1 where.reunion.subway\n\n3cdc0c143454a50b8603a1b6c6d6d3e9 convince.achieve.syrup\n\n730f22b9031a7987b4bed8e3a7487b6d stereo.march.wire\n\n43f8bd0078741b4fdc894b27ecd60a88 rebel.tragic.hazard\n\nc20c6cd13bd8b5ccaca9e212635f7057 question.cancel.cradle\n\n**CnCDomain – already mentioned**\n\nPokymase[.]xyz\n\n185[.]215[.]113[.]31\n\n**CnCDomains – new**\n\nJamelal[.]xyz\n\n\n-----\n\nForeannul[.]top\n\nForunkulosko2122[.]top\n\nPeskoleonido9201[.]top\n\n185[.]215[.]113[.]39\n\nBiomakein202best[.]top\n\nLosh190sup29asp[.]top\n\n**Applications impersonated by Anatsa/TeaBot**\n\n**App package name** **App name** **Google Play**\n**installs**\n\norg.videolan.vlc VLC for Android 100,000,000+\n\ntv.pluto.android Pluto TV – It’s Free TV 50,000,000+\n\n\ncom.kms.free Kaspersky Antivirus: Security, Virus\nCleaner\n\n\n50,000,000+\n\n\nru.rostel Госуслуги 10,000,000+\n\n\ncom.bookmate Bookmate: Read Books & Listen to\nAudiobooks\n\n\n1,000,000+\n\n\ncom.upliftwork.android Uplift: Health and Wellness App 1,000+\n\n**FluBot/Cabassous**\n\nThe research on FluBot is extensive and approximately 1600 MD5 hashes have been\nidentified by various teams. Here are three for some of the more widely circulated app\ntainted with the FluBot malware. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of compromised\nwebsites and domains, many of which are legitimate. Some of them are now offline, some\nhave fixed the intrusions and deleted the malware, so listing them separately is not a viable\nsolution.\n\n**MD5** **Packge name**\n\nfdcaa6e277c5ea7627b8fcfcc523f25b com.taobao.taobao\n\nff1575ee37bba19d2f0a8a0e6b2f6267 com.tencent.mm\n\nfa40188a4db5620fc8fa72f83ffdc320 com.tencent.mm\n\n**FluBotDroppers**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Package name**\n\ncom.intensive.sound\n\ncom.anaconda.brave\n\nThe best way to avoid infection with either of these two threats is never to install apps\noutside the official store. Also, never tap on links in messages and always be mindful of\nyour Android apps’ permissions. Finally, having a security solution such as Bitdefender\nMobile Security installed on Android devices is recommended.\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Silviu STAHIE\n\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades,\ncovering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/sstahie/)\n\n## Oana ASOLTANEI\n\nOana Asoltanei is a Security Researcher at Bitdefender.
