    "plain_text": "# Turkey targeted by Cerberus and Anubis Android banking Trojan campaigns\n\n**[bushidotoken.blogspot.com/2020/05/turkey-targeted-by-cerberus-and-anubis.html](https://bushidotoken.blogspot.com/2020/05/turkey-targeted-by-cerberus-and-anubis.html)**\n\nBushidoToken\n\nI recently set out to become more acquainted with Maltego, a useful program for open-source\nintelligence (OSINT) and forensics, developed by Paterva. I also noticed there is an ongoing\ncampaign against Turkey using Android banking Trojans such as Anubis and Cerberus. Both\nare Malware-as-a-Service offerings that supply a builder and mobile remote access Trojan\n(MRAT) to steal credentials from Android users.\n\nSecurity researchers such as @MalwareHunterTeam, @ReBensk, @pr3wtd, and\n@mertcangokgoz, and others have all recently shared new samples of Cerberus and Anubis\ntargeting users in Turkey with mobile data “gifts” that are offered from their mobile carriers\ndue to COVID-19. Various websites are registered hosting links to fake apps, which were\ndownloaded from the threat actor’s GitLab or BitBucket repositories. These apps are Android\npackages (.APK) that can be distributed via SMS, instant messaging app, on Twitter, via\nemail, and other social engineering techniques.\n\nWith the Tweets of these security researchers I compiled the indicators of compromise (IOCs)\nsuch as file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and any other useful artefacts. I then fired up\nMaltego and began compiling the IOCs and trying to figure out how it was all connected.\n\n**Multiple Anubis campaigns:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cerberus GitLab campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cerberus BitBucket campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Phishing lures:**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Number of people targeted in these campaigns:**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional findings:\nFour of the command and control (C&C) servers during the Cerberus BitBucket campaign\nwere registered by the same threat actor. All used the same throwaway Gmail address to\nregister over a dozen malicious domains with the \".top\" gTLD.\n\nAs previously mentioned the attackers are exploiting the lockdown due to the coronavirus with\nthese key phrases in Turkish:\n\n- “Hediye” = Gift\n\n- “Evde internetim var” = Have internet at home\n\n- “Evde kal” = Stay at home\n\n- “Indir 20GB kazan” = Download win 20GB\n\n(Disclaimer - I only used Google translate)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise:**\n\nFilenames:\n\nEvdeHayatVar_build_obf.apk Covid_19.apk EvdeKal_build_obf.apk\n\nevdekal_obf.apk Covid19MobileInstall_obf.apk Vodafone-5G.apk\n\n\n-----\n\nevdekal-20gb.apk Covid-19Mobile.apk GooglePlay.apk\n\n20gb-evdekal.apk 20GBHediye.apk 20gb_hediye_internet.apk\n\n30GbKazan.apk 20gbhediyesi.apk HayatEveSigar.apk\n\nhediye20gb.apk 20gb-evde-kal.apk SenEvdesinDiye_build_obf.apk\n\n20gb_hediye_internet.apk hediye20gb.apk hayatevesigar.apk\n\nevdekaliyorum.apk basvuru_devlet_destegi.apk evde-kal.apk\n\nUsers:\nhttps://bitbucket[.]org/nilsudemir1881\nhttps://bitbucket[.]org/kaankaratas12881\n\nhttps://bitbucket[.]org/emreadamol34\nhttps://gitlab[.]com/akif65336\n\nhttps://gitlab[.]com/ordulkemal2\n\nIOCs such as Hashes, Domains, URLs, and IPv4 addresses can be found on my OTX feed\n[here.](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5eb5dc29f93f6c29a4d710fa)\nSources:\n[https://twitter.com/AdemOzcan68/status/1254507257427001345?s=20](https://twitter.com/AdemOzcan68/status/1254507257427001345?s=20)\n[https://twitter.com/mertcangokgoz/status/1253608999024558081?s=20](https://twitter.com/mertcangokgoz/status/1253608999024558081?s=20%C2%A0)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1253303545681625091](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1253303545681625091)\n[https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1253266830237540352](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1253266830237540352)\n[https://twitter.com/pr3wtd/status/1257022398202810370](https://twitter.com/pr3wtd/status/1257022398202810370)\n[https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1256649187581722635](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1256649187581722635)\n[https://twitter.com/SmashTheKernel/status/1258641094369251328](https://twitter.com/SmashTheKernel/status/1258641094369251328)\n\n[https://koodous.com/apks?search=HayatEveSigar](https://koodous.com/apks?search=HayatEveSigar)\n\n**Continued:**\n\nSecurity researchers that focus on Android threats have shared additional samples this week\nas part of this ongoing campaign. Some samples are directly connected, others are part of a\nnew wave. BitBucket remains to be a preferred choice for hosting the APK files of the Android\nTrojans and many of the malicious domains are hosted with the GoDaddy registrar services.\n\nAnubis campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\nContinued:\n\nPhishing lures used this week:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nMore IOCs such as Hashes, Domains, URLs, and IPv4 addresses can be found on my OTX\nfeed [here.](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5ebeb1b1cc5ab283477bf6c8/)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTurkish users continue to be targeted by the Anubis Android banking Trojan campaign, using\ncoronavirus phishing and free mobile data \"gifts\" due to the lockdown. If the previous\ndownload numbers are to be believed, it is more than likely that around 4,000 people in\nTurkey may have unknowingly downloaded the Trojan onto their devices.\n\nThis is a serious cybercriminal campagin that is exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. What\nmakes these attacks all the more difficult to prevent is that Anubis is a Malware-as-a-Service\nplatform. This means that low-skilled threat actors can purchase access and initiate attacks\nimmediately. The only barrier to entry is usually a Bitcoin wallet to buy with.\n\nThis campaign is likely to continue exploiting the coronavirus for the forseeable future. It is a\ngolden opportunity for threat actors to leverage in their phishing lures due to a heightened\nlevel of paranoia and uncertainty amongst the general population. As people seek for\nanswers and the latest news on the coronavirus they fall into these attacker's traps.\n\n\n-----\n\nAndroid users should exercise caution over such threats and make sure to never download\nan application from a website or third-party appstore. Business devices should stick to vetted\napps from the Google Play Store.\n\nSources:\n[https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1260817120687984640](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1260817120687984640)\n[https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1260606944882110464](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1260606944882110464)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260502947680698368](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260502947680698368)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260791061301137409](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260791061301137409)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260056152965918720](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260056152965918720)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260085218364452864](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260085218364452864)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260175293009891328](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1260175293009891328)\n[https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1259771887598612487](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1259771887598612487)\n[https://twitter.com/SmashTheKernel/status/1259801643748667392](https://twitter.com/SmashTheKernel/status/1259801643748667392)\n[https://twitter.com/ni_fi_70/status/1259792444444606465](https://twitter.com/ni_fi_70/status/1259792444444606465)\n\n## Lessons from the Conti Leaks\n\n How Do You Run A Cybercrime Gang?\n\n Ransomware Decryption Intelligence\n\n\n-----",
