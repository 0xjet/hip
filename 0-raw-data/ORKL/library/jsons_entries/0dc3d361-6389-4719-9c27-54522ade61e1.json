What follows is a deep dive into who may be responsible for recruiting\nnew members to help spread the contagion.\n\nImage: Malwarebytes.\n\nLike most ransomware strains, the GandCrab ransomware-as-a-service offering held files on\ninfected systems hostage unless and until victims agreed to pay the demanded sum. But\nGandCrab far eclipsed the success of competing ransomware affiliate programs largely\nbecause its authors worked assiduously to update the malware so that it could evade\nantivirus and other security defenses.\n\n[In the 15-month span of the GandCrab affiliate enterprise beginning in January 2018, its](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gandcrab-raas-ad.txt)\ncurators shipped five major revisions to the code, each corresponding with sneaky new\nfeatures and bug fixes aimed at thwarting the efforts of computer security firms to stymie the\nspread of the malware.\n\n“In one year, people who worked with us have earned over US $2 billion,” read the farewell\npost by the eponymous GandCrab identity on the cybercrime forum Exploit[.]in, where the\ngroup recruited many of its distributors. “Our name became a generic term for ransomware in\nthe underground. The average weekly income of the project was equal to US $2.5 million.”\n\nThe message continued:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ourselves have earned over US $150 million in one year. This money has been\nsuccessfully cashed out and invested in various legal projects, both online and offline\nones. It has been a pleasure to work with you. But, like we said, all things come to an\nend. We are getting a well-deserved retirement. We are a living proof that you can do\nevil and get off scot-free. We have proved that one can make a lifetime of money in\none year. We have proved that you can become number one by general admission, not\nin your own conceit.”\n\nEvil indeed, when one considers the damage inflicted on so many individuals and\nbusinesses hit by GandCrab — easily the most rapacious and predatory malware of 2018\nand well into 2019.\n\nThe GandCrab identity on Exploit[.]in periodically posted updates about victim counts and\nransom payouts. For example, in late July 2018, GandCrab crowed that a single affiliate of\nthe ransomware rental service had infected 27,031 victims in the previous month alone,\nreceiving about $125,000 in commissions.\n\nThe following month, GandCrab bragged that the program in July 2018 netted almost\n425,000 victims and extorted more than one million dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, much\nof which went to affiliates who helped to spread the infections.\n\nRussian security firm Kaspersky Lab estimated that by the time the program ceased\noperations, GandCrab accounted for up to half of the global ransomware market.\n\n**ONEIILK2**\n\nIt remains unclear how many individuals were active in the core GandCrab malware\ndevelopment team. But KrebsOnSecurity located a number of clues that point to the real-life\nidentity of a Russian man who appears to have been put in charge of recruiting new affiliates\nfor the program.\n\nIn November 2018, a GandCrab affiliate posted a screenshot on the Exploit[.]in cybercrime\nforum of a private message between himself and a forum member known variously as\n“oneiilk2” and “oneillk2” that showed the latter was in charge of recruiting new members to\nthe ransomware earnings program.\n\nOneiilk2 also was a successful GandCrab affiliate in his own right. In May 2018, he could be\nseen in multiple Exploit[.]in threads asking for urgent help obtaining access to hacked\nbusinesses in South Korea. These solicitations go on for several weeks that month — with\nOneiilk2 saying he’s willing to pay top dollar for the requested resources. At the same time,\nOneiilk2 can be seen on Exploit asking for help figuring out how to craft a convincing\nmalware lure using the Korean alphabet.\n\n\n-----\n\nLater in the month, Oneiilk2 says he no longer needs assistance on that request. Just a few\nweeks later, security firms began warning that attackers were staging a spam campaign to\ntarget [South Korean businesses with version 4.3 of GandCrab.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-egg-files-in-spam-delivers-gandcrab-v4-3-ransomware-to-south-korean-users)\n\n**HOTTABYCH**\n\nWhen Oneiilk2 registered on Exploit in January 2015, he used the email address\n**hottabych_k2@mail.ru. That email address and nickname had been used since 2009 to**\nregister multiple identities on more than a half dozen cybercrime forums.\n\nIn 2010, the hottabych_k2 address was used to register the domain name dedserver[.]ru, a\nsite which marketed dedicated Web servers to individuals involved in various cybercrime\nprojects. That domain registration record included the Russian phone number +7-951**7805896, which mail.ru’s password recovery function says is indeed the phone number used**\nto register the hottabych_k2 email account.\n\nAt least four posts made in 2010 to the hosting review service makeserver.ru advertise\nDedserver and include images watermarked with the nickname “oneillk2.”\n\nDedserver also heavily promoted a virtual private networking (VPN) service called vpn**service[.]us to help users obfuscate their true online locations. It’s unclear how closely**\nconnected these businesses were, although a cached copy of the Dedserver homepage at\nArchive.org from 2010 suggests the site’s owners claimed it as their own.\n\nVpn-service[.]us was registered to the email address sec-service@mail.ru by an individual\nwho used the nickname (and sometimes password) — “Metall2” — across multiple\ncybercrime forums.\n\nAround the same time the GandCrab affiliate program was kicking into high gear, Oneiilk2\nhad emerged as one of the most trusted members of Exploit and several other forums. This\nwas evident by measuring the total “reputation points” assigned to him, which are positive or\nnegative feedback awarded by other members with whom the member has previously\ntransacted.\n\nIn late 2018, Oneiilk2 was one of the top 20 highest-rated members among thousands of\ndenizens on the Exploit forum, thanks in no small part to his association with the GandCrab\nenterprise.\n\nSearching on Oneiilk2’s registration email address hottabych_k2@mail.ru via sites that track\nhacked or leaked databases turned up some curious results. Those records show this\nindividual routinely re-used the same password across multiple accounts: 16061991.\n\nFor instance, that email address and password shows up in hacked password databases for\nan account “oneillk2” at zismo[.]biz, a Russian-language forum dedicated to news about\nvarious online money-making affiliate programs.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn [a post made on Zismo in 2017, Oneiilk2 states that he lives in a small town with a](http://10.10.0.46/ttps://zismo.biz/topic/938698-nuzhna-pomosch-po-raskrutke-gruppy/)\npopulation of around 400,000, and is engaged in the manufacture of furniture.\n\n**HEAVY METALL**\n\nFurther digging revealed that the hottabych_k2@mail.ru address had also been used to\nregister at least two accounts on the social networking site Vkontakte, the Russian-language\nequivalent of Facebook.\n\n[One of those accounts was registered to a “Igor Kashkov” from Magnitogorsk, Russia, a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitogorsk)\nmetal-rich industrial town in southern Russia of around 410,000 residents which is home to\nthe largest iron and steel works in the country.\n\nThe Kashkov account used the password “hottabychk2,” the phone number 890808981338,\nand at one point provided the alternative email address “prokopenko_k2@bk.ru.” However,\nthis appears to have been simply an abandoned account, or at least there are only a couple\nof sparse updates to the profile.\n\nThe [more interesting Vkontakte account tied to the hottabych_k2@mail.ru address belongs](https://vk.com/id11842857)\nto a profile under the name “Igor Prokopenko,” who says he also lives in Magnitogorsk. The\nIgor Prokopenko profile says he has studied and is interested in various types of metallurgy.\n\nThere is also a Skype voice-over-IP account tied to an “Igor” from Magnitogorsk whose listed\nbirthday is June 16, 1991. In addition, there is a fairly active Youtube account dating back to\n[2015 — youtube.com/user/Oneillk2 — that belongs to an Igor Prokopenko from](https://www.youtube.com/user/Oneillk2/videos)\nMagnitogorsk.\n\nThat Youtube account includes mostly short videos of Mr. Prokopenko angling for fish in a\n[local river and diagnosing problems with his Lada Kalina — a Russian-made automobile line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lada_Kalina)\nthat is quite common across Russia. An account created in January 2018 using the Oneillk2\n[nickname on a forum for Lada enthusiasts says its owner is 28 years old and lives in](http://www.lkforum.ru/showthread.php?p=6820879)\nMagnitogorsk.\n\nSources with the ability to check Russian citizenship records identified an Igor\n**Vladimirovich Prokopenko from Magnitogorsk who was born on June 16, 1991. Recall**\nthat “16061991” was the password used by countless online accounts tied to both\nhottabych_k2@mail.ru and the Oneiilk2/Oneillk2 identities.\n\nTo bring all of the above research full circle, Vkontakte’s password reset page shows that the\nIgor Prokopenko profile is tied to the mobile phone number +7-951-7805896, which is the\nsame number used to set up the email account hottabych_k2@mail.ru almost 10 years\nago.\n\nMr. Prokopenko did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is entirely possible that whoever is responsible for operating the GandCrab affiliate\nprogram developed an elaborate, years-long disinformation campaign to lead future wouldbe researchers to an innocent party.\n\nAt the same time, it is not uncommon for many Russian malefactors to do little to hide their\ntrue identities — at least early on in their careers — perhaps in part because they perceive\nthat there is little likelihood that someone will bother connecting the dots later on, or because\nmaybe they don’t fear arrest and/or prosecution while they reside in Russia. Anyone doubtful\n[about this dynamic would do well to consult the Breadcrumbs series on this blog, which used](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/breadcrumbs/)\nsimilar methods as described above to unmask dozens of other major malware purveyors.\n\nIt should be noted that the GandCrab affiliate program took measures to prevent the\ninstallation of its ransomware on computers residing in Russia or in any of the countries that\nwere previously part of the Soviet Union — referred to as the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates and including Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. This is a typical precaution taken by cybercriminals\nrunning malware operations from one of those countries, as they try to avoid making trouble\nin their own backyards that might attract attention from local law enforcement.\n\n[KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank domaintools.com (an advertiser on this site), as well as](https://www.domaintools.com/)\n[cyber intelligence firms Intel471,](https://intel471.com/) [Hold Security and](https://www.holdsecurity.com/) [4IQ for their assistance in researching](https://4iq.com/)\nthis post.\n\n**Update, July 9, 2:53 p.m. ET: Mr. Prokopenko responded to my requests for comment,**\nalthough he declined to answer any of the questions I put to him about the above findings.\nHis response was simply, “Hey. You’re wrong. I’m not doing this.” Silly me.\n\n\n-----",
