That infrastructure\nconsists of 1,647 Linux and Windows servers and 7,307 workstations,\" the university\nexplains in a management summary of the Fox-IT incident report and UM's response.\n\n\"The attack ultimately focused on 267 servers of the Windows domain. The attacker\nfocused on encrypting data files in the Windows domain. The backup of a limited number of\nsystems was also affected.\"\n\nUM says that all critical systems now have online and offline backups to avoid facing a\nfuture total failure scenario in the event of another ransomware attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Fox-IT connects TA505 to the attack\n\n\"The modus operandi of the group behind this specific attack comes over with a criminal\ngroup that already has one has a long history, and goes back to at least 2014,\" says Fox-IT\nin its full report to UM (in Dutch).\n\nTA505 (also tracked SectorJ04) is a financially motivated hacker group known for mainly\n[targeting retail companies and financial institutions since at least Q3 2014. (1,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter) [2)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leaked-ammyy-admin-source-code-turned-malware)\n\n[They are also known for using remote access Trojans (RATs) and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/trat-new-modular-rat-appears-multiple-email-campaigns) malware\ndownloaders that delivered the Dridex and Trick banking Trojans as secondary payloads\nduring their campaigns, as well as several ransomware strains including Locky, BitPaymer,\n[Philadelphia, GlobeImposter, and Jaff on their targets' computers[1,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-abusing-settingcontent-ms-within-pdf-files-distribute-flawedammyy-rat) [2] now also including](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-targets-us-retail-industry-personalized-attachments)\nClop ransomware after the attack on UM.\n\nAccording to Fox-IT, the hackers were able to infiltrate the university's systems via two\nphishing e-mails that were opened on two UM systems on October 15 and 16.\n\nUntil November 21 when they gained admin rights on an unpatched machine, the attackers\nmoved through UM's network compromising servers left and right until it finally deployed\nthe Clop ransomware payload on 267 Windows systems.\n\nThe university paid the ransom to have the files decrypted on December 30 after closely\nanalyzing the options including rebuilding all infected systems from scratch or attempting to\ncreate a decryptor.\n\n\"During the investigation, traces were found that show that the attacker collected data\nregarding the topology of the network, usernames, and passwords of multiple accounts, and\nother network architecture information,\" the report summary says.\n\nAlso, Fox-IT says that it \"did not find any traces within the scope of the investigation that\npoint to the collection of other types of data.\"\n\n## Ransom paid to avoid data loss and months of downtime\n\nAfter the attack, UM secured the services of security company Fox-IT to assist with the\nincident's forensic investigation, the crisis management process, and to provide advice\n[during the recovery according to official statements part of a press conference from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik-ZVvZ2-xU)\nFebruary 5.\n\nWhile UM added that the forensic research \"indicates how cybercriminals have taken some\nof UM's data hostage,\" research and personal data was not exfiltrated.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the university will continue investigating if this conclusion is 100% accurate via\n\"follow-up research into possible extraction\" of important data files representative\nof education, research, and business operations as Fox-IT recommends.\n\nUM also disclosed that it acquired the ransomware decryptor from the attackers by paying a\n30 bitcoin ransom (roughly $220,000 or €220,000) to restore all the encrypted files\nas [Reuters reported.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybercrime-netherlands-university/university-of-maastricht-says-it-paid-hackers-200000-euro-ransom-idUSKBN1ZZ2HH)\n\nThis allowed UM to avoid having to rebuild all the compromised systems from scratch,\nlosing all the research, educational, and staff data and delaying exams and salary\npayments to the university's 4,500 employees.\n\n\"It is a decision that was not taken lightly by the Executive Board. But it was also a decision\nthat had to be made,\" UM [says. \"We felt, in consultation with our management and our](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/file/cyberattackresponseumfoxitmanagementsummary05-02-2020enpdf)\nsupervisory bodies, that we could not make any other responsible choice when considering\nthe interests of our students and staff.\n\n\"The fact that on 6 January and thereafter we were able to have teaching and exams take\nplace, more or less as planned, that UM researchers suffered little or no irreparable\ndamage, and that we were also able to make the salary payments for 4,500 employees on\ntime, strengthens our confidence that we made the right choice.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Austin Peay State University resumes after ransomware cyber attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/austin-peay-state-university-resumes-after-ransomware-cyber-attack/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Netherlands](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/netherlands/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[TA505](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ta505/)\n[University](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/university/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
