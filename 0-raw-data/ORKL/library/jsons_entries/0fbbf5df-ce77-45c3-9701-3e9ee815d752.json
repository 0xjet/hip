So, I picked the\nUnited States as the second one, and hopefully will continue with more of these in the future.\n\nIn the case of the US it was harder since there are very limited details publicly available. The\nmain sources that I used for this one were (full list of sources used below the diagram):\n\nGovernment leaks (E. Snowden, Wikileaks, Shadow Brokers, etc.)\nStatements from government officials in reputable news outlets\n\nYou might notice that I didn’t expand the CYBERCOM (which is massive) and the reason is\nthat although it’s [publicly known that it now performs offensive cyber operations, there is no](https://www.fifthdomain.com/dod/cybercom/2019/05/08/new-authorities-mean-lots-of-new-missions-at-cyber-command/)\npublicly known APT association. So, I decided to avoid making this a huge diagram for no\nreason. Same with the NSA that has multiple other divisions/offices performing cyber\noperations but there is no publicly known APT associated with them either.\n\nI hope I got it right, but if you notice any mistakes, missing details or incorrect information\nplease let me know to update it accordingly.\n\n_Last update: 29 APRIL 2021_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sources\n\n ChangeLog\n\nVersion 2.5 (29 April 2021): Kaspersky Labs correlated Lamberts with Longhorn APT\ngroup. Added it.\nVersion 2.2 (23 April 2021): Add APT-C-39 to CCI and remove Vault 7 from TAO\nVersion 2.0 (18 April 2021): Update SLINGSHOT attribution (thanks to Midwest and\n[@slaeryan)](https://twitter.com/slaeryan)\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion 1.0 (18 April 2021): First publication.\n\nWritten by xorl\n\nApril 18, 2021 at 11:53\n\n[Posted in threat intelligence](https://xorl.wordpress.com/category/threat-intelligence/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
