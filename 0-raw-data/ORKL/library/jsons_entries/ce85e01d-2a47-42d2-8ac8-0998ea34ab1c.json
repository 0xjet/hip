Through a joint\nanalysis of these attack incidents, we find that the hacker team that launched the attack is\nhighly professional and has a powerful arsenal. The targets of the attack are of extremely\nhigh value, so we don’t think this is purely personal behavior, But a professional hacker team\nor APT organization.\n\nWhen analyzing the organization’s CVE-2017-11882 exploit document, we found that the\nway to bypass the shellcode length limitation is similar to that used by the APT organization\nTA505, but the delivered payload is in favor of publicly sold malware such as NanoCore,\nFormbook, etc., did not find any Tema ever used by TA505. So we are not sure if this attack\nwas initiated by TA505.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, in order to facilitate the continuous follow-up of the organization, we named the\nattack “Bayworld”, and we will continue to track and study more attacks related to the\norganization.\n\n**Attack target**\n\nWe analyzed the machines that infected a series of Trojan horses and found that the main\nattack targets of BayWorld activities were concentrated in large enterprises with import and\nexport business, covering medical, chemical, construction, and various new manufacturing\nindustries. Major regional transport companies, as well as a number of important maritime\nports launched attacks.\n\nThe attack area is mainly distributed in China, Egypt, Ukraine and other countries. The main\nattack targets are the Suez Canal, Algiers Port, Youzny Sea Port and other important\ncommercial ports. The regional distribution is shown in the following figure:\n\n**Decoy document**\n\nWe analyzed the phishing emails related to Bayworld activities from August 2019. The\nmalicious document attachments carried in the emails are mainly divided into the following\nthree categories:\n\n1. Contains macro viruses\n2. Contains CVE-2017-8570 vulnerability\n3. Contains CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\nThe contents of the phishing emails are relatively simple. After the embarrassment, the\nvictims will be reminded to open the attached file:\n\nAttachments are usually disguised as purchase orders, payment vouchers, account\nstatements, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CVE-2017-11882\n\nUnlike most previous CVE-2017-11882 exploits, Bayworld uses malicious code in xlsx files.\nWhen overflowing, it uses a 30-byte shellcode to dynamically obtain the memory pointer of\nthe MTEFData structure and locate the remaining shellcode. In order to bypass the limit on\nthe length of shellcode when exploiting.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis method is not the first time to appear. We found that a similar use method was\nmentioned in the analysis report of the TA505 hacker organization by friends and merchants,\nbut based on one point, we are not sure that the Bayworld was initiated by the TA505 hacker\norganization.\n\n## CVE-2017-8570\n\nThe CVE-2017-8570 exploit document contains two key ole objects. The first is a Package\ntype malicious scriptletfile (SCT) script. After the malicious document is opened, the Package\nobject is automatically released to the% temp% directory.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second is an OLE2Link object, which is used to trigger the SCT script released to a\nrandom directory\n\nThe SCT script is used to download subsequent payloads.\n\n**Malicious macro**\n\nIn addition to exploiting vulnerabilities, a large number of macro viruses have also been used\nin Bayworld activities. The macro code has been obfuscated. After multiple decryptions, it will\ncall powershell to execute the following script:\n\n\n-----\n\nAdd C # code to the current session via Add-Type and execute:\n\nThen bypass AMSI detection through Patch AmsiScanBuffer, and finally download and\nexecute the payload.\n\n**PayLoad**\n\nDuring our analysis of the activities of BayWorld, we found that there are many types of\npayloads delivered by them, covering the following types of mainstream remote control and\nspyware.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, I also detected a small amount of malware from families such as Ave_Maria and\nNjRat. These malware have powerful functions, and hackers can control the victim’s machine\nand perform any desired operation through this software.\n\n**Covert means**\n\nIn addition to using IP addresses in some URLs, most of them use dynamic domain names\nto hide real server addresses:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Summary**\n\nBayworld is a well-targeted and highly professional cyber attack campaign. The hacking\ngang behind it has a powerful arsenal and diverse attack methods. It uses a large number of\nobfuscated codes and dynamic domain names in the entire attack process. At the same\ntime, its own characteristics are well hidden.\n\n360 Total Security can intercept such cyber attacks in multiple dimensions. Users could\ninstall and use it:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Learn more about 360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n\n-----",
