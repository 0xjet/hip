The hacker organization sent a phishing email to the victim by\nforging a police station investigation letter, COVID-19 detection notice, etc., Through the\nbackdoor virus to control the victim’s machine, steal valuable sensitive data related to the target.\n\nThe PDB path of the virus samples used by the organization points to a user named “Vendetta”,\nand we will later also name the hacker organization Vendetta:\n\n“C:\\Users\\Vendetta\\source\\repos\\{project name}\\*\\obj\\Debug\\{project name}.pdb”\n\nIn some samples, we have repeatedly detected the following tags, the virus author claims that he\nis from Italy:\n\nHowever, we found in the naming of\nvirus samples that virus authors like to\nuse certain Turkish names to name\nvariables, such as “RoboSki”, so we\nsuspect that the organization originated\nin Europe:\n\nVendetta is a hacker organization that is very good at using social engineering. They forge\nphishing emails very realistically. They can easily gain users’ trust and guide users to open the\nmalicious programs they carry.\n\nThe picture below is a Vendetta forgery of the investigation letter issued by the Austrian Federal\nMinistry of the Interior (BMI)\n\n\n-----\n\nForged investigation letter from the Romanian police station:\n\n\n-----\n\nForged the COVID-19 virus test email issued by the Australian Government Department of\nHealth. The email stated that the victim had contact with a confirmed case within the past 14\ndays. It is recommended to read the test guide in the attachment and accept the test:\n\n\n-----\n\nForged a virus test email issued by the Mexican health department:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs well as the forged email quoted by the Egyptian Orascom Group:.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe compressed file in the email attachment contains the Trojan file, which is generally named\nafter pdf.exe, Document.exe, etc. After running, it decrypts and loads the subsequent virus\nmodule in memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n## RoboSki\n\nIn all samples, we detected the same type of code obfuscator, and according to its PDB\ndebugging path, we named it RoboSki:\n\nRoboSki encrypts and stores the shellcode in the pixels of the picture. The following figure is the\ncode logic to extract the available pixel data and decrypt the shellcode:\n\n\n-----\n\n**ReZer0**\n\nThe execution logic of ReZer0 is controlled by hard-coded built-in instructions. According to\ndifferent instructions, different malicious functions are executed. Its design logic resembles the\ndesign method of backdoor programs:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have sorted out the hard-coded instructions and their corresponding meanings, most of which\nare not used:\n\n### Hardcode[x] Description\n\n 0 [0] == 4 load the plugin from the resource into memory\n\n [0]! = 4 Inject the plugin in the resource into the system process to execute\n\n 1 Whether to register scheduled tasks\n\n 4 Download and execute any file\n\n 5 Download file URL\n\n 6 The execution path of the downloaded file\n\n\n-----\n\n### 7 Whether to detect the virtual machine\n\n 8 Whether to detect sandbox\n\n 9 ByPass antivirus software\n\n 29 Show file version\n\n 34 Sleep()\n\n 35 Sleep duration\n\nIn the 360 massive data, we found that ReZer0 has an obvious version identification. In\nconjunction with the above-mentioned large number of instructions used, we speculate that the\nsoftware is still in the development stage, and it will not be ruled out that the program will be\ncontrolled through network communication in the future:\n\nIn addition to the nature of the backdoor virus, ReZer0 also carries known remote control Trojans\nsuch as NanoCore and Remcos in the resources. We will not repeat the remote control functions\nsuch as NanoCore. We take some of the victims of Vendetta as an example to speculate the\npurpose of their actions.\n\n\n-----\n\nPassion Fruit Company of Australia (PAI) is a representative institution and a non-profit\nmembership organization that supports the passion fruit industry in Australia. PAI is an umbrella\norganization that represents and enhances the interests of everyone in the passion fruit industry,\nincluding growers, packers, wholesalers, exporters, researchers, and retail stores.\n\nOf course, Vendetta’s attack target is not only the PAI family. We have roughly described the\ndistribution of Vendetta’s attack target by statistically the distribution of related samples, and its\nattack purpose is to steal related commercial information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Summary**\n\nVendetta is an active hacking organization that started in April 2020. The organization may have\noriginated in Europe. It is good at using social engineering to launch cyber attacks. The purpose\nof the attack is to steal targeted business intelligence.\n\n**C2:**\n\n172.111.188.199:8829\n\n**Md5:**\n\ne73d9b2eba5e818cd4699f1484af5bce\n\ndabbfc6a7d939c4c41fb2c7cee295220\n\ndd93825ca5bd3afda1c238ce2ded84e1\n\n500dc2b3fbea8f13b29f494afb9465ec\n\n2106b19ffb7bf327d64d4cd6bdb606b4\n\ne73d9b2eba5e818cd4699f1484af5bce\n\n[Learn more about 360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n\n-----",
