This blog links this recent activity with**\n**previous isolated public reporting on similar attacks we believe are related. We refer to these attacks as**\n**MuddyWater due to the confusion in attributing these attacks. Although the activity was previously linked**\n**by others to the FIN7 threat actor group, our research suggests the activity is in fact espionage related**\n**and unlikely to be FIN7 related.**\n\n**The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However, we have also observed**\n**attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater**\n**attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor we call�**\n**“POWERSTATS”. Despite broad scrutiny and reports on MuddyWater attacks, the activity continues with**\n**only incremental changes to the tools and techniques.**\n\n## Introduction & Overview\n\n**The Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 research team recently came across a series of malicious files which�**\n**were almost identical to those targeting the Saudi Arabian government previously discussed by**\n**[MalwareBytes. Which in turn, closely resembles a previous article by Morphisec. These attacks have also](http://blog.morphisec.com/fileless-attack-framework-discovery)**\n**[been tracked by several other researchers on Twitter and elsewhere.](https://sec0wn.blogspot.sg/2017/10/continued-activity-targeting-middle-east.html)**\n\n**The activity has been consistent throughout 2017 and, based on our analysis, targets or is suspected to**\n**target, entities in the following countries:**\n\n**Saudi Arabia**\n**Iraq**\n**Israel**\n**United Arab Emirates**\n**Georgia**\n**India**\n**Pakistan**\n**Turkey**\n**USA**\n\n**The malicious documents were adjusted according to the target regions, often using the logos of**\n**branches of local government, prompting the users to bypass security controls and enable macros. An**\n**overview of the technical changes seen in the past year is given in the graphic below, note that raw IOCs**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1.

In some of their recent**\n**attack documents, the attackers also used GitHub as a hosting site for their custom backdoor,**\n**POWERSTATS. Specifically, the following GitHub repositories appear to be controlled by the�**\n**MuddyWater threat actor(s):**\n\n**[unknown SHA256]**\n\n**Downloads payload from:**\n**hxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/F0R3X/BrowserFontArabic/master/ArabicBrowserFont.exe**\n\n**[unknown SHA256]**\n\n**Downloads payload from:**\n**hxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/F0R3X/BrowserFontArabic/master/FontArabic.exe**\n\n**9b5e36bb7518a9e333c31d09b589102f89e3425571dd434820ab3c437dc4e0d9 (and several**\n**others)**\n\n**Downloads payload from:**\n**hxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/ReactDeveloper2017/react/master/src/test/test.js**\n\n**Interestingly, both profiles were populated with forked repositories to give them an air of legitimacy as�**\n**[shown in figure 2. The POWERSTATS malware was compiled as an exe using �PS2EXE. However, this](https://github.com/vergl4s/pentesting-dump/blob/master/net/Windows/PS2EXE-v0.5.0.0/ps2exe.ps1)**\n**was a minor anomaly, as it was only seen in this case: raw scripts being used in all other cases.**\n\n**_Figure 2_** **_The GitHub profile for F0R3X containing both legitimate forked code and the binaries created�_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_attribution to FIN7._**\n\n## Pwn one to pwn them all\n\n**In some of the instances we observed what appeared to be compromised accounts at third party**\n**organizations sending the malware. In one case, the attackers sent a malicious document which was**\n**nearly identical to a legitimate attachment which we observed later being sent to the same recipient. This**\n**indicates that the attackers stole and modified a legitimate document from the compromised user�**\n**account, crafted a malicious decoy Word macro document using this stolen document and sent it to the**\n**target recipient who might be expecting the email from the original account user before the real sender**\n**had time to send it.**\n\n**This targeting of third party organizations to attack further targets is a risky move on the attackers’ part,**\n**as it potentially reveals their activity within the compromised third party organizations to the new target**\n**(those receiving the malicious documents**\n\n## Making sense of MuddyWater\n\n**When we looked at the cluster of activity which consisted of what appeared to be espionage-focused**\n**attacks in the Middle East, we were somewhat confused as the previous public reporting had attributed**\n**these attacks to FIN7. FIN7 is a threat actor group that is financially motivated with targets in the�**\n**restaurant, services and financial sectors. Following the trail of existing public reporting, the tie to FIN7 is�**\n**essentially made based on a download observed from a MuddyWater C2, of a non-public tool**\n**“DNSMessenger”.**\n\n**[For example, Morphisec wrote:](http://blog.morphisec.com/fileless-attack-framework-discovery)**\n\n**“Later in our investigation, the same command server also delivered a variant**\n**[of the DNS messenger similar to that described by Talos. The domain names](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/dnsmessenger.html)**\n**differed but the script adheres to the same logic (including the logic**\n**function).”**\n\n**The DNSMessenger malware is an obfuscated and customized version of the popular**\n**[DNS_TXT_PWNAGE.ps1 script available on GitHub and is also referred to by FireEye as](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Backdoors/DNS_TXT_Pwnage.ps1)**\n**POWERSOURCE. The use of the DNSMessenger tool appears primarily linked to FIN7, with no other**\n**samples being attributable to MuddyWater.**\n\n**This led us to query the relationship between the newer attacks we were looking at and the alleged FIN7**\n**link. As part of this research, we came up with the following hypotheses along with their likelihoods, and**\n**a rationale for each one.**\n\n**1) The FIN7 threat actor is also involved in espionage in the Middle East – Unlikely**\n\n**Whilst this may seem an attractive hypothesis to some, there are aspects on the technical side that**\n**simply don’t add up. Primarily, there are significant disparities between FIN7 and MuddyWater,�**\n**specifically in terms of:�**\n\n**Malware unique to FIN7, or commonly used by them has not yet been seen in any MuddyWater**\n**investigations (except for the single observation of the DNSMessenger sample)**\n**Other non-public malware and tools used by MuddyWater have not been observed in our FIN7**\n**investigations.**\n**From an infrastructure point of view there is no overlap between the two sets of activity, the only**\n**overlap is the use of the unique tool “DNSMessenger”**\n\n**When these points are considered together in conjunction with the significant difference in targeting they�**\n**make a strong case for classifying this activity as distinct from FIN7 activity.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We have attempted to find examples of code available in public data sources that would generate the�**\n**variation of the DNSMessenger malware and had little luck in doing so. Even though the code for**\n**DNSMessenger is publicly available following research into attackers published by 3 parties, attackersrd**\n**would have to write the corresponding server side to use it, and as such they may well choose to use the**\n**public DNS_TXT_Pwnage.ps1 script instead.**\n\n**Despite this, based on the chain of analysis above we cannot discount the notion that DNSMessenger is**\n**shared by multiple attackers, including FIN7 and MuddyWater.**\n\n**3) There was a mistake in the original Morphisec analysis which linked these attacks to FIN7 –**\n**Possible**\n\n**Little detail is given on the nature of how the connection between DNSMessenger and MuddyWater was**\n**discovered it isn’t possible for us to verify this link.**\n\n**4) The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag – Possible�**\n\n**The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag on their C2 server,�**\n**uploading a copy of the FIN7 DNSMessenger code which had been previously mentioned (and was since**\n**publicly available) by FireEye and delivering it to researchers to trick them into mis-attributing the**\n**campaign.**\n\n**Indeed, the sample shared by Morphisec on PasteBin is identical to the one dropped by the sample**\n**discussed in the FireEye FIN7 SEC campaign blog except for the final line.�**\n\n## Final thoughts\n\n**Whilst we could conclude with confidence that the attacks discussed in this article are not FIN7 related,�**\n**we were not able to answer many of our questions about the MuddyWater attacks. We are currently**\n**unable to make a firm conclusion about the origin of the attackers, or the specific types of information�**\n**they seek out once on a network. In any case we will continue to track their activities to provide**\n**protections for our customers.**\n\n**We hope the analysis presented shows the importance of drawing your own conclusions based on the**\n**data available to you, not just taking the conclusions given in the public domain at face value. This is**\n**especially true when actors who rely on slightly modified (and publicly available) open source tools are in�**\n**play. Copycat threat actors can easily mimic attackers who use open source tools which can confuse**\n**attribution efforts meaning more than one aspect of the attacks observed must be considered when�**\n**clustering.**\n\n**On top of this, whilst the vast majority of threat analysis in the public domain is repeatable and correct, in**\n**some cases it can be difficult to verify the analysis available. When it is hard to reproduce the analysis�**\n**the confidence in any conclusions drawn must be lower than it would otherwise be, since you cannot�**\n**know for sure that what is stated is true.**\n\n**Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:**\n\n**WildFire and Traps detect all the malware supported in this report as malicious.**\n**Traps
