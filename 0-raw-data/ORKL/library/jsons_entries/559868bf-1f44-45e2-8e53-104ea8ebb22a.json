The update mechanism was used to drop a malicious update via a\nzip file “Passwordstate_upgrade.zip” containing a rogue dll “moserware.secretsplitter.dll”.\nThe company mentions that the C&C of the rogue dll was using a CDN (Content Delivery\nNetwork) that was terminated on the 22nd of April 2021 7:00am UTC.\n\nCSIS Security Group researchers discovered one of the rogue dll's during an investigation.\nWe will try to share the IoC's that we have discovered in order for companies to determine if\nthey have been impacted by this attack. We have dubbed this incident/malware\n\"Moserpass\".\n\nThe rogue dll that we discovered was the dll named \"Moserware.SecretSplitter.dll\" that was\ninjected/modified with a malicious code snippet. A small code “Loader” was added to the\noriginal dll:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious code tries to contact the following URL:\nhttps://passwordstate-18ed2.kxcdn[.]com/upgrade_service_upgrade.zip\n\n- in order to retrieve an encrypted code using method \"Container.Get()\", AES (Advanced\nEncryption Standard) decrypt it using the password: f4f15dddc3ba10dd443493a2a8a526b0,\nand then pass it to the Loader Class(). Once decrypted, the code is executed directly in\nmemory.\n\nAt the time of writing, the C&C is down, and unfortunately we didn’t manage to retrieve the\n2nd stage payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nClickStudios mentioned more than 29000 prestigious customers worldwide. We assume this\nattack could potentially have impacted a large number of these customers.\n\nAs recommended by ClickStudios, if you are using Passwordstate, please reset all the stored\npasswords, and especially VPNs, Firewall, Switches, local accounts or any server passwords\netc.\n\nWe have located two differerent samples, but we expect that more variants with different\nC&Cs, are being used.\n\n**IOCs**\nMalicious dll:\n\nf23f9c2aaf94147b2c5d4b39b56514cd67102d3293bdef85101e2c05ee1c3bf9\n\nMoserware.SecretSplitter.dll\n\nUser-Agent:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/89.0.4389.128 Safari/537.36\n\nC&C:\n\nhttps://passwordstate-18ed2.kxcdn[.]com/upgrade_service_upgrade.zip\n\nIn fact the complete URL would be something like:\n\nhttps://passwordstate-18ed2.kxcdn[.]com/upgrade_service_upgrade.zip?\nid=132636829278221866 where the value \"132636829278221866\" is the actual UTC time.\nThe value here is equal to: GMT: Friday, April 23, 2021 8:22:07 PM.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional C&Cs:\npasswordstate-18ed0.kxcdn[.]com\npasswordstate-18ed1.kxcdn[.]com\npasswordstate-18ed4.kxcdn[.]com\npasswordstate-18ed5.kxcdn[.]com\n\nUpdate from Clickstudios (links to PDF):\n\nhttps://www.clickstudios.com.au/advisories/Incident_Management_Advisory-0120210424.pdf\n\n\n-----",
