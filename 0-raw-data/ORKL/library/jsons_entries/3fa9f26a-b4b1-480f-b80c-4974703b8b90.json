This adversary appears to be primarily\nfocused on gaining and maintaining access to entities possessing sensitive information of\n**likely intelligence interest to the Iranian government.**\n\nBehavioral indicators and other traits suggest PIONEER KITTEN is likely a contract\n**element operating in support of the Iranian government, rather than one operated by the**\ngovernment itself. Industry reporting has linked PIONEER KITTEN activity to multiple Iranian\nadversaries; however, CrowdStrike Intelligence considers these claims to be circumstantial®\nand lacking in sufficient corroborative data to enable confirmation of such relationships.\n\nIn late July 2020, an actor assessed to be associated with PIONEER KITTEN was identified\nas advertising to sell access to compromised networks on an underground forum. That\nactivity is suggestive of a potential attempt at revenue stream diversification on the part of\nPIONEER KITTEN, alongside its targeted intrusions in support of the Iranian government.\nThe types of entities the actor associated with PIONEER KITTEN claims to have\ncompromised would be of significant intelligence value to the Iranian government. As such, it\nis unlikely this commercial activity by PIONEER KITTEN is sanctioned by the Iranian\ngovernment, since the commercial sale of such access would have significant negative\nimpacts on potential intelligence collection operations.\n\n## PIONEER KITTEN Methods\n\nPIONEER KITTEN tradecraft is characterized by a pronounced reliance on exploits of\n**remote external services on internet-facing assets to achieve initial access to victims, as**\nwell as an almost total reliance on open-source tooling during operations.\n\nThe adversary is particularly interested in exploits related to VPNs and network\n**appliances, including CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-19781, and most recently CVE-2020-**\n5902; reliance on exploits such as these lends to an opportunistic operational model.\n\nPIONEER KITTEN’s namesake operational characteristic is its reliance on SSH tunneling,\nthrough open-source tools such as Ngrok and the adversary’s custom tool SSHMinion, for\ncommunication with implants and hands-on-keyboard activity via Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP).\n\n## PIONEER KITTEN’s Targets\n\nIdentified PIONEER KITTEN targeting to date has centered around North American and\nIsraeli entities of likely intelligence interest to the Iranian government. Target sectors include\ntechnology, government, defense, healthcare, aviation, media, academic, engineering,\n\n\n-----\n\nconsulting and professional services, chemical, manufacturing, financial services, insurance,\nand retail.\n\nThe widespread nature of PIONEER KITTEN’s target scope is likely a result of the\nadversary’s opportunistic operational model; the entities apparently of most interest to the\nadversary are technology, government, defense, and healthcare organizations.\n\n## Other Known “ADVERSARIES”\n\nPIONEER KITTEN is just one of many adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence.\nSome of the other threat adversaries that CrowdStrike monitors include the following:\n\n[HELIX KITTEN](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-november-helix-kitten/)\n[FANCY BEAR](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/)\n[MYTHIC LEOPARD](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/adversary-of-the-month-for-may/)\n[GOBLIN PANDA](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-august-goblin-panda/)\n\nCurious about other eCrime, hacktivist or nation-state adversaries?
