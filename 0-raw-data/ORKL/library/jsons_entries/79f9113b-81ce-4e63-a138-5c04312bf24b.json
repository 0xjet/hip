The Keeper exfiltration and attacker domains use identical login\npanels and are linked to the same dedicated server; this server hosts both the\nmalicious payload and the exfiltrated data stolen from victim sites.\nOver 85% of the victim sites operated on the Magento CMS, which is known to be the\ntop target for Magecart attacks and boasts over 250,000 users worldwide. The country\nhosting the largest selection of these victim e-commerce sites was the United States,\nfollowed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\n\n-----\n\nGemini uncovered an unsecured access log on the Keeper control panel with 184,000\ncompromised cards with time stamps ranging from July 2018 to April 2019.\nExtrapolating the number of cards per nine months to Keeper’s overall lifespan, and\ngiven the dark web median price of $10 per compromised Card Not Present (CNP)\ncard, this group has likely generated upwards of $7 million USD from selling\ncompromised payment cards.\nThe Keeper Magecart group has been active for three years, over which time it has\ncontinually improved its technical sophistication and the scale of its operations. Based\non this pattern of successful Magecart attacks, Gemini assesses with high confidence\nthat Keeper is likely to continue launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against\nonline merchants across the world.\n\n## Background\n\nIn mid-2020, Magecart attacks have become a daily occurrence for small to medium-sized ecommerce businesses in the United States as well as the rest of the world. Operating on an\noutdated content management system (CMS), utilizing unpatched add-ons, or having\nadministrators’ credentials compromised through sequel injections leaves e-commerce\nmerchants vulnerable to a variety of different attack vectors. Over the past six months, the\nGemini team has uncovered thousands of Magecart attacks ranging from simple dynamic\ninjection of malicious code using a criminally hosted domain, to leveraging Google Cloud or\nGitHub storage services and using steganography to embed malicious payment cardstealing code into an active domain’s logos and images. The criminals behind this threat\nconstantly evolve and improve their techniques to prey on unsuspecting victims who do not\nemphasize domain security.\n\nAs has been previously reported, there are numerous stand-alone Magecart groups that\nactively use unique methods to target hundreds and thousands of e-commerce sites yearly.\n[One such group was responsible for compromising a Volusion CMS, in turn infecting over](https://geminiadvisory.io/breached-volusion-card-data-surfaces-in-dark-web/)\n6,000 e-commerce sites with payment card-stealing scripts for nearly a month in the third\nquarter of 2019.\n\nWhile analyzing numerous Magecart attacks, Gemini successfully established a full link\nbetween an active Magecart group, its techniques, indicators of compromised (IOCs),\nevolving tactics, victims, and an estimated number of cards offered for sale. The Gemini\nteam has named this group “Keeper” based on its repeated usage of a single domain called\nfileskeeper[.]org to inject malicious payment card-stealing JavaScript (JS) into the website’s\nHTML code, as well as receive compromised card data. Analysis revealed that the Keeper\ngroup includes an interconnected network of 64 attacker domains used to deliver malicious\nJS payloads (see Appendix A) and 73 exfiltration domains used to receive stolen payment\ncards data from victim domains (see Appendix B). This network targeted over 570 victim ecommerce sites in 55 different countries from April 1, 2017 until the present.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1: Keeper’s attacker domains, targets, and exfiltration domains affected 55 countries\nworldwide.\n\n## In-Depth Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n**Keeper**\n\nThe Keeper group, much like many other Magecart groups, attempted to disguise its\nmalicious attacker domains as legitimate services, or, in this case, even legitimate sites.\nSeveral of the attacker domains attempted to closely imitate legitimate site names by\nchanging the top-level domain or several characters within the domain name. For example,\n[the attacker domain closetlondon[.]org attempted to imitate closetlondon.com. In addition to](https://closetlondon.com/)\nimitating legitimate site names, this group also attempted to imitate popular website plugins\nand payment gateways.\n\nGemini determined that Keeper’s exfiltration and attacker domains use identical login panels\nand are linked to the same dedicated server; this server hosts both the malicious payload\nand the exfiltrated data stolen from victim sites. Below is an example of how a dedicated\nserver is used to host Magecart infrastructure responsible for collecting compromised card\ndata from numerous e-commerce domains.\n\nImage 2: Dedicated server hosting Magecart infrastructure designed to collect payment card\ndata from target domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: Keeper utilized an identical login panel for all of its exfiltration URLs, which were\nconnected to a single dedicated server.\nOver 85% of the victim sites operated on the Magento CMS, which is known to be the top\ntarget for Magecart attacks and boasts over 250,000 users worldwide. The country hosting\nthe largest selection of these victim e-commerce sites was the United States, at 28%,\nfollowed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 4: List of compromised domains by country or territory.\n\nImage 5: CMS distribution by victim sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the analysis of the dedicated server and numerous hosted exfiltration and attacker\ndomains, Gemini was able to identify over 570 individuals attacks on numerous e-commerce\nsites across the world that occurred between April 2017 and the present (see Appendix C).\nBy analyzing victim domains and the payload scripts that were used to infect them, analysts\ndiscovered the evolution of obfuscation and data collection methods.\n\n**[April 1, 2017: One of the initial attacks was carried out against dressedinwhite.com](http://dressedinwhite.com/)**\nthrough the attacker domain js-storage[.]click. The Keeper group utilized public\nobfuscation methods, which made it simple to decode. The JS payload was created to\nfocus primarily on two specific payment card data fields (card number and expiration\ndate), but also to gather all other available fields on the checkout page.\n\n**[August 9, 2018: The online bicycle merchant milkywayshop.it was infected by the](http://milkywayshop.it/)**\nattacker domain dobell[.]su. The malicious JS payload was hiding in plain sight and did\nnot have any private or public obfuscation and displayed the payload in cleartext. The\npayload collected all of the data from the fields commonly seen on the checkout page,\nsuch as card data, billing information, and additional personally identifiable information\n(PII).\n\nImage 6: Collected data field on the MilkyWayShop website.\n\n**November 26, 2018: From November 2018 to the present, the threat actors have used**\ncustom obfuscation methods. This was first identified in the infection of\n[casterdepot.com. The JS payload was injected by the attacker domain](http://casterdepot.com/)\nswappastore[.]com and collected information from all commonly seen fields on the\ncheckout page, such as card data, billing information, and additional PII.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Image 7: The custom obfuscation used in the malicious script targeting casterdepot.com.](http://casterdepot.com/)\nThe decrypted string is on the right-hand side of the image.\n\n**January 6, 2019: The attacker script was modified and it appeared to be much cleaner**\nand more concise with no displayed line breaks. This was seen in the infection of\n[nomin.net by the attacker domain scriptvault[.]org. The Keeper group currently uses](http://nomin.net/)\nthis format for its payloads and denotes specific payment card, billing address, and\nadditional information fields that it collects.\n\nImage 8: The most recent format of the Keeper group’s malicious payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n[During the analysis of an ongoing infection in one of the victim URLs, fiushafashion.com,](http://fiushafashion.com/)\nGemini conducted a test transaction with fictitious data and decrypted, then decoded the\nmalicious payment request. Gemini analysts noted that the payment card data, billing\ninformation, additional PII, and source URL were exfiltrated to the Keeper exfiltration domain\nassetstorage[.]net.\n\n\n-----\n\nImages 9-11: Encrypted test payment request (top), decrypted and encoded test payment\nrequest (middle), and decrypted and decoded test payment request (bottom).\n\n**Total Revenue**\n\nDuring the historical analysis of the Keeper group, Gemini uncovered an unsecured\naccess.log on the Keeper control panel on April 24, 2019. This access log stored 184,000\ncompromised cards with time stamps ranging from July 2018 to April 2019. This likely\nindicated the total number of cards collected from numerous Keeper infections during this\ntime period. Based on the provided number of collected cards during a nine-month window,\nand accounting for the group’s operations since April 2017, Gemini estimates that it has\nlikely collected close to 700,000 compromised cards. Given the current dark web median\nprice of $10 per compromised Card Not Present (CNP) card, this group has likely generated\nupwards of $7 million USD from stealing and selling compromised payment cards in its full\nlifespan.\n\n**Targets**\n\nThe 570 victim e-commerce sites were made up of small to medium-sized merchants and\nwere scattered across 55 different countries. Gemini analyzed the size of the victims’ sites\nusing Amazon’s Alexa Rank, which generates a basic score based on daily unique visitors\nand the number of pageviews. Victims with the top Alexa Global Ranking received anywhere\nfrom 500,000 to over one million visitors each month and were responsible for selling\nelectronics, clothing, jewelry, custom promotional products, and liquor. The table below\nprovides several examples of the most affected merchants with top Alexa Global Ranking\n(meaning more traffic per website).\n\n**Domain** **Infection Date** **Description**\n\n[alkaramstudio.com](http://alkaramstudio.com/) February 2018 Pakistan-based clothing store\n\n[arb.co.za](http://arb.co.za/) December 2019 South Africa-based electrical wholesaler\n\n[cwspirits.com](http://cwspirits.com/) April 2020 US-based premier wine and spirits seller\n\n[ejohri.com](http://ejohri.com/) February 2020 India-based online jewelry store\n\n[hirschs.co.za](http://hirschs.co.za/) April 2018 South Africa-based appliance and electronics\nstore\n\n[ibox.co.id](http://ibox.co.id/) December 2019 Indonesia-based Apple product reseller\n\n\n[discountmugs.com](http://discountmugs.com/) September\n2018\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nUS-based custom promotional product store\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Keeper Magecart group has been active for three years, over which time it has\ncontinually improved its technical sophistication and the scale of its operations. It has\nverifiably compromised hundreds of domains and likely extracted payment card information\nfrom many more that have yet to be uncovered. With revenue likely exceeding $7 million and\nincreased cybercriminal interest in CNP data during the COVID-19 quarantine measures\nacross the world, this group’s market niche appears to be secure and profitable. Based on\nthis pattern of successful Magecart attacks, Gemini assesses with high confidence that\nKeeper is likely to continue launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against online\nmerchants across the world.\n\n**Appendix A: List of 64 unique Keeper attacker domains.**\n\n[Appendix-ADownload](https://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Appendix-A-3.pdf)\n**Appendix B: List of 73 exfiltration domains that Keeper used to extract stolen payment card**\ndata.\n\n[Appendix-BDownload](https://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Appendix-B-1.pdf)\n**Appendix C: List of 570 compromised victim domains infected by Keeper.**\n\n[Appendix CDownload](https://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Appendix-C-2.pdf)\n\n**Gemini Advisory Mission Statement**\n\n_Gemini Advisory provides actionable fraud intelligence to the largest financial organizations_\n_in an effort to mitigate ever-growing cyber risks.
