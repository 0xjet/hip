Its code is reportedly used in thousands of\nApple and Google app store applications, and the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) and the US Army reportedly removed apps containing Pushwoosh code\ndue to security concerns. Cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs followed this news by\n[reporting that one of Pushwoosh’s developers is Yuri Shmakov, a Russian programmer who](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/u-s-govt-apps-bundled-russian-code-with-ties-to-mobile-malware-developer/)\nin 2013 admitted to writing the Pincer Android Trojan.\n\nPer the journalists at Reuters, Pushwoosh has presented itself as a US-based company\nbut, in the reporters’ words, “is headquartered in the Siberian town of Novosibirsk, where it\nis registered as a software company” and “is registered with the Russian government to pay\ntaxes in Russia.”\n\nSince the Reuters story, Margin Research, as part of its work on the Defense Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency (DARPA)’s [SocialCyber effort, has also been looking into](https://www.darpa.mil/program/hybrid-ai-to-protect-integrity-of-open-source-code)\nPushwoosh and its Russian connections. To do so, we ingested data from Pushwoosh’s\nGitHub, ran SocialCyber artificial intelligence (AI) analysis on the data, and supplemented\nthat automated analysis with manual analysis of the data and related open-source\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found that over time, many contributors to Pushwoosh s GitHub code base appear to be\nlocated in Russia, as well as Europe. Several individuals contributing to the Pushwoosh\nGitHub code base appear to use multiple email addresses. In at least one case, an\nindividual appears to have used an alias first name rather than his actual, full name to push\nGit code. And, despite Pushwoosh’s claims to the contrary, the vast majority of contributions\nto Pushwoosh’s GitHub code base since February 2022 appear to have come from Russian\ntime zones.\n\n## Mapping Contributors’ Time Zones\n\nWe started by ingesting the data from Pushwoosh’s 35 GitHub repositories—including\nvarious SDKs made by the company—and processing it using Margin Research’s\nSocialCyber capabilities. First, we found that most emails contributing to Pushwoosh’s\ncollection of GitHub repositories, over time, appear to be based in Russia (see below\nfigure). These time zones were identified based on the time zone from which each email\ncontributed the most.\n\n**Source: Margin Research analysis of Pushwoosh GitHub repository data.**\nSpecifically, 38 emails contributing to Pushwoosh’s GitHub appear to be located in the\nUTC+07:00 time zone, which encompasses Krasnoyarsk, Russia as well as Mongolia,\nCambodia, and Indonesia. 13 emails contributing appear to be located in the UTC+02:00\ntime zone, which encompasses Kaliningrad, Russia as well as Central Africa (from\nBotswana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Egypt, Libya, and South Africa).\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd 8 emails contributing appear to be based in the UTC+01:00 time zone, which spans\nCentral Europe—including Albania, Belgium, France, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Italy,\nHungary, and Germany. A few other contributions were made from additional time zones,\nincluding from the UTC-02:00 time zone, covering Brazil and South Georgia and the South\nSandwich Islands; the UTC-03:00 time zone, covering Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Suriname,\nand Uruguay, among others; and the UTC-08:00 time zone, covering parts of Canada,\nMexico, and the United States.\n\nNotably, a few of the contributors appeared to have multiple email addresses that\ncontributed from multiple time zones. For example, several individuals appeared to\ncontribute from multiple places in Russia, and one contributor appeared to contribute from\nboth UTC+01:00 (covering Central Europe) and UTC+02:00 (covering Kaliningrad, Russia\nas well as Central Africa).\n\nIt is also worth noting that some contributors did not appear to use their real name when\ncontributing to the code base; in line with Krebs’ reporting, for instance, we also identified\none “Michael Shmakov” to actually be Yuri Shmakov, a Russian developer at the company\nArello Mobile who has previously developed malware. Other individual contributors\nappeared to use multiple email addresses. This analysis refers to the time zones associated\nwith the email addresses contributing to the Pushwoosh GitHub repositories, though\nmethodologically, a different visualization could be produced that focuses on contributors as\nindividuals (e.g., clustering emails together if seemingly used by the same person).\n\nWe were able to produce this same time zone analysis on specific repositories within\nPushwoosh’s overall GitHub code base. As demonstrative examples, the below two graphs\ncapture this email contributor time zone analysis for Pushwoosh’s android-sdk repository\nand its ios-sdk repository. Both analyses indicate that, over time, most email addresses\ncontributing to the android-sdk and ios-sdk appear to contribute code from Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Source: Margin Research analysis of Pushwoosh GitHub repository data.**\n\n**Source: Margin Research analysis of Pushwoosh GitHub repository data.**\nThis kind of deeper dive into specific GitHub repositories could be carried out for any of the\nother Pushwoosh repositories of interest.\n\n## Assessing Apparent Post-February Contributions from Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nWe additionally found evidence refuting one of the central claims made by Pushwoosh in\nresponse to the Reuters investigation.\n\n[Pushwoosh published a blog post on November 15 stating that “Pushwoosh Inc. used to](https://blog.pushwoosh.com/blog/statement-on-the-reuters-story-regarding-pushwoosh/)\noutsource development parts of the product to the Russian company in Novosibirsk,\nmentioned in the article. However, in February 2022, Pushwoosh Inc. terminated the\ncontract.” The company’s blog post added: “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Pushwoosh\nhas been operating globally. Our dedicated engineering and support teams are currently\nlocated all over the globe, including Thailand, Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Serbia,\nGeorgia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Israel, and more.”\n\n**Based on Margin Research’s analysis, this claim about terminating outsourcing to**\n**Russia is not true. Since February 2022, several individuals who appear to be contributing**\nfrom Russia have committed code to Pushwoosh’s GitHub code base. There have been\n344 commits to Pushwoosh’s GitHub repositories since February 2022, and 338 (roughly\n98%) of those commits appear to fall within the UTC+02:00 to UTC+12:00 time zones,\nwhich cover the entire range of time zones in Russia. Overall, most of the 334 commits\nsince February 2022 have come from the UTC+07:00 time zone (see below graph).\n\n**Source: Margin Research analysis of Pushwoosh GitHub repository data.**\nSpecifically, 204 commits appear to have come from the UTC+07:00 time zone. 78 commits\nappeared to come from the UTC+04:00 time zone. And 44 commits appeared to come from\nthe UTC+02:00 time zone, 12 appeared to come from the UTC+03:00 time zone, and 6\nappeared to come from the UTC+01:00 time zone.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, one contributor has made multiple commits to one of Pushwoosh s GitHub\nrepositories since February 2022—with an email address that appears to be contributing\nfrom UTC+03:00, which covers Moscow, Russia. Another contributor has made numerous\ncommits to one of Pushwoosh’s SDKs since February 2022 and uses email addresses\nassociated with UTC+07:00 (which includes the Krasnoyarsk, Russia area).\n\nThe commits cover a wide range of updates to the GitHub repositories for Pushwoosh.\nBased on the messages uploaded alongside these 344 commits, some code pushes were\nupdates of README files or application displays; others yet updated the permissions\nassociated with a repository’s code or fixed compilation issues within the code.\n\nThis information appears to contradict the claim made by Pushwoosh about its use of\nRussian developers to build code since February.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis underscores the importance of leveraging openly available data to assess the\nopen-source code ecosystem—as well as in assessing potential misrepresentations of a\ncode base’s origins.\n\nThe fact that Russian developers are contributing to an open-source software ecosystem\ndoes not immediately mean anything nefarious is underway. Russian developers have built\nsoftware products or contributed to software products used in many parts of the world with\nno Russian government involvement. In this particular case, though, it is worth\ncontextualizing the heavy Russian code contributions to Pushwoosh alongside (a) Reuters’\nreporting that Pushwoosh misrepresented itself as a US company and (b) Pushwoosh’s\nclaim that it terminated its contract with what it calls a Russian outsourcer in February 2022.\n\nGoing forward, this kind of analysis—and the capabilities that underpinned it—may prove\nhighly useful to cybersecurity and national security professionals looking to understand\nopen-source code and identify situations within the broader landscape that may create\nsecurity risks.\n\n\n-----",
