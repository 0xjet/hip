The NoMercy stealer developer is also rapidly adding new capabilities.\n\nThe stealer is very primitive, and our observations indicate that it is at the initial stages of development.\nThe NoMercy stealer initially checks for the system’s public IP using hxxp://api.ipify[.]org.\n\nAfter getting the public IP, the stealer registers itself with the Command-and-Control server (C&C). After\nregistration, the stealer sends various system information to the C&C server.\n\nThe stealer then proceeds to continuously send screenshots, keystrokes, webcam photos, and device\naudio to the C&C server. The figure below shows the Telegram post made by the NoMercy developer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – NoMercy Stealer Telegram Post\nThe Threat Actors (TAs) behind this group are actively working on enhancing the capabilities of the stealer.\nDuring the course of our analysis, we noticed that the TAs had added new features to this stealer, including\nclipper and VPN client-stealer capabilities.\n\nThe TAs behind NoMercy are selling this new version of the stealer for 20$. The figure shows the post for\nNoMercy stealer version v1.1.0.\n\nFigure 2 –\n\nNoMercy Stealer v1.1.0 Telegram Post\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sha-256 of the information stealer is\n_9ecc76d4cda47a93681ddbb67b642c2e1f303ab834160ab94b79b47381e23a65._\n\nThis stealer is a 32-bit, console-based C# executable file. The file is a debug version of this stealer project.\nFigure 3 shows the basic file information.\n\nFigure 3 – Static File Information\nThe NoMercy stealer has a hardcoded configuration embedded into the source code. The configuration\ncontains the details such as C&C URL, file name for establishing persistence, version information, etc. The\nfigure below shows the configuration details.\n\nFigure\n\n4 – Hardcoded Stealer Configuration\nAfter initial execution, the information stealer copies itself into the start-up folder of the user’s machine.\nThis results in the execution of the stealer at the time of the system restart.\n\nThe figure below shows the malicious file in the start-up folder named “WindowsKernalDrivers.exe.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Information Stealer Executable in Start-up folder\nAfter establishing persistence, the stealer generates a unique UID using system artifacts such as the\nvictim’s public IP and account name. The stealer gets the public IP of the victim from hxxp://api.ipify[.]org\nand appends the account name generated using the whoami command. The figure below shows the\nmethod GenerateUID() used to get the UID.\n\nFigure 6 – Function to Generate UID of the Victim System\nAfter generating UID, the stealer registers itself to the C&C server using the UID and stealer’s version\ninformation. The stealer then uses the format for its C&C communications using the method PostUID(). The\nTA thus gains information about the victim’s public IP, user account, and stealer version in the below\nformat:\n\n_hxxp://six-clowns-sing-103-119-240-166.loca[.]lt/a?uid=[public IP]@[Current Username]&version=NoMercy-_\n_v1.0_\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Function to Register Victim to C&C\nAfter sending the victim data to the C&C server, the stealer collects various system information data points\nfrom the victim using cmd.exe. The information is extracted using various commands such as whoami, arp,\n_ipconfig, etc. The figure below shows all these commands being used by the stealer._\n\nFigure 8 – System Information Collected using cmd.exe\nAfter getting the internal system information, the stealer queries and extracts additional system information\nfrom the infected system such as public IP, hardware ID, main memory, GPU, MAC address, private IP, OS\nversion, details of any antivirus software installed, keyboard language, clipboard, running processes and\nCPU information.\n\nThe figure below shows the code used by the malware to collect additional system information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Other System Information Extracted by the NoMercy Stealer\nAfter collecting the information, the stealer encodes the stolen data to a base64 string and sends the\ninformation to the C&C server.The stealer calls the PostCLIInfoCNC() and PostOtherInfoCNC() methodsfor\nsending the information to its C&C server, as shown below.\n\nFigure 10 – Methods to Send Data to C&C Server\nAfter sending all the victim’s information to its C&C server, the malware runs three separate threads for\ndifferent operations, which are:\n\n1. Send screenshots\n2. Send microphone audio\n3. Send webcam snapshots\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 – NoMercy Stealer Execution\nThe malicious URL resolves to the IP address 193.34.76[.]44, which is highly active and hosts multiple\nmalicious files. We have observed strains of various information stealers connecting to this IP.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe NoMercy stealer is a very crude and simple information stealer in its initial stages. The TAs behind this\nstealer are actively modifying the stealer and adding additional capabilities.\n\nThe active infections are not very high in volume but are a good indicator of the trends of the TAs involved.\nOne such emerging trend is adding clipper capabilities to the malware. Cyble Research Labs continuously\nmonitors all new and existing malware to keep our readers aware and informed.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Technique** **Technique ID** **Description**\n\n**Execution** [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) User Execution\n\n**Persistence** [T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/) Boot or Logon AutoStart Execution\n\n\n**Discovery** [T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/)\n\n[T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/)\n\n[T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n\n[T1518](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/)\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/)\n\n[T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/)\n\n**Collection** [T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\n\n[T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115/)\n\n[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/)\n\n[T1113](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/)\n\n[T1125](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1125/)\n\n\nAccount Discovery\n\nNetwork Service Discovery\n\nQuery Registry\n\nSoftware Discovery\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\nSystem Network Configuration\n\nDiscovery System Owner/User Discovery\n\nAutomated Collection\n\nClipboard Data\n\nInput Capture\n\nScreen Capture\n\nVideo Capture\n\n\n**Command and Control** [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Application Layer Protocol\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**a101aebd7e97dba97311cde683a64a32**\n\n**e010b078904516eeb6c471904d4adc190c6f53fe**\n**9ecc76d4cda47a93681ddbb67b642c2e1f303ab834160ab94b79b47381e23a65**\n\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA-256\n\n\n**Description**\n\nNoMercy\nStealer\n\n\n**hxxp://six-clowns-sing-103-119-240-166.loca[.]lt/** URL Command\nand Control\n\n**193.34.76[.]44** IP Command\nand Control\n\n\n-----",
