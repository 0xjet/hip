    "plain_text": "# EAST Publishes European Fraud Update 2-2018\n\n**[association-secure-transactions.eu/east-publishes-fraud-update-2-2018/](https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/east-publishes-fraud-update-2-2018/)**\n\nEAST has published its second European Fraud\nUpdate for 2018. This is based on country crime\nupdates given by representatives of 18 countries in the\nSingle Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and 3 non-SEPA\ncountries, at the 45 EAST meeting held in The Hagueth\non 6 June 2018.th\n\n\n05/07/2018\n\n\nPayment fraud issues were reported by fifteen\ncountries. Seven countries reported card-not-present\n(CNP) as a key fraud driver. Two countries reported\nattempted ‘Forced Post’ fraud, possible when some\npoint of sale (POS) terminals allow the ‘force sale’\nfunctionality. One country reported a new form of\nmalware on android mobile phones, distributed with a\nfake application uploaded from third-party android\nstores. Another country reported cases of SIM swap\nfraud, where fraudsters authorise a bank transfer by\nswitching the customer’s mobile phone number over to a new SIM and intercept the\nauthorisation message. To date in 2018 the EAST Payments Task Force (EPTF) has\npublished five Payment Alerts covering phishing, malware on mobile phones, fraudulent\nmobile Apps and CNP fraud.\n\nATM malware and logical security attacks were reported by nine countries. Five of the\ncountries reported ATM related malware. In addition to Cutlet Maker (used for ATM cashout) a new variant called WinPot has been reported – this is used to check how many\nbanknotes are in an ATM. Six countries reported the usage (or attempted usage) of ‘blackbox’ devices to allow the unauthorised dispensing of cash. To date in 2018 the EAST Expert\nGroup on All Terminal Fraud (EGAF) has published seven related Fraud Alerts. To help\ncounter these threats Europol supported by EAST EGAF has published a document entitled\n\n\n-----\n\nGuidance and Recommendations regarding Logical attacks on ATMs . It covers mitigating\nthe risk, setting up lines of defence and identifying and responding to logical attacks. This is\navailable in four languages: English, German, Italian and Spanish.\n\nCard skimming at ATMs was reported by fourteen countries. For the first time one country\nreported the arrest of a Chinese national in connection with such attacks. The usage of M3 –\nCard Reader Internal Skimming devices remains most prevalent. This type of device is\nplaced at various locations inside the motorised card reader behind the shutter. Six\ncountries reported such attacks. One country reported the use of M2 – Throat Inlay\nSkimming Devices. Skimming attacks on other terminal types were reported by five\ncountries, four of which reported such attacks on unattended payment terminals (UPTs) at\npetrol stations. To date in 2018 EAST EGAF has published ten related Fraud Alerts.\n\nYear to date International skimming related losses were reported in 31 countries and\nterritories outside SEPA and in 3 within SEPA. The top three locations where such losses\nwere reported remain Indonesia, the USA and India.\n\n[Three countries reported incidents of Transaction Reversal Fraud (TRF), two of which](https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/industry-information/atm-crime-definitions/)\nreported new attack variants. To date in 2018 EAST EGAF has published four related Fraud\nAlerts.\n\nRam raids and ATM burglary were reported by eight countries. Six countries reported\nexplosive gas attacks, one of which reported such attacks against ATS machines for the first\ntime. Another reported that explosive gas attacks against ATMs have started for the first\ntime. Five countries reported solid explosive attacks. The spread of such attacks is of great\nconcern to the industry due to the risk to life and to the significant amount of collateral\ndamage to equipment and buildings. To date in 2018 the EAST Expert Group on ATM & ATS\nPhysical Attacks (EGAP) has published five related Physical Attack Alerts.\n\n[The full Fraud Update is available to EAST Members (National and Associate).](https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/east-membership/)\n\n\n-----",
