To date, this group has claimed attribution of 29 different victims across multiple industries using a double extortion\nstrategy where the attackers not only execute ransomware but also steal data and threaten to release it publicly if the\n\n\n-----\n\nransom demands are not met. The data disclosure element of these attacks takes place on a data leak site available on\nthe [Tor network. As a mechanism to apply pressure to coerce the victim to pay the ransom, the operators of Black Basta](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/onion-router)\nwill gradually release stolen data on the leak site.\n\nThe Black Basta group is still in the early stages of their organization and X-Force has not observed any attempts to\nadvertise the malware or hire affiliates on underground forums. Due to operational similarities and the absence of\n[affiliation attempts, it has been reported that Black Basta may potentially be a rebranded version of the Conti gang, a](https://www.securityweek.com/new-black-basta-ransomware-possibly-linked-conti-group)\nwell-known ransomware group that already has affiliates. However, the Conti group announced on May 12 that they had\nno affiliations with the Black Basta ransomware group. X-Force’s assessment of the possible relationship between these\ngroups is ongoing.\n\nThe Black Basta ransomware variant acts at such a high speed that it rarely causes symptoms that would tip off\ndefenders to the compromise before the ransomware has been deployed.\n\nThis blog post will detail X-Force’s insights into the Black Basta ransomware, technical analysis of the sample, and\nindicators of compromise (IoC) to help organizations protect themselves from this malware.\n\n## X-Force Assessment\n\nBlack Basta’s sudden appearance and subsequent high volume of successful compromises highlights the speed with\nwhich ostensibly “new” ransomware groups are able to become central figures in the threat landscape. While this group\nhas yet to be linked by X-Force to existing or past ransomware operations, the impact that this group has had in such a\nshort amount of time points to a practiced and effective set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that pose a\nsignificant threat to enterprise networks. Based on current intelligence, it does not appear that Black Basta targets\nspecific industries or verticals. However, entities that collect large amounts of data that is attractive for extortion\noperations such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial information, or other sensitive data, are likely to\nstand out as lucrative targets for attackers.\n\n[We encourage security practitioners to review the IBM X-Force Definitive Guide to Ransomware and the mitigations](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/EV6NAQR4)\nhighlighted below, action available IOCs, and ensure that detections are in place to alert on observed malicious\nbehaviors.\n\nAdditional Risk Mitigations:\n\nEstablish and maintain backup routines, including offline backups. Ensure you have backup redundancy stored\nseparately from network zones attackers could access with read-only access. The availability of effective backups\nis a significant differentiator for organizations and can support recovery from a ransomware attack.\nImplement a strategy to prevent unauthorized data theft, especially as it applies to uploading large amounts of data\nto legitimate cloud storage platforms that attackers can abuse.\nEmploy user behavior analytics to identify potential security incidents. When triggered, assume a breach has taken\nplace. Audit, monitor and quickly act on suspected abuse related to privileged accounts and groups.\nEmploy multifactor authentication on all remote access points into an enterprise network — with particular care\ngiven to secure or disable remote desktop protocol (RDP) access. Multiple ransomware attacks have been known\nto exploit weak RDP access to gain initial entry into a network.\n\n[Download the Definitive Guide to Ransomware](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/EV6NAQR4)\n\n## Ransomware Analysis Details\n\n### Behavioral Analysis\n\nBehavioral analysis describes the malware behavior observed on a system during execution. Behavioral analysis\ntypically includes actions performed on the system such as files dropped, persistence, details surrounding process\nexecution and any C2 communications. It should be noted that behavioral analysis may not capture all notable malware\nbehavior as certain functions may only be performed by the malware under specific conditions.\n\n**Loader**\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution, the loader base64 decodes a Black Basta payload using the CryptStringToBinaryA() API function. The\ndecoded payload is then RC4 decrypted using the key “1xJr13puJChWqiMeOnFDDSOmoSmws5n“. Black Basta is then\ninjected into a process instance of the loader and executed in memory. The injected Black Basta sample has a SHA256\nhash: ef1382770f820e4b2e65981bb7b3a62d5f93e3b87763f83012ef7f7cb1bc9469 and compile time: Thursday,\n**28.04.2022 15:15:43 UTC.**\n\n**Black Basta**\n\nUpon execution, Black Basta conducts the following activity:\n\nDeletes volume shadow copies using the commands:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\SysNative\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\n\n```\nChanges the desktop background to the following image using the file %Temp%\\dlaksjdoiwq.jpg.\n\nModifies the following registry key to set the desktop background.\n\n```\nHKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper = %Temp%\\dlaksjdoiwq.jpg\n\n```\n\nDrops the ICON file %Temp%\\fkdjsadasd.ico to the system. This file is used as the default icon for encrypted\nfiles. To set the default icon, the ransomware creates the following registry key.\n\n```\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.basta\\DefaultIcon = %Temp%\\fkdjsadasd.ico\n\n```\n\nDrops the ransom note readme.txt in directories where it encrypts files. The company id and ransom note is\nhardcoded in the sample. Example id: 18a6cdad-316c-4922-953e-c64bf4959a74.\n```\nYour data are stolen and encrypted\nThe data will be published on TOR website if you do not pay the ransom\nYou can contact us and decrypt one file for free on this TOR site\n(you should download and install TOR browser first https://torproject.org)\nhxxps[:]//aazsbsgya565vlu2c6bzy6yfiebkcbtvvcytvolt33s77xypi7nypxyd[.]onion/\n\n```\n```\nYour company id for log in: <varying id per sample in GUID format>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAppends the file extension .basta to encrypted files.\n\nDepending on the variant, Black Basta conducts the following activity:\n\nHijacks the existing Fax service to maintain persistence.\nDisables windows recovery and repair with the command:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\SysNative\\bcdedit.exe /deletevalue safeboot\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\bcdedit.exe /deletevalue safeboot\n\n```\nReboots the system into safe mode using bcdedit and the shutdown command.\n```\nC:\\Windows\\SysNative\\bcdedit.exe /set safeboot network\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\bcdedit.exe /set safeboot network\ncmd.exe /C shutdown -r -f -t 0\n\n```\nThe following files and folders are skipped during encryption:\n```\n$Recycle.Bin\nWindows\nboot\nreadme.txt\ndlaksjdoiwq.jpg\nNTUSER.DAT\nfkdjsadasd.ico\nOUT.txt\n\n### Static Analysis\n\n```\nStatic analysis is a deeper dive into the technical analysis of the malware. Static analysis typically includes further details\nabout the functionality, obfuscation or packing in the sample, encryption used by the malware, configuration information\nor other notable technical detail.\n\n**Loader**\n\nThe injection process for the loader is as follows:\n\n1. The loader creates a suspended process instance of itself with CreateProcessA().\n2. Then it calls GetThreadContext() to get the thread context of the suspended process.\n3. Next, it calls ReadProcessMemory() to obtain the suspended process’ image base from the Process Environment\n\nBlock retrieved via the thread context.\n4. The loader proceeds to allocate memory in the suspended process using VirtualAllocEx() and writes the payload to\n\nthe buffer using WriteProcessMemory().\n5. Finally, it sets the entry point of the injected payload using SetThreadContext() and executes the injected payload\n\nusing ResumeThread().\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, samples similar to loader were found in VirusTotal with the following project paths. The payloads of these\nsamples have not yet been determined.\n```\nc4fa34414fb1c199e13d7cd7def0e8f401c9649657a39224bc32310c9fd9d725,\nC:\\BHProject\\Treasurer\\SharpDepositorCrypter\\PELoaderNative\\PELoaderNative\\Release\\PELoaderNative.pdb\nf132ffc8648d38833244e612c58224285e85e863a35c872490690217c082e59c,\nC:\\BHProject\\Treasurer\\SharpDepositorCrypter\\PELoaderNative\\PELoaderNative\\Release\\PELoaderNative.pdb\n\n```\nThe following samples were compiled under a similar project path but are coded differently.\n```\n19c2710e498d55f2e3a3d4126064e960058e32c99dc35944b3fc09aa0eec4754,\nC:\\BHProject\\Treasurer\\SharpDepositorCrypter\\PELoader\\PELoader\\Release\\PELoader.pdb\nc5fcd0643823082941bc827613baf0fa574ffd9cb03a8b265d62d657367b2ea2,\nC:\\BHProject\\Treasurer\\SharpDepositorCrypter\\PELoader\\PELoader\\Release\\PELoader.pdb\ndaa049b15bb5c1d0aef06276f9940d2fea76242f1a01ebfe299a63b7c74f7ea0,\nC:\\BHProject\\Treasurer\\SharpDepositorCrypter\\PELoader\\PELoader\\Release\\PELoader.pdb\n\n## Black Basta\n\n### Encryption\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nTo start encrypting files, Black Basta calls the FindFirstVolumeW() and FindNextVolumeW() functions to enumerate\nvolumes on the victim system. For each volume, the ransomware calls GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameW() to\nobtain a list of drive letters and mounted folder paths for the specified volume. Analysis indicates that Black Basta uses\n_ChaCha20 encryption during the encryption process. Notably, it is observed that some files are not fully encrypted,_\npossibly in an effort to hasten the encryption process. Black Basta encrypts some files in 64-byte blocks every 128 bytes\nas shown in the example encrypted notepad.exe file below.\n\n### Compile Times\n\nThe samples’ compile times range from February 2022 to Apr 2022. The earlier samples in February contain a ransom\nnote indicating the malware name is “no_name_software“.\n\n**Sample** **Compile Time**\n\n17205c43189c22dfcb278f5cc45c2562f622b0b6280dcd43cc1d3c274095eb90 Thursday, 17.02.2022 00:46:11 UTC\n\n5b6c3d277711d9f847be59b16fd08390fc07d3b27c7c6804e2170f456e9f1173 Thursday, 17.02.2022 00:46:11 UTC\n\n7883f01096db9bcf090c2317749b6873036c27ba92451b212b8645770e1f0b8a Saturday, 16.04.2022 06:29:58 UTC\n\nae7c868713e1d02b4db60128c651eb1e3f6a33c02544cc4cb57c3aa6c6581b6e Saturday, 16.04.2022 06:29:58 UTC\n\nb3661c6fecf46e6a7b96b3debc7efa65633bfde2f156392ff6506736457361be Friday, 22.04.2022 14:41:00 UTC\n\n5d2204f3a20e163120f52a2e3595db19890050b2faa96c6cba6b094b0a52b0aa Friday, 22.04.2022 20:31:36 UTC\n\nSample Ransom Note from versions compiled in February:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nAll of your files are currently encrypted by no_name_software.\nThese files cannot be recovered by any means without contacting our team directly.\nDON'T TRY TO RECOVER your data by yourselves.
