What we know about this nation state cybercrime group\n\n\n[In a July 2020 report, the UK and its allies publicly blamed cyber-attacks on organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development on](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/coronavirus)\nAPT29, a hacking group linked to Russian intelligence agencies.\n\n[The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of GCHQ, blamed APT29 for an ongoing campaign of malicious activity “predominantly](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/declassified-gchq-celebrates-100-years-of-secrets-well-kept)\nagainst government, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property”.\n\n[Known targets of APT29 include UK, US and Canadian vaccine research and development organizations, according to a joint alert by NCSC](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk)\nand its intelligence partners in the Canadian Communication Security Establishment and the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\n\n-----\n\n[u assess](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development-V1-1.pdf) e t ( ) o e s ad ce to pote t a y ta geted o ga at o s, as e as g a s ot aga st t e bo o uss a te ge ce by\npublicly calling the Kremlin out for what the NCSC’s director of operations, Paul Chichester, described as “despicable attacks against those\ndoing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic”.\n\nBut what do we know about this threat group? The Daily Swig takes a deeper look.\n\n## What is APT29?\n\nAPT29 is a hacking group that western intelligence agencies and various cybersecurity firms have linked to Russian state intelligence\nagencies.\n\n[Hacked security camera footage allowed the Dutch intelligence service AIVD to link APT29 to the Russian Foreign intelligence service (SVR).](https://www.volkskrant.nl/media/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~a4561913/)\n\n[Security intelligence firm CrowdStrike attributed APT29 to either the SVR or Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-cozy-bear/)\n\n[‘APT’ in this instance stands for ‘advanced persistent threat’ – security industry shorthand for a state-sponsored threat group.](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cyber-warfare)\n\nAPT29 has been given various nicknames by cybersecurity firms, including Cozy Bear, CozyDuke, and the Dukes, among others.\n\n## What cyber-attacks have been associated with APT29?\n\nAs well as espionage around Covid-19 vaccine data, APT29 has been blamed for a number of other high-profile attacks over the last five\nyears, according to analysis from FireEye Mandiant.\n\nThese alleged incidents include:\n\nAttack on the Pentagon in 2015\nAttack on the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016\nAttack on Dutch government ministries in 2017\n[Assault on Covid-19 vaccine development labs (2020)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-allies-expose-russian-attacks-on-coronavirus-vaccine-development)\n[Running a supply chain attack that](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/supply-chain-attacks) [planted a trojan in updates to SolarWinds Orion enterprise software in a wide-ranging assault](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/solarwinds-hack-nation-state-attackers-could-have-launched-supply-chain-attack-nine-months-earlier-than-previously-thought)\nultimately affecting 18,000 organizations but chiefly aimed at US federal government agencies (2020)\nBreaching systems of the Republican National Committee (2021)\n\n[According to Symantec, APT29 has been attacking diplomatic organizations and governments since at least 2010, if not earlier.](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory)\n\nAPT29 Cozy Bear was implicated alongside another Kremlin-linked hacker group, Fancy Bear (APT28, widely credited as a unit of the Russian\n[military intelligence directorate, GRU), in the cyber-attacks against the DNC during 2016 US presidential election.](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cyber-attacks)\n\nThe threat group is known to be interested in foreign intelligence, according to Finnish security firm F-Secure.\n\n“APT29 has traditionally focused on intelligence to inform national and security policy, rather than the theft of intellectual property,” Calvin Gan,\nmanager at F-Secure’s tactical defense unit, told The Daily Swig.\n\n[“However, Covid-19 could be such a major national security priority for Russia that they need all hands on deck.”](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/russia)\n\n## How is the workload split between APT29 and other groups?\n\nThe tradecraft of APT29 is generally credited as more subtle and sophisticated than that of APT28, the even more infamous Kremlin-linked\n[cybercrime group.](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cybercrime)\n\nBen Read, senior manager of analysis at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, told The Daily Swig: “APT29 has historically targeted geopolitical\nintelligence, with a focus on stealing information.\n\n“They have not been linked to the type of disruptive operations that APT28 and Sandworm team have undertaken but have instead operated\nwith much more discretion.”\n\n## What are the tactics, techniques, and procedures of APT29?\n\n[APT29 uses a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) including spear-phishing and custom malware known as ‘WellMess’ and](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/a-guide-to-spear-phishing-how-to-protect-against-targeted-attacks)\n‘WellMail’.\n\nAccording to Mandiant, APT29 is an adaptive and disciplined threat group that hides its activity on a victim’s [network.](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/network-security)\n\n“In the past it has communicated infrequently and in a way that closely resembles legitimate traffic,” Mandiant explains.\n\n“By using legitimate popular web services, the group has taken advantage of encrypted SSL connections, making detection even more\ndifficult.”\n\nAPT29 is one of the “most evolved and capable threat groups”, according to Mandiant’s analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt deploys new backdoors to fix its own bugs and add features. It monitors network defender activity to maintain control over systems. APT29\nhas also often used compromised servers for [command and control] communication.\n\nIt counters attempts to remediate attacks. It also maintains a fast development cycle for its malware, quickly altering tools to hinder detection.\nAPT29 has been known to switch tactics and approaches (notably between ‘smash-and-grab’ and ‘slow-and-deliberate’) depending on the\n[perceived intelligence value and/or infection method of victims, according to an ATT&CK Evaluations assessment by Mitre Corporation.](https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/)\n\nAPT29 is known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, according to F-Secure:\n\nThe Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients\nassociated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations.\n\nThese campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as\nmuch data as possible.\n\nIf the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics\nfocused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering.\n[More details on APT29’s alleged tactics can be found in a recent white paper on APT29 by F-Secure (PDF).](https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18122307/F-Secure_Dukes_Whitepaper.pdf)\n\n## Is it possible to defend against APT29?\n\nPatch management and other techniques can help to defend against APT29 and similar attackers.\n\n“APT groups typically update their arsenal fairly quickly and are customized to the target or environment that they are interested in,” F-Secure’s\nGan explained.\n\n“While EDR [endpoint detection and response] is around to spot for suspicious behaviors within the network, it is only one part of the defense\nstrategy.\n\n“There are other processes and technologies that must be in place to minimize loopholes as much as possible. This includes patch\n[management, as we have seen in the recent advisory of how APT29 purportedly gained a foothold through known vulnerabilities.”](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities)\n\nTony Cole, CTO at Attivo Networks, added: “It’s unfortunate that an actor such as APT29 with such sophisticated capabilities is still able to\nsimply scan targets for existing known vulnerabilities and then compromise with little effort or use phishing emails to obtain their initial set of\ncredentials.\n\n“Organizations must step up their efforts to counter adversaries targeting them.”\n\n[Read more of the latest cyber-attack news](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cyber-attacks)\n\nCole continued: “Patching is an imperative that must be met. Instrumentation focused on detection and lateral movement inside the network\nperimeter and across all endpoints is another imperative since prevention often fails regardless of defensive spending.”\n\nCharity Wright, a cyber threat intelligence advisor at IntSights and former NSA Chinese espionage expert, told The Daily Swig: “The Russian\nintelligence services are organized and deliberate about their targeting, missions, and toolsets. They adapt and overcome target defenses and\ntypically go after strategic intelligence, military, and government entities.”\n\nShe advised: “Organizations should understand what valuable data they have, which state-sponsored groups would be likely to target them\neither for their proprietary data or to use them as a third party to pivot to their target, and be prepared to defend against those APTs.\n\n“Utilizing a threat intelligence service, creating intelligence requirements, and integrating tactical intelligence into their defense strategy is vital\nto protecting their assets. I would also encourage them to conduct threat modeling and purple team exercises to prepare for increases in\nattacks from nation-state cyber threats.”\n\n## How does Russia respond to the cybercrime accusations?\n\nRussia’s basic stance is to acknowledge that cyber-attacks are happening but to deny any responsibility.\n\nIn July 2020, Russia’s Ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, gave an interview with Deborah Haynes, foreign affairs editor at Sky News,\nclaiming that Russia itself was frequently targeted by cyber-attacks and calling for the creation of a convention on cyber-warfare.\n\nREAD MORE [Russian national pleads guilty over involvement in $568m cybercrime operation](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/russian-national-pleads-guilty-over-involvement-in-568m-cybercrime-operation)\n\n\n-----\n\n“We would like to set up a normal order, under the UN auspices, probably a convention, which would provide for easily understandable rules of\ncooperation,” Kelin said. “Otherwise there will be a cyber chaos.”\n\nWhen pressed on accusations that Russia’s cyber activities pose threat to the UK, Kelin raised doubts about attribution.\n\n“The cyber world is extremely complicated, but attribution of cyber-attacks to the government of any country is very dubious,” he said.\n\n[During the interview, Kelin went on to dismiss the latest, very specific accusation that Russian intelligence agencies as being behind cyber-](https://www.rusemb.org.uk/ambarticles/564)\nattacks against vaccine research centers. “Those accusations are about nothing,” he said.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE [Declassified: GCHQ celebrates 100 years of secrets well kept](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/declassified-gchq-celebrates-100-years-of-secrets-well-kept)\n\nJohn\nLeyden\n\n\nJohn Leyden\n\n[@jleyden](https://twitter.com/jleyden)\n\n\n-----",
