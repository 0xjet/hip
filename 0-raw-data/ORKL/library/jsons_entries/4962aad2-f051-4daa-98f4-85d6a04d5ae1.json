    "plain_text": "# Seedworm: Group Compromises Government Agencies, Oil & Gas, NGOs, Telecoms, and IT Firms\n\n**[symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/seedworm-espionage-group](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/seedworm-espionage-group)**\n\nSymantec researchers have uncovered extensive insights into a cyber espionage group\nbehind a recent series of cyber attacks designed to gather intelligence on targets spread\nprimarily across the Middle East as well as in Europe and North America.\n\nThe group, which we call Seedworm (aka MuddyWater), has been operating since at least\n2017, with its most recent activity observed in December 2018.\n\nAnalysts in our [DeepSight Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) team have](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nfound a new backdoor, [Backdoor.Powemuddy, new variants of Seedworm’s Powermud](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-120306-2744-99)\nbackdoor (aka POWERSTATS), a GitHub repository used by the group to store their scripts,\nas well as several post-compromise tools the group uses to exploit victims once they have\nestablished a foothold in their network.\n\n## Tracking an Attack’s Footprints\n\n[In September 2018, we found evidence of Seedworm and the espionage group APT28 (aka](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/election-security/apt28-espionage-military-government)\nSwallowtail, Fancy Bear), on a computer within the Brazil-based embassy of an oil-producing\nnation. Seeing two active groups piqued our interest and, as we began pulling on that one\nstring, we found more clues that led us to uncover new information about Seedworm.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe not only found the initial entry point, but we were able to follow Seedworm s subsequent\nactivity after the initial infection due to the vast telemetry Symantec has access to via its\nGlobal Intelligence Network. Because of this unique visibility, our analysts were able to trace\nwhat actions Seedworm took after they got into a network. We found new variants of the\nPowermud backdoor, a new backdoor (Backdoor.Powemuddy), and custom tools for stealing\npasswords, creating reverse shells, privilege escalation, and the use of the native Windows\ncabinet creation tool, makecab.exe, probably for compressing stolen data to be uploaded.\n[DeepSight MATI customers can leverage these unique insights to combat emerging cyber](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nthreats.\n\nSeedworm’s motivations are much like many cyber espionage groups that we observe—they\nseek to acquire actionable information about the targeted organizations and individuals. They\naccomplish this with a preference for speed and agility over operational security, which\nultimately led to our identification of their key operational infrastructure.\n\n## Tactics and Tools\n\nSeedworm likely functions as a cyber espionage group to secure actionable intelligence that\ncould benefit their sponsor’s interests. During the operations, the group used tools consistent\nwith those leveraged during past intrusions including Powermud, a custom tool used by the\nSeedworm group, and customized PowerShell, LaZagne, and Crackmapexec scripts.\n\nThe Seedworm group controls its Powermud backdoor from behind a proxy network to hide\nthe ultimate command-and-control (C&C) location. The Seedworm group is the only group\nknown to use the Powermud backdoor.\n\nAfter compromising a system, typically by installing Powermud or Powemuddy, Seedworm\nfirst runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users’ web browsers and email,\ndemonstrating that access to the victim's email, social media, and chat accounts is one of\ntheir likely goals. Seedworm then uses open-source tools such as LaZagne and\nCrackmapexec to obtain Windows authorization credentials. Seedworm uses off-the-shelf,\nunmodified versions of these tools as well as custom-compiled variants which we have\ndetermined are only used by this group.\n\n## Shifting Tactics\n\nSince its existence first came to light, we’ve seen Seedworm modify the way it operates.\nSince early 2017, they have continually updated their Powermud backdoor and other tools to\navoid detection and to thwart security researchers analyzing the tools. They’ve also used\nGitHub to store malware and a handful of publicly available tools, which they then customize\nto carry out their work.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have identified multiple online accounts that are likely associated with actors behind the\nSeedworm operations. The first finding was a public Github repository containing scripts that\nvery closely match those observed in Seedworm operations. An additional link was then\nmade to a persona on Twitter with similar profile data. This Twitter account follows numerous\nsecurity researchers, including those who have written about the group in the past as well as\ndevelopers who write the open-source tools they use.\n\nThese accounts are likely controlled by the Seedworm group. The Github repository contains\na PowerShell script that has been run on victim hosts in activity attributed to Seedworm;\nthere are also numerous Crackmapexec PowerShell commands that match victim host\nactivity.\n\nChoosing to rely on publicly available tools allows Seedworm to quickly update their\noperations by using code written by others and applying only small customizations. And they\nappear to adopt some of the most effective and capable tools, several of which—for these\nreasons—are also used by red team organizations.\n\n## Targets and Timeline\n\nWe analyzed data on 131 victims that were compromised by Seedworm’s Powermud\nbackdoor from late September to mid-November 2018.\n\n\n-----",
