To provide some context to this\nanalysis, we describe Conti’s evolution and success since its origin. We then contextualize\nthe leaks thanks to our observations on underground forums and analyze it in terms of threat\nintelligence. The second blog post will give some details on the techniques used by Conti\noperators and how to detect them.\n\n## The origin of Conti ransomware\n\nConti and Ryuk were developed and operated by a group dubbed Wizard Spider by\nCrowdStrike (aka UNC1878, Grim Spider, Conti gang) and some affiliates. Wizard Spider\nstarted its activity in 2016 by conducting financial fraud campaigns using the TrickBot\n[banking trojan¹. The link between Conti and Wizard Spider was confirmed by Clearsky,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/wizard-spider-adversary-update/)\n[following a bitcoin transaction after a successful ransomware attack².](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Conti-Ransomware.pdf)\n\nIn August 2018, the actor previously using TrickBot started to use a new ransomware called\nRyuk to target large organizations, asking for high ransom amounts. Wizard Spider seemed\n[to follow the Big Game Hunting (BGH) trend started by BitPaymer’s gang one year earlier³.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/)\nRyuk’s activity made the project famous in the ransomware business. According to\n\n\n-----\n\nCoveware, in Q1 2020, the average ransomware payment on behalf of the group was over\n$1.3 million. During this period, we can note the attacks against major US companies such\n[as Electronic Warfare Associates (EWA), a US Government contractor⁴.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ryuk-ransomware-infects-us-government-contractor)\n\n_[Average ransomware payment of Phobos, Ryuk & Sodinokibi in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020⁵](https://www.coveware.com/blog/q1-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report)_\n\nThe group has constantly evolved its arsenal, reacting to attempts to block them. In 2020,\nthey developed BazarLoader, which has a high level of obfuscation. They also regularly\nadded known vulnerabilities such as Eternal Blue, Zerologon, and more recently,\nPrintNightmare to their arsenal.\n\nTheir loaders were often delivered through phishing email or credentials previously obtained\nfrom Emotet or IcedID activity. The affiliates probably used accesses sold by initial access\nbrokers.\n\nConti appears in February 2020 as a Ryuk successor using the new data blackmailing\n[technique⁶ (aka double extortion technique). They created a website to publish stolen data in](https://www.areteir.com/is-conti-the-new-ryuk/)\ncase of non-payment of the ransom and to have a good-looking chat interface to\ncommunicate with victims and others. According to ransom notes SEKOIA studied, Ryuk\noperators used to communicate with victims through secure email services such as\nProtonmail or Tutanota.\n\n\n-----\n\nThreatening to leak sensitive files is great to increase the pressure on companies and\ntherefore increase the probability that the ransom will be paid and to increase its amount.\nNote that Wizard Spider seems to consider the file decryptor and the deletion of the stolen\nfiles as two different services.\n\n_Old Conti leak website_\n\n\n-----\n\n_New Conti leak website_\n\n_(continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad[.]onion)_\n\nThe double extortion technique used by Conti has apparently paid off: the group claims more\n[than 150 successful attacks and $20M of paid revenue by the end of 2020⁷. Based on our](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Conti-Ransomware.pdf)\nobservations, Conti is the most prolific group since January 2021, with more than 300\npublicly disclosed ransomware attacks this year.\n\nThis success is partly due to the efficiency of the group’s tools. Indeed, in 2020, the Conti\nransomware was one of the fastest to encrypt a computer by running 32 concurrent threads,\nusing AES-256 keys bundled with a RSA-4096 public key. The encryption and data\nexfiltration speed has since been a marketing argument in the ransomware community and\nwas greatly improved by other groups. One of the Conti ransomware specificities is that it\ncan be used in command line to encrypt the local hard drive or network shares.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Comparative table created by LockBit 2.0 group (available on their website)_\n\nAnother specificity that indicates a continuity between the activities of Ryuk and Conti is\nRyuk’s habit of demanding ransom payments proportional to the revenues of the targeted\ncompany that has continued with the Conti ransomware. Once their affiliates compromise\na target, they send the operators a report containing information about the victim (name,\nwebsite address, number of servers and endpoint locked, amount of stolen data, and target’s\nrevenue) to help during the ransom negotiation.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti s negotiators are experienced and patient. They use the anchor technique by setting a\nvery high first price and negotiating it. They use a service-oriented rhetoric, calling the victim\n“customer” and themself “support”.\n\nUnlike other ransomware gangs, Conti did not hold back from attacking the hospitals during\nthe COVID-19 crisis⁸.\n\n## An internal discord at the origin of the Conti’s training material leaks\n\nOn August 5, 2021, a XSS cybercrime forum member known as “m1Geelka” leaked a Conti\nransomware group’s training material. The “manual” includes some insights on the modus\noperandi of one of the most successful ransomware cartels at the moment.\n\nFrom our observations of the discussions between different actors, “m1Geelka” is believed to\n_be one of the Windows Administrators of the group. After allegedly working for Conti (or as_\n_he states, “I got in there to find out how they work”), “m1Geelka” judged the remuneration_\nformula to be unfair and decided to do justice to the group’s “partners”.\n\nIn fact, the cybercriminal community has repeatedly voiced that Conti’s alleged remuneration\nwas inadequate, given the qualifications they are looking for. Starting from $1,500 and from\n$2,000 for technical profiles, wages are, however, constantly being adjusted upwards, and\naccompanied by regular bonuses, all paid in BTC – the group states.\n\nEven so, “m1Geelka” was promptly expelled from the Russian-speaking underground\ncommunity. He has broken one unwritten rule that dictates the law in this medium: conflicts\nhave to be solved through private arbitration processes.\n\nThis has also driven us to pay close attention to the most recent activity of a Conti\nrepresentative on a forum where he was particularly active from June to August 2021.\n“IT_Work” is the online persona of a suspected threat actor who handled the group’s\nexpansion this summer.\n\n_The Conti’s representative profile on XSS forum, banned since August 6, 2021_\n\nAs commercial activities related to ransomware are now prohibited on this platform, no\nadvertisements for the used software, nor any specifications about the targeted countries or\nindustries were seen. Instead, we observed a massive recruitment campaign on the XSS\n\n\n-----\n\ncybercriminal forum which is highly popular among ransomware operators seeking to create\nnew partnerships.\n\n“We are a small recruitment team” – “IT_Works” states. He announced “lots of vacancies” in\nJune 2021, so candidates were encouraged to apply for job openings or to make\nspontaneous applications. “No formalization under the Labor Code” is stipulated, as to\ncomfort some and prevent others.\n\nThere were over a dozen job openings on behalf of Conti spotted in less than two months,\nrevealing a highly specialized and organized group structure. As commonly observed among\nransomware groups originating from Russia or countries within the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), the communication is performed in Russian and the job listings\nare addressed to “Russian speakers only!”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An example of a job listing posted by a Conti representative on June 11 on a Russian-_\n_speaking cybercriminal forum. Translated from Russian, the post reads:_\n_“Vacancy for the position of Business Analysts. Required Skills: Business English_\n_(reading) required, conversational is a big plus; Knowledge of business particularities in the_\n_U.S.; Analytical skills, attention to detail; Advanced PC user. Responsibilities: Analysis of_\n_B2B markets; Analysis of companies’ financial statements, and other public data obtained_\n_from government institutions; Drawing up cases on key players on the financial and industrial_\n_markets […]”_\n\nA close look at these messages allows us to draw up a rough picture of the Conti’s internal\nstructure, which can be imaged as follows:\n\n_An overview of how the Conti Group is structured, based on statements recently made by its_\n_representatives on different cybercriminal forums_\n\nThis is slightly out of the ordinary job offers that other ransomware groups publish (most\noften for pentester positions). Of particular curiosity is the position of Asterisk Administrator.\nBased on a July 2021 announcement by Conti, a dedicated Asterisk VoIP service was in\ndevelopment, probably to initiate phone conversations with the victims or the victim’s\npartners or employees, in order to put more pressure on them. Threat actors are particularly\ninterested in the “Auto Redial” feature of the Asterisk framework to put the phone number on\nautomatic dial repeatedly, until the called party picks up the phone.\n\nThe group is also looking for Web Designers with “really creative ideas“ and UI/UX Designers\n“to design layouts of websites and individual user interfaces of web applications”.\n\nTo study potential victim’s activity or to analyze the already attacked ones, Business Analysts\nare wanted. They must be proficient in English and know the business particularities in the\nU.S, have good analytical skills and “pay attention to detail”. Business Analysts working for\n\n\n-----\n\nConti prospect the B2B market, collect and analyze companies financial statements and\nother public data obtained from government institutions, and they are also drawing up cases\non key players on the financial and industrial markets, according to “IT_Works”.\n\nWhat is also quite unique is the well-structured corporate approach Conti adopted: their\n“partners” have paid vacations and sick leaves. They usually have a 3pm-1am, Monday to\nFriday work schedule, remote only.\n\n## What do the Conti leaks tell us?\n\nFollowing the first leak release, we decided to analyze its content and tried to assess how\nuseful it could be in terms of threat intelligence and detection.\n\n[The archive, retrieved by vx-underground⁹, contains a majority of text files written in russian,](https://vxug.fakedoma.in/tmp/ManualsAndSoftware.rar)\na few archives, binaries, scripts, and softwares (e.g. Cobalt Strike 4.3, Router Scan), and\nwhat looks like an unstructured manual explaining to Conti affiliates how to operate.\n\n_Archive content_\n\n[A public quick English translation¹⁰ has been made available to organize the leak with three](https://github.com/silence-is-best/files/blob/main/translate_f.pdf)\nmain attack steps: Increasing privileges and information collection, Uploading data and Lock.\nFor each step, each manual provides one or more tools/techniques to reach the objective\nwith a kind of best practices approach and a collection of the best tools to use.\n\nThere is no new tool or technique to discover, everything is quite old and renowned\n(e.g. Mimikatz) and should already be detected. Although they are up-to-date with the latest\nvulnerability and have a manual for “PrintNightmare” (CVE-2021-34527, that is still not fixed\nby a proper patch from Microsoft). Obviously they also try to use Microsoft built-in tools as\nmuch as possible to blend-in with legitimate activities in order to avoid detection\n(e.g. powershell, wmi).\n\nSome recommendations are made in terms of operational security in the manual files\ntranslated as “Anonymity for the paranoid” and “Personal safety” (not available in the public\nEnglish translation):\n\nA couple of notes on posts about anonymity for the paranoid:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The task is not to hide (it still won t work), but to merge with the crowd. So by disabling\n\nwebrtc, Javascript, Flash, etc. just attract more attention to yourself. You should NOT\nDISCONNECT, but CHANGE what allows you to be detected.\n2. Concerning Kali and other operating systems for hackers. There is a group of people\n\n(Hackers) that needs to be tracked. Technically, this problem is difficult to solve. It’s\neasier to play on human weakness (laziness) and gather everyone together by\nproviding a properly advertised, convenient, ready-made and popular solution. I think\nthe idea is clear. I advise you to use Debian or build something of your own.\n\nI think everyone here works through a virtual machine. Therefore, I advise you to install the\nvirtual machine on the encrypted volume using VeraCrypt.\n\n1 download Veracrypt\n\n2 you will need to allocate space on your disk for a file / or encrypt the entire disk at once\n\nAn important rule is that you will have to install the virtual machine again, because,\nunfortunately, when you encrypt your old working virtual machine, an insurmountable error\nwill appear in the code and it will no longer start. This is not a big problem, because you can\nget all your files from the image of your old virtual machine via 7ZIP.\n\nBecause they are hunting for administrator accounts, they are also cautious about their\nreaction. In the following extract from the “Hunting admins, please read, very useful !!”\nmanual, a very explicit warning is made to dissuade an attacker to directly login to a\ncomputer session of an administrator:\n\nNext is an IMPORTANT POINT.\n\nFirst of all, beginners try to raise a session there and VERY OFTEN catch an alert. Alert at\nthe admin = cutting out of the network, loss of time, nerves. Do not do this!\n\nWhat we’re going to do is poll it through the file system.\n\nBut at the same time they could go for a live brute force of accounts when required, and as\n[noticed by other researchers¹¹, use the same example directory (i.e. “ProgramData”) for all](https://twitter.com/TheDFIRReport/status/1423365874585640961)\ntheir command outputs which probably leads to a lot of copy/paste.\n\n_“ProgramData” directory usage example_\n\nTheir discovery, collection and exfiltration methods match a lot with other ransomware\ngroups and most of the time the techniques described aim for efficiency more than\nstealthiness.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall the archive reveals an interesting insider look into some ransomware attack\noperations where the attackers look for the weakest points of defense. It also confirms that\nmost of the techniques from these groups are known and give lots of detection opportunities.\nThis should again remind us as defenders where to focus on.\n\n[The second leak¹² was not as useful: these are 27GBs of mainly tutorial video files from](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1426422201574694915)\nseveral sources (free or paying ones), teaching about penetration testing (e.g. Metasploit,\nCobalt Strike, network) and reverse engineering. Some sources are in English while others\nare in Russian but none seem specific to Conti. Indeed, the content of this leak confirms that\nConti recruiters are also looking for beginners who will then be trained by following these\ntutorials, as indicated on a cybercriminal forum:\n\n_Translated from Russian, the post reads: “Recruitment of pentesters continues. […] Whether_\n_you’re a professional or a beginner, it doesn’t matter. We have an individual approach to_\n_everyone. We will teach and help, we need guys who want to progress in a long-term_\n_cooperation!”._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nConti leaks are a great source of knowledge to find out more about how ransomware cartels\noperate overall. It gives good insights into how they handle their operations, how they are\norganized and the techniques being used in these operations. This will likely raise the\ninterest of other threat actors who might enter the ransomware scene by embracing a modus\noperandi that, up until now at least, has worked very well.\n\nIn the second part of this blog series we will cover some techniques used by Conti in the first\nleak and the detection opportunities for each one.
