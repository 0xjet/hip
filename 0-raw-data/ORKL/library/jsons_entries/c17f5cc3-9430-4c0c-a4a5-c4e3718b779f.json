Initially it was believed that this was due to a hack into\nTeamViewer itself, but the company has denied this. Instead, they have blamed password reuse, especially with millions of old passwords in the wild thanks to disclosed social\nnetwork breaches.\n\nOthers have speculated that malware could be in use somehow, and that may be the case.\nWe have evidence that trojanized TeamViewer installer packages have been used in a spam\ncampaign that resulted in attackers gaining remote access to various systems. While this\nparticular spam campaign used an old version of TeamViewer, we can't dismiss the\npossibility of other attacks using newer versions.\n\nThis spam campaign targeted users in Italy, using a variety of subject lines such as the\nfollowing (English translation in parenthesis):\n\n\n-----\n\nAccesso dati (Data access)\nIl tuo ID e stato usato (Your ID was used)\nProva gratuita 30 giorni (Free 30-day trial)\nConferma dell'ordine (Order conformation)\nIl tuo conto informazione (Your account information)\nFinanziamento?????? (Financing)\n\nA simple .JS (JavaScript) file was attached to these messages; when run this file downloads\nvarious files onto the system:\n\nA keylogger, detected as TSPY_DRIDEX.YYSUV\nA \"Trojanized\" version of TeamViewer, detected as BKDR_TEAMBOT.MNS.\nA batch file which executed the above two items, then deletes itself\n\nThis particular Trojanized version that the malware installs is very old - version 6.0.17222.0.\nTeamViewer 6 was first released in December 2010 and was superseded by version 7 in\nNovember 2011. Secondly, it is installed in an unusual location: %APPDATA%\\Div. (Some\nvariants installed their copy into %APPDATA%/Addins instead.) This behavior is consistent\nacross all the various permutations of this attack we have seen.\n\nThis version of TeamViewer was Trojanized, but not by modifying the legitimate version.\nInstead, it includes an additional DLL - avicap32.dll. (This malicious DLL is detected as\nBKDR_TEAMBOT.DLL.) In a classic case of DLL search order hijacking; the legitimate\nTeamViewer applications loads two functions from this DLL; the legitimate version of which is\na part of Windows. However, the presence of the malicious version allows an attacker to take\ncontrol of the TeamViewer application.\n\nThis particular campaign targeted users in Italy for a month, ample time to gather all of a\nvictim's usernames and passwords. The presence of a Trojanized TeamViewer version\nraises the possibility that a newer version may exist in the wild and account for some of the\nrecent attacks.\n\nOne more thing to note is that the TeamViewer administrators may be able to limit the\ndamage of old versions. All TeamViewer connections are initially mediated by company\nservers. It may be possible for connections from these unsupported versions to be\ndisconnected at this handshake stage, preventing any malicious use from progressing. It\nwould unfortunately also cut out any users of these old versions.\n\n[Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Security,](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/products/software/index.html) Smart\nProtection Suites, and [Worry-Free™](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/small-business/product-security/) [Business Security can protect users and SMBs from](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/small-business/product-security/)\nthis threat by detecting malicious files, and spammed messages as well as blocking all\n[related malicious URLs.
