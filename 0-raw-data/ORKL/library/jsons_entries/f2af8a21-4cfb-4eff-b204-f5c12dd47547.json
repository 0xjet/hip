    "plain_text": "# UNC1151 Assessed with High Confidence to have Links to Belarus, Ghostwriter Campaign Aligned with Belarusian Government Interests\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)**\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the\nBelarusian government. This assessment is based on technical and geopolitical indicators.\n[In April 2021, we released a public report detailing our high-confidence assessment that](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\nUNC1151 provides technical support to the Ghostwriter information operations campaign;\nthis assessment, along with observed Ghostwriter narratives consistent with Belarusian\ngovernment interests, causes us to assess with moderate confidence that Belarus is also\nlikely at least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign. We cannot rule out\nRussian contributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter. However, at this time, we have\nnot uncovered direct evidence of such contributions.\n\n## Cyber Espionage Targeting Most Closely Aligns with Belarusian Government Interests\n\nUNC1151 has targeted a wide variety of governmental and private sector entities, with a\nfocus in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Germany. The targeting also includes\nBelarusian dissidents, media entities, and journalists. While there are multiple\nintelligence services that are interested in these countries, the specific targeting scope is\nmost consistent with Belarusian interests. In addition to the targeting scope, UNC1151\noperations have focused on obtaining confidential information and no monetization\nefforts have been uncovered.\n\nSince at least 2016, UNC1151 has registered credential theft domains that spoof\nlegitimate websites to steal victim credentials. Outside of the major American\ncompanies that are used worldwide (Facebook, Google, Twitter), most spoofed\norganizations have been in the five countries listed above. This has included\nregional webmail providers, national and local governments, and private\nbusinesses.\nMalware based intrusions have also focused on Eastern Europe. Multiple significant\nintrusions into Ukrainian government entities have been conducted by UNC1151.\nThough most of the activity was targeting Ukraine, some targeted Lithuania and\nPoland.\nUNC1151 targeted multiple Belarusian media entities and several members of the\npolitical opposition in Belarus in the year before the 2020 Belarusian election.\nUNC1151 has targeted media entities in Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, and Latvia, but\nwe have not seen similar targeting of opposition leaders or domestic political\nactivists in these countries. Additionally, in several cases, individuals targeted by\nUNC1151 before the 2020 Belarusian election were later arrested by the Belarusian\ngovernment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group has not targeted Russian or Belarusian state entities. It has spear phished\nintergovernmental organizations dealing with former-Soviet states, but not their\ngovernments.\n\nWhile the majority of UNC1151 operations have targeted countries neighboring Belarus, a\nsmall minority have been conducted against governments with no obvious connection to\nBelarus. There are multiple possible explanations for this targeting, including incidental\ninclusion on diplomatic mailing lists, or non-public bilateral issues. However, the\ntargeting that does not align directly to Belarusian interests could indicate that UNC1151\nalso supports additional priorities. These out-of-scope operations mainly took place\nbetween 2016 and 2019.\n\nFigure 1: Map of UNC1151 Targeting from 2017 to 2020\n\nHistorical UNC1151 domains have spoofed the websites of entities such as Malta’s\nGovernment, Kuwaiti Army (mail.kuwaitarmy.gov-kw.ml), France’s military, and\nother targets that are beyond Belarus’ immediate geographic neighborhood. More\nrecent UNC1151 domains have spoofed entities related to high priority targets such\nas Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine.\nIn June 2019, UNC1151 sent a phish with a malicious attachment to 33 recipients.\nWhile the majority were in located in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine, it was\nalso sent to the Colombian, Irish and Swiss governments. In addition, multiple\ncredential theft emails have been sent to the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n## Technical Evidence Indicates Operators Located in Minsk, Possible Connection to the Belarusian Government.\n\n\n-----\n\nSensitively sourced technical evidence indicates that the operators behind UNC1151 are\nlikely located in Minsk, Belarus. This assessment is based on multiple sources that have\nlinked this activity to individuals located in Belarus. In addition, separate technical\nevidence supports a link between the operators behind UNC1151 and the Belarusian\nmilitary.\n\nEvidence for the location in Belarus and connection to the Belarusian Military has\nbeen directly observed by Mandiant.\nThese connections have been confirmed with separate sources.\n\n## Operational Continuity and No Links to Previously Tracked Groups\n\nMandiant has tracked UNC1151 since 2017, and during this time there have been no\noverlaps with other tracked Russian groups, including APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm,\nand TEMP.Armageddon. While we cannot rule out Russian support for or involvement in\nUNC1151 or Ghostwriter operations, the TTPs used by UNC1151 are unique to this group.\n\nSandworm Team has conducted significant credential theft operations during the\ntime UNC1151 has been active, but the techniques used have been distinct. While\nUNC1151 primarily sent phishes impersonating security notices, Sandworm team\nhas leveraged watering holes designed to redirect users to spoofed login websites.\nTEMP.Armageddon has conducted extensive targeting of multiple Ukrainian\nentities during the time UNC1151 has been actively targeting Ukraine. The two\ngroups appear to act without knowledge of the other and do not share any malware,\ninfrastructure, or other resources.\nWe continue to assess that Ghostwriter activity is distinct from other information\noperations campaigns such as Secondary Infektion.\nSince 2017, UNC1151 operations have leveraged evolving but contiguous TTPs. This\nevolution is consistent with the maturation of a single organization, and we have not\nuncovered any evidence of a discontinuity in operators.\n\n## Ghostwriter Operations Aligned with Narrower Belarusian Interests Since Mid-2020\n\nPre-2020 Ghostwriter information operations were primarily anti-NATO, but since mid2020 they have focused on Belarus’ neighbors.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Ghostwriter Operations 2016-2021\n\nFrom the earliest observed Ghostwriter operation until mid-2020, the Ghostwriter\ncampaign primarily promoted anti-NATO narratives that appeared intended to undercut\nregional security cooperation in operations targeting Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. To\nthis end, observed operations have disseminated disinformation portraying the foreign\ntroop presence in the region as a threat to residents and alleging that the costs of NATO\nmembership are a detriment to local populations. The seeming intended effect of these\nnarratives—to erode regional support for NATO—can serve both Russian and Belarusian\ninterests. We note, however, that the campaign has specifically targeted audiences in\ncountries bordering Belarus, whereas Russia has long promoted anti-NATO narratives\nboth in the region and further afield. Specifically, observed Ghostwriter operations, in this\ntime period and through the present, have almost completely excluded Estonia, which\nnotably does not border Belarus but is a Baltic State, NATO member, and a relevant\ncomponent of any concerns about NATO’s security posture on its eastern flank.\n\nTwenty-two out of 24 observed Ghostwriter operations conducted prior to mid2020 promoted narratives that were either directly critical of NATO—including\nallegations of the deployment of nuclear weapons, NATO troops spreading COVID19, and crimes committed by NATO troops—or otherwise critical of the presence of\nforeign troops from allied member states.\nTwo additional operations conducted during this period promoted narratives that\nappeared intended to create controversy in Lithuanian domestic political affairs.\n\nSince the disputed August 2020 elections in Belarus, Ghostwriter operations have been\nmore distinctly aligned with Minsk’s interests. Promoted narratives have focused on\nalleging corruption or scandal within the ruling parties in Lithuania and Poland,\nattempting to create tensions in Polish-Lithuanian relations, and discrediting the\nBelarusian opposition. Both governments have strongly condemned the Lukashenka\nregime’s crackdown on demonstrations and extraordinary efforts to stay in power. In\naddition, several Ghostwriter operations have promoted narratives specific to Belarus,\nincluding narratives critical of alleged Polish government support for Belarusian\ndissidents. It is possible that operations seemingly intended to undermine local\nconfidence in the Lithuanian and Polish governments are a response to what Belarus has\nclaimed to be their intervention in Belarusian domestic affairs. Likewise, operations\nseemingly intended to create tensions between the two nations may be an attempt to\nundercut their cooperation, which has in part characterized their responses to Belarusrelated issues.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn August 2020, Ghostwriter personas published articles that portrayed the protests\nin Belarus as orchestrated by the U.S. and NATO, claiming that NATO is willing to\nintervene militarily on behalf of the protestors and arguing that the West should\nrefrain from interfering in the \"internal affairs\" of Belarus.\nAdditionally, Ghostwriter operations have promoted narratives that seem designed\nin part to suggest foreign interference in Belarus, primarily from Poland and\nLithuania.\nSince the August 2020 elections, 16 out of 19 Ghostwriter operations promoted\nnarratives defaming the Polish and Lithuanian governments. Of the remaining three\nnarratives, two criticized NATO and one the EU.\nSome operations targeting Poland and Lithuania have promoted narratives with\nconnections to regional disputes involving Belarus. For example, multiple\noperations have alleged that accidents had occurred at Lithuanian nuclear power\nfacilities. Lithuania has actively opposed the construction and operation of Belarus’s\nAstravyets nuclear power plant, which is located near the Lithuanian border.\nLikewise, an August 2021 Ghostwriter operation targeting Poland and Lithuania\npromoted a narrative about a fabricated crime committed by migrants, while Poland\nand Lithuania were accusing Belarus of orchestrating an outflow of migrants from\nits borders.\nWe have observed some dissemination of these narratives in Russian by what we\nassess to be campaign assets. The promotion of Ghostwriter narratives in Russian\nsuggests that they are in some way also intended to influence Russian-speaking\naudiences.\n\nGhostwriter narratives, particularly those critical of neighboring governments, have been\nfeatured on Belarusian state television as fact. We are unable to ascertain whether this is\npart of a coordinated strategy or if it is simply Belarusian state TV promoting narratives\nthat are consistent with regime interest and being unconcerned with accuracy. Such\ntelevision programs suggest that some Ghostwriter operations’ promoted narratives are\nparticularly relevant to the ongoing internal political conversation in Belarus, and it raises\nthe possibility that discrediting rival governments and Belarusian opposition figures in\nthe eyes of the Belarusian public may be an additional goal of the Ghostwriter campaign.\n\nWe have observed multiple instances of Ghostwriter narratives discrediting the\nPolish government promoted on Belarusian state-owned TV news. The TV reports\nhave featured allegedly leaked Polish government communications and documents\nthat were promoted in a hack-and-leak style Ghostwriter operation that began in\nJune 2021. They also specifically highlighted narratives that news programs framed\nas documenting Polish support for the Belarusian opposition. In one instance, a\nBelarusian TV news report even cited by name a Russian-language Telegram\nchannel that we believe to be a Ghostwriter asset as its source.\nWe have additionally observed pro-Belarusian government Telegram channels\nregularly repost or cite a Russian-language Telegram channel that we have\nattributed to Ghostwriter.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Uncertainty around Malware Development and Information Operations Content\n\nThe sources of written content for Ghostwriter operations and of the malware used by\nUNC1151 remain uncertain. The creation of content for information operations, especially\nin multiple languages, requires a distinct skillset from conducting computer intrusions.\nLikewise, the development of custom malware requires software engineering skills that\nare distinct from those required to set up a credential theft operation. It is possible that\nthe individuals supporting these functions are part of the same organization assessed to\nhave a nexus to Belarus; however, the uncertainty and distinct skillsets required for\ndifferent aspects of this activity creates a possibility for the involvement of additional\norganizations or countries.\n\nGhostwriter information operations have published content in English, Lithuanian,\nPolish, Latvian, Ukrainian, Russian, and German.\nWe have determined that UNC1151 uses GoPhish primarily for their email sending\noperations – including both cyber espionage and Ghostwriter content\ndissemination. They often spoof the from envelope of the emails and previously\nleveraged email delivery services such as SMTP2GO to legitimize themselves.\nTechnical details from early UNC1151 campaigns suggest that the group was\nunfamiliar with these technologies and may have learned on the job how to use\nthem properly.\nUNC1151 uses credential harvesting domains attempting to spoof legitimate\nwebmail providers, generic login pages, and the legitimate websites of their targets.\nThese credential harvesting domains are sent to victims via phishing email. Over\ntime, UNC1151 domain registration TTPs have shifted. Early domain registration\nTTPs looked similar to, but did not technically overlap with, clusters of credential\nharvesting domains we attributed to Russian threat groups. Notably the group has\nshifted away from using Freenom and towards using Cloudflare services, which may\nbe reflective of increased resources being available to the group.\nUNC1151 has used a proprietary suite of malware, including HIDDENVALUE, and\nHALFSHELL, and has infrequently been observed using open source or publicly\navailable tools. Though we have observed the use of these early-stage foothold\nmalware families, we have yet to see post-compromise activity.\nUNC1151 has improved in its technical skill since we began tracking the group.\nUNC1151 malware families are commonly .NET applications with basic command\nfunctionality. We have not seen any code overlap between these malware families,\nthough supported commands appear to be similar at a high level. We have observed\nvariants of HIDDENVALUE which support slightly different sets of commands.\nPrior to HIDDENVALUE, which has been used in several different operations\ntargeting Ukraine and Poland, malware families used by UNC1151 may have been\nused for limited sets of operations.\n\n## Attribution Summary\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the Belarusian\ngovernment and with moderate confidence is linked to the Belarusian military. This is\nbased on the below factors:\n\nThe countries targeted by the majority of UNC1151 operations have strained\nbilateral relationships with Belarus. While some of these countries are consistent\ntargets of Russian cyber espionage, the specific mix supports a Belarusian nexus.\nMinistries of Defense are the most common government entities targeted by\nUNC1151, suggesting a military intelligence focus for the group.\nIndividual targets, including individuals who are part of the Belarusian opposition\nand media are of most interest to Belarus.\nSensitive technical information locates the operation in Minsk, Belarus and links it\nto the Belarusian Military.\nUNC1151 has conducted operations without a clear, direct link to Belarusian\npriorities. However, these are a minority of operations and are plausibly explained\nby multiple factors.\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that Ghostwriter information operations are\nconducted in support of the Belarusian government and with moderate confidence that\nthey are conducted with Belarusian sponsorship.\n\nThe operations conducted since the disputed Belarusian elections in 2020 have\nconformed to specific parochial Belarusian government goals and align with the\novert actions taken by Belarus against Lithuania and Poland.\nThe close technical links between UNC1151 and the Ghostwriter campaign suggest a\nhigh likelihood of a shared sponsor.\nHowever, we lack insight into the generation of the information operations’ content.\n\nMandiant has examined the possibility of Russian participation in UNC1151 and\nGhostwriter operations, but we do not have sufficient evidence to confirm or refute a role\nin these activities. Mandiant has seen high level TTP overlaps with Russian operations\nand much of the targeting and information operations are consistent with Russian goals.\nGiven the close ties between the governments, collaboration is plausible; however, we\nhave not uncovered direct evidence of Russian government involvement.\n\nUNC1151’s initial focus on NATO’s reputation in the Baltics is also a goal of Russia.\nHowever, the operations focuses in Lithuania and Latvia, which border Belarus, and\nwere not uncovered in Estonia, which does not.\nRussia has significant offensive cyber and information operations expertise that\ncould have supported the operation.\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\n\n-----\n\nBelarusian sponsorship of UNC1151 and the links to the Ghostwriter operations\nshowcases the accessibility and deniability of provocative information operations. While\nthe cyber espionage operation was regionally focused and primarily leveraged an open\nsource platform to steal credentials, it was able to support impactful information\noperations. These types of cyber operations are a one of many tools that governments use\nto accomplish their goals, and do not exist in a vacuum, but are leveraged alongside other\ntypes of operations.\n\n\n-----",
