These leaks appear to\nconfirm the long-suspected connections between Conti and the Russian FSB, and provide key\ninsight into the development of new threats and techniques.\n\nNotably, these leaked chats exposed a new front in the ongoing evolution of firmware-based\nattacks. In addition to classical attacks that target UEFI/BIOS directly, attackers are now\ntargeting the [Intel Management Engine (ME) or Intel Converged Security Management Engine](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008927/software/chipset-software.html)\n(CSME). ME is a physical microcontroller that is part of the chipset of modern Intel-based\nsystems. It supports a variety of capabilities such as out-of-band management. There are\nseveral different variations of this component to be aware of, Management Engine (before\nSkylake, also sometimes known as Intel Manageability Engine), Intel Converged Security and\nManagement Engine (Skylake and newer), Intel Trusted Execution Environment (Atom\nplatforms). In addition, there’s an alternate firmware family used in servers known as Server\n\n\n-----\n\nPlatform Services. But in general, all of these refer to an out-of-band management processor\nwhich is built into the Intel chipset and runs independently from the CPU(s). For simplicity,\nwe’ll use the term ME firmware or simply, the chipset, to refer to this set of Intel management\nprocessors.\nIt is important to note that no new or unmitigated vulnerabilities have been identified and that\nIntel chipsets are no more or less vulnerable than any other code. The issue is that most\norganizations do not update their chipset firmware with the same regularity that they do their\nsoftware or even the UEFI/BIOS system firmware. This can leave some of the most powerful\nand privileged code on a device susceptible to attack.\n\nCompromising the Management Engine of a system would have considerable value on its\nown, but the leaks show that the group is using the unique privileges of the ME firmware as a\nway to gain indirect access to the UEFI/BIOS, drop additional payloads, and gain runtime\ncontrol of the system below the operating system using System Management Mode (SMM).\nSuch level of access would allow an adversary to cause irreparable damage to a system or to\nestablish ongoing persistence that is virtually invisible to the operating system.\n\nLeaked conversations indicate that the Conti group had already developed proof-of-concept\ncode for these methods nine months ago. We expect that these techniques will be used in the\nwild in the near future if they haven’t already so we wanted to share our insight into ME\nfirmware in order to help organizations make better threat and impact-informed security\ndecisions. Analysis includes:\n\n**Chipset Vulnerabilities – While it is known that these adversaries are actively analyzing**\nthe ME for new vulnerabilities, we wanted to identify the known vulnerabilities that\nattackers could use so that organizations can reduce their firmware attack surface.\n**Attack Flow and Scenarios – We show different attack scenarios based on the low-**\nlevel settings and protections set on a system, including in cases where the BIOS is\nproperly write-protected.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attacker Objectives and Impact Analysis – Review of how attackers can use the ME**\nand system firmware to achieve the greatest possible damage and impact to target\norganizations.\n\n**Mitigations and Best Practices – Key steps that organizations should be taking today**\nto defend their devices from these and similar threats.\n\n### About Intel ME and AMT:\n\n[As defined by Intel, the Intel® Management Engine (ME) is “an embedded microcontroller](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008927/software/chipset-software.html)\n_(integrated on some Intel chipsets) running a lightweight microkernel operating system that_\n_provides a variety of features and services for Intel® processor–based computer systems”_\nincluding out-of-band management services. These remote management capabilities enabled\nby the ME are known as Intel [Active Management Technology (AMT). Thus the ME is the](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology.html)\nphysical controller and AMT is one of the services provided by the ME.\n\nThe ME portion of the chipset is conceptually similar to the baseboard management\ncontrollers (BMCs) used for out-of-band management of enterprise servers. In addition to\nhaving its own kernel, ME has access to its own flash memory stored in the SPI (which also\ncontains the UEFI/BIOS), a dedicated connection to the network interface, and has power that\nis independent of the operating system. These capabilities allow “the Intel® Management\n\n\n-----\n\n_Engine to be up before the main operating system is started, and to_ _respond to OOB_\n_commands from the IT management console without having to wake up the rest of the_\n_system.” And while ME/CSME are conceptually similar to a BMC, it is important to note that_\nthese components are integrated into a very wide range of devices, enabling attacks that\nwould be far more scalable and generic than BMC attacks.\n\n## How Adversaries are Targeting Chipset and UEFI Firmware\n\nAnalysis of internal Conti communications revealed that attackers were deeply investigating\nvulnerabilities related to ME firmware as well as BIOS_WP (BIOS Write Protection). This is a\nsignificant change in tactics from the most recent firmware threats. For example, well-known\nfirmware threats such as [TrickBoot,](https://eclypsium.com/2020/12/03/trickbot-now-offers-trickboot-persist-brick-profit/) [MosaicRegressor, and](https://eclypsium.com/2020/10/14/protecting-your-organizations-from-mosaicregressor-and-other-uefi-implants/) [LoJax all looked for a well-known](https://eclypsium.com/2018/10/01/uefi-attacks-in-the-wild/)\nvulnerability resulting from the misconfiguration of the BIOS Control register in the SPI\ncontroller as a way of writing the SPI and manipulating the UEFI/BIOS firmware of the device.\nHowever, this vulnerability is well known and often patched. By shifting focus to Intel ME as\nwell as targeting devices in which the BIOS is write protected, attackers could easily find far\nmore available target devices.\n\nOur analysis found that Conti was focusing research in the following areas.\n\n1. Fuzzing the Management Engine Interface and finding undocumented commands and\n\nvulnerabilities. Note that the Management Engine Interface (MEI) was previously named\nthe Host Embedded Controller Interface (HECI) and is referred to as HECI within the\nexposed chats, but both names are still commonly used.\n\n2. Attempting to access SPI (the flash memory used by the UEFI/BIOS system firmware)\n\nfrom the ME in order to generically bypass other protections. Provisioning AMT or\nchanging other ME configurations from the host could expose ME vulnerabilities, leading\nto code execution. With code execution in the ME, access to SPI flash and other\nresources can bypass the usual protections.\n\n3. They are considering not only a dropper (placing malware on the host OS) from UEFI\n\nbut also a System Management Mode (SMM) implant. SMM is a runtime CPU mode\ncontrolled by the UEFI/BIOS that is more privileged than the “Ring-0” operating system\nkernel. The operating system kernel doesn’t have the ability to examine SMM code or\nblock it from executing. As a result, an SMM implant could modify the kernel on the fly\nwith complete stealth and without the OS being able to do anything to prevent it.\n\nExcerpts from the chat below illustrate the progression of Conti’s investigations and\ndevelopment of proof-of-concept (POC) code.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Translated chat discussing the research and proof-of-concept development of using ME**\n**to rewrite flash and gain SMM execution.**\n\n**Chats confirming completion of POC for SMM.**\n\n## Deep Analysis and Threat Modeling\n\nBased on the available insights into attacker goals and methods, the Eclypsium team aimed to\ndig deeper to understand how a real-world attack would take place. There are several aspects\nto consider, but at a very high level we can look at an attack as three important phases.\n\n1. Attacker gains access to a target host – This can be done via any number of common\n\nmethods (either local or remote), whether via spear-phishing, exploiting a common OS\nor application vulnerability, an insider, or during any phase of the distribution,\nwarehousing, or delivery phase of the device’s supply chain lifecycle.\n\n2. Attacker gains control over ME – This would be done either by a new 0-day\n\nvulnerability or via known vulnerabilities that provide remote code execution (RCE) and\nprivilege escalation (PE). Because some of the ME vulnerabilities can be exploited\nremotely, this can make the previous step optional and an attacker can directly gain\ncontrol of the ME without first exploiting a vulnerability in the host side of the platform.\n\n3. Use ME to rewrite UEFI/BIOS or gain SMM Execution – The ME firmware is inside the\n\nUEFI Trusted Computing Base (TCB), which opens the potential for an attacker to infect\nthe UEFI from the ME. Attackers just need to bypass SPI Descriptor and BIOS Control\nregister protections. We will look at multiple scenarios showing how this would work in a\nreal attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mapping the Path to Exploiting ME\n\nFirst, we need to map out the various ways that an attacker could gain control over the ME\nfirmware. It is important to note that ME has its own dedicated access to the network adapter\nof the host, which is independent of the host operating system. Attackers such as the\n[PLATINUM group have used this capability in the past to hide command-and-control from OS-](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/07/platinum-continues-to-evolve-find-ways-to-maintain-invisibility/)\nlevel security controls.\n\nAttackers also could exploit the chipset after gaining initial access to the system via virtually\nany traditional vector such as phishing, malware, or supply chain compromise. Attackers\nwould once again be able target vulnerabilities enabling code execution, but with the\nadvantage of not having to rely solely on vulns that can be exploited over the network. It is\nimportant to note that the leaks indicate that Conti engineers are seeking out new ME\nfirmware vulnerabilities. However, we have compiled a list of the known ME and AMT\nvulnerabilities most likely to be targeted based on their potential to enable remote code\nexecution (RCE) and/or privilege escalation (PE). We have included a table of these\n[vulnerabilities as an appendix here, which includes the relevant Intel security advisories,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaddrzUO6pK4w13oV3g8nq-ohzL7fllVFsk2hb66EzI/edit#bookmark=id.od19ly5mgphr)\naffected versions, and CVEs.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers could also target ME in a more direct way via phishing by luring a user into\n[executing a malicious ISO as observed in recent Quantum ransomware attacks. This method](https://web.archive.org/web/20220429212843/https://thedfirreport.com/2022/04/25/quantum-ransomware/)\ntakes advantage of the HECI driver that provides access to the ME. The HECI driver is\ninstalled on any system that has ME and enables privileged users to communicate with ME.\nThus an attacker could embed a malicious ISO within an email, gain application execution by\ntricking the user into opening the file, then run the attack by using HECI to communicate with\nME.\n\n### Known High-Impact Vulnerabilities in Intel ME\n\n\nIntel\nAdvisory\n\nIntelSA00086\n\nIntelSA00112\n\nIntelSA00118\n\nIntelSA00125\n\nIntelSA00131\n\nIntelSA00141\n\n\nAffected Versions Related\nCVEs\n\n\nCSME versions before version 12.0.5 CVE-20183657CVE2018-3616\n\n\nME –\n6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x/10.x//11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20\n\nManageability Engine Firmware version\n3.x,4.x,5.x,6.x,7.x,8.x,9.x, 10.x,11.x\n\n\nCVE-20175705CVE[2017-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-5711)\n5711CVE2017-5712\n\nCVE-20183628\n\n\nManagement Engine version 11.x CVE-20183627\n\nCSME before version 11.21.55 CVE-201812147\n\n\nCSME before version 11.8.55, 11.11.55, 11.21.55,\n12.0.6\n\n\nCVE-20183643\n\n\nNotes\n\nCVE-2017-5712\nis exploitable\nremotely over\nthe network in\nconjunction with\na valid\nadministrative\nIntel®\nManagement\nEngine\ncredential.\n\nRCE on same\nsubnet\n\nExecute\narbitrary code\n\nLocal privilege\nescalation\n\nLocal execute\narbitrary code\n\nLocal execute\narbitrary code.\nSide channel\nattack to get\nsession key via\nnetwork.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelSA00185\n\nIntelSA00213\n\nIntelSA00241\n\n\nCSME before version 11.8.60, 11.11.60, 11.22.60\nor 12.0.20\n\nCSME before versions 11.8.65, 11.11.65, 11.22.65,\n12.0.35\n\nAMT versions 11.0 thru 11.8.65, 11.10 thru\n11.11.65, 11.20 thru 11.22.65, 12.0 thru 12.0.35,\n13.0, 14.0.0\n\n\nCVE-201812196CVE201812200CVE201812190\n\nCVE-20190091CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0086)\n0086 CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0153)\n0153CVE2019-0096\n\nLPE:\n\nCVE-201911147CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11105)\n11105CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11104)\n11104 CVE201911097CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11103)\n11103CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11087)\n11087CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11106)\n11106CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11110)\n11110CVE2019-11108\n\nAPE:\n\nCVE-20190169CVE2019-11088\n\nNPE:CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11132)\n11132CVE[2019-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11131)\n11131CVE2019-11107\n\n\nLocal execution\nof arbitrary code\nand local\nprivilege\nescalation.\n\nUnprivileged\nuser privilege\nescalation and\nnetwork\nprivilege\nescalation.\n\nLocal privilege\nescalation.\nAdjacent\nprivilege\nescalation,\nnetwork\nprivilege\nescalation of\nunauthenticated\nuser.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelSA00295\n\nIntelSA00307\n\nIntelSA00391\n\nIntelSA00404\n\nIntelSA00459\n\n\nCSME Versions 11.0 through 11.8.76, 11.10\nthrough 11.12.76, 11.20 through 11.22.76, 12.0\nthrough 12.0.63, 13.0 through 13.0.31, 14.0\nthrough 14.0.32, 14.5.11.\n\nCSME, AMT, I ISM, DAL and DAL Software before\nversions 11.8.77, 11.12.77, 11.22.77, 12.0.64,\n13.0.32, 14.0.33, 14.5.12\n\nCSME versions before 12.0.49 (IOT only: 12.0.56),\n13.0.21, 14.0.11.\n\nCSME and AMT versions before 11.8.82, 11.12.82,\n11.22.82, 12.0.70, 13.0.40, 13.30.10, 14.0.45 and\n14.5.25\n\nAMT and ISM versions before 11.8.79, 11.12.79,\n11.22.79, 12.0.68 and 14.0.39.\n\nCSME versions before 11.8.86, 11.12.86, 11.22.86,\n12.0.81, 13.0.47, 13.30.17, 14.1.53, 14.5.32 and\n15.0.22\n\n\nNetwork\nprivilege\nescalation of\nunauthenticated\nuser, local\nprivilege\nescalation.\n\nLocal privilege\nescalation\n\nUnauthenticated\nnetwork\nprivilege\nescalation.\nLocal privilege\nescalations.\n\nLocal privilege\nescalation\n\nLocal privilege\nescalation\n\n\nNPE:\nCVE-20200594CVE2020-0595\n\nLPE:\n\nCVE-20200586CVE[2020-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0542)\n0542CVE[2020-](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0533)\n0533CVE2020-0541\n\nCVE-201914598\n\nNPE:\nCVE-20208752\n\nLPE:\n\nCVE-202012297CVE202012303CVE202012354CVE20208744CVE2020-8757\nCVE-20208756CVE2020-8760\n\nCVE-20208758\n\nCVE-20208703\n\n\nIt is important to note that many systems are vulnerable to CVEs covered in these Intel\nadvisories. For example, a recent analysis of a production network found that 72.3% of\ndevices were vulnerable to CVEs in Intel SA00391, which contains the potential for network\nprivilege escalation. Likewise, 61.45% of devices were vulnerable to issues covered in\nSA00295, which also enables privilege escalation over a network. These two security\nadvisories include vulnerabilities from the Ripple20 disclosure and additional remotelyexploitable vulnerabilities in the Treck TCP/IP stack found by Intel as a followup to the initial\nRipple20 disclosure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Moving From ME to UEFI/SMM\n\nME is a highly privileged component within the system, and has its own flash memory within\nthe SPI. An attacker with control over the ME can then use that access to overwrite the UEFI\nsystem firmware and gain SMM code execution. The details of how this is done will vary\ndepending on the types of protections and settings of the target system. Two of the most\nimportant settings in this regard is if BIOS write protection (BIOS_WP) is properly set on the\ndevice, and if ME firmware has the privileges to modify different SPI regions in the access\ncontrol table within the SPI Descriptor.\n\nWe will look at three scenarios in more detail.\n\n**Scenario #1**\n\nSystem State:\n\nME has access to overwrite the SPI Descriptor in the SPI Descriptor access control table\nSPI Controller BIOS Write Protections are properly configured\n51% of firmware update images with SPI descriptor had this level of access\n\nBy using ME to modify the SPI Descriptor, an attacker could change the BIOS Region layout,\nthus moving the BIOS outside the area protected by BIOS_WP. The attacker could then\nmodify the firmware to install their own malicious implant code.\n\n**Attacker uses ME to move BIOS region outside of Write Protection region and inserts**\n**implant into firmware**\n**Scenario #2**\n\nSystem State:\n\nME has access to BIOS Region in SPI Descriptor access control table\nSPI Controller BIOS Write Protections are properly configured\n52% of firmware update images with SPI descriptor had this level of access\n\nMany systems have the SPI descriptor configured by the OEM to grant the ME write\npermission to the BIOS region. This could be used to allow the ME to write to the BIOS region\nin the SPI flash to modify UEFI firmware. In the case that the SPI controller BIOS Write\nProtections are configured and prevent writes to the BIOS region even by the ME the ME can\n\n\n-----\n\ntrigger the CPU to enter SMM mode and issue SPI transactions while the CPU is running in\nSMM. The SPI controller is designed to allow the BIOS region to be updated even when the\nBIOS Control register is configured properly when the CPU is in SMM.\n\n**Scenario #3**\n\nSystem State:\n\nME does not have access to BIOS Region in SPI Descriptor access control table\nSPI Controller BIOS Write Protections are properly configured\n\nAnother useful capability of the ME is the ability to reboot the host CPU and force it to boot\nfrom virtual media. This is intended to be used to (re)install operating systems and other\nmaintenance tasks. The way that this is implemented is that the ME can trigger a Host\nPartition Reset which causes the host CPU to be reset and PLTRST# to be asserted. When\nthis happens, several PCH protection mechanisms are unlocked, such as the BIOS Control\nregister in the SPI controller.\n\nThis could be used by a compromised ME to use its DMA engine to inject code into the host\nprocessor DRAM to get arbitrary code execution at a point when SMRAM and the SPI\nprotections have not been locked yet. This would allow the ME to write to SPI flash even when\nthe SPI descriptor and BIOS Control register protections are implemented correctly. This could\nalso be used to install malicious SMI handlers before SMRAM is locked to leave an\nundetectable rootkit running while the operating system loads and runs, though we did not\ndevelop proof of concept code to confirm this.\n\n## Attacker Objectives and Impact Analysis\n\nIt is important to understand why attackers are investing resources in developing these new\npaths to a system’s firmware. Control over firmware gives attackers virtually unmatched\npowers both to directly cause damage and to enable other long-term strategic goals.\n\n### Destruction of Assets\n\nIn terms of damage, an attacker can effectively “brick” a system permanently by overwriting\nthe system firmware. Similarly, an attacker could use this level of access to wipe the Master\nBoot Record or other high-value files on a system. Wipers such as WhisperGate and\nHermeticWiper have played a major and ongoing role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and\nprovide a stark reminder of the damaging potential of low-level attacks on devices. While such\nlow level wiper attacks have averaged about one major event per year, in the first quarter of\n2022, there have been 6 or more wipes discovered in the wild. Attacker motives are shifting to\ndestructive objectives, whether APTs, ransomware, or high profile criminal espionage actors\n[such as LAPSUS$.](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/04/28/lapsus-recent-techniques-tactics-and-procedures/)\n\n### Persistence\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, firmware also provides long-term persistence capabilities that would be particularly\nvaluable to a group such as Conti. Attackers are able to use the unique privileges of firmware\nto evade a wide variety of security features, and security products in order to establish\nongoing persistence on a device. Groups like Conti directly monetize such persistence by\nreselling access to other threat actors, or even dropping additional ransomware payloads at a\nlater date.\n\n### Evasion of AV/EDR/XDR Products\n\nThis ability to maintain persistence is tied to the ability for an attacker’s code to reside off of\nthe traditional system storage drives, and most importantly, the ability to evade security\ncontrols. By sitting below the operating system, attackers can hide in areas where traditional\nsecurity tools lack visibility. Antivirus and EDR have very limited coverage of firmware threats\nand lack the ability to proactively verify the integrity of a device’s firmware. This makes it\nrelatively easy for attackers to evade detection. Additionally, traditional products lack visibility\ninto components outside of UEFI such as ME firmware. This ability to shift the attack to areas\nthat security tools fail to protect gives attackers incredible advantages.\n\nEven when antivirus, EDR, and other endpoint security tools do query a system’s firmware,\nthey typically rely on the operating system in order to do so. However, if the firmware is\nalready compromised, a malicious firmware implant can easily report false information to the\noperating system in order to evade those security controls. Such techniques were recently\n[observed in the wild. Likewise, the use of SMM allows attackers to execute code that is](https://eclypsium.com/2022/01/12/the-ilobleed-implant-lights-out-management-like-you-wouldnt-believe/)\ncompletely invisible to the operating system, and likewise, the security products running within\nthe OS.\n\nThe focus on evading security tools was confirmed in the chats, which showed the group was\nactively acquiring endpoint security tools for developing evasion techniques and testing.\nAdditional chats confirmed that the actors were able to bypass up to eight well-known EDR\nproducts, while struggling to evade at least three of them. Indeed, the driving motive behind\nexploring ways to attack and access the UEFI, is to be able to disable any of the overlying\nsecurity controls and third party security stack that resides at the OS layer.\n\n### Evasion of Device Protections\n\nIn addition to evading security products, attackers can use compromised firmware in order to\nevade many of the protections built into modern systems. This includes features such as\nBitLocker, Windows Virtual Secure Mode (VSM), Credential Guard, and Early Launch\nAntiMalware (ELAM).\n\n## Mitigations and Best Practices\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the information disclosed in the Conti leaks, organizations should take action to\nreduce their exposure and develop capabilities to detect and respond to these new\ntechniques. There are several key steps that we recommend:\n\n1. Scan Devices for Exploitable Versions of ME – We have provided a list of the known\n\nCVEs most likely to be used in an attack. Device scans should include CVEs as well as\ndetecting versions of firmware that gives ME access to the BIOS Region in the SPI\nDescriptor access control table. Organizations should use a tool that specializes in\nfirmware vulnerabilities (e.g. CHIPSEC, Eclypsium), as many traditional vulnerability\nscanners lack the necessary drivers and access to scan down to the level of ME.\n2. Monitor ME for Any Configuration Changes – Organizations should check to verify\n\nthat the ME firmware on their devices matches a valid, known version of firmware from\nIntel. Any changes would indicate that the firmware may have been compromised or\ntampered with. Ideally, organizations should verify this information using mechanisms\nthat are independent of the operating system.\n3. Verify the Integrity of the SPI Flash and Monitor for Any Configuration Changes –\n\nThe same integrity checking and monitoring should be applied to the SPI flash firmware\nas well as the UEFI/BIOS of the device. Once again, firmware should match known good\nversions, and teams should be alerted to any changes particularly tied to anomalous or\nunreleased code.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe recent Conti leaks mark a critical phase in the rapidly evolving role of firmware in modern\nattacks. Threats such as TrickBoot, MosaicRegressor, and dozens of new forms of wiper\nmalware have continued to drive attacks below the level of the operating system. However,\nthe Conti leaks exposed a strategic shift that moves firmware attacks even further away from\nthe prying eyes of traditional security tools. The shift to ME firmware gives attackers a far\nlarger pool of potential victims to attack, and a new avenue to reaching the most privileged\ncode and execution modes available on modern systems.\n\nAs the realities of the threat landscape continue to evolve, it is critical that organizations\ncontinue to inform their defenses based on the latest intelligence available. The Eclypsium\nteam will continue to strive to provide updated insight and guidance into these and other\nfirmware threats as they become available. For any questions related to this research, please\n[contact the Eclypsium team at info@eclypsium.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:info@eclypsium.com)\n\n\n-----",
