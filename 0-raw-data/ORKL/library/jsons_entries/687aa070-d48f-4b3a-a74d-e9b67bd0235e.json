While the U.S.A and China experienced\nminimal percentage changes, +8% and -4%, respectively,\nRussia witnessed a sizable 62% increase in botnet C&Cs.\nHowever, the award for the most significant growth in\nQ4 goes to Switzerland, with a whopping 169% surge.\n\n\n### Increases across Europe\n\n\nAnother quarter – another set of increases across Europe\nrelating to botnet C&C activity. This quarter, every new\nTop 20 entry is based in Europe: Sweden (#17), Austria\n(#19), and Lithuania (#20).\n\nMeanwhile, of the countries listed that suffered an uplift in\nbotnet C&Cs this quarter, over 50% were based in Europe.\n\n\n### Is Saudi Arabia finally improving?\n\n\nSince Q4 2021, Saudi Arabia has not only been in the Top\n20, but in the Top 10 countries for hosting botnet C&Cs…\nuntil Q1 2023. With a -38% decrease, it has finally dropped\nout of the Top 10 to #14. Let’s hope this trend continues,\nand it drops off the listings entirely.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Geolocation of botnet C&Cs, Q1 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Top 20 locations of botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Country** **Q4** **Q1** **% Change**\n**2022** **2023** **Q on Q**\n\n**#1** United States 1713 1857 8%\n\n**#2** China 1033 993 -4%\n\n**#3** Russia 500 811 62%\n\n**#4** Netherlands 467 683 46%\n\n**#5** Germany 391 609 56%\n\n**#6** France 227 319 41%\n\n**#7** United Kingdom 165 249 51%\n\n**#8** Switzerland 61 164 169%\n\n**#9** Canada 148 154 4%\n\n**#10** Singapore 125 152 22%\n\n\n**Rank** **Country** **Q4** **Q1** **% Change**\n**2022** **2023** **Q on Q**\n\n**#11** Finland 72 135 88%\n\n**#12** Mexico 140 127 -9%\n\n**#13** India 75 115 53%\n\n**#14** Saudi Arabia 182 113 -38%\n\n**#15** Bulgaria 77 109 42%\n\n**#16** Japan 67 101 51%\n\n**#17** Sweden - 100 New entry\n\n**#18** Poland 71 92 30%\n\n**#19** Austria - 70 New entry\n\n**#20** Lithuania - 61 New entry\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs, Q1 2023\n\n\n### Cobalt Strike and Qakbot remain prevalent\n\n\nIn Q1, Cobalt Strike remained in the #1 spot for a third\nquarter. This malware was associated with 160% more\nbotnet C&Cs than its closest rival, the backdoor\n[Initial Access Broker, Qakbot.](https://check.spamhaus.org/faqs/?id=What_is_access_broker)\n\n### A surge in credential stealers\n\nThe number of botnet C&Cs associated with credential\nstealers amounted to only 5.79% of listings in Q4 2022;\nhowever, this quarter, that percentage rose to 22.47%.\n\nOne of the key contributors to this increase was\nRecordBreaker. This malware experienced a remarkable\n899% rise in listings, jettisoning it from #15 in Q4 2022\nto #3 in Q1 2023. Evidently, RecordBreaker is benefiting\nfrom the code boost it received in 2022.\n\n### Tofsee spambot – a consistent listing\n\nOver the past few years, it’s a rarity for Tofsee not\nto appear in the Top 20. This quarter we saw a slight\nreduction (-12%) in its number of listings, taking it from\n#12 to #18 this quarter.\n\nTo discover how to protect against this malware, read the\nblog posts recently published by our malware specialists\nfocusing on two malware vaccines and a network-based\nkill switch:\n\n1. [Binary file vaccine](https://www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/neutralizing-tofsee-spambot-part-1-binary-file-vaccine/)\n2.

The same\nbotnet infrastructure also serves as C&Cs for other malware\nfamilies, such as TeamBot. To make our internal tracking\nof this threat easier, we continue to label the associated\ninfrastructure as “FluBot.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,  Q1 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Malware families associated with botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Q4 2022** **Q1 2023** **% Change** **Malware Family** **Description**\n\n**#1** 2657 2182 -18% Cobalt Strike Pentest Framework\n\n**#2** 1020 969 -5% Qakbot Backdoor\n\n**#3** 89 889 899% RecordBreaker Credential Stealer\n\n**#4** 497 417 -16% RedLineStealer Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#5** 90 380 322% AsyncRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#6** 380 332 -13% Flubot Android Backdoor\n\n**#7** - 321 New entry IcedID Credential Stealer\n\n**#8** - 256 New entry Sliver Pentest Framework\n\n**#9** 89 254 185% Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#10** - 194 New entry ISFB Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#11** 121 185 53% DCRat Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#12** 245 175 -29% Bumblebee Backdoor\n\n**#13** - 168 New entry Rhadamanthys Credential Stealer\n\n**#14** 177 155 -12% NjRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#15** - 143 New entry Aurora Stealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#16** - 83 New entry Vidar Credential Stealer\n\n**#17** 100 81 -19% Emotet Backdoor\n\n**#18** 91 80 -12% Tofsee Spambot\n\n**#19** 120 67 -44% AveMaria Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#20** 47 56 19% Amadey Credential Stealer\n\n\n**0** **1000** **2000** **3000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware type comparisons between  Q4 2022 and Q1 2023\n\n43.36%\n\nPentest Framework\n\n33%\n\n22.86%\n\nBackdoor\n\n16.58%\n\nRemote Access 19.71%\nTrojan (RAT) 22.36%\n\n6.20%\n\nAndroid Backdoor\n\n4.49%\n\n5.79%\n\nCredential Stealer\n\n22.47%\n\n1.48%\n\nSpambot\n\n1.08%\n\nRemote 0%\n\n0%\n\nDDoS bot 0.59%\n\n0%\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%**\n\nQ4 2022 Q1 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q1 2023\n\n### Freenom’s troubles equate to a positive change \n\nAt the end of last year, we reported that some of the\nFreenom TLDs (.ga & .ml) were experiencing significant\nreductions in the number of associated botnet C&C\n\n**a brief overview**\n\nregistrations. This quarter all of Freenom’s TLDs\n(.cf, .ga, .gq, .ml, .tk) have dropped out of the Top 20.\n\nWe’d love to say that’s because they started to take abuse **Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\non their TLDs seriously, but given their history, we know\nthat’s extremely unlikely. Instead, the truth lies in the legal\nactions taken by a social giant…\n\n[In March of this year, Freenom was sued by Meta, alleging](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations/)\n\nsome are closed e.g., .honda.\n\n[cybersquatting violations and trademark infringement,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations/)\nand for some time, the registry hasn’t been accepting\nnew domain registrations.\n\nAs we have always stated, botnet operators look for the\npath of least resistance – where infrastructure is cheap,\nor ideally free, and registration processes devoid of\nverification. We’re delighted to see these TLDs dropping\noff our rankings.\n\nThe question is, “Who are those miscreants now turning\nto for botnet C&C domain registrations?”\n\n\n### Unbelievable increases\n\n\nBoth .us, the ccTLD run by Registry Services LLC, and .me,\nthe one-time ccTLD now run as a gTLD by DoMEn d.o.o,\nhave experienced some of the highest percentage increases\nquarter-on-quarter that we’ve witnessed since we began\ncompiling the Botnet Update. In Q1 2023, .us experienced\na +1,569% increase, and .me a +1,497% increase!!!\n\nIs this just a coincidence that following Freenom’s\n“freeze” on new domain registrations, we see other\nregistries experience unprecedented increases in domains\nassociated with botnet C&Cs?\n\nWe urge both registries to review their registration\nprocesses and that of their affiliated registrars.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q1 2023 (continued)\n\n### Interpreting the data\n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains\nhave greater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q1\n\n**New entries**\n\n2023, .net had more than 13m domains, of which 0.001%\nwere associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .us had\napproximately 220k domains, of which 0.393% were\n\ncyou (#18), fun (#19).\n\nassociated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top ten\nof our listings. Still, one had a much higher percentage\n\n**Departures**\n\nof domains related to botnet C&Cs than the other.\n\nbr, cf, cfd, de, ga, gq, ml, tk.\n\n### Working together with the industry for  a safer internet\n\nNaturally, we prefer no TLDs to have botnet C&Cs\nlinked with them, but we live in the real world and\nunderstand there will always be abuse.\n\nWhat is crucial is that abuse is dealt with quickly.\nWhere necessary, if domain names are registered\nsolely for distributing malware or hosting botnet C&Cs,\nwe would like registries to suspend these domain names.\nWe greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries\nwho work with us to ensure these actions are taken.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q1 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Top abused TLDs - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Q4 2022** **Q1 2023** **% Change** **TLD** **Note**\n\n**#1** 2184 2736 25% com gTLD\n\n**#2** 190 1094 476% top gTLD\n\n**#3** 52 868 1569% us ccTLD\n\n**#4** 152 541 256% ru ccTLD\n\n**#5** 29 463 1497% me Originally ccTLD, now effectively gTLD\n\n**#6** - 318 New entry site gTLD\n\n**#7** 46 252 448% online gTLD\n\n**#8** 114 242 112% org gTLD\n\n**#9** 68 174 156% net gTLD\n\n**#10** - 162 New entry website gTLD\n\n**#11** 37 145 292% info gTLD\n\n**#12** 84 131 56% shop gTLD\n\n**#13** - 104 New entry space gTLD\n\n**#13** - 104 New entry one gTLD\n\n**#15** 220 103 -53% xyz gTLD\n\n**#16** - 92 New entry click gTLD\n\n**#17** - 90 New entry cn ccTLD\n\n**#18** - 76 New entry cyou gTLD\n\n**#19** - 73 New entry fun gTLD\n\n**#20** 160 69 -57% cloud gTLD\n\n\n**0** **1000** **2000** **3000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,  Q1 2023\n\n\n### NameSilo is back in pole position\n\n\nAfter briefly being knocked off its top spot at the end\nof last year by Tucows, NameSilo is back to its #1 position\n(sadly). In Q1, it saw a 409% growth in the number\nof fraudulent domain registrations for botnet C&Cs,\ncompared to the previous quarter.\n\nWe guess that the only good news for NameSilo in\nthis data is the fact that its percentage increase was\nsurpassed by three other registrars: West263 (1448%),\nGoogle (723%) and Hostinger (411%).\n\n\n### Nice work Tucows\n\n\nAs touched on above, Tucows had a dreadful time\nregarding the number of botnet C&C registrations at the\nend of last year, with 597 in Q4 2022. We’re delighted\nto report that at the end of Q1 2023, these numbers had\nreduced by 75% taking them to 149, dropping them down\nthe Top 20 from #1 to #11.\n\nKeep on slashing those numbers Tucows.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,  Q1 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Most abused domain registrars - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Q4 2022** **Q1 2023** **% Change** **Registrar** **Country**\n\n**#1** 414 2109 409% NameSilo Canada\n\n**#2** 554 1152 108% Namecheap United States\n\n**#3** 190 626 229% RegRU Russia\n\n**#4** 168 613 265% PDR India\n\n**#5** 31 480 1448% West263 China\n\n**#6** 48 395 723% Google United States\n\n**#7** 75 375 400% Nicenic China\n\n**#8** - 297 New entry OwnRegistrar United States\n\n**#9** 46 235 411% Hostinger Lithuania\n\n**#10** 103 165 60% Sav United States\n\n**#11** 597 149 -75% Tucows Canada\n\n**#12** - 108 New entry Xin China\n\n**#13** 100 91 -9% Alibaba China\n\n**#14** 56 74 32% Porkbun United States\n\n**#15** - 55 New entry R01 Russia\n\n**#16** 23 48 109% Name.com China\n\n**#17** 23 46 100% RU-Center Russia\n\n**#18** 57 45 -21% GMO Japan\n\n**#19** 42 43 2% Gandi France\n\n**#20** 49 36 -27% Openprovider Netherlands\n\n\n**0** **500** **1000** **1500** **2000** **2500**\n\n\n### LOCATION OF MOST ABUSED DOMAIN REGISTRARS\n\n\n**Country** **Q1 2023** **Q4 2022**\n\nCanada 31.62% 37.07%\n\nUnited States 29.17% 28.75%\n\nChina 15.43% 8.58%\n\nRussia 10.18% 7.81%\n\nIndia 8.58% 6.16%\n\nLithuania 3.29% 1.69%\n\nJapan 0.63% 2.09%\n\nFrance 0.60% 1.54%\n\nNetherlands 0.50% 1.80%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Networks hosting the most newly observed botnet C&Cs, Q1 2023\n\n### Does this list reflect how quickly networks deal with abuse?\n\nWhile this Top 20 listing illustrates that there may be **Networks and botnet**\nan issue with customer vetting processes at the named **C&C operators**\nnetwork, it doesn’t reflect on the speed that abuse desks\n\nNetworks have a reasonable\n\ndeal with reported problems.
