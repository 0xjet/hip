[..] SolarWinds is unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers.\"\n\n## Only impacts servers with SSH enabled\n\n\n-----\n\nThe zero-day vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2021-35211) impacts Serv-U Managed File\nTransfer and [Serv-U Secure FTP, and it enables remote threat actors to execute arbitrary](https://www.solarwinds.com/ftp-server-software)\ncode with privileges following successful exploitation.\n\nAccording to SolarWinds, \"if SSH is not enabled in the environment, the vulnerability does\nnot exist.\"\n\nThe bug found by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Offensive\nSecurity Research teams in the latest Serv-U 15.2.3 HF1 released in May 2021 also affects\nall prior versions.\n\nSolarWinds has addressed the security vulnerability reported by Microsoft with the release\nof Serv-U version 15.2.3 hotfix (HF) 2.\n\n\n**Software**\n**Version**\n\nServ-U 15.2.3\nHF1\n\n\n**Upgrade Paths**\n\nApply Serv-U 15.2.3 HF2, available in your Customer Portal\n\n\nServ-U 15.2.3 Apply Serv-U 15.2.3 HF1, then apply Serv-U 15.2.3 HF2, available in\nyour Customer Portal\n\n\nAll Serv-U\nversions prior to\n15.2.3\n\n\nUpgrade to Serv-U 15.2.3, then apply Serv-U 15.2.3 HF1, then apply\nServ-U 15.2.3 HF2, available in your Customer Portal\n\n\nThe company added that all other SolarWinds and N-able products (including the Orion\nPlatform and Orion Platform modules) are unaffected by CVE-2021-35211.\n\n\"SolarWinds released a hotfix Friday, July 9, 2021, and we recommend all customers\n**using Serv-U install this fix immediately for the protection of your environment,\" the US-**\nbased software firm warned.\n\nSolarWinds provides additional info on how to find if your environment was\ncompromised during the attacks Microsoft reported.\n\n[Customers can also request more information by opening a customer service ticket with the](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/support/submit-a-ticket?sid=satsn)\nsubject \"Serv-U Assistance.\"\n\n## The SolarWinds Orion supply-chain attack\n\nLast year, SolarWinds [disclosed a supply-chain attack coordinated by the Russian Foreign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/)\nIntelligence Service.\n\nThe attackers breached the company's internal systems and trojanized the Orion Software\nPlatform source code and builds released between March 2020 and June 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious builds were later used to deliver a backdoor tracked as Sunburst to fewer\nthan 18,000,\" but, luckily, the threat actors only picked a substantially lower number of\ntargets for second-stage exploitation.\n\nRight before the attack was disclosed, SolarWinds' list of 300,000 customers worldwide\n\n[[1,](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers) [2] included more than 425 US Fortune 500

the\nState Department, NASA, NSA, Postal Service, NOAA, the US Department of Justice, and\nthe Office of the President of the United States.\n\nMultiple US govt agencies confirmed that they were
