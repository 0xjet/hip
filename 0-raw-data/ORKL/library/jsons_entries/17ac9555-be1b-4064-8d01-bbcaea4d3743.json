    "plain_text": "# Challenge accepted\n\n**blog.group-ib.com/malibot**\n\n11.08.2022\n\nDetecting MaliBot, a fresh Android banking trojan, with a Fraud Protection solution\n\nFlubot is dead, and the new evil is detected and crowned, the first of his name – MaliBot.\nWell, in fact this new MaliBot is a revised follower of another Android banking trojan –\nS.O.V.A. MaliBot malware, usually disguised as a cryptocurrency mining application, targets\nAndroid devices and uses overlay attacks to outfox MFA/2FA, capture messages and SMS,\nand steal banking and crypto credentials.\n\nBy this moment, it has mainly threatened financial sector companies in Spain and Italy.\nObviously, it has an ominous ambition and surely still untapped potential to infuse into other\nindustries and conquer new territories.\n\nIn this article we will tell in more detail what techniques exist against such attacks, and give\n[you a live demonstration of how Group-IB Fraud Protection stops MaliBot or other similar](https://www.group-ib.com/products/fraud-protection/)\nthreats.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaliBot fraud dossier\n\n## Challenging anti-fraud professionals\n\nAs you can clearly see, this malware is powerful and tricky, which makes it a real challenge\nto detect this attack and other similar to MaliBot malwares with an average anti-fraud tool.\nThat’s actually why the financial sector is such fertile soil for threat actors successfully\nstealing money from banking and cryptocurrency accounts.\n\nMaliBot operators harness a variety of distribution campaigns: they promote cryptocurrency\napplications in the form of APKs that victims are supposed to download and install manually;\nthey clone real projects like TheCryptoApp (1M+ downloads on Google Play Store);\noperators also use smishing (SMS phishing) and other methods to multiply their chances to\nsucceed.\n\nEven though the overall context looks scary, fear not because advanced solutions and\ntactics, developed to respond to similar web injection threats and this particular one, do exist,\nand one of them is almost at your doorstep.\n\n## Proven tactics to respond\n\nThere are at least two major countermeasures to leverage against such fraud attacks.\nAccording to your case, you have a choice between fraud intelligence and behavioral\nanalysis. Let us explain to you what’s the difference and how it works.\n\nThe signature-based analysis utilizes the abilities of fraud intelligence to collect information\nabout the application and compare its certification deviation to other application certificates.\nOnce information about installed applications is gathered, it is essential to match them with\nalready known trojan signatures.\nHere are some examples of suspicious Android permissions:\n\n\n-----\n\nPROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS\n\nSEND_SMS\n\nWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n\nREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n\nRECEIVE_SMS\n\nAnother way to thwart such attacks is a so-called behavioral analysis that\n\ncomprises overlay or accessibility service detections;\nrealizes default SMS application monitoring;\ncaptures the slightest deviations in the user's behavior routine.\n\nEvery tiny derogation matters here: the speed of movement, pressure on the screen while\nusing the app, and other factors that could drop an alert about anomalies.\n\n## Where intelligence meets analysis\n\nGroup-IB [Fraud Protection is a solution that combines device fingerprinting, fraud](https://www.group-ib.com/products/fraud-protection/)\nintelligence, and behavioral analysis and already protects more than 300M+ web and mobile\napps users worldwide against advanced digital threats, malware, payment fraud, social\nengineering attacks, and bad bots. The solution acts in real-time and across all digital\nchannels.\n\n[Group-IB Fraud Protection utilizes the threat intelligence insights collected by the Unified](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\nRisk Platform by Group-IB giving us the full fraud landscape visibility, and our professional\nexpertise turns these insights into actionable anti-fraud strategies.\n\nBetter to see something once, so please check out this video demonstration of how MaliBot\ntypically acts and what signals Group-IB Fraud Protection solution collects to detect the\nthreat:\n\n\n-----",
