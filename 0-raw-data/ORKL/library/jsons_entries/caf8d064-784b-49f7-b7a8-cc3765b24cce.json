Clop also leverages double extortion practices and hosts a leak site, where\nthe number of victims has grown significantly since its launch in March 2020. Clop has been\ncommonly observed being delivered as the final-stage payload of a malicious spam\n\n\n-----\n\n[campaign carried out by the financially motivated actor TA505. This ransomware has also](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter)\n[been linked to threat actors behind the recent global zero-day attacks on users of the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion.html)\nAccellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) product.\n\nDue to the surge of this malicious activity, we’ve created this threat assessment for overall\nthreat awareness. Full visualization of the techniques observed and their relevant courses of\n[action can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/)\n\n## Clop Ransomware Overview\n\n[Clop ransomware is a variant of a previously known strain called CryptoMix. In 2019, Clop](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2016/07/22/about-cryptomix-ransomware/)\nwas delivered as the final payload of a phishing campaign associated with the financially\nmotivated actor TA505. The threat actors would send phishing emails that would lead to a\nmacro-enabled document that would drop a loader named Get2. This loader can download\ndifferent tools used by this group, such as SDBot, FlawedAmmy or FlawedGrace. After the\nthreat actors obtain the initial foothold on the system, they start employing reconnaissance,\n[lateral movement and exfiltration techniques to prepare the ransomware deployment. SDBot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0461/)\n[has been observed delivering Clop as the final payload.](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/security-information/clop-clop-ta505-html-malspam-analysis/)\n\nAfter the ransomware is executed, Clop appends the .clop extension to the victim's files. We\nhave observed different variants using different extensions, such as “.CIIp”, “.Cllp” and\n“.C_L_O_P”. Different versions of the ransom note have also been observed after\nencryption. Depending on the variant, any of these ransom text files could drop:\n“ClopReadMe.txt”, “README_README.txt”, “Cl0pReadMe.txt“ and “READ_ME_!!!.TXT”.\n\nThis ransomware includes various features to avoid detection. Observed Clop samples try to\nkill several processes and services related to backups and security solutions. It won’t\n[execute if it detects it’s running in a virtual environment. Clop also leverages Code Signing to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002/)\nevade detection. We observed the use of two signers during our research, as shown below\nin Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Observed Clop digital signers.\n\n\n-----\n\nClop went from being ransomware delivered through malicious spam to being used in\ntargeted campaigns against high-profile companies. In recent events, Clop has been linked\nto threat actors who have been exploiting Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA)\n[vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-27101,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27101) [CVE-2021-27102,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27102) [CVE-2021-27103 and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27103) [CVE-2021-27104.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27104)\nThe exploitation of these vulnerabilities led to the compromise of high-profile companies\n[starting in February. Additionally, there has been evidence of an affiliate using a webshell](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion.html)\nnamed DEWMODE that was being used to steal data from Accellion FTA devices. Not long\nafter compromise, victims affected by DEWMODE began receiving emails from threat actors\nannouncing the breach with an unique URL per victim to start negotiation efforts. If ignored,\nthe threat actors would reach out again with an ultimatum of releasing the data to “Cl0p^_Leaks”.\n\nClop didn't have a leak site when it was first sighted back in February 2019. It was in March\n2020 when the threat actors decided to launch a leak site titled, “Cl0p^_- Leaks” (Figure 2).\nThis website is a Tor-based blog site, where victims who don’t pay the ransom or ignore\nthreats have their confidential data publicly exposed. The threat actors behind Clop also\n[leverage a variety of extortion techniques, such as targeting workstations of top executives,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/some-ransomware-gangs-are-going-after-top-execs-to-pressure-companies-into-paying/)\n“doxxing” employees and advertising their breaches to reporters.\n\nFigure 2. Clop leak site and sample instructions delivered by Clop operators detailing how to\nimprove security posture and close security holes – for a price.\nMore information on ransomware and victimology can be found in the 2021 Unit 42\nRansomware Threat Report.\n\n**Courses of Action**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section documents relevant tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used with Clop\nand maps them directly to Palo Alto Networks product(s) and service(s).

Organizations should be aware of SDBot, used by TA505, and how it can lead to the\ndeployment of Clop ransomware. Like many other current ransomware families, Clop hosts a\nleak site to create additional pressure and shame victims into paying the ransom.\n\n[Indicators associated with this Threat Assessment are available on GitHub, have been](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs)\n[published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed and are viewable via the ATOM Viewer.](https://stix2.unit42.org/)\n\nIn addition to the above courses of action, AutoFocus customers can review additional\nactivity by using the tag [Clop.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Clop)\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n_Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of_\n_compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
