In July, President\nObama issued Presidential\nPolicy Directive (PPD)-41,\nwhich identifies the Federal\nGovernment’s principles concerning cyber incident\ncoordination among federal agencies.The directive identifies\nthe five principles for incident response through three\nlines of effort. PPD-41 designates NCCIC as the lead for\nasset response, one of the three lines of effort. NCCIC will\nrespond to an incident at the request of the affected asset\nowner to stop the attack, mitigate its affects, and provide\nthe asset owner with guidance on making its system more\nsecure. NCCIC will then share anonymized information\nabout the attack with other asset owners so they can learn\nfrom each incident and better protect their systems.\n\nAlso this year, NCCIC and the Industrial Control Systems\nCyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) joined an\ninteragency team in travelling to Ukraine after cyber attacks\non the country’s power infrastructure.These attacks, which\noccurred on December 23, 2015, caused unscheduled\npower outages, affecting many Ukrainian power customers.\nThe team worked with the Ukrainian government to\nunderstand and gain insight about the attacks.\n\nIt has been another busy and successful year for NCCIC, and\nonce again, I am proud of all that they have accomplished.\nMoving into 2017, we continue to look for ways to be\nmore effective in the fight against cyber threats, and we\nlook forward to continuing the dialogue with our partners\nin government, industry, and the critical infrastructure (CI)\ncommunity that helps us do so.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Felker\nNCCIC Director of Operations\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\n\nMarty Edwards,\nICS-CERT Director\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nICSJWG Government Coordinating Council (GCC) Chair\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NCCIC\n\nThe National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration\nCenter (NCCIC) is a 24x7 cyber situational awareness, incident\nresponse, and management center that is a national nexus\nof cyber and communications integration for the Federal\nGovernment, intelligence community, and law enforcement.\nThe NCCIC shares information among public and private sector\npartners to build awareness of vulnerabilities, incidents, and\nmitigations.\n\n###### ICS-CERT\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response\nTeam (ICS-CERT) is one of NCCIC’s four branches. (ICS-CERT\nworks closely with private sector asset owners, vendors, and\ngovernment agencies at all levels (Federal, state, local, and tribal)\nto protect America’s critical infrastructure (CI) from cyber\nattacks.With these entities, ICS-CERT works to coordinates\nthe sharing of information, services, and tools to help CI asset\nowners prevent, mitigate, and recover from cyber incidents and\nattacks.The United States depends on CI to support national\ndefense, economic stability, and public health and safety.\nPresidential Policy Directive (PPD)-21 identifies 16 CI sectors.\nAny disruptions or destruction to CI could be catastrophic for the\nNation. ICS-CERT’s activities include eight main functions. Four\nare operations functions, which include situational awareness,\nincident response, vulnerability coordination, and technical\nanalysis.The other four are risk reduction functions, including\ncybersecurity assessments, distribution of the Cyber Security\nEvaluation Tool (CSET), training, and Industrial Control Systems\nJoint Working Group (ICSJWG) activities.\n\n### ICS-CERT\n\n|Col1|I|CS|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|-C|Col2|E|Col4|Col5|R|T|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n### With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.\n\n###### DHS Mission Statement\n\nWith honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and\nour values.\n\n###### NCCIC Vision\n\nThe NCCIC vision is a secure and resilient cyber and communications infrastructure\nthat supports homeland security, a vibrant economy, and the health and safety of the\nAmerican people.\n\n###### NCCIC Mission\n\nThe NCCIC mission is to reduce the likelihood and severity of incidents that may\nsignificantly compromise the security and resilience of the Nation’s critical information\ntechnology and communications networks.\n\n###### ICS-CERT Mission\n\nICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure by\nstrengthening control systems security and resilience through public-private\npartnerships.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### g g p\n\n- **Assessments: ICS-CERT conducted 130 onsite and**\nremote cybersecurity assessments across 12 of the 16\nCI sectors in 19 states, Washington D.C., and Guam.

In the application of mitigation step,\nthe team coordinates with vendors to allow sufficient time\nfor affected end users to obtain, test, and apply mitigation\nstrategies prior to ICS-CERT’s public disclosure of the\nvulnerability. In the disclosure step, after coordinating with\nvendors and gathering technical and threat information,\nthe team publishes an alert or advisory to notify end users\nabout the vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT strives to disclose\naccurate, neutral, objective information. ICS-CERT references\nother available information on vulnerabilities and corrects\nmisinformation when necessary.\n\n###### Vulnerability Coordination in FY 2016\nICS-CERT handled 187 vulnerability tickets and coordinated\n305 unique vulnerabilities.The Vulnerability Coordination\nteam worked closely with researchers and vendors to\nencourage patching of validated vulnerabilities.The\nVulnerability Coordination team also put together two\ndifferent research panel discussions for the fall 2016\nICSJWG meeting.The two panels consisted of vulnerability\nresearchers and medical research companies that provided\ndifferent perspectives in the ICS community.\n\n\n###### Vulnerability Coordination Case Study from 2016\nThis past August, NCCIC/ICS-CERT received notice that a remote attacker had used a zero-day exploit against the\nmaritime transportation sector.The attacker exploited an SQL injection vulnerability in a web-based application\nused by multiple U.S. ports that provides real-time access to operational logistics information, resulting in a\nloss of valuable data. Once notified of this cyber attack, ICS-CERT issued an alert detailing the vulnerability and\nproviding mitigation measures. ICS-CERT also contacted the vendor of the application to learn additional details\nand the status of a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. ICS-CERT then successfully notified all U.S. ports using the\nsoftware and confirmed that they acquired and installed the necessary patch. ICS-CERT also shared the alert with\nrelevant international partners and encouraged them to install the patch.Thanks to these efforts, the maritime\ntransportation sector is more secure, resilient, and better prepared to respond to the next cyber attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nICS-CERT’s Technical Analysis team consists of several groups\nworking toward a common goal.Technical analysis includes\nall aspects of malware analysis; reverse engineering; log\nand artifact analysis; long-term analysis exploring systemic\nvulnerabilities, potential future threats, tactics, techniques,\nand procedures; and other intractable long-term problems.\nThe AAL performs ICS-CERT’s primary technical analysis\nwork.The AAL performs most of the malware and artifact\nanalysis. Primary backup support for the AAL and the\nmajority of our applied research projects takes place\nat Sandia National Laboratory (SNL).We also have an\nagreement with and sponsor research by the Air Force\nInstitute of Technology (AFIT).\n\n###### Advanced Analytical Laboratory\nThe AAL provides research and analysis capabilities in\nsupport of ICS-CERT’s incident response, assessment, and\nvulnerability coordination activities.The AAL’s expert\ncybersecurity researchers perform forensic analysis on\ndigital media, reverse engineer malware, and respond to\ncyber incidents with both onsite and remote capacity.When\npossible, the AAL performs analytical efforts remotely in a\nlaboratory environment using custom tools and techniques.\nIn some cases, however, onsite analysis is required, and a\nteam deploys to perform analytical efforts directly on the\nowner’s network.\n\n\n_DHS NPPD Under Secretary Suzanne Spaulding presents ICS-CERT’s_\n_AAL team with a DHS NPPD appreciation award._\n\n\nIn FY 2016, the AAL performed in-depth analysis on 100\nmalware samples.This work helped ICS-CERT to publish\nmultiple alerts warning the ICS community of the threats\ninvolved and provided information for detecting and\nmitigating intrusion activity.\n\nThe AAL continues to host summer interns looking for\nadvanced exposure to ICS security work.This year, the AAL\nhosted an intern from the University of Nebraska at Omaha\nat its facilities on the Idaho National Laboratory campus in\nIdaho Falls, Idaho, providing experience with our malware\nanalysis and artifact analysis processes.This intern was\nalso able to participate in a review of Structured Threat\nInformation Expression (STIX) modernization efforts and a\nproject to scope an ICS hardware laboratory.\n\n\n_DHS NPPD Under Secretary Suzanne Spaulding presents ICS-CERT’s_\n_AAL team with a DHS NPPD appreciation award._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Sandia National Laboratory Air Force Institute of Technology\nSandia National Laboratory (SNL) performs year- ICS-CERT’s relationship with the Air Force Institute of Technology\nround research work and develops prototype tools on (AFIT) is in its sixth year and continues to expand.

ICS-CERT bases its\nassessments on standards, guidelines, and best practices\nand provides them to CI asset owners and operators at\nno cost using our Congressional funding.The assessment\nmethodology provides a structured framework that asset\nowners and operators can use to assess, re-assess, protect,\ndetect, and continually validate the cybersecurity of their\nICS networks.The information gained from assessments also\nprovides stakeholders with the understanding and context\nnecessary to build effective defense-in-depth processes for\nenhancing their cybersecurity posture.\n\nICS-CERT’s private sector Assessment team works with asset\nowners to determine which set of assessment services best\nfits the needs of that particular organization.The services\nprovided may include a combination of a facilitated CSET,\nDAR, and/or NAVV assessment, depending on the current\nstate and goals of the organization.The services provided\nby the private sector Assessment team are transitioning\nfrom individual CSET, DAR, and NAVV assessments to an\nintegrated process including all the assessment offerings\nalong with more advanced analytics to provide improved\nactionable feedback to asset owners.The assessment process\nincludes a baseline assessment using CSET, a deep-dive\ndesign architecture review of the ICS, communications, and\nnetworking architecture, and analysis of the network data\ncommunications. Moving forward, the ICS-CERT Assessment\nteam is working to include log analysis to the overall\nassessment services in FY 2017.\n\nThis integrated assessment approach has been evolving in\nFY 2016 and has notably found abnormal network traffic\nthat indicated a potential system breach during several\nassessments. On such occasions, the ICS-CERT Assessment\nteam handed the asset owner over to the ICS-CERT\nIncident Response team to provide assistance through the\nidentification and mitigation process.\n\n###### Assessments in FY 2016\nIn FY 2016, ICS-CERT conducted 130 cybersecurity\nassessments across 12 of the 16 CI sectors in 19 states,\nWashington D.C., and Guam. Of these 130 assessments, 32\nwere CSET assessments, 55 were DAR assessments, and 43\nwere NAVV assessments.\n\n\nIn addition, ICS-CERT is supporting broader DHS efforts\nby providing assessments for the Regional Resiliency\nAssessment Program (RRAP). RRAP is a cooperative\nassessment of specific CI within a designated geographic\narea and includes a regional analysis of the surrounding\ninfrastructure. In FY 2016, ICS-CERT conducted 16\ncybersecurity assessments with Infrastructure Protection\n(IP) in coordination with RRAP.\n\nICS-CERT is also working to develop the FY 2016 NCCIC/\nICS-CERT Annual Assessment report, which will provide a\nyear-end summary of ICS-CERT’s private sector assessment\nactivities to include FY 2016 assessment findings and\nobservations, as well as highlighting cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities and risk mitigation. ICS-CERT will post this\nreport to its web site once completed.\n\n###### Federal Facility Control Systems Security Program\n\nNew to FY 2016 is the Federal Facility Control Systems\nSecurity Program (FFCSSP), a joint effort by ICS-CERT,\nFederal Protective Services (FPS), and General Services\nAdministration (GSA), to assess control systems\n(building automation) used by government-owned and\nleased facilities and occupied by Federal employees for\nnon-military activities.The Facility Security Level (FSL)\nof each facility’s Facility Security Committees (FSC) will\ndetermine the prioritization of these assessments. Facilities\nwith a security level of 3, 4, or 5 are considered high-risk\nfacilities and will be ICS-CERT’s top priorities at the onset\nof execution and in sustainment of all risk assessment\nactivities.\n\nThe FFCSSP will conduct assessments in Tiers (I, II, and\nIII), and ICS-CERT will be primarily responsible for\ncybersecurity assessments (Tier III). FPS will be responsible\nfor physical security technology assessments (Tiers I and\nII) and GSA for the overall responsibility for supporting\nassessments and applying countermeasures.These\nassessments involve a comprehensive review of systems and\nnetwork architectures and encompass topology verification,\noperational processes, communication protocols, evaluation\nof security controls, and other areas related to the control\nsystem.These assessments also offer detailed mitigation\nplans and recommendations; FFCSSP will perform them\non the most complex and critical facilities in the portfolio.\nLastly, the assessments will provide Federal tenants and\nowner-operators with technical knowledge of their systems\nand include plans to address security issues as well as\nprovide countermeasures and facility risk factors.\n\n\n-----\n\nCSET is a self-contained software tool that runs on a desktop\nor laptop computer. CSET provides a systematic, disciplined,\nand repeatable approach for evaluating an organization’s\nsecurity posture. It does not require connection to the\nInternet or to any control system or corporate network.\nCSET guides asset owners and operators through a step-by­\nstep process to evaluate ICS and information technology\n(IT) network security practices. CSET’s developers designed\nit to focus user time in the areas that are most effective\nfor conducting a self-assessment.The application contains\na feature-rich network diagramming capability, provides\na comprehensive analysis of the network’s adherence to\nindustry recognized cybersecurity standards, and produces\nexecutive level, summary, and detailed reports.\n\nICS-CERT released CSET Version 7.1 in February 2016.This\nrelease included:\n\n**• NIST SP800-161—Supply Chain Risk Management**\nPractices for Federal Information Systems and\nOrganizations.
