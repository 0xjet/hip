We have decided to disclose several new Indicators of\nCompromise (IOCs) related to “Sphinx Moth” group with a view to furthering a collective\nunderstanding of the attack methods, tools and targets, and helping enterprises detect and\neliminate any intrusion into their networks.\n\nAttacks like “Sphinx Moth” are increasing. Yet despite their prevalence and our awareness\nabout their impact, strategies to address the risk of cyberattacks remain inadequate. It is no\nlonger possible to work on the assumption that we can fully protect a corporate network. With\nthe rise of advanced persistent threats, enterprises can have an intruder in their network for\nmonths or years, without even being aware of its presence.\n\n**Key findings**\n\nOur report contains the analysis of 5 new binaries, and provides 5 new command and control\nserver IP addresses, 2 new Command and Control domains, 6 new YARA rules, 1 new tactic\nto regain access and a Powershell script to detect the named pipes IOC on an SCCM\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n[It s available on the Kudelski Security website: Sphinx Moth Report](https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/newsroom/press_releases_and_publications/Sphinx_Moth_Report.html)\n\n\n-----",
