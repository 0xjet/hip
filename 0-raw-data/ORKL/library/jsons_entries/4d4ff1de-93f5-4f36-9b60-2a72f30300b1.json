[US-CERT describes Emotet as “an advanced, modular banking trojan that](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A)\nprimarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking trojans”.\n\nHowever, WSG’s confirmation that Emotet was used to push ransomware onto its network\ncomes just two months after security firms [CrowdStrike and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/) [Kryptos Logic separately](https://blog.kryptoslogic.com/malware/2019/01/10/dprk-emotet.html)\nconfirmed that the trojan had been implicated in Ryuk ransomware attacks.\n\nIn its [2019 State of Malware report, Malwarebytes said it expected to see Emotet/Trickbot](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/business-malware-detections-on-the-rise-report-indicates)\ncombo malware impacting not just the banking, but also the education, government,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare sectors throughout the year.\n\n“Originally a banking trojan, Emotet has evolved over the years to become a loader as a\nservice, although mostly keeping up with banking and stealer families as well,” explains\nJérôme Segura, head of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes.\n\n“There were some noteworthy attacks where Emotet was found to be at the root cause of\nransomware infections, in particular by working with Trickbot actors.\n\n\"Malware distributors willing to deliver their payload are always looking for the best ways to\ndo so. Emotet campaigns have a wide reach with daily onslaught of maliciously crafted\ndocuments using social engineering to deliver the malware.\n\n“For this reason, partnerships with Emotet and its wide botnet are a great way to achieve this\nmalware delivery goal.”\n\nWhen it comes to protecting against Emotet-based attacks, Segura said: “The risk is greater\nfor businesses than consumers, but there are many steps that can be taken to mitigate it.\n\n“System administrators can disable Office macros and harden endpoint security. Since social\nengineering plays a big part in the majority of these campaigns, training staff on recognizing\nmalicious emails is also a big step towards protecting an organization.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Daily Swig asked WSG for further details relating to the ransomware strain that\nimpacted its systems, via Emotet, thus far without any further information.\n\nRegardless of the particular strain of ransomware that was involved in this latest attack,\nEnglish confirmed the company did eventually submit to the attackers’ demands.\n\n“Ultimately, a ransom was paid,” he said.\n\nRELATED [AccuDoc data incident highlights ‘growing calamity’ of third-party breaches](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/accudoc-data-incident-highlights-growing-calamity-of-third-party-breaches)\n\nJames Walker\n[James Walker](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/by/james-walker)\n\n[@jameswalk_er](https://twitter.com/jameswalk_er)\n\n\n-----",
