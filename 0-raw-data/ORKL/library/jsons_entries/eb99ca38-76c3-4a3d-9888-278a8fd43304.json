This data is provided in order_\n_to help cyber security professionals and system administrators to guard against the persistent malicious_\n\nFLASH Number\n\n_actions of cyber actors. This FLASH was coordinated with DHS/CISA._\n\n#### CU-000167-MW This FLASH has been released TLP:WHITE\n\n\n**WE NEED YOUR HELP!** If you identify any suspicious activity within your enterprise or have related information,\n\n###### please contact your local FBI Cyber Squad immediately with respect to the procedures outlined in the\n Reporting Notice section of this message.\n\n*Note: By reporting any related information to FBI Cyber Squads, you are assisting in sharing information that allows the FBI to track\n\n_malicious actors and coordinate with private industry and the United States Government to prevent future intrusions and attacks._\n\n# BlackCat/ALPHV Ransomware Indicators of Compromise\n\n## Summary\n\nThis FLASH is part of a series of FBI reports to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with ransomware variants identified through FBI\ninvestigations. As of March 2022, BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware as a service (RaaS) had compromised at\nleast 60 entities worldwide and is the first ransomware group to do so successfully using RUST,\nconsidered to be a more secure programming language that offers improved performance and reliable\nconcurrent processing. BlackCat-affiliated threat actors typically request ransom payments of several\nmillion dollars in Bitcoin and Monero but have accepted ransom payments below the initial ransom\ndemand amount. Many of the developers and money launderers for BlackCat/ALPHV are linked to\nDarkside/Blackmatter, indicating they have extensive networks and experience with ransomware\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Details\n\n\nBlackCat/ALPHV ransomware leverages previously compromised user credentials to gain initial access to\nthe victim system. Once the malware establishes access, it compromises Active Directory user and\nadministrator accounts. The malware uses Windows Task Scheduler to configure malicious Group Policy\nObjects (GPOs) to deploy ransomware. Initial deployment of the malware leverages PowerShell scripts,\nin conjunction with Cobalt Strike, and disables security features within the victim’s network.\nBlackCat/ALPHV ransomware also leverages Windows administrative tools and Microsoft Sysinternals\ntools during compromise.\n\nBlackCat/ALPHV steals victim data prior to the execution of the ransomware, including from cloud\nproviders where company or client data was stored.\n\nThe actors leverage Windows scripting to deploy ransomware and to compromise additional hosts. For\nexample, the following batch and PowerShell scripts were observed:\n\n  - `start.bat - launches the ransomware executable with required arguments`\n\n  - `est.bat - copies the ransomware to other locations`\n\n  - `drag-and-drop-target.bat - launches the ransomware executable for the MySQL Server`\n\n  - `run.bat - executes a callout command to an external server using SSH - file names may change`\ndepending on the company and systems affected\n\n  - `Runs1.ps1 – PowerShell script to disable McAfee`\n\n## Indicators\n\nThe following are characteristics of compromise by BlackCat/ALPHV, as of mid-February 2022:\n\n**PowerShell Scripts**\n**Filename** **MD5 Hash**\namd - Copy.ps1 861738dd15eb7fb50568f0e39a69e107\nipscan.ps1 9f60dd752e7692a2f5c758de4eab3e6f\nRun1.ps1 09bc47d7bc5e40d40d9729cec5e39d73\n**Additional PowerShell Filenames**\n\n[###].ps1 CME.ps1\n\n[#].ps1 Run1.ps1\nmim.ps1 [##].ps1\npsexec.ps1 Systems.ps1\nSystem.ps1\n\n\n-----\n\n**Batch Scripts**\n**Filename** **MD5 Hash**\nCheckVuln.bat f5ef5142f044b94ac5010fd883c09aa7\nCreate-share-RunAsAdmin.bat 84e3b5fe3863d25bb72e25b10760e861\nLPE-Exploit-RunAsUser.bat 9f2309285e8a8471fce7330fcade8619\nRCE-Exploit-RunAsUser.bat 6c6c46bdac6713c94debbd454d34efd9\nest.bat e7ee8ea6fb7530d1d904cdb2d9745899\nrunav.bat 815bb1b0c5f0f35f064c55a1b640fca5\n\n**Executables and DLLs**\n**Filename** **MD5 Hash**\nhttp_x64.exe 6c2874169fdfb30846fe7ffe34635bdb\nspider.dll 20855475d20d252dda21287264a6d860\nspider_32.dll 82db4c04f5dcda3bfcd75357adf98228\npowershell.dll fcf3a6eeb9f836315954dae03459716d\nrpcdump.exe 91625f7f5d590534949ebe08cc728380\n**Filename** **SHA1 Hash**\nmimikatz.exe d241df7b9d2ec0b8194751cd5ce153e27cc40fa4\nrun.exe 4831c1b113df21360ef68c450b5fca278d08fae2\nzakrep_plink.exe fce13da5592e9e120777d82d27e06ed2b44918cf\nbeacon.exe 3f85f03d33b9fe25bcfac611182da4ab7f06a442\nwin1999.exe 37178dfaccbc371a04133d26a55127cf4d4382f8\n\n_[compromised company].exe_ 1b2a30776df64fbd7299bd588e21573891dcecbe\n**Additional Observed Filenames**\ntest.exe xxx.exe\nMim.exe xxxw.exe\ncrackmapexec.exe Services.exe\nplink.exe Systems.exe\nPsExec64.exe\n\n**BlackCat Ransomware SHA256 Hashes:**\n731adcf2d7fb61a8335e23dbee2436249e5d5753977ec465754c6b699e9bf161\nf837f1cd60e9941aa60f7be50a8f2aaaac380f560db8ee001408f35c1b7a97cb\n731adcf2d7fb61a8335e23dbee2436249e5d5753977ec465754c6b699e9bf161\n80dd44226f60ba5403745ba9d18490eb8ca12dbc9be0a317dd2b692ec041da28\n\n**C2 IPs:**\n89.44.9.243 142.234.157.246 45.134.20.66 185.220.102.253\n37.120.238.58 152.89.247.207 198.144.121.93 89.163.252.230\n45.153.160.140 23.106.223.97 139.60.161.161 146.0.77.15\n94.232.41.155\n\n|Batch Scripts|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Filename MD5 Hash||\n|CheckVuln.bat f5ef5142f044b94ac5010fd883c09aa7||\n|Create-share-RunAsAdmin.bat 84e3b5fe3863d25bb72e25b10760e861||\n|LPE-Exploit-RunAsUser.bat 9f2309285e8a8471fce7330fcade8619||\n|RCE-Exploit-RunAsUser.bat 6c6c46bdac6713c94debbd454d34efd9||\n|est.bat e7ee8ea6fb7530d1d904cdb2d9745899||\n|runav.bat|815bb1b0c5f0f35f064c55a1b640fca5|\n\n|C2 IPs:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|89.44.9.243 142.234.157.246 45.134.20.66 185.220.102.253||\n|37.120.238.58 152.89.247.207 198.144.121.93 89.163.252.230||\n|45.153.160.140 23.106.223.97 139.60.161.161 146.0.77.15||\n|94.232.41.155||\n\n\n-----\n\n## Information Requested:\n\nThe FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include IP logs showing callbacks from foreign\nIP addresses, Bitcoin or Monero addresses and transaction IDs, communications with the threat actors,\nthe decryptor file, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.\n\n## Recommended Mitigations:\n\nThe FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may\nalso embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage\nin the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, the FBI understands that when\nvictims are faced with an inability to function, all options are evaluated to protect shareholders,\nemployees and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the\nransom, the FBI urges you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing\nso provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking\nransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law.\n\n  - Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or\nunrecognized user accounts.\n\n  - Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of\ncritical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data\nresides.\n\n  - Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review\noperating system defined or recognized scheduled tasks for unrecognized “actions” (for\nexample: review the steps each scheduled task is expected to perform).\n\n  - Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.\n\n  - Implement network segmentation.\n\n  - Require administrator credentials to install software.\n\n  - Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary\ndata and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage\ndevice, the cloud).\n\n  - Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches\nare released.\n\n  - Use multifactor authentication where possible.\n\n  - Regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts, and avoid reusing passwords for\ndifferent accounts.\n\n  - Implement the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.\n\n  - Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote\naccess/RDP logs.\n\n  - Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least\nprivilege in mind.\n\n  - Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a\nvirtual private network (VPN).\n\n  - Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\n\n  - Disable hyperlinks in received emails.\n\n## Reporting Notice\n\n###### The FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local FBI field office.
