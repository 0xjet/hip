Such uncertainty and fear surrounding the virus and its impact represents a golden opportunity for threat actors to exploit the situation. By using social engineering tactics such as spam and spear phishing campaigns with COVID-19 as a lure, cybercriminals and threat actors increase the likelihood of successful attack.\n\n\nFrom late January on, several cybercriminal and statesponsored groups have been doing just that, using\ncoronavirus-themed phishing emails as their infection\nvector to gain a foothold on victim machines. Just\nlike the coronavirus itself, China was the first target of\nAdvanced Persistent Threat ( APT) groups, and as the\nvirus spread worldwide, so did the cyberattacks.\n\nOnce their victims’ attention was captured by social\nengineering, threat actors used various techniques\nto deploy malware, such as embedding macros in\nMicrosoft documents attached to phishing emails or\nexploiting system or browser vulnerabilities to drop\nmalicious software.\n\n\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of several different\nAPT groups using coronavirus as a lure, as well as a\ndescription of their varied attack vectors. We categorize\nthe APT groups according to the technique they used\nto send spam or phishing emails: Template injection,\nMalicious macros, RTF exploits, and malicious LNK files.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Template injection\n\n##### Template injection refers to a technique in which threat actors embed a script moniker in the lure document—usually a Microsoft Office document—that contains a link to a malicious Office template via an XML setting. Upon opening the document, the remote template is dropped  and executed. Kimsuky and Gamaredon are examples of APTs using template injection.\n\n Kimsuky\n\nKimsuky (also known as Velvet Chollima) is a NorthKorean threat actor group that has been active since\n2013 and is known to be behind the KHNP (Korea Hydro\n& Nuclear Power) cyber terrorism attacks of 2014[1]. The\ngroup mainly targets Korean think tanks, DPRK/nuclearrelated targets, and several US firms with the main\ngoal of delivering malicious payloads to its targets and\nstealing web application accounts.\n\nStarting in early March 2020, Kimsuky began using\nspear phishing emails with COVID-19 in the subject\nline as its initial infection vector. The emails contain\nmalicious documents weaponized with CVE-2017-0199[2].\nThis vulnerability allows remote code execution by\nexploiting a flaw in the Microsoft Office OLE interface to\ndeliver malware.\n\nFigure 2: Malcious document after enabling content\n\nUpon opening the document, a prompt asks victims\nto “enable content” to show information about the\ncoronavirus. After enabaling the content, a script moniker “in\nword/_rels/setting[.]xml[.]rels” is triggered and drops a\nMicrosoft document template called web.dotm from the\nfollowing url:\n\n**http://crphone[.]mireene[.]com/plugin/editor/**\n**Templetes/normal.php?name=web**\n\nFigure 3: setting.xml.rels content\n\nFigure 1: Malicious document used as a lure\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “web.dotm” has an embedded macro which is designed to target Mac users (Figure 4). This macro also runs\non Windows OS, however, it only executes its main malicious functionality on a Mac. There is an “If statement” that\nchecks the operating system and executes a remote Python script called “Secured.APP”.\n\nFigure 4: Malicious macro embedded in web.dotm\n\nFigure 5 shows the content of “Secured.APP”, which executes the second stage Python script. Based on the\ndirectory information provided in this script, it seems it is targeting users with Microsoft Office version 2016\nor earlier.\n\nFigure 5: Secured.APP\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second payload, as depicted in Figure 7, is spyware\nthat collects information by running several commands\nand sending the collected data to its C&C server. The\nmain function is “SpyLoop”, which collects and sends\ndevice/user information in an infinite while loop.\n\nThe list of collected information, stored in separate files\n(Figure 6), is as follows:\n\n- Architecture info\n\n- System info\n\n   - Apple Pay\n\n   - Audio\n\n   - Bluetooth\n\n   - Camera\n\n   - External network info\n\n   - Firewall\n\n   - Hardware info\n\n   - Language and region\n\n- List of running processes\n\n- List of installed Applications\n\n- List of files in Documents/Downloads/Desktop\ndirectory\n\n- List of volumes\n\n- List of users\n\nFigure 6: Content of collected information\n\nThe directory is then compressed with a password\n(“doxujoijcs0qei09213@#$@”) and uploaded as a zip file\nin an http request as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Second Python script\n\nThe next function in the loop is “ExecNewCommand”, which is likely used to download additional content. It then\nsleeps for five minutes and repeats the same process. At time of writing, it only responded with a “200 OK”.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Gamaredon\n\nGamaredon is a Russian APT that primarily performs cyber espionage operations against Ukrainian military forces,\nas well as individuals related to the Ukrainian government. Gamaredon has been active since 2013 and often uses\nspear phishing as its initial infection vector.\n\nBetween March 23 and 25, Gamaredon sent phishing emails using the COVID-19 theme and employed remote\ntemplate injection within their lure, a Microsoft Word document written in Russian. (Figure 8).\n\nUpon opening the document, a remote template is\ndropped from the link provided in the XML setting\n(Figure 9).\n\nWe were not able to retrieve this template at time of\npublishing, but found other similar templates used by\nthis APT days before this campaign and realized they\nare using similar malicious macros. Figure 10 shows an\nexample of such a macro.\n\nInstead of executing the malicious behavior upon\nopening the document (using the “auto_open” function),\nthe malicious macro in this document is executed in\nthe “Document_close” function. This could be to bypass\ndynamic analysis if the document is not closed before\nthe sandbox times out.\n\nThe macro collects the computer name, home drive’s\nlabel/serial number, and BIOS information (using WMI)\nand sends it to a hardcoded C2 server with this format:\n\n\n**http://Server/ComputerName_DriveSerialNumber/**\n**BiosVersionInfo**\n\nFigure 9: Template injection\n\n\nFigure 8: Lure document\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then creates a VBS script in the %APPDATA% directory and makes it persistent by copying it into the startup\ndirectory. In addition to the mentioned items, the script also collects keyboard layout and country code and checks\nwhether Process explorer or Wireshark are running on the system.\n\nFigure 10: Macro embedded in template\n\nThe APT group then drops its custom backdoor “Pterodo” that is capable of downloading other malware variants\nand collecting sensitive information[3].\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious Macros\n\n##### Embedding malicious macros is the most popular method of infection used by APTs. In this attack vector, a macro is embedded in the lure document that will be activated upon its opening. In the following sections, we look at APTs using this method in their COVID-19 lure.\n\n Kimsuky\n\nIn the previous section, we mentioned that Kimsuky is\nusing template injection to infect Mac users. We also\nobserved this actor using COVID-19-themed malicious\nmacros to target Windows users mostly in South Korea[4].\n(Figure 11):\n\nFigure 11: Malicious document targeting Windows users\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious macro is obfuscated, as shown in Figure 12:\n\nFigure 12: Malicious obfuscated macro\n\nAfter de-obfuscating the script, we can see the value stored in the content variable as:\n\nThis uses “mshta” to execute a malicious search.hta file from its server. The content variable is then executed by\nWscript. The “Search.hta” contains a script that downloads another script. The downloaded script is spyware that\ncollects sensitive information, such as IP addresses, usernames, list of processes, RDP information, and Outlook\ninformation and sends it back to the server.\n\n##### Konni (APT37)\n\n\nKonni is a North Korean APT that has been active since\n2012 and is known to target South Korean organizations\nin the chemicals, electronics, manufacturing,\naerospace, automotive, and healthcare industries. In\n2017, the group expanded its operations, targeting\norganizations in several other countries, such as the US,\nJapan, Vietnam, Russia, Nepal, China, India, Romania,\nKuwait, and countries in the Middle East. Recently,\nresearchers found several communalities between this\nAPT and Kimsuky, showing there is a close tie between\nthese two groups[5].\n\nKonni is known to use spear phishing emails, strategic\nweb compromises, and torrent file-sharing sites to\ncompromise its victims. In mid-March, they began\nsending spear phishes with COVID-19 warnings,\nironically advising readers to watch out for North Korean\ncybercrime spikes related to the spread of the virus.\n\n\nFigure 13 shows the lure document, named “Keep an\neye on North Korean cyber.doc”:\n\nFigure 13: Lure document\n\n\n-----\n\nThe embedded macro in this document includes an encrypted executable code that is XOR decoded and stored\nin the “C\\Users\\UserName\\” directory (Figure 14). The dropped executable is a downloader for their popular Konni\nRemote Access Trojan (RAT) downloaded from[6]:\n\n**http://phpview[.]mygamesonline[.]org/3.dat**\n\nFigure 14: Embedded macro\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APT36\n\nAPT36 is another threat group that has employed macro-embedded COVID-19 themes in their recent campaigns.\nThe group is believed to be Pakistani state-sponsored, mainly targeting the defense, embassies, and government\nof India.[7] Their coronavirus attacks began on March 12 and included phishing emails with attached malicious\ndocuments, which dropped Crimson RAT payloads on victim machines.\n\n##### Patchwork\n\nPatchwork, also known as Dropping Elephant, Chinastrats, APT-C-09, and Quilted Tiger, is an Indian threat actor\nthat has been active since 2013. The primary targets of this APT are organizations related to diplomatic and\ngovernment agencies in China, Japan, the Middle East, the UK, the US, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.\nPatchwork mainly uses spear phishing methods to gain access to victims’ machines.\n\nIn early February, Patchwork began sending phishing emails with a COVID-19 theme, using malicious Excel\ndocuments to target Chinese organizations (Figure 15).\n\nFigure 15: Lure document\n\n\n-----\n\nThe embedded macro (Figure 17) is simple: It downloads a script from the URL embedded as a formula in column\n“X”, row “100”. (Figure 16).\n\nFigure 16: Url embedded in the cell\n\nFigure 17: Macro\n\nThe downloaded Scriptlet “window.scr” (Figure 18) is responsible for dropping and executing another payload,\nwhich is a custom backdoor developed by the actor.\n\nFigure 18 window.scr\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Hades\n\nHades is the APT group behind the attack against the\nPyeongchang Winter Olympics. Evidence suggests\nthat this group is connected to the well-known Russian\nthreat actor APT28[8].\n\nIn their recent campaign called Tricky Mouse, Hades\ntargeted Ukrainian users using COVID-19 lures[9, 10].\nThe attack started by sending a macro-embedded\ndocument to victims (Figure 19).\n\nThe embedded macro (Figure 20) decodes and drops a\nRAT executable into the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 20: Embedded macro\n\n\nFigure 19: Hades lure document\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RAT is dropped in the local user directory as “conhost.exe”. That RAT is a .NET executable obfuscated by\n“Eazfuscator.net” (Figure 21):\n\nFigure 21: Hades RAT\n\nAfter de-obfuscation. we saw that the RAT had several functionalities, such as collecting system and user\ninformation, taking screenshots, and logging keystrokes.\n\nThe “Kdaapk” module is responsible for performing C&C communications. The C&C URL is hardcoded within this\nmodule as you can see in Figure 22:\n\nFigure 22: Hades RAT after deobfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\n##### TA505\n\nTA505 is an APT group that started its activity by\ndistributing the Dridex banking Trojan on mass scale\nin 2014[11]. The group is considered unique, as it’s a\nfinancially-motivated team of threat actors that uses a\nwide variety of malware families.\n\nStarting on March 9th, TA505 used malicious macros\nin their COVID-19 themed documents, which included\nMicrosoft Excel spreadsheets. Figure 23 show such a\ndocument after enabling its content:\n\nFigure 23: Lure document\n\n\nAs you can see in Figure 24, upon opening the\ndocument, a progress bar dialog box pops up\n(UserForm1_show). The dialog box is used to confuse the\nuser while the main malicious functionality is located in\nthe popped-up dialog box activate function (Figure 25).\n\nFigure 24: Embedded macro\n\n\n-----\n\nActivate()” function is executed, which calls\n“Nlgebredneh()” function:\n\nFigure 25: Trigger function of the dialog box\n\nThe “Nlgebredneh()” function drops “paper.xls” in the\n“%APPDATA%” temp directory and extracts “oleobject1.\nbin” from “paper.xls”. In the next step, it decrypts the\ncontent of “oleobject1.bin” into “reinforce.dll” in the\n“%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Templates” directory.\nFinally, it executes the DLL file.\n\nFigure 26: The “Nlgebredneh” function\n\nThe DLL file is a small downloader that decrypts the next\npayload into memory. The downloader drops additional\nmalware families associated with TA505, such as\nbanking Trojans and RATs.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### TA542\n\nTA542 (Mummy Spider) is a Russian-speaking threat\nactor group behind the distribution of Emotet, which\nwas first seen in the wild in 2014[12]. At first, TA542 used\nmodules from the Feodo banking Trojan, but over time\ndeveloped their malware with modular architecture\nadding new capabilities.\n\nSince the emergence of COVID-19, TA542 has started\nusing coronavirus themes in various email distribution\ncampaigns. Malicious documents distributed by the\nactor have embedded macros that act as a downloader\nfor Emotet malware[13].\n\n##### Bitter\n\nBitter is suspected to be a south Asian APT group\ntargeting Pakistan and China since 2015[14]. According\nto other security researchers, this group has also used\nCOVID-19 themes to target China[15]. Macro-embedded\ndocuments distributed by this group download and\ndrop a variant of its custom RAT that has been written\nin .Net. Unfortunately, we were not able to retrieve any\nsample related to this campaign.\n\n\n##### Ocean Lotus\n\nAPT32 (Ocean lotus, Sea Lotus) is a Vietnamese APT that\nhas been active since 2014.\n\nThe group has targeted private sectors as well as\ngovernments and journalists from Australia, Brunei,\nCambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,\nMyanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US,\nand Vietnam. Ocean Lotus has used strategic web\ncompromises and spear phishing to gain foothold into\nvictims’ machines[16].\n\nOcean Lotus also used malicious macro-embedded\ndocuments with COVID-19 themes to target China,\nstarting February 19. In this attack, the malicious\ndocument dropped the “Denis” Trojan, a malware family\nthat has been developed by this group[17].\n\n\n-----\n\n#### RTF exploit\n\n##### RTF is a flexible text format that was introduced by Microsoft a long time ago. The flexibility of embedding any object type within makes RTF files vulnerable to many OLE objects related vulnerabilities. Several threat actors, especially Chinese ones, use RTF files in their campaigns. Among them are the Calypso group and Winnti threat actors who have used RTF files in their COVID-19 campaigns.\n\n Calypso Group\n\n\nCalypso is a Chinese APT group that has been\nperforming cyber espionage operations since 2016[18, 19].\nThe group has targeted governments in Brazil, India,\nKazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, Belarus, Mongolia, and\nTurkey.\n\nIn the new campaign, called Vicious Panada, Calypso\nGroup has targeted the Mongolian public sector by\nsending malicious RTF files to victims disguised as\nCOVID-19 related documents[20].\n\nThe RTF file has been weaponized with the Royal Road\nRTF weaponization tool. The tool is known to be used by\nseveral Chinese actors and has the capability to embed\nobjects within RTF files that exploit vulnerabilities\nrelated to Microsoft Equation Editor. (CVE-2017-11882,\nCVE-2018-0798, CVE-2018-0802)[21].\n\n\nIn this campaign, the RTF file exploits the equation\neditor vulnerability to drop “intel.wll” into the “AppData/\nRoaming/Microsoft/Word/STARTUP/” directory (Figure\n27). “intel.wll” is then executed each time the Microsoft\nWord application is launched. This DLL downloads\nadditional payloads, including a backdoor with several\ncapabilities, such as taking screen shots, executing new\nprocesses, or collecting system information.\n\nFigure 28: RTF file embedding k.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at the Equation Native Stream, we can see that\nthis DLL is made persistent by using the run registry key\n“Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” (Figure 29).\nIn this case, “k.dll” is executed each time the system\nreboots.\n\nFigure 29: Equation native stream\n\nA code similarity check between “k.dll” and “intel.wll”\nshowed that both have similar functionalities and the\nsame exported function named “Engdic”.\n\n##### Chinese actor (Winnti)\n\nAnother Chinese threat actor that used the Royal Road\nweaponization framework with a COVID-19 theme\nrecently dropped a backdoor variant named Chinoxy by\nexploiting the equation editor vulnerability[22, 23]. Some\nevidence suggests that Winnti is the actor behind this\ncampaign, but we cannot confirm it[22, 24, 25].\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malicious LNK files\n\n##### LNK files are shortcut files used by Microsoft Windows. They are considered a Shell item type that can be executed. From 2013 on, attackers have used malicious LNK files to infect their victims. A few APTs started using malicious LNK with COVID-19 themes from late February to mid-March to ensnare victims.\n\n Mustang Panada\n\nMustang Panda is a Chinese threat actor that has\ntargeted NGOs (non-government organizations) since\n2017. The group’s main targets are US think tanks and\nNGO organizations in Mongolia. Mustang Panda uses\nspear phishing emails to initiate its attacks and usually\ndrops either Poison Ivy or the PlugX RAT[26, 27].\n\nIn their COVID-19 phishing campaign, Mustang Panda\nsent an LNK file containing a malicious HTA application,\nwhich contained a VB script (Figure 30).\n\nFigure 30: HTA file\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the properties of this LNK file, there is a command that will be executed when the file is opened (Figure 31).\n\nFigure 31: Command\n\nThe command calls “mshta.exe” to execute the HTA application that drops and runs a payload. The payload has a\nresource that is dropped in the victim’s machine. The final payload in this campaign is either a variant of PlugX RAT\nor Cobalt Strike.\n\n##### Higaisia\n\nAnomali has reported another threat group called Higaisia using malicious LNK files to perform malicious\noperations using COVID-19 themes. The actor sends an LNK file disguised as a PDF via spam campaigns. After\nopening the LNK file, an actual PDF file is opened[28].\n\nIt is assumed that the group behind this campaign is a North Korean actor targeting English speaking people/\norganizations[28].\n\nOpening the LNK file leads to execution of the command embedded in the property section (Figure 32). The\ncommand decodes an embedded base64 payload and drops it into the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 32: Command\n\nThe dropped payload is a cabinet file that contains multiple files. The content of the cabinet file is extracted using\nthe legitimate Windows executable “extract.exe”. From there, multiple stages are executed and finally, a variant of\nthe PlugX RAT is dropped.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n##### In this report, we provided an overview of various APT groups using the COVID-19 pandemic as a theme in several different types of malicious campaigns to increase the odds of their attacks’ success. This shows that threat actors are closely monitoring public events happening around the world, and quickly employing those themes in attack vectors to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nWe expect that in the coming weeks and months, APT threat actors will continue to leverage this crisis to craft\nphishing campaigns using social engineering techniques and other malicious tactics embedded into lure\ndocuments to compromise their targets.\n\nThe Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team is monitoring the threat landscape and paying particular attention\nto attacks trying to abuse the public’s fear of the COVID-19 crisis.
