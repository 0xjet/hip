In that blog we highlighted the Kill Zeus feature, which had just been added\nto the SpyEye Trojan builder at that time. We can now substantiate that this Kill Zeus\nfeature does actually work. Well, some of the time. In my opinion the Zeus toolkit creators\ndon’t need to lose any of their precious sleep just yet.\n\nOur analysis has shown that the kill Zeus feature seems to work on a limited number of\nZeus samples. In March 2010, Symantec alone counted 9,779 new unique samples of\n[what we call Trojan.Zbot. We estimate that only a small percentage of these samples can](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-011016-3514-99)\nbe successfully removed by SpyEye’s Kill Zeus feature. The samples we observed it\nworking successfully on are most likely created with one version of the Zeus Trojan builder,\nof which there are now several. To soften the blow even more, the version of the Zeus\nTrojan builder that the feature works on seems to be an earlier one, now widely available\nfor free. The SpyEye creator most likely got a hold of a copy of this Zeus builder and\nbased his detection and remediation on backwards-engineering the samples it created. If\nanything, this Kill Zeus feature might actually convince Zeus builder users to upgrade to a\npaid version.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following video shows what happens when a computer compromised by Trojan.Zbot is\n[subsequently infected with Trojan.Spyeye, using the Kill Zeus feature (when it works](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-020216-0135-99)\ncorrectly).\n\nNew revisions of both the Zeus and SpyEye crimeware toolkits are being released on a\nregular basis, with additional features or protection added. As always, Symantec\nrecommends that you keep your definitions up to date in order to ensure protection against\nthese threats and others.\n\nThanks to Cathal Mullaney for his input on this blog entry.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
