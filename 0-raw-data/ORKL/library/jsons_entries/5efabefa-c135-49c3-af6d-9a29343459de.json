Experts all over the world are working to combat cybercriminals,\nfueling an arms race in which hackers continue to refine their tools. In early\n2019, companies in a wide range of industries suffered from cyberattacks.\n\nSummarizing our findings from the first quarter of 2019, we note the following trends:\n\n� The number of unique cyberincidents continued to grow, exceeding the\nequivalent year-ago period (Q1 2018) by 11 percent.\n\n� Malware combining multiple types of Trojans is becoming more and more\nwidespread. Due to its flexible modular architecture, this malware can perform many different functions. For example, it can display advertising and\nsteal user data at the same time.\n\n� The share of hidden mining keeps decreasing (7% compared to 9% in Q4\n2018). Hackers have started to upgrade miners, turning them into multifunctional Trojans. Once inside a system with low computational power on which\nmining is uneconomical, such Trojans start acting as spyware and steal data.\n\n� Infections by cryptolockers increased from 9 percent of total incidents in\nQ4 2018 to 24 percent in Q1 2019. This malware is often used in combination with phishing, with hackers constantly inventing new ways of deceiving users and making them pay a ransom.\n\n� Healthcare has proved to be a favorite target of cryptolockers. Medical\ninstitutions are more likely to pay a ransom compared to other businesses,\nperhaps because of patients' lives and health being at stake.\n\n� Cyberattacks against government are mainly aimed at data theft, with attackers using custom self-developed spyware, or at hacking government\nwebsites in order to infect users with malware.\n\n� Malware remains a serious threat for large industrial companies. When it\ncomes to such companies, the objective of most attacks is to obtain business secrets. It is possible that ransomware attacks on industry could be\naimed at covering the traces of previous incidents.\n\n� Leaks of millions of user credentials put online services at risk. Attackers\nextensively use publicly available data for credential stuffing attacks.\n\n� Injection attacks with malicious JavaScript code (JS sniffers) steal payment\ncard information and jeopardize the security of users of online stores and\nservices that support online payments.\n\nWe predict growth in the number of attacks in Q2 2019. Malware and social\nengineering will remain the favored tools of attackers.\n\nIt is no secret that cryptocurrency is in high demand by criminals. However,\nmining is becoming increasingly difficult, which is forcing hackers to search for\nalternative ways of obtaining cryptocurrency. As a result, the share of ransomware Trojans will remain high so long as there are people willing to pay a ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Statistics\n\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we saw a growing number of attacks aimed at\nobtaining data. In fact, more than half of attacks were aimed at theft of information. Attackers chase a wide range of data, including personal correspondence and trade secrets. However, the most in-demand information\nremains credentials, personal data, and payment card data.\n\n15% 1% 54%\n\nAccess to information\n\nFinancial profit\n\nHacktivism\n\nCyberwar\n\n30%\n\nFigure 1.

Types of stolen data\n\nThe share of targeted attacks fell from 62 percent in Q4 2018 to 47 percent\nin Q1 2019. This is caused by an increasing number of attacks affecting more\nthan one industry—most often, malware campaigns. The share of incidents\naffecting individuals remained almost the same (21% compared to 22% in Q4\n2018). As for organizations, attackers most often hit government agencies,\nmedical institutions, industrial companies, banks, and other financial firms.\nLater in this report, we will examine these attacks in detail. In addition, Q1\n2019 saw a growing number of attacks against online services. We will also\ntry to explain why hackers are so interested in this particular target.\n\n\n-----\n\n2%\n4%\n4%\n\n\n26% 16% 10%\n\nGovernment\n\nHealthcare\n\nIndustrial companies\n\nFinance\n\nOnline services\n\nScience and education\n\nHospitality and entertainment\n\nIT\n\nRetail\n\nBlockchain\n\nOther\n\nMultiple industries\n4% 6% 6% 6% 6% 10%\n\nFigure 3.

For example, the DanaBot Trojan has remote-control compo-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/02/07/danabot-updated-new-cc-communication/)\nnents, may function as a banking Trojan, and can also steal passwords of a\nnumber of applications.\n\n7% 6% 3% 5% 24%\n\nCryptolockers\n\nSpyware\n\nRATs\n\nDroppers\n\nBanking Trojans\n\nMiners\n\nAdware\n\nMultifunctional malware\n\nOther\n\n9% 14% 16% 16%\n\nFigure 8. Malware types\n\nPhishing remains an effective way of delivering malware. But email is far\nfrom the only channel of malware distribution. For example, users frequently\ndownload files from torrent trackers, on which the risk of malware infection\n[grows exponentially. Under the guise of a movie, attackers distributed mal-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-movie-file-infects-pc-to-steal-cryptocurrency-poison-google-results/)\nware used for spoofing addresses of bitcoin and Ethereum wallets when the\ninformation is copied from the clipboard. Users also often download programs from official app stores. Programs with annoying advertising turn out\nto be the most common source of malware infection.[1, 2] Unfortunately, more\ndangerous malware can also be encountered on these stores, such as the\n[MobSTSPY and Exodus spyware Trojans, as well as the Anubis and Gustuff](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spyware-disguises-as-android-applications-on-google-play/)\nbanking Trojans. The last one is sold on the darknet under the malware-­as-aservice model for $800 per month.\n\n1% 6% 36%\n\n\n### 56%\n\nMost severe\ndamage\n\n#### 21%\n\n 11%\n\n 10%\n\n[1 blog.trendmicro.com/](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/adware-disguised-as-game-tv-remote-control-apps-infect-9-million-google-play-users/)\n[trendlabs-security-intelligence/](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/adware-disguised-as-game-tv-remote-control-apps-infect-9-million-google-play-users/)\n[adware-disguised-as-game-tv-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/adware-disguised-as-game-tv-remote-control-apps-infect-9-million-google-play-users/)\n[remote-control-apps-infect-9-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/adware-disguised-as-game-tv-remote-control-apps-infect-9-million-google-play-users/)\n[million-google-play-users/](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/adware-disguised-as-game-tv-remote-control-apps-infect-9-million-google-play-users/)\n\n[2 research.checkpoint.com/](https://research.checkpoint.com/simbad-a-rogue-adware-campaign-on-google-play/)\n[simbad-a-rogue-adware-](https://research.checkpoint.com/simbad-a-rogue-adware-campaign-on-google-play/)\n[campaign-on-google-play/](https://research.checkpoint.com/simbad-a-rogue-adware-campaign-on-google-play/)\n\n\n2%\n2%\n\n8%\n\n12%\n\n33%\n\n\nEmail\n\nCompromised servers\nand workstations\n\nWebsites\n\nOfficial app stores\n\nFake updates\n\nMessengers and SMSs\n\nSocial networks\n\nOther\n\nFigure 9.

In early 2018, the share of mining\nattacks reached 23 percent, but declined to 9 percent in Q4. In Q1 2019, cryptojacking accounted for only 7 percent of attacks. As mining becomes less\nprofitable, cybercriminals are forced to upgrade miners by extending their\ncapabilities to those of multifunctional Trojans. For example, a new Trojan\n[dubbed CookieMiner not only installs a hidden miner on a victim's computer,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/mac-malware-steals-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cookies/)\nbut also steals credentials and payment card information.\n\nRansomware Trojans, on the contrary, are picking up steam: their share of infections has risen from 9 percent in Q4 2018 to 24 percent in Q1 2019. However,\nattackers are now earning less money from \"traditional\" ransomware. This is\nprobably due to the educational efforts of cybersecurity experts urging users\nnot to pay a ransom for file recovery. Be that as it might, attackers keep in[venting new ways to manipulate users. CryptoMix hackers promised to donate](https://www.coveware.com/blog/cryptomix-ransomware-exploits-cancer-crowdfunding)\n[ransom payments to a children's charity. Another malicious attack hit users](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomware-bundles-paypal-phishing-into-its-ransom-note/)\nwho for whatever reason were not able to pay ransom in bitcoins. A new version of ransomware offers PayPal as a payment option. If users choose to pay\nusing PayPal, they are taken to a fake PayPal page. All credentials and payment information entered on the fake page are then stolen by attackers, who\n[can withdraw money from victims' accounts or sell this data on the darkweb.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/darkweb-2018/)\n\n###### Social engineering\n\nSocial engineering remains a common method of malware distribution. In\nMarch, the Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) detected\na mass email campaign distributing a text document regarding upcoming\npresidential elections in Ukraine. The document contained a macro which\ndecoded a PowerShell Empire script hidden in metadata. The script was\nused to download malware to the victim's computer.\n\nBesides political events, industry conferences also serve as a subject of\nphishing emails sent by attackers. Our experts discovered an invitation for\n[a scientific conference that contained an exploit for vulnerability CVE-2018-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0802)\n[0802 and remote control malware.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0802)\n\n[Another phishing trick is to ask victims to verify their account. Hackers sent](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/how-a-hacking-group-is-stealing-popular-instagram-profiles/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+Anti-MalwareBlog+(Trendlabs+Security+Intelligence+Blog))\n[messages to the owners of popular Instagram profiles prompting them to](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/how-a-hacking-group-is-stealing-popular-instagram-profiles/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+Anti-MalwareBlog+(Trendlabs+Security+Intelligence+Blog))\nenter personal data and credentials in fake forms, putting all the submitted\n[data into the hands of the hackers. In yet another example, clients of TD Bank](https://myonlinesecurity.co.uk/fake-td-bank-confirm-account-status-delivers-trickbot/)\n[received emails with the subject line \"Confirm account status\" pretending](https://myonlinesecurity.co.uk/fake-td-bank-confirm-account-status-delivers-trickbot/)\nto come from the bank. The emails contained the TrickBot banking Trojan.\nIn both cases, the malicious messages were sent from email addresses that\nclosely resembled genuine addresses of the companies.\n\nSavvy Internet users know that one or more scrambled letters in an address\ncan be a warning sign indicating a phishing attack. But what if the domain\nmatches the legitimate one? Is it absolutely safe to open attachments from\nsuch messages? As practice shows, this is not the case. In brand impersonation attacks, attackers often use compromised resources or vulnerabilities in\nmail services to send malicious emails while posing as genuine companies. In\n[one case, hackers used an insecure SMTP server configuration to distribute](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/81373/malware/muncy-malware-phishing.html)\n[malware and impersonate DHL in a phishing campaign. Messages were sent](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/81373/malware/muncy-malware-phishing.html)\nfrom support@dhl.com, which caused recipients to let their guard down.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In another sophisticated phishing attack, hackers used the SingPost name.](https://mothership.sg/2019/03/scammers-phishing-links-singpost/)\nThe attackers sent a malicious link to users' phones in messages allegedly\ncoming from the logistics services provider. Hackers managed to send messages grouped in the same conversation history as SingPost's actual ones,\nwhich made users less vigilant, just like in the case of DHL.\n\n###### Hacking\n\nAttackers exploit known and zero-day vulnerabilities in software for various\npurposes. For example, ready-made exploits are often used to deliver hidden\nminers to devices. In Q1 2019, hackers used security flaws in the clusters with\n[outdated Elasticsearch versions (CVE-2014-3120, CVE-2015-1427) and exploit-](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/cisco-talos-honeypot-analysis-reveals.html)\n[ed vulnerabilities CVE-2019-6340 in the Drupal CMS and CVE-2019-5736 in](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6340)\n[Docker containers. Attackers also seek escalation of privileges on a system,](https://www.imperva.com/blog/hundreds-of-vulnerable-docker-hosts-exploited-by-cryptocurrency-miners/)\nsince administrator rights give them a free hand to conduct malicious actions.\n[For example, a zero-day vulnerability in the WordPress Easy WP SMTP plugin](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-0day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-easy-wp-smtp-plugin/)\nallowed attackers to create administrator accounts, modify SMTP options, and\nredirect traffic. The flaw may be used to conduct brand impersonation attacks\nagainst companies whose sites have been compromised. We have already\nlooked into an example of such an attack in the section on social engineering.\n[In another privilege escalation attack, hackers exploited two zero-day vulner-](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/03/disclosing-vulnerabilities-to-protect.html)\n[abilities at the same time—one in Google Chrome and the other in Windows 7.](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/03/disclosing-vulnerabilities-to-protect.html)\nGoogle experts discovered the attacks in late February.\n\n[Also in February, cybersecurity experts discovered vulnerabilities in WinRAR](https://research.checkpoint.com/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/)\nthat had existed in the program for around 19 years. Such flaws offer hackers\nnew opportunities for infecting victims with malware. In the first month since\n[the vulnerability was disclosed, experts have identified about a hundred ex-](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/attackers-exploiting-winrar-unacev2-dll-vulnerability-cve-2018-20250/)\nploits for the detected vulnerability. WinRAR is an ubiquitous compression\ntool used by millions of people as well as major companies, making the vulnerability immensely attractive for hackers. According to experts, the vulnerability threatens 500 million users worldwide. The developers have already\nfixed the bugs and released a new version of the software, but the threat\nremains relevant as WinRAR does not have an automatic update mechanism.\n\n###### Web attacks\n\nThe beginning of the year was marked by mass attacks by the MageCart\ngroup famous for so-called web skimmers—scripts used to steal payment\ncard information from websites. We already discussed these attacks in the\n[Q4 2018 report. In January 2019, experts noted a new surge of MageCart](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2018-q4/)\nattacks. The attackers infected 277 e-commerce websites. They managed to\nextend their reach by using supply chain attacks, in which a company is compromised in order to attack another one. MageCart hackers injected skimming code into a JavaScript library used by Adverline, an online advertising\ncompany. As a result, websites of the companies that published advertisements via Adverline were in turn infected. The Media Trust experts registered\n[a similar but larger attack. They discovered a malicious campaign compro-](https://mediatrust.com/blog/shapeshifter-3pc-adaptive-malware-campaign-hits-alexa-500-sites)\nmising tens of adtech vendors and threatening 49 high-profile websites.\n\nWhen compromising websites, attackers are motivated by more than just\ndata theft. A website attack can be an effective way to draw attention to\na problem. Attackers often hit government websites following significant\nevents that have caused public outcry. After a terrorist attack in Pulwama on\n[February 14, hundreds of Pakistani websites were hacked.](http://www.ehackingnews.com/2019/02/indian-hackers-hack-over-200-pakistani.html)\n\n\n### 17%\n\nMost severe\ndamage\n\n#### 12%\n\n 10%\n\n 8%\n\n### 12%\n\nMost severe\ndamage\n\n#### 31%\n\n 14%\n\n 12%\n\n\n-----\n\n### 11%\n\nMost severe\ndamage\n\n#### 18%\n\n 13%\n\n 13%\n\n\nSometimes hackers strive to draw public attention to security problems. The\n[website of Dublin's tram system operator, Luas, was hacked because the](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/03/xss-flaw-in-abandoned-cart-plugin-leads-to-wordpress-site-takeovers/)\nwebsite owners did not reply to a message sent by an anonymous hacker\npointing out security flaws. Developer neglect of security issues likely contributed to an XSS attack targeting users of VK, the popular Russian social\nnetwork, in February 2019.\n\nXSS attacks also threaten users of WordPress websites. A vulnerability in the\nAbandoned Cart plugin allows attackers to create a backdoor, specifically, an\naccount with administrator rights. According to experts, the flaw has already\n[been exploited by attackers at least 5,000 times. A vulnerability in the Social](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zero-day-wordpress-plugin-vulnerability-used-to-add-malicious-redirects/)\nWarfare plugin allows redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites. And\n[our company's research shows that XSS attacks are still among the most](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/web-application-vulnerabilities-statistics-2019/)\ncommon risks threatening web application users.\n\n###### Credential compromise\n\nOne source of hacker income is selling credentials on the darkweb. The more\nusernames and passwords hackers steal, the more money they get, which inspires them to conduct mass bruteforcing attacks. Experts observe a growing number of attacks aimed at bruteforcing credentials for Office 365 and\n[G Suite. Attackers are taking advantage of vulnerabilities in outdated ver-](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actors-leverage-credential-dumps-phishing-and-legacy-email-protocols)\nsions of the IMAP protocol to significantly increase the speed of password\nbruteforcing.\n\n[Traces of credential compromise were also found in an attack against Citrix](https://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/3072334/password-spraying-fingered-in-citrix-breach)\nthat resulted in theft of trade secrets. Experts believe that attackers could\nhave used so-called \"password spraying\" for the attack. This method involves\ntrying the same password or handful of passwords for a whole list of usernames. Unlike traditional bruteforcing, this technique avoids the automatic\nlockouts that would otherwise occur after numerous failed login attempts.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Victim categories\n\n###### Government\n\nMalware use\n\nWeb attacks\n\n29%\n\nSocial engineering\n\n22%\n\nHacking\n\n16%\n\nOther\n\n23%\n\n\n44%\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 11.

Cybercriminals stole credentials for\nemail accounts and other government resources. This classic supply chain\nattack managed to compromise the accounts of two major DNS providers.\nHowever, the attackers' ultimate targets were government institutions in the\nMiddle East. After gaining access to providers' servers, hackers performed a\nDNS hijacking attack, altering DNS records and redirecting all mail and VPN\ntraffic to an attacker-controlled server. The campaign reached such a scale\nthat the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had to issue an emergency\n[directive outlining security measures to be taken by all federal agencies.](https://cyber.dhs.gov/assets/report/ed-19-01.pdf)\n\nFigure 14. DNS hijacking attack scheme\n\n[Early January was also marked by the resurgence of the DarkHydrus APT](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/latest-target-attack-of-darkhydruns-group-against-middle-east-en/)\ngroup. The group targets government institutions, mainly in the Middle East,\nand distributes an updated version of the RogueRobin Trojan (developed by\nthe group itself). The updated malware version can communicate with the\nC2 server via the Google Drive API.\n\nAs before, attackers keep hitting high-traffic government websites and in[fecting them with malware. In one such case, hackers posted links to ma-](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/bangladesh-embassy-website-in-cairo-compromised/)\nlicious Word documents with the Godzilla loader on the website of the\nBangladesh embassy in Cairo.\n\n[A Pakistani government site was infected by malware. The website in ques-](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/attacker-tracking-users-seeking-pakistani-passport/)\ntion allows users to apply for a Pakistani passport and track the status of\ntheir application. The Scanbox JavaScript framework collected all the data\nsubmitted by visitors and sent it to criminals.\n\nQ1 2019 also saw a number of ransomware attacks on government institutions.\nIn most cases, the encrypted files were recovered from backups. However, of[ficials in Jackson County, Georgia, paid $400,000 to restore IT infrastructure.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/georgia-county-pays-a-whopping-400000-to-get-rid-of-a-ransomware-infection/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Healthcare\n\nMalware use\n\nSocial engineering\n\nCredential compromise\n\nHacking\n\n7%\n\n\n46%\n\n\n32%\n\n\n25%\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 15.

For example, email accounts of Verity Medical\n[Foundation employees were hacked three times within several months.](https://www.databreaches.net/verity-medical-foundation-discloses-third-incident-involving-access-to-employees-email-accounts/)\n\nHealthcare is a favorite target of ransomware attacks for several reasons.\nMedical institutions often do not have an adequate information security\nbudget. Weak protection makes hospitals easy prey for hackers. Moreover,\nhealthcare facilities store and process huge amounts of personal data, including patients' diagnoses. Hospitals risk substantial fines for losing these\ndatabases, which forces them to pay ransoms more willingly than other businesses. Columbia Surgical Specialists preferred not to risk patients' data and\n[paid $15,000 for file recovery.](https://www.databreaches.net/to-protect-the-health-and-well-being-of-patients-scheduled-for-surgery-columbia-surgical-specialists-paid-ransom/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Industrial companies\n\nMalware use\n\nSocial engineering\n\nHacking\n\n21%\n\n\n79%\n\n\n71%\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 18.

Data stolen\n\n\n-----\n\nActive Internet users constantly interact with various online services by communicating on social networks, playing games, watching movies, buying\ntickets, and booking hotel rooms. However, these services also attract hacker\nattention, as they store huge amounts of data, including of a personal nature,\nthat can bring large profits if sold.\n\nToday, one of the most popular methods of hacking is credential stuffing,\nwhen hackers try to log in to a service with credentials used for other online\n[services. In January, Reddit announced hacker attempts to obtain unauthor-](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/aea649/recently_locked_out_of_your_account_help_is_on/)\nized access to users' accounts, and had to lock down the affected accounts.\nAccording to the Reddit owners, the attackers could have been trying to\n[make use of large-scale password leaks. Video sharing platform DailyMotion](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dailymotion-discloses-credential-stuffing-attack/)\nalso fell victim to a credential stuffing attack. But where do hackers get the\ndatabases of credentials needed to conduct such attacks? The darkweb is\none such place. Data for 620 million accounts stolen from 16 hacked ma[jor websites, including popular online services, was put on sale on Dream](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/)\nMarket, a darkweb marketplace.\n\nHowever, attackers can have other objectives as well. VFEmail, an email pro[vider, was completely destroyed in a cyberattack in February 2019. The at-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-wipe-us-servers-of-email-provider-vfemail/)\ntackers formatted all disks on every server, as a result of which even backups\nwere lost. The attack can be explained by high competition on the market\nand the struggle for customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What companies can do to stay safe\n\n###### Use proven security solutions:\n\n� Systems for centralized administration of updates and patches. To prioritize update plans correctly, the most pressing security threats must be\ntaken into account.\n\n� Antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files and the\nability to detect and block threats such as malicious email attachments\nbefore they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software should simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and have the ability\nto detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well as block malicious\nactivity across diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file\nstorage, and web portals. The solution must not only check files in real time,\nbut also automatically analyze files that have already been checked; this\nwill allow detecting new threats when signature databases are updated.\n\n� We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effective response to information security incidents. This will help identify suspicious activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' presence,\nand enable prompt measures to neutralize threats.\n\n� Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.\n\n� Use web application firewalls as a preventive measure to protect websites.\n\n� Implement systems allowing deep network traffic analysis in order to detect advanced persistent threats in real time and in saved traffic. Previously\nunnoticed attacks are detected. Monitoring shows network attacks in real\ntime, including use of malware and hacking tools, exploitation of software\nvulnerabilities, and attacks on the domain controller. Such an approach\nquickly identifies attackers' presence in infrastructure, minimizes the risk of\nloss of critical data and disruption to business systems, and decreases the\nfinancial damage caused by attackers.\n\n� Use specialized anti-DDoS services.\n\n###### Protect your data:\n\n� Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information where\nit can be publicly accessed.\n� Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are isolated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.\n� Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.\n� Do not use identical username–password combinations for multiple\nsystems.\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged\naccounts.\n\n###### Do not allow weak passwords:\n\n� Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.\n� Require password changes every 90 days.\n� Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Keep clients in mind:\n\n� Improve security awareness among clients.\n� Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common\nattacks.\n� Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not\ngive out such information by email or over the phone.\n� Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.\n� Inform of security-related events.\n\n###### Do not allow weak passwords:\n\n� Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.\n� Require password changes every 90 days.\n� Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.\n\n###### Monitor and stay current:\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n� Test and educate employees regarding information security.\n\n� Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter. Regularly take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check\ntheir security, and remediate any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea\nto monitor the news for any new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in\nidentifying affected resources and applying necessary patches.\n\n� Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces accessible to an external attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote\nmanagement of servers and network equipment.\n\n� Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking\ninternal infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.\n\n� Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code\nanalysis, to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application systems and clients at risk of attack.\n\n� Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources.\nConfigure servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenarios (such as TCP/UDP flooding or high numbers of database requests).\n\n#### How vendors can secure their products\n\n� All of the measures for companies given above, plus:\n� Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).\n� Regularly audit the security of software and web applications, including\nsource-code analysis.\n� Keep web servers and database software up to date.\n� Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### How users can avoid falling victim\n\n###### Invest in security:\n\n� Use only licensed software.\n� Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n###### Protect your data:\n\n� Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a\ncopy on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.\n� Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.\n\n###### Do not use weak passwords:\n\n� Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters,\nnumbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to\ncreate and securely store passwords.\n� Set a different password for each site, email address, or other account that\nyou use.\n� Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every\ntwo to three months.\n\n###### Be vigilant:\n\n� Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.\n� Be careful when visiting sites with invalid certificates. Remember that information entered on these sites could be intercepted by attackers.\n� Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.\n� Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning appears.\n� Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or\nproduct being advertised.\n� Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About the research\n\nIn this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most\nimportant and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from our\nown expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from authoritative sources.\n\nAny particular mass incident, such as a phishing campaign using malware, is\nconsidered in this report as a single unique information security threat. Each\nevent is characterized by the following parameters:\n\n� **Attack target is the target of destructive actions by cybercriminals. For**\nexample, if an attack strikes network equipment, servers, or user workstations, the attack target is \"infrastructure.\"\n\n� **Attack motive is the ultimate goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results in**\ntheft of payment card information, the motive is \"access to information.\"\n\n� **Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. An attacker**\ncan perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network services available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to resources or\ninformation. For the purposes of this report, this process is referred to as\n\"hacking.\" Credential compromise and web attacks are put in separate categories for greater granularity.\n\n� **Victim category is the economic sector in which the attacked companies**\noperate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate). For example, the\n\"Hospitality and entertainment\" category includes companies providing\npaid services, such as consulting agencies, hotels, and restaurants. The\n\"Online services\" category includes platforms where users can fulfill their\nneeds online, for example ticket and hotel aggregator websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social media resources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale cyberattacks affecting more\nthan one industry (most often, malware outbreaks) have been placed in\nthe \"Multiple industries\" category.\n\nWe believe that in most cases cyberattacks are not made public because\nof reputational risks, which makes it hard even for companies involved in\nincident investigation and analysis of hacking groups to calculate the precise number of threats. This research was conducted in order to educate\ncompanies and individuals who care about information security on the most\ncommon motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the\nmain trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Positive Technologies\n\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and compliance management, incident and\nthreat analysis, and application protection.
