The distribution of the types of apps that Facestealer disguise themselves as\nWe recently observed a number of apps on Google Play designed to perform malicious activities such as stealing user credentials and other\nsensitive user information, including private keys. Because of the number and popularity of these apps — some of them have been installed\nover a hundred thousand times — we decided to shed some light on what these apps actually do by focusing on some of the more notable\nexamples.\n\n## Password-stealing Facestealer variants disguised as fitness, photo editing, and other apps\n\n[The Facestealer spyware was first documented in July 2021 in a report by Dr. Web detailing how it stole Facebook credentials from users via](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14244)\nfraudulent apps from Google Play. These stolen credentials could then be used to compromise Facebook accounts for malicious purposes\n[such as phishing scams, fake posts, and ad bots. Similar to Joker, another piece of mobile malware, Facestealer changes its code frequently,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/no-laughing-matter-joker-latest-ploy.html)\nthus spawning many variants. Since its discovery, the spyware has continuously beleaguered Google Play.\n\nDuring our recent research into malicious mobile apps, we encountered more than 200 additional apps of the Facestealer spyware in the Trend\nMicro [Mobile App Reputation Service (MARS) database.](https://mars.trendmicro.com/)\n\nOne of the apps we found, named Daily Fitness OL, claims to be a fitness app, complete with exercises and video demonstrations. But like the\ninitial variant, it was designed to steal the Facebook credentials of its users.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The Google Play page for Daily Fitness OL\n\nWhen the app is launched, it sends a request to hxxps://sufen168[.]space/config to download its encrypted configuration. At the time of our\nanalysis, the returned configuration was:\n\n`eXyJkIjowLCJleHQxIjoiNSw1LDAsMiwwIiwiZXh0MiI6IiIsImkiOjAsImlkIjoiMTE1NTYzNDk2MTkxMjE3MiIsImwiOjAsImxvZ2luX3BpY191cmxfc3dpdGNoIjowLCJsciI6Ijcw\n\nAfter decryption, the real configuration was:\n\n{\"d\":0,\"ext1\":\"5,5,0,2,0\",\"ext2\":\"\",\"i\":0,\"id\":\"1155634961912172\",\"l\":0,\"login_pic_url_switch\":0,\"lr\":\"70\"}\n\nThe “l” in the configuration is the flag used to control whether a prompt appears to ask the user to log in to Facebook. Once the user logs in to\nFacebook, the app launches a WebView (an embeddable browser) to load a URL, for example, hxxps://touch[.]facebook[.]com/home[.]php?\nsk=h_nor, from the downloaded configuration. A piece of JavaScript code is then injected into the loaded webpage to steal the credentials\nentered by the user.\n\nAfter the user successfully logs in to an account, the app collects the cookie. The spyware then encrypts all the personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) and sends it to the remote server. The encryption key and address of the remote server are all taken from the downloaded\nconfiguration.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. A user’s information harvested through Daily Fitness OL being uploaded to a remote server\nAnother fake app, named Enjoy Photo Editor, shares many similar procedures with the Daily Fitness OL app. The primary methods of stealing\ncredentials, in particular, are the same: harvesting credentials by injecting JavaScript code and collecting cookies after the victims successfully\nlog in to their accounts. But this app differs by moving the downloading of the configuration and the uploading of victim credentials to the native\ncode while also obfuscating the app to make it more difficult to detect by security solutions.\n\nWe show screenshots of more Facestealer variants in the following figures. The Facestealer variants we found have already been taken down\nby Google from Google Play as of this writing.\n\nFigure 4. The Google Play page for Enjoy Photo Editor\n\nFigure 5. The Google Play page for Panorama Camera\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. The Google Play page for Photo Gaming Puzzle\n\nFigure 7. The Google Play page for Swarm Photo\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. The Google Play page for Business Meta Manager\n\n## Fake cryptocurrency miner apps that collect private keys and mnemonic phrases\n\n[We also found more than 40 fake cryptocurrency miner apps that are variants of similar apps that we covered in a previous blog entry. These](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/fake-cryptocurrency-mining-apps-trick-victims-into-watching-ads-.html)\napps are designed to deceive users into buying paid services or clicking on ads by luring them in with the prospect of bogus cryptocurrency\nearnings.\n\nInitially, after running tests on one of these new variants, named “Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin,” on our test device, we did not detect any\nadvertisements and requests for sensitive information or payment. However, upon clicking the “Connect Wallet” button in the app, we were\nprompted to enter a private key (a digital signature used with an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data), which was enough of a red flag that we\ndecided to look into the app further.\n\nFigure 9. The Google Play page for Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin\n\n[Our investigation into the app’s manifest file revealed that it was developed using Kodular, a free online suite for mobile app development. In](https://www.kodular.io/)\nfact, most of the fake cryptocurrency miner apps we previously analyzed were also developed using the same framework.\n\nFigure 10. A code snippet from the\n\nmanifest file of Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin indicating that the app was developed using Kodular\nUpon checking the code, we found that this app only loaded a website. And without any code to simulate mining, there was no way to\ndetermine if the app was actually malicious. However, we decided to dig deeper, starting with the URL of the loaded site.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. A snippet from the code of Cryptomining Farm\n\nYour own Coin showing the app wrapper used for the URL of the loaded website\n\nFigure 12. The mobile version of the website loaded from\n\nCryptomining Farm Your own Coin\nTo facilitate further analysis, we tried opening this URL on a desktop web browser. At first glance, the loaded website appears to be quite\nprofessionally done. It notifies users that they can participate in cloud-based cryptocurrency mining without any deposits. It also promises 500\ngigahashes per second (Gh/s) computing power to users free of charge after they connect an active wallet.\n\nFigure 13. The desktop version of the website loaded from\n\nCryptomining Farm Your own Coin\nThe wallet connection page of the website assures users that their data will be encrypted with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and their\nprivate keys will not be stored.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. The wallet connection page of the website loaded\n\nfrom Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin, including assurances that users’ data will be encrypted and private keys will not be stored\nWe entered a number of arbitrary private key strings for testing in the “Import by Currency” tab, and the results of the packet capture analysis\ntold us that the stated claims were false: The site not only uploaded an entered private key, but it also did so without any encryption.\n\nFigure 15. A test private key being sent to the\n\nserver controlled by the malicious actors behind Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin\nIn addition to private keys, this site also steals mnemonic phrases (series of unrelated words that are generated when a cryptocurrency wallet\nis created). These are typically used to recover cryptocurrency in case the user’s wallet is lost or damaged. In the case of fake apps such as\nCryptomining Farm Your own Coin or website such as the one loaded from this app, an entered mnemonic phrase is sent directly to the\nmalicious actors behind the app or website in question and is uploaded in clear text to their server. This procedure is similar to the fake\ncryptocurrency wallet app scheme we discussed in a previous blog entry.\n\nFigure 16. A mnemonic phrase being sent to the server\n\ncontrolled by the malicious actors behind Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin\nWe located the code in the upload section of the app and confirmed that the site indeed uploads plain-text private keys or mnemonic phrases\nto the server controlled by the operators of the app.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. A snippet from the code of behind Cryptomining Farm Your\n\nown Coin showing private keys or mnemonic phrases being sent sans encryption to the server controlled by the malicious actors behind the\napp\nTo lure users into signing up for the service, the site uses an airdrop for 0.1 ether (approximately US$240 at the time of this writing) as a bait.\nThe claim details of the airdrop cleverly state that a wallet can be claimed only once (so that a user has to bind multiple wallets) and the wallet\nmust have more than US$100 (so that the malicious actors behind the app have something to steal).\n\nFigure 18. An airdrop for 0.1 ether used by Cryptomining Farm Your own\n\nCoin to lure users into signing up for the app’s supposed service\nTo generate an air of legitimacy, the page is populated with likely fake comments by users mentioning that they successfully claimed their 0.1\nether.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Likely fake comments found on the website loaded from Cryptomining Farm Your\n\nown Coin vouching for the legitimacy of the promised airdrop for 0.1 ether\nInterestingly, upon checking the code showing the alleged creator of the webpage (seemingly mimicking the cryptocurrency wallet ecosystem\nKlever), we found a hyperlink in the code that turned out to be the Twitter account of Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of Tesla, who is a wellknown cryptocurrency investor.\n\nFigure 20. A link to Elon Musk’s Twitter account found in the code of\n\nthe website loaded from Cryptomining Farm Your own Coin\nThis app has already been taken down by Google as of the time of writing.\n\nConclusion and recommendations\n\nFacestealer apps are disguised as simple tools — such as virtual private network (VPN), camera, photo editing, and fitness apps — making\nthem attractive lures to people who use these types of apps. Because of how Facebook runs its cookie management policy, we feel that these\ntypes of apps will continue to plague Google Play.\n\nAs for the fake cryptocurrency miner apps, their operators not only try to profit from their victims by duping them into buying fake cloud-based\ncryptocurrency-mining services, but they also try to harvest private keys and other sensitive cryptocurrency-related information from users who\nare interested in what they offer. Looking into the future, we believe that other methods of stealing private keys and mnemonic phrases are\nlikely to appear.\n\nUsers can avoid such fake apps by checking their reviews, especially the negatives ones, to see if there are any unusual concerns or\nexperiences from actual users who have downloaded the apps. Users should also apply due diligence to the developers and publishers of\nthese apps, so that they can better avoid apps with dodgy websites or sketchy publishers, especially given the number of alternatives on the\napp store. Finally, users should avoid downloading apps from third-party sources, since these are where many malicious actors host their\nfraudulent apps.\n\n[Mobile users can help minimize the threats posed by these fraudulent apps through the use of Trend Micro Mobile Security Solutions, which](https://go2.trendmicro.com/geoip/mobile-security)\nscan mobile devices in real time and on demand to detect malicious apps or malware to block or delete them. These apps are available on\nboth Android and iOS.\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n Facestealer\n\nSHA-256 Package name Detection name\n\n7ea4757b71680797cbce66a8ec922484fc25f87814cc4f811e70ceb723bfd0fc com.olfitness.android AndroidOS_FaceStealer.HRXH\n\n\n-----\n\nb7fe6ec868fedaf37791cf7f1fc1656b4df7cd511b634850b890b333a9b81b9d com.editor.xinphoto AndroidOS_FaceStealer.HRXF\n\n40580a84b5c1b0526973f12d84e46018ea4889978a19fcdcde947de5b2033cff com.sensitivity.swarmphoto AndroidOS_FaceStealer.HRXE\n\n6ccd0c0302cda02566301ae51f8da4935c02664169ad0ead4ee07fa6b2f99112 com.meta.adsformeta3 AndroidOS_FaceStealer.HRXG\n\n4464b2de7b877c9ff0e4c904e9256b302c9bd74abc5c8dacb6e4469498c64691 com.photo.panoramacamera AndroidOS_FaceStealer.HRXF\n\n3325488a8df69a92be92eb11bf01ab4c9b612c5307d615e72c07a4d859675e3f com.photo.move AndroidOS_FaceStealer.HRXF\n\nFake cryptocurrency miners\n\nSHA-256 Package name Detection name\n\n\n3d3761c2155f7cabee8533689f473e59d49515323e12e9242553a0bd5e7cffa9\n\n7c76bff97048773d4cda8faacaa9c2248e594942cc492ffbd393ed8553d27e43\n\nc56615acac1a0df1830730fe791bb6f068670d27017f708061119cb3a49d6ff5\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\n\n\napp.cryptomining.work AndroidOS_FakeMinerStealer\n\n\nTactic Technique\nID\n\n\nTechnique name Description\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\n\n[T1475](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1475/) Deliver Malicious\nApp via Authorized\nApp Store\n\n\n[T1411](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1411/) Input Prompt The Facestealer apps intercept password during user Facebook login through WebView.\nThe fake cryptocurrency miner apps request private key under the guise of connecting to\nthe victim’s account.\n\n\nThe Facestealer and fake cryptocurrency miner apps are distributed via Google Play.\n\n\nCollection [T1533](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1533/) Data from Local\nSystem\n\nExfiltration [T1437](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1437/) Standard Application\nLayer Protocol\n\n\nThe apps collect cookies from WebView.\n\nMalicious code exfiltrates credentials over standard HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n\n-----",
