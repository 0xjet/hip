In this blog, we](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/fin7-pursuing-an-enigmatic-and-evasive-global-criminal-operation)\nreveal two of FIN7’s new tools that we have called BOOSTWRITE and RDFSNIFFER.\n\nThe first of FIN7's new tools is BOOSTWRITE – an in-memory-only dropper that decrypts embedded payloads using an\nencryption key retrieved from a remote server at runtime. FIN7 has been observed making small changes to this malware\nfamily using multiple methods to avoid traditional antivirus detection, including a BOOSTWRITE sample where the\ndropper was signed by a valid Certificate Authority. One of the analyzed BOOSTWRITE variants contained two payloads:\n[CARBANAK and RDFSNIFFER. While CARBANAK has been thoroughly analyzed and has been used maliciously by](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/carbanak-week-part-one-a-rare-occurrence)\nseveral financial attackers including FIN7, RDFSNIFFER is a newly-identified tool recovered by Mandiant investigators.\n\n\n-----\n\nRDFSNIFFER, a payload of BOOSTWRITE, appears to have been developed to tamper with NCR Corporation s Aloha\nCommand Center” client. NCR Aloha Command Center is a remote administration toolset designed to manage and\ntroubleshoot systems within payment card processing sectors running the Command Center Agent. The malware loads\ninto the same process as the Command Center process by abusing the DLL load order of the legitimate Aloha utility.\nMandiant provided this information to NCR.\n\n**BOOSTWRITE Loader: Where You At?**\n\nBOOSTWRITE is a loader crafted to be launched via abuse of the DLL search order of applications which load the\nlegitimate ‘Dwrite.dll’ provided by the Microsoft DirectX Typography Services. The application loads the ‘gdi’ library, which\nloads the ‘gdiplus’ library, which ultimately loads ‘Dwrite’. Mandiant identified instances where BOOSTWRITE was placed\non the file system alongside the RDFClient binary to force the application to import DWriteCreateFactory from it rather\nthan the legitimate DWrite.dll.\n\nOnce loaded, `DWrite.dll` connects to a hard-coded IP and port from which it retrieves a decryption key and initialization\nvector (IV) to decrypt two embedded payload DLLs. To accomplish this task, the malware first generates a random file\nname to be used as a text log under the current user's %TEMP% directory; this filename starts with ~rdf and is followed\nby a set of random numbers. Next, the malware scans its own image to find the location of a 32-byte long multi-XOR key\nwhich is used to decode data inside its body. Part of the decoded data is an IP address and port which are used to\nretrieve the key and the IV for the decryption of the embedded payloads. The encryption algorithm uses the ChaCha\nstream cipher with a 256-bit key and 64-bit IV.\n\nOnce the key and the IV are downloaded the malware decrypts the embedded payloads and performs sanity checks on\nthe results. The payloads are expected to be PE32.DLLs which, if the tests pass, are loaded into memory without\ntouching the filesystem.\n\nThe malware logs various plaintext messages to the previously created logfile %TEMP%\\~rds<rnd_numbers> which are\nindicative of the loader’s execution progress. An example of the file content is shown in Figure 1:\n\nLoading...\n\nStarting...\n\nInit OK\n\nKey OK\n\nData: 4606941\n\nHS: 20\n\nK:[32] V:[8]\n\nDCnt: 732642317(ERR)\n\nFigure 1: BOOSTWRITE log file\n\nBefore exiting, the malware resolves the location of the benign DWrite.dll library and passes the execution control to its\nDWriteCreateFactory method.\n\nThe malware decrypts and loads two payload DLLs. One of the DLLs is an instance of the CARBANAK backdoor; the\nother DLL is a tool tracked by FireEye as RDFSNIFFER which allows an attacker to hijack instances of the NCR Aloha\nCommand Center Client application and interact with victim systems via existing legitimate 2FA sessions.\n\n**RDFSNIFFER Module: We Smell a RAT**\n\nRDFSNIFFER is a module loaded by BOOSTWRITE which allows an attacker to monitor and tamper with legitimate\nconnections made via NCR Corporation’s ‘Aloha Command Center Client’ (RDFClient), an application designed to\nprovide visibility and system management capabilities to remote IT techs. RDFSNIFFER loads into the same process as\nthe legitimate RDFClient by abusing the utility’s DLL load order, launching each time the ‘Aloha Command Center Client’\nis executed on an impacted system.\n\nWhen the RDFSNIFFER module is loaded by BOOSTWRITE it hooks several Win32 API functions intended to enable it\nto tamper with NCR Aloha Command Center Client sessions or hijack elements of its user-interface (Table 1).\nFurthermore, this enables the malware to alter the user’s last input time to ensure application sessions do not time out.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Win32 API Function** **Hook Description**\n\nCertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy Used to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions\n\nCertGetCertificateChain Used to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions\n\nWSAConnect Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections\n\nconnect Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections\n\nConnectEx Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections\n\nDispatchMessageW Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nDispatchMessageA Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nDefWindowProcW Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nDefWindowProcA Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nGetLastInputInfo Used to change the user's last input time (to avoid timed lock outs)\n\nTable 1: RDFSNIFFER’s Hooked Win32 API Functions\n\nThis module also contains a backdoor component that enables it to inject commands into an active RDFClient session.\nThis backdoor allows an attacker to upload, download, execute and/or delete arbitrary files (Table 2).\n\n\n**Command**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Legit Function in**\n**RDFClient**\n\n\n**RDFClient Command**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nUpload FileMgrSendFile 107 Uploads a file to the remote system\n\nDownload FileMgrGetFile 108 Retrieves a file from the remote system\n\nExecute RunCommand 3001 Executes a command on the remote\nsystem\n\nDeleteRemote FileMgrDeleteFile 3019 Deletes file on remote system\n\nDeleteLocal - - Deletes a local file\n\nTable 2: RDFSNIFFER’s Backdoor Functions\n\n**Signed: Yours Truly, FIN7**\n\nWhile the majority of BOOSTWRITE variants recovered from investigations have been unsigned, Mandiant identified a\nsigned BOOSTWRITE sample used by FIN7 during a recent investigation. Following that discovery, a signed\nBOOSTWRITE sample [was uploaded to VirusTotal on October 3. This executable uses a code signing certificate issued](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/18cc54e2fbdad5a317b6aeb2e7db3973cc5ffb01bbf810869d79e9cb3bf02bd5/detection)\nby MANGO ENTERPRISE LIMITED (Table 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **Organization** **Country** **Serial**\n\n\na67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306 mango\nENTERPRISE\nLIMITED\n\nTable 3: Code signing certificate used for BOOSTWRITE\n\n\nGB 32 7F 8F 10 74 78 42 4A BE B8 2A 85\nDC 36 57 03 CC 82 70 5B\n\n\nThis indicates the operators may be actively altering this malware to avoid traditional detection mechanisms. Notably, the\nsigned BOOSTWRITE sample had a 0/68 detection ratio when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of this tactic (Figure 2).\n\n\nCurrent VirusTotal detection ratio for signed BOOSTWRITE\n\n\nFigure 2: Current VirusTotal\n\ndetection ratio for signed BOOSTWRITE\nUse of a code signing certificate for BOOSTWRITE is not a completely new technique for FIN7 as the group has used\ndigital certificates in the past to sign their phishing documents, backdoors, and later stage tools. By exploiting the trust\ninherently provided by code certificates, FIN7 increases their chances of bypassing various security controls and\nsuccessfully compromising victims. The full evasion achieved against the detection engines deployed to VirusTotal – as\ncompared to an unsigned BOOSTWRITE sample with an invalid checksum– illustrates that FIN7’s methods were\neffective in subverting both traditional detection and ML binary classification engines. This is a known issue and has been\n[deeply studied since at least 2016’s “Chains of Distrust” research and](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2872518.2888610) [2017’s “Certified Malware” paper. Since there are](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/papers/CCS-2017.pdf)\nplenty of goodware samples with bad or no signatures – and a growing number of malware samples with good signatures\n– there is no easy solution here. The upside is that vendors selectively deploy engines to VirusTotal (including FireEye)\nand VT detection performance often isn’t a comprehensive representation of encountering full security technology stacks\nthat implement detection-in-depth. Later in this blog we further explore BOOSTWRITE’s PE Authenticode signature, its\nanomalies, and how code signing can be turned from a detection challenge into detection opportunities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nWhile these incidents have also included FIN7’s typical and long-used toolsets, such as CARBANAK and BABYMETAL,\nthe introduction of new tools and techniques provides further evidence FIN7 is continuing to evolve in response to\nsecurity enhancements. Further, the use of code signing in at least one case highlights the group's judicious use of\nresources, potentially limiting their use of these certificates to cases where they have been attempting to bypass\nparticular security controls. Barring any further law enforcement actions, we expect at least a portion of the actors who\ncomprise the FIN7 criminal organization to continue conducting campaigns. As a result, organizations need to remain\nvigilant and continue to monitor for changes in methods employed by the FIN7 actors.\n\n**Sigs Up Dudes! Indicators, Toolmarks, and Detection Opportunities**\n\nWhile FireEye does not release our production detection logic for the code families, this section does contain some\nidentification and hunting concepts that we adopt in our layered detection strategy. Table 4 contains malware samples\nreferenced in this blog that FireEye is able to share from the larger set recovered during active investigations.\n\n**Type** **Indicator(s)**\n\nBOOSTWRITE (signed) MD5: a67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306\n\nSHA-1: a873f3417d54220e978d0ca9ceb63cf13ec71f84\n\nSHA-256: 18cc54e2fbdad5a317b6aeb2e7db3973cc5ffb01bbf810869d79e9cb3bf02bd5\n\nC2: 109.230.199[.]227\n\nBOOSTWRITE (unsigned) MD5: af2f4142463f42548b8650a3adf5ceb2\n\nSHA1: 09f3c9ae382fbd29fb47ecdfeb3bb149d7e961a1\n\nSHA256: 8773aeb53d9034dc8de339651e61d8d6ae0a895c4c89b670d501db8dc60cd2d0\n\nC2: 109.230.199[.]227\n\nTable 4: Publicly-shareable BOOSTWRITE samples\n\nThe signed BOOSTWRITE sample has a PE Authenticode anomaly that can be detected using yara’s PE signature\nmodule. Specifically, the PE linker timestamp is prior to the Authenticode validity period, as seen in Table 5.\n\n**Timestamp** **Description**\n\n2019-05-20 09:50:55 UTC Signed BOOSTWRITE’s PE compilation time\n\n\n2019-05-22 00:00 UTC\n\nthrough\n\n2020-05-21 23:59 UTC\n\n\nSigned BOOSTWRITE’s “mango ENTERPRISE LIMITED” certificate validity window\n\n\nTable 5: Relevant executabe timestamps\n\nA public example of a Yara rule covering this particular PE Authenticode timestamp anomaly is available in a blog post\nfrom David Cannings, with the key logic shown in Figure 3.\n\npe.number_of_signatures > 0 and not for all i in (0..pe.number_of_signatures - 1):\n\npe.signatures[i].valid_on(pe.timestamp)\n\nFigure 3: Excerpt of NCC Group’s research Yara rule\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are other PE Authenticode anomalies that can also be represented as Yara rules to surface similarly suspicious\nfiles. Of note, this signed BOOSTWRITE sample has no counter signature and, while the unauthenticated attributes\ntimestamp structure is present, it is empty. In preparing this blog, FireEye’s Advanced Practices team identified a possible\nissue with VirusTotal’s parsing of signed executable timestamps as seen in Figure 4.\n\nInconsistency in VirusTotal file signature timestamps for the signed BOOSTWRITE\nsample\n\n\nFigure 4: Inconsistency in\n\nVirusTotal file signature timestamps for the signed BOOSTWRITE sample\nFireEye filed a bug report with Google to address the discrepancy in VirusTotal in order to remove confusion for other\nusers.\n\nTo account for the detection weaknesses introduced by techniques like code signing, our Advanced Practices team\ncombines the malicious confidence spectrum that comes from ML detection systems with file oddities and anomalies\n(weak signals) to surface highly interesting and evasive malware. This technique was recently described in our own Dr.\nSteven Miller’s Definitive Dossier of Devilish Debug Details. In fact, the exact same program database (PDB) path-based\napproach from his blog can be applied to the toolmarks seen in this sample for a quick hunting rule. Figure 5 provides the\nPDB path of the BOOSTWRITE samples from this blog.\n\nF:\\projects\\DWriteImpl\\Release\\DWriteImpl.pdb\n\nFigure 5: BOOSTWRITE PDB path\n\nThe Yara rule template can be applied to result in the quick rule in Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nrule ConventionEngine_BOOSTWRITE\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Nick Carr (@itsreallynick)\"\nreference = \"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/definitive-dossier-of-devilish-debug-details-partone-pdb-paths-malware.html\"\nstrings:\n$weetPDB = /RSDS[\\x00-\\xFF]{20}[a-zA-Z]?:?\\\\[\\\\\\s|*\\s]?.{0,250}\\\\DWriteImpl[\\\\\\s|*\\s]?.{0,250}\\.pdb\\x00/ nocase\ncondition:\n(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and $weetPDB and filesize < 6MB\n}\n\nFigure 6: Applying BOOSTWRITE’s PDB path to a Yara rule\n\nWe can apply this same concept across other executable traits, such as BOOSTWRITE’s export DLL name\n(DWriteImpl.dll), to create quick and easy rules that can aid in quick discovery as seen in Figure 7.\n\nrule Exports_BOOSTWRITE\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Steve Miller (@stvemillertime) & Nick Carr (@itsreallynick)\"\nstrings:\n$exyPants = \"DWriteImpl.dll\" nocase\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and $exyPants at\npe.rva_to_offset(uint32(pe.rva_to_offset(pe.data_directories[pe.IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT].virtual_address)\n+ 12)) and filesize < 6MB\n}\n\nFigure 7: Applying BOOSTWRITE’s export DLL names to a Yara rule (Note: this rule was updated following publication.
