For months, Truesec's Threat Intelligence team has been monitoring the\nactivities of Russian ransomware leagues and Russian intelligence services. There is much\nto suggest that the Russian state is behind the cyberattacks.\n\n## Part 1 - The Ransomware Attack and Takeover\n\nIn October 2020, the Russian-based threat actor known as “Evil Corp” conducted a\nransomware attack against a major corporation. The attack vector to gain initial access was\na drive-by compromise: a legitimate website was compromised and visitors to the website\nwere prompted to download a fake Chrome update; a ZIP file, containing a JavaScript file.\n\nThe actual script was not recovered, but based on the information found, Truesec\nestablished that it is highly likely that it was part of the SocGholish framework. The threat\nactor behind SocGholish is known to leverage compromised websites to distribute malware\nvia fake browser updates. The following figure illustrates an example of this attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Sample of the_\n\n_SocGholish fake Browser update_\nDouble-clicking the JavaScript file triggered the Windows Scripting Host engine to run the\nscript, which in turn would start a backdoor giving the threat actor remote control of the\ninfected computer.\n\nThe initial backdoor was used five minutes later to deploy the second stage tool: Cobalt\nStrike. The Cobalt Strike beacon was embedded into a C# project file and executed with the\nMicrosoft utility MsBuild.exe. An example of the execution is the following:\n\nThe csproj file defined a build task that was executed during the build process. This injected\nthe Cobalt Strike beacon in memory. The beacon used covert communication channels with\na technique called Domain Fronting. This leveraged the legitimate Content Delivery\nNetworks at msn.com, lastpass.com, and adobe.com, to proxy the traffic to the threat actor\ninfrastructure in the backend.\n\n_Figure 2: Cobalt Strike C2 using Domain Fronting._\nThis level of sophistication makes network-based detection challenging, as the visible\ncommunication is directed to legitimate CDN’s. The use of MsBuild.exe and the csproj file is\nalso a method to evade certain host-based detection techniques. The Cobalt Strike Beacon\nalso mimics a jquery request.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Cobalt Strike Beacon_\nCobalt Strike also downloaded an additional payload using the .NET webclient function\ndownloadstring.\n\n_Figure 4: Powershell command executed by threat actor._\nThe payload was downloaded from the URL http[:]//roofingspecialists[.]info/file. The payload\nis a PowerShell script defining a function called getsystemtime, which is also invoked by the\ndropper. The getsystemtime function contains a base64 encoded .NET assembly that is\nloaded into memory.\n\n_Figure 5: Second stage payload loaded into memory_\nThe decoded assembly contained shellcode and .NET code to inject it into a process. An\nexcerpt from the decompiled assembly can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Decompiled assembly loaded in memory._\nThe shellcode loaded by the above assembly does not execute anything directly but rather\nloads selected libraries and defines additional attack code to the Cobalt Strike session on the\nvictim machine.\n\nSeven minutes after the Cobalt Strike malware was deployed on the compromised client\ncomputer (Patient Zero), the threat actor began network discovery activities and escalation\nattempts and achieved full infrastructure compromise within four hours from the initial\nbreach. The threat actor leveraged common vulnerabilities such as passwords exposed on\nnetwork shares and exploiting unpatched systems.\n\nIt is noteworthy that manual operations probably began just minutes after the initial\ncompromise. This is remarkable, considering that the attack vector was a drive-by attack,\nwhich essentially means that the threat actor must have been continuously monitoring their\nC2 servers for new victims and immediately begun manual operations after they were alerted\nto a new victim.\n\n### Reconnaissance and Ransomware Deployment\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the escalation in Active Directory only took a few hours, the internal reconnaissance\nand data discovery began around a week after the initial compromise and went on for nearly\nthree weeks. During the first week the threat actor searched through many profiles and\npushed Cobalt Strike onto additional servers. They also used Internet Explorer on\ncompromised servers to access additional internal systems.\n\nDuring the last two weeks, the threat actor focused the reconnaissance on methodically\ngathering data from network shares, user profiles, browser history of IT admins, cloud-based\nmailboxes, and eventually identified credentials and locations of the cloud-based backups in\nuse which were then deleted.\n\nMoreover, the cloud solution in use for central management of endpoint protection software\nwas also accessed and used to uninstall security software from all systems. The level of\ndetermination and methodology to identify information such as backup solutions and security\nsoftware platforms represents a high level of sophistication.\n\nAlmost a month after the initial compromise, the final stage of the attack began, when the\nthreat actor deployed the “Wasted Locker” ransomware on all systems, using remote WMI\ncommands and the Microsoft tool PsExec. During the encryption phase the threat actor\nactively searched for encrypted files, likely to ensure encryption had succeeded.\n\n_Figure_\n\n_7: Example command, confirming encryption worked._\nThe attack kill chain is illustrated below.\n\n_Figure 8: KillChain_\n\n## Part 2 - Ties to an Espionage Campaign\n\n### A Friendly Warning\n\n\n-----\n\nIn April 2021, almost six months after the ransomware attack, the victim organization\ncontacted Truesec because of a mail received from a government cyber defense\norganization. The mail was flagged TLP:Amber, so we cannot share it, but the essence of the\nmail was that they were warned that their system may be under the control or impacted by a\ncyber event. The mail included information about the initial compromise and then referred to\nthe report by PRODAFT about the SilverFish cyberespionage group for details.\n\nTruesec could quickly confirm that the cyber event referred to in the warning was the initial\ncompromise that Truesec had found to be the start of the Wasted Locker ransomware attack.\nWe could also determine that the Cobalt Strike beacon used in the attack was in fact the\n[same Cobalt Strike beacon found in the PRODAFT report since it was using the same](http://www.prodaft.com/m/uploads/SilverFish_TLPWHITE.pdf)\ndomains and Domain Fronting technique described in the report. The domain used to\ndownload the PowerShell script getsystemtime also appeared in the report from PRODAFT.\n\nIt appears that the threat actor behind the Wasted Locker ransomware attack was identical to\nthe SilverFish actor, but SilverFish was reported as a cyberespionage group that had used\nthe SolarWinds breach to gain access. The Truesec Threat Intelligence Unit then decided it\nwas time to dig a little deeper into the matter.\n\n### Timelines\n\nTo better understand the chain of events, we started to construct a timeline. Immediately we\nnoticed that there were several reports that the threat actor behind Wasted Locker were no\nlonger distributing this ransomware but had instead switched to another ransomware called\n[Hades. The first instance of the Hades ransomware attack was reported on 17 December](http://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1339324224029274118)\n2020. This is important because in their report PRODAFT says they began after the\nSolarWinds breach was exposed in December, when Wasted Locker was no longer active.\n\nWe could also indirectly confirm the link between the Wasted Locker and Hades ourselves,\nas one of the threat actor IP addresses, 185[.]82.127.86, was used in the Wasted Locker\n[attack in October 2020 and was later reported to be a Hades C2 in January 2021.](http://www.abuseipdb.com/check/185.82.127.86)\n\nOf all the IOCs that Truesec had found in the Wasted Locker ransomware attack in October\n2020, the domains had appeared in a big cyberespionage campaign a month later, while at\nleast one of the IP addresses had been reused in a Hades ransomware attack.\n\nThe PRODAFT report lists many interesting facts about the threat actor named SilverFish,\nwhich seems to be a very sophisticated and organized group. They had teams of hackers\nworking shifts, day and night. This certainly fits with our findings regarding the Wasted\nLocker attack in October. Only a group working continuously in shifts would be capable of\nreacting this fast to the successful drive-by attack.\n\nNevertheless, the PRODAFT report only mentions the SolarWinds breach as the attack\nvector that SilverFish used. Nowhere do they mention drive-by attacks like the SocGholish\nframework Truesec observed being the initial attack vector for the Wasted Locker attack\n\n\n-----\n\nIt appears as if the same threat actor used their infrastructure for Wasted Locker attacks in\nOctober 2020, only to shift their operation to run an espionage campaign stealing data from\nvictims of the SolarWinds breach in January 2021. So, what happened in between those two\ndates?\n\nGoing back to the timeline for the SolarWinds breach, the most important date was the 13th\nof December, the day the SolarWinds breach was publicized. This means that just four days\nafter the SolarWinds breach was made public, the threat actor behind the Wasted Locker\nransomware stopped using their ransomware and instead switched to the new Hades\nransomware.\n\nOne purpose of the SilverFish threat actor seems to have been to save as much as possible\nof the access obtained by the SolarWinds breach once it was outed in the media. To do so\nthey used an existing infrastructure. An infrastructure that until then had been used to\nconduct ransomware operations with the Wasted Locker ransomware.\n\n_Figure 9:_ _Timelines for Wasted Locker and SolarWinds campaigns_\nIn fact, the timelines of Wasted Locker and the SolarWinds breach had one more\ncongruency. The first known instance when the threat actor behind the SolarWinds breach\npushed the Sunburst malware was in February 2020. At the same time, the threat actor\nbehind Wasted Locker ceased operations in the end of February 2020, probably to prepare\nto release the new Wasted Locker ransomware.\n\n### An Elusive Threat Actor\n\nThe threat actor behind the Wasted Locker ransomware attacks is generally believed to be\nthe infamous “Evil Corp” group. Evil Corp has for many years been a pioneer in financial\ncybercrime. Their BitPaymer ransomware was one of the first truly successful ransomware\noperations that pioneered the “Big Game Hunting” attacks against large corporate networks\nearning millions of USD in ransom money.\n\n[Truesec has already exposed the special status that organized cybercrime seems to have in](http://blog.truesec.com/2021/03/30/russia-is-part-of-the-ransomware-problem/)\nRussia as long as they play by the unwritten rules. Rules that include staying on the good\nside of the powerful Russian security service, FSB. In fact, the alleged leader of Evil Corp,\n\n\n-----\n\nMaxim Yakubets is married to the daughter of an ex-FSB colonel with ties to an FSB Special\n[Forces unit and clandestine assassination attacks.](http://www.rferl.org/a/bellingcat-says-fsb-behind-2019-berlin-killing-of-former-chechen-separatist-commander/30439907.html)\n\n_Image: Maxim Yakubets_\n\nThe US Government has blamed the Russian Intelligence Agency SVR for the SolarWinds\nbreach. The size and the scope of the SolarWinds breach makes it difficult to believe that\nanything less than a state sponsored intelligence organization was behind the operation.\nWhile there is no proof that SilverFish is part of the same organization as the threat actor\nresponsible for the SolarWinds breach, it seems they are a Russian cyberespionage group\nthat tries to exploit the success of the SolarWinds breach.\n\nWho is this threat actor then? Is it a highly sophisticated cybercrime group that conducts\ncyberespionage for profit, presumably selling the stolen data to the Russian government, or\nis it even a cyberespionage group that runs a ransomware operation as a smoke screen to\ncover their true purpose?\n\n## Part 3 - Conclusions\n\n### Follow the Money!\n\nThe threat actor Truesec observed in the Wasted Locker attack certainly appeared to be very\nsophisticated. There is, however, one important area in which this threat actor does not seem\nto be very sophisticated – scaring the victims into paying the ransom.\n\nIn 2020, virtually all major ransomware groups added data leak sites to their arsenal of\npressure to their victims. In addition to encrypting the victim’s data, they threaten to leak\nsensitive corporate data publicly, hurting their business and possibly making them liable to\n\n\n-----\n\nGDPR fines in addition to the cost of disrupted services. In 2021, some groups are\nexpanding their threats to include DDoS attacks and threatening phone calls.\n\nBy comparison, the threat actor behind Wasted Locker and Hades does not seem to have\nspent much innovation on terrorizing their victims into paying the ransom, beyond the initial\nransomware. By the fall of 2020, Wasted Locker appears to be almost the only major\nransomware group that did not operate a data leak site.\n\nThe first report about Wasted Locker’s successor Hades, even mentions that victims of\nHades had trouble contacting the threat actor to pay the ransom. For such a sophisticated\ncybercrime group, it seems almost amateurish to mess up the most important part of the\nwhole operation, the payment!\n\n### Maskirovka\n\nIf the threat actor behind the Wasted Locker ransomware is in fact identical to SilverFish, we\nthen have a highly sophisticated threat actor who displays a very high level of skill in almost\nevery aspect of their cyberattacks, including a highly organized cyberespionage campaign.\nThe only exception appears to be the step where they ensure they get paid from their\nransomware victims. It is as if the threat actor values stealth more than big money.\n\nThere is speculation that Evil Corp is keeping such a low profile because their leaders have\nbeen sanctioned by OFAC in 2019. This is a possible explanation for the threat actor's\nbehaviour, but this does not explain the connections to SilverFish and the SolarWinds\nbreach.\n\nThere is also a possibility that Wasted Locker and SilverFish were run independently.\nTheoretically, Russian Intelligence could have leaned on the threat actor running Wasted\nLocker to let them take over part of their infrastructure to cover their tracks once the backlash\nof the exposure of the SolarWinds breach became apparent. It would even explain the\napparent chaos when they suddenly shifted to the Hades ransomware.\n\nThere are, however, so many similarities in TTPs between the Wasted Locker attack that\nTruesec investigated, and the threat actor described in the PRODAFT report. It is possible\nthat the entire Wasted Locker/Hades ransomware campaigns have been run as just a\n“maskirovka”, the Russian word for deception, to hide a cyberespionage campaign. The\nreason why they seem to be careless about extracting the ransom could simply be that it is\nnot important to them. They just need to keep up the appearance.\n\nThe threat actor that Truesec observed conducting the Wasted Locker ransomware attack\nspent a long time systematically searching the compromised systems but stole very little\ndata. It is possible they initially searched for valuable data to steal, and only after they\ndetermined the organization had no espionage value, decided to deploy the ransomware. If\n\n\n-----\n\nso, perhaps some of the victims in the SilverFish campaign were in fact infected by\nSocGholish, but never received the Wasted Locker ransomware, because they were deemed\ntoo important as espionage victims.\n\n### End Note – The New Russia\n\n[While researching this report, we came across an article about Maksim Yakubets, the alleged](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8564681/Garmin-services-begin-come-online-Russian-hacker-demanded-10m-restore-systems.html)\nleader of Evil Corp, that included the sentence “In April 2018, Yakubets was in the process of\nobtaining a license to work with classified Russian information from the Russian spy agency,\nthe FSB - the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.”\n\nRussia is notorious for blurring lines and purposefully operating on the borders between war\nand peace to achieve their ends through “hybrid-warfare.” Russian oligarchs blur the lines\nbetween public and private, as they own private mercenary groups that support Russian\nforeign objectives, while providing deniability to the Russian government.\n\nPerhaps the threat actor behind both Wasted Locker and SilverFish is the latest iteration of\nEvil Corp after all? Perhaps Evil Corp has now morphed into a mercenary espionage\norganization controlled by Russian Intelligence but hiding behind the façade of a cybercrime\nring, blurring the lines between crime and espionage. If so, it would likely mean that this\ngroup uses the ransom money paid by victims to finance their espionage operations.\n\n## APPENDIX - Indicators of Compromise\n\n**CDN endpoint for Domain Fronting to C2 Server**\n\ntwimg-us.azureedge[.]net \n**CDN Domains**\n\ncdn.auditor.adobe[.]com \nimages.adsyndication.msn[.]com\n\nlp-cdn.lastpass[.]com\n\n**Post-Exploitation Domains**\n\nroofingspecialists[.]info/file \n**Post-Exploitation IP Addresses**\n\n185[.]82.127.86\n\n\n-----\n\n66[.]58.201.137\n\n- = Found in both Wasted Locker attack and PRODAFT report.\n\n[Cybersecurity](https://blog.truesec.com/hub/all/cybersecurity) [Threat Intelligence](https://blog.truesec.com/hub/all/threat-intelligence)\n\n\n-----",
