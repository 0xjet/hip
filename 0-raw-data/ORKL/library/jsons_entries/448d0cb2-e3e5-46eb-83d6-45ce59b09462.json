The activity was identified through a_\n_combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis._\n_This report will be of most interest to individuals and organizations with strategic_\n_and operational intelligence requirements relating to Chinese cyber threat activity,_\n_as well as network defenders in government organizations within Southeast Asia_\n_and Europe._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group continues to track activity we\nattribute to the likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity\ngroup RedDelta targeting organizations within Europe and\nSoutheast Asia using a customized variant of the PlugX backdoor.\nSince at least 2019, RedDelta has been consistently active within\nSoutheast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam, but has also\nroutinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical\nevents. This is historically evident through the group’s targeting\nof the Vatican and other Catholic organizations in the lead-up to\n2021 talks between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican\n[officials [1,2], as well as throughout 2022 through the group’s](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)\nshift towards increased targeting of European government and\n[diplomatic entities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\n\nDuring the 3-month period from September through\nNovember 2022, RedDelta has regularly used an infection\nchain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger\na dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution\nchain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. Throughout\nthis period, the group repeatedly employed decoy documents\nspecific to government and migration policy within Europe.\nOf note, we identified a European government department\nfocused on trade communicating with RedDelta command-andcontrol (C2) infrastructure in early August 2022. This activity\ncommenced on the same day that a RedDelta PlugX sample\nusing this C2 infrastructure and featuring an EU trade-themed\ndecoy document surfaced on public malware repositories.\nWe also identified additional probable victim entities within\nMyanmar and Vietnam regularly communicating with RedDelta\nC2 infrastructure.\n\nRedDelta closely overlaps with public industry reporting\nunder the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, TA416,\nRed Lich, and HoneyMyte.\n\n\n#### Key Judgments\n\n  - RedDelta has consistently conducted long-term cyber\nespionage campaigns in line with the strategic interests\nof the Chinese government, including historical targeting\nof government and public sector organizations across\nAsia and Europe as well as overseas organizations\nassociated with minority groups within mainland China\nsuch as Tibetan and Catholic Church-related entities.\n\n  - Despite the volume of public reporting on the group’s\n\nactivity, RedDelta employs a high operational tempo\nrelative to other state-sponsored actors. The group also\nmaintains a rapid pace of development for its flagship\nbackdoor (remote access trojan [RAT]), a variant of the\nlong-running backdoor PlugX that is heavily customized\nfor anti-analysis for detection evasion.\n\n  - In November 2022, RedDelta actors shifted from using\n\narchive files to using malicious optical disc image (ISO)\nfiles containing a simplified shortcut (LNK) file for\ndelivery of an updated PlugX payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_[Figure 1: High-level RedDelta TTPs and Recorded Future data-sourcing graphic; historically reported TTPs are shown in gray [1,2] (Source: Recorded Future)](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\n**_Figure 2: Timeline of RedDelta activity from June 2020 to November 2022_**\n_(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nIn mid-2020, we [published research identifying RedDelta](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)\nintrusions targeting several Catholic Church-related\norganizations, including the Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of\nHong Kong. This activity took place in the lead-up to negotiations\nbetween Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican officials.\n[These findings were also later corroborated by NortonLifeLock.](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/sites/default/files/2021-10/OPERATION%20EXORCIST%20White%20Paper.pdf)\nIn addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic\nChurch, we also identified RedDelta network intrusions affecting\nlaw enforcement and government entities in India, a government\norganization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar,\nHong Kong, and Australia. In this activity the group used multiple\nmalware variants including a customized PlugX variant, Cobalt\nStrike, and Poison Ivy.\n\nShortly after the publication disclosing activity targeting\nthe Vatican, we [identified renewed RedDelta activity again](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations)\ntargeting Catholic Church-related organizations as well as an\nentity associated with the Tibetan community-in-exile. Other\nhigh-profile intrusions [conducted by RedDelta in 2020 include](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-african-union-cyber-exclusiv-idINKBN28Q1DB)\nthe compromise of the African Union.\n\n\nThroughout 2021, we observed continued RedDelta activity\ntargeting government organizations in Indonesia, Myanmar,\nand Vietnam. In late 2021 and early 2022, RedDelta targeting\nshifted back toward Europe and the group [began using decoy](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\ndocuments themed around escalating tensions between Russia\nand Ukraine, and eventually around the war itself, as disclosed\nwithin customer-facing Insikt Group research and public reporting\n[by Proofpoint, Secureworks, and ESET.](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\n\n#### Threat/Technical Analysis\n\n##### Infrastructure Analysis\n\nIn March 2022, we and other researchers reported on\nrenewed RedDelta activity targeting European government and\ndiplomatic organizations, in many cases using lure documents\n[centered on the war in Ukraine [1,](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european) [2,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/) [3]. Since this reporting,](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-russian-speakers-with-updated-plugx)\nwe have continued to observe similar activity targeting Europe,\n[some of which has been covered through Secureworks reporting.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-government-officials)\n\n\n-----\n\n[In contrast to historical activity, RedDelta has largely moved](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)\naway from use of domain names for C2 infrastructure toward\nhardcoded actor-controlled virtual private server (VPS) IP\naddresses. Since March 2022, the group has used a wide variety\nof autonomous systems (ASs), with a particular preference for\nthe following autonomous system numbers (ASNs):\n\n - GreenFloid — AS204957\n\n - Aptum Technologies — AS13768\n\n  - Input Output Flood LLC — AS53755\n\n - QuadraNet — AS8100\n\n - XNNET — AS6134\n\nIn many cases, the actor’s operational infrastructure on\nthe above ASNs was likely purchased through a China-based\nVPS reseller called Yun-LLC (vm[.]sg). We have also observed\nconsistent use of specific server responses and multiple reused\nTLS certificates since March 2022, some of which was referenced\n[in recent Blackberry reporting.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/12/mustang-panda-uses-the-russian-ukrainian-war-to-attack-europe-and-asia-pacific-targets)\n\n##### Victimology\n\nWe observed likely victims in Vietnam and Myanmar\ncommunicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure throughout\n2022, which aligns with the typical historical targeting of the\ngroup. We also identified multiple IP addresses associated with\na European government department focused on trade regularly\ncommunicating with the RedDelta C2 IP address 64.34.205[.]178\non August 9, 2022. On this date, we also observed a RedDelta\nPlugX phishing campaign featuring an EU trade-themed decoy\ndocument using this C2, which surfaced on public malware\nrepositories. We have not observed any further evidence of\ncompromise for this organization since this date.\n\n\n##### Malware Analysis\n\n Initial Infection Vector — August to October 2022\n\nThe infection vector used from August to October 2022\nremained largely unchanged from recent [Secureworks and](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-government-officials)\n[BlackBerry reporting covering RedDelta activity (tracked as](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims)\nBRONZE PRESIDENT by Secureworks researchers). In each\ncase, an archive file is delivered to the targeted user, likely via\nspearphishing, which contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) file\ndisguised using a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a\nMicrosoft Word icon. The archive also features a series of nested\nhidden folders that contain 3 files used within a DLL searchorder-hijacking triad: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader,\nand an encrypted PlugX payload that is ultimately loaded into\nmemory. Upon execution of the shortcut file, this executes the\nlegitimate binary vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking and\nalso displays a decoy document to the victim.\n\nThe observed RedDelta LNK files during this timeframe were\ncreated on a system with the hostname `desktop-n2v1smh,`\nwhich was previously [noted in earlier LNK files used by the](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-government-officials)\ngroup. In each case, the LNK file contains a similar argument\nto the example shown in Figure 5 in order to run the legitimate\nexecutable and start the DLL search-order-hijacking chain:\n```\n  “_\\___\\_\\___\\______\\_____\\__\\test11.\n\n```\nbpu||(forfiles /^P %USERPROFILE%\\ /S /^M\n“Political Guidance for the new EU approach\ntowards Russia.rar” /C “cmd /c (c:\\progra~1\\7Zip\\7z x -y -aoa @path||c:\\progra~2\\7-Zip\\7z x\n-y -aoa @path||c:\\progra~1\\winrar\\winrar x -id\n-o+ @path||c:\\progra~2\\winrar\\winrar x -id -o+ @\npath)&&_\\___\\_\\___\\______\\_____\\__\\test11.bpu”)”\n\n**_Figure 5: Example of command run by LNK file to trigger DLL search-order-hijacking chain_**\n_(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n**_Figure 3: LNK file masquerading as a .doc file due to use of a double extension and Microsoft Word icon (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n**_Figure 4: Nested hidden folder containing a legitimate executable (ClassicExplorerSettings.exe renamed as test.bpu), malicious DLL loader (ClassicExplorer32.dll), and encrypted_**\n_payload (ClassicExplorerLog.dat) (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Initial Infection Vector - November 2022\n\n**_Figure 6: Contents of ISO file “Unilateral statement by the Commission on migration.iso” used in_**\n_November 2022 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nThe LNK file in this case (Figure 8) was simplified compared\n\nIn November 2022, we identified new RedDelta activity\n\nto the one described in Figure 5 and no longer used previously\n\nusing a slightly altered infection chain. In this case an ISO file\n\nreported user metadata, likely in reaction to public reporting\n\ntitled “Unilateral statement by the Commission on migration.\n\nhighlighting this aspect.\n\n_iso” was served through the actor-controlled domain microsite-_\nmanager[.]com, which was hosted on IP address 5.34.182[.]68\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /q /c “System\n\nat the time of analysis. This IP address also concurrently hosted\n\nVolume Information\\ \\ \\ \\test.chs”\n\na probable additional RedDelta domain, mashupdatabase[.]com,\n\n**_Figure 8: Simplified LNK argument observed in November 2022 RedDelta activity (Source: Recorded_**\n\nwhich was registered through GoDaddy at the same time as _Future)_\nmicrosite-manager[.]com.\n\nSimilar to previously described activity, the ISO contained\nan LNK file and nested hidden folders titled System Volume\nInformation containing the DLL search-order-hijacking triad,\nas shown in Figure 6. Notably, in this case the System Volume\nInformation folder also contains a desktop.ini file featuring\na Class ID (CLSID) Key shortcut {F6B6E965-E9B2-444B-928610C9152EDBC5}, which corresponds to the File History utility in\nMicrosoft Windows. Interestingly, this folder is interpreted by File\nExplorer as a legitimate shortcut to File History, and redirects\nthe user to this utility rather than displaying the true malicious\ncontents of the folder that are executed using the LNK file.\n\n**_Figure 7: User is directed to File History navigator upon clicking System Volume Information folder,_**\n_rather than revealing a series of nested folders containing the PlugX DLL search-order-hijacking_\n_triad (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9: Nested_** _hidden folders of “System Volume Information” containing PlugX DLL search-order-_\n_hijacking triad (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### Use of European Government Trade- and Migration- Themed Decoy Documents\n\nIn all identified RedDelta samples observed from August to\nNovember 2022, the user was shown a decoy document specific\nto government and migration policy within Europe, including: an\nAustrian immigration program (Red-White-Red Card); a European\nUnion (EU) trade and migration policy; Serbia’s EU accession\napplication; and political guidance on the EU’s approach toward\nRussia. These samples ultimately load the group’s customized\nvariant of the PlugX backdoor. Notably, in at least one case the\ngroup appeared to have edited a publicly available document\n(the European Commission [Serbia Report 2022) to make it](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/serbia-report-2022_en)\nappear more sensitive. This included the inclusion of “SENSITIVE”\nand “need to know” distribution markings with the rest of the\ndocument remaining unchanged, despite the finalized version\nbeing publicly available at the time of the observed activity. We\npreviously [observed RedDelta using a similar tactic to mark a](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations)\npublicly available United Nations General Assembly report as an\n“Advanced Unedited Version”.\n\nIn each case, all the necessary components for loading the\nfinal payload are included within the initial container file. Earlier\nin 2022, the group [regularly](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/) [employed an interim stage where](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\na loader fetched all of these components from a remote actorcontrolled server. This loader step has been replaced by the\naforementioned use of LNK files and, more recently, by the use\nof archive files with an ISO file.\n\n\n-----\n\n8838\n\n**_Table 1: RedDelta samples observed from August to November 2022, all featuring Europe-themed filename lures and decoy documents. The use of the string “test” was observed frequently within_**\n_RedDelta filenames, PlugX config campaign IDs, and TLS certificates over this period.

Throughout 2022, we have identified RedDelta\noperators iterating and adding new defense evasion and antianalysis methods to the group’s customized PlugX variant at a\nrapid pace. Despite this, many elements of the group’s TTPs\nhave remained consistent over time.
