Since we](https://www.tesorion.nl/en/posts/a-decryptor-for-the-nemty-ransomware-based-on-analysis-of-its-cryptography/)\nperformed our analysis, two new versions of Nemty have appeared: version 1.5 and 1.6. We\nhave analyzed both and have been working on decryptors for them. As 1.6 is the most recent\nversion of the two, we have been focussing our efforts on this version first. We now have a\nworking decryptor for version 1.6. Please contact Tesorion CSIRT to obtain our decryptor for\nfree if you are a victim of Nemty 1.6. We are also finishing our decryptor for Nemty 1.5 and\nexpect to release it soon as well. Finally, we are working with Europol to get our decryptors\n[included in their NoMoreRansom project.](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\n\n_Update: Our universal decryptor for Nemty versions up to and including 1.6 is available for_\n_[download at the NoMoreRansom website.](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Nemty)_\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nIn our [blog post last week, we described some peculiarities of the cryptography used by the](https://www.tesorion.nl/en/posts/a-decryptor-for-the-nemty-ransomware-based-on-analysis-of-its-cryptography/)\nNemty ransomware up to version 1.4. These peculiarities involved bugs in the AES-256 key\nscheduling, and the implementation of the CBC block mode. Furthermore, we announced the\navailability of a free decryptor for Nemty victims through our CSIRT team. In this blog we\nannounce the availability of a free decryptor for Nemty 1.6, and the expected availability of a\nfree decryptor for Nemty 1.5 next week.\n\n## Recovering files for Nemty 1.4 and below\n\nSince our previous blog post, our CSIRT team has been very busy assisting numerous\nvictims of Nemty 1.4 and below with recovering their files for free. Furthermore, we have\nbeen improving our decryptor based on feedback from the victims who contacted us, and it\nshould by now be able to successfully decrypt a lot of files. We are working on automating\nthis process and expect to be able to release a decryptor soon that will no longer involve our\nCSIRT team. However, instead of waiting for the availability of our automated decryptor, we\ndecided last week to make our CSIRT team available to assist victims at no cost in the\nmeantime.\n\n## Nemty 1.5: stuck in the middle\n\nAfter finishing our research on Nemty 1.4 and below, a newer 1.5 version was spotted in the\nwild. The AES bugs of the 1.4 version are still present in this version, but there are some\nother minor differences that require some changes to our 1.4 decryption process. We have\nanalyzed Nemty 1.5 and have a proof-of-concept decryptor working for this version. Our\nteams are working on a solution that should enable 1.5 victims to recover many of their files\nfor free as well and hope to include this functionality in our free decryptor somewhere next\nweek.\n\n_Update: Nemty 1.5 is also suppored in our decryptor._\n\n## Nemty 1.6: a challenger appears\n\nAs discussed in our previous blog post, writing about the workings of a ransomware family\nwhile announcing a decryptor is bound to trigger some response by the malware authors.\nAnd as expected a new version of Nemty has appeared after we published our blog post that\ndescribed some peculiarities in the AES implementation of Nemty 1.4 and below. In the 1.6\nversion, the authors even acknowledge our work: the malware binary contains the literal\nstring “tesorion thanks for your article”!\n\nWe are glad they took our advice to heart and have moved away from their own AES\nimplementation and now simply use the default Windows cryptographic libraries instead. This\nmade our analysis of the cryptography in the 1.6 version a lot easier. We now no longer had\nto compare all the individual calculations in their AES implementation to the standard to find\nout why initially we could not decrypt any Nemty 1 4 encrypted files Our analysis indeed\n\n\n-----\n\nconfirms that Nemty 1.6 now uses a proper default AES-128-CBC implementation. Good\nwork guys, if everybody would just adhere to these standards, we’d all have more time for\nthe really fun things in life!\n\nBy the way, the mutex used in Nemty 1.6 also seems to indicate a certain light-hearted\nnature in the authors of the ransomware. The mutex in Nemty 1.6 is named “just_a_game”.\n\n## The best things in life are free: a free decryptor for Nemty 1.6\n\nAfter analyzing Nemty 1.6, we have constructed a decryptor that is able to decrypt many files\nencrypted by the Nemty 1.6 ransomware for free. And just like our previous decryptor for\nNemty 1.4 and below, we will make this one available for free to victims of the Nemty\nransomware.\n\nShort and to the point: If you are a victim of the Nemty ransomware version 1.6 or below,\nTesorion can probably help you recover many of your files for free.\n\n_[Update: Our decryptor is available for download at the NoMoreRansom website.](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Nemty)_\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nSHA256 of the Nemty 1.6 binary used in this research:\n98f260b52586edd447eaab38f113fc98b9ff6014e291c59c9cd639df48556e12\n\n[© 2022 Tesorion Cybersecurity Solutions.
