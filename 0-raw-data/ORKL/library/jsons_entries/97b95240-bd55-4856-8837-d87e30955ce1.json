The\nthreat actor systematically utilized software distributed by security vendors to sideload\n\n\n-----\n\n[ShadowPad and PlugX variants. Some of the activity partially overlaps with threat groups](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/shadowpad-a-masterpiece-of-privately-sold-malware-in-chinese-espionage/)\n[tracked by other vendors as RedFoxtrot and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redfoxtrot-china-pla-targets-bordering-asian-countries/) [Nomad Panda. We track this cluster of activity](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/nomad_panda)\nas ‘Moshen Dragon’.\n\nUsually, good detection has an inverse relationship with visibility of a threat actor’s TTPs.\nWhen part of an infection chain gets detected, it usually means that we don’t get to see what\nthe threat actor intended to deploy or ultimately do. In an unexpected twist, our detection\ncapabilities uncovered an unusual TTP as Moshen Dragon attempted to repeatedly bypass\nthat detection.\n\nEvery time the intended payload was blocked, we were able to witness the actor’s reliance\non a wide variety of legitimate software leveraged to sideload ShadowPad and PlugX\nvariants. Many of these hijacked programs belong to security vendors, including Symantec,\nTrendMicro, BitDefender, McAfee and Kaspersky.\n\nRather than criticize any of these products for their abuse by an insistent threat actor, we\nremind readers that this attack vector reflects an age-old design flaw in the Windows\nOperating System that allows DLL search order hijacking. Tracking of additional Moshen\nDragon loading mechanisms and hijacked software surfaced more payloads uploaded to\n[VirusTotal, some of which were recently published under the name ‘Talisman’.](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/plugx-a-talisman-to-behold.html)\n\nIn addition to ShadowPad and the PlugX Talisman variant, the Moshen Dragon deployed a\nvariety of other tools, including an LSA notification package to harvest credentials and a\n[passive loader dubbed GUNTERS by Avast. Despite all of this visibility, we are still unable to](https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/avast-finds-backdoor-on-us-government-commission-network/)\ndetermine their main infection vector. Their concerted efforts include the use of known\nhacking tools, red team scripts, and on-keyboard attempts at lateral movement and data\nexfiltration.\n\nWe will focus on the actor’s insistent abuse of different AV products to load malicious\npayloads in an attempt to ‘bruteforce’ infection chains that would go undetected by traditional\nSOC and MDR solutions.\n\n## Hijacking Security Products\n\nMoshen Dragon actors systematically abused security software to perform DLL search order\n[hijacking. The hijacked DLL is in turn used to decrypt and load the final payload, stored in a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\nthird file residing in the same folder. This combination is recognized as a sideloading triad, a\n[technique commonly associated with Lucky Mouse.](https://securelist.com/the-leap-of-a-cycldek-related-threat-actor/101243/)\n\nThe way the payloads were deployed, as well as other actions within target networks,\nsuggest the threat actor uses IMPACKET for lateral movement. Upon execution, some of the\npayloads will achieve persistence by either creating a scheduled task or a service.\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution flow of hijacked software as carried out by Moshen Dragon\nAs major portions of the Moshen Dragon activity were identified and blocked, the threat actor\nconsistently deployed new malware, using five different security products to sideload PlugX\nand ShadowPad variants.\n\nA summary of the hijacked software is presented in the table below:\n\n**Product** **Path**\n\n\nSymantec\nSNAC\n\nTrendMicro\nPlatinum\nWatch Dog\n\nBitDefender\nSSL Proxy\nTool\n\nMcAfee\nAgent\n\nKaspersky\nAnti-Virus\nLauncher\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\AppPatch, C:\\ProgramData\\SymantecSNAC,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Symantec\\SNAC, C:\\Windows\\Temp\n\nC:\\Windows\\ AppPatch\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\LfSvc,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WinMSIPC,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ClipSVC,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Wlansvc,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Ringtones\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\McAfee, C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc,\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\WinMSIPC\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\XboxLive, C:\\programdata\\GoogleUpdate\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lateral Movement Using Impacket\n\n[Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols, commonly](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\nutilized by threat actors for lateral movement. One of the favorite tools in the Impacket\narsenal is `wmiexec, which enables remote code execution via WMI. An effective way to`\nidentify `wmiexec execution is searching for the unique command line pattern it creates.`\nMoshen Dragon activities are rife with this pattern.\n\nLateral Movement utilizing Impacket as identified by the SentinelOne Agent\n\n## LSA Notification Package – SecureFilter\n\nWhen on domain controllers, Moshen Dragon dropped a password filter and loaded it into\nthe lsass process via LSA Notification packages. Impacket is used in the following manner:\n```\ncmd.exe /Q /c REG ADD \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\" /v \"Notification\nPackages\" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d \"rassfm\\0scecli\\0SecureFilter\" /f 1>\n\\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__[REDACTED] 2>&1\n\n```\nThe DLL deployed is dropped in the path `C:\\Windows\\System32\\SecureFilter.dll in`\n[order to enable loading using the Notification Package feature. The DLL seems to rely on an](https://pentestlab.blog/2020/02/10/credential-access-password-filter-dll/)\n[open source project named DLLPasswordFilterImplant, effectively writing changed user](https://github.com/GoSecure/DLLPasswordFilterImplant)\npasswords to the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\Filter log\n\n\n-----\n\nSnippet from SecureFilter.dll\n\n## GUNTERS – A Passive Loader\n\nDuring our analysis of Moshen Dragon’s activities, we came across a passive loader\npreviously discussed by Avast as ‘GUNTERS’. This backdoor appears to be highly targeted\nas it performs checks to verify that it is executed on the right machine.\n\nBefore execution, the malware calculates the hash of the machine hostname and compares\nit to a hardcoded value, suggesting that the threat actor generates a different DLL for each\ntarget machine.\n\nThe loader utilized `WinDivert to intercept incoming traffic, searching for a magic string to`\ninitiate a decrypting process utilizing a custom protocol. Following the decryption process,\nthe malware attempts to load a PE file with an exported function named\n```\nSetNtApiFunctions, which it calls to launch the payload.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nExported functions\n\nof an internal GUNTERS resource utilized in the loading process\n[A thorough analysis of the custom protocol and loading mechanism is available here.](https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/avast-finds-backdoor-on-us-government-commission-network/)\n\n## Additional Payloads\n\nSentinelLabs came across additional related artifacts overlapping with this threat cluster. It’s\npossible that some of those were utilized by Moshen Dragon or a related actor.\n\n\n**File**\n**name**\n\n\n**SHA1** **C&C**\n\n\nSNAC.log e9e8c2e720f5179ff1c0ac30ce017224ac0b2f1b freewula.strangled.net\nszuunet.strangled.net\n\nSNAC.log b6c6c292cbd35298a5f055448177bcfd5d0b23bf final.staticd.dynamicdns.net\n\nSNAC.log 2294ecbbb065c517bd0e01f3f01aabd0a0402f5a dhsg123.jkub.com\n\n\n-----\n\nbdch.tmp 7021a62b68751b7a3a2984b2996139aca8d19fec greenhugeman.dns04.com\n\nAfter analyzing these payloads, we found them to be additional PlugX and ShadowPad\nvariants. `SNAC.log payloads have been identified by other researchers as Talisman, which`\n[is known to be another variant of PlugX. In addition, the](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=21512304) `bdch.tmp payload was produced`\nby shellcode with a structure similar to ShadowPad malware but without the initial code\nobfuscation and decryption logic typically seen in ShadowPad.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlugX and Shadowpad have a well-established history of use among Chinese-speaking\nthreat actors primarily for espionage activity. Those tools have flexible, modular functionality\nand are compiled via shellcode to easily bypass traditional endpoint protection products.\n\nHere we focused on Moshen Dragon TTPs observed during an unusual engagement that\nforced the threat actor to conduct multiple phases of trial-and-error to attempt to deploy their\nmalware. Once the attackers have established a foothold in an organization, they proceed\nwith lateral movement by leveraging Impacket within the network, placing a passive\nbackdoor into the victim environment, harvesting as many credentials as possible to insure\nunlimited access, and focusing on data exfiltration.\n\nSentinelLabs continue to monitor Moshen Dragon activity as it unfolds.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Hijacked DLLs**\n\nef3e558ecb313a74eeafca3f99b7d4e038e11516\n3c6a51961aa328ba507796153234309a5e83bee3\nfae572ad1beab78e293f756fd53cf71963fdb1bd\n308ed56dc1fbc98b574f937d4b005190c878416f\n55e89f458b5f5642300dd7c50b444232e37c3fa7\n\n**Payloads**\n\ne9e8c2e720f5179ff1c0ac30ce017224ac0b2f1b\nb6c6c292cbd35298a5f055448177bcfd5d0b23bf\n2294ecbbb065c517bd0e01f3f01aabd0a0402f5a\n7021a62b68751b7a3a2984b2996139aca8d19fec\n\n**Password Filter**\n\nc4f1177f68676b770934b142f9c3e2c4eff7f164\n\n**GUNTERS**\n\n\n-----\n\nbb68816f324f2ac4f0d4756b66af67d01c8b6e4e\n4025e14a7f8928753ba06ad155944624069497dc\nf5b8ab4a7d9c723c2b3b842b49f66da2e1697ce0\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nfreewula.strangled[.]net\nszuunet.strangled[.]net\nfinal.staticd.dynamic-dns[.]net\ndhsg123.jkub[.]com\ngreenhugeman.dns04[.]com\ngfsg.chickenkiller[.]com\npic.farisrezky[.]com\n\n\n-----",
