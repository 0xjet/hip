So, first we will track any “regsvr32.exe” process that starts but never stops, on servers\n\nand workstations, using one real-time AIE correlation rule, that will spit out an Event\nflagged as Security: Suspicious and an Alarm.\n2. In parallel we’ll keep an eye on any outbound WebDav traffic, using a second real-time\n\nAIE correlation rule and generate a Security: Suspicious Event and an Alarm here too.\n3. Finally, we will corroborate all these correlations together and if they both occur on the\n\nmachine of someone who just received an inbound email with an RTF or Word\ndocuments attached, then raise a Security:Compromised Event as well as an Alarm.\n\n## Rule 1 detecting the (too) long running regsvr32 exe:\n\n\n-----\n\nTime line:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Settings:**\n\n## Rule 2, detecting outbound traffic using WebDav protocol:\n\n**Settings:**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Rule 3, corroborate all the above and check precedence of inbound RTF or DOC email attachments:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Time line:**\n\n**Settings:**\n\n\n-----\n\nEquipped with these little helpers, you should now be able to relax for this festive season\nwith the knowledge that any Inception style incursion into your workstations will be flagged.\n\nMoreover, you’ll be made aware of who in your organization is being targeted by the attack\nearly enough before any critical data is siphoned out.\n\nSources:\n\n\n-----",
