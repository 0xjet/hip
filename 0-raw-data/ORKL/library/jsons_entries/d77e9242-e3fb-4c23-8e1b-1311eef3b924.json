Over time, they switched to a custom\nversion that has been known as BitterRAT ever since.\n\nA Chinese security firm provided a timeline outlining\nthe evolution of the mobile version and placed the\nearliest-known version of Android Bitter in September\n2014 [5].\n\nThe oldest sample we have identified in our malware\nzoo is 448b8af1a6757aa5b827b382777ab3de, an\napplication called Misbaha, as indicated in [4]. It has\nthe internal zip file timestamp of 04 September 2014,\nwhich can be an indicator to support the assumption,\nbut a closer look at the signing certificate reveals a\nvalidity time of not before 28th Apr 2014. This date is\nusually one and the same with the date the certificate\nwas created and might indicate the first attack could\nhave begun months before anyone was even aware.\n\nIssuer: C=US, O=Android, CN=Android Debug\n\nValidity\n\nNot Before: Apr 28 07:05:23 2014 GMT\n\nNot After : Apr 20 07:05:23 2044 GMT\n\nBy 2016, the Bitter operators started creating their own\ncustom, more evolved RAT based on AndroRAT. Security\nresearchers named this variation SlideRAT [5]. The Bitter\nmalware was distributed via fake applications using\nelaborate phishing schemes, as well as a network of\ncompromised sites that were used to host the malware\nitself.\n\nPublicly known variations of fake applications that are\nimitated include Dawn News, jamat-ud-dawah, People’s\n**Liberation Army News APP,** **China-Super-VPN,** **Ansar**\n**Foundation,** **Anyou ID [5],** **Pornhub Premium [1] and**\n**Kashmir News [7].**\n\nInterestingly the threat actors have used Kashmir as\nbait in the past first in 2014 then in 2019 The 2014\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nthe newer version in 2019 (42c2d7aeb8a98df09c624a9605849927 [7]), is named Kashmir Hunt. Coincidence or not,\nthe years 2014 and 2019 both correspond to elections in the Kashmir region [8].\n\nIn our research, we have found previously unmentioned applications targeting religious groups by masquerading as True\n**Islam or Saima Eid related applications as well as more generic variations that imitate common applications such as:**\n**Voice Mail, chat, image viewers and WhatsApp activators. A version more oriented toward Chinese victims is distributed**\nas 蓝光手机防毒高级版本.apk (rough translation of Advanced version of antivirus for blue-light phone).\n\n\n**APK MD5s** **Package Name** **Distribution Name**\n\n\n**6d3dcb9ad491628488feb9de6e092144** com.nightstar.islam TrueIslam.apk\n\n**ea3b4cde5ef86acfe2971345a2d57cc0** display.Launcher voicemail.apk\n\n**cbb32c303d06aa4d2dba713936e70f5c** droid.pixels PrivateChat.apk\n\n**ee85b2657ca5a1798b645d61e8f5080c** com.secureImages.viewer.SlideShow ImageViewer360.apk\n\n**692ff450aec14aca235cd92e6c52a960** com.folder.image ImageView.apk\n\n**de931e107d293303dd1ee7e4776d4ec7** com.android.display 蓝光手机防毒高级版本.apk\n\n**d7c21a239999e055ef9a08a0e6207552** com.google.settings SaimaEidPics.apk\n\n**9edf73b04609e7c3dada1f1807c11a33** com.youtube.dwld WhatsAppActivation.apk\n\nThe 蓝光手机防毒高级版本 application was most likely used in the 2017 wave against the Chinese Government. The\nsample has its creation zip time stripped down, but the certificate Not Before Time indicates 3 Oct 2017 10:12:47 GTM.\nThis sample also has a slightly different code structure than others at that time. Another odd thing about it is that the\nindicated CnC (where it uploads the stolen information) points to http[:]//techfront.com[.]cn/js/gbuilder.\n```\nphp. The domain techfront[.]com[.]cn presumably belongs to a legitimate Chinese company [9]. \n\n```\nThe fact that this sample uploads exfiltrated data to that URL implies that the domain has hosted malware at some point.\nLikely, the web site was hacked and a malicious script was injected. The Bitter group has been known to hijack sites to\nhost their malware, but there is no account of a case where it would inject a script that acts as CnC.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\n## Distribution tactics\n\nOver the years, cross platform Android – Windows Bitter attribution has relied on the same domains being used by the\nmalware in both scenarios, as well as by victimology [1][4]. The Bitter threat group has been using ArtraDownloader for\nits Windows campaign [10] and AndroRAT variations for its Android campaigns.\n\nWorth mentioning is that the group has delivered malware for both Windows and Android via the same hacked sites.\n[For instance, the legitimate cultural website gandharaart[.]org, at this moment still hosts both the Windows and Android](http://www.gandharaart.org/news/lsasw)\nversion of the threat.\n\n\n**Distribution point** **Type**\n\n\n**[gandharaart.org/news/lsasw](http://www.gandharaart.org/news/lsasw)** Windows ArtraDownloader used by Bitter\n\n**[gandharaart.org/images/IM/ImageViewer360.apk](http://www.gandharaart.org/images/IM/ImageViewer360.apk)** Android AndroRAT variation used by Bitter\n\nThe attribution of ArtraDownloader to the Bitter APT group, as well as the presence of the Windows threat variation on\nthe gandharaart[.]org have been documented by several security-related organizations [10][6].\n\nOther BitterRAT distribution points, identified in previous research [1], are still active. One such distribution\npoint is `http[:]//spiceworld.rf[.]gd/Premium.php from which` **P-Hub Premium.apk (APK MD5:**\n```\n1d2e23effc225880cadb7ee56dff25cf) is still delivered. The site spiceworld.rf.gd appears to be a makeshift\n\n```\nwebpage.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nThe threat actors most likely created a basic site for use as a malware distribution point. It points to 185.27.134.139\n\n- a data center hosting several other sites. Over time this IP has hosted several distribution points for other threats,\ntargeting both Android and Windows.\n\nThe Bitter threat group is believed to operate out of a country in South Asia [6][12]. We attempted to confirm this by\nrunning the “timestamp test” as indicated by the APKs inner zip file time. For most samples, this information was stripped\nfrom the APK containers. Instead of the missing information, we used the certificate creation time of all certificates used\nto sign BitterRAT malware, as well as the zip file time for samples that did not have it stripped.\n\nWhen a certificate is generated, the GMT time is saved. To test the theory that the threat group is in a South Asian\ncountry, we added extra hours to match Indian Standard Time (UTC+05:30). Zip file time is local time, so no alteration\nwas needed.\n\nThe exact date was used and determined what day of the week it was at that time and plotted as shown further:\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\n**Build time plotted to Indian Standard Time**\n\nThe resulting chart indicates that Bitter APT threat group works predominantly from Monday to Friday and 09:00 to\n17:00. They avoid working on Saturdays and, on occasion, have been shown to do some work on Sundays.\n\nOther variations of time zones would also place their activity within regular business hours for an organization. If plotted\nagainst Pakistan Standard Time (GMT+5), we get the following (some points of the chart do not change because they\nwere local time when stored).\n\n**Build time plotted to Pakistan Standard Time**\n\nThese charts show that the Bitter APT threat group is working on a time zone that covers UTC+5 and UTC+6, which\nreinforce the idea that the group is somewhere in South Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\n## The Google Play invasion\n\nAnalysis of the sample `42c2d7aeb8a98df09c624a9605849927 (Kashmir_news.apk), which is an already known`\napplication attributed to the Bitter APT Group [7], led us to discover an alarming set of samples currently active on Google\nPlay.\n\nSigned with the same certificate and sharing the same package name (com.clocknews.update), we found the application\n[AlarmClockSlide at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clocknews.update](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clocknews.update)\n\nThe same developer, CreativeFox, has 5 other applications listed on Google Play Store.\n\nBesides the certificate connection between the BitterRATKashmir_news.apk and the AlarmClockSlide on Google Play,\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nexception, namely HardMicApp which has no BitterRAT correspondent). These applications do not have data-exfiltration\ncapabilities, but the APT threat group can easily weaponize them by delivering an update, for instance.\n\nNot all applications are signed with the same developer certificate, but the certificate strings are all variations and\nwordings of Karachi, Phase 3 DHA Clifton CreativeFox, Development, Developer.\n\n\n**Certificate strings**\n\n\nC=PK, ST=Karachi, L=75/6D Phase3 DHA Clifton Karachi Pakistan., O=CreativeFox pvt. ltd.,\nOU=Developer, CN=CreativeFox\n\nC=PK, ST=Karachi, L=75/6D Phase3 DHA Clifton, O=CreativeFox Pvt Ltd, OU=Development Unit,\nCN=CreativeFox\n\nC=PK, ST=Karachi, L=75/6D Phase 3 DHA Clifton, O=CreativeFox pvt.

Ltd., OU=Developer,\nCN=CreativeFox\n\nIt is worth mentioning that this type of polymorphing certificates was already used in the past by the Bitter APT group. Our\nanalysis concluded that the following samples, distributed during the 2017-2018 waves, also share a similar polymorphic\ncertificate structure.\n\n\n**Distribution** **Certificate creation time** **Certificate strings**\n\n\n**TrueIslam.apk** 2017.04.12 10:14 GTM C=31, ST=Nederland, L=Rotterdam, O=IntelliS,\nOU=IntelligentIslam, CN=Mark Reader\n\n**Image_Viewer.apk** 2018.06.09 11:00 GTM C=31, ST=Nederland, L=Rotterdam, O=IntelliJ,\nOU=Intelligent Image Viewer, CN=Mark Reader\n\n**voicemail.apk** 2017.12.12 9:10 GTM C=31, ST=Nederland, L=Rotterdam, O=IntelliErr,\nOU=IntelligentSilent, CN=George Michael\n\nAnalysis of the Google Play developer CreativeFox continues.\n\nAll websites and privacy pages of the applications point to thew64binautoclean[.]org domain. The domain was\nregistered on 2019-08-30 and expires on 2020-08-30. We also see that it runs the control panel (cpanel) addon.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nIt is obvious that some amount of importance and effort have been directed by the Bitter APT group into developing this\nsite.\n\nWhen further investigating the privacy policies for the applications we find the following:\n\n\n**Application** **Last updated on Play** **Privacy page**\n\n\n**CalendarSlide** 2019.09.11 https://creativefox.w64binautoclean.org/\n\n**ZeroCross** 2019.09.27 http://zerocros.w64binautoclean.org/privacy.html\n\n**CalculatorTool** 2019.11.14 https://w64binautoclean.org/calculatorslide/CalculatorSilent/\n\n**AlarmClock** 2019.11.30 https://w64binautoclean.org/AlarmClock/privacy.html\n\n**HardMicApp** 2020.02.11 https://w64binautoclean.org/creativefox/HomoPhonic/privacy.html\nAs a side note, the oldest application, CalendarSlide, was uploaded to Google Play less than 2 weeks after the domain\nwas registered.\n\nThe threat group is known to target Pakistani officials, among others. There are some indicators in the code of the\napplications and on the Google Play pages related to the CreativeFox author, that support the assumption that these\napplications were made to mainly target Pakistani victims.\n\nThe developer lists the address in Pakistan, and we found strings corresponding to all 5 Islamic prayer times Fajr,\nDhuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha [11] in the HardMicApp application stored in a variable called Prayers. Although they\nare not used, we believe the developers initially wanted to create an Islamic Prayers application,as the strings are\nfound with the Alarm suffix: “FajrAlarm”, “DhuhrAlarm”, “AsrAlarm”, “MaghribAlarm”, “IshaAlarm”. This would hint at\nfunctionality for setting up a reminder for prayer time. Eventually the developers chose to develop a recording app, but\nforgot the strings inside the new app.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\n### AlarmClockSlide\n\nThe indicated malicious version is unlikely to be the exact one to replace the clean app, given that they share the same\nversion code and Google Play developers are required to increment it with each update, but that is easily fixable. Both\nare signed with the same developer certificate (certificate SHA1: c484368c8900627dcc549f5e494a9bf9ec0b35e0)\n\n\n`3f1e5cb139b50e6cfe2efa583ded83ed` com.clocknews.update 1 1.0 Clean on Play\n\n`42c2d7aeb8a98df09c624a9605849927` com.clocknews.update 1 1.0 Bitter malware\n\n\n### CalculatorTool\n\nBoth the clean version and the weaponized version are signed with the same certificate.

For example, blitzchatlog.ddns[.]net/Hide/\n**displayLink.php servers the following message:**\n\n**blitzchatlog.ddns[.]net/Hide/displayLinkfacebook.php servers the following message:**\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nThose variations of Bitter that connect to this domain uses these displayLink services to determine their behavior. For\nexample, (ea3b4cde5ef86acfe2971345a2d57cc0) on start will connect to Hide/displayLink.php. If the first line of\nthe output contains a display (it does) it will show a toast with the second line (Welcome) and open the third line (www.\nfacebook.com).\n\nWe believe /Islam/true.php and /Hide/silent.php serve the same purpose. These are used as exfiltration points where\nBitterRAT would upload information stolen from victims, with each URL possibly corresponding to a different threat\ncampaign. The CnCs also keep track of a victim using the phone’s IMEI and the SIM number as a makeshift user ID when\ncontacting such exfiltration points.\n\n_An example of a POST request made to the server:_\n```\nblitzchatlog.ddns[.]net/Hide/silent.php?IMEI=123412341234123&SIMNO=12345678901234567890\n\n```\nThe following image shows the Bitter IP – domain mapping.\n\n### A bitter landscape (telemetry)\n\nThe group usually targets important figures and organizations from Asian countries, Pakistan and China being among their most\ncommon targets. [1][3] Our telemetry readings indicate the presence of BitterRAT in Asia, with most scans coming from China, Hong\nK d Si\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\n### A bitter arsenal...\n\nBitter APT group initially started using AndroRAT as their Android malware (similar to how ArtraDownloader is used for\nthe Windows platform). Over time they changed to a custom version, which we have named BitterRAT (other security\nresearchers prefer the name SlideRAT[5]).\n\nBitterRAT has several modules tailored for spying and stealing personal user information. A full version can exfiltrate\ninformation such as:\n\n- calls recordings\n\n- call history\n\n- SMS messages\n\n- location\n\n- accounts\n\n- device specific information\n\n- installed applications list\n\n- documents and files\n\n- WhatsApp messages and call logs\n\n- BBM messaging app (former BlackBerry messenger)\n\nA more in-depth analysis is focused on APK 0e1db2219402ec254b150a4f6d8b0b02, ChitChatBox application. This\napplication was signed with an apparent debug certificate and had un-obfuscated code.\n\n**Cert generation time** **Certificate strings**\n\nAug 30 07:50:23 2019 GMT CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US\n\nWe believed it was somehow, unintentionally, leaked by the authors.\n\nThis version has the CnC at mypicks4u[.]com/chitchatbox/chitchat.php\n\n[The malware code is shipped together with an older version of the open source Conversations Android chat application.](https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations)\n\nWhen opening the application for the first time, the user is greeted by a screen to verify their phone number. Verification\nis done using a standard 2FA API (phone number is not leaked here).\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nAfter the phone number verification succeeds, the user gets redirected to the ConversationsActivity, which is also present\nin the open source application. However, in this version, the code is modified to request accessibility permissions for\nmalicious purposes.\n\nThe user can’t continue unless the requested permission is granted.\n\nBy analyzing the Config class, we can see that the malware authors changed the email address under the variable\nBUG_REPORTS to support[@]chaatchitt.com. The legitimate chat application has a different email address there.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nThe chaatchitt.com domain was registered on 2019-08-21 and a DNS SOA record links it with the email vera_ariel1992[@]\n**protonmail.com.**\n\nWhile the authors decided to include a lot of Android libraries that aren’t used, the malware code is conveniently placed\nin the eu.blitz.conversations.runner package, a package that does not exist in the open source version of Conversations.\n\nOne of its specialized exfiltration modules can steal the user’s WhatsApp and BBM (former BlackBerry messenger)\nmessages using the phone’s accessibility features (ExtractionManager.Accessibility). As far as we can tell, the fact that\n**_Bitter group targets BBM messaging application has not been previously disclosed. Although BBM was discontinued in mid-_**\n2019 [2], it is apparently still used by Bitter’s victims of interest often enough to have it targeted.\n\nThe WhatsApp module is slightly more advanced, as it keeps track of all the user’s voice and video call logs, making it\npossible to exfiltrate them later.\n\nOne of the modules (ResourceChannelRecord) can record with the user’s phone microphone, which gets turned on\nwhenever the user receives or makes a call. Voice recordings of the calls are then exfiltrated to the server.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nWith regards to the exfiltration module that siphons device information (ResourceCMCASA), among data that is usually\ncollected (network details, IMEI, mobile phone number and others) we see that the Bitter group is also interested in\nlearning whether the victim is in Roaming mode and discovering their Voice Mail Number.\n\n_We have already identified a sample that is distributed as voicemail.apk; Voice Mail Number may be of a higher importance_\n_than previously thought, and the fact that roaming information is collected indicates that Bitter APT group is particularly_\n_interested if their targets are currently abroad._\n\nAnother interesting module (ResourceFindexFetch) scans the device for files - more specifically for .pdf, .txt, .xml, .doc,\n**.jpg, .gif, .png, .bmp, .xls, .webp, .amr, .docx, .apk, .reco - and uploads metadata information to the server. The server**\ncan also request a specific file from the device to be uploaded if it is considered of interest.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nBitterRAT samples usually have the server address hardcoded inside files. Newer versions are instructed to retrieve the\nCnC from a Firebase database.\n\nVersion ImageView.apk (692ff450aec14aca235cd92e6c52a960) retrieves the CnC from the Firebase URL simple**chat-9b74d.firebaseio.com.**\n\nBecause of improper configuration of the Firebase database, the entire content could be dumped. The only CnC domain\navailable is flashnewsservice.org.\n\n{“domain”: {“url”:”https://flashnewsservice[.]org/CloudVault/”}}\n\nThe domain has already been attributed to the Bitter APT campaign [1], although a corresponding sample connecting to\nit and the firebase behavior was previously undocumented.\n\nCertificate creation time indicates January 2020 as the creation time. This is the newest sample we have obtained,\nalthough it is not the most complex.\n\n**Cert creation time** **Certificate strings**\n\n**Jan 3 08:43:26 2020 GMT** CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US\n\nAll BitterRAT samples share a similar structure in terms of overall exfiltration components and utilities, except for one:\n```\n9edf73b04609e7c3dada1f1807c11a33 (distributed as WhatsAppActivation.apk). This application, despite sharing\n\n```\nits CnC with two other “classic” samples with spyware abilities, has an entirely different, underdeveloped structure, which\nhints that it might be another test app leaked by the malware author by mistake.\n\nAnother interesting observation: voicemail.apk has an inner package named TODOFeatures. This package name is the\nsame module responsible for exfiltrating WhatsApp and BBM messages and call logs in newer versions.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage Tool\n\nThere are code similarities between the versions currently on Play, even without the exfiltration capabilities.\n\n- The ZeroCross application shares a component with the same java package name as the malicious ChitChatBox.\n\n- HardMicApp, a sound recording application, has a lot in common with ChitChatBox; 32% of ChitChatBox’s code base\nis found in HardMicApp (where it accounts for 48% of the app).\nBesides some commonly used shared libraries, they also share the SecurityManager class, a wrapper over shared\npreferences. This class contains a Prayers array of strings corresponding to all 5 Islamic prayer times; Fajr, Dhuhr,\nAsr, Maghrib and Isha [11]. The array is not used in this version of the application.\n\nAnother common package among HardMicApp, ChitChatBox BitterRAT and the ImageView.apk BitterRAT is the otp\npackage, which contains the RequestPhoneActivity and VerifyPhoneActivity components. In all mentioned versions,\nthis package contains ChitChatBox references, e.g. “eu.blitz.conversations.phone”.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitterAPT Revisited: the Untold Evolution of an Android Espionage
