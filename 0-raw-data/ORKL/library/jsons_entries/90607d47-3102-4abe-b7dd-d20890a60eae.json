Do not respawn!\n\n**welivesecurity.com/2022/01/18/donot-go-do-not-respawn/**\n\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\nESET researchers take a deep look into recent attacks carried out by Donot Team throughout 2020 and 2021,\ntargeting government and military entities in several South Asian countries\n\nESET researchers take a deep look into recent attacks carried out by Donot Team throughout 2020 and 2021,\ntargeting government and military entities in several South Asian countries\n\nDonot Team (also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02) is a threat actor operating since at least 2016 and known\nfor targeting organizations and individuals in South Asia with Windows and Android malware. A recent report by\nAmnesty International links the group’s malware to an Indian cybersecurity company that may be selling the\nspyware or offering a hackers-for-hire service to governments of the region.\n\nWe have been closely following the activities of Donot Team, and have traced several campaigns that leverage\nWindows malware derived from the group’s signature [yty malware framework. According to our findings, the](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia)\ngroup is very persistent and has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two years.\n\nIn this blogpost, we document two variants of the malware used in recent campaigns – DarkMusical and Gedit.\nFor each of the variants, we analyze the whole attack chain and provide insight into how the group updates its\ntools, tactics, and techniques.\n\n## Targets\n\nThe campaigns of Donot Team are motivated by espionage, using their signature malware: the “yty” malware\nframework, whose main purpose is to collect and exfiltrate data. According to our telemetry, Donot Team\nfocuses on a small number of targets in South Asia – Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal – as seen in\nFigure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Countries targeted in recent Donot Team campaigns_\n\nThese attacks are focused on:\n\nGovernment and military organizations\nMinistries of Foreign Affairs\nEmbassies\n\nGoing as far as targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the Middle East, Europe, North\nAmerica, and Latin America, is also not outside Donot Team’s realm.\n\n## Try, try, try again\n\nIt’s not a rarity for APT operators to attempt to regain access to a compromised network after they have been\nejected from it. In some cases this is achieved through the deployment of a stealthier backdoor that remains\nquiet until the attackers need it; in other cases they simply restart their operation with new malware or a variant\nof the malware they used previously. The latter is the case with Donot Team operators, only that they are\nremarkably persistent in their attempts.\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, Donot Team has been consistently targeting the same entities with waves of\nspearphishing emails with malicious attachments every two to four months. Interestingly, emails we were able to\nretrieve and analyze did not show signs of spoofing. Some emails were sent from the same organizations that\nwere being attacked. It’s possible that the attackers may have compromised the email accounts of some of their\nvictims in earlier campaigns, or the email server used by those organizations.\n\nWith spearphishing emails, the attackers use malicious Microsoft Office documents to deploy their malware. We\nhave seen Donot Team using at least three techniques. One is macros in Word, Excel and PowerPoint\ndocuments, such as the example seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Malicious macro in a PowerPoint document that drops a downloader executable and creates a scheduled task to_\n\n_run it_\n\nThe second technique is RTF files with .doc extensions that exploit memory corruption vulnerability\n[CVE‑2017‑11882 in Equation Editor, shown in Figure 3. These RTF documents also contain two embedded](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2017-11882)\nDLLs as OLE objects (see Figure 4) that are used to install and download further components (both DLLs are\ndescribed in the Gedit section). This allows the attackers to execute shellcode and requires no user interaction.\nThe shellcode deploys the main components of the malware.\n\n_Figure 3. CLSID of the COM object used by the RTF document to load the Equation Editor; the ensuing OLE object_\n\n_contains the CVE‑2017‑1182 exploit_\n\n_Figure 4. The OLE object headers of the DLLs also embedded in the RTF document_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The third technique is remote RTF template injection, which allows the attackers to have a payload downloaded](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/injection-new-black-novel-rtf-template-inject-technique-poised-widespread)\nfrom a remote server when the RTF document is opened. This is achieved by inserting a URL in the optional\n\\*\\template control word of the RTF file format, instead of the location of a local file resource. The payload that\nDonot Team uses is another document that exploits CVE-2017-11882 and is loaded automatically once it is\ndownloaded. This is shown in Figure 5.\n\n_Figure 5. When Word opens an RTF file with a remote template, it automatically attempts to download the resource_\n\n## The yty malware framework\n\n[Discovered by NetScout in 2018, the yty malware framework is a less sophisticated and poorly developed](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia)\nsuccessor to an older framework called EHDevel. The yty framework consists of a chain of downloaders that\nultimately download a backdoor with minimal functionality, used to download and execute further components of\nDonot Team’s toolset.\n\nThese include file collectors based on file extension and year of creation, screen capturers, keyloggers, reverse\nshells, and more. As seen in Figure 6, components for exfiltration gather the collected intelligence from staging\nfolders and upload every file to a designated server used only for this purpose.\n\n_Figure 6. Component that resolves the folder name for staging JPEG screenshots (left) and exfiltration component that_\n\n_finds all files in the staging folder (right)_\n\nStaging folder names and locations are changed with almost every new campaign, as well as some of the\ncomponents’ filenames. However, there are cases in which the names of components have remained\nunchanged, for example: gedit.exe, wuaupdt.exe, lmpss.exe, disc.exe, among others. As seen in Figure 7, it\nseems that for every new campaign, in order to set new paths and filenames, these values must be changed in\nthe source code and then recompiled, as none of these components use a configuration block or file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Encrypted strings containing locations and filenames that are regularly changed (top) and unencrypted values_\n\n_used in constructing the C&C URL (bottom)_\n\nThe malware uses scheduled tasks for persistence, and alternates between DLL and EXE files between\ncampaigns. In the case of DLLs, scheduled tasks execute rundll32.exe to load them and execute one of the\nexported functions.\n\nThe developers of the yty framework primarily rely on the C++ programming language. Likely in an attempt to\nevade detection, they have also ported their components to other languages such as VBScript, Python\n(packaged with PyInstaller), Visual C#, and AutoIt, among others. However, since 2019 we have only seen them\nleveraging components programmed in C++ (Figure 8) and Go (Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 8. Decompiled code of the component that captures screenshots, originally written in C++_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Decompiled code of the component that captures screenshots, for the version written in Go_\n\nThe malware sometimes uses two or three servers during its deployment. It might use one server during its\nchain of downloaders and a different server that the backdoor contacts in order to receive its commands and\ndownload further components, or use the same server for both purposes. A different server is always used for\nthe upload of collected information. In some attacks Donot Team has reused C&C domains from previous\nattacks – both for downloads and exfiltration. As seen in Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12, these components\n– later described as a variant we track as DarkMusical – used in the same attack, employed three different C&C\ndomains.\n\n_Figure 10. The first downloader decrypts the URL of the server from which it downloads the next stage of the chain_\n\n_Figure 11. In later stages, the backdoor uses a different server for C&C communications_\n\n_Figure 12. The exfiltration components use yet a third server to upload the collected files_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Timeline of attacks\n\nHere we describe the malware variants used in recent Donot Team campaigns, with a focus on their Windows\nmalware, starting from September 2020 until October 2021. For clarity, we have separated them into two\nvariants of the yty malware framework: Gedit and DarkMusical, with one specific campaign using Gedit that we\nnamed Henos.\n\nIn Figure 13, we present a timeline, according to our telemetry, of the attacks. Also on our timeline we have\nincluded attacks from another variant, known as the “Jaca framework”. However, we will not describe it here as\n[it has been described extensively in this report by CN-SEC.](http://cn-sec.com/archives/396285.html)\n\n_Figure 13. Timeline of Donot Team attacks from September 2020 to October 2021 according to ESET telemetry_\n\n### DarkMusical\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, the first wave of attacks where this variant was used occurred in June 2021,\ntargeting military organizations in Bangladesh. We were only able to recover its chain of downloaders and its\nmain backdoor. Given the small number of victims, we believe this might have been a highly targeted attack.\n\nIn September, a second wave of attacks that targeted military organizations in Nepal used new C&C servers\nand file and staging folder names. We were able to recover a number of components downloaded by the\nbackdoor, so we have decided to describe these attacks instead.\n\nSpearphishing emails were sent with PowerPoint documents containing a macro that deploys the first\ncomponent of a chain of downloaders and persists using a scheduled task. When potential victims open these\ndocuments, they will be presented with a fake error message, as seen in Figure 14, and the documents will\nremain devoid of any visible content.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Screenshot of a blank, malicious PowerPoint document_\n\nAs seen in Figure 15, the chain of downloaders aims to download a final component that works as a backdoor\nwith minimal functionality: it downloads standalone components, executes them using the ShellExecute\nWindows API, get and saves new C&C URLs.\n\nThe backdoor downloads the components that handle the collection and exfiltration of information to a dedicated\nserver. These components do not communicate with the backdoor or the C&C to report on their activities –\nrather, they use a designated folder for the staging of the data, and a separate exfiltration component will collect\neverything and upload it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15. Observed chain of compromise for DarkMusical_\n\nWe decided to call this campaign DarkMusical because of the names the attackers chose for their files and\nfolders: many are western celebrities or characters in the movie High School Musical. Table 1 briefly describes\nthe purpose of each of the components in the chain of compromise.\n\n_Table 1. Components in the DarkMusical campaign chain of compromise_\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\nrihana.exe\n\nThis executable is dropped by the malicious document to %public%\\Music\\rihana.exe and\npersistence established via a scheduled task called musudt.\n\nDownloads file to %public%\\Music\\acrobat.dll and drops a BAT file to\n%public%\\Music\\sidilieicaliei.bat.\n\nThe BAT file calls schtasks.exe to create the hmomci scheduled task to execute\nrundll32.exe %public%\\Music\\acrobat.dll, nikioioeioolla.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\nacrobat.dll\n\nDownloads file and saves it as %public%\\Music\\swift\n\nAdditionally, can issue a systeminfo.exe command whose output is redirected to\n%public%\\Music\\justin.

Since then, Donot Team moved on to focus on targets in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The\nmalware is clearly derived from the yty malware framework, but it is distinct enough to be separated from\nDarkMusical.\n\nWe were able to retrieve a spearphishing email corresponding to a Gedit campaign that occurred in February of\n2021, which is shown in Figure 16. The first attachment contained a list of personnel from a military entity in\nBangladesh (and no malicious content). The second attachment showed nothing but a blank page, while\nexecuting malicious code.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Screenshot of a spearphishing email sent by the attackers_\n\nWe can see that the size of the second file is greater than 2 MB. It is an RTF file that exploits [CVE-2017-11882](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2017-11882)\nto drop two DLL files contained in the document and execute one of them. Other components are downloaded\nto the compromised computer in various stages. An overview of this attack chain and its malware components is\nshown in Figure 17.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. Chain of compromise in Gedit campaigns_\n\nThe components were coded in Go, and C++ (with MinGW and Visual Studio compilers). We have chosen to\ndescribe the components used in that campaign in February 2021, which are shown in Table 3.\n\n_Table 3. Description of components for Gedit variant_\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\n\nvbtr.dll\n\nmsdn022.dll\n\n\nMoves the file %TEMP%\\bcs01276.tmp to %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\msdn022.dll\n\nCreates a scheduled task MobUpdate to execute rundll32.exe\n%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\msdn022.dll,iorpiyhduj\n\nDownloads a file to %APPDATA%\\mscx01102 (later renamed to Winhlp.exe).\n\nWrites and executes %APPDATA%\\test.bat, which:\n\n- Writes <COMPUTERNAME>-<RANDOM_NUMBER> to %USERPROFILE%\\Policy\\enus\\Files\\wizard\n\n- Creates the scheduled task TaskUpdate to execute\n%USERPROFILE%\\inf\\boost\\OOO\\nprint.exe\n\n- Creates the scheduled task MachineCore to execute\n%USERPROFILE%\\Cursor\\Size\\Dates\\Winhlp.exe\n\n\nWinhlp.exe Downloads a file to %USERPROFILE%\\inf\\boost\\OOO\\nprint.exe (if it doesn’t exist or its size\nis less than 50 kB).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\nnprint.exe\n\nSends a request to a server and depending on the reply, three actions can be performed:\n\n        - If qwertyuiop is in the reply headers, then a file is downloaded to\n%USERPROFILE%\\Policy\\en-us\\Active\\<FILENAME>, where <FILENAME> is also read from\nthe headers\n\n        - If asdfghjklzx is in the reply headers, then it tries to execute\n%USERPROFILE%\\Policy\\en-us\\Active\\wuaupdt.exe\n\n        - If zxcvbnmlkjhgfd is in the reply headers, then it tries to execute\n%USERPROFILE%\\Policy\\en-us\\Active\\test.bat\n\nIf a file %USERPROFILE%\\Policy\\en-us\\Files\\wizard exists, then the URL of the server is\nretrieved from there and used instead of the one included in the executable.\n\nwuaupdt.exe Reverse shell.\n\nlmpss.exe Takes screenshots and saves them, in an infinite loop, to\n%USERPROFILE%\\Remote\\Desk\\Apps\n\n\ninnod.exe\n\ngedit.exe\n\n\nFile collector.

Michele Ruiz.\n\nIt creates a system event aaaaaaaaa to make sure that only one instance of the component is\nrunning at a time.\n\n\n## Henos campaign\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning a wave of attacks that occurred between February and March 2021, targeting\nmilitary organizations in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. These attacks used the Gedit variant of the malware, but\nwith some minor modifications. Therefore, we decided to name this campaign Henos in our timeline, after its\nbackdoor DLL – henos.dll.\n\nSamples belonging to components of this wave of attacks were also reported online in February, which probably\n[explains why the group didn’t use the components again (see this tweet by Shadow Chaser Group researchers,](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1365304023775989761)\nfor example).\n\nAlthough we didn’t find the corresponding spearphishing emails or malicious documents, the attack chain is\npresumably the same as we described above, with some minor differences in how the components are\nexecuted. An overview of this is shown in Figure 18.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18. Chain of compromise of the Henos campaign_\n\nWhile some of the components of this campaign are named javatemp.exe and pytemp.exe, these filenames\nwere probably only chosen in an attempt to mimic legitimate software such as Java or Python. While\npytemp.exe and plaapas.exe were coded in the Go language, javatemp.exe was coded in C++ (compiled with\nMinGW).\n\nOne final note is that the component that performs exfiltration of files, pytemp.exe, performs a check to see if\ngedit.exe is running. If two or more instances are found, it exits. We believe this is a mistake by the\nprogrammers, as it should check for pytemp.exe instead. However, this simple mistake helps us tie the Henos\ncampaign to the Gedit variant of the malware (added to code similarity).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDonot Team makes up for its low sophistication with tenacity. We expect that it will continue to push on\nregardless of its many setbacks. Only time will tell if the group evolves its current TTPs and malware.\n\n_For any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at threatintel@eset.com._\n\n##
