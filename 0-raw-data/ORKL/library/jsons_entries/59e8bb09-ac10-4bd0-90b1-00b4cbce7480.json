Diagram showing how the BEC scam is carried out\nThe highly anonymous and often secretive nature of the internet has led to the proliferation\nof scams aimed at separating people and organizations from their money. Trend Micro has\nbeen following these scams over the years and have seen many of them evolve from\nsimplistic schemes to more sophisticated campaigns. One of the most dangerous scams\n[today — one which cost organizations a combined US$1.7 billion in exposed losses in 2019](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/trend-micro-cloud-app-security-report-2019)\n— is Business Email Compromise (BEC).\n\n[We have already tackled a large number of BEC-related topics. In this article, however, we](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/ph/security/news/business-email-compromise)\nwould like to raise awareness about a new modus operandi involving a very clever BEC\ncampaign that uses social engineering to target a huge number of French companies across\ndifferent industries.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile investigating various BEC attacks, we found an isolated incident where malicious\nactors impersonated a French company in the metal fabrication industry, which provides its\nservices to a lot of different companies.\n\nThe malicious actors behind the scam registered a domain that is very similar to the\nlegitimate one used by the business (with the fake one having a misspelled company name)\nand used it to send emails to their targets. The fraudulent domain was registered on July 27,\n2020, and the perpetrators sent the fraudulent email on the same day.\n\nThe email, which was impersonating a real employee of the company, contained a request\nasking the targets to change the company’s banking reference to a new account with an\nItalian bank.\n\nFigure 2. Screenshot of the email containing a request to change the target company’s\nbanking reference to a new account in an Italian bank. A rough translation of the email:\n“Following a banking account change, please find our new banking references (mail and\nBank Identifier Code) attached, which we kindly ask you to update in your files. Thank you\nfor your understanding. Please confirm the reception of this email and confirm the handling\nof our request (very urgent!)\nThe email contained two PDF file attachments. The first one was a letter to confirm the\nchange, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Letter confirming the changes in the company’s bank reference. The PDF file looks\nvery professional and even contains the real footers and logos from the impersonated\ncompany.\nMeanwhile, the second PDF file shows the banking account reference number:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. The PDF file showing the new banking reference account\nNote that as soon as we noticed the scam, we reached out to the targeted company (who\nwas incredibly responsive) and worked with them to prevent it from affecting their\norganization. In addition, they had filed a complaint and reached out to the Italian bank to\nstop the fraud attempt.\n\nInitial investigation\n\nWe found references on the company website showing that the alleged sender of the\nfraudulent email is an actual employee of the target company. However, instead of working in\nthe accounting department, as seen in the email, the person actually worked as a\nwebmaster. It’s possible that the fraudsters chose a random person based on the information\nthey found prior to their scheme and decided to use it for their operation.\n\nInterestingly enough, the fraudsters committed several mistakes:\n\nThey forgot to change the target name in the header of the email content, therefore\nleaking the name of another target. A perceptive employee could potentially identify\nthis as something unusual, which raises red flags.\nWe found another version of the PDF file that revealed the account being used for the\nbank reference change had the name of an individual and was not registered under the\nname of the target company.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. The PDF file showing the banking account reference. However, instead of showing\nthe target company as the owner of the account, it shows the name of a person.\nWe investigated the name shown on the account but did not find any useful information other\nthan the fact that this name is used mostly in the Ivory Coast in Africa.\n\nDelving deeper into the scam\n\nThe email address used to register the fraudulent domain has been used to register several\nother domains since 2019, all of them showing similar names to legitimate French company\ndomains, but again with slight errors here and there (for example using “techrnologies”\ninstead of “technologies).\n\n**Domain** **Creation Date**\n\n**eltn[.]fr** 8/23/2019\n\n**chnonopost[.]fr** 9/30/2019\n\n**sfrbiz[.]fr** 11/24/2019\n\n**ouflook[.]fr** 12/9/2019\n\n**carre-haussrmann[.]fr** 12/10/2019\n\n**4a-archifectes[.]fr** 1/16/2020\n\n**harribeyconstuctions[.]fr** 2/5/2020\n\n\n-----\n\n**stanvwell[.]r** 5/28/2020\n\n**paretsarl[.]fr** 6/17/2020\n\n**tkl-consutling[.]fr** 6/29/2020\n\n**axa-etancheite[.]fr** 7/1/2020\n\n**garantiesdesdepots[.]fr** 7/6/2020\n\n**jacormex[.]fr** 7/14/2020\n\n**harribeyconsstructions[.]fr** 7/15/2020\n\n**transportcazaux[.]fr** 7/17/2020\n\n**atg-techrnologies[.]fr** 7/22/2020\n\n**cephii.eu** 7/27/2020\n\n**efiiltec[.]fr** 7/27/2020\n\n**benne-rci[.]fr** 7/28/2020\n\n**soterm[.]fr** 7/29/2020\n\n**phamasys[.]fr** 7/31/2020\n\n**huuaume.fr** 08/05/2020\n\n**larm-inox[.]fr** 8/13/2020\n\nTable 1. Domains registered using the email address\n\nThe email address used did not seem to have been compromised and was probably created\nby the malicious actors themselves.Table 1. Domains registered using the email address\n\n\n-----\n\nThis list also reveals that the attackers are targeting a wide swath of industries, probably in\nan opportunistic manner. While we could not confirm that all of these domains have been\nused to commit BEC fraud, we did find at least one additional case in which the fraudsters\ntargeted an organization that was part of the healthcare industry.\n\n## Impersonating the French tax system\n\nIn many BEC schemes, the perpetrators infect the machines of their targets with malware\nthat will allow them to read — and therefore gather information — from emails. Once the\ncybercriminals gain access to the mailboxes of their targets, they search for material on the\npeople involved with the organization's finance and accounting departments. In addition, the\nattackers also look for information on the company’s customers and partners. Using this\nmethod, BEC scammers can then impersonate an employee to entice a victim to carry out\ntheir goals via social engineering.\n\nThis is BEC as we usually know it. We found evidence that the cybercriminals involved in this\ncase had used malware as well, but ultimately, they did not really even need it. Instead, they\nused an alternative — and admittedly clever —  method of hunting for their target’s\nfinancial data themselves.\n\nWith the help of the organization that the scam targeted, we were able to determine the initial\napproach the cybercriminals used: they presented their emails to appear as if it was from\nthe French tax system to gather information on their target. A little over two weeks before the\nregistration of the fake domain, the attackers sent the following email to the company:\n\nFigure 6. The initial email sent by the malicious actors, allegedly from the General\nDirectorate of Public Finances (DGFiP) of France, concerning tax inquiries\nThe email contained an attached PDF file that seemed to be a letter from the French Tax\nservice:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nEssentially, the PDF file contains a request from the spoofed government organization\nasking the target company for information on their customers, employees, and other financial\ndata. The text also adds to the urgency of the request by mentioning possible fines if the\ntarget organization refuses to cooperate.\n\nThe translation of the text found in the PDF file is as follows:\n\n_As happens every year, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact with the European_\n_Commission, the Directorate General of Public Finances is launching an investigation as part_\n_of the verification of compliance with SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) conditions and_\n_international standards._\n\n_As such, in accordance with the provisions of articles L.81, L.85 and article L.102 B of the_\n_book of tax procedures, I would like to have, as soon as possible and no later than July_\n**_20, 2020, in dematerialized form, for each of your three (3) main Customers who pay_**\n**_their services by SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transfer for the period from_**\n**_04/01/2020 to 07/31/2020 of: The aging balance to date, duplicate invoice_**\n**_correspondents (Not having been paid by the customer and concerning the June, July_**\n**_and August deadlines), contacts of the financial or accounting department (Emails,_**\n**_Telephones and Postal address) and one (1) duly signed and sealed commercial_**\n**_contract._**\n\n_I would point out that this operation does not constitute a verification of your tax situation and_\n_indicates to you that any refusal to cooperate is sanctioned by a tax fine provided for in_\n_article 1734 of the general tax code._\n\n_I invite you to send us these documents in dematerialized form on our secure and functional_\n_[messaging: odac@dgfip-finances-gouv[.]cloud](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:odac@dgfip-finances-gouv.cloud)_\n\n_While thanking you for your cooperation, please believe in the assurance of my distinguished_\n_feelings._\n\nThe PDF letter looks (and reads) like a real document from the French tax service. In fact,\nmost French people would probably think this is a legitimate letter unless they look closely at\nthe email address used (dgfip-finances-gouv[.]cloud instead of the real domain, which is\ndgfip.finances.gouv.fr).\n\nAs we highlighted in bold, the social engineering trick used in this email is for gathering data\nthat could potentially be useful for the malicious actors, such as client information and\ncommercial contracts. Once this information is in the hands of the scammers, they can then\nmove on to the next stage of the attack, which involves reaching out to the three contacts\nmentioned in the PDF file.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne interesting side note: it seems the BEC scammers actually built their PDF file from a\nreal PDF file used by the French tax system. The real name of the author of the document\n(as seen in the metadata) is indeed the name of a real government employee working in the\ndepartment responsible for handling tax-related issues.\n\nThe use of tax-related scams is [something we’ve seen before. This incident confirms that the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/what-you-need-to-know-about-tax-scams)\ninformation stolen using tax fraud is being used for malicious purposes, in this case, a BEC\nscam.\n\n## Expanding the target range\n\nWe searched our systems for similar emails and found at least 73 different French\ncompanies targeted by these cybercriminals.\n\nFigure 8. The industry distribution of the companies targeted in this particular BEC scam.\nOrganizations in the manufacturing sector were by far the most targeted\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most targeted industry in this BEC campaign is manufacturing, particularly\nmanufacturing companies that build high tech products and materials. This was followed by\nthe healthcare, real estate, energy, and food and beverage industries. Many of the targeted\ncompanies work with many different service providers and partners, making requests for\nchanges in banking references look less suspicious. It’s highly likely that the fraud is more\nwidespread than we have data on.\n\nIn addition to reaching out and working with the first organization we investigated, we also\nnotified the other targets, all of whom have been very reactive to the threat. We also helped\nclose the fraudulent domains.\n\nDefending your organization from BEC attacks\n\nBusinesses are advised to educate employees on how BEC scams and other similar attacks\nwork. These schemes do not require advanced technical skills: all that’s needed to launch an\neffective BEC scam is a single compromised account and services that are widely available\nin the cybercriminal underground.\n\nAs such, here are some tips on how to stay safe from these online schemes:\n\nCarefully scrutinize all emails. Be wary of irregular emails sent by high-level executives,\nespecially those that have an unusual sense of urgency, as they can be used to trick\nemployees into furthering the scam. Always review emails requesting for funds to\ndetermine if the requests are out of the ordinary.\nRaise employee awareness. While employees are a company’s biggest asset, they can\n[also be its weakest link when it comes to security. Commit to training employees,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/data-breaches-and-the-human-factor-are-employees-the-best-defense-or-the-weakest-links)\nreviewing company policies, and developing good security habits.\nVerify any changes in vendor payment location by using a secondary sign-off by\ncompany personnel.\nStay updated on customer habits, including the details and reasons behind payments.\nAlways verify requests. Confirm requests for fund transfers using phone verification as\na part of two-factor authentication (2FA), use known familiar numbers and not the\ndetails provided in the email requests.\nReport any incident immediately to law enforcement or file a complaint with the Internet\nCrime Complaint Center (IC3).\n\nTrend Micro Solutions\n\n**Email**\n\n[The email security capabilities of the Trend Micro User Protection and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection.html) [Network Defense](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network.html)\nsolutions can block email messages used in Business Email Compromise attacks.\n\n**Malware**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Endpoint security capabilities in Trend Micro User Protection and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection.html) [Network Defense solutions](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network.html)\ncan detect advanced malware and other threats used in BEC schemes.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Domains**\n\ndgfip-finances-gouv[.]cloud\nbellingstudio@gmail.com\n\n\n-----",
