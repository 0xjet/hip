    "plain_text": "# New nation-state cyberattacks\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/)**\n\nMarch 2, 2021\n\nToday, we’re sharing information about a state-sponsored threat actor identified by the\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) that we are calling Hafnium. Hafnium operates\nfrom China, and this is the first time we’re discussing its activity. It is a highly skilled and\nsophisticated actor.\n\nHistorically, Hafnium primarily targets entities in the United States for the purpose of\nexfiltrating information from a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease\nresearchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks\nand NGOs. While Hafnium is based in China, it conducts its operations primarily from leased\nvirtual private servers (VPS) in the United States.\n\nRecently, Hafnium has engaged in a number of attacks using previously unknown exploits\ntargeting on-premises Exchange Server software. To date, Hafnium is the primary actor\n[we’ve seen use these exploits, which are discussed in detail by MSTIC here. The attacks](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\nincluded three steps. First, it would gain access to an Exchange Server either with stolen\npasswords or by using the previously undiscovered vulnerabilities to disguise itself as\nsomeone who should have access. Second, it would create what’s called a web shell to\ncontrol the compromised server remotely. Third, it would use that remote access – run from\nthe U.S.-based private servers – to steal data from an organization’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe re focused on protecting customers from the exploits used to carry out these attacks.\nToday, we [released security updates that will protect customers running Exchange Server.](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server)\nWe strongly encourage all Exchange Server customers to apply these updates immediately.\nExchange Server is primarily used by business customers, and we have no evidence that\nHafnium’s activities targeted individual consumers or that these exploits impact other\nMicrosoft products.\n\nEven though we’ve worked quickly to deploy an update for the Hafnium exploits, we know\nthat many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any\nunpatched systems. Promptly applying today’s patches is the best protection against this\nattack.\n\nIn addition to offering new protections for our customers, we’ve briefed appropriate U.S.\ngovernment agencies on this activity.\n\nThis is the eighth time in the past 12 months that Microsoft has publicly disclosed nationstate groups targeting institutions critical to civil society; other activity we disclosed has\n[targeted healthcare organizations fighting Covid-19, political campaigns and others involved](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/)\n[in the 2020 elections, and high-profile attendees of major policymaking conferences.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/)\n\nWe are encouraged that many organizations are voluntarily sharing data with the world,\namong each other and with government institutions committed to defense. We’re grateful to\nresearchers at Volexity and Dubex who notified us about aspects of this new Hafnium activity\nand worked with us to address it in a responsible way. We need more information to be\nshared rapidly about cyberattacks to enable all of us to better defend against them. That is\n[why Microsoft President Brad Smith recently told the U.S. Congress that we must take steps](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/23/digital-strategy-defend-the-nation/)\nto require reporting of cyber incidents.\n\nThe exploits we’re discussing today were in no way connected to the separate SolarWindsrelated attacks. We continue to see no evidence that the actor behind SolarWinds\ndiscovered or exploited any vulnerability in Microsoft products and services.\n\n\n-----",
