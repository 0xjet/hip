According to reports at the time, victims reported having](https://twitter.com/Amigo_A_/status/1187668024863739904)\ndata encrypted with the .locked extension added at the end of each ransomed file.\n\nA new Mespinoza version was spotted two months later, in December 2019. This one used the .pysa file extension, which explains the second\nPysa name under which this ransomware is sometimes referred to.\n\nIn previous cases of Mespinoza/Pysa infections, most of the victims were companies, suggesting that the group behind this new ransomware\nwas specifically targeting large corporate networks in an attempt to maximize ransom demands and inherently its profits.\n\nNow, CERT-FR says the Pysa gang has moved to target French organizations, with the agency receiving reports of multiple infections.\n\n### Unclear how the Pysa gang is infecting victims\n\nCERT-FR said it is still investigating how the Pysa gang is gaining access to victim's networks. However, forensics clues left behind paint a\npicture of what could have happened on some of the infected/ransomed networks.\n\nFor example, CERT-FR said there was evidence suggesting that the Pysa gang launched brute-force attacks against management consoles\nand Active Directory accounts.\n\nThese brute-force attacks were followed by the exfiltration of a company's accounts & passwords database.\n\nVictim organizations also reported seeing unauthorized RDP connections to their domain controllers, and the deployment of Batch and\nPowerShell scripts.\n\n[Furthermore, the Pysa gang also deployed a version of the PowerShell Empire penetration-testing tool, stopped various antivirus products,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/development-stops-on-powershell-empire-framework-after-project-reaches-its-goal/)\nand even uninstalled Windows Defender in some instances.\n\nCERT-FR says that in at least one case they analyzed, they also found a new version of the Pysa ransomware, which used the .newversion\nfile extension instead of the older .pysa.\n\n### No encryption weaknesses\n\nInvestigators said they also analyzed the ransomware and its encryption algorithms, and they weren't able to find any implementation flaws\nthat could permit victims to bypass the ransom payment and decrypt files for free.\n\nAccording to CERT-FR, the Pysa ransomware code is \"specific and very short\" and \"based on public Python libraries.\"\n\nBut attacks with Pysa aren't only limited to France. In an interview with ZDNet about this new ransomware gang, Emsisoft malware analyst and\n[ID-Ransomware creator Michael Gillespie said the Pysa ransomware gang has also made victims outside France, across multiple continents,](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nhitting both government and business-related networks.\n\n[The CERT-FR Mespinoza/Pysa alert is available here.](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2020-CTI-003/)\n\n### Latest big-game hunter\n\nMespinoza/Pysa is the latest ransomware gang that engages in a tactic called \"big game hunting\" or \"human-operated ransomware\" -- where\nransomware gangs target high-profile targets, breach their networks, and then manually install ransomware on their networks.\n\nThis very focused targeting tactic is in stark contrast with the shotgun approach that has been used by ransomware gangs in the past, in the\n2015 - early 2019 period, when they heavily relied on exploit kits and email spam to infect random victims.\n\nOther ransomware gangs that engage in targeted \"big-game hunting\" include Ryuk, REvil (Sodinokibi), LockerGoga, RobbinHood,\nDoppelPaymer, Maze, and many more others.\n\n**Europol’s top hacking ring takedowns**\n\n\n-----",
