While REvil was purportedly shut down in July\n2021, many of their targets remain impacted by their activities, and other groups have\n[recently emerged that Flashpoint analysts assess as being related to REvil.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/chatter-indicates-blackmatter-as-revil-successor/)\n\nEkranoplan shared a link to the screenshot on August 6, 2021. The user does not appear to\nhave any further posting history on the forum. Several users questioned the utility of a\nscreenshot in decrypting files, to which Ekranoplan answered in Russian, “This was provided\nto us by our parent company and is supposed to work for all REvil victims, not just us.” While\nthe origins of Ekranoplan are unknown, no pun intended, Flashpoint analysts tested the\nREvil decryptor. As one user in the thread highlighted, replacing the decryption key with this\nkey should work.\n\nFlashpoint patched the decryptor binary with the annotated key from the thread, and\nsuccessfully decrypted a sandbox infected with the new REvil test sample, upon changing\nthe file extensions to “universal_tool_xxx_yyy” as seen in the screenshot. The files were\nproperly decrypted once the file extensions were renamed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screenshot of_\n\n_masterkey posting from Github._ _Posting in XSS Forum, as seen (and translated) in the_\n_Flashpoint platform_\nSimilar to the Russian aircraft owing to Ekranoplan’s namesake, the user flew out of the\nforum thread as quickly as they entered. The mystery still remains on the true reason for\nREvil’s sudden disappearance. Whether their infrastructure was the target of a coordinated\nlaw enforcement operation, the decryption key was leaked by a former victim, or a change of\nheart from the REvil operators remains a point of conjecture. At this time, the outcome is the\nsame. Analysts will continue to monitor for changes in the ransomware ecosystem.\n\n## Track Ransomware Activity With Flashpoint\n\nThe data above was discovered directly through analyst research in the Flashpoint platform.\n[Sign up for a free trial, and see firsthand how Flashpoint can help you and your organization](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/free-trial)\naccess the most critical information affecting your industry and the security community.\n\nSources: [1] hxxps://github[.]com/Fr3akaLmaTT3r/decryptor/blob/main/screenshot.png\n\n\n-----",
