Kaspersky is working on a decryption app.\n\nWritten by Catalin Cimpanu, Contributor on April 27, 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nshade keys.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n[The operators of the Shade (Troldesh) ransomware have shut down over the weekend and, as a sign of goodwill, have released more than](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.troldesh)\n750,000 decryption keys that past victims can now use to decrypt their files.\n\n[Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab have confirmed the validity of the leaked keys and have released a free decryption tool.](https://twitter.com/k1k_/status/1254773729642475520)\n\n[In a short message posted in a GitHub repository, the Shade team explained what led to their decision.](https://github.com/shade-team/keys)\n\nWe are the team which created a trojan-encryptor mostly known as Shade, Troldesh or Encoder.858. In fact, we stopped its distribution\nin the end of 2019. Now we made a decision to put the last point in this story and to publish all the decryption keys we have (over 750\nthousands at all). We are also publishing our decryption soft; we also hope that, having the keys, antivirus companies will issue their own\nmore user-friendly decryption tools. All other data related to our activity (including the source codes of the trojan) was irrevocably\ndestroyed. We apologize to all the victims of the trojan and hope that the keys we published will help them to recover their data.\n\n\n-----\n\ne t e S ade ga g e p a ed y t ey e eased t e dec ypt o eys, t ey d d ot e p a y t ey s ut do Se e a t eo es a e\nstarted to form among ransomware experts, yet none are based on actual tangible threat intelligence.\n\nPrior to shutting down at the end of 2019, the Shade ransomware has been one of the oldest ransomware strains, being first spotted in 2014\nand operating almost non-stop until it shut down last year.\n\n[It was also one of the most most active ransomware operations [1,](https://blog.avast.com/ransomware-strain-troldesh-spikes) [2], being distributed via a combination of email spam campaigns and exploit](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/03/spotlight-troldesh-ransomware-aka-shade/)\nkits.\n\nThe ransomware wasn't perfect, though, and during its lifetime, security researchers from Kaspersky and Intel Security (now McAfee) have\n[released multiple decryption apps that could help victims recover files. However, the decrypters only worked against a small number of Shade](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html)\nversions, and the last of these tools was released in 2017.\n\nThe decryption keys released today will help all users who had files encrypted by the Shade ransomware. The keys are believed to account for\nall versions of the ransomware and all users who ever got infected.\n\nThe only condition is that users still have the encrypted files laying around, so they can be decrypted.\n\nWhile security experts often recommend saving ransomware-encrypted files on an offline hard drive, most victims simply reinstall their\ncomputer from scratch, deleting the encrypted data. Those who saved their encrypted files can now recover data they once considered lost.\n\n_Updated on May 1 with a link to Kaspersky's free decryption tool._\n\n**The FBI's most wanted cybercriminals**\n\n\n-----",
