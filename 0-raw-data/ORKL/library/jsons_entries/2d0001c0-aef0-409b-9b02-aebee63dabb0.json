    "plain_text": "# REvil Ransom Arrest, $6M Seizure, and $10M Reward\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/revil-ransom-arrest-6m-seizure-and-10m-reward/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/revil-ransom-arrest-6m-seizure-and-10m-reward/)**\n\n**The U.S. Department of Justice today announced the arrest of Ukrainian man accused of**\ndeploying ransomware on behalf of the REvil ransomware gang, a Russian-speaking\ncybercriminal collective that has extorted hundreds of millions from victim organizations. The\nDOJ also said it had seized $6.1 million in cryptocurrency sent to another REvil affiliate, and\nthat the U.S. Department of State is now offering up to $10 million for the name or location\nany key REvil leaders, and up to $5 million for information on REvil affiliates.\n\nIf it sounds unlikely that a normal Internet user could make millions of dollars unmasking the\nidentities of REvil gang members, take heart and consider that the two men indicted as part\n[this law enforcement action do not appear to have done much to separate their cybercriminal](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ukrainian-arrested-and-charged-ransomware-attack-kaseya)\nidentities from their real-life selves.\n\nExhibit #1: Yaroslav Vasinskyi, the 22-year-old Ukrainian national accused of being REvil\nAffiliate #22. Vasinskyi was arrested Oct. 8 in Poland, which maintains an extradition treaty\nwith the United States. Prosecutors say Vasinskyi was involved in a number of REvil\n[ransomware attacks, including the July 2021 attack against Kaseya, a Miami-based](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ransomware-fbi-revil-decryption-key/2021/09/21/4a9417d0-f15f-11eb-a452-4da5fe48582d_story.html)\ncompany whose products help system administrators manage large networks remotely.\n\n\n-----\n\nYaroslav Vasinksyi’s Vkontakte profile reads “If they tell you nasty things about me, believe every\n\nword.”\n\nAccording to [his indictment (PDF), Vasinskyi used a variety of hacker handles, including](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1447126/download)\n“Profcomserv” — the nickname behind an online service that floods phone numbers with junk\ncalls for a fee. Prosecutors say Vasinskyi also used the monikers “Yarik45,” and\n“Yaroslav2468.”\n\nThese last two nicknames correspond to accounts on several top cybercrime forums way\nback in 2013, where a user named “Yaroslav2468” registered using the email address\n**yarik45@gmail.com.**\n\nThat email address was used to register an account at Vkontakte (the Russian version of\nFacebook/Meta) under the profile name of “Yaroslav ‘sell the blood of css’ Vasinskyi.”\nVasinskyi’s Vkontakte profile says his current city as of Oct. 3 was Lublin, Poland. Perhaps\ntauntingly, Vasinskyi’s profile page also lists the FBI’s 1-800 tip line as his contact phone\nnumber He’s now in custody in Poland awaiting extradition to the United States\n\n\n-----\n\nExhibit #2: Yevgeniy Igorevich Polyanin, the 28-year-old Russian national who is alleged to\nbe REvil Affiliate #23. The DOJ said it seized $6.1 million in funds traceable to alleged\nransom payments received by Polyanin, and that the defendant had been involved in REvil\nransomware attacks on multiple U.S. victim organizations.\n\nThe FBI’s wanted poster for Polyanin.\n\n[Polyanin’s indictment (PDF) says he also favored numerous hacker handles, including](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1447121/download)\n**LK4D4, Damnating, Damn2life, Noolleds, and Antunpitre. Some of these nicknames go**\nback more than a decade on Russian cybercrime forums, many of which have been hacked\nand relieved of their user databases over the years.\n\nAmong those was carder[.]su, and that forum’s database says a user by the name\n“Damnating” registered with the forum in 2008 using the email address\n**damnating@yandex.ru. Sure enough, there is a Vkontakte profile tied to that email address**\nunder the name “Yevgeniy ‘damn’ Polyanin” from Barnaul, a city in the southern Siberian\nregion of Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe apparent lack of any real operational security by either of the accused here is so\ncommon that it is hardly remarkable. As exhibited by countless investigations in my\n[Breadcrumbs story series, I have found that if a cybercriminal is active on multiple forums](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=breadcrumbs)\nover more than 10 years, it is extremely likely that person has made multiple mistakes that\nmake it relatively easy to connect his forum persona to his real-life identity.\n\n[As I explained earlier this year in The Wages of Password Re-use: Your Money or Your Life,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/the-wages-of-password-re-use-your-money-or-your-life/)\nit’s possible in many cases to make that connection thanks to two factors. The biggest is\npassword re-use by cybercriminals (yes, crooks are lazy, too). The other is that cybercriminal\nforums, services, etc. get hacked just about as much as everyone else on the Internet, and\nwhen they do their user databases can reveal some very valuable secrets and connections.\n\nIn conjunction with today’s REvil action, the U.S. Department of State said it was offering a\nreward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of any\nindividual holding a key leadership position in the REvil ransomware group. The department\nsaid it was also offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest\nand/or conviction in any country of any individual conspiring to participate in or attempting to\nparticipate in a REvil ransomware incident.\n\nI really like this bounty offer and I hope we see more just like it for other ransomware groups.\nBecause as we can see from the prosecutions of both Polyanin and Vasinskyi, a lot of these\nguys simply aren’t too hard to find. Let the games begin.\n\n\n-----",
