TransLink's\n[transit services were not affected by the IT problems caused by the ransomware attack.](https://twitter.com/TransLink/status/1333932625552048129)\n\n\"We are now in a position to confirm that TransLink was the target of a ransomware attack\non some of our IT infrastructure,\" [TransLink disclosed in a statement following the incident.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/metro-vancouvers-transit-system-hit-by-egregor-ransomware/)\n\"This attack includes communications to TransLink through a printed message.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the attack, the ransomware operators used the company s printers to print ransom\nnotes which BleepingComputer identified as Egregor ransom notes, a tactic the cybercrime\n[gang also used after infiltrating the network of retail giant Cencosud in November.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-cencosud-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-attack-stores-impacted/)\n\n## Employee banking info stolen\n\n[Although immediately after the attack was discovered TransLink representatives said that](https://twitter.com/TransLink/status/1334352792593584129)\n\"there is no cause for concern that personal data has been compromised\" when it comes to\ncustomers' information, it looks like this is not the case for employees.\n\n[TransLink told employees in an internal email seen by Global News that the Egregor](https://globalnews.ca/news/7548761/translink-cyberattack-personal-info/)\noperators have \"accessed and may have copied files from a restricted network drive\" and\nseveral other network drives.\n\nAccording to the email, the accessed drives containing the payroll information of TransLink,\nCoast Mountain Bus Company (CMBC), and Metro Vancouver Transit Police employees.\n\n\"Those restricted network drives include files that contain banking information and some\nsocial insurance numbers,\" TransLink added.\n\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\nWhile the company has evidence that the drives were accessed during the attack, it is still\nworking on identifying the impacted employees and the files that were opened or copied by\nthe attackers.\n\nThe transportation agency also urges all employees to sign up for two-year credit\nmonitoring — free for all staff— as soon as possible.\n\n\"Importantly, as we outlined previously, TransLink does not store or have access to\nCompass customer fare payment information,” Translink spokesperson Ben Murphy told\nGlobal News Wednesday.\n\n## Most systems still down\n\n[At the moment, most of TransLink's systems are still down after the ransomware attack —](https://twitter.com/TransLink/status/1345815908342751238)\nincluding real-time GPS data, tracking, and reporting systems — with company technicians\nworking to restore them as soon as possible.\n\nCustomers who want to track buses are advised to use Google trip planner \"for the time\nbeing,\" until tracking systems are back online.\n\n\"We are now in the process of gradually bringing priority systems back online as safely as\npossible,\" Murphy added.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately we re not able to confirm this information at this time, as most of our\nsystems remain unavailable after a cyberattack. We're recommending using Google\ntrip planner for the time being, but that also won't be updated for Winter service\nchanges until tomorrow. ^nv\n\n[— TransLink BC | Masks Mandatory (@TransLink) January 3, 2021](https://twitter.com/TransLink/status/1345815908342751238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nEgregor is a ransomware operation that partners with affiliates who hack into targets'\nnetworks and deploy ransomware payloads, earning 70% of the ransom payments with\nthe Egregor operators getting a 30% revenue share.\n\nThe affiliates who infiltrate victims' networks are also known for stealing files before\nencrypting devices using Egregor ransomware and for using them as leverage under the\nthreat of publicly leaking them unless the ransom is paid.\n\n[Egregor started operating in September 2020 after Maze shut down their operation,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-shuts-down-operations-denies-creating-cartel/)\nwith many of the Maze affiliates switching to Egregor as threat actors told\nBleepingComputer.\n\nSince September, Egregor affiliates breached and encrypted the systems of several high[profile targets worldwide, including but not limited to Ubisoft,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/) [Kmart,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kmart-nationwide-retailer-suffers-a-ransomware-attack/) Barnes and\nNoble, [Cencosud, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-cencosud-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-attack-stores-impacted/) [Crytek.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[British Columbia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/british-columbia/)\n[Canada](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/canada/)\n[Data Breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-breach/)\n[Egregor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/egregor/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[TransLink](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/translink/)\n[Vancouver](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vancouver/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
