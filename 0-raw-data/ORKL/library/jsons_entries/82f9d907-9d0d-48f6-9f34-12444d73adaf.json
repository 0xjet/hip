    "plain_text": "# Hamas Android Malware On IDF Soldiers-This is How it Happened\n\n**[research.checkpoint.com/2020/hamas-android-malware-on-idf-soldiers-this-is-how-it-happened/](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/hamas-android-malware-on-idf-soldiers-this-is-how-it-happened/)**\n\nFebruary 16, 2020\n\nFebruary 16, 2020\n**Introduction:**\n\nEarlier today, IDF’s spokesperson revealed that IDF (Israel Defense Force) and ISA (Israel\nSecurity Agency AKA “Shin Bet”) conducted a joint operation to take down a Hamas\noperation targeting IDF soldiers, dubbed ‘Rebound’.\n\nIn this article, we will describe the capabilities and provide technical analysis of the malware\n[used, along with the attack’s affiliation to APT-C-23, a hacking group with previously reported](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/apt-attack-middle-east-big-bang/)\nattacks in the Middle East\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nThis MRAT (Mobile Remote Access Trojan) is disguised as a set of dating apps, “GrixyApp”,\n“ZatuApp”, and “Catch&See”, all with dedicated websites, and descriptions of dating\napplications.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victims received a link to download the malicious application from a Hamas operator\ndisguising themselves as an attractive woman. Once the application is installed and\nexecuted, it shows an error message stating that the device is not supported, and the app\nwill uninstall itself – which actually does not happen, and the app only hides its icon.\n\n**Figure 1 – Fake error message**\n\nWhile hidden, the application communicates with the same server it was downloaded from,\nusing the MQTT protocol.\n\nThe main functionality of this malware is to collect data on the victim such as phone number,\nlocation, SMS messages and more, while having the capability to extend its code via a\nreceived command. The command can provide the application with a URL to a DEX file,\nwhich is then downloaded and executed.\n\n**Figure 2 – Code to download an additional DEX file**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3 – Communication with the C&C**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4 – Collecting device information**\n\n**Figure 5 – Collecting a list of installed applications**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6 – Collecting storage information**\n\n**Figure 7 – Application hiding demo**\n\n**Affiliation:**\n\nThe tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in this new wave of attacks are similar\nto ones used in the past by previous APT-C-23 campaigns.\n\nFirst, the threat group develops backdoors for Android devices that are usually disguised as\nchatting applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8 – Promotion websites**\n\nSecond, dedicated and specially crafted websites are set up by the threat group to promote\nthose backdoors, explain their functionality, and offer a direct link to download them. Those\ndomains, and others that are used for C&C communications by known APT-C-23 samples,\nare usually registered using NameCheap, and this was also the case with the newly\ndiscovered websites.\n\nLastly, malicious samples affiliated with APT-C-23 made references to names of actors, TV\ncharacters and celebrities both in their source code and C&C communication. Although the\nnew backdoors lacked those references, we were able to see name of celebrities and known\nfigures such as Jim Morrison, Eliza Doolittle, Gretchen Bleiler and Dolores Huerta in the\nbackdoor’s website, catchansee[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9 – References to celebrities in server code**\n\nThis campaign serves as a sharp reminder that effort from system developers alone is not\nenough to build a secure Android eco-system. It requires attention and action from system\ndevelopers, device manufacturers, app developers, and users, so that vulnerability fixes are\npatched, distributed, adopted and installed in time.\n\n[It is also another example for why organizations and consumers alike should have an](https://www.zonealarm.com/mobile-security)\n[advanced mobile threat prevention solution installed on the device to protect themselves](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/mobile-security/)\nagainst the possibility of unknowingly installing malicious apps, even from trusted app stores.\n\n\n-----",
