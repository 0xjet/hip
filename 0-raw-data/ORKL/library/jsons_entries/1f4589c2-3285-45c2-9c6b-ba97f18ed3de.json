Throughout over a decade of activity, Berserk operated in a variety of\nsensitive environments, from industrial organizations to government entities – but without\nany apparent, direct impact.\n\nWhile recently published research indicates this group may be responsible for inadvertent\ndisruption as part of its activities in critical infrastructure environments, even absent such\nimpacts Berserk’s behaviors are cause for concern. Viewed potentially as preliminary\n[operations necessary for future cyber impacts, Berserk represents a preparatory agent](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/naivet%C3%A9-redux-preparation-persistence-required-attack-dale-peterson)\n[enabling future, more worrying events.](https://pylos.co/2018/12/26/electric-sector-targeting-in-context/)\n\nThe implications of Berserk activity for critical infrastructure owners and operators are\nsignificant. Although not directly linked to any known, intended disruptive or destructive\nevent, the group’s operations cover all necessary steps to position an adversary for such an\noperation in the future. For network defenders, a review of this group’s actions is therefore\nnot merely helpful but for some necessary to guard against this type of threat. In this post,\nwe will examine network-focused items related to Berserk Bear operations throughout the\n[group’s history as detailed in recently published research.](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Slowik.pdf)\n\n## Exploit to Credential Leak\n\nInitial Berserk activity, often referred to as the [Dragonfly Campaign, utilized exploits as part of](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/dragonfly_threat_against_western_energy_suppliers)\n[multiple intrusion vectors to gain initial access to victims from at least 2010 through 2014.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08080817/EB-YetiJuly2014-Public.pdf)\nAfter a brief period of quiet, the group returned to action using superficially similar initial\naccess mechanisms: strategic website compromise (SWC) and phishing campaigns with\nmalicious attachments. However, unlike earlier activity, post-Dragonfly operations avoided\nthe use of exploits and instead focused on leaking credentials from victim machines.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Through either reference to external objects in malicious documents or by](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-293A) injecting a\nreference to a remotely hosted object in an otherwise legitimate webpage, Berserk operators\nworked to harvest credentials by prompting an external authentication attempt from victim\n[machines. Similar to penetration testing techniques such as](https://hausec.com/2017/10/19/domain-penetration-testing-credential-harvesting-via-llmnr-poisoning/) [use of the Responder tool for](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder)\ncapturing logon information, the technique prompts a victim machine to initiate an outbound\nServer Message Block (SMB) query to retrieve a remotely-hosted file object. As part of this\n[communication, Windows authentication information (the username and NTLM hash) passes](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187/)\nto the remote machine, which an intruder can capture for future replay.\n\nFrom a defender’s perspective, the first recommendation to avoid such information leakage\nis to deny outbound SMB connections (TCP 445). Where such actions are not possible,\nexternal connectivity should be limited to known-necessary networks. Alternatively, such\ntraffic can be rigorously logged as SMB communications can be leveraged for a variety of\nmalicious actions beyond the credential leak activity associated with Berserk Bear.\n\nWhen SMB routes fail, Windows will fail-over to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning\n[(WebDAV) to retrieve the same resource via HTTP. The fail-over communication can be](http://www.webdav.org/)\nidentified in network traffic via a [WebDAV-containing user agent string. Monitoring HTTP](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/11/13/webdav-traffic-to-malicious-sites/)\ntraffic containing a WebDAV-related user agent can reveal these attempts when outbound\nSMB traffic is blocked or filtered. While this alone may be insufficient to identify truly\nsuspicious traffic as legitimate use cases exist, pairing with analysis of infrastructure or\noriginating application or resource can reveal instances worth further investigation.\n\n## Abusing Remote Access\n\nPost-Dragonfly actions associated with Berserk used harvested credentials for both remote\naccess to victim environments and lateral movement inside compromised networks. More\nrecent campaigns linked to this entity continue to emphasize credential harvesting,\nleveraging a combination of exploits, tools, and standard collection techniques as means to\naccess logon information. Overall, just as Berserk transitioned from exploits for initial access,\nconsistent credential gathering and reuse allows the intruder to blend in with normal user\nactivity and evade easy detection.\n\nOnce inside victim networks, Berserk actors create adversary-controlled administrator\naccounts and modify system settings to facilitate follow-on access, as well as continuous\npassword theft and cracking to gather more existing account information. While other\ntechniques also appear in Berserk-related campaigns in the late 2010s, Berserk operations\nfrom 2018 to the present focus on having steady, reliable access to valid credentials. Berserk\nthen leverages collected credentials for remote access, lateral movement, as well as for\ntactics such as remote process execution using the PSExec tool.\n\nA variety of host-centric controls exist to monitor or limit these techniques. First and\nforemost, network owners must deploy and enforce robust multi-factor authentication (MFA)\nschema to significantly minimize the risk of account compromise and credential reuse.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, defenders can monitor system and access logs for unusual activity associated\nwith specific user accounts, and audit privileged account use within the network.\n\nIn addition to these host-based operations, network-centric options also exist to monitor and\ntrack possible credential abuse. For example, especially where host-centric logs may not be\neasily accessible or available, mapping authentication pairs – source and destination system\n– and associated accounts can identify overall patterns in network traffic. While potentially\noverwhelming and unwieldy for covering all remote authentication activity, focusing on\nexternal-to-internal behaviors to track new authentication sources or emphasizing “high\nvalue” internal targets (domain controllers, security tools, or industrial systems) can yield\npotentially valuable results. Identifying a new, not previously seen remote access attempt to\nthe network from an unfamiliar network address (discussed further below) can be the first\ntouchpoint revealing potential credential loss and a follow-on intrusion attempt. Similarly,\nidentifying authentication attempts to critical assets from standard user machines in the\nnetwork can reveal opportunistic lateral movement activity.\n\nExpanding beyond authentication tracking, defenders can utilize network visibility to enhance\nunderstanding of file movement and process execution as well. Similarly reliant upon\ncredential access, looking for activity such as share mapping (and subsequent file\nmovement) or remote process execution via various frameworks is critical to mapping lateral\nmovement activity. Identifying unusual relationships in such activity, such as file movement\ndirectly between workstations or remote process activity outside of policy and administration\nparameters can reveal adversary operations in progress.\n\nCertainly, none of the above items are easy to implement, but represent necessary steps for\nnetwork owners and defenders to evolve with adversaries such as Berserk Bear. Luckily,\nadvances in technology, modeling, and threat analysis mean defenders can take advantage\nof robust, [mutli-faceted detection of systemic anomalies to reveal adversaries attempting to](https://blog.gigamon.com/2021/07/27/ghosts-on-the-wire-expanding-conceptions-of-network-anomalies/)\n“blend in” with normal system operations.\n\n## Infrastructure Capture for Communications\n\nBerserk Bear is interesting not just for its activity, but also the nature of the infrastructure\nused to carry out that activity. Starting with the Dragonfly campaign, Berserk utilized\n[compromised, legitimate sites and services for operations. By the later Palmetto Fusion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-officials-say-russian-government-hackers-have-penetrated-energy-and-nuclear-company-business-networks/2017/07/08/bbfde9a2-638b-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.html)\n[campaign and follow-on activities, Berserk shifted almost entirely to using compromised](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\ninfrastructure for malicious activity.\n\nWhen procuring network infrastructure, adversaries have two general choices: they can\ncreate their own (lease IP addresses and servers, register domain names, etc.) or leverage a\nthird party’s existing service. One of the more direct ways of achieving the latter is to simply\n[compromise someone’s vulnerable system for use in attacks, whether for botnets or as proxy](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/botnet-attacks)\n\n\n-----\n\nnodes for communication. For an adversary, this approach can evade typical defender\n[analysis and pivoting methodologies by avoiding creation patterns or relative “newness” of](https://www.domaintools.com/content/formulating-a-robust-pivoting-methodology.pdf)\nregistered domains.\n\nYet opportunities still exist to differentiate communication pathways provided defenders can\nenrich and contextualize these observations. Looking at previously described Berserk\nbehaviors, such as credential harvesting and follow-on remote access, even if this activity\ninvolves a compromised, otherwise legitimate server, defenders can still identify suspicious\ncharacteristics in the infrastructure to power security-driven decision-making. For example,\ndefenders can establish profiles of remote access to the monitored network including not just\ngeography but also service providers and even Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) for\nclients. Using this information to then identify items outside the norm, such as the expanded\nanomaly approach described previously, or establishing allow-lists preemptively to block\nactivity outside of existing patterns can defeat activity such as Berserk.\n\nExpanding on this, for remote access activity such as connection to the corporate VPN or\nremote access technologies such as RDP or SSH, activity coming from a remote user would\nlikely originate from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) catering to home users. Observing\nsuch remote access activity from a virtual public server (VPS) or cloud service provider\nwould be very strange – but also represents a likely pathway for an entity compromising\nthird-party infrastructure for use as communication relays. By enriching and understanding\ncommunication nodes – essentially, [viewing network observables as composite objects –](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects)\ndefenders can build context around observed IP addresses and other items to make\nsecurity-focused decisions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBerserk Bear, in many respects, represents a historical entity in that no publicly known\noperations have been attributed to this group since 2020. While some may assume this\ngroup would therefore offer little to defenders right now in terms of lessons learned, closer\ninvestigation reveals Berserk deploying a variety of tactics and techniques that mirror\nbehaviors associated with current ransomware and other advanced persistent threat entities.\n\nBy researching and analyzing Berserk Bear campaigns, defenders can gain significant\ninsight into adversary tradecraft aligning with abuse of legitimate services and “living off the\nland” techniques. Furthermore, understanding is necessary for defenders to take the next\nrequired step: building and deploying detections and defenses against such behaviors.\n\nNetwork defenders and system owners can use this iterative process of threat analysis and\ndefense development far more widely. By first understanding how given adversaries operate,\nthen identifying various detection and identification opportunities associated with observed\ncapabilities and actions, defenders can ensure coverage of adversary tradecraft. Analysts\n\n\n-----\n\ncan then expand from specific instantiations of tradecraft to more general understanding of\nthe fundamental behavior for broad-scope defense meeting wider developments across\nmultiple adversaries.\n\n**Tell us your favorite security resource for a chance to win a $100 Amazon Gift Card**\n\nWinners will be drawn on November 1st.
