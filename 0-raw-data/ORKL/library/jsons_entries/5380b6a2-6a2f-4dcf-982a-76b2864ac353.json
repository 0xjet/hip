One of its main functions is stealing user\ncredentials, account numbers, and ultimately money from financial institutions. It does this by\n[using a technique known as “man in the browser” along with “webinjects” that specify what](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1185)\nwebsites to target and how. This banking malware was first seen in the wild in the beginning of\n2016 (version 2.1.x) and has had consistent, incremental development since then. While some\n[details have changed, our “Who Let the Pandas Out? Zeus, Zeus, Zeus, Zeus” blog post is still](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/let-pandas-zeus-zeus-zeus-zeus/)\n\n\n-----\n\na good introduction to the technical details of the malware. Panda Banker is sold as a kit on\nunderground forums so there are multiple users of the malware. Cybercrime threat actors tend\nto focus their campaigns on particular countries—usually dependent on their ability to convert\nstolen credentials and account details from those locations into real money. Over the years\nwe’ve seen Panda Banker campaigns focus on financial institutions in: Italy, Canada, Australia,\nGermany, United States, United Kingdom, and now Japan.\n\n## Campaign Analysis\n\nA new version of Panda Banker, version 2.6.6, was observed being distributed in the wild on\nMarch 26th:\n\n**SHA256: 8db8f6266f6ad9546b2b5386a835baa0cbf5ea5f699f2eb6285ddf401b76ccb7**\n\n**Compilation date: 2018-03-26 09:54:57 While we didn’t see any significant changes to the**\nmalware itself (possibly just a “bug fix” release), the campaign using this sample stood out for\ntwo reasons:\n\n1. No IOC overlap with any previous Panda Banker campaigns that we’ve seen.\n2. Webinjects targeting Japan, a country we haven’t seen targeted by Panda Banker before.\n\n_Command & Control (C2) The C2 servers configured for this sample are listed below:_\n\nhttps://hillaryzell[.]xyz/1wekenauhivwauvaxquor.dat\nhttps://buscamapa1[.]top/2yrfuupcovylaawubitvy.dat\nhttps://buscamapa2[.]top/3toaxkatoindyepidikuv.dat\nhttps://buscamapa3[.]top/4heequktuepahvoyfofit.dat\nhttps://buscamapa4[.]top/5ufyfegtuobekpykobeul.dat\nhttps://buscamapa5[.]top/6lubanuoxapywinlaokow.dat\n\nAt the time of research, only hillaryzell[.]xyz was operational and it was registered to a “Petrov\n[Vadim” using an email address of “yalapinziw@mail.ru”. Campaign Name The threat actor](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:yalapinziw@mail.ru)\nnamed this campaign “ank”. Webinjects At the time of research, the C2 server returned 27\nwebinjects that can be broken down into the following categories:\n\n17 Japanese banking web sites mostly focusing on credit cards\n1 US based web email site\n1 US based video search engine\n4 US based search engines\n1 US based online shopping site\n2 US based social media sites\n1 US based adult content hub\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example, redacted webinject for this campaign looks like the following: [caption\nid=\"attachment_9530\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]\n\nExample webinject targeting Japan.[/caption] The webinjects in this campaign make use of a\n[“grabber” / automated transfer system (ATS) system known as “Full Info Grabber” to capture](http://www.xylibox.com/2014/05/atsengine.html)\ncredentials and account information. As can be seen in figures above, the threat actor is using\na path of “jpccgrab” possibly meaning “Japanese credit card grabber”. Given the targeting, this\nname makes some sense. Distribution (update March 28, 2018) Security researcher kafeine\nhas [released more details on how this threat is being distributed in the wild: a malicious](https://twitter.com/kafeine/status/978900624204025857)\nadvertisement (malvertising) is redirecting victims to a RIG exploit kit which is distributing the\nPanda Banker malware.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nJapan is no stranger to banking malware. Based on recent reports, the country has been\n[plagued by attacks using the Ursnif and](https://securityintelligence.com/ursnif-campaign-waves-breaking-on-japanese-shores/) [Urlzone banking malware. This post was our first](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/01/urlzone_zones_inon.html)\nanalysis of the first Panda Banker campaign that we’ve seen to target financial institutions in\nJapan.\n\nPosted In\n\nAnalysis\nBotnets\nIndicators of Compromise\nInteresting Research\nMalware\nthreat analysis\n\n## Subscribe\n\n_Sign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from NETSCOUT's ASERT._\n\n\n-----",
