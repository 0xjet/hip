Even the most\nsophisticated malware implant on a target computer is useless if there is no way for it\nto communicate with its operators in a secure manner that does not draw attention.\nUsing Hive even if an implant is discovered on a target computer, attributing it to the\nCIA is difficult by just looking at the communication of the malware with other servers\non the internet. Hive provides a covert communications platform for a whole range of\nCIA malware to send exfiltrated information to CIA servers and to receive new\ninstructions from operators at the CIA.\n\nHive can serve multiple operations using multiple implants on target computers. Each\noperation anonymously registers at least one cover domain (e.g. \"perfectly-boringlooking-domain.com\") for its own use. The server running the domain website is rented\nfrom commercial hosting providers as a VPS (virtual private server) and its software is\ncustomized according to CIA specifications. These servers are the public-facing side of\nthe CIA back-end infrastructure and act as a relay for HTTP(S) traffic over a VPN\n[connection to a \"hidden\" CIA server called 'Blot'.\nsource: https://wikileaks.org/vault8/](https://wikileaks.org/vault8/)\n\n\n-----",
