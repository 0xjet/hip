It would seem that the choices made\nby the malware authors concerning these techniques and features depend on the\ncybercriminals’ financial resources and market knowledge.\n\nIn most cases financial malware favors exploit kits as their infection vector. In the past few\nmonths we have been actively monitoring an exploit kit, called Gongda, which is mainly\ntargeting South Korea. Interestingly, we have come across a piece of malware, known as\nCastov, being delivered by this exploit kit that targets specific South Korean financial\ncompanies and their customers. The cybercriminals in this case have done their research\non the South Korean online financial landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1. Heatmap of Gongda IPS detections for May 2013 (98% of hits are in South_**\n_Korea)_\n\n[The initial stage of this threat is Downloader.Castov and is compiled in Delphi with the](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-052411-0628-99)\nability to stop antivrius software which, once inside a computer, will report the infection to\nits command-and-control (C&C) server and download an encrypted file that is the second\nstage.\n\n[The second stage is Infostealer.Castov. The infostealer checks at specific offsets in a list](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-052416-2237-99)\nof clean DLLs (all related to Korean online banking software and security) for opcode\ninstructions and then patches those instructions. The injected code checks strings that\nappear to be passwords, account details, and transactions. Once the data is found and\ncollected, it will be sent to a remote server.\n\n**_Table 1. Targeted DLLs and actions taken_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the infostealer collects the digital certificates stored in the compromised\ncomputer’s NPKI directory (%ProgramFiles%\\NPKI). Those digital certificates are widely\nused in South Korea and are issued for financial general purposes (individual/corporate)\nsuch as banking, credit card, insurance etc. They are unique to each user and are valid for\none year.\n\nThe combination of screenshots, passwords, and digital certificates will allow the\ncybercriminals to access users’ financial accounts.\n\n**_Figure 2. Heatmap of Castov antivirus detection from January to May 2013_**\n\nSymantec has the following protection in place for both Castov and Gongda:\n\n**Antivirus protection:**\n\n[Downloader.Castov](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-052411-0628-99)\n[Infostealer.Castov](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-052416-2237-99)\n\n**Intrusion prevention protection:**\n\nTo ensure the best protection, we recommend you use the latest Symantec Technologies\nand up to date antivirus definitions.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
