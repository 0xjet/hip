    "plain_text": "# Back to School: Why Cybercriminals Continue to Target the Education Sector | Part Two\n\n**[ke-la.com/back-to-school-why-cybercriminals-continue-to-target-the-education-sector-2/](https://ke-la.com/back-to-school-why-cybercriminals-continue-to-target-the-education-sector-2/)**\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\n## A New Year, a New Beginning, and a New Round of Cyber Threats\n\n2020’s back to school is a bit different than usual as most students around the world are\ngetting ready to meet again with their peers online. Rather than worrying about the classic\nback to school activities, such as purchasing the most in-style school supplies or figuring out\nthe perfect outfit for day 1, students are more invested in finding the comfortable home setup\nfor online learning. School IT admins, on the other hand, are most concerned this year about\neducating their students and staff regarding cybersecurity as school begins remotely, while in\nparallel focusing heavily on deterring cyber threats from cybercriminals looking to attack\neducational institutions.\n\nIn our last blogpost, Back to School: Why Cybercriminals Continue to Target the Education\nSector, Part 1, we looked into threat actors’ overall interest in targeting organizations in the\neducation sector, diving into some examples of recent attempted attacks that we’ve spotted\nacross the underground ecosystem. This blogpost touched on several key points that helped\nestablish a general understanding of the threat level targeting educational institutions. We\ndecided to circle back to this topic because of the increasing risks that emerged as much of\nthe world begins to return to schools.\n\n[Schools already struggling with high cases of COVID-19 now must begin battling other](https://patch.com/florida/across-fl/cyber-attacks-give-miami-dade-public-schools-rough-start-new-academic-year)\nmishaps such as cyberattacks on their online learning platforms within their first days of\nremote learning. This situation occurred to one of the largest district schools in Florida and\nwas likely caused by a newbie in the underground world – an alleged 16-year old threat\nactor. This successful attack on a large school, by a supposedly young threat actor, may\nimply that planned attacks by more sophisticated and experienced threat actors are similarly\non their way.\n\n## Summer’s Over, but the Fun’s Just Beginning (for Cybercriminals)\n\nSince the release of our last post, we continued to monitor threat actors’ interest in the\neducation sector and laid out what other threats were seen in the underground ecosystem.\n\nOver the last month, KELA closely monitored many underground communities as well as\nspecialized auto shops where underground actors buy and sell credentials enabling remote\naccess to compromised websites and services. Out of more than 45 remote accesses that\nwe tracked over August alone, across the most popular three underground forums, we\n\n\n-----\n\nnoticed that 7 of those belong to educational institutions. These accesses were being sold\nmainly to UK or US educational institutions – with a couple in Australia and singles in Israel\nand Germany, too – at prices ranging from as little as 200 USD to as much as 17,000 USD.\n\nWe tried to assess what the price differences could mean in terms of the victims being\ntargeted. At times, it’s difficult to understand how valuable an access may be, solely based\non price and the limited detail published by the threat actor. However, after more in-depth\nreview of the accesses, we noticed that much of the time, threat actors are pricing the goods\nas they would with any other business – based on the revenue of the victim at hand. The\n\n\n-----\n\neducational institutions are viewed by many threat actors as just another business with\ngrowing revenue – and in that case, growing profits for the threat actors. Another factor that\ninfluences the price is access rights – whether the buyer will have access as a user or with\nadministrator privileges.\n\nThe relatively high price and the speed at which some listings are purchased do indicate the\nhigh demand for these items in the underground ecosystem. For example, one of the listings\nwas published for 5,660 USD and sold in less than a week.\n\nThough remote access has been growing in popularity in the underground ecosystem over\nthe last few years, compromised data still holds a significant place for cybercriminals. For\nexample, emails and passwords of a Singaporean school have been recently leaked for free,\nand personal data pertaining to US students has been offered for sale across underground\nmarketplaces. In addition, we’ve recently spotted credentials to 4 different university\n**FTP servers, some of which contain internal data – also leaked for free.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Some underground threat actors have been seen leveraging previously sold/leaked**\n**data pertaining to educational institutions. In a recent post, a threat actor published**\n**that he was offering data pertaining to an Australian Education Department, where upon**\nfurther research, it turned out to be [K7math – an online service providing school e-learning](https://www.zdnet.com/article/auscert-says-alleged-doe-hack-came-from-a-third-party/)\nsolutions – which was previously leaked in March. In both of these instances – both the initial\nMarch listing, and the later one – the data was leaked for free, likely a stunt for the threat\nactors looking to gain some good reputation in the underground communities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**As we continued to browse through different underground communities, we still**\n**noticed that there are newer players in the field who still claim against targeting the**\n**[education sector. For example, DarkSide, the new ransomware gang that has recently](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/23/beware-of-the-dark-side-a-sinister-new-1-million-cybersecurity-threat-darkside-ransomware/#1d2550f320e9)**\nemerged, states that it doesn’t attack schools and universities. However, it’s unlikely that\nmost cybercriminals will adopt this attitude since they couldn’t even get on board in terms of\ntargeting medical institutions during a pandemic.\n\n## Educational Institution Defenders: “Wake Me Up When September Ends”\n\n\n-----\n\nDefenders of educational institutions are likely still adapting to this new norm, but it really\ncomes down to two main actions that may help them deter attacks in the most efficient way\npossible.\n\n1. Educate – The safety of these institutions is nothing less than team effort. These\n\ndefenders must invest in standard cybersecurity awareness for all students and staff to\nensure that best practices are held in order to keep personal information and\ninformation systems secure. The potential damage that can be caused may begin from\na small mistake caused by one individual, for example opening a malicious attachment\nreceived via email, which may enable a threat actor the initial foothold required to enter\nthe institution’s systems.\n2. Invest in Threat Intelligence – Cyberattacks generally occur after a long process of\n\nseveral different details combined. Organizations – and specifically in this case,\neducational ones – must invest in strategic monitoring of their assets, whether it be\ntheir domains, IT admins’ personal details, IP addresses, or any other assets that can\nhelp threat actors initiate an attack on them. By investing in technologies that enable\nefficient and undetectable monitoring of their assets in underground marketplaces and\nforums, educational institution defenders can better prepare themselves for potential\nincoming threats that are targeting them.\n\n\n-----",
