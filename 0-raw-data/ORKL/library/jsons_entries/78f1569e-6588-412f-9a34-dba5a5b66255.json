It first appeared**\nin April 2015, and now has over 25 variants, some of which are still active in 2017. Yet, there aren't\n[many technical descriptions for it - except for the initial Ztorg.A sample - so I decided to have a look](http://www.fortiguard.com/encyclopedia/virus/6651192)\nat one of the newer variants, Android/Ztorg.AM!tr, that we detected on January 20, 2017.\n\nThe sample poses a \"Cool Video Player\" and its malicious activity was so well hidden I initially\n**thought I had run into a False Positive. Definitely not, however, as we'll see.**\n\n## Locating the Malicious Code\n\nThe sample's manifest shows the main activity is located in\ncom.mx.cool.videoplayer.activity.MainActivity.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis activity initializes multiple SDKs, from which I could not detect malicious intent:\n\ncom.adjust: [Adjust SDK, for app analytics](https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk)\n[com.batmobi: Batmobi for mobile advertising](https://www.batmobi.net/page/index.html)\ncom.catchgift: code shows this is clearly for advertising\n[com.marswin89: this is a MarsDaemon, a library to keep apps alive. Interesting, but not](https://github.com/Marswin/MarsDaemon)\nmalicious as such.\ncom.squareup: well-known mobile payment\ncom.umeng: well-known mobile advertising & analytics\n\nSo, where is the malicious code? Or is it just some not-so-clean code in one of these SDKs that\ntriggered a (false positive) alert?\n\nI kept on looking in other namespaces of the app:\n\nu.aly contained code for Mobclick - advertising again (hey, for the sake of AV analysts at least,\ncan you developers stop using so many advertising SDKs, huh?),\nandroid.support.v4 is standard for app development.\nNamespace e.i.o.q isn't doing anything apart calling functions from the a namespace.\n\nSo, that's when I started looking into namespace a...\n\n## String Obfuscation\n\nI immediately noticed many obfuscated strings, and couldn't resist de-obfuscating them (after all,\nI'm the Crypto Girl, right?).\n\nFor instance, we have this:\n\nand c.a() is implemented as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis basically takes the first and last byte as XOR key for the rest of the byte array. From that, I\nwrote a quick standalone Python decoder, mimicking the decompiled code. It is handy, but as I\nuse [JEB2 a script is even better where I can have it replace the strings directly in the decompiled](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/)\noutput.\n\n**JEB scripts are a little trickier to write. Mine parses the decompiled classes, and in each class**\nlocates statements with a c.a(new byte[] { ... }). The call to the decoding function occurs in several\nsituations though, e.g v0[6] = c.a(new byte[]{... but also a = new String(c.a(new byte[]{....\nConsequently, the right hand side of the line needs to be analyzed quite closely. Then, when a call\nis detected, the script decodes the value, and replaces it with the result.\n\nFor example, the first figure (on the left) illustrates the initial decompiled code for a.a.a. The second\nfigure shows the result after applying the script.\n\n[My scripts are available on Github.](https://github.com/cryptax/misc-code)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Emulator Detection\n\nAmong the decoded strings, we notice many references to VirtualBox, QEMU etc. This is\nemulator detection, and we'll see that it is particularly advanced.\n\nLet's go back to the flow of execution. The onCreate() method of the main activity ( MainActivity)\ncalls f(), which calls e.i.o.q.d(). Reversing e.i.o.q.d(), we understand the function tests whether it is\nrunning on an emulator or not. It only runs the malicious part if not on an emulator, which\nexplains why sandboxes won't be able to record any malicious activity.\n\n**The emulator detection routine is particularly advanced and extensive. It detects standard**\n**Android emulators, Genymotion emulators, Bluestacks emulators,** **[BuilDroid VMs, and also](http://jeeradate.com/wp/?p=345)**\n**tainted environments that use** **[TaintDroid.](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Enck.pdf)**\n\nThe detection is based on:\n\n1. Specific values in system properties. This is quite standard, except the tests are particularly\n\nextensive (see Table) in this case.\n2. Typical values for IMEI, IMSI and phone number on emulators. On Genymotion, the IMEI can\n\nbe customized, but not the IMSI. On standard Android SDK emulators, none of these are\neasily customizable. It is possible to patch and re-compile one's emulator.\n3. Presence of specific files. For example, /dev/qemu_pipe. From an AV analyst's perspective,\n\nthis is difficult to counter, because many of the emulating environments won't work properly\nwithout these files.\n4. Checking values in given system files. In particular, it's the first time I have seen malware\n\n**checking values inside /proc/net/tcp. This is interesting: the file records active TCP**\nconnections. The first column corresponds to the number of entries, second column is local\naddress, third column local port, and fourth column remote address. On a real device, we\nhave something like this:\n\n0: 4604D20A:B512 A3D13AD8...\n\nBut on emulators, the addresses are zeroed and easily noticeable:\n\n0: 00000000:0016 00000000:0000\n\n1. Specific TaintDroid class (dalvik.system.Taint) and injected fields (name in FileDescriptor\n\nclass and key in Cipher). The code was probably inspired from Tim Strazzere's Anti Emulator\ncode.\n\n## Downloading Remote Content\n\nWe have seen that the sample implements advanced emulator detection. However, many clean\napps do that for various reasons. So where is the malicious stuff? At this point, we aren't convinced\nyet that this is not a False Positive.\n\n\n-----\n\nActually, we re getting closer. After the sample has tested it is not running on an emulator, it sends\n**an HTTP request to hXXp://bbs.tihalf.com/only/[$1]/2.html?. This is a URL we de-obfuscated at the**\nprevious step. The [$1] is replaced with gp1187 (another de-obfuscated string), and an information\nblob is appended to the url, where the blob is a DES-encrypted JSON object containing code\nversion, SDK version, etc.\n\nThis is getting more suspicious.\n\nThe response is base64 encoded, and encrypted with DES-CBC (see class a.c.a):\n\nThe key is hard-coded (it's the de-obfuscated string sokhlwej) and the IV is DES_e.IV = new byte[]\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};. We decrypt the server's response:\n\nWe notice that o and p contain a link to an Android package. Are they used? Yes! As soon as the\nJSON object is retrieved, the sample reads the URL in o and tries to download the file. If\never o does not work, it tries p.\n\nSo, basically, in this case, the sample downloads another Android package\n**from hXXp://alla.tihalf.com/only/gp1187/gp1187.apk and stores it locally on the smartphone.**\n\nBut we are not done yet. The downloaded APK is not in clear text:\n\n\n-----\n\n**It is XOR-ed with 0x99 (see code excerpt of class a.d.f) and copied to a file named dba.jar:**\n\nThis indeed results in a valid Android package:\n\nAnd then? It loads the downloaded application, of course! See code below - taken from a.d.n.\n\nThe installation of the application is done via DexClassLoader and is invisible to the end-user.\n\nFinally, it invokes a method of that application. Specifically, it loads the class referenced by key q in\nthe JSON object, and invokes method h from the JSON object:\n\nIn our case, q is n.a.c.q and h is c, so the sample invokes n.a.c.q.c().\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThis Ztorg sample does a very good job of concealing its maliciousness, but we can confirm\nthat it is malicious and not a False Positive.\n\nIt implements many emulator detection features. It detects the Android SDK emulator, but\n**also emulators from Genymotion, Bluestacks and BuilDroid. It also detects tainted**\n**environments. Several of its checks will be difficult to bypass.**\nIt uses string obfuscation, based on XOR.\nIt communicates with a remote server using DES-CBC encryption.\nIt downloads, installs and launches an Android application from that remote server.\n\n[In part 2 of this analysis, we will examine the downloaded application.](http://blog.fortinet.com/2017/03/08/teardown-of-android-ztorg-part-2)\n\n--
