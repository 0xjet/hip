Karakurt actors have employed a variety of tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Karakurt\nvictims have not reported encryption of compromised machines or files; rather, Karakurt\nactors have claimed to steal data and threatened to auction it off or release it to the public\nunless they receive payment of the demanded ransom. Known ransom demands have\nranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire\nwithin a week of first contact with the victim.\n\nKarakurt actors have typically provided screenshots or copies of stolen file directories as\nproof of stolen data. Karakurt actors have contacted victims’ employees, business partners,\n[and clients [T1591.002] with harassing emails and phone calls to pressure the victims to](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1591/002/)\ncooperate. The emails have contained examples of stolen data, such as social security\nnumbers, payment accounts, private company emails, and sensitive business data belonging\nto employees or clients. Upon payment of ransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some\nform of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a brief statement explaining how the initial\nintrusion occurred.\n\nPrior to January 5, 2022, Karakurt operated a leaks and auction website found at\nhttps://karakurt[.]group. The domain and IP address originally hosting the website went\noffline in the spring 2022. The website is no longer accessible on the open internet, but has\nbeen reported to be located elsewhere in the deep web and on the dark web. As of May\n2022, the website contained several terabytes of data purported to belong to victims across\nNorth America and Europe, along with several “press releases” naming victims who had not\npaid or cooperated, and instructions for participating in victim data “auctions.”\n\n[Download the PDF version of this report (pdf, 442kb).](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-152A_Karakurt_Data_Extortion_Group.pdf)\n\n[Click here for STIX.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-152A.stix.xml)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Initial Intrusion**\n\nKarakurt does not appear to target any specific sectors, industries, or types of victims. During\n[reconnaissance [TA0043], Karakurt actors appear to obtain access to victim devices](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0043/)\nprimarily:\n\n[By purchasing stolen login credentials [T1589.001] [T1589.002];](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/001/)\nVia cooperating partners in the cybercrime community, who provide Karakurt access to\nalready compromised victims; or\nThrough buying access to already compromised victims via third-party intrusion broker\n[networks [T1589.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/001/)\n\n**Note: Intrusion brokers, or intrusion broker networks, are malicious individual**\ncyber actors or groups of actors who use a variety of tools and skills to obtain\ninitial access to—and often create marketable persistence within—protected\ncomputer systems. Intrusion brokers then sell access to these compromised\ncomputer systems to other cybercriminal actors, such as those engaged in\nransomware, business email compromise, corporate and government espionage,\netc.\n\n[Common intrusion vulnerabilities exploited for initial access [TA001] in Karakurt events](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0001/)\ninclude the following:\n\n[Outdated SonicWall SSL VPN appliances [T1133] are vulnerable to multiple recent](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1133/)\nCVEs\n[Log4j “Log4Shell” Apache Logging Services vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) [T1190]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1190/)\n[Phishing and spearphishing [T1566]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1566/)\n[Malicious macros within email attachments [T1566.001]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1566/001/)\nStolen virtual private network (VPN) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials\n\n[[T1078]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1078/)\n[Outdated Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances [T1133]/firewall appliances [T1190]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1133/)\nare vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs\nOutdated and/or unserviceable Microsoft Windows Server instances\n\n**Network Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Persistence, and Exfiltration**\n\nUpon developing or obtaining access to a compromised system, Karakurt actors deploy\n[Cobalt Strike beacons to enumerate a network [T1083], install Mimikatz to pull plain-text](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1083/)\n[credentials [T1078], use AnyDesk to obtain persistent remote control [T1219], and utilize](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1078/)\nadditional situation-dependent tools to elevate privileges and move laterally within a network.\n\nKarakurt actors then compress (typically with 7zip) and exfiltrate large sums of data—and, in\nmany cases, entire network-connected shared drives in volumes exceeding 1 terabyte (TB)\n[—using open source applications and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services [T1048] such as](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1048/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Filezilla, and cloud storage services including rclone and Mega.nz [T1567.002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1567/002/)\n\n**Extortion**\n\nFollowing the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by\nway of “readme.txt” files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email\nnetworks, and emails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. The ransom\nnotes reveal the victim has been hacked by the “Karakurt Team” and threaten public release\nor auction of the stolen data. The instructions include a link to a TOR URL with an access\ncode. Visiting the URL and inputting the access code open a chat application over which\nvictims can negotiate with Karakurt actors to have their data deleted.\n\nKarakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which\nemployees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning\nthe recipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the\ndissemination of victim data. These communications often included samples of stolen data—\nprimarily personally identifiable information (PII), such as employment records, health\nrecords, and financial business records.\n\nVictims who negotiate with Karakurt actors receive a “proof of life,” such as screenshots\nshowing file trees of allegedly stolen data or, in some cases, actual copies of stolen files.\nUpon reaching an agreement on the price of the stolen data with the victims, Karakurt actors\nprovided a Bitcoin address—usually a new, previously unused address—to which ransom\npayments could be made. Upon receiving the ransom, Karakurt actors provide some form of\nalleged proof of deletion of the stolen files, such as a screen recording of the files being\ndeleted, a deletion log, or credentials for a victim to log into a storage server and delete the\nfiles themselves.\n\nAlthough Karakurt’s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep\nthe incident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the\nconfidentiality of victim information after a ransom was paid. Note: the U.S. government\nstrongly discourages the payment of any ransom to Karakurt threat actors, or any cyber\ncriminals promising to delete stolen files in exchange for payments.\n\nIn some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked\nby other ransomware variants. In such cases, Karakurt actors likely purchased or otherwise\nobtained previously stolen data. Karakurt actors have also targeted victims at the same time\nthese victims were under attack by other ransomware actors. In such cases, victims received\nransom notes from multiple ransomware variants simultaneously, suggesting Karakurt actors\npurchased access to a compromised system that was also sold to another ransomware\nactor.\n\n\n-----\n\nKarakurt actors have also exaggerated the degree to which a victim had been compromised\nand the value of data stolen. For example, in some instances, Karakurt actors claimed to\nsteal volumes of data far beyond the storage capacity of compromised systems or claimed to\nsteal data that did not belong to the victim.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Email**\n\nmark.hubert1986@gmail.com; karakurtlair@gmail.com;\npersonal.information.reveal@gmail.com; ripidelfun1986@protonmail.com;\ngapreappballye1979@protonmail.com; confedicial.datas.download@protonmail.com;\narmada.mitchell94@protonmail.com\n\n_Protonmail email accounts in the following formats:_\n\nvictimname_treasure@protonmail.com\n\nvictimname_jewels@protonmail.com\n\nvictimname_files@protonmail.com\n\n**Tools**\n\nOnion site https://omx5iqrdbsoitf3q4xexrqw5r5tfw7vp3vl3li3lfo7saabxazshnead.onion\n\nTools Rclone.exe;; AnyDesk.exe; Mimikatz\n\nNgrok SSH tunnel application SHA256 3e625e20d7f00b6d5121bb0a71cfa61f92d658bcd61af2cf5397e0ae28f4ba56\n\n\nDLLs\nmasquerading\nas legitimate\nMicrosoft\nbinaries to\nSystem32\n\n\nMscxxx.dll: SHA1 - c33129a680e907e5f49bcbab4227c0b02e191770\n\nMsuxxx.dll: SHA1 - 030394b7a2642fe962a7705dcc832d2c08d006f5\n\n\nMsxsl.exe Legitimate Microsoft Command Line XSL Transformation Utility SHA1 8B516E7BE14172E49085C4234C9A53C6EB490A45\n\ndllhosts.exe Rclone SHA1 - fdb92fac37232790839163a3cae5f37372db7235\n\nrclone.conf Rclone configuration file\n\nfilter.txt Rclone file extension filter file\n\nc.bat UNKNOWN\n\n3.bat UNKNOWN\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA1 - 0E50B289C99A35F4AD884B6A3FFB76DE4B6EBC14\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Tools**\n\nPotential\nmalicious\ndocument\n\n**Tools**\n\n\nPotential malicious\ndocument\n\n\nSHA1 7E654C02E75EC78E8307DBDF95E15529AAAB5DFF\n\n\nMalicious text file SHA1 4D7F4BB3A23EAB33A3A28473292D44C5965DDC95\n\nMalicious text file SHA1 10326C2B20D278080AA0CA563FC3E454A85BB32F\n\n**Cobalt Strike hashes**\n\nSHA256 563BC09180FD4BB601380659E922C3F7198306E0CAEBE99CD1D88CD2C3FD5C1B\n\nSHA256 5E2B2EBF3D57EE58CADA875B8FBCE536EDCBBF59ACC439081635C88789C67ACA\n\nSHA256 712733C12EA3B6B7A1BCC032CC02FD7EC9160F5129D9034BF9248B27EC057BD2\n\nSHA256 563BC09180FD4BB601380659E922C3F7198306E0CAEBE99CD1D88CD2C3FD5C1B\n\nSHA256 5E2B2EBF3D57EE58CADA875B8FBCE536EDCBBF59ACC439081635C88789C67ACA\n\nSHA256 712733C12EA3B6B7A1BCC032CC02FD7EC9160F5129D9034BF9248B27EC057BD2\n\nSHA1 - 86366bb7646dcd1a02700ed4be4272cbff5887af\n\n**Ransom**\n**note text**\n**sample:**\n\nHere's the deal\n\nWe breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom**\n**note text**\n**sample:**\n\n2.
