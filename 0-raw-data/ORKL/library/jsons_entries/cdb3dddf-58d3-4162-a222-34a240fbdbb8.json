This group is known by several different\nnames: Tick, Redbaldknight and Bronze Butler.\n\nAlthough each campaign employed custom tools, Talos has observed recurring patterns in\nthe actor's use of infrastructure, from overlaps in hijacked command and control (C2)\ndomains to differing campaign C2s resolving to the same IP. These infrastructure patterns\nindicate similarities between the Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi malware families. In\nthis post, we will dive into these parallels and examine the methods used by this actor.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe APT threat actor known as \"Tick,\" \"Bronze Butler,\" and \"Redbaldknight\" has conducted\nespionage campaigns since 2016 against East Asian countries such as Japan and South\n[Korea [1]. Talos analyzed a recent campaign in which compromised websites located in](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/redbaldknight-bronze-butler-daserf-backdoor-now-using-steganography/)\nSouth Korea and Japan were used as C2 servers for samples belonging to the malware\nfamily known as \"Datper,\" which has the ability to execute shell commands on the victim\nmachine and obtain hostnames and drive information. Talos found potential links in\nshared infrastructure between the malware families Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi,\neach of which has been attributed to this threat actor under one of the above three aliases.\nWe obtained this Datper variant through VirusTotal. The sample, written in Delphi code,\nwas submitted toward the end of July 2018. Although the exact attack vector is unclear,\nthe threat actor appears to have selected a legitimate-but-vulnerable Korean laundry\nservice website to host their C2, shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nLegitimate Korean laundry site used as Datper C2 host.\n\nThe website, located at whitepia[.]co.kr, does not use SSL encryption or certificates. The\nspecific URL used for C2 communication is:\nhxxp://whitepia[.]co[.]kr/bbs/include/JavaScript.php\n\nOnce executed, the Datper variant creates a mutex object called \"gyusbaihysezhrj\" and\nretrieves several pieces of information from the victim machine, including system\ninformation and keyboard layout. Afterward, the sample attempts to issue an HTTP GET\nrequest to the above C2 server, which at the time of this writing, resolved to the IP\n111[.]92[.]189[.]19.\n\nAn example of this request is:\n\nGET /bbs/include/JavaScript.php?ycmt=de4fd712fa7e104f1apvdogtw HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\nHost: whitepia[.]co.kr\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of this investigation, the C2 server was unavailable, preventing\nTalos from investigating C2 communications in greater detail. However, Talos was able to\nanalyze a previous campaign from 2017, which employed a similar sample from this\nfamily and used a slightly different mutex, \"d4fy3ykdk2ddssr.\" All samples in the diagram\nbelow, associated with the 2017 campaign, implemented mutex object \"d4fy3ykdk2ddssr,\"\nlikely to prevent access from other processes during execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nStructure of C2 communications from the 2017 campaign.\n\nThe actor behind this campaign deployed and managed their C2 infrastructure mainly in\nSouth Korea and Japan. We confirmed that the actor periodically changed their C2\ninfrastructure and appears to have a history of identifying and penetrating vulnerable\nwebsites located in these countries. In addition to whitepia[.]co[.]kr, we identified other\ninstances of compromised websites used as C2 servers. It is possible the malware\nsamples are being delivered using web-based attacks, such as drive-by downloads or\nwatering hole attacks. Additionally, Talos identified hosts used as C2 servers that may not\nbe connected to a compromised website. This indicates the possibility that the threat\nactor may have initially deployed their C2 server infrastructure on legitimately obtained\n(and potentially purchased) hosts.\nOverlaps in the compromised websites used as C2 domains suggest links to another\nmalware family known as \"xxmm backdoor\" (or alternatively, \"Murim\" or \"Wrim\"), a\nmalware family that allows an attacker to install additional malware. The GET request URI\npaths of xxmm backdoor and Datper are similar, as seen below:\n\n**xxmm backdoor: hxxp://www.amamihanahana.com/diary/archives/a_/2/index.php**\n\n**Datper: hxxp://www.amamihanahana.com/contact/contact_php/jcode/set.html**\n\nBased on the findings above, both tools have used the same websites located in Japan in\ntheir C2 infrastructure since 2016.\n\nThe xxmm sample, shown on the right-hand side of the diagram above, has the hash\n[397a5e9dc469ff316c2942ba4b503ff9784f2e84e37ce5d234a87762e0077e25 [2].](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/labs-shadowwali-new-variant-of-the-xxmm-family-of-backdoors)\n\nThe extracted PDB debug symbol paths from the sample are:\n\nC:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2010\\Projects\\shadowWalker\\Release\\BypassUacDll.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\n2010\\Projects\\shadowWalker\\Release\\loadSetup.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\123\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\xxmm2\\Release\\test2.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\123\\Desktop\\xxmm3\\x64\\Release\\ReflectivLoader.pdb\n\nIn addition to the links between Datper and xxmm backdoor, a recent Datper variant\ncompiled in March 2018 used a legitimate website as a C2, which resolved to the IP\n211[.]13[.]196[.]164. This same IP was used as C2 infrastructure by the Emdivi malware\nfamily — a trojan that opens a backdoor on the compromised machine — and was\n[attributed to the threat actor behind the campaign \"Blue termite\" [3].](https://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2015/11/emdivi-and-the-rise-of-targeted-attacks-in-japan.html)\n\nStructure of 2018 Datper and Emdivi campaigns.\n\nOur passive DNS lookup data of Resource Records (RR) for domains used by Datper and\nEmdivi further suggest that this IP was used by both malware families.\n\nResource record for Datper.\n\nResource record for Emdivi.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTalos' investigation into attacks conducted by this actor indicates commonalities between\nthe Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi malware families. Specifically, these similarities\n\n\n-----\n\nand may have been purchased by the attacker. Successful attacks utilizing these malware\nfamilies may result in shell commands being run on victim machines, resulting in a\npotential leak of sensitive information.
