Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide\ninformation about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow\nyou to produce simple network signatures.\n\nFilename : Kashmir_conflict_actions.docx\nFile Type : MS Word Document\nFile size   300.00 KB (300000 bytes)\n\n**Stage 1 (Macro enabled document dropper) :**\n\n_Kashmir_conflict_actions.docx_\n\n**Kashmir_conflict_actions.docx contains a macro which in turn makes a remote**\n**SQL query to C2 server (Datroapp[.]mssql.somee.com) and writes the second**\nstage payload to \"\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\Trayicos.exe\" and launches the payload\n\n\n-----\n\n_1st stage macro payload_\n\n**Stage 2 (Dropper) :**\n\nBasic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual\ninstructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide\ninformation about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow\nyou to produce simple network signatures.\n\nFilename : TrayIcos.exe\nFile Type : PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit\nFile size  : 2.4 MB (2519552 bytes)\nMD5 : 18ACD5EBED316061F885F54F82F00017\nSignature : Microsoft Visual C++ 8\n\nInitial looks at the PE file straight up looks like a payload loader of some sorts specially\nlooking at the resource section of the file we can see a data blob with bigger size than\nusual and an exceptionally high entropy value.\n\n_Pestudio resource viewer_\n\nFurther analysis indicates the same with a import chain of :\n\nFindResource -> LoadResource -> LockResource -> SizeofResource -> FreeResource\n\n\n-----\n\n_Getting 3rd stage payload from resource_\n\nWe can clearly conclude the encrypted data block located in the resource section is the\n3rd stage payload.\n\nAfter some dynamic analysis we are able to decrypt the **3rd stage payload. However**\nwe are not finished yet ! Once the 3rd stage payload is decrypted which in turn is\nrevealed as a .NET assembly its loaded in the memory space of the same unmanaged\nprocess \"TrayIcos.exe\" .\n\n\n-----\n\n_Payload decryption_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Managed payload method called from unmanaged parent dropper_\n\n**Stage 3 (Third stage dropper):**\n\nBasic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual\ninstructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide\ninformation about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow\nyou to produce simple network signatures.\n\nFilename : Random.dll\nFile Type : C# dynamic link library / .Net Assembly\nFile size  : 2.3 MB (2441216 bytes)\nMD5 : 4A22A43CCAB88B1CA50FA183E6FFB6FA\nSignature : Microsoft Visual C# v7.0 / Basic .NET\n\nWe get a unpacked / obfuscated C# assembly which we dumped during the dynamic\nanalysis of the 2nd stage dropper.\n\nThe functionality of the dropper is pretty straight forward payload from resource and\nthen execute entrypoint of the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3rd stage dropper**\n\n**Stage 4 (Crimson RAT):**\n\nFinal stage includes execution of our crown king Crimson Remote Access Trojan.\n\nBasic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual\ninstructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide\ninformation about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow\nyou to produce simple network signatures.\n\nFilename : TrayIcos.exe\nFile Type : PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit\nMono/.Net assembly\n\n\n-----\n\nFile size  : 2.2 MB (2295808 bytes)\nMD5 : 5A27D092E4A87554206F677B4EADC6F5\nSignature : Microsoft Visual C# v7.0 / Basic .NET\nPacker : .Net Reactor\n\nCrimson RAT supports basic functionalities a remote access trojan should have like\nscreen capture, screen size enumeration, commands execution, process list, process kill,\netc.\n\nHowever the functionalities differ from variant to variant and are stripped in many\nsamples however the complete list of all functionalities supported by the framework are\nlisted below :\n\n_Functionalities_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Command parser and functionalities of crimson rat_\n\nPersistence mechanism is the least notable and extremely basic in nature\n\n_HKCU Run key persistence_\n\nC2 communication is implemented using simple TCP protocol with no added\nencryption / encoding even which is highly disappointing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_C2 connection using TCP_\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n[Overall Transparent Tribe's tradecraft might seem lackluster but since their inception in](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0115/)\n2013 they have been quite successful according to statistics in executing their plans and\nconducting espionage campaigns on daily basis. However our customers are protected\n[against this threat. Additionally, Scrutiny Anti Malware properly files used by](https://cyberstanc.com/scrutiny/)\nTransparent Tribe as malicious.\n\n\n-----",
