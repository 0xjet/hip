These were against a\nrange of Georgian web hosting providers and resulted in websites being defaced, including\nsites belonging to the Georgian Government, courts, non-government organisations (NGOs),\nmedia and businesses, and also interrupted the service of several national broadcasters.\n\nThese cyber-attacks are part of Russia’s long-running campaign of hostile and destabilising\nactivity against Georgia. The UK is clear that the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)\nconducted these cyber-attacks in an attempt to undermine Georgia’s sovereignty, to sow\ndiscord and disrupt the lives of ordinary Georgian people. The UK remains unwavering in its\nsupport for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GRU (Russia s military intelligence service) s reckless and brazen campaign of\ncyber-attacks against Georgia, a sovereign and independent nation, is totally\nunacceptable.\n\nThe Russian government has a clear choice: continue this aggressive pattern of\nbehaviour against other countries, or become a responsible partner which respects\ninternational law.\n\nThe UK will continue to expose those who conduct reckless cyber-attacks and work\nwith our allies to counter the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)’s menacing\nbehaviour.\n\n## Background\n\nThe UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)) assess\nthat the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service) was almost certainly (95% +)\nresponsible for defacing websites, cyber-attacks and interruption to TV channels in Georgia\nin October 2019.\n\nFind further details on the framework used by the UK government for all source intelligence\nassessments, including the probability yardstick.\n\nGiven the NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)’s assessment and the broader context,\nthe UK government has made the judgement that the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence\nservice) was responsible.\n\nThe cyber programme responsible for these disruptions is known in open source variously as\nthe Sandworm team, BlackEnergy Group, Telebots, and VoodooBear. It is operated by the\nGRU (Russia’s military intelligence service)’s Main Centre of Special Technologies, often\nreferred to by the abbreviation “GTsST” or its field post number 74455.\n\nThis is the first significant example of the GRU (Russia’s military intelligence service) using\ncyber-attacks to disrupt or destroy since late 2017. This Unit of the GRU (Russia’s military\nintelligence service) was responsible for:\n\nBlackEnergy: December 2015 shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, with 230,000\npeople losing power for between 1 to 6 hours\n\nIndustroyer: December 2016 shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, also known as\nCrashOverride. It resulted in a fifth of Kyiv losing power for an hour. It is the first known\nmalware designed specifically to disrupt electricity grids\n\nNotPetya: June 2017 destructive cyber-attack targeting the Ukrainian financial, energy\nand government sectors and affecting other European and Russian businesses\n\n\n-----\n\nBadRabbit: October 2017 ransomware encrypted hard drives and rendered IT\ninoperable. This caused disruption including to the Kyiv metro, Odessa airport, Russia’s\ncentral bank and 2 Russian media outlets\n\nGeorgia is a strategic partner to the UK. The UK supports a range of projects in Georgia and\n[our annual Ministerial-level UK-Georgia Strategic Dialogue provides an important framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-georgia-joint-statement)\nfor continuing to develop our strong relationship. The UK was particularly grateful for\n[Georgia’s firm support following the attack on Salisbury in 2018, including in efforts to](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/novichok-nerve-agent-use-in-salisbury-uk-government-response)\nstrengthen the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW (Organisation\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons)).\n\n## Further information\n\nMedia enquiries\n\nFor journalists\n\n[Email newsdesk@fco.gov.uk](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:newsdesk@fco.gov.uk)\n\n\n-----",
