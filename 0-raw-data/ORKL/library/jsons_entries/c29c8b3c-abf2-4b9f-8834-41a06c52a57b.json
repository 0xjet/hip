Dina Temple-Raston,\nhost of the Click Here podcast, reports.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Halloween, a message appeared on the Yanluowang ransomware group s extortion site:\n“Check and mate! Yanluowang Matrix chat hacked,” it began. “Time’s up;) you screwed!!”\n\nIt announced that the contents of one of the group’s discussion channels – some 2,700\nmessages sent between January and September 2022 – had been breached and was now\nuploaded to a leak site that allowed researchers, law enforcement, and even competitors to\nunderstand how the group was organized, how it interacted with other ransomware actors,\nand who might be in charge.\n\n“We wanted to dig into the internal chats and figure out what we could locate there — what\ntheir TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] tradecraft is, was there any collaboration\n[with other ransomware families, “said Jambul Tologonov, a researcher at the cybersecurity](https://www.trellix.com/en-hk/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/jambul-tologonov.html)\nfirm Trellix. “That’s what my mindset was when I started the investigation, and the first thing I\nnoticed was that their conversations were all in Russian.”\n\n[The finding confirmed something researchers had long suspected: Yanluowang members](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/yanluowang-ransomware-leaks-analysis.html)\nwere just masquerading as Chinese hackers. The name was a ruse. Cybersecurity firm\nSymantec first discovered the group in October 2021, and it soon got a reputation: It was\nclearly human-run, was reasonably skilled, and it targeted Western companies. Two of its\n[most infamous targets: Cisco and Walmart.](https://therecord.media/cisco-confirms-may-attack-by-yanluowang-ransomware-group/)\n\nChat logs are particularly popular with researchers and law enforcement because they can\nprovide a window into the inner workings of a cybercriminal enterprise. Members speak\nfreely, they have their guard down, and it doesn’t take much effort to work out who is in\ncharge.\n\nEarlier this year, the chat logs from a Russian-speaking ransomware group named Conti\nwere leaked, and the trove provided all kinds of clues about how they were organized, what\nkinds of hacking tools they used, and the relationships they had with other hacking groups\nand Russian law enforcement. In that case, there were tens of thousands of chat logs to\ncomb through. In comparison, the Yanluowang cache is relatively small.\n\nAs soon as the leak message popped up on the group’s TOR site — which uses opensource software to conceal visitors’ location and identities — and Tologonov could confirm it\nwas real, he downloaded messages and began digging in. He said he usually begins by\nwriting a Python script to pre-process the messages to make them easier to read. Then, he\nputs them in chronological order so he can follow the message thread.\n\n“It allows me to get a good understanding of who’s talking with whom,” Tologonov said.\n\nBased on the messages, it was clear someone with the name “Saint” was a high-ranking\nmember of the group. In mid-February, Saint was telling someone named coder0 how to set\nup a leak page on TOR, short for The Onion Router. “Felix is a tester,” he wrote. “I pay his\nsalary for that.”\n\n\n-----\n\nSaint tasked another penetration tester with looking at the TOR administrator panel. If you\nneed to test something, write here to Felix,” the chat continued. Small details, to be sure, but\ndata points that can be gathered together to get a sense of the group.\n\n**Ready Coder One**\n\nTologonov gleaned other clues. Coder0, for example, seemed to be the group’s developer of\na Windows-based ransomware strain, and he had a team of coders under him. Another\nhacker named Kilanas is allegedly a member at the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense.\n\nSaint appears to have gotten around as well. Tologonov said that he tracked down some of\nhis other aliases, including “sailormorgan32.”\n\n“That was a very interesting discovery because last year someone named sailormorgan32\nposted on the dark web that they’d been part of a group that hacked SonicWall,” Tologonov\nsaid, referring to last year’s [attack on the company that makes firewalls for virtual private](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-firewall-maker-hacked-using-zero-day-in-its-vpn-device/)\nnetworks.\n\n“He claimed that they managed to get $5 million from the organization,” Tologonov said. “We\ndon’t know if the claim is true or not, but in the conversation someone asks him [Saint], isn’t\n_sailormorgan32 one of your monikers? And he says, indeed, it is mine. It’s time for me to go_\n_sleep.”_\n\nThe chats also provide insight into how various ransomware groups are pooling resources\nand working together.\n\n**Hello Guki. HelloKitty.**\n\n[The chats also reveal links to other groups, like the infamous HelloKitty ransomware gang,](https://therecord.media/the-fbi-believes-the-hellokitty-ransomware-gang-operates-out-of-ukraine/)\nwhich the FBI believes to be based in Ukraine. A hacker named Guki, who’s thought to be a\nHelloKitty member, appeared in the chats this May, complaining about having dozens of\nworking credentials – usernames and passwords – but lacking the manpower to exploit them\nall.\n\n“That’s why I’m reaching out to you,” the chat reads. “Maybe we can work together on further\ncompromises.” He also mentions that they are developing everything on their own. When\nSaint asked him what software his group was using, Guki replied: “the same as before,\nkittens.”\n\nResearchers love to analyze these kinds of leaked chats because it allows them to observe\nhackers with their guard down. What doesn’t make sense, though, given what these hackers\nare doing for work, is that they don’t encrypt their messages. You’d think that would be\nHacker 101. Tologonov said that surprises him, too.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat was also an interesting thing for me, he said. You d think some part of the messages\nwould have been encrypted which would have made it hard for me as a security researcher\nto reconstruct all of this. I’d have trouble putting it all in context. But because it isn’t\nencrypted as soon as I pre-process the messages and put it in chronological order, as a\nRussian speaker, it is easy to read it.”\n\n[John Fokker, head of threat intelligence at Trellix, did a lot of research when the Conti Leaks](https://www.trellix.com/en-sg/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/john-fokker.html)\ncame out earlier this year. He thinks the Yanluowang leaks came from a private server the\ngroup set up to speak among themselves and he believes they fell prey to a common\nproblem: they trusted the technology.\n\n“When people start trusting technology and they trust the encryption to give them safety, they\nwill let their guard down and you get these interesting chats,” he said. “As a researcher from\nthe sidelines, I’m always very eager to receive these chats because it really ties the Russian\ncybercriminal ecoclimate together. You can see how Yanluowang is tied to other\norganizations.”\n\nFokker said he and his researchers had always had a gut feeling that these ransomware\ngroups weren’t huge – that there was a hardcore group that does this and they know about\neach other. “And it’s very interesting to read things [just as] they read our research — they\nlook at other busts, and they watch other crime groups. It gives us a lot of insight.”\n\nThe question is always whether these leaks provide so much insight the groups end up\nhaving to disband. In the case of Yanluowang, its site disappeared soon after the chat logs\nwent public. Tologonov said the group probably won’t vanish, they will just get absorbed into\nother ransomware crews and keep doing what they’ve been doing.\n\n“The group is not that big,” he said. “So even if they discontinue Yanluowang, their skills and\ntheir tools will be there, and they will probably just join other ransomware groups. This won’t\nbe the end of them.”\n\n_Sean Powers and Will Jarvis contributed reporting to this story._\n\nTags\n\n[China](https://therecord.media/tag/china/)\n[Conti](https://therecord.media/tag/conti/)\n[ransomeware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomeware/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[Trellix](https://therecord.media/tag/trellix/)\n[Yanluowang](https://therecord.media/tag/yanluowang/)\n\n\n-----\n\nDina Temple-Raston is the host and executive producer of the Click Here podcast as well\nas a senior correspondent at The Record.
