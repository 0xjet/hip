Researchers at Cofense say that this\nmethod can bypass some secure email gateways (SEGs), which can have a limit to how\ndeep they check a compressed file.\n\nThe new BazarBackdoor campaign deployed earlier this month and lured enterprise\nrecipients with an “Environmental Day” theme officially celebrated on June 5\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth attached nested ZIP and RAR archives in the attachment contained a JavaScript file\nthat ultimately delivered Trickbot’s BazarBackdoor malware, a stealthy backdoor typically\nused on corporate targets to provide remote access to the threat actor.\n\nCofense analyzed the recent malspam campaign and found that the role of the highly\nobfuscated JavaScript file was to download a payload with an image extension.\n\nCofense [explains that “nesting of various archive types is purposeful by the threat actor as it](https://cofense.com/blog/nested-files-evade-segs/)\nhas the chance of hitting the SEG’s decompression limit or fails because of an unknown\narchive type.”\n\nObfuscated files can also pose problems to an SEG if there are several layers of encryption\nfor the payload increasing the chances of the malicious file passing undetected\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce executed, the obfuscated JavaScript would download a [BazarBackdoor] payload\nwith a .png extension via an HTTP GET connection,” Cofense says, adding that the payload\nis an executable with the wrong extension.\n\nOnce deployed on a victim computer, BazarBackdoor may download and execute the\nCobalt Strike, a legitimate toolkit designed for post-exploitation exercises, to spread laterally\nin the environment.\n\nAfter gaining access to high-value systems on the network, threat actors can launch\nransomware attacks, steal sensitive information, or sell the access to other cybercriminals.\n\nEarlier this year, security researchers discovered a BazarBackdoor variant written in the\nNim programming language, showing the effort Trickbot developer goes to keep the\nmalware undetected and relevant to cybercriminal activities.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Intuit warns of QuickBooks phishing threatening to suspend accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intuit-warns-of-quickbooks-phishing-threatening-to-suspend-accounts/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Phishing websites now use chatbots to steal your credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-websites-now-use-chatbots-to-steal-your-credentials/)\n\n[BazarBackdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bazarbackdoor/)\n[MalSpam](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malspam/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[RAR](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rar/)\n[TrickBot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trickbot/)\n[Zip](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zip/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
