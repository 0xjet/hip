Kaspersky](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=9cd168c7-6a26-4909-8035-0b66d5815f03&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nthen reported that it arrives on the compromised computer through a JAR file by using\nsocial engineering techniques.\n\nThe JAR file contains two executable files for both Mac and Windows. It checks the\ncompromised computer’s OS and drops the suitable executable file. Both these executable\nfiles open a back door on the compromised computer. However, we found two special\nfunctions in the Windows version of the threat that Symantec detects as W32.Crisis.\n\nThe threat uses three methods to spread itself: one is to copy itself and an autorun.inf file\nto a removable disk drive, another is to sneak onto a VMware virtual machine, and the final\nmethod is to drop modules onto a Windows Mobile device.\n\n**_Figure 1. How the threat spreads_**\n\nThe threat searches for a VMware virtual machine image on the compromised computer\nand, if it finds an image, it mounts the image and then copies itself onto the image by using\na VMware Player tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2. Spreads to VMware_**\n\nIt does not use a vulnerability in the VMware software itself. It takes advantage of an\nattribute of all virtualization software: namely that the virtual machine is simply a file or\nseries of files on the disk of the host machine. These files can usually be directly\nmanipulated or mounted, even when the virtual machine is not running as is the case\nabove.\n\nThis may be the first malware that attempts to spread onto a virtual machine. Many threats\nwill terminate themselves when they find a virtual machine monitoring application, such as\nVMware, to avoid being analyzed, so this may be the next leap forward for malware\nauthors.\n\nIt also has the functionality to spread to Windows Mobile devices by dropping modules\nonto Windows Mobile devices connected to compromised Windows computers.\n\n**_Figure 3. Functionality to spread to Windows Mobile devices_**\n\nAs it uses the Remote Application Programming Interface (RAPI), it only affects Windows\nMobile devices and not Android or iPhone devices. We currently do not have copies of\nthese modules and hence we are looking for them so we can analyze them in greater\ndetail.\n\nFinally, Crisis malware has functionality to spread to four different environments: Mac,\nWindows, virtual machines, and Windows Mobile. It is an advanced threat not only in\nfunction, but also in the way it spreads.\n\n[Symantec detects the JAR file as Trojan.Maljava, the threat for Mac as](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-102003-2856-99) [OSX.Crisis, and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-072605-1811-99)\n[the threat for Windows as W32.Crisis. Users of our Norton security products are](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081606-2200-99)\nencouraged to update their virus definitions.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
