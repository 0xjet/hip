However,\nwhile APT reports should have threat actors scrambling to keep\nup, in reality they are providing APT actors with the information\nthey need to implement new operational security practices and\ntechnologies that have defenders working as hard as ever to\nprotect their networks. Not only are attackers adapting; they are\nevolving at a faster rate than defenders. So what are we, as\ndefenders, doing wrong?\n\nThe fact is, many public APT reports suck. Even though they\ntend to be long and technical, they are often not full reports, but\nrather a commentary on the attack platform(s) and deployment\ntechnique(s) used, intended for PR purposes. This results in an\nasymmetry – an information gap – that benefi ts the attacker.\nCurrent APT reports basically act as free Q&A for APT actors,\nproviding them with valuable information about defenders’\ninsights into their tools and actions. As a result, APT actors are\nable to adapt their own OPSEC practices and technologies in\norder to stay one step ahead of defenders. APT reports in their\ncurrent state are more benefi cial to attackers than defenders.\n\nCurrently, most APT reports provide abundant information on\nindicators of compromise (IOC), C&C set-up and malware used.\nThis presentation examines actual techniques that can be used to\nre-engineer the entire attack process, including how attackers\ndecide what information is valuable to target, where that\ninformation can be found, how they create a target report and then\nattack plan, and the ongoing concerns of an attacker during lateral\nmovement (i.e. OPSEC, intelligence gathering, and keeping their\nidentity hidden). Based on these techniques, we discuss specifi c\ndefensive countermeasures that can be used. If APT reports\nincluded more actionable intelligence that defenders could use to\ncreate better defence practices, their value would then be greater\nto defenders than to attackers. We discuss how intelligence on the\nattack vector of an APT, or on what information was\ncompromised, is actually more valuable to a defender than the\ninformation that currently dominates APT reports (malware\nanalysis, IOCs). APT reports with more actionable intelligence\nwould afford us the ability to publicly re-engineer specifi c\nattacks, consequently rendering useless certain attack techniques\nthat are currently not available for public knowledge.\n\n\nThe cybersecurity sector needs to demand earlier reporting of\nbreaches (or at least a heads up to the security community),\nactionable public information sharing, and a move away from\nour current fi xation on attribution. We need to make hackers\nspend signifi cantly more time, effort, and resources in order to\nsucceed. By producing better APT reports, not only can the\nsecurity community increase attackers’ costs and cause them to\nconstantly be on guard, but also signifi cantly disrupt the\nattackers’ operations and make it diffi cult for them to rebuild\ntheir attack infrastructure after being compromised and exposed.\n\nThe bottom line is: in order to counter the evolution of APTs, we\nneed APT reports that provide a more wholesome view of an\nattacker’s motivations and chosen vector in addition to an\nanalysis of his techniques. This shift in focus can give security\nprofessionals more tools to successfully re-engineer an attacker’s\nmethodology.\n\n_There is an information gap in that APT reports are more_\n_helpful to the attacker than to the defender – there needs to be_\n_a shift._\n\nCybersecurity is a constantly evolving fi eld, with protection\ntechnologies shifting to keep up with the transformation of cyber\nthreats that are growing in complexity. Operational security,\notherwise known as OPSEC, is a collection of processes both for\ndeveloping software with risk management in mind, as well as\ncarrying out a mission using said software. In the case of a\nnetwork breach, OPSEC also includes the measures used by the\nattacker to avoid detection, and ensure success. Contrary to what\nsome might believe, operational security is useful for both the\nattacker and the defender. When considering operational security\nfrom the perspective of an attacker, OPSEC can be utilized in\norder to achieve the attacker’s goals while preventing detection.\nThere are instances, however, when OPSEC is a hindrance. In\nterms of the time needed to achieve success, it often necessitates\nslow movement on the attacker’s part in order not to be\ncompromised. OPSEC’s scalability can also be problematic, as\ncan the ease of deployment.\n\nOver the past 10 years, a specifi c type of threat known as an\n‘advanced persistent threat’, or APT, has become increasingly\ncommon. As a result, defence technology has been transforming\nin order to meet these kinds of threats. Some of the most notable\nbreaches and hacks in the past few years have been a result of\nAPT campaigns, such as Stuxnet and Flame. These two\ncampaigns actually varied in size and specifi cation. Stuxnet was\na computer worm, believed to be a joint American-Israeli project,\nthat compromised Iranian centrifuges. In this instance, the worm\nwas smaller in size but designed to target specifi c vendors.\nFlame, on the other hand, was much larger – 20 megabytes in\ncomparison to Stuxnet’s 500 kilobytes – but much less targetspecifi c. Its main purpose was to infect a system and look for\nintelligence, by taking screenshots and recording audio and then\nsending that information back through an encrypted channel.\n\nWhen APTs are identifi ed and blocked, it is often the result of a\nhacker being compromised by faulty operational security. On\nthe attacker’s side, this requires a transformation in product. For\ninstance, after Stuxnet and Flame were identifi ed, new advanced\npersistent threats became stealthier and more complex. One\n\n\n-----\n\nexample is Gauss, which had tight execution constraints which\nonly allowed the malware to execute on certain targets,\nresulting in it evading capture for signifi cantly longer. Even\nnow, there is still a piece of the malware, detailing which\ncomputer it was meant for, that remains encrypted. Another\nAPT that emerged as the actors learned from their mistakes was\nAPT3, a piece of malware that, when fi rst active, used only\nsmall and disposable tools before bringing out the more\ncomplex and intense tools, in order to prevent their loss in the\nevent of it being caught earlier on.\n\nOn the defender’s side, the fi rst signifi cant sign of hope in\ndefeating APTs came in early 2013 when the fi rst major APT\nreport was released by Mandiant [1]. Its disclosure of the\nadvanced persistent threat campaign named ‘APT1’ made a\nhuge impact thanks to the extent of the exposure. The report\nshowed that the campaign had compromised 141 companies\nacross 20 countries. The attack methodology was to establish\naccess to a network and visit the network every so often to steal\nnew data. With a sizable staff, APT1 was able to steal incredible\namounts of data, remaining in one particular system for as long\nas four years and 10 months, and stealing a whopping 6.5\nTerabytes of data from just one organization over the course of\n10 months. Mandiant’s report outed APT1 publicly for the fi rst\ntime and, since then, APT reports have become a common\noutcome after an attack, produced with the intent of aiding other\ndefenders by detailing the attack methods and preventative\nmeasures. Unfortunately, many of these APT reports are failing\nto achieve just that. The major problem with these reports is not\nill intent, but a gap in information which causes the details to\nfavour the attacker rather than the defender.\n\nThis disparity occurs for a number of reasons, but all with the\nsame consequence. Most APT reports are lengthy, causing\nreaders to have to sift through a great amount of detail in order\nto get to the most important piece information. Sometimes, that\ninformation is contained within the report, but sometimes it is\nnot and the report is not disclosed in full. In these cases, the part\nof the report that is publicized is done so for PR purposes and\nthe full report is available only to paying customers. This is a\nclear cut case of when the attacker is disproportionately\nbenefi ted because the part of the report that is available often\nonly contains deployment techniques. Deployment techniques,\nfor other attackers reading the report, represent nothing more\nthan an inside look at ‘what the other guy can do’, with less\nrelevance to any other defenders.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the information commonly contained in\nAPT reports produced the observation shown in Figure 1.\n\nMost of the information is malware analysis, which makes for\ninteresting reading for fellow malware researchers but has very\nlittle value to an IT security person trying to defend a network.\nAfter that come indicators of compromise, which actually are\nuseful for detecting and mitigating threats but have a very short\nrelevance term, since the rise of OPSEC. Coming next, the C&C\nset-up has more relevance as its life span is usually longer\n(though less and less relevant to other targets or other\ncampaigns). Attack vectors are very important because they are\nharder to change, are relevant to a larger group of targets, and\nare actionable – you have something to defend against – but\nthese are not often included in the reports. And the most\n\n\nMalware IOCs C&C Attack Attacker\nAnalysis Set-up Vectors Objective\n\n\n_Figure 1: The relative amounts of different types of information_\n_commonly contained in APT reports (y axis: information)._\n\nimportant piece of information – attacker objectives, the one\nthing that lets a defender focus and concentrate the defences in\nthe right place – is rarely shared.\n\nMoreover, preventative strategies are released, which become in\nessence a free lesson for the actor responsible for the advanced\npersistent threat, showcasing what should be done differently\nnext time, with a detailed explanation of the defence software,\nessentially allowing the attack mechanisms to evolve and\ninfi ltrate the system more successfully.\n\nFor other attackers, these reports represent a free QA process,\nleaking both other attacking technologies as well as how they\nare defended against, resulting in APT evolution. There are\nseveral instances of seemingly unrelated campaigns having been\ncarried out using similar code, demonstrating that there was\nsome spread of information on the actors’ end. In the case of\nAPT1, different parts of the malware were registered under the\nsame name and email. This lesson was clearly absorbed by the\nRussian programmers who created Turla, an APT which was far\nmore sophisticated and used satellite connections to hijack\nnetworks and steal data, without any locations disclosed.\n\nIn order to fi x this information asymmetry, one of the best\nsolutions is to use ‘reverse engineering’; this essentially means\nlooking at an attack from the attacker’s perspective in order to\ndetermine what can be done on the defender’s part. This is\nwhere the Cyber Engagement Process comes into play. This is a\nsimplifi ed model that details the generalized main steps of an\nattacker: composing intelligence requirements; creating a target\nlist; engagement, whether it be pre-breach, post-breach, or\nongoing; and fi nally folding and retreat.\n\nThe fi rst step, composing intelligence requirements, requires a\ndeep look at the attacker’s end as to what kind of information he\nis looking for. This step is quite problematic for defenders. In\nthe event the defender manages to determine the objective of the\nattacker, some precautions can be used. For instance, in the case\nof Operation Aurora, security experts were able to determine\nthat the goal of the attackers was to gain access to particular\nsource code repositories at certain high tech and security\ncompanies. However, in most cases, there is no indication of the\nattackers’ objective or what information is being sought, making\n\n\n-----\n\ndefensive strategies much more diffi cult to select. Even when\nthe objective is known, it can be diffi cult to understand the\nmindset of the attackers or why they would want certain\ninformation – as in the case of the Offi ce of Personnel\nManagement breach, when hackers targeted personal\ninformation such as Social Security numbers. For this step, with\nlittle knowledge of the attacker’s intentions, one should perform\nrisk assessments, to ascertain the potential impacts.\n\nThe next step in the Engagement Process is for the attacker to\ncompile a target list. This is directly related to the intelligence\nrequirements, as it is nothing more than a list to determine who\nhas the relevant information as per the intelligence\nrequirements: ‘Who has the answers to my questions?’ This can\ntake shape in specifi c targets, or it can be more broad. From the\ndefender’s perspective, this again is diffi cult to act against, for\nnumerous reasons. Pattern recognition – one of the solutions –\nrequires more time than is often available. One measure that can\nbe taken is to constantly be aware of other attacks that are\nhappening, particularly in companies that are similar to one’s\nown. In fact, there are many instances in which one company is\nhacked and then, a few days later, a number of other similar\nnatured companies are breached. In the case of the Target\nbreach, point-of-sale devices were hacked; any other companies\nwith similar point-of-sale devices should have been on the\nlookout, making active changes to make sure they would not be\nhacked in the same fashion. To prevent this, threat assessments\nshould be carried out often and breaches reported as soon as\npossible so that other defenders can take notice and be\nforewarned. However, not all actors will include this step as part\nof their engagement plan, as this is just a generalized cycle. One\nexample is the Sofacy APT, which did not have a compiled\ntarget list, but seemed to latch onto whatever information it\ncould fi nd in order to monetize it later.\n\nThe third step of the cycle, intelligence gathering, involves\nmany substeps. Beforehand, there is generally a pre-prepared\ntarget report outlining everything that is known about the target\nto be used during engagement. This helps in the creation of the\nattack plan, which might be tailored for the target, with\ntarget-specifi c tools and target-specifi c methods. In terms of\nattack prevention, publicly available sensitive data poses a huge\nproblem. Even if the information is not public, some people\nmay inadvertently make the information easily accessible, for\nexample by using security questions with answers that can be\nfound on social media accounts. When there is such a lack of\nsecurity awareness, companies can become susceptible to\nprobing, either automatic or manual. This is merely the\npre-engagement stage of intelligence gathering. Before even\ninfi ltrating an actual network, the attacker can have a large\namount of information at hand. While this seems disheartening,\nonce an actor is ‘engaged’ and inside the network, there are\nactually many opportunities to intervene. The engagement\nprocess is not a one-time event; it is ongoing, which is why\nlayered security is so important. The key in this step is to put as\nmany obstacles as possible in the way of the attacker, so that it\ntakes longer to reach the desired data, resulting in longer\nperiods of exposure and a greater chance of getting caught.\n\nFor the attacker, once inside the network, the main goal is to\nremain undetected and move around stealthily, making its way\n\n\nto the desired data. This is commonly known as ‘lateral\nmovement’. In order to remain undetected within the network,\nmore intelligence gathering needs to take place. This is from a\ndifferent perspective, having already infi ltrated the network, but\nthis is where operational security needs to be revisited by the\nattacker. This begins with mapping out the defences of the target\nand continues with looking for other malware. It is also\nimportant to recognize that, in this day and age, there are many\nother players and many other APT actors and so there might be\nothers lurking in the same network that need to be recognized.\n\nWith this awareness comes the possibility of having to abort\nwhile inside the network. Even if an installation is in the midst\nof occurring, if there are signs of detection, the safest thing to\ndo is leave the network immediately. This can be seen in the\ncase of the threat known as ‘Hurricane Panda’ where the threat\nactor detected the presence of CrowdStrike and backed away.\n\nThis example is closely related to the last step, folding and\nretreating, which varies from one attacker to another. Some fold\nafter report publications: Red October was a malware program\noperating for fi ve years before its discovery, upon which it\ndismantled. Another program that quit and ran in a similar\nfashion was The Mask, which left the system only four hours\nafter a blog publication. Nevertheless, there are\ncounter-examples that demonstrate that some malware actors do\nnot bother to fold and retreat, such as APT12 or the Gaza\nHacker team. For the defender, one of the worst consequences\nof an attack could be when an attacker chooses to destroy all the\ninformation he gets his hands on as a form of folding and then\nretreating. For this reason, sometimes it can be of more use to\nhave back-ups of data rather than regular monitoring of the\nsystem.\n\nWith this Engagement Process in mind, it is apparent that more\ninformation needs to be communicated in APT reports – and not\njust more information, but the right kind of information. One\nshift that needs to occur is a reduction in focus on attribution.\nWhile previously, attackers used to try to steer clear of any\npossibility of attribution, that no longer seems to be the case.\nInstead, attackers seem to have little shame and are not afraid of\nattribution. In order to aid not just the actor and other similar\nattackers, reports should be focusing on attack vectors and an\nanalysis of attack techniques. This kind of actionable information\nis the only way other defending companies can benefi t from\nthese reports. However, just as important as the actual report\ndetails is the timing of the reports; the public needs to know\nabout breaches immediately after they happen in order for\ndefenders to counter future attacks. With more prompt,\nactionable reports, the asymmetry of information sharing will\ncease and the disproportionate advantages for the attackers will\nbe negated.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] Mandiant.
