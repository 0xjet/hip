The password is: infect3d\n\n...please though, don't infect yourself!\n\n## Background\n\nEarlier today, several vendors uncovered a massive supply chain attack, spreading malware\ndubbed SmoothOperator:\n\n[Earlier today @CrowdStrike reported a supply chain attack targeting the 3CX Voice](https://twitter.com/CrowdStrike?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nOver Internet Protocol (VOIP) Windows desktop client.\n\n   - 600,000 companies use it\n\n   - 12,000,000 users\n\n   - [@Sophos has identified a MacOS variant infected](https://twitter.com/Sophos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n   - Currently attributed to Lazarus Group\n\n[— vx-underground (@vxunderground) March 30, 2023](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1641249699746267138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFor details on the supply chain attack, affecting 3CX, you can read the following:\n\n“CrowdStrike Falcon Platform Detects and Prevents Active Intrusion Campaign\nTargeting 3CXDesktopApp Customers”\n\n“SmoothOperator | Ongoing Campaign Trojanizes 3CXDesktopApp in Supply Chain\nAttack”\n\n[“3CX users under DLL-sideloading attack: What you need to know”](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/03/29/3cx-dll-sideloading-attack/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile these analyses were a great start, they all were missing one very important piece!\nDetails on the macoS infection and the specific malicious component(s).\n\nSpecifically, though the reports noted 3CX’s macOS application may have been trojanized\nthis was not conclusively confirmed, with one vendor noting, “at this time, we cannot confirm\nthat the Mac installer is similarly trojanized”.\n\n…sounds like its up to us to get to the bottom on this!\n\n## Triage\n\nThe [CrowdStrike report noted that they had seen malicious macOS activity emanating from](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-detects-and-prevents-active-intrusion-campaign-targeting-3cxdesktopapp-customers/)\n3CX’s macOS application …and were kind enough to provide a name and hash of a disk\nimage they believed was infected. This was the key to starting our investigation, so a big\nthanks to them!\n\nWe’ll start with this disk image, 3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416.dmg (SHA-1:\n```\n3DC840D32CE86CEBF657B17CEF62814646BA8E98):\n\n```\nTrojanized Disk Image?\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see, it contains a single application, named 3CX Desktop App .\n\nIf we check its code-signing information, we can see not only is it validly signed by the 3CX\ndeveloper, but also notarized by Apple! The latter means Apple checked it for malware “and\nnone was detected” …yikes!\n\nTrojanized Application\n\nNotarization means the application will be allowed to run on recent versions of macOS, with\nthe OS not blocking it.\nUpdate: Apple has now revoked the code-signing certifiate, meaning the item’s notarization\nis rescinded.\n\n…at this point, if I’m being honest, the thought crossed my mind that maybe the reason none\nof the vendors (with their millions of dollars and large malware analysis teams) hadn’t\ndetailed the macOS trojanization mechanism was because there wasn’t one? I mean, Apple\nhad notarized the application, which in a way is giving it their sample of approval.\n\nI brushed this thought aside and kept digging …which as the application was almost 400mb,\nwas no trivial task.\n```\n% du -h /Volumes/3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416/3CX\\ Desktop\\ App.app\n\n...\n\n381M  /Volumes/3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416/3CX Desktop App.app\n\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nI (eventually) came across a binary named libffmpeg.dylib\nburied deep within the App s\n```\nContents/Frameworks/Electron\\ Framework.framework/Versions/A/Libraries directory.\n\n```\nIts SHA-1 hash is 769383fc65d1386dd141c960c9970114547da0c2, and it was uploaded to\nVirusTotal early today where it was not flagged by any of the AV engines as being malicious:\n\nA malicious dynamic library?\nUsing the file command, we see it’s a Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: x86_64\n& arm64:\n```\n% file 3CX\\ Desktop\\ App.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron\\\nFramework.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libffmpeg.dylib\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit\ndynamically linked shared library x86_64] [arm64]\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib:  Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib:  Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64\n\n\n\n```\nA quick triage of this binary revealed XOR loops, timing checks, dynamically resolved APIs,\nand string obfuscations …all shady! 👀\n\nTime to dig deeper!\n\n## Analysis of libffmpeg.dylib\n\nIn this section we’ll analyze the malicious logic of the libffmpeg.dylib binary. We’ll focus on\nthe Intel (x86_64) versions as the Arm version doesn’t appear to be infected!\n\nWorth noting that the Intel version can still run on Apple Silicon sytems, if Rosetta is installed.\n\nAt the start of the Intel version, a thread is spawned via a function called run_avcodec\nThis\nkicks off a (thread) function at 0x48430:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nEntryPoint:\n\n0x000000000004b180    xor    eax, eax         \n\n0x000000000004b182    jmp    _run_avcodec\n\n...\n\n_run_avcodec:\n\n0x0000000000048400     push    rax\n\n0x0000000000048401     movabs   rax, 0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\n0x000000000004840b     mov    rdi, rsp\n\n0x000000000004840e     mov    qword [rdi], rax\n\n0x0000000000048411     lea    rdx, qword [sub_48430]\n\n0x0000000000048418     xor    esi, esi                \n\n0x000000000004841a     xor    ecx, ecx\n\n0x000000000004841c     call    imp___stubs__pthread_create\n\n...\n\n```\nThe function at 0x48430 (named sub_48430 in the disassembly) is where things get\ninteresting!\n\nA quick triage of this function shows that its rather massive but more importantly contains\nvarious anti-analysis approaches aimed at thwarting static analysis. For example here is a\nsnippet of decompilation showing a string begin de-XOR’d:\n```\ndo {\n\n  *(int8_t *)(rsp + rax + 0x1b40) = *(int8_t *)(rsp + rax + 0x1b40) ^ 0x7a;\n\n  rax = rax + 0x1;\n\n} while (rax != 0x32);\n\n```\nClearly, it is not trivial to understand this solely via static analysis, so let’s leverage dynamic\nanalysis (read: use a debugger).\n\nDebugging a dynamic library is a bit tricky, as it can’t be executed in a standalone manner.\nNot to worry, we can whip up a simple loader that will load it (or any passed in dylib) via the\n```\ndlopen API:\n#import <dlfcn.h>\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n\n  void * handle = dlopen(argv[1], RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_LAZY);\n\n  dispatch_main();\n\n  return 0;\n\n}\n\n```\nOnce this is compiled (as an x86_64 program, as we want to debug the x86_64 version of\n```\nlibffmpeg.dylib), we launch it via the lldb debugger:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n% lldb dlopen_x64 libffmpeg.dylib\n\n\n```\nWe can then run the loader (dlopen_x64) via a debugger passing in the malicious dylib\n```\nlibffmpeg.dylib.\n\n```\nSetting a breakpoint on pthread_create allows the debugger to break right before the thread\nfunction of interest to us, is executed. This is important as we don’t know exactly where the\nlibrary will be loaded in memory (and thus can’t initially set a breakpoint on the address of\nthe thread function).\n```\n% lldb dlopen_x64 libffmpeg.dylib\n\n...\n\n(lldb) b pthread_create\n\n(lldb) run\n\nProcess 21118 stopped\n\n* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1\n\n  frame #0: 0x00007ff81c81c445 libsystem_pthread.dylib`pthread_create\n\nlibsystem_pthread.dylib`pthread_create:\n\n-> 0x7ff81c81c445 <+0>: xorl  %r8d, %r8d\n\n\n```\nOnce broken we can use the image list debugger command to find the address that the\n```\nlibffmpeg.dylib library is loaded, and from this, the address of the thread function. Then,\n\n```\nwe can set a breakpoint such the debugger will break once its about to be executed.\n\nHooray, now we’re in the debugger at the start of the thread function …let’s start stepping\nthrough it. We won’t go through all its details, but instead highlight, well, highlights!\n\nFirst, it de-XORs components to build the following path: ~/Library/Application\n```\nSupport/3CX Desktop App/.session-lock. It then attempts to open this file via the open\n\n```\nAPI. (In the debugger the RDI register will hold the first argument (the file name) passed to\n```\nopen):\nTarget 0: (dlopen_x64) stopped.\n\n(lldb) x/s 0x3041946f0\n\n0x3041946f0: \"%s/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/%s\"\n\n...\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib`___lldb_unnamed_symbol1736:\n\n-> 0x10a0484f5 <+341>: callq 0x10a208858        ; symbol stub for: open\n\nTarget 0: (dlopen_x64) stopped.\n\n(lldb) x/s $rdi\n\n0x304193ee0: \"/Users/patrick/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.sessionlock\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIf this file does not exist the function will exit (so we ll create a blank file here, so we can keep\ndebugging).\n\nThe function then executes logic to query the host to get the OS version, computer name,\netc, etc. On my machine (macOS 13.3), once it has gathered this information and\nconcatenated it together it looks something like this: \"13.3;Patricks-MacBook```\nPro.local;6180;14\".\n\n```\nIt then generates a unique identifier (UUID) and write this out to a file named .main_storage\nalso in the ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/ directory:\n```\n% hexdump -C ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.main_storage\n\n00000000 49 4d 48 4f 1f 42 4b 1f 57 4a 4f 4b 43 57 4d 1c |IMHO.BK.WJOKCWM.|\n\n00000010 4a 43 57 4d 48 1b 19 57 49 4f 4c 4e 4b 19 43 4e |JCWMH..WIOLNK.CN|\n\n00000020 19 4b 19 1c 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a 7a |.K..zzzzzzzzzzzz|\n\n00000030 5e b8 46 1e 7a 7a 7a 7a              |^.F.zzzz|\n\n\n```\nThis file is “encrypted” with the XOR key 0x7a.\n\nAfter various anti-debugging logic (e.g. timing checks) it builds a URL to query. We can easily\ndump this in the debugger to reveal that it is https://pbxsources.com/queue:\n```\n...\n\nProcess 18702 stopped\n\n(lldb) po $rax\n\nhttps://pbxsources.com/queue\n\n\n\n```\nThe domain pbxsources.com is listed by various vendors as an IoC to detect the Windows\nvariant of this malware.\nIt’s not surprising the macOS variant used the same network infrastructure.\n\nAfter setting a static user-agent (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)\n```\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.5359.128 Safari/537.36) and\n\n```\nadding various host info as HTTP headers, it connects out to the decrypted URL.\n\nUnfortunately the URL the malware is trying to reach (pbxsources.com) is now offline:\n```\n% nslookup pbxsources.com\n\nServer:   1.1.1.1\n\nAddress:  1.1.1.1#53\n\n** server can't find pbxsources.com: NXDOMAIN\n\n\n\n```\n…so the malware doesn’t get the HTTP 200 OK it wants, and thus goes off to snooze.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrax strcmp(var_23F8, 200 );\n\n...\n\n//no match?\n\ndo {\n\n    time(rbp);\n\n    if (0x0 >= r14) {\n\n      break;\n\n    }\n\n    sleep(0xa);\n\n} while (true);\n\n```\nAs the C&C server is offline, our dynamic analysis comes to an end. But that’s ok! Continued\nstatic analysis appears to show the malware expects to download a 2nd-stage payload. This\nappears to be saved as a file named UpdateAgent (in the Application Support/3CX Desktop\nApp/ directory)\n\nIn the annotated decompilation, you can see that once the file is written out, the malware\nsets it to be executable (via chmod), then executes it via the popen API:\n```\n//write out 2nd-stage payload\n\n// path (likely): \"UpdateAgent\"\n\nrax = fopen$DARWIN_EXTSN(r13, \"wb\");\n\nfwrite(var_23F8 + 0x4, 0xfffffffffffffffc, 0x1, rax);\n\nfflush(rax);\n\nfclose(rax);\n\n//make +x\n\nchmod(r13, 0x1ed);\n\n//add \"\"> /dev/null\"\n\nsprintf(r12, rbp);\n\npopen$DARWIN_EXTSN(r12, \"r\");\n\n```\nI don’t have access to this binary, what it does is a mystery.\n\n## Detection\n\nLet’s end by talking how to detect the macOS variant of the SmoothOperator malware.\n\nFirst some IoCs (with the caveat that I don’t know what “3CX Desktop App.app” normally\ndoes, but as we saw, the malicious library, libffmpeg.dylib, interacts w/ the following files)\n\nFile based IoCs (found in ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/)\n```\n   UpdateAgent\n   .main_storage\n   .session-lock\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIn terms of domains the malware will attempt to connect to, we can, as noted by Snorre\nFagerland on Twitter, simply de-XOR the entire libffmpeg.dylib binary with the key 0x7a to\nrecover a comprehensive list\n\nThanks for this! Concur on the xor - if people want a whole heap of indicators, just xor\n[the entire file with 0x7a and see what falls out. pic.twitter.com/XNMfDyYr1I](https://t.co/XNMfDyYr1I)\n\n[— Snorre Fagerland (@fstenv) March 30, 2023](https://twitter.com/fstenv/status/1641339337152385025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nEmbedded Domains:\n```\n   officestoragebox.com/api/biosync\n   visualstudiofactory.com/groupcore\n   azuredeploystore.com/cloud/images\n   msstorageboxes.com/xbox\n   officeaddons.com/quality\n   sourceslabs.com/status\n   zacharryblogs.com/xmlquery\n   pbxcloudeservices.com/network\n   pbxphonenetwork.com/phone\n   akamaitechcloudservices.com/v2/fileapi\n   azureonlinestorage.com/google/storage\n   msedgepackageinfo.com/ms-webview\n   glcloudservice.com/v1/status\n   pbxsources.com/queue\n   www.3cx.com/blog/event-trainings/\n\n```\nThis list of URLs appear to be same as Window variant.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nToday we added a missing puzzle piece to the 3CX supply chain attack. Here, for the first\ntime we uncovered the trojanization component of the macOS component! Moreover, we\nthoroughly analyzed this component, while providing IoCs for detection.\n\nNow I’m off to hunt for that 2nd-stage payload (and to sleep) Y’all stay safe!\n\n\nUpdate, I was able to get my hands on a 2nd-stage payload, and have now published a new\nblog on it.\n\n[Ironing out (the macOS) details of a Smooth Operator (Part II)](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x74.html)\n\n**Interested in Mac Malware Analysis Techniques?**\n\n\n-----\n\nYou're in luck, as I've written a book on this topic!
