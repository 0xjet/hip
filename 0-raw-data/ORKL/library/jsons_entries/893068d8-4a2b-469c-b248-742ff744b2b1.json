We partner with stakeholders across public and private\nsectors to raise awareness and find solutions to best tackle this important issue.\n\nStalkerware enables people to secretly spy on other people’s private lives via smart\ndevices and is often used to facilitate psychological and physical violence against intimate\npartners. The software is commercially available and can access an array of personal data,\nincluding device location, browser history, text messages, social media chats, photos and\nmore. The marketing of stalkerware is not illegal, but its use without the victim’s consent\nis. Perpetrators benefit from this vague legal framework that still exists in many countries.\nStalkerware is a breach of privacy and a form of tech abuse. To address this complex threat\nin a comprehensive way that best supports victims and survivors, innovative tools from a\nlegislative, social and technological point of view are needed.\n\n#### 2021 data highlights\n\n- **In 2021, Kaspersky’s data shows that 32,694 unique users were affected by**\n**stalkerware globally. This is a decrease from our 2020 numbers and a historic low**\nsince we first started gathering data on stalkerware in 2018. While this could be seen\nas a reason for celebration, it is not.\n\n- **Cyber-violence is on the rise, especially since the beginning of the pandemic. As**\npeople have continued to socialize less and spend more time at home, perpetrators feel\nmore in control, possibly making them less prone to installing stalkerware to spy on their\npartner. In addition, abusers, unfortunately, have a wider range of means, in the form of\nsmart devices, to spy on or stalk their victims. Non-profit organizations (NPOs) with which\nKaspersky works closely have shared similar observations from working with perpetrators\nand victims of stakerware. It is important to remember that these numbers only include\nKaspersky users: they do not take into account users who use the IT security solutions\nof our competitors or those who do not have any IT security solutions installed on their\nmobiles. Therefore, we see only the tip of the iceberg: while it is difficult to calculate\n[the exact number of affected users in the world, members from the Coalition against](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\n[Stalkerware estimate that it could be at least 30 times higher, with close to one million](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\nvictims globally, each year.\n\n\n##### 2 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n##### In 2021, a total of 32,694 single users were affected by stalkerware\n\n\nBased on data obtained from the Kaspersky Security Network, the most affected\n**countries remain Russia, Brazil and the United States. This is in line with statistics**\nfrom the past two years. At the regional level, we find the highest numbers of affected\nusers in:\n\n    - Germany, Italy and the UK (Europe)\n\n    - Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia (Middle East and Africa)\n\n    - India, Indonesia and Vietnam (Asia-Pacific)\n\n    - Brazil, Mexico and Columbia (Latin America)\n\n    - The United States (North America)\n\n    - The Russian Federation, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (Eastern Europe (excluding EU\ncountries), Russia and Central Asia)\n\n- **Cerberus and Reptilicus were the most used stalkerware applications, with**\n5,575 and 4,417 affected users, respectively, globally.\n\n## Trends observed by Kaspersky\n\n#### Global detection figures: affected users\n\nIn this section, we highlight the global and regional numbers observed by Kaspersky in\n2021 and how they compare with those from previous years.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 32,694 single users were affected by stalkerware. The graphic below\nshows the evolution of affected users year on year since 2018.\n\n80000\n\n\n70000\n\n60000\n\n50000\n\n40000\n\n30000\n\n20000\n\n10000\n\n\n53870\n\n2020\n\n\n40173\n\n\n66927\n\n2019\n\n\n0\n2018\n\n\n32694\n\n2021\n\n\nEvolution of affected users year on year since 2018\n\nThe graphic below shows unique affected users per month over the 2019-2021 period. We\ncan see that in 2021 the trend was more stable than in 2020, which saw a visible decrease\nduring the months most impacted by lockdowns and quarantine measures.\n\n12000 10620 10699 10861 11098\n\n11000\n\n9986\n9569 9458\n\n10000\n\n8358\n\n9000 7722\n\n8000 7072\n\n6787 6745\n\n7000 7075\n\n6000 5113 5092 4741\n\n40005000 4460 3985 4625 3794 4162 3634 3589 3371 35434605 3814 4218 4408\n\n3000 3578 3758\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n2019 2020 2021\n\nUnique affected users per month over the 2019-2021 period\n\n##### 3 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Global and regional detection figures: geography of affected users\n\nStalkerware continues to affect people across the world: in 2021, Kaspersky detected affected users in 185 countries or territories.\n\n### Cases\n\n 0 50 100 500 1000 5000 10000\n\n\n##### Methodology\n\nThe data in this report has been taken\nfrom aggregated threat statistics\nobtained from the Kaspersky Security\nNetwork. The Kaspersky Security Network\nis dedicated to processing cybersecurityrelated data streams from millions of\nvolunteer participants around the world.\nAll received data is anonymized. To\ncalculate our statistics, we review the\nconsumer line of Kaspersky’s mobile\nsecurity solutions applying only the\nCoalition Against Stalkerware’s detection\ncriteria on stalkerware. This means that\nthe affected number of users were\ntargeted by stalkerware only. Other types\nof monitoring or spyware apps that fall\noutside of the Coalition’s definition are not\nincluded in our statistics.\n\nThe statistics reflect unique mobile users\naffected by stalkerware: this is different\nfrom the number of detections. The\nnumber of detections can be higher as we\nmay detect stalkerware several times on\nthe same device of the same unique user\nif they decided not to remove the app\nafter receiving our notification.\n\nFinally, the statistics reflect only mobile\nusers using Kaspersky’s IT security\nsolutions. Some users may use another\ncybersecurity solution on their devices,\nwhile some do not use any solution at all.\n\n\nAs in 2020, Russia, Brazil, the United States and India are, again, the top four countries\nwith the most identified single affected users. Interestingly, Mexico has fallen from fifth\nto ninth place and Algeria, Turkey and Egypt have entered the top 10. They have replaced\nItaly, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, which are no longer in the top 10 countries\nmost affected by stalkerware.\n\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n\n**1** Russian Federation 7541\n\n**2** Brazil 4807\n\n**3** United States of America 2319\n\n**4** India 2105\n\n**5** Germany 1012\n\n**6** Iran (Islamic Republic of) 891\n\n**7** Algeria 665\n\n**8** Turkey 660\n\n**9** Mexico 657\n\n**10** Egypt 640\n\nTable 1 – 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware - globally\n\nIn this year’s report, we provide more detailed regional statistics with numbers for Europe,\nAsia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Eastern Europe (excluding EU countries),\nRussia and Central Asia and the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\n##### 4 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Europe, the total number of single affected users was 4,236 in 2021. Germany, Italy\nand the United Kingdom rank at the top of the list, repeating their top rankings last year.\nAustria has been replaced in the top 10 by Czechia.\n\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n\n**1** Germany 1012\n\n**2** Italy 611\n\n**3** United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 430\n\n**4** France 410\n\n**5** Poland 321\n\n**6** Spain 321\n\n**7** Netherlands 165\n\n**8** Romania 125\n\n**9** Belgium 94\n\n**10** Czechia 82\n\nTable 2 - 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware - Europe\n\nIn Eastern Europe (excluding EU countries), Russia and Central Asia, the total number\nof single affected users was 9,207.

India was substantially ahead\nof other countries with 2,105 single users affected. It was followed by Indonesia and\nVietnam.\n\n##### 5 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n\n**1** India 2105\n\n**2** Indonesia 353\n\n**3** Vietnam 258\n\n**4** Philippines 240\n\n**5** Malaysia 229\n\n**6** Australia 205\n\n**7** Bangladesh 169\n\n**8** Japan 167\n\n**9** Pakistan 98\n\n**10** Sri Lanka 83\n\nTable 5 - 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware - Asia Pacific\n\nThe Latin America and Caribbean region ranking was dominated by one country: Brazil,\nwhich represented 72.5% of the total number of affected users in the region (and\naccounts for roughly 32% of the region’s population). Brazil was followed by Mexico and\nColombia.

The total number of affected users in North America, excluding Mexico which\nhas been included with the Latin America data, is 2,666.\n\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n\n**1** United States of America 2319\n\n**2** Canada 347\n\nTable 7 - 2021’s affected users by stalkerware – North America\n\n##### 6 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Common functionalities of stalkerware applications\n\nThis section lists the stalkerware applications that are the most used to control mobile\ndevices on a global level. Cerberus and Reptilicus were the most used stalkerware\napplications with 5,575 and 4,417 affected users, respectively, globally.\n\n\n**Application name** **Affected users**\n\n\n##### Are Android OS and iOS equally affected by stalkerware?\n\nStalkerware tools are less frequent on\niPhones than Android devices because\niOS is traditionally a closed system.\nHowever, perpetrators can work around\nthis limitation on jailbroken iPhones, but\nthey still require direct physical access to\nthe phone to jailbreak it. iPhone users who\nfear surveillance should always keep an\neye on their device.\n\nAlternatively, an abuser can offer their\nvictim an iPhone – or any other device –\nwith pre-installed stalkerware. There are\nmany companies that make these services\navailable online, allowing abusers to have\nthese tools installed on new phones, which\ncan then be delivered in factory packaging\nunder the guise of a gift to the intended\nvictim.\n\n\n**1** Cerberus 5,575\n\n**2** Reptilicus (aka Vkurse) 4,417\n\n**3** Track My Phones 1,919\n\n**4** AndroidLost 1,731\n\n**5** MobileTracker Free 1670\n\n**6** Hoverwatch 1,094\n\n**7** wSpy 1,050\n\nTable 8 - 2021’s top list of stalkerware applications\n\nStalkerware applications can give tremendous power and access to its users, depending\non the applications and whether they are used in free or paying mode. Some of them are\nmarketed as anti-theft or parental control applications, however, they are different in\nmany ways, beginning with the fact that they work in stealth mode without the consent\nand knowledge of the victim.\n\nMost of the popular applications provide common stalkerware functionality such as:\n\n- Hiding app icon\n\n- Reading SMS, MMS and call logs\n\n- Getting lists of contacts\n\n\n##### 7 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The number of affected users and some of the behaviors and perceptions around the use of stalkerware are still concerning\n\n\n\n- Tracking GPS location\n\n- Tracking calendar events\n\n- Reading messages from popular messenger services and social networks, such as\nFacebook, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Viber, Instagram, Skype, Hangouts, Line, Kik,\nWeChat, Tinder, IMO, Gmail, Tango, SnapChat, Hike, TikTok, Kwai, Badoo, BBM, TextMe,\nTumblr, Weico, Reddit etc.\n\n- Viewing photos and pictures from phones’ image galleries\n\n- Taking screenshots\n\n- Taking front (selfie-mode) camera photos\n\n## The use of stalkerware may be decreasing, but violence is not\n\nWhile we observe a decrease of 39% of affected users from our 2020 data, the fight against\nstalkerware and against cyber violence is far from over. The number of affected users and\nsome of the behaviors and perceptions around the use of stalkerware are still concerning. In\n[November 2021, Kaspersky commissioned a global survey of more than 21,000 participants](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2021/11/17164103/Kaspersky_Digital-stalking-in-relationships_Report_FINAL.pdf)\nin 21 countries on their attitudes towards privacy and digital stalking in intimate relationships.\nWhile the majority of respondents (70%) do not believe it is acceptable to monitor their\npartner without consent, a significant share of people (30%) doesn’t see any issue with it\nand find it acceptable under certain circumstances. Of those who think there are justifiable\nreasons for secret surveillance, almost two thirds would engage in the behavior if they\nbelieved their partner was being unfaithful (64%) or if it was related to their safety (63%) and\nhalf would if they believed their partner was involved in criminal activities (50%).\n\n\n##### 8 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ICT technologies are powerful tools for perpetrators exerting coercive control, especially in relationships where violence is already present offline\n\n\nHigh speed internet in conjunction with the rapid spread of information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) has supported cyber-violence by creating another tool\nfor abusers to share violent and dangerous materials or engage in behaviors that affect\nemotional, psychological or physical damage. While these technologies have given people\nthe ability to maintain social and emotional relationships across wide-ranging physical\ndistances, ICT has also enabled cyber-violence – a consequence that’s far-reaching\neffects extend to the offline world with real-life negative impacts on its victims.\n\nThe results of our survey corroborate this, with 15% of respondents worldwide being\nrequired by their partner to install a monitoring app and 34% of those also experiencing\nphysical and/or verbal abuse by that intimate partner.\n\nWhile it is too early to make definitive conclusions on the decrease of affected users in\n2021, there are two theories that could explain this trend.\n\nFirstly, we believe that all aspects of our lives are still heavily impacted by the pandemic.\n[Recent studies show that new behaviors are emerging across areas of life such as work,](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/library/covid-19-consumer-behavior-survey.html)\nlearning, home, consumption, communications and information, travel and mobility. In\nshort, people are staying at home more (49% avoid leaving their homes and 50% are\nworking from home partially or entirely), reducing face to face interactions (57% indicate\nthat they are socially distancing from friends and the community) and traveling, and\nshopping, educating and entertaining themselves increasingly online. From an abuser’s\npoint of view, this could result in less need to spy on their partner, who is now in their\nsight most of the time.\n\nSecondly, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digitization are now everywhere in our lives.\nIt fills our daily routines and our homes, cars and offices. While the opportunities and\n[advantages are endless, many devices also enable tracking by third parties. Our research](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2021/11/17164103/Kaspersky_Digital-stalking-in-relationships_Report_FINAL.pdf)\nsuggests that perpetrators might also use other means, aside from stalkerware, to track\ntheir partners, with 50% of respondents to our survey indicating that they have been\ntracked through phone apps, another 29% mentioning they had been traced through\ntracking devices, 22% through webcams and 18% through smart home devices.\n\nApple’s recent January 2022 publication of a safety manual for its AirTag product marks a\nshift in the perception of the situation.\n\nNNEDV, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and WWP EN, the European\nNetwork for the Work with Perpetrators of Domestic Violence share with us their\nexperience and views on these two theories and on tech abuse in general.\n\n#### How measures imposed by governments during the pandemic facilitated and reinforced perpetrators’ coercive control — Berta\n##### Vall Castelló, Research and Development manager and Anna McKenzie, Communications manager at WWP EN\n\nCoercive control is defined as “a pattern of abusive behavior designed to exercise\ndomination and control over the other party to a relationship. It can include a range of\nabusive behaviors – physical, psychological, emotional or financial – the cumulative effect\nof which over time robs victim-survivors of their autonomy and independence as an\nindividual” (McGorrery and McMahon, 2020). As we write in our manual “Same Violence,\nNew Tools – How to work with violent men who use cyberviolence,” perpetrators isolate\ntheir partners and make them emotionally dependent. They use assaults, threats,\nintimidation, humiliation, isolation and more to create a constant sense of fear, as well as a\ngeneral loss of a sense of freedom. ICT technologies are powerful tools for perpetrators\nexerting coercive control, especially in relationships where violence is already present\noffline.\n\nA recent review on domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic found that\nthe measures imposed by the government during lockdown facilitate and reinforce\nperpetrators’ coercive control. The authors suggested that the conditions of isolation/\nphysical distancing imposed by the governments overlap with coercive control strategies\nused by perpetrators to control their partners (Pentaraki and Speake, 2020). Considering\nthese results, it seems likely that perpetrators feel less of a “need” to use stalkerware to\nexert coercive control over their partners. Moreover, recent research has observed that\ntechnology-facilitated abuse often escalates during a period of separation (George and\nHarris 2014; Woodlock 2016). Therefore, during a lockdown situation where couples were\nforced to stay together at home, they are less likely to use technology-facilitated abuse.\n\n\n##### 9 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The measures imposed by the government during lockdown facilitate and reinforce perpetrators’ coercive control\n\n\nWe must remember that a decrease in the use of stalkerware does not equal a decrease\nin overall intimate partner violence (IPV) during the pandemic. On the contrary, Boxall,\nMorgan and Brown (2020) note that IPV has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTherefore, the results in this report indicate that stalkerware has been replaced with\nother tools. As Elena Gajotto, from Italian NGO Una Casa per l’Uomo, remarks: “It is so\neasy to monitor and track someone, for example by using their Google account, that you\ndon’t really need to use stalkerware.” The wide variety of possible technology-facilitated\nabuse might have had an impact on the decrease in the use of stalkerware specifically.\nLetizia Baroncelli, from Italian NGO Centro Ascolto Uomini Malttratanti (CAM), agrees\nand adds: “I think we see less stalkerware because there are so many other forms of\nperpetrating digital abuse.”\n\nHowever, NGOs, governments and researchers have reported a substantial increase\nin image-based abuse and sextortion since the start of the pandemic (Boniello, 2020;\nCCRI, personal communication, June 2, 2020; FBI, 2020, 2021). It seems that this type of\ntechnology-facilitated abuse has escalated, especially among teenagers and couples\nwho do not live together. As Letizia Baroncelli notes: “Sharing personal pictures has\nincreased a lot since the pandemic, especially among young perpetrators. They do not\nunderstand that they are committing a crime.” As Elena Gajotto adds: “Image-based\nabuse causes devastating harm to the women who experience it, while the men don’t\neven understand that they did something bad.”\n\nSeveral WWP EN members have shared that the most common form of digital violence is\nmen monitoring their partners’ digital activities, e.g. by checking emails, phones and social\naccounts. This is in line with observations from Daniel Antunovic, from Croatian NGO\nUZOR, who agrees that the ‘primitive’ forms of digital stalking are the ones he sees most\noften.\n\nAt WWP EN, we consider it key to focus on tech-facilitated abuse to ensure victim\nsafety. Elena Gajotto adds: “Around half of the men share their digital violence, without\nrealizing that this is abuse. If we don’t explicitly focus on this violence in our work with\nperpetrators, it doesn’t come up.” Therefore, there is a need to increase the capacity\n\n\n##### 10 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nof professionals working with perpetrators and professionals working with victims of\ndomestic violence to screen for and intervene in cases of digital violence. As Daniel\nAntunovic adds: “We haven’t encountered as many cases of digital violence as I expected\nsince COVID-19. However, technology-facilitated abuse is in some ways like sexualized\nviolence. It happens a lot, but it remains hidden.”\n\n#### There is a growing rate of “smart devices” used in intimate partner\n\n##### NNEDV violence — Toby Shulruff, Tech Safety Project Manager at NNEDV\n\nNNEDVs Safety Net Project focuses\n\nWhile stalkerware is a common concern, there are many other tools available for tech\n\non the intersection of technology,\n\nabuse that may appear to be stalkerware, but are not. For example, personal information\n\nprivacy, confidentiality, and\ninnovation, as it relates to safety and available online and the everyday features of devices and accounts can be used to find\nabuse by advocating for policies, a person’s location or track their activity. The complexity and connections between\neducating and training advocates and devices, accounts, and information on the internet can make it difficult for victims and\nprofessionals in the justice system, those who work with them to assess what’s happening, and to implement an effective\nand working with communities, response. It can be terrifying and overwhelming for a survivor to realize an abuser knows\nagencies, and technology companies multiple details about their everyday lives.\nto respond to technology abuse,\nsupport survivors in their use of tech, Unfortunately, there is a growing rate of “smart” devices— including home assistants,\nand harness tech to improve services.\n\nconnected appliances, and security systems connected to WiFi networks and\n\n[https://nnedv.org/content/mission-](https://nnedv.org/content/mission-vision/) smartphones—used in intimate partner violence.\n[vision/](https://nnedv.org/content/mission-vision/)\n\n[In a survey conducted by the NNEDV in December 2020 and January 2021, responses](https://www.techsafety.org/blog/2021/10/7/tech-abuse-in-the-pandemic-amp-beyond-reflections-from-the-field-2021)\nrevealed an increase in every type of tech abuse during the pandemic. While phones are\nthe technology most often misused, NNEDV’s needs assessment shows this to be the\ncase 87% of the time, “smart” or connected devices were also identified as technologies\nthat are increasingly misused in the context of tech abuse, seen regularly by about a third\nof support professionals.\n\n##### 11 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n##### There is a growing rate of “smart” devices — including home assistants, connected appliances, and security systems connected to Wi-Fi networks and smartphones — used in intimate partner violence\n\n\nAs more people adopt the use of IoT devices, this will likely grow. These products are\nintended to increase convenience and efficiency. The manufacture of IoT devices is\na rapidly emerging global market with both larger, well-established players as well as\nmany smaller, newer companies[1]. IoT is made possible by several overlapping trends in\ntechnology: miniaturization, increased processing capacity, increased data storage,\ndecreased cost of manufacturing, and connectivity.\n\nDue to a variety of factors - market pressures, the rapid emergence of the technology,\nand the complexity of the IoT - profound risks to security and privacy are increasingly\napparent[2]. Smart home devices in particular are being misused in the context of intimate\npartner violence to control, threaten, and cause harm to victims. [Researchers at the\nGender + IoT project at University College London[3] have been exploring these harms]\n\n[and proposing remedies in partnership with support professionals in the field.]\n\nNNEDV’s recent needs assessment documented increases in tech abuse tactics\nthroughout the pandemic. We are concerned that as we emerge from this public health\ncrisis, abusers who have adopted these tactics or have increased their misuse of\ntechnology during this time will not have any incentive to discontinue this form of abuse.\nRecent research[4] suggests support professionals should ask about all kinds of tech\nabuse, including stalkerware and smart home devices. There is a strong likelihood the\nspike in tech abuse support professionals have seen will stay with us. It’s imperative we\ncontinue to support victims, and work to prevent technology abuse.\n\n1 Internet Society. (2015).

For the past few years, Kaspersky has been at the forefront\nof the stalkerware debate. We are reaching out to public and private stakeholders to better\nunderstand this issue and find common solutions. We are contributing to the development\nof training materials and practical tools to support non-profit organizations, corporations,\ninstitutions and individuals with developing resilience to stalkerware. We are organizing\nand participating in webinars and roundtables with institutions to share our voices and\ncontribute to discussions that will shape tomorrow’s legislation.\n\n[Kaspersky is one of the co-founders and drivers of the Coalition Against Stalkerware](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\n[(CAS) — an international working group dedicated to tackling stalkerware and combating](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\ndomestic violence. The Coalition brings together organizations that work with victims\nand abusers, digital activists and cybersecurity vendors. It is a unique platform that\nenables all relevant stakeholders to share best practices and join forces to tackle the\nissue of stalkerware.\n\n[Kaspersky is also one of the partners of the DeStalk](https://www.work-with-perpetrators.eu/destalk) project. Funded by the European\nCommission, this research project aims to develop a strategy to train and support\nprofessionals working in victims support services and perpetrator programmes, officers\nof institutions and local governments along with other relevant groups. The consortium\nplans to upgrade and test existing tools for practitioners and is developing a regional pilot\nawareness campaign in Italy.\n\nIn 2021, we teamed up with INTERPOL and two respected non-profit organizations\nfrom the US and Australia to provide law enforcement officials with two online training\nsessions. These courses were attended by over 210 participants from around the world.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Kaspersky also participated in an event, “Combating violence against\nwomen in a digital age - utilising the Istanbul Convention”, organized by the Council of\nEurope. This event was an opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the Group of\nExperts on combating violence against women and domestic violence (GREVIO).\n\n#### TinyCheck: a tool to support victims of domestic violence\n\n[Kaspersky’s work with the TinyCheck tool is an initiative worth highlighting. It is a free,](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/TinyCheck)\nopen-source tool developed and supported by Kaspersky. Initially created to help\nNPOs protect victims of domestic violence and their privacy, TinyCheck facilitates the\ndetection of stalkerware on victims’ devices and on any OS in a simple, quick and noninvasive way without making the perpetrator aware. While security solutions can also\ncheck for and alert about stalkerware, they need to be installed on the device, so there is\na risk of the perpetrator also being alerted. Developments like the TinyCheck tool aim to\nensure that survivors can use their devices without concerns about being surveilled.\n\nWith TinyCheck, no application needs to be installed on the device to perform the\ncheck, and the results of the check are not displayed on or transmitted to the potentially\ninfected device. In addition, TinyCheck allows victims to check any device regardless\nof whether it uses iOS, Android or another OS. These features address the two major\nissues in the fight to protect users against stalkerware. The tool has been developed\nto run on a Raspberry Pi, using a regular Wi-Fi connection. TinyCheck quickly analyzes\na mobile device’s outgoing traffic and identifies Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such\nas interactions with known malicious sources like stalkerware-related servers. Currently,\nthe tool uses IOCs collected not only by Kaspersky researchers but also by repositories\nmaintained by independent security researchers (special thanks to Etienne Maynier, also\nknown as Tek, from Echap and Cian Heasley). We hope that the community will continue\nthis work by keeping IOCs up-to-date.\n\nHaving said that, the limitations of TinyCheck need to be understood. The tool should\nbe used with the following warning in mind: IOCs do not provide complete real-time\n[detection of all stalkerware apps like an IT Security solution does. Therefore, a result](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/stalkerware-detection-tactics/)\ndetecting no stalkerware does not exclude the possibility that stalkerware has been\ninstalled but not detected by TinyCheck.\n\nIn 2021, more NPOs in the field of domestic violence tested TinyCheck and provided\nfeedback to help improve the service. Police forces and judicial bodies in several\ncountries have also taken an interest in the tool to better support victims.\n\n\n##### 13 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2021 has seen positive developments on the regulatory and institutional fronts\n\nAcross the world, 2021 has seen some positive developments in the fight against\nstalkerware from a regulatory and institutional point of view. In May 2021, the Diet, Japan’s\n[parliament, enacted a bill to amend their stalker regulation law. Under the revised law, in](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2021051800656/)\naddition to other stipulations, obtaining location information of people’s smartphones\nthrough apps without their authorization is now illegal.\n\n[In August 2021, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States barred one app maker](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-finalizes-order-banning-stalkerware-provider-spyware-business)\nfrom offering stalkerware. It was the first ban of its kind.\n\nOn August 17, 2021, the German Bundestag passed the “Act to Amend the Criminal\nCode - More Effective Combating of Stalking and Better Coverage of Cyberstalking”\n(translated from German). The new law entered into force on October 1, 2021, and now\nincludes cyberstalking in their catalog of offenses. The change is because of continued\ntechnological progress and the associated increase in cyberstalking, particularly via\nstalking apps or stalkerware. In addition, an important part of the new law is that it\nclassifies a case as serious if the offender “in the course of an offense, uses a computer\nprogram whose purpose is the digital spying on other persons.”\n\nThe Council of Europe has been very active on this topic in 2021. In its first\nrecommendation on the “digital dimension” of violence against women, the Council of\nEurope’s Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic\nViolence (GREVIO) defines and outlines the problems of both gender-based violence\nagainst women committed online and technology-enabled attacks against women, such\nas legally obtainable tracking devices that enable perpetrators to stalk their victims.\nThis was shortly followed in December 2021 by a legislative initiative report on genderbased cyberviolence that was adopted by the European Parliament. The report calls\nfor (i) a common definition of gender-based cyberviolence and (ii) capacity building for\nstakeholders. It highlights stalkerware among the key methods of cyberviolence and\n“dismisses the notion that stalkerware applications can be considered parental control\napplications”. Following the general recommendations of the Council of Europe, this\n\n##### 14 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n##### If you need help, reach out to a local support organization. To find one close to you, check the Coalition Against Stalkerware website\n\n\nreport, although non binding, is another positive official document highlighting the\nstalkerware issue and pushing European states to adapt their legislations and actions\nto counter the issue. Finally, on March 8th, 2022, the European Commission published\na proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating\nviolence against women and domestic violence. The document covers cyber violence\nand dedicates two articles to cyber stalking (Art 8) and cyber harassment (Art 9) that it\nproposes to criminalize.\n\n## Think you are a victim of stalkerware? Here are a few tips\n\nWhether or not you are a victim of stalkerware, here are a few tips if you want to better\nprotect yourself:\n\n- Protect your phone with a strong password that you never share with your partner,\nfriends or colleagues\n\n- Change passwords for all of your accounts periodically and don’t share them with\nanyone\n\n- Only download apps from official sources, such as Google Play or the Apple App Store\n\n- Install a reliable IT security solution like Kaspersky Internet Security for Android on\ndevices and scan them regularly. However, in the case of potentially already installed\nstalkerware, this should only be done after the risk to the victim has been assessed, as\nthe abuser may notice the use of a cybersecurity solution.\n\nVictims of stalkerware may be victims of a larger cycle of abuse, including physical. In\nsome cases, the perpetrator is notified if their victim performs a device scan or removes\na stalkerware app. If this happens, it can lead to an escalation of the situation and further\naggression. This is why it is important to proceed with caution if you think you are being\ntargeted by stalkerware.\n\n- **Reach out to a local support organization: to find one close to you, check the**\n[Coalition Against Stalkerware website.](https://stopstalkerware.org/resources/)\n\n- **Keep an eye out for the following warning signs: these can include a fast-draining**\nbattery due to unknown or suspicious apps using up its charge and newly-installed\napplications with suspicious access to use and track your location, send or receive\ntext messages and other personal activities. Also check if your “unknown sources”\nsetting is enabled, it may be a sign that unwanted software has been installed from a\nthird party source. It is important to note that the above signs are only symptoms of\npossible stalkerware installation, not a definitive indication.\n\n- **Do not try to erase the stalkerware, change any settings or tamper with your**\n**phone: this may alert your potential perpetrator and lead to an escalation of the**\nsituation. You also risk erasing important data or evidence that could be used in a\nprosecution.\n\n#### For more information about our activities on stalkerware or any other request, please write us to ExtR@kaspersky.com.\n\n\n##### 15 Th S f S lk i 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The Coalition Against Stalkerware was founded in November 2019 in response to the growing threat of stalkerware.
