attack\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hashicorp-is-the-latest-victim-of-codecov-supply-chain-attack/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hashicorp-is-the-latest-victim-of-codecov-supply-chain-attack/)**\n\nAx Sharma\n\nBy\n[Ax Sharma](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ax-sharma/)\n\nApril 24, 2021\n02:16 AM\n0\n\nOpen-source software tools and Vault maker HashiCorp has disclosed a security incident\nthat occurred due to the recent Codecov attack.\n\nHashiCorp, a Codecov customer, has stated that the recent Codecov supply-chain attack\naimed at collecting developer credentials led to the exposure of HashiCorp's GPG signing\nkey.\n\nThe private key is used by HashiCorp to sign and verify software releases, and has since\nbeen rotated as a precaution.\n\n## HashiCorp discloses code-signing key compromise\n\nThis week, HashiCorp, a notable open-source software tools and infrastructure provider,\n[disclosed that the recent Codecov supply-chain attack had impacted a subset of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-codecov-code-coverage-tool-hacked-to-steal-dev-credentials/)\ntheir Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines\n\n\n-----\n\nThe company states that as a result of this, the GPG key used by HashiCorp to sign and\nverify software releases was exposed.\n\nCodecov provides software testing and code coverage services to over 29,000 customers.\n\nOn April 1st, Codecov had learned that due to a flaw in their Docker image, threat actors\nhad obtained credentials to the Bash Uploader scripts used by their customers.\n\nThe Bash Uploaders were modified with a malicious line of code that exfiltrated\nenvironment variables and secrets collected from some customers' CI/CD environments, to\nan attacker-controlled server.\n\n**Instances of Codecov Bash Uploader used in HashiCorp code**\nAccording to Codecov's investigation, the initial compromise of the Bash Uploader\nhappened on January 31, making this attack last around two months.\n\nIn all this, HashiCorp's GPG private keythat signs hashes used to verify HashiCorp's\nproduct downloads was exposed.\n\n\"While investigation has not revealed evidence of unauthorized usage of the exposed GPG\nkey, it has been rotated in order to maintain a trusted signing mechanism.\"\n\nA new GPG keypair (fingerprint shown below) has been published that is to be used from\nnow on:\n\n\n-----\n\nC874 011F 0AB4 0511 0D02 1055 3436 5D94 72D7 468F\n\nThe older, compromised GPG keypair (fingerprint shown below) has been revoked:\n\n91A6 E7F8 5D05 C656 30BE F189 5185 2D87 348F FC4C\n\n[\"Existing releases have been validated and re-signed,\" states HashiCorp in a security event](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2021-12-codecov-security-event-and-hashicorp-gpg-key-exposure/23512)\ndisclosure.\n\nAccording to HashiCorp, this incident has only impacted HashiCorp's SHA256SUM signing\nmechanism.\n\n**Example SHA256SUM files provided with HashiCorp releases**\nMacOS code signing (notarization), as well as, Windows AuthentiCode signing of\nHashiCorp releases, has not been affected by the exposed private key.\n\nLikewise, signing for Linux packages (Debian and RPM) available\non [releases.hashicorp.com remains unaffected.](http://releases.hashicorp.com/)\n\n## HashiCorp's Terraform yet to be patched\n\nHowever, HashiCorp's advisory does state that their Terraform product is yet to be patched\nto use the new GPG key.\n\nTerraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code software tool used for safely and\npredictably creating, changing, and improving infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nTerraform automatically downloads provider binaries during the `terraform`\n```\ninit operation and performs signature verification during this process,\" states Jamie\n\n```\nFinnigan, HashiCorp's Director of Product security.\n\nThe company states that patched releases of Terraform and related tools will be published\nthat use the new GPG key during automatic code verification.\n\n\"In the short term, transport-level TLS protects official Terraform provider binaries\ndownloaded during `init, and manual verification of Terraform and its providers can be`\nperformed with the new key and signatures as described\nat [https://hashicorp.com/security,\" continues Finnigan in the security advisory.](https://hashicorp.com/security)\n\nAs a part of its incident response activities, HashiCorp is further investigating if any other\ninformation was exposed from the Codecov incident and plans on providing\nrelevant updates, as the investigation progresses.\n\nAs reported by BleepingComputer earlier this week, hundreds of Codecov customer\n[networks were reportedly breached due to the Codecov Bash Uploader compromise.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hundreds-of-networks-reportedly-hacked-in-codecov-supply-chain-attack/)\n\nU.S. federal investigators have also stepped in and are working with Codecov and their\ncustomers, to investigate the full impact of the attack.\n\nAs such, more security disclosures are expected to come out in the following weeks from\ndifferent customers.\n\nSoftware supply-chain attacks continue to be on the rise as they become the latest focus of\nthreat actors.\n\nJust yesterday, BleepingComputer reported that the Passwordstate enterprise password\n[manager used by many Fortune 500 customers was hacked in a supply-chain attack.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/passwordstate-password-manager-hacked-in-supply-chain-attack/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hacker says hijacking libraries, stealing AWS keys
