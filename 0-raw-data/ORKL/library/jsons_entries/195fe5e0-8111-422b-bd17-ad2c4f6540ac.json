Ice IX Botnet is the first new generation of web\napplications developed to manage centralized botnets through the HTTP protocol based on\nleaked ZeuS source code.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe crimeware of this style is designed to steal banking information. So, it is very clear that\nwe must focus attention on these threats and take into account that this “modified version of\nZeuS” has been In-the-Wild since the beginning of year. The following picture is evidence\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) data theft by this browser hooking malware:\n\nThe latest version of Ice IX Botnet is 1.0.5, and it is selling for a very competitive $1800 in\nthe underground markets.\n\nIt is clear that from now on, more new crimeware will be based on ZeuS code. New\ndevelopers, hoping to profit from cybercrime, will attempt to create their own new alternatives\nbased on this source.\n\nAt Kaspersky Lab, we investigate the impact of not only this particular threat but also new\nemerging crimeware. We work to keep you informed!\n\n[Botnets](https://securelist.com/tag/botnets/)\n[Malware Creators](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-creators/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[ZeuS](https://securelist.com/tag/zeus/)\n\nAuthors\n\nJorge Mieres\n\nIce IX, the first crimeware based on the leaked ZeuS sources\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.
