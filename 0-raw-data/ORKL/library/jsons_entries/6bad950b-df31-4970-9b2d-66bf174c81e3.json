When the U.S. Justice Department_\n_[unsealed charges last month against six Russian intelligence officers, prosecutors detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/politics/russian-intelligence-cyberattacks.html)_\n_how Russia used malware to damage Ukraine’s power grid in 2015 and 2016, and targeted_\n_the country in 2017 with the NotPetya attack that quickly spiraled out of control and is_\n_considered the most costly cyberattack in history._\n\n_Throughout that time, Serhii Demediuk perhaps played the most prominent role in defending_\n_Ukraine against digital intrusions, investigating cyberattacks and the groups behind them,_\n_and strengthening the country’s capabilities in cyberspace. In 2015, Demediuk was tasked_\n_with building out Ukraine’s CyberPolice force, which prosecutes cybercriminals and thwarts_\n_state-sponsored attacks. Last year, the president of Ukraine appointed Demediuk as the_\n_Deputy Secretary of the country’s National Security and Defense Council._\n\n_Demediuk talked to Recorded Future expert threat intelligence analyst Dmitry Smilyanets_\n_about the most dangerous attacks he’s dealt with, as well as new threats that he’s bracing_\n_for. The interview was conducted in Russian and translated to English with the help of a_\n\n\n-----\n\n_professional translator, and has been lightly edited for clarity._\n\n**Dmitry Smilyanets: You said recently that the Russian special services collect**\n**information about Ukrainians through social media mobile applications, and also uses**\n**social networks to spread disinformation to influence and manipulate public opinion.**\n**Can you share examples of what you’ve seen?**\n\n**Serhii Demediuk: First of all, it should be said that social networks are still the most**\naccessible platforms for the dissemination and exchange of various information and are the\nmost suitable space for manipulating the opinions of users. The data that users themselves\nleave there allows others to determine their personalities with very high accuracy, calculate\ntheir preferences and hobbies, as well as political beliefs at the time of the analysis. Existing\nartificial intelligence technologies very quickly identify and filter out specially-crafted bots,\nfictional accounts, and other unnecessary accounts. This information makes it possible to\nclassify users of social networks into social groups necessary for the massive use of social\nengineering in order to gain psychological control over the most active users of a particular\ngroup. And then, as they say, it’s a matter of technology—to whom and in what quantity to\nprovide the necessary information to obtain the expected result. The result can be anything,\nincluding an aggressive attitude towards anything or anyone, support for radical movements,\ngroups, etc.\n\n_Serhii Demediuk_\n\nControlled media are used in order to get the result obtained from the internet and bring it to\nlife. The appearance of critical information from the social network in the media is an\nindicator of its veracity and the embodiment of emotions accumulated online, which can be\nanything. And given the fact that social networks have long ceased to be an exclusive\nconsumer service for the communication between friends, and have become a mouthpiece\nfor politics and an advertising platform for business, their use has become attractive to\neveryone, without exception, including the special services of different countries, including\nRussia.\n\nThe issue of fakes and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has appeared in\nalmost every country. Today, the international community is actively looking for ways to\nprevent the spread of false content on social platforms, as well as to increase the\nresponsibility of social networks for inadequate measures related to the identification and\n\n\n-----\n\nremoval of specially-created fake accounts. But the corresponding measures taken by\ndifferent countries have almost no effect. I believe this is due to the fact that the\ngovernments, including Ukraine, communicate very poorly with their citizens. They provide\nofficially only that information which, in their opinion, should be of interest to citizens, and\nincomplete or hidden information about facts always arouses curiosity and breeds distrust. In\naddition, psychologically most people do not trust authorities by default, which in itself\nreinforces this distrust. Moreover, the majority of people don’t trust their governments by\ndefault, which only heightens this distrust. Therefore, any misinformation that criticizes or\nexposes the actions of state bodies will always be in demand. There are many and very\ndifferent examples of this manipulation. Just think of the case of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAs for Ukraine, I can give just a few examples that demonstrate the power of social\ninfluence. To do this, I want to mention the events of this past February that took place in the\nUkrainian village of Novi Sanzhary (in the Poltava region), when the dissemination of\ninaccurate information on social networks and the media about a possible unprecedented\ncoronavirus infection caused riots during a meeting of Ukrainian and other citizens\n[evacuated from Wuhan. The situation in Novi Sanzhary was caused by the lack of reliable](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51581805)\nand complete information from the government and inconsistency in the information policy of\nthe authorities that took part in the evacuation. This situation, associated with the evacuation\nof Ukrainian citizens from Wuhan, was used by Russia as part of the information war against\nUkraine, using the topic of coronavirus to destabilize the situation throughout Ukraine.\n\nAn important aspect of the information and propaganda operations of the Russian special\nservices was an active internal and external information policy regarding the maximum\ncoverage of events in Ukraine from a perspective favorable to the Russian Federation—\nnumerous talk shows, the creation and promotion of the relevant communities in social\nnetworks. All this is then scaled through other communications (related communications,\nInternet resources, satellite TV). The activities of the Russian special services are\nmanifested in the intensification of work to attract expertise (institutes of civil society created\nby them) to information operations, which produces an additional targeted negative impact\non the public opinion of our citizens.\n\nIn addition to intensive anti-Ukrainian information campaigns inside Ukraine, the Russian\nFederation systematically intensifies them abroad. One of the priority tasks of the Kremlin’s\ninformation and propaganda activities with regard to Ukraine is to provoke tension between\nour state and neighboring countries (Poland, Hungary, Turkey, other neighboring and allied\ncountries). For example, the Russian special services have been directing active antiUkrainian information and propaganda activities towards Poland. Among Polish users of\nsocial networks, the most popular of which are Facebook and Twitter, content which\nallegedly indisputably proves the facts of cooperation between the Organization of Ukrainian\nNationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) with the Hitlerite regime during\nWorld War II and the UPA’s implementation of massive war crimes against the peaceful\nPolish population is widely disseminated [Editor’s Note: The OUN and UPA were nationalist\n\n\n-----\n\n_political organizations active during World War II that fought extensively against the Polish_\n_communist army. In recent years, the Parliament of Poland officially accused the groups of_\n_genocide, which has been disputed by historians outside of the country]. The reason the_\nRussian Federation does this is the total flooding of the information space of our neighbor\nwith false, primitive disinformation that is accessible to ordinary citizens.\n\nA similar example of an information operation aimed at undermining the relations between\nUkraine and its neighbors, using social networks, is the dissemination at the end of 2019\nthrough Telegram channels controlled by the special services of the Russian Federation\n(“Mole of the SBU”, “Joker DNR”) of information about the alleged murder on the border with\nHungary, of four SBU officers. At the same time, it was noted in news reports that the group\n“performed tasks of documenting smuggling traffic” through the “private section of the border”\nof Ukraine with Hungary and Romania. This provocation, with reference to anonymous\nsources in the SBU, was further amplified by a number of Russian media outlets. In turn, the\nSBU exposed this fake a week before the mass dissemination, which nonetheless did not\naffect the organization and holding of anti-government rallies on this issue.\n\nToday we can already assert that the organizers of these information attacks and the spread\nof disinformation against Ukraine are the employees of the military unit of the Russian\nFederation 54777.\n\nI believe that in order to prevent potential threats that may be caused by the use of social\nnetworks and messaging apps, it is necessary to develop media literacy of society at the\nstate level. In our country, we managed to include that priority in the National Security\nStrategy of Ukraine, recently approved by the President of Ukraine. In particular, raising the\nlevel of media culture in society should become a tool to counter the spread of\ndisinformation. I also urge everyone to train themselves to, by default, not trust information\nfrom unverified sources, primarily those that appear on social networks or with a\nlink/reference to them.\n\nOf course, the law enforcement agencies of our country know that the listed hacker\ngroups of the Russian special services have a spy network in the hacker environment\nof Ukraine. Most of these participants have been identified and are being monitored.”\n\n**DS: Do you think attacks such as the ones targeting Ukraine’s critical infrastructure**\n**should be regarded as military aggression? How can they be countered?**\n\n**SD: All attacks on critical infrastructure should be judged according to their classification.**\nAttacks aimed at damaging network infrastructure and interference in the operation of\ninformation systems—the performance of which can negatively affect the life of society—\nshould be regarded as terrorist, irrespective of whether these attacks were internal or\nexternal.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuch attacks can be classified as military aggression only if they come from another state\nand are aimed at changing the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of\nour state. But it is hard for me to imagine what these attacks could be without the use of\nclassical armed forces.\n\nIt has been necessary to prepare for counteracting such attacks since the very beginning of\nthe development and use of information systems and technologies. First of all, this is the\nselection and training of personnel for their maintenance, administration, and implementation\nof security, both external and cybernetic. The human factor (insider knowledge) is still key in\nthis area.\n\nIt is advisable to use software with available source code that can be checked for\nvulnerabilities. In addition, you need to connect to existing systems to exchange information\non cyber incidents, both public and private, in real-time. Never use software and hardware\nfrom one vendor when building information systems.\n\nAnd the most time-consuming and boring factor for the employer is systematic training in\ncyber hygiene. As my experience in the field of cyber defense and combating cybercrime\nshows, the majority of successful attacks resulted mainly from the negligent or careless\nattitude of employees of the victim institution, organization, or company.\n\n**DS:** **Which “bear” is the most active in Ukrainian networks—APT28, also known as**\n**Fancy Bear, or APT29, known as Cozy Bear? Do you expect these groups to**\n**coordinate with people on the ground in Ukraine? Do you see an overlap between**\n**cybercriminals and those engaged by government special services?**\n\n**SD: According to the information I know, Turla, APT28, and Sandworm are still active. The**\nlatter even tried to launch a supply chain attack like NotPetya again.\n\nOf course, the law enforcement agencies of our country know that the listed hacker groups of\nthe Russian special services have a spy network in the hacker environment of Ukraine. Most\nof these participants have been identified and are being monitored. Some of them agreed to\ncooperate with law enforcement agencies and special services of Ukraine. This is laborious\nand fruitful work with our international partners.\n\nObserving the hacking activities of the Russian special services showed that, in addition to\ntheir regular employees they also employ cybercriminals.\n\nThe confirmation was that on days free from special operations, they were engaged in\ncommon criminal activities, from the distribution of ransomware to the theft of cryptocurrency.\nIt was these crimes that gave us the opportunity to identify almost all members of these\ngroups, both intelligence officers and cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, for all their crimes, these groups used the same methods of renting servers,\nregistering accounts, legalizing and using stolen cryptocurrency (both for the needs of\ncriminal activity and for personal purposes), as well as creating botnets. They didn’t worry\nmuch about the malware they used for almost all of their operations with minimal changes to\nthe code. Their “bearish habits” also led to other mistakes, which I cannot yet talk about,\nexcept for the ones above, which made it possible to identify all participants and their\naccomplices in Ukraine and the European Union, as well as to determine the belonging of\neach to a particular group.\n\n**DS:** **Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice officially accused six officers of the**\n**Russian GRU of military unit 74455 for attacks on, among other things, critical**\n**infrastructure in Ukraine. Perhaps you can comment on this in more detail?**\n\n**SD: I can only say that the CyberPolice of Ukraine has done a tremendous job on this case.**\nIn the early days of the attack, police officers were recording and establishing the digital\ntraces from all servers that were used in the attack both in Ukraine and abroad around the\nclock. Of course, not all countries contributed to this. Precisely until the moment when they\nthemselves began to feel the consequences of this attack, and this was the first two or three\nhours after the active phase of the attack. At the same time, these couple of hours were\nenough for the criminals to clean up some of their servers.\n\nIt was the information collected at that time that made it possible to restore in detail all the\nevents and track all the participants, all the way up to their organizers, who were announced\nby the U.S. State Department.\n\nIt should be noted that all affected countries were involved in the investigation of this case.\nBut active investigative actions, according to the information that we received, were carried\nout only in Britain, the U.S., Ukraine, and France. During the first months of the investigation,\nit was possible to quickly establish the involvement of the Russian special services and their\nSandworm group in organizing the attack. But it took three years to identify all of the involved\nGRU officers and their accomplices, as well as to collect evidence regarding each of their\nroles. The duration of the investigation was associated with the differences in the criminal\nprocedural legislation of each country, which took some time to resolve within the framework\nof international norms. So, when we established the involvement of a suspected group of\nhackers in other crimes (for example, interference in the French elections, attacks on critical\ninfrastructure in Estonia), these facts were immediately classified by the British and\nAmerican sides and were independently investigated by each side separately.\n\nBut this did not prevent us, along with the French side, to identify and decrypt the TOR\nserver, which hosted Sandworm’s command and control panels and stored almost all the\nmalicious programs that were used for attacks. The data obtained became the key evidence\nof the criminal activities of the GRU of the Russian Federation.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the same time, in addition to the GRU officers indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice,\nmany Russian-speaking accomplices living in the European Union and Ukrainian citizens\nwere identified, who agreed to cooperate and provided supporting evidence of the guilt of the\naccused.\n\n**DS:** **For several years now, official cooperation between the special services of the**\n**Russian Federation and Ukraine has been degrading, and in some areas is completely**\n**absent. But as far as I know, in the post-Soviet space, talented hackers maintain**\n**relations with specialists in information. How can you explain the lack of politics in**\n**the cyberspace domain? How do you deal with information leaks?**\n\n**SD: Fortunately, not all residents of the Russian Federation support the policies of their**\npresident and his government. At this stage, there can be no official cooperation, except for\ndiplomatic work and other activities related to saving human life. Many citizens of Ukraine\nand Russia still have contacts, acquaintances, friends, relatives from both sides. These\nconnections are mainly maintained at the household and commercial level, which allow them\nnot only to maintain relationships but also to carry out good projects, although, unfortunately,\nthere are facts to the opposite as well. In such relationships, you need to understand one\nthing: If one person does not recognize the political views or other beliefs of the other, then\nthere will be no relationship between such people.\n\nI think the relationship between hackers and IT and information security specialists is built at\nexactly the same level.\n\nWith regard to counteracting information leakage, in this regard, there have been many\nrecommendations developed that cannot be disclosed. In the public sector, for this, in\naddition to technological traps, there is the use of the tactic of dividing sensitive and critical\ninformation into parts, which in a segmented form will not pose any threat if disclosed.\nCovertly identifying such information for each user and periodically using distorted\ninformation for rechecking remains an effective method.\n\n**DS:** **Given the language and cultural and historical overlaps between Russia and**\n**Ukraine during Soviet times, is it possible to do effective counterintelligence in**\n**Ukraine? Does it exist?**\n\n**SD: Counterintelligence activities in Ukraine are carried out at a high level. Just look at the**\nrecent arrest of SBU General Shaitanov, who was recruited by the FSB of the Russian\nFederation.\n\nOur counterintelligence officers are doing an excellent job, they are great. Not all\ncircumstances can always be made public. Therefore, I cannot comment on\ncounterintelligence operations in cyberspace.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Serhii Demediuk_\n\n**It is no secret that most of the most famous and talented hackers are Ukrainians. Why**\n**are there so many? Do you know them personally? Which Ukranian hacker do you**\n**respect the most?**\n\n**SD: To be honest, I do not know how to explain this phenomenon. I can only express my**\nopinion and suggest that this may be related to the historical past and modern history of our\ncountry, in which our citizens have developed a desire to be free and independent. These\nare the qualities inherent in hackers.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot know all of the Ukrainian hackers. I only know those whom I’ve come\nacross while working in law enforcement and with whom I work now. I know not only their\nnames but a little more. There are an awful lot of them. Of course, not all of them are\npersonally acquainted with me, because my previous activity did not always provide for this,\nbut it obliged me to establish, search, and know them all personally.\n\nWe work with the community, there are different people who help out, depending on the\ntasks. Each specialist in their own direction, it is impossible to single out one brightest one,\nand I don’t think that would be a good idea anyway. Because if they work as a group, they do\nincredible things.\n\nWhile I was still the head of the CyberPolice, as a sign of our cooperation, I received a gift\n[from these guys—the personal hashtag #cyberdemediuk, which they use to designate me to](https://twitter.com/cyberdemediuk)\nthis day.\n\nI can only say that there is a woman hacker I know who I like, who during my period of\nbecoming a CyberPolice officer taught me a lot, made me think like them, accept them as\nthey are. A very good person.\n\n**DS:** **What was the most interesting investigation during your service in the**\n**CyberPolice of Ukraine? How did you manage to uncover it?**\n\n**SD: Here you need to consider that I happened to be the one who created the CyberPolice**\nin Ukraine. Which means that, over the course of a very short period of time, it was\nnecessary to develop a methodology, new ways of detecting and solving cyber crimes that\nwere not inherent in the police Therefore almost all the investigations in the period of 2014\n\n\n-----\n\nand 2015 were interesting. Over the course of time when I was the head of the Ukrainian\nCyberPolice, we had quite a few excellent cases, which we often recall with our colleagues. I\nthink these stories may turn into a decent book in the future. But most of all, I remember\ninvestigating the case of the activities of a hacker group, which at the end of 2017 was\nengaged in compromising cryptocurrency wallets on blockchain.com. The crime was\ncommitted for more than three years right under everyone’s noses and no one paid attention\nto it.\n\nWe were able to establish that members of this group, systematically through Google\nAdwords, advertised their phishing resources (for example, xn--blockchan-d5a.com,\nblokchreain.info, blokchreain.info, blokcheains.info, some using Punycode) to users who\nsearched for the phrase blockchain. The attackers deliberately relied on the widespread\npractice of Internet users getting to sites using search resources, mainly Google, so as not to\nmanually enter the URL in the browser line.\n\nThe phishing they used was different at that time in that it essentially proxied the\nblockchain.com resource using servers based on Nginx + LuaJIT that redirected requests to\nthe original site. The change of these headers themselves was carried out using a module\nwritten in the Lua programming language (in the Nginx web server). After the user logged\ninto the site, the modified Javascript (modified my-wallet.js) would steal the private and\npublic keys, sending them to the attackers’ servers via a POST request with the following\ndata: sharedkey, password, secondPassword, isDoubleEncrypted, pbkdf2_iterations,\naccounts.\n\nThe whole process of stealing the money was fully automated. The criminals had only to\nkeep track of advertising updates, purchase similar domains, and also administer and\nregularly hide the servers that hosted phishing resources and control panels. The Ukrainian\nhackers were responsible for the final actions, which lead us to the entire group since it was\nthrough them that we managed to gain access to their encrypted communication channels\nand find out that the group had up to eight members, six of whom were in the British Isles.\n\nThen, for a comprehensive investigation, we began collaborating with the threat intelligence\ndivision of Talos, Cisco, and British colleagues (SW RCCU), as a result of which the entire\ngroup was arrested. According to the investigation, the group controlled tens of millions of\nU.S. dollars.\n\nAnother good story is about the black notaries. A group of Ukrainian hackers hacked into the\ncomputers of our notaries and re-registered expensive real estate on their behalf to third\nparties. But that is a very long story since a lot of atypical methods were used here to gain\naccess to the necessary devices and unprecedented conspiracy methods.\n\n**DS:** **How did you manage to achieve such effectiveness with your CyberPolice and**\n**crime detection? Is it because white hat hackers work in the CyberPolice? How**\n**frequently are people with a questionable past accepted to the civil service—namely**\n\n\n-----\n\n**the hackers whom you managed to identify?**\n\n**SD: Of course, the key element in the work of the CyberPolice, I believe, were those very**\nwhite hat hackers—special agents, as we called them—whom we managed to convince with\ngreat difficulty to work for us in 2015. This was an innovation for our country and it was the\nfirst time this was done. But now, after some time has passed, I can safely say that this was\none of the best initiatives that I managed to implement. High-class specialists came to serve\nin the police. It was these guys who introduced new and non-traditional approaches to our\nwork. Of course, when the work of a white hacker is strengthened by the capabilities and\nauthority of law enforcement agencies, such as conducting operational and technical\nactivities, this achieves an excellent result.\n\nIt was not easy to recruit white hat hackers. This was due to the fact that the public sector\ncould not then offer decent compensation to such specialists. Provide them with proper\nhardware and software. But the most difficult factor in this was psychologically convincing\nthese people to share their knowledge and best practices with the state. But everything\nworked out and the CyberPolice was born.\n\nAs for the official cooperation with the citizens of Ukraine, who are suspected by the law\nenforcement agencies of other countries of hacking their information systems or committing\nother cybercrimes, but who at the same time did not commit anything similar on the territory\nof Ukraine, this is another initiative of mine. It is motivated by the fact that, according to\nUkrainian legislation, citizens of Ukraine cannot be extruded to other countries. Secondly,\nmost of the cybercrimes in which such persons are suspected were mainly committed\nunintentionally or under the duress of third parties. Thirdly, they have colossal non-typical\nknowledge that could be useful both to our state and to the state to which they caused\ndamage. And most importantly, they are aware of their responsibility and are ready to\nredeem their guilt by working for the state. But so far this initiative remains unrealized. There\nare an awful lot of disagreements in our own and in international legislation that need to be\nresolved. Therefore, interaction with them remains at the level of tacit cooperation in\naccordance with our legislation.\n\n**DS:** **In early 2020, hacker attacks on the servers of the Ukrainian gas company**\n**Burisma circulated widely, which fed into the “Ukrainian scandal” in the U.S. and the**\n**impeachment of President Donald Trump. What’s your expert opinion on this**\n**situation?**\n\n**SD: Publicly, this scandal began with an article in The New York Times in January of this**\nyear, where journalists of the publication, referring to the report and words of Oren Falkowitz,\nco-founder of the cybersecurity company Area 1 and a former employee of the National\nSecurity Agency, announced a phishing attack that was carried out in relation to the\nsubsidiaries of Burisma Holdings, such as KUB-Gas, Aldea, Esko-Pivnich, Nadragas,\nTehnocom-Service, Pari and the Ukrainian television company Kvartal 95, on New Year’s\nEve.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that these attacks were identified by one of the cybersecurity subjects of\nUkraine. During the analysis of this phishing, it was found out that it was the handiwork of the\nhacker group of the Russian GRU—APT28. We suspect that their main goal was to gain\naccess to the company email and intranet. At the same time, it is still not known whether this\nattack was successful, since no victim showed any desire to make an official statement.\nUkrainian legislation provides for the investigation of such incidents in the private sector only\non the basis of a written request from the victim.\n\nThis attack was not assessed as critical, since similar actions are carried out quite often on\ntheir part, everyone is aware of them and prepared to repel them. And the fact that the\npublication of this information resonated in the American media is due, in my opinion,\nexclusively to the impeachment process against President Trump.\n\n**DS:** **What currently keeps you up at night?**\n\n**SD: Fortunately, I rarely have sleepless nights. This is probably due to the fact that 26 years**\nof service in the police have taught me to take everything calmly and not get worked up. But\nthe situation with COVID-19 certainly concerns me and makes me worry about my relatives\nand friends.\n\n**DS:** **Most experts consider ransomware and ransomware groups to be the most**\n**serious threat in 2020. What do you think about ransomware? How do you fight it?**\n\n**SD: I believe that this phenomenon will remain relevant until such time as people start to**\ntreat cyber hygiene as normal hygiene of their health, until they learn to regularly back up\ncritical information as a matter of fact and store it appropriately, and until they stop paying\ncriminals.\n\nAlso, everyone should understand that most ransomware has already been decrypted. The\nsooner victims report ransomware to the appropriate authorities or companies that are\nengaged in countering it, the sooner new decryptors will be developed and measures taken\nto identify ransomware. Unfortunately, people prefer to pay the ransom instead of contacting\nlaw enforcement agencies through intrusive bureaucracy and the lack of an immediate\nresponse to such appeals.\n\nTherefore, the most effective way to counter ransomware is to systematically inform citizens\nabout the observance of cyber hygiene rules.\n\nEveryone should understand that most ransomware has already been decrypted. The\nsooner victims report ransomware to the appropriate authorities or companies that are\nengaged in countering it, the sooner new decryptors will be developed.”\n\n**DS:** **What will be the most significant cyber threat in 2021? Are you ready to combat**\n**it?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SD: I think there will be several such threats. The first is related to working remotely in**\nconnection with the pandemic. The low level of training of such users has led to the fact that\ncriminals are trying to gain access to corporate resources to steal corporate data. In this\nregard, the amount of phishing developed specifically for these needs will grow. Already\ntoday, we are recording phishing campaigns that are reaching a qualitatively new level of\nphishing using neural networks. And your previous question about the rise of ransomware\nwas related precisely to this.\n\nThe second is related to the military actions that are currently taking place around the world.\nThey are increasingly accompanied by malevolent actions in cyberspace. All this leads to the\ndanger of compromise and destruction of government data, as well as disruption of critical\ninfrastructure facilities. At the same time, more and more often compromised popular\napplication programs will be used for such attacks, as was the case with the NotPetya attack,\nwhen the M.E.Doc accounting program updates were used or other well-known industrial\nattacks using the CCleaner program.\n\nAll cybersecurity entities in our country are ready for these threats and are doing everything\npossible to prevent them at the preparatory stage.\n\n**DS:** **You’ve made an incredible career in international relations and information**\n**security and have become an icon in modern Ukraine for your patriotism. How did you**\n**manage it and what challenges do you face at work?**\n\n**SD: It’s nice to hear such words. But I can evaluate myself and my actions only for myself in**\norder to analyze my goals versus what has been achieved, formulate new ones, and correct\nmistakes. A public assessment should be given by others, especially those who have been\naffected by my actions, regardless of their role and place. As for your question, in my\nopinion, the main thing is to always remain a patriot of your homeland, respect your\nprofession, colleagues, and opponents, and strive to become a professional in your field.\nAnd also to admit your mistakes and never be ashamed to constantly learn. These are the\nbasic principles that made me who I am.\n\nIn law enforcement, I went through all the career stages—from cadet to general, from an\nordinary operative to the head of an independent unit—without bypassing a single one. And\nthis, probably, also played an important role in my formation. In addition, my operational\nexperience gained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the operational development units that\nwere engaged in detecting crimes in the highest echelons of authority helped me a lot.\n\nRegarding challenges, it should be noted that they are a necessity. After all, certain\nchallenges are the engine of growth. I think that here it is necessary to emphasize only the\nmost important elements that slow down the progressive development in the sphere of\nnational cybersecurity—this is the lack of qualified specialists who are ready to work in\ngovernment positions, the lack of understanding among senior officials of government goals\nand problems in the information and cyber spaces. And this applies not only to Ukraine. As a\n\n\n-----\n\nconsequence, there is a lack of appropriate regulatory statutes that would regulate\ninteraction and cooperation between the state and the private sector, especially with foreign\nspecialists and companies. And most importantly the underestimating of cyber threats that\ncan come from both hostile countries and our own citizens, especially from employees of\ncompanies, institutions, and organizations, through their ignorance or negligent approach to\ncyber hygiene.\n\n**DS:** **It is obvious that your experience, connections, and knowledge will be very**\n**valuable in the western labor market in the field of threat intelligence. Tell me a secret**\n**—what are your post-retirement plans?**\n\n**SD: I plan to use my experience to help those guys who are confused and who cannot find a**\nway out of bad situations themselves. After all, I know that many of them are left alone with\nthe problems that arise with law enforcement agencies. There are very few, and in our\ncountry, there are no people or organizations at all that would provide professional\nassistance to such children. For this, I have already received a lawyer’s license and now I\nam looking for like-minded people among my colleagues.\n\nAt the same time, I will pass on my knowledge to the younger generation through\nconsultations, lectures, training. Perhaps I will try to leave something in the book. And of\ncourse, I will continue to learn everything new.\n\nMission-driven and Russian-speaking intelligence analyst with type A personality.
