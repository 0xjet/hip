    "plain_text": "# Treasury Sanctions Iran Cyber Actors for Attempting to Influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0494**\n\nNovember 18, 2021\n\nWashington — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC) designated six Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity pursuant to Executive Order\n(E.O.) 13848, “Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United\nStates Election,” for attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe United States identified attempted cyber-enabled intrusions by state-sponsored actors,\nincluding Iranian actors who sought to sow discord and undermine voters’ faith in the U.S.\nelectoral process. The actors also disseminated disinformation on social media and sent\nthreatening emails as well as a fraudulent video. The fake video was made in an attempt to\nundermine faith in the election by implying that individuals could cast fraudulent ballots.\n\n“Treasury will continue to counter efforts to undermine the integrity of our election systems,”\nsaid Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Today’s action underscores the U.S.\ngovernment’s commitment to hold state-sponsored actors accountable for attempting to\nundermine public confidence in the electoral process and U.S. institutions.”\n\n**Iran’s Efforts to Influence U.S. Elections**\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween approximately August 2020 and November 2020, state-sponsored Iranian cyber\nactors executed an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to\nundermine voter confidence and sow discord, in connection with the 2020 U.S. presidential\nelection. These Iranian actors obtained or attempted to obtain U.S. voter information from\nU.S. state election websites, sent threatening emails to intimidate voters, and crafted and\ndisseminated disinformation pertaining to the election and election security. Furthermore,\nthe Iranians illicitly accessed content management accounts of several online U.S. media\nentities, which resulted in their ability to edit and create fraudulent content. However, the\nactors’ ability to leverage this unauthorized access was ultimately thwarted by the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nLeading this attempted election influence campaign was Iranian cyber company Emennet\n**Pasargad. Emennet was previously designated under its former name, Net Peygard**\nSamavat Company, pursuant to E.O. 13606 in February 2019, for having materially assisted,\nsponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services\nto or in support of, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Electronic Warfare and Cyber\nDefense Organization (IRGC-EWCD). The company rebranded itself to evade U.S.\nsanctions and continue its disruptive cyber operations against the United States. Emmenet\nis being designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for attempting to influence the 2020 U.S.\npresidential election.\n\nEmennet is managed by Iranian national Mohammad Bagher Shirinkar (Shirinkar), whom\nOFAC previously designated pursuant to E.O. 13606 in February 2019 for having materially\nassisted the IRGC-EWCD. Shirinkar is being re-designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for\nattempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAs part of today’s action, OFAC is also designating five additional Iranian nationals who are\npart of Emennet’s network. Emennet employees Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa\n**Kazemi (Kazemi) and Sajjad Kashian (Kashian) are being designated pursuant to E.O.**\n13848 for attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Kazemi and Kashian\nexecuted cyber-enabled operations as part of the campaign to influence the election.\n**Mostafa Sarmadi, Seyyed Mehdi Hashemi Toghroljerdi, and Hosein Akbari Nodeh, who**\nserve on Emennet's Board of Directors, are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for\nacting, or purporting to act, for on behalf of Emennet.\n\n**Emennet Employees Designated Pursuant to E.O. 13848**\n\n\n-----\n\nToday’s designations represent the collective efforts of Treasury, the U.S. Department of\n[State, and the FBI. Concurrent with today’s designations, the U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-enabled-disinformation-and-threat-campaign-designed)\nunsealed a five-count indictment against Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi and\n**Sajjad Kashian. Further, pursuant to the Rewards for Justice Program, the State**\nDepartment is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on or about the activities\nof these two individuals.\n\n**Sanctions Implications**\n\nAs a result of today’s designation, all property and interests in property of the designated\ntargets that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally\nprohibited from engaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or\nmore owned by one or more designated persons are also blocked. In addition, financial\ninstitutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the\nsanctioned entity and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an\nenforcement action.\n\n[More information on the individuals and entity designated today.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211118)\n\n###\n\nUse featured image\n\nOff\n\n\n-----",
