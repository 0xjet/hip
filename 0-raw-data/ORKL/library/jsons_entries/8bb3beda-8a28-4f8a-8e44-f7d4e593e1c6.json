    "plain_text": "**December 14, 2017 | by Blake Johnson, Dan Caban, Marina Krotofil, Dan Scali, Nathan Brubaker,**\n**Christopher Glyer**\n\n**Mandiant recently responded to an incident at a critical infrastructure organization where an attacker**\n\n**deployed malware designed to manipulate industrial safety systems. The targeted systems provided**\n\n**emergency shutdown capability for industrial processes. We assess with moderate confidence that the**\n\n**attacker was developing the capability to cause physical damage and inadvertently shutdown operations. This**\n\n**malware, which we call TRITON, is an attack framework built to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented**\n\n**System (SIS) controllers. We have not attributed the incident to a threat actor, though we believe the activity**\n\n**is consistent with a nation state preparing for an attack.**\n\n**TRITON is one of a limited number of publicly identified malicious software families targeted at** **industrial**\n\n**control systems (ICS). It follows Stuxnet which was used against Iran in 2010 and Industroyer which we**\n\n**believe was deployed by Sandworm Team against Ukraine in 2016. TRITON is consistent with these attacks,**\n\n**in that it could prevent safety mechanisms from executing their intended function, resulting in a physical**\n\n**consequence.**\n\n**Malware**\n**Main Modules** **Description**\n**Family**\n\n**Main executable leveraging**\n**trilog.exe**\n**libraries.zip**\n\n**TRITON**\n\n**Custom communication library**\n\n**library.zip** **for interaction with Triconex**\n\n**controllers.**\n\n**Table 1: Description of TRITON Malware**\n\n**The attacker gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation and deployed the TRITON attack**\n**framework to reprogram the SIS controllers.

The targeting of critical infrastructure as well as the**\n**attacker’s persistence, lack of any clear monetary goal and the technical resources necessary to create the**\n\n**attack framework suggest a well-resourced nation state actor. Specifically, the following facts support this**\n**assessment:**\n\n**The attacker targeted the SIS suggesting an interest in causing a high-impact attack with physical**\n**consequences. This is an attack objective not typically seen from cyber-crime groups.**\n\n**The attacker deployed TRITON shortly after gaining access to the SIS system, indicating that they had pre-**\n**built and tested the tool which would require access to hardware and software that is not widely available.**\n\n**TRITON is also designed to communicate using the proprietary TriStation protocol which is not publicly**\n**documented suggesting the adversary independently reverse engineered this protocol.**\n\n**The targeting of critical infrastructure to disrupt, degrade, or destroy systems is consistent with numerous**\n**attack and reconnaissance activities carried out globally by Russian, Iranian, North Korean, U.S., and Israeli**\n\n**nation state actors. Intrusions of this nature do not necessarily indicate an immediate intent to disrupt targeted**\n\n**systems, and may be preparation for a contingency.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: ICS Reference Architecture**\n\n**Modern industrial process control and automation systems rely on a variety of sophisticated control systems**\n**and safety functions. These systems and functions are often referred to as Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**\n\n**or Operational Technology (OT).**\n\n**A Distributed Control System (DCS) provides human operators with the ability to remotely monitor and control**\n**an industrial process. It is a computerized control system consisting of computers, software applications and**\n**controllers. An Engineering Workstation is a computer used for configuration, maintenance and diagnostics of**\n\n**the control system applications and other control system equipment.**\n\n**A SIS is an autonomous control system that independently monitors the status of the process under control. If**\n**the process exceeds the parameters that define a hazardous state, the SIS attempts to bring the process**\n**back into a safe state or automatically performs a safe shutdown of the process. If the SIS and DCS controls**\n\n**fail, the final line of defense is the design of the industrial facility, which includes mechanical protections on**\n**equipment (e.g. rupture discs), physical alarms, emergency response procedures and other mechanisms to**\n**mitigate dangerous situations.**\n\n**Asset owners employ varied approaches to interface their plant's DCS with the SIS. The traditional approach**\n\n**relies on the principles of segregation for both communication infrastructures and control strategies. For at**\n**l** **t th** **t d** **d** **th** **h** **b** **t** **d t** **d i t** **ti** **DCS** **d SIS d** **i** **f** **i**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SIS. We believe TRITON acutely demonstrates the risk associated with integrated designs that allow bi-**\n**directional communication between DCS and SIS network hosts.**\n\n**Figure 2: Temporal Relationship Between Cyber Security and Safety**\n\n**The attack lifecycle for disruptive attacks against ICS is similar to other types of cyber attacks, with a few key**\n\n**distinctions. First, the attacker’s mission is to disrupt an operational process rather than steal data. Second,**\n**the attacker must have performed OT reconnaissance and have sufficient specialized engineering knowledge**\n**to understand the industrial process being controlled and successfully manipulate it.**\n\n**Figure 2 represents the relationship between cyber security and safety controls in a process control**\n\n**environment. Even if cyber security measures fail, safety controls are designed to prevent physical damage.**\n**To maximize physical impact, a cyber attacker would also need to bypass safety controls.**\n\n**The SIS threat model below highlights some of the options available to an attacker who has successfully**\n**compromised an SIS.**\n\n**_Attack Option 1: Use the SIS to shutdown the process_**\n\n**The attacker can reprogram the SIS logic to cause it to trip and shutdown a process that is, in actuality,**\n**in a safe state. In other words, trigger a false positive.**\n\n**Implication: Financial losses due to process downtime and complex plant start up procedure after the**\n\n**shutdown.**\n\n**_Attack Option 2: Reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state_**\n\n**The attacker can reprogram the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist.**\n**Implication: Increased risk that a hazardous situation will cause physical consequences (e.g. impact to**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_or hazard_**\n\n**The attacker can manipulate the process into an unsafe state from the DCS while preventing the SIS**\n**from functioning appropriately.**\n\n**Implication: Impact to human safety, the environment, or damage to equipment, the extent of which**\n**depends on the physical constraints of the process and the plant design.**\n\n**We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker’s long-term objective was to develop the capability to**\n**cause a physical consequence. We base this on the fact that the attacker initially obtained a reliable foothold**\n**on the DCS and could have developed the capability to manipulate the process or shutdown the plant, but**\n\n**instead proceeded to compromise the SIS system. Compromising both the DCS and SIS system would enable**\n**the attacker to develop and carry out an attack that causes the maximum amount of damage allowed by the**\n**physical and mechanical safeguards in place.**\n\n**Once on the SIS network, the attacker used their pre-built TRITON attack framework to interact with the SIS**\n\n**controllers using the TriStation protocol. The attacker could have caused a process shutdown by issuing a**\n**halt command or intentionally uploading flawed code to the SIS controller to cause it to fail. Instead, the**\n**attacker made several attempts over a period of time to develop and deliver functioning control logic for the**\n**SIS controllers in this target environment. While these attempts appear to have failed due one of the attack**\n\n**scripts’ conditional checks, the attacker persisted with their efforts. This suggests the attacker was intent on**\n**causing a specific outcome beyond a process shutdown.**\n\n**Of note, on several occasions, we have observed evidence of long term intrusions into ICS which were not**\n\n**ultimately used to disrupt or disable operations. For instance, Russian operators, such as Sandworm Team,**\n**have compromised Western ICS over a multi-year period without causing a disruption.**\n\n**The TRITON attack tool was built with a number of features, including the ability to read and write programs,**\n**read and write individual functions and query the state of the SIS controller. However, only some of these**\n**capabilities were leveraged in the trilog.exe sample (e.g. the attacker did not leverage all of TRITON’s**\n**extensive reconnaissance capabilities).**\n\n**The TRITON malware contained the capability to communicate with Triconex SIS controllers (e.g. send**\n**specific commands such as halt or read its memory content) and remotely reprogram them with an attacker-**\n**defined payload. The TRITON sample Mandiant analyzed added an attacker-provided program to the**\n**execution table of the Triconex controller. This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the**\n\n**controller to continue operating without a fault or exception. If the controller failed, TRITON would attempt to**\n**return it to a running state. If the controller did not recover within a defined time window, this sample would**\n**overwrite the malicious program with invalid data to cover its tracks.**\n\n**Asset owners who wish to defend against the capabilities demonstrated in the incident, should consider the**\n**following controls:**\n\n**Where technically feasible, segregate safety system networks from process control and information**\n**system networks. Engineering workstations capable of programming SIS controllers should not be dual-**\n\n\n-----\n\n**These usually take the form of switches controlled by a physical key. On Triconex controllers, keys should**\n**not be left in the PROGRAM mode other than during scheduled programming events.**\n**Implement change management procedures for changes to key position. Audit current key state regularly.**\n\n**Use a unidirectional gateway rather than bidirectional network connections for any applications that**\n**depend on the data provided by the SIS.**\n**Implement strict access control and application whitelisting on any server or workstation endpoints that**\n**can reach the SIS system over TCP/IP.**\n\n**Monitor ICS network traffic for unexpected communication flows and other anomalous activity.**\n\n**[Figure 3: Triconex Key Switch ( source)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jr93jKzML._SX466_.jpg)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The malware was named to masquerade as the legitimate Triconex Trilog application. This application is used**\n**for reviewing logs and is a part of the TriStation application suite. The malware was delivered as a Py2EXE**\n\n**compiled python script dependent on a zip file containing standard Python libraries, open source libraries, as**\n**well as the attacker-developed Triconex attack framework for interacting with the Triconex controllers. Along**\n**with the executable, two binary files, inject.bin (malicious function code) and imain.bin (malicious control**\n**_logic), were deployed as the controller’s payload. These file names were hard coded in the Py2EXE compiled_**\n**python script.**\n\n**Trilog.exe took one option from the command line, which was a single IP address of the target Triconex**\n**device. It did not leverage the underlying TRITON library’s capability for Triconex device discovery, instead an**\n**instance of trilog.exe had to be invoked separately for each target controller in the environment. Once**\n\n**invoked, trilog.exe checked the status of the controller, then read the configuration information exposed by the**\n**TriStation protocol. If the controller was in a running state, trilog.exe encoded the two payload files inject.bin**\n**and imain.bin and passed them to the communication libraries to be appended to the controller’s program**\n**memory and execution table.**\n\n**After payload files were inserted into memory on the Triconex controller, the script initiated a countdown,**\n**periodically checking the status of the controller. If an error was detected, the communication library’s method**\n**_SafeAppendProgramMod attempted to reset the controller to the previous state using a TriStation protocol_**\n\n**command. If this failed, trilog.exe attempted to write a small ‘dummy’ program to memory. We assess that this**\n**was an anti-forensics technique to hide the presence of the attacker code on the Triconex controller.**\n\n**Working with the asset owner, Mandiant ran trilog.exe in a lab environment with a valid Triconex controller**\n**and discovered a conditional check in the malware that prevented the payload binary from persisting in the**\n**environment. Mandiant confirmed that, after correcting patching the attack script to remove this check, the**\n**payload binary would persist in controller memory, and the controller would continue to run.**\n\n**TRITON implements the TriStation protocol, which is the protocol used by the legitimate TriStation application,**\n\n**to configure controllers.**\n\n**_TsHi_** **is the high-level interface created by the malware’s authors that allows the threat actor’s operators to**\n**implement attack scripts using the TRITON framework. It exposes functions for both reconnaissance and**\n**attack. The functions generally accept binary data from the user, and handle the code ‘signing’ and check**\n**sums prior to passing the data to lower level libraries for serialization on to the network.**\n\n**_TsBase, another attacker-written module,_** **contains the functions called by TsHi, which translate the attacker’s**\n**intended action to the appropriate TriStation protocol function code. For certain functions, it also packs and**\n**pads the data in to the appropriate format.**\n\n**_TsLow is an additional attacker module that implements the TriStation UDP wire protocol. The_** **_TsBase library_**\n**primarily depends on the ts_exec method. This method takes the function code and expected response code,**\n**and serializes the commands payload over UDP. It checks the response from the controller against the**\n**expected value and returns a result data structure indicating success or a False object representing failure.**\n\n**_TsLow also exposes the connect method used to check connectivity to the target controller. If invoked with no_**\n**targets, it runs the device discovery function detect_ip. This leverages a \"ping\" message over the TriStation**\n**protocol using IP broadcast to find controllers that are reachable via a router from where the script is invoked.**\n\n\n-----\n\n|trilog.exe|MD5: 6c39c3f4a08d3d78f2eb973a94bd7718 SHA-256: e8542c07b2af63ee7e72ce5d97d91036c5da56e2b091aa2afe737b224305d230|\n|---|---|\n|imain.bin|MD5:
