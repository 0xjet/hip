Our investigation shows how the provider Void\nGriffon has been integral to the activities of a number of high-profile gangs.\n\nOne of the basic requirements to keeping a cybercriminal operation running smoothly,\ncovertly, and for a prolonged period is a reliable web hosting service that can withstand\nabuse complaints and law enforcement takedown requests. These bulletproof hosting\nservices are essentially cybercriminal hideouts for lease, designed specifically to give threat\nactors stable servers where they can store malicious files or even the malware necessary for\ntheir operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nVoid Griffon is our name for a provider that has been active since 2006. Its service has been\nused for multiple years by some of today's top-tier advanced persistent threat (APT) groups\nand malware distributors.\n\nTrend Micro uses cybercriminals’ dependence on such infrastructure against them, tracking\nand proactively blocking such service providers to protect customers early in the attack\nchain. The short video series below tells you all you need to know about these bulletproof\nhosting service providers.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Digging into Void Griffon\n\nOur investigation into one specific bulletproof hosting provider, which we track as Void\nGriffon, shows the exact services available, and how bulletproof hosting businesses support\nlong-running cybercriminal operations.\n\nVoid Griffon is a malicious actor group that we have been aware of since 2006. The group\nhas had different aliases over the years and has advertised a slew of services in\nunderground forums. It first offered its fast-flux bulletproof hosting service in 2015, and its\nbusiness has since flourished. We have found that Void Griffon has been used by different\nAPT groups and has also hosted many prominent malware families.\n\n### Services offered by Void Griffon\n\nHosting\n\n\n-----\n\nDedicated servers\n\n\n-----\n\nNode-based FastFlux, a shifting network for botnets\n\n\n-----\n\nVirtual private servers (VPSs)\n\n\n-----\n\nVirtual dedicated servers (VDSs)\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain name registration\n\n\n-----\n\nAPI access\n\nWe can link the longevity and success of campaigns that use the malware families listed in\nFigure 1 to the affordable and stable hosting services made available by providers like Void\nGriffon. It is clear from the high-profile families on the list and the number of days they have\nbeen hosted on Void Griffon that the service has a good reputation. It is an important\nelement that allows many cybercriminal operations to keep running smoothly.\n\nGandcrab\n\n401\n\nRazy\n\n426\n\nRedline Stealer\n\n610\n\n\n-----\n\nRacoonStealer\n\n646\n\nKPOT Stealer\n\n663\n\nNegasteal\n\n691\n\nPowload\n\n727\n\nAzorult\n\n743\n\nTinyNuke Bot\n\n863\n\nClipBanker\n\n873\n\nMatrix\n\n887\n\nSTOP Ransomware\n\n935\n\nRamnit\n\n1,029\n\nVidar\n\n1,033\n\nDridex\n\n1,064\n\nSmoke Loader\n\n\n-----\n\n1,066\n\nLokibot\n\n1,198\n\nFareit\n\n1,246\n\nHancitor\n\n1,442\n\nUrsnif\n\n1,729\n\nFigure 1.

Analyzing these systems by proactively locating and\n[blocking the bulletproof hosting infrastructure will aid defenders in blocking attacks in the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/no/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/inside-the-bulletproof-hosting-business-cybercrime-methods-opsec)\nearly stages of the kill chain.\n\nHowever, this is difficult for a network defender to do on their own. Trend Micro’s threat\nintelligence allows us to do this on behalf of our customers and provide this protection\ndirectly in our products.\n\nWe hope to bring more attention to the support pillars that allow cybercriminal campaigns to\noperate, and what can be done to counteract them.
