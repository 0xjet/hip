In order to infect the victims,\n\nthe attackers distributed spear-phishing email, which purports to have been sent from NIC’s Incident response\n\nteam, the attackers spoofed an email id that is associated with Indian Ministry of Defence to send out email to the\n\nvictims. Attackers also used the name of the top NIC official in the signature of the email, this is to make it look like\n\nthe email was sent by a high ranking Government official working at NIC (National Informatics Centre).\n\n**Overview of the Malicious Email**\n\nThe attackers spoofed an email id that associated with Indian Ministry of Defence to send out emails to the\n\nvictims. The email was made to look like it was sent from NIC’s Incident response team instructing the recipients\n\nto read the attached documents and to implement the cyber security plan and the signature of the email included\n\n\n-----\n\n[might have downloaded from (http://meity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/Plan_Report_on_Cyber_Security.pdf).](http://meity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/Plan_Report_on_Cyber_Security.pdf)\n\nThe word document attached in the email contained malicious macro code which when enabled, drops a malware\n\nbackdoor, executes it and then sends the system information to the command and control server (C2 Server) and\n\nits also downloads additional components.\n\nFrom the email (and the attachments shown in the below screenshot) it looks like the goal of the attackers was to\n\ninfect and take control of the systems of Cyber Security officers who are responsible for managing and\n\nimplementing security controls on the Government network.\n\nThe email header consisted of ORCPT (Original-Recipient) header, which had reference to what appears to be a\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis of Word Document Containing Malicious Macro Code**\n\nOnce the victim opens the attached word document it prompts the user to enable macro as shown below and the\n\ndocument also contains instruction on how to enable the macros.\n\n\n-----\n\nshows a decoy document containing the instructions and guidelines related to cyber security. This is to make the\n\nuser believe that is it indeed a document related to cyber security. Below are some of the screen shots showing\n\nthe document that will shown to the user once the macro is enabled.\n\n\n-----\n\nobfuscated (uses obscure variable/function names to make analysis harder) as shown below.\n\nThe macro code first calls multiple functions to decode the executable content and then it drops the malicious\n\nexecutable (WINWORD.exe) in the Startup directory and then executes the dropped file as shown in the below\n\nscreen shots.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOnce the dropped file is executed by macro code it connects to the command and control server(c2 server) and\n\nto conceal the data sent by the malware, it communicates on port 443 (https) as shown below. The network traffic\n\npattern will be discussed in detail later.\n\n**Analysis of the Dropped Executable (WINWORD exe)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section contains the behavioral analysis of the dropped executable (WINWORD.exe).\n\nThe malware when executed creates additional files on the file system, It downloads these files by contacting the\n\nC2 server and saves it on the disk. Since the malware was not allowed to contact the C2 server its not clear about\n\nthe functionality of these files. The below screen shots show WINWORD.exe creating an exectuable, VB script and\n\nVBE files. The malware uses WScript.exe to execute the VB scripts.\n\nAs mentioned above, malware once executed makes an https connection to the C2 server as shown below.\n\n**C2 Communication Pattern**\n\n\n-----\n\nconnection was intercepted and different network communications were determined.\n\nIn the first communication it collects and sends the system information of the infected system to the attacker in\n\nthe user-agent field. The user-agent field contains information about the computer name, username and if the\n\nAntiVirus software is installed or not. The malware sends some information in the post data as well, the post data\n\ngives the information about the action that malware will perform. In the below screen shot notice the system\n\ninformation sent in the user-agent field and also from the post data it can be deduced that the malware\n\ndownloads an exe file.\n\nMalware uses similar network communication pattern to download additional files (vbs, vbe, cmd, sc, ext, a3x etc).\n\nOnce downloaded these files are saved in either “%LocalAppData%\\Temp\\WindowsUpdates” folder or in\n\n“%Temp%\\WindowsUpdates” folder. During analysis it was determined that the malware used these filenames\n\n(MS015-0012.exe, MS015-0012.vbs, MS015-0012.vbe etc.) to reside in these directories. Below screen shots shows\n\nsome of the network communication made by the malware to download files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C2 Domain Information**\n\nThis section contains details of the C2 domain (webmail[.]duia[.]in). Attackers used the DynamicDNS hostname\n\n(duia is a Dynamic DNS provider) to host the C2 server, this allows the attacker to quickly change the IP address in\n\nreal time if the malware C2 server infrastructure is unavailable. The C2 domain currently resolves to an IP address\n\nshown below and the same domain was associated with another IP address previously. Both the IP addresses are\n\nassociated with hosting providers as shown in the screen shot below\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators Of Compromise**\n\n\n-----\n\nPrivate organizations) to detect and investigate this attack campaign.\n\n**_Dropped Malware Sample:_**\n\n_4dc28faeb77550174b936d9ba97d4679 (WINWORD.exe)_\n\n**_Network Indicators Associated with C2:_**\n\n_webmail[.]duia[.]in_\n\n_hxxps://webmail[.]duia[.]in/webmail.php_\n\n_95[.]23[.]26[.]28_\n\n_185[.]100[.]86[.]174_\n\n**_Host Indicators:_**\n\n_Filenames in the “%Temp%\\WindowsUpdates” folder: MS015-0012.exe, MS015-0012.vbs, MS015-0012.vbe_\n\n_Filename WINWORD.exe in the Startup directory_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAttackers in this case made every attempt to launch a clever attack campaign by spoofing email address of\n\nMinistry of Defence, they also tried to trick the users to believe the email was sent from NIC’s incident response\n\nteam. To make the attack less suspicious they also used a legitimate PDF document in the attachment and used\n\nthe name of the top NIC offical in the email signature. The attackers also hosted the C2 server in a Dynamic DNS\n\nprovider network. We believe that such attacker groups are likely working to gain long-term access into Indian\n\nGovernment networks. With India rapidly moving towards digitization and cashless transactions we believe that\n\n\n-----\n\nNIC s Incident response team.\n\n[Follow us on Twitter: @monnappa22](https://twitter.com/monnappa22) [@cysinfo22](https://twitter.com/cysinfo22)\n\n\n**SHARE:**\n\n\n[](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/)\n\n\n#### MONNAPPA K A\n\n[](https://twitter.com/monnappa22)\n\n\n#### 6 COMMENTS\n\n**me**\n\n**November 30, 2016 at 6:29 pm**\n\n\n**[Reply](https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/?replytocom=150#respond)**\n\n\nHi MONNAPPA, nice post. Need a clarification in this regard. duia.in[duia.CC code ] is a DYNDNS facility.

Kudos to you for your commendable malware analysis\n\ntechniques and for the publish of this article\n\n\n**divyanshu**\n\n**December 2, 2016 at 9:39 am**\n\nAwesome Research .. It shows how vulnerable the machinery is and creates a demand for a very good cyber\n\nsecurity awareness campaign!!\n\nregards,\n\nDivyanshu\n\n**ateesh rajak**\n\n**December 3, 2016 at 1:48 pm**\n\nnyc writeup\n\n**Ramit**\n\n**December 7, 2016 at 3:35 pm**\n\n\n**[Reply](https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/?replytocom=155#respond)**\n\n\n**[Reply](https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/?replytocom=156#respond)**\n\n\n**[Reply](https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/?replytocom=160#respond)**\n\n\nIf the malware identifies AV running in the host machine is there any change in its behaviour and communication\n\nto C&C? As most of the end points in any private or govt. organisation is likely to run AV(hopefully)!\n\n\n-----\n\nComment\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nE-mail (required)\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n**POST COMMENT**\n\n\n**Copyright © 2016 Cysinfo.com.
