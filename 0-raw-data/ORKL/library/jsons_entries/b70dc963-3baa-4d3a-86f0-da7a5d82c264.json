This SMB Worm Tool is equipped with a Listening Implant, Lightweight Backdoor, Proxy Tool,\nDestructive Hard Drive Tool, and Destructive Target Cleaning Tool.\n\nSMB Worm Tool: This worm uses a brute force authentication attack to propagate via Windows SMB shares. It connects home every five minutes to send log data\nback to command and control (C2) infrastructure if it has successfully spread to other Windows hosts via SMB port 445. The tool also accepts new scan tasking\nwhen it connects to C2. There are two main threads: the first thread calls home and sends back logs (a list of successful SMB exploitations), and the second thread\nattempts to guess passwords for SMB connections. If the password is correctly guessed, a file share is established and file is copied and run on the newly-infected\nhost.\n\nListening Implant: During installation of this tool, a portion of the binaries is decrypted using AES, with a key derived from the phrase \"National Football League.\"\nAdditionally, this implant listens for connections on TCP port 195 (for \"sensvc.exe\" and \"msensvc.exe\") and TCP port 444 (for \"netcfg.dll\"). Each message sent to\nand from this implant is preceded with its length, then XOR encoded with the byte 0x1F. Upon initial connection, the victim sends the string, \"HTTP/1.1 GET /dns?\n\\x00.\" The controller then responds with the string \"200 www.yahoo.com!\\x00\" (for \"sensvc.exe\" and \"msensvc.exe\") or with the string \"RESPONSE 200 OK!!\" (for\n\"netcfg.dll\"). The controller sends the byte \"!\" (0x21) to end the network connection. This special message is not preceded with a length or XOR encoded.\n\nLightweight Backdoor: This is a backdoor listener that is designed as a service DLL. It includes functionality such as file transfer, system survey, process\nmanipulation, file time matching and proxy capability. The listener can also perform arbitrary code execution and execute commands on the command line. This\ntool includes functionality to open ports in a victim host's firewall and take advantage of universal Plug and Play (UPNP) mechanisms to discover routers and\ngateway devices, and add port mappings, allowing inbound connections to victim hosts on Network Address Translated (NAT) private networks. There are no\ncallback domains associated with this malware since connections are inbound only on a specified port number.\n\nProxy Tool: Implants in this malware family are typically loaded via a dropper installed as a service, then configured to listen on TCP port 443. The implant may\nhave an associated configuration file which can contain a configurable port. This proxy tool has basic backdoor functionality, including the ability to fingerprint the\nvictim machine, run remote commands, perform directory listings, perform process listings, and transfer files.\n\nDestructive Hard Drive Tool: This tool is a tailored hard-drive wiping tool that is intended to destroy data past the point of recovery and to complicate the victim\nmachine’s recovery. If the CNE operator has administrator-level privileges on the host, the program will over-write portions of up-to the first four physical drives\nattached, and over-write the master boot record (MBR) with a program designed to cause further damage if the hard drive is re-booted. This further results in the\nvictim machine being non-operational with irrecoverable data (There is a caveat for machines installed with the windows 7 operating system: windows 7 machines\nwill continue to operate in a degraded state with the targeted files destroyed until after reboot, in which the infected MBR then wipes the drive.) If the actor has\nuser-level access, the result includes specific files being deleted and practically irrecoverable, but the victim machine would remain usable.\n\nDestructive Target Cleaning Tool: This tool renders victim machines inoperable by overwriting the Master Boot Record. The tool is dropped and installed by another\nexecutable and consists of three parts: an executable and a dll which contain the destructive components, and an encoded command file that contains the actual\ndestruction commands to be executed.\n\nNetwork Propagation Wiper: The malware has the ability to propagate throughout the target network via built-in Windows shares. Based on the\nusername/password provided in the configuration file and the hostname/IP address of target systems, the malware will access remote network shares in order to\nupload a copy of the wiper and begin the wiping process on these remote systems. The malware uses several methods to access shares on the remote systems to\nbegin wiping files. Checking for existing shares via “\\\\hostname\\admin$\\system32” and “\\\\hostname\\shared$\\system32” or create a new share “cmd.exe /q /c net\nshare shared$=%SystemRoot% /GRANT:everyone, FULL”. Once successful, the malware uploads a copy of the wiper file “taskhostXX.exe”, changes the file-time\nto match that of the built-in file “calc.exe”, and starts the remote process. The remote process is started via the command “cmd.exe /c wmic.exe /node:hostname\n/user:username /password:pass PROCESS CALL CREATE”. Hostname, username, and password are then obtained from the configuration file. Afterwards, the\nremote network share is removed via “cmd.exe /q /c net share shared$ /delete”. Once the wiper has been uploaded, the malware reports its status back to one of\nthe four C2 IP addresses.\n\nTechnical and strategic mitigation recommendations are included in the Solution section below.\n\n[US-CERT recommends reviewing the Security Tip Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003)\n\n### Description\n\nCyber threat actors are using an SMB worm to conduct cyber exploitation activities. This tool contains five components – a listening implant, lightweight backdoor,\nproxy tool, destructive hard drive tool, and destructive target cleaning tool.\n\nThe SMB worm propagates throughout an infected network via brute-force authentication attacks, and connects to a C2 infrastructure.\n\n### Impact\n\nDue to the highly destructive functionality of this malware, an organization infected could experience operational impacts including loss of intellectual property and\ndisruption of critical systems.\n\n### Solution\n\nUsers and administrators are recommended to take the following preventive measures to protect their computer networks:\n\nUse and maintain anti-virus software – Anti-virus software recognizes and protects your computer against most known viruses. It is important to keep your\nanti-virus software up-to-date (see Understanding Anti-Virus Software for more information).\n\nKeep your operating system and application software up-to-date – Install software patches so that attackers can't take advantage of known problems or\nvulnerabilities. Many operating systems offer automatic updates. If this option is available, you should enable it (see Understanding Patches for more\ninformation).\n\n[Review Security Tip Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003 and evaluate their capabilities encompassing planning, preparation, detection, and response](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003)\nfor such an event.\n\nReview Recommended Practices for Control Systems, and Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies (pdf).\n\nThe following is a list of the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that can be added to network security solutions to determine whether they are present on a network.\n\n**MD5s:**\n\n\n-----\n\nCharacterization: File Hash Watchlist\n\nNotes: \"SMB worm tool\"\n\nEarliest PE compile Time: 20141001T072107Z\n\nMost

“diskpartmg16.exe”. This file serves as a dropper. It drops destructive malware: “igfxtrayex.exe”.\nWhen the dropper file was executed, it started a second instance of itself with “-i” as an argument, and then terminated. The second instance of the dropper file\ninstalled itself as the “WinsSchMgmt” service with “-k” as a command line argument, started the service, and then terminated. The “WinsSchMgmt” service\nexecuted the file with “-k” as an argument, which started another instance of the file using “-s” as an argument. The “-s” instance dropped and executed\n“igfxtrayex.exe”, created “net_ver.dat”, and began generating network traffic over TCP ports 445 and 139 to victim IP addresses.\n\nName: net_ver.dat\n\nSize: 4572 bytes (4.6 KB) (size will vary)\n\nMD5: 93BC819011B2B3DA8487F964F29EB934 (hash will vary)\n\nThis is a log file created by the dropper, and appended to as the scans progress It contains what appear to be hostnames, IP addresses, and the number 2.\nEntries in the file have the structure “HOSTNAME | IP Address | 2”.\n\n\n-----\n\nPE Compile Time: 2014-11-24 04:11:08\n\nThis file is destructive malware: a disk wiper with network beacon capabilities. If “igfxtrayex.exe” is run with no parameters, it creates and starts a copy of itself with\nthe “–i” argument. After 10 minutes, the “igfxtrayex.exe” makes three copies of itself and places them in the same directory from which it was executed. These\ncopies are named according to the format “taskhostXX.exe” (where X is a randomly generated ASCII character). These copies are then executed, each with a\ndifferent argument (one being “-m”, one being “-d” and the other “-w”). Network connection attempts are made to one of three hard-coded IP addresses in a random\norder to port 8080 or 8000. If a connection to the IP address cannot be made, it attempts to connect to another of the three IP addresses, until connections to all\nthree IP addresses have been attempted. The following command-line string is then executed: “cmd.exe /c net stop MSExchangeIS /y”.

Actual impact to organizations may vary depending on the type and number of systems impacted.\n\n**Tactical Mitigations**\n\nImplement the indicators of compromise within your systems for detection and mitigation purposes.\n\nEncourage users to transfer critical files to network shares, to allow for central backed up.\n\nExecute daily backups of all critical systems.\n\nPeriodically execute an “offline” backup of critical files to removable media.\n\nEstablish emergency communications plans should network resources become unavailable.\n\nI l t iti l t k (i l di ti t k ) f b i t\n\n\n-----\n\nDisable credential caching for all desktop devices with particular importance on critical systems such as servers and restrict the number of cached credential\nfor all portable devices to no more than three if possible. This can be accomplished through a Group Policy Object (GPO).\n\nDisable AutoRun and Autoplay for any removable media device.\n\nPrevent or limit the use of all removable media devices on systems to limit the spread or introduction of malicious software and possible exfiltration data,\nexcept where there is a valid business case for use. This business case must be approved by the organization Chief IT Security Officer, with policy/guidance\non how such media should be used.\n\nConsider restricting account privileges. It is our recommendation that all daily operations should be executed using standard user accounts unless\nadministrative privileges are required for that specific function. Configure all standard user accounts to prevent the execution and installation of any unknown\nor unauthorized software. Both standard and administrative accounts should have access only to services required for nominal daily duties, enforcing the\nconcept of separation of duties. Lastly, disable Web and email capabilities on administrative accounts. Compromise of admin accounts is one vector that\nallows malicious activity to become truly persistent in a network environment.\n\nEnsure that password policy rules are enforced and Admin password values are changed periodically.\n\nConsider prohibiting hosts within the production environment or DMZ from sharing an Active Directory enterprise with hosts on other networks. Each\nenvironment should have separate forests within Active Directory, with no trust relationships allowed between the forests if at all possible. If necessary, the\ntrust relationships should be one-way with the low integrity environment trusting the higher integrity environment.\n\nConsider deployment of a coaching page with click through acceptance; these are traditionally deployed in an environment to log the acceptance of network\nacceptable use policy or to notify users of monitoring. Coaching pages also provide some measure of protection from automated malicious activity. This\noccurs because automated malware is normally incapable of physically clicking an acceptance radial button. Automated malware is traditionally hardcoded to\nexecute, then retrieve commands or additional executables from the Internet. If the malware is unable to initiate an active connection, the full train of infection\nis potentially halted. The danger still exists that the physical user will authorize access, but through the use of coaching pages, infections can be limited or at\nleast the rate of infection reduced.\n\nMonitor logs -- Maintain and actively monitor a centralized logging solution that keeps track of all anomalous and potentially malicious activity.\n\nEnsure that all network operating systems, web browsers, and other related network hardware and software remain updated with all current patches and\nfixes.\n\n**Strategic Mitigations**\n\n[Organizations should review Security Tip Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003 and evaluate their capabilities encompassing planning, preparation,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003)\ndetection, and response for such an event.\n\nAlways keep your patch levels up to date, especially on computers that host public services accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and\nDNS services.\n\nBuild host systems, especially critical systems such as servers, with only essential applications and components required to perform the intended function.\nAny unused applications or functions should be removed or disabled, if possible, to limit the attack surface of the host.\n\nImplement network segmentation through V-LANs to limit the spread of malware.\n\nConsider the deployment of Software Restriction Policy set to only allow the execution of approved software (application whitelisting)\n\nRecommend the whitelisting of legitimate executable directories to prevent the execution of potentially malicious binaries.\n\nConsider the use of two-factor authentication methods for accessing privileged root level accounts or systems.\n\nConsider deploying a two-factor authentication through a hardened IPsec/VPN gateway with split-tunneling prohibited for secure remote access.\n\nDeny direct Internet access, except through the use of proxies for Enterprise servers and workstations. Perform regular content filtering at the proxies or\nexternal firewall points of presence. Also consider the deployment of an explicit versus transparent proxy policy.\n\nImplement a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) inspection capability to inspect both ingress and egress encrypted network traffic for potential malicious activity.\n\nIsolate network services, such as email and Web application servers by utilizing a secure multi-tenant virtualization technology. This will limit the damage\nsustained from a compromise or attack of a single network component.\n\nImplement best practice guidance and policy to restrict the use of non-Foundation assets for processing or accessing Foundation-controlled data or systems\n(e.g., working from home, or using a personal device while at the office). It is difficult to enforce corporate policies, detect intrusions, and conduct forensic\nanalysis or remediate compromises on non-corporate owned devices.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet.\n\nPlace control system networks behind firewalls, and isolate or air gap them from the business network.\n\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected\ndevices.\n\nIndustrial Control System (ICS)-CERT and US-CERT remind organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive\nmeasures.\n\n### References\n\nN/A\n\n### Revisions\n\nDecember 19, 2014: Initial Release\n\n**[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification)**\n\n\n-----",
