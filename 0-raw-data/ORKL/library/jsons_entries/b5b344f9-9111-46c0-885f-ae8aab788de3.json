It is important to note that if you are infected with\nthis ransomware, you are not infected with the Lukitus Ransomware, as some sites may call\nit. You are instead infected by Locky, which is using the .lukitus extension. There is a\ndifference.\n\nAccording to Derek Knight, this variant is currently being distributed via spam emails that\nhave subject lines of < No Subject > or Emailing - CSI**034183_MB_S_7727518b6bab2, which contain zip or rar attachments with JS files.**\nWhen these JS files are executed, they will download the Locky executable from a remote\nsite.\n\n**Spam Email**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the file is downloaded and executed, it will scan the computer for files and encrypt\nthem. When this Locky variant encrypts a file it will modify the file name and then append\nthe .lukitus. When renaming the file, it uses the format\n\n**[first_8_hexadecimal_chars_of_id]-[next_4_hexadecimal_chars_of_id]-**\n\n**[next_4_hexadecimal_chars_of_id]-[4_hexadecimal_chars]-**\n\n**[12_hexadecimal_chars].lukitus.**\n\nThis means that a file named 1.png would be encrypted and named something like as\n**E87091F1-D24A-922B-00F6B112-72BB7EA6EADF.lukitus.**\n\n**Files encrypted with the Lukitus Locky Ransomware Variant**\n\nWhen Locky has finished encrypting the computer, it will remove the downloaded executable\nand then display a ransom note that provides information on how to pay the ransom. The\nnames of these ransom notes have changed for this version to lukitus.htm and\n**lukitus.bmp.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Locky Lukitus Ransom Note**\n\nAt the time of this writing, the Locky Decryptor TOR payment site has the ransom set to .49\nBTC or approximately $2,000 USD.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Locky Decryptor Payment Site**\n\n## It is not possible to decrypt the Locky Ransomware Lukitus Variant\n\nUnfortunately, at this time it is still not possible to decrypt .lukitus files encrypted by the\nLocky Ransomware for free.\n\nThe only way to recover encrypted files is via a backup, or if you are incredibly lucky, through\nShadow Volume Copies. Though Locky does attempt to remove Shadow Volume Copies, in\nrare cases ransomware infections fail to do so for whatever reason. Due to this, if you do not\nhave a viable backup, I always suggest people try as a last resort to restore encrypted files\nfrom Shadow Volume Copies as well.\n\nFor those who wish to discuss the Locky ransomware or need support, you can use our\n[dedicated Locky Ransomware Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/605607/locky-ransomware-diablo6-support-and-help-topic-help-instructionshtml/)\n\n## How to protect yourself from the Locky Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to protect yourself from Locky, or from any ransomware, it is important that you use\ngood computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a\nreliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such\nas a ransomware attack.\n\nYou should also have security software that contains behavioral detections such as Emsisoft\nAnti-Malware or [Malwarebytes. I also recommend trying a dedicated ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\n[program like RansomFree.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/ransomfree/)\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following good online security habits, which in\nmany cases are the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\nScan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.\nTherefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n**Update 8/16/17 7:21 PM - Updated with information about spam distribution.**\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Indian airline SpiceJet's flights impacted by ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/indian-airline-spicejets-flights-impacted-by-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hash:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA256: 29fc7875aac4e84fc6b5f76c9bb51eba9bb19eb4398cba5505050809b0f88035\n\n```\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
