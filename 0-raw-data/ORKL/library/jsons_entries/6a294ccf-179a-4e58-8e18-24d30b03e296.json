    "plain_text": "# Dark Caracal: You Missed a Spot\n\n**eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/dark-caracal-you-missed-spot**\n\nBy Cooper Quintin and Eva Galperin December 10, 2020\n\nSecurity researchers at EFF have tracked APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) targeting civil\nsociety for many years now. And while in many cases, the “advanced” appellation is\ndebatable, “persistent” is not. Since 2015, EFF has tracked the cyber-mercenaries known as\n[Dark Caracal, a threat actor who has carried out digital surveillance campaigns on behalf of](https://www.lookout.com/info/ds-dark-caracal-ty)\n[government interests in Kazakhstan and Lebanon.](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/01/29/operation-manul.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nRecent activity seems to indicate that this actor is active once again. In November of 2019\nthe group Malware Hunter Team discovered new samples of the Bandook malware which is\nassociated with Dark Caracal. This time with legitimate signing certificates for Windows\n(issued by the “Certum” certificate authority,) which would allow them to be run without a\nwarning to the user on any Windows computer. Tipped off by the emergence of new variants\n[of the Bandook Trojan, researchers at Checkpoint found three new variants of Bandook:](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/bandook-signed-delivered/)\nsome expanded (120 commands), some slimmed down (11 commands), and all signed with\nCertum certificates. The Checkpoint researchers also discovered several new command and\ncontrol domains in use by Dark Caracal.\n\nIn previous campaigns, this actor has displayed impressively lax operational security,\nenabling researchers to download terabytes of data from their command and control servers.\nThe latest campaign exhibits a somewhat higher level of opsec. Checkpoint reports that\ntargets included “Government, financial, energy, food industry, healthcare, education, IT and\nlegal institutions” in the following countries: Singapore, Cyprus, Chile, Italy, USA, Turkey,\nSwitzerland, Indonesia and Germany.\n\n## Recommended Mitigations against Dark Caracal\n\nThe Dark Caracal threat actors still seem to primarily use phishing and Office-based macros\nas their primary method of infection. Because of this, the best step one can take to protect\nagainst Dark Caracal is to disable Office macros on your personal devices or that of your\nentire organization. This is additionally a good basic security hygiene practice. Standard\nmethods to avoid phishing attacks are also good practice. Readers may also take some\ncomfort in the fact that Bandook is currently detected by many, if not most, antivirus products.\n\n## The Bandook Trojan\n\nOne of the primary signatures of the Dark Caracal threat group is their use of the Bandook\nTrojan, which is described in the Checkpoint report as follows:\n\nThe final payload in this infection chain is a variant of an old full-featured RAT named\nBandook. Written in both Delphi and C++, Bandook has a long history, starting in 2007\nas a commercially available RAT that was developed by a Lebanese individual\nnicknamed PrinceAli.\n\nBandook’s execution flow starts with a loader, written in Delphi, that uses the Process\nHollowing technique to create a new instance of an Internet Explorer process and\ninject a malicious payload into it. The payload contacts the C&C server, sends basic\ninformation about the infected machine, and waits for additional commands from the\nserver.\n\nThese findings are consistent with what EFF previously published in our Dark Caracal and\nOperation Manul reports.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were surprised to see the Checkpoint report when it was released on Thanksgiving as\nwe had been tracking Dark Caracal again as well. Building on Checkpoint’s work, we are\npublishing additional indicators of compromise we have observed that may be of interest to\nother security professionals and malware researchers.\n\n## Additional Dark Caracal Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Hashes:**\n\n09187675a604ffe69388014f07dde2ee0a58a9f7b060bff064ce00354fedc091\n\n0c5735e066bfbc774906942e97a6ffc95f36f88b9960c4dd6555247b3dd2cdb0\n\n2106e0eabc23d44bd08332cf0c34f69df36b9e84a360722a7fd4d62c325531d1\n\n211f1638041aa08762a90c15b1aff699d47e4da21429c22b56f8a3103d13b496\n\n27306de878f7ab58462b6b9436474e85c3935a5b285afec93f4b59a62c30dd32\n\n2b54f945f5e3d226d3a09cdfcc41e311b039ceadf277310697672c8c706aa912\n\n2f9ba191689e69e9a4f79b96d66c0fee9626fbd0ea11e89c0129e5d13afe6d76\n\n3c8ad8264d7ce9c681c633265b531abb4cf9b64c2e1a3befadc64e66e1b5632e\n\n4175c7f8854e2152462058a3e2f23a9026477f9b8001923e2c59b195949070f5\n\n4f2ebe6f4fc345041643d5d7045886956fe121272fa70af08498a27135a72d97\n\n520ead3a863d4ea139f93bbad4d149a37ca766b38af0567f1f31a9205613b824\n\n614d0bece286af47db5a9f17d24778b16e30fea10ab8d4c7f0739246b83d8366\n\n6e79e2a567013cbeea1d13f3e6c883e56e66ab36de88802eb1313736c25293ec\n\n76f9615ce6ce6d20a9404b29649a4987a315c6b6fc703fa289da0aae37d39bce\n\na5b1ba27edee6953fa30771090387a5aca3e4d4541973df9b2e2b535444db5c3\n\nb8c1cb11108d62611ac8035701eea8bb90b55faff2d0a28c23e2dcced176a52f\n\nc4cba54bf57b3bc3bc8f1d71a7d78fcf25eae18d1d96ba4a4fa5eb8d6fb05e08\n\nc852ebf981daa4d17216a569425b6128f5f7f56d746d4aa03ffecef53fb2829b\n\nc8cbded2f6a5792c147a3362a4deb01a54a13fe9b5636367f2bb39084ed6e13a\n\ncdf6413b56618cd641f93c2ca7fa000c486f7f2455daa3e25459e0d1e72ecf45\n\nd50696eec5288f29994aa68b8f38c920f388a934f23855fb516fa94223c29ecc\n\nd6de67f2187d2fad2d88ca3561aa9f9bf3cecf2e303916df0fc892ed97d94ff5\n\nf08cbc1c5bca190bc34f7da3ad022d915758f5eb2c0902b13c44d50129763cf1\n\nf3b54507a82a17f4056baaa3cb24972a2dfa439fa9b04493db100edb191a239f\n\nfe18568eb574d8fa6c7d9bd7d8afa60d39aae0e582aff17c5986f9bab326ec8a\n\n**Unpacked bandook sample:**\n\nfabce973a9edff2c62ccb6fdd5b14c422bc215284f952f6b31cc2c7d98856d57\n\n**Bandook user-agent:**\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; ALI)\n\nUser-Agent: Uploador\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command and Control URLs:**\nhxxp://blancomed.com/newnjususus1/post.php\nhxxp://blancomed.com/newnjususus2/post.php\nhxxp://blancomed.com/newnjususus4/post.php\nhxxp://blancomed.com/newnjususus5/post.php\nhxxp://blombic.com/OSPSPSPS2222292929nnnxnxnxnxnx/add.php\nhxxp://blombic.com/uioncby281229hcbc2728hsha11kjddhwqqqqc/add.php\nhxxp://www.opwalls.com/tunnel2015/add.php\nhxxps://blancomed.com/newnjususus1/post.php\nhxxps://blancomed.com/newnjususus2/post.php\nhxxps://blancomed.com/newnjususus3/post.php\nhxxps://blancomed.com/newnjususus4/post.php\nhxxps://blancomed.com/newnjususus5/post.php\nhxxps://pronews.icu/aqecva/\nhxxps://pronews.icu/aqecva/add.php\nhxxps://pronews.icu/raxpafsd/images\nhxxps://pronews.icu/phpmyadmin\nhxxps://pronews.icu/cgi-bin\n\nhxxp://wbtogm.com\n/hc1/\n/hc2/\n/hc3/\n/hc4/\n/hc5/\n/hc1/images/\n/hc1/temp/\n/hc1/vk/\n/hc1/vk/19160/\n/hc1/index.php\n/hc1/search.php\n/hc1/view.php\n/hc1/tv.php\n/hc1/test.php\n/hc1/log.php\n/hc1/get.php\n/hc1/config.php\n/hc1/cm.php\n/hc1/auth.php\n/hc1/chrome.php\n/hc1/panel.php\n/hc1/validate.php\n/hc1/pws.php\n\n\n-----\n\n/hc1/vk.php\n/91SD8391AC/cap.abc\n/91SD8391AC/pws.abc\n/91SD8391AC/extra.abc\n/91SD8391AC/tv.abc\n/hc4/get.php?action=check\n/91SD8391AC/ammyy.abc\n/91SD8391AC/89911111111012\n\n**Command and Control Domains:**\nmegadeb[.]com\nblancomed[.]com\nopwalls[.]com\nblombic[.]com\nwbtogm[.]com\n\n## Related Issues\n\n[State-Sponsored Malware](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware)\n\n## Tags\n\n[threat lab](https://www.eff.org/tags/threat-lab)\n\n## Join EFF Lists\n\n### Join Our Newsletter!\n\nEmail updates on news, actions, events in your area, and more.\n\nThanks, you're awesome!
