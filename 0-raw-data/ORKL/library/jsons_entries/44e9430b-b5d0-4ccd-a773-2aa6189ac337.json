(Evgen Kotenko/ Ukrinform/Barcroft\nMedia via Getty Images)\nThe hackers who breached Ukrainian government systems and installed a wiper on some of\nthem were in the systems months before dropping their malicious code onto the networks,\naccording to researchers with Cisco’s [Talos Intelligence Group.](https://talosintelligence.com/)\n\nThe researchers found indicators of compromise — artifacts that tell investigators when and\nhow attackers breached a system — which revealed that they were in the networks late last\nsummer. But the intruders waited until months later to deposit a wiper on those same\nsystems, which Microsoft discovered on the systems last week.\n\nMatthew Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Cisco, didn’t say when the\nwiper was deposited on systems. But the wiper’s components were only compiled a few days\nbefore they were discovered on systems last week. The compilation date is visible in the\ncode. Compilation is when the source code that a programmer writes is turned into binary\ncode that a machine can read.\n\nThe wiper is capable of overwriting critical system files and rendering infected computers\ninoperable.\n\nIt wiped seven workstations at one government agency in Ukraine and a combination of\nworkstations and servers at another agency. The web sites of the same two agencies were\nalso defaced in operations that investigators now believe were coordinated.\n\n\n-----\n\nCisco has been assisting Ukraine with security and forensic analysis for five years, beginning\nafter hackers tied to Russia’s GRU intelligence agency took down the electric grid in parts of\nthat country [in late 2015 and](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/) [again in 2016. The company has also been helping Ukraine](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report)\ninvestigate the attacks that occurred last week.\n\nOlney didn’t have details about the nature of the indicators of compromise, since his team is\nstill digging through logs and images from the infected systems. Nor does he know what\nadditional activity occurred inside the infected networks during the four to five months the\nactors sat in them before deploying the wiper.\n\nFrom his experience, however, it appeared that the breaches may have been more\nopportunistic than extensively planned.\n\n“If I were working for a national security organization, knowing that we were going to\npotentially be in conflict with another country, I would get access [to systems] without\nknowing what we’re going to do with it,” he said. “Here [it seems] they got access, and then\ndecided what to do with it.”\n\nResearchers at the security firm Stairwell showed that individual components of the wiper\n[were compiled and built on January 10, just days before the malware was deployed on](https://stairwell.com/news/whispers-in-the-noise-microsoft-ukraine-whispergate/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=Threat+Research)\n[systems and discovered. And researchers at the security firm ESET said the attackers](https://www.eset.com/us/) used\na crypting service called FUD on one of the wiper components in an attempt to make it\nundetectable. FUD is a popular service used by cybercriminals to obfuscate their malicious\ncode in order to hide it from anti-virus programs. Anton Cherepanov, a researcher with ESET,\ntold Zero Day that they may have used FUD to make it look like the attacks were conducted\nby cybercriminals instead of state-supported actors.\n\nThe intrusions were only discovered last week when dozens of government agencies in\nUkraine were suddenly targeted in a defacement campaign in which hackers replaced the\nmain web page of about a dozen sites with a politically charged message and attempted to\ndeface others. The same day the defacements occurred, Microsoft discovered the\ndestructive wiper code on the systems of a handful of entities in Ukraine — this included\ngovernment agencies and at least one IT company now believed to be the Ukrainian\nsoftware and web site development firm called Kitsoft.\n\nThe infection of Kitsoft was important. Once inside the company’s network, the attackers\ndidn’t just deploy the wiper, they also gained access to the administrative panel where Kitsoft\nmanages the web sites of a number of government agencies, and used this access to deface\nsome of those sites. The company only learned later that a wiper had also been deployed on\nsome of its own systems to destroy files.\n\nThe tool, called WhisperGate, works in three stages. In the first stage, the hackers load\nWhisperGate onto a system and the malware overwrites the portion of the hard drive\nresponsible for launching the operating system when the machine is booted up. It overwrites\n\n\n-----\n\nit with a ransom note demanding Bitcoin worth $10,000, though the message doesn t\nimmediately appear on machines.\n\n“Your hard drive has been corrupted,” the note reads. “In case you want to recover all hard\ndrives of your organization, You should pay us $10k via bitcoin wallet. We will contact you to\ngive further instructions.\"\n\nThe ransom demand is a ruse, however, because the true intent of the malware is to destroy\nthe machines. The malware reaches out to a Discord channel and pulls down another\nmalicious component, which then corrupts numerous other files on the infected system.\n\nThe attackers then force the machine to power down. When it turns on again, the ransom\nmessage appears onscreen. The user sees the message and believes they just need to pay\nmoney to get the system decrypted — when in fact their system has already been rendered\ninoperable and unrecoverable.\n\nMicrosoft didn’t say how many government agencies were infected with the wiper. But on\nTuesday, a Ukrainian official told Zero Day that [systems at two government agencies in](https://zetter.substack.com/p/dozens-of-computers-in-ukraine-wiped)\nUkraine are known to have been wiped with the destructive tool, though the investigation is\nstill ongoing.\n\nVictor Zhora, deputy director of Ukraine's State Services for Special Communication and\nInformation Protection, said the master boot record was overwritten on dozens of the\nsystems and data had also been destroyed on the machines.\n\nZhora told Zero Day he believed the defacements and wiper operations were timed.\n\n“It happened the same day and apparently at the same time [at both agencies]…. The\nprobability of coincidence is much lower than if it happened only in one institution,” he said.\n\nCisco’s Olney says the defacements and wiper amount to a “confusing episode but not an\nalarming one,” given the potential for worse attacks.\n\n“What we have seen in [attacks in Ukraine] in the past have had real-world impact,” in which\ngovernment systems didn’t work and lines formed at banks and stores because systems\nwere down and people couldn’t buy groceries. By comparison, the attacks last week amount\nto just another “winter in Ukraine,” he says, when systems are traditionally targeted.\n\n“It makes me wonder about what the intent of these events were,” Olney says. “You have an\nactor who’s methodology is to create chaos.” But the events so far don’t have “the impact we\nwould have expected…. I’m left confused.”\n\nAlthough Ukrainian officials have attributed the attacks to Belarus and Russia, investigators\nsay they haven’t seen evidence pointing to a specific group of hackers or country yet.\nRussia, however, is a prime suspect given its past hacking operations in Ukraine, which\n\n\n-----\n\n[included taking out the power in parts of the country at the height of winter in 2015 and](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/) [2016,](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report)\nand its recent military aggressions against Ukraine, including the build up of troops on\nUkraine’s border.\n\n**Related:**\n\n[What We Know and Don’t Know about the Cyberattacks Against Ukraine - (updated)](https://zetter.substack.com/p/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about)\n\n[Dozens of Computers in Ukraine Wiped with Destructive Malware in Coordinated Attack](https://zetter.substack.com/p/dozens-of-computers-in-ukraine-wiped)\n\n[Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/)\n\n[The Ukrainian Power Grid Was Hacked Again](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report)\n\n_If you like this story, feel free to share with others._\n\n[Share](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hackers-were-in-ukraine-systems-months?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\n_If you’d like to receive future articles directly to your email in-box, you can also subscribe:_\n\n\n-----",
