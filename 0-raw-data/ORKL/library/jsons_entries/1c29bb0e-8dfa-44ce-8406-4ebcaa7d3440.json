Instead, LockFile encrypts every other 16\nbytes of a document.\"\n\n\"This means that a file such as a text document remains partially readable and looks statistically\nlike the original. This trick can be successful against ransomware protection software that relies on\ninspecting content using statistical analysis to detect encryption,\" Loman added.\n\n[Sophos' analysis of LockFile comes from an artifact that was uploaded to VirusTotal on August 22,](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bf315c9c064b887ee3276e1342d43637d8c0e067260946db45942f39b970d7ce/details)\n2021.\n\nOnce deposited, the malware also takes steps to terminate critical processes associated with\nvirtualization software and databases via the Windows Management Interface (WMI), before\nproceeding to encrypt critical files and objects, and display a ransomware note that bears stylistic\nsimilarities with that of LockBit 2.0.\n\nThe ransom note also urges the victim to contact a specific email address\n\"contact@contipauper.com,\" which Sophos suspects could be a derogatory reference to a\ncompeting ransomware group called Conti.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nWhat's more, the ransomware deletes itself from the system post successful encryption of all the\ndocuments on the machine, meaning that \"there is no ransomware binary for incident responders or\nantivirus software to find or clean up.\"\n\n\"The message here for defenders is that the cyberthreat landscape never stands still, and\nadversaries will quickly seize every possible opportunity or tool to launch a successful attack,\"\nLoman said.\n\n[The disclosure comes as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Flash report](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210825.pdf)\ndetailing the tactics of a new Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) outfit known as Hive, consisting of\na number of actors who are using multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks,\nexfiltrate data and encrypt data on the networks, and attempt to collect a ransom in exchange for\naccess to the decryption software.\n\n\n-----\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
