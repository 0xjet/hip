    "plain_text": "## Newcomers in the Derusbi family\n\n**_By Fabien Perigaud on 2015/12/15, 13:30 - Reverse engineering - Permalink_**\n\n**[Derusbi is a well-known RAT family, used in various APT attacks since at least 2008. Many papers ( 1,2,3) have](https://www.novetta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Derusbi.pdf)**\n\n**described two known variants of this malware: a client version, acting as any other RAT by contacting its C&C server,**\n\n**as well as a server version, which just listens for incoming connections from a client.**\n\n**This RAT seems to be continuously evolving, as enlightened by Sekoia which recently described a new way for**\n\n**[Derusbi to bypass Windows drivers signature enforcement.](http://www.sekoia.fr/blog/windows-driver-signing-bypass-by-derusbi/)**\n\n**In this blog post, we'll present the analysis of two new variants we encountered: a** **driver for x64 Windows, and a** **Linux**\n\n**library.**\n\n### Windows x64 driver\n\n#### Installation\n\n**We found various samples of this driver, all signed by legitimate, stolen certificates. One has been revoked, another**\n\n**one is expired, and the last one is still perfectly valid. However, we didn't find any installer delivering the driver, which**\n\n**[might mean it is installed manually, for example along with the installation of the HD Root bootkit, as multiple](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72275/i-am-hdroot-part-1/)**\n\n**evidences link to Derusbi.**\n\n**According to the samples we found, the driver filename is either wd.sys or udfs.sys.**\n\n**The following malicious certificates are used to sign the drivers:**\n\n**Name** **Serial Number** **Status**\n\n**Fuqing Dawu Technology Co.,Ltd.** **4c0b2e9d2ef909d15270d4dd7fa5a4a5** **Revoked**\n\n**XL Games Co.,Ltd.** **7bd55818c5971b63dc45cf57cbeb950b** **Expired**\n\n**Wemade Entertainment co.Ltd** **476bf24a4b1e9f4bc2a61b152115e1fe** **Valid**\n\n#### Rootkit & Evasion capabilities\n\n**In the 4 different samples we found, only one was using VMProtect to obfuscate its imports. The other ones were not**\n\n**packed.**\n\n**During the initialization phase, the driver tries to disable the kernel debugger by calling** **nt!KdDisableDebugger to**\n\n**prevent dynamic analysis.**\n\n**As for the previous client versions (also using a kernel driver for rootkit features), the drivers filters both the filesystem**\n\n**and the network to hide the RAT activities..**\n\n**Network rootkit**\n\n**Depending on the Windows versions, hooks are performed either on** **\\\\Device\\Tcp or** **\\\\Driver\\nsiproxy. Whenever a**\n\n**specific IOCTL is performed on the device (0x120003 or 0x12001b respectively), the hook function hides network**\n\n**connections using ports between 1025 and 1777.**\n\n**Filesystem rootkit**\n\n**The filesystem rootkit is installed by hooking the** **IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL major function of \\\\Filesystem\\Ntfs,**\n\n**and hides the presence of the driver file (which is grabbed by reading the service ImagePath registry value).**\n\n#### Embedded DLL loading\n\n**To perform all its RAT capabilities, the driver relies on a userland component, which is dynamically injected in memory**\n\n**from the kernel. This ensures a better stealthiness, as the userland component is never written to the disk.**\n\n**This userland component is a DLL, located in the** **_.data section and ciphered using the classical Derusbi ciphering_**\n\n**(which simply consists in a 4-bytes XOR).**\n\n**The DLL is injected in one of the svchost.exe processes running as** **_SYSTEM or LocalSystem, using the following_**\n\n**steps:**\n\n**Allocation and copy of 2 shellcodes in the process memory**\n\n**Allocation and copy of an array containing:**\n\n**Pointers to LoadLibraryA / GetProcAddress**\n\n**Name of the DLL export to call (“Func” in our samples)**\n\n\n**Search**\n\n|Col1|OK|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Tags**\n\n\n**log**\n\n**anonymization**\n\n**welcome**\n\n**GoodFET**\n\n**Z-Wave**\n\n**side-channels**\n\n**critical infrastructures**\n\n**Hardware Trojans**\n\n**Sakula**\n\n**BlackVine**\n\n**advanced persistent threat**\n\n**ransomware**\n\n**reconnaissance**\n\n**bitcrypt**\n\n**APT kill chain**\n\n#### PlugX\n\n Advanced Persistent Threat\n## reverse engineering\n# malware\n\n**APT**\n\n**All tags**\n\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n\n**[Cybersecurity Job offers](http://www.cybersecurity-airbusds.com/contact-us/join-us/)**\n\n**[AIRBUS D&S CyberSecurity](http://www.cybersecurity-airbusds.com)**\n\n**[BitBucket CyberTools](https://bitbucket.org/cybertools/)**\n\n\n**Share**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n**Subscribe**\n\n\n**Entries feed**\n\n\n-----\n\n**First shellcode is simply:**\n\n**Second shellcode is a custom DLL loader, which directly loads the DLL in memory without writing it to the disk. The**\n\n**export is then called, with a randomly generated integer as parameter.**\n\n**The randomly generated integer is used to build a named pipe called** **\\\\.\\pipe\\usbpcex%d. This pipe is then used for**\n\n**the communication between the driver and the userland DLL.**\n\n**Once loaded, the DLL writes the machine IP address to the registry key**\n\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\lpstatus.**\n\n#### Configuration\n\n**The configuration is stored just after a string made of 15 \"X”. It is obfuscated using a simple XOR loop:**\n\n**The configuration has the following structure:**\n\n**Offset 0x44: Timer**\n\n**Offset 0x48-0x50: Two hour values, only authorize communication between these hours**\n\n**Offset 0x50: URL for additional C&C retrieval**\n\n**Offset 0x150: 8 C&C structures, 0x6c bytes each**\n\n**The C&C structure is:**\n\n**Offset 0x0: protocol**\n\n**Offset 0x4: IP/domain address**\n\n**Offset 0x24: port**\n\n**The rest of the configuration is filled with garbage.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### j 00000020: 6200 617f a41c 427c 5ee4 e2ad f137 6682 b.a...B|^....7f. 00000030: fcfa ea1c 1efd 5ed7 ef2b a018 3cf6 da58 ......^..+..<..X 00000040: 8301 1f71 2100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ...q!........... 00000050: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................ * 00000150: 2000 0000 7761 7265 2e6e 6963 6574 7279  ...ware.XXXXXXX 00000160: 2e62 697a 007c e4ee 3c09 a2a8 d427 f51e .biz.|..<....'.. 00000170: 504e 9d65 bb01 0000 0025 e96e 4d1a 9eb6 PN.e.....%.nM... 00000180: 58b9 c133 c719 8c5e 3359 d429 9911 6f0a X..3...^3Y.)..o. 00000190: d9f9 c548 6ed8 b485 0000 0000 0028 fd5e ...Hn........(.^ 000001a0: b139 8e77 771d 9f66 6b75 f18c 00b9 2133 .9.ww..fku....!3 000001b0: 00e5 45d4 d062 c2a2 e532 715a 2000 0000 ..E..b...2qZ ... 000001c0: 7761 7265 2e6e 6963 6574 7279 2e62 697a ware.XXXXXXX.biz 000001d0: 006a 55a0 6f17 cffa 9003 766f 3e9a 34a1 .jU.o.....vo>.4. 000001e0: 5000 0000 00be e79c 7e6d c95b 77a4 139f P.......~m.[w... 000001f0: 0be1 2e45 c4d1 94a5 677c f161 2baf 7b6e ...E....g|.a+.{n 00000200: 3caa 8e60 0000 0000 00fa f5f6 2b96 c211 <..`........+... 00000210: dea0 065a 4766 c8bd 00f3 1bcb 8575 7fcc ...ZGf.......u..\n\n\n#### Network Communications\n\n**The malware configuration can embed up to 8 C&C addresses. A configuration update mechanism is also available, by**\n\n**requesting the URL in the configuration. The resulting web page is then parsed, looking for tags $$$--Hello and Wrod--**\n\n**$$$ surrounding a base64 string, which is the new encoded configuration blob.**\n\n**Up to 3 different protocols are supported:**\n\n**Raw TCP**\n\n**Raw UDP**\n\n**HTTP**\n\n**Once a C&C has been reached, its information is stored in the following registry key, xored with 0x51:**\n\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Level10.**\n\n**The DNS Server to use for DNS requests is stored in value** **Level01, xored with 0x51. Source port for the DNS**\n\n**requests is randomly chosen between 1025 and 1777.**\n\n**Proxy settings are stored in registry values** **Level02 to Level05, xored with 0x51.**\n\n**DNS server IP address and proxy settings are retrieved by the userland DLL, by setting up a raw socket to sniff all**\n\n**outcoming traffic and parsing:**\n\n**DNS requests**\n\n**HTTP requests to look for a** **_Proxy-Authorization: Basic header and the proxy address_**\n\n**These two settings are then written to the registry.**\n\n**All network communications are performed by the kernel driver. Each received packet is decoded and sent to the**\n\n**userland in the pipe, and each data received through the pipe is encoded and sent back on the network.**\n\n**Packets have a 0x1c bytes clear header, followed by encrypted/compressed data. The header has the following**\n\n**structure:**\n\n\n#### struct packetHeader {   DWORD random;   DWORD moduleID;   DWORD rawPacketSize;   DWORD checkSum;   DWORD xorKey;   DWORD bCompressed;   DWORD uncompressedSize; };\n\n\n**The ciphering is a simple XOR with the 4-bytes key, packet might be compressed with LZO and checkSum is a**\n\n**CRC32.**\n\n#### Userland component\n\n**The userland component is in charge of the network communications decoding and commands interpretation. It**\n\n**receives, from the kernel module, the moduleID and the deciphered/uncompressed data from the network packet.**\n\n**Modules**\n\n**This part of the malware seems modular, and each module is associated to a module ID. Previous papers described**\n\n**some of those modules, but our samples contained two new modules. Here is the list of all the modules compiled in**\n\n**the DLL:**\n\n**Module ID** **Class Name** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_**\n\n**0x82** **PCC_PROXY** **Network proxy**\n\n**0x83** **PCC_GUI** **Remote Desktop**\n\n**0x84** **PCC_FILE** **Files manipulation**\n\n**0xC0** **PCC_VPN** **VPN feature**\n\n**0xF0** **-** **Uninstall, Disconnect, GetLastError, etc.**\n\n**The two new modules are** **PCC_GUI and PCC_VPN.**\n\n**Embedded PE files**\n\n**The userland DLL embeds 5 PE files, all stored in** **_.data section and ciphered with a 4-bytes XOR key._**\n\n**Embedded PE #1**\n\n**This one is a 64-bits DLL (export \"Func\") for the** **PCC_GUI module. It is injected in \"winlogon.exe\" directly in memory,**\n\n**with the custom DLL loader. Communication with the main DLL is performed through a named pipe called**\n\n**\\\\.\\pipe\\usbpcg%d.**\n\n**Embedded PE #2**\n\n**This is a 64-bits DLL (export \"R32\") used for commands execution ( PCC_CMD module). It is dropped in**\n\n**%Systemroot%\\web\\safemedo.html, and executed with rundll32.exe.**\n\n**Communication with the main DLL is performed through named pipes** **\\\\.\\pipe\\usb%si and \\\\.\\pipe\\usb%so, where “%s”**\n\n**is GetTickCount output in decimal.**\n\n**Process is created with its IO redirected to the pipes. It can be run under a logged-in user, or by specifying user**\n\n**credentials.**\n\n**Embedded PE #3**\n\n**This is a 64-bits DLL (export \"Func\") for keylogging capabilities via the** **_GetAsyncKeyState API. It is directly injected in_**\n\n**\"explorer.exe\" process, and a mutex Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.3790.4770-**\n\n**_ww_05FDF087 is created._**\n\n**Data is saved to** **_%tmp%\\Ziptmp$$__.1._**\n\n**Embedded PE #4**\n\n**This one is another 64-bits DLL (export \"Func\") for keylogging capabilities, this time via the** **_SetWindowsHook API. It is_**\n\n**dropped in %Systemroot%\\web\\safemode.html, executed with rundll32.exe, and a mutex**\n\n**_Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.3790.4770-x_05FDF087 is created._**\n\n**Data is saved to** **_%tmp%\\Ziptmp$$__.2._**\n\n**Embedded PE #5**\n\n**This is a 64-bits NDIS driver for the VPN feature. It is dropped in** **%SystemRoot%\\Drivers\\{1D24B7E2-869D-49D8-**\n\n**B4EB-1424B36C42B6}.sys, and is signed with the XL Games Co.,Ltd. (7bd55818c5971b63dc45cf57cbeb950b)**\n\n**certificate.**\n\n#### Overall Architecture\n\n\n-----\n\n### Linux Library\n\n**We recently noticed that the group behind HD Root bootkit was interested in compromising Linux systems as well. A**\n\n**[very interesting Chinese article describes the features of the Linux version of the bookit. Focusing on the payload](http://translate.wooyun.io/2015/10/23/27.html)**\n\n**loading part, we can see that a userland library is loaded into a /usr/bin/sshd process using LD_PRELOAD.**\n\n**Interestingly, we discovered a Linux library exporting all the classical PAM exports, with an added** **_CTOR leading to a_**\n\n**PccMain() function exposing the Derusbi server behaviour. This library could be the perfect payload for the Linux HD**\n\n**Root, comforting us in the assumption of a strong link between the bootkit and the RAT.**\n\n**The sample we found included all debug symbols, helping the understanding and the naming of each feature.**\n\n#### Lock\n\n**When started, the malware creates a lock in** **/dev/shm/.shmfs.lock.**\n\n#### Network Communications\n\n**The sample listens on port 40101 for incoming connections. The communication protocol is the same than the**\n\n**Windows version. All the network I/O are handled by the BD_SOCK and PCC_SOCK classes.**\n\n#### Modules\n\n**As for the Windows versions, various modules are embedded in the library, each one dedicated to a specific task:**\n\n**Module ID** **Class Name** **Description**\n\n**0x80** **PCC_SYS** **Various commands related to processes and services**\n\n**0x81** **PCC_CMD** **Execute commands**\n\n**0x82** **PCC_PROXY** **Network proxy**\n\n**0x84** **PCC_FILE** **Files manipulation**\n\n**0xF0** **-** **Uninstall, Deconnect, GetLastError, etc.**\n\n**The PCC_CMD module spawns a new process, which argv[0] is replaced by** **[diskio]. The following PS1 variable is set:**\n\n\n#### RK# \\u@\\h:\\w \\$\n\n\n#### Development framework\n\n**Regarding the debugging information still present in the library, it seems that the authors reused code from the**\n\n**Windows version of their RAT, and implemented wrappers for the original Windows API. Source file name is**\n\n**_Win32APIWarp.cpp. We found various functions corresponding to Windows API, such as:_**\n\n**CreateThread(void *, unsigned int, void *(__cdecl *start_routine)(void *), void *, unsigned int, unsigned int *)**\n\n**GetFileAttributesW(wchar_t *)**\n\n**GetTickCount(void)**\n\n**WSAGetLastError(void)**\n\n#### Dropped kernel module\n\n**A kernel module is embedded in the** **_.data section, ciphered using the classical 4-bytes XOR algorithm. Its goal is to_**\n\n**perform rootkit features, by accepting all packets to port 40101 and hiding network communications corresponding to**\n\n**the RAT.**\n\n**Technically, it sets hooks in the netfilter stack by using the** **_nf_register_hook function, and accept all packets matching_**\n\n**the RAT communication. For the hiding part, a hook is set on special file /proc/net/tcp which hides connections using**\n\n**ports between 40101 and 40500.**\n\n**The driver is first patched to insert proper** **_.modinfo and dropped in_** **/tmp/.secure. It is then loaded by simply calling**\n\n**_insmod. The correct version information inserted in_** **_.modinfo is retrieved by trying to read various hardcoded kernel_**\n\n**modules which should be present on Linux machines. After loading, the module file is deleted.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Derusbi seems to be a trendy malware, evolving on several fields. The interest of APT actors in the Linux systems**\n\n**should encourage the community to improve and develop forensics and malware investigation tools for these**\n\n**platforms.**\n\n### Annex\n\n#### Hashes\n\n**1b449121300b0188ff9f6a8c399fb818d0cf53fd36cf012e6908a2665a27f016**\n\n**50174311e524b97ea5cb4f3ea571dd477d1f0eee06cd3ed73af39a15f3e6484a**\n\n**6cdb65dbfb2c236b6d149fd9836cb484d0608ea082cf5bd88edde31ad11a0d58**\n\n**e27fb16dce7fff714f4b05f2cef53e1919a34d7ec0e595f2eaa155861a213e59**\n\n**75c3b22899e39333c0313e80c4e6958d6612381c535d70b691f5f42afc8c214f**\n\n#### Yara rules\n\n rule derusbi_kernel {   meta:     description = \"Derusbi Driver version\"     date = \"2015-12-09\"     author = \"Airbus Defence and Space Cybersecurity CSIRT - Fabien Perig   strings: $token1 = \"$$$--Hello\"    $token2 = \"Wrod--$$$\"   $cfg = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\" $class = \".?AVPCC_BASEMOD@@\" $MZ = \"MZ\"\n\n   condition:     $MZ at 0 and $token1 and $token2 and $cfg and $class }\n\n rule derusbi_linux {   meta:     description = \"Derusbi Server Linux version\"     date = \"2015-12-09\"     author = \"Airbus Defence and Space Cybersecurity CSIRT - Fabien Perig   strings: $PS1 = \"PS1=RK# \\\\u@\\\\h:\\\\w \\\\$\" $cmd = \"unset LS_OPTIONS;uname -a\" $pname = \"[diskio]\" $rkfile = \"/tmp/.secure\" $ELF = \"\\x7fELF\"\n\n   condition:     $ELF at 0 and $PS1 and $cmd and $pname and $rkfile }\n\n**[Legal notice.](http://blog.cassidiancybersecurity.com/pages/Legal-notice)**\n\n\n-----",
