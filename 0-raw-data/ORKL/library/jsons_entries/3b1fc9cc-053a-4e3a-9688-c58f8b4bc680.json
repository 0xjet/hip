Everything from .gov to .com, and domain of several private\nbusinesses.\"\n\nThe Vertek researcher has analyzed the files and broke down the email addresses per\ndomain. In a list the researcher shared with us earlier today (embedded at the bottom of this\narticle), he points out that the vast majority of email addresses are old, from antiquated\nemail services such as Yahoo (10.6 million) and AOL (8.3 million).\n\n\n-----\n\nSurprisingly, while there are many custom email domains included in the leak, there are\nvery few Gmail addresses included, suggesting the email addresses database is either\nincomplete, or this malware campaign intentionally targeted users using older email\nservices.\n\n## The Trik trojan\n\nThe Trik trojan is a classic malware downloader. It infects computers and assembles them\ninto a giant botnet. The botnet's operators use these computers to send out new spam\ncampaigns, or they sell \"install space\" to other crooks, allowing them to deliver more\npontent threats to Trik victims, similarly to how they rented install space to the GandCrab\ncrew for the campaign Vertek stumbled on.\n\nThe Trik trojan has been an active threat for at least a decade but has recently seen a\n[resurgence, according to this Proofpoint report.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/phorpiex-decade-spamming-shadows)\n\nIn its earlier days, the malware operated primarily as a worm that self-spread via removable\nUSB storage devices, Skype, or Windows Live Messenger chats. These worm-based\n[variants had previously been tracked under the name of Phorpiex.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shylock-not-the-lone-threat-targeting-skype/)\n\nThe malware evolved into a fully-fledged trojan years later, when it forked the codebase of\nthe SDBot trojan and started using email spam as its main delivery & infection mechanism,\n[while also switching to an IRC-controlled botnet architecture.](https://www.johannesbader.ch/2016/02/phorpiex/)\n\n[Trik is not the first spam botnet to leak its email addresses database. In August 2017, a](https://benkowlab.blogspot.com/2017/08/from-onliner-spambot-to-millions-of.html)\nspam operation known as Onliner leaked 711 million email addresses that it was using to\nspam users.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Trik C&C server that's leaking email addresses keeps going offline\nat intermittent intervals.\n\n_Top 100 email domains included in the leaked data:_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n8907436 yahoo.com\n8397080 aol.com\n 788641 comcast.net\n 433419 yahoo.co.in\n 432129 sbcglobal.net\n 414912 msn.com\n 316128 rediffmail.com\n 294427 yahoo.co.uk\n 286835 yahoo.fr\n 282279 verizon.net\n 244341 bellsouth.net\n 234718 cox.net\n 227209 earthlink.net\n 221737 yahoo.com.br\n 191098 ymail.com\n 174848 att.net\n 156851 btinternet.com\n 139885 libero.it\n 120120 yahoo.es\n 117175 charter.net\n 112566 mac.com\n 111248 mail.ru\n 107810 juno.com\n 92141 optonline.net\n 86967 yahoo.ca\n 78964 me.com\n 73341 yahoo.com.ar\n 71545 yahoo.in\n 71200 rocketmail.com\n 69757 wanadoo.fr\n 68645 rogers.com\n 65629 yahoo.it\n 65017 shaw.ca\n 64091 ig.com.br\n 63045 163.com\n 62375 uol.com.br\n 57764 free.fr\n 57617 yahoo.com.mx\n 57066 web.de\n 56507 orange.fr\n 56309 sympatico.ca\n 54767 aim.com\n 51352 cs.com\n 50256 bigpond.com\n 48455 terra.com.br\n 43135 yahoo.co.id\n 41533 netscape.net\n 40932 alice.it\n 39737 sky.com\n 39116 yahoo.com.au\n 38573 bol.com.br\n 38558 YAHOO.COM\n 37882 excite.com\n 37788 mail.com\n 37572 tiscali.co.uk\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n 37361 mindspring.com\n 37350 tiscali.it\n 36636 HOTMAIL.COM\n 36429 ntlworld.com\n 34771 netzero.net\n 33414 prodigy.net\n 33208 126.com\n 32821 yandex.ru\n 32526 planet.nl\n 32496 yahoo.com.cn\n 31167 qq.com\n 30831 embarqmail.com\n 30751 adelphia.net\n 30536 telus.net\n 30005 hp.com\n 29160 yahoo.de\n 28290 roadrunner.com\n 27558 skynet.be\n 26732 telenet.be\n 26299 wp.pl\n 26135 talktalk.net\n 26072 pacbell.net\n 26051 t-online.de\n 25929 netzero.com\n 25917 optusnet.com.au\n 25897 virgilio.it\n 25525 home.nl\n 25227 videotron.ca\n 24881 blueyonder.co.uk\n 24462 peoplepc.com\n 24435 windstream.net\n 24079 xtra.co.nz\n 23465 bluewin.ch\n 23375 us.army.mil\n 22433 hetnet.nl\n 22247 trainingelite.com\n 22021 yahoo.com.sg\n 21689 laposte.net\n 21336 ge.com\n 21130 frontiernet.net\n 21055 q.com\n 21034 mchsi.com\n 20882 webtv.net\n 20830 abv.bg\n 19425 insightbb.com\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n```\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Phishing websites now use chatbots to steal your credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-websites-now-use-chatbots-to-steal-your-credentials/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Fake crypto sites lure wannabe thieves by spamming login credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-crypto-sites-lure-wannabe-thieves-by-spamming-login-credentials/)\n\n[HTML attachments remain popular among phishing actors in 2022](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/html-attachments-remain-popular-among-phishing-actors-in-2022/)\n\n[Botnet](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/botnet/)\n[Data Leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-leak/)\n[Email](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/email/)\n[GandCrab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gandcrab/)\n[MalSpam](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malspam/)\n[Trik](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trik/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
