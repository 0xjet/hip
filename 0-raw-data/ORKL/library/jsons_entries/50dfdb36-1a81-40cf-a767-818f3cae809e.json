Following our previous update, we would like to share some additional technical\ndetails to support our customers and the community. We have also published additional\nindicators of compromise that organizations can leverage for their network defenses.\n\n## Initial Intrusion Vector\n\nMandiant identified the source of our internal network compromise began in 2022 when an\nemployee installed the Trading Technologies X_TRADER software on the employee’s\npersonal computer. Although the X_TRADER installation software was downloaded from the\nTrading Technologies website, it contained VEILEDSIGNAL malware, which enabled the\nthreat actor (identified as UNC4736) to initially compromise and maintain persistence on the\nemployee’s personal computer.\n\nThe X_TRADER installer (X_TRADER_r7.17.90p608.exe) was digitally signed by a valid\ncode signing certificate with the subject of “Trading Technologies International, Inc”. It was\nhosted on hxxps://download.tradingtechnologies[.]com. While the X_TRADER software was\nreportedly retired in 2020 by Trading Technologies, the software was still available for\ndownload on the Trading Technologies website in 2022. The code signing certificate used to\ndigitally sign the malicious software was set to expire in October 2022.\n\nFor more technical detail on the X_TRADER software supply chain attack, including YARA\nRules for hunting, please read Mandiant’s blog at\n[https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/3cx-software-supply-chain-compromise.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/3cx-software-supply-chain-compromise)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\nFollowing the initial compromise of the employee’s personal computer using VEILEDSIGNAL\nmalware, Mandiant assesses the threat actor stole the employee's 3CX corporate credentials\nfrom his system. VEILEDSIGNAL is a fully-featured malware that provided the threat actor\nwith administrator-level access and persistence to the compromised system. The earliest\nevidence of compromise uncovered within the 3CX corporate environment occurred through\nthe VPN using the employee's corporate credentials two days after the employee's personal\ncomputer was compromised.\n\nAdditionally, Mandiant identified the use of the Fast Reverse Proxy tool\n[(https://github.com/fatedier/frp) which the threat actor used to move laterally within the 3CX](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\nenvironment. The tool was named MsMpEng.exe and located in the C:\\Windows\\System32\ndirectory.\n\n## CI/CD Build Environment Compromise\n\nMandiant’s investigation was able to reconstruct the threat actor’s steps through our\nenvironment as they harvested credentials and moved laterally. Eventually, the threat actor\nwas able to compromise both the Windows and macOS build environments. On the Windows\nbuild environment, the attacker deployed the TAXHAUL launcher and COLDCAT downloader\nwhich persisted by performing DLL hijacking for the IKEEXT service and ran with\nLocalSystem privileges. The macOS build server was compromised using a POOLRAT\nbackdoor using LaunchDaemons as a persistence mechanism.\n\n## Attribution\n\nBased on the Mandiant investigation into the 3CX intrusion and supply chain attack thus far,\nthey attribute the activity to a threat actor cluster named UNC4736. Mandiant assesses with\nhigh confidence that UNC4736 has a North Korean nexus.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nX_TRADER_r7.17.90p608.exe\n\nSHA256: fbc50755913de619fb830fb95882e9703dbfda67dbd0f75bc17eadc9eda61370\n\nSHA1: ced671856bbaef2f1878a2469fb44e9be8c20055\n\nMD5: ef4ab22e565684424b4142b1294f1f4d\n\nSetup.exe\n\nSHA256: 6e11c02485ddd5a3798bf0f77206f2be37487ba04d3119e2d5ce12501178b378\n\nSHA1: 3bda9ca504146ad5558939de9fece0700f57c1c0\n\nMD5: 00a43d64f9b5187a1e1f922b99b09b77\n\n\n-----\n\nCode signing certificate serial #\n9599605970805149948\n\nMsMpEng.exe\n\nSHA256: 24d5dd3006c63d0f46fb33cbc1f576325d4e7e03e3201ff4a3c1ffa604f1b74a\n\nSHA1: d7ba13662fbfb254acaad7ae10ad51e0bd631933\n\nMD5: 19dbffec4e359a198daf4ffca1ab9165\n\n## Command and Control\n\nMandiant identified that malware within the 3CX environment made use of the following\nadditional command and control infrastructure.\n\nwww.tradingtechnologies[.]com/trading/order-management\n\n## Going Forward\n\nOur priority throughout this incident has been transparency around what we know as well as\nthe actions we’ve taken.\n\nAs we wind down our incident investigation, 3CX has taken this opportunity to continue to\nstrengthen our policies, practices, and technology to further protect against future attacks.\nWith that, we’re announcing a 7 Step Security Action Plan. In this plan, we’re committing to\n[actionable steps to harden our defenses. You can read in more detail here.](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/security-action-plan)\n\n\n-----",
