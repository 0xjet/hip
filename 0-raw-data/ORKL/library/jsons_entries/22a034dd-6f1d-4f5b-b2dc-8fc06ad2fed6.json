This is true both for security analysts and for\nattackers. This paper describes a new botnet, which we called Geost, discovered thanks to\nmultiple OpSec mistakes made by the attackers. The mistakes included: the use of the\nHtBot malware’s illegal proxy network; failing to encrypt the command-and-control servers;\nre-using security services; trusting other attackers that practise even less operational\nsecurity; and failing to encrypt chat sessions. As far as we know, the Geost botnet has\nhundreds of malicious domains, 13 C&C servers, approximately 800,000 victims in Russia,\nand potential access to several million Euros in bank accounts. Moreover, the operational\nsecurity mistakes led to the discovery of the names of members of an underground group\nrelated to the Geost botmasters. It is seldom possible to gain such an insight into the\ndecisions taken by attackers due to failures in their operational security. This paper\nsummarizes the mistakes and the risks taken by the botmasters, provides an overview of\nthe botnet operation, an analysis of the victims, and a study of the social relationships of the\ndevelopers.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIt has always been difficult to know exactly how botnet owners (botmasters) operate. It is a\ncomplex task to understand the details of their decisions, to see inside their command-andcontrol (C&C) channels, and to glimpse into their conversations. The three main reasons\nwhy it has been difficult to find this information are:\n\n1. Malware authors operate some degree of operational security (from now on OpSec) in\n\norder to hide information.\n2. The C&C channels are implemented using evasive techniques, such as random\n\ndomain names, overwhelming analysts with information.\n3. It may not legally be possible for analysts to access data and communications in\n\nremote servers.\n\nWith all these obstacles combined, the security community rarely sees how botmasters\noperate, make decisions, and protect their communications.\n\nOpSec failures have been the reason for multiple important discoveries in cybersecurity.\nOpSec can be defined as a ‘risk management process that encourages managers to view\noperations from the perspective of an adversary in order to protect sensitive information\nfrom falling into the wrong hands’ [1]. The consensus is that OpSec decisions should be\n\n\n-----\n\ncarefully designed to be effective against a certain risk. Problems in OpSec are not limited\nto technical mistakes but include mistakes made in the correct evaluation of the risks taken,\nand the countermeasures applied for protection.\n\nThis paper presents a very rare case of a chain of OpSec mistakes leading to the discovery\nof a new Android banking botnet targeting Russian citizens. It is unusual because the\ndiscovery was made when the botmasters decided to trust a malicious proxy network called\nHtBot. Our security laboratory had already been running samples of the HtBot malware for\nmonths when a traffic analysis revealed a group of infected computers being used to\nmanage infected Android phones. The HtBot malware provides a proxy service that can be\nrented to provide secure connecting hosts for malicious activity. Our analysis of this HtBot\ncommunication led to the discovery and disclosure of a large operation infecting Androidbased phones.\n\nAfter the initial discovery of the Geost botnet, the method of analysis consisted of extracting\nmore information about the attacks, the victims, the operations, its capabilities, and finally,\nabout the group of developers related to the Geost botnet. Using pivoting techniques of\nthreat hunting it was possible to uncover the C&C channels, the domains and IP addresses.\nGiven that more than 72,600 victims were uncovered in just one C&C server, and there are\nat least 13 C&C channels, a conservative estimate of the total number of victims was\ncalculated at 871,200.\n\nThe OpSec failures of the Geost botmasters were significant enough to allow us to recover\na large amount of information. First, the attackers had a flawed risk model when choosing\nthe appropriate communication platform for hiding their tracks. They picked up an illegal\nproxy network, not knowing that the network was being monitored by our laboratory. Instead\nof trusting a good communication provider, they trusted the security of a badly maintained\nillegal network. Second, the botmasters didn’t protect their communications with several\nlayers of encryption protocols – making it possible for us to see the content of their\ncommunications. Third, there was a leaked document on a public website that detailed the\nchatting activities of a group of developers working on the C&C website of the botnet. Since\nthe chat was conducted over Skype, it is possible that it was leaked by a member of the\ngroup. Fourth, the chat log revealed that credentials were commonly passed unencrypted in\nthe chat, giving access to very important information about them. In summary, a chain of\nsmall mistakes was enough to disclose the operation of a large Android banking botnet.\n\nThis paper makes the following novel contributions:\n\nDescribes for the first time and names the Geost botnet, unknown to the security\ncommunity until now.\nProvides an analysis of the OpSec mistakes that led to the discovery of the activities\nof a cybercrime group acting in Russian-speaking countries.\nDescribes the complete infrastructure of the botnet and its victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublishes indicators of compromise (IoCs) and information to enable the community\nto act upon the Geost botnet.\nPerforms a social analysis of the cybercriminal group discovered.\nMakes available for the research community, upon request, all the datasets in\nreference to the discovery of the Geost botnet.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analyses the previous work\nin this area; Section 3 describes the discovery of the Geost botnet; Section 4 shows how\nthe botnet operates; Section 5 analyses the infrastructure of the botnet; Section 6 studies\nthe victims of the botnet; Section 7 discusses the attackers, botmasters and developers;\nand Section 8 presents our conclusions.\n\n## 2. Previous Work\n\nThere are several examples of mistakes made by malware authors that have led to the\ndiscovery of their identities. However, they are usually regarded as technical mistakes\nrather than OpSec problems [2]. Technical mistakes are usually discovered as a result of\npoor OpSec criteria, e.g. code review. OpSec problems are hard to mitigate and they\nusually lead to the discovery of how botmasters operate or who they are [3]. Good OpSec\ncan protect the user, but depending on the adversary, small mistakes can be very costly.\nOne of the most famous OpSec incidents was that of Guccifer 2.0, the alleged persona that\nattacked the Democratic National Committee in the US, whose real affiliation was\nsupposedly confirmed when Guccifer 2.0 apparently failed to activate their VPN during one\nlogin process [3]. This is an example of how hard good OpSec can be, even for\nexperienced attackers.\n\nA similar case of OpSec failure being taken advantage of by a powerful adversary was the\nidentification of the owner of the Silk Road drug-selling site, Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht was\nfound because he used his personal email account to register other accounts related to his\nillegal site [4]. Although good OpSec is possible [5], cybercriminals also make mistakes that\nput them in jeopardy.\n\nPractising good OpSec is hard, and it’s harder when others try to force mistakes. In 2009\nthe Mariposa botmasters were captured because they connected to their servers directly\nfrom their homes. They usually used VPN services but after the police took their servers\ndown (to force their hand), the botmasters panicked and connected insecurely. This paper\nprovides an analysis of OpSec mistakes committed by a group of attackers while managing\npart of a botnet.\n\nRegarding previous work on the Geost botnet, the only previous unnamed reference found\nwas a post from September 2017 on the blog site Virqdroid [6]. This blog post analysed one\nof the malware’s APK files, showed its technical qualities, and reported the IoCs. However,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe blog lacked data about the threat, the attackers and the victims, and therefore\nconclusions could not be drawn as to the size of the operation or the identity of the Android\nbanking botnet.\n\nProbably the most well-studied part of Android banking trojans are the binaries themselves.\nThis is because binaries are the first contact with the security community and usually the\nonly source of information. The number of binaries related to Android banking trojans\nsuggest that these threats have been rising during 2017 [7] and 2018 [8], although no\nscientific study has focused on a systematic analysis of the problem. Android banking\nmalware is too numerous to describe, but a few important mentions can be made. In the\nearly 2000s trojans Perkele and ibanking were well known for using SMS as a\ncommunication channel [9]. From 2014 there was a new era of banking botnets with the\nappearance of Slempo, Marcher, Shiz, BankBot and MazarBOT [9]. Their infection\ntechniques, C&C protocols, and the attacks performed were significantly improved.\n\nAnalysing a malware binary is very useful, but the network traffic provides a different\nperspective. Even though some binary analysis may reveal network traffic [10], it is very\ndifficult to capture traffic from the botmaster’s actions. In this regard, this paper shows a\nnovel discovery of real botmasters’ actions while using their C&C servers.\n\n## 3. Discovery\n\nThe Geost Android banking botnet was discovered as part of a larger malware analysis\noperation in our laboratory. During an experiment in which a sample of the HtBot malware\nwas executed [11], the traffic analysis revealed a very unusual communication pattern that\nstood out from the rest.\n\nHtBot operates by converting its victims into unwilling private illegal Internet proxies. The\ninfected victims relay communications from the HtBot users to the Internet. HtBot is\nregarded as an underground proxy network that is difficult for security analysts to tap, since\nits traffic is continually redirected to new victims. The users of the HtBot network pay the\nHtBot botmasters to provide them with high-speed, semi-private communications for their\noperations.\n\nOur laboratory was running and monitoring HtBot bots that were communicating with the\nInternet. Since these bots offered illegal proxy connections it was possible to capture all the\ntraffic coming from the illegal users to the Internet. During the analysis of the network traffic\nof the illegal users, a pattern was discovered; this turned out to be the content of the C&C\ncommunication channel of the new Geost botnet.\n\nFigure 1 shows the infrastructure operation of the HtBot malware and how it was used to\nfind the new Geost botnet. When the botmasters of the Geost botnet connected to the\nHtBot proxy network they sent all their traffic through our victim bot, and therefore through\n\n\n-----\n\nour monitoring service. Therefore, all the information collected about Geost s actions comes\nfrom looking at the traffic going through our computer.\n\nFigure 1: Discovery of the\n\nGeost botnet. A monitored bot of the HtBot malware was used by the Geost botmasters.\nFirst, the Geost botmaster connected to the HtBot network; second, the HtBot network\nrelayed the data to our bot; third, our bot sent the traffic to the Internet; fourth, the botmaster\naccessed the Geost C&C server on the Internet.\n\nThe analysis of the HtBot malware traffic revealed the pattern shown in Figure 2. This\npattern was discovered thanks to two features that stand out: the large amount of traffic\ntransferred and the lack of encryption. Transfers of such large amounts of unencrypted data\nare not common in a normal network. The use of unencrypted web servers for the C&C\noperation was the second OpSec mistake made by the botmasters. It is not clear why they\nneglected to use TLS encryption, since it is free and easy to install. The main hypothesis is\nthat they may have had a large number of C&C servers and managing the certificates for\nthem all would have been time consuming.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Unencrypted traffic pattern of the Geost botnet that helped to find it. This traffic\nwas later found to correspond with the download of SMS messages from the Android phone\nvictims.\n\nThe OpSec decision of the Geost botmasters to use the HtBot proxy botnet is believed to\nbe based on the idea that an illegal proxy network may have better security than other\nalternatives, such as the Tor network [12], a commercial VPN network, or their own\ncompromised servers on the Internet. The Tor network was probably discarded as a bad\nOpSec choice since it is known to be monitored [13]. The option of a commercial VPN has\nthe disadvantage that the botmasters would be putting their trust in a private company that\nmay be forced to submit its logs to the authorities. The third option, of compromised\nservers, may be the best from an OpSec point of view, but it would involve extending the\ncurrent Android banking botnet with another layer of servers, infections, malware,\nmonitoring, and maintenance. This option is much more costly than the rest. The decision to\nuse the HtBot network may have seemed wise since it does not belong to a company, it’s\nnot usually monitored, and it handles its own maintenance. In the end, though, the decision\nto use the HtBot network was the first operational security mistake. It seems that the\nbalance of probabilities and cost-benefit analysis were not correctly evaluated by the\nbotmasters.\n\n## 4. Botnet operations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main advantage of accessing the botmasters traffic while they were using the HtBot\nnetwork was the possibility of a deep study of the attackers’ decisions and actions. The\nanalysis helped to identify a large botnet infrastructure, measure the size of the operation,\nand determine the goal of the botnet. Based on the evidence found, the Geost operation\nseems to consist of a large number of APK Android applications related to several topics,\nfrom banks and photo services, to fake social networks. Once the applications are installed\nit seems that they may be able to interact directly with the web services of five banks in\nEastern Europe. It seems that one of the goals of the botnet is to access the personal\ninformation of the victims through their SMS messages, including those messages sent by\nthe banks. The rest of this section describes the actions of the botmasters and how they\nhelped identify each part of the Geost botnet. It is worth remembering that this was the\ntraffic traversing our HtBot instance.\n\n### Access and actions in the C&C servers\n\nThe botmasters accessed the C&C servers through a web server using port 80/TCP. The\nweb server was running nginx version 1.12.2. The first connection seen in the traffic was\nmade on Sat, 10 Mar 2018 11:54:08 GMT and it was an access to the C&C server with the\nfollowing request (not complete):\n```\nGET /geost.php?bid=c5d72910bd8a97aeb2ce\n 7336fbd78a1f HTTP/1.1\nHost: wgg4ggefwg.ru\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;\n rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nReferer: http://wgg4ggefwg.ru/geost.php\nCookie: SSE=p6ee96ki2knqrtsahdv84cuj04;\n __lnkrntdmcvrd=-1\n\n```\nFrom this request several things can be learned. First, that the botmaster was already\nlogged in, because the cookie was already set. Second, that the botmaster was probably\nusing a Windows computer, given the User-Agent. Third, that the domain was\nwgg4ggefwg.ru, and that the request was coming from the web page\nhttp://wgg4ggefwg.ru/geost.php. After this first request, the botmaster changed a note on\none of the victims with the following request:\n```\nPOST /stuff.php?mode=change_notes\n(...)\nbid=c5d72910bd8a97aeb2ce7336fbd78a1f&\nnotes=14.50+10.03+68.000\n\n```\nThe fact that the botmasters put notes on individual victims suggests that they may have\nbeen after something more than automatic access to their bank accounts. After changing\nthe note for a victim, the botmaster requested a list of SMS messages from a victim with the\n\n\n-----\n\nHTTP request POST /stuff.php?mode=showSmsList. The response to this request was a\nlong list of more than 900 SMS messages from one victim. The SMS messages are\nanalysed in Section 6.\n\nThe original HTTP response with the SMS list was a JSON file using Unicode encoding (\\u\nchars) for transferring Russian characters. The following is an example:\n```\n{\"response\": [{\"conversations\":\n{\"+900\":[{\"body\":\"\\u0421\\u043f\n\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\n\n```\nThe decoded text in Russian is as follows (the password was redacted):\n```\nСписание средств: Platbox (RUB 120.00); пароль: 342365.Не сообщайте пароль НИКОМУ.\nТолько мошенники запрашивают пароли.\n\n```\nThe English translation of this message is:\n```\nWithdrawal of funds: Platbox (RUB 120.00); password: 342365. Do not disclose the\npassword to ANYONE. Only fraudsters request passwords.\n\n```\nThis SMS seems to be a message from the Platbox Russian payment system saying that\n120 Russian Rubles have been withdrawn. Despite our initial assumption that the botnet\nwas only looking for two-factor authentication messages, it is unclear why the botmasters\nare monitoring these messages. The first important remark is that the C&C stores the\ncomplete list of SMS messages of all the victims since the moment they were infected. The\nsecond important remark is that the SMSs were processed offline in the C&C server to\nautomatically compute the balance of each victim. This can be seen in the C&C web page\nshown in Figure 4.\n\nThe SMS messages stored and used by Geost contained highly sensitive information. For\nexample, a victim infected from July 2017 until March 2018 received the following SMS:\n\nTransfers in bank accounts:\n\n[redacted]Bank Online. Lada SE[name\nredacted]NA transferred to you 2500 RUB\n\nA message from a bank to a victim about money received.\n\nVISA balances:\n\nVISA5880 03/07/18 18:32 admission\n2500r Balance: 49866.86\n\nThis information about balances was analysed automatically by the C&C channel.\n\n### Botmaster access to the login page\n\n\n-----\n\nMore than eight days after the first access, a botmaster showed up again to access the\nGeost C&C server. It may have been a different botmaster because the User-Agent of their\nbrowser was different from the first time. The first time, the User-Agent was Mozilla/5.0\n_(Windows NT 6.1; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0, which is a Windows computer._\nThe second time it was Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101\n_Firefox/45.0, which is an older version of browser in a Windows computer. Since it’s very_\nunlikely that the botmaster downgraded the browser, the conclusion is that these are\ndifferent computers.\n\nDuring this second access, it was possible to observe the complete login process and to\nobtain the master password of the C&C server. The long-term execution of the malware,\nwhich is standard policy in our laboratory, made possible the capture of this important piece\nof information. This connection also reveals the third OpSec error: the botmasters believed\nthat it was safe to use the HtBot proxy network again. This is a huge underestimation of the\nsecurity risk of using the same service twice. A better approach would have been to change\nthe connection method every time.\n\nThe login request was sent as GET /geost.php and resulted in the login page shown in\nFigure 3. This page was reconstructed in our browsers by extracting the data from the traffic\ncapture. The login page has an option to change the language between Russian and\nEnglish, which suggests that the botmasters may speak either of those languages.\n\nAfter the login page was presented, the botmaster logged in with the following request (not\ncomplete):\n```\nPOST /stuff.php?mode=autorize HTTP/1.1\nHost: wgg4ggefwg.ru\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT\n 6.1; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: http://wgg4ggefwg.ru/geost.php\nContent-Length: 31\nCookie: SSE=epr0dr4qlejbgphtqppmmjrca0\npwd=[redacted]&language=ru\n\n```\nThe password used was 15 characters long and included nine numbers and six lower-case\nletters. The fact that the password was leaked means that it would be possible for others to\nlog into the C&C server. The password is not incredibly complex since it lacked symbols\nand upper-case letters, but it is considered strong enough to resist the casual brute-forcer. It\nis also worth noting that there is a typo in the name of the request parameter, which is\n‘autorize’ instead of authorize.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Login page of the C&C\n\nserver of the Geost botnet. No TLS was used and no username is requested, only a\npassword.\n\nAfter logging in, the botmaster accessed the main panel of the C&C, shown in Figure 4. The\nmain C&C web page is quite large, showing more than 7,500 infected phones and\ninformation about the version of the malware, IMEI of the phones, permissions of the\nmalware, country of the phones, balance in the bank accounts, and much more. Figure 4\nshows the following information for each victim:\n\nStatus: whether the victim is online.\nID: identification number of the victim assigned by the botnet.\nIMEI: code that identifies each cell phone.\nRights: probably whether the malware has admin rights, or only SMS access, or both.\nVersion: version of the Android operating system.\nOperator: phone operator.\nCountry: country of the phone – it is not clear how this is obtained, but probably using\nthe phone number.\nBalance: balance in the bank of the user.\nCategory: it is not clear what is this menu for – the options are: Balance, Spam, Dead,\nLok, Tupyat, Sliv, Credit, OTKLU4en, NULOVKI and ONLIKI.\nFlow: probably to identify how the phone was infected, given that the options are:\nmarion1, dea and sitedub, which are related to APK applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Main page of the C&C server of the Geost botnet. The C&C shows actions for\ninjecting in banks and managing spam.\n\n### Features of the C&C\n\nBy looking at the options on the C&C page it is possible to infer the goals of the botnet and\nits main activities. From the top menu it can be seen that the management of injects\n(specific applications for each bank) is important, as well as the management of spam, SMS\nand Tasks. Under the menu Поток, which means Flow or Stream, there are the following\noptions:\n\nsvd2\niYl5i8 (Photo Youla). [Site youla.ru]\nEBtiym (Photo Avito). [Site www.avito.ru]\napkmontman\nCvKa5S (321)\n2s1Kb1 (Antivirus_PRO)\nmarion1\nsTPYWM (Установка) (means Installation)\ndea\nУстановка installation\nУстановить to install\nsitedub\n\n\n-----\n\nBPg5nZ (123)\nwdbX4p (OK). OK.RU. https://ok.ru/\nq5Q9PR (Skype)\nQX3YrO (WhatsApp)\nGHf5Bt (Ula). https://youla.ru/\nI97CiN (Imo). ImoOnline.ru.

This\ntheory was confirmed later when it was found that each botnet operator has its own ‘Flow id’\nto determine how many infections they produced. After accessing the main C&C web page\nthe botmaster requested to filter the victims by their online status using the following\nrequest:\n```\n/stuff.php?mode=filter_online\n\n```\nAfter the victims were sorted by online status, the botmaster sorted them by balance\namount using the following request:\n```\n/stuff.php?mode=filter_balance\n\n```\nThese two actions suggest that the intention was to see the online victims that have the\nlargest balance of money, probably to act on them in some way, but no action was\nwitnessed.\n\n### Banks attacked\n\nBy accessing the client-side source code of the web page in the network traffic, it was\npossible to identify which banks were the focus of the Geost botnet. The fact that only five\nbanks were listed suggests that there is a special type of action that can only happen with\n\n\n-----\n\nthose banks. It may seem as if the malware APKs or the C&C code could access and make\ntransfers in accounts of those banks, but this hypothesis was not proven. For security\nreasons the complete list of banks will not be published until the banks acknowledge our\ncontact with them. However, it is possible to provide the following characteristics of the\ntargeted banks:\n\nThe first bank is a Russian commercial neobank. One of the top five providers of\ncredit cards in Russia.\nThe second bank is one of the five largest private commercial banks in Russia and\none of the top 1,000 world banks.\nThe third bank is one of the three largest banks in Russia and Eastern Europe, and\none of the top 40 banks in the world.\nThe fourth bank is one of the 500 largest organizations in Europe and one of the\nleading banks in Russia.\nThe fifth bank is part of a large group of cooperatives with subsidiaries in more than\n15 countries, being in the top seven banks in Russia.\nThe sixth bank is a publicly traded Russian payment service provider operating\nelectronic online payment systems in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus,\nRomania, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n## 5. Botnet infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure used by Geost is large but not extremely complex. To date, 13 C&C IP\naddresses, more than 140 domains, and more than 150 APKs files have been found. The\ndomains seem to be randomly generated, but not with a complete domain generation\nalgorithm.\n\n### Randomness in Geost\n\nDomain generation algorithms (DGAs) are algorithms that generate domains in a\npseudorandom way. This is used as a mechanism to avoid detection and hide the C&C\nserver by resolving a new IP address very quickly. Since the algorithm is unknown to the\nanalyst, they are usually unpredictable. However, the malware author knows the algorithm\nand therefore can predict which domain will be requested. The attacker then registers the\ndomain with an IP address they control. There are usually three main ways to identify a\nDGA algorithm: (1) the domains seem random, (2) dozens of domains are requested very\nquickly, and (3) most of the domains do not have an IP assigned to them. However, in the\ncase of Geost, the domain generation algorithm is very unusual. It looks random enough,\nbut each sample only attempts to contact one domain. Also, all the domains found so far do\nhave an IP address assigned. It is not clear, then, how the domains are assigned to each\nsample, but it appears that each domain is assigned to one sample. The DGA used in the\nGeost botnet is character-based, uses letters and numbers, and the TLD is .ru or .xyz. The\nonly domain that broke the rule was g877855hrg.ru.com.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is a sample list of Geost C&C domains:\n\nw23t2t2tfwg.ru\nwg34gh34t.xyz\n32r3t23wef.ru\nijsdggrur.ru\nwgg4ggefwg.ru\n52t34tyt43.xyz\n\nAnother novel feature of Geost in reference to randomness is the use of an algorithm to\ngenerate PHP file names. This is not strictly DGA since they are not domains, but the\nrandom principle is the same. The main difference between a classic DGA and the PHP file\ngeneration algorithm is the purpose. While classic DGAs are intended to prevent the\ndiscovery of the botnet domains and subsequent takedown, the PHP file generation\nalgorithm prevents the generation of signatures to find and block those names. It is not\nsimple, for example, to create a YARA rule that matches a DGA domain using a random\nPHP file. The PHP filenames are 32 characters long, the same as an MD5 string. The\nfollowing is a sample list of the filenames for the domain 2ve3gh53h3yh.ru:\n\nm99h49wtp1g35b5721d64mfs5p8ese1x.php\nn7co2vpu098x85ctgdn689rf4d18n5jz.php\nfhdkqgyfux4gj2t6zwu434ptw0i0mefu.php\ncsbu72ow56i9qq7yg1ufbo3ql1phb1s6.php\nf8t8d5tnqvwwi1l2qf0itr97cdibre6i.php\nhgkvf2riqt49z33isl978pj17aivc0nw.php\n\nThe final characteristic of Geost domains is that some of them have a large number of\nsubdomains. For instance, the domain 2ve3gh53h3yh.ru has exactly 1,024 subdomains,\nsuch as 0hu, 00n, 03, 06p and 090.\n\n### IP addresses\n\nAt least 13 IP addresses have been found so far. Table 1 shows a summary of the IP\naddresses with, for each one, the Autonomous System (AS), country, number of domains\nrelated to the IP, and the number of APK hashes that communicate with it. It is worth noting\nthat most IP addresses belong to Mauritius.\n\n|IP|AS|Country|WHOIS|Domains|Hash|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|104.18.61.144|CloudFlare, Inc.|US|Cloudfare|>100|3|\n|104.24.109.180|CloudFlare, Inc.|US|Cloudfare|>100|19|\n|162.222.213.6|QuadraNet Enter|US|USWHSS.COM|14|20|\n\n\n-----\n\n|162.222.213.25|Admo.net|US|USWHSS.COM|20|20|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|162.222.213.29|Admo.net|US|USWHSS.COM|8|20|\n|154.16.244.26|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|3|0|\n|154.16.244.27|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|9|2|\n|154.16.244.28|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|19|12|\n|154.16.244.30|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|8|0|\n|154.16.244.138|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|10|0|\n|154.16.244.139|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|3|0|\n|154.16.244.140|NetStack|MU|Madanambal Annauth|1|0|\n|81.177.6.88|OJSC RTComm|RU|Sergey Ulyashin|5|84|\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of the IP addresses used as C&C.\n\n### APK hashes\n\nThe Geost botnet is associated with at least 150 APK (Android package) files. Most APKs\nshare some similarities with each other: each one mostly communicates with only one\ndomain, and each one accesses one unique random PHP file. Regarding the phone\npermissions, all of them requested access to read, receive, and send SMS messages, to\nwrite on the external storage, to access contacts, and to change Wi-Fi status. For the rest of\nthis section we will refer to the APK binaries with their MD5 hash. The list of SHA256\nsashes for the APK files related to this paper can be found in the Appendix.\n\nAn example of a Geost APK is the file with MD5 4e1af25f84200c7f63e315fe7ca07a9c, that,\naccording to VirusTotal, communicated with the domain w23t2t2tfwg.ru and PHP file\nq15m9gdhybzfznkgexdld9lk3tigg08w.php.\n\nAnother example is the APK 9d8702dafbcad82a4603e1fd2e2869b4, which contacted the\ndomain w23t2t2tfwg.ru and the PHP file pyh32o0ezfguw1xl4382wzm8tnr1tyng.php. The\ndomain w23t2t2tfwg.ru is one of the most commonly used by APK samples in Geost. Table\n2 shows the complete list of 25 APK hashes that contacted the domain w23t2t2tfwg.ru\n\n\n-----\n\ntogether with their detection ratio in VirusTotal: the number of anti-virus engines that\ndetected them positively on 23 February 2019 against the total number of anti-virus engines\nthat checked the sample. For space reasons it was not possible to include the complete list\nof 150 APK hashes for the complete Geost botnet.\n\n|SHA256 hash|Detect / Total AVs|\n|---|---|\n|1e13f46e3833e0a002c499a611b8f4b57b9716a0686b2a04ee701260c3f729e4|36 / 61|\n|1bc3a740bf994d49301fac2f976a7e6887a2f869a09a66d273538d44b2c990b6|34 / 59|\n|91c032d905a92a3dc69c2ba163dd9978ce843fbb2f434f2254a1b7d69b411aff|32 / 62|\n|4d73fc6eb4099bb4b27225ea6c19f7a1f5d276a540d42d244a1b38566aacdcea|26 / 62|\n|e31986c1309e9aae27fec1d3a279b816f6610e54c06c154589a4f72f694d1161|29 / 60|\n|34a01cedf6b94d4979a81275fa8cd4e99e9691b13339ce8763d2362d7fe8faec|32 / 62|\n|2dc56dc14d8c352813c3c6d7026f830a940a716ab291f90bd9aacdc9a236af69|29 / 63|\n|22bac0179306a5bfd7e1d90d458298f487c67d3f84b2ab9bd6f2e399c86cfdc7|27 / 62|\n|051a942a724fb1c5485f1e14f7899dc237c9bf1d7e4db900b0c03e2e3e42e8eb|32 / 61|\n|298601b71f2c4d5db132ad9d972cdabb61bdebb69980fac411fdd9a6e9275860|32 / 62|\n|8ddd48b104bd8805a1c5c98bc6fb7165924d3b3206ada973297c2b511ed2b555|27 / 62|\n|e26d52647bc345232aa904987dc872ee500a1278fdfd65fcfbae58be774dcc96|23 / 59|\n|c9a64286bc7e921d150a64e678705b4fcb99389eafc658c623455ba498009212|26 / 62|\n|56ed2cbb764748b95d893ba1b1c58d0dd801ef1a98958cd5a36eff0995d90999|35 / 62|\n|6d6d79f259943c02d1f39fa7212e0dc3c95650e5aab516e90d083120cff9ee60|32 / 62|\n|72808f79b8c1b5d26324e7c30a1ae61eba2775dbe68d92fa2c85cab7329b5d04|27 / 62|\n|781f84749667a9cc588b46671077111f5f433c4e3635c8e832ada54ee72a0421|38 / 63|\n|4c41694a957419fe79173f802f3167df865fbbe78d8a2747e15018acfbdfe86e|31 / 61|\n|ccfff0a7d44fa7d0ff81029c3871be118dad82bc7012a4a5162e979798e2a6fc|19 / 63|\n|f9ae476484cf27a2fff5095f9c0a278debd9794aedefe986d912c95fc3e82f26|28 / 62|\n|4f6524c3748369228e381198213b7eab2fcffb29f4b01a0a6b4c3af2e06f5464|28 / 62|\n\n\n-----\n\n|7bea49e9e60beb5e7fe95c29d8f11da4a6ea36d7ab8787f442125ef111284811|32 / 60|\n|---|---|\n|d305f1f13cdf9bbfb2c1fb16b73771d13a7ca0b6a417e93583ad3d0aa78fac2a|33 / 60|\n|d499e64697b9cf2ba61036acf389939ec91c2c2dae9d3672603fe60c80c85432|28 / 62|\n|78d2ed73571c9f39432143ece31cd92d05b39b7f6590b4841adf33764ac3f816|30 / 62|\n\n\nTable 2: SHA256 hashes of APKs related to the domain w23t2t2tfwg.ru.\n\nAn example of an APK resolving several domains is 92a3a69c6c0922ace36ca3ac95fcbbb6,\nwhich was first seen in the wild in September 2017. The domains resolved by this sample\nwere: 23r23e23er.xyz, fwefr434r3.xyz, rgrer43e2e.xyz, wef34r34rs.xyz and ge5t5t54trtr.xyz.\n\nMost of the APK binaries of the Geost botnet are identified in VirusTotal as ‘Android Hqwar’\nor ‘Banking Trojan’. However, both terms are generic and used to identify thousands of\nbinaries that are protected by a software packer or an obfuscating method. Therefore, this\nparticular botnet has not been identified by the community until now. As an example of how\neach APK was detected by VirusTotal, Table 2 shows a subsample of the total number of\nAPKs and their detection ratios.\n\n### Relationships in the infrastructure\n\nAmong the uncommon characteristics of the Geost infrastructure are: (i) each domain\ncorresponds to a unique IP address; (ii) no domain was ever seen without an IP address\nregistered; (iii) each IP address has more than one domain assigned to it; (iv) domains\nalways refer to the same IP address. It is worth noting that the Geost malware used random\ngeneration of words at least in three places: (1) to generate its domain names, (2) to\ngenerate the names of PHP files, and (3) to generate the names of the APK packages.\n\nAn example relationship between the pieces of the botnet’s infrastructure is the sample\n92a3a69c6c0922ace36ca3ac95fcbbb6. This sample communicated with the domain\nwef34r34rs.xyz, which resolved to the IP address 154.16.244.28. This sample targeted\nthree of the top five Russian banks and the name of its package is\n‘com.vuzbswbpv.ipapszyud’. The same IP address was also assigned to the domain\nt43r43r43.xyz that is requested by the sample\n92a8aa2c6dd86aeab67e687de2c9e6a9591bee17.\n\n## 6. Victims\n\nThe traffic generated by the botmasters when accessing the C&C server revealed\ninformation about the victims of this botnet. It seems that the botmasters kept a detailed\nsummary of the victims, and that this summary was important for the operation of the\n\n\n-----\n\nbotnet. The victims of this botnet not only probably lose money but they had their privacy\nand identity completely compromised. The minimum amount of information that the\nbotmasters know about each victim can be seen in the following list:\n\nIMEI of the phone\nBrand of the phone\nPhone service provider\nPhone number\nCountry of the phone number\nCurrent balance of bank accounts\nHistory of balance in each bank account (the history of the balance is not even\navailable to the victims themselves)\nWhether they have a credit card tied to the phone\nFrom the SMS of the victims:\n\nName of victim\nHome address\nSocial relationships\nReligion\nPurchases\nExpenses\nFinancial problems.\n\nRegarding the number of victims, it is only possible to speculate. In the C&C server of the\nIP address 162.222.213.28 there were 50 victims per page, and there were 1,452 pages,\nwhich gives an estimation of 72,600 victims in that C&C alone. Extrapolating this to the 13\nC&C servers, a rough estimation of the total number of victims may be 871,200. It is\npossible that even more victims exist, given that there may be more C&C servers.\n\nAccording to the 50 victims shown in one of the C&C screens, there is a column labelled\n‘Balance’ that shows the amount of money (in Rubles) in the bank accounts of the victims.\nThe total sum of this column of 50 victims is 1,129,152 Rubles, which is approximately\n15,000 Euros. Extrapolating this number to the estimated 800,000 victims in this C&C there\nmay be an estimated maximum total amount of money close to 240,000,000 Euros.\nHowever, the real total for this C&C could be much lower if we consider that the web page\nis sorted by balance.\n\n### IMEI\n\nOf all the information stolen from the victims, the IMEI is important because it can be used\nto identify them. The IMEI is a unique code assigned to cell phones and, by searching for it\nonline, it is possible to find out information about the device. The IMEI number is divided\ninto parts. The initial eight-digit portion of the IMEI, known as the Type Allocation Code\n(TAC), details the phone model and origin. The remainder of the IMEI is manufacturerdefined, with a Luhn check digit at the end. Given the IMEI, it is possible to determine the\n\n\n-----\n\nvictim s phone model and characteristics. From the IMEI it was possible to learn the brands\nof the phones of the victims, which were all Android-based. From the IMEI numbers it was\nalso possible to identify the victims’ phone operators, including Tele2, MTS _RUS, Beeline,_\n_MegaFon, Yota and Motiv. The last one is a Russian regional provider._\n\n### SMS data\n\nThe access to SMS messages was probably one of the more invasive actions of the botnet.\nSMS messages potentially contain a lot of private information about the user. An analysis of\nthe two SMS lists downloaded revealed that users shared very private conversations with\nfriends and lovers, the status of their financial accounts, and sensitive private data about\nthemselves. It was particularly interesting to find that most of the private information was\nleaked by the phone operators, including users’ real name, birthday, the last four numbers\nof their credit card, the amount of money in their balance, and the password for mobile\nbanking applications. The following is an example SMS stolen by the attackers (without\npersonal information):\n```\n07/03/18 18:59 VISA5880 purchase 120r\nMTS TOPUP 5635 Balance: 49746.86r\n\n## 7. Attackers\n\n```\nOne of the most important breakthroughs of this analysis was the discovery of a file in a\npublic web page that referenced one of the Geost domains. This file proved to be the chat\nlog of a group of people related to the Geost botnet operation. It is not clear how the file\nwas leaked, but since it was a Skype chat log it was probably created (whether on purpose\nor not) by one of the participants in the chat. The use of Skype as a communication medium\nis consistent with previous reports on the modus operandi of the Russian malware\ncommunity [14]. The existence of this file marks another OpSec error on the part of the\nbotmasters: they trusted part of the operation to a group of users with very low or nonexistent OpSec practices.\n\nIt was possible, then, to conduct an open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigation to find\nout more about the group in this chat log. The file has more than 6,200 lines, covering eight\nmonths of chats, and shows the private conversations of 29 people. Not all of them seem to\nbe related to the Geost botnet since the group had several alternative streams of revenue.\nBy analysing the top participants in the chat log it was possible to determine that the user\n‘powerfaer’ was the only one talking with all the participants, making this user the probable\nowner of the chat log.\n\nDuring the time period from 2017-06-11 11:14 to 2018-04-17 18:41, powerfaer held\nbusiness discussions with the other 28 people in relation to different projects. The\nconversations between powerfaer and the user with the nickname ‘mirrexx777’ seem to be\nthe most notable since they showed a connection with the Geost botnet. For instance, on\n\n\n-----\n\nseveral occasions powerfaer and mirrexx777 exchanged links to the control panel of the\nGeost botnet, sharing information that nobody would possess unless they were insiders.\nThe following is a human translation from Russian:\n```\nOn 2017-10-18 07:24:07\nFrom powerfaer to mirrexx777:\n http://2[redacted]e.xyz/stats.php?sid=\n 7NDNI0aercTtwPA\n title:Statistics\n Re-crypt, Kaspersky got cleaned\nFrom mirrexx777 to powerfaer:\n ok. will do. according to the old\n recordings how many of them remains?\n i want to start to keep a record\n\n```\nThe fact that they shared information from inside the C&C channels – information that you\nneed to be logged in to see (the stats.php file) – and the fact that they discuss the need to\nfix them, is strong evidence that they possess internal information with complete knowledge\nof its purpose. There were many pieces of evidence in the chat log showing a relationship\nwith malware actions, such as asking to re-encrypt links because Kaspersky was able to\ndetect them.\n\nIt seems that the user powerfaer has operated since 2010. This is supported by one\nconversation where there was a remark about the income from traffic in 2010 having been\nbetter (translated from Russian):\n```\nOn 2017-12-06 18:14:46\nFrom powerfaer to mirrexx777:\n That would be nice to get back in to 2012\n Or 2010\n\n```\nSome conversations in the chat got serious and resulted in the use of real names as a\nmeans to call the attention of the other. This confirmed the names of some aliases. The\nfollowing log confirmed the name of ‘taganchik.ru’ when powerfaer talked to him (translated\nfrom Russian):\n```\nAlexander, really, if we started together we need to finish it. Because for now this\nis working and we can earn money. Not every day we are getting 100k for promotion\n\n```\nLater on, however, it seems that the user taganchik.ru tried to leave the group:\n```\n2017-10-15l14:53\nFrom taganchik.ru to powerfaer:\n(...) But now im saying i am working but\nin fact I dont. I am getting demotivated\nand do not want to do anything\nFrom taganchik.ru to powerfaer:\ni thought about it and im not in\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nFrom powerfaer to taganchik.ru:\nUnderstand, ok. Shame. If you change\nyour mind write to me\n\n```\nShowing a complete lack of OpSec, the chat log also revealed credentials for several\nservers and services, such as fttkit.com (an Android application protection service\nadvertised on the Russian underground site crimina.la). The log also disclosed the IDs of\nonline wallets, and credit card numbers. This information helped us find sensitive\ninformation about the identity of some individuals. For instance, ‘taganchik.ru’, ‘elkol95’ and\n‘dmitrixxx89’ all advertise their services on the same web marketing forum,\nhttps://searchengines.guru/.\n\nThe user powerfaer also engaged in conversations with several money launderers. The log\nconfirms that online payment systems such as WebMoney, Qiwi, and Yandex Money\nremain popular among Russian cybercriminals [15]. However, these services are not\nanonymous and it would be possible to see the payments through third-party money\nlaunderers. The following is an example chat with the user ‘cyberhosting.ru’:\n```\nOn 2017-12-04 11:21\npowerfaer wrote to cyberhosting.ru\n And another question,\n can you exchange cash to BTC?\n\n```\nA challenge for us during the analysis was to understand the Russian underground slang.\nFor example, the term white accounting should be translated to Russian as Белая\nбухгалтерия. However, cybercriminals used the term белка, which in English means\n_squirrel. The same issue applies to other words like application, which translates to прила_\nin Russian and has no direct translation in English.\n\nAfter a deep OSINT analysis it was possible to infer a list of probable real names for the\nfollowing nicknames: ‘mirrexx777’, ‘powerfaer’, ‘cyberhosting.ru’, ‘taganchik.ru’,\n‘doktorsaitov’, ‘dmitrixxx89’, and ‘maximchik700’. However, the names will not be published\nsince their implication in the Geost operation has not been confirmed.\n\n## 8. Conclusion and future work\n\nThe discovery of the Geost Android banking botnet inside the traffic of another malware\nproxy shows that operational security is very hard to get right, and that simple mistakes can\nlead to deep understanding of the operations of malware authors. After the discovery of the\nGeost botmasters accessing their C&C servers it was possible to find more and more\npieces of their botnet infections, leading to a very large mapping of their attack\ninfrastructure, their APK binaries, the number of victims infected, and an estimation of the\neconomic size of the operation. Finally, it was possible to use open-source intelligence to\nrelate a group of developers to part of the infrastructure-building process of the botnet. The\ndevelopers do not seem to be the Geost botmasters, but an underground group related to\nthem\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite operating since at least 2016, the Geost botnet remained unknown until its traffic\nwas captured on the HtBot malware. This may suggest that the best OpSec may be to hide\noperations among thousands of other malware. However, once the operation was found, it\nwas clear that the group’s OpSec measures were not good since there were several\nmistakes that have led to information about the operation.\n\nThe following is a summary of the operational security mistakes that led to the identification\nand understanding of the botnet:\n\nUse of the illegal proxy network HtBot. Wrong estimation of the risk of using a service\nthat was being tracked in a security laboratory.\nFailure to encrypt C&C traffic. It was possible to identify the traffic and the content of\nthe communications.\nUse of the same protection service multiple times. This allowed repeated monitoring\nof the attackers and the capture of credentials.\nThe hiring of a group of developers with very low OpSec, who disclosed links, names\nand credentials in their chats.\nFailure to encrypting chats. This allowed a document to be leaked containing\nimportant information about the privacy of some attackers and leads about their\nidentities.\n\nThe amount of information collected on the Geost botnet was so large that it has not been\npossible to include all the details of the infrastructure, the victims found, banks accounts\ndisclosed, phones infected, credit cards used, and the very interesting view of the social\nrelationships within a group of underground cybercriminals. Therefore, our analysis of the\nGeost botnet will continue in several directions. The name ‘Geost’ was selected after the\nonly web page that didn’t seem to change in the C&C servers.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Veronica Valeros for her help during the analysis and extraction of\ninformation.
