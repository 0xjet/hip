If a�**\n\n**combination of social engineering, tweaks to widely-available malware and legit apps can do the trick,**\n\n**why bother to create something original and exquisite?**\n\n**Nevertheless there remain true adepts – those who perceive every cyberespionage operation as**\n\n**another stage in the quest for ultimate perfection. And, given the long and successful careers of some,**\n\n**they have good reason to stick with their own way of working.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Artistic Blackmailers\n\n**The Poseidon cyberespionage group very much fits this description. The group has been using state-�**\n\n**of-the-art custom malware since 2005, at least, and there’s data to suggest that some could have**\n\n**been prototyped as early as 2001. Different components of their toolsets appeared regularly on the**\n\n**radar of security companies, but were not recognized as part of a bigger picture. Throughout this**\n\n**period, Poseidon were meticulously tailoring their toolsets to ensure easy and silent entry and efficient**\n\n**data acquisition, in line with their patrons’ requirements. This perfectionist, artisan approach, together**\n\n**with the group’s known fascination with Greek mythology and their one-time abuse of a maritime**\n\n**satellite communications system, earned their operations the nickname ‘Poseidon’s APT Boutique’.**\n\n## A Touch of Artistry: Poseidon’s APT Boutique #PoseidonAPT\n\n**_[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkas.pr%2Fw9Ax&text=A+Touch+of+Artistry%3A+Poseidon%26%238217%3Bs+APT+Boutique+%23PoseidonAPT)_**\n\n**Setting aside their artistic finesse, some aspects of their ‘business model’ looked distinctly ugly.�**\n\n**Masquerading behind a front-end ‘security company’, they used harvested secrets to blackmail**\n\n**targets into accepting them as IT security contractors. Meanwhile, they either retained an illegitimate**\n\n**presence within the ‘secured’ system or, having completed the task agreed, quietly resumed their**\n\n**presence within the perimeter They were known to refer to one element their business cycle as**\n\n\n**_[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkas.pr%2Fw9Ax&text=A+Touch+of+Artistry%3A+Poseidon%26%238217%3Bs+APT+Boutique+%23PoseidonAPT)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**presence. With their focus on Windows-based systems and extremely developed skills, they could**\n\n**theoretically embed themselves within the victim’s IT system for years without being detected.**\n\n#### Great Art Demands Sacrifices�\n\n**The Poseidon’s targets have tended to be large Enterprises, mainly centering round Brazil, the US,**\n\n**France, Kazakhstan and Russia. There appears an interesting language limitation to English and**\n\n**Brazilian Portuguese based systems: even in countries with different national languages, the IT**\n\n**networks of multi-national corporations having these locales and/or keyboard layouts were preferred**\n\n**as targets. Their sphere of interest has encompassed Energy and Utilities, Manufacturing – and also**\n\n**Media and PR. The latter two could obviously provide attackers with plenty of information for use as**\n\n**ammunition against additional future targets.**\n\n## The Poseidon’s targets have tended to be large Enterprises #PoseidonAPT\n\n**_[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkas.pr%2Fw9Ax&text=The+Poseidon%26%238217%3Bs+targets+have+tended+to+be+large+Enterprises+%23PoseidonAPT)_**\n\n#### Tools of the Artisan’s Trade\n\n**To many an artisan eye, elegance and simplicity go hand by hand. The Poseidon group seem to**\n\n\n**_[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkas.pr%2Fw9Ax&text=The+Poseidon%26%238217%3Bs+targets+have+tended+to+be+large+Enterprises+%23PoseidonAPT)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**To fool existing security solutions, they often sign these binaries with real certificates – issued for fake�**\n\n**companies or even belonging to genuine well-respected and trusted organizations. Having**\n\n**successfully infecting their first victims, the collection of extensive data about the attacked�**\n\n**infrastructure begins. Using this information, and ace Windows admin skills, the attackers can then**\n\n**move laterally without triggering any alarms, their next objective being to obtain Domain Admin rights.**\n\n**With this level of power, they can then purge the majority of their own tools from the network,**\n\n**retaining only those essential to their ongoing presence and data exfiltration.�**\n\n**As already mentioned, in one series of operations Poseidon used ships’ satellite communication**\n\n**systems as hiding places for their Command & Control (C&C) servers, a similar mechanism to that**\n\n**used by the Turla actor. No attempts to repeat this feat have, however, been recorded.**\n\n#### What Can Be Done?\n\n**Despite all Poseidon’s attempts to disguise and disperse the evidence, experts from Kaspersky Lab’s**\n\n**Global Research and Analysis Team have succeeded in piecing all the disparate pieces of data into a**\n\n**complete picture. Still, the Poseidon group remains active, which brings us to the question of**\n\n**adequate defense.**\n\n**Of course protecting endpoints is a must – which, as the well-known** **[ASD Mitigation Strategies](https://securelist.com/threats/strategies-for-mitigating-advanced-persistent-threats-apts-4/)**\n\n**suggest, should comprise non-signature detection mechanisms, such as Heuristics and Behavioral**\n\n**[Detection Algorithms. Possessing all these, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business is powered by](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/endpoint-advanced)**\n\n**the same superior Security Intelligence that enabled our experts to piece together the previously**\n\n\n-----\n\n**real-time global intelligence from the Kaspersky Security Network. These layers erect further barriers**\n\n**in the path of malware, from blocking launch attempts to preventing access to critical system**\n\n**elements and communications with C&C.**\n\n**The extent of information harvesting by the Poseidon group also highlights the benefits of Data�**\n\n**Encryption throughout the whole corporate infrastructure, enforced by appropriate policies. The**\n\n**[Advanced tier of Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business includes easy-to-use Encryption](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/endpoint-advanced)**\n\n**Technology, managed through the same single-pane-of-glass console of Kaspersky Security Center**\n\n**as all platform elements. Of course, with spear-phishing as the penetration method of choice for the**\n\n**majority of Targated Attack groups, scanning email streams is also absolutely crucial nowadays.**\n\n**[Kaspersky Security for Mail Servers erects another powerful defensive wall in the attacker’s way.](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/mail-server)**\n\n**All in all, Kaspersky Lab’s portfolio of solutions helps implement 19 of ASD’s 35 Mitigation Strategies,**\n\n**including 3 of the ‘top 4’ which between them prevent 85% Targeted Attack-related incidents. But**\n\n**even if you use another vendor’s solutions to protect your infrastructure, we can help. Kaspersky**\n\n**Lab’s achievements as APT discoverers demonstrate that the presence even of such a stealthy and**\n\n**[capable APT actor as Poseidon can be uncovered; that’s what our Targeted Attack Discovery service](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/entrp/solutions/security-intelligence-services)**\n\n**is for[1].**\n\n**Secrets are worth most when they’re sold red hot.
