A key feature of TrickBot is its\nability to manipulate web sessions by intercepting network traffic before it is rendered by a\nvictim's browser. TrickBot has targeted hundreds of organizations, mostly financial\n\n\n-----\n\ninstitutions, since it began widespread operation in October 2016. In August 2019, the\ndynamic webinjects used by TrickBot were augmented to include the following U.S.-based\nmobile carriers:\n\nAugust 5: Verizon Wireless\nAugust 12: T-Mobile\nAugust 19: Sprint\n\nWhen a victim navigates to the website of one of these organizations, the legitimate server\nresponse is intercepted by TrickBot and proxied through a command and control (C2) server.\nThis C2 server injects additional HTML and JavaScript into the page, which is then rendered\nin the victim's web browser. For all three carriers, injected code causes an additional form\nfield that requests the user’s PIN code, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.\n\n_Figure 1. TrickBot modified form (left) and original form (right) for Verizon Wireless. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Additional PIN form added to Sprint sign-in page after username and password_\n_entry. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe injected code shown in Figure 3 activates TrickBot’s record (rcrd) functionality. This\nfunctionality creates an additional HTTP request containing the victim’s username, password,\nand PIN that is transmitted to the TrickBot C2 server. These “recordings” are presented to\nTrickBot operators as they browse through infected hosts in their web panel.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Injected JavaScript in T-Mobile sign-in page. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe targeting of mobile PIN codes by GOLD BLACKBURN, or by affiliated threat actors\n[using TrickBot, suggests an interest in perpetrating port-out or](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/how-to-fight-mobile-number-port-out-scams/) [SIM swap fraud. This fraud](https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/)\nallows an attacker to assume control of a victim’s telephone number, including all inbound\nand outbound text and voice communications. The interception of short message service\n(SMS)-based authentication tokens or password resets is frequently used during account\ntakeover (ATO) fraud.\n\n[CTU™ researchers recommend that organizations use time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)\n(TOTP) multi-factor authentication (MFA) rather than SMS MFA when feasible. Similarly,\ntelephone numbers should not be used as password reset options on important accounts.\n[Enabling a PIN on mobile accounts remains a prudent anti-fraud measure that requires an](https://clark.com/scams-rip-offs/sim-hijacking-how-to-add-pin-mobile-phone/)\nattacker to possess an additional piece of information about their intended victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note\nthat IP addresses can be reallocated. The IP addresses may contain malicious content, so\nconsider the risks before opening them in a browser.\n\nIndicator TYPE Context\n\n194.87.95.132 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n194.36.189.170 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n185.202.174.77 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n195.123.240.170 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n192.3.146.249 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n107.174.14.178 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n172.106.86.4 IP address TrickBot dynamic webinjects proxy C2 server\n\n_Table 1.
