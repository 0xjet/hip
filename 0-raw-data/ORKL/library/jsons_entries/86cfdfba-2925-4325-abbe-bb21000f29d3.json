This post provides details on five different campaigns\nconducted from April to August 2022 by a threat actor whose activities overlap with a group\n[CERT-UA tracks as UAC-0098 [1,](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39609) [2,](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39708) [3]. Based on multiple indicators, TAG assesses some](https://cert.gov.ua/article/339662)\nmembers of UAC-0098 are former members of the Conti cybercrime group repurposing their\ntechniques to target Ukraine.\n\nUAC-0098 is a threat actor that historically delivered the IcedID banking trojan, leading to\nhuman-operated ransomware attacks. The attacker has recently shifted their focus to\ntargeting Ukrainian organizations, the Ukrainian government, and European humanitarian\nand non-profit organizations. TAG assesses UAC-0098 acted as an initial access broker for\nvarious ransomware groups including Quantum and Conti, a Russian cybercrime gang\nknown as FIN12 / WIZARD SPIDER.\n\n\n-----\n\nTAG is sharing additional context and indicators, including disclosing new campaigns that\nweren’t previously detailed or attributed to the group, to assist the security community in\nefforts to investigate and defend against this threat.\n\n## Initial Encounter\n\nTAG started actively tracking UAC-0098 after identifying an email phishing campaign\n[delivering AnchorMail (referred to as “LackeyBuilder”) in late April 2022. AnchorMail is a](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/new-malware-trickbot-anchordns-backdoor-upgrades-anchormail/)\nversion of the Anchor backdoor that uses the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTPS) for\ncommand and control (C2) communication. The tool, assessed to be developed by the Conti\ngroup, previously was installed as a TrickBot module. TAG was able to connect the activity to\nearlier phishing emails targeting Ukraine with lures like:\n\nSubject: Проєкт «Активні громадяни» (Project \"Active citizen\")\n\nSubject: Файл_змінив,_бронь (File_change,_booking)\n\nURLs:\n\nhttps://activecitizens[.]in[.]ua/Project1[.]xls\n\nhttps://lviv[.]uz[.]ua/Artists[.]xls\n\nhttps://aprize[.]com[.]ua/Artists[.]xls\n\nThe campaign stood out because it appeared to be both financially and politically motivated.\nIt also seemed experimental: instead of dropping AnchorMail directly, it used LackeyBuilder\nand batch scripts to build AnchorMail on the fly.\n\nThe UAC-0098 activity was then identified in another email campaign delivering IcedID and\nCobalt Strike. On April 13, at least three Excel files were sent as attachments to Ukrainian\norganizations:\n\nМобілізаційний реєстр.xls (Mobilization register.xls)\n\n[8f7e3471c1bb2b264d1b8f298e7b7648dac84ffd8fb2125f3b2566353128e127](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8f7e3471c1bb2b264d1b8f298e7b7648dac84ffd8fb2125f3b2566353128e127)\nМобілізаційний список.xls Mobilization list.xls\n[08d30d6646117cd96320447042fb3857b4f82d80a92f31ee91b16044b87929c0](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/08d30d6646117cd96320447042fb3857b4f82d80a92f31ee91b16044b87929c0)\nСписок мобілізованих громадян.xls List of mobilized citizens.xls\n[1f3c5dd0a79323c57ad194a49eebaaf2f624822df401995e51a4c58b5a607a45](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1f3c5dd0a79323c57ad194a49eebaaf2f624822df401995e51a4c58b5a607a45)\n\nThe group was active from mid-April to mid-June of 2022, frequently changing its tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs), tooling and lures. While the targeting varied from\ncampaign to campaign, the group repeatedly targeted Ukrainian hotels.\n\n## Impersonating National Cyber Police of Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 11 2022, UAC-0098 launched another attack targeting organizations working in the\nhospitality industry. The phishing emails were impersonating the National Cyber Police of\nUkraine and contained a download link, urging targets to download an update for their\noperating system.\n\nThe payload was hosted on https://cyberpolice.gov.uz[.]ua/article/KB5012599.msi, where\ngov.uz[.]ua, which is an attacker-controlled domain, registered just one day before the\nattack. During execution, the file runs a PowerShell script downloaded from\nhttp://blinkin[.]top/3538313546/license?serial={GENERATED_SERIAL} to fetch and execute\nan IcedID dll:\n\nIndicators\n\nhttps://drive.google[.]com/file/d/19ZtX3k38g2OXQnFkEj3JH4EiI_vUqgnK/view?\nusp=drive_web\ngov[.]uz[.]ua\nblinkin[.]top\nkirbi[.]top\n\n## Expanded targeting to European NGOs using “Stolen Images Evidence”\n\nOn May 17, UAC-0098 used a compromised account of a hotel in India. The actor sent\nphishing emails with a ZIP archive attached containing a malicious XLL file. As before, the\ntargets appeared to be organizations working in the hospitality industry in Ukraine.\n\nWhen opened, the XLL file downloads a variant of IcedID from the following URL:\nhttp://84.32.190[.]34/KB2533623.exe.\n\nIn other campaigns, the same compromised email account was used to target humanitarian\nNGOs in Italy. IcedID was also delivered as an MSI file through the anonymous file sharing\nservice dropfiles[.]me, with expiring links to the payload and a malware distribution service\nknown as [Stolen Images Evidence. This service typically uses website contact forms to send](https://thedfirreport.com/2022/04/04/stolen-images-campaign-ends-in-conti-ransomware/)\nfake legal or copyright violation threats with a link to storage hosting a social engineering\npage, delivering malware chosen by the service’s customer.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Stolen Images Evidence” distribution service delivering UAC-0098 payload\n\n“dropfiles[.]me” file sharing website delivering UAC-0098 payload\n\nIndicators\n\nhttps://dropfiles[.]me/download/af46b89ae667c0d0/\nhttp://storage.googleapis[.]com/cor1krp299kh13.appspot[.]com/\nhttp://storage.googleapis[.]com/xpd9q3z05awvw4.appspot[.]com/\nhttp://84.32.190[.]34/KB2533623.exe\ndonaldtr[.]com\n\n## Impersonating StarLink and Microsoft\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 19, UAC-0098 used support@starlinkua[.]info to send phishing emails\nimpersonating representatives of Elon Musk and StarLink, in order to deliver software\nrequired to connect to the internet using StarLink satellites. The email included a link to\nhttps://box[.]starlinkua[.]info/cloud/index[.]php/s/{GENERATED_ID}, an MSI installer dropping\nIcedID, downloaded from the attacker-controlled domain, starlinkua[.]info.\n\nOn May 23, a similar attack was performed against a wider range of Ukrainian organizations\noperating in the technology, retail and government sectors. The delivered payload was the\nsame IcedID binary with filename KB2533623.msi to resemble a Microsoft update and was\nhosted on https://box[.]microsoftua[.]com/cloud/index[.]php/s/{GENERATED_ID}.\n\nIndicators\n\nsupport@starlinkua[.]info\nstarlinkua[.]info\nmicrosoftua[.]com\nbaiden[.]top\n\n## Cobalt Strike delivered by malicious documents built by EtterSilent builder\n\nOn May 24, a newly registered domain kompromatua[.]info was used to target the Academy\nof Ukrainian Press (AUP). The phishing email contained a dropbox link pointing to a\nmalicious document named “ABR090TAN-TS.xlsb”. The Excel document was created using\nEtterSilent, a malicious document builder used by many cybercrime groups. The malicious\ndocument directly fetched a Cobalt Strike dll from http://84.32.190[.]34/bc_https_x64.dll.\nNote, the same IP was used to deliver IcedID payloads in the second campaign on May 17.\nThe attacker used the same link and the same file to target organizations from the hospitality\nindustry.\n\nIndicators\n\njurnalist@kompromatua[.]info\nkompromatua[.]info\n84.32.190[.]34\n\n## Follina Exploitation\n\nOn June 10, a few days after the CVE-2022-30190 (also known as Follina) disclosure, a\nweaponized exploit named clickme.rtf was uploaded to VirusTotal. Upon execution, the file\nfetched content from http://64.190.113[.]51/index[.]html. At that time, no content was\ndelivered from the URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nNine days later, the same server was used, this time using port 8000, to serve content in a\nlarge-scale campaign exploiting the same vulnerability. On June 19, TAG disrupted a\ncampaign with more than 10,000 spam emails impersonating the State Tax Service of\nUkraine. The emails had an attached ZIP file containing a malicious RTF file. Upon\nexecution, the next stage was downloaded from http://64.190.113[.]51:8000/index.html. This\n[campaign was previously reported by CERT-UA and TAG’s](https://cert.gov.ua/article/339662) [update on cyber activity in](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/continued-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe-observed-by-tag/)\nEastern Europe.\n\nPhishing email used in a campaign exploiting CVE-2022-30190, translated from Ukrainian\n\nThe html file fetched Cobalt Strike, ked.dll, from 5.199.173[.]152. Shared code in the Cobalt\nStrike payload and IcedID suggests they are both encrypted with the same crypting service\n[made by Conti group. This is aligned with IBM Security X-Force findings.](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-group-systematically-attacking-ukraine/)\n\nIndicators\n\nhttp://64.190.113[.]51:8000/index[.]html\nhttp://5.199.173[.]152/ked[.]dll\nbaidenfree[.]com\n\n## Conclusions\n\nUAC-0098 activities are representative examples of blurring lines between financially\nmotivated and government backed groups in Eastern Europe, illustrating a trend of threat\nactors changing their targeting to align with regional geopolitical interests.\n\nIn the initial encounter with UAC-0098, “lackeyBuilder” was observed for the first time. This is\na previously undisclosed builder for AnchorMail, one of the private backdoors used by the\nConti groups. Since then, the actor consistently used tools and services traditionally\nemployed by cybercrime actors for the purpose of acquiring initial access: IcedID trojan,\nEtterSilent malicious document builder, and the “Stolen Image Evidence” social engineering\nmalware distribution service.\n\nIn the activity observed following April 2022, the group’s targeting wildly varied from\nEuropean NGOs to less targeted attacks on Ukrainian government entities, organizations\nand individuals. Rather uniquely, the group demonstrates strong interest in breaching\n\n\n-----\n\nbusinesses operating in the hospitality industry of Ukraine, going as far as launching multiple\ndistinct campaigns against the same hotel chains. So far, TAG has not identified what postexploitation actions UAC-0098 takes following a successful compromise.\n\n[Activities described in this post are consistent with findings from IBM Security X-Force and](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-group-systematically-attacking-ukraine/)\n[CERT-UA. TAG can further confirm attribution based on multiple overlaps between UAC-](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39708)\n0098 and Trickbot or the Conti cybercrime group.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
