It has been officially\nconfirmed that about 18,000 users may have installed backdoored versions of SolarWinds.\nStill, there is limited information on the number of organizations where the attack has evolved\nand second-stage tools may have been deployed, though there are some speculations on\n[the actor’s interest based on an analysis of the historical C2 DNS response (see here and](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\n[here).](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.truesec.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2Fthe-solarwinds-orion-sunburst-supply-chain-attack%2F)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were specifically interested in analyzing how many industrial organizations used\nbackdoored SolarWinds versions and fell victim to the attack. The results of the analysis are\nbelow.\n\nFirst of all, we analyzed all available decoded internal domain names obtained from DNS\nnames generated by the SunBurst DomainName Generation Algorithm using some publicly\navailable lists and third-party lists. The final list of readable and attributable domains\nconsisted of nearly 2000 domain names and information on the industries in which possibly\ncompromised industrial organizations operate is provided below:\n\nThe overall percentage of industrial organizations among all organizations on the list is\nestimated at 32.4%.\n\nWe also analysed user information from our telemetry where the backdoored SolarWinds\napplications were installed and distinguished over 20 organizations in the industrial sector:\n\nmanufacturing 8\n\ntransportation & logistics 6\n\nutilities 4\n\nconstruction 4\n\nmining 3\n\nenergy 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe geographical distribution of the industrial organizations is broad and includes the\nfollowing countries and territories: Benin, Canada, Chile, Djibouti, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia,\nMexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Uganda,\nand the USA. At the same time, the geography of all victims covers almost the entire world,\nfrom North America to APAC.\n\nThe SolarWinds software is highly integrated into many systems around the globe in different\nindustries. We currently have no evidence that any of the industrial organizations in our\n[telemetry had an escalation from the attackers. Truesec provided a list of possible second-](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.truesec.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2Fthe-solarwinds-orion-sunburst-supply-chain-attack%2F)\nstage victims, which included several industrial organizations headquartered in different\ncountries, based on responses received from a server used by the threat actor. Thus, we\nshouldn’t rule out the possibility of wider activity in some of the industrial networks if it is in\nline with the actor’s interests.\n\nHere are our recommendations for possible victims of the SolarWinds compromise:\n\n1. Check whether backdoored SolarWinds versions are installed. Known affected versions\n\n[include software builds 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 with no hotfix installed, and 2020.2 HF1.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.solarwinds.com%2Fsecurityadvisory)\n[2. Check for known indicators of compromise (IOCs). CISA has published Alert AA20-35A](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fus-cert.cisa.gov%2Fncas%2Falerts%2Faa20-352a)\n\nwith an extensive list\n3. If you have detected a compromised SolarWinds installation or related IOCs, initiate a\n\nsecurity incident investigation and launch an incident response procedure, considering\nall possible attack vectors:\n\n1. Isolate assets that are known to be compromised, while keeping the system\n\noperable\n2. Prevent IOCs that could be useful for the investigation from being deleted\n3. Check all network logs for suspicious network activity\n4. Check system logs and journals for illegitimate user account authentication\n5. Locate suspicious process activity, investigate memory dumps and associated\n\nfiles\n6. Check historical command-line data associated with suspicious activity\n4.
