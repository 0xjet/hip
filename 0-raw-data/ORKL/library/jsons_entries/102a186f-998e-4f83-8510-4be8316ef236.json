The attacker can exploit without authentication although\nsignup is disabled by default\n\n[Mass scan already start and bug bounty hunters are farming it 🙂#RCE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RCE?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Confluence](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Confluence?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/C0JfIEYPhb](https://t.co/C0JfIEYPhb)\n\n[— Tuan Anh Nguyen 0 (@haxor31337) August 31, 2021](https://twitter.com/haxor31337/status/1432731786719551489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSoon after mass exploitation was spotted in the wild, two security researchers, Rahul\nMaini and [Harsh Jaiswal, also published an in-depth explanation of the bug on GitHub, which](https://twitter.com/rootxharsh)\nalso included several proof-of-concept payloads.\n\nIn a [tweet, Maini described the process of developing the CVE-2021-26084 exploit as](https://twitter.com/iamnoooob/status/1431739398782025728)\n“relatively simpler than expected,” effectively confirming why the bug received its high 9.8\nseverity score.\n\n[Just did Atlassian Confluence UnAuth RCE CVE-2021-26084 along with @rootxharsh.](https://twitter.com/rootxharsh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nIt was relatively simpler than expected 😀 [pic.twitter.com/7hpHt76AES](https://t.co/7hpHt76AES)\n\n[— Rahul Maini (@iamnoooob) August 28, 2021](https://twitter.com/iamnoooob/status/1431739398782025728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWith [Confluence being a wildly popular team collaboration software inside some of the](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)\nworld’s largest corporations, and with the CVE-2021-26084 vulnerability being extremely\npowerful from a threat actor’s perspective, attacks from criminal groups are expected to ramp\nup in the following days.\n\nConfluence bugs have been widely weaponized before, so a similar exploitation pattern is\nexpected this time as well.\n\nOn its website, Atlassian claims that Confluence is used by more than 60,000 customers,\nincluding the likes of Audi, Hubspot, NASA, LinkedIn, Twilio, and Docker.\n\nTags\n\n[Atlassian](https://therecord.media/tag/atlassian/)\n[Confluence](https://therecord.media/tag/confluence/)\n[CVE-2021-26084](https://therecord.media/tag/cve-2021-26084/)\n[exploit](https://therecord.media/tag/exploit/)\n[exploitation](https://therecord.media/tag/exploitation/)\n[proof-of-concept](https://therecord.media/tag/proof-of-concept/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
