Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on\nthe dark underbelly of the internet.\n\n[See More →](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber)\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has shut down infrastructure and accounts linked to Israeli\nsurveillance vendor NSO Group, Amazon said in a statement.\n\nThe move comes as a group of media outlets and activist organizations published new\nresearch into NSO's malware and phone numbers potentially selected for targeting by NSO's\ngovernment clients\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we learned of this activity, we acted quickly to shut down the relevant infrastructure\nand accounts,\" an AWS spokesperson told Motherboard in an email.\n\n[Amnesty International published a forensic investigation on Sunday that, among other things,](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\ndetermined that NSO customers have had access to zero-day attacks in Apple's iMessage\nas recently as this year. As part of that research, Amnesty wrote that a phone infected with\nNSO's Pegasus malware sent information \"to a service fronted by Amazon CloudFront,\nsuggesting NSO Group has switched to using AWS services in recent months.\" The Amnesty\nreport included part of the same statement from Amazon, showing Amnesty contacted the\ncompany before publication.\n\n[Citizen Lab, in a peer review of Amnesty's findings, said in its own post that the group](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/amnesty-peer-review/)\n\"independently observed NSO Group begin to make extensive use of Amazon services\nincluding CloudFront in 2021.\"\n\n**_Do you work at NSO Group, did you used to, or do you know anything else about_**\n**_the company? We'd love to hear from you.

The\nmove to CloudFront also protects NSO somewhat from researchers or other third parties\ntrying to unearth the company's infrastructure.\n\n\"The use of cloud services protects NSO Group from some Internet scanning techniques,\"\nAmnesty's report added.\n\nAmazon has previously remained silent on NSO using its infrastructure. In May 2020 when\nMotherboard uncovered evidence that NSO had used Amazon infrastructure to deliver\nmalware, Amazon did not respond to a request for comment asking if NSO had violated\nAmazon's terms of service.\n\nThe Amnesty report said NSO is also using services from other companies such as Digital\nOcean, OVH, and Linode.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Sunday, journalistic organization Forbidden Stories and its media partners published a\nseries of stories based in part on a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers that were\nallegedly selected by NSO's clients for potential surveillance.\n\nIn [a statement to The Guardian, NSO said \"NSO does not operate the systems that it sells to](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments)\nvetted government customers, and does not have access to the data of its customers’\ntargets. NSO does not operate its technology, does not collect, nor possesses, nor has any\naccess to any kind of data of its customers. Due to contractual and national security\nconsiderations, NSO cannot confirm or deny the identity of our government customers, as\nwell as identity of customers of which we have shut down systems.\"\n\n**_Subscribe to our cybersecurity podcast,_** **_[CYBER.](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2)_**\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
