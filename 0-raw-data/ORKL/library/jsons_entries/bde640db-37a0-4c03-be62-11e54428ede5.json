This blog provides an\nupdate on all infrastructure we have observed since that time – focusing on the period 1st\nNovember 2020 to 15th January 2021. As previously, we continue to share details of our\ninvestigations, including victim details, with CERT.br.\n\nIn December 2020, we posted details of four GhostDNS Rogue DNS servers on our twitter\npage.\n\nThese four servers were identified using queries for the string dnscfg.cgi?dnsPrimary=\nbefore being cross-referenced against other datasets – confirming them as GhostDNS\ninfrastructure:\n\n149.56.152.185 (OVH, FR)\n\n167.114.138.250 (OVH, FR)\n\n192.95.59.130 (OVH, FR)\n\n51.81.27.247 (OVH, FR)\n\n**Note: All four IP addresses are assigned to OVH, FR – however, the first three geolocate to**\nBrazil and the remaining IP address (51.81.27.247) geolocates to the United States.\n\nIn identifying these Rogue DNS servers, we also observed 55 IP addresses being used by\nthreat actors to update the DNS settings of vulnerable routers. We [previously defined these](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2020/09/08/ghostdnsbusters/)\nIP addresses as Changer IP addresses – a full list of all identified infrastructure is provided\nat the end of this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nReturning to the four previously referenced Rogue DNS servers and repeating the\nmethodology outlined in our previous blogs, we pivoted on potential victim IP addresses\n(specifically looking at UDP/53 traffic) in order to identify additional candidate Rogue DNS\nservers.\n\nIn total 14 Rogue DNS servers were identified being queried by potential victims during our\nperiod of interest (1st November 2020 to 15th January 2021), of which nine did not appear in\nour previous blogs.\n\nThe below timeline provides an overview of when these Rogue DNS servers were ‘active’ –\nbased on first and last seen timestamps.\n\nHTTP Phishing Infrastructure\n\nIn our [second GhostDNS blog, we examined the HTTP phishing infrastructure element of the](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2020/10/07/ghostdnsbusters-part-2/)\nattack cycle, providing an x.509 certificate being used by one distinct GhostDNS threat group\n(CDD):\n\nSHA1 – 8D9B394BA67D1913566115094C1AD0257FEFF26E\n\nDuring our period of interest, we observed two IP addresses hosting this certificate:\n\n45.62.198.176 (most recently 24th December 2020)\n\n45.62.198.69 (most recently 2nd November 2020)\n\nIn addition to the IP addresses hosting the x.509 certificate, a further HTTP phishing server\n(68.183.245.48) was identified based on passive DNS data for Rogue DNS server\n192.95.59.130.\n\nIn this image, some of the sites/brands targeted by GhostDNS are evident – including\nFacebook and Netflix.\n\n\n-----\n\nThree further HTTP phishing servers were identified based on DNS queries performed\nduring the course of writing this blog – and therefore represent the most recent infrastructure:\n\n144.217.105.149\n\n47.88.76.58\n\n18.197.159.147\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n**Note: The below IOCs were all observed during the period 1st November 2020 – 15th**\nJanuary 2021 and include some IOCs which were shared in our previous blogs.\n\n**HTTP Phishing servers [6]**\n\n144.217.105.149\n\n18.197.159.147\n\n45.62.198.176\n\n45.62.198.69\n\n47.88.76.58\n\n68.183.245.48\n\n**Rogue DNS servers [18]**\n\n107.155.152.20\n\n149.56.152.185\n\n158.69.37.88\n\n167.114.138.250\n\n\n-----\n\n192.95.42.19\n\n192.95.59.130\n\n192.95.63.156\n\n3.131.142.96\n\n45.62.198.242\n\n45.62.198.243\n\n45.62.198.50\n\n45.62.198.54\n\n45.62.198.73\n\n45.62.198.74\n\n45.62.198.89\n\n51.81.101.114\n\n51.81.27.247\n\n51.81.28.240\n\n**Changer IP addresses [55]**\n\n104.248.84.36\n\n134.122.17.197\n\n134.122.20.72\n\n134.209.114.117\n\n134.209.119.201\n\n134.209.119.215\n\n134.209.194.227\n\n134.209.208.12\n\n134.209.208.32\n\n134.209.208.34\n\n\n-----\n\n134.209.208.60\n\n134.209.208.89\n\n134.209.208.90\n\n134.209.208.91\n\n142.93.7.241\n\n157.245.240.62\n\n157.245.253.224\n\n157.245.80.115\n\n157.245.87.63\n\n157.245.95.131\n\n157.245.95.198\n\n159.65.197.126\n\n159.65.197.220\n\n159.65.197.67\n\n159.65.197.70\n\n159.65.202.16\n\n159.65.228.195\n\n159.65.228.2\n\n159.65.228.60\n\n159.65.228.79\n\n159.65.236.178\n\n159.89.84.50\n\n161.35.113.178\n\n161.35.113.198\n\n162.243.14.132\n\n\n-----\n\n165.22.199.47\n\n167.172.39.220\n\n167.71.73.30\n\n168.61.52.32\n\n178.62.254.221\n\n188.166.104.122\n\n188.166.104.148\n\n188.166.105.104\n\n188.166.31.41\n\n188.166.38.126\n\n188.166.90.70\n\n191.252.178.203\n\n192.241.150.141\n\n192.241.165.214\n\n192.81.214.228\n\n198.211.110.224\n\n51.81.53.144\n\n51.81.53.171\n\n64.227.10.49\n\n64.227.22.224\n\n\n-----",
