First](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/Ransomware)\n[discovered in March 2020, Nefilim threatens to release victims’ stolen data to coerce them into paying the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/nefilim-ransomware-threatens-to-expose-stolen-data)\nransom. Aside from its use of this tactic, another notable characteristic of Nefilim is its similarity to Nemty; in\nfact, it is believed to be an evolved version of the older ransomware.\n\nWe provide a brief analysis of this active ransomware and how to defend systems against it.\n\nTechnical Details\n\n_Initial access_\n\nFor its initial access, threat actors behind Nefilim make use of various affiliates to spread their malware.\nThese affiliates use various methods. Based on previous attacks, Nefilim has been largely known to reach\nsystems via exposed RDPs. Some affiliates also use other known vulnerabilities for initial access. This is\n[supported by various reports, from which we found the use of the Citrix vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781), an](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\nunsecure and brute-force RDP, to enter a system.\n\nNefilim has also been seen using party tools to gather credentials that include Mimikatz, LaZagne,\nand NirSoft’s NetPass. The stolen credentials are used to reach high-value machines like servers.\n\nOnce inside a victim system, the ransomware begins to drop and execute its components such as antiantivirus, exfiltration tools, and finally Nefilim itself.\n\n_Lateral movement on the network_\n\nThe attackers make use of several legitimate tools for lateral movement. For example, it uses PsExec or\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for lateral movement, dropping and executing other\ncomponents including the ransomware itself. Nefilim has been observed to use a batch file for terminating\ncertain processes and services It even uses third-party tools like PC Hunter Process\n\n\n-----\n\nHacker, and Revo Uninstaller to terminate antivirus-related processes, services, and applications. It also\nuses AdFind, BloodHound, or SMBTool to identify active directories and/or machines that are connected to\nthe domain.\n\n_Data exfiltration_\n\nA notable aspect of recent ransomware variants are their data exfiltration capabilities. As for Nefilim, it has\nbeen observed to copy data from servers or shared directories to a local directory and to archive these\nusing 7-Zip. It then uses MEGAsync to exfiltrate this data.\n\nDefending systems against ransomware\n\nCampaigns that are similar to Nefilim spend a lot of time between the initial breach and the start of serious\nlateral movement. However, as soon as lateral movement begins, threat actors work quickly. They prioritize\nmoving between hosts and exfiltrating data. Therefore, organizations can consider limiting the number of\ncomputers that can be leveraged during a lateral movement phase. This involves solutions such as\nutilizing two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever they can, implementing application safelisting, and\npracticing least privilege security.\n\nWith regard to defending systems against the threat of Nefilim, best practices still apply. It is best to work on\ndefenses that prevent the lateral movement of similar attacks. Organizations should consider the use of\ncanary file-based monitoring, encryption monitoring, and process killing. Other best practices to review\ninclude the following:\n\nAvoid opening unverified emails or clicking on their embedded links, as these can start the\nransomware installation process.\nBack up your important files using the 3-2-1 rule: Create three backup copies on two different file\nformats, with one of the backups in a separate location.\nRegularly update software, programs, and applications to ensure that your apps are current, with the\nlatest protections from new vulnerabilities.\n\n[If you believe that your organization has been affected by this campaign, visit this page for the available](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000285717)\nTrend Micro solutions that can help detect and mitigate any risks from this campaign.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nSHA256 Detection name\n\n08c7dfde13ade4b13350ae290616d7c2f4a87cbeac9a3886e90a175ee40fb641 [Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.A](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ransom.win32.nefilim.a/)\n\n205ddcd3469193139e4b93c8f76ed6bdbbf5108e7bcd51b48753c22ee6202765 Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.D\n\n5da71f76b9caea411658b43370af339ca20d419670c755b9c1bfc263b78f07f1 Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.D\n\n7a73032ece59af3316c4a64490344ee111e4cb06aaf00b4a96c10adfdd655599 Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.C\n\neacbf729bb96cf2eddac62806a555309d08a705f6084dd98c7cf93503927c34f [Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.G](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.G)\n\nee9ea85d37aa3a6bdc49a6edf39403d041f2155d724bd0659e6884746ea3a250 Trojan.Win64.NEFILIM.A\n\nf51f128bca4dc6b0aa2355907998758a2e3ac808f14c30eb0b0902f71b04e3d5 Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.D\n\nfdaefa45c8679a161c6590b8f5bb735c12c9768172f81c930bb68c93a53002f7 Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.D\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware\n\nNefilim is known for its double extortion capabilities and notable attacks in 2020.
