Events of\nthe recent past show that even world-renowned enterprise, financial and IT giants are not\nimmune to data leaks. Equifax, British Airways, SingHealth, Marriott International, Sephora,\nCanva, Zynga, Microsoft, Tokopedia, T-Mobile, Linkedin, Twitch — these are just a few\nnames that have been spotted in high-profile data breach scandals in the past several years.\nОne would hardly attempt to question if these companies had enough resources to ensure\ntheir security, but here is the fact — they all did fall victim to cyberattacks.\n\nEven if the company's data was leaked not as a result of its own actions, but rather the\nactions of its contractor or a partner with which it shared data, the result will be the same.\nData leaks can both disclose sensitive information about the company's internal processes\naffecting business decisions or reputation and personal data of the company's customers,\nmaking them turn their back on a brand or company that used to be their favorite. Both\noutcomes can bring the business at the verge of collapse, which is why one of the first\ninstincts of breached companies, burning from thirst for revenge, is to find attackers behind\nthe network compromise and data leak to dispense justice.\n\nThese data leaks can often end in the shadow part of the Internet. Underground resources,\nwhich are closed to unauthorized visitors, are rife with discussions that are directly related to\nplanned or previously committed crimes. These resource regulars are attackers themselves,\ntheir accomplices looking for an opportunity to make some money, but also visitors who have\ntheir own agenda, though, distinct from others. This is the case for employees of law\nenforcement agencies and special services, as well as corporate and private security\nspecialists. Under the guise of bad guys, they collect cyber intelligence data and research\nand analyze criminal activity in order to investigate and prevent cybercrimes.\n\nAn average underground forum has huge volumes of daily text messages going through it,\nwhich makes analyzing this information manually almost impossible and also ineffective.\nAlgorithm development and machine learning (hereinafter - ML) implementation can break\nthis stalemate, significantly reducing the amount of manual work and enabling analysts to\nconnect the dots in the tremendous amount of data.\n\nThis article aims to show the methods cybersecurity analysts who come to the aid of\ncompromised companies in such cases can use to, firstly, determine if an alleged data\nbreach did take place and a database put up for sale in the dark web was authentic, and,\nsecondly, identify the threat actor responsible. It demonstrates how machine learning\nalgorithms can facilitate the processes of cyber intelligence data analysis and cyber\ninvestigations, while at the same time further enriching its results. And if it happens that you\nsomehow embarked on the path of investigating a data leak, this guide will give you the\nideas from what to begin and how to further proceed.\n\nThis guide is intended for:\n\n\n-----\n\ncybersecurity greeners who are doing their first steps in the cybersecurity world. Even if\nnot all the terms and techniques described in the text are familiar to you, you can get\nyour first impression of cyber investigation process and strengthen your intention to\npursue a cybersecurity career;\n\ncybersecurity analysts and corporate security team members. From the text you'll learn\nthe methods that can be used to probe into a data leak, even if for the time being you're\nsure that your customers are reliably protected;\n\nmachine learning algorithm developers who will get a broader perspective of the\ncybercrime investigation process and be able to apply this knowledge in the future to\nadvance the cybercrime investigation industry, making the process more efficient and\nprompt.\n\nThus, we'll focus on two major points:\n\n1. Real breach or fake. There are leaks that are purported to be new to the public, but in\n\nreality they turn out to be databases that were earlier released somewhere else or are\nnew only to some extent, comprising both old and fresh data.\n2. Skilled threat actor or a newbie. Many attackers today use multiple accounts on the\n\nunderground forums in order to better hide their activities. To determine the goal of an\nattack and proceed with its further probe, one has to know the adversary.\n\n**Manual analysis**\n\nWe decided to demonstrate the methods that can be used for the achievement of the\naforesaid goals using a case with RaidForums underground platform where a set of\ndatabases was released on September 17, 2020 by a user nicknamed ExpertData.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 - Screenshot of ExpertData's post offering for sale a set of databases posted on_\n_RaidForums (currently deleted; screenshot taken from https://twitter.com/Bank_Security)_\n\nFirst, Group-IB analysts began to manually analyze the ExpertData account. The\ninformation publicly available on the forum indicates that this user joined RaidForums on\nSeptember 5, 2020.\n\n_Figure 2 - ExpertData's profile on RaidForums (captured in November 2020, the label_\n_\"Scammer\" was added by the forum admins after several claims against ExpertData. This_\n_label was then removed after the disputes were resolved)_\n\nThe account was then renamed to repeat its user identifier 121907651 (several threads and\nposts of ExpertData were removed by admins, which is why the total number of posts differs\nfrom fig.2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 - ExpertData's profile on RaidForums (captured in September 2021)_\n\nSo the situation was quite typical — a new user published information about multiple data\nleaks from companies in different regions. It was reasonable to doubt if the databases were\nreal leaks and if the attacker could have been trusted. Then we started to analyze threads of\ndiscussion where this account participated.\n\nOn September 17, 2020, ExpertData published a thread to sell a leaked database, allegedly\ncontaining info on over 100,000 users.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 - ExpertData's post offering for sale a database_\n\nOn the same day, ExpertData published a thread to sell 18 databases leaked from\ncompanies in Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, India, Italy, Hong Kong, Mexico, Saudi Arabia,\nSingapore, Thailand, Vietnam, UK, US, and other countries (fig.1). As it can be seen from\nthe screenshot, the original post didn't mention the names of the companies compromised.\n\nAbout a month later, on October 28, 2020, ExpertData published the same post, this time\nspecifying the names of the companies breached and excluding Saudi Arabian companies in\nthe travel industry from the list.\n\n_Figure 5 - Screenshot of_ **_ExpertData's post offering for sale a set of databases mentioning_**\n_the names of the companies compromised_\n\nIn the post ExpertData has also specified his contact details: Jabber account\n[expertdata@jabber.ru and Telegram account @ExpertData.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:expertdata@jabber.ru)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 -_ **_ExpertData's account on Telegram_**\n\nThe databases published by this author seemed to be unique since they had not been seen\nin the publications of other threat actors before. This was also noted by other forum\nmembers, who commented on one of ExpertData's posts.\n\n_Figure 7 - One of the active forum users with a high reputation commenting on ExpertData's_\n_post_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early November 2020, a user nicknamed The Polaris initiated a dispute against\n**ExpertData in a separate thread. The Polaris, who attempted to purchase a database from**\n**ExpertData, then accused the latter of lying about the quality (quantity of correct password**\nhashes) of the NitroGo (GoNitro.com) dump in a bid to get the payment worth $10,000.\n\nThe dispute thread was published on November 2, 2020. At the time of writing, the thread is\ndeleted, but Group-IB analysts managed to retrieve it.\n\n_Figure 8 - Screenshot of the dispute thread against ExpertData initiated by a user_\n_nicknamed The Polaris_\n\n**The Polaris joined Raidforums on August 29, 2020, six days before ExpertData account**\nwas created.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 -_ **_The Polaris' account on RaidForums_**\n\nSurprisingly, ExpertData wasn't the first to reply to this dispute: a user with the nickname\n**ShinyHunters stood up for him and came up with counter accusations against The Polaris.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 - Screenshot of the dispute thread against_ **_ExpertData_** _showing_ **_ShinyHunters_**\n_standing up for the former_\n\nIn their post, ShinyHunters accused The Polaris of hiding under multiple accounts and\nincluded a link to a screenshot of their earlier conversation in Jabber, in which ShinyHunters\nsuspected that it might be cybersecurity researcher Vinny Troia hiding behind the user\nnicknamed The Polaris, and welcomed him in a personal chat as \"Hello Vinny.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 - Screenshot of a chat between_ **_The Polaris_** _and_ **_ShinyHunters_** _in Jabber_\n\n**ShinyHunters are a famous group of hackers who intrude their victim networks and exfiltrate**\ndata. The group with this name became famous in the APAC region after Tokopedia leak in\nMay 2020, and is famous for selling unique databases that they exfiltrate during their hacking\nactivity.\n\nVinny Troia is, in particular, known for researching hacker group ShinyHunters and having\n[published in July 2020 a research about them. According to his findings, it is supposed that](https://www.nightlion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Dark-Overlord-Investigation-Report-Night-Lion_v1.01.pdf)\nShinyHunters is a successor to NSFW and Gnostic Players groups.\n\n_Figure 12 - Screenshot of_ **_ShinyHunters' post, in which they claim that_** **_The Polaris_** _is multi_\n_accounting and has another profile on the forum_\n\nThe dispute stopped on November 10, 2020. The Polaris was banned. Moreover, the\naccount of ExpertData was labeled as a scam one due to several disputes on the forum.\nAfter the disputes were resolved, this label was removed from the ExpertData account,\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich might indicate that the claims of The Polaris were not deemed relevant by forum\nadministrators.\n\nTypically, the ShinyHunters account doesn't join any disputes not against them, which is\nwhy we suggested that there might be a link between ShinyHunters and ExpertData. To\nfurther explore this assumption, we started comparing the threads, in which these two users\nparticipated and their posts themselves.\n\nAfter the post with 18 private databases, ExpertData published two more databases (now\nthe posts are deleted from RaidForums): GoNitro (on October 29, 2020) and AnimalJam (on\nNovember 11, 2020).\n\nOn October 21, 2020, the Nitro PDF (sold as GoNitro dump) service stated that it had been\n[subject to a low impact security incident, however, the media then reported that user and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-nitro-data-breach-impacts-microsoft-google-apple-more/)\ndocument databases allegedly stolen as a result of the incident were offered for sale in a\nprivate auction. ExpertData published information about the GoNitro databases on October\n29, 2020, which seems to be the first public post offering for sale the databases.\n\nLater, in January 2021, GoNitro was republished again by the user nicknamed Spiral with a\nreference to ShinyHunters.\n\n_Figure 13 - Screenshot of Spiral's post offering for sale the GoNitro dump_\n\nThus, we can suggest that ExpertData had access to the leaked GoNitro databases\nbecause of the connection with ShinyHunters.\n\nOn November 10, 2020, user Chandler-Bing published the AnimalJam database with a\nreference to ShinyHunters (the original post has been modified by the forum admins,and\n\n\n-----\n\nnow can only be found in the reply of another user).\n\n_Figure 14 - Commentary showing the offer to sell the base by Chandler-Bing_\n\n**ExpertData then published the same database a day later, on November 11, 2020. This**\ncould also be a sign of a connection between ExpertData and ShinyHunters.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that ExpertData just bought the databases and published them\nby himself. To confirm or reject our hypothesis about affiliation between ExpertData and\n**ShinyHunters, we decided to analyze ExpertData account history.**\n\nIt was revealed that back in March 2020 the user with the nickname Expert used the same\nTelegram account @expertdata (later in March 2020, the account was banned).\n\n_Figure 15 - Screenshot of Expert's post offering for sale a database_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe compared messages of users Expert and ExpertData and it seems that they used a\nsimilar message template to publish the leaks, except for one case only — the database\npublished on September 17, 2020 (fig.4). The Expert account also focused on selling\ndatabases. However, the quality of databases posted by Expert and ExpertData (created in\nSeptember 2020) accounts is different. Most of Expert's databases were not authentic and\nrepresented combo lists of previously published data leaks. The changes in the quality of\ndata offered for sale prompted us to think that the user might have started to work with some\ngroup in September 2020, presumably ShinyHunters.\n\nWe moved on with the messages of ShinyHunters and found another dispute on\nRaidForums, in which ShinyHunters was previously involved. On May 13, 2020, a user\nnicknamed Jumbo (account created on May 12, 2020) initiated a dispute against\n**ShinyHunters and fs0c131y/whysodank. Jumbo claimed that he transferred 1.5 BTC to**\n**ShinyHunters for the databases put up for sale, but didn't get the purchase, with**\n**ShinyHunters denying the money receipt.**\n\n_Figure 16 - Screenshot of a dispute talk initiated by Jumbo against ShinyHunters_\n\nThe account whysodank, mentioned in a dispute, was created back in April 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17 - Whysodankk profile on RaidForums_\n\nThe history of changing usernames in the profile is provided below.\n\n_Figure 18 - Screenshot of previous nicknames of the whysodank account_\n\nA user with the nickname whysodankk joined the dispute and refuted Jumbo's claims\nsaying that the screenshots allegedly confirming the money transfer in fact represented the\ntransfer of money between two wallets belonging to Jumbo. Whysodankk also confirmed\nthat he knew ShinyHunters and supported his position in the dispute.\n\n**Jumbo participated in only one thread on the forum — with accusations against**\n**ShinyHunters. It is noteworthy that it was whysodankk who was mainly involved in the**\ndiscussion, and not ShinyHunters, against whom the charges were brought as well.\n\nThe dispute ended on May 14, 2020. Jumbo was banned from the forum over a fake scam\nreport which shows that he didn't provide evidence in support of his accusations against\n**ShinyHunters.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the above posts it can be concluded that whysodankk is either a partner of\n**ShinyHunters or just a different account of the latter. To check this, we decided to find**\naccounts on the RaidForums whose contact details overlap with ShinyHunters' ones.\n\nIt turns out that ShinyHunters and whysodankk specified the same contact details —\n[shinyhunters@xmpp.jp. Examples of the posts are presented below.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:shinyhunters@xmpp.jp)\n\n_Figure 23 - Screenshot of ShinyHunters' post with Jabber account_ _[shinyhunters@xmpp.jp](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:shinyhunters@xmpp.jp)_\n\n_Figure 24 - Screenshot of whysodankk's post with Jabber account_ _[shinyhunters@xmpp.jp](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:shinyhunters@xmpp.jp)_\n_(account whysodankk was used to sell the Tokopedia database back in May 2020. The post_\n_on the screenshot contains the first part of the dump, while the full dump of Tokopedia was_\n_published by this account later)_\n\nThe same contact details indicate that ShinyHunters and whysodankk are related to each\nother. Moreover, these two accounts supported each other in the dispute.\n\nThe same ready-to-help strategy was used by ShinyHunters and ExpertData, which leads\nus to a conclusion that ExpertData might be a member or a data broker of ShinyHunters\n\n\n-----\n\nhacker group, and the databases trafficked by ExpertData could have belonged to\n**ShinyHunters.**\n\n_Figure 25 - Timeline of disputes against ShinyHunters and ExpertData_\nAdditional confirmation of this assumption can be found below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26 - Screenshot of a post by The Polaris who alleged friendly links between users_\n**_ShinyHunters and ExpertData_**\nThe table below shows information about contact details of the accounts revealed during the\nanalysis.\n\nThe above analysis revealed ties between accounts ExpertData, ShinyHunters, and\n**whysodankk (aka whysodank, fs0c131y). The links between ShinyHunters and other**\ngroups are out of the scope of this article.\n\nGoing back to our primary task to understand the quality of databases and the level of threat\nactor for the post of ExpertData on October 28, 2020, we can make the following\nconclusions:\n\n1. The databases are most probably authentic. No other posts with the same\n\ndatabases published earlier by other users were revealed. During the analysis links\nbetween ExpertData and ShinyHunters were uncovered. Several databases\npublished by ExpertData were most probably exfiltrated by ShinyHunters and\nsubsequently transferred to ExpertData. Publishing of unique data leaks is typical for\n**ShinyHunters group members.**\n\n2. It is supposed that ShinyHunters was behind these leaks. ShinyHunters is a\n\nfamous hacker group with a strong background and skills. It is assumed that the group\nconsists of several people, therefore they can publish new leaks using different\naccounts. If our conclusion is true, then the databases were obtained as a result of the\naffected companies' compromise. In such situations it is highly recommended to start\nincident response and investigation as soon as possible.\n\nAfter the link between ExpertData and ShinyHunters was uncovered, we decided to further\nanalyze ShinyHunters' relation to other members of the forum and find other accounts that\ncan potentially be linked to this threat actor. However, to find other links to ShinyHunters,\nwe would have had to analyze around a hundred messages of ShinyHunters and a bunch\nof posts belonging to their potential members. To simplify the research, we decided to use\nML-algorithms based on semantic text analysis.\n**Semantic analysis**\n\nThe first part of the article represented the manual analysis of the attackers' profiles and\nposts on the underground forum. Group-IB, however, is trying to automate its methodologies\nof cyber investigations and resorts to ML-algorithms to analyze dark web and build\ncorrelations between various posts in the underground.\n\nWe, therefore, decided to check the same range of data utilizing Natural Language\nProcessing (hereinafter - NLP) algorithms to reveal multiaccounts of the same person or\nvarious accounts of the same group of people. The analysis was carried out based on the\n\n\n-----\n\nassumption that the semantics of messages from the same person or sometimes even\nmembers of the same group should be similar.\n\nThe sequence of data collection and processing is shown below:\n\n- The collection of all posts from the RaidForums (topic, message, nickname, date and time);\n\n- The filtering of messages with a minimum length of less than 100 characters to exclude\nsemantically insignificant texts;\n\n- The vector representation of texts obtained using the BERT neural network model (12layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters).\n\nFor further analysis, all message vectors (N) belonging to user ShinyHunters were selected.\nFor each such vector, the top 10 nearest vectors of other users' messages were found (by\nthe Euclidean distance). As a result, we obtained a matrix of dimension N*10 (example of the\nmatrix is in the table below), with the nicknames of published messages as well as its\nelements. Then we filtered out repeated messages and messages whose Euclidean distance\nexceeds the specified threshold. The threshold was calculated empirically by comparing the\nproximity of different messages.\n\nAs a result, we received a list of messages semantically close to the messages of\n**ShinyHunters. All the messages were grouped by the users who published them**\n(matches). Users who have only one semantically close message (1 match) were excluded\nfrom the subsequent analysis to decrease false correlations. The last step was averaging the\nEuclidean distance across all messages for each of the users. The resulting values will be\nthe scores we were looking for.\n\nIt is important to note that this metric is not symmetric: if, for example, a User A account\nanalysis determined their link to User B, such a link might not be found as a result of the\nanalysis of User B. This is due to the fact that we have limited the search to the top 10\nnearest vectors for each user message. Surely, such sets of the nearest vectors, even for\nsemantically close messages, may differ. For this reason, the similar analysis for the found\nusers may not display the link with ShinyHunters.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is an example of calculation for User_3, based on the results of the first 3 messages in\nthe table above:\n\nS = (3.3 + 1.1 + 2.2) / 3 = 2.2\n\nMatches (semantically close messages): 3\n\nAverage distance (score): 2.2\n\nThe results of the analysis of the ShinyHunters messages are presented in fig. 27 (the total\nnumber of user posts at the time of writing is indicated in square brackets).\n\n_Figure 27 - The result of the analysis of ShinyHunters posts_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe analysis showed that accounts fs0c131y, MyBiggyBruteBolt, J4ckd0x, Megadimarus,\n**johnlockejrr, Omnipotent, Troy Hunt, Databases and FluffyBunnyFufu published several**\nmessages that are semantically close to ShinyHunters' posts.\n\nIn fig.27, we see that the number of semantically close messages (matches) between\nShinyHunters and other users is small, so it is incorrect to unequivocally state that there is a\nconnection between them. However, the values of this metric give us a reason to take a\ncloser look at possible relationships.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the semantic analysis doesn't reveal the strong link between ExpertData\nand ShinyHunters accounts. Below is the metric for the ExpertData account.\n\n_Figure 28 - The result of the analysis of ExpertData posts_\n\nThe distance to ShinyHunters messages is too high, which can be explained by three\nassumptions:\n\n1. ExpertData is a data broker who worked for this group. Big groups usually change\n\ndata brokers quite often and don't interact with them closely. That is why the format of\nthe messages of a data broker could be different from ShinyHunters posts.\n\n2. ExpertData has few posts;\n\n3. Semantic analysis may not work for dialogues in which each message carries its own\n\nsemantic meaning. Let's say that threat actors might discuss the same topic, but each\nof the messages in this thread will have their unique idea, and semantic analysis will\nnot be able to reveal links between these separate messages.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see from fig.27, there is a link between ShinyHunters and fs0c131y (aka\n**whysodankk) accounts. The link was earlier shown in the part of manual analysis and**\nconfirmed by semantic analysis.\n\n_Figure 29 - The result of the semantic analysis of fs0c131y and whysodankk posts_\n\nAs you can see different nicknames of the same account are identified by the algorithm.\n\nThe link of ShinyHunters with users MyBiggyBruteBolt and johnlockejrr was found,\nbecause format of the messages is similar, however most of the posts contain the same\nnote: \"This forum account currently has an ongoing scam report, please beware trading.\n_Details: Please respond to this scam report.\"_\n\n_Figure 30 - Semantically close posts of ShinyHunters/MyBiggyBruteBolt users_\n\n_Figure 31 - Semantically close posts of ShinyHunters/johnlockejrr users_\n\nMetrics for MyBiggyBruteBolt and johnlockejrr are presented below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 32 - The result of the analysis of MyBiggyBruteBolt posts_\n\n_Figure 33 - The result of the analysis of johnlockejrr posts_\n\nIn our opinion, these accounts are not relevant to ShinyHunters and could be considered as\nfalse positives.\n\nAccording to fig.27, there is a link between J4ckd0x and ShinyHunters accounts. The\naccount J4ckd0x was created back in 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 34 -_ **_J4ckd0x_** _account on RaidForum_\n\nAccording to the content of J4ckd0x's messages, his interests lie mostly in selling\ndatabases. The metric for this account is presented below.\n\n_Figure 35 - The result of the analysis of_ **_J4ckd0x's_** _posts_\n\nOn the screenshot below, you can see that the format of J4ckd0x's posts offering databases\nfor sale is similar to those of ShinyHunters.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 36 - Semantic proximity in posts of_ **_J4ckd0x_** _andShinyHunters_\n\nThere are two matches in messages of J4ckd0x and ShinyHunters that relate to two\ndatabases. J4ckd0x reposted (September 2020) one database that was first published by\n**ShinyHunters (April 2020). Dunzo database was published by ShinyHunters (July 2020)**\nbefore the post of J4ckd0x (September 2020). The format of the message posted by\n**ShinyHunters about Sonicbids database is similar to the format of J4ckd0x's post about**\nanother leakage. The format of the message posted by ShinyHunters about\nGGumim.com.kr database is similar to the format of the J4ckd0x's post about the Dunzo\nleakage.\n\n_Figure 37 - Posts published byJ4ckd0xandShinyHuntersand written using the same format_\n\nBased on the foregoing, we concluded that accounts ShinyHunters and J4ckd0x could\nbelong to the same group or at least be partners.\n\nAccording to fig.27, there is a link between ShinyHunters and Megadimarus accounts.\n**Megadimarus account was created on May 4, 2020 on the RaidForums and is banned at**\nthe time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 38 - Megadimarus_ _profile on RaidForums_\n\nThe metric for Megadimarius is presented below and is symmetric with ShinyHunters.\n\n_Figure 39 - The result of the analysis of_ **_Megadimarus_** _posts_\n\nMost of his messages were removed from the visible content of the forums however thanks\nto the capabilities of Group-IB's proprietary products the removed contents are preserved\nand analyzed as well. Most of the Megadimarus posts are related to selling databases.\nMoreover, some of them are associated with the activities of ShinyHunters predecessors. In\nthe report of cybersecurity researcher Vinny Troia the relationship between ShinyHunters\nand Megadimarus was also shown.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe metric shows a similarity of posts format for ShinyHunters and Megadimarus.\nMoreover, in this particular case every match is related to the same database (Appen.com\nand HomeChef leakages).\n\n_Figure 40 - Semantically close posts of ShinyHunters and Megadimarus_\n\nBased on the analysis of Megadimarius's posts and interests we concluded that there could\nbe a link between this account and ShinyHunters. It could be members of the same group\nor they could be partners.\n\nAnother account for the analysis from fig.27 is Omnipotent. It is one of the administrator\naccounts created back in 2015.\n\n_Figure 41 - Omnipotent profile on RaidForums_\n\nOne of the matches between ShinyHunters and Omnipotent is due to the following post.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 42 - Post of Omnipotent about an uploaded database_\n\nIt was reposted by Omnipotent from GnosticPlayers1 account which is now banned. The\nformat is similar to a format of ShinyHunters post about selling databases.\n**GnosticPlayers1 interest lies in selling databases and this nickname is similar to the name**\nof the group Gnostic Players.\n\nTwo messages of Omnipotent have similar format with the format of ShinyHunter's posts.\nSince Omnipotent account has thousands of messages, and only one (excluding the\nreposted one) having the format similar to ShinyHunters, as well as knowing that\n**Omnipotent is the forum administrator, we consider this match as a false positive.**\n\nThe metric for Omnipotent is presented below.\n\n_Figure 43 - The result of the analysis ofOmnipotent posts_\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother account from fig.27 is Troy **Hunt. This account was created in June 2019 and**\nimpersonated the name and photo of the famous cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt.\n\n_Figure 44 - Screenshot of Troy_ **_Hunt (aka Jnx3cx) account_**\n\nThe history of the account's nickname change is presented below.\n\n_Figure 45 - Username history for Troy_ **_Hunt/Jnx3cx account_**\n\nThe main interest of the account is selling databases some of which are associated with the\nactivities of ShinyHunters predecessors. The format of the messages is also correlated with\nthe one of ShinyHunters.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 46 - Posts published by_ **_Troy_** **_Hunt_** _and_ **_ShinyHunters_** _and written using the same_\n_format_\n\nThe algorithm shows the similarity of messages of ShinyHunters with the posts of Troy\n**Hunt about selling Canva and Zynga (now deleted from the visible contents of RaidForums).**\nMoreover, Troy **Hunt posted a message on behalf of Gnostic Players (is supposed to be a**\npredecessor of ShinyHunters according to the research of Vinny Troia).\n\n_Figure 47 - Replies to the deleted post of_ **_Troy_** **_Hunt_** _with a reference to GnosticPlayers_\n\n_Figure 48 - Post of_ **_Troy_** **_Hunt_** _with a reference to GnosticPlayers and Zynga database_\n\nThe metric for the Troy **Hunt account is presented below.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 49 - The result of the analysis of_ **_Troy_** **_Hunt_** _posts_\n\n_Figure 50 - The result of the analysis of_ **_Jnx3cx_** _(aka_ **_Troy_** **_Hunt) posts_**\n\nAfter analyzing the TroyHunt account, his posts and interests, we concluded that its link with\n**ShinyHunters could be relevant meaning the accounts could belong to the same group or at**\nleast be partners.\n\nNext account from fig.27 is Databases created back in 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 51 - Databases_ _profile on RaidForums_\n\nThe history of name changes is presented below.\n\n_Figure 52 - Username history for_ **_Databases_**\n\nThe account started to post databases only in 2019. In August 2021, the format of their\nmessages about selling databases started to resemble ShinyHunter's posts. That is why we\nsuppose that Databases probably became a partner of ShinyHunters in 2021.\n**ShinyHunters themselves have used this format of messages since 2020.**\n\nThe metric for Databases is presented below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 53 - The result of the analysis of_ **_Databases'_** _posts_\n\nAs you can see from the metric Troy Hunt (aka Jnx3cx) and Databases are close to each\nother as well.\n\nThe last account for the analysis is FluffyBunnyFufu, created back in 2018.\n\n_Figure 54 - FluffyBunnyFufu_ _(aka_ **_Ceech,_** **_FunnyBunnyHere) profile on RaidForums_**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 55 - Username history for Ceech/FluffyBunnyFufu/FluffyBunnyHere account_\n\nAlmost all mutual threads of the users relate to databases. One of FluffyBunnyFufu's posts\nwith a leak publication is similar in format to one of ShinyHunters' posts. Additionally,\n**FluffyBunnyFufu joined a dispute initiated against ShinyHunters with**\n**fs0c131y/whysodankk. FluffyBunnyFufu joined the talk to defend the position of**\n**ShinyHunters. This tactic is common for the members of ShinyHunters group as we noted**\nduring the Manual analysis part of this research.\n\n_Figure 56 - Posts published by FluffyBunnyFufu and ShinyHunters and written using the_\n_same format_\n\nAccording to the available data, it cannot be stated for sure if there is a clear connection\nbetween these two accounts, and it may be just a coincidence. However, it is clear that\n**FluffyBunnyFufu keeps an eye on ShinyHunters's activities.**\n\nWe can conclude that accounts J4ckd0x, Megadimarus, Troy Hunt, and Databases either\noccasionally used the same message format to sell databases, or they are related to each\nother and ShinyHunters. However, the majority of ShinyHunters' posts about selling\ndatabases have been using the same format since 2020, so we tend to think that this format\nis typical for the group.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 57 - The result of the analysis of ShinyHunters' posts_\n\nAnother argument is that the databases which were posted by these accounts are\nassociated with ShinyHunters or their predecessors. According to Vinny Troia's research,\n**ShinyHunters is a successor to NSFW and Gnostic Players groups.**\n\nThe semantic analysis along with our manual research has also shown that the higher the\ndistance between the messages of two different accounts is, the weaker their connection is.\nThis sounds reasonable from a theoretical point of view and our analysis has confirmed it.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIn this article, we wanted to show several methods of analysis using which researchers can\nestablish possible links between various accounts in the underground. To showcase them,\nwe used the example of infamous group ShinyHunters known for their unique and resonant\nleaks.\n\nThe starting point of our research was a message from ExpertData, a relatively new account\nwith several unique leaks that appeared in September 2020. The investigation could have\nstopped there if we treated ExpertData as just another new actor of RaidForums. However,\nour manual analysis suggested a link between this account and ShinyHunters based on\ntheir conversational tactics and databases posted for sale.\n\nThe suggested NLP algorithm seems to provide a relevant metric to find connected accounts\nalthough with some false positives. Combined manual and automatic analysis showed a\npotential link of ShinyHunters with the following accounts: fs0c131y (aka whysodankk,\n**whysodank), J4ckd0x, Megadimarus, Databases (aka Eutropius, 012, 0** **12), Troy Hunt**\n(aka Jnx3cx). Moreover, accounts belonging to the same user can be automatically\n\n\n-----\n\ndetected, like in cases of fs0c131y, Databases, and Troy Hunt. It is also noteworthy that\naccounts fs0c131y, J4ckd0x and Jnx3cx have similar format of the name.\n\n_Figure 58 - The links between ShinyHunters and other accounts in the underground_\n\nThis article is not about the ShinyHunters activity, the group's active behavior in the dark\nweb is just a good example for demonstrating automatic techniques that can be used for\nanalyzing discussions. In this case, we deliberately employ a well-known approach for\nsearching semantically close messages to demonstrate the advantages of even common ML\nmethods in cybersecurity investigations.\n\nAs you can see, the results of the manual method and the method based on the semantics of\nthe messages both overlap and complement each other. The examination of behavior\npatterns of accounts in the dark web can show the correlation between accounts used by the\nsame group, with automatic analysis based on the proposed algorithms allowing to increase\nthe depth of research, while reducing the list of suspects. In the article we've examined the\nfollowing connections:\n\nbetween ShinyHunters and fs0c131y (aka whysodankk, whysodank), whose link\nwith ShinyHunters is quite obvious due to the common contact details;\n\nbetween ShinyHunters and J4ckd0x, Megadimarus, Databases, Troy Hunt (aka\n**Jnx3cx) where the link was uncovered using semantic analysis;**\n\n\n-----\n\nbetween ShinyHunters and ExpertData, whose link with ShinyHunters was not\nobvious, and could't be revealed by the semantic analysis alone and required some\nmanual work.\n\nFalse positives were related to standard phrases added by the forum administrators to the\nmessages of other members. Moreover, admins reposted the messages of other members\nwhich are semantically close to what is searched. Depending on the goal of the analysis\nthese results can be improved by applying more specific filters. The techniques proposed\ncan be used to speed up and widen the results of the cybercrime investigations related to\ndark web activities. Once automated, it can even help in the deanonymization process.\nTry Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution right now\n\nDetect public leaks, identify affected accounts in breached databases and try advanced\nthreat actor profiling with best-in-class threat intelligence\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution\n\n\n-----",
