These infections lead to\nfollow-on hands-on-keyboard attacks and human-operated ransomware activity. Our continuous tracking of Raspberry Robin-related activity\nalso shows a very active operation: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data indicates that nearly 3,000 devices in almost 1,000 organizations\nhave seen at least one Raspberry Robin payload-related alert in the last 30 days.\n\n[Raspberry Robin has evolved from being a widely distributed worm with no observed post-infection actions when Red Canary first reported it in](https://redcanary.com/blog/raspberry-robin/)\nMay 2022, to one of the largest malware distribution platforms currently active. In July 2022, Microsoft security researchers observed devices\n[infected with Raspberry Robin being installed with the FakeUpdates malware, which led to DEV-0243 activity. DEV-0243, a ransomware-](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/#DEV-0206-DEV-0243)\nassociated activity group that overlaps with actions tracked as EvilCorp by other vendors, was first observed deploying the LockBit\nransomware as a service (RaaS) payload in November 2021. Since then, Raspberry Robin has also started deploying IcedID, Bumblebee, and\nTruebot based on our investigations.\n\nIn October 2022, Microsoft observed Raspberry Robin being used in post-compromise activity attributed to another actor, DEV-0950 (which\noverlaps with groups tracked publicly as FIN11/TA505). From a Raspberry Robin infection, the DEV-0950 activity led to Cobalt Strike handson-keyboard compromises, sometimes with a Truebot infection observed in between the Raspberry Robin and Cobalt Strike stage. The activity\nculminated in deployments of the Clop ransomware. DEV-0950 traditionally uses phishing to acquire the majority of their victims, so this\nnotable shift to using Raspberry Robin enables them to deliver payloads to existing infections and move their campaigns more quickly to\nransomware stages.\n\n[Given the interconnected nature of the cybercriminal economy, it’s possible that the actors behind these Raspberry Robin-related malware](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/)\ncampaigns—usually distributed through other means like malicious ads or email—are paying the Raspberry Robin operators for malware\ninstalls.\n\nRaspberry Robin attacks involve multi-stage intrusions, and its post-compromise activities require access to highly privileged credentials to\ncause widespread impact. Organizations can defend their networks from this threat by having security solutions like Microsoft Defender for\nEndpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is built into Windows, to help detect Raspberry Robin and its follow-on activities, and by\napplying best practices related to credential hygiene, network segmentation, and attack surface reduction.\n\nIn this blog, we share our detailed analysis of these attacks and shed light on Raspberry Robin’s origins, since its earliest identified activity in\nSeptember 2021, and motivations which have been debated since it was first reported in May 2022. We also provide mitigation guidance and\nother recommendations defenders can use to limit this malware’s spread and impact from follow-on hands-on-keyboard attacks.\n\n## A new worm hatches: Raspberry Robin’s initial propagation via USB drives\n\nIn early May 2022, Red Canary reported that a new worm named Raspberry Robin was spreading to Windows systems through infected USB\ndrives. The USB drive contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) file disguised as a folder. In earlier infections, this file used a generic file name like\n_recovery.lnk, but in more recent ones, it uses brands of USB drives. It should be noted that USB-worming malware isn’t new, and many_\norganizations no longer track these as a top threat.\n\nFor an attack relying on a USB drive to run malware upon insertion, the targeted system’s autorun.inf must be edited or configured to specify\nwhich code to start when the drive is plugged in. Autorun of removable media is disabled on Windows by default. However, many organizations\nhave widely enabled it through legacy Group Policy changes.\n\nThere has been much public debate about whether the Raspberry Robin drives use autoruns to launch or if it relies purely on social\nengineering to encourage users to click the LNK file. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Detection and Response\nTeam (DART) research has confirmed that both instances exist in observed attacks. Some Raspberry Robin drives only have the LNK and\nexecutable files, while drives from earlier infections have a configured autorun.inf. This change could be linked to why the names of the\nshortcut files changed from more generic names to brand names of USB drives, possibly encouraging a user to execute the LNK file.\n\nUpon insertion of the infected drive or launching of the LNK file, the UserAssist registry key in Windows—where Windows Explorer maintains a\nlist of launched programs—is updated with a new value indicating a program was launched by Windows.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Attack chain of the\n\noriginal Raspberry Robin infections\nThe UserAssist key stores the names of launched programs in ROT13-ciphered format, which means that every letter in the name of the\nprogram is replaced with the 13 letter in the alphabet after it. This routine makes the entries in this registry key not immediately readable. Theth\nUserAssist key is a useful forensic artifact to demonstrate which applications were launched on Windows, as outlined in Red Canary’s blog.\n\nWindows shortcut files are mostly used to create an easy-to-find shortcut to launch a program, such as pinning a link to a user’s browser on\nthe taskbar. However, the format allows the launching of any code, and attackers often use LNK files to launch malicious scripts or run stored\ncode remotely. Raspberry Robin’s LNK file points to cmd.exe to launch the Windows Installer service msiexec.exe and install a malicious\npayload hosted on compromised QNAP network attached storage (NAS) devices.\n\nFigure 2. Examples of URLs\n\nconnecting to an external domain\nOnce the Raspberry Robin payload is running, it spawns additional processes by using system binaries such as rundll32.exe, odbcconf.exe,\nand control.exe to use as living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to run malicious code. Raspberry Robin also launches code via fodhelper.exe,\na system binary for managing optional features, as a user access control (UAC) bypass.\n\nThe malware injects into system processes including regsvr32.exe, rundll32.exe, and dllhost.exe and connects to various command-andcontrol (C2) servers hosted on Tor nodes.\n\n[In most instances, Raspberry Robin persists by adding itself to the RunOnce key of the registry hive associated with the user who executed](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/setupapi/run-and-runonce-registry-keys)\nthe initial malware install. The registry key points to the Raspberry Robin binary, which has a random name and a random extension such as\n_.mh or .vdm in the user’s AppData folder or to ProgramData. The key uses the intended purpose of regsvr32.exe to launch the portable_\nexecutable (PE) file, allowing the randomized non-standard file extension to launch the executable content.\n\nFigure 3. Example of the contents of the RunOnce key\nEntries in the RunOnce key delete the registry entry prior to launching the executable content at sign-in. Raspberry Robin re-adds this key\nonce it is successfully running to ensure persistence. After the initial infection, this leads to RunOnce.exe launching the malware payload in\ntimelines. Raspberry Robin also temporarily renames the RunOnce key when writing to it to evade detections.\n\n## Raspberry Robin’s connection to a larger malware ecosystem\n\nSince our initial analysis, Microsoft security researchers have discovered links between Raspberry Robin and other malware families. The\nRaspberry Robin implant has also started to distribute other malware families, which is not uncommon in the cybercriminal economy, where\nattackers purchase “loads” or installs from operators of successful and widespread malware to facilitate their goals.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n4. Raspberry Robin’s connectivity to a larger cybercriminal ecosystem\n\n### Introducing Fauppod: Like FakeUpdates but without the fake updates\n\nOn July 26, 2022, Microsoft witnessed the first reported instance of a Raspberry Robin-infected host deploying a FakeUpdates (also known as\nSocGholish) JavaScript backdoor. Previously, FakeUpdates were delivered primarily through drive-by downloads or malicious ads\nmasquerading as browser updates. Microsoft tracks the activity group behind FakeUpdates as DEV-0206 and the USB-based Raspberry\nRobin infection operators as DEV-0856.\n\nAfter discovering Raspberry Robin-deployed FakeUpdates, Microsoft security researchers continued monitoring for other previously\nunidentified methodologies in FakeUpdates deployments. Research into the various malware families dropped by Raspberry Robin’s USBdelivered infections continued, and new signatures were created to track the various outer layers of packed malware under the family name\nFauppod.\n\nOn July 27, 2022, Microsoft identified samples detected as Fauppod that have similar process trees with DLLs written by Raspberry Robin\nLNK infections in similar locations and using similar naming conventions. Their infection chains also dropped the FakeUpdates malware.\nHowever, the victim hosts where these samples were detected didn’t have the traditional infection vector of an LNK file launched from an\ninfected USB drive, as detailed in Red Canary’s blog.\n\nIn this instance, Fauppod was delivered via codeload[.]github[.]com, a fraudulent and malicious repository created by a cybercriminal actor that\nMicrosoft tracks as DEV-0651. The payload was delivered as a ZIP archive file containing another ZIP file, which then had a massive (700MB)\nControl Panel (CPL) file inside. Attackers use nested containers such as ZIP, RAR, and ISO files to avoid having their malicious payloads\nstamped with Mark of the Web (MOTW), which Windows uses to mark files from the internet and thus enable security solutions to block certain\nactions. Control Panel files are similar to other PEs like EXE and DLL files.\n\nMicrosoft has since seen DEV-0651 deliver Fauppod samples by taking advantage of various public-facing trusted and legitimate cloud\nservices beyond GitHub, including Azure, Discord, and SpiderOak. Refer to the indicators of compromise (IOCs) below for more details.\nMicrosoft has shared information about this threat activity and service abuse with these hosting providers.\n\n### Connecting the dot(net malware)\n\nWith the discovery of the DEV-0651 link, Microsoft had two pieces of evidence suggesting a relationship between Fauppod and Raspberry\nRobin:\n\nBoth malware families were delivering FakeUpdates\nSignatures created to detect Raspberry Robin DLL samples on hosts infected by the publicly known LNK file spreading mechanism were\ndetecting malware that wasn’t being delivered through any previously known Raspberry Robin connections\n\nFollowing DEV-0651’s previous leveraging of cloud hosting services, the earliest iteration of a DEV-0651-related campaign that Microsoft was\nable to identify occurred in September 2021, which was around the same time Red Canary stated Raspberry Robin began to propagate.\n\nBased on these facts, Microsoft reached low-confidence assessment that the Fauppod malware samples were related to the later delivery of\nwhat was publicly known as Raspberry Robin and started investigating these links to raise confidence and discover more information.\n\n\n-----\n\ne aut o g bot e based a d be a o based detect o s o auppod sa p es, c oso t ut ed e st g detect o s based o t e use o\nOBDCCONF as a LOLBin to launch regsvr32 (which was also detailed in Red Canary’s blog as a Raspberry Robin tactic, technique, and\nprocedure (TTP)):\n\n[Figure 5. ODBCCONF being used as a proxy for regsvr execution, similar to Red Canary’s blog on Raspberry Robin](https://redcanary.com/blog/raspberry-robin/)\nMicrosoft noted a unique quality in the command execution that was persistent through all Raspberry Robin infections stemming from an\ninfected USB drive: there was a trailing “.” character at the end of the DLL name within the command above.\n\nWhile reviewing DEV-0651 Fauppod-delivered malware, Microsoft identified a Fauppod CPL sample served via GitHub when the following\ncommand is run:\n\nFigure 6. DEV-0651 Fauppod CPL generated command line\nNotable in the above Fauppod command are the following:\n\nThe use of msiexec.exe to launch the Windows binary shell32.dll as a LOLBin, instead of launching the malware PE directly via\n_rundll32.exe, using rundll32.exe to launch shell32.dll, and passing ShellExec_RunDLL to load the commands—a TTP consistent with_\nRaspberry Robin.\nFauppod CPL file’s use of a staging directory to copy a payload to disk using randomly generated directories in ProgramData that then\ncontain malicious PE files with randomly generated names and extensions. This naming pattern overlaps with those leveraged by\npublicly known Raspberry Robin DLLs.\n[The same trailing “.” in the DLL name as seen in the ODBCCONF proxying detailed in Red Canary’s blog. Avast also later noted this](https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/raspberry-robins-roshtyak-a-little-lesson-in-trickery/)\ntrailing in the DLL implant dropped by Raspberry Robin, which they refer to as Roshtyak.\n\nThese findings raised Microsoft’s confidence in assessing whether there is a connection between Fauppod’s CPL files and Raspberry Robin\nextending beyond a similarity in outer layers and packing of the malware.\n\nMicrosoft security researchers also identified a payload within a Fauppod sample communicating with a compromised QNAP storage server to\nsend information about the infected device, overlapping with Raspberry Robin’s use of compromised QNAP appliances for C2.\n\nWhile continuing to monitor the prevalence and infection sources of Fauppod, Microsoft identified a heavily obfuscated .NET malware (SHA256: [a9d5ec72fad42a197cbadcb1edc6811e3a8dd8c674df473fd8fa952ba0a23c15) arriving on hosts that had previously been infected with](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a9d5ec72fad42a197cbadcb1edc6811e3a8dd8c674df473fd8fa952ba0a23c15)\neither Raspberry Robin LNK infected hosts or Fauppod CPL malware.\n\nFigure 7. .NET spreader DLL execution, via rundll32, with an export of voicednws_St1_4; the randomly generated directory structure of using\ntwo dictionary words is consistent across a significant number of infected hosts\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n8. DNSpy screenshot of a highly obfuscated .NET DLL assessed to be responsible for creating Raspberry Robin LNK files on external USB\ndrives\nWhile inspecting these samples, Microsoft noted that many were responsible for creating LNK files on external USB drives.\n\nBased on our investigation, Microsoft currently assesses with medium confidence that the above .NET DLLs delivered both by Raspberry\nRobin LNK infections and Fauppod CPL samples are responsible for spreading Raspberry Robin LNK files to USB drives. These LNK files, in\nturn, infect other hosts via the infection chain detailed in Red Canary’s blog.\n\nMicrosoft also assesses with medium confidence that the Fauppod-packed CPL samples are currently the earliest known point in the attack\nchain for propagating Raspberry Robin infections to targets. Microsoft findings suggest that the Fauppod CPL entities, the obfuscated .NET\nLNK spreader modules they drop, the Raspberry Robin LNK files Red Canary documented, and the Raspberry Robin DLL files (or, Roshtyak,\nas per Avast) could all be considered as various components to the “Raspberry Robin” malware infection chain.\n\n### The Fauppod-Dridex connection\n\nIn July 2022, Microsoft found Raspberry Robin infections that led to hands-on-keyboard activity by DEV-0243. One of the earliest malware\ncampaigns to bring notoriety to DEV-0243 was the Dridex banking trojan.\n\nCode similarity between malware families is often used to demonstrate a link between families to a tracked actor. In [IBM’s blog post published](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/raspberry-robin-worm-dridex-malware/)\nafter we observed the Raspberry Robin and DEV-0243 connection, they highlighted several code similarities between the loader for the\nRaspberry Robin DLLs and the Dridex malware.\n\nMicrosoft’s analysis of Fauppod samples also identified some Dridex filename testing features, which are used to avoid running in certain\nenvironments. Fauppod has similar functionality to avoid execution if it recognizes it’s running as testapp.exe or self.exe. This code similarity\nhas historically caused some Fauppod samples to trip Dridex detection alerts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9.\n\nScreenshot highlighting “self.exe” and “testapp.exe” evasions in Fauppod using GetModuleHandleA and LoadLibraryW API calls, similar to\nprevious Dridex samples\nGiven the previously documented relationship between Raspberry Robin and DEV-0206/DEV-0243 (EvilCorp), this behavioral similarity in the\ninitial vector for Raspberry Robin infections adds another piece of evidence to the connection between the development and propagation of\nFauppod/Raspberry Robin and DEV-0206/DEV-0243.\n\n## Raspberry Robin’s future as part of the cybercriminal gig economy\n\nCybercriminal malware is an ever-present threat for most organizations today, taking advantage of common weaknesses in security strategies\nand using social engineering to trick users. Almost every organization risks encountering these threats, including Fauppod/Raspberry Robin\nand FakeUpdates. Developing a robust protection and detection strategy and investing in credential hygiene, least privileges, and network\nsegmentation are keys to preventing the impact of these complex and highly connected cybercriminal threats.\n\nRaspberry Robin’s infection chain is a confusing and complicated map of multiple infection points that can lead to many different outcomes,\neven in scenarios where two hosts are infected simultaneously. There are numerous components involved; differentiating them could be\nchallenging as the attackers behind the threat have gone to extreme lengths to protect the malware at each stage with complex loading\nmechanisms. These attackers also hand off to other actors for some of the more impactful attack stages, such as ransomware deployment.\n\n\n-----\n\ns o t s t g, c oso t s a a e o at east ou co ed aspbe y ob e t y ecto s ese e t y po ts e e ed to a ds o\nkeyboard actions by attackers, and they all led to intrusions where the end goal was likely deployment of ransomware.\n\nInfections from Fauppod CPL files and the Raspberry Robin worm component have facilitated human-operated intrusions indicative of preransomware activity. Based on the multiple infection stages and varied payloads, Microsoft assesses that DEV-0651’s initial access vector, the\nvarious spreading techniques of the malicious components, and high infection numbers have provided an attractive distribution option for\nfollow-on payloads.\n\nBeginning on September 19, 2022, Microsoft identified Raspberry Robin worm infections deploying IcedID and—later at other victims—\nBumblebee and TrueBot payloads. In October 2022, Microsoft researchers observed Raspberry Robin infections followed by Cobalt Strike\nactivity from DEV-0950. This activity, which in some cases included a Truebot infection, eventually deployed the Clop ransomware.\n\n## Defending against Raspberry Robin infections\n\nWorms can be noisy and could lead to alert fatigue in security operations centers (SOCs). Such fatigue could lead to improper or untimely\n[remediation, providing the worm operator ample opportunity to sell access to the affected network to other cybercriminals.](https://aka.ms/ransomware-as-a-service)\n\nWhile Raspberry Robin seemed to have no purpose when it was first discovered, it has evolved and is heading towards providing a potentially\ndevastating impact on environments where it’s still installed. Raspberry Robin will likely continue to develop and lead to more malware\ndistribution and cybercriminal activity group relationships as its install footprint grows.\n\n[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus detect Raspberry Robin and follow-on activities described in this blog.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint)\nDefenders can also apply the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat:\n\n[Prevent drives from using autorun and execution code on insertion or mount.
