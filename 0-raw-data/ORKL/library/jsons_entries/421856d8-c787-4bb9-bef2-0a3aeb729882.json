    "plain_text": "# Catching the big fish: Analyzing a large-scale phishing- as-a-service operation\n\n**[microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/21/catching-the-big-fish-analyzing-a-large-scale-phishing-as-a-service-operation/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/21/catching-the-big-fish-analyzing-a-large-scale-phishing-as-a-service-operation/)**\n\nSeptember 21, 2021\n\nIn researching phishing attacks, we came across a campaign that used a rather high volume\nof newly created and unique subdomains—over 300,000 in a single run. This investigation\nled us down a rabbit hole as we unearthed one of the operations that enabled the campaign:\na large-scale phishing-as-a-service operation called BulletProofLink, which sells phishing\nkits, email templates, hosting, and automated services at a relatively low cost.\n\nWith over 100 available phishing templates that mimic known brands and services, the\nBulletProofLink operation is responsible for many of the phishing campaigns that impact\nenterprises today. BulletProofLink (also referred to as BulletProftLink or Anthrax by its\noperators in various websites, ads, and other promotional materials) is used by multiple\nattacker groups in either one-off or monthly subscription-based business models, creating a\nsteady revenue stream for its operators.\n\nThis comprehensive research into BulletProofLink sheds a light on phishing-as-a-service\noperations. In this blog, we expose how effortless it can be for attackers to purchase\nphishing campaigns and deploy them at scale. We also demonstrate how phishing-as-aservice operations drive the proliferation of phishing techniques like “double theft”, a method\nin which stolen credentials are sent to both the phishing-as-a-service operator as well as\ntheir customers, resulting in monetization on several fronts.\n\n\n-----\n\nInsights into phishing-as-a-service operations, their infrastructure, and their evolution inform\nprotections against phishing campaigns. The knowledge we gained during this investigation\n[ensures that Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protects customers from the campaigns that](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection/office-365-defender)\nthe BulletProofLink operation enables. As part of our commitment to improve protection for\nall, we are sharing these findings so the broader community can build on them and use them\nto enhance email filtering rules as well as threat detection technologies like sandboxes to\nbetter catch these threats.\n\n## Understanding phishing kits and phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS)\n\nThe persistent onslaught of email-based threats continues to pose a challenge for network\ndefenders because of improvements in how phishing attacks are crafted and distributed.\nModern phishing attacks are typically facilitated by a large economy of email and false signin templates, code, and other assets. While it was once necessary for attackers to\nindividually build phishing emails and brand-impersonating websites, the phishing landscape\nhas evolved its own service-based economy. Attackers who aim to facilitate phishing attacks\nmay purchase resources and infrastructure from other attacker groups including:\n\n**Phish kits: Refers to kits that are sold on a one-time sale basis from phishing kit**\nsellers and resellers. These are packaged files, usually a ZIP file, that come with readyto-use email phishing templates designed to evade detection and are often\naccompanied by a portal with which to access them. Phish kits allow customers to set\nup the websites and purchase the domain names. Alternatives to phishing site\ntemplates or kits also include templates for the emails themselves, which customers\ncan customize and configure for delivery. One example of a known phish kit is the\nMIRCBOOT phish kit.\n**Phishing-as-a-service: Similar to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), phishing-as-a-**\nservice follows the software-as-a-service model, which requires attackers to pay an\noperator to wholly develop and deploy large portions or complete phishing campaigns\nfrom false sign-in page development, website hosting, and credential parsing and\nredistribution. BulletProofLink is an example of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS)\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Feature comparison between phishing kits and phishing-as-a-service_\n\nIt’s worth noting that some PhaaS groups may offer the whole deal—from template creation,\nhosting, and overall orchestration, making it an enticing business model for their clientele.\nMany phishing service providers offer a hosted scam page solution they call “FUD” Links or\n“Fully undetected” links, a marketing term used by these operators to try and provide\nassurance that the links are viable until users click them. These phishing service providers\nhost the links and pages and attackers who pay for these services simply receive the stolen\ncredentials later on. Unlike in certain ransomware operations, attackers do not gain access\nto devices directly and instead simply receive untested stolen credentials.\n\n## Breaking down BulletProofLink services\n\nTo understand how PhaaS works in detail, we dug deep into the templates, services, and\n[pricing structure offered by the BulletProofLink operators. According to the group’s About Us](https://osint.fans/bulletproftlink-phishing-service-p1)\nweb page, the BulletProofLink PhaaS group has been active since 2018 and proudly boasts\nof their unique services for every “dedicated spammer”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The BulletProofLink’s ‘About Us’ page provides potential customers an overview of_\n_their services._\n\nThe operators maintain multiple sites under their aliases, BulletProftLink, BulletProofLink,\nand Anthrax, including YouTube and Vimeo pages with instructional advertisements as well\nas promotional materials on forums and other sites. In many of these cases, and in ICQ chat\nlogs posted by the operator, customers refer to the group as the aliases interchangeably.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Video tutorials posted by the Anthrax Linkers (aka BulletProofLink)_\n\n### BulletProofLink registration and sign-in pages\n\nBulletProofLink additionally hosts multiple sites, including an online store where they allow\ntheir customers to register, sign in, and advertise their hosted service for monthly\nsubscriptions.\n\nOver the course of monitoring this operation, their online store had undergone multiple\nrevisions. The source code for the site’s pages contained references to artifacts elsewhere\non the site, which included ICQ chat messages and advertisements. While those references\nare still present in newer versions, the sign-in page for the monthly subscription site no\nlonger contains service pricing information. In previous versions, the sites alluded to the cost\nfor the operator to host FUD links and return credentials to the purchasing party.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. BulletProofLink registration page_\n\nJust like any other service, the group even boasts of a 10% welcome discount on customers’\norders when they subscribe to their newsletter.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. BulletProofLink welcome promotion for site visitors’ first order_\n\n### Credential phishing templates\n\nBulletProofLink operators offer over 100 templates and operate with a highly flexible\nbusiness model. This business model allows customers to buy the pages and “ship” the\nemails themselves and control the entire flow of password collection by registering their own\nlanding pages or make full use of the service by using the BulletProofLink’s hosted links as\nthe final site where potential victims key in their credentials.\n\nThe templates are designed to evade detection while successfully phishing for credentials,\nbut may vary based on the individual purchasing party. Likewise, the wide variety of\ntemplates offered does not guarantee that all BulletProofLink facilitated campaigns will look\nidentical. Instead, the campaigns themselves can be identified with a mixture of phishing\npage source code, combined with the PHP password processing sites referenced therein, as\nwell as the hosting infrastructure used in their larger-scale campaigns. These passwordprocessing domains correlate back to the operator through hosting, registration, email, and\nother metadata similarities during domain registration.\n\nThe templates offered are related to the phishing pages themselves, so the emails that\nservice them may seem highly disparate and handled by multiple operators.\n\n### Services offered: Customer hosting and support\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing operators list an array of services on their site along with the corresponding\nfees. As other researchers noted, the monthly service costs as much as $800, while other\nservices cost about $50 dollars for a one-time hosting link. We also found that Bitcoin is a\ncommon payment method accepted on the BulletProofLink site.\n\nIn addition to communicating with customers on site accounts, the operators display various\nmethods of interacting with them, which include Skype, ICQ, forums, and chat rooms. Like a\ntrue software business dedicated to their customers, the operators provide customer support\nservices for new and existing customers.\n\n_Figure 6. Screenshot of the BulletProofLink site, which offers a wide array of phishing_\n_services impersonating various legitimate services_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. DocuSign scam page service listed on the BulletProofLink site_\n\nThe hosting service includes a weekly log shipment to purchasing parties, usually sent\nmanually over ICQ or email. Analysis of individual activity on password-processing replies\nfrom the collected infrastructure indicates that the credentials are received on the initial\ntemplate page and then sent to password-processing sites owned by the operator.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. An advertisement from BulletProofLink that showcases their weekly log shipment_\n\nAt the time of this report, BulletProofLink continues to operate active phishing campaigns,\nwith large volumes of redirections to their password-processing links from legitimate web\nhosting providers. In the next section, we describe on such campaign.\n\n## Tracking a BulletProofLink-enabled campaign\n\nAs mentioned, we uncovered BulletProofLink while investigating a phishing campaign that\nused the BulletProofLink phishing kit on either on attacker-controlled sites or sites provided\nby BulletProofLink as part of their service. The campaign itself was notable for its use of\n300,000 subdomains, but our analysis exposed one of many implementations of the\nBulletProofLink phishing kit:\n\n_Figure 9. End-to-end attack chain of BulletProofLink-enabled phishing campaigns_\n\nAn interesting aspect of the campaign that drew our attention was its use of a technique we\ncall “infinite subdomain abuse”, which happens when attackers compromise a website’s DNS\nor when a compromised site is configured with a DNS that allows wildcard subdomains.\n“Infinite subdomains” allow attackers to use a unique URL for each recipient while only\nhaving to purchase or compromise one domain for weeks on end. It is gaining popularity\namong attackers for the following reasons:\n\nIt serves as a departure from previous techniques that involved hackers obtaining large\nsets of single-use domains. To leverage infinite subdomains for use in email links that\nserve to redirect to a smaller set of final landing pages, the attackers then only need to\ncompromise the DNS of the site, and not the site itself.\nIt allows phishing operators to maximize the unique domains they are able to use by\nconfiguring dynamically generated subdomains as prefix to the base domain for each\nindividual email.\nThe creation of unique URLs poses a challenge to mitigation and detection methods\nthat rely solely on exact matching for domains and URLs.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing campaign also impersonated (albeit poorly) the Microsoft logo and branding.\nThe impersonation technique used solid colors for the logo, which may have been done\nintentionally to bypass detection of the Microsoft logo’s four distinct colors. It is worth noting\nthat later iterations of the campaign have switched to using the four colors in the Microsoft\nlogo.\n\n_Figure 10. Phishing lure from a recent credential phishing campaign_\n\n[These messages also used a technique called zero-point font, which pads the HTML of the](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/08/18/trend-spotting-email-techniques-how-modern-phishing-emails-hide-in-plain-sight/)\nmessage with characters that render as invisible to the user, to obfuscate the email body and\nattempt to evade detection. This technique is increasingly used by phishers to evade\ndetection.\n\n_Figure 11. HTML showing zero-point font date stuffing in an email_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found that the phishing URL in the email contained Base64-encoded victim information\nalong with an attacker-owned site where the user is meant to be redirected. In this campaign,\na single base domain was used for the infinite subdomain technique to initiate the redirects\nfor the campaign, which leveraged multiple secondary sites over several weeks.\n\n_Figure 12. The format and an example of the phishing URL, which when decoded redirects_\n_to the compromised site._\n\nThe compromised site redirected to a second domain that hosted the phishing page, which\nmimicked the Outlook sign-in screen and is generated for each user-specific URL. We found\nthat the page is generated for any number of email addresses entered into the URI, and had\nno checking mechanisms to guarantee that it wasn’t already used or was related to a live\nphishing email.\n\nThere can be one or more locations to which credentials are sent, but the page employed a\nfew obfuscation techniques to obscure these locations. One attempt to obfuscate the\npassword processing site’s location was by using a function that decodes the location based\non calling back to an array of numbers and letters:\n\nWe reversed this in Python and found the site that the credentials were being sent to:\n_hxxps://webpicture[.]cc/email-list/finish-unv2[.]php. The pattern “email-list/finish-unv2.php”_\ncame in one of these variations: finish-unv2[.]php, _finish-unv22[.]php, or finish[.]php. These_\nvariations typically used the term “email-list” as well as another file path segment referencing\na particular phishing page template, such as OneDrive or SharePoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nOccasionally, multiple locations were used to send credentials to, including some that could\nbe owned by the purchasing party instead of the operator themselves, which could be called\nin a separate function. This could be an example of legacy artifacts remaining in final\ntemplates, or of double-theft occurring.\n\n_Figure 13. The final site’s format comes in either of these pattern variations_\n\nAnalyzing these patterns led us to an extensive list of password-capturing URIs detailed in\nan detailed in an independent research about the BulletProofLink phishing service operators.\nWe noticed that they listed patterns similar to the ones we had just observed, enabling us to\nfind the various templates BulletProofLink used, including the phishing email with the fake\nMicrosoft logo discussed earlier.\n\nOne of the patterns we noted is that many of the password-processing domains used in the\ncampaigns directly had associated email addresses with “Anthrax”,” BulletProofLink”,\n“BulletProftLink” or other terms in the certificate registration. The email addresses\nthemselves were not listed identically on every certificate, and were also tied to domains not\nused exclusively for password-processing, as noted in other investigations.\n\nFrom then on, we drew even more similarities between the landing pages seen in the infinite\nsubdomain surge campaign we were tracking and the existing in-depth research on the\nadversaries behind the BulletProofLink operations.\n\nThis process ultimately led us to track and expand on the same resources referenced in the\nother research, as we uncovered even more information about the long-running and largescale phishing service BulletProofLink. Furthermore, we were able to uncover previous and\ncurrent password-processing sites in use by the operator, as well as large segments of\ninfrastructure hosted on legitimate hosting sites for this operation’s other components.\n\n## “Double theft” as a PhaaS monetization effort\n\nThe PhaaS working model as we’ve described it thus far is reminiscent of the ransomwareas-a-service (RaaS) model, which involves double extortion. The extortion method used in\nransomware generally involves attackers exfiltrating and posting data publicly, in addition to\nencrypting them on compromised devices, to put pressure on organizations to pay the\nransom. This lets attackers gain multiple ways to assure payment, while the released data\n\n\n-----\n\ncan then be weaponized in future attacks by other operators. In a RaaS scenario, the\nransomware operator has no obligation to delete the stolen data even if the ransom is\nalready paid.\n\nWe have observed this same workflow in the economy of stolen credentials in phishing-as-aservice. With phishing kits, it is trivial for operators to include a secondary location for\ncredentials to be sent to and hope that the purchaser of the phish kit does not alter the code\nto remove it. This is true for the BulletProofLink phishing kit, and in cases where the\nattackers using the service received credentials and logs at the end of a week instead of\nconducting campaigns themselves, the PhaaS operator maintained control of all credentials\nthey resell.\n\nIn both ransomware and phishing, the operators supplying resources to facilitate attacks\nmaximize monetization by assuring stolen data, access, and credentials are put to use in as\nmany ways as possible. Additionally, victims’ credentials also likely to end up in the\nunderground economy.\n\nFor a relatively simple service, the return of investment offers a considerable motivation as\nfar as the email threat landscape goes.\n\n## How Microsoft Defender for Office 365 defends against PhaaS-driven phishing attacks\n\nInvestigating specific email campaigns allows us to ensure protections against particular\nattacks as well as similar attacks that use the same techniques, such as the infinite\nsubdomain abuse, brand impersonation, zero-point font obfuscation, and victim-specific URI\nused in the campaign discussed in this blog. By studying phishing-as-a-service operations,\nwe are able to scale and expand the coverage of these protections to multiple campaigns\nthat use the services of these operations.\n\nIn the case of BulletProofLink, our intelligence on the unique phishing kits, phishing services,\nand other components of phishing attacks allows us to ensure protection against the many\n[phishing campaigns this operation enables. Microsoft Defender for Office 365—which uses](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/office-365-defender)\nmachine learning, heuristics, and an advanced detonation technology to analyze emails,\nattachments, URLs, and landing pages in real time—recognizes the BulletProofLink phishing\nkit that serves the false sign-in pages and detects the associated emails and URLs.\n\nIn addition, based on our research into BulletProofLink and other PhaaS operations, we\nobserved that numerous phishing kits leverage the code and behaviors of existing kits, such\nas those sold by BulletProofLink. Any kit that attempts to leverage similar techniques, or\nstitch together code from multiple kits can similarly be detected and remediated before the\nuser receives the email or engages with the content.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith [Microsoft 365 Defender, we re able to further expand that protection, for example, by](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\nblocking of phishing websites and other malicious URLs and domains in the browser through\n[Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, as well as the detection of suspicious and malicious](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview)\nbehavior on endpoints. Advanced hunting capabilities allow customers to search through key\nmetadata fields on mailflow for the indicators listed in this blog and other anomalies. Email\nthreat data is correlated with signals from endpoints and other domains, providing even\nricher intelligence and expanding investigation capabilities.\n\nTo build resilience against phishing attacks in general, organizations can use anti-phishing\npolicies to enable mailbox intelligence settings, as well as configure impersonation protection\n[settings for specific messages and sender domains. Enabling SafeLinks ensures real-time](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links?view=o365-worldwide)\nprotection by scanning at time of delivery and at time of click.\n\nIn addition to taking full advantage of the tools available in Microsoft Defender for Office 365,\nadministrators can further strengthen defenses against the threat of phishing by securing the\n[Azure AD identity infrastructure. We strongly recommend enabling multifactor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)\n[and blocking sign-in attempts from legacy authentication.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication)\n\nLearn how you can stop credential phishing and other email threats through
