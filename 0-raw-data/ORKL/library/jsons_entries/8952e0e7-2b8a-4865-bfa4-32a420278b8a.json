I thought I would blog if anyone wanted a pcap\nto look at.\n\nI actually found this through my normal malvertising route. After pondering and assistance\nthe payload was determined to be Smoke Loader leading to a Miner and AZORult stealer. It’s\n[an interesting sample! Thanks to @James_inthe_box for looking into it deeper.](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box)\n\n## Background Information:\n\nA few articles on Rig exploit kit and it’s evolution:\n\n[https://www.uperesia.com/analyzing-rig-exploit-kit](https://www.uperesia.com/analyzing-rig-exploit-kit)\n\n[http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2016/10/rig-evolves-neutrino-waves-goodbye.html](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2016/10/rig-evolves-neutrino-waves-goodbye.html)\n\n[http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55354/cyber-crime/rig-exploit-kit-cerber.html](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55354/cyber-crime/rig-exploit-kit-cerber.html)\n\n## Downloads\n\n(in password protected zip)\n\n[13-October-2017-Rig-Miner-PCAP-> Pcap of traffic](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/13-october-2017-rig-miner-pcap.zip)\n[13-October-2017-Rig-Miner-CSV-> CSV of traffic for IOC’s](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/13-october-2017-rig-miner-csv.zip)\n[13-October-2017-Rig-Miner-> Smoke Loader –](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/13-october-2017-rig-miner.zip)\n60489385b91478d36e4d027e70d662a861f305cc5d4bdce20f312ac1c7c2f126\n\n## Details of infection chain:\n\n(click to enlarge!)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Full Details:\n\n[This campaign was spotted a few days back (clicky) by](http://www.broadanalysis.com/2017/10/09/rig-exploit-kit-via-malvertising-redirects/) [@BroadAnalysis. I however found](https://twitter.com/BroadAnalysis?lang=en)\nthis through my usual malvertising campaign. It was only after that I realised that the IP of\nthe domain is the same as the previous post that was reported. The payload however is\n[different and much like the Rulan campaign it is likely the payloads will change often so it’s](https://zerophagemalware.com/2017/09/11/rig-ek-via-rulan-drops-quant-loader-leads-to-ursnif/)\nworth keeping an eye on this.\nThe chain involves a series of 302 redirects:\n\nThe final redirect takes the client to Rig EK:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload was actually very interesting. I noticed a process injection which is Smoke\nLoader. I then saw the two binaries one of which was a miner and the other is AZORult\n[stealer. I did upload the sample to Hybrid Analysis here are the results:](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/60489385b91478d36e4d027e70d662a861f305cc5d4bdce20f312ac1c7c2f126?environmentId=100)\n\nNow on my lab I did not see the mining C2 which connected to 213.32.29.150:14444.\nHowever it did change the same registry key from the sandbox analysis. Below are two\nexamples of POST requests from the first binary believed to be Smoke Loader:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second binary is “Asus Gaming” that produced the zbot like POST requests to C2. This\nis actually AZORult:\n\n**SHA-256** [2919a13b964c8b006f144e3c8cc6563740d3d242f44822c8c44dc0db38137ccb](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2919a13b964c8b006f144e3c8cc6563740d3d242f44822c8c44dc0db38137ccb/detection)\n\n\n**File**\n**name**\n\n\nAsus Gaming.exe\n\n\n**File size** 270.5 KB\n\n\n-----\n\nThere’s a lot going on here! Enjoy.\n\n\n-----",
