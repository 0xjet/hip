By ‘Russian­language market’ we mean\n\ncybercriminals who are citizens of the Russian Federation\n\nand some former USSR countries, predominantly Ukraine\n\nand the Baltic states. Why is this market known\n\nworldwide? There are two main factors: the first of these is\n\nfrequent global media coverage of the activity of Russian­\n\nlanguage cybercriminals. The second is the open\n\naccessibility of online platforms used by the cybercriminal\n\ncommunity for communications, promoting a variety of\n\n“services” and “products” and discussing their quality and\n\nmethods of application, if not for making actual deals.\n\nOver time, the range of “products” and “services” available\n\nthrough this underground market has evolved, becoming\n\nmore focused on financial attacks, and with an ever­\n\nincreasing level of sophistication. One of the most\n\ncommon types of cybercrime was (and still is) the turnover\n\nof stolen payment card data. With the emergence of online\n\nstores and other services involving e­payment\n\n\n-----\n\nbecome especially popular with the fraudsters whose main\n\ntargets are users’ payment data or the theft of money\n\ndirectly from user accounts or companies.\n\nAttacks on users’ and companies’ e­wallets were initiated\n\nby the Trojan ibank in 2006; then came ZeuS (2007) and\n\nSpyEye (2009) followed by the groups Carberp (2010) and\n\nCarbanak (2013). And this list is incomplete; there are\n\nmore Trojans out there, used by criminals to steal users’\n\nmoney and data.\n\nWith online financial transactions becoming more\n\ncommon, the organizations supporting such operations\n\nare becoming more attractive to cybercriminals. Over the\n\nlast few years, cybercriminals have been increasingly\n\nattacking not just the customers of banks and online\n\nstores, but the enabling banks and payments systems\n\n[directly. The story of the Carbanak cybergroup which](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/)\n\nspecializes in attacking banks and was exposed earlier\n\nthis year by Kaspersky Lab is a clear confirmation of this\n\ntrend.\n\nKaspersky Lab experts have been monitoring the Russian\n\nhacker underground since it first emerged. Kaspersky Lab\n\n[regularly issues reports on financial cyber­threats which](https://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-bulletin/68720/financial-cyber-threats-in-2014-things-changed/)\n\ntrack changes in the number of financial malware attacks\n\ncarried out over time. Information on the number of\n\nattacks may indicate the extent of the problem but does\n\nnot reveal anything about who creates them and how. We\n\nhope that our review will help to shed light on this aspect\n\nof financial cybercrime.\n\n#### Between 2012­ 15, law\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F72782%2Frussian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works%2F&text=Between+2012-15%2C+law+enforcement+agencies+arrested+over+160+Russian-speaking+cybercriminals) enforcement\n\n#### agencies arrested over 160 Russian­speaking cybercriminals\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data presented in this article is compiled from dozens\n\nof investigations that Kaspersky Lab experts have\n\nparticipated in over the last few years, as well as their\n\nmany years’ experience observing the Russian cybercrime\n\nmarket.\n\n## Situation overview\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab, between 2012 and 2015, law\n\nenforcement agencies from a number of different\n\ncountries, including the United States, Russia, Belarus,\n\nUkraine and the EU arrested over 160 Russian­speaking\n\ncybercriminals who were members of small, medium­sized\n\nand large criminal groups. They were all suspected of\n\nbeing engaged in stealing money using malware. The total\n\ndamage resulting from their worldwide activity exceeded\n\n$790 million dollars. (This estimate is based both on the\n\nanalysis of public information about the arrests of people\n\nsuspected of committing financial cybercrime in the period\n\nbetween 2012 and 2015 and on Kaspersky Lab’s own\n\ndata.) Of this sum, about $509 million dollars was stolen\n\noutside the borders of the former USSR. Of course, this\n\nfigure only includes confirmed losses, the details of which\n\nwere obtained by law enforcement authorities during the\n\ninvestigation. In reality, cybercriminals could have stolen a\n\nmuch larger amount.\n\n**_The number of arrests of Russian­speaking_**\n\n**_cybercriminals as officially announced during the_**\n\n\n-----\n\nInvestigation team has participated in the investigation of\n\nmore than 330 cybersecurity incidents. More than 95% of\n\nthese were connected with the theft of money or financial\n\ninformation.\n\nAlthough the number of arrests of Russian­language\n\ncriminals suspected of financial cybercrime increased\n\nsignificantly in 2015 compared with the previous year, the\n\ncybercriminal market is still “crowded.” According to\n\nKaspersky Lab experts, over the last three years Russian­\n\nlanguage cybercrime has recruited up to a thousand\n\npeople. These include people involved in the creation of\n\ninfrastructure, and writing and distributing malware code to\n\nsteal money, as well as those who either stole or cashed\n\nthe stolen money. Most of those arrested are still not in\n\nprison.\n\nWe can calculate fairly precisely the number of people\n\nwho make up the core structure of an active criminal\n\ngroup: the organizers, the money flow managers involved\n\nin withdrawing money from compromised accounts and\n\nthe professional hackers. Across the cybercriminal\n\nunderground, there are only around 20 of these core\n\nprofessionals. They are regular visitors of underground\n\nforums, and Kaspersky Lab experts have collected a\n\nconsiderable amount of information that suggests that\n\nthese 20 people play leading roles in criminal activities\n\nthat involve the online theft of money and information.\n\nThe exact number of groups operating across Russia and\n\nits neighboring countries is unknown: many of those\n\ninvolved in criminal activities participate in several thefts\n\nand then, for various reasons cease their activity. Some\n\nparticipants of known but apparently disbanded groups\n\ncontinue their criminal activities as part of new groups.\n\nKaspersky Lab’s Computer Incidents Investigation\n\nDepartment can now confirm the activity of at least five\n\nmajor cybercriminal groups specializing in financial\n\ncrimes. These are the groups whose activities have been\n\nmonitored by the company’s experts over the last few\n\n\n-----\n\nexperts in 2012­2013, and are still active. They each\n\nnumber between ten and 40 people. At least two of them\n\nare actively attacking targets not only in Russia but also in\n\nthe USA, the UK, Australia, France, Italy and Germany.\n\n#### There are ~20 of people, who\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F72782%2Frussian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works%2F&text=There+are+%7E20+of+people%2C+who+make+up+the+core+structure+of+an+active+criminal+group) make up the core\n\n#### structure of an active criminal group\n\nSince the investigation into these groups has not been\n\ncompleted, it is not possible to publish more detailed\n\ninformation on the activities of these groups. Kaspersky\n\nLab continues to investigate their activity and is\n\ncooperating with the law enforcement agencies of Russia\n\nand other countries in order to curb their cybercriminal\n\nbusiness.\n\nInvestigation into the activities of these groups has\n\nallowed Kaspersky Lab experts to form an idea about their\n\nmethods of operation and the structure of the\n\ncybercriminal market.\n\n## The structure of the Russian- language cybercriminal market\n\n### “A Range of products and services”\n\nThe cybercriminal market usually comprises a set of\n\n“services” and “products”, used for various illegal actions\n\nin cyberspace. These “products” and “services” are\n\noffered to users of dedicated online communities, most of\n\nwhich are closed to outsiders.\n\n\n-----\n\nSoftware designed to gain unauthorized access to a\n\ncomputer or a mobile device, in order to steal data\n\nfrom an infected device or money from a victim’s\n\naccount (the Trojans);\n\nSoftware designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities\n\nin the software installed on a victim’s computer\n\n(exploits);\n\nDatabases of stolen credit card data and other\n\nvaluable information;\n\nInternet traffic (a certain number of visits to a\n\ncustomer­selected site by users with a specific profile.)\n\nThe “services” include:\n\nSpam distribution;\n\nOrganization of DDoS attacks (overloading sites with\n\nrequests in order to make them unavailable to\n\nlegitimate users);\n\nTesting malware for antivirus detection;\n\n“Packing” of malware (changing malicious software\n\nwith the help of special software (packers) so that it is\n\nnot detected by antivirus software);\n\nRenting out exploit packs;\n\nRenting out dedicated servers;\n\nVPN (providing anonymous access to web resources,\n\nprotection of the data exchange);\n\nRenting out abuse­resistant hosting (hosting that does\n\nnot respond to complaints about malicious content,\n\nand therefore does not disable the server);\n\nRenting out botnets;\n\nEvaluation of the stolen credit card data;\n\nServices to validate the data (fake calls, fake\n\ndocument scans);\n\nPromotion of malicious and advertising sites in search\n\nresults (Black SEO);\n\nMediation of transactions for the acquisition of\n\n“products” and “services”;\n\nWithdrawal of money and cashing.\n\nPayments for such “products” and “services” on the\n\ncybercriminal market are generally made via an e­\n\npayment system such as WebMoney Perfect Money\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of these “products” and “services” are bought and sold\n\nin various combinations in order to enable four main types\n\nof crime. These types can also be combined in various\n\nways depending on the criminal group:\n\nDDoS attacks (ordered or carried out for the purpose\n\nof extortion);\n\nTheft of personal information and data to access e­\n\nmoney (for the purpose of resale or money theft);\n\nTheft of money from the accounts of banks or other\n\norganizations;\n\nDomestic or corporate espionage;\n\nBlocking access to data on the infected computer for\n\nthe purpose of extortion;\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab experts, the theft of money is\n\ncurrently the most widespread type of crime. The rest of\n\nthis report therefore focuses on this segment of the\n\nRussian­language cybercrime market.\n\n### The “labor market” of financial cybercrime\n\nThe variety of skills required for the creation of “products”\n\nand the provision of “services” has given rise to a unique\n\nlabor market of professionals involved in financial\n\ncybercrime.\n\nThe list of key roles is almost exactly the same as that\n\nseen in any IT­related company:\n\nProgrammers / encoders / virus writers (for the\n\ncreation of new malicious software and modification of\n\nexisting malware);\n\nWeb designers (for the creation of phishing pages,\n\nemails, etc.);\n\nSystem administrators (for the construction and\n\nsupport of the IT infrastructure);\n\nTesters (to test the malicious software);\n\n“Cryptors” (responsible for the packing of malicious\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list does not include the heads of the criminal groups,\n\nthe money flow managers engaged in withdrawing money\n\nfrom compromised accounts, and the heads of money\n\nmules supervising the process of cashing the stolen\n\nmoney. This is because the relationship between these\n\nelements of the criminal groups is not an employer­\n\nemployee one, but more of a partnership.\n\nDepending on the type and extent of the criminal\n\nenterprise, the heads of the groups either employ “staff”\n\nand pay them a fixed salary or work with them on a\n\nfreelance basis paying for a particular project.\n\n_An offer of employment posted on a semi­closed forum inviting a_\n\n_programmer to join a cybercriminal group. The job requirements_\n\n_include experience in writing complex bots._\n\n“Employees” are recruited either via sites where those\n\ninvolved in criminal activity traditionally gather or via\n\nresources for those interested in non­standard ways of\n\nmaking money online. In some cases, the ads are placed\n\non mainstream job search sites or on the labor exchanges\n\nfor remote employees.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F72782%2Frussian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works%2F&text=We+can+confirm+the+activity+of+at+least+5+major+cybercriminal+groups+specializing+in+financial+crimes) the activity of at\n\n#### least 5 major cybercriminal groups specializing in financial crimes\n\nIn general, employees involved in cybercrime can be\n\ndivided into two types: those who are aware of the\n\nillegality of the project or the work they are offered, and\n\nthose who (at least in the beginning) know nothing about\n\nit. In the latter case, these are usually people performing\n\nrelatively simple operations such as copying the interface\n\nof banking systems and sites.\n\nBy advertising “real” job vacancies, cybercriminals often\n\nexpect to find employees from the remote regions of\n\nRussia and neighboring countries (mostly Ukraine) where\n\nproblems with employment opportunities and salaries for\n\nIT specialists are quite severe.\n\n_A fraudster has advertised a job vacancy for java / flash specialists_\n\n_on a popular Ukrainian website. The job requirements include a_\n\n_good level of programming skills in Java, Flash, knowledge of JVM /_\n\n_AVM specifications, and others. The organizer offers remote work_\n\n_and full employment with a salary of $2,500._\n\n\n-----\n\nsimple – they carry a saving because staff can be paid\n\nless than employees based in large cities. Criminals also\n\noften give preference to candidates who have not\n\npreviously been involved in cybercrime activity.\n\nOften, such job offers are presented as legitimate work,\n\nwith the true purpose of the work only becoming clear\n\nonce the task is received.\n\n_In this example, the organizer of the criminal group offers a job to a_\n\n_javascript programmer, masking it under a vacancy at a “Web­_\n\n_innovation studio specializing in the development of highly_\n\n_sophisticated Internet applications.”_\n\nIn the case of illegal job search sites, less­experienced\n\ncandidates are expected.\n\n\n-----\n\n_software. In this context_ _custom software means malicious_\n\n_software._\n\nThe second reason in favor of remote “personnel” is the\n\norganizer’s aim of making the activity of the group as\n\nanonymous as possible, and to ensure that no single\n\ncontractor possesses complete information about the\n\ngroup.\n\n### Options for organizing a criminal group\n\nCriminal groups involved in stealing money or financial\n\ninformation that will enable them to get access to money,\n\ndiffer in the number of participants and scope of activities.\n\nThere are three main types of involvement:\n\nAffiliate programs\n\nSingle dealers, small and middle­sized groups (up to\n\nten members)\n\nLarge organized groups (ten or more participants)\n\nThis division is nominal. The scale of the group’s activity\n\ndepends on the skillfulness of its participants, their\n\nambition and the overall level of organizational abilities. In\n\nsome cases, Kaspersky Lab experts came across\n\nrelatively small criminal groups performing tasks that\n\nusually require a greater number of participants.\n\n##### Affiliate programs\n\nAffiliate programs are the easiest and least expensive\n\nmethod of getting involved in cybercrime activities. The\n\nidea behind an affiliate program is that the organizers\n\nprovide their “affiliates” with almost all the tools they need\n\nto commit a crime. The task of the “affiliates” is to\n\ngenerate as many successful malware infections as\n\npossible. In return, the owner or owners of the affiliate\n\nprogram share the income received as a result of these\n\ninfections with the affiliates. Depending on the type of\n\nfraudulent scheme this could be a share of:\n\n\n-----\n\nusers;\n\nThe money paid by the user as a ransom when\n\ncybercriminals use ransomware Trojans;\n\nThe money stolen from the “prepaid” accounts of\n\nmobile device users by sending out SMS messages to\n\npremium mobile numbers with the help of a malicious\n\nprogram.\n\nCreating and supporting an affiliate program for the\n\npurpose of stealing money is a cybercrime committed, as\n\na rule, by a group of users. However, such projects are\n\noften carried out by large organized groups whose activity\n\nis analyzed later in this document.\n\n_This advertisement announces the launch of the beta testing of an_\n\n_affiliate program used to distribute encrypting ransomware. Judging_\n\n_by its characteristics, the group’s activity is focused on companies_\n\n_located in the US and the UK. This is indicated by the comment_\n\n_saying that the malware distributed via the partner network is able to_\n\n_encrypt files with 80 different extensions, many of which are files of_\n\n_applications used in companies. The text on requirements for_\n\n_candidates to participate in testing includes a demonstration of the_\n\n_presence of traffic or downloads from the United States and the_\n\n_United Kingdom._\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab experts, affiliate programs\n\nare becoming less popular with Russian­language\n\ncybercriminals. The main driver of their popularity had\n\nbeen fraudulent schemes used to infect users’ mobile\n\ndevices with malicious programs which then sent out SMS\n\nmessages to premium numbers. However, in the spring of\n\n2014, the Russian regulator introduced new requirements\n\n\n-----\n\nneed to secure additional confirmation of subscription to a\n\nparticular paid mobile service. This change was\n\ninstrumental in reducing the number of malicious mobile\n\npartner programs to practically zero. Nevertheless, this\n\ntype of joint cybercriminal activity is still used by groups\n\nspecializing in the distribution of encrypting ransomware.\n\n##### Small Groups\n\nWhat distinguishes this form of cybercriminal activity from\n\nan affiliate program is that in this instance the criminal or\n\ncriminals organize their own fraudulent scheme. Most of\n\nthe components needed for the attack, such as malware\n\nand its modifications (“re­packed” malware), the traffic, the\n\nservers, etc., are bought on the black market. Often,\n\nmembers of such groups are not experts in the field of\n\ncomputer and network technologies; they learn about the\n\ncomponents and organization of financial attacks from\n\npublic sources, usually forums. The abilities of such\n\ngroups can be restricted by a number of factors.\n\nSpecifically, the use of widely­available malware results in\n\nrapid detection by security solutions. This, in turn, makes\n\ncybercriminals invest more money in the distribution of\n\nmalware and in its “re­packing” to bypass detection. The\n\nend result is a significant drop in profits for the attacker.\n\nMistakes made by this type of cybercriminal often result in\n\ntheir identification and arrest. However, as a relatively low\n\ncost entry into the world of cybercriminal activity (from $\n\n200), this “amateur” format continues to attract new\n\ndealers.\n\nAn example of such an “amateur” criminal organization is\n\nthe group that in 2012 was convicted by the Russian court\n\nfor stealing more than 13 million rubles (then worth about\n\n$422,000) from a Russian bank’s online customers.\n\nDuring a comprehensive investigation Kaspersky Lab\n\nexperts were able to collect the information that allowed\n\nlaw enforcement authorities to identify those behind the\n\ntheft.\n\n\n-----\n\nyears. However, this verdict did not stop the criminals, and\n\nthey continued to commit crimes, stealing almost as much\n\nagain over the next two and a half years. They were re­\n\narrested in May 2015.\n\n##### Large organized criminal groups\n\nLarge criminal groups differ from the other players, both\n\nthrough a larger scale of activity and through a more\n\nthorough approach to the organization and operation of\n\ncriminal schemes. Such groups can comprise up to\n\nseveral dozen people (not including money mules used for\n\ncashing and “laundering” money.) The targets of their\n\nattacks are not limited to individual online banking\n\ncustomers: they also attack small and medium­sized\n\ncompanies, while the largest and most sophisticated of\n\nthem, such as Carbanak focus mostly on banks and e­\n\npayment systems.\n\nThe operational structure of large groups differs\n\nsignificantly from smaller groups. To a certain extent, the\n\nstructure reflects that of an ordinary, average­sized\n\ncompany engaged in software development.\n\nIn particular, large groups have some form of regular staff\n\n– a group of associates who perform organizational tasks\n\nin return for a regular, fixed payment. However, even in\n\nthese large, professional groups some of the tasks are\n\npassed to third­party contractors. For example, the “re­\n\npacking” of malware can be performed by the staff or hired\n\nvirus writers or via third­party services where the process\n\nis automated with the help of special software. The same\n\nis true for many other elements of the IT infrastructure\n\nrequired for committing crime.\n\nExamples of large, organized criminal groups are Carberp,\n\nwhose members were arrested in Russia and Ukraine in\n\n2012 and 2013 respectively, and Carbanak, unmasked by\n\nKaspersky Lab in early 2015.\n\nAlthough the damage from the activity of partner programs\n\n\n-----\n\nand destructive. The estimated damage caused by\n\nCarberp reaches several hundred million dollars (up to a\n\nbillion). In this regard, studying how these groups function\n\nand the tactics they use is extremely important, as it\n\nstrengthens our ability to effectively investigate their\n\nactivity and – ultimately – to suppress it.\n\n## Distribution of roles in a large cybercriminal group\n\nA major financial cybercrime undertaken by criminal\n\n“experts” in security and the finance sector can result in\n\nmulti­million dollar losses for attacked organizations. As a\n\nrule, such crimes are preceded by many months of\n\npreparation. This preparation includes constructing\n\ncomplex infrastructure, and selecting and developing\n\nmalicious software, as well as a thorough study of the\n\ntarget organization in order to clarify the details of its\n\ninternal operations and security vulnerabilities. Each\n\nmember of the criminal group has their own\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n\n-----\n\ninvolved in stealing money. The distribution of roles in\n\ngroups that specialize in other types of cybercrime may be\n\ndifferent.\n\n### Virus writer/Programmer\n\nA virus writer or programmer is responsible for creating\n\nmalicious programs, i.e. the programs that allow the\n\nattackers to gain a foothold in the corporate network of the\n\ntarget organization, download additional malware that will\n\nhelp to obtain the necessary information, and ultimately\n\nsteal money.\n\nThe significance of this group member and the nature of\n\ntheir relationship with the organizers may vary from group\n\nto group. For example, if the group uses ready­made\n\nmalware taken from open sources or bought from other\n\nvirus writers, their functions may be limited to setting and\n\nmodifying malicious programs to work in the infrastructure\n\ncreated specifically for a certain cybercrime, or to adapt it\n\nfor attacks on specific institutions. The most advanced\n\ngroups, however, tend to rely on their own “developments”\n\nsince it makes a malicious program less visible to most\n\nsecurity solutions and provides more opportunities for\n\nmalware modification. Where this is the case, the virus\n\nwriter’s role becomes more important as they are\n\nresponsible for the architecture and feature set of a\n\nmalicious program.\n\nA virus writer can also take on responsibility for malware\n\n“re­packing”. But this happens only when the organizer\n\nwants to keep the maximum number of tasks within the\n\ngroup, and where original software is used for malware\n\n“re­packing”. In most cases, however, this procedure is\n\nshifted to third­party contractors or packing­services.\n\n### Testers\n\nThe function of testers in a criminal group is not that\n\ndifferent from testers working in legal IT companies. In\n\nboth cases testers receive from their managers the\n\n\n-----\n\nenvironments (different versions of operating systems,\n\ndifferent sets of installed applications, etc.) and execute\n\nthem. If a fraudulent scheme involves fake interfaces of\n\nremote banking or e­payment systems, the task of testers\n\nalso includes monitoring the correct operation of these\n\nfakes.\n\n### Web designers and Web programmers\n\nTypically, web designers and web programmers are\n\nremote employees, whose tasks include creating phishing\n\npages and websites, fake application interfaces and web\n\ninjects, all of which are used to steal data to get access to\n\ne­payment and e­banking system.\n\n### Distributors\n\nDistributors aim to ensure the download of malicious\n\nsoftware on as many devices as possible. The result is\n\nachieved by using several tools. Generally, the group\n\norganizer determines the profile of the users to be infected\n\nand buys the required type of traffic from the so­called\n\ntraffic providers (services to attract users with certain\n\ncharacteristics to a particular website).\n\n_An advert offering to buy traffic. Cybercriminals are willing to pay_\n\n_only for the successful installation of malicious software at $ 140 per_\n\n_1000 “call­backs” (a message that is sent by the malware to the_\n\n_d_ _f_ _f l i f_ _i_ _)_\n\n\n-----\n\nwill contain either an infected attached file or a link taking\n\na victim to a malicious website. The organizers can also\n\nchoose the site with the necessary target audience;\n\ninvolve hackers in breaking into it and placing the exploit\n\npack on it. Of course, all these tools can be used in\n\ncombination with each other.\n\n### Hackers\n\nOften, in the course of an attack, the exploits and other\n\nmalicious software the organizer has to hand is not\n\nenough to infect all the computers necessary for the attack\n\nand to anchor in them. It may become necessary to hack\n\ninto a specific computer or site. In such cases, the\n\norganizers involve hackers, people who have considerable\n\nskills in information security and are able to perform non­\n\nstandard tasks. In many of the cases examined by\n\nKaspersky Lab experts, hackers were occasionally\n\ninvolved and were paid on a fee­for­service basis.\n\nHowever, if hacking is required regularly (e.g., for targeted\n\nattacks on financial institutions), a hacker becomes a\n\n“team member” and is often one of the cybercriminal\n\ngroup’s key participants, along with the organizers and\n\nmoney flow managers.\n\n### System administrators\n\nSystem administrators in cybercriminal groups perform\n\nnear­identical tasks to their counterparts in legitimate\n\nbusinesses: they implement the IT infrastructure and\n\nmaintain it in working condition. Cybercriminal system\n\nadministrators configure management servers, buy abuse­\n\nresistant hostings for servers, ensure the availability of\n\ntools for anonymous connection to the servers (VPN) and\n\nresolve other technical challenges, including the\n\ninteraction with remote system administrators hired to\n\nperform small tasks.\n\n### Call services\n\nSocial engineering is important for the success of the\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks on organizations that result in the theft of huge\n\nsums of money. In most cases, even if the attackers are\n\nable to establish control over the computer from which the\n\ntransaction could be performed, confirmation of its\n\nlegitimacy is required to successfully complete the\n\noperation. This is what the “call service” is for. At the\n\nspecified time, its “employees” play the role of an\n\nemployee of the attacked organization or a bank with\n\nwhich the organization works, and confirm the legitimacy\n\nof the transaction.\n\n“Call services” can participate in a particular cybercrime\n\nboth as a subdivision of the criminal group, or as a third­\n\nparty organization, performing a specific task on a fee­for­\n\nservice basis. The forums that users involved in\n\ncybercrime use to communicate with each carry plenty of\n\nads offering such services.\n\n_This advertisement offers “call services” in English, German, Dutch_\n\n_and French. The group specializes in calls to Internet stores and_\n\n_banks, as well to duped mules. Also, the group offers the quick_\n\n_creation of local toll­free numbers used to imitate support services in_\n\n_fraudulent schemes, receiving SMS messages, and receiving and_\n\n_sending faxes. The criminals ask from $10 to $12 for one call, $ 10_\n\n_for receiving SMS and from $ 15 for creating toll­free numbers._\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab, large cybercriminal groups\n\nprefer to have their own “call services” so they hardly ever\n\nturn to third­party providers.\n\n### Money flow managers\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup who come into play when all the technical tasks for\n\norganizing the attack (choosing and infecting the target\n\nand anchoring in its infrastructure) are fulfilled, and\n\neverything is ready to commit the theft. Money flow\n\nmanagers are the people who withdraw money from\n\ncompromised accounts. However, their participation is not\n\nlimited to pressing the keys; they play a key role in the\n\nwhole process.\n\n#### The list of key roles in financial\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F72782%2Frussian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works%2F&text=The+list+of+key+roles+in+financial+cyber+gangs+almost+mirrors+IT-companies) cyber gangs\n\n#### almost mirrors IT­ companies\n\nMoney flow managers usually thoroughly understand the\n\ninternal rules of the attacked organization (they even know\n\nthe lunch hours of the employee from whose computer the\n\nfraudulent transaction will be made). They know how the\n\nautomated anti­fraud systems operate and how to bypass\n\nthem. In other words, in addition to their criminal role of\n\nthieves, money flow managers perform “expert” tasks that\n\nare difficult or impossible to automate. Perhaps because\n\nof this special status, money flow managers are one of the\n\nfew members of the criminal group who receive a\n\npercentage of the stolen money rather than a fixed\n\n“salary”.\n\nMoney flow managers often perform as botnet operators.\n\ni.e. members of the criminal group who analyze and\n\nclassify the information obtained from infected computers\n\n(the access to the remote banking services, availability of\n\nmoney on the accounts which could be accessed, the\n\norganization where the infected computer is located, etc.).\n\nBesides money loaders, these “working conditions” are\n\nonly shared by the leaders of mule projects.\n\n### Head of M les (M le “ roject”\n\n\n-----\n\n### )\n\nHead of mules is a representative of the criminal group\n\nworking closely with the people involved in the process of\n\nstealing money. The function of the mules is to get the\n\nstolen money, cash it and transfer to the criminal group its\n\ndue share. To do this, the head of mules builds their own\n\ninfrastructure, which consists of legal entities and\n\nindividuals with their own bank accounts, to which the\n\nstolen money is transferred and from which it is later\n\nwithdrawn and moved into the pockets of the fraudsters.\n\nThe mule project leader cooperates with the organizer of\n\nthe criminal group, and provides them with the numbers of\n\nthe accounts to which the money loader sends the stolen\n\nmoney. Both mule project leaders and money flow\n\nmanagers work on commission which, according to the\n\ninformation obtained by Kaspersky Lab during the course\n\nof investigation, can amount to half the sum stolen.\n\n### Mule “projects”\n\nMule projects are a vital component of any financial\n\ncybercrime. Such groups comprise one or more\n\norganizers and up to several dozen individual mules.\n\nA mule (or drop) is a holder of a means of payment who,\n\non command from the money mules manager, cashes the\n\nmoney received into their/an account, or transfers it to\n\nanother account as specified by the money mules\n\nmanager.\n\nMules can be divided into two types: duped and non­\n\nduped. Duped mules are people who, at least at the\n\nbeginning of their cooperation with the money mules\n\nmanager, do not realize they are involved in a criminal\n\nscheme. As a rule, the task of getting and transferring\n\nmoney is presented to them under some plausible pretext.\n\nFor example, the money mules manager can establish a\n\nlegal entity and appoint to an executive position (the\n\ngeneral or financial director, for example) a person who\n\nwill perform the functions of the duped mule: such as\n\nsigning corporate documents which will, in fact serve as a\n\n\n-----\n\nthe money mules manager’s tasks.\n\nThe options used by the mule projects to withdraw money\n\nare manifold. Depending on the amount of money stolen,\n\nthey may include individual credit card holders ready to\n\ncash money and give it to the representative of the money\n\nmules manager for a small fee, or specially created legal\n\nentities, whose representatives open “salary projects”\n\n(credit cards for transferring the salaries of company\n\nemployees) at their corporate bank.\n\nYet another common method for constructing a mule\n\nscheme is for non­duped mules to open dozens of\n\naccounts at different banks.\n\n_This advert offers sets of payment cards (the card, the documents_\n\n_based on which the card was authorized, the SIM card with which_\n\n_the bank account of the card is associated) that can be used for_\n\n_cashing stolen money. For sale is the card issued by Russian banks_\n\n_and banks from neighboring countries, as well as banks from the_\n\n_countries of Europe, Asia and the United States. The Momentum­_\n\n_type set is costs 3000 rubles (less than $50), the set with the_\n\n_Platinum card – eight thousand rubles (about $120)._\n\nWhen the theft occurs outside of Russia, the role of the\n\nnon­duped mules is performed by a citizen or group of\n\ncitizens of an Eastern Europe country, who within a short\n\nperiod of time visit several countries on the continent and\n\nin each of them open accounts in their names. Then the\n\nd l id th l ith\n\n\n-----\n\nused later to withdraw the stolen money.\n\n_An example of an ad offering for sale a list of companies registered_\n\n_in the Russian Federation and in the offshore zone. The services of_\n\n_cybercriminals cost from $560 to $750._\n\n### Stuffers\n\nThe word “stuffer” comes from the word “stuff” (a\n\ncolloquial word for “goods”). One way to withdraw stolen\n\nmoney is by buying goods in e­stores with the stolen\n\nmoney, reselling them and returning to the fraudsters their\n\ndue percent. This is done by the stuffers, members of the\n\ncybercriminal groups engaged in spending money from\n\ncompromised accounts on purchasing goods in online\n\nstores.\n\nIn fact, a stuffer is a variation of the money flow manager.\n\nWithdrawing money by purchasing goods is generally\n\npracticed if the stolen sums are relatively small. As a rule,\n\nthe stuffers work in a team with the fences. Working “in\n\ntandem” often involves purchasing a certain type of goods,\n\nsometimes from a specific manufacturer or a clearly­\n\ndefined model.\n\n### Organizer\n\nIf we consider cybercrime as a project, the organizer of\n\nthe criminal group is its general manager. Their duties\n\nusually include financing the preparatory phase of the\n\nattack, allocating tasks to executors, monitoring their\n\n\n-----\n\nhave its own). The organizer determines the targets for\n\nattacks, selects the necessary “specialists” and negotiates\n\nwith them.\n\n## Stages of the attacks\n\nIt should be noted that the above classifications are not\n\nset in stone. In some cases, a single member of the\n\ncriminal group can combine several roles. Nevertheless,\n\nregardless of how many people execute them, each of the\n\nroles described can be found when investigating almost\n\nevery money­related cybercriminal incident. Here’s how\n\nthey work in “real time.”\n\n1. **Exploration. When it comes to targeted attacks on a**\n\nspecific company, the organizer first instructs the\n\ncontractors to collect information about the company,\n\nwhich will help to develop a plausible social\n\nengineering scheme for the first stage of attack. If we\n\nare talking about an attack on individual users, the\n\npreliminary exploration stage is skipped or limited to\n\nchoosing a “target audience” for the attack (for\n\nexample, the users of the online banking service of a\n\nspecific bank) and creating phishing emails and\n\nphishing sites with relevant content.\n\n2. **Infection. Penetration of the corporate network is**\n\nperformed by spear­phishing or a phishing mass­\n\nmailing that contains an attachment with the special\n\ndocument or a malicious web­link. Opening the\n\nattachment or following the link leads to malware\n\ninfection. Often, infection occurs automatically without\n\nthe user’s awareness or participation – after clicking\n\non the link, a malicious program is automatically\n\ndownloaded on the user’s computer (drive­by\n\ndownload) and runs on it.\n\nIn other cases, infection is carried out via\n\ncompromised popular sites on which a tool is placed\n\nthat invisibly redirects users to a third­party site\n\ncontaining a set of exploits Once on this site the user\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce inside the system cybercriminals use a number\n\nof malicious tools to consolidate their presence. For\n\nexample, to ensure that internal sites of compromised\n\norganizations have the malware reinstalled when the\n\norganization’s security software deletes the previous\n\nversion. In addition, attackers are often set up within\n\nthe infrastructure software of the attacked\n\norganization, enabling easy access to the internal\n\ncorporate network from outside.\n\n3. **Exploration and implementation. The programs for**\n\nremote, hidden administration and management are\n\ndownloaded onto compromised computers. They are\n\nused by cybercriminals to gain system administrators’\n\ncredentials. Legal programs for remote management\n\nand administration whose functionality is known to\n\nmany users are often used for this.\n\n4. **Money theft. In the final stage, cybercriminals access**\n\nthe financial systems of the targeted organization and\n\ntransfer money from its accounts to the accounts of\n\n[the mule projects or withdraw money directly at ATMs.](https://securelist.com/blog/research/66988/tyupkin-manipulating-atm-machines-with-malware/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFinancial cybercrime backed by Russian­speaking\n\ncriminals has become widespread in recent years and this\n\ngrowth is due to a number of causes. The main ones are:\n\nNot enough qualified staff in law enforcement\n\nagencies;\n\nInadequate legislation allowing criminals in many\n\ncases to avoid responsibility or to receive a lighter\n\nsentence;\n\nA lack of established procedures for international\n\ncooperation between law enforcement agencies and\n\nexpert organizations in different countries.\n\nUnlike the real world, a robbery in cyberspace usually\n\ngoes unnoticed and there is a very small window for\n\n\n-----\n\ncriminals have no need to stay in the country where the\n\ncrime is committed.\n\nUnfortunately, for Russian­speaking cybercriminals\n\ncurrent conditions are more than favorable: the risk of\n\nprosecution is low while the potential rewards are high. As\n\na result, the number of crimes and the damage caused by\n\nthem is growing, and the market for cybercriminal services\n\nis increasing momentum.\n\n#### A relatively low cost of entry ($\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F72782%2Frussian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works%2F&text=A+relatively+low+cost+of+entry+%28%24+200%29+to+cybercrime+attracts+new+dealers) 200) to\n\n#### cybercrime attracts new dealers\n\nThe lack of established mechanisms for international\n\ncooperation also plays into the hands of criminals: for\n\nexample, Kaspersky Lab experts know that the members\n\nof some criminal groups permanently reside and work in\n\nRussia’s neighbors, while the citizens of the neighboring\n\nstates involved in criminal activity often live and operate in\n\nthe territory of the Russian Federation.\n\nKaspersky Lab is doing everything possible to terminate\n\nthe activity of cybercriminal groups and encourages other\n\ncompanies and law enforcement agencies in all countries\n\nto cooperate.\n\nThe international investigation of Carbanak’s activity,\n\ninitiated by Kaspersky Lab, is the first example of\n\nsuccessful international cooperation. If the world is to see\n\na serious and positive change there should be more such\n\ncases.\n\n## Reference. What is Kaspersky\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lab Computer Incidents Investigation?\n\nKaspersky Lab is a well­known developer of anti­malware\n\nsecurity solutions. But the company provides\n\ncomprehensive protection, and this also includes services\n\nfor computer incidents investigation.\n\nEvidence of an incident, mainly presented in the form of\n\ndigital data, needs to be collected and recorded so that\n\nthere are no grounds for doubt in the investigation and trial\n\nwhen a victim makes a court application.\n\nKaspersky Lab Computer Incidents Investigation is\n\nresponsible for:\n\nResponding to IT security incidents and providing a\n\nquick analysis of the situation;\n\nCollecting digital evidence and determining the\n\ncircumstances of IT security incidents in accordance\n\nwith established procedures;\n\nAnalyzing the evidence collected, searching the\n\ninformation related to the circumstances of the\n\nincident on the Internet and fixing them;\n\nPreparing materials for the victim’s application to law\n\nenforcement agencies;\n\nProviding expert support to investigative operations.\n\nA huge amount of data is processed when responding to\n\nIT security incidents and supporting investigative\n\noperations. The analysis of this data, in combination with\n\nstatistics on malicious objects detected identifies the\n\ntrends of criminal behavior in cyberspace.\n\nThe Kaspersky Lab Computer Incidents Investigation\n\nDepartment was established in 2011 and involves six\n\nforensic experts.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN. 2016 PREDICTIONS\n\n\n###### BEACHES, CARNIVALS AND CYBERCRIME: A LOOK\n\n\n###### BEACHES, CARNIVALS AND CYBERCRIME: A LOOK\n\n\n###### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN. 2016 PREDICTIONS\n\n\n###### THERE IS 1 COMMENT\n\n[If you would like to comment on this article you must first login](https://securelist.com/wp-login.php)\n\n\n###### IT THREAT EVOLUTION IN Q3 2015\n\n\nJohn\n\nPosted on November 19, 2015. 2:00 pm\n\nSuperb article which nicely sets out the structure and operation of\n\nthese criminal networks.\n\nI have distributed a link to this article to several of my clients in the\n\nUK.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\n\n-----",
