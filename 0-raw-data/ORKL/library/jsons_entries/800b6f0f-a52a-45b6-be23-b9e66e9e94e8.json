Attackers can remotely connect to the compromised system from anywhere\naround the world. The Malware author generally uses this program to steal private information\nlike passwords, files, etc. It might also be used to install malicious software on the compromised\nsystems.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe initial Malware is a dropper that executes and drops a malicious file into the victim\nsystem without the consent of the user. The dropped file starts its execution and performs\nanti-VM checks to prevent the execution in any virtual environment. After which the Malware\nperforms various malicious activities, like Keylogging, and stealing sensitive information.\nThen it creates a legitimate process to communicate with the C2 server.\n\n**Infection**\n\nThe initial executable is a PE32 file, for Intel architecture compiled with .NET. It drops another\nexecutable in the temp folder with the name “Qlezrhhlbmw.exe”.\n\n_Figure 1_\n\nThe dropper when disassembled, shows classes with random generated names like\n“ADPRnBdJjt8XwX2FQm” and “eWANbC7fX237ucPNNr” to avoid detection and analysis.\n\n_Figure 2_\n\nOnce the actual RAT is dropped, its execution begins. To remain persistent in the system, the\nmalware creates copies of itself in the folder “c:\\\\programfiles(x86)\\rdns” as “windows”\nas shown in the figure below. The copy of the executable gets deleted after the execution gets\ncompleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt creates a legitimate process in firefox.exe and it injects a code using various functions as seen in\nthe below figure. It allocates memory through this step.\n\n_Figure 4_\n\nThe malware contains functionality to read the clipboard data with the “GetClipboardData”\nfunction as seen below. The return value of this function is the handle to a clipboard object.\n\n_Figure 5_\n\nIt also retrieves information about pressed keystrokes and acts as a Keylogger using the function\n“GetKeyboardState”. It gives the status of the 256-virtual keys.\n\n_Figure 6_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware also has a functionality to retrieve handle of the desktop window of the victim\nsystem using the functionality, “GetDesktopWindow”.\n\n_Figure 7_\n\n**Anti-VM & Anti-Debug Feature**\n\nThe malware performs various anti-VM checks on the victim machine. This statement is\nsupported with the figure shown below.\n\n_Figure 8_\n\nIt also checks for the presence of kernel debugger in the system. This can be observed\nbecause of the strings like “\\\\\\\\.\\\\Syser”, “\\\\\\\\.\\\\SyserDbgMsg” and\n“\\\\\\\\.\\\\SyserBoot”.\n\n_Figure 9_\n\n**Network Traffic Analysis**\n\nOnce it captures the information, the malware tries to communicate with the C2 server\n“aside.no-ip.org” using the foreign process i.e., firefox.exe as we can see in the below figure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE Attack Techniques Used**\n\n**Technique ID** **Technique**\nT1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\nT1055 Process Injection\n\nT1056 Input Capture\nT1115 Clipboard Data\nT1113 Screen Capture\nT1036 Masquerading\n\n**IOC’s**\n```\n4df346a12ef5679ec0b960d037c8f52a\n2cad1ad59e145139cbab70260b1a2f19\n\n```\n|Technique ID|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|T1497|Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion|\n|T1055|Process Injection|\n|T1056|Input Capture|\n|T1115|Clipboard Data|\n|T1113|Screen Capture|\n|T1036|Masquerading|\n\n```\nhxxp://asade.no-ip.org\n\n```\n```\n178.206.211.67\n\n```\n\n**Subex Secure Protection**\n\nSubex Secure detects the sample as “SS_AI_Trojan_PE”.\n\n**Our Honeypot Network**\n\nThis report has been prepared from the threat intelligence gathered by our Honeypot network.\nThis Honeypot network is today operational in 62 cities across the world. These cities have at least\none of the following attributes:\n\n- re landing centers for submarine cables\n\n- re internet traffic hotspots\n\n- ouse multiple IoT projects with a high number of connected endpoints\n\n- ouse multiple connected critical infrastructure projects\n\n- ave academic and research centers focusing on IoT\n\n- ave the potential to host multiple IoT projects across domains in the future.\n\nOver 3.5 million attacks a day is being registered across this network of individual Honeypots.\nThese attacks are studied, analysed, categorized, and marked according to a threat rank index, a\npriority assessment framework that we have developed within Subex. The Honeypot network\nincludes over 4000 physical and virtual devices covering over 400 device architectures and varied\nconnectivity mediums globally. These devices are grouped based on the sectors they belong to for\npurposes of understanding sectoral attacks. Thus, a layered flow of threat intelligence is made\npossible.\n\n\n-----",
