This system is managed via two\nTelegram channels (@noname05716 and @nn05716chat).\n\nIn this blog post we will examine two elements of NoName057(16)’s infrastructure; the\nmanagement infrastructure sitting behind the known C2 servers, and the attack infrastructure\nwhich is purportedly donated by their “volunteers”. In doing so we will seek to understand\nhow the operation functions, and provide information for cyber defenders to protect their\ninterests from future attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the current C2 server used to coordinate\nNoName057(16)’s campaigns; as previously reported by SentinelLabs - 31.13.195.87\n(NETERRA, BG). According to our records this server became operational on 19 December\n2022.\n\nTwo Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains, registered with No-IP, currently resolve to\n**31.13.195.87:**\n\ntom56gaz6poh13f28[.]myftp.org\n\nzig35m48zur14nel40[.]myftp.org\n\n[The DDoS tool (DDOSIA) receives targeting information from the /client/get_targets URL](https://www.radware.com/security/threat-advisories-and-attack-reports/project-ddosia-russias-answer-to-disbalancer/)\npath on either of these domains (over HTTP on TCP/80).\n\nExamining network telemetry for 31.13.195.87, we observe a high volume of outbound\nconnections to TCP/5001 of 87.121.52.9 (NETERRA, BG).\n\n_The use of TCP/5001 is notable as this port was used for communications with the previous_\n_C2 server (77.91.122.69), which was active until 16 December 2022._\n\nWhen '87.121.52.9:5001/client/get_targets' was accessed, we noted that the same targeting\ninformation was returned, as observed on the C2 domains. It is therefore plausible that the\npublished C2 servers are mirrors of 87.121.52.9.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Targeting Information**\n\nPivoting to examine network telemetry for 87.121.52.9, we observe a number of interesting\ncommunications.\n\n**Telegram**\n\nRegular connections are made to api.telegram[.]org, potentially indicative of Telegram bot\ninteractions. It is possible that these connections relate to updates made to the Telegram\nchannels associated with NoName057(16)’s DDoS campaigns.\n\n**CLOUDASSETS, RU**\n\nA high volume of traffic is observed to two IP addresses assigned to CLOUDASSETS, RU\n(AS212441).\n\n**109.107.184.11**\n\nConnections are made to TCP/27017 of 109.107.184.11, this port is commonly associated\nwith [MongoDB. It is likely that data transferred from the attack infrastructure is stored in a](https://www.mongodb.com/)\ndatabase hosted on this IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\n**185.173.37.220**\n\nConnections are made to TCP/5672 and TCP/6379 of 185.173.37.220, these ports are\n[commonly associated with RabbitMQ and](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) [Redis respectively. This host is therefore likely](https://redis.io/)\nused to store events / commands from the operator(s) of this infrastructure.\n\nIt is plausible that further operator hosts sit beyond this IP address, to either update or read\nmessages from the RabbitMQ bus, however due to the geolocation of 185.173.37.220 further\nupstream insights are not available.\n\nIn addition to the outbound connections, inbound traffic to local ports TCP/5051 and\nTCP/9100 was observed, sourced from 91.142.79.201 (also CLOUDASSETS, RU). Pivoting\non 91.142.79.201, additional traffic was also observed sourced from this IP to TCP/9100 of\n**31.13.195.87 (the original C2 server).**\n\n[TCP/9100 is commonly associated with Prometheus Node Exporter, a platform used for](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/)\ncollecting metrics / alerts from remote servers. Indeed, open ports information for\n**31.13.195.87:9100 shows an instance of Node Exporter running as of the time of writing.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Open Ports Data for 31.13.195.87 - Censys**\n\n**91.142.79.201 is therefore likely used for monitoring the operator’s infrastructure and**\ncollecting metrics on usage; possibly providing updates on campaign effectiveness and the\nnumber of active ‘bots’.\n\nIn a few instances, we also observed 91.142.79.201 making connections to TCP/9100 of IP\naddresses used in the attack infrastructure of NoName057(16)’s operation.\n\nWhen reviewing the infrastructure in its totality, it is clear that the operator(s) behind\nNoName057(16) is familiar with systems design / maintenance; potentially pointing towards a\nthreat actor(s) with legitimate work experience in this area.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: An Overview of NoName057(16) Infrastructure**\n\n### Targeting\n\nPrevious reporting on NoName057(16) has highlighted DDoS attacks against an array of\ntargets across business sectors and nations, including government / military departments.\n\nAt the time of writing this report, we took a look at the ‘current’ targets of the operation; one\nwhich stood out was the Estonian Ministry of Finance, with a particular subdomain being\ntargeted.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Targeting Details for the Estonian Ministry of Finance**\n\nFrom this entry on the C2 target list, we can see that a domain hosted on xx.xx.xx.246 is the\ntarget of the attack, which was set to commence at 10:00 on 25 January 2023.\n\nWe initially assumed this meant 10:00 UTC, however, when looking into our threat telemetry\nfor xx.xx.xx.246 the attack appears to have commenced at 07:00 UTC; so the start time in\nthe C2 target list in fact refers to UTC+3 which happens to coincide with Moscow Standard\n\n\n-----\n\nTime.\n\nAs of 17:00 UTC on 25 January 2023 the target subdomain was displaying a ‘down for\nmaintenance’ message, likely indicating that the attack had achieved a degree of success.\n\n**Figure 5: Maintenance Message**\n\nReturning to the aforementioned threat telemetry data for this target, the DDoS attack is\nevident in the data; which we have mapped below looking at the last seven days of traffic\nto/from xx.xx.xx.246 (19 - 25 January 2023).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: DDoS Attack Data - Target One**\n\nAs of 17:00 UTC on 25 January, we can see that the attack began at 07:00 UTC (as\nmentioned previously), with a peak in activity between 08:00 UTC - 09:00 UTC, and a large\nvolume of traffic has been received since that time; significantly outside the usual expected\nnorms for this IP address.\n\nLooking at a previous Estonian target from the same seven-day time period, we see that the\nattack lasted for 24 hours, commencing and ending at 07:00 UTC. As previously, activity\npeaked in the first few hours of the attack; this period is likely when the DDoS is most\neffective, before mitigating actions can be undertaken.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: DDoS Attack Data - Target Two**\n\nOverall, since the beginning of 2023, we have been able to confirm attacks against entities\nwith infrastructure hosted in Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\n### Attack Infrastructure\n\nWhen examining the data for the DDoS attacks against the two Estonian targets, we found\nthat 99.8% of the traffic inbound to the second (earlier) target was sourced from IP\naddresses which had later been used in the attack on the first target.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhilst IPs assigned to 21 distinct ASNs were observed in this common dataset, 98.6% of\nthe traffic originated from IPs assigned to STARK-INDUSTRIES, GB. Looking further into the\ndata, IPs residing in two /24 netblocks were responsible for over 65% of this traffic:\n\n5.182.39.0/24 (38 IPs)\n\n94.131.106.0/24 (21 IPs)\n\nSTARK-INDUSTRIES, GB relates to a hosting company ‘Stark Industries Solutions Ltd’\nwhich was incorporated in the United Kingdom through Companies House on 10 February\n2022, by Moldovan national Ivan NECULITI. NECULITI is further associated with several\nother hosting companies; including MIRhosting and Perfect Quality (PQ) Hosting, which are\npurported to operate from the Netherlands and Moldova respectively.\n\nWe frequently observe all three hosting companies being used to host malicious content, or\nas in this case, used directly for attack infrastructure. The website hucksters[.]net, which\namongst other things seeks to expose individuals involved in fraud and spam, has previously\n[profiled NECULITI.](https://hucksters.net/person/neculiti-ivan)\n\n**_Note, we have seen no evidence which associates NECULITI directly with these_**\n**_malicious activities; nor do we intend to insinuate that he is connected in any way_**\n**_with nefarious pursuits in general. This data point is mentioned as it exists on the_**\n**_public record and is the common tie between the hosting companies highlighted._**\n\nPivoting back to the C2 server (31.13.195.87), by examining all inbound connections to\nTCP/80 since 19 December 2022, when it became operational, we are able to extract a more\ncomplete picture of the attack infrastructure.\n\n_This process is caveated by the fact that other ‘non attack infrastructure’ connections are_\n_likely to have been made to 31.13.195.87:80, particularly since the publication of this IP as a_\n_C2 server for NoName057(16) activities. However, the idea here is to identify likely attack_\n_infrastructure based on the regularity and volume of traffic, and any emerging patterns, for_\n_example sequential IPs within the same netblock as seen in the two attacks above._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn total we observed IPs assigned to 83 distinct ASNs communicating with 31.13.195.87:80.\nHowever, once again infrastructure associated with the previously referenced hosting\nprovider(s) dominated, with 84% of all communications originating from IPs assigned to\neither MIRhosting or Stark Industries.\n\n**Figure 8: Top-10 Observed ASNs**\n\nLooking a little further into this data, IPs residing in a limited number of netbooks generated\nthe majority of the traffic; the top 10 netblocks accounting for 68% of the total.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Top-10 Observed Netblocks**\n\n5.182.39.0/24, as observed in the data for the Estonian attacks, is the clear number one, the\nother netblock from that data (94.131.106.0/24) was just outside the top-ten at number\nthirteen.\n\nWhat was notable was the fact that many of the IPs had been in communication with\n**31.13.195.87 since 19 December 2022, continuing up to the time of writing; indicating a**\nbroadly static attack infrastructure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this post we have examined the infrastructure used to manage the DDoS attacks\nattributed to NoName057(16); demonstrating a well-thought out structure which includes\ncapacity for monitoring, tasking, and remote storage of data.\n\nAs a pro-Russian hacktivist operation, it is no surprise that there are several pointers to a\nRussian nexus; the use of Russian hosting providers for the management infrastructure, and\nthe use of Moscow Standard Time for targeting instructions.\n\nFrom our observations, whilst heavily focused on a small number of specific targets,\nNoName057(16) has had some successes in temporarily disrupting web services, with\nevidence of their targets being offline or ‘under maintenance’. The broader impacts of these\nattacks will likely remain limited providing there is no major escalation of activities / or growth\nin available attack infrastructure.\n\nThat brings us to the most significant finding in this blog; the static and limited nature of the\nattack infrastructure which has been utilized by NoName057(16) to date. For an operation\nwhich is labeled as “volunteer” driven; the fact that so much of the infrastructure is sourced\nfrom one provider raises questions.\n\nIs a sizeable chunk donated by one generous “volunteer”?\n\nHow many “volunteers” actively contribute to the operation?\n\nAre NoName057(16) propping up their operation with infrastructure they have procured\nthemselves?\n\nWe have observed a diverse range of IPs being utilized in attacks, but the volume of traffic\nrelated to the majority of these IPs is minimal; if you were to deduct the traffic sourced from\nIPs assigned to Stark Industries there is a question as to what impact the attacks would\nhave.\n\nWith all this being said, we will continue to monitor NoName057(16)’s activities, providing\n[updates via our Twitter and](https://twitter.com/teamcymru_S2) [Mastodon pages.](https://infosec.exchange/@teamcymru_S2)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Recommendations\n\nAlthough not always the best advice with DDoS attacks; we would recommend that\ninbound connections from the below netblocks are blocked.\n\nFor users of Pure Signal Recon, you can follow this activity by querying for the IPs\ndetailed in Figure 3;\n\n**31.13.195.87**\n\n**87.121.52.9**\n\n**109.107.184.11**\n\n**185.173.37.220**\n\n**91.142.79.201**\n\nIf you are an ISP or Network Operator with DDoS challenges, sign up for our no-cost\n[DDoS mitigation service UTRS](https://www.team-cymru.com/ddos-mitigration-services)\n\n### IOCs\n\nKey Attack Infrastructure (as of 26 January 2023)\n\n5.182.39.0/24\n\n94.131.109.0/24\n\n94.131.102.0/24\n\n5.182.37.0/24\n\n185.248.144.0/24\n\n45.159.251.0/24\n\n45.67.34.0/24\n\n\n-----\n\n94.131.110.0/24\n\n5.182.38.0/24\n\n45.142.214.0/24\n\n94.131.99.0/24\n\n5.182.36.0/24\n\n94.131.106.0/24\n\n80.92.204.0/24\n\n45.8.147.0/24\n\n\n-----",
