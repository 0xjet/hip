During the months that followed in\nwhich we tracked Confucius’ activities, we found that they were Security Predictions for 2018\n\nstill aiming for Pakistani targets.\n\nDuring their previous campaign, we found Confucius using fake\n\nromance websites to entice victims into installing malicious\n\nAndroid applications. This time, the threat actor seems to have\n\na new modus operandi, setting up two new websites and new payloads with which to compromise\nits targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom the homepage, with a disclaimer stating that Google Play does not allow pornography in their users and enterprises to catch up with\n\ntheir security.\n\nstore.\n\n[Read our security predictions for 2018.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2018)\n\n#### Business Process Compromise\n\nAttackers are starting to invest in long-\nterm operations that target specific\nprocesses enterprises rely on.

Screenshot of the second fake website_\n\n[Same as with the fake Tweety chat application we described in detail in our previous research, a](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/research-deciphering-confucius-cyberespionage-operations.pdf) Subscribe\n\nWindows application with real chat features based on the open-source chat application\nRocketChat was offered. Similarly, this application also comes bundled with malicious .NET code.\n\nWhile small and relatively simple, we found this malicious application interesting to analyze as it\nrevealed the countries targeted by the threat actor. The application is a simple downloader that\n\nsends some basic information (username, antivirus, IP address, and operating system version)\nencrypted using triple Data Encryption Standard (DES).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Sample of the app’s code_\n\nPeriodically, the malware tries to contact the Command-and-Control (C&C) server with the\nusername encoded into parameters. Based on the information they retrieve, the operators can\nthen decide to instruct the malware to download the second stage payload. This function is similar\nto the various versions of backdoors (such as sctrls and sip_telephone) that we analyzed in our\n\n[previous blog post and whitepaper.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/deciphering-confucius-cyberespionage-operations/)\n\nAn interesting feature of the downloader: It uses an online service to retrieve the victim’s IP\naddress and country, which it compares with a list of allowed countries. If the victim seemingly\ncomes from a different country, the program will self-delete and quit. This list contains:\n\nMost of the South and Southeast Asian countries (including Mongolia)\n\nMost of the Middle Eastern countries\n\nMost of the African countries\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Excerpt of the valid country list_\n\nWe noted that it does both client-side and server-side IP filtering, showing that the attacker has\nimproved its infrastructure. At the end of last year, a C&C from the same threat actor was not only\naccessible from any IP address, but it was possible to browse the server directory tree without\nauthentication.\n\nAfter impersonating a fake victim of interest, we obtained a second stage payload (Detected as\nTROJ_DELF.XXWZ), which is a filestealer based on the Delphi programming language similar to\nthe “svctrls” malware described in our previous blogpost. This one is called “sysctrls” and it looks\nfor files with the following extensions:\n\n\n-----\n\n|.xls,.xlsx|Microsoft Excel document|\n|---|---|\n|.ppt, .pptx|Microsoft Powerpoint presentation|\n|.pptx|Microsoft Powerpoint presentation|\n|.png, .jpg, .jpeg|Image file|\n|.pst, .ost|Microsoft Outlook file|\n|.csv|Spreadsheet file|\n\n\n.xls,.xlsx Microsoft Excel document\n\n.ppt, .pptx Microsoft Powerpoint presentation\n\n.pptx Microsoft Powerpoint presentation\n\n.png, .jpg, .jpeg Image file\n\n.pst, .ost Microsoft Outlook file\n\n.csv Spreadsheet file\n\nIt then sends them via a POST HTTP request to windefendr[.]com/description.php.\n\nFurther analysis of this filestealer revealed interesting links with other threat actor groups.\n\n**_The Delphi Link_**\n\nWe already mentioned that Confucius had possible links to other groups in our previous blog post,\nwhich mentioned code sharing between Patchwork and Confucius. Both groups used a backdoor\nwith the same configuration file structure and commands.\n\nWe found more code shared among the two threat actor’s malware, as Patchwork recently used\nmultiple Delphi malware similar to some of the Delphi malware we described before.\n\nWe initially spotted some visual similarities between the malware used. Although no forms are\ndisplayed while the malware is running, we can see its TForm object in the Delphi decompiler. The\nTForm object often has two TTimer objects — but sometimes we have seen one or even three of\nthese objects — usually with random names. Occasionally, listboxes with encrypted strings are\nalso added.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Decompiled Form structure of Confucius’ sample_\n_(d971842441c83c1bba05742d124620f5741bb5d5da9ffb31f06efa4bbdcf04ee, Detected as_\n\n_TSPY_CONFSTEAL.A)_\n\n_Figure 7: Decompiled Form structure of Patchwork’s sample_\n_(795ae4097aa3bd5932be4110f6bd992f46d605d4c9e3afced314454d35395a59, Detected as_\n\n\n-----\n\ndecryption function.\n\n_Figure 8: Calling the decryption function_\n\nThis encouraged us to analyze the string encryption routines thoroughly.\n\nOur analysis revealed three of them. The first involves a very simple routine that flips every bit of\nthe string. The second algorithm involves a hardcoded key, which is transformed by taking the five\n\nlower bits of each character, and then used as a XOR key. In some cases, the key is split in half in\nthe binary, so it is first reunited before being used. Finally, our third algorithm uses a 94-character\n\n[substitution table. This algorithm was previously discussed by security researchers in a Confucius-](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/11/unit42-recent-inpage-exploits-lead-multiple-malware-families/)\nrelated blog post.\n\nFor each of these routines, we found a recent sample going back to a domain name belonging to\nPatchwork’s infrastructure.\n\nThe substitution tables of the third algorithm were randomly generated at build time, while the\nattacker seemingly set the keys used in the second algorithm. We found six different keys in the\n\nlatter category that were different for the Patchwork and Confucius group.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. On the left, Confucius code, on the right, Patchwork’s code_\n\nInterestingly, one of those keys, “xldbszcd”, was found in a file stealer used by Confucius\n\n(472ea4929c5e0fb4e29597311ed90a14c57bc67fbf26f81a3aac042aa3dccb55, Detected as\nTSPY_CONFSTEAL.A) as well as in two other file stealers.\n\nOne file stealer (cca74bb322ad7833a21209b1418c9837e30983daec30d199a839f46075ee72f2,\n[Detected as TSPY_DELF.SUW) published by security researchers in 2013 and linked to the](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/business/optimize-operations/updates-and-mitigation-to-cve-2013-3906-zero-day-threat/)\n\n[domain myflatnet[.]com, was attributed by](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/11/the-dual-use-exploit-cve-2013-3906-used-in-both-targeted-attacks-and-crimeware-campaigns.html) [several parties to the Hangover group.](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/microsoft-office-zeroday-used-to-attack-pakistani-targets)\n\nThe other file stealer\n\n(1f0dabd61947b6df8a392b77a0eae33777be3caad13698aecc223b54ab4b859a, Detected as\n[TROJ_DELF.XXWZ) is related to a domain reported in September 2016.

The backdoors also linked to an infrastructure matching old Hangover domains as well as\n\nthe infrastructure of domains from the September 2016 blog post.

Lately, they have been sending multiple\n\n[RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8570.

To help\ncombat these kinds of threats organizations will need to take a more proactive and focused\n\nsecurity posture that can cover the most ground in terms of security. Some specific security\n\n\n-----\n\nwith the common adage “sex sells”\n\nProactively monitor the organization’s network. Threat actors are notorious for creating\n\nstealthy malware that can bypass superficial network monitoring. A more proactive stance that\nincludes proper application of firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems can\n\nhelp mitigate the impact of an attack\n\n[Implement network segmentation. Even with the best security technology, there is still a](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/protecting-data-through-network-segmentation)\n\nchance of an attack slipping through. Separating the network into individual parts, as well as\nrestricting access to only those who really need it, can mitigate the damage that occurs in\n\ncase of a successful attack.\n\nUpdate systems regularly. Everything from endpoints to network software to IoT devices\n\n[should be patched and updated to prevent or minimize the chance of a threat actor exploiting](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/patching-problems-and-how-to-solve-them)\na vulnerability\n\nIn an ideal scenario, an organization’s in-house security team implement all of these and other\nsecurity measures. The reality is that IT departments of small to large-sized organizations are not\n\nequipped to handle the more advanced threats that groups like Confucius use in their attacks.\n\nSince these teams also handle the day-to-day IT requirements of the organization, taking on a\nmore involved and proactive stance may not be easy. In this case, an organization can look into\n\n[third party security providers who can handle specialized work, such as root cause analysis and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/managed-detection-and-response)\ndetailed research, and also provide a remediation plan that gives organizations a better chance\n\nagainst advanced threats.\n\n**_Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\nPatchwork uses email as an entry point, which is why securing the email gateway is\n\n[important.
