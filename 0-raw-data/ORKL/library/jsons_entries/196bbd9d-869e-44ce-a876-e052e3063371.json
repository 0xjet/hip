When gifting, the purchaser will be given an URL in the format\nhttps://discord.gift/[code], which can then be given to another Discord user.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Gifting a Nitro subscription**\n\n## Not your typical ransom demand\n\nWhile most ransomware operations demand thousands, if not millions, of dollars in\ncryptocurrency, Nitro Ransomware deviates from the norm by demanding a $9.99 Nitro Gift\ncode instead.\n\n[Based on filenames for NitroRansomware samples shared by MalwareHunterteam and](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nanalyzed by BleepingComputer, this new ransomware appears to be distributed as a fake\ntool stating it can generate free Nitro gift codes.\n\nWhen executed, the ransomware will encrypt a person's files and append the .givemenitro\nextension to encrypted files, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Files encrypted by the NitroRansomware**\nWhen finished, NitroRansomware will change the user's wallpaper to an evil or angry\nDiscord logo, as shown below.\n\n**Wallpaper changed to angry Discord logo**\n\n\n-----\n\nA ransomware screen will then be displayed demanding a free Nitro gift code within three\nhours, or ransomware will delete the victim's encrypted files. This timer appears to be an\nidle threat as the ransomware samples seen by BleepingComputer do not delete any files\nwhen the timer reaches zero.\n\n**NitroRansomware screen**\nWhen a user enters a Nitro gift code URL, the ransomware will verify it using a Discord API\nURL, as shown below. If a valid gift code link is entered, the ransomware will decrypt the\nfiles using an embedded static decryption key.\n\n**Checking if a Discord Nitro gift code is valid**\nAs the decryption keys are static and are contained within the ransomware executable, it is\npossible to decrypt the files without actually paying the Nitro gift code ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore, if you fall victim to this ransomware, you can share a link for the executable to\nextract a decryption key.\n\nUnfortunately, in addition to encrypting your files, the Nitro Ransomware will also perform\nother malicious activity on a victim's computer.\n\n## Stealing tokens and executing commands\n\nIt would not be Discord-related malware if the threat actors didn't try to steal a victim's\nDiscord tokens.\n\nDiscord tokens are authentication keys tied to a particular user, that when stolen, allow a\nthreat actor to log in as the associated user.\n\nWhen NitroRansomware starts, it will search for a victim's Discord installation path and then\nextract user tokens from the *.ldb files located under \"Local Storage\\leveldb.\" These tokens\nare then sent back to the threat actor over a Discord webhook.\n\n**Stealing Discord user tokens**\nAs part of this process, the malware will also attempt to steal data from Google Chrome,\nBrave Browser, and Yandex Browser.\n\nNitroRansomware also includes functionality to execute commands and have the output\nsent through the webhook to the attacker's Discord channel. This is currently only used to\nget the computer's UUID using the 'wmic csproduct get uuid' command.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Acting as a backdoor to execute remote commands**\nThe good news is that this ransomware does not do a good job hiding its decryption key,\nand users can recover their files for free.\n\nHowever, the bad news is that the threat actor will likely have already stolen a user's\nDiscord token.\n\nDue to this, users infected with this ransomware should immediately change their Discord\npassword in case their account has been compromised.\n\n_Update 4/19/21: Added that the malware also steals information from browsers._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n[Ransom payment is roughly 15% of the total cost of ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom-payment-is-roughly-15-percent-of-the-total-cost-of-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[FIN7 hackers evolve toolset, work with multiple ransomware gangs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fin7-hackers-evolve-toolset-work-with-multiple-ransomware-gangs/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Discord](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/discord/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Nitro](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nitro/)\n[Ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransom/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Token](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/token/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
