Experts\ncontacted by Yle have confirmed that the attack was perpetrated by the Turla group.\n\nTietoturvayritys arvioi, että Turla on iskenyt yhteensä satoihin kohteisiin lähes\nviidessäkymmenessä maassa. Image: Jyrki Lyytikkä / Yle\nIn 2013 Finland’s Foreign Ministry had its systems hacked by what investigators described\nas ‘a state actor’. Now Yle's sources have confirmed who was behind the attack: the Turla\ngroup of Russian-speaking hackers who perpetrated attacks on targets in more than 50\ncountries worldwide during the same period.\n\nStefan Tanase of Kaspersky security says that the Turla group is the premier Russian hacker\norganization—and it targets ministries, embassies and militaries in Russia’s neighbours.\n\n\"We believe that the Turla group is a nation state-sponsored attacker,\" said Tanase. \"We\nhave seen traces in their malware and their servers, which we analyse, that point to the fact\nthat the authors are Russian speaking and they definitely seem to have lot of resources to\ntheir cyber-espionage operation.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nYle has confirmed from several European sources that the 2013 attacks on the Foreign\nMinistry were perpetrated by the Turla group. The Foreign Ministry says that it has\ninvestigated the attacks in the light of similar actions targeting other nation states around\nRussia.\n\n\"The typical signs in these attack tools can be observed once you get to the stage where you\nknow what you’re looking for and can check to see if there’s anything like that, and if there\nhave been any changes in their tools,\" said Ari Uusikartano of the Foreign Ministry.\n\nUusikartano says that the attack by Turla hit most countries in western Europe. Kaspersky,\nwhich published a report on the methods and targets of Turla (which did not at the time\nmention Finland) last autumn, has outlined the methods used by the attackers.\n\nFirst, cyber spies start by gathering information about the target via sources like social\nmedia, public websites and internal phone directories.\n\nSecond, they choose a few employees to whom they send emails which include a link to an\napparently interesting website, which appears to be connected somehow to the targets\neveryday life or area of specialization. The hackers have however embedded malware in the\nsite concerned.\n\nThird, when the employee visits the site, the malware ends up on his or her computer.\n\nThat allows in the attacker, as happened to the Finnish Foreign Ministry in 2013. The ministry\nsays it's learned it's lessons from this attack--but the hackers may already have moved on to\na new method.\n\n[Cybercrime on the rise 15.2.2014](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/cybercrime_on_the_rise/7091355)\n\n[Secret services: Cyber spies twice penetrated Foreign Ministry2.7.2014](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/secret_services_cyber_spies_twice_penetrated_foreign_ministry/7334589)\n\nSources: Yle\n\n\n-----",
