With activity dating back to as early as April 2018, the group has earned\nits notoriety by attacking telecommunications companies as well as critical systems in Middle Eastern oil and gas\norganizations. All the while it has kept a low profile, drawing little attention from security researchers.\n\nDuring the past year we were able to reveal a new cluster of the group’s activities in the Middle East. We learned that the\ngroup’s latest endeavours are focused on going after entities within one country: Tunisia. The victims we observed were all\nhigh-profile Tunisian organizations, such as telecommunications or aviation companies. Based on the targeted industries,\nwe assume that the attackers might have been interested in compromising such entities to track the movements and\ncommunications of individuals of interest to them.\n\nApart from showing seemingly new interest in formerly unknown targets, the group has also done a considerable amount of\nwork to rebuild its toolset. Although Lyceum still prefers taking advantage of DNS tunnelling, as was the case in previous\ncampaigns, it appears to have replaced its publicly documented .NET payload (often referred to as ‘DanBot’) with new\nC++ backdoors and a PowerShell script that serve the same purpose.\n\nIn this paper we will examine the group’s new tools and their similarity to formerly known implants. Based on our\nunderstanding of these details, we will provide more insight into the group’s connection to another known threat actor as\nwell as our assessment of the operational motivation behind the observed intrusion set.\n\n**TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 2019, Secureworks published a report [1] detailing the activity of a threat group it dubbed Lyceum, which is also referred\nto as Hexane. According to Secureworks, Lyceum targeted organizations in the energy and telecommunications sectors\nacross the Middle East, and some of its tools included various PowerShell scripts, along with a .NET remote access trojan\nthat can communicate with the C2 server over DNS or HTTP.\n\nA PowerShell script (MD5: 94eac052ea0a196a4600e4ef6bec9de2) submitted to VirusTotal in November 2020 helped\nus follow the more recent tracks of this threat group. The script is obfuscated and Base64-encoded, suggesting that it was\nperhaps trying to evade detection in a victim’s environment. But after deobfuscating it, the resulting code shows many\ncomments that were left by the attackers, detailing what the script does and even explaining the changes from previous\nversions. Some of the functions were also marked as obsolete, suggesting that this script is possibly a work in progress.\n\n_Figure 1: Comments in PowerShell script._\n\nThe script supports communication with the C2 server over DNS and HTTP, in this case mastertape[.]org. It can\nreceive the following commands back:\n\n**DNS command** **HTTP command** **Description**\n\nz      - Runs a command on the infected system\n\nx < Uploads a file\n\nf ^ Downloads a file\n\nFor DNS communication, a random four-character identifier is created for the infected system, and saved in a file under the\n‘%APPDATA%\\Microsoft’ directory. The script then sends an initial DNS request (shown in Figure 2) and the IP address\nthat it returns is parsed, where each of its bytes is converted to a character.\n\n_Figure 2: Initial DNS request._\n\nThe first two characters of the parsed IP address are used in a consecutive similar DNS query, and this time around the\nreturned IP address is parsed and split into two parts. The last character of the IP address is one of the three supported\ncommands: ‘z’, ‘x’ or ‘f’, whereas the first three are the Base32-encoded number of the total DNS queries that have to be\nsent in order to receive the full message from the C2.\n\n|DNS command|HTTP command|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|z|>|Runs a command on the infected system|\n|x|<|Uploads a file|\n|f|^|Downloads a file|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Extracting the command type from the returned IP address._\n\nCombining the results from those queries will eventually construct a command that the script executes on the system, a file\nthat it writes, or the name of a file it then fetches and uploads to the C2 server.\n\n_Figure 4: Example of consecutive DNS requests used to get message parts from C2._\n\nAs for the HTTP communication, an initial POST request is sent to mastertape[.]org/login.aspx, and the host name\nof the infected machine is used as the unique victim ID. The response will contain one of the three supported HTTP\ncommands: ‘>’ for executing a command using cmd.exe, ‘<’ for uploading a file after receiving its name from the C2, and\n‘^’ for downloading a file.\n\n_Figure 5: Checking the command type in the HTTP response._\n\n**Malw are implant**\n\nPivoting on the C2 server used in the PowerShell scripts led us to several distinct implants written in C++ and used by the\nattackers concurrently against targets in Tunisia. Those were leveraged as general backdoors allowing the attacker to run\narbitrary commands and download additional payloads to the victim machines, whereby messages exchanged between the\nC&C and the implant components used a custom protocol tunnelled through DNS or HTTP packets.\n\nThe bulk of samples that we observed could be split into two clusters, each demonstrating some variation in\nimplementation and design. As it turns out, the samples within each cluster not only shared code and behaviour, but seem to\nhave been derived from sources based in the same directories – e.g. one of the variants had most of its PDBs prefixed with\n‘c:\\users\\kernel’ or ‘c:\\users\\james’, while the other used the prefix ‘c:\\kevin\\projects’. Consequently, we refer to these\nvariants as ‘James’ and ‘Kevin’.\n\nDeeper inspection of each cluster allowed us to outline some of the features that distinguish it from the other. For example,\nthe ‘James’ variant was heavily based on the .NET malware referred to as ‘DanBot’ that was formerly described in use by\nthe group. At the same time, the ‘Kevin’ variant seemed to introduce various changes in architecture and communication\nprotocol. While we observed the actor using both variants circa June 2020, it seems as if ‘Kevin’ has become the major\nvariant that is predominantly used as of December 2020.\n\nAll the variants share a similar operation model: a communication channel is used to drop files with commands to execute\nor instructions to modify the malware’s configuration. The target path for the dropped command file may vary depending\non the sample or variant. In turn, a thread is executed to interpret and handle these files, whereby it reads the file, replaces\nvarious keywords that denote malware-related paths on the system, executes the specified commands within it and creates a\nlog file with its output or status code (e.g. ‘ok’, ‘not’, ‘error’).\n\nThe advantage in this model is that the execution logic is decoupled from the communication mechanism, allowing the\nattackers to easily change the network protocol while preserving the core of the malware. Consequently, we observed\nmultiple samples that vary in C&C protocol, yet share the very same functionality for executing what’s obtained from it.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the following sections we will outline the major implementation characteristics of the ‘Kevin’ and ‘James’ variants,\nshowing how they differ on the one hand, yet share a considerable amount of code with Lyceum’s previously observed\n.NET malware that allows tracing their origins back to this group.\n\n**_‘Kev in’ variant_**\n\nThe ‘Kevin’ variant seems to represent a new branch of development in the group’s arsenal. Its first samples date back to\nJune 2020 based on their compilation timestamps, and most carried a string signifying an internal version, ‘v1.0.2’. As of\nDecember 2020, a new wave of samples from this variant emerged, now carrying the version ‘v2.1.0.2’. We assess that the\ngroup shifts its focus on the usage of this variant, as it introduces changes in communication protocols and is mostly\ncompiled for 64-bit systems, except for one 32-bit sample we detected.\n\nThe purpose of this variant is to facilitate a communication channel that passes arbitrary commands to be executed by the\nimplant. To do this, the malware requests files that will be created in the file system and written with commands received\nfrom the server using a specified format. The contents of the file will be read and interpreted by the implant according to\nthat format, where predefined keywords will be replaced with certain malware-related paths or used to update internal\nrun-time configurations. In turn, the commands will be executed, issuing the response back to the server.\n\nBefore any communication takes place, the ‘Kevin’ variant may bootstrap and prepare the victim environment for its\nexecution through a set of actions common to a lot of its samples. These include (and are not limited to) the following – and\nsome samples may carry out only part of these actions:\n\n - Hides the current window from the user using the ‘ShowWindow’ API function.\n\n - Creates a mutex with a lower-case GUID value that is hard coded in the binary.\n\n - Checks the arguments with which it was executed. It is mandatory that the first argument is equal to a version number\n(e.g. ‘v1.0.2’ or ‘v2.1.0.2’). We assess that this could have been incorporated in order to avoid full execution of the\nmalware functionality in sandboxed environments.\n\n_Figure 6: Argument check conducted by the implant, requiring the first argument to be equal to ‘v1.0.2’._\n\nThe second argument is optional and appears only in some variants, such that if it’s equal to ‘persist’ the malware will\ngenerate a MOF file with a random name and .tmpl extension that is, in turn, passed as an argument to ‘mofcomp.exe’.\nThis will cause the malware to persistently run once every 10,800 seconds.\n\n_Figure 7: The contents of the MOF file written by the malware for persistent execution of it once every three hours._\n\n - Creates a working directory typically based in the %TEMP% folder, but could also be created under ‘<root_drive>:\\\nProgramData\\’, ‘<root_drive>:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\’ or ‘<root_drive>:\\Windows\\debug\\WIA\\’ if the former can’t be\nused for some reason. This directory contains up to four other subdirectories, three of which are prefixed with a\nrandom alphanumeric string and end with two characters (e.g. ‘9t’, ‘d3’,‘a2’). These directories have different\npurposes: some are used to host downloaded command files and their execution output results, while others store logs\nor other data to upload to the server. Another directory named ‘tmp’ is typically used to stage downloaded command\nfiles before copying them to another directory and executing them.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe working directory would also contain a configuration .ini file (e.g. ‘int.ini’) with a Base64-encoded string of\nvarious malware-related execution parameters delimited with the ‘;’ character. For example:\n\n.centosupdatecdn.com;000C291710A8;000C291710A8;42000;1700000;42000;1700000;;\n\nWhile the structure of this configuration may vary slightly across samples, the parameters are mostly the same – a\ndomain used for the communication channel (whichever that may be), a user ID derived from a MAC address of one of\nthe adapters, and time intervals for sleep between communication attempts.\n\n - In some variants, the malware also creates two files in the local directory:\n\n    - A copy of the ‘cmd.exe’ image, which is renamed to a random name with a ‘tmpl’ extension. This image will be\nused to execute command lines during the malware’s execution.\n\n    - A randomly named .ini file containing a Base64-encoded list of paths vital to the malware’s run. These default to\nthe aforementioned working directory and the path to the local ‘cmd.exe’ copy.\n\nThe information exchanged between the server and the implant (i.e. the file metadata, commands and their output) can be\npassed only via one of the two channels – DNS or HTTP, depending on the sample itself. In other words, some ‘Kevin’\nsamples support communication only over DNS while others leverage HTTP instead. In the following sections we will lay\nout the behaviour of each of these protocols as evident in two different samples of the ‘Kevin’ variant.\n\n**_‘Kevin’ DNS protocol_**\n\nThe protocol used to communicate over DNS constructs domains that are issued as part of either an A record or TXT type\nqueries and conveys information to the server by embedding it within the domain itself. These domains are structured as\nfollows:\n\nCustomBase32( tm_sec || action_code || victim_ID ).CustomBase32(random_alphanumeric_string ||\ndata_argument || len(random_alphanumeric string)).<c2_domain>\n\nAs can be seen above, the domain in this variant is prepended with two levels of subdomains, each one conveying a\ndifferent piece of information. The second level is responsible for passing an action code that signifies the purpose of the\nrequest and the first contains a data argument of that action. The victim ID is provided as a response from the server upon\nregistration of the victim at the early stages of communication and the Base32 encoding algorithm makes use of the custom\nindex ‘_l8vq1hwfs6yn9xuoiztapemjk7crgdb0’.\n\nIn turn, the IP addresses provided as responses for the DNS requests carry information that is interpreted by the implant.\nSuch IPs are converted to ASCII strings, which may contain a control code for the malware or four-byte data chunks that\nare sent as a sequence to pass file metadata or content. Examples of the prominent control codes retrieved from the server\nare ‘#ex’ (corresponds to the IP 35.101.120.32), ‘y’ (corresponds to the IP 121.32.32.32) and ‘rem’ (corresponds to the IP\n114.101.109.32).\n\nThe following is an outline of the typical phases throughout a communication session with the server, specifying the action\ncodes used in every step (marked as single letters from ‘a’ to ‘h’ and ‘k’ to ‘m’) as well as their corresponding data arguments:\n\n**• Phase 1: Registration**\n\n    - ‘a’ – the implant registers the victim with the C2 server by sending a bot ID as the data argument. The ID is\nconstructed as the string <MAC>-<hostname>, where the former is retrieved by executing the command ‘ipconfig\n/all’ and searching for the data that comes after the first appearance of the string ‘Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : ’ in\nthe output, and the latter is retrieved by taking the output of the command ‘hostname’.\n\n_Figure 8: Malware code used to resolve the victim’s hostname and use it during registration with the C&C._\n\n  - **Phase 2: Listening for commands**\n\n    - ‘c’ – at this point the implant repeatedly beacons the C2 server with messages that carry the string ‘pulse’ as their\ndata argument. It will keep doing so as long as it receives ‘y’ responses. As soon as a response with a numeric\nvalue (signifying the size of the file that will be sent later on) is received, the implant moves on to the next stage.\n\n\n-----\n\n**• Phase 3: Command file receipt and execution**\n\n    - ‘g’ – this action can be divided into two parts: in the first the implant receives a file name, and in the second it\nobtains the file’s contents. For the first part, the malware issues ‘g’ action requests to the server with the data\nargument set to a counter that decreases starting from -1 with each request. The server responds to these requests\nwith IP addresses that carry the name of the file, until it responds with ‘#ex’. If the file does not exist at this point,\nthe malware creates it in a directory designated for it.\n\nNext, the malware starts issuing ‘g’ action requests with an increasing counter where each response carries four\nbytes of the file contents, which are in turn written to the generated file. The requests are sent until the counter\nreaches the value of the formerly received file size divided by 4.\n\n    - ‘h’ – this message is sent as a form of acknowledgement that all file chunks have successfully been retrieved by\nthe implant. Following this the file is parsed such that various keywords within commands are replaced with\nmalware-specific paths on the infected machine, allowing the malware to execute the commands and write their\noutput to a separate file.\n\n**• Phase 4: Output exfiltration**\n\n    - ‘d’ – if an output file was generated in the previous phase, its name and size will be sent as a single string of the\nform ‘filename;filesize’ in the data argument field of the request.\n\n    - ‘b’ – sent upon a non-null response to a ‘d’ action request, signifying the initiation of a session in which the\ncontents of the output file will be sent over DNS requests.\n\n    - ‘e’ – these requests are sent in sequence as part of the output upload session where each one holds a custom\nBase32-encoded chunk of the output file as the data argument. Each chunk read from the file is of 27 characters\nlength or less (for the last chunk).\n\n    - ‘f’ – signifies the last DNS request sent as part of the ‘e’ output upload session.\n\n**• Phase 5: Domain update**\n\n    - ‘m’ – beacon message that indicates the initial C&C server has been used for a long time with no response. This\nphase is entered if the malware has issued more than 10 ‘a’ (identification) or ‘c’ (pulse) requests that have not\nbeen responded to and if either two hours have passed since the beginning of execution or the current date is one\nday or more past the initial execution date.\n\n_Figure 9: Conditions checked before shifting the malware to the domain update phase._\n\n    - ‘k’ – at this point a hard-coded fallback domain is assigned for further DNS requests and the implant reaches out\nto it to request a possible new domain for communication. An ‘#ex’ response would signify that the server contains\na domain update and will subsequently issue it to the implant.\n\n    - ‘l’ – sent as a sequence of requests with an increasing counter as the data argument, where each response is\nappended to a string that will result in a new domain to use for further communication. A ‘y’ response signifies the\nend of the update session.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the DNS queries are performed by executing the ‘nslookup’ command with the following pattern:\n\n_Figure 10: Command line used to issue a DNS query to the server._\n\nThis choice could be made to avoid detection based on usage of DNS API calls in Windows that are monitored by some\nsecurity products. That said, the multiple executions of nslookup are noisy nonetheless and leave a significant footprint for\ndetection.\n\n**_‘Kevin’ HTTP protocol_**\n\nSome ‘Kevin’ samples are shipped with a communication channel that exchanges information with the C&C as part of\nseemingly benign HTTP traffic. Much like its DNS counterpart, this variant is intended to obtain a command file from\nresponses to HTTP GET requests issued to the server. The command file is written to disk, processed and executed, later\nhaving its output read from the file system by another thread and reported to the C&C through separate HTTP POST requests.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GET requests sent to the server carry three parameters in their URLs, as outlined in the following structure:\n\nhttp://<c2_domain>/?kind=action_code&serv=Base64(victim_id)&name=Base64(data_param)\n\nThe names used for these parameters are chosen from three schemes specified in the table below, one of which is chosen at\nrandom at the beginning of execution. This is likely done to diversify the strings used in the resulting URLs, thus allowing\nthem to not stand out and blend in better with the bulk of other traffic in the system.\n\n**Action code** **Victim ID** **Action data**\n\n‘kind’ ‘serv’ ‘name’\n\n‘pt’ ‘pi’ ‘pp’\n\n‘proto ‘ ‘index’ ‘title’\n\nAs an additional measure to lower the signal-to-noise ratio of the malware’s traffic, each request carrying actual data is\nsucceeded by a sequence of dummy requests to hard-coded URL paths chosen from a vector object generated at the beginning\nof execution. The responses to these requests contain benign content that is not used in any way by the malware itself.\nExamples of such paths are: css/icon.css?family=Material+Icons, css/materialize.css, css/style.css,\njs/jquery-2.1.1.min.js, js/jquery-2.1.1.min.js, js/init.js, img/background1.jpg,\nimg/background2.jpg and img/background3.jpg, img/logo.jpg.\n\nThe response from the server for each GET request carrying data to the C&C is a legitimate page that embodies a section\ntowards its end with special HTML tags interpreted as response parameters. The values within these tags (names appear in\nthe list below) are used to convey the following information:\n\n**• sname – Base64-encoded list of file names delimited with the ‘;’ character. Depending on the structure of the file name**\nand contents of other arguments a different action can be conducted with regards to it.\n\n**• sparam – not used.**\n\n**• svalue – Base64-encoded list of data strings delimited with the ‘;’ character that get written to the ‘tmp’ folder under**\nthe malware’s working directory with a corresponding name specified in the ‘sname’ tag.\n\n**• st – optional value that can contain the keyword ‘up’, used to trigger a particular behaviour by the malware which will**\nbe described later on.\n\nThe format of such a section would then be:\n\n<sname id=\"lblName\">Base64(filename_list)</sname><sparam id=\"lblParam\"></sparam><svalue\nid=\"lblValue\">Base64(file_data_list)</svalue><st id=\"lblt\"></st>\n\nAs already mentioned, this data is part of an actual page source that was constructed by the attackers to mimic a benign\nwebsite. This site pretends to correspond to an entity named ‘Digital Marketing Agency’, which provides consulting and\ndevelopment services in the area of online marketing to customers in various industries around the world. This seems to be\nfurther evidence that the attackers are investing a significant amount of effort into concealing the malware-related data inside\nwhat appears to be otherwise legitimate content, thus potentially evading detection by both analysts and security products.\n\n_Figure 11: Contents of the web page retrieved as part of the HTTP protocol in the ‘Kevin’ variant._\n\n|Action code|Victim ID|Action data|\n|---|---|---|\n|‘kind’|‘serv’|‘name’|\n|‘pt’|‘pi’|‘pp’|\n|‘proto ‘|‘index’|‘title’|\n\n\n-----\n\nA typical HTTP communication session of the ‘Kevin’ variant resembles that described for its DNS counterpart, whereby\nboth follow similar steps to obtain commands or update information from the C&C. The malware initiates two threads –\none for issuing HTTP GET requests to the server used to obtain commands and execute them, and another for picking up\nexecution outputs from files under one of the folders in the malware’s working directory and issuing its contents back to the\nserver using a sequence of HTTP POST requests. The following is a typical flow of communication between the implant\nand the C&C server with a specification of action codes and their meaning:\n\n**• ‘2’ – Registration and request for commands: this message is sent periodically by the malware to beacon the C&C**\nserver and convey data that identifies the victim machine to it. This data is passed in the third parameter of the URL\nGET request. However, instead of using the naming scheme outlined above (e.g. using the parameter string ‘name’,\n‘pp’ or ‘title’), this parameter is named ‘info’ and contains a string with the structure: Base64(malware_\npath#pid##does_working_directory_exist#2.1). In, turn the server responds with the aforementioned\nparameters and the malware decides how to proceed based on the following check:\n\n    - If ‘svalue’ is ‘0’, the malware does nothing and sleeps for a preconfigured interval (internally referred to as ‘htik’),\nwhich equals to 1,700,000 ms (~28 minutes) by default.\n\n    - Otherwise, the data of ‘svalue’ is decoded using Base64 and written to a file under the ‘tmp’ folder in the\nmalware’s working directory with a name specified in ‘sname’.\n\n**• ‘4’ – File creation acknowledgement: for each file successfully created under the ‘tmp’ directory as a result of the**\nformer ‘2’ action request, the malware will notify the server by assigning the action data parameter with the\nBase64-encoded name of the created file.\n\n**• ‘7’ – Command execution response: if the formerly created file name is prefixed with ‘9R-’ its contents will be**\ndecoded with Base64 twice, i.e. the value obtained by the malware is a result of\nBase64Decode(Base64Decode(svalue_data). The corresponding file will be deleted from the ‘tmp’ directory and\nthe decoded file data will be executed as a command line passed to ‘cmd.exe’. The malware will notify the server on\nthe successful execution of the command along with its output by issuing the value Base64(9R_prefixed_\nfilename#command_output) as the action data parameter of the request.\n\n**• ‘3’ – Command file execution output report: if the formerly created file name is prefixed with ‘7T-’ and has a .bin**\nextension it will instead be copied from the ‘tmp’ folder to another folder under the malware’s work directory (in the\nanalysed sample it is the directory with the ‘9t’ suffix). Subsequently, it will be used as a command file, whereby its\nexecution result will be issued as the body of HTTP POST requests using this command code (without a third data\nargument in the URL itself, as used in the GET requests).\n\nThe POST requests will be split into multiple chunks, separated by the string ‘------myfile--’ at the beginning of each\nheader. An identical scheme was used to construct the headers of POST requests with the same purpose in the ‘James’\nvariant.\n\n_Figure 12: Comparison of headers used to issue a file in the ‘Kevin’ and ‘James’ variants, both using the same separator_\n_string and overall structure._\n\nThe command file mentioned above contains command lines for execution by ‘cmd.exe’ or updated values to specific\nmalware configuration parameters. The following flow is used when parsing this file:\n\n    - If the ‘htik=’ string is found in the file its value will update the sleep interval between ‘2’ action code requests.\nSimilar to this, a string called ‘dtik=’ is sought and updates a field in the configuration file (‘int.ini’), however it\ndoesn’t seem to be used by the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n    - The malware looks for the sequence ‘!@#’ to handle any other configuration update or command. If the sequence\nis not found the file will not be executed.\n\n    - The string ‘!@#sethome=’ is sought and its value is used to update the contents of the .ini configuration file that\nresides in the same directory as the malware binary, originally containing the path to the malware’s work directory\nand path of a local copy of ‘cmd.exe’ that is used for command execution.\n\n    - The strings ‘*B@’, ‘*D@’, ‘*U@’, ‘*DD@’ and‘*EX@’ are sought and replaced with paths in the malware’s\nwork directory. The same replacement logic was seen in other variants of the malware, including the .NET version\nformerly used by the group and described in other reports [2] in the past.\n\nThe resulting string will be interpreted as a ‘cmd.exe’ command line and executed, having the result written back\nto the same file.\n\n_Figure 13: Comparison between the ‘Kevin’ variant and the .NET malware formerly used by the group, both using similar_\n_marker strings that are replaced with malware-related paths in the command file._\n\n**• ‘5’ – Domain update request #1: similar to a functionality seen in the ‘Kevin’ DNS variant, if more than 10 requests**\nof action ‘2’ are not responded to and more than two hours or one day have passed, the malware will attempt to request\nthe current C&C for a domain update. In this case, the third parameter in the issued URL will be set to the value\nBase64(x<random_alphanum_string>).\n\n  - **‘6’ – Domain update request #2: if three domain update requests are not responded to, the malware will issue an**\nupdate request to a fallback C&C hard-coded in the binary.\n\nThere are a few general notes worth mentioning with regard to this variant:\n\n - If a file named ‘helperh.ini’ exists in a particular directory (one with a ‘d3’ suffix for the given sample) the malware\nwill not conduct any communication and will keep entering sleep intervals until the file is removed.\n\n - Each HTTP request is preceded with an attempt to read proxy-related information (e.g. server name, port and\ncredentials) from a file named ‘updatep.ini’ in the ‘tmp’ directory. Since no other logic exists to create this file in the\nmalware, it is assumed that it has to be created by the attacker and placed in that directory.\n\n - The older .NET variant used a hard-coded User-Agent field that had typos uniquely identifying it. This issue was\ntackled in the current variant and this string is now built during run-time with accordance to the OS version on the\nvictim machine.\n\n_Figure 14: A run-time generated User-Agent string in the ‘Kevin’ HTTP variant._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_‘Kevin’ offline variant_**\n\nAnother ‘Kevin’ variant that we identified is one that does not contain any mechanism for network communication. In the\ncases we observed, it was executed with the ‘persist’ keyword as its second command-line argument. To use this variant, the\noperator needs to drop command files with the naming convention ‘7t-*.xml’ in a folder under the malware’s work\ndirectory. It is not clear how the execution output ought to be picked up though.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the underlying command file execution mechanism is the same as in other ‘Kevin’ variants, but\nthe sample simply lacks the communication functionality. Moreover, the network configuration features in the command\nfile are not removed, showing that the developers likely derived this variant from the other ones that we already described,\nand used it to accommodate a specific scenario in the attacked network.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t have sufficient evidence to explain the purpose of this variant. As such, and considering all the\nabove, we assess with medium confidence that it was intended to be dropped on systems without Internet connection.\n\n**_‘Jam es’ variant_**\n\nBesides the ‘Kevin’ variant and its derivatives, we observed another C++ based implant that we dubbed ‘James’, based on a\nPDB path that is used in its samples. As opposed to ‘Kevin’ implants, it supports both HTTP and DNS exfiltration in a\nsingle binary. It accepts only one argument in its command line and all of its samples are 32-bit ones. Furthermore, its DNS\nqueries are performed by using the DnsQuery_A() API instead of executing a subprocess of the ‘nslookup’ utility:\n\n_Figure 15: Usage of the ‘DnsQuery_A’ API instead of the nslookup.exe utility in the ‘James’ variant._\n\nThe structure of the domains conveying information passed from the implant is the following, whereby a custom Base32\nwith the dictionary ‘84leq1sdfh3ym0cuoiagzkvnjp2xrtwb’ is used to encode the subdomain (a similar algorithm to the one\nobserved in the ‘Kevin’ DNS variant):\n\nCustomBase32(<random>*<time><action><botid>).<c2_domain>\n\nThe communication protocol is almost identical to the one observed in the former .NET variant of the malware and\ndescribed in a blog post by CyberX [2]. The authors introduced a few changes, such as replacing the underscore separator\nin the subdomain with a ‘*’ character and sending the hostname of the infected system in an action ‘2’ request instead of\nthe victim’s IP.\n\nLike the ‘Kevin’ HTTP variant, the HTTP protocol used in this variant also reads data embodied within pages retrieved by\nthe implant. The malware contacts one of the following .aspx pages at random: contact.aspx, Default.aspx, preview.aspx or\nteam.aspx, reads the action to execute between the ‘<h7>’ and ‘<h6>’ tags and interprets it based on the following pattern:\n\n<h7>base64(filename.d);base64(command_to_be_executed)<h6>\n\nThe malware will create the ‘filename.d’ file within one of the folders in its work directory and write the decoded command\nto it. Following its execution, the output of the command will be stored in a gzip compressed form in the same file.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nThe domains used in this attack attempt to impersonate known services, and include keywords such as ‘windows’, ‘cloud’\nor ‘cdn’ to appear legitimate, such as dnscloudservice[.]com, windowsupdatecdn[.]com and updatecdn[.]net.\nThey also have their own nameservers, allowing the attackers to control the responses for DNS queries, and send back\ncustom records that the malware can then parse.\n\nSome of the older domains have WHOIS records showing that they were registered with ProtonMail email addresses and\npseudonyms such as ‘Paul Lava’ or ‘Matt Lava’. The name ‘Matt’ was also referenced in one of the PDB paths from the\n.NET samples back in 2019: ‘C:\\Users\\Matt\\Desktop\\source\\New\\DanBot\\AdobeReport\\obj\\Debug\\\nAdobeReport.pdb’.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: WHOIS records of malicious domains._\n\nWhile most of the associated domains follow the same naming pattern, a more recent one masquerades as the University of\nCape Town in South Africa: uctpostgraduate[.]com. This is not the first reference to South Africa in Lyceum’s\nactivity, as one of the early indicators covered by Secureworks used the South African ccTLD: cybersecnet.co[.]za.\nDuring our investigation, however, we found no evidence of Lyceum targeting South African entities.\n\nThere were additional overlaps between the previous Lyceum activity and the current one we discovered. For example, the\nIP address 185.243.115[.]16 is associated with some of the domains seen in the previous wave of attacks, such as\nweb-traffic[.]info, as well as newer ones from the C++ backdoors. Moreover, it is part of the same netblock as\n185.243.115[.]157, the IP address that mastertape[.]org resolves to.\n\n_Figure 17: Connections between C2 servers._\n\n**Pos t infection and lateral movement**\n\nFollowing a successful infection, the attackers can send and execute commands to gather more information about the\nsystem or the network. At first, commands such as ‘whoami’, ‘cmdkey’ and ‘net localgroup’ help identify the logged in\nuser, stored credentials and local groups. The running processes and programs installed on the infected machine are also\nenumerated.\n\nTo gain access to the user’s credentials, the attackers drop additional tools such as a Mimikatz-based executable that steals\npasswords from Google Chrome, or a similar PowerShell script that contains an encoded SQLite.dll to open Chrome’s\n‘Login Data’ database.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: Using Mimikatz to retrieve Google Chrome credentials._\n\nFor keylogging, we spotted two scripts: ‘kl.ps1’, a PowerShell-based keylogger, and ‘MicrosoftUpdator.vbs’, a VisualBasic\nscript that is in charge of running the PowerShell one. This may not be the first time those tools have been used, as a report\ncovering previous Lyceum activity mentioned a custom keylogger called ‘kl.ps1’ [3]. A task is then scheduled to ensure the\nkeylogger starts when the user logs in.\n\nschtasks /create /tn \\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeAgentLogOn2016 /tr \"C:\\Users\\Public\\PublicLib\\\nMicrosoftUpdator.vbs\" /sc ONLOGON /ru [Redacted] /f\n\nThe attackers can also test the connectivity of the infected machine by sending requests to google.com, or by using the\n_BITSAdmin tool to try and download a random image. Existing connections to specific ports in the machine can also be_\nmonitored with the ‘netstat’ command. To discover other parts of the network they can possibly infect, the attackers ping\ninternal addresses, use ‘tracert’ to determine packet routes, and list other machines in the domain with ‘net view’.\n\ncmd /c bitsadmin /transfer MyJob https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/\ngooglelogo_color_272x92dp.png C:\\Users\\Public\\11.png\n\n**Similarity to other threat groups**\n\nIt is worth noting that Lyceum’s modus operandi bears a striking resemblance to that of APT34/OilRig. Both groups have\nsimilar geopolitical targeting, and prefer to use DNS tunnelling in the different payloads they have developed over the\nyears. Although we did not find conclusive evidence to support this, we did notice some similarities between the delivery\ndocuments used by Lyceum back in 2018-2019 and those by DNSpionage, which is also believed to have ties to OilRig.\nThe embedded macros in the two documents have the same variable names and a similar code structure.\n\n_Figure 19: Similar macros in Lyceum and DNSpionage delivery documents._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, setting up fake websites and embedding encoded commands in the source code is a technique that was used by\nDNSpionage [4], as well as in the Kevin HTTP variant. Therefore, we assess with medium confidence that the two\nactivities might indeed be connected.\n\n**C ONCLUSIONS**\n\nOur research shows that the Lyceum threat group, which was first reported in 2019, is still active. With considerable\nrevelations on the activity of DNSpionage in 2018, as well as further data points[1] that shed light on an apparent relationship\nwith APT34, we can assess that the latter may have changed some of its modus operandi and organizational structure,\nmanifesting into new operational entities, tools and campaigns. One such entity is the Lyceum group, which after further\nexposure by Secureworks in 2019, had to retool yet another time, leading to the campaign described in this paper.\n\nFollowing our detection of the group’s activity, we note that it has not ceased operation and has attempted to gain a\nfoothold on the targeted networks time and time again. Furthermore, the group’s attempted activity during 2021 revealed\nsamples of the aforementioned implants with variation in the code, suggesting that the group has started to retool once\nagain. With the exposure of this publication, we assess that Lyceum will continue to be active, using renewed malware and\nTTPs and adjusting its capabilities to conduct espionage and counterintelligence operations in the Middle East.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] [Secureworks.
