    "plain_text": "# Visa Security Alert AUGUST 2016\n\n## ORACLE MICROS COMPROMISE NOTIFICAT ION\n\n**Distribution: Issuers, Acquirers, Processors and Merchants**\n\n**Summary: On Monday, 8 August 2016, Oracle Security informed Oracle MICROS customers that it had**\ndetected malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems. Oracle is currently investigating the\ncompromise, and as of 12 August 2016, the company has not published details about the cause/s.\n\nVisa is issuing this alert to provide indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with cybercrime threats\nknown to have previously targeted Oracle systems.\n\n**About Oracle MICROS**\n[Oracle MICROS](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/micros/index.html) offers a range of software, hardware and related services, including point-of-sale systems\n(POS) along cloud solutions to manage hotels, food and beverage facilities, and retailers. According to\nOracle Micros, MICROS' technologies are in use across 330,000 customer sites in 180 countries.\n\n**Oracle Customer Notification**\n[According to media sources, Oracle Security provided a notification to Oracle MICROS customers on 8](http://www.zdnet.com/article/oracle-said-to-be-investigating-data-breach-at-point-of-sale-division/)\nAugust 2016, informing them of the following:\n\n   - Oracle Security has detected and addressed malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems\n\n   - Oracle has confirmed that it's investigating a breach of its Micros division.\n\n   - Oracle's own systems, corporate network, and other cloud and service offers were not impacted.\n\n   - Oracle MICROS users will have to change their account passwords immediately\n\n   - The company reportedly stated that payment data was not at risk, as that information is\nencrypted both at rest and in transit in the MICROS environment.\n\nAlthough Oracle has not provided additional details on the exact date or extent of the breach of Oracle\n[MICROS, some media reports suggest that the support portal for MICROS clients was also compromised.](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/data-breach-at-oracles-micros-point-of-sale-division/)\n\n#### 1. Cybercrime threats to Oracle MICROS\n\nVisa is aware of two cybercrime threats, “Carbanak” and “MalumPOS”, which have previously targeted\nOracle systems. Indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with both Carbanak and MalumPOS are\nprovided in section two [2] of this report.\n\n### Carbanak\n[On 8 August 2016, a media source](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/data-breach-at-oracles-micros-point-of-sale-division/) reported that the “Oracle’s MICROS customer support portal was seen\ncommunicating with a server known to be used by the “Carbanak.”\n\n[According to Kaspersky Lab, in February 2015, the Carbanak group used techniques commonly seen in](https://blog.kaspersky.com/billion-dollar-apt-carbanak/7519/)\nAdvanced Persistent Threat (APT) incidents to successfully target one financial institution’s (a bank) money\nprocessing services, Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and financial accounts. In some cases, Oracle\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\ndatabases were manipulated to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer\nmoney between accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to dispense\ncash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready to collect it as part of this\noperation.\n\n[In March 2015, Visa](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/Alert-CARBANAK.pdf) provided an industry-wide public alert and mitigation guidance concerning Carbanak.\nVisa recommends that all financial institutions and retailers scan their networks for the presence of\nCarbanak. If detected, please contact law enforcement immediately and activate security incident\nprocedures.\n\n### MalumPOS\n[Discovered by TrendMicro in 2015, MalumPOS is known to specifically target Oracle MICROS point-of-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/trend-micro-discovers-malumpos-targets-hotels-and-other-us-industries/)\nsale devices. MalumPOS is described as simple and non-obfuscated malware, written in the Delphi\nprogramming language. Visa is aware that MalumPOS is still actively used by cyber criminals.\n\n#### 2. Mitigation action recommended for Oracle Micros Customers\n\n  - Change passwords for any account used by a MICROS representative to access the customer’s\non-premises systems.\n\n  - Scan network for the following:\n\n– Psexec file\n– Files with .bin extension (located in \\All users\\%AppData%\\Mozilla\\ or\nc:\\ProgramData\\Mozilla\\)\n– Svchost.exe file (located in Windows\\System32\\com\\catalogue\\)\n– Svchost.exefile (located in C:\\ProgramData\\Mozilla\\svchost.exe)\n\n           - This file provided remote access functions, such as the ability to execute arbitrary\n\ncommands, upload/download files.\n– Operating system (Windows) running services ending in “sys”\n\n  - Scan networks for IOCs linked to Carbanak:\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Scan networks for IOCs linked to MalumPOS:\n\nFile Name File Name Description\nMnv.exe 757ae5eed0c5e229ad9bae586f1281b5de053767 Oracle Forms process,\nMICROS 9700 VISAD Driver\nNvsvc.exe 2cf2f41d2454b59641a84f8180fd7e32135a0dbc MICROS 9700 SSL GW\nNvsvc.exe f728bf7d6dbfc4c7bea21d6a3fd0b88f4fe52a4a Oracle Forms process, Webbased PoS systems\nNvsvc.exe 798bc2d91293c18af7e99ba7c9a4fd3010051741 Accessed through\nMicrosoftTM, Windows\nInternet Explorer, Shift4\nCorporation Universal\n\nNvsvc.exe 90e85b471b64667dbcde3aee3fa504c0d4b0ad35 Transaction Gateway, PAR\nSpringer-Miller Systems\nRdp.exe fe713f9bb90b999250c3b6a3bba965d603de32a3 Looks like a test\nWinini.exe d0b3562d868694fd1147e15483f88f3a78ebedfb Client stub\n\n  - Additionally, Visa recommends the following best practices to reduce the risk of exposure:\n\n– Educate employees how to avoid phishing scams and opening emails with attachments\n– Maintain updates for all software and patches (address zero day vulnerabilities)\n– Turn on heuristics (behavioral analysis) on anti-malware to search for suspicious behavior\n\nVisa will continue to report any mitigation guidance, technical indicators of compromise associated with\nthis compromise, or additional details on the overall extent of the compromise as details are made\navailable.\n\n[For questions and information please contact, paymentintelligence@visa.com](mailto:paymentintelligence@visa.com)\n\nTo report a data breach, contact Visa Fraud Control:\n\n  - Asia Pacific Region, Central Europe/Middle East/Africa Region: VIFraudControl@visa.com\n\n  - U.S. and Canada: USFraudControl@visa.com\n\n3\n\n|File Name|File Name|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Mnv.exe|757ae5eed0c5e229ad9bae586f1281b5de053767|Oracle Forms process, MICROS 9700 VISAD Driver|\n|Nvsvc.exe|2cf2f41d2454b59641a84f8180fd7e32135a0dbc|MICROS 9700 SSL GW|\n|Nvsvc.exe|f728bf7d6dbfc4c7bea21d6a3fd0b88f4fe52a4a|Oracle Forms process, Web- based PoS systems|\n|Nvsvc.exe|798bc2d91293c18af7e99ba7c9a4fd3010051741|Accessed through MicrosoftTM, Windows Internet Explorer, Shift4 Corporation Universal|\n|Nvsvc.exe|90e85b471b64667dbcde3aee3fa504c0d4b0ad35|Transaction Gateway, PAR Springer-Miller Systems|\n|Rdp.exe|fe713f9bb90b999250c3b6a3bba965d603de32a3|Looks like a test|\n|Winini.exe|d0b3562d868694fd1147e15483f88f3a78ebedfb|Client stub|\n\n\n-----",
