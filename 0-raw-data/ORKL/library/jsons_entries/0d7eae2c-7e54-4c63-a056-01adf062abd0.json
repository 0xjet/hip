At the\ntime of writing this report, some of the IOCs remained active delivering new payloads,\" the\nCybereason researchers said.\n\nIn January, APT35 operators were also deploying another previously undocumented\n[PowerShell backdoor dubbed CharmPower in attacks leveraging Log4Shell exploits.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-hackers-use-new-powershell-backdoor-in-log4j-attacks/)\n\n_Attack flow (Cybereason)_\n\n## The Memento ransomware link\n\nWhile looking into attacks where the newly discovered PowerLess backdoor was used, the\nresearchers also found potential connections to Memento ransomware.\n\nThis ransomware has been active since April 2021, being deployed in attacks against\nVMware vCenter servers using exploits designed to abuse a critical pre-auth remote code\nexecution flaw patched months before, in February 2021.\n\nSophos has seen Memento operators switching from encrypting systems with a Pythonbased ransomware strain to moving files into password-protected WinRAR archives due to\nanti-ransomware protection active on compromised devices.\n\nThe links include common TTP patterns, automatically generated strings, and a domain\n(google.onedriver-srv[.]ml).\n\n\n-----\n\n[This domain is linked to an IP address mentioned in a joint advisory issued by US and UK](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-uk-warn-of-iranian-hackers-exploiting-microsoft-exchange-fortinet/)\ncybersecurity agencies in November regarding Iranian hacking groups targeting Microsoft\nExchange and Fortinet servers.\n\nAlso in November, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said it has been tracking\nsix different Iranian threat groups who have been deploying ransomware and exfiltrating data\nin attacks that started as far back as September 2020.\n\n_Ransomware attacks by Iranian APTs (Microsoft)_\n\"The activity of Phosphorus with regard to ProxyShell took place in about the same time\nframe as Memento,\" the Cybereason Nocturnus Team said.\n\n\"Iranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to ransomware during that period,\nwhich strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is operated by an Iranian threat actor.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n[Hackers exploit critical VMware RCE flaw to install backdoors](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-critical-vmware-rce-flaw-to-install-backdoors/)\n\n[OldGremlin ransomware gang targets Russia with new malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oldgremlin-ransomware-gang-targets-russia-with-new-malware/)\n\n[FIN7 hackers evolve toolset, work with multiple ransomware gangs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fin7-hackers-evolve-toolset-work-with-multiple-ransomware-gangs/)\n\n\n-----",
