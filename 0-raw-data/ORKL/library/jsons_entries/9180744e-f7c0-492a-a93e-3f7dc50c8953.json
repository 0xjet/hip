The Threat](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/category/research)\nAnalysis Reports investigate these threats and provide practical recommendations for protecting against them.\n\n[In this Threat Analysis report, the Cybereason GSOC investigates the PlugX malware family, a modular Remote Access Tool/Trojan (RAT)](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\n[often utilized by Asia-based APT groups such as APT27. The malware has backdoor capabilities to take full control of the environment with its](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\nmany malicious “plugins ”\n\n\n-----\n\ns epo t p o des a o e e o t e ug oade as e as od cat o s ac oss u t p e sa p es (s tota ) sta t g o t e yea 0\nto 2022.\n\n## Key Points\n\n**The Rule of Three: The malware may be delivered differently depending on the campaigns such as whether the initial delivering format**\nis self de-archiving or not. However, the PlugX loader always consists of three main components: a legitimate executable, a malicious\nmodule, and a malicious payload. The malware has been around for over a decade, but the format of the malware has not changed.\n\n**[Security Evasion-Focused Techniques: PlugX loader is known for utilizing DLL-Sideloading techniques for evasion purposes.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)**\nHowever, the malware is packing additional evasion techniques. This increases the chance of deploying the main PlugX payload\nsuccessfully.\n\n**Detected and Prevented: The** [Cybereason Defense Platform effectively detects and prevents the PlugX malware.](https://www.cybereason.com/platform#graphic)\n\n## Introduction\n\n[PlugX is a post-exploitation modular RAT (Remote Access Trojan), which, among other things, is known for its multiple functionalities such as](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\ndata exfiltration, keystroke grabbing, and backdoor functionality. The malware’s first publications and research papers date back to 2012.\n\n[However, according to Trend Micro, the malware has actually been around since 2008. PlugX was already making a name for itself back in](https://web.archive.org/web/20121026140131/https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-so-new-campaign/)\n2012 due to high activity within Asia.\n\n[This may have been due to the fact that the PlugX malware authors were tied to China and the operators of this malware at the time were](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/tracking-down-the-author-of-the-plugx-rat)\nlocated within Asian countries. Since then, the malware has been active and utilized by many threat actors for over the past decade. The\nmalware had many updates over the years and it does not appear to be going away anytime soon.\n\nFrom its original version, the PlugX malware has been primarily used against public-sector organizations such as governments and various\npolitical organizations. In addition, advanced threat actors utilize the malware heavily to target high profile private organizations.\n\n[For example, in June 2016, Japan’s leading tourism agency announced the leak of privacy data of 7.93 million users, which was later identified](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/15/business/corporate-business/personal-info-7-93-million-people-may-leaked-japans-biggest-travel-agency/#.V2ESV5MrInU)\nby [Trellix as an attack utilizing PlugX. The malware was also seen utilized outside of Asian countries when it targeted military and aerospace](https://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1005842.html)\ninterests in Belarus and Russia.\n\nThis may be the indicator that the malware operators for PlugX were expanding their markets and targets. Most recently, the malware was\nutilized to target [European government agencies which aided Ukrainian refugees from the recent Russia-Ukraine War.](https://socprime.com/blog/plugx-malware-used-by-china-aligned-apt-actor-ta416-targets-european-allies-to-cripple-ukrainian-refugee-services/)\n\nPlugX loader is commonly delivered via phishing emails and it is also seen delivered by exploiting a vulnerability such as ProxyLogon\n[according to Unit 42 from Palo Alto Networks. The malware is often delivered as an archived formatted file such as .zip, .rar or self-extracting](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/thor-plugx-variant/)\nRAR (SFX) archive.\n\nWithin this archived file format, the malware contains three main files:\n\nlegitimate executable\nmalicious module\nmalicious payload\n\n[The malware utilizes DLL Side-Loading as a main method to load a malicious DLL from a legitimate executable, like Acrobat Reader or a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nlegacy Microsoft binary, for instance. The benefits of using DLL Side-Loading is that the malware can hijack and masquerade the legitimate\nexecutable by loading malicious modules.

The execution of this method enables the NvSmartMax.dll to check if the OS date and time is later than 2012-01-01.\n\nIf the date and time is later than 2012-01-01, the DLL execution exits. This checking mechanism is assumed to be for malware’s release\npurpose and prohibits its usage before its official release:\n\n_OS datetime check_\n\n**Control Flow Manipulation**\n\nAfter the OS date and time is confirmed to be later than 2012-01-01, the NvSmartMax.dll fetches the address of Nv.exe’s EntryPoint and\n[proceeds to update the page protection of the EntryPoint by calling the VirtualProtect function.

The PUSH instruction “pushes” the relevant function address onto the stack and the RET\ninstruction moves the control flow into the pushed address.\n\nSamples px_2014 and px_2021 did not patch instructions to manipulate the control flow.

However, the decompressed\npayload for the samples px_2015 and px_2021 was not in complete PE file format. It was missing traditional PE signatures such as “MZ…This\n_program cannot be run in DOS mode”. The relevant section information was still intact, which was needed for the PlugX loader to allocate_\nnecessary sections to the new memory region.\n\nThis update only removed portions of the PE header. However, it contained necessary information for the code to function. This update\nprevents analysts from simply dumping the decompressed payload and conducting further analysis, since it is not in proper PE format.\n\nSample px_2015, px_2021 and px_2022 also had different headers once the decompressed payload was allocated into\n_PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE memory region:_\n\n_px_2015: XV - Roman numeral for 15._\n_px_2021: ROHT - Backward for “THOR”_\n_px_2022: .PE - Portable Executable_\n\n\n-----\n\ne d e e ces t e eade ay be e de ce o t e e s o g o ug as e\n\n**Core Deployment Methods Are Consistent Across Samples**\n\nThere are several slight detail differences while comparing samples, however there appears to be no major updates in the past decade\nregarding the deployment method of this malware.\n\nAlthough there were no major updates, the malware loader appears to have version management. This is evident from OS date and time\ncheck as well as the differences in payload headers while deploying the actual PlugX.\n\nThe lack of a major deployment method is also believed to be due to the use of the DLL Side-Loading technique. The DLL Side-Loading\ntechnique itself gives the threat actors various options on which legitimate executables to side-load the PlugX with. This evasion technique\nalready creates various combinations and an update on deployment methods deemed unnecessary\n\n## Detection and Prevention\n\n### Cybereason Defense Platform\n\n[The Cybereason Defense Platform is able to detect and prevent infections with the PlugX loader using multi-layer protection that detects and](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\nblocks malware with threat intelligence, machine learning, anti-ransomware and Next-Gen Antivirus (NGAV) capabilities:\n\n_MalOp generation based from threat intelligence as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\n## Cybereason GSOC MDR\n\nThe Cybereason GSOC recommends the following:\n\nEnable both the Signature and Artificial Intelligence modes on the Cybereason NGAV, and enable the Detect and Prevent modes of this\nfeature.\nHandle files originating from external sources (email, web browsing) with caution.\nTo hunt proactively, use the Investigation screen in the Cybereason Defense Platform and the queries in the Hunting Queries section to\nsearch for machines that are potentially infected with PlugX.
