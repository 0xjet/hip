    "plain_text": "# Reasonable IR Team Expectations\n\n**[tisiphone.net/2021/05/11/reasonable-ir-team-expectations/](https://tisiphone.net/2021/05/11/reasonable-ir-team-expectations/)**\n\nMay 11, 2021\n\nWith the surplus of ransomware attacks consistently increasing, I have unfortunately\nwitnessed another increase – in shoddy and predatory cybersecurity incident response firms\nwith good SEO taking advantage of victims. In some cases this may be opportunistic, and in\nothers simply a side effect of the shortage of senior and principal level incident responders in\nrelation to the number of incidents occurring.\n\nThe quality of Incident Response a security company provides is certainly not tied to its size,\nage, or publicity. I have seen big companies which stretch themselves too thin with new hires\nand fail to provide quality service. I have also seen small firms which excel and go above and\nbeyond. What I can tell you, is some basic indicators of the quality of service you are getting\nfrom an IR company or retainer. Here is a list of things any company worth their salt should\nbe able to provide:\n\nA request for your IR plan, initial detection, operational situation, network topology, and\nasset inventory prior to any engagement. Without these pieces of framing information,\nthe incident responders will be missing key context to form a narrative. In industrial\nenvironment, failing to understand this may also impact health and safety.\nAn introduction to the IR team and their general qualifications (certifications, formal\neducation, and/or vertical experience)\n\nBe wary of a focus on certification “alphabet soup”. Some of the shadiest incident\nresponse firms insist their responders get a laundry list of cheap hacking\ncertifications which aren’t particularly relevant to IR, instead of investing in getting\nthem quality IR certs like GCFA, GNFA, ACE, or EnCE. No certs are bad to have,\nbut that can indicate a poor focus on employee success.\nA discussion with your relevant stakeholders discussing what has been done, the\nscope of incident response, any concerns, and any operational restrictions.\nFirmly established hours and deliverable expectations for the engagement, including\nwhat will occur if IR exceeds retainer or purchased hours.\nA clear routine or schedule of touch-points via calls or email.\nDistinct conversations and advice about when to move from stage to stage in the\n[PICERL model (or equivalent).](https://www.sans.org/media/score/504-incident-response-cycle.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nTools and/or remote or onsite support as needed in gathering all required forensic\nevidence, to potentially include:\n\nTactical collection (forensic triage tools or agents – including what they will\n**connect to and system impact)**\nHard drive images\nMemory images\nNetwork captures\nLogs\nA clear explanation of why each of those very commonly collected things is or is not\nrequired, from various locations, in the specific case.\n\nI’d be concerned if a forensics company relies entirely on a triage tool or dead\nbox hard drives, and can’t explain why they don’t want to do a modern expected\npractice like collect memory.\nClear, written description and formally agreed upon scope of any substantial system\nmodification, installation, downtime, and potential service disruption which may occur.\n**Vulnerability scanning is not a normal part of modern incident response and any**\n**scanning should be very clearly scoped and justified exceptionally well.**\nA linear timeline of the incident sorted by normalized (traditionally UTC) timestamp.\nA comprehensible narrative of how and when the intrusion occurred, adversary\nactivities on the network, apparent objectives, and successful or failed security\nmeasures which came into play.\n\nWhere these questions cannot be answered, a clear explanation of why they\ncannot be (lack of logging, old evidence, volatile evidence lost during reboot,\nimproper remediation by IT, etc)\n\n\n-----",
