    "plain_text": "# Botnet of Thousands of MikroTik Routers Abused in Glupteba, TrickBot Campaigns\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/03/over-200000-microtik-routers-worldwide.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/over-200000-microtik-routers-worldwide.html)**\n\nMarch 23, 2022\n\nVulnerable routers from MikroTik have been misused to form what cybersecurity researchers have\ncalled one of the largest botnet-as-a-service cybercrime operations seen in recent years.\n\nAccording to a new piece of research published by Avast, a cryptocurrency mining campaign\n[leveraging the new-disrupted Glupteba botnet as well as the infamous TrickBot malware were all](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/google-disrupts-blockchain-based.html)\ndistributed using the same command-and-control (C2) server.\n\n\"The C2 server serves as a botnet-as-a-service controlling nearly 230,000 vulnerable MikroTik\nrouters,\" Avast's senior malware researcher, Martin Hron, [said in a write-up, potentially linking it to](https://decoded.avast.io/martinhron/meris-and-trickbot-standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants/)\nwhat's now called the Mēris botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nThe botnet is known to exploit a known vulnerability in the Winbox component of MikroTik routers\n[(CVE-2018-14847), enabling the attackers to gain unauthenticated, remote administrative access to](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/over-300000-mikrotik-devices-found.html)\n[any affected device. Parts of the Mēris botnet were sinkholed in late](https://rt-solar.ru/events/news/2343/) [September 2021.](https://therecord.media/russian-security-firm-sinkholes-part-of-the-dangerous-meris-ddos-botnet/)\n\n\"The [CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability, which was publicized in 2018, and for which MikroTik issued a](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/mikrotik-router-hacking.html)\nfix for, allowed the cybercriminals behind this botnet to enslave all of these routers, and to\npresumably rent them out as a service,\" Hron said.\n\nIn attack chain observed by Avast in July 2021, vulnerable MikroTik routers were targeted to\nretrieve the first-stage payload from a domain named bestony[.]club, which was then used to fetch\nadditional scripts from a second domain \"globalmoby[.]xyz.\"\n\nInteresting enough, both the domains were linked to the same IP address: 116.202.93[.]14, leading\nto the discovery of seven more domains that were actively used in attacks, one of which\n(tik.anyget[.]ru) was used to serve Glupteba malware samples to targeted hosts.\n\n\"When requesting the URL https://tik.anyget[.]ru I was redirected to the https://routers.rip/site/login\ndomain (which is again hidden by the Cloudflare proxy),\" Hron said. \"This is a control panel for the\norchestration of enslaved MikroTik routers,\" with the page displaying a live counter of devices\nconnected into the botnet.\n\n[But after details of the Mēris botnet entered public domain in early September 2021, the C2 server](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/meris-botnet-hit-russias-yandex-with.html)\nis said to have abruptly stopped serving scripts before disappearing completely.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n[The disclosure also coincides with a new report from Microsoft, which revealed how the TrickBot](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/trickbot-malware-abusing-hacked-iot.html)\nmalware has weaponized MikroTik routers as proxies for command-and-control communications\nwith the remote servers, raising the possibility that the operators may have used the same botnetas-a-service.\n\nIn light of these attacks, it's recommended that users update their routers with the latest security\npatches, set up a strong router password, and disable the router's administration interface from the\npublic side.\n\n\"It also shows, what is quite obvious for some time already, that IoT devices are being heavily\ntargeted not just to run malware on them, which is hard to write and spread massively considering\nall the different architectures and OS versions, but to simply use their legal and built-in capabilities\n\n\n-----\n\nto set them up as proxies, Hron said. This is done to either anonymize the attacker s traces or to\nserve as a DDoS amplification tool.\"\n\n**_Update: Latvian company MikroTik told The Hacker News that the number \"was only true before_**\nwe released the patch in [the] year 2018. After patch was released, the actual affected number of\ndevices is closer to 20,000 units that still run the older software. Also, not all of them are actually\ncontrolled by the botnet, many of them have a strict firewall in place, even though running older\nsoftware.\"\n\nWhen reached out to Avast for comment, the cybersecurity company confirmed that the number of\naffected devices (~230,000) reflected the status of the botnet prior to its disruption. \"However, there\nare still isolated routers with compromised credentials or staying unpatched on the internet,\" the\ncompany said in a statement.\n\n_(The headline of the article has been corrected to take into account the fact that the number of_\n_affected MikroTik routers is no longer more than 200,000 as previously stated.)_\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
