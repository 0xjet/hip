She was old and needed medicine, and\noften she’d buy her medicine in Mexico. I have many fond memories of taking an all-day road\ntrip to Mexico, getting across the border, trying to find la farmacia, hoping we’d get the right\nmedicine there, figuring out a way to get it back over the border, and then driving home. The\nthing is, here in the US, medicine is crazy expensive, so making the trip down to Mexico for\nmedicine was worth it to us. [MUSIC] My grandma was just someone looking for deals and\ntrying to save money. But this is a common story I’ve heard from other people in the US, too.\nYeah, it’s often illegal to do this, because the US doesn’t want people importing drugs that\naren’t FDA-approved, but still, people do it. But then, another option landed on the table;\npharmacies began to appear online. Suddenly, you could order your medicines from your\ncomputer and get it delivered right to your front door, and that changed everything.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Read Full Transcript](https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/110)\n\n[Previous Episode](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/109/) [Next Episode](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/111/)\n\n\n-----",
