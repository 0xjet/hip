This is due in part to the lack of ground\ntruth knowledge about ransomware. Ransomware encryption speed is one area that merits further study. To date,\nthe most comprehensive information on this subject comes from the LockBit ransomware authors themselves,\nwho provide a comparison of ransomware family encryption speeds on their website to advertise that they are the\n“fastest.” This paper aims to illuminate an area of study that was previously left to criminals. Utilizing the scientific\n\nmethod in a controlled environment, we measured the speed at which 10 variants of popular ransomware malware\nencrypted nearly 100,000 files, totalling nearly 53GB, across different Windows operating systems and hardware\nspecifications. Through this work, we hope to give defenders more knowledge and confidence to move “left of boom\"\nwith their detections rather than waiting to detect during the “actions on objective” phase that is discussed in the\nLockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain whitepaper.\n\nTo determine the speed of ransomware encryption, we created a modified version of the Splunk Attack Range lab\n\nenvironment to execute 10 samples of each of the 10 ransomware variants on four hosts. Two hosts ran the operating\nsystem Windows 10 and the other two hosts ran Windows Server 2019. We chose to attribute the ransomware\nsamples to each variant by only selecting samples confirmed by Microsoft Defender Antivirus in VirusTotal. We\nassigned each host \"high\" or \"mid\" level resources to test how ransomware would behave with different processors,\nmemory, and hard drive configurations. We enabled Windows logging on each host to collect, synthesize, and\nanalyze the data in Splunk. This allowed us to measure how fast the ransomware variants encrypted nearly 100,000\nfiles, and how the ransomware utilized system resources like processor, memory and disk.\n\nAfter running all one hundred ransomware samples, we determined the total time to encrypt (TTE) varied from four\n\nminutes to three and a half hours with a median speed of 42 minutes. This narrow timeline provides a limited window\nfor organizations to effectively respond before encryption is complete. When comparing identical ransomware\nstrains across systems with different resources, we found some variables could impact TTE, such as processor\nspeeds or CPU cores. However, the impact was inconsistent, implying that some ransomware was single-threaded or\nminimally able to take advantage of additional resources. LockBit ransomware was the fastest variant to encrypt on\nany system. This aligns with previous reports that LockBit only encrypts 4KB of each file, rendering the file unusable\nand expediting the attack. The title of \"fastest ransomware\" also matches the LockBit developer's own public claims\non the group’s Tor website.\n\nSURGe plans to build upon this research to create a comprehensive, high-level overview of ransomware for network\ndefenders. In particular, we plan to review the file access techniques of multiple ransomware samples using opensource file analysis framework tools like stoQ, fuzzy algorithms, and Splunk's Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK).\nFurthermore, we plan to investigate claims that modern ransomware is not masked with packers and determine\nif it is possible to cluster to-be-determined classifiers of unknown ransomware binaries as they are “deployed”\nrather than detect them after execution. We plan to release the dataset for this research at .conf22 in June of 2022.\nWe encourage researchers to investigate this corpus and validate or build upon our findings to help the global\ncommunity of blue teamers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key Findings\n\n- LockBit ransomware performed the fastest out of 10 ransomware variants in our testing, which aligns with the\n\nransomware group’s claims on their Tor site\n\n- The median time for ransomware variants to encrypt across a corpus of 98,561 files measuring 53.83 GB, was 42\n\nminutes and 52 seconds.\n\n- Individual ransomware samples varied greatly in encryption speed, ranging from four minutes to three and a half hours.\n\n- Improved hardware capabilities provided some ransomware samples with faster encryption speeds. Other\n\nsamples and variants were unable to take advantage of the increased resources, and at times they performed\nworse on the systems with higher specifications. Additional memory did not have a significant effect on\nencryption speed for any of the samples. Higher disk speeds may play a role in faster execution, but most likely in\ncombination with a variant that can take advantage of additional CPU cores.\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn the 2021 M-Trends report, Mandiant found that 25% of their investigations in 2020 involved ransomware, up\nfrom 14% in 2019.[1] The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) of 2021 states that ransomware doubled in\nfrequency from 2019 to 2021.[2] Although relatively new in the public consciousness, this style of malware has afflicted\nthe world since it was first introduced at an AIDS conference in 1989 via floppy disks.[3]\n\nFigure 1. Spunk chart highlighting the growth of ransomware families from 2013 to 2022.\n\nThe previously mentioned M-Trends report states that in the Americas, ransomware has a median dwell time of\n\nthree days.[4] A dwell time of three days does not sound ideal, but there is a long-held perception that ransomware\nhas a shorter dwell time of mere hours or even minutes. If the median dwell time is measured in days and not hours,\ndefenders have a small window of opportunity to take action. In 2021, CERT NZ published a whitepaper that outlines\nthe lifecycle of ransomware with recommendations to help organizations combat this growing threat (fig. 2).[5]\n\n[1.

Detailed progression of a ransomware incident from CERT NZ.\n\nThis work by CERT NZ and the three-day dwell time cited by Mandiant\n\nled us to question how organizations can actively defend against\nransomware. Before we began looking at defensive methodologies, we\ndecided to first investigate two questions:\n\n- Primarily, how long do ransomware strains take to encrypt a host?\n\n- Can an organization recover or prevent the complete encryption of file\n\nsystems?\n\nReverse engineers have done great work to learn why some\nransomware strains are so fast to encrypt. With the exception of an\nadvertisement from the Lockbit ransomware group, we were unable to\nfind any empirical study that compares the speed of encryption among\ndifferent ransomware families.[6,7] This paper outlines our analysis of the\ndynamically evaluated encryption speed for 10 ransomware families\nand provides some suggestions for blue teamers to better inform their\ndefenses. It should be noted that this paper does not aim to create\nransomware detections. Rather, our objective is to inform defenders of\nthe holistic truth of ransomware encryption speeds.\n\n\nThis paper outlines our\nanalysis of the dynamically\nevaluated encryption\nspeed for 10 ransomware\nfamilies and provides\nsome suggestions for blue\nteamers to better inform\ntheir defenses.”\n\n\n[6. “LockBit BLOG,” accessed February 13, 2022, http://lockbitapt6vx57t3eeqjofwgcglmutr3a35nygvokja5uuccip4ykyd[.]onion.ly/conditions.](http://lockbitapt6vx57t3eeqjofwgcglmutr3a35nygvokja5uuccip4ykyd[.]onion.ly/conditions)\n[7.

The Most Honest and the Fastest,” Gridinsoft LLC, accessed January 29, 2022, https://gridinsoft.com.](https://gridinsoft.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Setting the Stage\n\nWe started to brainstorm our hypothesis with unbounded questions about how fast ransomware encrypts and how\norganizations can move “left of boom” if the ransomware encrypts quicker than expected.[8] We began by synthesizing\nour questions to a single hypothesis: If an adversary gains access to a system and deploys ransomware, then\nencryption will occur faster than network defenders can realistically prevent. The Verizon DBIR states that the\nmajority of organizations detect breaches days after an adversary gains access to a system, rather than hours\nor minutes.[9] To test our hypothesis, we needed to create a lab for repeated testing, gather samples of different\nransomware binaries, and then analyze our findings. We also desired to conduct this research in a manner that\ncatered to blue teamers. Thus, we chose not to perform static reverse engineering work on the malware binaries,\nbut instead executed them dynamically in a controlled environment and measured them against the same variables.\nWe plan to include a detailed explanation of our methodology and technical process in future blogs, papers, and\nconference presentations.\n\nIn this section of the whitepaper, we explain how we framed our experiment to test our hypothesis. We also detail\nthe high-level architecture, configuration of our malware lab, and how and why we sourced our malware. Finally, we\nset out any known assumptions in our research and analysis that may present bias in our findings.\n\n### Methodology\n\nTo test our hypothesis, we needed to execute a variety of ransomware strains in a controlled environment, gather\n\nnative Windows performance telemetry data back from endpoint hosts, and analyze the data. We selected 10\nransomware families with 10 separate binaries from each of those families in order to prevent clustering illusion,\nthe tendency to see patterns where none exist, and confirmation bias, the tendency to seek out information\nthat supports one's beliefs. For each Windows endpoint type and resource specification, a single Amazon Web\nServices (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created for each family and each individual binary ran on its own\nhost specifically created for its evaluation. The results were forwarded to a central Splunk instance for analysis.\nEvery host had 98,561 files placed in 100 directories. These file types were sourced from the Digital Corpora and\ndeemed by the authors to be the most likely file types for ransomware binaries to encrypt.[10,11,12] These files were made\navailable under the CC0 license and sourced from public U.S. government websites. Finally, we enabled Event ID\n4663 on Windows hosts in order to see encryption on files and baseline the speed of each ransomware family.[13]\n\n8.

The performance of the ransomware was gathered using native Windows auditing and logging\ncapabilities that forwarded the results back to a Splunk instance. Details on the telemetry setup are covered in more\ndetail in the Experiment Procedure section. Each ransomware sample ran inside an independent, self-contained\nenvironment. The Splunk instance in each ransomware environment forwarded the events to a single Splunk\ninstance for comparing, analyzing, and reporting. We created the lab by modifying Splunk’s open-source Attack\nRange tool for our experiment (fig. 3).[14] Attack Range allows network defenders to dynamically create small networks\nin AWS with Splunk software and logging preconfigured using a combination of Terraform and Ansible.\n\nFigure 3. A high-level overview of our custom Attack Range.\n\nThe hosts on this range had specifications that aligned with many modern laptop or server builds according to\n\norganizations that we gathered anecdotal feedback from and popular websites like PC Mag.[15] These hosts had\nMicrosoft Defender uninstalled, and no additional anti-virus (AV) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools\ninstalled. We installed additional tools including a Splunk agent to send information back to Splunk and the Microsoft\napplication Sysmon.[16] Finally, to detect any worming or remote mapped file encryption, these hosts were joined\nto a Windows domain with an open network share (C Drive) on the domain controller. More information about the\nhost specifications and the logging configurations can be found in the appendices A and B. In order to capture file\nencryption events, we enabled object level auditing on the test directory and all sub-directories for both successful\nand failed access attempts. By enabling object level auditing, Event Code 4663 events were generated each time\nthe ransomware binary attempted to encrypt a file. The final 4663 event to conclude a successful encryption of a\nfile was DELETE, which is what we used to track encryption speed. While this event was seen consistently across the\nfamilies we tested, this DELETE event may not be present in other families. If this is the case, a different marker might\nbe needed to measure TTE.\n\n[14.

This methodology had the added benefit of emulating modern ransomware campaigns where\nransomware is executed by human operators via scripts rather than by victims on desktops. Furthermore, it reduced\nsome overhead of “human interaction,” which allowed the ransomware to utilize more system resources than would have\notherwise been available. We did not pass any flags to the ransomware when it executed. The only ransomware variant\nthat we executed in a different manner was Babuk, as it would not run reliably using the remote PowerShell method, and\nwe therefore started Babuk interactively on each host. Two different hardware profiles for each operating system were\nused to evaluate ransomware performance. The exact specifications for these profiles can be found in Appendix B.\n\nThe PowerShell script allowed us to select the ransomware sample we wanted to run. The script would then iterate\n\nthrough the number of Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 hosts in the domain and initiate downloads of the\nransomware binaries via a remote web server. Each test run was either on a Windows 10 or Windows Server host,\nnever both at the same time.\n\nWhen the download finished on each host, the PowerShell script launched each ransomware binary remotely, except\nfor Babuk. We were then able to analyze the speed that each variant encrypted files using Windows security event\nlogs. Event Code 4663 (an attempt was made to access an object) was required to capture the encryption events\nreliably. We enabled file system auditing for the 100 test directories on the Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019\nhosts in order to generate the required event logs.\n\n### The Ransomware Binaries\n\nThe 100 ransomware samples across 10- ransomware families were sourced from VirusTotal. We solely leveraged\n\nMicrosoft Defender detections from VirusTotal for ransomware family attribution. The ransomware families were\nselected due to their prevalence over the past 12 to 24 months (fig. 4).\n\nFigure 4. The 10 ransomware families and their respective strains were selected for our research.\n\nThe VirusTotal detection strings and SHA256 hashes of each binary tested in each family can be found in Appendix C\n\n\n-----\n\n### Results\n\nThe answer to our initial question of how fast ransomware encrypts showed a large variance between ransomware\n\nfamilies. We wanted to understand the encryption speed and duration for each sample as well as the median\nspeed and duration across the families themselves. Using the median value as opposed to the average/mean value\nprevented small numbers of outliers from skewing the overall results of a particular family.\n\nAs we collected Windows Perfmon data during our testing, we observed that some families utilized increased\n\nsystem resources better than others. Some of the families were very efficient, while others tended to utilize large\npercentages of CPU time along with very high disk access rates. There was no direct correlation between a sample\nusing a larger amount of system resources with a faster encryption speed. Some ransomware families performed\nworse, or even crashed, when deployed on the faster test systems.\n\nOn a per sample basis, the fastest encryption time across the 98,561 test files observed was 4 minutes and 9 seconds.\nThis was performed by lockbit-9.exe (133adb408a4837d3a20634d79baf01151061c49cd936e9a8787b91df8997b6b0)\n\non a Windows 2019 Server high specification instance (fig. 5).\n\nFigure 5. Data from the lockbit-9.exe sample deployed on a Windows 2019 server.\n\nConversely, the slowest encryption time observed for the same test file set was 3 hours, 35 minutes and 8 seconds.\nThis was performed by babuk-5.exe (1b9412ca5e9deb29aeaa37be05ae8d0a8a636c12fdff8c17032aa017f6075c02)\n\non a Windows 10 mid specification instance (fig. 6).\n\nFigure 6. Data from the babuk-5.exe sample deployed on a Windows 10 instance.\n\nWhen we look at the median encryption duration across each family tested we found that although a single sample of\nBabuk was the slowest ransomware to encrypt, the Babuk family as a whole was the second fastest with a duration\nof 6 minutes and 34 seconds. LockBit was still the fastest overall at 5 minutes and 50 seconds. The slowest median\nencryption time per family was Mespinoza, (PYSA) with a median duration time of 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 54 seconds.\nOverall, the median encryption duration across all ransomware families was 42 minutes and 52 seconds (fig. 7).\n\nFamily Median Duration\n\nLockBit 00:05:50\n\nBabuk 00:06:34\n\nAvaddon 00:13:15\n\nRyuk 00:14:30\n\nRevil 00:24:16\n\nBlackMatter 00:43:03\n\nDarkside 00:44:52\n\nConti 00:59:34\n\nMaze 01:54:33\n\nMespinoza (PYSA) 01:54:54\n\nAverage of the median 00:42:52\n\nFigure 7. Median encryption duration across 10 ransomware families.\n\n|Family|Median Duration|\n|---|---|\n|LockBit|00:05:50|\n|Babuk|00:06:34|\n|Avaddon|00:13:15|\n|Ryuk|00:14:30|\n|Revil|00:24:16|\n|BlackMatter|00:43:03|\n|Darkside|00:44:52|\n|Conti|00:59:34|\n|Maze|01:54:33|\n|Mespinoza (PYSA)|01:54:54|\n|Average of the median|00:42:52|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe average median duration demonstrates a limited window of time to respond to a ransomware attack once the\n\nencryption process is underway. This can prove even more limiting considering that the catastrophic apex may be\nwhen a single critical file is encrypted, rather than the whole of the victim’s data. With such factors in play, it may\nprove to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the majority of organizations to mitigate a ransomware attack\nonce the encryption process begins. While detection and defensive capabilities are beyond the scope of this\nresearch, all is not lost for those looking to defend themselves against ransomware attacks.\n\nWe took care to ensure our methodology for capturing this data didn’t influence the outcome of the data we\ncollected. However, we were limited in our ability to measure the latency that these tools, such as Sysmon and\nconstrained Object Level Auditing, may have introduced. We don’t believe these tools caused any significant latency\nthat would drastically alter the findings in our research. Future research that focuses on ransomware encryption\nspeeds may wish to ensure that there is a means of measuring the latency that tooling may introduce. Finally, we\nrecognize that the attribution of ransomware samples to “families'' can be difficult. In order to ensure consistent\nbias of sample selection for this research, we compared the hashes of each sample with Microsoft Defender results\nobtained from VirusTotal. The signature name was extracted and then normalized. We then used the resulting\nnormalized value to identify the specific ransomware family.\n\n### Conclusions and Further Work\n\nThe goal of this research was to empirically evaluate the encryption speed of common ransomware families across a\n\nvariety of operating systems and hardware specifications in order to determine if organizations could realistically react\nin time for effective mitigation. Based on our median results, our findings indicated a total loss of data via ransomware\nencryption occurs in under 43 minutes. The encryption and loss of data is the “actions on objective” of the formerly\nmentioned Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain. Forty-three minutes is an extremely limited window of opportunity for\nmitigation, especially considering that the average time to detect compromise is three days, as the Mandiant M-Trends\nreport found. As a result, we postulate that it’s unlikely many organizations can prevent a total loss of data from\nransomware. If an organization wishes to defend against ransomware, it’s clear that they need to move left on the cyber\nkill chain and detect on delivery or exploitation rather than actions on objective. We are hopeful that findings from this\nresearch can help network defenders better explore and identify potential opportunities for mitigation. It should also\nbe noted that although we configured our lab to detect wormable behavior by the ransomware samples, the majority of\nsamples had no such behavior. Future research will explore worming behavior in further depth.\n\nOur research does not stop with this work. We plan to release this corpus of information on the Splunk BOSS Platform\nto enable additional areas of research that warrant exploration. More specifically, we hope to evaluate the patterns that\nransomware exhibits when encrypting files, ransomware worming behavior, how to cluster similar ransomware binaries\nbased on fuzzy hashing algorithms, and future analysis of ransomware family attribution over time.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nResearch like this takes more than just the primary and secondary investigators to create.
