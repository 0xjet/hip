It requires collecting diverse intelligence, analyzing it\nand deciding who is responsible. Rarely does the evidence available to researchers reach a\nlevel of proof that would be acceptable in a court of law. Nevertheless, the private sector\nrises to the challenge to attempt to associate cyber attacks to threat actors using the\nintelligence available to them. This intelligence takes the form of open-source intelligence\n(OSINT), or analysis of the technical intelligence (TECHINT), possibly derived from\nproprietary data. Indicators in these sources tend to point toward a threat actor if they have\nused the same methods in the past, or reused infrastructure from previous attacks.\n\nIntelligence agencies have additional sources of intelligence available to them that are not\navailable to the private sector. The public saw a glimpse into this with a report that the Dutch\n[agency AIVD compromised a security camera in the building used by APT29, an infamous](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~b4f8111b/)\nthreat actor. This allowed the Dutch Intelligence Agencies to provide vital intelligence\nregarding the activities of APT29 to their allies. Such intelligence is beyond the reach of\nprivate-sector researchers.\n\nIntelligence agencies tend to be reserved, and publish relatively few articles that include\nattribution, at least in comparison to the private sector. Hence, when an intelligence agency,\n[like the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) directly attributed the WellMess](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/16/2002457639/-1/-1/0/NCSC_APT29_ADVISORY-QUAD-OFFICIAL-20200709-1810.PDF)\nmalware to APT29 in a report endorsed by Canada's Communications Security\nEstablishment (CSE), the U.S.'s National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of\nHomeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS CISA), you can\nexpect that these agencies have solid evidence to back their claims.\n\nGiven this, it is interesting to examine the evidence available to us as a threat intelligence\nand security research group to support these conclusions. Attribution is typically not our goal.\nWe aim to protect customers against threats, raise awareness of current threats, and support\nthe security community. We recognize that we don't have the depth of visibility of an\nintelligence or law enforcement agency, but we do have access to a wealth of information,\nincluding open-source intelligence that helps us achieve our goals.\n\n## Infrastructure and TTPs sharing\n\nThe WellMess malware is an excellent example of how examination of infrastructure and the\ntechniques used in an attack can lead to different conclusions. The Japanese national CERT\n[named this malware in their July 2018 report. Two years later, the malware was used in](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html)\nattacks targeting COVID-19 [vaccine research.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence-services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks)\n\n\n-----\n\nWritten in Go, the malware has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, for both Linux (ELF) and Windows\n[(PE) environments. The malware is known to use multiple protocols to conduct C2](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-198b)\ncommunications including DNS, HTTP and HTTPS. The malware exfiltrates information\nregarding the system that it infected, before waiting for further instructions, which potentially\ninclude the execution of commands on the infected system and the exfiltration of additional\ndata.\n\n### Attribution pivots\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nA common technique for linking separate campaigns is by pivoting on common\ninfrastructure:\n\nMalware A uses infrastructure X.\nMalware B, associated with threat actor M, also uses infrastructure X.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that malware A is also associated with threat actor M, linking the attacks\nthrough the shared infrastructure X\n\nThis technique can be used to investigate malicious IP addresses and domains. However, it's\nworth remembering the differences in ownership between domains and IP addresses.\nDomains are registered by their owners. This means that any IP address referenced by a\ndomain is linked in some way to the domain owner.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, IP addresses typically host services on behalf of many different\norganizations and individuals. The users of an IP address may be completely unknown to\neach other and have no awareness of the others' activities. Hence, while we can associate\nIP addresses with many domains, we can't be sure that the registered owners of these\ndomains are linked without additional indicators.\n\nWe can investigate two samples of WellMess to check what we know about attribution.\n\nSample 0b8e6a11adaa3df120ec15846bb966d674724b6b92eae34d63b665e0698e0193 was\nsubmitted to VirusTotal on May 23, 2018. The C2 server of this sample is 45.123.190[.]168.\n\nThis IP address had two domains pointing to it over time:\n\n2016-12-24 to 2019-12-04   layers[.]wincodec[.]com\n**2017-11-25 to 2018-11-18** **onedrive-jp[.]com**\n\nWe can link WellMess to onedrive-jp[.]com, because at the time the malware was\nsubmitted to VirusTotal, this domain was pointing to the IP address the malware was using\nfor C2.\n\nLet's check the history of this domain:\n\n2020-07-17 to 2020-07-17   52.45.178[.]122\n2018-11-22 to 2018-12-29   209.99.40[.]222\n2018-11-21 to 2018-12-25   209.99.40[.]223\n2017-11-25 to 2018-11-18   45.123.190[.]168\n**2017-12-19 to 2018-11-03** **198.251.83[.]27**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional research showed that during an overlapping time frame, the IP address\n198.251.83[.]27 is also linked to onedrive-jp[.]com.\n\nExamining the history of this IP address, we find that the domain my-iri[.]org pointed to this\nIP address from April 13 - 19, 2018. During this time, the domain my-iri[.]org was mentioned\nby Microsoft as being associated with attacks against U.S. political institutions and attributed\n[to APT28 — more details here and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/we-are-taking-new-steps-against-broadening-threats-to-democracy/) [here.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/microsoft-says-it-has-found-a-russian-operation-targeting-us-political-institutions/2018/08/20/52273e14-a4d2-11e8-97ce-cc9042272f07_story.html)\n\nThese events in a timeline look like this:\n\nThe evidence is weak, but we have an association with APT28 rather than APT29 which is a\ndifferent threat actor. [APT28 and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/) [APT29 are usually considered to be different organisations](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/)\nwithin the same country. So here could be an alternative investigative path.\n\nUnrelated note on this sample:\n\nAnother interesting element about this specific sample is the filename: QnapSSL. Qnap\ndevices have x64 CPU and run on a Linux system. Potentially, this is an indicator that the\nmalware may run on these devices.\n\n**TTPs**\n\nWe can also examine the tactics, techniques & procedures (TTPs) of the threat actor, by\nidentifying similarities in how campaigns are conducted.\n\nLet's consider another WellMess sample:\n65495d173e305625696051944a36a031ea94bb3a4f13034d8be740982bc4ab75.\n\nThe original name of the sample was \"SangforUD.exe,\" the filename of the Sangfor VPN\nclient. Examining VirusTotal shows that some of the detection engines detect this sample as\n\"DarkHotel:\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe filename and detection name are reminiscent of the research report from the Chinese\nsecurity firm Qihoo 360 on the DarkHotel attacks. Although the original report is no longer\n[available, media coverage is still online here, and the press release from the date of](https://www.zdnet.com/article/darkhotel-hackers-use-vpn-zero-day-to-compromise-chinese-government-agencies/)\n[discovery of the attack in April 2020 is available here.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lKp_3kPNEycXqfCnVPxoDw)\n\nIn this attack, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Sangfor SSL VPN Server (which\nQihoo alleges is DarkHotel) to replace the SangforUD.exe client binary with a trojanized\nversion. When a client connects to the malicious server, it automatically downloaded and\nexecuted the new trojanized version of the VPN client.\n\nThis sample was submitted to VirusTotal on Jan. 21, 2020, a few months before the attack\nwas discovered and published.\n\nThe [DarkHotel APT group are a distinct threat actor known for targeting east Asia. Although](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0012/)\nthis is a weak link, it creates another investigation path that, if properly corroborated, could\nlead to different attribution.\n\n### Analysing the evidence\n\nThe NCSC report clearly attributes the attack to APT29. We can't confirm or refute this\nconclusion, mainly because their intelligence is not publicly available and can be assumed to\ncombine several different types of intelligence sources. Our own TECHINT-based research\nof the infrastructure indicates that WellMess might be associated with APT28. However, our\nTTP pivots suggest the malware could be linked to DarkHotel.\n\nAPT28 and APT29 are different organisations assumed to be running out of the same\ncountry, but DarkHotel is linked to a completely different country. It's possible that APT28 and\nAPT29 may share the same geopolitical ambitions but given the publicly available\ninformation about these threat actors, it is very unlikely that they would share infrastructure.\nFurthermore, it is extremely unlikely that any of these two groups would collaborate with\nDarkHotel\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can also use these observations to formulate some different hypotheses:\n\nThe attribution concerning the Sangfor VPN servers hack may be incorrect. Was this\nan attack carried out by APT28 or APT29 rather than DarkHotel?\nTwo different threat actors targeted the same VPN software at the same time by\ncoincidence.\nOr, possibly, there is an unknown common factor between the threat actors that led to\nthem targeting the same software.\n\nTo further complicate attribution, CoreSec360 published a post in Chinese about WellMess\n[and the exploitation of VPN vulnerabilities here. In this post, the author attributes WellMess](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WmzryWNNJVV7mXABQ1Yu8g)\nto an unknown actor they name APT-C-42.\n\nIndividually, each link appears feasible, but put into a wider picture they are incompatible with\neach other. Some of these links may be false flags, some may be due to coincidental factors.\nIn any case, the best we can say is that attribution of this case is complex.\n\n## False flags\n\nIn some cases, false evidence is planted deliberately to confuse researchers. In\nacknowledging the existence of false flags, we must also admit it's possible researchers\nhave misattributed attacks after being fooled by the threat actor.\n\nOne of the most egregious examples of false flags was that of Olympic Destroyer, the\nmalware that disrupted the opening of the 2018 Winter Olympics. In this attack, the threat\nactor left clues in the malware that potentially implicated three different state-sponsored\nactors in carrying out the attack.\n\n[The logic of the wiper functionality of the malware was similar to that used by the Bluenoroff](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/who-wasnt-responsible-for-olympic.html)\ngroup, as was the file naming convention in a file system check. However, the technique of\n[autonomous spread was like the NotPetya malware, attributed to APT28. Additional features](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-russia-cyberattack-hack-blame)\n[in the code were also identified as having been used by APT3 and APT10 in the past.](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\n\nIt is likely that the threat actor understood how analysts arrive at conclusions of attribution\nand wanted to include artefacts to lead analysts astray. We have already discussed these in\n[detail in this blog post.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/who-wasnt-responsible-for-olympic.html)\n\nIn this case, attribution via TECHINT was not possible. The pivot points that might be used\nby researchers had been deliberately falsified. However, additional intelligence was almost\ncertainly available to intelligence agencies. In unofficial briefings, US intelligence personnel\n[reportedly linked the Olympic Destroyer attack to the Sandworm group. Subsequently,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/04/we-need-hold-kremlin-responsible-its-cyberattack-olympics/) EU\nsanctions listed Olympic Destroyer as an alias of the Sandworm group, supporting the\nattribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nCases such as these make a good point for analysts not to rely on TTPs or code analysis\nalone. Additional intelligence is required — usually of the level that only intelligence agencies\nhave — to untangle the threads. Understandably, intelligence agencies are often reticent to\n[disclose too much information or provide proof that can be externally verified.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-spies-hacked-the-olympics-and-tried-to-make-it-look-like-north-korea-did-it-us-officials-say/2018/02/24/44b5468e-18f2-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html)\n\nAnalysts must be open to the idea that any clues they find might have been planted\ndeliberately, and to keep an open mind until the full picture can be assembled.\n\n## Shared Code\n\nSoftware engineers like to reuse tried and trusted code in their projects, including code that\nthey are familiar with, and that they know works increases productivity and helps ensure that\ntheir project will be delivered on time and within budget. Threat actors are no different.\n\nWe follow the development programs of threat actors and observe any features they add to\ntheir malware. The Bisonal malware associated with the Tonto Team which we published\nrecently is a good example of this. We can follow the software development program of the\nthreat actor over 10 years.\n\n[However, there are pitfalls in this approach. In June 2020, Unit42 identified the ACIDBox](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/acidbox-rare-malware/)\nmalware. Unit42 was clear in their conclusion that they cannot attribute ACIDBox to the\nthreat actor Turla.\n\nA few days later, a prolific and respected security researcher published a blog highlighting\n[code similarities between ACIDBox and Turla Nautilus samples here. This was based on a](https://www.epicturla.com/blog/acidbox-clustering)\npiece of code shared between the two malware that although small, seemed unique enough\nto be used for attribution. Without claiming absolute certainty, the researcher posted their\n[findings for the community to vet. One eagle-eyed researcher on Twitter, @TheEnergyStory,](https://twitter.com/theenergystory?lang%3Den)\npointed out the shared code is, in fact, compiled Mbed TLS implementation code.\n\nLike many software engineers, the threat actor chose to include a common library in their\nproject to provide functionality that they didn't want to redevelop themselves.\n\nFinding common code between malware doesn't necessarily show that the samples are\nrelated. Third-party libraries can be included independently in different samples without the\nsamples being related. Of course, finding a shared library doesn't discount the possibility that\ntwo samples are related, but it doesn't contribute to the debate.\n\nThis example illustrates another important point. Sharing information with the community of\nsecurity researchers and inviting feedback is vital. Within a few hours of the original\npublication, a third-party researcher identified the source of the shared code and explained\nits inclusion. Thus allowing the original researcher to update their research with the new\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttribution is complex and difficult at the best of times. Traditional intelligence agencies rely\non a variety of intelligence sources to arrive at a conclusion. This type of information is often\nnot available to private companies, who tend to make conclusions solely from TECHINT\nwhich can be problematic. Once we take into consideration that threat actors may be\npurposefully conducting false-flag operations to deliberately confuse analysts, attribution\nbecomes even more difficult.\n\nThe challenge of attribution, in particular with the complication of false-flag activity, means\nthat some of the industry's chains of associations upon which allegations of attribution are\nmade may be incorrect. Private-sector researchers, without the support of traditional\nintelligence capability, should be cognizant of these risks.\n\nWhen a set of some of the world's most well-known intelligence agencies attribute an attack\nto a threat actor, this attribution cannot be discounted off hand — even if they do not provide\nthe community with all the information that supports their attribution. With the information and\ntechniques available to us, we cannot confirm such an attribution. This is not to say that we\nrefute the attribution, but that we are missing the intelligence or logic that was used to come\nto such a conclusion.\n\nAttribution is as much of a science of collecting verifiable information as it is an art of\nassembling a hypothesis and being aware of the information which is missing to support that\nhypothesis. Hence, allegations of attribution should be approached with an open mind but\nbeing aware that the body making the allegation has more information than they are letting\nbe made public.\n\n\n-----",
