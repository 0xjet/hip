The sample used here is from an EMOTET to TRICKBOT infection\n\"GTAG:mor14\" courtesy of [Malware-Traffic-Analysis. 👏👏](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/)\n\n## Samples Used\n\nC:\\Users\\AUSER\\AppData\\Roaming\\netcloud\\բնութագրվում է.exe\nC:\\Users\\AUSER\\AppData\\Roaming\\colorsallow.exe\n\nSHA256 Hash:\n[3A6C3F7B99B2E76914FBC338C622B92F9825CB77729B8BF050BA64ECE1679818](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3a6c3f7b99b2e76914fbc338c622b92f9825cb77729b8bf050ba64ece1679818/detection)\n\n[Continuing on some past research on TRICKBOT's arsenal of modules, I knew that there](https://www.sneakymonkey.net/2019/05/22/trickbot-analysis/)\nwas a PowerShell EMPIRE module `NewBCtestDll64 but never saw it ITW (in-the-wild)`\nmyself.\n\n\n-----\n\n[2018-10-08 - Quick post: #Trickbot gtag sat75 infection with #PowershellEmpire traffic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trickbot?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n   - [https://t.co/sU86nZJnh2 - part of ongoing US-based Paypal-themed Trickbot](https://t.co/sU86nZJnh2)\n[#malspam campaign. Powershell Empire traffic seems tied to the NewBCtestDll64](https://twitter.com/hashtag/malspam?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[module (and probably the 32 bit version pic.twitter.com/A5m64aIRd7](https://t.co/A5m64aIRd7)\n\n— Brad (@malware_traffic) [October 10, 2018](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1049898741229064193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThis soon escalated to COBALT-STRIKE connectivity and BLOODHOUND reconnaissance.\n\nIn this observed activity, EMPIRE was used for reconnaissance and privledge escalation and\nCOBALT-STRIKE for delivering further recon via the means of BLOODHOUND - both tools\nattempted credential dumping with MIMIKATZ. The endgame here, is for the adversary to\npriv esc all the way to Domain Admin for full domain compromise to then deliver one of the\nmany ransomware variants such as RYUK [2] 💣💣💣💥💲💲💲.\n\n## RECENT NOTES ON EMPIRE\n\nFor those that do not know, PowerShell EMPIRE is a post exploitation framework written in\nPowerShell. This project has recently retired due to the heighten uptake in PowerShell\nvisibility over the last few years, the project has stated it has reached its goal and has ended\nsupport.\n\nPSA for Empire development: The original objective of the Empire project was to\ndemonstrate the post-exploitation capabilities of PowerShell and bring awareness to\nPowerShell attacks used by (at the time) more advanced adversaries.\n\n[— Chris (@xorrior) July 31, 2019](https://twitter.com/xorrior/status/1156626181107736576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough EMPIRE is now in retirement it is still being used ITW (in-the-wild). It still works, just\nnot supported. I'd expect an uptake on other C2 post exploitation frameworks many such are\n[listed here Remote Access Tools](https://github.com/infosecn1nja/Red-Teaming-Toolkit)\n\n## THE RUNDOWN\n\nA quick series of events will unfold. Some of these are documented here. From EMOTET\ninfection to CS connectity it was less then 48hrs.\n\nDelivery via PHISHING 🎣\n**EMOTET infection and persistence created.**\nPushes TRICKBOT to steal data.\nFollow up EMPIRE C2 connectivity\n-POWERSPLOIT for recon/info-steal\n-MIMIKATZ for credential dumping/priv esc\nFollow up COBALT-STRIKE C2 connectivity\n-BLOODHOUND for domain recon/priv esc\nComplete Domain ownage (?)\nRansomware variant delivery. (?)\nGame Over !\n\nHighlighted was observed activity.\n\n## HELLO POWERSHELL EMPIRE\n\nTo start off we identify the newly established EMPIRE connectivity.\n\nThe initial \"stager\" is the way the victim talks back to the EMPIRE C2 that is listening\nfor the connection to then download stage 2 which is the EMPIRE agent. The default\nlauncher/stager is a PowerShell Base64 encoded/obsfucated command.\n\nBy capturing the PowerShell activity on our box (PowerShell Logging, Command Line audit\nlogging EID 4688), decoding and identifying the EMPIRE stager wasn't too difficult due to the\nfact most if not all the EMPIRE defaults were left the same. CyberChef EMPIRE stager\n[reciped used is available here.](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)Remove_null_bytes()Generic_Code_Beautify()Syntax_highlighter('powershell'))\n\n## EMPIRE Stager\n\nOn decoding this Base64 blob of data, the key items to look for are the default settings for an\nEMPIRE stager as documented in the official EMPIRE Github repo. These defaults are;\n\n\n-----\n\nUser-agent:\n```\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\n\n```\nSession Cookie field:\n```\n\"Cookie\", \"session=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n\n```\nOn of the following URLs:\n```\n/login/process.php\n/admin/get.php\n/admin/news.php\n\n```\nYou can see the decoded result and highlighted fields\n\n[We can see that the values were left as defaults as per Github EMPIRE Repo. For reference,](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/agent/agent.py#L43)\nthe default user agent string and URLs for EMPIRE.\n\n\n-----\n\n## STEP IN POWERSPLOIT\n\nOnce the EMPIRE connection is established we see plenty of follow up POWERSPLOIT\nactivity.\n\nPowerSploit is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that can be used to aid\npenetration testers during all phases of an assessment. PowerSploit is comprised of\nthe following modules: CodeExecution, ScriptModification, Persistence,\nAntivirusBypass, Exfiltration, Mayhem, Privesc, Recon.\n\nSimply put, the threat actor starts profiling or gathering a siutational awareness of their new\nenvironment they have landed in.\n```\nGet-NetComputer | Out-String | %{$_ + \"`n\"};\"`nGet-NetComputer completed!\"\nGet-NetComputer -OperatingSystem *server* | Out-String | %{$_ + \"`n\"};\"`nGetNetComputer completed!\"\nGet-NetDomainTrust | Out-String | %{$_ + \"`n\"};\"`nGet-NetDomainTrust completed!\"\nGet-NetDomainController | Out-String | %{$_ + \"`n\"};\"`nGet-NetDomainController\ncompleted!\"\nInvoke-MapDomainTrust | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation | Out-String | %{$_ +\n\"`n\"};\"`nInvoke-MapDomainTrust completed!\"\n\n```\nFrom the manual - descriptions of each.\n\nGet-NetComputer - gets a list of all current servers in the domain\nGet-NetDomainTrust - gets all trusts for the current user's domain\nGet-NetForestTrust - gets all trusts for the forest associated with the current user's\ndomain\nInvoke-MapDomainTrust - try to build a relational mapping of all domain trusts\nGet-NetDomainController - gets the domain controllers for the current computer's\ndomain\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after followed by an attempted credential dump using POWERSPLOIT s `Invoke-`\n```\nMimikatz -DumpCreds which actually failed in this environment.\n\n```\n\"VirtualAlloc failed to allocate memory for PE. If PE is not ASLR compatible, try running\nthe script in a new PowerShell process (the new PowerShell process will have a\ndifferent memory layout, so the address the PE wants might be free).\"\n\nMIMIKATZ within EMPIRE v2.1.1 20171106 / POWERSPLOIT v2.0 alpha seems problematic\nwith the newer updates of Windows 10. MIMIKATZ at the time of writing is at version v2.2.020190813. These frameworks are using an outdated version. (Cheers DP - REDTEAM\nFRIEND 👍👍)\n\n## STEP IN COBALTSTRIKE AND BLOODHOUND 🐶\n\nA quick background for those not in the know.\n\nCobalt Strike is software for Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations...Cobalt\nStrike gives you a post-exploitation agent and covert channels to emulate a quiet longterm embedded actor in your customer's network.\n\n[https://www.cobaltstrike.com/](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\n\nBloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships\nwithin an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily\nidentify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly\nidentify\n\n[https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)\n\nI was originally suprised about the use of `Invoke-BloodHound at first which is from the`\n[default BLOODHOUND ingester SharpHound - ingester = data gatherer. SharpHound.ps1 -](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/blob/master/Ingestors/SharpHound.ps1)\nRuns the BloodHound C# Ingestor using reflection. With this little Bloodhound 101 first up\nwas the CS stager and connectivity.\n\nThe following code kicks off a COBALT-STRIKE 'beacon stager'. This hosted stager, uses\n[@MrUn1k0d3r's \"DONT KILL MY CAT\" (DKMC) 🙀 which obfuscates the shellcode to avoid](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/DKMC)\ndetection when executed on the endpoint. This DKMC 'template' gives away the use of\nCOBALT-STRIKE.\n\n[URLScan Screenshot](https://urlscan.io/screenshots/14a94c24-0d63-418b-a26c-28dd49c016b6.png)\n\n[Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/6570d631d3371b89971976116ddbda663f734fb60fad6adebc06159c9ad6d3b1/detection)\n\n## DECODING COBALT-STRIKE PAYLOADS\n\nThe URL points to this hosted PowerShell script...\n\n\n-----\n\nBase64 and Gunzip decompress, decodes to a DKMC PowerShell stager with encoded and\nXOR encrypted shellcode.\n\nAnother Base64 decode and XOR decrypt using the hardcoded key 35. CyberChef doing the\nheavy work here.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhich leaves us with a nice COBALT-STRIKE C2 and USER AGENT string.\n```\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;\nTrident/5.0; FunWebProducts\n\n```\n```\n185.147.14[.]242\n\n```\n\nOnce an active connection was made to the infected victim, a follow up series of recon\ncommands were carried out via `Get-NetLoggedon,` `Get-NetComputer | Out-String |`\n```\n%{$_ + \"`n\"};\"`nGet-NetComputer completed!\" and another attempt to dump\n\n```\ncredentials was made with `Invoke-Mimikatz . Lastly we see the domain recon via`\nBLOODHOUND\n```\nSet-Alias Get-BloodHoundData Invoke-BloodHound\nInvoke-BloodHound -Threads 20 -CollectionMethod Default -Throttle 1000 -CSVFolder\n$(Get-Location) | Out-String | %{$_ + \"`n\"};\"`nInvoke-BloodHound completed!\"\nWriting output to CSVs in: C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\netcloud\\\nDone writing output to CSVs in: C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\netcloud\\\n\n```\nThis actually left artefacts on disk � `local_admins.csv,` `group_memberships.csv,`\n```\ntrusts.csv and user_sessions.csv .\n\n```\nShortly after this activity ended (maybe they realised my AD topology wasn't too hot and the\npenny eventually dropped... ) connections were then severed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## OTHER TRICKBOT OBSERVATIONS - ESENTUTL? .EDBs?\n\nOne other thing I noted with this TRICKBOT infection was the use of ESENT UTIL to gather\nIE and Explorer browser history and webcache. The below command was seen;\n```\nesentutl /p /o C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb\n\n```\n\"a centralized meta-data store for the browser using the proven \"JET Blue\" Extensible\nStorage Engine (ESE) database format\"\n\n\"Remember that even if a user never opens Internet Explorer, there may still be\nvaluable records in their IE database including files opened on the local system,\nnetwork shares, and removable devices\"\n\n[https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2015/06/03/ese-databases-are-dirty/](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2015/06/03/ese-databases-are-dirty/)\n\n\"browser history data and while Chrome and Firefox allow copying of the history files,\nthe WebCacheV01.dat file that IE and Edge history are stored in is a locked file and\ncannot be copied using native copy\"\n\n[https://dfironthemountain.wordpress.com/tag/ese-database/](https://dfironthemountain.wordpress.com/tag/ese-database/)\n\nArtefacts on disk will be in the form of a .RAW capture\n```\nC:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\grabber_temp.INTEG.RAW\n\n```\nSnippet from the .RAW log file below. Seems to be validating/repairing the database before\nexfiltrating?\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n   Repair of database C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb started\n[ESENT version 10.00.17763.0000, (ESENT[10.0.17763.0] RETAIL RTM MBCS)]\nsearch for 'ERROR:' to find errors\nsearch for 'WARNING:' to find warnings\nchecking database header\nERROR: database was not shutdown cleanly (Dirty Shutdown)\ndatabase file \"C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb\" is 43515904 bytes\ndatabase file \"C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb\" is 43515904 bytes\non disk.\nCreating 16 threads\n\n```\n[You can download, NIRSOFT ESE Viewer to peak inside the .edb file to see what data has](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/ese_database_view.html)\nbeen staged. In summary, the threat actors are looking for files and locations of interest on\nthe network (?). Maybe profiling if you are a user? or to provide them context and situational\nawareness of the environment they have spawned into and where to pivot next such as file\nservers (?). ESENTUTL and EDB files are one to be aware of and possibly a contender for\nDFIR professionals and 🔵 teams to use also!\n\n## INFOSEC COMMUNITY SIGHTINGS\n\nAs a side note, other previously seen similar activities and ITW sightings courtesy of\n@AltShiftPrtScn 🔽 .\n\n[Found another #powershellempire C2, used in the same](https://twitter.com/hashtag/powershellempire?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#RYUK attack:](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RYUK?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n176.121.14[.]135:443/admin/get[.]php.\n\n[Also I have said it before but will say it again @GCHQ love your CyberChef tool, so](https://twitter.com/GCHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[easy to use (https://t.co/dlvsxhZzXd) thanks!](https://t.co/dlvsxhZzXd) [pic.twitter.com/EwRW1oPGYy](https://t.co/EwRW1oPGYy)\n\n— PeterM (@AltShiftPrtScn) [August 15, 2019](https://twitter.com/AltShiftPrtScn/status/1162031626639106048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Another similar TRICKBOT post-exploitation but using PSEXEC and AdFind to help deploy](https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/index.htm)\nRYUK ransomware to the environment. A Nasty Trick: From Credential Theft Malware to\nBusiness Disruption\n\nAgain, different attack paths, key sightings on TRICKBOT using EMPIRE/POSHC2 to deliver\nthe \"cyber-aids\" 😂\n\nUsually it's FAKEUPDATES -> DRIDEX | TRICKBOT -> EMPIRE -> CYBERAIDS, but\nwhat I just saw was FAKEUPDATES -> DRIDEX -> POSHC2.

Highly recommend not catching the CYBERAIDS.\n\n[— Andrew Thompson (@QW5kcmV3) September 11, 2019](https://twitter.com/QW5kcmV3/status/1171615454718246914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## WRAP UP\n\n\n-----\n\nThe combination of EMOTET s access-as-a-service model and TRICKBOT s offensive set of\nmodular tooling, they pose a real and current threat to businesses large and small. As stated\nbefore, once the infected systems have reported back - the threat actors can be pivoting\nfurther in your environment within (in this instance) <48hrs and start to elevate privledges to\nown the domain to ultimately deliver further badness such as ransomware. Using off the shelf\noffensive tooling such as EMPIRE, COBALTSTRIKE, BLOODHOUND, POWERSPLOIT and\nthe infamous MIMIKATZ, detecting these tools are key in stopping the likes of TRICKBOT\nfrom moving further. Also to note, is the time taken to detect, investigate and remediate.\nDoing this in a timely manner is highly recommended. With the likes of offensive PowerShell\nbecoming easiler to detect its only a matter of time before these TTPs change once more. 🐱\n🐈`🐭🐁\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo avoid the \"cyber-aids\". I recommend;\n\n[As always defense in depth.](https://www.sneakymonkey.net/2018/06/25/blue-team-tips/)\n\nPowershell visibility is still key for detection. (+transcription logging) - ship these off the\nhost ASAP.\nCommandLine Logging - EventID 4688, Sysinternal SYSMON, EDR products.\nActive Directory auditing and logging to capture BLOODHOUND recon on AD objects.\nThis could be incredible noisey depending on the environment but check out \"honey\ntokens\" for fake accounts that should never be queried.\nDetect over the wire Bloodhound via IDS/NSM - large LDAP queries from unexpected\nhosts like clients. Know whats normal first.\nFurther segregation of your network where possible to hinder lateral movement.\n👾 Puple teaming excercises 👾 . Pre-running BLOODHOUND and proactively going\nafter the same fuit of the attackers. Harden and repeat. #PurpleTeaming\nDetect TRICKBOT recon `ipconfig /all,` `net config workstation,` `net view`\n```\n   /all /domain, nltest /domain_trusts, nltest /domain_trusts within a short\n\n```\ntime frame/chained together).\n\n## IOCS\n\n[https://pastebin.com/kS6ZJT1W](https://pastebin.com/kS6ZJT1W)\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] TRICKBOT TA505 GROUP [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/)\n\n[2] North Korean APT(?) and recent Ryuk Ransomware attacks\nhttps://www.kryptoslogic.com/blog/2019/01/north-korean-apt-and-recent-ryuk-ransomwareattacks/\n\n[[3] COBALT-STRIKE https://www cobaltstrike com/](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[4] BLOODHOUND [https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)\n\n[5] POWERSPLOIT [https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)\n\n[6] EMPIRE [https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)\n\n[7] ESENTUTL https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windowsserver-2012-r2-and-2012/hh875603(v%3Dws.11)\n\n[8] LOLBins [https://lolbas-project.github.io/](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)\n\n[9] For the LULZ, research into Attacking Powershell Empire\n[https://sysopfb.github.io/malware/2019/10/05/Attacking-powershell-empire.html](https://sysopfb.github.io/malware/2019/10/05/Attacking-powershell-empire.html)\n\n\n-----",
