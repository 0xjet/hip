The malicious email contains a highly suspicious sample\nwhich triggered the ZLAB team to investigate its capabilities and its possible attribution,\ndiscovering a potential expansion of the TA505 operation. The threat group is also known for\nits recent attack campaign against Bank and Retail business sectors, but the latest evidence\nindicates a potential expansion of its criminal operation to other industries too.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**Hash** 0c88e285b6fc183c96b6f03ca5700cc9ca7c83dfccc6ad14a946d1868d1cc273\n\n**Threat** Dropper\n\n\n**Brief**\n**Description**\n\n\nExcel file with malicious macro\n\n\n**Ssdeep** 3072:Mc38TehYTdeHVhjqabWHLtyeGxml8/dgzxXYhh3vVYwrq\n8/P5HKuPF1+bkm13Kkf:B38TehYTdeHVhjqabWHLty/xml8/dgNr\n\n_Table 1. Information about initial dropper_\n\nThe intercepted attack starts with a spear phishing email embedding a spreadsheet. The\ndocument is weaponized with malicious macro code triggered when the user opens the\ndocument to see the content under the obfuscated view\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. XLS document\nTo understand its capabilities, the macro code has been isolated and analyzed in detail. Part\nof the macro’s content is shown in the following figure.\n\nFigure 2. Part of extracted macro\nSurprisingly, the source code is composed by more than 1600 lines of code and it is highly\nobfuscated. Paying more attention during the code analysis, we discovered that it is full of\njunk instructions used to declare and initialize variables never used, as shown in Figure 2.\nOnly a small portion of this code is actually used to start the infection, the rest is just junk\ncode.\n\nFigure 3. Example of junk instructions used in macro\nOnce the macro is executed, the malware downloads two files from “kentona[.su”, using an\nSSL encrypted communication, and stores them in “C:\\Users\\Public” path: “rtegre.exe” and\n“wprgxyeqd79.exe”.\n\n**Hash** aafa83d5e0619e69e64fcac4626cfb298baac54c7251f479721df1c2eb16bee7\n\n**Threat** Generic\n\n\n**Brief**\n**Description**\n\n\nTrojan/Downloader (Executable file)\n\n\n**Ssdeep** 12288:3gL3qJxG5hfNV6oYYbDRcY4KhbmwPMCchbjBxwhrVm\nHAyzNkyRJK7hRMCQ:3mqkhfzYZY4kmgsbdm2HAENk0K7Dm\n\n_Table 2. Information about “rtegre.exe” downloaded from “kentona[.su”_\n\n**Hash** 6f1a8ee627ec2ed7e1d818d32a34a163416938eb13a97783a71f9b79843a80a2\n\n**Threat** Trojan\n\n\n**Brief**\n**Description**\n\n\nSFX (self-extracting archive) (Executable file)\n\n\n**Ssdeep** 49152:sIWB74MncmEWy4i1LkjoAwG2PI/mfqtftvMKcr+7Ao95\nxQW1vB38PELaacVzWTV3:sICtHsJoMAwG\n\n_Table 3. Information about “wprgxyeqd79.exe” (SFX) downloaded from “kentona[.su”_\n\nFigure 4. Files contained in “wprgxyeqd79.exe” (SFX)\nThe “wprgxyeqd79.exe” sample actually is a Self Extracting Archive (SFX/SFA) containing\nfour files designed to be extracted in the %TEMP% folder. After that, it executes “exit.exe”\nwhich launches the “i.cmd” batch script.\n\nFigure 5. “i.cmd” script contained in “pasmmm.exe”\n\n\n-----\n\nThis new script performs a ping to www[.cloudflare[.com for three times with a delay of\n3000ms, testing the connectivity of the victim machine. If the host is successfully reached,\nthe script renames a file named “kernel.dll”, obviously not the real one, in “uninstall.exe”,\nanother misleading name. Then it invokes the renamed executable and runs it passing a\nseries of parameter: “uninstall.exe x -pQELRatcwbU2EJ5 -y”\n\nThese parameters are needed to self-decrypt the “uninstall.exe” file which is again another\nSFX archive. The “-p” parameter, indeed, specify the password of the archive to be\nextracted. The crucial file, at this point of the infection, is the SFX executable named\n“uninstall.exe”. It has a structure similar to previous “wprgxyeqd79.exe” file: two of their files\nhave the same name, but the content of this new SFX is extracted in the\n_“%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Windows Anytime Upgrade” directory._\n\nFigure 6. Files contained in “uninstall.exe” (SFX)\nAnother time, the execution flow moves from “exit.exe to “i.cmd”. The script is quite different\nfrom the previous one: it guarantees its persistence on the victim machine through the\nsetting of “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” registry key, creating a\nnew entry named “Windows Anytime Upgrade” which points to “winserv.exe”, just stored into\nthe same folder. Thus, the script provides to run “winserv.exe”.\n\nFigure 7. “i.cmd” script contained in “uninstall.exe”\nAn interesting part of the script is the continuous killing of every “rundll32.exe” process\nrunning into the victim machine, generates a huge amount of noise, as visible in the following\nprocess explorer view.\n\n_:Repeat_\n_taskkill /f /im “rundll32.exe” || goto :Repeat_\n\nFigure 8. List of malware’s processes\nAnyway, just before the kill loop, the real malicious payload is executed: the “winserv.exe”\nfile. Analyzing it in depth, we discover it actually is the RMS (Remote Manipulator System)\n[client by TektonIT, encrypted using the MPress PE compressor utility, a legitimate tool, to](https://rmansys.ru/support/news/release_5-0/)\navoid antivirus detection.\n\nFigure 9. Information about MPress packer used in “winserv.exe” payload\nTektonIT RMS acts as a remote administration tool, allowing the attacker to gain complete\naccess to the victim machine. Together with the RMS executable, there is another file named\n_“settings.dat” containing the custom configuration prepared by the attacker. It contains_\ninformation like:\n\nServer address and port the client will connect to\nThe password chosen by the attacker for the remote access\nThe ID associated to the victim client\n\n\n-----\n\nAll these information are automatically loaded by the RMS executable and firstly stored in the\nregistry key “HKCU\\Software\\tektonik\\Remote MANIPULATOR System\\Host\\parameters”. At\nthe next startup, the software will directly load the configuration from the just created key.\n\nFigure 10. Registry key set by “winserv.exe” (on the left); “settings.dat” file (on the right)\nThe client establishes a new connection with the remote command and control server hosted\non a Bulgarian remote host 217.12.201.159, part of a Virtual Dedicated Server subnet of the\nAS-21100, operated by ITL LLC.\n\nFigure 11. C2’s parameters\nThe attack is composed by a complex flow we synthesize in the following scheme:\n\nFigure 12. Complete infection chain\n\n### The TA505 Connection\n\nAfter the reconstruction of the full infection chain, we noticed strong similarities with a recent\nspear-phishing attack campaign against an unspecified US retail company. The attack, as\nstated by [CyberInt, leveraged a command and control server located in Germany related to](https://e.cyberint.com/hubfs/Report%20Legit%20Remote%20Access%20Tools%20Turn%20Into%20Threat%20Actors%20Tools/CyberInt_Legit%20Remote%20Access%20Tools%20Turn%20Into%20Threat%20Actors%27%20Tools_Report.pdf)\nthe TA505 actor: a very active group involved in cyber-criminal operation all around the\nworld, threatening a wide range of high profile companies, active since 2014.\n\nFigure 13. Comparison between infection chains\nThe comparison of the infection chains reveals in both cases the attacker used a couple of\nSFX stages to deploy the “RMS” software: a legitimate remote administration tool produced\nby the Russian company “TektonIT”. The tool is able to grant remote access and full, direct\ncontrol of the infected machine to the group. Also, some code pieces are directly re-used in\nthe analyzed campaigns, such as the “i.cmd” and “exit.exe” files, and, at the same time,\nsome new components have been introduced, for instance the “rtegre.exe” and the\n_“veter1605_MAPS_10cr0.exe” file._\n\nDuring the analysis, we also noticed the “veter1605_MAPS_10cr0.exe” file slightly changed\nrun after run, a few hours after the initial discovery the infection chain dropped it with\ndifferent icons, different suffix, from “cr0” to “cr24”, and appendix from “veter1605_” to\n“veter2005_”. This may indicate the campaign is still ongoing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe TA505 group is one of the most active threat groups operating since 2014, it has\ntraditionally targeted Banking and Retail industries, as we recently documented during the\n[analysis of the “Stealthy Email Stealer” part of their arsenal. The peculiarity of this recent](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/the-stealthy-email-stealer-in-the-ta505-arsenal/)\nattack wave is it actually hit a company not strictly in the Banking or Retail sector, as they\nrecently did, suggesting the threat group could be potentially widening their current\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nDropurl:\n\nkentona[.su - 47.245.58.124\nhxxps://kentona[.su/xpepriubgpokejifuv7efrhguskdgfjn/ananas.exe\nhxxps://kentona[.su/xpepriubgpokejifuv7efrhguskdgfjn/pasmmm.exe\nC2:\n\n217[.12.201.159\nPersistence:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nHash:\n\n0c88e285b6fc183c96b6f03ca5700cc9ca7c83dfccc6ad14a946d1868d1cc273\n1ee1ba514212f11a69d002005dfc623b1871cc808f18ddfa2191102bbb9f623b\nfd701894e7ec8d8319bc9b32bba5892b11bdf608c3d04c2f18eff83419eb6df0\nc69ce39ac3e178a89076136af7418c6cb664844b0ce5cb643912ed56c373a08a\n5310c2397ba4c783f7ee9724711a6da9b5c603b5c9781fff3407b46725e338b3\naafa83d5e0619e69e64fcac4626cfb298baac54c7251f479721df1c2eb16bee7\n210bb55664d291d82b94b9cea6fcf41029eded9eca6e7fe7b7d58715407a0703\n2b5eefc4bc2d34cbe5093332c47b5405cf5c32e8156767fc8bc9ddd9cdcf3018\n609b0a416f9b16a6df9b967dc32cd739402af31566e019a8fb8abdf3cb573e30\n6f1a8ee627ec2ed7e1d818d32a34a163416938eb13a97783a71f9b79843a80a2\n\n### Yara Rules\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule excel_dropper {\nmeta:\n  description = \"Yara rule for excel dropper\"\n  author = \"Cybaze - Yoroi ZLab\"\n  last_updated = \"2019-05-22\"\n  tlp = \"white\"\n  category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n  $a1 = { 98 C3 AB F0 E7 F3 BD F4 }\n  $a2 = { 41 6E D5 7E F0 10 AB A7 }\n  $a3 = \"gxbgarjktzyu\"\n  $a4 = \"Bob Brown\"\ncondition:\n  all of them\n}\nimport \"pe\"\nrule pasmmm_exe {\nmeta:\n  description = \"Yara rule for pasmmm SFX archive\"\n  author = \"Cybaze - Yoroi ZLab\"\n  last_updated = \"2019-05-22\"\n  tlp = \"white\"\n  category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n  $a1 = { 1C Cf 43 39 C8 32 B4 B0 }\n  $a2 = { 60 6C B8 7C 5F FA }\n  $a3 = \"LookupPrivilege\"\n  $a4 = \"LoadBitmap\"\ncondition:\n  pe.number_of_sections == 6 and all of them\n}\nimport \"pe\"\nrule uninstall_exe {\nmeta:\n  description = \"Yara rule for uninstall SFX archive\"\n  author = \"Cybaze - Yoroi ZLab\"\n  last_updated = \"2019-05-22\"\n  tlp = \"white\"\n  category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n  $a1 = { E8 68 BA 01 00 51 }\n  $a2 = { 58 E9 8B C6 4F 6F 7A }\n  $a3 = { D9 4E D5 FA D4 34 }\ncondition:\n  pe.number_of_resources == 24 and all of them\n}\nimport \"pe\"\nrule winserv_exe {\nmeta:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  description Yara rule for winserv backdoor \n  author = \"Cybaze - Yoroi ZLab\"\n  last_updated = \"2019-05-22\"\n  tlp = \"white\"\n  category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n  $a1 = \"MPRESS1\"\n  $a2 = { 90 C4 73 05 E6 92 }\n  $a3 = { E9 64 4B 56 3F EC }\n  $a4 = { 10 EF D0 E1 36 E1 14 3C }\ncondition:\n  all of them and pe.version_info[\"CompanyName\"] contains \"tox\"\n}\nimport \"pe\"\nrule veter_random {\nmeta:\n  description = \"Yara rule for veter_trojan\"\n  author = \"Cybaze - Yoroi ZLab\"\n  last_updated = \"2019-05-22\"\n  tlp = \"white\"\n  category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n  $a = { 5E C2 04 00 F6 44 24 04 01 56 }\n  $b1 = { 01 8B 02 8B 48 04 03}\n  $b2 = { 4A 3B C2 7E 08 8B C2 }\n  $c1 = { E8 83 CA 04 89 55 E8 }\n  $c2 = { 1F DF 70 07 22 84 82 }\ncondition:\n  $a and (($b1 and $b2 and pe.version_info[\"CompanyName\"] contains \"Miranda\") or\n($c1 and $c2 and pe.version_info[\"InternalName\"] contains \"DrldwgRom\"))\n}\n\n```\n_This blog post was authored by Davide Testa, Antonio Farina and Luca Mella of Cybaze-_\n_Yoroi Z-LAB_\n\n\n-----",
