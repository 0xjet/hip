We have previously written about**\n\n**related activity [2][3] in which a particular China-based attack group used PlugX and**\n\n**NetTraveler Trojans for espionage in Europe, Russia, Mongolia, Belarus, and other**\n**neighboring countries. Most recently, we have observed the same group targeting military and**\n\n**aerospace interests in Russia and Belarus. Since the summer of 2016, this group began using**\n\n**a new downloader known as ZeroT to install the PlugX remote access Trojan (RAT) and added**\n**Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.chm) as one of the initial droppers delivered in spear-**\n\n**phishing emails.**\n\n**This blog details the function of the new malware, provides delivery details for elements of the**\n\n**APT activity, and describes additional changes in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)**\n\n**associated with this group.**\n\n**Delivery**\n\n**In previous campaigns, the group used spear-phishing emails with Microsoft Word document**\n\n**attachments utilizing CVE-2012-0158, or URLs linking to RAR-compressed executables.**\n\n**Although some of these patterns of behavior still continue, in June 2016 we observed the**\n**attackers using a new type of dropper to deliver a previously unknown malware we named**\n\n**\"ZeroT\". Specifically, the CHM file 20160621.chm (SHA256:�**\n\n**4ef91c17b1415609a2394d2c6c353318a2503900e400aab25ab96c9fe7dc92ff) dropped the**\n\n**first known sample of ZeroT �**\n\n\n-----\n\n**and may consist of HTML pages and other compressed files. This particular CHM contained�**\n\n**an HTM file and an executable file. The HTM file contained the text displayed to the user and�**\n\n**referenced the executable svchost.exe (SHA256:**\n**d1c4a51064aeec4c11a8f90f80a3b60a36c07cce2dde0756c114e477d63ce375). Thus, opening**\n\n**the CHM has the effect of running the executable (the UAC dialog is shown in Figure 1).**\n\n**_Figure 1: The dropper file 20160621.chm with a Russian-language lure pretends to be from�_**\n\n**_the “Defense Industry of Russia in the 21st Century”; user must accept the UAC warning_**\n\n**_before malware executes.​​​_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Listing of the files in the CHM file and their partial contents�_**\n\n**Attackers also continued to send spear-phishing emails with Microsoft Word attachments**\n\n**utilizing CVE-2012-0158 to exploit the client. These documents were built with MNKit,**\n\n**described in detail here [6][7]. For example, the email with subject “Федеральная целевая**\n\n**программа 2017-2020 гг.” (translated from Russian: “Federal Target Program 2017-2020 gg.”)**\n\n**contained an attachment “2017-2020.doc” and was sent to a potential victim in an aerospace**\n\n**company in December 2016.**\n\n**_Figure 3: Email sent to potential victim in aerospace company contained a MNKit-generated_**\n\n**_CVE-2012-0158 exploit document_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**extracting executables) of ZeroT; example names are listed in the table below.

This executable contains a PDB path**\n**indicating its purpose of bypassing UAC (Fig. 4).**\n\n**_Figure 4: PDB path containing Chinese characters translating to “Desktop”_**\n\n**This executable is obfuscated using the same technique that is reused in the sideload DLL**\n**and the ZeroT payload (described later). When run, Go.exe modifies the registry key shown in�**\n**Figure 5 to perform the UAC bypass by exploiting Event Viewer [1].**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_eventvwr.exe_**\n\n**It then executes eventvwr.exe which proceeds to execute Zlh.exe using the UAC bypass**\n**vulnerability (Fig. 6).**\n\n**_Figure 6: Zlh.exe is executed via the eventvwr.exe UAC bypass vulnerability_**\n\n**[Zlh.exe is a legitimate, signed Norman Safeground AS application, which is used to sideload a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Safeground)**\n**malicious nflogger.dll DLL.The encrypted ZeroT payload is usually named NO.2.mui. The�**\n\n**sideloaded DLL does not always use the same vulnerable executable, but it is always similar**\n**in functionality. Usually the DLL is not packed, but we have observed instances compressed**\n**[by UPX. This malicious DLL is usually obfuscated with the same junk code: dummy API calls](https://upx.github.io/)**\n\n**inserted in between real instructions (Fig. 7). The same obfuscation can be found in multiple**\n**functions in ZeroT itself.**\n\n**_Figure 7: Dummy API calls for obfuscation_**\n\n**This DLL has no other noticeable characteristics, as it functions like a typical malicious**\n**sideload. After loading the encrypted payload in memory, it transfers the execution to a**\n\n**shellcode that is located at the beginning of the file. Even if the process is similar for the PlugX�**\n**RAT sideloaded later, the shellcode and obfuscation have nothing in common. Once loaded in**\n\n**memory, the ZeroT shellcode does not present any kind of obfuscation, unlike that for PlugX.**\n**This shellcode is charged with unpacking the encrypted and compressed payload. As in the**\n\n**new PlugX dropper detailed below this is done using RC4 and RtlDecompressBuffer As in**\n\n\n-----\n\n**“PE” constants (Fig. 8). On some PlugX versions, either “GULP” or “XV” are common as tags**\n\n**replacing the “MZ” constant.**\n\n**_Figure 8 : Altered ZeroT PE Header_**\n\n**ZeroT Command and Control Protocol**\n\n**ZeroT communicates with its command and control (C&C) over HTTP. A fake User-Agent is**\n\n**used in all the requests made by this malware: “Mozilla/6.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows**\n\n**_NT 6.2; Tzcdrnt/6.0)”, with “Tzcdrnt” possibly being a typo of “Trident.” In all the samples we_**\n**observed, ZeroT first beacons to �index.php expecting an RC4-encrypted response using a**\n\n**static key: “(*^GF(9042&*” (Fig. 9).**\n\n**_Figure 9: ZeroT initial beacon over HTTP requesting URL configuration�_**\n\n**In the decrypted initial server response (Fig. 10,11), ZeroT expects several URLs including a**\n**location to POST system information prefixed with “w:” and a download location for any stage�**\n\n**2 payloads denoted with an “r:” prefix.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10: Decrypted tassnews[.]net index.php response containing several URLs_**\n\n**Next, ZeroT uses HTTP POST beacons to transmit information about the infected system to**\n**the C&C. The first beacon contains the following data: “�Cn=%s&La=%s&” where Cn is the**\n\n**computername and La is the local IP address (Fig. 11). While the first beacon is transmitted in�**\n\n**cleartext it is probable that this behavior was unintentional as subsequent POST beacons in**\n\n**the loop are encrypted. The first POST beacon is followed by another in the following format�**\n**(Fig. 11,12):**\n\n**“Lg=%d&Pv=%d&Bu=%%s&Cn=%s&Cu=%s&Dn=%s&Ki=%s&La=%s&Me=%s&Os=%s&Ov=**\n\n**_%s&Pt=%s&Fl=%%d” that is RC4-encrypted with the following key: “s2-18rg1-41g3j_.;”. This_**\n\n**POST sends basic fingerprinting data including computer name, system language, domain�**\n**information and Windows versioning.**\n\n**Figure 11: Initial plaintext POST beacon**\n\n**Figure 12: RC4-encrypted POST beacon**\n\n**The final piece of ZeroT’s C&C protocol is to retrieve any stage-2 payloads. In the initial�**\n\n**samples of ZeroT, the tassnews[.]net C&C was used to distribute plain, non-encoded PE**\n\n**payloads (Fig. 13). Although we were not able to retrieve all the payloads that may have**\n**existed at this C&C, the ones we did observe were RAR SFX archives used to deliver PlugX.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 13: ZeroT downloading non-encoded PlugX Stage 2**\n\n**The ZeroT samples communicating to versig[.]net functioned differently from samples using**\n\n**tassnews[.]net where Bitmap (BMP) [8] URLs (Figure 14) were provided as a stage 2 payload**\n**instead of EXEs (Fig. 14).**\n\n**_Figure 14: Decrypted versig[.]net index.php response with F.bmp stage 2_**\n\n**The BMPs used for stage 2 in all the instances we analyzed looked like normal images (Fig.**\n\n**15, 16) which indicated a form of steganography is being used that minimizes changes to the**\n\n**appearance of the image.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Analysis of the F.bmp image revealed that it is indeed using Least Significant Bit (LSB)�_**\n\n**Steganography [9,10], a commonly used form of steganography that embeds data in an image**\n**without significantly affecting its appearance.�**\n\n**Analysis of ZeroT’s Bitmap LSB Steganography**\n\n**ZeroT uses a single, large function for the custom LSB algorithm that occurs as the first�**\n**function in the samples we analyzed. It may selectively choose to extract one, two, three, or**\n\n**four bits per pixel byte depending on the size of the embedded payload and the image being**\n\n**used, meaning it is capable of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-bit LSB (Fig. 16).**\n\n**_Figure 16: Diagram depicting portions of ZeroT’s LSB steganography algorithm_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Bitmap is assumed while calculating the size of memory needed (3*Width*Height) to store all**\n\n**the pixels in the image, which is allocated using malloc. Next, because Bitmaps are padded to**\n**32-bit boundaries, ZeroT will check to see if any padding exists by AND’ing 3*Width. If that**\n\n**value is not zero, then it is subtracted from four which is then used as the padding.**\n\n**The following step in the algorithm is to assemble the bitmap row by row. Technically what**\n\n**occurs is as follows: iteratively 3*Width bytes, beginning at the hardcoded offset of 54, are**\n**copied to the end of the previously allocated memory (malloc’d 3*Width*Height). Padding is**\n\n**then skipped, if any exists, followed by the next 3*Width bytes until all rows of pixels are**\n\n**copied.**\n\n**Next, starting at offset 10 of the assembled bitmap, ZeroT extracts a 32-bit value from 32-**\n\n**bytes using 1-bit LSB that is used to indicate the size of the embedded stage 2 payload. The**\n\n**stage 2 file extension is then extracted starting at offset nine and working its way backwards�**\n\n**until a period is found (e.g., “.exe”).**\n\n**Finally, ZeroT checks various values such as the image length against the needed bits to**\n\n**complete the length of the extracted payload [8*len(extracted payload)]. Depending on the**\n\n**result, ZeroT will decide to use 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-bit LSB. Lastly, once each bit is extracted, all the**\n\n**bits will be compiled into bytes to form the extracted stage 2 payload.**\n\n**Stage 2 Payloads**\n\n**Until the end of 2016, PlugX payloads were delivered as RAR SFX archives and used one of**\n\n**the usual sideload executables such as fsguidll.exe. ZeroT sets up the persistence for these**\n**samples, adding a new service to run PlugX during system startup (Fig 17).**\n\n**_Figure 17: ZeroT configures PlugX service to run during startup�_**\n\n**Of interest, a recent ZeroT sample (SHA256:**\n\n**a9519d2624a842d2c9060b64bb78ee1c400fea9e43d4436371a67cbf90e611b8) downloaded a**\n\n**much smaller BMP payload (SHA256:**\n**25de9c3f7bf1f0be7eb84cf90efb643d5d51ce1742da8bcc4c7db0eec79a221f). This was an**\n\n**example where the stage 2 payload was distributed using a custom dropper instead of RAR**\n\n**SFX Thi d** **l** **d th** **(Fi** **18) d** **t th** **i** **th** **MD5 h** **h** **f**\n\n\n-----\n\n**implementation) and decompresses it with LZNT1 via the RtlDecompressBuffer API. There are**\n\n**three Resource items contained in the payload that would eventually decrypt to: “fsguidll.exe”,**\n\n**“fslapi.dll”, and “flsapi.dll.gui�.” Unfortunately, when the payload extracted from the BMP is**\n\n**executed, no command line argument is provided so none of the resources are properly**\n**decrypted and decompressed. Based on the file names and size of fslapi.dll.gui, it is very likely�**\n\n**that PlugX is the intended stage 2 payload.**\n\n**_Figure 18: Resources loaded by the custom dropper_**\n\n**Finally, in all other cases where a stage 2 payload was successfully retrieved, PlugX was**\n**delivered. None of the PlugX samples that we analyzed were issued from new builders**\n\n**(internal version 20141028), and therefore they do not present any kind of new techniques.**\n**The extracted PlugX configurations are provided in Appendices A and B [11].�**\n\n**Infrastructure Links**\n\n**In addition to their similar TTPs, ZeroT infrastructure has been continuously shared with**\n**NetTraveler and both malware families share the same C&C domains.**\n\n\n\n**•**\n\n**•**\n\n**•**\n\n\n**The C&C domain www.tassnews[.]net was used by initial samples of ZeroT in June 2016.**\n**It was concurrently used by NetTraveler (example SHA256:**\n\n**b43cbc905088c08ee3b71b6e053f91f2c79d71556462eae1c13f1cc8eb5bec72) as well as**\n**long prior [3]**\n\n**The C&C domain www.riaru[.]net was observed used by at least one sample of ZeroT**\n**(SHA256: fc2d47d91ad8517a4a974c4570b346b41646fac333d219d2f1282c96b4571478).**\n**This domain was previously tied to NetTraveler as well [3]**\n\n**The C&C domain www.versig[.]net is used by many samples of ZeroT from September**\n**2016 to January 2017.
