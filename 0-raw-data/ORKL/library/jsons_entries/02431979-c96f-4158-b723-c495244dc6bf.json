Notable\n[examples include the UEFI bootkit used as part of the FinSpy surveillance toolset that we reported on,](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)\n[the work of our colleagues from ESET on the ESPectre bootkit, and a little-known threat activity that was](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/10/05/uefi-threats-moving-esp-introducing-especter-bootkit/)\ndiscovered within government organisations in the Middle East, using a UEFI bootkit of its own (briefly\n[mentioned in our APT trends report Q3 2021 and covered in more detail in a private APT report](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2021/104708/)\ndelivered to customers of our Threat Intelligence Portal).\n\nThe common denominator of those three cases is the fact that the UEFI components targeted for\ninfection reside on the ESP (EFI System Partition), a storage space designated for some UEFI\ncomponents, typically based in the computer’s hard drive or SSD. The most notable elements of the ESP\nare the Boot Manager and OS loader, both invoked during the machine’s boot sequence and which also\nhappen to be the subject of tampering in the case of the aforementioned bootkits.\n\nWhile all of the above were seen in use by advanced actors, a different class of bootkits raises even higher\nconcern. This one is made up of implants found in the UEFI firmware within the SPI flash, a non-volatile\nstorage external to the hard drive. Such bootkits are not only stealthier (partially because of limited\nvisibility by security products into this hardware component), but also more difficult to mitigate: flashing\na clean firmware image in place of a malicious one can prove to be more difficult than formatting a hard\ndrive and reinstalling an OS, which would typically eliminate ESP level threats.\n\nMoonBounce is notable for being the third publicly revealed case of an implant from the latter class of\n[firmware-based rootkits. Previous cases included LoJax and MosaicRegressor, which we reported on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/)\nduring October 2020. In that sense, MoonBounce marks a particular evolution in this group of threats by\npresenting a more complicated attack flow in comparison to its predecessors and a higher level of\ntechnical competence by its authors, who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the finer details\ninvolved in the UEFI boot process.\n\n## Our discovery: a sophisticated implant within UEFI firmware\n\nThe UEFI implant, which was detected in spring 2021, was found to have been incorporated by the\nattackers into the CORE_DXE component of the firmware (also known as the DXE Foundation), which\nis called early on at the DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase of the UEFI boot sequence. Among\nother things, this component is responsible for initializing essential data structures and function\ninterfaces, one of which is the EFI Boot Services Table – a set of pointers to routines that are part of the\nCORE_DXE image itself and are callable by other DXE drivers in the boot chain.\n\nThe source of the infection starts with a set of hooks that intercept the execution of several functions in\nthe EFI Boot Services Table, namely AllocatePool, CreateEventEx and ExitBootServices. Those hooks are\nused to divert the flow of these functions to malicious shellcode that is appended by the attackers to the\nCORE_DXE image, which in turn sets up additional hooks in subsequent components of the boot chain,\nnamely the Windows loader.\n\nThis multistage chain of hooks facilitates the propagation of malicious code from the CORE_DXE image\nto other boot components during system startup, allowing the introduction of a malicious driver to the\nmemory address space of the Windows kernel. This driver, which runs during the initial phases of the\nkernel’s execution, is in charge of deploying user-mode malware by injecting it into an svchost.exe\nprocess, once the operating system is up and running. Finally, the user mode malware reaches out to a\nhardcoded C&C URL (i.e. hxxp://mb.glbaitech[.]com/mboard.dll) and attempts to fetch another stage of\nthe payload to run in memory, which we were not able to retrieve.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe diagram below contains the outline of the stages taken from the moment the hooked Boot Services\nare called in the context of the DXE Foundation’s execution until the user-mode malware is deployed\nand run during the Operating System’s execution. The full description of each step in the diagram, along\nwith the analysis of both the MoonBounce driver and user-mode malware can be found in the technical\ndocument released alongside this report.\n\n**_Flow of MoonBounce execution from boot sequence to malware deployment in user_**\n**_space_**\n\nNote that at the time of writing we lack sufficient evidence to retrace how the UEFI firmware was\ninfected in the first place. The infection itself, however, is assumed to have occurred remotely. While\nprevious UEFI firmware compromises (i.e. LoJax and MosaicRegressor) manifested as additions of DXE\ndrivers to the overall firmware image on the SPI flash, the current case exhibits a much more subtle and\nstealthy technique where an existing firmware component is modified to alter its behaviour. Notably,\nparticular functions were modified with an inline hook, meaning the replacement of the function\nprologue with an instruction to divert execution to a function chosen by the attacker. This form of binary\ninstrumentation typically requires the attacker to obtain the original image, then parse and change it to\nintroduce malicious logic. This would be possible for an attacker having ongoing and remote access to\nthe targeted machine.\n\n## Other pieces of malware on the radar\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to MoonBounce, we found infections across multiple nodes in the same network by a known\nuser-mode malware dubbed ScrambleCross, also known as SideWalk. This is an in-memory implant,\nimplemented as position-independent code, that can communicate to a C2 server in order to exchange\ninformation and stage the execution of additional plugins in memory, of which none has been sighted in\n[the wild yet. This malware was thoroughly covered by our colleagues at Trend Micro and ESET, so we](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/earth-baku-returns?utm_source=trendmicroresearch&utm_medium=smk&utm_campaign=0821_EarthBaku1)\nwill refer the reader to their excellent write-ups to understand its internals better.\n\nThe position-independent code constituting ScrambleCross can be loaded in one of two ways, the first\nbeing a C++ DLL named StealthVector. It obtains the ScrambleCross shellcode by applying a modified\nChaCha20 algorithm on an encrypted blob, which may reside as an additional file on disk or be\nembedded in the loader itself. We detected both variants of this loader in the network in question.\n\nStealthVector gets loaded through the introduction of a modified benign system DLL, in which the\nimport address table is patched to append the malware’s DLL as a dependency. In one case, we observed\nsuch altered wbemcomn.dll (MD5: C3B153347AED27435A18E789D8B67E0A) file, which originally\nfacilitates the functionality of WMI in Windows and was located in the directory %SYSTEM%\\wbem. As\na consequence, when the WMI service was initiated, the rogue version of this DLL forced the loading of a\nStealthVector image named wmiwk.dll.\n\n**_Appended IAT entry to a rogue wbemcomn.dll file which forces the loading of_**\n**_StealthVector upon initiation of the WMI service_**\n\nThe table below specifies all instances of StealthVector that we detected in the targeted network, along\nwith timestamp artefacts that might point to the date of their creation.\n\n\n**Loader**\n**Filename**\n\n\n**Loader MD5** **Shellcode**\n**Filename**\n\n\n**C&C Address** **Compilation**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\nwbwkem.dll 4D5EB9F6F501B4F6EDF981A3C6C4D6FA compwm.bin dev.kinopoisksu[.]com Friday,\n12.06.2020\n08:25:02\nUTC\n\nwkbem.dll E7155C355C90DC113476DDCF765B187D pcomnl.bin Unknown Tuesday,\n24.03.2020\n09:09:21\nUTC\n\n\n-----\n\nwmiwk.dll 899608DE6B59C63B4AE219C3C13502F5 wmipl.dll ns.glbaitech[.]com Saturday,\n20.02.2021\n06:45:18\nUTC\n\nc_20344.nls 4EF90CEEF2CC9FF3121B34A9891BB28D – 217.69.10[.]104 Tuesday,\n24.03.2020\n09:09:21\nUTC\n\nc_20334.nls CFF2772C44F6F86661AB0A4FFBF86833 – st.kinopoisksu[.]com Tuesday,\n24.03.2020\n09:09:21\nUTC\n\nAnother loader that we detected and is commonly used to load ScrambleCross is .NET based, referred to\nas StealthMutant. It works by decrypting a shellcode BLOB with AES-256 and injecting it to the address\nspace of another process, using the process-hollowing technique. The injected process in every case we\nobserved was msdt.exe (Microsoft Diagnostic Troubleshooting Wizard).\n\nStealthMutant is launched in one of two ways, which were partially described in other reports as well.\nThe first way is by executing a launcher utility with the filename System.Mail.Service.dll (MD5:\n5F9020983A61446A77AF1976247C443D) through the command line as a service. This is outlined in the\nfollowing commands typed by the attackers on one of the compromised systems:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\nnet start \"iscsiwmi\"\n\nsc stop iscsiwmi\n\nsc delete iscsiwmi\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost\" /v \"iscsiwmi\" /t\nREG_MULTI_SZ /d \"iscsiwmi\" /f\n\nsc create \"iscsiwmi\" binPath= \"$system32\\svchost.exe -k iscsiwmi\" type= share start= auto\nerror= ignore DisplayName= \"iscsiwmi\"\n\nSC failure \"iscsiwmi\" reset= 86400 actions= restart/60000/restart/60000/restart/60000\n\nsc description \"iscsiwmi\" \"\"iSCSI WMI Classes That Manage Initiators, Ports, Sessions and\nConnections\"\"\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\iscsiwmi\\Parameters\" /f\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\iscsiwmi\\Parameters\" /v \"ServiceDll\" /t\nREG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"$windir\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\System.Mail.Service.dll\"\n/f\n\nnet start \"iscsiwmi\"\n\n\nThe launching utility in turn uses the .NET InstallUtil.exe application in order to execute the\nStealthMutant image, which has the filename Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets, and providing it with the\nencrypted ScrambleCross shellcode as an argument from a file named MstUtil.exe.config. The utility\nitself is a basic C++ program that achieves the aforementioned goal by issuing the following command\nline using the WinExec API:\n\n\n-----\n\n1 C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false\n/ConfigFile=MstUtil.exe.config /U\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\n\nThe second way to execute StealthMutant is through the creation of a scheduled task via a Windows\nbatch script file named schtask.bat, as outlined below:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n@echo off\n\ncd /d \"%~dp0\"\n\ncopy /Y Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\n\"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\"\n\ncopy /Y MstUtil.exe.config\n\"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\MstUtil.exe.config\"\n\nschtasks /create /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UNP\\UNPRefreshListTask\" /SC ONSTART /TR\n\"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false\n/ConfigFile=MstUtil.exe.config /U\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Service.Watch.targets\" /F /DELAY\n0000:02 /RU SYSTEM /RL HIGHEST\n\nschtasks /run /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UNP\\UNPRefreshListTask\"\n\n\nThe following table lists known StealthMutant loader IOCs, together with their corresponding\nScrambleCross shellcode files and contacted C2 addresses. It’s worth noting that most of the\nScrambleCross shellcodes (loaded by both StealthMutant and StealthVector) reached out to the same\nserver (i.e. ns.glbaitech[.]com) and that StealthMutant was observed in this campaign only from\nFebruary, 2021.\n\n**Loader MD5** **C&C Address** **Compilation Timestamp**\n\n0603C8AAECBDC523CBD3495E93AFB20C 92.38.178[.]246 Tuesday, 23.03.2021 08:00:44\nUTC\nns.glbaitech[.]com\n\n8C7598061D1E8741B8389A80BFD8B8F5 ns.glbaitech[.]com Saturday, 20.02.2021 03:27:42\nUTC\n\nF9F9D6FB3CB94B1CDF9E437141B59E16 ns.glbaitech[.]com Wednesday, 08.12.2021 07:07:28\nUTC\n\nIn addition to the above components, we found other stagers and post-exploitation malware implants\nduring our research, some of which were attributed to or have been used by known Chinese-speaking\nthreat actors:\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Microcin: a backdoor typically used by the SixLittleMonkeys threat actor, which we have been](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07170759/Microcin_Technical_4PDF_eng_final_s.pdf)**\ntracking since 2016. It is worth noting that since its inception, the SixLittleMonkeys group has\nbeen using Microcin against various targets, partly against high-profile entities based in Russia and\nCentral Asia.\n\nThe implants we observed in this campaign are shipped as DLLs that ought to run in the context of\nexe, with the primary intent of reading a C2 address from an encrypted configuration file stored in\n%WINDIR%\\debug\\netlogon.cfg and reaching out to the server to obtain a further payload.\nInterestingly, the Trojan holds a scheduling algorithm that would skip any work on Saturdays,\nchecking the local time every hour to determine if Saturday has passed.\n**[Mimikat_ssp: a publicly available post-exploitation tool used to dump credentials and security](https://github.com/jas502n/mimikat_ssp)**\n[secrets from exe, also used widely by various Chinese-speaking actors (e.g. GhostEmperor, which](https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/)\nwe reported on).\n**Go implant: a formerly unknown backdoor used to contact a C2 server using a RESTful API,**\nwhere a combination of a hardcoded IP address and a hypermedia directory path on the underlying\nserver are used for information exchange. Both the IP and the server directory path are encrypted\nwith AES-128 using a base64 encoded key stored in the backdoor’s image. The IP and directory\npath tuple are used during execution for:\n\nInitialising communications with the server;\nSending information from the infected host;\nRequesting a specific server path containing a command for execution and downloading it;\nSending back the result of the command’s execution to the C2 server.\nThe commands retrieved from the server are also encrypted with AES-128, with the key stored in\nthe command’s file itself. Command execution results are then encrypted using the same key. We\nfound the following list of supported commands:\n\nGet list of drives;\nGet content list from a specified directory;\nDownload a file from the C2 server;\nWrite text to a given *.bat file and execute it;\nRun a shell command.\n\nIt is important to note that we could not conclusively tie most of those additional pieces of malware to\nthe intrusion set related to MoonBounce, with the exception of Microcin, where some timeline artefacts\ncoincide with other events related to ScrambleCross, as outlined in the figure below. This suggests a lowconfidence connection between Microcin and MoonBounce and may indicate usage of shared resources\nbetween SixLittleMonkeys and APT41 or involvement of the former’s operators in the MoonBounce\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Timeline of events related to artefacts found in the network containing the MoonBounce-_**\n**_infected machine_**\n\n## Who were the targets?\n\nCurrently, our detections indicate a very targeted nature of the attack – the presence of the firmware\nrootkit was detected in a single case. Other affiliated malicious samples (e.g. ScrambleCross and its\nloaders) were found on multiple other machines in the same network range. In addition, we found\nseveral other victims of an undetermined nature with the same versions of ScrambleCross reaching out\nto the same command and control infrastructure. One particular target corresponds to an organization\nin control of several enterprises dealing with transport technology.\n\n## What were the attackers trying to achieve?\n\nWe traced some of the commands executed by the attackers after gaining a foothold in the network,\nwhich point to lateral movement and exfiltration of information from particular machines. This aligns in\nprofile with some of the previous operations by APT41, wherein intrusions were typically made to\nintervene in the targeted companies’ supply chain, or to heist sensitive intellectual property and\npersonally identifiable information. The usage of the UEFI implant in particular indicates the actor’s aim\nto establish a longstanding foothold within the network, as would be expected in an ongoing espionage\nactivity.\n\nThe following are examples of command lines that portray some of the methods and actions taken by the\noperators of this threat activity to achieve their goals:\n\n\n-----\n\nAttempts to enumerate hosts and gather network information:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & whoami\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net view\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & -setcp 866\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net view\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & netstat -ano\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\ /od\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & arp -a\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & tasklist\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & tracert <redacted_internal_ip>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net use \\\\<redacted_internal_ip> /u:<redacted_username>\n<redacted_password>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net view \\\\<redacted_internal_ip>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & ping -n 1 -a <redacted_internal_ip>\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & net use * /d /y\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & systeminfo\"\n\n\nCopying of files across SMB shares, followed by an attempt to dump the Active Directory domain\ndatabase (tid):\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & echo ntdsutil \\\"ac i ntds\\\" \\\"ifm\\\" \\\"create full $temp\\1\\\\\\\" q q >$temp\\a.bat\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & type $temp\\a.bat\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & move $temp\\a.bat \\\\<redacted_internal_ip>\\c$\\windows\\temp\\\\\n\n\nUsage of the Sysinternals Psexec tool for remote command execution in the network (as the\nrenamed version tmp):\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n$temp\\TS_P61S.tmp -accepteula -d -s \\\\<redacted_internal_ip1>\\ cmd /c \"arp -a\n>$temp\\TS_P34H.tmp\"\n\n$temp\\TS_P61S.tmp -accepteula -d -s \\\\<redacted_internal_ip2>\\ cmd /c \"ping\n<redacted_internal_ip2> -a -n 2>$temp\\TS_P34H.tmp\"\n\n$temp\\TS_P61S.tmp -accepteula -d -s \\\\<redacted_internal_ip3>\\ cmd /c \"ping -n 2 -a\n<redacted_internal_ip2>>$temp\\TS_P34H.tmp\"\n\n\n-----\n\nUsage of WMI for remote command execution:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip1> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c ping -n 1 -a <redacted_internal_ip4>\n>$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip2> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c netstat -ano >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip2> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c tracert\n<redacted_internal_ip4>>$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c ipconfig /all >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c qwinsta >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c net user administrator >$temp\\a.tmp\n\nwmic /node:<redacted_internal_ip3> /user:<redacted_group>\\<redacted_user> /password:\n<readcted_password> process call create \"cmd /c net user admin >$temp\\a.tmp\n\n\nRemoval of artefacts from the system:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\ /od\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\*.hive\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & del $temp\\*.hive\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & dir $temp\\*.log\"\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & type $temp\\silconfig.log\"\n\n\nFile archiving of remotely collected files, some of which contain *.hive files, possibly for LSA\nsecrets dumping, with the exe command line utility:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\ncmd /C \"C: & cd \\ & $temp\\rar.exe a -r wef.rar \\\\<redacted_internal_ip1>\\c$\\windows\\temp\\1 hp2wsxcde34rfv7788.\"\n\nc:\\windows\\temp\\rar.exe a -r c:\\windows\\temp\\873.rar \\\\\n<redacted_internal_ip2>\\c$\\windows\\temp\\*.hive -hp5tgbnhy67ujm3256\n\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nThe main cluster of infrastructure serving the activity of the UEFI implant and ScrambleCross implants\nis outlined in the table below. Note that the attackers maintained the infrastructure from at least March\n2020, with some servers seemingly still active at the end of 2021 . During the time the actor switched\nbetween multiple hosting providers, resulting in a scattered infrastructure across several ASNs.\n\n**Domain** **IP** **ASN**\n\n\n-----\n\nmb.glbaitech[.]com 188.166.61[.]146 AS14061 – DIGITALOCEAN-ASN\n\nns.glbaitech[.]com 188.166.61[.]146 AS14061 – DIGITALOCEAN-ASN\n\n172.107.231[.]236 AS40676\n\ndev.kinopoisksu[.]com 172.107.231[.]236 AS40676\n\n193.29.57[.]161 AS48314 – IP-PROJECTS\n\nst.kinopoisksu[.]com 136.244.100[.]127 AS20473 – AS-CHOOPA\n\n– 217.69.10[.]104 AS20473 – AS-CHOOPA\n\n– 92.38.178[.]246 AS202422 – GHOST\n\nA careful inspection of the infrastructure shows multiple connections between the servers.

In part, our findings\nalign with multiple public accounts from the previous year of either APT41 or other threat actors, namely\n[Earth Baku and SparklingGoblin, which are believed to be alternative names for APT41 or share](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/earth-baku-returns?utm_source=trendmicroresearch&utm_medium=smk&utm_campaign=0821_EarthBaku1)\nsignificant resources and TTPs with it.\n\nOur conclusion, in particular, is done based on the following factors:\n\nThe loading schemes for ScrambleCross, including the usage of StealthVector and StealthMutant in\nthe infection chain, are identical to those observed leveraged by Earth Baku and SparklingGoblin.\nApart from the loaders themselves, their launchers seem identical. The attackers used the unique\nTTP of initiating the loader execution through exe in all cases observed by us. Particularly\nInstall.bat, as used by Earth Baku and described in the public report by Trend Micro mentioned\nearlier, is highly similar to the sequence of commands used to execute the InstallUtil launcher in\nour case.\nThe ScrambleCross malware itself, which has been reported in use with both Earth Baku and\n[SparklingGoblin, is considered a variant of CROSSWALK, a piece of malware that was described](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\noriginally by Mandiant as an APT41 tool and remains distinct to the group, to the best of our\nknowledge.\nA unique certificate retrieved from multiple ScrambleCross C2 servers in the campaign described\nin this report was sent as a response in a few other dozen servers in the wild, a few of them have\n[been previously reported by the FBI as being part of an APT41-owned infrastructure.](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/7210602/FLASH-AC-000133-TT-Published.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, the following observations are worth mentioning:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe user-mode malware stager deployed by the UEFI implant contains a scheduling logic that is\nsomewhat similar to one seen in Microcin samples (some of which were also found on infected\nhosts in this campaign). This suggests that these groups may be related through shared resources\nor a prime contractor.\nThe said scheduling algorithm found in the stager can take a 672-bit bitmask to determine when\nthe malware should start beaconing the C2 server in an attempt to retrieve the payload, whereby\nthe scheduled working time can be decided in a granularity of 15-minute slots (i.e. the stager\nchecks if it is supposed to run in a particular slot out of the 672 possibilities that constitute a full\nweek, or alternatively sleep for 10 seconds before checking if it has reached a dedicated working\nslot again). A similar scheduling methodology occurs in the case of Microcin, but with a bitmask\nthat simply represents the days of the week on which the malware ought to be active.\n\n**_Scheduling code used in MoonBounce’s user-mode stager_**\n\nThe Mimikat_ssp tool found on a few machines in the targeted network has been seen in use by\nmultiple Chinese-speaking threat actors in the past. One recent example is its use in the campaigns\n[of GhostEmperor, as described in a previous report.](https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSome elements of shellcode leveraged in MoonBounce were spotted in an old rootkit that was part\nof a malicious framework dubbed xTalker, which has been seen in the wild since at least 2013,\nalongside several malware families affiliated to known actors, e.g. NetTraveler, Enfal and Microcin.\nIt was prominently used against Russian-speaking targets including military, governmental entities\nand think-tanks.\nBoth components shared a similar name-hashing algorithm, which is outlined below, along with\nunique corresponding function name hashes (e.g. 0x311B83F, the name hash of ExAllocatePool)\nthat were not seen in use elsewhere in the wild.\n\n**_Name-hashing algorithm used identically in_**\n**_both MoonBounce and xTalker’s rootkit_**\n\nIn addition, both pieces of code used a technique of\nreplacing magic marker values within shellcode\nbuffers with pointer addresses during runtime.\nMoonBounce’s code used the marker\n0x1122334455667788, while the xTalker rootkit’s\ncode used 0x1234567812345678.\n\n**_Magic marker values replaced during execution within shellcodes in xTalker’s_**\n**_rootkit and MoonBounce_**\n\nIn the case of xTalker, the above code elements were found within shellcode intended to be staged\nthrough an MBR bootkit. However, it is not clear to what extent it was actually used. This may\nsuggest that the MoonBounce and xTalker codes were authored by the same, or a closely affiliated,\ndeveloper.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[In September 2020, the US Department of Justice released a series of indictments against members of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nthe APT41 group, charging them with a high number of computer intrusions against a variety of targets,\nboth in the private and public sectors, some of which included high-profile supply chain attacks. The\nintrusion set described in this report, and in other public accounts we referred to, shows that the group\ndid not cease to be active despite these legal proceedings.\n\nMoreover, it is evident that the group maintains a high level of proficiency and sophistication in the\ndevelopment of its toolset, gaining a foothold in new areas like UEFI firmware. In this sense, the group\nhas introduced its own innovation to this landscape – patching an existing benign core component in the\nfirmware (rather than adding a new driver to it), thereby turning the UEFI firmware into a highly\nstealthy and persistent storage for malware in the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Following previous predictions, we can now say that UEFI threats are gradually becoming a norm. With](https://securelist.com/ksb-threat-predictions-for-2018/83169/)\nthis in mind, vendors are taking more precautions to mitigate attacks like MoonBounce, for example by\n[enabling Secure Boot by default. We assess that, in this ongoing arms race, attacks against UEFI will](https://securelist.com/advanced-threat-predictions-for-2022/104870/)\ncontinue to proliferate, with attackers evolving and finding ways to exploit and bypass current security\nmeasures.\n\nAs a safety measure against this attack and similar ones, it is recommended to update the UEFI firmware\nregularly and verify that BootGuard, where applicable, is enabled. Likewise, enabling Trust Platform\nModules, in case a corresponding hardware is supported on the machine, is also advisable. On top of all,\na security product that has visibility into the firmware images should add an extra layer of security,\nalerting the user on a potential compromise if such occurs.\n\n## MoonBounce’
