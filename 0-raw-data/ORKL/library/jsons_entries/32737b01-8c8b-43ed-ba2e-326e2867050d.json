These hacktivists have been targeting\na wide swath of industries and sectors, including aviation, energy, financial, government and\npublic safety, technology, media and telecommunications sectors.\n\nHacktivism is the combination of hacking (unauthorized access to or control over computer\nnetwork security systems for some illicit purpose) and political activism. Because of this,\nhacktivists have social and political agendas as opposed to hackers who commit cyber\ncrimes for profit and often times infamy. It should be noted that many pro-Russian hacktivists\nare also likely to be hackers responsible for attacks across enterprises and governments.\n\n**Pro-Russian hacktivist activity**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe pro-Russian hacktivist groups targeting governments and organizations that oppose\nRussia's stance on the war in Ukraine have been observed using several cyber tactics,\nincluding DDoS attacks, network intrusion and stealing personally identifiable information\n(PII).\n\nIn July and August 2022, numerous hacktivist groups accelerated their nefarious activities.\nThe most impactful Ukrainian-specific incidents conducted by major pro-Russian hacktivist\ngroups detected by Intel 471 were:\n\n**Народная Cyberармия (Eng. People's CyberArmy) aka CyberArmyRussia: The**\nfaction conducted multiple DDoS attacks against entities in Europe and Ukraine across\nmany industries, targeting Ukrainian news outlets and local government websites. Their\nmost significant targets were in August when group members attacked the website of\nUkraine's nuclear power company, Energoatom. The cyberattack came as tensions\nflared over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in the south of Ukraine, occupied by Russian\nforces since March 2022. They also targeted the European Space Agency following\nnews that Finnish company ICEYE agreed to provide the Ukrainian government access\nto the SAR satellite constellation to fight against Russian aggression.\n\n**CyberArmyRussia members continue to proclaim their opposition to the \"West,**\nEuropean Union and Ukraine\" and release pro-Russian propaganda articles and\nvideos in addition to website breach announcements.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FRwL Team, aka From Russia with Love, Z Team: Group members published the**\npersonal data of people who support Ukraine or oppose the actions of Russia. They\nalso allegedly publish classified Ukrainian and U.S. documents as hacktivist resources.\n\n**KillNet: Gang members attacked the RuTor forum (a predominantly Russian-speaking**\nunderground forum), which they claim is sponsored by the Ukrainian government. NBP\n**Hackers joined the effort to disable the RuTor forum and called for other hackers to**\nparticipate. KillNet also claims the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) paid them one\nmillion rubles (about $16,000 US) to stop an attack against the RuTor forum.\n\nOn August 17, 2022, KillNet claimed responsibility for extensive cyberattacks in Estonia\nshortly after government officials decided to remove Soviet-era monuments near the border\nwith Russia. KillNet also allegedly blocked access to over 200 private and Estonian state\ninstitutions, including banks, government organizations, payment systems and public\nservices.\n\n**NBP Hackers: This group released personal information of Ukraine's government**\nofficials and high-profile personas perceived as enemies of Russia. They also\nencourage the hacking community to join their efforts in disabling the RuTor forum,\nadding to the efforts of the KillNet gang.\n\n**NoName057(16): This hacktivist group, the most active of the groups on this list, conducted**\nmultiple DDoS attacks against entities in Norway, prompted by the decision of Norwegian\nauthorities to block Russian cargo to the Svalbard archipelago. In addition, members\nattacked numerous companies from the financial and government sectors in Lithuania,\napparently due to the country's ban on transporting goods and cargo to the Kaliningrad\nregion of Russia. The gang also conducted massive attacks on the Polish government and\ntransportation sectors, including airports in Kraków, Warsaw and Wrocław, the gas pipeline\nEuRoPol, the logistics company PKP Cargo and defense weapon and military equipment\nprovider Polski Holding Obronny. Last but by no means least, group members attacked\nvarious Finnish, Latvian and Polish government agencies all considered to be sympathetic to\nthe Ukrainian effort. The graph below shows a breakdown of the impacted entities by\ncountry.\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the very nature of state-sponsored cyber attacks, there is limited conclusive evidence\nthat the Kremlin is directing or supporting the aforementioned hacktivism. Although the link\nlikely exists and state-sponsored hacking is nothing new, the Kremlin will be sure to distance\nitself from any malign activity so as not to risk breaching NATOs Collective Defence treaty,\nArticle 5. In any case, companies, enterprises and governments should limit their attack\nsurface, ensure that software patching is conducted routinely and invest in increased threat\ndetection capabilities in the face of Russian cyber aggression.\n\n\n-----",
