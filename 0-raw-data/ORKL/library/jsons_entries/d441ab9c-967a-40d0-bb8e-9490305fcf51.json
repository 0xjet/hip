They become prey. The same principle\n\napplies in cybersecurity — the adversary is advancing so fast that you can’t\n\nafford to underestimate them.\n\nOur latest research demonstrates that adversaries are becoming more efficient,\n\nfocused, and business-like in their approach — in many ways, more like the\n\nenterprise organizations they prey upon. That’s why our team of security analysts,\n\nexperts, and authors chose “the enterprising adversary” as the theme for this\n\nyear’s CrowdStrike Global Threat Report.\n\nTake generative artificial intelligence (genAI), for instance. Highly effective\n\nadversaries across all major categories — nation-state, eCrime, and hacktivist —\n\nhave become early and avid adopters. The “force multiplier” impact of\n\noff-the-shelf chatbots has made genAI a popular addition to the global\n\nhacker toolbox.\n\nAlong with legitimate organizations, easy access to commercial large language\n\nmodels (LLMs) is making adversaries more productive, too. It’s shortening their\n\nlearning curve and development cycles, and it’s allowing them to increase the\n\nscale and pace of their activities. Though this report indicates that malicious\n\nuse of AI is growing, it remains largely iterative and evolutionary at this point\n\nin time. Only occasionally does it manifest as an entirely novel use case.\n\nBut it is still early days.\n\nAt CrowdStrike, we aren’t waiting for threat actors to experience their next\n\n“aha” moment. We are accelerating our own use of AI techniques — from our\n\nfoundational machine learning capabilities to our leading-edge generative and\n\nagentic AI models — to help our customers anticipate the next zero-day attacks in\n\nadvance and proactively inoculate themselves against them. This is the essence\n\nof an AI-native approach to cyber defense. Unlike legacy systems — which are\n\nstill relied upon by organizations globally — we don’t sit idle until an attack\n\noccurs before we can identify and stop it.\n\n###### Adversarial Enterprise Takes Its Toll\n\nThe job of protecting your organizations continues to get harder by the day.\n\nYou’ll find ample evidence of this fact in the data that follows. The number of\n\nnew “named adversaries” tracked by the elite CrowdStrike Counter Adversary\n\nOperations team continues to expand, and established adversaries are\n\nconstantly adding new targets and more sophisticated techniques to\n\ntheir evasion, intrusion, and exfiltration arsenals.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe purpose of this report is to arm you, the world’s security professionals and\n\ndedicated cyber defenders, with the knowledge you need to keep a step ahead\n\nof these threat actors — and to never, ever underestimate them.\n\nHere are a few key facts you should know about the shifting\n\nthreat landscape:\n\n###### • Breakout time — how long it takes for an adversary to start moving laterally\n\nacross your network — reached an all-time low in the past year: The average\n\nfell to 48 minutes, and the fastest breakout time we observed dropped to\n\na mere 51 seconds.\n\n###### • Voice phishing (vishing) attacks, where adversaries call victims to amplify\n\ntheir activities with persuasive social engineering techniques, saw explosive\n\ngrowth — up 442% between the first and second half of 2024.\n\n###### • Attacks related to initial access boomed, accounting for 52% of\n\nvulnerabilities observed by CrowdStrike in 2024. Providing access as a\n\nservice became a thriving business, as advertisements for access brokers\n\nincreased 50% year-over-year.\n\n###### • Among nation-states, China-nexus activity surged 150% overall,\n\nwith some targeted industries suffering 200% to 300% more attacks than\n\nthe previous year.\n\n###### • GenAI played a pivotal role in sophisticated cyberattack campaigns\n\nin 2024. It enabled FAMOUS CHOLLIMA to create highly convincing fake\n\nIT job candidates that infiltrated victim organizations, and it helped China-,\n\nRussia-, and Iran-affiliated threat actors conduct AI-driven disinformation\n\nand influence operations to disrupt elections.\n\nAs with every product and service we provide, we hope this year’s\n\nGlobal Threat Report makes you more aware, more attuned to the threats\n\nyou may be facing now or in the near future, and better equipped overall\n\nto defend your organization.\n\nCrowdStrike remains at your service and wholly dedicated to the\n\nsingle-minded vision and mission on which the company was founded\n\nmore than a decade ago. Our company, our platform, and our people are\n\nfocused on one thing: working together in close partnership with our\n\ncustomers to stop breaches.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO and Founder\n\n\n## »\nFOR MORE INFORMATION ON ANY OF\nTHE ADVERSARIES MENTIONED IN THIS\nREPORT AND THOSE TARGETING YOUR\nINDUSTRY OR REGION, CHECK OUT THE\n[CROWDSTRIKE ADVERSARY UNIVERSE.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/)\n\n\n-----\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n###### Introduction\b 5\n\n Naming Conventions\b 8\n\n Threat Landscape Overview\b 9\n\n Key Adversary Themes\b 15\n\n The Business of Social Engineering\b 15\n\n Generative Artificial Intelligence and the Enterprising Adversary\b 19\n\n China’s Cyber Enterprise\b 25\n\n Cloud-Conscious Threat Actors Continue to Innovate\b 29\n\n Enterprising Vulnerability Exploitation\b 34\n\n SaaS Exploitation Likely to Continue\b 40\n\n Conclusion \b 43\n\n Recommendations\b 45\n\n CrowdStrike Falcon Platform, Products, and Services\b 47\n\n About CrowdStrike\b 53\n\n\n-----\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report is the industry’s preeminent\n\nsource on adversary intelligence, examining the emerging adversary trends\n\nof the past year. During 2024, adversaries matured faster than ever, innovating\n\ntechniques and tools as well as finding creative solutions to circumvent modern\n\ndefenses, all while staying laser-focused on their targets. Adversaries are\n\nstreamlining their tactics, refining and scaling successful strategies, and learning\n\nfrom both their own and their colleagues’ mistakes and successes to conduct\n\nattacks with a business-oriented approach. 2024 was the year of the\n\nenterprising adversary.\n\neCrime adversaries exemplified such enterprising cyberattacks, constantly\n\nadapting to shifting environments and quickly scaling effective operations.\n\nThroughout 2024, initial access techniques began to shift — eCrime adversaries\n\nbegan moving away from phishing to alternative access methods. This shift\n\nsuggests that commodity malware operators are likely finding more effective and\n\nsuccessful infections with innovative techniques as they face hardened security\n\ndefenses. One such technique that proliferated in 2024 is social engineering\n\nleveraging telephony-based exploitation: Various eCrime adversaries are\n\nincreasingly adopting vishing, callback phishing, and help desk social\n\nengineering attacks to gain a foothold into networks.\n\nThese shifting initial access methods are consistent with a larger trend identified\n\n[in the CrowdStrike 2024 Threat Hunting Report: Rather than delivering malware,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report/)\n\neCrime adversaries are increasingly leveraging legitimate remote monitoring and\n\nmanagement (RMM) tools to access a victim’s system — and therefore making\n\nmalware non-essential for successful operations. Throughout 2024, eCrime\n\nactors frequently leveraged RMM tools in their campaigns.\n\nIn 2024, China’s cyber espionage operations reached new levels of maturity, with\n\nadversaries maintaining a higher operational tempo than observed in 2023 and\n\nengaging in prolific targeting. Decades of government investment into China’s\n\ncyber workforce and programs have yielded matured capabilities and efficiencies\n\nas well as an increasing number of new, specialized China-nexus adversaries. In\n\n2024, CrowdStrike graduated seven new China-nexus adversaries and observed\n\na 150% increase in China-nexus activity across all sectors on average compared\n\nto 2023. Additionally, China-nexus adversaries increasingly prioritized operations\n\nsecurity (OPSEC) and at-scale infrastructure management by obfuscating their\n\ni i i i i l l b (ORB) k\n\n\n-----\n\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)-nexus adversaries\n\n[LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, VELVET CHOLLIMA, and SILENT CHOLLIMA](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/labyrinth-chollima/)\n\nconsistently targeted defense and aerospace entities in various countries.\n\nHowever, similar to previous years, most of these adversaries’ cyber operations\n\nfocused on generating currency, which has become a lifeline for the regime.\n\n[Notably, FAMOUS CHOLLIMA innovated their currency generation operations](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/famous-chollima/)\n\nin 2024 by leveraging their IT worker schemes at scale across the globe.\n\n[During 2024, CrowdStrike Falcon® Adversary OverWatch™ threat hunters](https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/threat-intelligence/adversary-overwatch/)\n\nresponded to 304 FAMOUS CHOLLIMA incidents, with nearly 40% of\n\nthese representing insider threat operations.\n\nWhile DPRK adversaries have skillfully shifted their operations to support\n\nlarge-scale currency generation over the years, the specific tactics deployed\n\nin their 2024 operations — such as leveraging virtual interviews, allocating\n\nsignificant resources and staffing, and using laptop farms at scale — highlight\n\nthe DPRK’s enterprising approach to computer network operations (CNO).\n\nAcross the 2024 vulnerability threat landscape, threat actors continued\n\nto target devices in the network periphery and regularly leveraged publicly\n\navailable vulnerability research — such as disclosures, technical blogs,\n\nand proof-of-concept (POC) exploits — to aid their malicious activity.\n\nWithin the cloud landscape, an increasing number of new adversaries\n\neffectively exploited cloud environments, often employing previously\n\ntested techniques and adapting them for their own goals.\n\nAdversaries also leveraged genAI when conducting intelligence operations (IO)\n\ntargeting election processes. Throughout 2024, adversaries increasingly adopted\n\ngenAI, especially as a part of social engineering efforts.\n\nStaying one step ahead of the enterprising adversary is difficult — but not\n\nimpossible. As the adversary matures, so do your defenses. As the adversary\n\n[innovates, so does CrowdStrike.

As organizations work to strengthen\n\ntheir defenses, adversaries target their weaknesses: employees susceptible to social engineering and\n\nsystems lacking modern security controls. Once inside, they act within seconds, stealthily moving across\n\nnetworks to execute attacks. In 2024, 79% of the detections CrowdStrike observed were malware-free,\n\nindicating adversaries are instead using hands-on-keyboard techniques that blend in with legitimate\n\nuser activity and impede detection.\n\n\n79% of detections in 2024\n\nwere malware-free, up from\n\n40% in 2019\n\n###### 257\n\n26 new adversaries tracked by\n\nCrowdStrike, raising the total\n\nto 257\n\n\n###### 00:51\n\n\nAverage eCrime breakout\n\ntime dropped to 48 minutes,\n\nwith the fastest breakout\n\nobserved at just 51 seconds\n\n52% of vulnerabilities observed\n\nby CrowdStrike in 2024 were\n\nrelated to initial access\n\n\nChina-nexus activity surged\n\n150% across all sectors, with a\n\nstaggering 200-300% increase\n\nin key targeted industries\n\nAccess broker advertisements\n\nincreased 50% year-over-year\n\n\nVishing attacks skyrocketed\n\n442% between the first and\n\nsecond half of 2024\n\nValid account abuse accounted\n\nfor 35% of cloud incidents\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Growing Reliance on Identity Attacks and Vulnerability Exploits\n\nEvery breach starts with initial access, and identity-based\n\nattacks are among the most effective entry methods.\n\nInstead of traditional malware, adversaries favor faster and\n\nstealthier methods such as vishing, social engineering,\n\naccess broker services, and trusted relationship abuse.\n\nA major driver behind this shift is the rise of access\n\nbrokers: specialists who acquire access to organizations\n\nand sell it to other threat actors, including ransomware\n\noperators. Access broker activity surged in 2024, with\n\nadvertised accesses increasing by nearly 50% over 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, valid account abuse was responsible for 35%\n\nof cloud-related incidents, reflecting attackers' growing\n\nfocus on identity compromise as a gateway to broader\n\nenterprise environments.\n\nBut identity isn’t the only target — adversaries are also\n\nexploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access. In 2024,\n\n52% of observed vulnerabilities were linked to initial\n\naccess, reinforcing the need to secure exposed\n\nsystems before attackers establish a foothold.\n\nAs adversaries scale identity-based attacks and\n\nvulnerability exploitation, organizations must adopt\n\nproactive defense strategies, including identity\n\nverification, risk-based patching, and early detection\n\nof credential abuse, to disrupt adversary operations\n\nbefore they escalate.\n\n###### The Continued Rise of Interactive Intrusions\n\n\nFigure 1. Access broker advertisements by month, 2024\n\n\nModern cyber threats are increasingly dominated by “interactive intrusion” techniques, where adversaries\n\nexecute hands-on-keyboard actions to achieve objectives. Unlike traditional malware attacks, these intrusions\n\nrely on human adversaries mimicking legitimate user or administrator behavior, making them exceptionally\n\ndifficult to detect.\n\nIn 2024, CrowdStrike observed a 35% year-over-year increase in interactive intrusion campaigns. For the\n\nseventh consecutive year, the technology sector remained the most targeted industry, with high attack volumes\n\nalso observed in consulting, manufacturing, and retail. The charts on the following page reflect the relative\n\nfrequency of intrusions in the top geographical regions and industry verticals.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NORTH AMERICA**\n\n**EAST ASIA**\n\n**EUROPE**\n\n**SOUTH ASIA**\n\n**MIDDLE EAST**\n\n**SOUTH AMERICA**\n\n**OCEANIA**\n\n**AFRICA**\n\n\n###### Interactive Intrusions by Region\n\n 14%\n\n 11% 53%\n\n 6%\n 7%\n 1%\n\n 5%\n\nFigure 2.

The speed of this “breakout time” determines how fast a defender must respond to reduce the\n\ncosts and damages associated with an intrusion.\n\nIn 2024, the average breakout time for interactive eCrime intrusions fell to 48 minutes, down from 62 minutes in 2023.\n\nAlarmingly, the fastest breakout was recorded at just 51 seconds — meaning defenders may have less than a minute to\n\ndetect and respond before attackers establish deeper control.\n\nThis rapid escalation in breakout time reinforces the need for:\n\n###### • Real-time threat detection to identify and halt intrusions before they spread\n\n • Identity and access controls to prevent adversaries from leveraging valid credentials\n\n\n\n###### • Proactive threat hunting to identify pre-attack behaviors and block adversary movements early\n\n\npresent; in this case, the adversary chose Quick Assist to establish control\n\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\n CURLY SPIDER's Social Engineering Attack\n\n[In 2024, CURLY SPIDER emerged as one of the fastest and most adaptive eCrime adversaries,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/curly-spider/)\n\nexecuting high-speed, hands-on intrusions. In this case, the adversary attempted to achieve their\n\nobjectives without even needing to break out to another device. The entire attack chain — from initial\n\nuser interaction and social engineering to introducing a backdoor account to establish persistence —\n\ntook under four minutes.\n\nThis incident would have been prevented by the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor with proper prevention\n\npolicies. Regardless, within minutes, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters saw the suspicious\n\nactivity, notified the customer, and eliminated the threat.\n\n###### How CURLY SPIDER Operates\n\nThis adversary relies heavily on social engineering for initial access. In some cases,\n\nthe following will occur:\n\n###### • A user will receive a large volume of spam emails impersonating charities, newsletters,\n\nor financial offers\n\n###### • Shortly after, a caller posing as help desk or IT support claims the spam is caused by malware\n\nor outdated spam filters\n\n###### • The user is instructed to join a remote session using an RMM tool, such as Microsoft Quick Assist\n\nor TeamViewer, with the attacker guiding them through the installation if the tool is not already\n\npresent; in this case, the adversary chose Quick Assist to establish control\n\n\n-----\n\n### CURLY\n\nCrowdStrike OverWatch in Action:\n\nStopping a Social Engineering\n\nAttack in Under 4 Minutes\n\n### SPIDER\n\n\nSpam\nBombing\n\n\nGains\n\n**REMOTE ACCESS TO**\n**QUICK ASSIST**\n\n\nValidates\n\n**CONNECTION**\n**TO ADVERSARY-**\n**CONTROLLED**\n**INFRASTRUCTURE**\n\n\nUses\n\n**CURL TO**\n**DOWNLOAD**\n**MALICIOUS**\n**SCRIPTS**\n\n\n**SCRIPTS TO SET**\n**REGISTRY RUN**\n**KEYS AND REMOVE**\n**ARTIFACTS**\n\n\nRuns\n\n\nDeploys\n\n**BACKDOOR**\n**USER**\n\n\nSTOP\n\n|+3:43|+0:06|+0:06|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nAdversary +3:43 +0:06 +0:06 STOP\n\n**CROWDSTRIKE**\n**OVERWATCH**\n**IDENTIFIES AND**\nVishing Call **BLOCKS BACKDOOR**\n**ACCOUNT**\n\nFigure 5. Timeline of CrowdStrike OverWatch moving faster than CURLY SPIDER\nto stop a social engineering attack in less than four minutes\n\nOnce CURLY SPIDER gains initial access, their window of opportunity is limited — access will only last as long as the\n\nvictim remains on the call. To extend control, the adversary’s immediate objective is to establish persistent access\n\nbefore the session ends.\n\nWith remote access secured, CURLY SPIDER moves quickly — often while still actively engaging with the victim —\n\nto deploy their payloads and establish persistence. The bulk of the intrusion time is spent ensuring connectivity and\n\ntroubleshooting any access issues to reach their cloud-hosted malicious scripts.\n\n**1.** Validating Connectivity (3:43)\n\n###### › Posing as IT support offering assistance, the adversary requests access to Quick Assist.\n\n › The adversary ensures a connection to pre-configured cloud storage, where they host malicious scripts\n\nand work through any access barriers. Once access is confirmed, CURLY SPIDER downloads malicious scripts.\n\n**2.** Deploying Payload (0:06)\n\n###### › CURLY SPIDER executes the scripts via curl or PowerShell. These scripts:\n\n • Modify registry run keys, creating a user to ensure execution at startup\n\n • Remove forensic artifacts to erase traces of the intrusion\n\n**3.** Establishing Persistent Access (0:06)\n\n###### › The adversary creates a backdoor user, embedding persistence directly into the system.\n\n › The final payload is executed under a legitimate binary, allowing CURLY SPIDER to blend into normal activity\n\nand evade detection.\n\nIn this example, CURLY SPIDER does not rely on traditional “breakout” techniques to move laterally.\n\nInstead, the adversary compromises the network in seconds by securing long-term access before the victim\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Impact and Connection to Ransomware\n\nIn this case, CURLY SPIDER was stopped by CrowdStrike OverWatch before they could proceed with the rest of\n\ntheir attack. However, CrowdStrike Intelligence has seen these tactics directly support ransomware operations,\n\n[and this adversary frequently collaborates with WANDERING SPIDER, the group behind Black Basta ransomware.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/wandering-spider/)\n\nBy combining high-tempo social engineering, legitimate remote tools, and cloud-hosted payloads, CURLY SPIDER\n\nexemplifies how modern adversaries bypass traditional defenses and achieve rapid operational success.\n\n###### Proactive Defense Is Essential\n\nAdversaries are refining their tactics to move faster and exploiting trusted access to bypass traditional defenses.\n\nThe explosive growth in access broker activity, valid credential abuse, and interactive intrusions highlights the\n\nurgent need for organizations to adopt proactive security strategies that prevent, detect, and respond to these\n\nthreats in real time.\n\nSecurity teams must:\n\n###### › Prioritize identity protection to prevent unauthorized access\n\n › Harden cloud environments against credential abuse and address misconfigurations\n\n › Accelerate response times to counter rapid breakout events\n\n › Leverage AI-driven threat hunting to detect stealthy adversary movements\n\n\n-----\n\n# Key Adversary Themes\n\n###### THE BUSINESS OF\n\n SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\nSince 2023, eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries have increasingly used identity compromise and other\n\nhuman-centric tradecraft to gain initial access and perform lateral movement. The emergence of this tactic is\n\npartly driven by the growing efficacy and abundance of modern host-based security tools such as endpoint\n\ndetection and response (EDR) solutions. These factors have driven social engineering activity in which threat\n\nactors attempt to access targeted accounts or persuade legitimate employees to provide remote access\n\nto targeted systems.\n\nIn 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a massive increase in the number of distinct campaigns using\n\ntelephone-oriented social engineering techniques to gain initial access, including vishing and help desk social\n\nengineering, marking a potential shift in the eCrime ecosystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2024 Vishing Detections\n\n\n###### 2024 JAN\n\n\n###### FEB\n\n\n###### MAR\n\n\n###### APR\n\n\n###### MAY\n\n\n###### JUN\n\n\n###### JUL\n\n\n###### AUG\n\n\n###### SEP\n\n\n###### OCT\n\n\n###### NOV\n\n\n###### 93\n\n DEC\n\n\n###### 442% Increase, H1 vs. H2 2024\n\nFigure 6. Vishing intrusions detected by CrowdStrike OverWatch per month, 2024\n\nIn vishing campaigns, threat actors call targeted users and attempt to persuade them to download malicious\n\npayloads, establish remote support sessions, or enter their credentials to adversary-in-the-middle (AITM)\n\nphishing pages. In most 2024 vishing campaigns, threat actors impersonated IT support staff, calling targeted\n\nusers under the pretext of resolving connectivity or security issues.\n\nThroughout 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked at least six similar but likely distinct campaigns in which\n\nthreat actors posing as IT staff called their targets and attempted to persuade them into establishing remote\n\nsupport sessions, often using Microsoft Quick Assist. In many cases, calls were made via Microsoft Teams from\n\nexternal tenants.\n\nAt least four of these campaigns leveraged spam bombing — sending thousands of spam emails to targeted\n\n[users’ email addresses — as a pretext for the vishing call. The CrowdStrike Falcon® Complete Next-Gen MDR](https://www.crowdstrike.com/services/falcon-complete-next-gen-mdr/)\n\nand CrowdStrike OverWatch teams observed a significant increase in these campaigns in the second half of\n\n2024, detecting several relevant intrusions each day. eCrime adversary CURLY SPIDER is behind one of these\n\ncampaigns, with relevant intrusions culminating in Black Basta ransomware deployment.\n\n[The long-standing Russia-based eCrime adversary CHATTY SPIDER continued to employ callback phishing as an](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/chatty-spider/)\n\ninitial access vector in data theft and extortion campaigns. In callback phishing, threat actors typically begin by\n\nsending a lure email to targeted users, often regarding an imminent charge or overdue payment. This prompts\n\nusers to initiate a phone interaction. CHATTY SPIDER primarily targets the legal and insurance sectors and has\n\ndemanded ransoms up to 8 million USD. Several eCrime actors used callback phishing to gain initial access in\n\n2024, including one campaign that used it to install a remote support tool.\n\n[Brazil-based eCrime adversary PLUMP SPIDER exclusively targeted Brazil-based organizations throughout 2024](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/plump-spider/)\n\nwith attempts to conduct wire fraud.

In these campaigns, threat actors call a targeted organization’s IT help desk and impersonate a legitimate\n\nemployee, attempting to persuade a help desk agent to reset passwords and/or multifactor authentication (MFA)\n\nfor the relevant account.\n\n[Since early 2023, SCATTERED SPIDER has used this technique to gain access to single sign-on (SSO) accounts](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/scattered-spider/)\n\nand cloud-based application suites. Multiple eCrime actors adopted this technique in 2024. Several relevant\n\ncases targeted academic and healthcare entities; in these incidents, threat actors subsequently used the\n\ncompromised identity to exfiltrate data from cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) applications or\n\nmodify employee payroll data.\n\nIT help desks often require employees seeking password and MFA resets to provide their full name, date of birth,\n\nemployee ID, and manager name or answer a previously determined security question. However, eCrime actors\n\nattempting to socially engineer help desk personnel often accurately respond to these questions. Much of this\n\ninformation is not necessarily privileged and can be found in public resources and social media sites. Identity data\n\nthat is typically confidential, such as a Social Security number, is often advertised in underground markets.\n\nIn most help desk social engineering incidents, calls were made outside the victim’s local business hours.\n\nThis is likely because it enables the threat actor to maintain longer access to the compromised account before\n\nthe legitimate owner reports suspicious activity.\n\nThreat actors using this technique often register their own device for MFA to enable persistent access to\n\ncompromised accounts. They also often manually delete emails from compromised mailboxes related to\n\nsuspicious account activity or configure mail transport rules to redirect relevant emails to a folder other\n\nthan the main inbox.\n\nOver the past year, several eCrime actors have openly recruited callers on popular eCrime forums.\n\nThe advertisements are usually for English-speaking callers with knowledge of RMM tooling and experience\n\nconducting remote sessions. Some eCrime actors have also sought effective methods for spoofing phone\n\nnumbers or encrypting calls to ensure caller IDs can be edited and appear more legitimate. This activity suggests\n\nphone-oriented social engineering will be a credible threat in 2025 as demand for these capabilities increases.\n\n\n###### HOW TO MITIGATE HELP DESK SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\n\n\n###### • Require video authentication with government identification for employees who call\n\nto request self-service password resets\n\n###### • Train help desk employees to exercise caution when taking password and MFA reset\n\nrequest phone calls made outside of business hours, particularly if an unusually high\n\nnumber of requests is made in a short time frame or if the caller purports to be calling\n\non behalf of a colleague\n\n###### • Use additional, non-push-based authentication factors such as FIDO2 to prevent\n\naccount compromise\n\n###### • Monitor for more than one user registering the same device or phone number for MFA\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n\n###### AND THE ENTERPRISING ADVERSARY\n\n\nGenAI has emerged as an attractive tool for adversaries with a low barrier to entry that makes it widely accessible.\n\nRecent advancements in genAI have enhanced the efficacy of certain cyber operations, particularly those using\n\nsocial engineering. It will almost certainly be employed in 2025 cyber operations.\n\nAdversaries increasingly adopted genAI throughout 2024, particularly in support of social engineering efforts and\n\nhigh-tempo IO campaigns. Both were supported by genAI tools that can create highly convincing outputs without\n\nprecise prompting, custom model training, or fine-tuning. Some threat actors are employing genAI, specifically LLMs,\n\nto support CNO efforts.\n\n###### Malicious\n Social\n Computer Network\n Engineering\n Operations\n\n   - FAMOUS CHOLLIMA employed fictitious   - Spam email campaign distributing Snake\n\nLinkedIn profiles with genAI-created text Keylogger likely used LLM-generated\n\nand fake profile images content\n\n   - Deepfake video and voice clones enabled   - Big game hunting (BGH) ransomware\n\nbusiness email compromise (BEC) schemes operators APT INC deployed likely\n\nLLM-authored data destruction script\n\n   - Studies validated effectiveness of genAI\n\nin phishing     - Likely LLM-generated decoy sites used in\n\nNITRO SPIDER campaigns\n\n   - China-aligned, LLM-powered Green Cicada\n\nnetwork posted coordinated inauthentic     - Actors on criminal forms discussed using\n\nbehavior on social media LLMs for coding and shell commands\n\n   - Russia-aligned operators used LLMs to   - LLM was likely used to develop an alleged\n\nspread disinformation on social media exploit for CVE-2024-3400\n\n   - GenAI was used during Indian election   - Cloud-conscious operators attempted to\n\nseason to create videos and images gain access to enterprise LLMs\n\nFigure 8.

These tools can support\n\nsocial engineering efforts or IO. Despite the relative novelty of genAI,\n\nCrowdStrike has identified several examples of adversaries using it.\n\n###### Social Engineering\n\nOperators associated with DPRK-nexus adversary FAMOUS CHOLLIMA obtain\n\npositions at companies worldwide under fake personas, occasionally using genAI\n\ntools to socially engineer recruiters during the job application process. They also\n\ncreate fictitious LinkedIn profiles with genAI-created text and fake profile images.\n\nDuring interviews, many FAMOUS CHOLLIMA candidates provide answers likely\n\nderived from external sources. LLMs likely support these interviews by rapidly\n\ngenerating plausible responses.\n\nGenAI is also used for BEC and fraud. In February 2024, unidentified threat\n\nactor(s) used public footage of a target company’s chief financial officer and\n\nother employees to create credible deepfake video clones and socially engineer\n\nthe victim into transferring 25.6 million USD to the threat actor(s). In May 2024,\n\nindustry reporting indicated threat actors had impersonated the CEO of an\n\ninternational professional services entity and attempted to solicit fraudulent\n\npayments. The threat actor also appeared to have used genAI to clone the\n\nCEO’s voice and attempted to persuade the call recipient to transfer funds.\n\nThe relationship between genAI and social engineering is also evidenced by\n\nthe evolving focus of mobile malware. Since late 2023, the GoldPickaxe malware\n\nhas been employed to steal biometric facial data from iOS and Android devices\n\nthroughout the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. The malware, which cannot bypass\n\nauthentication, captures images and videos to generate deepfake videos or\n\nperform face-swap operations.\n\nAcademic research further highlights the appeal of LLMs for social engineering.\n\nLLMs can generate phishing email content or credential harvesting websites\n\nat least as well as humans. A 2024 study of phishing email click-through rates\n\nindicated LLM-generated phishing messages had a significantly higher\n\nclick-through rate (54%) than likely human-written phishing messages (12%).[1]\n\nA separate 2024 study found detection rates for LLM-generated phishing\n\npages were comparable to those for human-created phishing pages.[2]\n\n1 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00586](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00586)\n\n\n## »\nA 2024 STUDY OF PHISHING EMAIL\nCLICK-THROUGH RATES INDICATED\nLLM-GENERATED PHISHING MESSAGES\nHAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER\nCLICK-THROUGH RATE (54%) THAN\nLIKELY HUMAN-WRITTEN PHISHING\nMESSAGES (12%).[1]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ADVERSARY SPOTLIGHT:\n\n FAMOUS CHOLLIMA\n\nIn 2024, FAMOUS CHOLLIMA quickly entered the spotlight due to their\n\nbroad-scale operations, high operational tempo, and unique malicious\n\ninsider tactics.

This application was disguised as a coding challenge for\n\nblockchain developers and delivered to victims under the guise of an employment\n\ninterview. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA deployed seven distinct malware families in 2024,\n\nevading detection by slightly refining how the files were downloaded\n\nand executed.\n\nFAMOUS CHOLLIMA’s malicious insiders appear to opportunistically pursue\n\ninsider access across multiple sectors. The adversary’s activity is likely driven by\n\navailable employment opportunities rather than specific targeting requirements.\n\nOperatives use stolen or fraudulent identities to obtain software development\n\njobs and then send their company-provided laptop to a third-party facilitator\n\nrunning a laptop farm. CrowdStrike OverWatch identified several laptop\n\nfarms in Illinois, New York, Texas, and Florida. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA installs\n\nremote management tools and several browser extensions on the laptops.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed code or intellectual property\n\nexfiltration in some cases, most insider threats appear motivated by the\n\njob’s salary.\n\nFAMOUS CHOLLIMA was one of the most active adversaries in 2024,\n\nsignificantly surpassing other state-nexus adversaries’ operational tempos.\n\nNotably, activity increased in the second half of 2024. This adversary will very\n\nlikely continue conducting parallel cyber and insider threat campaigns well into\n\n2025. This assessment is based on the adversary’s success, their ongoing high\n\noperational tempo, and the minimal impact of government indictments and\n\nactions against the adversary throughout 2024.\n\n###### Information Operations\n\nAdversaries can easily employ genAI tools to conduct IO campaigns and\n\nprimarily use them to create tailored content at scale. Unlike other social\n\nengineering techniques, IO campaigns using AI-generated content are\n\ntypically not checked for accuracy by most consumers. Adversaries may\n\nachieve their goals even if the target knows the content is fabricated.\n\nIn August 2024, industry sources reported on Green Cicada, an IO network\n\nlikely enabled by a Chinese-language LLM system comprising more than 5,000\n\ninauthentic accounts on the social media platform X. This network amplified\n\npolitically divisive issues to exacerbate social divisions in the lead-up to the\n\n2024 U.S. presidential election. Industry sources have linked the operation to\n\nChina-based entities using LLMs.\n\nRussia-aligned operators also used genAI to spread disinformation. In 2024,\n\na propagandist likely used LLMs to generate tailored content and workflow\n\nautomation tools that supported a vast IO campaign targeting U.S. audiences.\n\nMultiple Russia-nexus IO campaigns — including those targeting Israel,\n\nthe U.S., and various European countries — employed genAI to generate\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat Actors Leverage GenAI\n\n to Support CNO\n\nSome adversaries are exploring the use of genAI to directly support CNO,\n\nlikely using it to assist in writing utility scripts and developing tools or malware.\n\nLimited direct visibility into adversary use of LLMs often inhibits analysis of\n\nthese campaigns. Nonetheless, many adversaries using LLMs are likely still\n\nfamiliarizing themselves with these tools.\n\nIn March 2024, a criminal actor distributed a spam email campaign that\n\nused a likely LLM-generated .txt template. The emails delivered an archive\n\nfile containing the commodity malware Snake Keylogger. This campaign\n\nmarks CrowdStrike’s first confirmed instance of a criminal actor using likely\n\nLLM-generated content in a malicious spam campaign.\n\n[BGH ransomware operators APT INC used an uncommon, destructive PowerShell](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/big-game-hunting/)\n\nscript to destroy data on a physical host. Based on the comment formatting,\n\nthe similarity to results produced by other LLMs, and the lack of public sources\n\nresembling the script, it was likely generated using an LLM. Adversaries have\n\nused LLMs to generate scripts in the past; for example, SCATTERED SPIDER\n\nused a likely LLM-generated script in 2023.\n\n[eCrime actors have also employed genAI to produce content. NITRO SPIDER,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/nitro-spider)\n\nwho employs malvertising to deliver Nitrogen, used LLM-generated decoy\n\nwebsites in 2024. The adversary lures prospective targets by purchasing\n\nadvertisements for particular search terms via Google or Bing. They filter\n\nout requests not originating from a malicious advertisement to ensure only\n\nlegitimate victims receive the malware; other requests are rerouted to\n\ndecoy websites created with LLM-generated text and imagery.\n\nIn another campaign, an eCrime actor used similar techniques while\n\ndistributing tooling crypted with the Davey crypter to targets who searched\n\nfor two-factor authentication (2FA) software. Clicking on the advertisement\n\nexposes the malicious download site, while direct accesses are forwarded\n\nto an LLM-generated decoy site.\n\nThroughout 2024, several malicious actors discussed using genAI in criminal\n\nmarketplaces and forums. For example, one Latin America (LATAM)-based threat\n\nactor discussed using generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and genAI to\n\nlearn how to build malware with C and C++. As of December 2024, a Yemen\nbased cyber operator related to the Dragon and Stormous ransomware families\n\nmaintains a GitHub repository for a command line interface tool that allegedly\n\nleverages a GPT model for various tasks, including executing shell commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Vulnerability Research and Exploitation\n\nGenAI models are both a target and enabler of exploit-related activity. As with CNO, LLMs can accelerate vulnerability\n\nresearch and testing by potentially speeding up development timelines. However, confirmed evidence of LLM-aided\n\nvulnerability exploit development, and exploitation of LLMs in the wild, remains rare.\n\nIn 2024, Iran-nexus actors were among the most notable groups seeking genAI support in the vulnerability landscape.\n\nIranian government initiatives aspire to leverage AI to develop assistants and enable patching systems for domestic\n\nnetworks. Moreover, Iran’s government aims to use LLMs in vulnerability research and exploit development.\n\nThreat actors’ interest in genAI-enabled exploit development is further evidenced by observed activity in April 2024.\n\nAn unattributed threat actor likely used genAI to develop an alleged exploit for a command injection vulnerability in\n\nGlobalProtect PAN-OS Gateway (CVE-2024-3400). While the exploit was ultimately ineffective, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nobserved exploitation attempts as threat actors attempted to rapidly repurpose LLM-generated exploits in the wild.\n\nAlternatively, threat actors and researchers are exploring potential attack vectors associated with vulnerabilities within\n\ngenAI models. Techniques such as prompt injection may potentially circumvent access controls, achieve code execution,\n\nor raise the potential for unintentional disclosure of sensitive information. Further, genAI platforms with external\n\nresources can introduce vulnerabilities typically associated with many web applications, such as server-side request\n\nforgery and SQL injection.\n\n###### Cloud-Conscious Threat Actors\n\nCloud-conscious adversaries are beginning to explore genAI and LLMs for their operations. As cloud adoption expands\n\nand genAI becomes more integrated into services such as Azure AI Foundry (formerly Azure AI Studio),[3] threat actors\n\nwill likely begin exploiting genAI services for data theft, model manipulation, unauthorized access, and other malicious\n\npurposes.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence expects cloud-conscious threat actors with varied skill levels will increasingly exploit technical\n\nvulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the growing genAI-driven cloud ecosystem. They will seek to abuse AI services,\n\nand services that customers integrate using AI, to acquire data of strategic interest.\n\n\n###### CASE HIGHLIGHT: LLMJACKING\n\n\nLLMJacking involves threat actors exploiting stolen cloud credentials to access AI services to fuel an\n\nexpanding criminal market for unauthorized LLM queries. In Q2 2024, an unknown threat actor compromised\n\na North American consulting victim. In this operation, the threat actor prepared for LLMJacking by listing\n\navailable foundational machine learning (ML) models for a cloud-based AI service. For unavailable models,\n\nthe threat actor attempted to gain access by leveraging an API that enables users to request permission for\n\nrestricted machine learning models by submitting a justification.\n\nIn a separate Q4 2024 campaign, a threat actor compromised a North America-based technology company\n\nand similarly attempted to use the same API to obtain access to models hosted on the cloud platform. In both\n\ncases, the threat actors likely intended to resell ML model access to other threat actors seeking to use the\n\nmodels for malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GenAI Outlook\n\nMore adversaries will likely use genAI to augment social engineering and CNO campaigns in 2025. This assessment\n\nis made with moderate confidence based on the growing availability and capability of genAI tools and adversaries’\n\nincreased experience with integrating them. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses​​ more technically capable threat\n\nactors will be best equipped to employ genAI tools, while less sophisticated threat actors will likely not fully\n\nexploit their capabilities.\n\n\n###### CHINA’S\n\n\n###### CYBER ENTERPRISE\n\n\n###### China’s Maturing Cyber Capabilities\n\nChina’s cyber espionage and intelligence collection capabilities reached an inflection point in 2024 relative to previous\n\nyears. In addition to prolific and high-profile cyber espionage activities — which continued to increase across almost\n\nevery sector that CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks — China-nexus adversaries and the larger ecosystem supporting\n\ntheir operations have matured in capability and capacity.\n\nThroughout 2024, China-nexus adversaries’ advancements manifested through increasingly bold targeting, stealthier\n\ntactics, and specialized operations. The underlying motivation is likely China’s desire for regional influence in the nation’s\n\nnear abroad. This includes a desire for the eventual reunification of Taiwan, which may ultimately bring China into\n\nconflict with the United States.\n\nIn addition to facilitating intelligence collection against foreign political and military entities, these operations likely\n\nfulfill general intelligence requirements in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s strategic plans. This includes the 14th\n\nFive-Year Plan, which highlights key sector and technology priorities. China-nexus adversaries also conduct intelligence\n\ncollection against social and political movements perceived as domestic security threats in China. The CCP collectively\n\nrefers to Falun Gong practitioners, Chinese democracy activists, Uyghur separatists, Tibetan separatists, and Taiwanese\n\nseparatists as the “Five Poisons” and views these groups as a threat to its legitimacy and China’s overall stability.\n\n\n###### National Rejuvenation (伟大复兴)\n 伟大复兴 The aim of national rejuvenation, the CCP’s grand strategy, is to\n The CCP’s grand strategy of modernize and transform China into a global power by ensuring the\n\nCCP remains in power, guaranteeing a strong economy, and securing\n\n###### national rejuvenation China’s ability to pursue its ambitions free from foreign interference.\n\n\n-----\n\nGeneral Secretary Xi Jinping’s 2014 call for China to become a cyber power (网络强国) and the CCP’s grand strategy of\n\nnational rejuvenation (伟大复兴) have accelerated the sophistication of China’s cyber capabilities throughout the first\n\nquarter of the 21st century. The CCP’s decades of cyber program investments include:\n\n###### • Expanding CCP oversight of information networks in China through a broad cybersecurity legal framework\n\n • CCP investment in university systems that produce a highly trained and readily available cyber workforce\n\n • Private sector contracting pipelines that provide skilled support and infrastructure to the People’s Liberation Army\n\n(PLA), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), and Ministry of State Security (MSS) cyber units\n\n###### • Vulnerability discovery, bug hunt, and domestic capture-the-flag competitions that foster Chinese cyber talent and\n\nfeed CCP-controlled exploit development programs\n\n###### • Industry networking through which MSS and PLA cyber operators increasingly share unique closed-access tooling and\n\ntradecraft\n\nUNIVERSITIES WORKFORCE\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n(ORBS),\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nHIGH-CAPABILITY\nOPERATORS CHINA'S\n###### MATURING CYBER ECOSYSTEM\n\nVULNERABILITIES, TALENT AND\nCAPTURE-THE-FLAG CLOSED-EXPLOIT\nEVENTS, BUG HUNTS PROGRAMS\n\nTOOL AND\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nTRAINING\n\nNETWORKING\n\nPROPAGATION\n\nFigure 11.

The emergence of adversaries with unique\n\ntactics, tradecraft, and target scopes represents an ongoing shift in China-nexus\n\nintrusions from so-called smash-and-grab operations to increasingly focused and\n\nmission-specific intrusions.\n\n\nLIMINAL PANDA\n\nDemonstrates extensive knowledge of telecommunications\n\nnetworks and uses compromised telecom infrastructure to move\n\n\nHas targeted technology, gaming, energy, and telecommunications\n\nentities in Taiwan and Indonesia as well as Hong Kong democracy\n\nactivists in operations likely intended to facilitate intelligence\n\n\nHas targeted telecom and professional services entities and relies\n\nheavily on exploiting internet-facing appliances (such as Cisco\n\n\nto victim networks and uses a combination of unique, shared,\n\nand publicly available tools in their intrusions; targets financial\n\n\nTargets Africa- and Middle East-based government entities —\n\nparticularly in the diplomatic space — and increasingly uses\n\nanonymization attempts in the operations\n\n|Col1|Demonstrates extensive knowledge of telecommunications|\n|---|---|\n||networks and uses compromised telecom infrastructure to across regions LOCKSMITH PANDA Has targeted technology, gaming, energy, and telecommu entities in Taiwan and Indonesia as well as Hong Kong dem activists in operations likely intended to facilitate intelligen collection OPERATOR PANDA Has targeted telecom and professional services entities an heavily on exploiting internet-facing appliances (such as Ci switches) for initial access VAULT PANDA Exploits web-facing applications to achieve initial access to victim networks and uses a combination of unique, shar and publicly available tools in their intrusions; targets finan services, gambling, technology, academic, defense, and government entities likely to facilitate intelligence collection operations ENVOY PANDA Targets Africa- and Middle East-based government entitie|\n|||\n\n\n## »\nTHE FINANCIAL SERVICES, MEDIA,\nMANUFACTURING, AND INDUSTRIALS\nAND ENGINEERING SECTORS ALL\nEXPERIENCED 200-300% INCREASES\nIN OBSERVED CHINA-NEXUS INTRUSIONS\nCOMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adversaries Respond to Tracking and Disruption\n\nThroughout 2024, China-nexus adversaries increasingly responded to ongoing\n\ngovernment, law enforcement, and security researcher tracking and disruption\n\nefforts by redoubling their attempts to obfuscate operations. Multiple adversaries\n\nemployed ORB networks consisting of hundreds or thousands of compromised\n\ndevices to proxy and route their traffic during intrusion operations in an attempt\n\nto maintain anonymity. Despite law enforcement attempts to disrupt the ORB\n\nnetworks, China-nexus adversaries continue to use these resources as a\n\nkey part of their operations. They also continue to share tools; for example,\n\nat least five distinct China-nexus adversaries are now using the once-unique\n\nmalware KEYPLUG.\n\n\n###### CLOUD-CONSCIOUS\n\n\n###### THREAT ACTORS CONTINUE\n\n\n###### TO INNOVATE\n\n\nIn 2024, new and unattributed cloud intrusions increased 26% compared to 2023,\n\nindicating more threat actors seek to exploit cloud services. CrowdStrike observed\n\nmore intrusions in which attackers gained initial access via valid accounts,\n\nleveraged cloud environment management tools for lateral movement, and abused\n\ncloud provider command line tools. Other cloud-conscious tactics — such as\n\nenumerating cloud infrastructure and identities and maintaining persistence via\n\nalternate authentication mechanisms — were consistent throughout 2024.\n\n###### New Cloud-Conscious Threat Actors Emerge in 2024\n\nIn 2023, prolific eCrime adversary SCATTERED SPIDER accounted for 30%\n\nof all cloud-based intrusions. This number fell to 13% in 2024, partly because\n\nnumerous nation-state and opportunistic threat actors are increasingly targeting\n\nthe cloud control plane. Many of these threat actors have adopted and employed\n\ntechniques similar to those previously used by SCATTERED SPIDER, including\n\nmoving laterally to cloud-hosted virtual machines (VMs) via management tools.\n\nThe tactics observed in these intrusions varied significantly; some threat actors\n\nopportunistically queried the cloud control plane after host-based exploitation,\n\nand others specifically targeted cloud environments via access keys with little or\n\nno host-based interaction.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cloud-Conscious China-Nexus Actors\n\nChina-nexus actors developed cloud-conscious techniques throughout 2024 and\n\nare increasingly targeting and abusing cloud environments for data collection. The\n\nincrease in unattributed cloud intrusions corresponds with an incremental increase\n\nin suspected China-nexus incidents overall. Suspected China-nexus cloud\n\nintrusions increased 6% in 2024 across multiple cloud services, including Alibaba\n\nand Azure.\n\n###### Cloud-Conscious DPRK-Nexus Actors\n\nDPRK-nexus adversary LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA consistently targeted cloud\n\nenvironments, compromising developer workstations via backdoored GitHub\n\nprojects before pivoting to the cloud by using cached credentials. FAMOUS\n\nCHOLLIMA also emerged as a cloud-conscious adversary in 2024, frequently\n\ngaining access to cloud environments as an insider threat and then establishing\n\npersistence via a backdoor administrator user.\n\n###### Access to Valid Accounts Facilitates Initial Access Techniques\n\nAbusing valid accounts has become the primary initial access vector to the cloud,\n\naccounting for 35% of cloud incidents in the first half of 2024. Attackers are\n\nincreasingly using stealth-oriented tactics and attempting to access credentials to\n\ntarget valid accounts. They do not change the credentials, which would notify the\n\nuser of illicit access. Emerging threat actors are likely to continue exploring similar\n\nmethods to access valid cloud accounts, as this allows for more reliable access to\n\ncloud environments with a lower detection risk.\n\nIn 2023, threat actors commonly obtained cloud credentials via unsecured\n\nsources such as the cloud VM Instance Metadata Service, IT development\n\nservices, or secured password storage solutions. Though this trend continued\n\ninto 2024, threat actors also began to explore other mechanisms to access valid\n\naccounts via credentials and trust relationships.\n\nOne likely initial access mechanism is leveraging information stealers; during 2024,\n\nthreat actors updated Stealc and Vidar to target cloud accounts. These stealers\n\nprovide attackers with instant access to cloud credentials and email lists that can\n\nbe leveraged for password spraying and phishing.\n\nAnother method for credential collection involves abusing trust relationships to\n\ngain access to cloud accounts. More adversaries used connections between\n\nbusiness partners and their cloud tenants to access environments without needing\n\nto obtain credentials in the victim tenant. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA capitalized on\n\nanother form of trusted relationships as an insider threat to deploy a backdoor in a\n\ncloud tenant after one of their operators was hired at the target organization. This\n\nadversary is a particularly concerning insider threat, as their operators are often\n\n\n## »\nABUSING VALID ACCOUNTS HAS\nBECOME THE PRIMARY INITIAL ACCESS\nVECTOR TO THE CLOUD, ACCOUNTING\nFOR 35% OF CLOUD INCIDENTS\nIN THE FIRST HALF OF 2024.\n\n\n-----\n\nPassword spraying techniques evolved significantly in 2024. For example, the\n\nChina-nexus ORB07 network targeted Entra ID accounts, leveraging a bug in the\n\nResource Owner Password Credentials authentication flow to validate credentials\n\nwithout logging a successful sign-in event. The threat actor then performed\n\nautomated exfiltration of all SharePoint documents (Figure 14).\n\n**ERROR: INVALID** **ERROR: VALID** **SUCCESSFUL** **AUTOMATED**\n**LOGIN** **EXFILTRATION**\n\n**INITIAL ACCESS:** **ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVE:**\n6 MINUTES, 4 SECONDS 13 MINUTES, 42 SECONDS\n\nFigure 14. ORB07 breakout time\n\nSCATERED SPIDER’s diminished operational tempo in 2024 likely accounts for\n\nthe reduced number of phishing-related cloud intrusions throughout the year.\n\nHowever, some threat actors are using AITM-based phishing, which proxies the\n\nphished user’s authentication requests to the cloud authentication service being\n\ntargeted. This allows the threat actor to prompt the user for an MFA token as well,\n\ncircumventing one of the primary cloud account security controls.\n\n###### Defense Evasion Trends\n\nSimilar to other security domains, cloud-conscious threat actors are consistently\n\n[attempting to evade defender detections and security controls. Indicator removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/)\n\ncontinues to be the most common defense evasion tactic. This tactic is primarily\n\ndriven by SCATTERED SPIDER and other adversaries hampering email-based\n\ndetection of malicious activity, a method used in approximately 75% of cases in\n\nwhich indicators were removed in the first half of 2024 and in 78% of these cases\n\nin the second half of 2023.\n\nThreat actors are also consistently attempting to evade policy-based security\n\ncontrols implemented by defenders. This is primarily done by implementing\n\nalternate MFA methods on compromised identities and bypassing cloud firewall\n\nsegmentation.\n\nIn addition to these ongoing tactics, 2024 saw the emergence and continued\n\ndevelopment of more stealthy initial access and credential collection techniques,\n\nwhich enable further defense evasion in cloud intrusions.\n\n\n**ERROR: INVALID** **ERROR: VALID** **SUCCESSFUL** **AUTOMATED**\n**LOGIN** **EXFILTRATION**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### COMMON ATTACK PATHS AND TACTICS\n\n\n-----\n\n**INITIAL ACCESS** **CREDENTIAL ACCESS**\n\nPhish for credentials\n\n**PHISHING** Credentials managers **STORED**\n\n**CREDENTIALS** Access to new accounts\n\n**VALID**\n\nActor accesses a valid account **ACCOUNT**\n\nCredentials in SaaS solutions\n\n**UNSECURED**\n\n**EXPLOIT PUBLIC-FACING** **CREDENTIALS**\n**SERVICE**\n\n**EXECUTION**\n\nCommand line tools\nfrom compromised\nVMs with cached\ncredentials VM management tools\n\n**VIRTUAL MACHINE-BASED**\n**EXECUTION**\n\nSearch for unsecured credentials on compromised infrastructure\n\n**CLOUD COMMAND**\n**LINE TOOLS**\n\n**PRIVILEGE ESCALATION**\n\nAdd identity to admin groups and roles\n\n**PRIVILEGE**\n**ESCALATION**\n\n**PERSISTENCE**\n\nAdd alternate authentication mechanism\n\n**USER IDENTITY**\n**PERSISTENCE**\n\nAdd credentials to service principal or application\n\n**PROGRAMMATIC IDENTITIES**\n\nAdd SSH keys to VM **PERSISTENCE** deploymentMalware\n\n**HOST-BASED**\n**PERSISTENCE**\n\n**DEFENSE EVASION**\n\nImpair email or cloud logging-based detection\n\n**THREAT** **DETECTION EVASION**\n**ACTOR** Tamper with identity or virtual network policies **SECURITY CONTROL**\n\n**EVASION**\n\n**DISCOVERY**\n\nEnumerate identities, groups, and roles\n\n**IDENTITY**\n**ENUMERATION**\n\nEnumerate VMs and storage solutions\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE AND**\n**STORAGE ENUMERATION**\n\n**COLLECTION**\n\nDownload data from SaaS solutions\n\n**SaaS**\n**COLLECTION**\n\nDownload data through cloud control plane\n\nThreat actor accesses cloud infrastructure **CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE**\n\n**COLLECTION**\n\ndirectly for collection\n\n**IMPACT**\n\nMining software\n\nCreate new resources for later use deployment\n\n**RESOURCE**\n**HIJACKING**\n\nRansomware\n\n**DATA ENCRYPTION/** deployment\n**DESTRUCTION/**\n**EXTORTION**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ENTERPRISING VULNERABILITY\n\n\n###### EXPLOITATION\n\n\nIn 2024, threat actors continued to target devices in the network periphery, where traditional EDR visibility\n\nis often limited. Exploiting unmanaged internet-exposed hosts, particularly network appliances, remained a\n\npopular initial access vector throughout 2024. Network appliances are attractive targets for many threat actors\n\ndue to their many unresolved security shortcomings and often deliberate exposure. Many exploits observed in\n\n2024 demonstrate that threat actors are leveraging previously established attack vectors and components to\n\nrepeatedly exploit the same products.\n\nAttackers almost certainly prefer to target vulnerabilities that directly allow for unauthenticated remote\n\ncode execution (RCE) and seek to improve their chances for success with creative and resourceful approaches.\n\nIn 2024, attackers increasingly achieved RCE using two layered approaches:\n\n###### • Chaining exploits: Combining two or more exploits to compose an attack sequence, which increases\n\ntheir capabilities and impact on the target systems\n\n###### • Abusing legitimate features: While exploits often enable initial access, attackers sometimes rely\n\non product features, such as integrated command shells, to enable RCE\n\n###### Methods to Achieve Remote Code Execution\n\n EXPLOIT A INITIAL COMPROMISE\n\n EXPLOIT B\n ABUSING LEGITIMATE FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED\n EXPLOIT CHAINING:\n COMMAND SHELLS\n EXPLOIT A AND EXPLOIT B\n\n RCE RCE\n\nFigure 16. Layered approach to achieving RCE\n\n###### Exploit Chaining\n\nIn November 2024, two notable incidents exemplified the effectiveness of exploit chains.\n\nMultiple unattributed threat actors chained a bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-0012) and privilege\n\nescalation vulnerability (CVE-2024-9474) in the Management Web Interface of Palo Alto Networks\n\nPAN-OS software. The same month, CrowdStrike Services investigated a separate campaign in\n\nwhich China-nexus adversary OPERATOR PANDA likely chained two Cisco IOS vulnerabilities —\n\na privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2023-20198) and a command injection vulnerability\n\n(CVE-2023-20273) — to target U.S. telecom and professional services entities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese examples also highlight another theme observed throughout 2024:\n\nThreat actors are leveraging vulnerabilities within the network appliance’s\n\nproprietary OS. Vulnerabilities in these OSs are appealing targets because\n\nthey potentially allow attackers to leverage one vulnerability to target multiple\n\nproducts running the same OS. These proprietary OSs are often reachable\n\nvia internet-exposed management interfaces and provide an easily identifiable\n\nattack vector, making them increasingly attractive targets.\n\nChaining two or more vulnerabilities offers attackers additional advantages.\n\nFirst, it allows attackers to achieve their primary objective, unauthenticated RCE,\n\nby combining multiple exploits into one seamless attack. These vulnerabilities\n\ncan often be packaged into a single request or exploit payload with minimal\n\ncomplexity.\n\nSecond, exploit chaining undermines the severity score-based patching process\n\nthat many enterprises follow. While the pre-authentication vulnerabilities receive\n\nout-of-band patches and are typically prioritized for deployment, associated\n\npost-authentication exploits receive less attention and may be ignored, potentially\n\nallowing the exploit to be chained with a different vulnerability at a later date to\n\nagain achieve RCE. Over time, this approach potentially increases the efficiency\n\nof RCE exploit chain development. Unless the vendor addresses the root cause of\n\nmultiple vulnerabilities, threat actors can repurpose similar techniques and quickly\n\ndevelop alternatives that bypass initial mitigations.\n\nChaining exploits can complicate efforts to efficiently remediate vulnerabilities.\n\nUnderstanding the combined effects of exploit chaining often requires more\n\nanalysis in addition to patching vulnerabilities ahead of traditional timelines,\n\npotentially resulting in patching fatigue. Security teams typically prioritize\n\npatching internet-facing services before other internal processes.\n\nHowever, depending on the specific exploit chain, certain internal-facing\n\nvulnerabilities (such as post-authentication flaws) may need to be\n\nprioritized, which may strain security teams.\n\n###### Abusing Legitimate Features Enables Effective Exploitation\n\nThroughout 2024, threat actors combined vulnerability exploitation with\n\nlegitimate feature abuse to achieve unauthenticated RCE. Microsoft SQL\n\nServer’s built-in xp_cmdshell was abused in various products to achieve RCE;\n\nthese included CVE-2023-48788 and CVE-2023-27532. Abusing the legitimate\n###### xp_cmdshell feature, which is disabled by default because of its known\n\nsecurity shortcomings, likely indicates threat actors are attempting to\n\nemploy living-off-the-land techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Continuing the Discovery, Rediscovery, and Circumvention Trend\n\nThreat actors continued to focus on previously established attack vectors and targeted similar components\n\nto achieve exploitation in 2024, continuing a trend first observed in the CrowdStrike 2023 Global Threat Report.\n\nIn several 2024 incidents, threat actors leveraged their expertise in particular products to exploit those\n\ndevices via one or more zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nFor example, in September 2024, an unknown threat actor exploited and chained a zero-day file disclosure\n\nvulnerability (CVE-2024-21287) to obtain plaintext credentials. This allowed them to target a deserialization\n\nvulnerability (CVE-2024-20953) to compromise and execute code. Though CVE-2024-20953 had been disclosed\n\nprior to this incident, neither an exploit nor substantive technical details were publicly available. Despite this,\n\nan unknown threat actor successfully reproduced a functional n-day exploit for CVE-2024-20953 and chained\n\nit with a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-21287). This incident indicates the threat actor had specialized product\n\nknowledge, which allowed them to identify a new vulnerability and ultimately compromise these devices and\n\nconduct follow-on malicious activity.\n\nAnother example of threat actors using previously established attack vectors involves the Windows local privilege\n\nescalation vulnerabilities in the mskssrv driver. During the Pwn2Own Vancouver event in March 2023, the offensive\n\nsecurity company Synacktiv exploited a logical vulnerability in the mskssrv driver (CVE-2023-29360) to escalate\n\nprivileges to SYSTEM. Since then, this previously overlooked attack surface has drawn the attention of security\n\nresearchers and threat actors, resulting in at least 16 vulnerability disclosures since August 2023.\n\n**JUNE 11, 2024**\nMicrosoft discloses five related vulnerabilities\n\n**JULY 9, 2024**\nMicrosoft discloses four related vulnerabilities\n\n**AUGUST 13, 2024**\nMicrosoft discloses four related vulnerabilities\n\n**SEPTEMBER 10, 2024**\nMicrosoft discloses CVE-2024-38245\n\n**OCTOBER 8, 2024**\nMicrosoft discloses CVE-2024-43554\n\n**OCTOBER 13, 2024**\n\n**MARCH 23, 2023** Industry researcher releases POC exploit for\nSynacktiv exploits zero-day vulnerability CVE-2024-35250 based on DEVCORE's research\n(CVE-2023-29360) during Pwn2Own Vancouver\n\n**OCTOBER 15, 2024**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 12, 2023**\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observes\n\nMicrosoft discloses CVE-2023-36802\n\nfirst CVE-2024-35250 sample in the wild\n\n**MARCH 20, 2024** **NOVEMBER 21, 2024**\nDEVCORE exploits zero-day Unknown actor attempts to execute\nvulnerability (CVE-2024-35250) during CVE-2024-35250 exploit\nPwn2Own Vancouver\n\n###### MAR SEP MAR JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV\n\nExploited in the wild\n\n###### 2023 2024\n\n|JUNE 11, 2024 Microsoft discloses five related vulnerabilities JULY 9, 2024 Microsoft discloses four related vulnerabilities AUGUST 13, 2024 Microsoft discloses four related vulnerabilities SEPTEMBER 10, 2024 Microsoft discloses CVE-2024-38245 OCTOBER 8, 2024 Microsoft discloses CVE-2024-43554 OCTOBER 13, 2024 MARCH 23, 2023 Industry researcher releases POC exploit for Synacktiv exploits zero-day vulnerability CVE-2024-35250 based on DEVCORE's research (CVE-2023-29360) during Pwn2Own Vancouver OCTOBER 15, 2024 SEPTEMBER 12, 2023 CrowdStrike Intelligence observes Microsoft discloses CVE-2023-36802 first CVE-2024-35250 sample in the wild MARCH 20, 2024 NOVEMBER 21, 2024 DEVCORE exploits zero-day Unknown actor attempts to execute vulnerability (CVE-2024-35250) during CVE-2024-35250 exploit Pwn2Own Vancouver|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\nDisclosing a vulnerability, particularly one acknowledged as exploited in the wild,\n\nhighlights potentially viable mechanisms for future exploitation. For example,\n\nin September 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple POST requests\n\nconsistent with exploiting a direct request vulnerability in Apache OFBiz\n\n(CVE-2024-45195). These POST requests mirrored CVE-2024-45195 exploitation\n\nguidance that a well-known industry source had published two weeks earlier.\n\nCVE-2024-45195 results from the option to desynchronize the requestUri\n\nand overrideViewUri variables in the RequestHandler component of\n\nthe OFBiz Java application logic.\n\nCVE-2024-45195 is similar to earlier vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-32113,\n\nCVE-2024-36104, and CVE-2024-38856) that also exploited desynchronization\n\ncapabilities to allow unauthorized users to bypass authentication mechanisms.\n\nThough the vendor has provided multiple patches and several industry sources\n\nhave publicly discussed these vulnerabilities, the core flaw persists and allows\n\nattackers to manipulate the controller-view state.\n\nSeparately, in January 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence assessed threat actors had\n\nalmost certainly leveraged CVE-2023-29324 in recent spear-phishing operations.\n\nCVE-2023-29324 bypasses Microsoft’s mitigations for a previously disclosed\n\n[Microsoft Outlook vulnerability (CVE-2023-23397), which FANCY BEAR has](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/fancy-bear)\n\nvery likely exploited since at least March 2022 to target organizations in multiple\n\nregions and sectors. The same researcher that discovered the initial bypass\n\n(CVE-2023-29324) later found another bypass (CVE-2023-35384).\n\nAn attacker can trigger both bypasses by inserting a Universal Naming\n\nConvention path into either a Server Message Block (TCP 445) or WebDAV\n\nshare on an attacker-controlled server into the MAPI property named\n###### PidLidReminderFileParameter (Figure 18).\n\n**CVE-2023-23397** \\\\<attacker-controlled domain>\\<file>.wav\n\n**CVE-2023-29324** \\\\.\\UNC\\\\<attacker-controlled domain>\\<file>.wav\n\n**CVE-2023-35384** \\\\./UNC/C://../<attacker-controlled domain>/<file>.wav\n\nFigure 18. PidLidReminderFileParameter examples showing CVE-2023-23397,\nCVE-2023-29324, and CVE-2023-35384 exploitation\n\n\n-----\n\nWhether threat actors have used either bypass in 2024 is unknown. However, these vulnerabilities underscore\n\nthat circumventing mitigations from earlier patches to target the same vulnerable components is often trivial.\n\nThese trends highlight threat actors’ evolving tactics and the challenges involved in effectively addressing\n\nvulnerabilities. Much of the exploitation activity discussed in this report occurred after the vulnerabilities\n\nwere publicly disclosed and patches became available.\n\n\n###### REDUCING THE RISK OF VULNERABILITY EXPLOITATION\n\n\n###### Network Perimeter Device Targeting\n\nIn 2024, threat actors continued to target devices on the network periphery, frequently leveraging industry\n\nvulnerability research — including disclosures, technical blogs, and POC exploits — to support their malicious\n\nactivities. This focus on perimeter devices, both opportunistic and targeted, highlighted their appeal to\n\nadversaries and underscored the urgent need for enhanced defender visibility and protection.\n\nThe breadth and scope of compromised Palo Alto Networks perimeter devices exemplify threat actors’\n\npersistence, objectives, and imagination in perimeter device exploitation.\n\nSince November 14, 2024, or earlier, at least one unidentified threat actor has chained an authentication\n\nbypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-0012) with a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2024-9474) in the\n\nManagement Web Interface of Palo Alto Networks’ PAN-OS software. The vulnerabilities’ public disclosure and\n\nsubsequent industry reporting almost certainly prompted additional threat actors to adopt the CVE-2024-0012\n\nand CVE-2024-9474 exploit chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn October 9, 2024, Palo Alto Networks disclosed five vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-9463, CVE-2024-9464,\n\nCVE-2024-9465, CVE-2024-9466, and CVE-2024-9467) affecting Expedition versions prior to 1.296.\n\nExpedition, which runs under the Linux OS, hosts and primarily facilitates a customer’s transition from a\n\nsupported vendor (Check Point, Cisco, and Juniper) to Palo Alto Networks firewalls. The vendor’s disclosure\n\nstatement acknowledged an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to read Expedition database\n\ncontents and/or write arbitrary files to temporary storage locations.\n\nOn the same day, the industry source that discovered CVE-2024-9464, CVE-2024-9465, and CVE-2024-9466\n\nreleased a technical blog providing exploitation guidance for all three vulnerabilities as well as CVE-2024-5910,\n\nwhich was previously disclosed by Palo Alto Networks in July 2024.\n\nWithin 24 hours of disclosure, CrowdStrike Intelligence captured HTTP requests consistent with CVE-2024-5910,\n\nCVE-2024-9463, and CVE-2024-9465 exploitation. Threat actors’ initial post-exploitation activities — including\n\ncryptomining, malware deployment, and basic reconnaissance — were common for opportunistic exploitation\n\nactivity. However, on October 18, 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed CVE-2024-5910 exploitation that\n\nlikely originated from two IP addresses connected to a China-nexus ORB network (Figure 19).\n\n###### KEY\n\n**JUL 10** **OCT 9** **OCT 10**\nPublic Technical Blog First Observed\nDisclosure First POC Exploitation CVE-2024-5910 CVE-2024-9465\n\nCVE-2024-9463 CVE-2024-9466\n\n**OCT 9 Public Disclosure** **OCT 10 First POC** **OCT 11 Technical Blog** **OCT 12 First Observed Exploitation**\n\n**OCT 9 Public DisclosureTechnical Blog First POC** **OCT 11 First Observed Exploitation** **OCT 18 First ORB01 Exploitation**\n\n**OCT 9 Public DisclosureTechnical Blog** **OCT 14 First Observed Exploitation Attempts**\n\n###### JUL OCT\n\n\n**JUL 10**\nPublic\nDisclosure\n\n\n###### 2024\n\n\nFigure 19. 2024 Palo Alto CVE exploitation timeline\n\nEach of the Palo Alto Networks vulnerabilities described in this section provides the necessary information and/or\n\nprivileges to facilitate malicious activity on victim networks. In particular, threat actors almost certainly leveraged\n\nthese vulnerabilities with the intent to eventually compromise Palo Alto Networks firewalls, which are attractive\n\ntargets because they are often placed in front of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) or local area networks (LANs).\n\nCompromising such devices can allow attackers to achieve the following objectives:\n\n###### • Easily conduct lateral movement across the victim’s network\n\n • Monitor, divert, or detect network traffic\n\n • Accept or drop specific network traffic\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SAAS EXPLOITATION\n\n\n###### LIKELY TO CONTINUE\n\n\nIn 2025, enterprising adversaries will undoubtedly continue to seek advanced exploitation opportunities across multiple\n\ndomains, specifically cloud-based SaaS applications, to access sensitive data and conduct lateral movement. With many\n\norganizations migrating data from on-premises systems to cloud-based services, adversaries are expected to continue\n\nto adapt their tradecraft accordingly. Throughout 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed several eCrime and targeted\n\nintrusion adversaries leverage access to cloud-based SaaS applications to obtain data to facilitate lateral movement,\n\nextortion, and downstream targeting of third parties. SaaS exploitation will therefore be a threat to watch in 2025.\n\n\n**ENABLES THREAT ACTOR TO**\n**DISTRIBUTE SMISHING MESSAGES**\n**TO THIRD PARTIES**\n\n**ENABLES THREAT ACTOR TO**\n**IDENTIFY SENSITIVE DATA**\n**FOR EXFILTRATION**\n\n**ENABLES THREAT**\n**ACTOR TO COMPROMISE**\n**PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS**\n\n\n**THREAT ACTOR** **COMPROMISED**\n**SSO IDENTITY**\n\nFigure 20.

After gaining access to an SSO account, SCATTERED\n\nSPIDER often tests access to all available SSO-integrated applications, particularly those used for chat and video\n\nconferencing, credential management, customer relationship management, document management and storage,\n\nproductivity and ticketing, and security.\n\nIn many intrusions, the adversary searched these applications for the following information:\n\n###### • Account credentials and network architecture documentation to conduct\n\nlateral movement\n\n###### • Cyber insurance and revenue information to inform extortion demands\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft 365 has also become a popular target for cloud-conscious\n\nthreat actors: SharePoint and Outlook were accessed in 22% and 17%,\n\nrespectively, of relevant intrusions in the first half of 2024. SCATTERED SPIDER\n\noften uses strings such as password manager, server inventory,\n\nand vpn instructions to search compromised SharePoint tenants and\n\nmailboxes for data that will aid further account compromise and lateral\n\nmovement to on-premises systems. Many organizations do not audit the data\n\nthat employees upload to cloud-based storage repositories (such as SharePoint)\n\nor transmit internally via email, making these resources valuable targets for\n\nadversaries seeking to pivot within victim environments.\n\nThreat actors can also leverage access to SaaS tooling to facilitate downstream\n\ntargeting of third parties. In 2024, SCATTERED SPIDER obtained API keys to\n\na commercial SMS distribution application from a compromised email inbox.\n\nThe adversary subsequently used the application to send more than 700,000\n\nSMS messages containing links to AITM phishing and cryptocurrency\n\ndrainer pages.\n\nThe eCrime threat actor tracked in industry reporting as Atlas Lion\n\nadeptly abuses SaaS applications in their gift card fraud campaigns.\n\nSimilar to SCATTERED SPIDER, Atlas Lion often gains initial access via SMS\n\nphishing (smishing), typically obtaining Microsoft 365 credentials. They use\n\ntheir access to compromised mailboxes to perform internal phishing in support\n\nof lateral movement. Atlas Lion uses access to HR-related SaaS applications\n\nto identify employees who have direct access to gift card resources and then\n\nsearches for gift card-related strings across SSO-enabled applications,\n\nincluding Microsoft 365, chat platforms, and code repositories.\n\n###### Customer Database Compromise Campaign\n\nMalicious access to SaaS applications does not always follow a broader network\n\ncompromise. In April 2024 and May 2024, a threat actor conducted a widely\n\nreported data theft and extortion campaign targeting customers of a data\n\nwarehousing platform. To access customer database instances that did not\n\nrequire MFA or other controls such as network access policies, the threat\n\nactor leveraged compromised credentials obtained from information stealer\n\nlogs that were widely available in eCrime channels and marketplaces.\n\nThis campaign targeted only the organizations’ database instances, and no\n\nlateral movement or malicious activity impacting other applications or systems\n\nwas observed. Threat actors could apply this tradecraft to steal data from other\n\npublic-facing databases or cloud storage platforms not secured by MFA.\n\nAdversaries will highly likely continue to target SaaS applications in 2025.\n\nThis assessment is made with moderate confidence based on the proliferation\n\nof eCrime activity targeting SSO accounts and other relevant identities\n\nthroughout 2024.\n\n\n## »\nMANY ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT AUDIT\nTHE DATA THAT EMPLOYEES UPLOAD TO\nCLOUD-BASED STORAGE REPOSITORIES\n(SUCH AS SHAREPOINT) OR TRANSMIT\nINTERNALLY VIA EMAIL, MAKING THESE\nRESOURCES VALUABLE TARGETS FOR\nADVERSARIES SEEKING TO PIVOT\nWITHIN VICTIM ENVIRONMENTS.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven that malicious access to SaaS applications typically begins with an identity compromise, relevant\n\ncampaigns are best mitigated by hardening accounts with MFA. To minimize the risk of adversaries such\n\nas SCATTERED SPIDER manipulating MFA, organizations should consider using number matching or\n\nhardware-based FIDO2 devices, such as YubiKeys. Moreover, organizations should enforce MFA policies\n\nwith secure verification methods across all accounts and regularly review any trusted zones or restriction\n\nexceptions to avoid unfettered access scenarios.\n\n\n###### MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\nOrganizations can further strengthen their defenses against SaaS compromise by implementing\n\nthe following mitigation strategies:\n\n###### Implement strong identity and access management (IAM)\n\n • Use MFA for all user accounts\n\n • Enforce strong password policies\n\n • Implement least-privilege access principles\n\n • Regularly review and audit user permissions\n\n Enhance data protection\n\n • Encrypt data at rest and in transit\n\n • Implement data loss prevention (DLP) solutions\n\n • Regularly back up critical data and test restoration processes\n\n Conduct regular security assessments\n\n • Audit SaaS providers to ensure compliance with relevant security frameworks\n\n Improve monitoring and incident response\n\n • Implement user behavior-based monitoring\n\n • Develop and regularly test incident response plans\n\n Educate users\n\n • Provide regular security awareness training\n\n • Teach employees to recognize phishing attempts and social engineering tactics\n\n Implement secure configuration management\n\n • Regularly review and update SaaS application settings\n\n • Disable unnecessary features and integrations\n\n Develop a robust vendor management program\n\n • Assess a SaaS provider’s security posture before adopting the software\n\n • Regularly review provider security practices and certifications\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs 2025 begins, the cybersecurity landscape continues to rapidly evolve,\n\npresenting significant challenges for organizations in all sectors and geographies.\n\nAdversaries’ resilience, innovation, and adaptability underscore the critical need\n\nfor a comprehensive understanding of today’s threats across every aspect of\n\nthe landscape.\n\nSocial engineering proliferated throughout 2024 as adversaries explored\n\nnew initial access methods to bypass security defenses. Vishing was particularly\n\npopular, with eCrime adversaries more heavily relying on vishing, callback\n\nphishing, and help desk attacks to enter target networks. This trend is\n\nexpected to continue and expand in 2025.\n\nGenAI became a key adversary tool in 2024, especially in support of social\n\nengineering campaigns and high-tempo IO campaigns. Its low barrier to entry\n\nenables adversaries to create convincing content at scale without precise\n\nprompting or model training. Though genAI is still relatively novel, CrowdStrike has\n\nidentified several examples of its use and anticipates it will be employed in 2025\n\nadversary operations.\n\nThough they are less impactful to victims than BGH adversaries, targeted eCrime\n\nadversaries remain a persistent threat to specific sectors. Throughout 2024,\n\nthese threat actors demonstrated tenacity in their targeting, often compensating\n\nfor lower sophistication by gaining in-depth knowledge about their victims'\n\nsectors, geographies, and associated technologies. Targeted eCrime adversaries\n\ndemonstrated a growing interest in Latin American targets in 2024, realizing more\n\nlucrative profits through cryptocurrency theft in that region.\n\nTargeted intrusion adversaries were also exceptionally active and innovative in\n\n2024, adapting their tactics to achieve geopolitical and strategic objectives while\n\nevading improved defensive measures. Russia-nexus adversaries are expected\n\nto continue their aggressive pursuit of victory in Ukraine, focusing primarily\n\non intelligence collection operations targeting Ukraine and NATO members.\n\nChina-nexus adversaries will likely benefit from long-term investments in cyber\n\nprograms, manifesting in increased OPSEC practices, a sustained high operational\n\ntempo, and prolific global intrusion activity. These adversaries will likely focus on\n\nentities operating in key sectors aligning with the CCP's strategic priorities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe vulnerability exploitation landscape remains a critical concern. Threat actors\n\nare expected to continue aggressively targeting devices at the network periphery,\n\nparticularly network appliances. End-of-life (EOL) product exploitation is almost\n\ncertain to continue or grow in 2025. In their continued pursuit to discover new\n\nvulnerabilities or abuse legitimate product features, adversaries will likely\n\nleverage technical blogs and operationalize public POC exploits faster than\n\nin previous years.\n\nSaaS applications are also an area of concern. After observing several eCrime\n\nand targeted intrusion adversaries use access to cloud-based SaaS applications\n\nto obtain data for lateral movement, extortion, and third-party targeting in 2024,\n\nCrowdStrike also anticipates SaaS exploitation will be a threat to watch in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, 2024 brought the emergence of threat actors who exclusively\n\ntarget cloud environments with unique, cloud-specific skill sets. Adversaries\n\nstrengthened their emphasis on defense evasion in cloud environments,\n\nadopting stealth-oriented tactics and tools for initial access and credential\n\naccess. This focus is expected to intensify in 2025.\n\nThroughout 2024, the enterprising adversary expanded the maturity and\n\nsophistication of their operations across sectors and geographies. As these\n\nthreats evolve in 2025, the CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations team\n\nremains committed to identifying, tracking, and disrupting threat actors\n\nwhenever and wherever possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThese solutions provide operators with a unified view of their cloud security posture,\n\nhelping them rapidly detect, prioritize, and remediate misconfigurations, vulnerabilities,\n\nand adversary threats. Additionally, enforcing strict access controls — such as role-based\n\naccess and conditional policies — limits exposure to critical systems and ensures continuous\n\nmonitoring for anomalies, including logins from unexpected locations.\n\nRegular audits are also critical to maintaining security. Automated tools can uncover overly\n\npermissive storage settings, exposed APIs, and unpatched vulnerabilities. Frequent reviews of cloud\n\nenvironments ensure unused permissions and outdated configurations are addressed promptly.\n\n###### Prioritize vulnerabilities with an adversary-centric approach\n\nAdversaries are increasingly exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and using exploit chaining,\n\ncombining multiple vulnerabilities to gain rapid access, escalate privileges, and bypass defenses.\n\nThese multi-stage attacks often rely on public resources like POC exploits and technical blogs, enabling\n\nadversaries to craft effective and hard-to-detect payloads.\n\nTo counter these threats, organizations must prioritize regular patching or upgrading of critical\n\nsystems, especially frequently targeted internet-facing services like web servers and VPN gateways.\n\nMonitoring for subtle signs of exploit chaining, such as unexpected crashes or privilege escalation\n\nattempts, can help detect attacks before they progress.\n\nTools like Falcon Exposure Management, built with native AI prioritization, enable teams to\n\nreduce noise and focus on the vulnerabilities that matter most, specifically those affecting critical\n\nand high-risk systems. By adopting proactive security approaches, discovering exposures across\n\nthe attack surface, and leveraging automation, organizations can mitigate sophisticated threats\n\nand limit adversary opportunities.\n\n###### Know your adversary and be prepared\n\nWhen a cyberattack unfolds in minutes — or even seconds — being prepared can be the difference\n\nbetween containment and catastrophe. An intelligence-driven approach enables security teams to\n\nmove beyond reactive defense by understanding which adversary is targeting them, how they operate,\n\nand what their objectives are. With threat intelligence, adversary profiling, and tradecraft analysis,\n\nsecurity teams can prioritize resources, adapt defenses, and actively hunt for threats before they\n\nescalate. CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence doesn’t just detect known threats — it anticipates new\n\nand evolving tradecraft, ensuring defenders are always one step ahead. By seamlessly integrating\n\nintelligence into security workflows, organizations can accelerate response times, disrupt adversaries,\n\nand turn intelligence into action.\n\nThough technology is critical to detect and stop intrusions, the end user remains a crucial link in\n\nthe chain to stop breaches. Organizations should initiate user awareness programs to combat the\n\ncontinued threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques. For security teams, practice\n\nmakes perfect. Encourage an environment that routinely performs tabletop exercises and red/blue\n\n\n-----\n\n# CrowdStrike Falcon Platform\n\n###### AI and Cloud-Native\n\nLeverages the network effect of
