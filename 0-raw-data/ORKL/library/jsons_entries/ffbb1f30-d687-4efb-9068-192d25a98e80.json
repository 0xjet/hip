The\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) an adversary uses serve as key indicators to\nthreat hunters of who might be behind an intrusion. OverWatch threat hunters uncovered an\nintrusion against a pharmaceuticals organization that bore all of the hallmarks of one of the\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) threat actor group: SILENT CHOLLIMA. For\n[further detail, download the CrowdStrike 2021 Threat Hunting Report today.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/threat-hunting-2021-report.html?utm_campaign=overwatchreport&utm_content=anz&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=goog&utm_term=threat%20hunting&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnoqLBhD4ARIsAL5JedL1vs2LXW-NphyJTS2eno9OYU-dP6p5QJN66DMnmXjWeO_lfFclDWsaAnkaEALw_wcB)\n\n## Threat Hunters Uncover SILENT CHOLLIMA’s Custom Tooling\n\nOverWatch threat hunters detected a burst of suspicious reconnaissance activity in which the\nthreat actor used the Smbexec tool under a Windows service account. Originally designed as\na penetration testing tool, Smbexec enables covert execution by creating a Windows service\nthat is then used to redirect a command shell operation to a remote location over Server\n\n\n-----\n\nMessage Block (SMB) protocol. This approach is valuable to threat actors, as they can\nperform command execution under a semi-interactive shell and run commands remotely,\nultimately making the activity less likely to trigger automated detections.\n\nAs OverWatch continued to investigate the reconnaissance activity, the threat actor used\nSmbexec to remotely copy low-prevalence executables to disk and execute them. The threat\nhunters quickly called on CrowdStrike Intelligence, who together were able to quickly\ndetermine the files were an updated variant of Export Control — a malware dropper unique\nto SILENT CHOLLIMA.\n\nSILENT CHOLLIMA then proceeded to load two further custom tools. The first was an\ninformation stealer, named GifStealer, which runs a variety of host and network\nreconnaissance commands and archives the output within individual compressed files. The\nsecond was Valefor, a remote access tool (RAT) that uses Windows API functions and\nutilities to enable file transfer and data collection capabilities.\n\n## OverWatch Contains Adversary Activity\n\nThroughout the investigation, OverWatch threat hunters alerted the victim organization to the\nmalicious activity occurring in the environment. As the situation developed, OverWatch\ncontinued to alert the organization, eventually informing them of the emerging attribution of\nthis activity to SILENT CHOLLIMA.\n\nBecause this activity originated from a host without the CrowdStrike Falcon® sensor,\nOverWatch next worked with the organization to expand the rollout of the Falcon sensor so\nthe full scope of threat actor activity could be assessed. Increasing the organization’s\ncoverage and visibility into the intrusion, threat hunters identified six additional compromised\n\n\n-----\n\nhosts. Through further collaboration with the organization, OverWatch was able to relay their\nfindings in a timely manner, empowering the organization to contain and remove SILENT\nCHOLLIMA from their network.\n\n[OverWatch discovered a service creation event that was configured to execute the Export](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/)\nControl loader every time the system reboots, allowing the threat actor to maintain\npersistence if they temporarily lose connection.\n```\nsc create [REDACTED] type= own type= interact start= auto error=ignore binpath= \"cmd\n/K start C:\\Windows\\Resources\\[REDACTED].exe\"\n\n```\nThe threat actor was also mindful to evade detection by storing their Export Control droppers\n[and archived reconnaissance data within legitimate local directories. By doing this, threat](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)\nactors attempt to masquerade the files as benign activity. The threat actor continued its\n[evasion techniques, removing traces of the collected GifStealer archives by deleting them](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004/)\nand overwriting the GifStealer binary itself using the string below. This technique is another\nhallmark of SILENT CHOLLIMA activity.\n```\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c ping -n 3 127.0.0.1 >NUL & echo EEEE >\n\"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\[REDACTED]\"\n\n## Conclusions and Recommendations\n\n```\nThe OverWatch team exposed multiple signs of malicious tradecraft in the early stages of\nthis intrusion, which proved to be vital to the victim organization’s ability to successfully\ncontain the campaign and remove the threat actor from its networks. In this instance,\nOverWatch worked with the organization to rapidly expand Falcon sensor coverage. Though\nthe Falcon sensor can be deployed and operational in just seconds, OverWatch strongly\nrecommends that defenders roll out endpoint protection consistently and comprehensively\nacross their environment from the start to ensure maximum coverage and visibility for threat\nhunters. OverWatch routinely sees security blind spots become a safe haven from which\nadversaries can launch their intrusions. The Falcon sensor was built with scalability in mind,\nallowing an organization to reach a strong security posture by protecting all enterprise\nendpoints in mere moments.\n\nThe expertise of OverWatch’s human threat hunters was pivotal in this instance, as it was the\nthreat hunters ability to leverage their expertise that allowed them to discern the SMB activity\nwas indeed malicious.\n\nFor defenders concerned about this type of activity, OverWatch recommends monitoring:\n\nService account activity, limiting access where possible\nService creation events within Windows event logs to hunt for malicious SMB\ncommands\n\n\n-----\n\nRemote users connecting to administrator shares, as well as other commands and\ntools that can be used to connect to network shares\n\nUltimately, threat hunting is a full time job. Defenders should also consider hiring a\nprofessional managed threat hunting service, like OverWatch, to secure their networks\n24/7/365.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Read about the latest trends in threat hunting and more in the 2021 Threat Hunting_\n_Report or simply_ _[download the report now.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report-2021/)_\n_[Learn more about Falcon OverWatch’s proactive managed threat hunting.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-overwatch-threat-hunting/)_\n_Discover_ _[the power of tailored threat hunting OverWatch Elite provides its customers in](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/overwatch-elite-call-escalation-vital-to-containing-attack/)_\n_this CrowdStrike blog._\n_[Watch this video to see how Falcon OverWatch proactively hunts for threats in your](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/videos/falcon-overwatch-proactively-hunts-threats-environment/)_\n_environment._\n_[Read more about how hunting part-time is simply not enough in this CrowdStrike blog.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/the-myth-of-part-time-threat-hunting-part-1/)_\n_[Learn more about the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the product webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)_\n\n\n-----",
