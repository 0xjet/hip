In\nQ2, we saw a rise of 772% in the number of botnet C&Cs\nassociated with this malware family between Q1 & Q2.\nLet’s be honest – that’s one behemoth increase!\n\n\n### QNodeService\n\n\nA malware family that is new on the scene is\nQNodeService. It first appeared in March 2020[1], and\nacts as a download for a malicious script written in the\nJavaScript framework Node.js.\n\nLooking at our records, it seems that QNodeService is\nthe very first malware-as-a-service that is using Node.js.\nUsing Java + JavaScript comes with a handful benefits\nfrom a threat actor’s perspective, including poor AV\ndetection rates and multi-OS support.\n\n\n### Emotet\n\n\nWith no activity tracked for Emotet in Q2, it dropped\noff the Top 20 list. However, at the time of writing this\nreport, we have seen Emotet’s malspam campaigns fire\nup, so we suspect Emotet will be reappearing in Q3.\n\n1https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/qnodeservice-node\njs-trojan-spread-via-covid-19-lure/\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,\n Q2 2020 (continued)\n\n\n### Malware families associated with botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Q2**\n**2020**\n\n\n**% Change**\n**Q on Q**\n\n\n**Malware**\n**Family**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n**#1** 436 772% AgentTesla Credential Stealer\n\n**#2** 290 -46% Lokibot Credential Stealer\n\n**#3** 169 New entry RedLineStealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#4** 156 51% NanoCore RAT Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#5** 112 -27% Gozi e-banking Trojan\n\n**#6** 98 -5% AZORult Credential Stealer\n\n**#7** 92 1% RemcosRAT Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#8** 74 23% njrat Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#9** 74 New entry DanaBot Credential Stealer\n\n**#10** 69 17% ArkeiStealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#11** 67 63% KPOTStealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#12** 62 New entry IcedID e-banking Trojan\n\n**#13** 61 New entry AveMaria Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#14** 55 -18% Adwind Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#15** 51 21% NetWire Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#16** 47 New entry QNodeService Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#17** 47 57% RaccoonStealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#18** 46 -4% Pony Credential Stealer\n\n**#19** 45 105% AsyncRAT Remote Access Tool (RAT)\n\n**#20** 43 New entry Zloader Loader\n\n\n**0** **100** **200** **300** **400** **500** **600**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains, Q2 2020\n\nHere are the top-level domains (TLDs) chosen\nmost frequently by botnet operators to host their\ninfrastructure on.

It is therefore\nnot surprising that there were multiple changes in our\nTop 20 listings: 6 networks dropped off our charts,\nresulting in 6 newcomers!\n\n### selectel.ru\n\nThis Russian based hosting company has been present\nin the Top 20 for a long time. However, the situation\ndeteriorated in Q2; we witnessed a 194% increase in new\nbotnet C&Cs on their network. As a result, selectel.ru has\nknocked cloudflare.com off their #1 spot.\n\n### cloudflare.com\n\nWe are delighted to see that the US CDN provider\nCloudflare improved their abuse situation in Q2, by\nreducing the number of botnet C&Cs operating on\ntheir network by 50%. This is a great effort – and we’re\nlooking forward to seeing this reduce further in the\nforthcoming quarter.\n\n### namecheap.com\n\nNamecheap, as detailed earlier in this report, is the most\nabused domain registrar when it comes to botnet C&Cs.\nSadly, Namecheap also managed to get into the Top 10\nlist of Networks hosting the most botnet C&Cs in Q2.\n\n### tencent.com\n\nThe Chinese cloud service provider Tencent was heavily\nabused by threat actors over the past two years for\nhosting botnet C&Cs. We are very pleased to see that\nTencent dropped out of our Top 20 list in Q2.\n\nWe hope that this will be a signal to their rival, Alibaba,\nalso to improve.

As a result, these dropped off the Top 20 list.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Networks hosting the most active botnet C&Cs, Q2 2020\n\nAs mentioned in the “Spotlight” section of this Update,\nwe are going to be listing network operators with the\nhighest total number of active botnets on their network\ni.e., not only botnets Spamhaus has seen for the first time\nthis quarter.\n\n\n### ghlc.biz\n\n\nThis network, according to RIPE location in the UK, was\nhosting more than 300 active botnet C&Cs by the end of\nQ2. This network shows little interest in acting upon abuse\nreports, which in turn enables botnet C&Cs to remain\nonline. Consequently, we currently consider this network\nas “bulletproof” and have added it to the Spamhaus Do\nnot Route Or Peer (DROP)[3] List, advising our users not to\naccept any traffic to or from this network.\n\n\n### inter-cloud.tech\n\n\nThe situation at inter-cloud.tech is similar to ghlc.biz. This\nnetwork rarely takes positive actions in relation to abuse\nreports, allowing botnet C&Cs to remain on their network.\nAs a result, their network ranges (prefixes) are also listed\non Spamhaus DROP.\n\n### fink.org\n\nAt the end of Q2, we calculated there close to 100 active\nbotnet C&Cs on this network, mostly associated with\nRemote Access Tools (RATs).\n\n### Cloud providers\n\nSurprisingly, the two cloud providers Microsoft (Azure)\nand Google (Compute Engine) are hosting, compared to\nothers, a large number of active botnet C&Cs.\n\nOur experience has shown that getting a response\nfrom them on abuse reports is sometimes difficult. This\nillustrates one of the reasons why they have a large\nnumber of active botnet C&Cs in their network.\n\n3https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/\n\n\n-----\n\n## Networks hosting the most active botnet C&Cs, Q2 2020 (continued)\n\n\n### Total number of active botnet C&Cs per network\n\n\n**Rank** **Botnet C&Cs** **Network** **Country**\n\n**#1** 349 ghlc.biz Russia\n\n**#2** 130 inter-cloud.tech Ukraine\n\n**#3** 99 fink.org Switzerland\n\n**#4** 53 digitalocean.com United States\n\n**#5** 47 combahton.net Germany\n\n**#6** 40 endurance.com United States\n\n**#7** 36 mail.ru Russia\n\n**#8** 34 google.com United States\n\n**#9** 30 microsoft.com United States\n\n**#10** 26 claro.com.co Colombia\n\n**#11** 24 ipjetable.net France\n\n**#12** 22 pointtoserver.com Hong Kong\n\n**#12** 22 eurobyte.ru Russia\n\n**#14** 21 inmotionhosting.com United States\n\n**#15** 20 dtln.ru Russia\n\n**#15** 20 avguro.com Russia\n\n**#17** 19 invs.ru Russia\n\n**#17** 19 cnt.gob.ec Ecuador\n\n**#17** 19 une.net.co Colombia\n\n**#20** 18 volumedrive.com United States\n\n### We look forward to seeing you in October, with Q3’s update.
