Through analysis of malicious\ncode, files, and infrastructure it is clear the group behind this campaign is either directly\nresponsible for or has cooperated with the group which conducted Operation Blockbuster\nSequel and, ultimately, [Operation Blockbuster (originally outlined by researchers from](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\nNovetta). The threat actors are reusing tools, techniques, and procedures which overlap\nthroughout these operations with little variance. Attacks originating from this threat group\nhave not ceased since our previous report (from April of 2017) and have continued through\nJuly of 2017.\n\n## New Activity\n\nRecently, we’ve identified weaponized Microsoft Office Document files which use the same\nmalicious macros as attacks from earlier this year. Based on the contents of these latest\ndecoy documents which are displayed to a victim after opening the weaponized document\n\n\n-----\n\nthe attackers have switched targets from Korean language speakers to English language\nspeakers. Most notably, decoy document themes now include job role descriptions and\ninternal policies from US defense contractors.\n\nThe following image shows the content of one of the recent decoy documents\n(de2d458c8e4befcd478a0010789d80997793790b18a347d10a595d6e87d91f34). It is a job\ndescription at a defense contractor.\n\nThe following images also shows the contents of a recent decoy document\n(062aadf3eb69686f4881860d88ce472e6b1c07e1f586d840dd2ee1f7b76cabe7). It contains\nan exact copy of a publicly available job description, including typos, at a US defense\ncontractor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe weaponized documents have been hosted on systems which we believe have likely\nbeen compromised and repurposed. Two of the URL paths used to host the weaponized\ndocuments on the compromised systems are exact matches\n(event/careers/jobs/description/docs). The payloads delivered by the weaponized documents\nare extremely similar to the payloads delivered by weaponized documents detailed in our\n[April 2017 report on the threat group's activity.](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-the-blockbuster-sequel/)\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between samples and\ninfrastructure used in the recent activity see the following network graph.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document metadata Author \"ISkyISea\" is used across multiple weaponized document\nfiles. IPv4 addresses (210.202.40[.]35) hosting the weaponized documents have also been\nhardcoded as command and control servers for previous samples\n(16c3a7f143e831dd0481d2d57aae885090e22ec55cc8282009f641755d423fcd).\n\n## Ties to Blockbuster\n\nThe source code used in the macros embedded in the weaponized documents described\n[above was also detailed in a previous report where it was included in testing documents](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-the-blockbuster-sequel/)\nuploaded to VirusTotal. This reuse of macro source code, XOR keys used within the macro to\ndecode implant payloads, and the functional overlap in the payloads the macros write to disk\ndemonstrates the continued use of this tool set by this threat group. The use of an\nautomated tool to build the weaponized documents would explain the common but not\nconsistent reuse of metadata, payloads, and XOR keys within the documents.\n\nOther similarities between the previously reported activity and this new activity can be seen\nwithin the PE payloads written to disk by the malicious documents. The payloads function\nsimilarly to other implants associated with this threat group. The use of a fake TLS\ncommunications protocol, encoded strings within samples, filenames and contents of batch\n\n\n-----\n\nfiles embedded within implants, as well implants beaconing directly to IPv4 addresses (and\nnot resolving domains for command and control) are all known techniques associated with\nthe threat group. These tactics have changed very little since the original Operation\nBlockbuster.\n\nIn addition to tool reuse, infrastructure overlaps also exist. URLs used for hosting the\nmalicious documents and IPv4 addresses used for command and control overlap with\ninfrastructure previously used by the group.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe techniques and tactics the group uses have changed little in recent attacks. Tool and\ninfrastructure overlaps with previous campaigns are apparent. Given that the threat actors\nhave continued operations despite their discovery and public exposure it is likely they will\ncontinue to operate and launch targeted campaigns.\n\nPalo Alto Networks researchers will continue to monitor this group’s activities and stay\nabreast to additional attacks using this tool set.\n\nThe malicious files describe in this report are flagged as malicious by WildFire and in\nThreat Prevention.\nAutoFocus users can learn more about the threat group and their indicators by\n[examining the BlockBuster_Sequel tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA256**\n\n4d4465bd9a57c7a3c0b80fa3282697554a1419794afa36e544a4ae06d60c1615\n\nf390ef86a4ad92dde125c983e6470f08344b9eaa14c17a1e6c4bb7ebfa7c4ec9\n\nacfae7e2fdda02e81b3e03f8c30741744d629cd672db424027f7caa59c975897\n\n7429a6b6e8518a1ec1d1c37a8786359885f2fd4abde560adaef331ca9deaeefd\n\ne09224a24a14a08c6fcb79b00b4a7b3097c84f805f5f2adefe2f7d04d7b4a8ee\n\n062aadf3eb69686f4881860d88ce472e6b1c07e1f586d840dd2ee1f7b76cabe7\n\nc63a415d23fc4ab10ad3acfdd47d42b5c7444604485ab45147277cca82fffb34\n\n16c3a7f143e831dd0481d2d57aae885090e22ec55cc8282009f641755d423fcd\n\nde2d458c8e4befcd478a0010789d80997793790b18a347d10a595d6e87d91f34\n\n2f133525f76ab0ebb0b370601673361253074c337f0b0895d0f0cb5bc261cfcb\n\n\n-----\n\ne83a08bcb4353bfd6edcdedbc9ead9ab179a620e15155b60d18153bed9892f38\n\n6f673981892701d42159489c1b2614c098a04e4674b23e1cd0fd8911766e71a0\n\nad075279d2ee6958105889d852e0d7f4266f746cb0078ac1b362f05a45b5828d\n\n1288e105c83a6f4bbad8471a9b5bedafeea684a8d8b73a1a7518137d446c2e1e\n\n**IPv4**\n\n104.192.193[.]149\n\n176.35.250[.]93\n\n213.152.51[.]169\n\n108.222.149[.]173\n\n197.246.6[.]83\n\n118.140.97[.]6\n\n210.202.40[.]35\n\n59.90.93[.]97\n\n107.6.12[.]135\n\n**URLs**\n\nhttp://210.202.40[.]35/CKRQST/event/careers/jobs/description/docs/NGC1398.doc\n\nhttp://210.202.40[.]35/CKRQST/Company/HR/Position/lm/L1915.doc\n\nhttp://104.192.193[.]149/Event/careers/jobs/description/docs/LJC077.doc\n\nhttp://lansingturbo[.]org/docs/WebDAV.exe\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
