The](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.ave_maria)\nattackers delivered a variety of lures to their targets, predominantly posing as guides related\nto Indian governmental infrastructure and operations such as Kavach and I.T.-related guides\nin the form of malicious Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) and archives (RARs, ZIPs)\ncontaining loaders for the RATs.\n\nApart from artifacts involved in the infection chains, we've also discovered the use of serverside scripts to carry out operational tasks such as sending out malicious emails and\nmaintaining presence on compromised sites via web shells. This provides additional insight\ninto the attacker's operational TTPs.\n\nSome of these lures and tactics utilized by the attackers bear a strong resemblance to the\n[Transparent Tribe and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html) [SideCopy APT groups, including the use of compromised websites](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\nand fake domains.\n\n## How did it work?\n\nThis campaign uses a few distinct, yet simple, infection chains. Most infections use a maldoc\nthat downloads and instruments a loader. The loader is responsible for downloading or\ndecrypting (if embedded) the final RAT payload and deploying it on the infected endpoint. In\nsome cases, we've observed the use of malicious archives containing a combination of\nmaldocs, loaders and decoy images. The RAT payloads are relatively unmodified, with the\ncommand and control (C2) IPs and domains being the most pivotal configuration information.\n\n## So what?\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign illustrates another instance of a highly motivated threat actor using a set of\ncommercial and commodity RAT families to infect their victims. These RATs are packed with\nmany features out-of-the-box to achieve comprehensive control over the infected systems. It\nis also highly likely that these malware families establish footholds into the victim's networks\nto deploy additional plugins and modules.\n\n## Infection chains\n\nThe earliest instance of this campaign was observed in December 2020 utilizing malicious\nMicrosoft Office documents (maldocs). These maldocs contain malicious VBA macros that\ndownload and execute the next stage of the infection — the malware loader.\n\nThe maldocs' content ranges from security advisories, to meeting schedules, to software\ninstallation notes. These maldocs contain malicious macros that download and execute the\nnext stage payload on the victim's endpoint. The final payload is usually a RAT that can\nperform a multitude of malicious operations on the infected endpoint.\n\nThe maldocs pose as documents related to either meeting schedules pertinent to the victims,\nor as technical guides related to the Government of India's IT infrastructure. It is likely that\nthese files are either delivered as attachments or links in spear-phishing emails where the\nverbiage is meant to social engineer the victims into opening the maldoc attachments or\ndownloading them from an attacker-controlled link.\n\nSome file names used are:\n\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-1.docm\nSecurity-Updates.docm\nOnline meeting schedule for OPS.doc\nschedule2021.docm\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, we ve observed the use of Kavach-themed maldocs and binaries being used in\nrecent SideCopy attacks.\n\nMalicious macro in maldoc downloading and executing the next stage payload.\n\n### Stage 2 — Loaders\n\nThe payload is usually loader binaries aimed at instrumenting the final malware payload.\nThese loaders will use either of the following techniques to instrument the final malware\npayloads on the endpoint:\n\nDownload payload from remote location and activate using process hollowing into itself\nor a target process.\nDecode embedded payload and activate using process hollowing.\n\nDepending on the variants, the loaders may also perform the following peripheral activities:\n\nDisable AMSI scanning by patching the first six bytes of the \"AmsiScanBuffer\" API.\nSet up persistence via registry for the next stage malware payload dropped to disk\nusing the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run keys.\n\n**Downloaders**\n\nThroughout March and April 2021, the attackers utilized downloaders to download and\n\n\n-----\n\nexecute the RAT payloads from remote locations. The earliest versions of this loader used\nRunPE DLLs to inject the malware payloads into a specified target process via hollowing.\n\n.NET loader utilizing RunPE.dll to inject AveMaria RAT payload into InstallUtil.exe.\n\nIn May 2021, the attackers used the next iteration of their C#-based downloader that reaches\nout to a decoy URL and only proceeds with execution if the communication process fails.\n\nDownloader reaching out to a decoy URL and executing actual functionality in the catch code\nblock.\n\nThis downloader then proceeds to patch the \"AmsiScanBuffer\" API, establishes persistence\nfor the next stage payload and invokes it at the end. The payload in the next stage consists\nof legitimate .NET-based applications trojanized with the ability to decrypt and deploy the\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwireRAT malware.\n\nAMSI bypass, persistence and invocation by the loader.\n\n\n-----\n\nToward the beginning of June 2021, the attackers started experimenting with the use of\nPastebin as a payload-hosting platform. The downloader reached out to a Pastebin URL via\ncURL to download and inject the payload into its own running process.\n\nEvolution of the downloaders:\n\n**Loaders with embedded payloads**\n\nThe attackers modified open-source projects with code to load trojanized .NET-based\nbinaries as loaders for the RATs dating as far back as December 2020. One of the droppers\nwe analyzed is based on the Pangantucan Community High School library management\nsystem application.\n\nIt is likely that the loader is based on a crypter available to the attackers since we've\n[observed other crimeware families such as Formbook use similar loaders to infect their](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.formbook)\ntargets.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe original application Initialization code for Form1.\n\nThe same function in the trojanized version calls a constructor to the added ISectionEntry\nclass.\n\nThe loader modified the Login form with a call to a function that loads a DLL loader with the\nassembly name \"SimpleUI.\" The second-stage loader is extracted from the .NET resource\nwith the name \"Draw.\" The assembly extracted from the Draw resource is responsible for\ndecoding and loading a Netwire injector module which is stored as the AuthorizationRule\nbitmap resource in the original trojanized loader.\n\n\n-----\n\nAutorizationRule blob parsed as a bitmap image (464,147 bytes long).\n\nThe injector is responsible for deploying the netwireRAT binary present in its .NET resources\ninto a target process, such as vbc.exe.\n\n### Stage 3 — Final payloads\n\nThe Netwire and AveMaria RAT families are eventually downloaded and executed on the\nvictim machine. In some cases, we've also discovered the deployment of custom .NETbased file enumerator modules that generate and exfiltrate file path listings of specific file\nextensions on the infected systems.\n\n### Maldoc infection chain variation\n\nIn one instance, the attackers used a different variation of the infection chain that starts with\na malicious document delivered to the victim. The macro in the maldoc downloads and\nexecutes a VBScript (VBS) instead of directly downloading the malware payload.\n\nThe VBS contains many junk comments interlaced with the actual malicious code. The\nmalicious code will execute an encoded PowerShell command to download the next payload.\n\nThe PowerShell downloads a malicious archive and an unzip utility such as 7-Zip from a\nremote location. This utility unzips and runs the malware payload from the archive file. An\nexample of the command used to unzip the archive is:\n\n7za.exe x -y -aoa -bso0 -bse0 -bb0 -bd <archive_file_path>\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoded PowerShell commands to activate the next-stage payload.\nInfection chain diagram:\n\nThe final payload in this infection chain is a loader for AveMariaRAT.\n\n### Archive-based infections\n\nIn other infection attempts dating as far back as December 2020, the attackers hosted\nmalicious ZIP archives containing malware payloads on compromised websites. It is likely\n\n\n-----\n\nthat the URLs to these archive files were sent to victims to make them download and open\nthe malware payload on their endpoints.\n\nThree distinct archives containing the malicious payloads.\n\nThe malicious binaries from the archives found thus far load and instrument NetwireRAT.\n\n## Payload Analysis\n\n### NetwireRAT\n\nNetwire is a highly versatile RAT consisting of multiple capabilities including:\n\nStealing credentials from browsers.\nExecute arbitrary commands.\nGather system information.\nFile management operations such as write, read, copy, delete files, etc.\nEnumerate, terminate processes.\nKeylogging.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwireRAT keylogger.\n\n### Ave Maria/WarzoneRAT\n\nAve MariaRAT, also known as WarzoneRAT, is a commercial RAT available for purchase to\nmalicious operators although there are cracked versions of Warzone available online.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWarzoneRAT capabilities (snip) as advertised by its authors.\n\nLike Netwire, WarzoneRAT is also packed with a variety of functionalities including:\n\nRemote desktop.\nWebcam capture.\nCredential stealing from browsers and email clients.\nFile management operations such as write, read, copy, delete files etc.\nExecute arbitrary commands.\nKeylogging.\nReverse shells.\nEnumerate, terminate processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nReverse shell functionality in WarzoneRAT.\n\n### File enumerators\n\nApart from the two RATs, we've also observed specialized reconnaissance malware being\ndeployed on the victim's endpoints instead of a RAT family. The attackers deployed a\npreliminary recon tool to enumerate specific folders looking for certain file extensions. The\nfile listings/paths found are uploaded to an attacker-controlled C2 server.\n\nThe locations targeted were:\n\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\Downloads\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\Desktop\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\Documents\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\OneDrive\\Downloads\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\OneDrive\\Documents\\\n\nThe file extensions searched for were:\n\n.txt, .doc, .dot, .wbk, .docx, .docm, .dotx, .dotm, .docb, .xls, .xlt, .xlm, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xltx, .xltm,\n.xlsb, .xla, .xlam, .xll, .xlw, .ppt, .pot, .pps, .pptx, .pptm, .potx, .potm, .ppam, .ppsx, .ppsm,\n\n\n-----\n\n.sldx, .sldm, .pdf\n\nFile enumerator malware module looking for specific file extensions.\n\n## Analyses and observations\n\n### Targeting\n\nAn extremely common theme of maldocs and archives discovered in this campaign refers to\nthe Government of India's Kavach application. This is a two-factor authentication (2FA)\napplication used by government employees to access their emails. This theme has been\nused recently by the SideCopy APT's campaigns targeting Indian government personnel, as\nwell. Some of the malicious artifacts using the Kavach theme in the current campaign are\nnamed:\n\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-1.docm\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER1.5.docm\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-3.docm\nkavach-2-instructions.zip\nkavach-2-instructions.exe\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-V3.zip\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-V3.exe\n\nOther file names indicating targeting of military and government personnel consist of:\n\nCONFD-PERS-Letter.docm\nPERS-CONFD-LETTER.exe\nAdmiral Visit Details CONFD exe\n\n\n-----\n\nPay and Allowance Details.xls\n\n**Compromised websites**\n\nThe attackers have relied on a combination of compromised websites and fake domains to\ncarry out their operations — a tactic similar to that of the Transparent Tribe APT group.\nHowever, what stands out in this campaign is the focus on compromising quasi-military or\ngovernment-related websites to host malicious payloads. This might have been done to\nappear legitimate to victims and analysts.\n\nFor example, the attackers compromised and maintained access to a quasi-defense-related\nwebsite dsoipalamvihar[.]co[.]in belonging to the Defence Services Officers' Institute (DSOI)\nusing it to host netwireRAT-related payloads since January 2021. In another instance, the\nattackers compromised the website for the Army Public Schools of India (apsdigicamp[.]com)\nto host a variety of malicious archives serving NetwireRAT again.\n\nOn the other hand, the attackers used a fake domain govrn[.]xyz in July 2021 to host\nmaldocs for their infection chains.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious scripts and payloads hosted on a compromised website.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nThe compromised websites were used heavily to host artifacts from maldocs to RATs.\nHowever, these websites hosted a few other malicious artifacts as well. The artifacts scripts\nwere used as:\n\nEmailers.\nWeb shells.\n[CSRF PoC generator.](https://github.com/merttasci/csrf-poc-generator)\nFile uploaders.\n\nNone of these scripts have been written from scratch or customized heavily by the attackers.\nThis practise is in sync with their RAT deployments — neither the RAT payloads nor the\ninfrastructure scripts have been modified except their configurations. The actual effort\ninstead is put into social engineering and infecting victims.\n\n**Proliferation through emails**\n\nA variety of mailers have been used by the attackers to proliferate the maldocs, archives and\ndownload links:\n\nTeamCC ninjaMailer v1.3.3.7\nLeaf PHPMailer 2.7\nLeaf PHPMailer 2.8\n\nThese PHP-based scripts are capable of configuring SMTP options and generating spearphishing emails that can be distributed to victims with malicious payloads or links.\n\n\n-----\n\nTeamCC NinjaMailer hosted by the attackers on one of the compromised sites.\n\n**Administration**\n\nThe attackers utilized two types of management scripts to administer the compromised\nwebsites. PHP and Perl-based web shells maintain browser-based access to the sites and\nperform administrative actions such as file management, process management and viewing\nfile contents. The web shells used are:\n\nPhpSpy\nb374k 2.7\nOlder b374k web shell\n\nb374k web shell's login page on the compromised site.\n\n\n-----\n\nOlder Perl-based b374k web shell hosted on a compromised site.\n\nThe attackers also deployed a file uploader utility (created by \"Pakistan Haxors Crew\") to\nupload files to the sites without having to go through the web shells.\n\nFile uploader.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign has been ongoing since the end of 2020 and continues to operate today. The\nattackers initially deployed Netwire and Warzone RATs on the infected endpoints. The use of\nthese RATs benefits an adversary twofold — it makes attribution difficult and saves the effort\nto create bespoke implants. Beginning in July 2021, however, we observed the deployment\nof the file enumerators alongside the RATs. This indicates that the attackers are expanding\ntheir malware arsenal to target their victims: military and government personnel in India.\n\nInfection tactics including government-themed lures, deployment of commodity/commercial\nRATs and file enumerators and the use of compromised and attacker-owned domains\nindicates a strong resemblance to SideCopy and Transparent Tribe.\n\nUnlike many crimeware and APT attacks, this campaign uses relatively simple,\nstraightforward infection chains. The attackers have not developed bespoke malware or\ninfrastructure management scripts to carry out their attacks, but the use of prebaked artifacts\ndoesn't diminish the lethality of these attacks. In fact, ready-made artifacts such as\ncommodity or cracked RATs and mailers allow the attackers to rapidly operationalize new\ncampaigns while focusing on their key tactic: tricking victims into infecting themselves.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
