An Emsisoft malware\nanalyst, which took a look at the BlackCocaine/EpsilonRed sample, recommended that\ncompanies to reach out in case of an attack, as there might be ways to recover files under\ncertain conditions.\n\nTags\n\n[BlackCocaine](https://therecord.media/tag/blackcocaine/)\n[EpsilonRed](https://therecord.media/tag/epsilonred/)\n[Finance](https://therecord.media/tag/finance/)\n[India](https://therecord.media/tag/india/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[security breach](https://therecord.media/tag/security-breach/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
