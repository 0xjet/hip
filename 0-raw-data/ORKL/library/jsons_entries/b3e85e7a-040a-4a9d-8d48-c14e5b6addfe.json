Other malware\ncomes through \"drive-by downloads\" from compromised or malicious websites. Now one\nattacker is using legitimate bulk email services to spread the Nymaim Trojan, an alarming\nshift that could make such attacks harder to detect.\n\nNymaim is a 2-year-old strain of malware most closely associated with ransomware. We\nhave seen recent attacks spreading it using an established email marketing service provider\nto avoid blacklists and detection tools. But instead of ransomware, the malware is now being\nused to distribute banking Trojans.\n\nOriginally observed in 2013, the Nymaim Trojan was installing ransomware before file[encrypting malware was making headlines and extorting money from people, hospitals, and](http://proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Dridex-Actors-Get-In-the-Ransomware-Game-With-Locky)\n[even the police. At that time, Nymaim was largely distributed via the Black Hole Exploit Kit](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/police-pay-off-ransomware-operators-again/d/d-id/1319918)\n(BHEK) as a \"drive-by download.” Later, the actors behind the distribution of Nymaim began\nmanipulating search results so that sites compromised with BHEK were more likely to get\nclicks. By 2014, researchers found machines infected with Nymaim that also contained\ntraces of other malware including Vawtrak, Miuref, Pony, and Ursnif.\n\nAlthough most famously associated with early ransomware, Nymaim is, at its core, a\ndownloader Trojan that can be used to install a variety of malware. Recently, we have been\ntracking new vectors and payloads for Nymaim, with multiple campaigns utilizing email to\nsend document attachments or URLs leading to documents. When users open one of these\ndocuments, the macros download and install Nymaim. Then, in most cases, Nymaim installs\nthe [Ursnif banking Trojan on vulnerable PCs.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Win32%2FUrsnif)\n\nThe emails include links from legitimate domains used by the service provider but redirect\nusers to malicious macro-embedded documents to deliver Nymaim. It is unclear whether the\nthreat actors are using a compromised account on the email marketing service or signed up\n\n\n-----\n\nfor a free trial. In either case, the trend marks a departure from their usual reliance on\nbotnets—and could make them harder to detect.\n\n_Figure 1: Lure leveraging email marketing service_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious document downloaded from link shown in Figure 1_\n\nNot surprisingly, using a well-known email marketing service can improve the effectiveness\nof the attacks by improving link reputation, keeping senders on whitelists, and bypassing\nsampling by multiple security vendors who deliberately exclude bulk mailing services.\n\nIn other campaigns, Nymaim is being delivered through even more circuitous means. On\nFebruary 17, for example, we tracked a malicious document attachment campaign in which\nMicrosoft Word documents attached to emails with subjects \"February payment\" or \"Fedex\nDelivery Notification\" used macros to drop Pony onto PCs.\n\nPony is a Trojan with credential-stealing capabilities. In this case it is used to download\nNymaim, which in turn may then download other malware such as Ursnif.\n\nEmail is the top vector for delivering Nymaim in these recent campaigns (whether via\nattached malicious documents or links to malicious URLs). We have identified two other\ninteresting features in these new campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\nNymaim still appears to be using some of the same web injects (hence targeting the\nsame organizations) as it did in campaigns from 2013 and 2014, even while actors are\nemploying other means (like VBA macros) to deliver the malware.\nNymaim is heavily obfuscating both its own functions and that of its payload (at least in\nthe case of Ursnif) in memory. This move makes analyzing and reverse-engineering it\nharder.\n\nIn Figure 3, Nymaim is monitoring and replacing content of a banking website while the user\nis browsing it. This screenshot shows traffic generated by the malware to its injection control\nIP address 31.184.234[.]21. The malware reports that the user is visiting a banking site. It\nthen receives instructions on how to modify and replace content to initiate fraud on the user’s\naccount.\n\n_Figure 3: Nymaim web injection_\n\nNymaim is hardly new. But these campaigns bring some new approaches to the table.\nAbusing an email marketing service brings a number of benefits to the actors and leaves\nmany recipients potentially more vulnerable to attack. It's possible to blacklist IP addresses\nassociated with the botnets that typically distribute malware via email. But in this case, the\ncampaign uses a known \"good\" mail distribution vector.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithout more advanced analysis in a sandbox environment, these kinds of attacks are\ndifficult to catch. At the same time, actors are leveraging Nymaim's capabilities as a loader\nand its flexibility to distribute the latest banking Trojans.\n\nIn other words, what is old is new again, and Nymaim has been revitalized to meet current\ndemands from threat actors.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n_Sample hashes (Documents that download Nymaim):_\n\nce0c220603d23fbb072f91a6a813c07e0c1d02559f54f9899d3d3be1db6d8851\n617f3001d64cfc1edb3ccd70a084f888a34cb7f2e39d92e0685461baa23a4e5d\nc788fd4cae05844344b04629d97be324d1f85dbefdfc8352489154341f888aa9\n18e2461c250aaada1847b2aba8aef43f7686477f11b64e7597c325ee557f5128\n3e522c5873f976078e2c31681771640c73ee8a4e192ecbbcf6fe4e8b3a486920\nd78e20396efc39af29717d8dcceaf48a241ebd36a2f89d0c903ecf81fa9f5d0c\n5cdf41ef8cc330a5ea7fa06de6e220afdd8c2d5b708041296801f45bcafa16e3\nd4e3fb25f0d397967f1e88baffb97cfd6f40953d0c9f998d1c4694d1982d2d65\n8efdfcf63f1dbfa9666bce23246f49c5788ec8c8edacc722038d9110375d89b5\ne5c5385b79743ced00adebc0daae5fa619cf3836417bc2b0379f98a24f81c4bb\nc0515052e8bc2e2772b29cbb694e72af9a6c2be8ebceba5766bcdaf26fe955da\nb5b6b37f28dc16bbbac8df75af51f66436f7a4b4dec7ee3d911fb2601c1bb3b5\n642420b08d6333b8cf48014b62c60f9bd1f51be4b3c00b6023e824987d177b73\n\n_Distribution domains (domains hosting documents that download Nymaim):_\n\n[hxxp://intuit.secureserver17[.]com/invoices/Invoice_897-84579.doc]\n\n[hxxp://secure.secureserver17[.]com/invoices/Invoice_11471.doc]\n\n[hxxp://quickbooks.intuit-invoices[.]com/invoices/qb_invoice_1147630.doc]\n\n_Distribution domains (domains hosting Nymaim payload):_\n\ndalinumsdeli42[.]com/posts/dli506.exe\nwww.billpay-center[.]com/invoices/007448322.doc\nforget42gibb[.]com/post/506pblpks.exe\nfini4kbimm[.]com\nforget42gibb[.]com\ngrotesk14file[.]com\nintro12duction1[.]com\nfiniki45toget[.]com\njoreshi50indo[.]com\nepay-solution[.]com\nbillpay-center[.]com\namoretaniintrodano36[ ]com\n\n\n-----\n\namoretanioontradano37[.]com\namoretanoenntrodano38[.]com\namoretanoentrodano33[.]com\namoretanointrodanio39[.]com\namoretanointrodano31[.]com\namoretanoontrodano34[.]com\namoretanopintrodano40[.]com\namoretanopntrodano35[.]com\namoretanountrodano32[.]com\ndalinamsdela41[.]com\ndalinamsdele45[.]com\ndalinamsdelo43[.]com\ndalinamsdelu44[.]com\ndalinamsdelu46[.]com\ndalinumsdeli42[.]com\nsecureserver17[.]com\n\n_Nymaim Sample SHA256 Hashes:_\n\n834ce4c3f3b1a4086d906e24ebf7e6028be81daeb84975f4c507c1cdcb08b2bc\n1a71f4090a95e643caa4cc5723da5d8cf1a24c8cd3caa95f496f1f2810df46ac\n0f62b83a7bdcf4ac5e0f8beccc2b86290ba7432a46cdcdaa5ad21dd4ad2785ee\n\n_Nymaim C2:_\n\n[hxxp://viestisete[.]com/kz49uagxyo/index.php]\n\n[hxxp://mcwcly[.]com/zzpwgdu/index.php]\n\n[hxxp://67.211.221[.]36/zzpwgdu/index.php]\n\n[hxxp://89.163.247[.]186/zzpwgdu/index.php]\n\n[hxxp://94.125.120[.]12/zzpwgdu/index.php]\n\n[hxxp://eoquecwpt[.]com/16lqp/index.php]\n\n_Pony C2:_\n\n[hxxp://sinmoughhin[.]ru/gate.php]\n\n[hxxp://jotertdinthap[.]ru/gate.php]\n\n[hxxp://rinuntinand[.]ru/gate.php]\n\n_Pony Downloads:_\n\n[hxxp://opulencebeautique[.]com/system/logs/webmail.exe]\n\n[hxxp://dulichhanoihalongsapa[.]com/system/logs/webmail.exe]\n\n[hxxp://properenglishtraining[.]co[.]za/wp-content/plugins/cached_data/webmail.exe]\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
