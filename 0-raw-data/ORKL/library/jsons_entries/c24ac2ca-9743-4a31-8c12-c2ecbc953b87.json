In all likelihood, Thrip and Billbug now appear to be one and the\nsame.\n\n\"Thrip APT group hits targets in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,\nVietnam https://symc.ly/2m4FiUv\"\n\n## Ambitious targets\n\nSince we last published on Thrip in June 2018, the group has attacked at least 12 organizations,\nall located within South East Asia. Its targets have been located in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia,\nMalaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\nThe group has attacked a diverse range of targets over the past year, most notably military\ntargets in two different countries. It has also attacked organizations in the maritime\ncommunications, media, and education sectors.\n\nThrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of\nactivity dating to as recently as July 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the most alarming discoveries we made in our original Thrip research was that the group\nhad targeted a satellite communications operator and seemed to be interested in the operational\nside of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitored and\ncontrolled satellites. Significantly, Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite\ncommunications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019.\n\n## New malware provides more leads\n\nMuch of this recent activity was uncovered by Symantec following the discovery of a Thrip tool, a\nbackdoor called Hannotog which appears to have been used since at least January 2017. It was\nfirst detected in an organization in Malaysia, where it triggered an alert for suspicious WMI activity\n[with our Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology, available in Symantec Endpoint Detection](https://resource.elq.symantec.com/LP=5847?cid=70138000001MFtXAAW)\nand Response (EDR).\n\nFigure 1. Hannotag was first discovered when it triggered a Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) alert\nfor suspicious WMI activity\n\nTAA leverages artificial intelligence in order to comb through Symantec’s vast data and spot\npatterns associated with targeted attacks. It is capable of automatically flagging incidents that\nwould otherwise have taken thousands of hours of analyst time to identify.\n\nTAA allowed us to uncover Hannotog and from there, our expert threat hunting team built out a\nprofile of the adversary’s tools, tactics, and procedures. This allowed us to identify other\norganizations that have been compromised by Thrip, allowing us to build up a complete picture of\nthe group’s most recent activities.\n\nHannotog is a custom backdoor which provides the attackers with a persistent presence on the\nvictim’s network. It has been used in conjunction with several other Thrip tools, including\nSagerunex, another custom backdoor providing remote access to the attackers, and Catchamas\n[(Infostealer.Catchamas), a custom Trojan deployed on selected computers of interest and](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-040209-1742-99)\ndesigned to steal information.\n\nI dditi t t l Th i h d t i f d l t l d li i ff th\n\n\n-----\n\nArchiving tools\nPowerShell\nProxy tools\n\n## The Billbug link\n\nSince Symantec first uncovered Thrip in 2018, we’ve found strong evidence linking it to the\nBillbug group.\n\nWhat ties the two groups together is the Sagerunex backdoor. This malware appears to be an\nevolution of an older Billbug tool known as Evora. By comparing strings and code flow between\nthe two, we found that:\n\nThe code for logging in both is the same\nThe logging string format is similar, Evora is just more verbose\nThe log name for both starts with “\\00EV”\nThe command and control (C&C) communication code flows are similar\n\nBillbug is a long-established espionage group, active since at least January 2009. Similar to the\nThrip sub-group, the wider Billbug group is known for specializing in operations against targets in\nSouth Asia.\n\nBillbug’s targets are usually compromised by either spear-phishing emails or watering hole\nattacks. The group’s spear-phishing attacks have tended to use exploits in Microsoft Office and\nPDF documents to drop its malware onto victims’ computers. To date, many of the group’s targets\nhave been governments or military organizations.\n\n## Wider picture\n\nThrip appears to have been undeterred by its exposure last year, continuing to mount espionage\nattacks against a wide range of targets in South East Asia. Its link to the Billbug group puts its\nactivities into context and proves its attacks are part of a broader range of espionage activity\nheavily focused on (but not limited to) governments, armed forces, and communications\nproviders.\n\nSymantec’s TAA was the catalyst for both our initial discovery of Thrip in 2018 and the discovery\nof new tools and victims in 2019. Without TAA’s artificial intelligence, it is quite likely that the\ngroup’s activities may have gone undetected for a lot longer.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (SEDR), which contains TAA technology,](https://www.symantec.com/products/endpoint-detection-and-response)\nautomatically detects Thrip-related activity.\n\n[In addition to SEDR, Symantec’s Managed Endpoint Detection and Response (MEDR) service](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/managed-endpoint-detection-and-response-service)\nleverages automated attack hunting provided by analytics as well as Symantec analyst security\nexpertise to remotely investigate and contain incursions by adversaries such as Thrip in\nSymantec customer networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Intelligence\n\n[Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI)](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nservice have received reports on Thrip and Billbug, which detail methods of detecting and\nthwarting activities of this group.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA256** **Name**\n\n9348eba0582b19c4580491a32457a1904c41c06dee27ed07c86d986d3c98d15c Hannotog\n\nbd92ce8ef31cd40894b68338d9b71d371936b432b5347d944fad7d9381459761 Hannotog\n\n0d1ecd92570b8ca7b2ffd60271c5f601c08a822197413cf4ffd552a7e2426ff6 Sagerunex\n\n19378dab8b242d94148ad5c48d57d9e45fec5f53b6724155488dd80566a66623 Sagerunex\n\n1e164da9ddd19d0b654e8a60b416c80e82f9bfc0ab35dd262733f4364610c9f4 Sagerunex\n\n27ccd12206d185bf3297df288febf7d47b93ccdc6ec0e5c389ae30da8cac4bf3 Sagerunex\n\n460e11159413b47399aac530433bb00132f54e3859da1f5305977275e37c6153 Sagerunex\n\n5174d45c4e64c5e6abe6639a6a1d6f64bb48b4fb0efdad2b0ea708be7cb82fce Sagerunex\n\n523f28a364858bd7bb65de7c9e94bbdfbbdb9fe800421c990226662e293a05ea Sagerunex\n\n76a309691661ed67808a9c438815e9a282495e2e8e0055f2fe40e42bcf002dab Sagerunex\n\n868f0a1d3764e1c8e03a58caf1d4b8de946671d59b9145e30102ab6540349968 Sagerunex\n\n9530d2df7d340c74f061a1bff87bd2720ff11347b09f05cfb16e4dfd198f0168 Sagerunex\n\n9fd88a5d30fa36d8353cad6ea8b5f867429d39652bf85473de31c39466435775 Sagerunex\n\nc0be532e9fb71e0462f9bfdc8754df320be960b9d510a0b3b6d6cf128c537658 Sagerunex\n\nd45ad71497f48d0d2ebff8ecdcafc9e609b550c0ed76d540d7660dc27785d376 Sagerunex\n\nd54de8e0dc2b58b140f8677be3f0ea3c902dc3f3b112c7350aa95a9cbe24a8af Sagerunex\n\nd7c6aa114df9be3a1e01c196ca44e929821d6a6316f4754b0933189f98af4fc7 Sagerunex\n\nfe2046e479289b1013eb394f5b3d7a49a419cb98015add3ead0fa87614fe6e38 Sagerunex\n\n3228a0d40222548ea3476b43b13a18ef09f06a4402e3280640ee297533b5a3a0 Catchamas\n\n6b236d3fc54d36e6dc2a26299f6ded597058fed7c9099f1a37716c5e4b162abc Catchamas\n\nd9131bf2e2e2a80c319ed6ffbe5c726fe30eac50902705096d2610de52a774e2 Catchamas\n\nf14c9c859e12cf70099af098668f849b2ca0e99de6cc62b8569c230f35e36aa5 Catchamas\n\n0fb583b98cb73bd1bda1d60398fc6587a9541fff43d4db6dd172b853dcac1b17 Catchamas\n\n6b01d376b355c56ede966ccf5cca6c8d5616962e67bbf0ddbf7ad395d117fdee Catchamas\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
