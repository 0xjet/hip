    "plain_text": "# Targeted Destructive Malware\n\n**us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-353A**\n\n## Systems Affected\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n## Overview\n\nUS-CERT was recently notified by a trusted third party of cyber threat actors using a Server Message Block (SMB) Worm Tool to conduct\ncyber exploitation activities recently targeting a major entertainment company. This SMB Worm Tool is equipped with a Listening Implant,\nLightweight Backdoor, Proxy Tool, Destructive Hard Drive Tool, and Destructive Target Cleaning Tool.\n\nSMB Worm Tool: This worm uses a brute force authentication attack to propagate via Windows SMB shares. It connects home every five\nminutes to send log data back to command and control (C2) infrastructure if it has successfully spread to other Windows hosts via SMB port\n445. The tool also accepts new scan tasking when it connects to C2. There are two main threads: the first thread calls home and sends back\nlogs (a list of successful SMB exploitations), and the second thread attempts to guess passwords for SMB connections. If the password is\ncorrectly guessed, a file share is established and file is copied and run on the newly-infected host.\n\nListening Implant: During installation of this tool, a portion of the binaries is decrypted using AES, with a key derived from the phrase \"National\nFootball League.\" Additionally, this implant listens for connections on TCP port 195 (for \"sensvc.exe\" and \"msensvc.exe\") and TCP port 444\n(for \"netcfg.dll\"). Each message sent to and from this implant is preceded with its length, then XOR encoded with the byte 0x1F. Upon initial\nconnection, the victim sends the string, \"HTTP/1.1 GET /dns?\\x00.\" The controller then responds with the string \"200 www.yahoo.com!\\x00\"\n(for \"sensvc.exe\" and \"msensvc.exe\") or with the string \"RESPONSE 200 OK!!\" (for \"netcfg.dll\"). The controller sends the byte \"!\" (0x21) to end\nthe network connection. This special message is not preceded with a length or XOR encoded.\n\nLightweight Backdoor: This is a backdoor listener that is designed as a service DLL. It includes functionality such as file transfer, system\nsurvey, process manipulation, file time matching and proxy capability. The listener can also perform arbitrary code execution and execute\ncommands on the command line. This tool includes functionality to open ports in a victim host's firewall and take advantage of universal Plug\nand Play (UPNP) mechanisms to discover routers and gateway devices, and add port mappings, allowing inbound connections to victim hosts\non Network Address Translated (NAT) private networks. There are no callback domains associated with this malware since connections are\ninbound only on a specified port number.\n\nProxy Tool: Implants in this malware family are typically loaded via a dropper installed as a service, then configured to listen on TCP port 443.\nThe implant may have an associated configuration file which can contain a configurable port. This proxy tool has basic backdoor functionality,\nincluding the ability to fingerprint the victim machine, run remote commands, perform directory listings, perform process listings, and transfer\nfiles.\n\nDestructive Hard Drive Tool: This tool is a tailored hard-drive wiping tool that is intended to destroy data past the point of recovery and to\ncomplicate the victim machine’s recovery. If the CNE operator has administrator-level privileges on the host, the program will over-write\nportions of up-to the first four physical drives attached, and over-write the master boot record (MBR) with a program designed to cause further\ndamage if the hard drive is re-booted. This further results in the victim machine being non-operational with irrecoverable data (There is a\ncaveat for machines installed with the windows 7 operating system: windows 7 machines will continue to operate in a degraded state with the\ntargeted files destroyed until after reboot, in which the infected MBR then wipes the drive.) If the actor has user-level access, the result\nincludes specific files being deleted and practically irrecoverable, but the victim machine would remain usable.\n\nDestructive Target Cleaning Tool: This tool renders victim machines inoperable by overwriting the Master Boot Record. The tool is dropped and\ninstalled by another executable and consists of three parts: an executable and a dll which contain the destructive components, and an\nencoded command file that contains the actual destruction commands to be executed.\n\nNetwork Propagation Wiper: The malware has the ability to propagate throughout the target network via built-in Windows shares. Based on the\nusername/password provided in the configuration file and the hostname/IP address of target systems, the malware will access remote network\nshares in order to upload a copy of the wiper and begin the wiping process on these remote systems. The malware uses several methods to\naccess shares on the remote systems to begin wiping files. Checking for existing shares via “\\\\hostname\\admin$\\system32” and\n“\\\\hostname\\shared$\\system32” or create a new share “cmd.exe /q /c net share shared$=%SystemRoot% /GRANT:everyone, FULL”. Once\nsuccessful, the malware uploads a copy of the wiper file “taskhostXX.exe”, changes the file-time to match that of the built-in file “calc.exe”, and\nstarts the remote process. The remote process is started via the command “cmd.exe /c wmic.exe /node:hostname /user:username\n/password:pass PROCESS CALL CREATE”. Hostname, username, and password are then obtained from the configuration file. Afterwards,\nthe remote network share is removed via “cmd.exe /q /c net share shared$ /delete”. Once the wiper has been uploaded, the malware reports\nits status back to one of the four C2 IP addresses.\n\nTechnical and strategic mitigation recommendations are included in the Solution section below.\n\nUS-CERT recommends reviewing the Security Tip [Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003)\n\n\n-----\n\n## esc pt o\n\nCyber threat actors are using an SMB worm to conduct cyber exploitation activities. This tool contains five components – a listening implant,\nlightweight backdoor, proxy tool, destructive hard drive tool, and destructive target cleaning tool.\n\nThe SMB worm propagates throughout an infected network via brute-force authentication attacks, and connects to a C2 infrastructure.\n\n## Impact\n\nDue to the highly destructive functionality of this malware, an organization infected could experience operational impacts including loss of\nintellectual property and disruption of critical systems.\n\n## Solution\n\nUsers and administrators are recommended to take the following preventive measures to protect their computer networks:\n\nUse and maintain anti-virus software – Anti-virus software recognizes and protects your computer against most known viruses. It is\nimportant to keep your anti-virus software up-to-date (see Understanding Anti-Virus Software for more information).\nKeep your operating system and application software up-to-date – Install software patches so that attackers can't take advantage of\nknown problems or vulnerabilities. Many operating systems offer automatic updates. If this option is available, you should enable it (see\nUnderstanding Patches for more information).\nReview Security Tip [Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003 and evaluate their capabilities encompassing planning, preparation,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003)\ndetection, and response for such an event.\nReview Recommended Practices for Control Systems, and Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth\nStrategies (pdf).\n\nThe following is a list of the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that can be added to network security solutions to determine whether they are\npresent on a network.\n\n**Import Hashes:**\n\n**SMB worm tool:**\n\nImport hash: f6f48551d7723d87daeef2e840ae008f\n\nCharacterization: File Hash Watchlist\n\nNotes: \"SMB worm

This file serves as a dropper. It drops destructive malware:\n“igfxtrayex.exe”. When the dropper file was executed, it started a second instance of itself with “-i” as an argument, and then terminated. The\nsecond instance of the dropper file installed itself as the “WinsSchMgmt” service with “-k” as a command line argument, started the service,\nand then terminated. The “WinsSchMgmt” service executed the file with “-k” as an argument, which started another instance of the file using “s” as an argument. The “-s” instance dropped and executed “igfxtrayex.exe”, created “net_ver.dat”, and began generating network traffic over\nTCP ports 445 and 139 to victim IP addresses.\n\nName: net_ver.dat\n\nSize: 4572 bytes (4.6 KB) (size will vary)\n\nMD5: 93BC819011B2B3DA8487F964F29EB934 (hash will vary)\n\nThis is a log file created by the dropper, and appended to as the scans progress It contains what appear to be hostnames, IP addresses, and\nthe number 2.

If “igfxtrayex.exe” is run with no parameters, it creates and starts\na copy of itself with the “–i” argument. After 10 minutes, the “igfxtrayex.exe” makes three copies of itself and places them in the same directory\nfrom which it was executed. These copies are named according to the format “taskhostXX.exe” (where X is a randomly generated ASCII\ncharacter). These copies are then executed, each with a different argument (one being “-m”, one being “-d” and the other “-w”). Network\nconnection attempts are made to one of three hard-coded IP addresses in a random order to port 8080 or 8000. If a connection to the IP\naddress cannot be made, it attempts to connect to another of the three IP addresses, until connections to all three IP addresses have been\nattempted. The following command-line string is then executed: “cmd.exe /c net stop MSExchangeIS /y”.

Actual impact to organizations may vary depending on the type and\nnumber of systems impacted.\n\n**Tactical Mitigations**\n\nImplement the indicators of compromise within your systems for detection and mitigation purposes.\n\nEncourage users to transfer critical files to network shares, to allow for central backed up.\n\nExecute daily backups of all critical systems.\n\nPeriodically execute an “offline” backup of critical files to removable media.\n\nEstablish emergency communications plans should network resources become unavailable.\n\nIsolate any critical networks (including operations networks) from business systems.\n\nIdentify critical systems and evaluate the need for having on-hand spares to quickly restore service.\n\nEnsure antivirus is up to date.\n\nDisable credential caching for all desktop devices with particular importance on critical systems such as servers and restrict the number\nof cached credential for all portable devices to no more than three if possible. This can be accomplished through a Group Policy Object\n(GPO).\n\nDisable AutoRun and Autoplay for any removable media device.\n\nPrevent or limit the use of all removable media devices on systems to limit the spread or introduction of malicious software and possible\nexfiltration data, except where there is a valid business case for use. This business case must be approved by the organization Chief IT\nSecurity Officer, with policy/guidance on how such media should be used.\n\nConsider restricting account privileges. It is our recommendation that all daily operations should be executed using standard user\naccounts unless administrative privileges are required for that specific function. Configure all standard user accounts to prevent the\nexecution and installation of any unknown or unauthorized software. Both standard and administrative accounts should have access only\nto services required for nominal daily duties, enforcing the concept of separation of duties. Lastly, disable Web and email capabilities on\nadministrative accounts. Compromise of admin accounts is one vector that allows malicious activity to become truly persistent in a\nnetwork environment.\n\nEnsure that password policy rules are enforced and Admin password values are changed periodically.\n\nConsider prohibiting hosts within the production environment or DMZ from sharing an Active Directory enterprise with hosts on other\nnetworks. Each environment should have separate forests within Active Directory, with no trust relationships allowed between the forests\nif at all possible. If necessary, the trust relationships should be one-way with the low integrity environment trusting the higher integrity\nenvironment.\n\nConsider deployment of a coaching page with click through acceptance; these are traditionally deployed in an environment to log the\nacceptance of network acceptable use policy or to notify users of monitoring. Coaching pages also provide some measure of protection\nfrom automated malicious activity. This occurs because automated malware is normally incapable of physically clicking an acceptance\nradial button. Automated malware is traditionally hardcoded to execute, then retrieve commands or additional executables from the\nInternet. If the malware is unable to initiate an active connection, the full train of infection is potentially halted. The danger still exists that\nthe physical user will authorize access, but through the use of coaching pages, infections can be limited or at least the rate of infection\nreduced.\n\nMonitor logs -- Maintain and actively monitor a centralized logging solution that keeps track of all anomalous and potentially malicious\nactivity.\n\nEnsure that all network operating systems, web browsers, and other related network hardware and software remain updated with all\ncurrent patches and fixes.\n\n**Strategic Mitigations**\n\nOrganizations should review Security Tip [Handling Destructive Malware #ST13-003 and evaluate their capabilities encompassing](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003)\nplanning, preparation, detection, and response for such an event.\n\nAlways keep your patch levels up to date, especially on computers that host public services accessible through the firewall, such as\nHTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.\n\nBuild host systems, especially critical systems such as servers, with only essential applications and components required to perform the\nintended function Any unused applications or functions should be removed or disabled if possible to limit the attack surface of the host\n\n\n-----\n\np e e t et o seg e tat o t oug s to t t e sp ead o a a e\n\nConsider the deployment of Software Restriction Policy set to only allow the execution of approved software (application whitelisting)\n\nRecommend the whitelisting of legitimate executable directories to prevent the execution of potentially malicious binaries.\n\nConsider the use of two-factor authentication methods for accessing privileged root level accounts or systems.\n\nConsider deploying a two-factor authentication through a hardened IPsec/VPN gateway with split-tunneling prohibited for secure remote\naccess.\n\nDeny direct Internet access, except through the use of proxies for Enterprise servers and workstations. Perform regular content filtering\nat the proxies or external firewall points of presence. Also consider the deployment of an explicit versus transparent proxy policy.\n\nImplement a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) inspection capability to inspect both ingress and egress encrypted network traffic for potential\nmalicious activity.\n\nIsolate network services, such as email and Web application servers by utilizing a secure multi-tenant virtualization technology. This will\nlimit the damage sustained from a compromise or attack of a single network component.\n\nImplement best practice guidance and policy to restrict the use of non-Foundation assets for processing or accessing Foundationcontrolled data or systems (e.g., working from home, or using a personal device while at the office). It is difficult to enforce corporate\npolicies, detect intrusions, and conduct forensic analysis or remediate compromises on non-corporate owned devices.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet.\n\nPlace control system networks behind firewalls, and isolate or air gap them from the business network.\n\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure\nas the connected devices.\n\nIndustrial Control System (ICS)-CERT and US-CERT remind organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior\nto taking defensive measures.\n\n## References\n\n Revisions\n\nDecember 19, 2014: Initial Release\n\nDecember 24, 2014: Updates to information in the Solutions section.\n\nJanuary 3, 2020: Corrected YARA rules.\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-353A)\n\n\n-----",
