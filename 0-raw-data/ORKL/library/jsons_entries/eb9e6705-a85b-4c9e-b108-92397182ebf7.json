Avaddon and Thanos)\n\n**[medium.com/s2wlab/quick-analysis-of-haron-ransomware-feat-avaddon-and-thanos-1ebb70f64dc4](https://medium.com/s2wlab/quick-analysis-of-haron-ransomware-feat-avaddon-and-thanos-1ebb70f64dc4)**\n\nS2W July 23, 2021\n\nS2\nW\n\n\n[S2W](https://medium.com/@s2w?source=post_page-----1ebb70f64dc4--------------------------------)\n\nJul 22, 2021\n\n\n4 min read\n\n**Author: Talon @ S2WLAB**\n\nHaron ransomware was first discovered in July 2021. When infected with this ransomware, the\nextension of the encrypted file is changed to the victim’s name. They are using a ransom note\nand operating their own leak site similar to Avaddon ransomware. They have disclosed only\none victim on the leak site so far.\n\n## Detailed analysis\n\n A. Similarity of ransom notes\n\n\n-----\n\nThe highlighted part in the picture above is the same part between Haron and Avaddon.\nThe main difference is that Haron suggests a specific ID and Password for victim to log in\nto the negotiation site.\n\n## B. Similarity of negotiation sites\n\n B-1. Haron operates the negotiation site and leak site on the same domain\n\n\n-----\n\nAvaddon operated negotiation and leak sites on different domain addresses.\nIn the case of Haron, ID and password are required to have access to the negotiation\npage.\n\n## B-2. Comparing the contents of the negotiation sites\n\n\n-----\n\nThe appearance of negotiation site is almost identical except for the name of ransomware\n“Haron” or “Avaddon”\nThe overall interface and string of the negotiation page are similar, but the date notation\nhh:mm dd:MM:yyyy has converted to hh:mm and icon in the chat window has\ndisappeared\n\n## B-3. Haron’s chat feature is built based on open source\n\n\n-----\n\nThe JavaScript used for chat is the open-source code published on the Russian\nDeveloper Forum in the past.\n\n## C. Similarity of the leak sites\n\n\n-----\n\nAs shown in the picture above, the leak site of Haron has the same structure as that of\nAvaddon.\nHaron also uses a strategy to induce negotiations within that period by setting the time for\nthe next data update, but there is no DDoS attack notice yet. It has not been confirmed\nwhether they would carry out a DDoS attack like Avaddon.\nAlso, Avaddon gave 10 days for negotiation, but Haron gave about 6 days.\n\n\n-----\n\n## D. Comparative analysis of Haron and Avaddon\n\n D-1. The files related to Avaddon\n\nThere are logos, icons as well as sample data of victims used by Avaddon on the Haron’s\nserver. However, all of the files can be collected at the client level.\nThe last modified date of the files is the same as the date (2021–06–11) when Avaddon\ndisappeared after sending the decryption key to BleepingComputer\n\n\n-----\n\n## D-2. Haron is based on Thanos Ransomware\n\nHaron is using Thanos Ransomware to infect victims. Even the functions are almost the\nsame as before.\n\n\n-----\n\nThanos ransomware is a RaaS that has been sold on DDW since 2019\n\nhttps://medium.com/s2wlab/story-of-the-week-ransomware-on-the-darkweb-2ace644c6db3f\n\n\n-----\n\nRecently, Thanos builder has been published on github.\n\n[https://github.com/Hacker-Data/Thanos-Ransomware-Builder](https://github.com/Hacker-Data/Thanos-Ransomware-Builder)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n1. It is difficult to conclude that Haron is a re-emergence of Avaddon based on our analysis.\n\nAvaddon developed and used their own C++ based ransomware.\nBut Haron is using C# based Thanos ransomware which is publicly available.\nThe Web Interface of Haron’s Leak site is almost identical to that of Avaddon ransomware\nassuming that Haron mimicked Avaddon’s UI.- When ransomware gangs rebrand, they\nusually change many things such as the design of the leak site.- Example : Gandcrab →\nSodinokibi/REvil, Babuk → Payload.bin\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Haron ransomware gang doesn t have their own dedicated skills compared to other well\nknown ransomware gangs such as Avaddon.\n\nUsing Thanos ransomware leaked to the public.\nUsing open-source chat feature on their negotiation site.\nCopycat UI from Avaddon on their leak site.\nInsufficient authentication process when accessing the negotiation site.- Anyone can enter\nthe negotiation and leak site using test/test account. * However, after this publication, the\ntest account has removed.\n\n## Malware Hash\n\n1. Haron : 6e6b78a1df17d6718daa857827a2a364b7627d9bfd6672406ad72b276014209c\n2. Thanos : c460fc0d4fdaf5c68623e18de106f1c3601d7bd6ba80ddad86c10fd6ea123850\n\n\n-----",
