The White House and Department of State are two of\nthe most spectacular known victims.\n\nThe operation presents several interesting aspects\n\nblatantly sensitive high profile victims and targets\ncrypto and anti-detection capabilities\nstrong malware functional and structural similarities mating this toolset to early MiniDuke second stage\ncomponents, along with more recent CosmicDuke and OnionDuke components\n\nThe actor often spearphishes targets with e-mails containing a link to a hacked website. Sometimes it is a\nhigh profile, legitimate site such as \"diplomacy.pl\", hosting a ZIP archive. The ZIP archive contains a RAR\nSFX which installs the malware and shows an empty PDF decoy.\n\nIn other highly successful runs, this actor sends out phony flash videos directly as email attachments. A\nclever example is \"Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip\". The executable within not only plays a flash video, but\ndrops and runs another CozyDuke executable. These videos are quickly passed around offices with delight\nwhile systems are infected in the background silently. Many of this APT's components are signed with\nphony Intel and AMD digital certificates.\n\nRecent Cozyduke APT activity attracted significant attention in the news:\nSources: State Dept. hack the 'worst ever'\n\n\n-----\n\nState Department shuts down its e mail system amid concerns about hacking\n\nLet's examine a smattering of representative CozyDuke files and data. There is much to their toolset.\n\n**Office Monkeys dropper analysis**\nThe droppers and spyware components often maintain fairly common characteristics\n68271df868f462c06e24a896a9494225,Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip\n\nBelieve it or not, recipients in bulk run the file within:\n95b3ec0a4e539efaa1faa3d4e25d51de,Office Monkeys (Short Flash Movie).exe\n\nThis file in turn drops two executables to %temp%\n\n2aabd78ef11926d7b562fd0d91e68ad3, Monkeys.exe\n3d3363598f87c78826c859077606e514, player.exe\n\nIt first launches Monkeys.exe, playing a self-contained, very funny video of white-collar tie wearing\nchimpanzees working in a high rise office with a human colleague. It then launches player.exe, a\nCozyDuke dropper maintaining anti-detection techniques:\n3d3363598f87c78826c859077606e514,338kb,player.exe,Trojan.Win32.CozyBear.v,CompiledOn:2014.07.\n02 21:13:33\n\nThe file collects system information, and then invokes a WMI instance in the root\\securitycenter\nnamespace to identify security products installed on the system, meaning that this code was built for x86\nsystems, wql here:\nSELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct\nSELECT * FROM FireWallProduct\n\nThe code hunts for several security products to evade:\n\nCRYSTAL\nKASPERSKY\nSOPHOS\nDrWeb\nAVIRA\nCOMODO Dragon\n\nIn addition to the WMI/wql use, it also hunts through the\n\"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\\" registry key looking for security products to\navoid.\n\nFollowing these checks, it drops several more malware files signed with the pasted AMD digital signature\nto a directory it creates. These files are stored within an 217kb encrypted cab file in the dropper's\nresources under the name \"A\". The cab file was encrypted and decrypted using a simple xor cipher with a\nrotating 16 byte key: \\x36\\x11\\xdd\\x08\\xac\\x4b\\x72\\xf8\\x51\\x04\\x68\\x2e\\x3e\\x38\\x64\\x32.\n\nThe cab file is decompressed and its contents are created on disk. These dropped files bundle functionality\nfor both 64bit and 32bit Windows systems:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\ATI_Subsystem\\\n6761106f816313394a653db5172dc487,54kb,amdhcp32.dll ← 32bit dll,CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:24\nd596827d48a3ff836545b3a999f2c3e3,60kb,aticaldd.dll ← 64bit dll,CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:26\nbc626c8f11ed753f33ad1c0fe848d898,285kb,atiumdag.dll ← 32bit dll, 279kb, Trojan.Win32.CozyDuke.a,\nCompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:26\n4152e79e3dbde55dcf3fc2014700a022,6kb,racss.dat\n\n\n-----\n\nparameter values, it's only export and an arbitrary pid, i.e.:\n\"C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\ATI_Subsystem\\amdocl_as32.exe\" \"C:\\Documents and\nSettings\\user\\Application Data\\ATI_Subsystem\\atiumdag.dll\"\", ADL2_ApplicationProfiles_System_Reload\n1684\"\n\nThis dll is built with anti-AV protections as well. However, it looks for a different but overlapping set, and\nthe random duplication suggests that this component was cobbled together with its dropper, partly\nregionally based on target selection.\n\nKASPERSKY\n\nThe code collects information about the system\nefd5aba3-6719-4655-8a72-1aa93feefa38C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application\nData\\ATI_Subsystem\\amdocl_as32exeMyPCuserMicrosoft Windows XP 512600 SP 30\nx32Admin192.60.11.1008:11:17:f2:9a:efSophos Anti-Virus\n\nFinally, this process beacons to www.sanjosemaristas.com, which appears to be a site that has been\ncompromised and misused multiple times in the past couple of years.\nhxxp://www.sanjosemaristas.com/app/index.php?{A01BA0AD-9BB3-4F38-B76B-A00AD11CBAAA},\nproviding the current network adapter's service name GUID. It uses standard Win32 base cryptography\nfunctions to generate a CALG_RC4 session key to encrypt the collected data communications and POSTs\nit to the server.\n\n**Executable-Signing Certificates**\n\nSamples are usually signed with a fake certificate - we've seen two instances, one AMD and one Intel:\n\n**Configuration files:**\n\nSome of the malware uses an encrypted configuration file which is stored on disk as \"racss dat\" This is\n\n\n-----\n\n**C&Cs:**\n\n121.193.130.170:443/wp-ajax.php\n183.78.169.5:443/search.php\n200.119.128.45:443/mobile.php\n200.125.133.28:443/search.php\n200.125.142.11:443/news.php\n201.76.51.10:443/plugins/json.php\n202.206.232.20:443/rss.php\n202.76.237.216:443/search.php\n203.156.161.49:443/plugins/twitter.php\n208.75.241.246:443/msearch.php\n209.40.72.2:443/plugins/fsearch.php\n210.59.2.20:443/search.php\n208.77.177.24:443/fsearch.php\nwww.getiton.hants.org.uk:80/themes/front/img/ajax.php\nwww.seccionpolitica.com.ar:80/galeria/index.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/links.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/api.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/index.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/error.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/profile.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/online.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/loader.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/search.php\n\n\n-----\n\nC&C scripts store these temporarily until the next victim connects in local files. We've identified two such\nfiles:\n\nsettings.db\nsdfg3d.db\n\nHere's how such a database file appears:\n\nThese are BASE64 encoded and use the same RC4 encryption key as the malware configuration.\n\nDecoding them resulted in the following payloads:\n\n59704bc8bedef32709ab1128734aa846 *ChromeUpdate.ex_\n5d8835982d8bfc8b047eb47322436c8a *cmd_task.dll\ne0b6f0d368c81a0fb197774d0072f759 *screenshot_task.dll\n\nDecoding them also resulted in a set of tasking files maintaining agent commands and parameter values:\n\nconf.xml\n\nAnd a set of \"reporting\" files, maintaining stolen system \"info\", error output, and \"AgentInfo\" output, from\nvictim systems:\nDCOM_amdocl_ld_API_.raw\nUtil_amdave_System_.vol\nLast_amdpcom_Subsystem_.max\nData_amdmiracast_API_.aaf\n7.txt\n\nscreenshot_task.dll is a 32-bit dll used to take a screenshot of the full desktop window and save it as a\nbitmap in %temp%. The number of times the screenshot is repeated is configurable within the xml task file.\n\ncmd_task.dll is a 32-bit dll that maintains several primitives. It is used to create new processes, perform as\na command line shell, and several other tasks.\n\nEach of these payloads is delivered together with a configuration file that explains how to run it, for\ninstance:\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, ChromeUpdate is a 64-bit executable (which appears to be a WEXTRACT package) that\noddly drops a 32-bit Dll. Cache.dll is simply stored as a cabinet file in the ChromeUpdate's resource\nsection.\n\nChromeUpdate.exe starts the file with \"rundll32 cache.dll,ADB_Setup\"\n\n**Cache.dll analysis**\n\nCache.dll was written in C/C++ and built with a Microsoft compiler.\n\nCache.dll code flow overview\n\nrc4 decrypt hardcoded c2 and urls\nresolve hidden function calls\ncollect identifying victim system data\nencrypt collected data\nsend stolen data to c2 and retrieve commands\n\n**Cache.dll code details**\n\nStructurally, cache.dll is a fairly large backdoor at 425kb. It maintains both code and data in the raw,\nencrypted blobs of data to be decrypted and used at runtime, and hidden functionality that isn't exposed\nuntil runtime. No pdb/debug strings are present in the code.\n\nIt maintains eight exports, including DllMain:\n\nADB_Add\nADB_Cleanup\nADB_Initnj\nADB_Load\nADB_Release\nADB_Remove\nADB_Setup\n\nADB_Setup is a entry point that simply spawns another thread and waits for completion.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbove, we see a new thread created with the start address of Cache.dll export \"ADB_Load\" by the initial\nthread.\n\nThis exported function is passed control while the initial thread runs a Windows message loop. It first grabs\nan encrypted blob stored away in a global variable and pulls out 381 bytes of this encrypted data:\n\nThe standard win32 api CryptDecrypt uses rc4 to decrypt this blob into a hardcoded c2, url path, and url\nparameters listed below with a simple 140-bit key\n\"\\x8B\\xFF\\x55\\x8B\\xEC\\x83\\xEC\\x50\\xA1\\x84\\x18\\x03\\x68\\x33\\xC9\\x66\\xF7\\x45\\x10\\xE8\\x1F\\x89\\x45\\xF\nC\\x8B\\x45\\x14\\x56\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code then decodes this set of import symbols and resolves addresses for its networking and data\nstealing functionality:\nInternetCloseHandle\nInternetReadFile\nHttpSendRequestA\nHttpOpenRequestA\nHttpQueryInfoA\nInternetConnectA\nInternetCrackUrlA\nInternetOpenA\nInternetSetOptionW\nGetAdaptersInfo\n\nMuch like the prior office monkey \"atiumdag.dll\" component, this code collects identifying system\ninformation using standard win32 API calls:\n\nComputer name - GetComputerNameW\nUser name - GetUserNameW\nAdapter GUID, ip address, mac address - GetAdaptersInfo\nWindows version - GetVersionExW\n\nIt then uses the runtime resolved networking API calls to send the collected data back to a hardcoded c2\nand set of urls.\n\nCache.dll connectback urls:\n209.200.83.43/ajax/links.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/api.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/index.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/error.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/profile.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/online.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/loader.php\n209.200.83.43/ajax/search.php\n\nObserved user-agent string on the wire, but it's dynamically generated based on the Windows system\nsettings (retrieved using standard win32 api \"ObtainUserAgentString\"):\n\"U A t M ill /4 0 ( tibl MSIE 6 0 Wi d NT 5 1 SV1 NET CLR 2 0 50727 NET CLR\n\n\n-----\n\n**Connections with MiniDuke/CosmicDuke/OnionDuke:**\n\nOne of the second stage modules of Cozy Bear, Show.dll, is particularly interesting because it appears to\nhave been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke. Below we compare Show.dll with the OnionDuke\nsample MD5: c8eb6040fd02d77660d19057a38ff769. Both have exactly the same export tables and appear\nto be called internally \"UserCache.dll\":\n\nThis seems to indicate the authors of OnionDuke and Cozy Bear are the same, or working together.\n\nAnother interesting comparison of two other files matches a recent second stage tool from the CozyDuke\nattacks with a second stage component from other Miniduke/Onionduke attacks.\n2e0361fd73f60c76c69806205307ccac, update.dll (Miniduke), 425kb (internal name = \"UserCache.dll\")\n9e3f3b5e9ece79102d257e8cf982e09e, cache.dll (Cozyduke), 425kb (internal name = \"UserCache.dll\")\n\nThe two share identical export function names in their export directories, and the naming appears to be\nrandomly assigned at compile time. The table below presents the function matches based on size data, but\nthe calls, jmps and code all match as well. The contents of only one of these exports in update.dll has no\nmatch whatsoever in cache.dll.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike the atiumdag.dll file above, however, cache.dll and update.dll do not maintain anti-AV and antianalysis functionality sets. Perhaps they plan to pair this stealer with another dropper that maintains the\nWMI anti-AV functionality.\n\nWe expect ongoing and further activity from this group in the near future and variations on the\nmalware used in previous duke-ish incidents.\n\nFor more information about MiniDuke, CosmicDuke and OnionDuke, please see References.\n\n**Appendix: Parallel and Previous Research**\n\nThe MiniDuke Mystery: PDF 0-day Government Spy Assembler 0x29A Micro Backdoor, Securelist, Feb\n2013\n\nMiniduke is back: Nemesis Gemina and the Botgen Studio, Securelist, July 2014\n\nMiniDuke 2 (CosmicDuke), CrySyS, July 2014\n\nCOSMICDUKE Cosmu with a twist of MiniDuke [pdf], F-Secure, September 2014\n\nTHE CASE OF THE MODIFIED BINARIES, Leviathan Security, October 2014\n\nA word on CosmicDuke, Blaze's Security Blog, September 2014\n\nOnionDuke: APT Attacks Via the Tor Network, F-Secure, November 2014\n\nThe Connections Between MiniDuke, CosmicDuke and OnionDuke, F-Secure, January 2015\n\n\n_Evernote makes it easy to remember things big and small from your everyday life using your computer,_\n\n_tablet, phone and the web._\n\n[Terms of Service](https://evernote.com/tos/) [Privacy Policy](https://evernote.com/privacy/)\n\n\n-----",
