This approach by the\nthreat actor was quite interesting considering the fact that there were no ransom demands\nand the key to unlock the device has been hardcoded in the app. In this blog, we will be\nexplaining the technical aspects of the app which was developed by an attackerto lock the\nscreen of a user’s device.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nOnce the app “gbwhatsapp.apk“ ( Hash: 70273ee146260bafb1cc136a0249e2a2 ) is\ninstalled as shown in Figure 1, it seems to execute a shell command in its class\nADRTLogCatReader. In the code shown in Figure 2, we can see it uses the command\n**“logcat -v threadtime”. The shell command adb logcat -v threadtime displays the date,**\ninvocation time, priority, tag, and the PID and TID of the thread issuing the message.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: “gbwhatsapp.apk“_\n\n_installed on the device_\n\n_Figure 2: Code using shell command_\nIn the main activity, it looks like this app was developed on AIDE “com.aide.ui”, a tool to\ndevelop Android apps directly on an Android device as shown in Figure 3, and the main\nactivity starts a service named MyService.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: ADRTLogCatReader communicates with com.aide.ui for debugging_\n**MyService invokes the malicious behaviour of the app. The idea behind this is displaying**\na lock screen window which cannot be exited until the correct key is entered.\nWindowManager displays a window on top of the screen and makes it persist using the\nfunction Toast.makeTest().show() as shown in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4: Code to display lock screen_\nThe lock screen consists of a note which can be seen from resource field “ransomware\n**virus sistem lock” and “you sistem already lock dont any restart or uninstall thisfile**\n**cant damage and default virus for information call ask (Variants19crew)….” as shown**\nin Figure 5 and Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 5: Code containing note to be displayed_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Lock screen display_\n\nFortunately, there were no ransom demands and the key to unlock the device has also\nbeen hardcoded which can be used to get rid of this window as shown in Figure 7. When\nthe user unlocks the device by entering the string “anonymous86”, it will kill the app.\n\n_Figure 7: Code for gbwhatsapp.apk to unlock the device_\nThere are scenarios where the malware author demands a ransom for the app\n“instagramgold.apk” as shown in Figure 8. The lock screen consists of a note which can\nalso be seen from resource field “POOLS CLOSED” and “As you can see your phone\n**has been hacked and with that, all of you information, right now as we speak is**\n\n\n-----\n\n**being uploaded to a magical place for exploitation. However this can be avoided.**\n**we’d like $1000.00 send to this bitcoin address**\n**bc1qj7a82wmtmm8a4vt2z93jxn5cemfjztnqffn0e9 within 24hrs or life gets worse.**\n**Cheerio”**\n\n_Figure 8: Lock screen demanding_\n\n_ransom_\nFortunately, the key to get rid of this lock screen window is hardcoded. The device can be\nunlocked by entering the string “17317071” as shown in Figure 9 which kills the app.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Code for instagramgold.apk to unlock the device_\nThis malware author is spreading a fake lock screen app resembling legitimate apps such\nas WhatsApp, GitHub, Netflix, Instagram Gold, Spotify, etc. However, while some of the\napps of this type demand a ransom to unlock the device’s screen, a few others don’t. That\nsaid, we at K7 Labs are constantly monitoring such campaigns. We recommend users to\navoid believing in such third party apps and break the chain in spreading these fake apps.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Package name** **Hash** **Detection**\n**Name**\n\n[gbwhatsapp.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Agbwhatsapp.apk) 70273ee146260bafb1cc136a0249e2a2 Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n[instagramgold.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Ainstagramgold.apk) 0f7457d6265894866179aae48e02ab54 Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[github.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Agithub.apk) 9f976a60bf58d8331f4444eadb8bb6ec Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n[netflix_mod.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Anetflix_mod.apk) b21d22ac5d9274d0b3fea13b1b5b03e0 Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[whatsapp.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Awhatsapp.apk) 133b2254b7476b74a0bec7f78403b4c2 Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[netlixmod.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Anetlixmod.apk) dd89c6495618a9ba6f60b7a2b0e0feec Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[insta.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Ainsta.apk) 19f4ace950b6a24158b3d04621971308 Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n[instagram.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Ainstagram.apk) f4b5e57707e35c7aedf13565df937dca Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[spotifymodbyking.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Aspotifymodbyking.apk) a57fd47adfeb0ad3d5e18e3bf3b73dac Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n[netflix.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Anetflix.apk) 5ab43fb6ebbccee413b829297a9115fe Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[netflixhack.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Anetflixhack.apk) 38eb57feecc37c440abc79ea3d41892f Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n\n-----\n\n[tiktokcrack.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Atiktokcrack.apk) 1a0966aa51290d1d33c7a4c977a51015 Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[whatsappbannedpremium.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Awhatsappbannedpremium.apk) 4ffc021026119e3fc9ad76bb7a2b3db7 Trojan (\n00533ef71 )\n\n[whatsapp-banned.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Awhatsapp-banned.apk) 3ebbd21ba983a4e718da9a1f45788a23 Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n[spotify.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Aspotify.apk) 72883d06b5df665b318d626df32e6f80 Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n[youtubepremium.apk](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name%253Ayoutubepremium.apk) 0aba07866fbb4c0ec42831aa24d22c7c Trojan (\n0057c6481 )\n\n\n-----",
