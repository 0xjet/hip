They are familiar with the threat\nactor and their skimmer-code and detect it almost on an hourly basis.\n\nWith British Airways, though, MageCart took a targeted approach and customized the script\nso that did not ring any alarm bells.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular skimmer is very much attuned to how British Airway s payment page is set\nup, which tells us that the attackers carefully considered how to target this site instead of\nblindly injecting the regular\nMagecart skimmer,\" RiskIQ says in a [report shared with BleepingComputer in advance.](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-british-airways-breach/)\n\nFor this investigation, the researchers identified all the scripts loaded by the air carrier's\nwebsite and searched for recent changes.\n\nThe researchers noticed that the Modernizr JavaScript library had been modified with 22\nnew lines of code at the bottom, a tactic often used by attackers to make sure they don't\nbreak the functionality of the script.\n\nBritish Airways website loaded the library from the baggage claim information page, and the\nchange made by MageCart threat actor allowed Modernizr to send payment information\nfrom the customer to the attacker's server.\n\nThe compromised code reacted the same whether the website launched on a computer\nscreen or from the mobile app, since in both cases the resources for for searching, booking\nor managing flights were the same.\n\nThe change in the JavaScript library was confirmed by the headers sent by the British\nAirways server, which indicated August 21, 20:49 GMT as the time and date of the last\nmodification in Modernizr.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the statement on the data breach, the airline said the theft occurred between August 21,\n22:58 BST, one hour after MageCart made the change in Modernizr.\n\n## Attackers use SSL certificate from Comodo\n\nMore evidence that MageCart prepared for this attack and aimed to keep it active for as\nlong a period as possible is found in the infrastructure used for exfiltrating the payment card\ndetails.\n\nThe compromised Modernizr script delivered all the data to baways[.]com, which resembles\nthe legitimate domain used by British Airways, and would likely not raise suspicions during\na cursory look at the modified library.\n\nRiskIQ also discovered that MageCart purchased an SSL certificate from Comodo, instead\nof going with the free choice from Let's Encrypt. The reason for this is that a paid certificate\nis less likely to attract attention.\n\nWith this attack, MageCart threat actor has stepped up the ladder and showed they are\ncapable of refining its operations, blending in with the targeted website to maintain their\npresence.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is unclear how MageCart managed to compromise the British Airways website, but RiskIQ\nsays that being able \"to modify a resource for the site tells us the access was substantial.\"\n\n**Update: Following BleepingComputer's report, Comodo released a statement saying that it**\nrevoked the SSL certificate issued to baways[.]com, the domain used for\nexfiltrating payment data.\n\n\"Comodo CA had issued the DV certificate in mid-August, 2018, after following all industry\nstandards and Baseline Requirements from the CA/Browser Forum,\" reads the statement.\n\n\"While Certificate Authorities (CAs) can and must authenticate certificate requesters\naccording to their validation level (EV, OV, or DV), they are not able to discern the intention\nof the certificate requester in advance of real-world use,\" the statement continues.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Credit card stealers are getting much stealthier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-credit-card-stealers-are-getting-much-stealthier/)\n\n[Caramel credit card stealing service is growing in popularity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/caramel-credit-card-stealing-service-is-growing-in-popularity/)\n\n[Carding](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/carding/)\n[E-Commerce](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/e-commerce/)\n[MageCart](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/magecart/)\n[Skimmer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/skimmer/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
