It\ntargets WatchGuard devices that were reconfigured from the manufacturer default settings to\nopen remote management interfaces to external access.\n\nAn infection doesn't mean the organisation is the primary target, but it's possible that infected\nmachines could be used to conduct additional attacks.\n\nThe NCSC urges affected organisations to take steps to remove the malware, which have\nbeen [detailed by WatchGuard.](https://detection.watchguard.com/)\n\n\"Working closely with the FBI, CISA, DOJ, and UK NCSC., WatchGuard has investigated\nand developed a remediation for Cyclops Blink, a sophisticated state-sponsored botnet, that\nmay have affected a limited number of WatchGuard firewall appliances,\" said a WatchGuard\nstatement.\n\n\"WatchGuard customers and partners can eliminate the potential threat posed by malicious\nactivity from the botnet by immediately enacting WatchGuard's 4-Step Cyclops Blink\nDiagnosis and Remediation Plan,\" it added.\n\nThe NCSC warned that any passwords present on a device infected by Cyclops Blink should\nbe assumed to be compromised and should be changed.\n\nOther advice about protecting networks from cyberattacks includes avoiding the exposure of\nmanagement interfaces of network devices to the internet, keeping devices up to date with\nthe latest security patches, and using [multi-factor authentication.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/multi-factor-authentication-use-it-for-all-the-people-that-access-your-network-all-the-time/#ftag=CAD-00-10aag7e)\n\n\n-----\n\n[The NCSC notes that the advisory is not directly linked to the current situation in Ukraine.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-sandworm-malware-cyclops-blink-replaces-vpnfilter)\n\n## MORE ON CYBERSECURITY\n\n\n-----",
