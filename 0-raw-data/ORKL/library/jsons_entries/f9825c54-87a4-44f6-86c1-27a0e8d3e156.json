However, in reality, it\nis a variant of the Chaos Ransomware.\n\n[In June 2021, a threat actor began selling a Chaos ransomware builder that allowed](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/chaos-ransomware-a-dangerous-proof-of-concept.html)\nwannabe criminals to create their very own ransomware infection with customized ransom\nnotes, encrypted file extensions, and other features.\n\nBy default, the Chaos builder pretends to be Ryuk, using the .ryuk extension for encrypted\nfiles, as shown below.\n\n**Files encrypted**\n\n**by the Chaos ransomware variant**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhat makes the new WannaFriendMe ransomware stand out is that instead of demanding\ncryptocurrency as a ransom payment, it requires victims to purchase a decryptor from\nRoblox's Game Pass store using Robux, as can be read in the ransom note below:\n\n\n-----\n\n----- YOUR FILES HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED! ----\nDon't panic, your files are decryptable, But your files can only be decrypted with our\nown decrypter tool! To get this decrypter, you must buy this gamepass:\nhttps://www.roblox.com/game-pass/49955147/Ryuk-Decrypter\n\nYOU MUST HAVE A ROBLOX ACCOUNT TO BUY THE GAMEPASS, BUY 1700\nROBUX AND THEN BUY THE GAMEPASS ABOVE.\n\nAFTER BUYING THE GAMEPASS, CONTACT xxx@icloud.com WITH YOUR\nUSERNAME AND SCREENSHOT OF YOU OWNING THE GAMEPASS. DO NOT\nDELETE THE GAMEPASS OTHERWISE YOU WILL DISOWN THE GAMEPASS.\n\nWhen visiting the URL to the Roblox Game Pass store, you can see that the 'Ryuk\nDecrypter' is being sold by a user named 'iRazormind' for 1,499 Robux and was last updated\non June 5th.\n\n**Decryptor sold as a Roblox Game Pass**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe problem with Chaos ransomware variants is that they not only encrypt your data but also\ndestroy it in many cases.\n\nWhile encrypting a device, any file greater than 2MB in size will be overwritten with random\ndata and not encrypted. This means that even if you purchase a decryptor, only files smaller\nthan 2MB can be recovered.\n\n\n-----\n\n**WannaFriendMe source code showing how it destroys files**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhile it is unclear how this ransomware is distributed or if it has been used in attacks, its\ndestructive nature and its targeting of young gamers could lead to significant damage.\n\nThis is not the first time Chaos ransomware variants have targeted gamers.\n\n[In October, threat actors targeted Japanese Minecraft players with 'alt lists' allegedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chaos-ransomware-targets-gamers-via-fake-minecraft-alt-lists/)\ncontaining stolen Minecraft accounts but encrypted devices with the Chaos ransomware\nvariant instead.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[Hello XD ransomware now drops a backdoor while encrypting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hello-xd-ransomware-now-drops-a-backdoor-while-encrypting/)\n\n[Confluence servers hacked to deploy AvosLocker, Cerber2021 ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/confluence-servers-hacked-to-deploy-avoslocker-cerber2021-ransomware/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - June 10th 2022 - Targeting Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-june-10th-2022-targeting-linux/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
