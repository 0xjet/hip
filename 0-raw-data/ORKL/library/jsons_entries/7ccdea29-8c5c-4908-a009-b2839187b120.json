We are referring to\nthese campaigns as Metamorfo. Across the stages of these campaigns, we have observed the\nuse of several tactics and techniques to evade detection and deliver the malicious payload. In\nthis blog post we dissect two of the main campaigns and explain how they work.\n\n### Campaign #1\n\nThe kill chain starts with an email containing an HTML attachment with a refresh tag that uses\na Google URL shortener as the target. Figure 1 shows a sample email, and Figure 2 show the\ncontents of the HTML file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Malicious Email with HTML Attachment\n\nFigure 2: Contents of HTML File\n\nWhen the URL is loaded, it redirects the victim to a cloud storage site such as GitHub,\nDropbox, or Google Drive to download a ZIP file. An example is shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: URL Shortener Redirects to Github Link\n\nThe ZIP archive contains a malicious portable executable (PE) file with embedded HTML\napplication (HTA). The user has to unzip the archive and double-click the executable for the\ninfection chain to continue. The PE file is a simple HTA script compiled into an executable.\nWhen the user double-clicks the executable, the malicious HTA file is extracted to %temp%\nand executed by mshta.exe.\n\nThe HTA script (Figure 4) contains VBS code that fetches a second blob of VBS code encoded\nin base64 form from hxxp://<redacted>/ilha/pz/logs.php.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Contents of HTA File\n\nAfter the second stage of VBS is decoded (Figure 5 and Figure 6), the script downloads the\nfinal stage from hxxp://<redacted>/28022018/pz.zip.\n\nFigure 5: Contents of Decoded VBS\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: More Contents of Decoded VBS\n\nThe downloaded ZIP file contains four files. Two are PE files. One is a legitimate Windows tool,\npvk2pfx.exe, that is abused for DLL side-loading. One is the malicious banking Trojan as\nthe DLL.\n\nThe VBS code unzips the archive, changes the extension of the legitimate Windows tool from\n.png to .exe, and renames the malicious DLL as cryptui.dll. The VBS code also creates a file in\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Administrador\\car.dat with random strings. These random strings are used to\nname the Windows tool, which is then executed. Since this tool depends on a legitimate DLL\nnamed cryptui.dll, the search order path will find the malicious Trojan with the same name in\nthe same directory and load it into its process space.\n\nIn Q4 of 2017, a similar malspam campaign delivered the same banking Trojan by using an\nembedded JAR file attached in the email instead of an HTML attachment. On execution, the\nJava code downloaded a ZIP archive from a cloud file hosting site such as Google Drive,\nDropbox, or Github. The ZIP archive contained a legitimate Microsoft tool and the malicious\nTrojan.\n\n**Banking Trojan Analysis**\n\nThe Trojan expects to be located in the hardcoded directory C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\Administrador\\\\\nalong with three other files to start execution. As seen in Figure 7, these files are:\n\ncar.dat (randomly generated name given to Windows tool)\ni4.dt (VBS script that downloads the same zip file)\nid (ID given to host)\ncryptui.dll (malicious Trojan)\n\nFigure 7: Contents of ZIP Archive\n\n\n-----\n\n**Persistence**\n\nThe string found in the file C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Administrador\\\\car.dat is extracted and used to\nadd the registry key Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\<string from car.dat> for\npersistence, as shown in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8: Reading from car.dat File\n\nThe sample also looks for a file named i4.dt in the same directory and extracts the contents of\nit, renames the file to icone.vbs, and creates a new persistent key (Figure 9) in\n\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to open this file.\n\nFigure 9: Persistence Keys\n\nThe VBS code in this file (Figure 10) has the ability to recreate the whole chain and download\nthe same ZIP archive.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Contents of VBS Script\n\nNext, the Trojan searches for several folders in the Program Files directories, including:\n\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\AVG\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\AVAST Software\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Diebold\\\\Warsaw\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Trusteer\\\\Rapport\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Java\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\scpbrad\n\nIf any of the folders are found, this information, along with the hostname and Operating System\nversion, is sent to a hardcoded domain with the hardcoded User-Agent value “Mozilla/5.0\n(Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0” in the format shown in\nFigure 11. The value of AT is “<host_name+OS&MD>=<list of folders found>”.\n\nFigure 11: Network Traffic for Host Enumeration\n\nThe sample iterates through the running processes, kills the following, and prevents them from\nlaunching:\n\nmsconfig.exe\nTASKMGR.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nregedit.exe\nccleaner64.exe\ntaskmgr.exe\nitauaplicativo.exe\n\nNext, it uses GetForegroundWindow to get a handle to the window the user is viewing\nand GetWindowText to extract the title of the window. The title is compared against a\nhardcoded list of Brazilian banking and digital coin sites. The list is extensive and includes\nmajor organizations and smaller entities alike.\n\nIf any of those names are found and the browser is one of the following, the Trojan will\nterminate that browser.\n\nfirefox.exe\nchrome.exe\nopera.exe\nsafari.exe\n\nThe folder C:\\Users\\Public\\Administrador\\logs\\ is created to store screenshots, as well as the\nnumber of mouse clicks the user has triggered while browsing the banking sites (Figure 12).\nThe screenshots are continuously saved as .jpg images.\n\nFigure 12: Malware Capturing Mouse Clicks\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nThe command and control (C2) server is selected based on the string in the file “id”:\n\nal -> '185.43.209[.]182'\ngr -> '212.237.46[.]6'\npz -> '87.98.146[.]34'\nmn -> ’80.211.140[.]235'\n\nThe connection to one of the hosts is then started over raw TCP on port 9999. The command\nand control communication generally follows the pattern <|Command |>, for example:\n\n\n-----\n\n<|dispida|>logs>SAVE< sends the screenshots collected in gh.txt.\n'<PING>' is sent from C2 to host, and '<PONG>' is sent from host to C2, to keep the\nconnection alive.\n'<|INFO|>' retrieves when the infection first started based on the file timestamp from\ncar.dat along with '<|>' and the host information.\n\nThere were only four possible IP addresses that the sample analyzed could connect to based\non the strings found in the file “id”. After further researching the associated infrastructure of the\nC2 (Figure 13), we were able to find potential number of victims for this particular campaign.\n\nFigure 13: Command and Control Server Open Directories\n\nInside the open directories, we were able to get the following directories corresponding to the\ndifferent active campaigns. Inside each directory we could find statistics with the number of\nvictims reporting to the C2. As of 3/27/2018, the numbers were:\n\nal – 843\nap – 879\ngr – 397\nkk – 2,153\nmn – 296\npz – 536\ntm – 187\n\nA diagram summarizing Campaign #1 is shown in Figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Infection Chain of Campaign #1\n\n### Campaign #2\n\nIn the second campaign, FireEye Labs observed emails with links to legitimate domains (such\nas hxxps://s3-ap-northeast1.amazonaws[.]com/<redacted>/Boleto_Protesto_Mes_Marco_2018.html) or compromised\ndomains (such as hxxps://curetusu.<redacted>-industria[.]site/) that use a refresh tag with a\nURL shortener as the target. The URL shortener redirects the user to an online storage site,\nsuch as Google Drive, Github, or Dropbox, that hosts a malicious ZIP file. A sample phishing\nemail is shown in Figure 15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Example Phishing Email\n\nThe ZIP file contains a malicious executable written in AutoIt (contents of this executable are\nshown in Figur 16). When executed by the user, it drops a VBS file to a randomly created and\nnamed directory (such as C:\\mYPdr\\TkCJLQPX\\HwoC\\mYPdr.vbs) and fetches contents from\nthe C2 server.\n\nFigure 16: Contents of Malicious AutoIt Executable\n\nTwo files are downloaded from the C2 server. One is a legitimate Microsoft tool and the other is\na malicious DLL:\n\nhttps[:]//panel-dark[.]com/w3af/img2.jpg\nhttps[:]//panel-dark[.]com/w3af/img1.jpg\n\nThose files are downloaded and saved into random directories named with the following\npatterns:\n\n<current user dir>\\<5 random chars>\\<8 random chars>\\<4 random chars>\\<5 random\nchars>.exe\n<current user dir>\\<5 random chars>\\<8 random chars>\\<4 random chars>\\CRYPTUI.dll\n\nThe execution chain ensures that persistence is set on the affected system using a .lnk file in\nthe Startup directory. The .lnk file shown in Figure 17 opens the malicious VBS dropped on the\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: Persistence Key\n\nThe VBS file (Figure 18) will launch and execute the downloaded legitimate Windows tool,\nwhich in this case is Certmgr.exe. This tool will be abused using the DLL side loading\ntechnique. The malicious Cryptui.dll is loaded into the program instead of the legitimate one\nand executed.\n\nFigure 18: Contents of Dropped VBS File\n\n**Banking Trojan Analysis**\n\nLike the Trojan from the first campaign, this sample is executed through search-order hijacking.\nIn this case, the binary abused is a legitimate Windows tool, Certmgr.exe, that loads Cryptui.dll.\nSince this tool depends on a legitimate DLL named cryptui.dll, the search order path will find\nthe malicious Trojan with the same name in the same directory and load it into its process\nspace.\n\nThe malicious DLL exports 21 functions. Only DllEntryPoint contains real code that is\nnecessary to start the execution of the malicious code. The other functions return hardcoded\nvalues that serve no real purpose.\n\nOn execution, the Trojan creates a mutex called \"correria24\" to allow only one instance of it to\nrun at a time.\n\nThe malware attempts to resolve “www.goole[.]com” (most likely a misspelling). If successful, it\nsends a request to hxxp://api-api[.]com/json in order to detect the external IP of the victim. The\nresult is parsed and execution continues only if the country code matches “BR”, as shown in\nFigure 19.\n\nFigure 19: Country Code Check\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware creates an empty file in %appdata%\\Mariapeirura on first execution, which serves\nas a mutex lock, before attempting to send any collected information to the C2 server. This is\ndone in order to get only one report per infected host.\n\nThe malware collects host information, base64 encodes it, and sends it to two C2 servers. The\nfollowing items are gathered from the infected system:\n\nOS name\nOS version\nOS architecture\nAV installed\nList of banking software installed\nIP address\nDirectory where malware is being executed from\n\nThe information is sent to hxxp://108.61.188.171/put.php (Figure 20).\n\nFigure 20: Host Recon Data Sent to First C2 Server\n\nThe same information is sent to panel-dark[.]com/Contador/put.php (Figure 21).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21: Host Recon Data Sent to Second C2 Server\n\nThe malware alters the value of registry key\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\ExtendedUIHoverTime to\n2710 in order to change the number of milliseconds a thumbnail is showed while hovering on\nthe taskbar, as seen in Figure 22.\n\nFigure 22: ExtendedUIHoverTime Registry Key Change\n\nLike the Trojan from the first campaign, this sample checks if the foreground window's title\ncontains names of Brazilian banks and digital coins by looking for hardcoded strings.\n\nThe malware displays fake forms on top of the banking sites and intercepts credentials from\nthe victims. It can also display a fake Windows Update whenever there is nefarious activity in\nthe background, as seen in Figure 23.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23: Fake Form Displaying Windows Update\n\nThe sample also contains a keylogger functionality, as shown in Figure 24.\n\nFigure 24: Keylogger Function\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Trojan s command and control command structure is identical to the first sample. The\ncommands are denoted by the <|Command|> syntax.\n\n<|OK|> gets a list of banking software installed on the host.\n'<PING>' is sent from C2 to host, and '<PONG>' is sent from host to C2, to keep\nconnection alive.\n<|dellLemb|> deletes the registry key \\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\notes.\nEXECPROGAM calls ShellExecute to run the application given in the command.\nEXITEWINDOWS calls ExitWindowsEx.\nNOVOLEMBRETE creates and stores data sent with the command in the registry key\n\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\notes.\n\nFigure 25: Partial List of Victims\n\nThis sample contains most of the important strings encrypted. We provide the following script\n(Figure 26) in order to decrypt them.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26: String Decryption Script\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe use of multi-stage infection chains makes it challenging to research these types of\ncampaigns all the way through.\n\nAs demonstrated by our research, the attackers are using various techniques to evade\ndetection and infect unsuspecting Portuguese-speaking users with banking Trojans. The use of\npublic cloud infrastructure to help deliver the different stages plays a particularly big role in\n\n\n-----\n\ndelivering the malicious payload. The use of different infection methods combined with the\nabuse of legitimate signed binaries to load malicious code makes these campaigns worth\nhighlighting.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nCampaign #1\n\n**TYPE** **HASH** **DESCRIPTION**\n\nMD5 860fa744d8c82859b41e00761c6e25f3 PE with Embedded HTA\n\nMD5 3e9622d1a6d7b924cefe7d3458070d98 PE with Embedded HTA\n\nMD5 f402a482fd96b0a583be2a265acd5e74 PE with Embedded HTA\n\nMD5 f329107f795654bfc62374f8930d1e12 PE with Embedded HTA\n\nMD5 789a021c051651dbc9e01c5d8c0ce129 PE with Embedded HTA\n\nMD5 68f818fa156d45889f36aeca5dc75a81 PE with Embedded HTA\n\nMD5 c2cc04be25f227b13bcb0b1d9811e2fe cryptui.dll\n\nMD5 6d2cb9e726c9fac0fb36afc377be3aec id\n\nMD5 dd73f749d40146b6c0d2759ba78b1764 i4.dt\n\nMD5 d9d1e72165601012b9d959bd250997b3 VBS file with commands to create staging\ndirectories for malware\n\nMD5 03e4f8327fbb6844e78fda7cdae2e8ad pvk2pfx.exe [Legit Windows Tool]\n\nURL [hxxp://5.83.162.24/ilha/pz/logs.php](http://5.83.162.24/ilha/pz/logs.php)\n\nURL [hxxp://5.83.162.24/28022018/pz.zip](http://5.83.162.24/28022018/pz.zip)\n\nC2 ibamanetibamagovbr[.]org/virada/pz/logs.php\n\nURL sistemasagriculturagov[.]org\n\nURL hxxp://187.84.229.107/05022018/al.zip\n\nCampaign #2\n\n**TYPE** **HASH** **DESCRIPTION**\n\nMD5 2999724b1aa19b8238d4217565e31c8e AutoIT Dropper\n\nMD5 181c8f19f974ad8a84b8673d487bbf0d img1.jpg [lLegit Windows Tool]\n\nMD5 d3f845c84a2bd8e3589a6fbf395fea06 img2.jpg [Banking Trojan]\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5 2365fb50eeb6c4476218507008d9a00b Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 d726b53461a4ec858925ed31cef15f1e Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 a8b2b6e63daf4ca3e065d1751cac723b Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 d9682356e78c3ebca4d001de760848b0 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 330721de2a76eed2b461f24bab7b7160 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 6734245beda04dcf5af3793c5d547923 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 a920b668079b2c1b502fdaee2dd2358f Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 fe09217cc4119dedbe85d22ad23955a1 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 82e2c6b0b116855816497667553bdf11 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 4610cdd9d737ecfa1067ac30022d793b Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 34a8dda75aea25d92cd66da53a718589 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 88b808d8164e709df2ca99f73ead2e16 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 d3f845c84a2bd8e3589a6fbf395fea06 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 28a0968163b6e6857471305aee5c17e9 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 1285205ae5dd5fa5544b3855b11b989d Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 613563d7863b4f9f66590064b88164c8 Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nMD5 3dd43e69f8d71fcc2704eb73c1ea7daf Variants of Banking Trojan\n\nC2 https[:]//panel-dark[.]com/w3af/img2.jpg\n\nC2 https[:]//panel-dark[.]com/w3af/img1.jpg\n\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\n\n\n-----",
