It carried\nthe usual trappings of a spear phish sent by advanced persistent threat actors. It was short,\nappeared to come from an address the target knew, and attached a payload that when\nclicked surreptitiously installed potent malware on the reader's computer.\n\nBut there was something highly unusual about this spear phish, one that would throw the\nonce-shadowy Hellsing group into the limelight. According to analysis from antivirus provider\nKaspersky Lab, the targeted group in the spear phish wasn't a government agency or\nembassy as is usually the case. Instead, it was Naikon, one of Asia's largest APT gangs and\na rival to Hellsing. Naikon has been active for years and is known for attacks targeting\ngovernment and military leaders, diplomats, aviation authorities, and police in countries such\nas the Philippines Malaysia Cambodia and Indonesia\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hellsing-spear-phish.png)\nKaspersky Lab\nTo be fair to Hellsing, it was Naikon that started the fight. In February, about six weeks prior\nto the spear phish Hellsing sent, Naikon had blasted out a spear phishing run of its own. One\nof the many groups that received the Naikon e-mail was Hellsing. Rather than blindly taking\nthe bait, as is the case in so many APT-related spear phishes, Hellsing members took the\ntime to check the legitimacy of the e-mail with the purported sender. When the sender\nsupplied an unsatisfactory response, Hellsing members fired off their own spear phish\ndirected at the Naikon gang. Kaspersky researchers believe the event may mark the\nemergence of a new trend in cyber criminal activity: APT-on-APT attacks.\n\n\"The targeting of the Naikon group by Hellsing, in some sort of a vengeful vampire-hunting'Empire Strikes Back' style, is fascinating,\" Costin Raiu, director of global research and\nanalyst team at Kaspersky Lab, said in a press release. \"In the past, we’ve seen APT groups\naccidentally hitting each other while stealing address books from victims and then massmailing everyone on each of these lists. However, considering the targeting and origin of the\nattack, it seems more likely that this is an example of a deliberate APT-on-APT attack.\"\n\nWatch Video At: [https://youtu.be/R7n6zd4T6Bg](https://youtu.be/R7n6zd4T6Bg)\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back: welcome to the Wars of Advanced Persistent Threats.\nParenthetically, a few weeks after Kaspersky Lab researchers observed Naikon targeting\n[Hellsing came the March 8, 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Three days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370)\nlater, Naikon launched a campaign that hit most of the countries involved in the search, with\nbooby-trapped e-mails sent to political and military leaders, diplomats, civil aviation\nauthorities, and police. The Naikon gang, it seemed, was eager to learn whatever it could\nabout the behind-the-scenes recovery mission for the missing flight.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hellsing-map.png)\nKaspersky Lab\nKaspersky Lab researchers said Hellsing is known to have infected only about 20\norganizations, an indication of just how niche and selective the attack group is. Hellsing is\nalso highly selective about the regions it targets, limiting them to the US, Malaysia, the\nPhilippines, Indonesia, and India. The name Hellsing comes from the project title a developer\ncarelessly left in some of the malicious binaries the group uses in its campaigns. It remains\nunknown if Hellsing succeeded in its attempt to infect Naikon.\n\n[Enlarge](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hellsing-debug.png)\nKaspersky Lab\nAn analysis of the command and control infrastructure shows Hellsing has ties to fellow\ngroups known as PlayfulDragon, Mirage, and Vixen Panda. Server locations also suggest\nlinks to the APT group known as Cycldek or Goblin Panda. Kaspersky's blog post lays out a\nfeast of other technical details about the gang.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere s a possibility Hellsing may have remained behind the scenes had they not been\ncaught in the act of striking back at a rival APT gang. This may have been one of the first\ntimes an APT-on-APT attack has been witnessed, but it's probably not the last.\n\n\n-----",
