While it started out as a credential-harvesting\nthreat mostly focusing on e-banking, its plugin-based\ndesign has made it much more than just a threat\nfocused on financial data theft. Security companies\nand researchers have previously analyzed a wide\nrange of modules, proving that the Trojan is still under\nactive development and undergoing constant “feature\nupgrades”.\n\nThe flexibility allowed by this modular architecture has\nturned TrickBot into a very complex and sophisticated\nmalware capable of a wide range of malicious\nactivities, as long as there is a plugin for it.\n\nFrom “add-ons” for stealing OpenSSH and OpenVPN\nsensitive data, to modules that perform SIM-swapping\nattacks to take control of a user’s telephone number,\nand even disabling Windows built-in security\nmechanisms before downloading its main modules,\nTrickBot is a jack-of-all-trades. Another interesting\naspect is that, while there are a handful of core\nmodules, each new module is accompanied by a\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\n\nconfiguration file, potentially making each functionality\nfully independent.\n\nTrickBot has been mostly distributed through spam\ncampaigns but it was also seen in cahoots with other\nthreats. Distributed by the Emotet spam-sending botnet\nto deliver Ryuk ransomware, TrickBot operators have\nextended its capabilities into one of the most advanced\nmalware delivery vehicles out there.\n\nThis combo relied on Emotet for its huge spam campaign\nand effective social engineering, on TrickBot for its\naggressive network spreading capabilities, and on\nthe Ryuk ransomware for the final payload and direct\nmonetization. The spam campaigns have focused on\ntargeting organizations by going after enterprise assets.\n\n## New module: rdpScanDll\n\nThe new module was discovered on January 30, and its\nmain functionality is to perform bruteforce operations on\na list of targets.\n\nThe modus operandi is similar to that of other plugins.\nThe TrickBot executable will download the plugin and\nits configuration file (from one of the available online\nC&Cs) containing a list of servers with whom the plugin\nwill communicate to retrieve commands to be executed.\nTrickBot will load the plugin, executing the “start” and\n“control” exported functions, passing the configuration\nfile as an argument for the last mention function.\n\nThis plugin shares the configuration file with another\nmodule, vncDll, but uses different URL endpoints to\ndistinguish itself.\n\nThe communication with these new servers has a certain\npattern. The structure of the URLs the plugin is using is\nas follows:\n\n_https://<C&C>/<tag>/<computerID>/<controlEndpoint>_\n\nWhere:\n\n_•_ _C&C – is one of the command and control servers_\nfrom the configuration file\n\n_•_ _tag – is the group tag used by the underlying TrickBot_\nsample\n\n\n\n_•_ _computerID – is the computer ID used by the_\nunderlying TrickBot sample\n\n_•_ _controlEndpoint is one of the following:_\n\n_•_ _/rdp/mode - used to determine what kind of attack_\nthe plugin should use\n\n_•_ _/rdp/freq - used to determine how frequently to_\nreport different statuses back to the server\n\n_•_ _/rdp/domains - a list of IP: Port pairs that will be_\nattacked (the targets); note that when the port is\nmissing, the plugin will use the canonical RDP port\nof 3389\n\n_•_ _/rdp/over - a list of IP: Port pairs that will be_\nattacked after the previous list (returned by /rdp/\ndomains) is exhausted\n\n_•_ _/rdp/dict - a list of passwords to try in the_\nbruteforce process\n\n_•_ _/rdp/names - a list of usernames to try in the_\nbruteforce process\n\n_•_ _/81 - used to report different statuses back to the_\nserver (what IP: Port pairs are online or offline and\nwhat username - passwords have matched)\n\nThe plugin has three attack modes at its disposal: check,\n**trybrute and brute.**\n\n##### Check Mode\nThe check mode should check for RDP connection on the\nlist of targets (both /rdp/domains and /rdp/over). To do\nthat, it first retrieves the frequency, then it retrieves and\nchecks the list of targeted IPs from /rdp/domains, and\nfinally it retrieves and checks the list of targeted IPs from\n_/rdp/over. During testing, we found the plugin retrieves_\nand checks the IP list from /rdp/over repeatedly. If the\nplugin is deployed on a larger number of victims, these\ncollective repeated checks could flood the C&C server\nwith requests.\n\n##### TryBute Mode\nThe trybrute mode will perform a bruteforce operation\non the list of targeted IPs returned by /rdp/domains,\nand later on the one returned by /rdp/over, using the\nusernames from /rdp/names and the passwords from /\n_rdp/dict._\n\n##### Brute Mode\nThe plugin looks like it’s still in development, besides\nthe inclusion in the executable of a set of functions\nthat aren’t called, the attack mode brute seems broken.\nThe brute attack mode doesn’t fetch the username list,\ncausing the plugin to use null passwords and usernames\nto a thenticate on the targets list\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\nIf a host is found online, the plugin reports to the C&C through a POST multipart request to the /81 endpoint with the\nlist of online IPs. The same happens if the plugin finds the credentials to a certain target. The plugin also reports to the\n/81 endpoint on a regular basis, with information about its state. At the same time, it will report to the main TrickBot\nexecutable statistics about the state of the execution and, when it finds working credentials, the username and\npassword it found for a particular target.\n\nDuring the analysis of pScanDll module, we were able to retrieve several updates for the lists of targeted IPs (both /\n_rdp/domains and /rdp/over). At the time of writing, the lists contained 49 IP addresses (/rdp/domains) and 5,964 IP_\naddresses (/rdp/over). Most of these targets are located in Unites States and Hong Kong. The geographical distribution\nof these lists is illustrated below.\n\n**Fig. 1 - Geographical distribution of /rdp/over IP addresses**\n\n**Fig. 2 - Geographical distribution of /rdp/domains IP addresses**\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\nWhen performing a screen on these targets, we found that they fall on different verticals, as observed in the chart\nbelow:\n\n**Fig. 3 - Most affected verticals**\n\n## Modules overview\n\nTrickBot has an embedded list of command and control servers and a list of “must-have” plugins. First, it contacts the\nservers to retrieve these plugins, as well as an updated list of command and control servers and an additional list of\nservers, used only for downloading purposes. After these initial actions, it awaits further instructions. One command is\nto start a certain plugin. If that plugin does not exist, it uses the list of download servers to retrieve it first, then it loads\nthe plugin and executes the indicated exported function (from the command). As a persistence mechanism, some of\nthe plugins are loaded automatically when TrickBot malware is started, without waiting for a command from the C&C\nservers.\n\nDuring the last 6 months of close monitoring and gathering statistics about this threat, our systems were able to\nretrieve updates for several different active plugins, gathered around different functionalities, proving to have all the\nright tools to perform an end-to-end attack:\n\n**_•_** **_Lateral Movement_**\n\n_•_ _WormDll/mWormDll/tWormDll - a worm component responsible for spreading into the local network via SMB by_\nexploiting through EternalBlue\n\n_•_ _TabDll - uses EternalRomance to spread into the network via SMB_\n\n_•_ _ShareDll/mShareDll/tShareDLL - remote service manager using stolen credentials to install remote services on_\nother computers from the network\n\n**_•_** **_Reconnaissance_**\n\n_•_ _SystemInfo - collects information about the affected system_\n\n_N_ _kDll_ f k i\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\n_•_ _Psfin - meant to identify POS-related terminals inside the compromised domain_\n\n**_•_** **_Collection_**\n\n_•_ _ImportDll - collects varying browser information such as cookies or browser configuration_\n\n_•_ _Pwgrab - steals credentials from various applications_\n\n_•_ _aDll – steals active directory credentials_\n\n**_•_** **_Setting Foothold_**\n\n_•_ _NewBCtestnDll – performs reverse proxy and executes commands_\n\n   - VncDll – used by the attacker as RAT, giving the option to remotely view and control the victim’s computer\n\n**_•_** **_Exfiltration_**\n\n_•_ _Mailsearcher - searches for files with certain extensions (usually document files)_\n\n**_•_** **_Financial data theft_**\n\n_•_ _InjectDll – used to steal financial information through webinjects by monitoring various banking websites_\n\n**_•_** **_Credential Access_**\n\n_•_ _RdpscanDLL – performs bruteforce attack on a certain list of targets (indicated by the attacker)_\n\nWhile monitoring the updates of malicious plugins, we observed that the most frequently updated ones were those\nperforming lateral movement: 32.07% of them were wormDll, 31.44% were shareDll and 16.35% were tabDll. The rest of\nthe plugins had fewer than 5% occurrences.\n\n**Fig. 4 - Timeline for plugin update**\n\nSome of these plugins can have configuration files, which serve varying purposes. If needed, they will be retrieved from\nthe command and control servers. Some of those retrieved by our researchers are described below:\n\n_•_ _dinj – configuration file for injectDLL plugin, containing information about targeted financial institutions; the attack_\nuses server-side injections\n\n_•_ _sinj - configuration file for injectDLL plugin, containing information about targeted financial institutions; the attack_\nuses redirections (also known as web fake injections).\n\n_•_ _dpost – also used by the injectDLL module, containing a list of servers; the stolen financial information is sent to_\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\n_•_ _mailconf - used by mailsearcher for exfiltration_\n\n_•_ _srv - used by rdpScanDLL as a list of C&C servers_\n\n_•_ _vncconf - used by vncDLL and rdpScanDll for as a list of C&C servers_\n\n## C&C servers\n\nOur monitoring systems focused on collecting new command and control servers, both from embedded lists inside the\nsamples and by constantly checking for C&C updates. We were able to retrieve 3,460 IP addresses, divided into 2,926\ncommand and control servers and 556 servers dedicated to downloading new plugins, and 22 IPs serving both roles.\nThe dynamics of the infrastructure can be defined by a rough statistic of around 100 new IPs added each month with\neach IP having an average lifetime of about 16 days.\n\nIllustrated below is the geographical distribution of these servers. As can be observed, the threat actor prefers\ninfrastructure from Russia.\n\n**Fig. 5 - Geographical distribution of Command and Control servers**\n\n**Fig. 6 - Geographical distribution of Servers used for download purposes**\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\n## Victims\n\nSince TrickBot is a mass attack threat, spreading mostly through spam e-mails, victims fall into multiple verticals and\nare spread all over the globe. Telemetry from our Network Attack Defense technology for the last month shows that\nmost victims attempting to connect to a command and control server are based in the US, followed by Spain. This kind\nof distribution usually can be observed when massive spam campaigns are focused on particular geographical areas.\n\n**Fig 7 - Geographical distribution of victims contacting command and control server over the last month**\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe new rdpScanDll module may be the latest in a long line of modules that have been used by the TrickBot Trojan, but\nit’s one that stands out because of its use of a highly specific list of IP addresses. While the module seems to be under\ndevelopment, as one attack mode seems broken, newer versions of rdpScanDll will likely fix this and potentially add\nnew ones.\n\nThe new module also offers a glimpse into how TrickBot operators act. Using an existing infrastructure of TrickBot\nvictims, the new module suggests attackers may also be focusing on verticals other than financial, such as\ntelecommunications services and education & research.\n\n\n-----\n\nNew TrickBot Module Bruteforces RDP Connections, Targets Select Telecommunication Services in US and Hong Kong\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nAn up-to-date list of indicators of compromise is available to Bitdefender Advanced Threat Intelligence users.
