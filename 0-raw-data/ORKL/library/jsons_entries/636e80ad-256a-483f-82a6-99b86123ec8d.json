Since our last update, TAG has](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe/)\nobserved a continuously growing number of threat actors using the war as a lure in phishing\nand malware campaigns. Similar to other reports, we have also observed threat actors\nincreasingly target critical infrastructure entities including oil and gas, telecommunications\nand manufacturing.\n\nGovernment-backed actors from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, as well as various\nunattributed groups, have used various Ukraine war-related themes in an effort to get targets\nto open malicious emails or click malicious links. Financially motivated and criminal actors\nare also using current events as a means for targeting users.\n\nAs always, we continue to publish details surrounding the actions we take against\n[coordinated influence operations in our quarterly TAG bulletin. We promptly identify and](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q1-2022/)\nremove any such content but have not observed any significant shifts from the normal levels\nof activity that occur in the region.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is a deeper look at the campaign activity TAG has observed and the actions the team\nhas taken to protect our users over the past few weeks:\n\n**APT28 or Fancy Bear, a threat actor attributed to Russia GRU, was observed targeting**\nusers in Ukraine with a new variant of malware. The malware, distributed via email\nattachments inside of password protected zip files (ua_report.zip), is a .Net executable that\nwhen executed steals cookies and saved passwords from Chrome, Edge and Firefox\nbrowsers. The data is then exfiltrated via email to a compromised email account.\n\nMalware samples:\n\n[710faabf217a5cd3431670558603a45edb1e01970f2a8710514c2cc3dd8c2424](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/710faabf217a5cd3431670558603a45edb1e01970f2a8710514c2cc3dd8c2424/)\n[39d242660c6d5dbe97d5725bbfed0f583344d18840ccd902fffdd71af12e20ec](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/39d242660c6d5dbe97d5725bbfed0f583344d18840ccd902fffdd71af12e20ec/)\n\n[TAG would like to thank the Yahoo! Paranoids Advanced Cyber Threats Team for their](https://www.yahooinc.com/technology/paranoids-blog/)\ncollaboration in this investigation.\n\n**Turla, a group TAG attributes to Russia FSB, continues to run campaigns against the Baltics,**\ntargeting defense and cybersecurity organizations in the region. Similar to recently observed\nactivity, these campaigns were sent via email and contained a unique link per target that led\nto a DOCX file hosted on attacker controlled infrastructure. When opened, the DOCX file\nwould attempt to download a unique PNG file from the same attacker controlled domain.\n\nRecently observed Turla domains:\n\nwkoinfo.webredirect[.]org\njadlactnato.webredirect[.]org\n\n**COLDRIVER, a Russian-based threat actor sometimes referred to as Callisto, continues to**\nuse Gmail accounts to send credential phishing emails to a variety of Google and nonGoogle accounts. The targets include government and defense officials, politicians, NGOs\nand think tanks, and journalists. The group's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for\nthese campaigns have shifted slightly from including phishing links directly in the email, to\nalso linking to PDFs and/or DOCs hosted on Google Drive and Microsoft One Drive. Within\nthese files is a link to an attacker controlled phishing domain.\n\n[These phishing domains have been blocked through Google Safe Browsing – a service that](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\nidentifies unsafe websites across the web and notifies users and website owners of potential\nharm.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of this technique\n\nRecently observed COLDRIVER credential phishing domains:\n\n\n-----\n\ncache-dns[.]com\ndocs-shared[.]com\ndocuments-forwarding[.]com\ndocuments-preview[.]com\nprotection-link[.]online\nwebresources[.]live\n\n**Ghostwriter, a Belarusian threat actor, has remained active during the course of the war and**\nrecently resumed targeting of Gmail accounts via credential phishing. This campaign,\ntargeting high risk individuals in Ukraine, contained links leading to compromised websites\nwhere the first stage phishing page was hosted. If the user clicked continue, they would be\nredirected to an attacker controlled site that collected the users credentials. There were no\naccounts compromised from this campaign and Google will alert all targeted users of these\n[attempts through our monthly government-backed attacker warnings.](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/03/reassuring-our-users-about-government.html)\n\nBoth pages from this campaign are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIn mid-April, TAG detected a Ghostwriter credential phishing campaign targeting Facebook\nusers. The targets, primarily located in Lithuania, were sent links to attacker controlled\ndomains from a domain spoofing the Facebook security team.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecently observed Ghostwriter credential phishing domains and emails:\n\nnoreply.accountsverify[.]top\nmicrosoftonline.email-verify[.]top\nlt-microsoftgroup.serure-email[.]online\nfacebook.com-validation[.]top\nlt-meta.com-verification[.]top\nlt-facebook.com-verification[.]top\n\n\n-----\n\nsecure@facebookgroup[.]lt\n\n**Curious Gorge, a group TAG attributes to China's PLA SSF, has remained active against**\ngovernment, military, logistics and manufacturing organizations in Ukraine, Russia and\nCentral Asia. In Russia, long running campaigns against multiple government organizations\nhave continued, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over the past week, TAG identified\nadditional compromises impacting multiple Russian defense contractors and manufacturers\nand a Russian logistics company.\n\n## Protecting Our Users\n\n[Upon discovery, all identified websites and domains were added to Safe Browsing to protect](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\nusers from further exploitation. We also send all targeted Gmail and Workspace users\n[government-backed attacker alerts notifying them of the activity. We encourage any potential](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9007870?hl=en)\n[targets to enable Google Account Level Enhanced Safe Browsing and ensure that all](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/new-protections-for-enhanced-safe.html)\ndevices are updated.\n\nThe team continues to work around the clock, focusing on the safety and security of our\nusers and the platforms that help them access and share important information. We’ll\ncontinue to take action, identify bad actors and share relevant information with others across\nindustry and governments, with the goal of bringing awareness to these issues, protecting\nusers and preventing future attacks. While we are actively monitoring activity related to\nUkraine and Russia, we continue to be just as vigilant in relation to other threat actors\nglobally, to ensure that they do not take advantage of everyone’s focus on this region.\n\n\n-----",
