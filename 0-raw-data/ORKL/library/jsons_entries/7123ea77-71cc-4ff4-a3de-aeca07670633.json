Presently, it has not been seen in_\n_the malware a functionality to spread outside of the LAN network._\n\n_Update (June 27 – 23.34 CEST): Shutting down the computer and not booting again could_\n_prevent the disk encryption, though several files can be already encrypted after the MBR is_\n_replaced and further infection through the network is attempted._\n\n_Update (June 27 – 22.28 CEST): Paying is no longer possible as the email to send the_\n_[Bitcoin wallet ID and “personal installation key” has been shut down by the provider. Thus,](https://posteo.de/en/blog/info-on-the-petrwrappetya-ransomware-email-account-in-question-already-blocked-since-midday)_\n_people shouldn’t pay for the ransom as they will not be able to receive the decryption key._\n\n_Update (June 27 – 21.20 CEST): ESET researchers have located the point from which this_\n_global epidemic has all started. Attackers have successfully compromised the accounting_\n_software M.E.Doc, popular across various industries in Ukraine, including financial_\n_institutions. Several of them executed a trojanized update of M.E.Doc, which allowed_\n_attackers to launch the massive ransomware campaign today which spread across the_\n_whole country and the rest of the world. M.E.Doc has today released a warning on its_\n_website._\n\nNumerous reports are coming out on social media about a new ransomware attack in\n[Ukraine, which could be related to the Petya family (subsequently being referred to as](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Diskcoder.Petya.A/description)\nNotPetya and ExPetya, due to its particularly unique characteristics), which is currently\ndetected by ESET as Win32/Diskcoder.C Trojan. If it successfully infects the MBR, it will\n[encrypt the whole drive itself. Otherwise, it encrypts all files, like Mischa.](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Filecoder.Mischa/description)\n\nFor spreading, it appears to be using a combination of the SMB exploit (EternalBlue) used\nby [WannaCryptor for getting inside the network, then spreading through PsExec for](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/16/check-eternalblue-pc-patched-wannacryptor-worm-vulnerability/)\nspreading within the network.\n\nThis dangerous combination may be the reason why this outbreak has spread globally and\nrapidly, even after the previous outbreaks have generated media headlines and hopefully\nmost vulnerabilities have been patched. It only takes one unpatched computer to get inside\nthe network, and the malware can get administrator rights and spread to other computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The journalist Christian Borys, for example, tweeted that the cyberattack has “allegedly hit”](https://twitter.com/ItsBorys/status/879683607312424960)\nbanks, power grid and postal companies, among others. Moreover, it appears that the\ngovernment has also come under attack. Borys has also tweeted an image put up on\nFacebook by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Pavlo Rozenko, which shows a computer\napparently being encrypted.\n\n[The National Bank of Ukraine has also put out a message on its website warning other](https://bank.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=51024788&cat_id=80928)\nbanks of the ransomware attack.\n\nIt stated: “Currently, the financial sector strengthened security measures and counter hacker\nattacks all financial market participants.”\n\nForbes [said that while there appear to be similarities with WannaCryptor – with others](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/06/27/ransomware-spreads-rapidly-hitting-power-companies-banks-airlines-metro/#783003187abd)\ndescribing it as WannaCry-esque – it is likely to be a variant of Petya.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn image, similar to the one witnessed by WannaCryptor victims, reportedly showing the\n[ransomware message is making the rounds online, with one from Group-IB showing the](https://twitter.com/GroupIB_GIB/status/879687387235971073)\nfollowing message (paraphrased):\n\n“If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they have been\nencrypted … We guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. All you\nneed to do is submit the payment [$300 bitcoins] and purchase the decryption key.”\n\nHowever, a spokesman said that “there is no effect on power supplies”, although it may be\ntoo early to ascertain this.\n\n[It appears that the ransomware attack is not specific to Ukraine. The Independent said that](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/hack-cyber-attack-ukraine-russia-wannacry-petya-security-internet-broken-computer-not-working-a7810626.html)\nSpain and India may also have been affected, as well as the Danish shipping company\nMaersk and the British advertising company WPP.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the latter’s homepage, the following message reads: “The WPP web site is currently\nunavailable due to important routine maintenance normal service will resume shortly.\n\n“We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. In the meantime if you would like to\ncontact WPP, please email the site Editor at the following address …”\n\n[WPP has since confirmed on Twitter that it has been the victim of an attack: “IT systems in](https://twitter.com/WPP/status/879706256612761600)\nseveral WPP companies have been affected by a suspected cyberattack. We are taking\nappropriate measures & will update asap.”\n\nThere are also reports that payments are being made in response to the attack, at the BTC\n[address linked here.](https://blockchain.info/address/1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX)\n\nFor more on Petya, check out [this insightful piece from 2016, which notes of the crypto-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/09/13/how-encryption-molded-crypto-ransomware/)\nransomware:\n\n[“Petya took an approach different from that of other crypto-ransomware. Instead of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/04/28/ransomware-is-everywhere-but-even-black-hats-make-mistakes/)\nencrypting files individually, it aimed at the file system.\n\n“The target is the victim’s [master boot record (MBR), which is responsible for loading the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)\noperating system right after system boot.”\n\n[In order to prevent this kind of threat, we recommend that you read our support article and](http://support.eset.com/alert6488/)\nkeep in mind the following steps:\n\n1.
