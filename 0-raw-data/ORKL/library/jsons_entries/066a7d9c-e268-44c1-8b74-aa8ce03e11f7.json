The group uses an advanced\n[piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) to conduct its attacks. Remsec is a](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-080214-3543-99)\nstealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a\nreference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings.\n\n[Strider’s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/flamer-highly-sophisticated-and-discreet-threat-targets-middle-east)\nLua modules, which we’ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by\n[Flamer. One of Strider’s targets had also previously been infected by Regin.](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/regin-top-tier-espionage-tool-enables-stealthy-surveillance)\n\n**Background**\nStrider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has maintained a low profile\nuntil now and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of\ninterest to a nation state’s intelligence services. Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s\nRemsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral\nengine.\n\nRemsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected computer,\ncan log keystrokes, and steal files.\n\n**Targets**\nStrider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found\nevidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group’s\ntargets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China,\nan organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium.\n\n|Symantec Security Response|Symantec Employee|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Only a small number of organizations in four countries are impacted by Strider_\n\n**Stealthy back door**\nThe Remsec malware used by Strider has a modular design. Its modules work together as a\nframework that provides the attackers with complete control over an infected computer,\nallowing them to move across a network, exfiltrate data, and deploy custom modules as\nrequired.\n\nRemsec contains a number of stealth features that help it to avoid detection. Several of its\ncomponents are in the form of executable blobs (Binary Large Objects), which are more\ndifficult for traditional antivirus software to detect. In addition to this, much of the malware’s\nfunctionality is deployed over the network, meaning it resides only in a computer’s memory and\nis never stored on disk. This also makes the malware more difficult to detect and indicates that\nthe Strider group are technically competent attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Loader: Named MSAOSSPC.DLL, this module is responsible for loading files from disk**\nand executing them. The files on disk contain the payload in an executable blob format.\nThe loader also logs data. Executable blobs and data are encrypted and decrypted with\na repeating key of 0xBAADF00D. The loader maintains persistence by being\nimplemented as a fake Security Support Provider.\n**Lua modules: Several examples of Remsec use modules written in the Lua**\nprogramming language. Remsec uses a Lua interpreter to run Lua modules which\nperform various functions. These Lua modules are stored in the same executable blob\nformat as the loader. Lua modules include:\n\n**Network loader – This loads an executable over the network for execution. It may**\nuse RSA/RC6 encryption.\n**Host loader – This is used to decrypt and load at least three other Lua modules**\ninto running processes. It references three named modules: ilpsend, updater\n(neither of which has been discovered to date), and, kblog (likely the Keylogger\nmodule detailed below).\n**Keylogger – This logs keystrokes and exfiltrates this data to a server under the**\nattackers’ control. This is the module that contains a string named “Sauron” in its\ncode. Given its capabilities, it is possible the attackers have nicknamed the\nmodule after the all-seeing villain in Lord of the Rings.\n\n_Figure 2. String referencing Sauron in Remsec keylogger module_\n\n**Network listener: A number of examples of Remsec implement different techniques for**\nopening a network connection based on monitoring for specific types of traffic. These\ninclude ICMP, PCAP, and RAW network sockets.\n**Basic pipe back door: This is a minimal back door module, controlled over named**\npipes. It can execute data in the format of the executable blob or a standard executable.\n**Advanced pipe back door: This offers several more commands than the basic version,**\nincluding sending the executable blob, listing files, and reading/writing/deleting files.\n**HTTP back door: This module includes several URLs for a command and control (C&C)**\nserver.\n\nStrider is capable of creating custom malware tools and has operated below the radar for at\nleast five years. Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its\nknown targets, it is possible that the group is a nation-state level attacker. Symantec will\ncontinue to search for more Remsec modules and targets in order to build upon our\nunderstanding of Strider and better protect our customers\n\n\n-----\n\n[Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Remsec.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-080214-3543-99)\n\n**Indicators of compromise**\n[We have also compiled an indicators-of-compromise document containing further details which](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Symantec_Remsec_IOCs.pdf)\ncan be used to help identify the threats if they are present in your environment.\n\n[Tags: Products, Endpoint Protection, Security Response, Backdoor.Remsec, Belgium,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/search?filters=im_vid_31:691)\n[China, Cyberespionage, Flamer, LOTR, Malware, Russia, Strider, Sweden](https://www.symantec.com/connect/search?filters=im_vid_111:101221)\nSubscriptions (0)\n\n\n-----",
