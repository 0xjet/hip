The malware used in this campaign is a mix of off-theshelf tools, NSIS-packed malware and bespoke spyware that abuses Yandex’s Punto software, a program for\nRussian users which silently and automatically changes the keyboard language depending on what the user is\ntyping. Once the cybercriminals have compromised a computer, they use custom tools to analyze its content,\ninstall a backdoor and finally deploy a malicious module that spies on the system and can enumerate smart\ncards\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign targets a wide range of Russian banks, uses several different code signing certificates and\nimplements evasive methods to avoid detection. As explained later, we believe this campaign is financiallymotivated and that it targets accounting departments in Russian businesses. Operation Buhtrap is a mix of two\nwords: “Buhgalter” and “trap”. “Buhgalter” means “accountant” in Russian.\n\nThis campaign is of particular interest as the techniques used by these cybercriminals are often associated with\ntargeted attacks and not generally used by financially-motivated cybercriminals. Although we believe it to be a\n[different campaign, it shares some similarities with Anunak/Carbanak in terms of techniques, tactics and](https://www.fox-it.com/en/files/2014/12/Anunak_APT-against-financial-institutions2.pdf)\nprocedures it uses. In this blog post, we will cover this campaign, its targets, and the tools used by these\ncriminals.\n\n## Targets\n\nThe cybercriminals behind this campaign are installing their software only on computers that have Russia as\ntheir default Windows locale. The infection vector we have seen consists of Microsoft Word documents sent as\n[email attachments that exploit CVE-2012-0158, a](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-0158) [vulnerability in Microsoft Word that was patched three years](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms12-027.aspx)\nago. The images below show two of the decoy documents used in this campaign. The first document, titled\n“Счет № 522375-ФЛОРЛ-14-115.doc” mimics an invoice. The second, aptly titled “kontrakt87.doc”, copies a\ngeneric telecommunications service contract from MegaFon, a large Russian mobile phone operator.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe content of the decoy documents we’ve examined, the tactics and tools used, the references to business\napplications contained in some modules, as well as some of the malicious domain names that were used in this\ncampaign, all lead us to believe that Russian businesses are their primary target.\n\nIf we take it into consideration that some of the Command and Control (C&C) domain names are very similar to\nsome accounting forums or specialized websites, and that the malware contains references to software tools\nand banking applications commonly used in accounting departments, we can infer that workers belonging to this\ndepartment are the most likely primary targets.\n\nThe tools deployed on the victim’s computer allow them to control it remotely and to record the user’s actions.\nThe malware allows the criminals to install a backdoor, attempt to obtain the account password, and even create\na new account. They also install a keylogger, a clipboard stealer, a smart card module, and have the capability to\ndownload and execute additional malware.\n\nOur telemetry for the malware families linked to this campaign is shown below. Most detections we have for\nthese threats are located in Russia. Our telemetry also shows that the tools used by this campaign are not\nwidespread. This reinforces our assumption that these attackers are likely focusing primarily on businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Installation Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the user opens the malicious attachments on a vulnerable system, an NSIS-packed trojan downloader will be\ndropped and executed. It will make several checks on the machine, first looking for malware researcher tools or\nevidence that the malware is run in a virtual machine, exiting if it finds any. It will also check whether the\nWindows locale is Russian (1049) and uses “FindFirst/NextUrlCacheEntry” and registry key\n“Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\TypedURLs” to know whether URLs matching the following patterns were\nvisited on the computer:\n\n*ICPortalSSL *ibank *i-elba\n\n*sib.taatta.net *ibrs *clbank.minbank.ru\n\n*isfront.priovtb.com *iclient *chelindbank.ru/online/\n\n*ISAPIgate.dll *e-plat.mdmbank.com *uwagb\n\n*bsi.dll *sberweb.zubsb.ru *wwwbank\n\n*PortalSSL *ibc *dbo\n\n*IIS-Gate.dll *elbrus *ib\n\n\n-----\n\n*beta.mcb.ru\n\nIt will also check to see if any of the applications below is running on the machine:\n\nip-client.exe pkimonitor.exe BC_Loader.exe CbShell.exe Bankline.EXE\n\nprclient.exe pmodule.exe Client2008.exe clb.exe GeminiClientStation.exe\n\nrclient.exe pn.exe IbcRemote31.exe CliBank.exe _ClientBank.exe\n\nsaclient.exe postmove.exe _ftcgpk.exe CliBankOnlineEn.exe ISClient.exe\n\nSRCLBClient.exe productprototype.exe scardsvr.exe CliBankOnlineRu.exe cws.exe\n\ntwawebclient.exe quickpay.exe CL_1070002.exe CliBankOnlineUa.exe CLBANK.EXE\n\nvegaClient.exe rclaunch.exe intpro.exe client2.exe IMBLink32.exe\n\ndsstart.exe retail.exe UpMaster.exe client6.exe cbsmain.dll\n\ndtpaydesk.exe retail32.exe SGBClient.exe clientbk.exe GpbClientSftcws.exe\n\neelclnt.exe translink.exe el_cli.exe clntstr.exe Run.exe\n\nelbank.exe unistream.exe MWClient32.exe clntw32.exe SGBClient.exe\n\netprops.exe uralprom.exe Adirect.exe contactng.exe sx_Doc_ni.exe\n\neTSrv.exe w32mkde.exe Bclient.exe Core.exe icb_c.exe\n\nibconsole.exe wclnt.exe bc.exe cshell.exe Client32.exe\n\nkb_cli.exe wfinist.exe ant.exe cyberterm.exe BankCl.exe\n\nKLBS.exe winpost.exe arm.exe client.exe ICLTransportSystem.exe\n\nKlientBnk.exe wupostagent.exe arm_mt.exe cncclient.exe GPBClient.exe\n\nlfcpaymentais.exe Zvit1DF.exe ARMSH95.EXE bbclient.exe CLMAIN.exe\n\nloadmain.exe budget.exe asbank_lite.exe EximClient.exe ONCBCLI.exe\n\nlpbos.exe CB.exe bank.exe fcclient.exe CLBank3.exe\n\nmebiusbankxp.exe cb193w.exe bank32.exe iscc.exe rmclient.exe\n\nmmbank.exe cbank.exe bbms.exe kabinet.exe FcolseOW.exe\n\npcbank.exe cbmain.ex bk.exe SrCLBStart.exe RkcLoader.exe\n\npinpayr.exe CBSMAIN.exe BK_KW32.EXE srcbclient.exe uarm.exe\n\nPionner.exe bnk.exe Upp_4.exe nlnotes.exe\n\nThe list of processes is quite exhaustive and does not contain only banking applications. It includes, for example,\n“scardsvr.exe” which is Microsoft’s SmartCard reader. This makes sense knowing that this malware has\nsmartcard reader capabilities. On the other hand, some processes are hard to identify and might be there for\nopportunistic reasons.\n\nIf all the requirements are met, the final stage is to download an additional file that contains all the modules used\nby the cybercriminal to spy on the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the downloaded archive may differ depending on the results of the checks above. In one of the\nearlier version of the NSIS-packed downloader we analyzed, there exist two different archives that can be\ndownloaded from the C&C: one malicious and one benign.\n\nOne of the benign archives we downloaded ultimately installed the Windows Live Toolbar. Although the means to\ninstall the software was malicious, the final payload wasn’t. These tactics were probably put in place to fool\nautomatic processing systems: since a payload was downloaded, the system could be fooled into thinking that\nthis is the end of the story.\n\nThe archive downloaded by the NSIS-packed dropper is a 7z self-extracting executable and contains different\nmodules, all distributed as 7z password-protected archives. This downloaded archive contains the different\nmodules used by this campaign. The picture below better describes the overall installation process and shows\nthe different modules.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the different modules have very different purposes, they are all similarly packaged and a lot of them are\nsigned with a valid code-signing certificate. We found four different certificates used since the campaign started,\nall registered to companies in Moscow. We of course notified the certificate issuer to have them revoked.\n\nThe table below lists the different certificates that were found linked to this campaign. We believe they were all\nfraudulently obtained.\n\n**Company name** **Validity** **Serial and Thumbprint**\n\nStroi-Tekh-Sever 09/25/2014 to 09/26/2015 Serial: 07 ac 7c a0 d1 69 d7 d3 86 ee 08 01 19 95 99 f2\nThumbprint: cf5a43d14c6ad0c7fdbcbe632ab7c789e39443ee\n\nFlash 12/18/2014 to 12/19/2015 Serial: 57 a8 f7 1c 7e 2b 97 8c 71 60 ba 07 5e ca b4 6c\nThumbprint: e9af1f9af597a9330c52a7686bf70b0094ad7616\n\nOOO \"Techcom\" 12/22/2014 to 12/23/2015 Serial: 00 e9 fb cb 1b c3 8b 66 8d 9e ba a4 73 11 76 01 41\nThumbprint: 3e1a6e52a1756017dd8f03ff85ec353273b20c66\n\nTorg-Group 10/30/2014 to 10/31/2015 Serial: 13 01 47 51 84 46 19 e6 b5 7f de ca 34 e6 04 aa\nThumbprint: efad94fc87b2b3a652f1a98901204ea8fbeef474\n\nAll the modules that make up this threat share a common install procedure. They are all 7z self-extracting\nexecutables that first decompress a password-protected archive and then execute an install.cmd file. The\nfollowing is the first install.cmd file that gets invoked after the first module has been downloaded and executed:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe install.cmd file will then install the malware or run the various tools, but will first learn more about the\nmachine it is about to compromise, especially about the account privileges it currently has and which version of\nWindows is installed.\nIf administrator privileges are required and malware is run on a limited account, it uses two different techniques\nto attempt privilege escalation.\n\nThe first approach uses two files, l1.exe and cc1.exe, which implement a variant of the trick used in the leaked\nCarberp source code. It copies cryptbase.dll to %USERPROFILE%, patches it so that it launches the malware\non execution and packs it as a MSU file. Finally, it uses wusa.exe to copy it to the system directory before\nlaunching it. The other technique exploits CVE-2013-3660. Each module that requires privilege escalation has a\n32- and 64-bit version of this exploit. If gaining administrator privileges is required, the install.cmd file will try to\nuse either of these techniques to escalate privileges locally in order to install the different modules.\n\nWhile tracking this campaign, we downloaded different overall packages. Interestingly, the modules they\ncontained were not the same. This leads us to believe that different targets might receive different modules.\n\n## System Preparation – mimi.exe and xtm.exe\n\nThis module will try to:\n\nRecover account passwords\nEnable remote desktop service\nCreate a new account on the compromised computer\n\n**[mimi.exe includes a modified version of Mimikatz, a well-known open source tool allowing password recovery](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)**\nfor users logged in a Windows system. Both the 32- and 64-bit versions of the tools are included in the\nexecutable resources. While the account password recovery functionality is still there, the executable was\nmodified to remove the user interaction part of the tool. The executable is also modified so that when run, it will\ninvoke in succession the “privilege::debug” and “sekurlsa:logonPasswords” commands, effectively compromising\nthe current local account password.\n\n\n-----\n\n**xtm.exe has different behavior to reach its goals depending on which Windows version it is run. In WinXP, it has**\nscripts that will enable remote desktop services and try to create a new account. These steps are required to\ngive the malware authors full control over the compromised system. xtm.exe will also change system settings, to\nallow multiple users to be logged on to the computer at the same time. The screenshot below shows an example\nof the type of commands run on a WinXP machine.\n\n## Backdoor – lmpack.exe\n\n[This module’s sole purpose is to install a backdoor onto the system. It will try to install LiteManager, a third-party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiteManager)\ntool that allows remote control of a system.\n\nOnce this software is installed, it allows the cybercriminals to connect directly to the victim’s computer and\ncontrol it remotely. This software even has a command line option to install the application silently, to create\nfirewall rules, and finally to start LiteManager silently. Of course all these options are abused by the\ncybercriminals.\n\n## Spying module – pn_pack.exe\n\nThis module is responsible for spying on the user and communicating with the C&C. It will first install Punto,\nsoftware made by Yandex that can automatically change keyboard language as the user types. The\ncybercriminals are then misusing this software to run the spying module through DLL side loading and are using\nit to\n\n\n-----\n\nLog all keystrokes and copy clipboard content\nEnumerate smart cards present on the system\nHandle C&C communications\n\nThe module that is ultimately responsible for these tasks is an encrypted DLL that is decrypted and loaded into\nmemory at runtime by the Punto process. It launches three threads that will ultimately perform the work outlined\nabove. The fact that Punto is misused by this malware for keylogging purposes is not surprising: several Russian\nforums detail explicitly how to misuse this application for this purpose.\n\nThis module uses RC4 to encrypt its strings as well as its network communication. It will reach out to the C&C\nevery two minutes, transmitting any data that have been stolen from the compromised system. A screenshot of a\nnetwork communication as well as the different commands that can be received from the server are shown\nbelow.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nMZ The data sent is an executable. The banker module will execute it through the CreateProcess\nAPI\n\nLD The data sent is code. The banker module will copy it into executable memory and will execute it\nby launching a new thread.\n\nAs the server commands are sent as a response to a status update from the user, it is not unimaginable that\nspecial code will be sent for specific events, such as when a smart card is detected on the system.\n\nInterestingly, in all the banker modules we analyzed (the latest one having a compilation time of January 18 ),th\nthere is a string “TEST_BOTNET” that is sent in every communication with the C&C. At this point, it is unclear\nwhat this means as people and organizations have already been compromised by this malware. As we believe\nthis operation has been ongoing for more than a year, this is intriguing. Perhaps the future holds the answer.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe can imagine the fraudsters operating in this way: they first compromise a single computer in a business by\nsending a spam and luring the person into opening the attachment.\n\nOnce the malware is installed on the victim’s computer, the cybercriminals have access to several tools that will\nhelp them to first compromise other computers in the company and second, spy on the user and see whether\nsome fraudulent banking transactions can be performed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the tools and software used in this campaign are far from being novel, the overall campaign is quite\ninteresting and intriguing: it diverges quite a bit from the traditional banking malware with which we are familiar.\n\nThis campaign is using specific tools to reach its goal, akin to what we are accustomed to see in targeted\n[attacks. Seeing a campaign like this, inevitably the Anunak/Carbanak documented by Fox-IT and Kaspersky](https://www.fox-it.com/en/files/2014/12/Anunak_APT-against-financial-institutions2.pdf)\ncomes to mind. Although we believe that this campaign is different, some similarities were observed. The\ninfection vector is similar, it uses a similar modified mimikatz application, and it uses a third-party remote access\ntool, changes system settings to allow concurrent RDP sessions, and so on.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether this kind of operation will become the norm and if the popularity of traditional\nbanking trojan families will diminish in return.\n\n_Special thanks to Anton Cherepanov and Joan Calvet for their help in this analysis_\n\n## Hashes\n\n**SHA1** **Note** **ESET Detection Name**\n\n64b79c92388244a8145bb786ba5f6b7d168fe620 RTF [Win32/Exploit.CVE-2012-0158.II](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Exploit.CVE-2012-0158.II/description)\n\n\n9d081716e83c3075b2c80bb8806a257eed35929c NSIS-packed\ndownloader\n\n\n[NSIS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.NQP](http://virusradar.com/en/NSIS_TrojanDownloader.Agent.NQP/description)\n\n\ncac0b41ef7eedcd3a8a5f83f7424c426ca05925c RTF [Win32/Exploit.CVE-2012-0158.JW](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Exploit.CVE-2012-0158.JW/description)\n\n\nb29e9611f081197f273c475c5d185d774b2ca3d2 NSIS-packed\ndownloader\n\n81b15a774c2fe146aeebaf9c10a5b907e38cdd26 7z self-extracting\nexe\n\n3a643be0cea73084c6e4e6fe5dd3626e7f54e9ce 7z self-extracting\nexe\n\nba8168c0b69d345098ebc1c3b7c90ca28097e4ff Decrypted banker\nDLL\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicator** **Value**\n\nC&C Domains store.kontur-expres.com\nbalans2w.balans2.com\nforum.buhonline.info\nrss.mercurynews.biz\ntopic.buhgalter-info.com\nhelp.b-kontur.org\n\nC&C Hardcoded IP 91.218.231.79\n\n\n[Win32/RA-based.AB](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_RA-based.AB/description)\n\n[Win32/RA-based.AB](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_RA-based.AB/description)\n\n[Win32/RA-based.NBM](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_RA-based.NBM/description)\n\n[Win32/Spy.Agent.ONE](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Spy.Agent.ONE/description)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Value**\n\n7z self-extracting executable URLs hXXp://playback.savefrom.biz/video/video1.cab\nhXXp://playback.savefrom.biz/video/video_1.cab\nhXXp://download.sendspace.biz/file/install.cab\nhXXp://download.sendspace.biz/file/l.cab\nhXXp://library.source-forge.info/cab/cabinstal.cab\nhXXp://library.source-forge.info/cab/cabinstal3.cab\nhXXp://new.pikabu-story.com/file/file1.cab\nhXXp://getdownloadsfile.com/file/new1.cab\nhXXp://new.pikabu-story.com/file/mega.cab\n\nDecoy document name Счет № 522375-ФЛОРЛ-14-115.doc\nkontrakt87.doc\n\n9 Apr 2015 - 12:44PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
