Unlike largely indiscriminate\nattacks that focus on stealing credit card and banking information associated with\ncybercrime, targeted attacks noticeably differ and are better characterized as “cyber\nespionage.” Highly targeted attacks are computer intrusions threat actors stage in rder to\naggressively pursue and compromise specific targets, often leveraging social engineering, in\norder to maintain persistent presence within the victim’s network so they can move laterally\nand extract sensitive information.\n\nIn a typical targeted attack, a target receives a contextually relevant email that encourages a\npotential victim to click a link or open a file. The links and files the attackers send contain\nmalicious code that exploits vulnerabilities in popular software. The exploits’ payload is a\nmalware that is silently executed on the target’s computer. This exploitation allows the\nattackers to take control of and obtain data from the compromised computer. In other cases,\nthe attackers send disguised executable files, usually compressed in archives that, if\nopened, also compromise the target’s computer. The malware connects back to commandand-control (C&C) servers under the attackers’ control from which they can command the\ncompromised computer to download additional malware and tools that allow them to move\nlaterally throughout the target’s network. These attacks are, however, not isolated “smashand-grab” incidents but are part of consistent campaigns that aim to establish covert\npresence in a target’s network so that information can be extracted as needed.\n\nTargeted attacks are rarely isolated events. In fact, they are constant. It is more useful to\nthink of them as campaigns—a series of failed and successful attempts to compromise a\ntarget’s network over a certain period of time. The attackers, in fact, often keep track of the\ndifferent attacks within a campaign in order to determine which individual attack\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised a specific victim s network. As the attackers learn more about their targets from\nopen source research—relying on publicly available information, as well as previous attacks,\nthe specificity of the attacks may sharply increase.\n\nCyber-espionage campaigns often focus on specific industries or communities of interest in\naddition to a geographic focus. Different positions of visibility often yield additional sets of\ntargets pursued by the same threat actors. We have been tracking the campaign dubbed\n“Luckycat” and found that in addition to targeting Indian military research institutions, as\npreviously revealed by Symantec, the same campaign targeted entities in Japan as well as\nthe Tibetan community.\n\nThe Luckycat campaign attacked a diverse set of targets using a variety of malware, some of\nwhich have been linked to other cyber-espionage campaigns. The attackers behind this\ncampaign maintain a diverse set of C&C infrastructure and leverages anonymity tools to\nobfuscate their operations. We were able to track elements of this campaign to hackers\nbased in China.\n\n## Luckycat Quick Profile:\n\n**First Seen:**\n\nThe Luckycat campaign has been active since at least June 2011.\n\n**Victims and Targets:**\n\nThe Luckycat campaign has been linked to 90 attacks against the following industries and/or\ncommunities in Japan and India:\n\nAerospace\nEnergy\nEngineering\nShipping\nMilitary research\nTibetan activists\n\n**Operations:**\n\nTargeted emails that are contextually relevant (i.e., emails containing a decoy\ndocument of radiation dose measurement results sent some time after the Great East\nJapan Earthquake\nExploited CVE-2010-3333 (aka, Rich Text Format [RTF] Stack Buffer Overflow\nVulnerability) in several instances, although Adobe Reader and Flash Player\nvulnerabilities were also exploited\nUsed TROJ_WIMMIE or VBS_WIMMIE—malware that take advantage of the Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI), making the backdoor component undetectable\nthrough file scanning\n\n\n-----\n\nThe WIMMIE malware, once inside the network, connects to a command-and-control\n(C&C) server via HTTP over port 80\nAttackers heavily used free web-hosting services but also used virtual private servers\n(VPSs) for more stable operations\n\n**Possible Indicators of Compromise**\nWIMMIE malware do not leave much network fingerprint. However, the following is an\nidentifiable HTTP C&C communication fingerprint—count.php?m=c&n=\n\n[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@. This format can also be seen in\nthe URL inside the script when /namespace:\\\\root\\subscription path __eventconsumer is\ntyped in the command line for WMI.\n\n**Relationship with Other APT Campaigns**\nMalware identified with the ShadowNet, Duojeen, Sparksrv, and Comfoo campaigns were\nused or found hosted on the same dedicated server used by the LuckyCat campaign.\n\n_* The campaign codes we have seen so far are detailed in the Trend Micro research paper,_\n_“Luckycat Redux: Inside an APT Campaign with Multiple Targets in India and Japan.” The_\n_characteristics highlighted in this APT campaign profile reflect the results of our investigation_\n_as of March 2012_\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
