F o l t z\n\n\nadvance the specific criteria states will use in\nmaking such determinations.\nAs discussed in this article, several analytic frameworks have been developed to help\nassess when cyber operations constitute a use\nof force.[3] One conclusion these frameworks\nshare is that cyber operations resulting in\nphysical damage or injury will almost always\nbe regarded as a use of force. When these\nframeworks were developed, however, there\nwere few, if any, examples of peacetime, statesponsored cyber coercion. More importantly,\nthe prospect of cyber attacks causing physical\ndamage was largely theoretical.[4] Beginning\n\n\n### All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integ- rity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\n  —Article 2(4), Charter of the United Nations[1]\n\n\nne of the many seemingly\nintractable legal issues surrounding cyberspace involves\nwhether and when peacetime\n\n# Ocyber operations constitute a prohibited use of\n\nforce under Article 2(4) of the United Nations\n(UN) Charter. Notwithstanding a significant\nbody of scholarly work on this topic and\nextensive real-world examples from which to\ndraw, there is no internationally recognized\ndefinition of a use of force.[2] Rather, what has\nemerged is a general consensus that some\ncyber operations will constitute a use of force,\nbut that it may not be possible to identify in\n\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Andrew C. Foltz, USAF, wrote this essay while a student at the Air War College. It won**\n**the Strategic Research Paper category of the 2012 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Strategic Essay**\n**Competition.**\n\n\n-----\n\nin 2007, however, a string of cyber operations—including the 2007 Distributed Denial\nof Service (DDoS) attack on Estonia, the 2008\nDDoS attack on Georgia, and the 2008 discovery that the U.S. Government’s most sensitive\nnetworks had been compromised—hinted at\nincreased use of the cyber domain by states\nand their proxies for peacetime coercion.\nThen, with the discovery of the Stuxnet worm\n\n\ndifficulty applying it in the cyber context. I\nthen review Schmitt’s model and perform\na Schmitt Analysis of Stuxnet. Finally, I\nexamine what the analysis of Stuxnet reveals\nabout the framework’s continued utility\nand relevance. Overall, I find that Schmitt’s\nunderlying analytical approach remains\nsound—that is, the best way to characterize\nthe lawfulness of peacetime cyber operations\n\n\n#### the need for clarity has taken on greater importance now  that the United States and many of its allies  treat cyberspace as a military operational domain\n\n\ngoverns state behavior.[12] If state-sponsored\ncyber activities constitute a use of force,\nthen international law governing the use of\nforce (jus ad bellum) and the Law of Armed\nConflict (jus in bello) apply. In appropriate\ncircumstances, this could trigger a state’s right\nto self-defense and thereby permit a forceful,\nperhaps even armed response. In contrast,\nnon-state-sponsored cyber operations and\noperations not amounting to a use of force are\ntraditionally governed by more constrained\nlaw enforcement regimes.[13]\n\nThe need for clarity has taken on greater\nimportance now that the United States and\nmany of its allies treat cyberspace as a military\noperational domain.[14] Accordingly, discerning\na use-of-force threshold would seem to be necessary for a wide range of peacetime military\nactivities, such as defining the spectrum of\npermissible peacetime cyber operations, such\nas computer network exploitation; developing peacetime cyber rules of engagement;\nidentifying appropriate approval authorities;\nassigning appropriate agency responsibilities\nand resources; signaling adversaries and allies\nas part of a deterrence strategy; recognizing\nwhen treaty obligations have been triggered;\nand determining whether UN Security\nCouncil authorization is required to conduct\ncertain operations.\n\n##### The Use of Force in Cyberspace\nNotwithstanding the need for clarity\ndiscussed above, there is no international\nconsensus on what constitutes a use of force in\ncyberspace, nor does it appear a mechanical\nrule is likely to emerge any time soon.[15] This\nsection describes why ambiguity persists and\nthe various solutions that have been proposed\nto resolve it. After summarizing the relevant\nlaw governing the use of force in international\nrelations, I highlight the technical, legal, and\npolitical challenges of applying existing norms\nwithin cyberspace.\n**_Use of Force Under the UN Charter._**\nJus ad bellum[16] describes the law governing\nthe transition from peace to armed conflict.\nThough grounded in customary international\nlaw, the black letter principles of jus ad bellum\nare now contained in Article 2(4) of the UN\nCharter, which prohibits states from the\n“threat or use of force” in their international\nrelations. Several features of this prohibition\nare problematic in the cyber context. First,\nArticle 2(4) only pertains to international\nrelations between sovereign states—it does\nnot proscribe the conduct of nonstate actors,\n\n\nin 2010, which damaged uranium enrichment\nequipment at a nuclear facility in Iran, theory\nbecame reality.\nAlthough Stuxnet has been described\nas a watershed event, there has been little academic discussion on whether it constituted a\nuse of force.[5] Perhaps this is because it caused\nphysical damage and, therefore, clearly constitutes a use of force under prevailing analytic\nframeworks. This appears to be the emerging\nconsensus.[6] Although I generally agree with\nthis conclusion, I also believe that by looking\nbeyond the physical damage, Stuxnet provides\na unique opportunity to assess the adequacy\nand continued relevancy of these frameworks.\nAs a first step toward such an assessment, this article tests one of the more\nrobust frameworks, known as the Schmitt\nAnalysis, by applying it to Stuxnet. Developed in 1999 by Professor Michael Schmitt,\nit is one of the most academically rigorous\nand frequently cited frameworks for characterizing cyber operations. The Schmitt\nAnalysis consists of seven factors that states\nare likely to consider when characterizing cyber activities: severity, immediacy,\ndirectness, invasiveness, measurability,\npresumptive legitimacy, and responsibility.\nA key feature of the framework is that it\nremains faithful to Article 2(4) of the UN\nCharter while at the same time effectively\nbridging key elements of competing analytic\nframeworks that do not exhibit such fidelity\nto the Charter. By focusing this evaluation\non Schmitt’s model, I expect the results will\nhave implications for the use-of-force debate\nmore generally.\nThe article begins with a discussion\nof why, as a practical matter, discerning a\npeacetime use-of-force threshold in cyberspace is important. Next, I detail the Article\n2(4) prohibition on the use of force and the\n\n\nis to predict how states will characterize them.\nThat said, the Stuxnet analysis reveals several\nlimitations with Schmitt’s framework, while\nalso highlighting opportunities to broaden it.\nMore importantly, I conclude that the time\nhas come to relax the model’s strict adherence\nto the UN Charter because Article 2(4) is just\none of several factors that states are likely to\nconsider when characterizing the lawfulness\nof cyber operations.\n\n##### Why the Use-of-Force Threshold Matters\nCyberspace represents a strategic\nvulnerability for many states because it is\ninextricably tied in to their economies, critical infrastructures, and even their national\nsecurity apparatus. Compounding these\nconcerns is the fact that a wide range of\nactors have proven adept at exploiting these\nvulnerabilities. Cybercrime, for example, is\nnow estimated to exceed $1 trillion globally\nper year.[7] Even the most secure U.S. defense\nnetworks are not immune.[8] The scope of the\nproblem has become so great that some claim\nthe United States is engaged in a cyber war,\nand that it is losing.[9] The National Security\n_Strategy of 2010 notes that “cybersecurity_\nthreats represent one of the most serious\nnational security, public safety, and economic\nchallenges we face as a nation.”[10] The White\nHouse’s International Strategy for Cyberspace\nof 2011 goes further by proclaiming: “When\nwarranted, the United States will respond to\nhostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any\nother threat to our country,” to include a military response.[11]\n\nAgainst this backdrop, discerning a\ncyber use-of-force threshold becomes important for a number of reasons. Foremost is that\ncharacterizing cyber operations is a precondition to determining which legal regime\n\n\n-----\n\nwho appear to be the source of most malicious cyber activity. Also, as noted above,\nthe Charter does not define the phrase use of\n_force. Finally, Article 2(4) does not provide_\nany exceptions to the prohibition on the\nunilateral use of force, nor does it prescribe\nremedies for unauthorized uses of force. Such\nexceptions and remedies are found in chapter\nVII of the Charter which, unlike Article 2(4),\nis not limited to relations between states and\nemploys thresholds quite distinct from the\nuse-of-force standard.[17] Importantly, it is not\nthe use of force, but rather an “armed attack”\nthat triggers a state’s right to use force in\nself-defense.[18]\n\nAlthough use of force is not defined,\nan approximate threshold has emerged\nthrough consideration of the Charter’s\npreparatory work, state practice, and\n_opinio juris.[19] First, the framers of the_\n\n\n_v. United States (hereinafter Nicaragua),_\nwhen it concluded that arming and training guerrillas amounted to a prohibited\nuse of force, even though it did not rise to\nthe level of an armed attack.[25] Accordingly,\nthe use of force threshold has traditionally\nbeen viewed as lying somewhere between\npurely economic and political coercion on\nthe one hand and activities that result in\nphysical damage or injury on the other.[26]\nAs discussed below, discerning a clear\nuse-of-force threshold in this gray area—a\ndifficult task even in traditional kinetic\ncontext—has proven particularly difficult\nin the cyber context.[27]\n\n**_Use of Force in Cyberspace. The dif-_**\nficulty of applying Article 2(4) in cyberspace\nis that the instrument-based paradigm does\nnot cleanly translate to cyber operations,\nparticularly for gray area operations that do\n\n\n#### discerning the use-of-force threshold is really about  predicting how states will respond to cyber incidents in  light of prevailing international norms\n\n\n“effects-based” approach, which states that\nthe quantum of damage, and not the means\nof attack, is all that matters. The advantage of\nthis approach—which is generally favored by\nU.S. policymakers and military operators—is\nthat it is fairly simple to apply and it acknowledges that states are principally concerned\nabout consequences. The drawback is that it\nrepresents a hard break from the Charter’s\ninstrument-based approach and thereby relies\non inherently subjective assessments among\nstates that have divergent strategic capabilities, vulnerabilities, and interests. A second\napproach relies upon kinetic equivalency,\narguing that cyber operations constitute a\nuse of force only if the damage they cause\ncould previously have been achieved only by\na kinetic attack.[31] This framework generally\nadheres to the Charter’s instrument-based\napproach, but it struggles to characterize\nhostile gray area cyber operations—such as\nprojecting false targets on an adversary’s early\nwarning radars—that do not result in physical\ndamage. A third approach applies a “strict\nliability” test for any cyber operations that\ntarget a state’s critical infrastructure and vital\ninterests because of the severe consequences\nthat could result from such attacks. According\nto this model, the mere penetration of such\nsystems—such as power production, stock\nexchanges, and air traffic control—can constitute evidence of hostile intent and thereby\ntrigger the right of self-defense.[32] This framework suffers from the inherent subjectivity\nof defining what constitutes “critical infrastructure and vital interests,” and because it\nexpands the gray area to encompass activities\nsuch as computer network exploitation that\nare not currently prohibited by international\nlaw. Professor Schmitt’s framework represents\nthe fourth major model.\n\n##### Schmitt Analysis\nProfessor Schmitt recognized that\ndiscerning the use-of-force threshold is really\nabout predicting how states will characterize\nand respond to cyber incidents in light of prevailing international norms.[33] To aid in such\npredictions, his framework bridges the instrument- and consequence-based approaches.\nIn keeping with the Article 2(4) instrumentbased standard, his model consists of seven\nfactors that represent the major distinctions\nbetween permissible (that is, economic and\npolitical) and impermissible (armed) instruments of coercion.[34] When applying these\nfactors, the more closely the attributes of a\n\n\nCharter took an instrument-based, vice\nconsequence-based, approach to the use of\nforce prohibition.[20] While acknowledging\nthat states are most concerned about the\nconsequences of coercive activities (that\nis, the degree of injury, deprivation, or\ndestruction), the framers recognized that a\nconsequence-based criterion was too subjective to distinguish lawful from unlawful\nstate coercion.[21] Because the term force\nconnotes violence, injury, and destruction—consequences that pose the greatest\nthreat to international peace and security—\nthey adopted the instrument-based use-offorce standard as prescriptive shorthand.\nAccording to Professor Schmitt, such an\napproach “eases the evaluative process by\nsimply asking whether force has been used,\nrather than requiring a far more difficult\nassessment of the consequences that have\nresulted.”[22] According to this approach, the\nArticle 2(4) prohibition does not extend to\nall forms of state coercion. For example,\nthe instruments of economic and political\ncoercion are not prohibited.[23] Less clear,\nbut generally accepted, is that the prohibition is not limited to “armed” force—it\nmay also encompass unarmed, nonmilitary\nphysical force, such as releasing water\nfrom a dam.[24] The International Court of\nJustice highlighted this point in Nicaragua\n\n\nnot result in physical harm.[28] According to a\nstrict instrument-based interpretation, even\nhighly disruptive peacetime cyber operations\nmay not qualify as a use of force because they\nlack the traditional kinetic characteristics\nassociated with armed force.[29] Most commentators reject this strict interpretation because\nof the potential widespread destabilizing\nconsequences of cyber operations. That said,\nby focusing on consequences to determine\nwhether prohibited force has been used, these\ncommentators call Article 2(4)’s instrumentbased paradigm into question.\nThe perceived shortcomings of Article\n2(4) have led many to propose a new treaty law\nto govern cyber operations.[30] Others counter\nthat states are unlikely to negotiate any\nmeaningful treaties in the foreseeable future.\nThey argue that divergent strategic interests\nand significant attribution problems make\ntreaty enforcement unrealistic. They suggest\nthat existing international norms, though\nimperfect, are adequate for extrapolating\ngeneral principles governing the use of force\nin cyberspace and urge gradual expansion of\ninternational norms within the Article 2(4)\nframework.\nOver the past two decades, proponents\nof this gradualist approach have developed\nseveral analytic frameworks to characterize\nthe legality of cyber operations. First is the\n\n\n-----\n\ninstrument-based paradigm appears tortuous, particularly given the appeal of simple\neffects-based frameworks. However, he\nreasoned that such adherence is necessary to\nproperly describe where the cyber use of force\nthreshold lies under prevailing standards—in\ncontrast to the other leading models, which\nprescribe new standards for where the use of\nforce threshold should lie.[38] He also believed\nthat “reference to the instrument-based shorthand facilitates greater internal consistency\nand predictability within the preexisting\nframework. . . . As a result, subscription by\nthe international community is more likely,\nand application should prove less disruptive\nand controversial.”[39] In the end, the Schmitt\nAnalysis has generally stood the test of time\nand remains one of the most commonly referenced frameworks for characterizing the use\nof force in cyberspace.\n\n##### Characterizing Stuxnet\nStuxnet has been described as a game\nchanger—the first digital “fire and forget”\nprecision-guided munition and perhaps the\nfirst peacetime act of cyberwar.[40] According\n\n\ncyber operation approximate the attributes\nof armed force, the more likely states are to\ncharacterize the operation as a prohibited use\nof force. The Schmitt Analysis factors consist\nof the following:\n\n   - Severity: Cyber operations that\nthreaten physical harm more closely approximate an armed attack. Relevant factors in the\nanalysis include scope, duration, and intensity.\n\n   - Immediacy: Consequences that manifest quickly without time to mitigate harmful\neffects or seek peaceful accommodation are\nmore likely to be viewed as a use of force.\n\n   - Directness: The more direct the causal\nconnection between the cyber operation and\nthe consequences, the more likely states will\ndeem it to be a use of force.\n\n   - Invasiveness: The more a cyber\noperation impairs the territorial integrity or\nsovereignty of a state, the more likely it will be\nviewed as a use of force.\n\n   - Measurability: States are more likely to\nview a cyber operation as a use of force if the\nconsequences are easily identifiable and objectively quantifiable.\n\n\n\n   - Presumptive legitimacy: To the extent\ncertain activities are legitimate outside of the\ncyber context, they remain so in the cyber\ndomain, for example, espionage, psychological\noperations, and propaganda.\n\n   - Responsibility: The closer the nexus\nbetween the cyber operation and a state, the\nmore likely it will be characterized as a use\nof force.[35]\n\nAccording to Professor Schmitt,\nevaluating these factors is an imprecise and\nsubjective endeavor. The factors are useful\nbut not determinative, and they should not be\napplied mechanically. Rather, they need to be\napplied holistically according to the relevant\ncontext—that is, which factors are important\nand how they should be weighted will vary\non a case-by-case basis. Moreover, he never\nintended the factors to be exhaustive, though\nthey are often treated as such.[36] Finally, the\nframework is more useful for post hoc forensic\nanalysis of particular cyber attacks than for\ncharacterizing real-time operations.[37]\n\n\nProfessor Schmitt also acknowledged\nthat his adherence to the Article 2(4)\n\n\n**Analysts attending Defense Cyber**\n**Investigations Training**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Deputy Secretary of Defense addresses Defense**\n**Information System Agency’s Customer and**\n**Industry Forum on cyber warfare**\n\n\nto reports, the Stuxnet worm was designed to\ntarget gas centrifuges used in Iran’s uranium\nenrichment program in Natanz. Specifically,\nthe worm exploited the software used in\nprogrammable logic controllers (PLCs) manufactured by Siemens. These PLCs controlled\nfrequency converter drives that, in turn, controlled the speed of the centrifuges. By manipulating the speed of already temperamental\nand frequency-sensitive centrifuges over time\n(weeks and perhaps months), Stuxnet caused\nas many as 1,000 of the centrifuges to break.\nEstimates suggest Stuxnet set Iran’s nuclear\nprogram back by several years.[41]\n\nAlthough some have described Stuxnet’s\ncode as a relatively unsophisticated “Frankenstein patchwork of existing tradecraft,\ncode and best practices drawn from the global\ncyber-crime community,” its true sophistication lies in the synergy of its components\nand its method of infection.[42] First, Stuxnet’s\ndesigners required incredibly precise intelligence about Iran’s PLCs and frequency\nconverters, as well as the performance\nparameters of its centrifuges.[43] Second, the\nmalware was self-replicating and designed to\ninfect systems that were not connected to the\nInternet (“air-gapped”), thereby requiring the\nuse of intermediary devices such as thumb\ndrives. Stuxnet also employed four “zero-day”\nexploits[44] and two stolen digital signatures\nto gain access to targeted systems. Finally,\nStuxnet appears to have been designed to\n\n\navoid collateral damage.[45] If the malware did\nnot detect the specific software-hardware configuration associated with Iran’s enrichment\nprogram, the program would lie dormant. It\nwas also designed to delete itself from thumb\ndrives after infecting three machines, and\nit contained a built-in self-destruct feature.\nThus, even though the worm is reported to\nhave infected more than 100,000 hosts in 155\ncountries, 60 percent of the infections were\nlocalized to Iran, and there are no reports of\nphysical damage outside of Iran.[46] Although\nno one has claimed responsibility for Stuxnet,\nit has the signature of a state operation.[47] Most\nspeculation and some anecdotal evidence\npoints to Israel, with possible support from\nthe United States and/or Germany.[48]\n\nAlthough there is an emerging consensus that Stuxnet constituted a use of force,\nthere is value in looking beyond the physical\ndamage to see what the operation reveals\nabout the strengths and weaknesses of existing analytic frameworks, such as the Schmitt\nAnalysis. Accordingly, the following analysis\nis offered not only to characterize Stuxnet, but\nto help evaluate Schmitt’s framework.\n_Severity: According to this criterion,_\nStuxnet is per se a use of force because it\ncaused physical damage. Moreover, the\ndamage was inflicted upon a critical Iranian\ninterest—its nuclear program. By setting\nIran’s nuclear program back several years,\nthe duration of Stuxnet’s consequences also\n\n\nsupports characterizing it as a use of force—\nthough this delay is due to sanctions that bar\nIran from legitimately acquiring new centrifuges. It is also worth noting that the scope\nof the actual damage appears to have been\nrelatively minor and fairly discrete, and that it\nposed no apparent risk of harm to personnel.\n_Immediacy: According to this factor,_\nStuxnet would probably not be viewed as a\nuse of force. The attack, which consisted of at\nleast three waves over 10 months, took time\nto evolve.[49] More importantly, once a targeted\nsystem was infected, it appears the damage\ntook weeks or even months to manifest. Given\nthe nature of how the attack unfolded, there\nwas and remains adequate opportunity for\nIran to mitigate the harmful effects and to\nseek peaceful accommodation. That said,\ngiven the physical damage inflicted, immediacy is probably not a factor that warrants\nmuch emphasis in this analysis.\n_Directness: There appears to be a direct_\ncausal connection between Stuxnet and the\ndamaged centrifuges.\n_Invasiveness: Stuxnet represents a_\nsignificant intrusion on Iranian sovereignty.\nNot only does it appear to have crossed international borders, but it targeted sensitive and\nhighly secure systems that were air-gapped\nfrom the Internet. That said, Stuxnet would\nhave been just as invasive if it had simply\ncollected intelligence on the inner workings\nof the Natanz facility—an activity the interna\n\n-----\n\na cyber operation may be derived from a\nsingle factor: severity of the consequences.\nIf true, then the framework could arguably\nbe reduced to an effects-based model with\nlittle remaining affinity with the Article 2(4)\ninstrument-based paradigm. To illustrate the\npoint, what if instead of damaging Iranian\ncentrifuges Stuxnet achieved the same effects\nby causing the centrifuges to operate inefficiently or not at all? Except for severity, each\nof Schmitt’s factors would likely be evaluated\nthe same. It is debatable, though, whether\nthe international community would consider\nsuch an operation a prohibited use of force.\nThis is not to suggest that the other factors\nare irrelevant, but it highlights what Professor\nSchmitt himself acknowledged: “severity is\nself-evidently the most significant factor in\nthe analysis.”[51]\n\nNext, the characteristics of Stuxnet\nand its intended target suggest at least one\nadditional factor that may be relevant when\nperforming a Schmitt Analysis: apparent\ncompliance with the Law of Armed Conflict\n(LOAC).[52] Assuming reports are true, the\nfact that Stuxnet was targeted so precisely\nand designed to minimize collateral damage\n\n\ntional community would likely not regard as a\nuse of force.\n_Measurability: Taking into account the_\nalready high failure rate of Iran’s centrifuges,\nthe consequences attributed to Stuxnet appear\nboth quantifiable and identifiable.\n_Presumptive legitimacy: Stuxnet does_\nnot enjoy presumptive legitimacy. Short of\nUN Security Council authorization or actions\ntaken in self-defense—both of which would\nconstitute lawful uses of force—there is no\ncustomary acceptance within the international community for damaging another\nstate’s nuclear facilities. Even so, it is worth\nconsidering the effect of existing Iranian\nsanctions upon this analysis. First, Iran\ncannot import or export nuclear-related materials or technology. If such Iranian-owned\nnuclear materials are discovered outside\nof Iran, they can be lawfully seized and\ndestroyed. Second, prior to Stuxnet, Iran had\nbeen operating its centrifuges for several years\nin violation of multiple UN Security Council\nResolutions.[50] Although these points may\nrelate more to whether Stuxnet constituted a\n_lawful use of force, they also seem to bear on_\nthe factor of presumptive legitimacy.\n\n\n_Responsibility: Although no state has_\nclaimed responsibility for Stuxnet, the worm’s\npurpose and design strongly suggest state\ninvolvement. That said, it is possible that\nStuxnet was created and launched by nonstate\nactors—such as Iranian dissidents working\nwith freelance hackers—in which case it\nwould not be subject to international laws\ngoverning the use of force.\nOn balance, the Schmitt Analysis suggests most states would characterize Stuxnet\nas a use of force. The worm was highly invasive, caused direct and measurable physical\ndamage, lacked a clear presumption of legitimacy, and probably involved state support.\nWhat does the foregoing analysis of\nStuxnet reveal about the continued usefulness of Professor Schmitt’s framework? Most\nimportantly, the model’s underlying analytic\napproach appears sound—that is, discerning\nthe use of force threshold entails predicting\nhow states will characterize cyber operations.\nThat said, the analysis reveals several limitations with the framework, as well as opportunities for its expansion.\nFirst, it appears that in any given\nSchmitt Analysis, the characterization of\n\n\n**Commander of Navy Cyber**\n**Forces observes spectral warrior**\n**demonstration during exercise**\n**Bold Alligator 2012**\n\n\n-----\n\nattacked.”[56] Although Iran has acknowledged\nthe presence of Stuxnet in its systems, it\nhas denied any significant damage and has\nnever claimed that it was subject to an armed\nattack. As U.S. Cyber Command’s top lawyer,\nColonel Gary Brown, has commented: “Iran’s\n‘non-position’ on the Stuxnet event has been\nfrustrating to practitioners in the field of\ncyberspace operations. Finally, there was a\nwell-documented, unambiguous cyber attack\nto dissect! And yet there was little official\ndiscussion of the issue because Iran passed up\nits opportunity to complain of an unjustified\nattack.”[57] Unfortunately, Professor Schmitt’s\nframework does not address the implications\nof such state inaction. It remains to be seen\nwhat, if any, impact Iran’s “non-position” has\non the development of use of force norms in\ncyberspace.\nA more significant observation relates\nto Professor Schmitt’s premise that states\nwill principally rely upon existing norms,\nparticularly Article 2(4), when making useof-force determinations in cyberspace. As\nsome commentators predicted—and Stuxnet\ndemonstrated—Article 2(4) has proven to be a\n“weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks.”[58]\nThis is due, in part, to the difficulty of observing, measuring, and attributing cyber operations. More importantly, it reflects the fact\nthat international law is not static and that the\nprinciples of jus ad bellum are not the exclusive province of the UN Charter.[59] Whereas\ncontemporary interpretations of Article 2(4)\nreflect the distribution of traditional instruments of power—that is, political, military,\nand economic strength—the current array of\ncyber capabilities and vulnerabilities does not\nmirror the traditional distribution.[60] Consequently, states with significant cyber capabilities or vulnerabilities—regardless of their\npolitical, military, or economic strength—are\nlikely to consider factors well beyond Article\n2(4) when characterizing the legality of cyber\noperations. Such additional considerations\nmay include relative cyber strengths and\nvulnerabilities; strategic risks and opportunities; scope of potential consequences; ability\nto control escalation; effectiveness of cyber\ndeterrence; potential reactions by adversaries, allies, and international organizations;\ndomestic politics; state declaratory policies;\nemerging state practice (including state inaction); attribution problems; and other legal,\npolitical, and technical constraints.[61] Moreover, given the novelty of cyberspace, different\n\n\nreveals something about the identity and\nintent of its creators. First, it reinforces the\nnotion that Stuxnet was a state-sponsored\noperation, which is important because Article\n2(4) only regulates state conduct. Second, it\nsuggests Stuxnet’s creators were concerned\nabout complying with LOAC, particularly the\nprinciples of military necessity, distinction,\nand proportionality.[53] Thus, the responsible\nstate apparently regarded Stuxnet as the\nequivalent of an armed attack and executed\nthe operation as such. Since an armed attack\nconstitutes a use of force, the implication is\nthat states are more likely to characterize\ncyber attacks as a use of force if they appear to\ncomply with LOAC—even in gray area operations that do not result in actual damage.\nA third observation involves one of\nthe most technically challenging aspects of\ncyber operations: attribution. For Article 2(4)\nand the principles of jus ad bellum to apply,\n\n\nthe responsible party must be identified as a\nstate.[54] As noted above, without reliable attribution states generally must respond to cyber\noperations as a law enforcement problem. Yet\neach of the prevailing frameworks, including the Schmitt Analysis, treats attribution\nas a condition precedent to any use-of-force\nanalysis.[55] In other words, without attribution,\na Schmitt Analysis offers limited practical\nvalue. But if state attribution can be established, it is questionable whether a Schmitt\nAnalysis would be necessary because more\nrevealing indicators should be discernable,\nsuch as motive and intent.\nNext, to the extent state attribution\nbears on the characterization of cyber\noperations, so too should the victim state’s\nresponse. As the International Court of Justice\nnoted in Nicaragua: “it is the State which is\nthe victim of an armed attack which must\nform and declare the view that it has been so\n\n\n**Commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber**\n**Command and U.S. 10[th] Fleet addresses**\n**Information Dominance Corps**\n\n\n-----\n\nstates will likely weigh their strategic risks and\nopportunities very differently.\nPerhaps these additional considerations\nexplain why there has been so little academic\ndebate about the legal implications of Stuxnet.\nEven though most states would probably\nagree that Stuxnet constituted a use of force\nunder Article 2(4), they may be reluctant to\ncharacterize the attack as unlawful since, by\ntargeting an illicit program in a pariah state,\nit was justifiable. In this regard, it is worth\nnoting that Stuxnet’s objective was consistent\nwith multiple UN Security Council mandates\n\n\ndominate the analysis.[63] In light of recent\nevents in Estonia, Georgia, and Iran, it\nappears that time has come.\nThe Schmitt Analysis of Stuxnet also\nhas implications for the broader debate over\nthe use of force in cyberspace. For one thing,\nthe lack of discussion over the legal implications of Stuxnet demonstrates that states are\nunlikely to reach consensus on what constitutes a cyber use of force any time soon. The\nlack of a discernable threshold also suggests\nthat state-sponsored gray area cyber attacks\nare more likely.[64] Consequently, policymak\n\n#### policymakers and cyber practitioners must be prepared to operate in an ambiguous and contested legal environment\n\n\nand it promoted those mandates without\nresorting to armed force. Thus, it remains\nto be seen whether Stuxnet represents a new\nform of tacitly condoned cyber vigilante-ism,\nor whether the perpetrator(s) will eventually\nbe held in contempt. Either way, Iran’s “nonposition” has made it easy for the international community to sidestep the issue.\n\n##### Conclusion\nAlthough Professor Schmitt’s analytic\napproach to characterizing cyber operations\nremains sound, the analysis of Stuxnet reveals\nseveral shortcomings with his model. These\ninclude severity of the consequences as a\npotentially determinative factor, attribution\nas a condition precedent to a use of force\nanalysis, and failure to account for a victim\nstate’s “non-position” toward a particular\ncyber operation. This analysis also reveals\nat least one additional factor states may\nconsider when characterizing cyber operations—whether an attack appears to comply\nwith LOAC.\nMore importantly, this analysis suggests\nthe time has come to relax the model’s strict\nadherence to the Article 2(4) instrumentbased paradigm. By tying his framework to\nArticle 2(4), Professor Schmitt anticipated\nmore consistent, predictable, and relatively\nobjective characterizations of force in cyberspace. However, state practice over the last\ndecade suggests that states will treat Article\n2(4) as just one of several factors to consider\nwhen characterizing cyber operations.[62] As\nProfessor Schmitt himself acknowledged, as\nstate practice emerges, other considerations\nand normative approaches—such as greater\nemphasis on consequences—may come to\n\n\ners and cyber practitioners and their legal\nadvisors must be prepared to operate in an\nambiguous and contested legal environment,\nwhile at the same time shaping new norms\nof acceptable state conduct.[65] In the end,\nthese evolving norms are not likely to be constrained by Article 2(4)’s narrow prohibition\non the use of force. Rather, they will likely\nreflect the new realities and unique features\nof cyberspace, such as cyber’s potentially\ndevastating consequences, the nontraditional\ndistribution of cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities, and the international community’s\nresponse (or lack thereof) to seminal events\nlike Stuxnet. **JFQ**\n\n\n**N o t e s**\n\n\n1 United Nations (UN), Charter of the United\n_Nations and Statute of the International Court of_\n_Justice (San Francisco, CA: UN, 1945)._\n\n2 Michael N.

The\nmost important obstacle may be the difficulty of\nattributing CNA to State action. Moreover, even\nif State use of CNA were to emerge as a recognizable phenomenon, such CNA would have to occur\nin relative isolation in order squarely to pose the\nrelevant legal issue. Because this seems improbable,\nit likely will be a long time, if ever, before the practice of States, decisions of the International Court\nof justice (ICJ), or other recognized sources of\ninternational law yield a clarification of how Article\n2(4) applies to CNA.” Daniel B.

Opinio juris means a sense of\nlegal obligation. In the international law context, it\nis used to judge whether State practice and adherence to norms is due to a sense of legal obligation,\nvice political expediency, or convenience. Duhaime.\n_org Legal Dictionary, available at <www.duhaime._\norg/ LegalDictionary/O/OpinioJuris.aspx>. When\nopinio juris exists and is consistent with nearly all\nstate practice, customary international law emerges.\nFor example, Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the\nInternational Court of Justice accepts “international custom” as a source of law, but only where\nthis custom is: (1) “evidence of a general practice,”\nand (2) “accepted as law.”\n\n20 See, for example, Schmitt, “Computer\nNetwork Attack and the Use of Force,” 909; and\nDuncan B.

A compelling argument does exist,\nhowever, that political and economic coercion that\nthreatens the territorial integrity or political independence of another state constitutes an unlawful\nuse of force under Article 2(4).

According to the ICJ,\nthe distinction between the threat or use of force\n(including armed force) and an armed attack is\nbased on the operation’s “scale and effects.” Nicara_gua, para. 195._\n\n26 Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International\nLaw,” 155.\n\n27 See Matthew C.

Professor Schmitt highlighted\nthis dilemma: “The advent of cyber operations\nthrew the instrument-based approach into disarray by creating the possibility of dramatically\ndestabilizing effects caused by other than kinetic\nactions.” Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law,” 177.\n\n30 See Clarke and Knake, 219–255; Hollis, “Why\nStates Need an International Law for Information\nOperations,” 1053; and Silver, 78.\n\n31 See Hollis, “Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations,” 1041; and\nGraham, 91.\n\n32 Sharp, 129–131; and Hollis, “Why States\nNeed an International Law for Information Operations,” 1041.\n\n33 Schmitt, interview by the author. In this\nregard, Professor Schmitt noted that states would\nlikely seek to balance the conflicting objectives of\nmaximizing their own freedom of action in cyberspace while avoiding the harmful consequences\ncaused by adversaries. See also Schmitt, “Cyber\nOperations in International Law,” 155.\n\n34 Schmitt, “Computer Network Attack and the\nUse of Force,” 914.\n\n35 Professor Schmitt’s responsibility factor is\nbest understood as a measure of the degree of state\nattribution, although he did not describe it as such.\nState attribution is an important part of his model\nbecause Article 2(4) and customary international\nlaws only govern the use of force between states.\n\n36 Schmitt, interview with author.
