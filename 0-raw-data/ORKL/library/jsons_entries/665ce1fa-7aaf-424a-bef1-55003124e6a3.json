This partial view\nmakes it difficult to condense and analyze significant and rich data in a\nsingle place and creates blind spots for defenders.\n\nVirusTotal is in a unique position to provide a source of comprehensive\nvisibility. Over the last 16 years, we have processed more than 2 million\nfiles per day across 232 countries. VirusTotal also harnesses the continuous\ncontribution of its community of users to provide relevant attack context.\nWe use this crowdsourced intelligence to analyze relevant data, share an\nunderstanding of how attacks develop, and help inform how they might\nevolve in the future.\n\nThis report continues in the direction of what we hope will become\nan ongoing community effort to discover and share actionable information\non malware trends.\n\n**Methodology: VirusTotal relies on crowdsourced contributions,**\nproviding a valuable picture of how different attacks spread and evolve.\nAll the data in this report is based on a representative subset of submissions\nfrom our users. To be clear, the relevance of the raw number of samples\nobserved and detected as malicious varies throughout the course of the\nyear. Small changes in malicious samples driven by variances in contributors,\npolymorphism, and external crawlers can result in significantly more\nunique detections.\n\n\n###### From 232 countries\n\n\n###### Over the last\n##### 16 years\n\n\n-----\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nAttackers’ use of malware with built-in exploits increased by 27% in 2021.\n\nThe average time it took for the most popular vulnerabilities to be exploited\ndropped from 93 days in 2020 to 0 days in 2021 because many were being\nexploited before their public announcement.\n\nThere was a more than 37% increase in the number of droppers used\nin malware distribution. These increases were accompanied by a 20%\n**increase in infrastructure hosting malware, often on legitimate domains.**\n\nAttackers transitioned from Microsoft Word DOCX files to Microsoft Excel\n**XLSX files for malware distribution, largely due to increased usage of Excel**\nmalicious spreadsheets with macros.\n\nThe overall number of malicious Android samples decreased. However, for\nthe first time we found a few Android samples among the most submitted\nand researched samples of the year. We also observed an 146% increase in\nthe number of samples targeting Linux systems.\n\n\n**Log4j had a very noticeable impact both on attackers and defenders.**\nEven though the log4j vulnerability was not publicly revealed until December,\nit shot to the top of the list of those vulnerabilities most often abused by\nattackers in 2021. Four malware samples related to log4j attacks were found\nin the top 10 for most looked up samples during the last quarter of the year.\n\nThe number of fresh CobaltStrike samples grew by 155%, mainly during\nthe first quarter of 2021, to be followed by a wave of VirusTotal users looking\nthose samples up for the rest of the year.\n\nFamilies such as Dridex (1,306% increase in number of samples in 2021\ncompared to 2020) and Gozi (37% increase) bloomed, while others such\nas Emotet (66% decrease), Qakbot (76% decrease) and Smokeloader\n(73% decrease) greatly reduced the number of fresh samples during 2021.\n\nWe detected attackers rotating their RATs (Remote Access Trojans) and\nbackdoors of choice. Padodor/Berbew (2,111% increase in number of samples\nin 2021 compared to 2020) is a clear outlier given its polymorphic nature and\nits (suspected) code reuse by other malware families. AsyncRAT (+139%) and\nFlyagent (+118%) increased in popularity among attackers. On the other hand,\nthe presence of Gravity RAT dropped 99% in 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n### At a Glance\n\nIn general, we didn’t observe any anomaly in the timeline for new samples\nreceived and detected as malicious during 2020 and 2021. If anything, the\ntimeline is generally constant and reaches a plateau by the end of 2021.\n\n2020-01 2020-04 2020-07 2020-10 2021-01 2021-04 2021-07 2021-10 2022-01\n\nFig 1.\n\n**Malware submission timeline.**\n\nThe number of potentially malicious samples (detected as such by five or\nmore different antivirus engines) first seen during the year is almost the\nsame between 2020 (45.86%) and in 2021 (46.12%). When checking the\npercentage of malicious samples generating new malware clusters (by\nsimilarity), which can provide clues to researchers as to how new malware\nsamples are different, we also find almost the same ratio (0.43% vs 0.44%).\n\nWe saw unexpected differences crop up, however, when we\ncompared samples of malicious files as explained in the section below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**+209%**\n\n\n###### How malware distribution evolved  in 2021\n\nIn 2021 we observed the following distribution changes (compared to 2020)\nfor file types used by malicious samples:\n\n**+97%**\n\n**+53%**\n\n**+36%**\n\nPE DOCX Android MACH-O\n\nPDF XLSX Powershell\n\n**-5.3%**\n**-25%** **-28%**\n\n**-97%**\n\nFig 2.\n\n**2021 distribution changes for file types used by malicious samples.**\n\nBelow we provide some ideas to explain these changes.\n\nWindows executable files represent the vast majority of files considered\nas malicious in VirusTotal. The percentage decrease of PE files in 2021 is\ncompensated by the combined increase in other formats. In particular, the\nincrease of DLL files might be read as a technicality to replace PEs in some\nmalware families. Interestingly, the percentage of PE samples implementing\nany kind of exploit increased by 131%.\n\nWe also found a dramatic decrease (97%) in the number of macOSbased MACH-O malicious files. In this case, the explanation can be found in\nthe peak of ransomware “polymorphic” samples belonging to the EvilQuest\nfamily distributed aggressively for macOS in mid-2020 and described in our\n[2021 report “Ransomware in a global context”. EvilQuest is no longer active](https://blog.virustotal.com/2021/10/ransomware-in-global-context.html)\nand there was no similar campaign in 2021, which explains the decrease in\nthe number of samples, but naturally there were new malware families for\n[macOS such as Macma, Xloader, and XcodeSpy.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/analyzing-watering-hole-campaign-using-macos-exploits/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors in 2021 changed from deploying malicious DOCX files\nto malicious XLSX files. Both are some of the most common formats\nfor malware distributed as attachment. Many different campaigns in 2021\nsuch as Emotet, Qakbot, Dridex, Zloader, and Trickbot relied on malicious\nXLSX files to infect their victims. However, the number of files implementing\nexploits in 2021 for both formats increased only for DOCX,\nwhich seems counterintuitive.\n\nWe couldn’t find any technical reason for the transition, although we can\nspeculate that attackers might have decided to abuse formats victims are\nless used to seeing in social engineering attacks. Finally, the increase in VBA\nfiles corresponds to the high use of both formats for malware distribution\nembedding malicious macros.\n\nThe big increment in ELF malware seems to be mainly related to Mirai,\nTsunami and different coin miners. Notably, the number of ELF files\nimplementing exploits increased 135% in 2021, including the exploitation of\nthe Log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228.\n\nThe 97% increase of PDF files seems to be mainly related to phishing\nattacks, often hosted in URLs in-the-wild. On the other hand, we detected\na decrease of 63% in the number of PDF files implementing exploitation\ntechniques.\n\nAlthough there is a decrease in the percentage of Android malicious\nsamples found in 2021, there are two Android samples in the top 10 most\nsubmitted malware of 2021, as well as an Android sample (in this case, a\nbanker) in the top 10 most searched malware in VirusTotal during the last\nquarter of 2021. We detected a moderate increase (12%) in the percentage\nof Android malware implementing some kind of exploit.\n\nThe use of scripting languages for malware distribution is nothing new,\nbut it seems to keep gaining traction. Malicious PowerShell files are popular\nfor this purpose, and in addition to an increase in the adoption by attackers\nof this format, we observed a whopping 282% increase in the number of\nPowerShell files implementing exploits. This can be circumstantial depending\non the ease to exploit some vulnerabilities with this format. In 2021 alone,\nwe found PowerShell scripts exploiting at least 9 different CVEs.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Most submitted samples in 2021\n\nThe list of most submitted malware for the year consists of, not surprisingly,\nwidespread samples such as Adware and PUAs with half of them sharing\nsimilarity clusters and infrastructure. An extended list also includes generic\ntrojans and samples both for Windows and Android.\n\nWhen checking the most looked up samples in VirusTotal during the last\nquarter of 2021, we find all kinds of riskware. When excluding them (as well\nas coin miners - also for Linux), we get a much more interesting top 10:\n\n\n###### Top looked up samples\n\n\n###### Ransomware.Blackmatter\n\n Trojan Danabot\n\n Ransom:MSIL/Khonsari.A\n\n Win64/Exploit.CVE-2021-40449.A\n\n Ransom.Win32.Sabsik\n\n Linux/Mirai\n\n Mirai.Linux\n\n Android.Banker, Bankbot\n\n Danabot, Upatre\n\n Linux/Mirai\n\nNot surprisingly, several of the top positions are filled with ransomware.\nThe exploit for CVE-2021-40449 (Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in\nwin32k) does not appear in our list of top exploits for 2021 in terms of\nsamples abusing it. However, it seems this particular sample was very\nwidespread among victims.\n\nDanabot is also present in two positions of the top 10, as well as Mirai in this case, this might be a reflection of the increase on ELF malware we\nalready discussed. Finally, we see Android makes it to this list with a Banker.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware Distribution\n\nWhile we observed no significant difference in the level of phishing\nartifacts detected in VirusTotal between 2020 and 2021, other distribution\nmechanisms such as the use of exploits or distribution through URLs greatly\nvaried. In terms of malware droppers, we observed a 37% increase in the\nnumber of samples.\n\n###### Usage of Exploits\n\n[57 0-day exploits were found being used in the wild in 2021 - that’s a new](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/0day.html)\nall time record, and almost twice as much as the year before. These exploits\ncovered a wide range of software, starting with usual targets such as\npopular browsers but also server-side software such as Microsoft Exchange\nand devices such as SonicWall Email Security appliances.\n\nDuring 2021 we observed a 24% jump in the number of samples exploiting\nvulnerabilities as compared to 2020. Adding exploit kits to this set of\nsamples bumped the increase to 30%.\n\nThe following chart shows the distribution of samples implementing any\nkind of exploit in 2021.\n\n2021-01 2021-03 2021-05 2021-07 2021-09 2021-11 2022-01\n\nFig 3.\n\n**Malware implementing exploits timeline.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are still a huge number of samples weaponized to abuse\nvulnerabilities more than 5 years old, which is a gentle reminder as to why\nwe should keep systems up-to-date. We decided to focus on how quickly\nattackers adopted new vulnerabilities. The following chart shows the\ntimeline for samples first seen in 2021 that exploit vulnerabilities published\nin 2020 or 2021.\n\ncve-2020-0796 cve-2021-1732 cve-2021-36934\n\ncve-2020-1472 cve-2021-26855 cve-2021-40444\n\n\ncve-2020-7961\n\n\ncve-2021-27065 cve-2021-41379\n\n\ncve-2021-1675 cve-2021-34527 cve-2021-44228\n\ncve-2021-27065 cve-2021-40444\n\ncve-2021-41379\n\ncve-2021-44228\n\n2021-01 2021-03 2021-05 2021-07 2021-09 2021-11 2022-01\n\nFig 4.\n\n**Timeline for malware exploiting 2020 and 2021 vulnerabilities.**\n\nThere are several interesting points to consider. First, peaks occur\nwhen vulnerabilities gain traction for malware distribution. This often\nhappens shortly after a write-up or a Proof-of-Concept is uploaded to\na public repository. After the peak, attackers decide whether the exploit\nbecomes part of their toolset and stays, or if it simply is not useful anymore.\nWe can also see some overlap between exploits where attackers decide\nto use them together, either because they need two vulnerabilities for the\nexploitation or simply to make samples more likely to infect the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\n[We found an interesting peak in March where CVE-2021-26855 and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26855)\n[CVE-2021-27065, both targeting Microsoft Exchange Server, were part](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27065)\nof an attack chain and distributed together. There is another smaller peak\n[for CVE-2021-1732 at the time when the researcher uploaded a PoC to](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1732)\n[GitHub. We found a peak in September for CVE-2021-40444 (remote](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40444)\ncode execution in MSHTML). The peak in November seems to be related\n[to CVE-2021-41379 (Windows Installer escalation of privileges) and in](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41379)\n[December (surprise) we have Log4j CVE-2021-44228.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)\n\n**How are these vulnerabilities being exploited?**\n\nCVE-2021-40444 had 3-4 weeks peak, and was mainly implemented\nby malicious documents detected as Donoff/Wacatac/Cryxos. Afterwards,\nthe number of samples slowly decays.\n\nLog4j’s CVE-2021-44228 was one of the most impactful public\nvulnerabilities in 2021. The timeline below shows detections all year along,\nbut this is because there are plenty of false positives detecting Apache\nLog4j source code itself as the exploit.\n\n2 3 5 6 7 8 10 11 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 24 26 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 52 51 52\n\nweek\n\nFig 5.\n\n**Samples exploiting Log4j CVE-2021-44228.**\n\n[The peak in week 11 (March 2021) corresponds to Tsunami samples used as](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-rce-vulnerability.html)\n[payloads by Mirai in Log4j attacks and wrongly detected as exploiting the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-rce-vulnerability.html)\nvulnerability. Other than that, Mirai and several coin miners seem to have\nbeen heavy adopters of this exploit.\n\n\n-----\n\nPattern analysis indicates that attackers are increasing the speed at which\nexploits are being adopted. The following chart shows this time difference\n(in days) for the most exploited vulnerabilities found in 2020 and 2021 in\nVirusTotal:\n\nCVE-2020-0796\n\nCVE-2020-1472\n\nCVE-2020-0674\n\nCVE-2020-7961\n\nCVE-2020-11899\n\nCVE-2021-1675\n\nCVE-2021-26855\n\nCVE-2021-27065\n\nCVE-2021-40444\n\nCVE-2021-41379\n\nCVE-2021-44228\n\n-50 0 50 100 150\n\nFig 6.\n\n**Days from release until exploitation for most exploited**\n**2020/21 vulnerabilities.**\n\nWe found multiple instances of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the\nwild before details were made public, which we think of as negative days\n(as relative to 0-days, when the vulnerability is first revealed to the public.)\nWhen averaged with vulnerabilities which we found were exploited after\na public announcement, or positive days, the number of days since a\nvulnerability was published until we found samples exploiting it plummeted\nbetween 2020 and 2021. In 2020, it took an average of 93 days for the most\nexploited, published vulnerabilities to be used in a cyberattack. In 2021, it\ntook an average of 0 days for the most exploited, published vulnerabilities\nto be used in a cyberattack, because so many of them were being exploited\nbefore their public announcement.\n\n|CVE-2020-0796 CVE-2020-1472 CVE-2020-7961 CVE-2020-11899 CVE-2021-1675 CVE-2021-41379|CVE-2020-0674|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||CVE-2021-26855 CVE-2021-27065 CVE-2021-40444 CVE-2021-44228||||\n\n\n-----\n\nThe selection of vulnerabilities in the previous chart is based on their\npopularity in numbers of samples exploiting them found in VirusTotal.\n[Publication date for vulnerabilities is provided by CVEdetails,it is possible](https://www.cvedetails.com/)\nthat some vulnerabilities get officially published after being discovered\nin the wild.\n\n###### Malware distribution in the wild\n\nCompared to 2020, we observed a very slight increase in the number of\nmalware samples being distributed in the wild (ITW). However, the number\nof URLs where ITW malware was found increased by 20%. This means that\nmalware samples that were distributed using this method were more widely\nspread, and the generation of unique URLs for their distribution became\nmore common. Factors that contributed to this increase include the usage\nof legitimate cloud storage and file-sharing services.\n\nThe chart below shows the top ten URLs used for malware distribution\nduring 2021.\n\n2021-01 2021-03 2021-05 2021-07 2021-09 2021-11 2022-01\n\nFig 7.\n\n**Top 10 URLs distributing malware in 2021.**\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, some of them were consistently distributed during the year\nwhile others go up and down depending on how they are used in different\ncampaigns. If we isolate domains used for malware distribution, it looks\nas follows:\n\n2021-01 2021-03 2021-05 2021-07 2021-09 2021-11 2022-01\n\nFig 8.\n\n**Top 10 domains distributing malware in 2021.**\n\nHere, the usage of domains look a bit more distributed in different\ncampaigns for a certain period of time. The biggest campaigns for the first\nhalf of 2021 correspond to malware (mostly PDFs used in phishing attacks)\ndistributed through legitimate domains such as Amazonaws. However, in the\nsecond half of the year, distribution through both domains is almost nonexistent. Another top 10 domain used for malware distribution is discordapp,\nwhich seems to have been gaining popularity during the last months.\n\nThere are several families that used hundreds of ITW URLs for distribution\nduring 2021, including Mirai, Azorult, and Glupteba. Phishing attacks also\ngreatly abused this kind of distribution vector.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware Trends\n\n###### Footholding and Lateral movement\n\nThere are a number of artifacts potentially used by attackers for lateral\nmovement, many of which are not necessarily malicious. It is common to\nuse the same toolset that pentesters and system administrators do. There\nare also several malware families from the following section (RATs) that\nimplement the capabilities needed in the first stages of an attack. Having\nsaid that, in this section we want to provide insights into how several tools\ntraditionally used by attackers in the first stages of all kinds of attacks\nevolved during the year according to our visibility.\n\n###### CobaltStrike\n\nThis is one of the favorite tools used both by pentesters and attackers.\nWe observed an increase of 155% of fresh samples seen in 2021 for this\nartifact, with submissions peaking during the first quarter of the year.\n\n2020-01 2020-05 2020-09 2021-01 2021-04 2021-07 2021-10 2022-01\n\nFig 9.\n\n**CobaltStrike submission timeline.**\n\nDespite the new samples being first seen during that first Q, the interest\nfrom VirusTotal users searching for them in our platform is quite constant\nduring the year, reflecting how these freshly created samples were later\nreused in different attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n2020-11 2021-02 2021-06 2021-12 2022-01\n\nFig 10.\n\n**CobaltStrike lookup timeline.**\n\n###### Meterpreter\n\nSimilar to CobaltStrike, this is one of the most popular choices by pentesters\nand attackers, enabling similar functionalities. During 2021, the number of\nfirst seen samples was 23% lower than in the previous year. However, the\nnumber of submissions is incredibly constant during the last two years. We\ncan observe a peak in the number of lookups in February-March 2021.\n\n2020-12 2021-01 2021-02 2021-04 2021-05 2021-06 2021-08 2021-09 2021-10\n\n2021-12 2022-01\n\nFig 11.\n\n**Meterpreter lookup timeline.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mimikatz\n\nAlthough there is a 75.5% decrease in the number of fresh samples seen in\n2021, in this case the freshness of the sample is probably not as significant\nas it could be for other malware families. Despite that, we observe the\nbiggest historical peaks of submissions for this artifact between August\nand October 2021:\n\n2009-02 2014-01 2015-06 2016-06 2017-04 2017-11 2018-05 2018-12 2019-10 2020-08 2021-02 2021-08 2022-01\n\nFig 12. Mimikatz submission timeline.\n\nWe also can see a record number of lookups by VirusTotal users around\nMarch-April of 2021:\n\n2020-11 2021-02 2021-04 2021-07 2021-10 2022-01\n\nFig 13. Mimikatz lookup timeline.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition we looked at some of the most traditional bots. In reality,\nthis kind of malware should be considered as multi-purpose as it is still an\nexcellent option for many attacks that leverage the existing victim base and\nthe basic capabilities as the first stage for more sophisticated attacks. The\nevolution for some of the most well-known bots during 2021 is as follows:\n\n###### +37.8% +11.2%\n\n# +1306%\n\n**Rbot**\n\n**Gozi**\n\n**Dridex**\n\n###### -37% -66.6% -72%\n\n**Zloader**\n\n\n**Emotet**\n\n\n**Nymeria**\n\n\n###### -99% -76%\n\n\n**Smokeloader**\n\n\n**Qakbot**\n\n\n**Dorkbot**\n\n\nGiven the incredible increase in 2021, we did a more detailed analysis\nof Dridex.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Dridex\n\nWe observed a huge number of fresh Dridex samples during 2021 as well\nas submissions, where we registered two historical peaks of submissions for\nthis kind of malware during the year despite being a veteran malware family.\n\n2020-06 2020-10 2021-01 2021-03 2021-06 2021-08 2021-11 2022-01\n\nFig 14. Dridex submission timeline.\n\nThe spike in the number of lookups by VirusTotal users reflects their interest\nin these samples, most likely motivated by their wide distribution.\n\n2020-11 2021-02 2021-04 2021-07 2021-10 2022-01\n\nFig 15. Dridex lookup timeline.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Several public sources discussed Dridex campaigns spreading through](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-dridex-variant-being-spread-by-crafted-excel-document)\nExcel documents during 2021.\n\n###### Remote Access Trojans (RATs)  and Backdoors\n\nRATs are one of the most used malicious tools by attackers for all kinds of\noperations, especially in the first stages of an attack – regardless of the\nattack’s sophistication. They are part of every attacker’s toolbox, and for the\nlast few years attackers have chosen widely available RATs over in-house\ndevelopment except in very specific cases (mostly by APT actors). RATs\nallow attackers to perform reconnaissance, deploy other malicious tools as\nneeded, and avoid attribution. That’s why it is important to keep an eye on\nwhat RATs and backdoors are the most commonly chosen by attackers for\ntheir operations.\n\nThe choice of RATs for attacks changed quite a bit during the year according\nto the number of samples found in VirusTotal. Here is the ranking of families\nthat dramatically increased their presence in 2021:\n\n###### Families % increase\n\n\n###### PADODOR/BERBEW\n\n ASYNCRAT\n\n FLYAGENT\n\n ORCUSRAT\n\n NOANCOOE\n\n\n###### +2,111%\n\n +139%\n\n +118%\n\n +102%\n\n +102%\n\n\nThere is a large number of samples (including polymorphic families)\nthat trigger Padodor/Berbew detections as they share some execution\ncharacteristics, including the use of the same Mutex. Speculatively, this\ncould be explained by some code reuse, or maybe these families are\ndesigned to trigger this detection on purpose.\n\nWe also observed a growth in Crowdsourced Yara rules detecting AsyncRAT,\nwhich is the second fastest growing family. Flyagent made it to the top three\nand is one of the most significant families by total number of samples at the\ntime of writing this report.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, Yara rules detecting DCRat, SystemBC, and Blackshades RAT\nmalware were among the ones showing most significant growth in 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, the following list shows families whose usage decreased\nlast year – in some cases having almost no new fresh samples in 2021:\n\n###### Families % decrease\n\n\n###### ​GRAVITYRAT\n\n SHIZ\n\n NETWIREDRC\n\n REMCOSRAT\n\n XTREMERAT\n\n\n###### -99%\n\n -93%\n\n -82%\n\n -82%\n\n -74%\n\n\nDespite having a usage decrease, Bladabindi and Darkcomet still are in the\ntop five by total number of samples first seen by VirusTotal in 2021. The top\nfive RAT families in absolute numbers first seen in VirusTotal in the last two\nyears is as follows:\n\n\n###### Top 5 RAT Families\n\n\n###### PADODOR/BERBEW\n\n BLADABINDI\n\n SHIZ\n\n REMCOSRAT\n\n DARKCOMET\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Crowdsourced data\n\nIn this section, we checked samples belonging to different Crowdsourced\nYara rules and VirusTotal Collections in order to understand which ones had\nrelevant changes during the year.\n\nIn terms of fast-growing Yara rules, other than the ones described in the\nprevious section (DCRat, AsyncRAT, SystemBC and Blackshades RAT), there\nare several generic ones based on detecting invalid certificates or packers.\nAdditionally, we also found several fast-growing Collections tracking\ndifferent RATs, such as SystemBC, Sakula RAT or buteRAT. One of the rules\nwith a bigger growth during the year detects a tool used for large scale\nDDoS attacks.\n\nDuring the first half of the year we also observed remarkable growth\nof rules detecting CobaltStrike and BazarLoader. For the second half, the\nfastest growing rules detect Quantum Locker, Ryuk, Moonwind and FatDuke.\nWe also saw Collections for Moonwind and Ryuk growing at a similar rate\nfor the same period of time.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers are faster in adopting exploits for new vulnerabilities.\nThis includes the exploitation of 0-days as well as adoption of\npublished ones.\n\nThere is an increase of malware distribution through droppers as\nwell as an increase in the infrastructure used for malware hosting,\noften using legitimate domains.\n\nThe total number of samples for Android decreased but, at the\nsame time, some specific samples were among the most searched\nby VirusTotal users. The number of malicious ELF files increased.\n\nSome malware families (like Dridex, Gozi or AsyncRAT)\nskyrocketed in 2021, while the usage of others (like Emotet\nor Quakbot) severely decreased.\n\nLog4j vulnerability had a noticeable impact translated into different\nmalware families adopting it and security practitioners monitoring\nits evolution. This tells us about the relevance of such vulnerabilities\nin the security ecosystem.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on all the above, here are some considerations for including this\n\ninsight in an effective security strategy:\n\n**Vulnerability patching is critical. Consider using environments**\nthat provide effective and agile patching strategies.\n\n**Monitoring the usage and spreading of malware families is crucial**\nto prioritize effective defenses.\n\n**Transformative security events, such as the Log4j vulnerability**\n(CVE-2021-44228), quickly change the security ecosystem. Effective\nmonitoring and remediation is critical.\n\n**Do not underestimate the presence of well-known malware**\n**families (such as Dridex) in your systems, as they can be first stagers**\nfor serious attacks.\n\n**Educate your staff against phishing and social engineering, no**\nmatter the format of the attachment, the domain hosting the file, or\nthe channel used for distribution.\n\n###### We hope this data is a first step to an open, healthy discussion that can help researchers understand how to better protect against these threats. We trust the information shared in this report will prove useful -  and that it will keep our world a little bit safer.\n\n Join the discussion @virustotal\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n###### 2022\n\n\n###### 2022\n\n\n###### Find out more at: virustotal.com\n\n\n###### 2022\n\n\n-----",
