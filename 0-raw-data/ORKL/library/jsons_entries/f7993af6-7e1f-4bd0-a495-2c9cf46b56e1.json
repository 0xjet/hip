In this analysis, we observed the return of Hidden Cobra’s Bankshot malware\nimplant surfacing in the Turkish financial system. Based on the code similarity, the victim’s\nbusiness sector, and the presence of control server strings, this attack resembles previous\nattacks by Hidden Cobra conducted against the global financial network [SWIFT.](https://www.swift.com/)\n\nIn this new, aggressive campaign we see a return of the Bankshot implant, which last\nappeared in 2017. Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim’s network for further\nexploitation; thus the Advanced Threat Research team believes this operation is intended to\ngain access to specific financial organizations.\n\nBased on our analysis, financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing\nemails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. The document contains an\nembedded Adobe Flash exploit, which was recently announced by the Korean Internet\n[Security agency. The exploit, which takes advantage of CVE-2018-4878, allows an attacker to](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/hackers-bypassed-adobe-flash-protection-mechanism/)\nexecute arbitrary code such as an implant.\n\nthe Further investigation into this campaign and analysis of McAfee product telemetry\nshows that the infection occurred on March 2 and 3. The implant’s first target was a major\ngovernment-controlled financial organization. It next appeared in another Turkish\ngovernment organization involved in finance and trade. A further three large financial\ninstitutions in Turkey were victims of this attack. The implant has so far not surfaced in any\nother sector or country. This campaign suggests the attackers may plan a future heist\nagainst these targets by using Bankshot to gather information.\n\nBankshot implants are distributed from a domain with a name similar to that of the\ncryptocurrency-lending platform Falcon Coin, but the similarly named domain is not\nassociated with the legitimate entity. The malicious domain falcancoin.io was created\nDecember 27, 2017, and was updated on February 19, only a few days before the implants\nbegan to appear. These implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a remote\n\n\n-----\n\naccess tool that gives an attacker full capability on a victim s system. This implant also\ncontains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence\nor perform other destructive actions. Bankshot was first reported by the Department of\nHomeland Security on December 13, 2017, and has only recently resurfaced in newly\ncompiled variants. The sample we analyzed is 99% similar to the documented Bankshot\nvariants from 2017.\n\n_Bankshot implants hosted on falcancoin.io._\n\nThe Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document with the filename\nAgreement.docx. The document appears to be an agreement template for Bitcoin\ndistribution between an unknown individual in Paris and a to-be-determined cryptocurrency\nexchange. The author of this document is test-pc. It was created February 26 and was\nsubmitted from the Netherlands. The document contains an embedded Flash script that\nexploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.\n\nWe discovered two more documents, written in Korean, that exploit the same vulnerability\nas Agreement.docx. These documents appear to be part of the same campaign and may\nhave been used on different targets. These documents also communicated with\nfalcancoin.io to install Bankshot and also contain themes around cryptocurrency security.\n\nTwo Flash files exploit CVE-2018-4878.\n\n843c17b06a3aee22447f021307909890b68828b9 (February 25)\n343ebca579bb888eb8ccb811f9b52280c72e484c (February 25\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious documents in the attack.\n\nMalicious document exploiting CVE-2018-4878.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe implants are downloaded via a Flash file embedded in the malicious document. They\nare executed when the victim views the document.\n\n_The malicious site falcancoin.io embedded in the Flash file._\n\n_Implant directory contained in the malicious Flash file._\n\nThe implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with three control servers,\ntwo of them Chinese-language online gambling sites. These URLs can be found hardcoded\nin the implants’ code.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hardcoded control server URLs._\n\n## Analyzing Bankshot\n\nThe sample (a2e966edee45b30bb6bb5c978e55833eec169098) is a Windows DLL that serves\nas a backdoor and contains a variety of capabilities. The malicious DLL is not a service DLL\nbecause it lacks ServiceMain(). To mask itself, it can run as a regular library loaded into a\nlegitimate process.\n\nThe malware begins by creating a new thread from the DllMain() function to carry out its\nmalicious activities:\n\n\n-----\n\n_New thread created in the malware’s DllMain() function._\n\nThe malware performs the following activities:\n\nBuilds imports by dynamically loading APIs\nDecrypts strings needed for control server communications\nPerforms control server communications\nHandles commands issued by the control server\nUninstalls self from the system\n\nThe malicious thread dynamically loads the APIs it needs at the beginning of its execution\nusing LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress(). APIs from the following libraries are loaded at\nruntime:\n\nKernel32.dll\nWs2_32/wsock32.dll\nApvapi32.dll\nOleaut32.dll\nIphlp.dll\nUrlmon.dll\n\n_A dynamic API loaded by the malware._\n\nBased on packet capture analysis of previous implants from 2017, the following strings are\nused in control server communications:\n\n_Connection: keep-alive_\n_Cache-Control: max-age=0_\n_Accept: */*_\n_Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=_\n_Content-Type: application/octet-stream_\n_Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch_\n_Accept-Language: ko-KR -> Korean_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”board id”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”user_id”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”img01_29.jpg”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”my.doc”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”pratice.pdf”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”king.jpg”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”dream.avi”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”hp01.avi”_\n_Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”star.avi”_\n\n## User Agents\n\nThe implant either fetches the user agent from Internet Explorer (using\nObtainUserAgentAsString()) or uses a default user agent specified in the malware binary:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) Chrome/28.0.1500.95 Safari/537.36\n\n## Control Server Communications\n\nThe malware initiates communication with the control server by sending it an HTTP POST\nrequest with additional optional HTTP data, such as:\n\n------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"board_id\"\n\n**8306**\n\n------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>\n\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user_id\"\n\n***dJU!*JE&!M@UNQ@**\n------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>\n\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file1\"; filename=\"king.jpg\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n**board_id is a four-digit number that may be an identifier for a campaign ID. Based on**\nanalysis of previous samples, this is a unique identifier.\n**user_id is a hardcoded value in the malware binary that is sent to the control server.**\nThe username appears to be attacker specified and has occurred in 2017 Bankshot\nsamples. This links the previous samples with this unique username.\n**filename is based on static analysis. This looks like a specific beacon to indicate that**\nthe malware is ready to receive commands.\n\nThe optional HTTP data with king.jpg looks like a beacon to inform the control server that\nthe malware is ready to accept new commands:\n\nCommands received from the control server are encoded DWORDs\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decoding, these DWORDs should be in the range 123459h to 123490h\n\n_Malware checking to make sure a received command is in the correct range._\n\n_The command index calculator and jump to the appropriate command._\n\n\n-----\n\n_The command index table and command handler address table._\n\n## Implant Capabilities\n\nBased on the responses received from the control server, the malware can carry out the\nfollowing malicious tasks:\n\nRecursively generate a list of files in a directory and send to the control server\nTerminate a specific process. The process is identified by the control server sending\nthe PID to the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The capability to terminate a process._\n\nGather network addresses and operating system version\nExecute arbitrary commands using “cmd.exe /c”\n\n_The capability to execute system commands._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Spawning arbitrary processes._\n\nCreate processes\nWrite responses from the control server to a file\nSend information for all drives\nWrite data sent by the control server to a temporary file matching the file path pattern\n%temp%\\DWS00*\nChange the time of a file as specified by the control server\n\n_The malware changing the file time._\n\nCreate a process by impersonating a logged-on user\n\n\n-----\n\n_Getting a user token using WTSQueryUserToken._\n\n_A process created as logged-in user._\n\nGather the process time for all processes\n\n_Getting time information for all processes running on the system._\n\nGather domain and account names based on all running processes\n\n\n-----\n\n_Gathering account information from running processes._\n\nRead a specified file’s contents and send the data to the control server\nWrite data sent by the control server to an existing file\nMark a file to be deleted on reboot\n\n_Marking a file for deletion on reboot._\n\nOverwrite a file with all zeros and mark it for deletion on reboot\n\n\n-----\n\n_Wiping files with zeros and marking it for deletion on reboot._\n\nDelete files using the DeleteFile() API\nLoad an arbitrary library into its process space. This may be used to load additional\ndownloaded components of the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Loading an arbitrary library into its own process space._\n\nAfter every action is performed the malware sends a response to the control server\nindicating whether the action was successful.\n\n## Connections\n\n[The US government reports that Bankshot is used by Hidden Cobra to target multiple](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318A)\nindustries including financial organizations. This implant has been connected to a major\n[Korean bank attack and is also known as Trojan Manuscript. That variant contained the](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Shen-Nation-State Moneymules-Hunting-Season-APT-Attacks-Targeting-Financial-Institutions.pdf)\ncapability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network and the same control server\nstrings as the variant we found targeting the Turkish financial sector. The implant does not\nconduct financial transactions; rather it is a channel into the victim’s environment, in which\nfurther stages of implants can be deployed for financial reconnaissance. The Bankshot\nimplant was also observed in 2017 in documents appearing to come from Latin American\nbanks.\n\n_Malicious document delivering the Bankshot implant in 2017._\n\nThese connections, combined with the implant’s nearly identical appearance to known\nvariants, are a strong indication that we have uncovered a Hidden Cobra attack. Further,\nprevious implants from 2017 contained bogus documents with financially themed content.\n\n_A code comparison of hash 12c786c490366727cf7279fc141921d8 with hash_\n\n_6de6a0df263ecd2d71a92597b2362f2c (from November 28, 2017)._\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have found what may be an early data-gathering stage for future possible heists from\nfinancial organizations in Turkey (and possibly other countries). In this campaign, we see the\nadoption of a recent zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability to get the implant onto the victim’s\nsystems.\n\nThe campaign has a high chance of success against victims who have an unpatched version\nof Flash. Documents with the Flash exploit managed to evade static defenses and remain\nundetected as an exploit on VirusTotal. This is the first time that Bankshot has been tied\ndirectly to financial-related hacking and the first time it has been used since November\n2017.\n\nMcAfee detects these threats as:\n\nRDN/Generic Exploit\nRDN/Generic.dx\nGeneric PWS.y\n**Generic.hbg**\nExploit-CVE2018-4878\n\nMcAfee customers are also covered by McAfee Global Threat Intelligence Web Reputation\nclassification, which rate these URLs as High Risk.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nExfiltration over command and control channel\nCommonly used port\nCommand-line interface\nService execution\nAutomated collection\nData from local system\nProcess discovery\nSystem time discovery\nCredential dumping\nExploitation of vulnerability\nProcess injection\nFile deletion\n\n### Hashes\n\n650b7d25f4ed87490f8467eb48e0443fb244a8c4\n65e7d2338735ec04fd9692d020298e5a7953fd8d\n\n\n-----\n\n166e8c643a4db0df6ffd6e3ab536b3de9edc9fb7\na2e966edee45b30bb6bb5c978e55833eec169098\n\n### Domains\n\n530hr[dot]com/data/common.php\n028xmz[dot]com/include/common.php\n168wangpi[dot]com/include/charset.php\nFalcancoin[dot]io\n\n\n-----",
