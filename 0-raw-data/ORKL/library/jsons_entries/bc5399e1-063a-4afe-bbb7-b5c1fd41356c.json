Organizations should increase\nvigilance and evaluate their capabilities, encompassing planning, preparation, detection, and\nresponse, for such an event. This section is focused on the threat of malware using enterprise-scale\ndistributed propagation methods and provides recommended guidance and considerations for an\norganization to address as part of their network architecture, security baseline, continuous monitoring,\nand incident response practices.\n\nCISA and the FBI urge all organizations to implement the following recommendations to increase their\ncyber resilience against this threat.\n\n### Potential Distribution Vectors\n\nDestructive malware may use popular communication tools to spread, including worms sent through\nemail and instant messages, Trojan horses dropped from websites, and virus-infected files\ndownloaded from peer-to-peer connections. Malware seeks to exploit existing vulnerabilities on\nsystems for quiet and easy access.\n\nThe malware has the capability to target a large scope of systems and can execute across multiple\nsystems throughout a network. As a result, it is important for organizations to assess their\nenvironment for atypical channels for malware delivery and/or propagation throughout their systems.\nSystems to assess include:\n\n  - Enterprise applications – particularly those that have the capability to directly interface with\nand impact multiple hosts and endpoints. Common examples include:\n```\n     o Patch management systems,\n     o Asset management systems,\n     o Remote assistance software (typically used by the corporate help desk),\n     o Antivirus (AV) software,\n     o Systems assigned to system and network administrative personnel,\n     o Centralized backup servers, and\n     o Centralized file shares.\n\n```\nWhile not only applicable to malware, threat actors could compromise additional resources to impact\nthe availability of critical data and applications. Common examples include:\n\n  - Centralized storage devices\n```\n     o Potential risk – direct access to partitions and data warehouses.\n\n```\n  - Network devices\n```\n     o Potential risk – capability to inject false routes within the routing table, delete specific\n\n```\nroutes from the routing table, remove/modify configuration attributes, or destroy\nfirmware or system binaries—which could isolate or degrade availability of critical\nnetwork resources.\n\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n### Best Practices and Planning Strategies\n\nCommon strategies can be followed to strengthen an organization’s resilience against destructive\nmalware. Targeted assessment and enforcement of best practices should be employed for enterprise\ncomponents susceptible to destructive malware.\n\n#### Communication Flow\n\n  - Ensure proper network segmentation.\n\n  - Ensure that network-based access control lists (ACLs) are configured to permit server-to-host\nand host-to-host connectivity via the minimum scope of ports and protocols and that\ndirectional flows for connectivity are represented appropriately.\n```\n     o Communications flow paths should be fully defined, documented, and authorized.\n\n```\n  - Increase awareness of systems that can be used as a gateway to pivot (lateral movement) or\ndirectly connect to additional endpoints throughout the enterprise.\n```\n     o Ensure that these systems are contained within restrictive Virtual Local Area Networks\n\n```\n(VLANs), with additional segmentation and network access controls.\n\n  - Ensure that centralized network and storage devices’ management interfaces reside on\nrestrictive VLANs.\n```\n     o Layered access control, and\n     o Device-level access control enforcement – restricting access from only pre-defined\n\n```\nVLANs and trusted IP ranges.\n\n#### Access Control\n\n  - For enterprise systems that can directly interface with multiple endpoints:\n```\n     o Require multifactor authentication for interactive logons.\n     o Ensure that authorized users are mapped to a specific subset of enterprise personnel.\n\n```\n         - If possible, the “Everyone,” “Domain Users,” or the “Authenticated Users”\ngroups should not be permitted the capability to directly access or authenticate\nto these systems.\n```\n     o Ensure that unique domain accounts are used and documented for each enterprise\n\n```\napplication service.\n\n         - Context of permissions assigned to these accounts should be fully documented\nand configured based upon the concept of least privilege.\n\n         - Provides an enterprise with the capability to track and monitor specific actions\ncorrelating to an application’s assigned service account.\n```\n     o If possible, do not grant a service account with local or interactive logon permissions.\n\n```\n         - Service accounts should be explicitly denied permissions to access network\nshares and critical data locations.\n```\n     o Accounts that are used to authenticate to centralized enterprise application servers or\n\n```\ndevices should not contain elevated permissions on downstream systems and\nresources throughout the enterprise.\n\n  - Continuously review centralized file share ACLs and assigned permissions.\n```\n     o Restrict Write/Modify/Full Control permissions when possible.\n\n#### Monitoring\n\n```\n  - Audit and review security logs for anomalous references to enterprise-level administrative\n(privileged) and service accounts.\n\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n```\n     o Failed logon attempts,\n     o File share access, and\n     o Interactive logons via a remote session.\n\n```\n  - Review network flow data for signs of anomalous activity, including:\n```\n     o Connections using ports that do not correlate to the standard communications flow\n\n```\nassociated with an application,\n```\n     o Activity correlating to port scanning or enumeration, and\n     o Repeated connections using ports that can be used for command and control\n\n```\npurposes.\n\n  - Ensure that network devices log and audit all configuration changes.\n```\n     o Continually review network device configurations and rule sets to ensure that\n\n```\ncommunications flows are restricted to the authorized subset of rules.\n\n#### File Distribution\n\n  - When deploying patches or AV signatures throughout an enterprise, stage the distributions to\ninclude a specific grouping of systems (staggered over a pre-defined period).\n```\n     o This action can minimize the overall impact in the event that an enterprise patch\n\n```\nmanagement or AV system is leveraged as a distribution vector for a malicious\npayload.\n\n  - Monitor and assess the integrity of patches and AV signatures that are distributed throughout\nthe enterprise.\n```\n     o Ensure updates are received only from trusted sources,\n     o Perform file and data integrity checks, and\n     o Monitor and audit – as related to the data that is distributed from an enterprise\n\n```\napplication.\n\n#### System and Application Hardening\n\n  - Ensure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place.\n```\n     o CISA maintains a living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant\n\n```\nrisk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities. In addition to\nthoroughly testing and implementing vendor patches in a timely—and, if possible,\nautomated—manner, organizations should ensure patching of the vulnerabilities CISA\nincludes in this catalog.\n\n  - Ensure that the underlying operating system (OS) and dependencies (e.g., Internet\nInformation Services [IIS], Apache, Structured Query Language [SQL]) supporting an\napplication are configured and hardened based upon industry-standard best practice\nrecommendations. Implement application-level security controls based on best practice\nguidance provided by the vendor. Common recommendations include:\n```\n     o Use role-based access control,\n     o Prevent end-user capabilities to bypass application-level security controls,\n\n```\n         - For example, do not allow users to disable AV on local workstations.\n```\n     o Remove, or disable unnecessary or unused features or packages, and\n     o Implement robust application logging and auditing.\n\n```\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n#### Recovery and Reconstitution Planning\n[A business impact analysis (BIA) is a key component of contingency planning and preparation. The](https://www.ready.gov/business-impact-analysis)\noverall output of a BIA will provide an organization with two key components (as related to critical\nmission/business operations):\n\n  - Characterization and classification of system components, and\n\n  - Interdependencies.\n\nBased upon the identification of an organization’s mission critical assets (and their associated\ninterdependencies), in the event that an organization is impacted by destructive malware, recovery\nand reconstitution efforts should be considered.\n\nTo plan for this scenario, an organization should address the availability and accessibility for the\nfollowing resources (and should include the scope of these items within incident response exercises\nand scenarios):\n\n  - Comprehensive inventory of all mission critical systems and applications:\n```\n     o Versioning information,\n     o System/application dependencies,\n     o System partitioning/storage configuration and connectivity, and\n     o Asset owners/points of contact.\n\n```\n  - Contact information for all essential personnel within the organization,\n\n  - Secure communications channel for recovery teams,\n\n  - Contact information for external organizational-dependent resources:\n```\n     o Communication providers,\n     o Vendors (hardware/software), and\n     o Outreach partners/external stakeholders\n\n```\n  - Service contract numbers – for engaging vendor support,\n\n  - Organizational procurement points of contact,\n\n  - Optical disc image (ISO)/image files for baseline restoration of critical systems and\napplications:\n```\n     o OS installation media,\n     o Service packs/patches,\n     o Firmware, and\n     o Application software installation packages.\n\n```\n  - Licensing/activation keys for OS and dependent applications,\n\n  - Enterprise network topology and architecture diagrams,\n\n  - System and application documentation,\n\n  - Hard copies of operational checklists and playbooks,\n\n  - System and application configuration backup files,\n\n  - Data backup files (full/differential),\n\n  - System and application security baseline and hardening checklists/guidelines, and\n\n  - System and application integrity test and acceptance checklists.\n\n#### Incident Response\nVictims of a destructive malware attacks should immediately focus on containment to reduce the\nscope of affected systems. Strategies for containment include:\n\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n  - Determining a vector common to all systems experiencing anomalous behavior (or having\nbeen rendered unavailable)—from which a malicious payload could have been delivered:\n```\n     o Centralized enterprise application,\n     o Centralized file share (for which the identified systems were mapped or had access),\n     o Privileged user account common to the identified systems,\n     o Network segment or boundary, and\n     o Common Domain Name System (DNS) server for name resolution.\n\n```\n  - Based upon the determination of a likely distribution vector, additional mitigation controls can\nbe enforced to further minimize impact:\n```\n     o Implement network-based ACLs to deny the identified application(s) the capability to\n\n```\ndirectly communicate with additional systems,\n\n         - Provides an immediate capability to isolate and sandbox specific systems or\nresources.\n```\n     o Implement null network routes for specific IP addresses (or IP ranges) from which the\n\n```\npayload may be distributed,\n\n         - An organization’s internal DNS can also be leveraged for this task, as a null\npointer record could be added within a DNS zone for an identified server or\napplication.\n```\n     o Readily disable access for suspected user or service account(s), \n     o For suspect file shares (which may be hosting the infection vector), remove access or\n\n```\ndisable the share path from being accessed by additional systems, and\n```\n     o Be prepared to, if necessary, reset all passwords and tickets within directories (e.g.,\n\n```\nchanging golden/silver tickets).\n\nAs related to incident response and incident handling, organizations are encouraged to report\nincidents to the FBI and CISA (see the Contact section below) and to preserve forensic data for use in\n[internal investigation of the incident or for possible law enforcement purposes.

The binaries are predominantly .Net and are obfuscated. Obfuscation varies; some of\nthe binaries contain multiple layers of obfuscation. Analysis identified multiple uses of string reversal,\ncharacter replacement, base64 encoding, and packing. Additionally, the malicious binaries contain\nmultiple defenses including VM checks, sandbox detection and evasion, and anti-debugging\ntechniques. Finally, the sleep command was used in varying lengths via PowerShell to obfuscate\nexecution on a victim’s network.\n\nAll Microsoft .doc files contain a malicious macro that is base64 encoded. Upon enabling the macro,\na PowerShell script runs a sleep command and then downloads a file from an external site. The script\nconnects to the external website via HTTP to download an executable. Upon download, the\nexecutable is saved to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\ filepath on the victim host.\n\nAn identified zip file was found to contain the Microsoft Word file macro_t1smud.doc. Once the\nmacro is enabled, a bash script runs a sleep command and the script connects to\n```\nhtxxps://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe. This binary is likely the\n\n```\nlegitimate Putty Secure Shell binary.
