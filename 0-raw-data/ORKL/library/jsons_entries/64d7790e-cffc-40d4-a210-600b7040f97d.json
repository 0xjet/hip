The threats typically\nleverage COVID-19 themes including testing information and the new Omicron variant.\n\nProofpoint observed COVID-19 themes impacting education institutions throughout the\npandemic, but consistent, targeted credential theft campaigns using such lures targeting\n[universities began in October 2021. Following the announcement of the new Omicron variant](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern)\nin late November, the threat actors began leveraging the new variant in credential theft\ncampaigns.\n\nThreat actors continue to use COVID-19 theme lures in campaigns targeting multiple\nindustries and geographic areas. The threats specifically targeting universities is interesting\ndue to the specificity in targeting and effort to mimic legitimate login portals. It is likely this\nactivity will increase in the next two months as colleges and universities provide and require\ntesting for students, faculty, and other workers traveling to and from campus during and after\nthe holiday season, and as the Omicron variant emerges more widely.\n\nWe expect more threat actors will adopt COVID-19 themes given the introduction of the\n[Omicron variant. This assessment is based on previously published research that identified](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/delta-variant-spreads-covid-19-themes-make-resurgence-email-threats)\nCOVID-19 themes making a resurgence in email campaigns\n\nfollowing the emergence of the Delta variant in August 2021.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nThe COVID-19 themed campaigns including Omicron variant lures include thousands of\nmessages targeted to dozens of universities in North America.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [phishing emails contain attachments or URLs for pages intended to harvest credentials](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)\nfor university accounts. The landing pages typically imitate the university’s official login\nportal, although some campaigns feature generic Office 365 login portals. In some cases,\nsuch as the Omicron variant lures, victims are redirected to a legitimate university\ncommunication after credentials are harvested. Proofpoint observed this threat actor pivot\nfrom Delta variant themed email lures to Omicron themes following the announcement of the\nnew variant.\n\nEmails with URLs use subjects such as:\n\nAttention Required - Information Regarding COVID-19 Omicron Variant - November 29\n\nWith a link to a spoofed landing page such as:\n\n_Figure 1: Spoofed login page for the University of Central Missouri._\n\nMessages distributing attachments included subject lines such as “Covid Test”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: HTM attachment leading to a credential capture webpage._\n\nThe attachments lead to a university themed email credential theft webpage.\n\n_Figure 3: Credential theft webpage spoofing Vanderbilt University._\n\nProofpoint has identified multiple threat clusters using COVID-19 themes to target\nuniversities using different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In addition to multiple\ndelivery methods – Proofpoint has observed both URL and attachments in campaigns –\nactivity clusters use different sender and hosting methods to distribute credential theft\ncampaigns.\n\nIn the Omicron variant campaign, threat actors leverage actor-controlled infrastructure to\nhost credential theft webpages using similar domain naming patterns. These include:\n\nsso[.]ucmo[.]edu[.]boring[.]cf/Covid19/authenticationedpoint.html\nsso2[.]astate[.]edu[.]boring[.]cf/login/authenticationedpoint.html\n\nAttachment-based campaigns have leveraged legitimate but compromised WordPress\nwebsites to host credential capture webpages, including:\n\n\n-----\n\nhfbcbiblestudy[.]org/demo1/includes/jah/[university]/auth[.]php\nafr-tours[.]co[.]za/includes/css/js/edu/web/etc/login[.]php\ntraveloaid[.]com/css/js/[university]/auth[.]php\n\n[In some campaigns, threat actors attempted to steal multifactor authentication (MFA)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/multifactor-authentication)\ncredentials, spoofing MFA providers such as Duo. Stealing MFA tokens enables the attacker\nto bypass the second layer of security designed to keep out threat actors who already know\na victim’s username and password.\n\n_Figure 4: Duo MFA credential theft landing page._\n\nWhile many messages are sent via spoofed senders, Proofpoint has observed threat actors\nleveraging legitimate, compromised university accounts to send COVID-19 themed threats. It\nis likely the threat actors are stealing credentials from universities and using compromised\nmailboxes to send the same threats to other universities.\n\nProofpoint does not attribute this activity to a known actor or threat group, and the ultimate\nobjective of the threat actors is currently unknown.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nIndicator Description\n\nhfbcbiblestudy[.]org/demo1/includes/jah/[university]/auth[.]php Credential Theft URL\n\n\n-----\n\nafr-tours[.]co[.]za/includes/css/js/edu/web/etc/login[.]php Credential Theft URL\n\ntraveloaid[.]com/css/js/[university]/auth[.]php Credential Theft URL\n\ntraveloaid[.]com/css/js/[university]/auth[.]php Credential Theft URL\n\noffthewallgraffiti[.]org/[university]/auth[.]php Credential Theft URL\n\ntraveloaid[.]com/css/js/[university]/auth[.]php Credential Theft URL\n\nsso[.]ucmo[.]edu[.]boring[.]cf/Covid19/authenticationedpoint.html Credential Theft URL\n\nsso2[.]astate[.]edu[.]boring[.]cf/login/authenticationedpoint.html Credential Theft URL\n\n242smarthome[.]com/[university]/auth.php Credential Theft URL\n\njass-butz[.]at/xx/main/main.php Credential Theft URL\n\nBluecollarsubs[.]com/main/ main.php Credential Theft URL\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
