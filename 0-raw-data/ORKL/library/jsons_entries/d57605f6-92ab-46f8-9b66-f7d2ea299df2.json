Our](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf)\ncontinued monitoring of BEC activities showed a consistent increase in numbers during\nthe year.\n\nFigure 1. Percentage of BEC detections from January to September 2021. Data from Trend Micro™\n\nSmart Protection Network™ (SPN).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe gradual increase throughout the year prompted us to pay attention to the campaigns\nbeing deployed, but the sudden increase in August caught our interest. Compared to\ncampaigns from previous years in which BEC actors mostly impersonated executives or\nranking management personnel, we observed a specific BEC campaign type spoofing\ngeneral employees’ display names. We noticed a sudden upshot of dangerous emails\nimpersonating and targeting ordinary employees for money transfers, bank payroll\naccount changes, or various company-related information. We launched the “BEC Display\nName Spoofing” detection solution for Trend Micro™ Cloud App Security in Q1 to\naddress this issue. Following this, we also observed the highest volume of BEC detections\nin the Americas.\n\nFigure 2. BEC display name spoofing detections by region from January to September 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. A BEC email sample spoofing the display name of an employee. The content of\n\nthe email translates as the sender asking help for a confidential financial operation and\n\ninquiring if the recipient is available for the day.\n\nBEC is an online scheme dependent on leveraging email and its features of convenience\nfor legitimate users, and we noted five major types of email channels that BEC actors use.\nAs we continue monitoring BEC operations, we also learned that BEC actors can use the\nsame channels and techniques for a longer period than for just one deployment\ncampaign, tracking complaints from different spoofed and scammed victims online. We\nalso took note of the patterns in keywords and domain names that they use to appear\nlegitimate to their potential victims, and what BEC email recipients can watch for when\nencountering these scams.\n\nTypes of email services used for BECWe analyzed the email services abused and the\ntechniques that BEC actors have adopted in their campaigns.\n\nFigure 4. Email services abused for BEC deployments\n\n1. Free email services\n\nWe observed BEC groups favoring the abuse of known free email services for the low-cost\nentry. There is also the trusted marketing quality and service promise of confidentiality in\nterms of protecting legitimate users, while bulk account creation tools can be used to\n\n\n-----\n\nfacilitate numerous accounts. We observed services offered by Gmail, Hotmail, and\nOutlook as the top choices for BEC campaigns.\n\nThese services allow BEC actors to spoof enterprise employees’ names or personal emails\nto use. In a typical case of this type of abuse, malicious actors spoof an employee email\naddress and request changes to payroll deposit bank accounts.\n\nFigure 5. BEC mail from AOL (top) and Gmail (bottom)\n\nWe observed a part of the BEC chief executive officer (CEO) email fraud scheme includes\nhaving a common account naming convention, such as “office”, “president”, “chief”, and\n“director”, among company leadership positions. Among all these free email services,\nGmail appears to be the most commonly abused service for BEC during our investigation\ntimeframe. We identified 10 commonly used examples:\n\n1. chiefexecutiveoffice <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n2. chiefexecutiveofficer <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n3. directorexecutiveofficer <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n4. officepresident <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n\n5. officepro <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n\n\n-----\n\n6. officeproject <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n\n7. officework <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n8. offshoreoffice <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n9. presidentoffice <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n10. rev.office <BLOCKED> [@]gmail.com\n\nMore often, BEC email content usually includes direct financial requests or transfers from\nthe intended victim. However, there are also indirect approaches wherein they first ask\nfor specific favors from the recipient. If the recipient replies, it indicates that the potential\nvictim believes that the sender is legitimate.\n\nFigure 6. BEC actor first asking for help\n\nFigure 7. BEC actor requesting the victim to buy a gift card after the user replies to their first email for\n\na favor\n\nWe also observed some of these BEC email addresses being active from just a couple of\ndays to years. For example, email account cexecutive9<BLOCKED>[@]gmail.com has\nbeen active for more than three years. We detected the address sending BEC emails in 1H\n2018, and continued to see the same email account actively sending BEC more than three\nyears later. We also noticed some users in social media complaining about an email scam\nreceived from the same address.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. A user posting about a scam email account on social media in 2019. We have been following\n\nthe said account since 2018, and observed it still being used to deploy campaigns in 2021.\n\n**2. Local email services**\n\nSome services provide local email services for end users. BEC actors also frequently use\nthese services (using either compromised credentials or making new ones) to launch BEC\nattacks. We observed more than 15 countries’ local email services with BEC email\nfootprints, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic,\nPoland, New Zealand, South Korea, Ukraine, Russia, Portugal, Australia, Norway, Italy,\nFrance, and Canada. Table 1 lists five of the email services and the BEC email sender\naccount that we detected:\n\n**Country** **Email service** **BEC email address**\n\nUnited Kingdom virginmedia.com officelink <BLOCKED> [@]virginmedia.com\n\nUnited States optimum.net ceo <BLOCKED> [@]optimum.net\n\nCzech Republic seznam.cz officeport <BLOCKED> [@]seznam.cz\n\nGermany mail.com officeonlyme <BLOCKED> [@]mail.com\n\nSouth Korea naver.com mail_ceoofficial <BLOCKED> [@]naver.com\n\nTable 1. Sample free email services and BEC email addresses used for campaigns\n\nWe observed BEC email actors also being interested in victim's contact information or\n[data from companies such as aging reports. They also try to get information from their](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bec-scammers-use-aging-report-phishing-to-find-new-targets/)\nvictims for other attacks that use social engineering.\n\n|Country|Email service|BEC email address|\n|---|---|---|\n|United Kingdom|virginmedia.com|officelink <BLOCKED> [@]virginmedia.com|\n|United States|optimum.net|ceo <BLOCKED> [@]optimum.net|\n|Czech Republic|seznam.cz|officeport <BLOCKED> [@]seznam.cz|\n|Germany|mail.com|officeonlyme <BLOCKED> [@]mail.com|\n|South Korea|naver.com|mail_ceoofficial <BLOCKED> [@]naver.com|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. BEC email asking for a user’s WhatsApp number\n\nFigure 10. BEC email asking for copies of a report and contact information\n\n**3. Encrypted email services**\n\nLike other cybercriminals, BEC actors also want to hide their footprints and prevent\nsystems from tracking them. Encrypted email services provide users with a higher level of\nprivacy and confidentiality (that is, the inclusion of other security features compared to\nother email services). We observed BEC actors using some encrypted email services and\nlist some examples below:\n\n**Encrypted email service** **Sample BEC email address**\n\nProtonmail officeiccon <BLOCKED> [@]protonmail.com\n\nTutanota eye.adimn <BLOCKED> [@]tutanota.com\n\nCriptext.com iphone <BLOCKED> [@]criptext.com\n\nTable 2. Sample encrypted email services used for BEC\n\nThese emails are not only found in the From email header, but at times also hidden in the\n_Reply-to section. A common trick in email scams like BECs involves forging the From_\nheader into something legitimate-looking and hide the actors’ actual email in a hidden\nReply-to.  When users directly reply just by clicking the in-mail Reply button, the Replyto header will automatically be the recipient email address. This is unknown to the victim\n\n|Encrypted email service|Sample BEC email address|\n|---|---|\n|Protonmail|officeiccon <BLOCKED> [@]protonmail.com|\n|Tutanota|eye.adimn <BLOCKED> [@]tutanota.com|\n|Criptext.com|iphone <BLOCKED> [@]criptext.com|\n\n\n-----\n\nand it allows the BEC actor to communicate with the victim thereafter. The example in\nFigure 11 shows how a BEC actor hides the actual email address ceoof<BLOCKED>\n\n[@]protonmail.com in the Reply-to section.\n\nFigure 11. BEC email hiding their inbox at Reply-to headers\n\n**4. Self-registered domains and direct-to featured email service**\n\nAside from using globally known email services, BEC actors also register domains\nthemselves. This can bring two benefits when they conduct attacks:\n\n1.    They can create look-alike domains to deceive victims. The actors register domains\nwith different characters but appear similar to a legitimate domain. Some commonly seen\ntricks include the interchange between specific letters and numbers:\n\nI (small letter L) – l (capital letter i) – 1 (for example, example.com vs. exampIe.com\nvs. examp1e.com)\no – 0 (for example, trendmicro.com vs. trendmicr0.com)\nd – cl (for example, trendmicro.com vs. trenclmicro.com)\nm – rn (for example, example.com vs. exarnple.com)\ni – j (for example, trendmicro.com vs. trendmjcro.com)\ng – q\nu– v\nw– vv\n\nOr the use of dashes (-) and periods (.) to separate a word or add a general postfix such as\ncountry codes (for example, example.com vs. example-tw.com). This trick is also widely\nused in other phishing schemes and other email-based scams, and will likely never get\nold.\n\n2.    Control positive email authentication results such as sender policy framework (SPF)\nor even DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) while sending email to victims.\n\nFigure 12. Abusing email authentication results\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile a SPF or DKIM pass does not indicate that an email is threat-free, it does provide\nan image that the sender is somehow legitimate, gaining the recipient’s trust or even fool\nsome anti-scam solutions.\n\n**5. Stolen email credentials and email conversations**\n\nBEC actors also launch attacks from compromised email accounts. In most instances\nusing this technique, the malicious actors deploy a spam campaign with malicious\n[attachments dropping keyloggers or trojan stealers like Lokibot, Fareit, backdoor](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/new-campaign-sees-lokibot-delivered-via-multiple-methods.html)\n[Remcos, and Negasteal (Agent Tesla). These can steal credentials in applications like](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/h/analysis-new-remcos-rat-arrives-via-phishing-email.html)\nbrowsers, simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), file transfer protocol (FTP), VPNs, and\nfrom computer and system information. The operators then harvest the credentials and\ntry to log in to the mailbox or webmail. If successful, they can manipulate the hacked\naccounts to perform BEC deployments.\n\nFrom the compromised email account, BEC actors can also find email conversations\nrelated to finance- or purchase-themed threads such as purchase orders or invoices.\nUsing these, they can create other spoofed email accounts, draft a reply with the stolen\nconversation, and start intercepting the conversation by replying to the recipients (usually\n[suppliers). These are also called man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks. In this case, BEC](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-defending-against-man-in-the-middle-attacks)\noperators carefully study the targeted victims, potentially compromising the companies’\nemail services. They will also look for unsuspecting suppliers or other involved recipients\nin the original email thread.\n\nMoreover, BEC operators use the username in the email resembling the victim’s name or\ncompany name simultaneous to the email spoofing. In a few cases we observed, the\nmalicious actors use customized usernames bearing the code “god” in their email,\nmarking the account as a carbon copy.\n\n<BLOCKED>mygod@mail.com\ngodpls<BLOCKED>@mail.com\n<BLOCKED>foods@post.com\n<BLOCKED>elco@dr.com\n<BLOCKED>pala@dr.com\n<BLOCKED>zado@dr.com\nnicola<BLOCKED>@dr.com\n<BLOCKED>com-int@dr.com\nire<BLOCKED>@asia.com\njulien<BLOCKED>@mail.com\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Sample BEC email with a stolen conversation used to deploy a BEC attack.\n\nThe BEC actors can rent virtual private servers (VPS) with SMTP and remote desktop\n[protocol (RDP) services. They can use email marketing software like Gammadyne Mailer](https://www.gammadyne.com/email_software.htm)\nto craft spam mails and send it to thousands of email addresses. These email addresses\n[are harvested via tools such as Email Extractor Lite, while some come from spam](https://www.lite14.us/)\nactivities. The actors can then review the stealer logs and identify mail servers of interest,\nwhich can contain conversations about purchasing orders. They can then hijack the email\nconversation, create spoofed emails, and use the conversation to deploy a BEC attack.\nAnother method employed involves the tampering of the invoice document to reflect the\nBEC actors’ bank account details. Thus, if there is a request for a wire transfer the money\nwill go directly into their account.\n\nKeyword use and naming patterns\n\nWe also observed some keywords or naming patterns that BEC actors generally use. We\nidentified some of them and provide examples for each.\n\n**1. Lengthy domain names with dashes (-)**\n\n\n-----\n\n[A group of BEC domains operating from Africa was observed to favor lengthy names,](https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/acid-agari-exaggerated-lion.pdf)\nusing new generic top-level domain (TLD) words such as “[.]management”, “[.]work”, or\n“[.]one”. Some domains also contain “-“ and with common keywords such as\n“management”, “mail”, “office”, “reply”, and “secure”. We list examples that we observed\nhere:\n\nadmin-office-mail-server-ssl0.management\nreply-netsuite-mails.management\nsystem-mail-protection-outlook.management\nreplys-mail-netsuite-com.management\nsysterm-proctection-outlook.management\nmails-officesslappssecure-serversportal-execs.management\nreply-workplace-secure-protection-management-office.one\nservermail-reply-office-works-secure-protecty-inbound-netsuite.one\noffice-xlsx-appspts-management-worksmailxls-cs.rest\noffice-mails-appsslz-workmail-management.work\n\nFigure 14. A BEC email using lengthy keywords and dashes\n\n**2. The use of telecom keywords**\n\nWe also noticed BEC actors registering domain names with telecommunications industryrelated keywords such as “5g”, “4g”, “mobile”, “network”, and “wireless”. They\noccasionally include names of service providers such as “Verizon” and “T-Mobile.” It’s\nalso common to see dashes in domain names to increase the diversity of choices while\nregistering:\n\n5g-verizou.com\nnetwork-sprint.biz\nsprint-mobile.net\nmobile-celldata.online.\nverizon-private-wireless.com\nreply-tmobile.com\ntmobilecellular.space\n5g-tmobile.com\nt-mobile4g-us.com\n\n\n-----\n\nverizone4g-device.com\n\nFigure 15. A BEC email using telecom-related domains\n\nWhen we tracked “TELE-COMM” naming BEC domains’ email infrastructure (observed\nfrom the domain name system mail exchanger or DNS MX records), we checked several\ncommercial email services such as Google Workspace (aspmx.l.google.com) and\nTitan[.]email. These commercial email services provide advanced features like email\ntracking, scheduled sending, and follow-up reminders, and it is highly likely that BEC\noperators also optimize their operations’ flow in leveraging these services.\n\nFigure 16. Email services like Titan provide advanced features for tracking the progress of emails sent\n\nBelow is an example of a BEC email initiating a conversation, wherein spaces are inserted\nin between words in the subject line. The word “INVOICE” is replaced with “I\nNVOICE” to evade anti-scam email solutions that rely on keywords or regular\nexpressions. Similar tricks have been observed in sextortion and phishing email schemes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. A BEC email sender using separate words or letters in the subject line.\n[Screenshot sourced from VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8fd44022599427d1f3b4e83c42451b7823df34d39e09e33dbe2ff24747971361)\n\nConclusion\n\n[Unlike other cybercriminal schemes, phishing and BEC scams can be tricky to detect as](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/best-practices-identifying-and-mitigating-phishing-attacks)\nthey are targeted toward specific recipients. Attackers seek to compromise email accounts\nto gain access to financial and other sensitive information related to business operations,\nand BEC actors can easily use such access and information for other illicit activities. In\nthe sample routines discussed here, the attackers’ emails themselves do not include the\ntypical malware payload of malicious attachments. As a result, traditional security\nsolutions will not be able to protect accounts and systems from such attacks.\n\nFrom our observations, BEC attacks don’t only target high-profile users but also any\nemployee that can be found on social media networks with significant personal\ninformation published (such as LinkedIn). These pieces of information can be used to\nspoof employees and partners, and cause significant financial damage to businesses.\n\nAs we observed professional email services being used for BEC attacks, we believe BEC\nactors will keep adopting new services and tools to optimize their operations flow as email\nservices try to optimize services for their legitimate users. Targets in the Americas and\nEurope will continue to be targeted as sources of profit for these scams and will likely\ncontinue as companies see remote work becoming more mainstream, whether it be for\ntheir own operations or their managed service providers’ (MSPs).  Companies and\nemployees will have to keep their guard up to mitigate the risks from BEC and other\nemail-based scams:\n\nEducate and train employees. Deflect company intrusions through continuous\nInfoSec education. All company personnel — from the CEO to rank-and-file\nemployees — must be aware of the various techniques and kinds of scams, and the\nprocedure to follow when they encounter an attack attempt.\n\n\n-----\n\nConfirm requests using other channels. Avoid clicking on embedded links or\ndirectly replying to the email addresses used in the email. Exercise caution by\nfollowing a verification system among employees who handle sensitive information,\nsuch as multiple personnel sign-off or additional verification protocols.\n**Scrutinize all emails. Be wary of irregular emails with suspicious content such as**\nunknown and dubious sender emails, domain names, writing styles, and urgent\nrequests. Report suspicious emails to the respective security and InfoSec teams for\nanalysis, tracking, and blocking.\n\nTrend Micro solutions\n\nTrend Micro protects both small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises against\nphishing- and BEC-related emails. Using enhanced machine learning combined with\n[expert rules, Trend Micro™ Email Security solution analyzes both the header and the](https://www.trendmicro.com/zh_hk/business/products/user-protection/sps/email-and-collaboration/email-security.html)\ncontent of an email to stop BEC and other email threats. For source verification and\nauthentication, it uses Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail\n(DKIM), and Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance\n(DMARC).\n\n[The Trend Micro™ Cloud App Security solution enhances the security of Microsoft Office](https://www.trendmicro.com/zh_hk/business/products/user-protection/sps/email-and-collaboration/cloud-app-security.html)\n365 and other cloud services through sandbox malware analysis for BEC and other\nadvanced threats. It uses Writing Style DNA, Display Name Spoofing, and High-Profile\ndomain to detect BEC impersonations and computer vision to find credential-stealing\n[phishing sites with Advanced Spam Protection enabled. It also protects cloud file sharing](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/cloud-app-security-online-help/advanced-threat-prot_001/adding-atp-policies/advanced-spam-protec.aspx)\nfrom threats and data loss by controlling sensitive data usage.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n[For the full list of IOCs, you may download the text file here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/j/analyzing-email-services-abused-for-business-email-compromise/IOCs-analyzing-email-services-abused-for-BEC.txt)\n\n\n-----",
