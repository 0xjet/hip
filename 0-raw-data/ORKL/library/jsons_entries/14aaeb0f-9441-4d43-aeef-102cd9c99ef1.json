Over\nthe next months, in the harsh Ukrainian winter, opposition protests escalated and\nturned bloody. The ensuing turmoil included a runaway President, Russian occupa­\ntion of Crimea and an armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe world held its breath and many expected to see a full-fledged ‘cyber war’.\nHowever, although an increase in typical cyber skirmishes was reported throughout\nthe crisis, prominent cyber operations with destructive effects have not yet occurred.\nThe possible reasons for this seemingly low-level employment of cyber attacks in\nUkraine characterise the particular role of cyber operations in modern conflicts.\n\nThe case of Ukraine proves that the use of cyber operations has to be understood\nin the wider strategic context. In Ukraine we saw – in line with national doctrine –\nthat Russian information warfare both included and relied upon cyber elements.\nReported cyber incidents such as defacements, information leaks or DDoS attacks\nagainst media or governmental organisations were predominantly in support of the\nintense Russian information operation against Ukraine and the West.\n\nFurthermore, due to the historical interconnectedness of networks and sophisti­\ncated spyware tools applied by APT groups, it is widely presumed that Russia is actively\nleveraging the intelligence provided by its effective cyber espionage campaigns for\nstrategic gain. As cyberspace functions as the main medium for disseminating and\ngathering information, destructive cyber operations hindering information flows in\nUkraine would have been unreasonable from the Russian point of view.\n\nAnother strategic consideration affecting Russian use of cyber attacks is the rel­\native effectiveness of traditional kinetic operations. If we look at the Russian actions\nin Crimea and the Donbass, there was no practical need to engage in destructive\n\n\n-----\n\noffensive cyber operations to achieve the military objectives. For instance, one of the\nfirst targets during the occupation of Crimea was an Internet Exchange Point, which\nwas taken over by Russian special forces in order to assure information superiority\nby disrupting cable connections with the mainland. In short, the case indicates that\nkinetic actions might in some circumstances be more effective and less costly than\nsophisticated cyber operations. This factor is even more relevant in Ukraine, where\nthe infrastructure is often outdated and not highly IT-dependent.\n\nEven though highly visible and destructive attacks have not been reported, infor­\nmation-oriented cyber operations in Ukraine have nevertheless functioned as an\nessential strategic element of Russian whole spectrum warfare.\n\nIn brief, the book reflects several mutually reinforcing reasons why we did not\nwitness large-scale or massive cyber attacks with destructive effects:\n\n  - Espionage and information campaigns conducted through cyberspace\n\ntrumped other considerations for the Russian side;\n\n  - It is reasonable to achieve results with less resources and effort involved,\n\ni.e. if a cable can be cut physically, there is no need to use sophisticated\ncyber attacks;\n\n  - Both sides in the conflict have shown a considerable ability to control\n\nthe escalation of the conflict. The cyber domain did not witness largescale warfighting, but neither did the domain of air after the tragedy of\nMH17;\n\n  - Ukraine did not offer very lucrative targets for destructive cyber\n\nattacks.\n\nTo put these points into perspective: modern war is a messy affair, not a clean\nand glittery Hollywood movie. The emergence of cyber as a separate domain of\nwarfighting does not necessarily offer magic solutions and miraculous short-cuts to\nachieve strategic goals. As of November 2015, the case has shown that destructive\ncyber operations are not (yet) a silver bullet in the arsenal of states which still oper­\nate below certain thresholds due to legal and political considerations and uncer­\ntainties over escalation. Nevertheless, we have to keep in mind that the conflict in\nUkraine is not yet over – the level and nature of cyber attacks can change rapidly, as\nthe political-military environment in Ukraine remains unstable and unpredictable.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the often unclear debate on so-called ‘hybrid warfare’\nand its cyber elements, this publication offers a ‘reality check’ for policy-makers,\nscholars and the media to understand the ‘haze’ of cyber war. This is done by apply­\ning an interdisciplinary approach as our book involves 17 subject-matter experts\nanalysing the strategic, policy, legal and technical aspects of the case.\n\nThe NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence would like to thank\nall of the book’s authors, and especially the editor, Centre Ambassador Kenneth\nGeers, for their contributions to the project.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Events\n\nTimeframe Geopolitical Events\n2013–2014\n\n\nNovember 2013 –\nFebruary 2014\n\n27 February –\n16 March\n\n\nUkrainian President Yanukovych’s cabinet rejects the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, ig­\nniting anti-government protests in Kyiv. Demonstrations gather pace in January and February\nof 2014 and culminate when clashes between protesters and government turn deadly. As a\nresult, Yanukovich flees to Russia and the Parliament names Turchynov as interim President.\n\nOn February 27, pro-Russian gunmen in combat uniforms – dubbed ‘little green men’ – oc­\ncupy Crimea and seize strategic sites. On March 16, 97% of voters reportedly back Crimea’s\nunrecognised referendum to join Russia. The EU and US agree on a first round of sanctions\nagainst Russia; several rounds follow as the crisis progresses.\n\n\nApril – May Armed conflict begins in eastern Ukraine. The first casualties between pro-Russian separatists\nand Ukrainian government forces are reported on April 17. Unrecognised referendums are\nheld. Separatists declare independence in Donetsk and Luhansk on May 11.\n\n25 May Petro Poroshenko is elected President of Ukraine.\n\n17 June Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur is shot down over eastern\nUkraine, leaving nearly 300 dead. Shortly after the crash, the Security Service (SBU) of Ukraine\nreleases an intercepted phone call purportedly between separatists in eastern Ukraine, discuss­\ning the fact that they shot down the plane.\n\nSeptember The Minsk Protocol is signed by representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the Do­\nnetsk People’s Republic, and the Lugansk People’s Republic. A ceasefire agreement fails to stop\nfighting in Donbass as fierce fighting for Donetsk’s airport erupts.\n\n26 October Parliamentary elections are held: Poroshenko’s Bloc wins and pro-western parties dominate the\nnew political landscape.\n\n2015\n\n\nJanuary –\nFebruary\n\n\nThe Minsk Protocol ceasefire fails as heavy fighting continues. After weeks of fighting, on 22\nJanuary, Ukrainian forces withdraw from the main terminal of the strategically important Do­\nnetsk airport.\n\nOn February 11, new talks start in Minsk to achieve a new peace deal. Parties agree to a pullout of heavy weaponry, but sporadic clashes continue. After heavy fighting in Debaltseve,\nUkrainian forces retreat on 18 February.\n\n\nMarch The UN reports that an estimated 6,000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since 2014.\n\n\nAugust –\nSeptember\n\n\nThe most recent ceasefire, agreed by the contact group in late August, appears to be holding, as\nfighting is at its lowest point since the beginning of the conflict.\n\n\n-----\n\nProminent Cyber Incidents[1]\n\n\nSporadic cyber skirmishes, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and website deface**ments, accompany events throughout the crisis. Prominent examples include Russia Today’s (RT) altered**\nheadlines with the word ‘Nazi’ added and DDoS attacks against the NATO and NATO CCD COE websites, which are briefly taken offline during the Euromaidan protests.\n\nPrivate sector reports announce that **advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber espionage tools have**\nbeen discovered in Ukraine and in NATO countries. Malware analysis suggests that the campaigns are\nbased in Russia. New and more menacing forms of malware include Turla/Uroburos/Snake, RedOctober,\nMiniDuke, and NetTraveler.\n\nAnonymous users or hacktivist groups such as CyberBerkut continuously leak stolen, sensitive infor**mation. For example, on February 4 2014, a phone call between the US Assistant Secretary of State and**\nthe US Ambassador to Ukraine, which includes derisive comments regarding the EU, is uploaded to\nYouTube.\n\nAt the Euromaidan street demonstrations, there are physical and cyber attacks against opposition servers,\nsmartphones, websites, and Internet accounts; the most serious incidents coincide with the lethal shooting of protestors.\n\nDuring the occupation of Crimea, Russian special forces seize an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) and sever Internet cables. According to Ukrainian intelligence, an ‘IP-telephonic’ attack originating from Crimea\ntargets the mobile devices of Ukrainian parliament members. Hackers also leak stolen data, including a\nbugged phone call between the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the EU, which fuels conspiracy\ntheories and appears to support the Russian narrative regarding sniper shootings at Euromaidan.\n\nUkrainian officials report a sophisticated cyber attack against the Ukrainian Central Election Commission on May 21-25 2014. DDoS attacks impede information exchange. A computer virus is launched to\nundermine the credibility of the elections and presents false election results to the official election website.\nSpecialists contain the virus, but the Russian TV station Channel One nonetheless airs the fake results.\n\nMedia reports describe a ‘troll factory’ in St. Petersburg, Russia, where hundreds of people are allegedly\n**creating pro-Russian government content for both domestic and international social media.** This\nanalysis highlights the active use of social media as a prominent threat vector for information operations.\n\nA private sector report claims that a Russian cyber espionage campaign has targeted the MH17 investigation being conducted by Dutch, Malaysian, Australian, Belgian, and Ukrainian authorities.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, signals intelligence (SIGINT) operations make use of Internet data (e.g. location\ndata from mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks) to locate and target Ukrainian military forces. Hacktivists\non both sides continue to leak sensitive or compromising data to support their cause. In one case, hackers\naccess public CCTV cameras in eastern Ukraine. The region has been isolated from the rest of Ukraine\nvia Internet censorship and regular forensics checks on citizens’ computers and mobile devices.\n\n1 This event overview is not exhaustive and includes prominent incidents;\nit is based on open source reports and information provided by this book’s authors.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 1\n\n Introduction:\n Cyber War in Perspective\n\n##### Kenneth Geers\n\n_NATO CCD COE[1] / Atlantic Council /_\n_Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv_\n\nCyber war is a hot topic. Armed forces, intelligence, and law enforcement agen­\ncies have made computer security – from defence to offence – a top priority for\ninvestment and recruitment. In fact, current efforts to take the higher ground in\ncyberspace are so intense that many governments will overreach, with unfortunate\nramifications for democracy and human rights around the world.\n\nThe current Russo-Ukrainian conflict appears to have all the necessary ingre­\ndients for cyber war. Moscow and Kyiv, and indeed the entire NATO Alliance, are\nplaying for the highest geopolitical stakes. Russia has already annexed Crimea, and\nthere is an ongoing military standoff in eastern Ukraine. Both countries possess a\nhigh level of expertise in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM),\nwhich has naturally led to an aptitude for, and experience with, computer hacking.\n\nDespite these factors, there are still\nmany sceptics over cyber war, and more _Can cyber attacks offer sol­_\nquestions than answers. Although\n\n##### diers more than a temporary,\n\nmalicious code has served criminals\nand spies very well, can cyber attacks _tactical edge on the battlefield?_\noffer soldiers more than a temporary,\ntactical edge on the battlefield? Can it have a strategic effect? What norms should be\nestablished in international relations to govern nation-state hacking in peacetime\nand in war?\n\n1 Dr Kenneth Geers was a Scientist at NATO CCD COE in 2007–2011 and now holds the position of Centre Ambassador.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis book serves as a benchmark in the early history of Internet-era warfare. For\nworld leaders and system administrators alike, the ‘cyber dimension’ of the Ukraine\ncrisis offers many lessons and sheds light on whether cyber war is still closer to sci­\nence fiction than reality. The research is divided into five sections: Strategic Frame­\nwork, Tactical Viewpoints, Information Warfare, Policy and Law, and The Future.\nEach chapter has been written by a leading expert in national security, network\nsecurity, or both. It has been a pleasure and an honour to work with all of them.\nMany thanks to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Cooperative Cyber Defence\nCentre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE) for sponsoring this research.\n\n_Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine opens with a chap­_\nter by Russia scholar Keir **Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in Oxford,**\nUK. Keir offers deep insight into the background to this crisis, and explains why\nit may not be resolved any time soon. Russia and the West are said to have two\ndistinct views of the world. Moscow is unlikely to tolerate true independence and\nsovereignty for its former Soviet satellite states, and remains vehemently opposed\nto Western support for them. It has many strategies and tactics – traditional and\ncyber – that it can employ against Ukraine and its other neighbours, while the West\nis both hesitant and divided.\n\nIn Chapter 3, James J. Wirtz, Dean of the Naval Postgraduate School in Califor­\nnia, describes the global context surrounding these events. Today, nation-states are\nintegrating cyber tactics into their political and military strategies. Professor Wirtz\nposits that when it comes to the use of cyber, ‘national styles’ might be emerging as\nstates attempt to use cyber capabilities to achieve strategic objectives. He suggests\nthat it is wrong to treat cyber attacks as a silver bullet, and that it is better to consider\nhow a sort of combined arms approach will prevail. On a positive note, the need\nfor legal and bureaucratic integration of policies and programmes should produce\nnational idiosyncrasies on the cyber battlefield that can help with the vexing chal­\nlenge of attribution.\n\n**James Andrew Lewis of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies**\n(CSIS) analyses the geopolitical effects of cyber attacks in Chapter 4. He discusses\ntwo metrics: strategic effects that diminish an opponent’s will or capacity to fight\n(e.g. influencing public opinion) and tactical effects that degrade military power\n(e.g. confusing troops, or denying service to weapons). Success is premised upon\nobservable, real-world effects. In Ukraine, Russian cyber operations had no strate­\ngic effect and only a limited, short-term political effect.\n\nIn Chapter 5, RAND’s Martin Libicki takes one of this book’s strongest stances.\nHe asks why, despite the existence of a hot military conflict and ample hacker tal­\nent, there is _no cyber war_ in Ukraine. There have been hacktivist outbursts, web\ndefacements, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and cyber espionage,\nbut everything we have seen so far falls well short of how national security thinkers\n– and Hollywood – have portrayed cyber war. Libicki explores several possible rea­\nsons. Does Ukraine not possess cyber-enabled critical infrastructures? Are Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nand Ukraine wary of taking (or escalating) their conflict into the cyber domain? Or\nare our notions of cyber war simply overrated?\n\n**Nikolay Koval, head of Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team**\n(CERT-UA) during the revolution, describes in Chapter 6 how cyber attacks rose in\nparallel with ongoing political events, in both number and severity. In 2012, hackers\n‘defaced’ Ukrainian government websites with politically motivated digital graffiti.\nIn 2013, network defenders discovered new and more menacing forms of malware,\nsuch as RedOctober, MiniDuke, and NetTraveler. In 2014, hacktivist groups such as\n_CyberBerkut published stolen Ukrainian Government documents. Koval analyses_\nin detail the most technically advanced attack investigated by CERT-UA: the May\n2014 compromise of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission (CEC). He closes by\nappealing to the Ukrainian Government to allocate greater funds to hire and retain\nqualified personnel.\n\nIn Chapter 7, ISACA Kyiv researcher Glib Pakharenko has written a first-hand\naccount of cyber attacks during the revolution in Ukraine. At the EuroMaidan street\ndemonstrations, there were physical and logical attacks against opposition servers,\nsmartphones, websites, and Internet accounts; the most serious incidents coincided\nwith the lethal shooting of protestors. In Crimea, attacks ranged from severing net­\nwork cables to commandeering satellites to wholesale changes in Wikipedia. In east­\nern Ukraine, cyber espionage such as the use of location data from mobile phones\nand Wi-Fi networks has aided in targeting Ukrainian army units; the region has also\nbeen isolated from the rest of Ukraine by Internet censorship and regular forensics\nchecks on citizens’ computers and mobile devices. Pakharenko ends this chapter by\nproviding the Ukrainian Government with a significant ‘to do’ list of best practices\nin network security.\n\nFireEye’s Jen Weedon, in Chapter 8, discusses Russia’s strategic use of computer\nnetwork exploitation (i.e. cyber espionage). Today, via the Internet, intelligence\nagencies can gather information on an industrial scale, which can be used for any\npurpose, including tactical support to military operations. From a targeting per­\nspective, Weedon discusses strategies for creating a decisive information advantage,\n‘prepping’ a battlefield through denial and deception, and how hackers might even\ncause real-world physical destruction; and details the technical aspects of suspected\nRussian cyber operations, including malware samples, hacker tactics, and compro­\nmised infrastructure.\n\nIn Chapter 9, Tim Maurer of the New America Foundation explores the role\nthat non-state, ‘proxy’ cyber actors have played in the Ukraine crisis. In both Russia\nand Ukraine, there is ample private sector computer hacking expertise which each\ngovernment would theoretically have an incentive to exploit for efficacy and plau­\nsible deniability. However, throughout this crisis, there has counterintuitively been\nvery limited proxy use. There have been a few dubious ‘hacktivist’ attacks, but expert\nvolunteers and cyber criminals do not appear to have been politicised or mobil­\nised to any significant degree in support of geopolitical cyber campaigns. Criminal\n\n\n-----\n\nbehaviour remains largely profit-driven. In particular, the Ukrainian Government\nhas not shown a capacity to harness volunteer cyber expertise, as Russia is thought\nto have done during its previous crises with Estonia and Georgia.\n\nSwedish Defence University researcher Margarita Levin Jaitner highlights cur­\n\nrent Russian Information Warfare (IW) the­\n\n##### Moscow has an inherent ory in Chapter 10. She contends that Moscow\n\nhas an inherent belief in the power of infor­\n\n##### belief in the power of\n\nmation control to advance its political and\n\n##### information control. military goals. In Russian doctrine, cyber\n\nsecurity is subordinate to information secu­\nrity, and cyberspace is only one part of the ‘information space’. National security\nplanners are concerned with both ‘technical’ and ‘cognitive’ attacks, and recognise\nthat achieving information superiority involves everything from propaganda to\nhacking to kinetic military operations. Margarita Jaitner argues that the annexation\nof Crimea was a textbook case in information superiority.\n\nIn Chapter 11, **Liisa Past, a NATO CCD COE expert on strategic communi­**\ncations, analyses leadership discourse. Liisa Past reveals that Russian President\nVladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko have employed similar\nrhetorical strategies, including the development of an ‘us vs. them’ dichotomy in\nwhich the in-group is portrayed as constructive and solution-oriented, while the\nout-group is illegitimate and dangerous. In their current conflict, neither Russia nor\nUkraine denies that cyberspace is a domain of warfare, but neither has stressed its\nimportance. Russian political discourse has mostly overlooked cyber issues (which\nis in line with Russian military doctrine), while Ukraine has framed them within the\nlarger concept of ‘hybrid warfare’. The most notable difference in political rhetoric is\nKyiv’s clear orientation to the West and NATO, while Moscow is keenly focused on\nRussian national interests.\n\n**Elina Lange-Ionatamishvili and Sanda Svetoka of the NATO Strategic Com­**\nmunications Centre of Excellence in Latvia, in Chapter 12, discuss the role of social\nmedia in this conflict. In the Internet era, the battle for hearts and minds has never\nbeen more important. Social media is a trust-based network that provides fertile soil\nfor intelligence collection, propaganda dissemination, and psychological operations\n(PSYOPS) to influence public opinion – or to lead adversaries into harm’s way. ‘Soft’\ncyber attacks can be as severe as any attack on critical infrastructure. In Ukraine,\nthey have generated fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the economic, cultural, and\nnational security of Ukraine, while promoting positive messages about Russia’s role\nin Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The authors provide recommendations for defence\nagainst such attacks, including how to identify them, challenge them, and how to\ndevelop a resilient political narrative to withstand false propaganda.\n\nIn Chapter 13, University of Michigan doctoral student Nadiya Kostyuk reviews\nUkraine’s cyber security policy – past, present, and future. She analyses numerous\nhistorical factors that make Ukraine a cyber safe haven: a strong science, technol­\n\n\n-----\n\nogy, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, underwhelming economic\nperformance since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and social norms which\ndictate that stealing from the West is not a bad thing. The icing on the cake is that\nthere are currently few cyber security regulations in Ukraine. All of these factors\nshed light on the vexing challenge of containing cyber crime in the region. Look­\ning toward the future, Nadiya Kostyuk argues that Ukraine’s political, military, and\neconomic crises will inhibit the stabilisation of Ukrainian cyberspace for some time.\n\nLt Col Jan Stinissen of the NATO CCD COE, in Chapter 14, offers a legal frame­\nwork for cyber operations in Ukraine. He explains that international law applies\nto cyberspace, and the law of armed conflict applies to all relevant cyber opera­\ntions. Jan discusses the legal definitions of ‘war’ and ‘cyberwar’, as well as the con­\ncepts of ‘armed conflict’, ‘armed attack’, and ‘use of force’. Typically, cyber attacks do\nnot come in isolation, but rather as one element of a larger military operation; the\nwider context will determine the legal framework for its cyber component. There\nare many qualifying factors including state vs. non-state actor, and armed conflict\nvs. law enforcement. In the Ukraine crisis, operations in Crimea (which has already\nbeen annexed by Russia) may be viewed differently from those in eastern Ukraine.\nStinissen asserts that, globally, most known cyber attacks have simply not been seri­\nous enough to be governed by the law of armed conflict, but that this is likely to\nchange in the future.\n\nIn Chapter 15, NATO CCD COE researcher Henry Rõigas discusses the impact\nof known cyber attacks in Ukraine on proposed political cyber ‘norms’, the rules of\nstate behaviour in international relations. On the positive side, the absence of attacks\nagainst critical infrastructure could be a boon to future international security and\nstability, especially if it is a result of intentional restraint on the part of Moscow and\nKyiv. This case challenges the prevailing perception that a loose normative frame­\nwork currently allows states to employ cyber attacks as a tool for coercion. On the\nnegative side, the examples of computer network operations we have seen appear to\nviolate the information security norms promoted by Russia and the Shanghai Coop­\neration Organisation (SCO), as they seem to constitute a war on information itself,\nthat is a dedicated effort to alter public opinion through deceptive propaganda.\n\nFinnish Professor **Jarno Limnéll, in Chapter 16, discusses the ramifications**\nof the Ukraine war, and its cyber component, for Russia’s neighbours. Moscow’s\naggressive behaviour in Ukraine has forced many countries to re-evaluate their\npolitical and military relationships, especially with NATO. For historical reasons,\nFinland and Estonia are well positioned to analyse Russia’s use of hybrid warfare,\nincluding information operations. Today, these countries are actively pursuing ways\nto bolster their national defences against Russia’s military strategies and tactics in\nUkraine. The NATO Alliance should take concrete measures to reassure its member\nstates, such as the creation of a common cyber defence framework.\n\nIn Chapter 17, **Jason Healey** and Michelle Cantos of Columbia University\nimagine four potential cyber conflict scenarios in this crisis.

After a period where this confrontation lay relatively\ndormant, the conflict in Ukraine results from the culmination of two important trends\nin the Russian view of itself and the world: first, a greater and more urgent perception\nof threat, whether real or imagined, to Russia’s own security; and second, a recognition\nthat Russia itself has regained sufficient strength, military and otherwise, to assert itself.\n\nThe notion that Russia is faced with an existential threat – even when that threat\nis imperceptible from outside Russia – has multiple and complex origins. Some of\nthese are permanent and persistent; for example, the idea of vulnerability of Russia’s\nborders, which leads to the conviction that in order to protect its borders Russia must\nexert control far beyond them. In the last century this was one of the drivers for Soviet\nultimatums to the Baltic states and Finland which eventually led to their invasion in\n1939. This continuing perception feeds into the current portrayal by Russia of NATO\nenlargement, including to those same Baltic states, as a threat. Regardless of NATO’s\nintent, it presents a menace simply by ‘approaching Russia’s borders’.[1]\n\n1 As expressed in a wide range of Russian security policy documents, including the December 2014 ‘Military Doctrine of the\nRussian Federation’ and its predecessors.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther, more recent developments have heightened the sense of urgency for\nRussian security planners. The fear that the West is considering bringing about\nregime change in Russia does not stand up to objective scrutiny, but appears\n\ndeep-rooted among a broad sec­\n\n##### Recent developments have tor of the Russian security elite.

Western\naction in Libya and support for anti-government rebels in Syria provide prime\nexamples.\n\nThus the prospect of destabilisation closer to home in Ukraine would have\nbeen of even more acute and direct concern in Moscow. Even without the\naccompanying disorder, the threat of the ‘loss’ of Ukraine to the West posed\nan immediate military problem: it appears to have been considered plausible in\nMoscow that this presented an immediate danger of losing the Black Sea Fleet’s\nbase in Sevastopol, together with the often-overlooked supporting infrastruc­\nture scattered across the Crimean peninsula, to NATO. According to Secretary\nof the Russian Security Council Nikolay Patrushev, the consequences could be\neven more far-reaching: ‘Americans are trying to involve the Russian Federation\nin interstate military conflict, to facilitate the change of power by way of using\nthe events in Ukraine, and ultimately to carve up our country.’[2] Whether this\nview is sincerely held by the Russian leadership or not, it is the one that is con­\nsistently presented to the Russian public, and to its Armed Forces, as explaining\nthe roots of the current conflict.\n\nThe fact that Russia was able to use large numbers of Special Operations Forces\n(SOF) swiftly and effectively to seize control of Crimea, and subsequently to wage\nan ongoing low-level campaign in eastern Ukraine involving long-term mobilisa­\ntion of its conventional forces, is a pointer to the other key element of the new Rus­\nsian approach to confrontation; the recognition that Russia is now in a position to\nexercise a much more assertive foreign policy than in the recent past.\n\nOne element of this is the unprecedented and expensive overhaul and rear­\nmament of Russia’s Armed Forces which began after the armed conflict with\nGeorgia in 2008 and continues today. The fact that the Russian troops at work\nin Ukraine are entirely unrecognisable from the forces which entered Georgia\njust seven years earlier caused surprise and consternation among those Western\ndefence communities that had not been paying attention. But the Ukraine cam­\npaign overall is far more than a military operation. Successful coordination of\nmilitary movements and action with other measures in the political, economic\nand especially information domains, are the result of strenuous efforts by the\n\n2 Interview with Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev, Rossiyskaya gazeta, 11 February 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nPutin administration over preceding years to harness other levers of state power\nto act in a coordinated manner.[3]\n\nThe results of this coordination has left the unprepared West scrambling for a\nresponse, and struggling even to define the phenomenon, as witness the tortuous\nattempts by NATO and Western governments to decide what precisely constitutes\n‘hybrid warfare’. But the notion of hybridity as applied to the current concept\nmeets little understanding in Moscow. Instead, Russia can be said simply to be\nattempting to implement grand strategy in the classical sense. Russia’s attempt\nat this whole of government approach to managing conflict is embodied in the\nNational Defence Control Centre in central Moscow, where a wide range of dif­\nferent government ministries and agencies including those responsible for energy,\nthe economy, ecology and more are brought together under the leadership of the\nGeneral Staff.[4]\n\nIntensive militarisation, sometimes referred to directly as mobilisation, is also\nnow pervading Russian society, stoked by unending leadership rhetoric of war, con­\nfrontation and threat, and blanket military coverage on TV. According to Estonian\nAmbassador to the Russian Federation Jüri Luik, the Russian narrative of war is\n‘instrumentalising the population and\nputting it on a mental war footing’, not\n\n##### The notion of hybridity meets\n\nonly by tapping into the traditional\n\n##### little understanding in Moscow.\n\nRussian narrative of victimhood over\ncenturies, but also by engendering ‘a\nheroic feeling that now is the time of risk’.[5] Furthermore, analysis of Russian security\nthinking shows not only this asymmetry of threat perception, but also a complete\ndivergence with the West in terms of notions of how and when the military should\nbe used to counter those threats.\n\nAs so often, there is no single explanation for a given course of action by Russia,\nand direct intervention in Crimea and Ukraine has also been parsed as a response\nto the threat posed to Russian business interests by closer integration with the\nEuropean Union (EU). The EU model of open markets and rules-based dealings\nruns directly counter to the Russian way of doing business in the near abroad,\nreinforcing the growing Russian perception of the EU as a problem rather than an\nopportunity; but few analysts would have predicted that it would be the prospect\nof an EU Association Agreement for Ukraine, rather than any involvement with\nNATO, which would eventually lead to military intervention by Russia.\n\nThe ambivalent attitude to Ukraine as a sovereign nation with a right to choose\nits own foreign policy direction has its roots in an entirely different view of the end\n\n3 Andrew Monaghan. ‘Defibrillating the Vertikal’, Chatham House, October 2014, http://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/\ndefibrillating-vertikal-putin-and-russian-grand-strategy.\n4 ‘Начальник российского Генштаба рассказал журналистам о задачах и роли Национального центра по управлению\nобороной РФ’, Russian Ministry of Defence website, 1 November 2014, http://function.mil.ru/news_page/country/more.ht­\nm?id=11998309@egNews.\n5 Speaking at the Lennart Meri Conference, Tallinn, 24 April 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nof the Soviet Union. That view holds that the former Soviet republics, including\nUkraine and the Baltic States, in effect belong to Russia. According to President\nPutin, in 1991 ‘Russia voluntarily – I emphasise – voluntarily and consciously made\nabsolutely historic concessions in giving up its own territory’.[6] This persistent view\nis not limited to President Putin. According to veteran scholar of Russia Paul Goble:\n\n_‘The Russian elite is sincerely convinced that the preservation of influence_\n_on the former Soviet republics surrounding it is the status quo and a nat­_\n_ural right given by history,’ even though ‘for the entire rest of the world_\n_such an approach is incomprehensible and unnatural’._\n\nWhat this means is that Moscow acts ‘as if the Soviet Union had not fallen apart,\nas if it had only been reformatted, but relations between sovereign and vassal have\nremained as before’.[7] It is plain that at least in some sectors of society, these aspi­\nrations by Russia to regain imperial dominion over its surroundings enjoy broad\nsupport. The now-celebrated Prosecutor General of Crimea, Natalya Poklonskaya,\nin an interview at the time of annexation declared her ambition to ‘start again in a\ngreat state, a great power, an empire, like Russia’.[8]\n\nThis approach to Russia’s inheritance of domination over its neighbourhood\n\n\n##### Informed analysis pointed\n to Ukraine as the next target for Russian action.\n\n\nappears consistent over time.

From the earliest stages, this was reflected in huge budget increases for\nthe Armed Forces,[12] and an intensified pattern of testing levers of influence against\nWestern neighbours.[13] High-profile incidents during this stage included gas cut-offs\nfor Ukraine in 2006, the crude cyber offensive against Estonia in May 2007, and\nultimately the use of military force against Georgia in 2008. In each case, the results\nvalidated this approach for Russia: the Georgian conflict in particular demonstrated\nthe validity of use of armed force as a foreign policy tool bringing swift and effective\nresults, with only limited and temporary economic and reputational costs to bear.\n\nIt was in this context that a range of informed analysis pointed to Ukraine as the next\ntarget for assertive Russian action. A UK parliamentary report in 2009 noted that:\n\n_‘Many of our witnesses stressed that Russia poses a military threat to_\n_other former Soviet states, particularly in light of its actions in Georgia..._\n_Some witnesses argued that Russia posed a military threat to Ukraine..._\n_one scenario was that Putin could send in military forces to secure the_\n_Russian military base at Sevastopol’.[14]_\n\n##### 2 Is This Cyber Warfare?\n\nAs noted above, the levers of power which Russia is bringing to bear in Ukraine are\nwide-ranging. This study looks in detail at the specific cyber conflict aspect of the\nUkraine crisis, but even this concept is impressively broad thanks to the holistic and\ninclusive Russian approach to what constitutes information warfare, of which cyber\nis an integral part.\n\nOpinions are divided as to whether what is taking place in and around Ukraine\ncan or should be called cyber war. As Jan Stinissen argues in Chapter 14, current\ncyber operations do not meet a strict legal definition of a state of war. But at the\nsame time, according to one analysis, operations in Ukraine undoubtedly constitute\ncyber warfare. The conflict:\n\n_‘meets the generally accepted standard for the following reasons: the_\n_cyber warfare component is overt, meaning the perpetrators make little_\n_effort to hide either their identities or their allegiances. The two countries_\n\n11 For a recent overview of the unfriendly means Russia adopts to influence its neighbours, see ‘Russia’s Toolkit’ in ‘The Russian\nChallenge’, Chatham House, June 2015, http://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/russian-challenge-authoritarian-national­\nism.\n12 Keir Giles. ‘Military Service in Russia: No New Model Army’, Conflict Studies Research Centre, May 2007.\n13 Jakob Hedenskog and Robert L.

Both sides have_\n_stated military and political objectives’.[15]_\n\nAs if to emphasise the point, intensive cyber attacks reportedly cease during the\noccasional observance of ceasefires.[16]\n\nOther elements of the cyber conflict also confound definition. Operations to\ndate represent an evolution in Russian tactics compared to previous campaigns.\nBoth cyber and traditional elements of conflict are present, but they are both less\novert and more difficult to understand and defend against.\n\nIn part, this is due to Ukraine’s very different cyber terrain. Comparisons to\nRussia’s rudimentary cyber efforts at the time of the Georgian conflict in 2008 are\nof limited value. Unlike Georgia, Ukraine’s more interconnected nature makes it\nimpossible to restrict access to the internet overall, except in the very special case of\nthe Crimean peninsula. But in addition, there is no reason why Russia should try,\nespecially given the integrated nature of Ukrainian and Russian information space.\nSince Russia already enjoyed domination of Ukrainian cyberspace, including tele­\ncommunications companies, infrastructure, and overlapping networks, there was\nlittle incentive to disrupt it. In short, Russia had no need to attack that which it\nalready owned.[17] To give one simplistic but indicative example, little offensive cyber\neffort is needed for Russia to access sensitive Ukrainian e-mail traffic when so many\nUkrainians, including government officials, use Russian mail services and therefore\nprovide automatic access to the Russian security and intelligence services.[18]\n\nA distinctive aspect of information operations in Ukraine itself, and one with\nimportant implications for how cyber war may be waged in future, is the way Rus­\nsian activity in the cyber domain facilitates broader information warfare aims. This\nmanifests itself not only in straightforward spearphishing of Ukrainian officials[19]\nfor exploitation, but also in specific uses of malware in the conflict.[20] A particu­\nlar example is the redirection of malware originally intended for cybercrime to\nmanipulating viewer figures to promote pro-Russian video clips.[21] But potentially\neven more significant for the nature of future cyber operations is the new interface\n\n15 Tony Martin-Vegue. ‘Are we witnessing a cyber war between Russia and Ukraine?

There are two important implications for planning for\nfuture crises with Russia. First, both civil and military contingency planning should\ninclude scenarios where friendly access to the internet is degraded or absent; and\nsecond, civilian internet infrastructure needs at least as much defence and protec­\ntion as other strategic assets.\n\nIn any case, the course of the conflict so far has seen no visible full-scale cyber\nhostilities of the kind envisaged by theorists, a theme examined in more detail by\nMartin Libicki in Chapter 5. The tactics, techniques and procedures which have\nbeen used at various stages of the conflict are the subject of two separate detailed\nexaminations by Nikolay Koval and Glib Pakharenko in Chapters 6 and 7.\n\n##### 3 Reactions and Responses\n\nInformation campaigning, facilitated by cyber activities, contributed powerfully to\nRussia’s ability to prosecute operations against Ukraine in the early stages of the con­\nflict with little coordinated opposition from the West. The fact that for almost a year\nthe EU was unable to refer publicly to the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine[23]\ndenotes a broader inability to challenge the Russian version of events without which\na meaningful response is difficult or impossible. Early media coverage of the con­\nflict made it ‘apparent … that some interlocutors had swallowed whole some of the\ncruder falsifications of Russian propaganda’.[24]\n\nAs the realisation of the nature of the Russian information campaign began to\nfilter through Western media and policy-making circles, this gave way to a dan­\ngerous optimism about the effectiveness of Russian measures, and a widespread\nassumption that Russian disinformation was failing because of its lack of plausibil­\n\n22 ‘Кримські регіональні підрозділи ПАТ «Укртелеком» офіційно повідомляють про блокування невідомими\nдекількох вузлів зв’язку на півострові’, Ukrtelekom, 28 February 2014, http://www.ukrtelecom.ua/presscenter/news/offi­\ncial?id=120327.\n23 Andrew Rettman,. ‘EU breaks taboo on ‘Russian forces in Ukraine’‘, EU Observer, 16 February 2015, https://euobserver.com/\nforeign/127667.\n24 John Besemeres. ‘Russian disinformation and Western misconceptions’, Inside Story, 23 September 2014, http://insidestory.org.\nau/russian-disinformation-and-western-misconceptions.\n\n\n-----\n\nity. Supposedly, Russian lies were ineffective because they were so obvious that they\ndid not confuse senior and intelligent individuals in the West. But this was to under­\nestimate the effects of layered messaging, subtlety screened and concealed by more\nobvious fabrications, continued saturation, and in particular the pernicious effect\nof the ‘filter bubble’ on online reading habits – the way personalised search results\ndriven by advertising models can effectively isolate internet users from alternative\ninformation and viewpoints.[25]\n\nRussian official sources continue to disseminate lies which are easily detected\nand discredited in the West, as with the striking example of the ‘discovery’ of sup­\nposed US MANPADS in Donetsk in late July 2015.[26] But the implausibility is irrel­\nevant for Russian objectives: the story has been planted and will continue to be dis­\n\nseminated via the internet, and will not be\n\n##### Implausibility is irrelevant contradicted in mainstream sources within\n\nRussia.

When Rus­\nsian disinformation delivered in this manner is part of the framework for decisions,\nthis constitutes success for Moscow, because a key element of the long-standing\nSoviet and Russian approach of reflexive control is in place.\n\nCrucially, it must be remembered that Russian disinformation campaigns aimed\nat the West are conducted not only in NATO languages, but also in Arabic and\nRussian targeting minorities across Europe. This itself has major implications for\nmanaging future confrontations between Russia and other front-line states, which\nmust involve finding a means to respond to Russian information operations when\nthe initiative necessarily lies with Russia. As put pithily by journalist and author\nPeter Pomerantsev, ‘they will always win the narrative war, because they can make\nstuff up’.[27]\n\nFor the time being, much of the Western response appears focused on find­\ning a label for the newly-demonstrated Russian way of warfare. A range of early\ncontenders, such as ‘non-linear war’, ‘ambiguous war’ and others have largely\nbeen abandoned in favour of ‘hybrid warfare’, a concept originally designed for\ndescribing insurgency rather than warfighting by an aspiring regional power, but\nnow applied to a totally new situation. Nevertheless many of the components now\nbeing used to define hybridity are nothing new in Russian practice. One argument\n\n25 ‘How to Burst the ‘Filter Bubble’ that Protects Us from Opposing Views’, MIT Technology Review, 29 November 2013, http://\nwww.technologyreview.com/view/522111/how-to-burst-the-filter-bubble-that-protects-us-from-opposing-views/.\n26 Brian Ashcraft. ‘Pro-Tip: Don’t Copy Battlefield 3 Stingers’, 23 July 2015, Kotaku.com, http://kotaku.com/pro-tip-dont-copybattlefield-3-stingers-1719695507.\n27 Speaking at the Lennart Meri Conference, Tallinn. 24 April 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nholds that a previous round of expansionism by Russia in 1939-40 shared sufficient\ncharacteristics with current operations around Ukraine, including intimidation,\nspurious legitimation, and information campaigns backed with the prospect of\nfull-scale invasion, to also be called hybrid warfare.[28] Russia’s clinging to the atti­\ntudes and approaches of a former age holds other dangers too: Russian military,\nand in particular nuclear, messaging is baffling to its Western audience because\nthe post-nationalist West has moved on from the Cold War mind-set in which it\nis rooted. The result is a dangerous situation where the messages from Russia are\nreceived, but not understood.\n\n##### 4 Outlook\n\nAt the time of writing the situation around Ukraine remains fluid and unpredictable.\nWhile Russia shows no signs of pushing for greater territorial control of Ukraine,\nmoves toward conciliation by the West give rise to fears of appeasement and the\ndanger of a repeat of the disastrous resolution to the Georgia conflict seven years\nbefore.[29] But one undeniable achievement by Russia is the transformation of the\nsecurity environment in Central and Eastern Europe. Faced with a challenge that is\nno longer deniable, Europe has overcome its ‘strategic inertia’.[30] NATO in particular\nhas been revitalised: the NATO agenda has shifted radically from contemplation of\na future role after withdrawal from Afghanistan, now that the Alliance has a clear\nmotivation to return to its core purpose. Poland and the Baltic states, long cast as\nirresponsible trouble-makers for warning of the implications of a resurgent Russia,\nare now fully vindicated and benefiting from the overall NATO and unilateral US\nmilitary response to the crisis. Each is at present supporting these front-line states\nwith very small increments of conventional military forces, while considering how\nto respond to the broader threat of a more assertive Russia.[31]\n\nThe Ukraine conflict has the potential to bring about a transformative effect\nspecifically within cyber doctrine. Unlike Russia, the siloed Western approach to\ncyber has typically focused on technical responses to technical threats, largely disre­\ngarding the interface with information warfare in the broad sense. This approach is\nentirely apt for persistent or background threats, but probably insufficient for when\na national security crisis emerges, since at that point there will be no such thing as\na ‘pure cyber’ confrontation. In other words, the West may have been well prepared\n\n28 Vitalii Usenko and Dmytro Usenko. ‘Russian hybrid warfare: what are effects-based network operations and how to counteract\nthem’, Euromaidan Press, 17 January 2015, http://euromaidanpress.com/2015/01/17/russian-hybrid-warfare-what-are-effectbased-network-operations-and-how-to-counteract-them/.\n29 Karoun Demirjian. ‘Visits by top U.S officials give Russia something to crow about’, The Washington Post, 18 May 2015, http://\nwww.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/visits-by-top-us-offi...about/2015/05/18/3c562a94-fd6b-11e4-8c77-bf274685e1df_\nstory.html.\n30 Andrew A.

Wirtz\n\n_Naval Postgraduate School_\n\nDiscussion of the cyber domain in general, and specific considerations of cyber\nattacks, cyber war and cyber power, often seem oddly detached from a broader stra­\ntegic and geopolitical context.[1] Several reasons can be suggested for why the cyber\ndimension of conflict seems to be considered in isolation from the _physical and_\n_political goals that states and non-state actors attempt to achieve through their activ­_\nities in the virtual world of cyberspace. Offensive and defensive cyber capabilities\nare highly classified by all parties; it is impossible to say with certainty what capa­\nbilities are wielded, making it difficult to assess ‘cyber orders of battle’ and ‘cyber\nbalances of power’. Newspaper reports, anecdotes, and rumours of capabilities offer\nclues, but it is difficult to link rumours to grand strategic objectives. Cyber warfare\nis an exquisitely technical subject dominated by engineers, mathematicians, and\ncomputer scientists – individuals who can be forgiven for focusing on the latest\npatch needed in some software program, and for not thinking about the connection\nbetween technical exploitation and grand political strategy. In a sense, issues related\nto cyber warfare are often treated, not just as something technically new on the mil­\nitary landscape, but as something that is unprecedented in military affairs.\n\nIf one turns a strategist’s eye toward the cyber domain, key questions immedi­\nately emerge.

Moreover, given the need for\nintegration, issues of political and strategic culture, to say nothing of bureaucratic\npreferences and peacetime legal restraints, can be expected to produce national\nstyles and preferences when it comes to conflict in cyberspace.[2]\n\nAlthough attribution of known cyber attacks remains a hotly contested and\nmuch denied issue (given the very limited evidence available), there is some indi­\ncation that strategic culture and organisational preferences shape the way the\nUnited States, China and Russia use their cyber power. According to press reports,\nthe United States was behind the Stuxnet malware attack on centrifuges at Iran’s\nNatanz enrichment facility.[3] Many analysts suggested at the time that the Stuxnet\nattack was noteworthy as the first example of the use of a cyber weapon to cause\nphysical damage, but it also reflected the long-standing American tradition of\nlong-range precision bombardment and the preference for targeting key nodes in\nan opponent’s infrastructure to produce maximum damage with minimal effort.[4]\nBy contrast, the recent Office of Personnel Management hack, which press report­\ning attributes to the People’s Republic of China, seems to reflect a Chinese preoc­\ncupation with guarding its own citizens from nefarious outside influences, while\ngoing to great lengths to gather information that is locked behind others’ defen­\nsive barriers.[5]\n\nRussian cyber activities, especially those associated with the recent conflict\nin Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, probably offer the best example of the\nemployment of cyber attacks to shape the overall political course of a dispute.\nAccording to David J.

Historically, Russia, including its Soviet manifesta­\ntion, has not been at the forefront of scientific or technical innovation. As one recent\nhistory explained, Soviet Cold War espionage was largely dedicated to stealing sci­\nentific, technical, and military information from the West in a desperate and ulti­\nmately failed effort to keep pace with more sophisticated and innovative opponents.[7]\nNevertheless, while the Russians may lack in technological prowess and innovative\ndrive, they tend to excel in their ability to foresee the broad impact of technology on\nthe battlespace. Several sources can be suggested as the basis of this talent. As Rob­\nert Bathhurst explained decades ago, the Russians tend to be ‘dreamers’, allowing\n\n6 David J. Smith. ‘How Russia Harnesses Cyberwarfare,’ Defense Dossier, Issue 4, August 2012, pp. 7-8.\n7 According to Michael Warner, ‘Soviet spies were crucial to keeping the USSR alive and competitive for two reasons: they stole\nenough industrial secrets to substitute for innovation in some sectors, and they kept Moscow apprised of where the West was\nreading Soviet secrets,’ Michael Warner.

During the\nCold War, visions of a fully functioning Star Wars missile defence system shook the\n\nKremlin to its foundations, despite the\n\n##### America focuses on technol­ fact that even proponents of Reagan-era\n\nmissile defence recognised that many of\n\n##### ogy, Russia tends to leap to\n\nthe components of the system were at the\n\n##### the strategic implications of outer fringes of technical feasibility. In weapons systems. other words, while America focuses on\n\nissues of technology and systems integra­\ntion, Russia tends to leap immediately to considerations of the strategic implications\nof emerging weapons systems.\n\nA second influence that shapes Russian views of emerging technology is the fact\nthat, in their hearts, they are good Clausewitzians. In other words, they understand\nthe paramount nature of politics in war. War is a political act. Its purpose is to alter\nthe political judgments of opponents to better suit our own interests. Thus, to have\na strategic effect, cyber power must be used in a way that will shape the political\noutcome of war. Russians are thus quick to think through the links between technol­\nogy, military operations, strategy, and ultimately political outcomes, despite their\nlack of technological dexterity. Soviet estimates of the military balance, for example,\nreflected a broad assessment of the so-called ‘correlation of forces’, which incorpo­\nrated political and economic trends, not just force ratios based on ‘bean counts’ of\nmilitary units. Soviet alarm over NATO’s 1983 Able Archer exercise, for instance,\nwas greatly influenced by the political rhetoric emanating from the Reagan White\nHouse, not by some fundamental shift in the military balance in Europe. The Rus­\nsian officer corps, especially in Soviet days, was also encouraged to think through\nthe strategic implications of new technologies. Today, the Russian Army provides\nsenior officers with multiple venues to debate not only doctrine, but theory. By con­\ntrast, US officers, who tend to focus on operational matters, generally lack similar\nvenues to assess the strategic and political implications of new technology.[9] In fact,\nmany analysts point to a 2013 article signed by the Chief of the Russian General\nStaff, _The Value of Science in Anticipating as laying out the Russian way of cyber_\nwarfare.[10]\n\nA fine illustration of these phenomena is the emergence of the concept of ‘Mili­\ntary-Technical Revolution,’ more commonly referred to by Western analysts as the\n\n8 Robert B.

If war broke\nout in Europe, NATO would do well against first-echelon Warsaw Pact formations,\nbut the Alliance could only slowly bring reinforcements across the Atlantic. Soviet\nthird-echelon forces – units made up mostly of inactive reservists in peacetime –\nwould probably defeat NATO because they would reach the battle before reinforce­\nments streaming across the Atlantic. The United States and its allies had to prevent the\nthird-echelon of the Red Army from reaching the Forward Edge of the Battle Area\n(FEBA). The solution to the third-echelon threat was found in several new technol­\nogies that would allow NATO to conduct precision strikes against Warsaw Pact stag­\ning areas, depots, transportation hubs, and armoured formations hundreds of miles\nbehind the FEBA. By the mid-1980s, US programmes known as Assault Breaker and\nSmart Weapons Program, and NATO initiatives called Emerging Technologies and\nFollow on Forces Attack, were integrated into a new US Army Air-Land Battle doc­\ntrine, creating a nascent reconnaissance-strike complex. US planners adopted a rather\nnonstrategic and apolitical view of these new technologies – they simply saw them as\na way to stop Soviet third-echelon forces from reaching the Central Front.\n\nBy contrast, the Soviets now anticipated a ‘Military-Technical Revolution’, pre­\ndicting that the emerging reconnaissance-strike complex would transform con­\nventional combat, producing truly strategic and political effects. Soviet strategists\nbelieved that long-range precision strikes could destroy forces and critical supply,\ncommunication, and command nodes deep within the enemy’s rear, creating con­\nditions for a catastrophic theatre-wide collapse. Put somewhat differently, the sys­\ntem of systems possessed by the Americans and their NATO allies would rob the\nWarsaw Pact of its ability to mass and manoeuvre forces, or even to conduct com­\nbined arms operations. Soviet officers estimated that the nature of war was about\nto change: conventional, not nuclear, munitions might soon become the weapon of\nchoice against massed armoured and infantry formations. They saw the potential\nimpact that this emerging system of systems could have on strategy, war, and inter­\nnational politics; there was a real possibility that the Warsaw Pact could be rendered\nmilitarily and politically ineffective by these emerging weapons and ways of war.\n\nIronically, Soviet predictions of a Military-Technical Revolution set off alarm\nbells in the West, as analysts scrambled to detect the new secret Soviet weapon that\nwould produce these revolutionary developments in war. Americans were slow\nto realise that the Soviets were in fact writing about American weapons, and the\nnascent precision-strike complex, which was in fact possessed exclusively by the\nUnited States and the NATO alliance. As a result, many of the key concepts related\nto the application of information-age technologies in warfare were produced by\nSoviets thinking about the weapons systems being deployed by their opponents,\nand not by the more technically competent Americans.\n\n11 Dima Adamsky. The Culture of Military Innovation: The Impact of Cultural Factors on the Revolution in Military Affairs in Rus­\n_sia, the US and Israel (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2010)._\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2 Russian Cyber Strategy\n\nToday, how is this Clausewitzian-inspired Russian strategic imagination being\napplied to the use of cyber power? The answer can be found by first exploring the\nstrategic challenge they apparently believe they face: the NATO alliance. NATO is\nbased on the concept of collective defence that enhances its strategy of deterrence.\nThrough formal agreements and long-standing and extensive collaboration, NATO\nsends a strong signal that member states will stand together in the face of threats\nto collectively deter aggression against its members. The objective of this deterrent\npolicy is to preserve the peace. This is a key observation. The goal of NATO’s deter­\nrent strategy is to reduce or even eliminate the possibility of war by ensuring that\naggressors understand ex ante that an attack against one of its members is an attack\nagainst the entire Alliance. Especially today, NATO primarily exists to prevent war,\nnot to develop enhanced strategies or capabilities to prosecute war or to wield forces\nto achieve ancillary objectives. In a sense, NATO exists to preserve the peace and\nto make sure that changes to the status quo in Europe occur through political pro­\ncesses that lead to the spread of democracy, the rule of law, and adherence to inter­\nnational norms. The _raison d’être of NATO is to preserve the peace; the purpose_\nbehind its strategy is to deter war.\n\nTo achieve its objective – rapid change of the European status quo to better\nfit their Russia-centric, not democratically-cantered, interests and preferences –\nRussia opted to pick a course of action not to defeat NATO, but to defeat NATO’s\n_strategy. By presenting the Western alliance with a fait accompli through actions_\nthat produce minimal death and destruction, Russia attempted to shift the onus of\n\nescalation onto NATO, thereby inflict­\n\n##### Russia opted to pick a course ing a strategic defeat on the Alliance\n\nat the outset of hostilities or even in\n\n##### of action not to defeat NATO,\n\nthe event of non-democratic changes\n\n##### but NATO’s strategy. to the status quo. Russia is banking\n\non the hope that NATO will either be\nincapable or unwilling to transform this strategic defeat into active conventional\ncombat, which would further undermine NATO’s goal of preserving the peace.\nIn effect, the Russians seem to have realised that by defeating NATO’s strategy at\nthe outset of a confrontation, they can actually alter political perceptions within\nthe Alliance in a way that suits their objectives. Put somewhat differently, the\nrisk of a forceful NATO response to some provocation is minimised by keep­\ning the death and destruction associated with any _fait accompli to an absolute_\nminimum. NATO is especially vulnerable to cyberattacks and information war­\nfare because Russia can undermine NATO’s deterrent strategy without causing\ncasualties. NATO has the option of reversing the fait accompli, but the required\nlevel of death and destruction simply highlights the failure of its deterrent\nstrategy.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber power, as a key facet of hybrid warfare, is an important enabler in an\nattack on NATO’s deterrent strategy.[12] Cyber attacks are not specifically targeted\nto eliminate key nodes, but to intensify the fog of war by sowing confusion within\ncommand and control networks and\nNATO polities. For instance, according _Cyber power is an impor­_\nto press reports, Russian movement into\n\n##### tant enabler in an attack on\n\nthe Ukraine was accompanied by myr­\niad cyber attacks, including Distributed _NATO’s deterrent strategy._\nDenial of Service (DDoS) tactics against\ncomputers in Kyiv, Poland, the European Parliament, and the European Commis­\nsion.[13] If local political and military leaders cannot develop an accurate estimate\nof quickly developing events, critical hours or even days can be gained with which\nRussia can create facts on the ground that can only be reversed at great effort. A little\nbit of ‘sand in the works’, so to speak, is enough to further delay the relatively slowpace of decision-making in the West.[14]\n\nThe annexation of Crimea also began with a series of covert operations that used\na disinformation campaign to create ambiguity and delay Ukraine’s response, effec­\ntively extending the element of surprise achieved by the Russian gambit. According\nto Michael Kofman and Matthew Rohansky:\n\n_‘Russia’s use of broadcast tools for propaganda and psychological operations,_\n_part of a broader information campaign to support the Crimean annexation,_\n_caught both the Ukraine and the West by surprise. Moscow amped up the_\n_alarmist content of its broadcasting . . . stoking fear and confusion in Crimea’.[15]_\n\nAdmittedly, the annexation was completed using more traditional operations\ninvolving conventional units, but the cyber-enabled opening moves not only\nallowed Russia to test the Western response, but to buy the time needed to create a\n_fait accompli through conventional means._\n\nWestern analysts have noted that even though the Crimea crisis surprised the\nWest, the Russian effort to integrate television and the internet, especially various\n\n12 As Michael Kofman and Matthew Rojansky note, ‘hybrid warfare,’ including the Russian variations used against the Ukraine\nis not unique. The point here, however, is that Russia is particularly adept as using cyber power in the practice of hybrid war­\nfare; see Kofman and Rojansky, (op cit) p. 2. Other analysts have noted how the Crimea annexation and the additional actions\nagainst Ukraine were dependant on capabilities long under development that were especially crafted not to trigger a NATO\nresponse; Aleksandr Golts and Heidi Reisinger. ‘Russia’s Hybrid Warfare: Waging War below the Radar of Traditional Collec­\ntive Defence,’ Research Paper No 105 (Research Division – NATO Defence College Rome) November 2014.\n13 Owen Matthews. ‘BIG READ: Russia leading the way in the cyber arms race,’ Irish Examiner, Saturday June 13, 2015. www.\nirishexaminer.com’lifestyle’feature’big-read-russia-leading-the-way-in-the-cyber-arms-race-336675.html.\n14 The key point is that information denial or dominance does not have to be absolute, it just needs to foster delay and uncer­\ntainty in Western political and military decision-making. According to Paul Saunders, ‘Russia’s seizure of Crimea happened\nvery quickly. U.S. and European decision-making processes just don’t move at that speed, particularly when facing ambiguity.\nOnce a Crimea-style operation has begun, it will be extremely difficult if not impossible for Western decision-makers to be\nsufficiently confident about the other side’s intent to take consequential action before it’s too late’; Saunders, P. ‘Why America\nCan’t Stop Russia’s Hybrid Warfare,’ The National Interest June 23, 2015. www.nationalinterest.org/feature/shy-america-can’tstop-russias-hybrid-warfare-13166.\n15 Kofman and Rojansky, p. 4.\n\n\n-----\n\ntypes of social media, into its effort to shape opponents’ political perspectives, has\nbeen ongoing for quite some time. In a sense, Russia has worked hard to use the\ninternet to shape the political environment of conflict: it has (1) developed inter­\nnally and externally focused media with a significant online presence; (2) used\nsocial media to guarantee that Russian narratives reach the broadest possible audi­\nence; and (3) polished their content in terms of language and presentation so that\nit rings true in various cultural settings.[16] These activities have recently been given\ntheir own moniker – trolling – the practice of creating cyber actors with false iden­\ntities to communicate tailored messages to an unsuspecting audience.[17] According\nto Keir Giles:\n\n_‘Russian assessments of current events makes it clear that Russia considers itself_\n_to be engaged in full-scale information warfare, involving not only offensive_\n_but defensive operations – whether or not its notional adversaries have actually_\n_noticed this is happening’.[18]_\n\nWhat most analysts fail to realise, however, is that Moscow has shaped this\ncyber-enabled information warfare in a very strategic manner. Cyber power is being\nwielded as a strategic weapon to create facts on the ground with the minimal use of\nkinetic force.\n\n##### 3 Conclusion\n\nBecause of its rather inchoate nature, the cyber domain is a milieu in which vari­\nous strategic cultures can be manifest. Russian strategic culture focuses on war as a\npolitical activity; for cyber power to have a truly strategic effect, Russia believes that\nit must contribute directly to shaping political outcomes by altering the political\nperceptions of their opponents to better suit their interests. If one also accepts the\nidea that Russians are especially adept at understanding the political and strategic\nimpact of new technologies, it is possible that they have grasped the real strategic\nopportunities created by the information revolution – opportunities that might be\ngiven short shrift by analysts shaped by different strategic cultures.\n\nThe true test of strategy, however, is found in a specific geopolitical and military\ncontext. In terms of Crimea and Ukraine, the Russians have developed an exquisite\nstrategic application of cyber power not to defeat NATO’s military capabilities, but\nto defeat NATO’s strategy by creating a _fait accompli while sidestepping NATO’s_\ndeterrent. By using cyber power to create ‘facts on the ground’ with minimal casual­\n\n16 Keir Giles. ‘Working Paper: Russia’s Hybrid Warfare: a Success in Propaganda,’ European Security and Defence College, 18\nFebruary 2015. www.baks.bund.de’de’aktuelles/working-paper-russias-hybrid-warfe-a-success-in propaganda\n17 Adrian Chen. ‘The Agency,’ New York Times Magazine, June 2, 2015. p. 57.\n18 Giles.\n\n\n-----\n\nties, they shifted the onus of escalation onto NATO to reverse the fait accompli. In a\nsense, they created a situation in which NATO leaders must choose between suffer­\ning a harsh strategic defeat (the eruption of war in Europe) and the accommodation\nof the Russian annexation of Crimea and ongoing pressure against Ukraine. Cyber\npower, either in the form of direct attacks or a concerted information campaign, was\nused to create this dilemma for NATO by delaying a Western response until these\nstark choices emerged. The lesson is clear: if one can defeat an opponent’s strategy,\nthen it is possible to achieve one’s objectives without defeating an opponent’s forces\nor triggering execution of a deterrent threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 4\n\n ‘Compelling Opponents\n to Our Will’: The Role of\n Cyber Warfare in Ukraine\n\n##### James Andrew Lewis\n\n_Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)_\n\n##### 1 Metric for Cyber Attack\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has challenged fundamental elements of Western alliance\nstrategy. Russian efforts exploit a general reluctance by the West – natural in democ­\nracies – to risk war. The West has been unable to deter Russia from its adventure.\n\nCyber warfare has played only a limited role in this. The concepts of strategic and\nmilitary effect provide us with two metrics for assessing the effect of cyber attacks gen­\nerally, and for Russian cyber activities in Ukraine. Strategic effect would be to dimin­\nish the opponent’s will or capacity to resist. This can include politically coercive cyber\nactions such as were used against Estonia. Military effect would be degradation in the\nperformance of commanders, troops, and weapons, demonstrated by U.S. actions in\nits Middle Eastern conflicts or as part of the 2007 Israeli airstrike in Syria[1].\n\nCyber attacks that produce strategic or military effect can include the manipula­\ntion of software, data, knowledge, and opinion to degrade performance and produce\npolitical or psychological effect. Introducing uncertainty into the minds of opposing\ncommanders or political leaders is a worthy military objective. Manipulating public\nopinion to damage an opponent’s legitimacy and authority in both domestic and\ninternational audiences is also valuable. Some actions may provide only symbolic\neffect aimed at a domestic audience, but this too is valuable for a nation in conflict.\n\n1 David Makovsky. ‘The Silent Strike: How Israel bombed a Syrian nuclear installation and kept it secret,’ The New Yorker, 17\nSeptember 2012, http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/17/the-silent-strike.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo assess non-kinetic effect as a contributor for strategic or military advan­\ntage, we must look for observable effects in three categories: creating confusion,\nshaping opinion, and inflicting damage to data or services. Using these metrics,\nwe can conclude that Russian cyber efforts in Ukraine produced an early tactical\neffect that has since tapered off and, since they are limited to actions that do not\nproduce physical or disruptive consequences, have largely failed to achieve stra­\ntegic or military effect.\n\n##### 2 Strategic and Military Effect\n\nThe Ukraine conflict has been described as hybrid warfare; a mixture of unconven­\ntional tactics and strategies, irregular forces, covert action, cyber operations, and\npolitical manipulation to achieve strategic goals. In essence, hybrid warfare is a col­\nlection of tactics designed to circumvent deterrence and avoid military retaliation\nby skirting the threshold of what could be considered state use of armed force. In\nthis new style of conflict, non-kinetic actions can be as important as kinetic attacks.\nHybrid warfare highlights the central problem for our understanding and manage­\nment of interstate conflict; conventional warfare is now only part of a larger range of\ncoercive actions available to nations.\n\nCyber operations – the ability to remotely manipulate computer networks – have\n\ncreated a capability that is well suited\nto this new political-military environ­\n\n##### Cyber capabilities create an\n\nment. Cyber capabilities create an oper­\n\n##### operational space in which ational space in which nations can con­ nations can conduct offensive duct offensive action with less political\n\nrisk, given the grey area in international\n\n##### action with less political risk.\n\nlaw which cyber war inhabits, and\nwhere opponents can find it difficult to\nrespond. Advanced cyber action can create physical effects equivalent to kinetic\nattack, but we should not interpret cyber capabilities solely from the perspective of\nphysical effect.\n\nWhile cyber attacks can produce effects similar to kinetic weapons, there is an\ninformational aspect involving the manipulation of opinion and decision-making\nthat is equally important and much more frequently used. Cyber attack can pro­\nduce results equivalent to kinetic attack, but this is not its primary effect, which\n(at least for now) is to manipulate data, knowledge, and opinion to produce polit­\nical or psychological effect rather than physical damage. Introducing uncertainty\ninto the minds of opposing commanders or political leaders is a worthwhile mili­\ntary goal, as it will cause them to make mistakes or to become hesitant, providing\nthe attacker with dominance of the battle space and the advantage of putting the\ndefender in a reactive posture. Cyber actions that manipulate public opinion to\n\n\n-----\n\naffect an opponent’s legitimacy and authority are also valuable in conflict among\nstates.\n\nCyber attack creates an operational space for coercive action that avoids many\nof the political risks of kinetic warfare. Cyber attacks are attractive in that they offer\nvarying degrees of covertness and their treatment under international law remains\nambiguous in regard to whether they qualify as an ‘armed attack’ that would legiti­\nmise retaliation. Although cyber tools and techniques can be used in harmful ways,\nthey are not weapons _per se, which can make it difficult to decide when a cyber_\nincident can be considered an armed attack or a use of force.\n\nAn initial effort to define how a cyber incident could qualify as a use of force\nor armed attack would be to consider that an effect of the cyber action was the\nequivalent of an attack using conventional weapons producing physical destruc­\ntion or casualties. A cyber incident that produced injury or death to persons\nand the destruction of or damage to property would certainly be considered as\na use of force or armed attack. A cyber attack that produced intangible effects\nof such scope, intensity, and duration that they are judged to have consequences\nor harmful effects of sufficient scale and gravity could also be considered an\narmed attack.\n\nNo Russian action in Ukraine rises to this level. Overall, the use of offensive\ncyber capabilities for kinetic effect has been minimal, with only a few known inci­\ndents. Russia is one of the most skilled among the nations who have developed\ncyber capabilities, but we have not seen extensive use of actual attacks against\nUkraine. Neither critical infrastructure nor Ukrainian weapons have been damaged\nor disrupted. Russia has used its cyber capabilities primarily for political coercion,\nopinion-shaping, and intelligence gathering, and these cyber operations fall below\nthe threshold set in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. Operations in Estonia,\nGeorgia, and now Ukraine suggest that NATO may need to adjust its thinking about\nhow opponents will use cyber attacks.\n\nRussia has been relatively careful in the overt use of its own forces – especially\ncompared to its actions against Georgia where the Russian Ministry of Defence con­\nfirmed that Russian armoured units were engaged in combat for ‘peace enforce­\nment’. The Russian army occupied Georgian territory and Russian aircraft bombed\ntargets including the capital.[2] Russian actions in Ukraine took a different course.\nThe current caution may reflect lessons learned in Georgia or a desire to preserve\nsome degree of deniability, and manoeuvring to avoid an overt violation of interna­\ntional law.\n\nCyber attack does not require ‘an act of violence to compel our opponent to\nfulfil our will’.[3] Violence through cyber means is possible, but that is not the only\nor even primary use of cyber attack. Its effects are more often intangible and\n\n2 Library of Congress, Russian Federation: Legal Aspects of War in Georgia, http://www.loc.gov/law/help/russian-georgia-war.\nphp.\n3 Clausewitz’s definition of war.\n\n\n-----\n\ninformational, and are intended to manipulate data, create uncertainty, and shape\nopinion. An emphasis on kinetic effect can obscure important operational dis­\ntinctions in the use of cyber techniques and complicates efforts to develop norms\nfor cyber conflict.\n\n##### 3 Norms and the Application of International Law[4]\n\nRussia’s activities in Ukraine have implications for both cyber warfare and for cyber\nnorms. Russian actions have carved new contours for conflict that do not map per­\nfectly to existing concepts and rules for warfare and defence. Existing norms and\nlaws for armed attack were based on the use or threat of use of physical violence and\nforce. These must be adjusted, if not amended, for cyber conflict.\n\nEfforts to redefine violence and force to include the full range of possible\ncyber actions (such as Russian and Chinese efforts in the United Nations (UN)\nto define information as a weapon[5]) have so far introduced more ambiguity\nthan clarity. Information is clearly not a weapon, but a minimalist definition\nthat emphasises kinetic effect is also inadequate in capturing the full range of\ncyber effects.\n\nAs such, the ‘rules’ for cyber conflict\n\n##### The ‘rules’ for cyber conflict pose a challenge to existing international\n\nlaw.

Disagreements over the application of international\nlaw between Russia, China and a few others on one hand, and NATO nations on the\nother, almost derailed the talks.\n\nThe crux of the disagreement was over the application of specific provisions\nof the UN Charter, (the general applicability of the Charter had been agreed to\nin earlier GGEs), and in particular the applicability of Article 2/4 (renouncing\nthe use of force) and Article 51 (the inherent right to self-defence). One ques­\ntion for the development of further norms for cyber conflict becomes whether\nit is possible to move beyond the norms embedded in the UN Charter and the\ninternational agreements governing the conduct of warfare and armed conflict,\nto address this new aspect of warfare and to create norms that govern non-ki­\n\n4 The author was rapporteur to the UN Group of Governmental Experts in 2010, 2013 and 2015.\n5 See, for example, SCO, Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation\n_on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 2009, https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/_\nSCO-090616-IISAgreementRussian.pdf [in Russian].\n6 Along with norms and confidence building measures, see Group of Governmental Experts Report on Developments in the Field\n_[of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174, 22 July 2015, UNODA, http://www.](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/174)_\n[un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/174.](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/174)\n\n\n-----\n\nnetic action. One possible avenue for progress would be to expand the Charter\ncommitment to avoid actions that threaten the territorial integrity or political\nindependence of a state (found in Articles 2/4 and 51) to explicitly include cyber\nactions.\n\nContinued ambiguity over the application of these UN Charter articles serves\nthe interests of Russia and China by not creating grounds for or legitimising retalia­\ntion for cyber actions.[7] This includes a general rejection of Western efforts to define\n‘use of force’ and ‘armed attack’ using the concepts of equivalence and effect. These\nambiguities, however, are not unique to cyber conflict, date from the signing of the\nCharter, and reflect conflicting desires to renounce the use of force while preserving\nthe right to use force in self-defence. The Russian and Chinese goal, similar to other\nactions in arms control negotiations by these countries, is to constrain the U.S. and\nits allies.\n\nIntentional ambiguity may define the emerging strategic conflict between Russia\nand the West for the foreseeable future. Russian cyber tactics accentuate and expand\nambiguity. The Russian concept of cyber warfare blends elements of what would\nbe considered information warfare in the West. It is well known that the Russians\nprefer to use the phrase ‘information conflict’ to ‘cyber conflict’ on the grounds that\ncyber is too narrow and technical. Unsurprisingly, this preference reflects their use\nand understanding of cyber techniques.\n\nThe norms before the UN General Assembly for approval at its 70[th] session will\nreiterate the rule of international law and the UN Charter, although how these are\nto be applied is a matter of intense dispute. They call for states not to attack critical\ninfrastructure in peacetime, and to take note of the principles of humanity, neces­\nsity, proportionality, and distinction whey they exercise their inherent rights rec­\nognised by the UN Charter, including the right of self-defence. They do not address\nthe use of cyber tools for political coercion, and it is interesting and indicative to\nnote that Russia, which has made the most frequent use of cyber coercion, is the\nleading proponent for such norms.\n\nState practice suggests that there is an implicit threshold among states to avoid\ncyber actions against each other that could be interpreted as the use of force or\nan armed attack. This creates implicit norms for state behaviour derived from\ninternational practice that constrain malicious cyber actions, but these implicit\nnorms are inadequate for this new form of conflict. The kind of cyber conflict\nwe have seen in Ukraine poses a challenge not only to existing Western strategy\n(which is based on international law and UN Charter commitments) but also for\nthe development of norms. If the trend in warfare is to circumvent direct con­\nfrontation between conventional forces (particularly the conventional forces of\nthe U.S. and its allies), and if cyber conflict will often not involve kinetic effect\nor territorial intrusions, existing norms and rules for conflict will have limited\napplication.\n\n7 According to conversations between the author and GGE representatives from many countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can place cyber norms into four categories:\n\n  - Those that call for observation of existing international law regarding\n\nstate responsibility, especially the laws of armed conflict;\n\n  - Those that seek to exempt from cyber attack infrastructures where an\n\nattack could have an indiscriminate effect such as critical infrastruc­\ntures, including the infrastructure of the global internet;\n\n  - Norms on state responsibilities to assist other states that are the victim\n\nof cyber attacks; and\n\n  - Norms on the proliferation of cyber technologies that could be used\n\nfor malevolent purposes (which is still nascent and suffers from defini­\ntional problems).\n\nNone of these norms can be easily extended to the new modes of coercion created\nby cyber capabilities. The stricture that comes closest is the Article 2/4 commitment\nto refrain from the use of force against the political independence of another state, but\ncyber actions such as we have seen in Ukraine cannot be considered a use of force.\n\nCyber actions that do not have physical effect and which are taken outside the con­\ntext of formal conflict do not fit well with the existing structure of international practice.\nNations appear to observe an implicit threshold for their use of cyber tools and with very\nfew exceptions, have avoided actions that could be considered under international law\nas a use of force or an armed attack. Attempts to expand these implicit understandings\n\nor to redefine the use of force to include coer­\n\n##### Nations appear to observe cive or politically manipulative cyber actions\n\nimmediately run into problems.

Russian negotiating behaviour, shaped in\ngood measure by Soviet precedent, is often defensive, seeking to constrain the U.S.\nand its allies in areas where the West has a technological advantage, or to limit the\npolitical risks the internet creates. This defensive orientation creates a negotiating\nagenda that conflicts with Western countries when it comes to norms.\n\n##### 4 Comparing Ukraine to Estonia and Georgia\n\nContrasting Russian cyber activities in Ukraine with Estonia and Georgia is helpful\nin assessing their use and value, as well as in considering what new norms might\nlook like.

They had little tangible effect, but\nthey created uncertainty and fear among Estonian leaders as they were considered a\npotential precursor to armed Russian intervention. In Georgia[9], cyber attacks were\nclosely coordinated with Russian military operations.\n\nThe effects of the cyber attacks in Estonia and Georgia deserve more careful\nstudy. The attacks did not cripple or bring Estonia to its knees, and NATO’s decision\nnot to invoke Article V reflects this fact. They were frightening not because of the\ncyber effect, but because of Estonian concerns about Russian intentions, NATO’s\nreliability, and their internal Russian-speaking minority. Similarly, cyber attacks on\nGeorgia were largely symbolic. The most visible incident was the defacement of the\nGeorgian President’s website by Russian hackers, who drew moustaches on his pho­\ntograph. The most interesting part of the Georgia episode was the close operational\ncoordination between the hackers and the Russian military. The Russians continue\nto experiment with cyber tools to support their political objectives.\n\nIf the Russian goal in Ukraine is to shape global public opinion, there were some\nearly successes in painting the Ukrainians as ‘fascists’ (a favoured communist insult)\nguilty of human rights violations. But no one believes that anymore, and the tide\nof public opinion has turned heavily against Russia.

Cyber attack was largely irrelevant.\n\n9 _Ibid._\n10 Bruce Stokes. ‘Russia, Putin, Held in Low Esteem around the World,’ Pew Research Centre, 5 August 2015, http://www.pew­\nglobal.org/2015/08/05/russia-putin-held-in-low-regard-around-the-world/.\n11 See, for example, Dmitry Volchek and Daisy Sindelar, ‘One Professional Russian Troll Tells All,’ RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty,\n25 March 2015, sec.

States (especially states with a fondness for Lenin) will use\ncyber attacks for politically coercive purposes and might use them for military\npurposes, to disrupt data or services. But the incidents in Ukraine did not disrupt\ncommand and control, deny access to information, or have any noticeable military\neffect.\n\nThis means that we (and the Russians) may overestimate the coercive effect of\ncyber attacks and that their real military value is achieved when there is physical\neffect or disruption of data and critical services, something that most denial of ser­\nvice attacks cannot produce. Cyber attacks are a support weapon and will shape\nthe battlefield, but by themselves they will not produce victory. Cyber attacks sup­\nport other weapons and operations, as in the 2007 Israeli attack against Syrian air\ndefence. This is still a subject of intense debate, but experience suggests that it is\neasy to exaggerate the effect of cyber attack. A more accurate assessment would rank\ncyber activities into three categories: espionage, operational, and political. However,\nnote that the benefits of the former are clear, while the latter are open to question.\n\nTo provide strategic or military effect, cyber actions must produce destructive\neffect and be integrated into existing military structures, doctrine, planning, and\noperations. Estonia and Georgia can be contrasted with two known attacks that did\nhave military effect. The Israeli air strike against a Syrian nuclear facility is reported\n\nto have used cyber means to disrupt\n\n##### If cyber is the weaponisation Syrian air defence radars, allowing the\n\naircraft to fly undetected across much\n\n##### of signals intelligence, there\n\nof the country.[13] In this case, there was\n\n##### must be physical damage. no physical damage but a vital service\n\nwas disrupted. With Stuxnet, there was\nphysical damage, albeit inflicted covertly, that could be duplicated in overt warfare,\nnoting that a degree of caution is warranted to predict the effect of cyber attacks on\ncivilian infrastructure.[14] We should also note the reported use of cyber techniques\nby the U.S. to disrupt or confuse Taliban command and control, often with lethal\nresults for the insurgents.[15] If cyber is the weaponisation of signals intelligence, it\nappears that to have actual military effect, there must be physical damage.\n\nThis is a consideration of cyber as a tool of military action and does not consider\neither traditional methods of electronic warfare, which Russia has used extensively\nin Ukraine,[16] nor the intelligence value of Russian cyber espionage. We do not know\nthe role cyber espionage played in these efforts, but if Russian successes against the\nUnited States are any guide, we can assume cyber spying made a positive contribu­\n\n13 David Makovsky. ‘The Silent Strike: How Israel bombed a Syrian nuclear installation and kept it secret,’ The New Yorker, 17\nSeptember 2012, http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/17/the-silent-strike.\n14 Kim Zetter. ‘An Unprecedented Look At Stuxnet, The World’s First Digital Weapon,’ Wired, 3 November 2014, http://www.\nwired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/.\n15 Interviews with US military officials.\n16 Joe Gould. ‘Electronic Warfare: What US Army Can Learn From Ukraine,’ Defense News, 4 August 2015, http://www.defense­\nnews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/warfare/2015/08/02/us-army-ukraine-russia-electronic-warfare/30913397/.\n\n\n-----\n\ntion. That Russia has completely penetrated Ukrainian communication networks\nand has unparalleled access to Ukrainian communications is likely to provide con­\nsiderable value for Russian tactics and planning, but cyber as a tool of coercion has\nproven to be of limited utility.\n\nThis is certainly not the cyber war as it is often depicted in public media, but\nit does not mean that cyber attack is overrated and militaries can deemphasise it.\nThat would be a rash conclusion. It means that the Russians, for whatever reason,\nchose not to use the most damaging forms of cyber attack against Ukraine, Georgia,\nor Estonia. If allegations that Russia were responsible for damaging cyber attacks\non a German steel mill[17] and a Turkish pipeline[18] are correct, these would demon­\nstrate that Russia has the capability necessary for cyber attacks that would create\nphysical damage and qualify as a use of force. Russia’s 2008 exploit in penetrating\nCentral Command’s classified networks[19] was an early demonstration of its ability\nto implant malware on an opponent’s networks that could erase data and disrupt\ncommand and control, but the Russians chose not to do this.\n\nIn Ukraine, Russia has experimented with how best to produce military and\npolitical benefits from cyber operations. Political context and alliance relationships\nhave a powerful influence in constraining the use of force, including cyber attacks.\nIts cyber actions appear to reflect a decision not to engage the full range of Russian\ncyber capabilities. Other potential opponents, including NATO, should not assume\nthat in the event of conflict, the Russians will make the same decision.\n\n17 [‘Hack attack causes ‘massive damage’ at steel works,’ BBC, 22 December 2014, http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30575104.](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30575104)\n18 Ariel Bogle. ‘A Cyber Attack May Have Caused a Turkish Oil Pipeline to Catch Fire in 2008,’ Slate, 11 December 2014, http://\nwww.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/12/11/bloomberg_reports_a_cyber_attack_may_have_made_a_turkish_oil_pipe­\nline_catch.html.\n19 [Phil Stewart and Jim Wolf. ‘Old worm won’t die after 2008 attack on military,’ Reuters, 16 June 2011, http://www.reuters.com/](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/17/us-usa-cybersecurity-worm-idUSTRE75F5TB20110617)\n[article/2011/06/17/us-usa-cybersecurity-worm-idUSTRE75F5TB20110617.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/17/us-usa-cybersecurity-worm-idUSTRE75F5TB20110617)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 5\n\n The Cyber War\n that Wasn’t\n\n##### Martin Libicki\n\n_RAND_\n\n##### 1 Introduction: Isn’t It Time for Cyber War?\n\nFor the last twenty years, with the advent of serious thinking about ‘cyber war’, most\nanalysts – and even the more sceptical thinkers – have been convinced that all future\nkinetic wars between modern countries would have a clear cyber component. How­\never, the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict is challenging this widely held notion.\n\nCoinciding with this assumption, however, it must be said that within the past\ngeneration there have been few conflicts in which both sides appeared both capa­\nble of and vulnerable to cyber attack. Either one party to the conflict – usually the\nUnited States – held all the cyber cards, or neither did. For cyber war to take place,\nat least one side must have enough digi­\ntised networked equipment to make _Analysts have been convinced_\nmuch difference.

Integrated air-defence systems (IADS) have been considered ripe targets for\n\n\n-----\n\ncyber warfare, but it was understood that there would be a cost-benefit analysis\nrelative to dispatching them using more familiar tools such as electronic warfare or\nmissiles. There were rumours, for example, that the US employed cyberwar tech­\nniques against Serbian IADS in 1999, but these rumours were never substantiated.\nEven the Syrian story may be a fairy tale, as the details are classified and subject to\nmuch speculation. It is possible that the tactics were in fact more conventional, such\nas traditional jamming.[1]\n\n##### 2 Unique Aspects of the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict\n\nThe current Russo-Ukrainian conflict, however, is a different case, and it should\nhelp us to understand if cyber war is, in 2015, more myth or reality. According to\nthe prevailing assumption, this war should have seen serious and open cyber war\nstrategies and tactics. Both countries have technologically advanced societies and\nweaponry that at least came up to 1990 standards of modernity. Both countries have\na strong information technology (IT) base, and hackers a-plenty, although many\nof them are engaged in organised crime rather than working for the state.[2] Russia’s\nstate-sponsored hackers are widely believed to be on par with, or very close to, NSAlevel standards.\n\nThe most notable thing about the war in Ukraine, however, is the near-com­\nplete absence of any perceptible cyber war. There has been vigorous cyber espi­\nonage,[3] the targeting of cell phones by Russian electronic warfare, and the use\nof old-fashioned bolt-cutters to sever lines of communication in Crimea.[4]\nPatriotic hacktivists on both sides have conducted harassing but small cyber\nattacks against each other,[5] both sides have conducted Distributed Deni­\nal-of-Service (DDoS) attacks (e.g., by Russia against Ukraine’s parliament),[6] and\n\n1 As Richard Clarke and Robert Knake maintain in Cyberwar, The Next Threat to National Security and What to do About It, New\nYork NY: HarperCollins, 2010; see also David Makovsky. ‘The Silent Strike: How Israel bombed a Syrian nuclear installation\nand kept it secret,’ The New Yorker, 17 September 2012, http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/17/the-silent-strike.\n2 Ukraine’s hackers do not make as much news but consider Dan Goodin. ‘Strange snafu hijacks UK nuke maker’s traffic, routes\nit through Ukraine,’ ARS Technica UK, 13 March 2015, http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/mysterious-snafu-hijacks-uknukes-makers-traffic-through-ukraine/.\n3 Apparently, the Russians have developed some powerful malware for that purpose against Ukraine: cyber-snake (aka Ourob­\noros).

In this regard, Mos­\ncow has a competitive advantage over Kyiv. The two countries share a common lan­\nguage, Russian (the use of the Ukrainian language is growing fast, but that language\nis Slavic), and most Russian-language-friendly sites such as VKontakte (the Russian\nFacebook) are headquartered in Russia. That said, little if any of the conflict taking\nplace in social media requires subverting computers through the discovery of vul­\nnerabilities or the engagement of exploits.\n\nIn particular, there are two major forms of cyber attack that have not taken place\nin the Russo-Ukrainian conflict: attacks on critical infrastructure and attacks on\ndefence systems. It is possible that, in the\nfuture, we may learn that there have been\n\n##### Two major forms of cyber\n\nsuch attacks, but that they were simply\nsubtle enough to slip under the radar. _attack have not taken place:_\nWith Stuxnet, Iran’s centrifuge plant at _on critical infrastructure and_\nNatanz was infected for six months, with\n\n##### on defence systems.\n\ncentrifuges failing at unexpected rates,\nbefore Iranian engineers understood\nwhy.

Here are some possible answers to that question.\n\n_Ukraine does not have the requisite hackers. Russian hackers need no introduc­_\ntion. They work for the state, for cyber crime syndicates, and for themselves as patri­\notic hacktivist defenders of Mother Russia. However, on the Ukrainian side (a much\nsmaller nation to begin with), it is possible that a large percentage of the hacker\ntalent is of Russian descent and may have divided loyalties in this conflict. That said,\n\n7 Mark Clayton. ‘Ukraine election narrowly avoided ‘wanton destruction’ from hackers,’ Christian Science Monitor, 17 June 2014,\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2014/0617/Ukraine-election-narrowly-avoided-wanton-destruction-from-hack­\ners-video.\n\n\n-----\n\nmany small countries have made large contributions in cyberspace, including Esto­\nnia, Iceland, Lebanon[8] and Israel.\n\n_Neither Russia nor Ukraine has valid targets._ This gets closer to the truth.\nAlthough the Soviet Union of 1990 had sophisticated weapons, their long suits were\nin metallurgy and radio-frequency devices. When the Soviet Union collapsed, it\nwas significantly behind the West in terms of electronics and software. In the last\nfive years, there has been a modest recapitalisation in Russia, but close to none in\nUkraine. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has for the most part\nmaintained its substantial lead over Russia in digitisation and networking. Thus,\nUS fears about its systems falling prey to hackers are currently not shared by the\nmajority of nation-states, who feel that they are not particularly vulnerable. How­\never, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle: for example, no one is buying\nanalogue telecommunications systems anymore, not even in the developing world.\nNew equipment is digital and networked, not only because it is more powerful, but\nbecause it is cheaper over the long run. Therefore, even in Russia and Ukraine, the\nlevel of digitisation is likely high enough to engender real concerns about their soci­\neties’ vulnerability to cyber attack. Their militaries may be antiquated, but due to the\nclose relationship between the IT of modern civilian and military domains, there is\nprobably still plenty for hackers to target.\n\n_There is no need – The Russians already own Ukraine: Much of Ukraine’s infra­_\nstructure – notably the phone system – dates from the Soviet era. It is logical, there­\nfore, that the Russians have already wired the phone system for interception and, it\nwould hardly be in their interest to take it down.[9] This explanation does not explain\nanything the Ukrainian side has or has not done, nor does it explain the lack of\nattacks on other systems such as power, natural gas distribution or finance. How­\never, it may help to understand a lack of attacks on telecommunications, given that a\ncyber attack could disrupt a lucrative cyber espionage operation by alerting defend­\ners that their systems have been penetrated and forcing a system scrub. Such action\nmay not only knock out existing implants but also make the reinsertion of malware\nmore difficult. The effects of cyber attack tend to be short term, while stealthy cyber\nexploitation can persist for years. Therefore, for strategic purposes, attacks such as\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) can be counterproductive. Well-designed technologies like\nSkype, however, which have end-to-end encryption, could lessen the value of cyber\nespionage over time (but not by much, because encryption does not protect if com­\nputers on one or both ends of the conversation are compromised), and increase the\nlikelihood of denial-of-service attacks.\n\n_Neither Russia nor Ukraine wants such an escalation: In theory, the Rus­_\nso-Ukrainian conflict is not a war between two states, but an insurgency and count­\n\n8 Kelly Jackson Higgins. ‘Lebanon Believed behind Newly Uncovered Cyber Espionage Operation,’ Information Week, 31 March\n2015, http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/lebanon-believed-behind-newly-uncovered-cyber-espionage-opera­\ntion/d/d-id/1319695.\n9 Jeffrey Carr, quoted in Patrick Tucker. ‘Why Ukraine Has Already Lost The Cyberwar, Too,’ Defence One, 28 April 2014, http://\nwww.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-ukraine-has-already-lost-cyberwar-too/83350/.\n\n\n-----\n\ner-insurgency campaign over territory in eastern Ukraine.

In this context, if Russia\nwere to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure or vice versa it would be hard to ascribe the\nattack to separatists, who likely would not possess the requisite advanced hacker\nskills among their ‘patriotic hacker’ ranks. Organised crime syndicates may have the\ntechnical expertise, but may lack the trust or the intelligence-informed approach\nrequired. Still, given that both of these groups enjoy some state protection in Russia,\nsuch an operation is not out of the question. The more important point here is that\nany such escalation could change the narrative of the conflict from an inter-eth­\nnic squabble to an interstate war. An obvious attack by Russia against Ukraine’s\ninfrastructure may conflict with its current political narrative. A Ukrainian attack\nagainst Russia could be a warning signal to Moscow that it will have to pay a price\nfor its actions (a sporty move indeed), as well as a sign that it cannot do better in\na conventional fight with the Russian military. A wild card here is that cyber war\ntechniques in 2015 may be viewed in and of themselves as unduly escalatory, but\nthis fear likely does not apply to cyber attacks precisely focused on enemy military\ntargets in theatre where their use ought to seem no more alarming than the use of,\nsay, electronic warfare. Finally, it is important to remember that two nuclear states\nmay easily prefer fighting without resorting to nuclear weapons; in cyber warfare,\nmany analysts have noted that any two sides are likely riddled with exploitable vul­\nnerabilities.[10]\n\n_Cyber war is not a ‘silver bullet’. Proponents of cyber war argue that attacks are_\ncheap, asymmetric, effective, and risk-free. But what if they are wrong? A truly suc­\ncessful cyber attack – one that does more than simply annoy defenders – is harder\nthan it looks.

Some states may already have calculated that the\neffects of cyber war are limited, temporary, and hard to repeat. Attackers also fear\nthat digital weapons may work only once before defenders can plug the necessary\nholes. In this light, is developing a cyber war arsenal really worth it?\n\n##### 4 Conclusion\n\nIn 1972, when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was asked about the significance of\nthe French Revolution of 1789, he famously said, ‘It is too soon to say’.[11] With\nthat logic in mind, it must be noted that the Internet is still a baby, and that cyber\nattacks are still in a nascent stage. Despite the prevailing 25 May 2015 ceasefire,\nthe Russo-Ukrainian conflict is not over. Currently, it could be that neither side\nwants to escalate this somewhat localised conflict into the realm of interstate war,\nand this may inhibit operations otherwise warranted in less opaque circumstances.\nBoth parties to the conflict are still exploring their best options, and both are surely\nupgrading their traditional and digital military arsenals. Finally, it is hard to say\nwhat current cyber operations may come to light in the future. However, in mid2015, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the easy assumption that cyber\nattacks would unquestionably be used in modern warfare has come up wanting.\n\n11 Alas, one of the greatest quotes in international relations of the 20[th] century may have been misunderstood, as Chou was\nactually referring to French protests of 1968. However, a diplomat present at the time said Chou’s comment was ‘too delicious\nto invite correction.’ Dean Nicholas ‘Zhou Enlai’s Famous Saying Debunked,’ History Today, [15 June 2011, http://www.history­](http://www.historytoday.com/blog/news-blog/dean-nicholas/zhou-enlais-famous-saying-debunked)\n[today.com/blog/news-blog/dean-nicholas/zhou-enlais-famous-saying-debunked.](http://www.historytoday.com/blog/news-blog/dean-nicholas/zhou-enlais-famous-saying-debunked)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 6\n\n Revolution Hacking\n\n##### Nikolay Koval\n\n_CyS Centrum LLC_\n\n##### 1 Introduction: Cyber Conflict in Ukraine\n\nDuring Ukraine’s revolution in 2014, I served our country as the chief of its Com­\nputer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA).[1] During my tenure, we responded to\na wide variety of network security incidents. I can say with great confidence that the\nnumber and severity of cyber attacks against Ukraine rose in parallel with ongoing\npolitical events.\n\nBefore the revolution, Ukraine\n\n##### The number and severity of\n\nexperienced a fairly typical array of\nincidents, the most frequent of which _cyber attacks against Ukraine_\nwere botnet-driven[2] Distributed Denial _rose in parallel with ongoing_\nof Service (DDoS) attacks. Often, these\n\n##### political events.\n\ncame in retaliation for unpopular gov­\nernment initiatives, such as when the\n[authorities tried to shut down the file-sharing website www.ex.ua. By the end of](http://www.ex.ua)\n2012, some of the public’s frustration was channelled into politically motivated web­\nsite ‘defacements’ (i.e. digital graffiti) within the government’s Internet Protocol (IP)\nspace.\n\nIn 2013, we began to discover a much more serious class of malware. Network\nvandalism had given way to a surge in cyber espionage, for which commercial cyber\nsecurity companies developed a list of colourful names: RedOctober, MiniDuke,\nNetTraveler, and many more.\n\n1 CERT-UA lies within the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine.\n2 In other words, the botnets were large enough that no other amplification was needed.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the revolution began in February 2014, even ordinary Ukrainians became\nfamiliar with the combination of hacking and political activism, or ‘hacktivism’,\nin which the attackers seek to wage psychological war via the internet. Although\nmany people were exhausted by the momentous political events that had shaken\nour country, it was hard to ignore the publication of allegedly leaked Ukrainian\ngovernment documents detailing a secret, fascist government agenda. The most\nprominent hacktivist group was CyberBerkut,[3] and it is their most famous attack\nwhich is detailed below.\n\nIn the course of so many incident responses we learned that, with sufficient evi­\ndence, it is usually possible to understand the general nature of an attack, including\nwho the attackers might be and what they were seeking. Timing, context, victim\nidentity, and malware sophistication are good indicators. Cutting-edge spyware is\nlikely to be found on the computers of senior government officials or on important\nnetwork nodes within national critical infrastructure. For example, in one case, we\nwondered why a private sector executive had been hit, and then discovered that he\nhad previously been a high-ranking government official.\n\nIn my opinion, CERT-UA – in collaboration with network security firms such as\nKaspersky Lab, Symantec, ESET, and others – was usually able to detect, isolate, and\neliminate serious threats to network security in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, in the course of our work, we also discovered another problem that\nany enterprise today should seek to address: a fundamental lack of user understand­\ning of cyber security. At every institution, therefore, we tried to carry out a malware\n‘literacy campaign’ to teach employees how infections begin and how attackers can\nsubsequently control their computers to steal documents, all via a tiny, unautho­\nrised program that can be maddeningly difficult to find.\n\n##### 2 Case Study: Hacking a Presidential Election\n\nThe most sensational hacktivist attack took place during Ukraine’s presidential elec­\ntions. On 21 May 2014, CyberBerkut compromised the Central Election Commis­\nsion (CEC), disabling core CEC network nodes and numerous components of the\nelection system. For nearly 20 hours, the software, which was designed to display\nreal-time updates in the vote count, did not work properly. On 25 May – election\nday – 12 minutes before the polls closed (19:48 EET), the attackers posted on the\nCEC website a picture of Ukrainian Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh, incorrectly\nclaiming that he had won the election. This image was immediately shown on Rus­\nsian TV channels.\n\nIt is important to note here that this attack could in no way have determined the\noutcome of the election. In Ukraine, every citizen inks his or her vote on a real paper\n\n3 [For background on this hacker group, see Wikipedia entry ‘CyberBerkut,’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBerkut.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBerkut)\n\n\n-----\n\nballot, and all votes are manually verified. Each polling station in every corner of the\ncountry physically delivers its ballots to CEC headquarters in Kyiv for aggregation,\nreconciliation, and determination of the final tally. CEC’s information technology\n(IT) infrastructure is a complex, geographically distributed system designed for\nfault tolerance and transparency. Polling stations have an ‘anti-fraud’ design that\nallows monitors to detect anomalies such as dramatically swinging vote counts and\nreport them to the appropriate authorities. Any serious disruption during an elec­\ntion would generate immediate suspicion about its legitimacy, and spark a desire for\na new election.\n\nThat said, I believe that we should not underestimate the ability of hackers –\nespecially those that enjoy state sponsorship – to disrupt the political process of a\nnation. If CEC’s network had not been restored by 25 May, the country would sim­\nply have been unable to follow the vote count in real-time. However, to what extent\nwould that have caused citizens to question the integrity of the entire process? It is\nhard to know.\n\nCEC was not the only election-related site compromised. There were many oth­\ners, including some that were only tangentially related to Ukrainian politics when,\nfor example, the word ‘election’ had unfortunately appeared somewhere on the site.\nBut even when attacks against low-level sites were unsophisticated, and the sites\nbasically continued to function, the attackers still got the press attention they sought.\n\nThe technical aspects of this hack also\ntell us something very important: the\n\n##### The technical aspects of this\n\nhackers were professionals. Beyond dis­\nabling the site and successfully display­ _hack also tell us something_\ning incorrect election results, CERT-UA _very important: the hackers_\ndiscovered advanced cyber espionage _were professionals._\nmalware on the CEC network (Sofacy/\nAPT28/Sednit). These two aspects of the\nattack – disruption and espionage – may seem contradictory, but in fact they are\nquite complementary. Hackers must first conduct in-depth reconnaissance of a tar­\nget prior to any serious attack.\n\nTo bolster its technical credentials as an elite hacker group, CyberBerkut claimed\nto have discovered and exploited a ‘zero-day’ vulnerability in CEC’s Cisco ASA soft­\nware. In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that a non-state hacker group would pos­\nsess such a high level of technical expertise. If CyberBerkut really did exploit a zeroday, the group is likely supported by a nation-state.\n\nDuring my tenure as chief of CERT-UA, the CEC compromise was probably the\nmost technically advanced cyber attack we investigated. It was well planned, highly\ntargeted, and had some (albeit limited) real-world impact. Preparation for such an\nattack does not happen overnight; based on our analysis of Internet Protocol (IP)\nactivity, the attackers began their reconnaissance in mid-March 2014 – more than\ntwo months prior to the election. Neither does the level of required expertise sug­\n\n\n-----\n\ngest that this was the work of amateurs; at a minimum, the hackers had gained\nadministrator-level access to CEC’s network.\n\n##### 3 Conclusion: What Is to Be Done?\n\nUkraine today faces cyber security challenges on at least two fronts. First, there are\ntechnical attacks against a wide range of network infrastructure, including individ­\nual websites and whole Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These encompass every­\nthing from preoperational reconnaissance to social engineering against the target’s\nemployees. Second, there is an ongoing, content-driven information war within the\nonline media space designed to influence and deceive the public.\n\nMore serious threats lie over the horizon. In recent incident response activities\nwe have discovered samples of the most advanced forms of malware, including\nBlackEnergy2/SandWorm, Potao, Turla/Urobros, and more.\n\nIn the face of these threats, Ukraine is currently unprepared. At the strategic\nlevel, our senior officials are preoccupied with more pressing concerns. At the\ntactical level, our law enforcement agencies still fail to grasp the basic connection\nbetween email attachments, remote administrative software, and cyber espionage.\nToday, there is no unified mechanism to monitor Ukraine’s network space, which\nhinders our ability to detect cases of unauthorised access in a timely fashion.\n\nIt is time for the government of\n\n##### It is time for the govern­ Ukraine to pay greater attention to cyber\n\nsecurity.

However,\n\n##### attention to cyber security. in spite of the challenging environment,\n\nmany positive developments are taking\nplace in Ukraine, such as the recent transformation of Kyiv’s metropolitan police\nforce.[4] A similar breakthrough can take place in our cyber security domain, but\nit must begin with the allocation of funds to hire and retain the right personnel\nthrough competitive salaries and more attractive working conditions.\n\n4 [Laura Mills. ‘In Ukraine’s Capital, a New Show of Force,’ The Wall Street Journal, 6 August 2015, http://www.wsj.com/articles/](http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-ukraines-capital-a-new-show-of-force-1438903782)\n[in-ukraines-capital-a-new-show-of-force-1438903782.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-ukraines-capital-a-new-show-of-force-1438903782)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 7\n\n Cyber Operations at Maidan:\n A First-Hand Account\n\n##### Glib Pakharenko\n\n_ISACA Kyiv_\n\n##### 1 Introduction: Cyber Conflict in Ukraine\n\nI would like to tell the story of what I experienced in Ukraine from the autumn of\n2013 until the end of 2014. In this chapter, I will describe the nature and impact of\nnumerous cyber attacks that took place during our revolution and the subsequent\nconflict between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAs background, it is important to understand the strategic value of Ukraine to\nRussia. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, with over 42 million citizens and\n27 administrative divisions. In the past, its rich farmland and industrial base have\nbeen coveted by Russia, Turkey, Poland, and even by Nazi Germany. Ukraine has\nalso made significant contributions in politics; the Ukrainian Cossacks created\nthe first constitution in contemporary European history. Following the horrors of\nWorld War II, the country continued to suffer under Soviet rule until it regained its\nindependence in 1991. Despite that, Russia has never really let go of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has had internet connectivity since 1990. As everywhere else in the\nworld, it has also had its share of cyber attacks. The majority of these have come\nin the form of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) incidents against politically\nor economically targeted websites. During election seasons, for example, hackers\nhave frequently gone after the websites of political parties. In terms of cyber crime,\nUkraine has long been home to carding, mobile operator fraud, spam factories,\ncyberlockers, pirated software, unauthorized bank transfers, and various attacks on\nrival businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\nResponsibility for the enforcement of internet security in Ukraine belongs to the\nMinistry of Internal Affairs (MVS) and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).[1] Cyber\nsecurity regulations are overseen by the State Service of Special Communication and\nInformation Protection (SSSCIP),[2] but the ultimate responsibility for cyber crimes has\nnever made explicit, and in this regard there has been competition between the MVS\nand SBU. Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team was created in 2007.\n\nNational cyber security legislation is still in its nascent stages. Many of our cur­\nrent laws date from the Soviet era, and need to be updated for the information age.\nThe national critical infrastructure domain is still largely unregulated. Definitions\nrelated to ‘cyber security’ and ‘information security’ are unclear, as is the distinction\nbetween them.\n\nHistorically, the Ukrainian police have investigated straightforward cases related\nto illegal content, online gambling, and pornography. Their number of qualified\npersonnel trained in cyber security was low, with little competency in computer or\nnetwork forensics. Therefore, their most common tactic was simply to confiscate all\nIT equipment.\n\nGiven these circumstances, Ukraine is currently ill-prepared to combat advanced,\nnation-state level cyber attacks. In the future, its specialists would like to see the\narrival of more non-governmental organisation (NGO) support from the European\nUnion and United States, with a view to implementing modern best practices and\ninternationally recognised standards.\n\n##### 2 The Impact of Euromaidan\n\nThe ‘Revolution of Dignity’ in Ukraine began in late 2013 when citizens took to the\nstreets to vent their fury at the decision of then-President Viktor Yanukovych not\nto sign an agreement of political association with the European Union (EU). This\npolitical movement became known as ‘Euromaidan’ – the Ukrainian word Maidan\nmeans ‘square’ in English, and refers to the main square in the capital city, Kyiv.\n\nOn November 30, mobile phone communications were systematically shut down\nthrough mobile operators, and armed police units physically attacked the protesters.\nHowever, the population was undeterred, and by December 2, more than 500,000\npeople crowded into Maidan. The sitting government made several more attempts\nto clear the city, using gas grenades and plastic bullets, and the author personally\nsuffered a long-term injury from exposure to tear gas. The crackdown eventually led\nto the use of lethal force,[3] likely killing well over 100 protestors.[4]\n\n1 The SBU is a former constituent part to the Soviet KGB, and is still coming to terms with its legacy ideology and post-Soviet\ncorruption.\n2 The SSSCIP was a former constituent part of SBU and has since had a conflicting relationship with its former parent over its\nrole in the information security arena.\n3 The author believes that Russian Security Services took part in these killings.\n4 [‘List of people killed during Euromaidan’, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_killed_during_Euro­](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_killed_during_Euromaidan)\n[maidan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_killed_during_Euromaidan)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cyber attacks began on 2 December 2013 when it was clear that protest­\ners were not going to leave Maidan. Opposition websites were targeted by DDoS\nattacks, the majority of which came from commercial botnets employing Black­\nEnergy and Dirt Jumper malware.\nPolice confiscated mobile phones to\nacquire the protestors’ web, email, _The cyber attacks began on_\nsocial media, and financial activities. _2 December 2013 when it was_\nIn one case, pornographic images _clear that protesters were not_\nwere uploaded to a protestor’s social\n\n##### going to leave Maidan.\n\nmedia account, and were later used to\nprosecute him. Police seized comput­\ners from the opposition party’s premises, and according to one city official, the\nlighting in city hall (which had been a base of opposition activity) was switched\noff remotely, via the internet.\n\nOpposition activists also conducted cyber attacks against the Ukrainian Gov­\nernment, using tools such as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) to launch DDoS\nattacks on the President’s website. When one group of protestors entered the Minis­\ntry of Energy, the organisation sounded a ‘red alert’ at Ukrainian nuclear facilities,\ndue to the fact that the national electricity grid is remotely controlled via the inter­\nnet from headquarters.\n\nDuring this period of intense cyber attacks in Ukraine, cyber criminal organi­\nsations proactively reduced their use of the Ukrainian Internet Protocol (IP) space,\nrerouting their malware communications through Internet Service Providers (ISP)\nin Belarus and Cyprus, which meant that, for the first time in years, Ukraine was not\nlisted among the leading national purveyors of cyber crime.[5]\n\nThe largest and most sophisticated attacks coincided with the lethal shooting of\nprotestors in Maidan (February 18-20, 2014). The mobile phones of opposition par­\nliament members were flooded with SMS messaging and telephone calls in an effort\nto prevent them from communicating and coordinating defences. One precision\nattack (which targeted the protesters on only one street in Kyiv) entailed spamming\nthe IMSI catcher device on mobile phones with fake SMS messages, threatening the\nrecipient with prosecution for participation in the protest.[6]\n\nIn western Ukraine, the Government turned off the main opposition TV chan­\nnel, and when protesters decided to enter police departments, those facilities were\ndisconnected from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and internet.\n\nDespite all of these police actions, the now-radicalised protesters were unbowed,\nand continued their revolutionary campaign. Therefore, on February 22, 2014,\nUkrainian President Yanukovich fled to Russia, and a new and reformist govern­\nment was established in Kyiv.\n\n5 [HostExploit analysis, http://hostexploit.com/.](http://hostexploit.com/)\n6 This tactic has also been used by Russian military units in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3 Crimea and Donbass\n\nBy the end of April 2014, the Russian Government had responded to these events\nby occupying and annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, as well as military\nintervention in eastern Ukraine, where hostilities continue to this day.\n\nFrom the start of its Crimean operation, the Russian army moved to gain con­\ntrol of the peninsula’s telecommunications infrastructure, severing cables and rout­\ning calls through Russian mobile operators. Ukrainian media companies lost their\nphysical assets in Crimea, and local television programming shifted from Ukrainian\nto Russian channels. With physical access to its control infrastructure, Russia also\n\n\ncommandeered the Ukrainian\nnational satellite platform Lybid.\n\n##### From the start of its Crimean\n\nIn Kyiv, as soon as the Russian\n\n##### operation, the Russian army military occupied Crimea, the inter­ moved to gain control of tele­ nal security staff of one of Ukraine’s\n\nlargest mobile operators immedi­\n\n##### communications infrastructure.\n\nately demanded the severing of com­\nmunications links between Ukraine\nand the occupied territory. However, its pro-Russian management refused, and\nmaintained unrestricted connectivity as long as possible, likely so that Russian secu­\nrity services could retain access to its internal systems, for intelligence gathering and\nother information operations.\n\nUkrainian mobile operators saw an increase in the volume of cyber crime ema­\nnating from Crimea, and it is likely that Russian security services acquired intelli­\ngence from information collected in this way.\n\nPro-Russia media, discussion forums, and social network groups were active\nin propaganda dissemination. The Crimea campaign was even buttressed by mass\nchanges in Wikipedia, where Russian propaganda teams altered articles related to\nthe events taking place there.\n\nToday in Crimea, Russian authorities have implemented content filtering for\ninternet access, including the censorship of Ukrainian news sites. In November\n2014, Russia announced it would create a cyber warfare-specific military unit in\nCrimea.\n\nPro-Ukrainian hackers have attacked Crimean websites during the occupation,\nsuch as that of the Crimean Parliament[7] and a site linking to public web cameras.[8]\nThey have also released allegedly official Russian documents related to the conflict\nwhich were claimed to be stolen from Russian government servers.[9]\n\nAs the conflict shifted to Donbass, cyberspace played an increasingly import­\nant role in military operations.

In the Ukraine conflict, we have seen many dif­\nferent types of actors, tools, and tactics. Hacktivists have used the Low Orbit Ion\nCannon; criminals have used malware like Blackenergy and DirtJumper. But with\ncyber attacks, attribution and motive are not always clear, and the level of decep­\ntion is high.

To some degree, this helps to\nprovide attribution, especially when some sophisticated, persistent campaigns can\nonly be the work of nation-state actors – for reasons of mission focus, cost, and the\noverall level of operational effort required.\n\nResearchers believe, for example, that the Ouroboros/Snake malware family,\nwhich avoided detection for 8 years and actively targeted the Ukrainian Govern­\nment, has Russian origins.[18] With enough data, it is possible to see large cyber espi­\nonage campaigns that encompass many different types of targets; it is also possible\nto see that they generally work within a particular time zone, such as Moscow.[19]\nOne possible Russia-based campaign against Ukraine (and other nations), called\nSandworm, exploits advanced ‘zero-day’ vulnerabilities and targets national critical\ninfrastructure.[20] Finally, in ‘Operation Armageddon’, researchers believe that they\ntied malware activity to ongoing Russian military operations in Ukraine.[21]\n\n16 Even the pro-Russian NGO ‘Mothers of Soldiers,’ which fights the mobilization efforts of the Ukrainian army, uses spam to\ndistribute information.\n17 The breadth of the attacks included IPv6->IPv4 to bypass DDoS filters, NTP amplification, slow HTTP POST packets against\nvulnerable Apache servers, DAVOSET, and SSL renegotiation against misconfigured web servers.

In 2015, Ukrainians are still dependent on Russian web resources, including\nsocial media (Vkontakte), email (Mail.ru), search engines (Yandex), antivirus soft­\nware (Kaspersky), and much more. Our IT supply chain acquires hardware that is\neither produced in Russia or travels through Russia – this creates vulnerabilities out\nof the box, and facilitates future attacks.\n\nWhereas Russia is a world leader in cyber espionage and attack, Ukraine’s secu­\nrity services are new and inexperienced. In the current conflict with Russia, the only\noption available to Ukraine is simply a self-inflicted denial-of-service: block access\nto pro-Russian sites, remove access to Russian TV channels, limit the use of Russian\nhardware and software, ban mobile phone and social network usage for Ukrainian\nsoldiers, and sever network access with occupied eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn the future, Ukraine must modernise its cyber security legislation. One critical\naspect of that process will be transparency: it must publish proposed and new laws\non government websites so that they are easy to read and understand. In the past,\neven the few websites available were often knocked offline by hackers.\n\nThere have been many lessons learned. Here are some of the author’s personal\nrecommendations to the Ukrainian Government:\n\n  - Clear Ukrainian IP space of botnets and misconfigured servers (NTP,\n\nDNS, etc.) that facilitate cyber attacks;\n\n  - Remove illegal and pirated software from critical infrastructure and\n\npublic agencies;\n\n  - Reduce Ukraine’s IT dependency in the context of crisis scenarios;\n\n  - Implement continuity standards for media and telecoms in conflict\n\nzones;\n\n  - Create mechanisms to reliably deliver messages from the government\n\nto its citizens in occupied territories;\n\n  - Incorporate anti-DDoS solutions into Internet-facing services;\n\n  - Ensure multiple, independent routes for internet traffic between\n\nUkraine and the rest of the world;\n\n  - Implement effective filtering mechanisms on national traffic exchange\n\npoints;\n\n  - Develop a culture of continuous cyber attack monitoring, investiga­\n\ntion, information sharing, and research;\n\n  - Develop strong cyber security and cryptography capabilities across\n\nUkraine;\n\n  - Implement effective civil society controls over unauthorised intercep­\n\ntion and collection of data;\n\n  - Improve emergency data erasure and disaster recovery capabilities;\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Provide resources to military and security services to effectively con­\n\nduct large-scale cyber operations and computer forensics during their\nmissions; and\n\n  - Ensure supply chain security for IT services coming from Russia.\n\nFinally, the world should not underestimate Russia, which is seeking to re-es­\ntablish its former empire, to include Ukraine and other parts of the defunct Soviet\nUnion and Warsaw Pact. In the context of its wide-ranging political and military\ncampaigns, Russia has developed a cyber attack capability that can target national\ncritical infrastructures, via the internet, anywhere in the world.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n Beyond ‘Cyber War’: Russia’s\n Use of Strategic Cyber\n Espionage and Information\n Operations in Ukraine\n\n##### Jen Weedon\n\n_FireEye_\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\n‘Cyber attacks’ and ‘cyber war’ are all too often characterised as independent phe­\nnomena limited to the cyber domain, somehow distinct from the broader dynamics\nthat define a conflict. An analysis of cyber conflict thus far suggests that such a per­\nceived dichotomy is both inaccurate and unwise. Targeted internet-based assaults\ncannot be divorced from their underlying geopolitical contexts, and there is small\nlikelihood that a ‘cyber war’ will ever take place that is limited only to the cyber\ndomain. On the contrary, governments have been shown to use cyber tools and\ntactics as a broad instrument of statecraft, a tool for coercion, and a complement to\nkinetic forces in conflict scenarios.\n\nMoscow’s strategy in Ukraine has included _Moscow’s strategy in_\na substantial investment in espionage and\n\n##### Ukraine has included a\n\ninformation operations, relying on the success\nof integrated cyber operations and computer _substantial investment in_\nnetwork exploitation in particular. Russian _information operations._\ncyber activities have included cyber espio­\nnage, ‘prepping the battlefield’, selective telegraphing of capabilities, and some hints\nat destructive activity. Together, these operations have no doubt inexorably contrib­\nuted to Moscow’s advantages over Kyiv, both on the ground and in shaping the con­\n\n\n-----\n\nflict’s narrative in the public arena. This orchestration should come as no surprise\nto Russian security analysts, as such an integrated approach is consistent with pub­\nlished Russian military doctrine. Russian strategic thinkers do not consider ‘cyber\nwar’ (or even the prefix ‘cyber’) as a distinct concept. Rather, computer network\noperations are tools to be integrated into broader efforts to maintain political and\nmilitary dominance in a given theatre and, more broadly, in the domestic and global\ncourts of public opinion.\n\nThis chapter will ground strategic thinking on cyber conflict against the system­\natic cyber espionage that we believe Russia is leveraging in its conflict with Ukraine.\nRather than a ‘cyber war’ waged in a distinct networked domain, Russia’s strategy\nhas been to masterfully exploit the information gleaned from its worldwide com­\nputer network exploitation campaigns to inform its conduct, purposely distort pub­\nlic opinion, and maintain its dominant position in Ukraine.\n\nThe author will examine three types of interrelated Russian cyber operations\nfrom a technical and targeting perspective:\n\n1. Computer network exploitation (CNE) to gain a decisive information\n\nadvantage;\n2. ‘Prepping the battlefield’ via denial and deception; and\n3. Limited incidents of cyber disruption and destruction.\n\n##### 2 The Architecture and Artistry of\n Russia’s Strategic Information Theft\n\nSince the start of the Ukraine conflict, security companies have been increasingly\ntracking, cataloguing, and exposing sustained Russian CNE campaigns. Overall\nthese Russian cyber threat groups have consistently focused on clandestinely steal­\ning intelligence, most likely to give the Russian Government a strategic advantage.\nThe targets of these operations have repeatedly included Ukrainian, European, and\nU.S. government targets, militaries, international and regional defence and politi­\ncal organisations, think tanks, media outlets, and dissidents. While it is difficult to\nassess with certainty whether these cyber threat groups are directly tasked or sup­\nported by Moscow, there is a growing body of evidence indicating these cyber actors\nare Russia-based, and that their activities highly likely benefit Moscow.\n\nThe security community’s ability to detect, track, and ultimately expose Russian\ncyber operations seems to have improved since the Ukraine conflict began, even rel­\native to overall trends in the industry on exposing threat activity. While determining\na direct causation between the conflict in Ukraine and a seemingly marked uptick in\nobservable Russian cyber activity is challenging, the timing is certainly notable. It is\nexceedingly unlikely that Russian actors only just started conducting aggressive CNE\n\n\n-----\n\non a global scale, so why has our ability to track and expose their activity appear to\nhave improved? One reason may be that Russia’s current national security crisis has\nincreased its government’s collections requirements to state-supported hackers, which\nhas in turn accelerated the groups’ operational tempo. As a result, it may be more dif­\nficult for these actors to modify their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) on a\ntimely basis, which often results in them tipping their hand.\n\nTo shed light on how this sustained information theft is being carried out, the\nfollowing sections discuss some of the cyber tactics and compromised computer\ninfrastructure that FireEye has associated with two prominent hacker groups that\nwe believe operate from Russia, as well as a summary list of CNE-related activity\nthat is likely being used to give Moscow a geopolitical and military advantage.\n\n##### 3 APT29 (‘Advanced Persistent Threat’[1] Group 29)\n\nAPT29 is a sophisticated and highly capable _APT29 is a highly capa­_\nRussian cyber espionage group with a diverse,\n\n##### ble Russian cyber espio­\n\nconstantly evolving toolset, and talented oper­\nators. The group maintains a globally dispersed _nage group with a con­_\nand intricate attack infrastructure that doubt­ _stantly evolving toolset._\nless requires substantial resources to maintain.\nAPT29’s tools often leverage legitimate web services for malware command and\ncontrol mechanisms, which can make them more difficult to detect because they\nappear to be benign communications at first glance.\n\n**_3.1 APT29’s Targets: Consistent with Russian State Interests_**\nAPT29 typically targets entities to steal information that is closely linked to Rus­\nsian geopolitical interests and priorities. The group’s recent operations suggest it\nis particularly focused on targets of intelligence value that are related to the Rus­\nsia-Ukraine crisis and related policy responses. This includes: western governments\n(particularly foreign policy and defence-related targets); international security and\nlegal institutions; think tanks; and educational institutions.\n\nAPT29 usually compromises its victims via socially engineered spear phishing\nemails– either with malicious email attachments, or through a link to download a\nmalicious file from a compromised website. The group’s decoy documents (‘lures’)\noften topically align with their targets’ interests and work subject matter; this social\nengineering technique is common and can be very effective. APT29 has also been\nknown to re-purpose and weaponise legitimate documents or information stolen\nfrom its previously compromised networks. Example lure topics from legitimate\nsources include content related to European Union sanctions on Russia, a voicemail\n\n1 We refer to groups that we assess have a nexus to state sponsorship as ‘Advanced Persistent Threat,’ or ‘APT’ groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nattachment sent from a reporter to a think tank scholar who writes on Russia-Ukraine\nissues,[2] a PDF report on terrorism, and discussions related to Caucasus regional\ndevelopment and democratisation.[3] APT29 has also used less tailored and pop cul­\nture-themed approaches, such as a faked e-fax, and videos of ‘Office Monkeys’.[45]\n\n**_3.2 APT29’s Tools and Infrastructure: the Work of Professionals_**\nThe complex nature of APT29’s malware and infrastructure (requiring significant\nfinancial resources and expertise for upkeep), combined with its operational secu­\nrity practices and target sets strongly suggests some level of Russian state sponsor­\nship. Its typical work hours (as defined by active operations in networks the group\nhas compromised) fall within the UTC+3 time zone, which aligns to the time zones\nof Moscow and St. Petersburg. Furthermore, APT29 has been known to temporarily\nhalt its operations on Russian holidays.[6]\n\nAPT29 has been highly active throughout 2015, employing new data theft tools\nas well as pursuing new targets for stealing information. To maintain operational\nsecurity, APT29 often configures its malware to activate only at predetermined\ntimes, and is adept at using misdirection and obfuscation TTPs[7] that hinder reverse\nengineering and other means of analysis. One complicated APT29 backdoor, HAM­\nMERTOSS, is highly capable of evading detection, particularly by its ability to mimic\nthe behaviour of legitimate users.[8] HAMMERTOSS accomplishes this stealthiness\nby leveraging commonly visited websites and web services to relay commands and\nsteal data from victims. The tool works by:\n\n  - Checking in and retrieving commands via legitimate web services,\n\nsuch as Twitter and GitHub;\n\n  - Using compromised web servers for command and control (C2);\n\n  - Visiting different Twitter handles daily and automatically;\n\n  - Using timed starts, such as communicating only after a specific date or\n\nonly during the victim’s workweek;\n\n  - Obtaining commands via images containing hidden and encrypted\n\ndata (steganography); and\n\n  - Extracting information from a compromised network by uploading\n\nfiles to commonly used cloud storage services.[9]\n\n2 ‘The Connections Between MiniDuke, CosmicDuke and OnionDuke.’ January 7, 2015.

Security researchers believe its malware is\nwritten in a Russian language development environment, and that it has been sys­\ntematically updating its tools, some of which are also able to target mobile devices[13]\nsince 2007.\n\nOne way to appreciate the sophisticated nature of APT28 is through its exploita­\ntion of ‘zero-day’ vulnerabilities; that is, previously undiscovered and unpatched\nvulnerabilities. For example, in early 2015, APT28 likely exploited two zero-day vul­\nnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows in an attack against a govern­\nment contractor.[14] In a separate incident in July 2015, APT28 rapidly integrated into\nits operations multiple zero-day vulnerabilities exposed in the highly public breach\nof the Italian exploit dealer Hacking Team.[15]\n\n10 [‘Duke APT group’s latest tools: cloud services and Linux support.’ July 22, 2015.](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002822.html) _[F-Secure. https://www.f-secure.com/we­](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002822.html)_\n[blog/archives/00002822.html; Kurt Baumgartner, Costin Raiu. ‘The CozyDuke APT.’ Kaspersky Lab.

Multiple cyber\n\n##### based on consistent taskings.\n\nespionage campaigns ongoing across the\nglobe since at least 2007 (and no doubt\nmuch earlier) has probably given these actors a considerable information advan­\ntage. A few examples are as follows.\n\nIn September 2015, Kaspersky Labs published research exposing multiple Rus­\nsian APT groups ‘using and abusing’ satellite-based internet links (particularly\nIP addresses in Middle Eastern and African countries) to hide their operational\ncommand and control. This infrastructure likely enables a high degree of oper­\national security. One of the groups using this tactic is the same group behind\nthe Snake/Uroburos/Turla malware, thought to be related to the infamous Agent.\nBTZ, which was used to penetrate U.S. military networks as early as 2008. Kasper­\nsky’s report outlined a specific campaign targeting government, embassies, mili­\n\n\n-----\n\ntary entities, universities, research organisations, and pharmaceutical companies\nworldwide.[16]\n\nIn August 2015, a group of security researchers described the enterprise-like\neffort behind the Gameover ZeuS malware and its prolific and FBI-sought author\nEvgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev (a.k.a. ‘Slavik’). The malware was used to facilitate\nboth cyber crime and espionage. Further, the researchers discovered commands in\nthe malware indicating that the actors sought to gather classified information from\nvictims in Ukraine, Georgia, and Turkey,[17] suggesting a link between Russia’s cyber\ncrime syndicates and government espionage actors.\n\nIn late 2014, researchers exposed a long-active Russian group called ‘Sandworm,’\nwhose victims included NATO, the Ukrainian Government, EU governments,\nenergy and telecommunications firms, and an American academic organisation.\nThe group used zero-day exploits and infected victims through a variety of means\nincluding malicious PowerPoint attachments and the BlackEnergy toolkit.[18]\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, actors using the Snake/Uroburos/Turla malware tar­\ngeted Ukrainian computer systems in dozens of cyber operations launched by ‘com­\nmitted and well-funded professionals’.[19] This malware is highly complex, reistant to\ncountermeasures, and thought to have been created in 2005.[20]\n\nSince 2013, ‘Operation Armageddon’ – a Russian cyber espionage campaign\nallegedly targeting Ukrainian government, law enforcement, and military officials\n– has likely helped provide a military advantage to Russia vis-à-vis Ukraine from\nsecrets systematically gathered from cyber espionage.[ 21]\n\nIn 2012, suspected Russian actors reportedly used the Wipbot and Snake backdoors\nfor long-term cyber espionage. The actors leveraged legitimate (but compromised) web­\nsites to systematically deliver malware, particularly to victims in Eastern Europe.[22]\n\n##### 6 Prepping the Battlefield\n\nThe cyber espionage activity previously described entails the penetration and\nexploitation of networks in order to steal sensitive information.

Therefore, today’s map might\nnot be good tomorrow, which is why Russian malware implants like HAMMER­\nTOSS are designed to sustain clandestine access.\n\n**_6.1 Preparing for Attack?_**\nIs Russia preparing for future cyber attacks on Western critical infrastructure? This\nis difficult to prove, but the Sandworm group has reportedly targeted supervisory\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment, which is used in industrial and\ncritical infrastructure settings, with the BlackEnergy toolkit.[26] The victims were pro­\nduction systems, not vendor-owned prototypes or systems that contained financial\ninformation, intellectual property, or political intelligence. Given the targets seemed\nto be production systems, there would likely be no benefit from an espionage per­\nspective to infect these systems. Rather, the actors using the malware may have been\nlooking for weaknesses to exploit in a future disruptive scenario. In addition, the\nuse of a crimeware toolkit offers a degree of anonymity or plausible deniability for\nactors with more destructive purposes.\n\n23 Jen Weedon and Jacqueline Stokes. ‘Security in an Era of Coercive Attacks.’ FireEye Executive Perspectives Blog.

One of the more\nremarkable incidents this year included APT28’s possible use of false flag operation\nagainst a French TV station.\n\nIn April 2015, hackers claiming to be the Islamic State-affiliated ‘Cyber Caliph­\nate’ hacked France’s _TV5 Monde channel, shutting off transmissions for eighteen_\nhours, and posting Islamic State propaganda on the _TV5 Monde’s_ Facebook and\nTwitter accounts. The attack also apparently resulted in significant damage to the\nchannel’s broadcasting infrastructure.[28]\n\nThis incident generated enormous publicity and speculation over Cyber Caliph­\nate’s apparently growing capabilities and intent. However, technical analysis of the\nattackers’ network infrastructure (such as the IP block hosting the Cyber Caliphate’s\nwebsite, its server, and registrar)[29] as well as some other sensitive source reporting\nrelated to the malware used suggests that Russia’s APT28 was in fact the more likely\nperpetrator of this attack. French Police concurred with this conclusion, stating\n‘Russian hackers linked to the Kremlin’ may have been responsible’.[30] In a similar\nvein, The _New York Times reported that a Russian organisation known as the ‘Inter­_\nnet Research Agency’ had conducted systematic online trolling and hoaxes in the\nU.S., including a spoofed Islamic State attack against a Louisiana chemical plant on\nthe anniversary of 9/11.[31]\n\nIf APT28 (or another Russian hacker group) conducted these attacks, what were\ntheir motivations? There are a number of plausible scenarios, including:\n\n  - Russian actors may have been displeased at TV5 Monde coverage of\n\nthe Ukraine conflict, and this was an act of retribution;\n\n  - Russian actors wanted to distract attention from the Kremlin’s actions\n\nin Ukraine by shifting the focus of Western national security planners\nto the Islamic State;\n\n27 Roland Heickerö. ‘Emergin Cyber Threats and Russian Views on Information Warfare and Information Operations.’ FOI,\nSwedish Defence Research Agency.

However, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU)\nremoved the malware and replaced the election software prior to the\nvote.[37]\n\nOutside of these limited publicly reported incidents, it appears that the Kremlin\nhas either not needed or not chosen to engage in extensive overt CNA during this\nconflict. One reason for this could be that Moscow wants to avoid the international\ncriticism that followed its alleged cyber operations in the 2008 war in Georgia, and\nin Estonia in 2007. Instead, Moscow seems to be using more narrowly focused, lim­\nited operations in support of strategic state objectives, primarily via sustained cyber\nespionage rather than widespread attacks.\n\n##### 9 Information War, Not Cyber War\n\nIn the Russia-Ukraine conflict, computer network operations have not been limited\nto trite notions of ‘cyber war.’ Rather, an examination of the sustained tensions sug­\ngests that this has been a war waged with and by the strategic theft and manipulation\nof information, and not extensive application of destructive cyber attacks.

In this sense, such behaviour\nwill no doubt continue, and it remains of the utmost important to anticipate and\ndefend against this activity, both for short-term network security and for long-term\ninternational stability.\n\n\n37 ‘‘Cyber-attack’ cripples Ukraine’s electronic election system ahead of presidential vote.’ RT.

The Ukrainian crisis seemed\nlike the perfect case study to explore how states use non-state actors and their capa­\nbilities. The findings confirmed some of my assumptions but also revealed some\nsurprises. This article outlines what I learned during the trip based on interviews\nwith 11 individuals including current and former government officials, private sec­\ntor representatives, security researchers, and Eugene Dokukin, the ‘commander’ of\nthe Ukrainian Cyber Forces, in addition to a review of existing literature.[1]\n\nTo start, the crisis in Ukraine has several ingredients that appear to make the use\nof proxies by a state likely, namely (1) an ongoing hot conflict, fuelling (2) incentives\nfor the state to use proxy capabilities and (3) significant capabilities residing outside\nof but available to the state. With regard to the second, this includes the general\npolitical incentive to be able to claim plausible deniability as well as incentives for\nthe state to augment its own capabilities by adding those provided by non-state\nactors.\n\nIt is also helpful to distinguish between two dimensions when analysing proxy\nactors to ensure greater analytical clarity. First, analysing proxy actors is part of the\nbroader academic inquiry into the governance of violence best described by the title\n\n1 [‘Cyber warrior steps up effort to help in war with Russia,’ KyivPost, February 10, 2015, http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/cyber-warrior-steps-up-effort-to-help-in-war-with-russia-380184.html?flavour=mobile)\n[post-plus/cyber-warrior-steps-up-effort-to-help-in-war-with-russia-380184.html?flavour=mobile.](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/cyber-warrior-steps-up-effort-to-help-in-war-with-russia-380184.html?flavour=mobile)\n\n\n-----\n\nof Deborah Avant’s seminal book The _Market for Force – The Consequences of Privat­_\n_izing Security. In that book, Avant investigates the market for force and the role of_\npublic and private actors including proxies.[2] The second, narrower dimension focuses\non proxy actors used ‘to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.[3] This is\nthe language used in the most recent report of the Group of Governmental Experts\n(GGE) that is leading the international community’s global cybersecurity norms effort\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. Unlike the first dimension which examines\nproxy actors more broadly including those that are used by states for defensive pur­\nposes, this second lens is about proxy actors used to cause harm to another party.\n\nThis short chapter will look at both private actors involved in the general pro­\nvision of security for the benefit of the state, and private actors using force against\na third party to the benefit of the state, but will focus on the latter. The first section\noutlines in greater detail the conditions present in the region assumed to contribute\nto the existence of proxy actors. The second part describes the proxy actors that are\npublicly known to have been active during the crisis.\n\n##### 2 The Making of a Hot Conflict\n\nThe hot conflict between Ukraine and Russia was the result of simmering political ten­\nsion that escalated in November 2013, when former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanu­\nkovych abandoned plans to sign a trade agreement with the EU. Yanukovych’s deci­\n\nsion incited mass protests that were met\n\n##### Long before Yanukovych’s with a violent government crackdown.

This period was characterised by low-level hacking targeting highly\nvisible websites, either rendering them unavailable or changing their content.\n\nOn February 28, shortly after Yanukovych left the country, unmarked soldiers, that\nRussia’s President Putin later acknowledged[4] to be Russian troops, seized a military\nairfield in Sevastopol and Simferopol international airport.

At the same time, the Government benefits\nfrom its activities with or without its involvement. For the Ukrainian Government,\nanother set of incentives is arguably more important than the political ones: its own\nlimited capabilities, and the possibility to rely on proxy actors to augment these\ncapabilities in the face of a much more powerful opponent.\n\nThe Russian Government is considered to be among the most sophisticated\nactors with significant in-house cyber capabilities,[11] and the government in Ukraine\nfaced a dire situation at the beginning of the conflict. Its military had essentially\nbeen falling apart since the end of the Soviet Union and Kyiv was ill-prepared for a\nconflict with Russia. As Dmitry Gorenburg points out:\n\n_‘At the time of its creation, the Ukrainian military was considered the fourth_\n_most powerful conventional military force in the world, behind only the United_\n_States, Russia, and China. However, these forces were allowed to atrophy_\n_throughout the post-Soviet period, with virtually no funding provided for the_\n_maintenance of equipment or troop training. Reforms were not carried out and_\n_there were no attempts at rearmament to replace aging Soviet equipment’.[12]_\n\nThe responses from several interviewees confirmed this assessment.\n\n##### 4 Capabilities Outside the State\n\nIn order for a state to be able to pursue the incentives of using proxy actors, private\nactor capabilities must exist in the first place. With regard to cyberspace, such capa­\nbilities include those present within a state’s territory and beyond. Regarding the\nformer, significant capabilities have been present in Ukraine and Eastern Europe\nsince the 1980s. Misha Glenny, the award-winning journalist, recounts in his 2011\nbook Dark Market – How Hackers Became the New Mafia that:\n\n_‘The hackers of Eastern Europe played a particularly important role in crack­_\n_ing security devices played on software…Bulgaria, Ukraine and Russia set the_\n_pace, with the Romanians not far behind.’[13]_\n\n10 ‘Ukraine’s Lonely Cyberwarrior vs. Russia,’ _The Daily Beast, February 18, 2015, http://www.thedailybeast.com/arti­_\ncles/2015/02/18/ukraine-s-lonely-cyber-warrior.html.\n11 [‘Russia Tops China as Principal Cyber Threat to US,’ The Diplomat, March 3, 2015, http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/russia-](http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/russia-tops-china-as-principal-cyber-threat-to-us/)\n[tops-china-as-principal-cyber-threat-to-us/.](http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/russia-tops-china-as-principal-cyber-threat-to-us/)\n12 [Dmitry Gorenburg. ‘Russia and Ukraine: Not the Military Balance You Think,’ War on the Rocks, November 10, 2015, http://](http://warontherocks.com/2014/11/russia-and-ukraine-not-the-military-balance-you-think/)\n[warontherocks.com/2014/11/russia-and-ukraine-not-the-military-balance-you-think/.](http://warontherocks.com/2014/11/russia-and-ukraine-not-the-military-balance-you-think/)\n13 Misha Glenny.

For\nexample, a job in the Ukrainian Government for somebody in his 20s pays roughly\n$3,000 – a year, not a month. And while Samsung has one of its largest R&D centres in\nKyiv, the private IT industry is neither large nor attractive enough to absorb all of the\nskilled labour, unlike in Israel, for example.[15] Interestingly, ‘CarderPlanet was penetrated\nand compromised by the Russian Secret Police almost as soon as it was set up’ but:\n\n_‘why would the KGB waste resources on investigating networks that are ripping_\n_off American and European credit cards? A complete waste of time. So for the_\n_moment, Moscow was content to observe and store information. They knew_\n_exactly who was who in the Odessa carding community’.[16]_\n\nYet, it was not only the FSB that knew what was happening in Eastern European\ncountries. In 2009, Brian Krebs, an expert on cybercrime in the region and widely\nread not only by law enforcement officials in the U.S. but also Ukraine, wondered:\n\n_‘whether authorities in those countries would be any more willing to pursue_\n_cyber crooks in their own countries if they were forced to confront just how_\n_deeply those groups have penetrated key government and private computer_\n_networks in those regions?’_\n\nAn example is Dmitry Ivanovich Golubov, once considered a top cybercrime\nboss by U.S. law enforcement, but now a leader of the Ukrainian Internet Party\nparticipating in parliamentary elections. Russian agencies reportedly provide little\nassistance with shutting down networks such as the Russian Business Network. Last\nbut not least, cyber criminals also do their best to avoid attracting local law enforce­\nment attention. As Krebs notes:\n\n_‘Some of the most prolific and recognizable malware disbursed by Russian and_\n_East European cyber crime groups purposefully avoids infecting computers if_\n_the program detects the potential victim is a native resident.’[17]_\n\nIn sum, there is no shortage in the region of labour skilled in information tech­\nnology and hacking, while a mature industry is missing, and government salaries of\na few thousand dollars a year pale in comparison to reports of thousands or millions\nof dollars made in the latest cyber heist.\n\n14 Misha Glenny.

The\nsecond is that the amount of cyber proxy activity has remained relatively low.\nThere are two likely explanations for this: there has been a relatively low number\nof significant cyber incidents associated with the conflict other than during its\ninitial phase as described above; and while there was clearly a significant wave\nof patriotism and willingness by Ukrainian citizens to volunteer and support the\ngovernment, several interviewees suggested that the government in Kyiv did not\nhave the ability to absorb and coordinate these extra capacities. In other words, to\ndraw from the political science literature on power, while significant cyber power\nresources in the hands of private actors existed, the Ukrainian Government was\nnot able to effectively mobilise these resources to actually project power. Kyiv’s\ncyber power was inhibited by a lack of what Alexander Klimburg calls ‘integrated\nnational capability’.[18]\n\nThirdly, the conflict does not appear to have mobilised the most sophisti­\ncated non-state actors with cyber capabilities in the region – the cybercriminals\n\n– to change their profit-driven behaviour\nto more politically-driven action. While the\n\n##### Once cybercriminals real­\n\nconflict apparently politicised and led to a\n\n##### ised that their spat started split of the criminal underground commu­ to affect business, ‘money nity in the autumn of 2014, the effect was trumped politics’. ephemeral and once the cybercriminals\n\nrealised that their spat started to affect their\nbusiness, ‘money trumped politics’, according to Konstatin Korsun, head of coun­\ncil at the NGO Ukrainian Information Security Group and director at the private\ncybersecurity company Berezha Security.[19]\n\nA closer look reveals a range of proxy actors has been active. In the context of\na broader analysis of the market for force, it is notable that the crisis in Ukraine\ndemonstrated that cybersecurity is a domain where private actors possess signifi­\ncant capabilities and are used by states for both defensive and offensive purposes.\nFor example, the limited capabilities of the Ukrainian Government have been aug­\nmented through NATO assistance, namely its Cyber Defence Trust Fund, to train\nand improve Ukraine’s cyber defences. Interestingly, the lead NATO member pro­\nviding that assistance, Romania, has itself not been providing this assistance directly\nthrough its government, but is relying on a proxy actor, a state-owned company\ncalled Rasirom, to provide the service.[20]\n\n18 Joseph S.

These groups include proKyiv OpRussia, Russian CyberCommand (which considers itself to be part of Anon­\nymous),[21] Cyber Ukrainian Army, Cyber Hundred, Null Sector,[22] and the pro-Mos­\ncow CyberBerkut and Anonymous Ukraine.[23] Their activities have been limited to\nDDoS attacks, web defacements, and the occasional leaking of government files.\nThe most serious incident involved the aforementioned targeting of the Ukrainian\nvoting system during the Ukrainian Presidential election. While Ukrainian govern­\nment officials and many news reports blame the Russian Government for indirectly\norchestrating these operations, as well as for the crude ‘hack attacks’ on Ukrainian\nstate websites, the Russian Government has vehemently denied accusations that it\nhas any influence over these groups. Evidence for a relationship between pro-Rus­\nsian separatists or hacker groups such as Cyber Berkut and the Russian Government\nremains lacking.\n\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Force has been among the most prominent Ukrainian\nhacktivist groups. It is led by Eugene Dokukin and a group of volunteers he recruited\nthrough social media, whose number has fluctuated from several dozens to a few\nhundred, and primarily includes ordinary citizens without a technical background.[24]\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Force combines a series of different activities, ranging from\nthe unauthorised monitoring of CCTV cameras in eastern Ukraine and Russia, to\nreporting troop and separatist activities to web companies in an effort to shut down\ntheir accounts, launching DDoS attacks against websites, and leaking sensitive doc­\numents from the Russian Government. While Dokukin has given a series of inter­\nviews and shares information about his actions with the media and the government,\nthere is no evidence that the government coordinates or supports him financially or\notherwise. Instead, the government has been turning a blind eye.\n\nRelated to the conflict in Ukraine are the findings of several industry reports.\nThe U.S.-based security company FireEye published a report titled ‘APT28: A Win­\n_dow into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?’, detailing the activities of a group_\nconducting political espionage against East European countries and security organ­\nisations.

The authors highlight that in 2014, malware named BlackEnergy, originally_\ndeveloped and used for criminal profit-driven purposes, was deployed against gov­\nernment organisations in Ukraine by a group the report calls ‘Quedagh’. The report\nconcludes by stating that:\n\n_‘the use of BlackEnergy for a politically-oriented attack is an intriguing conver­_\n_gence of criminal activity and espionage. As the kit is being used by multiple_\n_groups, it provides a greater measure of plausible deniability than is afforded by_\n_a custom-made piece of code.’_ [26]\n\n##### 6 Conclusion\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine includes a range of proxy actors and proxy activity. This should\nbe expected given the existence of a hot conflict, the presence of significant cyber capa­\nbilities in private hands, and incentives for the nations involved to use these private\ncapabilities. However, the amount of cyber proxy activity has remained relatively low,\nmuch like the overall level of computer network operations compared to what some\nexperts predicted. It is notable that the conflict does not appear to have politicised and\nmobilised the most sophisticated non-state actors with cyber capabilities – the cyber­\ncriminals – to change their profit-driven behaviour to more politically-driven action.\nMoreover, the Ukrainian Government has not had the capacity and strategy in place to\nbe able to absorb the additional capabilities provided by volunteers. Kyiv has therefore\nnot been able to mobilise and project the full potential of Ukraine’s power due to the\nlimited use of its true power resources. While the Ukrainian Government regularly\naccuses the Russian Government of using proxies, there seems to be less vehemence\nfrom the Russian side criticising, for example, the activities of the Ukrainian Cyber\nForces. According to one interviewee, one explanation is that the Russian Govern­\nment has more to gain from being able to point to the existence of Ukrainian proxies\nin order to thereby indirectly legitimise the existence of Russian proxies.\n\nWhile this chapter hopefully shed some light on the role of proxy actors in the\nUkraine conflict, it is necessary to point to some important limitations and issues\nthat were beyond the scope of this short piece. First, the term ‘proxies’ lacks a clear\ndefinition. While it is used in the GGE report, it is not defined, even though the\nreport distinguishes ‘proxies’ as a separate type of actor from state and non-state\nactors. Developing a more systematic and nuanced analytical framework for proxies\nis therefore the focus of my current research. This will hopefully be useful for future\nempirical research on proxy actors around the world, as well as for ongoing policy\ndiscussions through the GGE and elsewhere.\n\n26 ‘The convergence of crimeware and APT attacks,’ _[F-Secure, 2014, https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/blackenergy_whitepaper.pdf)_\n[blackenergy_whitepaper.pdf.](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/blackenergy_whitepaper.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 10\n\n Russian Information\n Warfare: Lessons\n from Ukraine\n\n##### Margarita Levin Jaitner\n\n_Swedish Defense University_\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\n‘Information is now a species of weapon’,[1] write Russians Maj. Gen. (R) Ivan Vorob­\nyev and Col. (R) Valery Kiselyov. Closer to the truth is that Russia has a long history\nof using information as a weapon – both in the context of mobilising its own popu­\nlation[2] and in demonising foreign powers.[3]\n\nTherefore, it is only natural that Russia has employed Information Warfare (IW)\nin Ukraine: from the onset of the ‘Euromaidan’ demonstrations, to the annexation\nof Crimea, and as a dimension of ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine.\nAnd it is equally unsurprising that, in the internet era, Moscow has developed effec­\ntive tactics for waging IW in cyberspace.\n\nThis chapter discusses contemporary Russian IW theory and analyses Russian\nIW activities on the ground in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine. While the dynamic\nand diffuse nature of IW makes it difficult to gauge its precise impact, this chap­\nter argues that Russian IW in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine has been highly\nsuccessful, and that the West is currently playing catch up vis-à-vis Russia in this\narena.\n\n1 Vorobyov, I. and Kiseljov, V. ‘Russian Military Theory: Past and Present.’ Military Thought 2013 (3).\n2 Peter Kenez.

This was true well before the advent of the internet\nand cyberspace – which have not changed Russian IW strategy, but only its tactics.\n\nIn the West, cyber security and information security are considered to be two\ndifferent things. In Russia, however, cyber is subordinate to information security,\nwhich allows national security planners to oversee both technical data (e.g. the\nintegrity of password files) and cognitive data (e.g. political information on web­\nsites). Thus, any information found on the World Wide Web could be a ‘missile’\nfired at Russia that is more dangerous than a typical cyber attack as currently under­\nstood in the West.\n\nThe logical consequence of this Russian perspective is to define and to protect\nthe borders of the Russia’s ‘information space’ (информационное пространство),\nand this philosophy is to be found easily in Russian doctrines, strategies, and activ­\nities both at home and abroad – including in Ukraine.\n\nFor example, Russia’s National Security Strategy 2020 states that ‘nationalist, sep­\naratist, radical religion’ is a danger to nation-states, and that a ‘global information\nstruggle’ is now intensifying. The document proposes to counter this threat by dis­\nseminating ‘truthful’ information to Russian citizens, including via the promotion\nof native internet platforms encompassing social media.[4]\n\nAs for the importance of cyberspace, numerous official documents describe\ncomputer network operations as an integral part of Russian information security,\n\nincluding: _Information Security Doc­_\n\n##### Information superiority in trine of the Russian Federation,[5] Con­\n\n_ceptual Views Regarding the Activities_\n\n##### cyberspace is an essential goal.\n\n_of the Armed Forces of the Russian Fed­_\n_eration in the Information Space,[6] and_\n_Basic Principles for State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of International_\n_Information Security.[7]_\n\nAcademic discourse within the Russian military is similar. From a historical per­\nspective, progress in computer science has wrought a new generation of warfare in\nwhich the achievement of information superiority in cyberspace is an essential goal.\nWithin any desired zone of influence, this includes attacks against and defence of\n\n4 Security Council of the Russian Federation.

(R) _will to resist._\nSergei Chekinov and Lt. Gen. (R) Sergei\nBogdanov go even further: ‘Today the means of information influence reached such\nperfection that they can tackle strategic tasks’.[9]\n\nCheckinov and Bogdanov point out – in the aftermath of the annexation of\nCrimea and the current destabilisation of Ukraine – that information can be used\nto disorganise governance, organise anti-government protests, delude adversaries,\ninfluence public opinion, and reduce an opponent’s will to resist. Furthermore, it\nis critical that such activities begin prior to the onset of traditional military opera­\ntions.[10]\n\nAt least since Soviet times, Russia considers itself to be a victim of IW, engaged in\na battle between the ‘historical Russian world’ (of which Ukraine is a part) and the\nWest where the US is its principal antagonist.[11] Professor Igor Panarin has described\na ‘first information war’ during the Cold War that resulted in the demise of the Soviet\nUnion. Today, he sees an ‘Operation ANTI-PUTIN’ modelled on an earlier ‘Opera­\ntion ANTI-STALIN’. He contends that Western IW was behind both the Arab Spring[12]\nand Euromaidan, and that WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange is an agent of the British MI6.[13]\nPanarin believes there is a ‘second information war’ taking place against countries\nsuch as Russia and Syria which began at least by the time of the Russo-Georgian war\nin 2008.[14] Russian President Vladimir Putin has characterised the rift between Russia\nand the West as an incompatibility of values («духовные ценности»).[15]\n\nPanarin is far from being the only contemporary Russian military thinker argu­\ning this line. A group of five authors recently wrote in Russia’s Military Thought that\n‘The NATO countries led by the US … have set up a powerful information opera­\ntions (IO) system and are going on expanding and improving it’.[16]\n\n8 Vorobyov and Kiseljov ‘Russian Military Theory: Past and Present.’ Military Thought, 2013 (3).\n9 Sergei G.

In Crimea, the entire course of events – from the takeover of\nthe Simferopol parliament to the disputed referendum and the Russian annexation\nof Crimea – was enveloped in a sophisticated effort to control the flow of informa­\ntion. Russian IW extended across the entire spectrum of communication in both\nthe cyber and non-cyber domains, targeting its physical, logical, and social layers.\n\nIn early March, Ukrtelecom reported kinetically damaged fiber-optic trunk cables,\nas well as the temporary seizure of its company’s offices. Further disclosures detailed\nthe jamming of Ukrainian naval communications.[30] SBU Chief Valentyn Nalyvaic­\nhenko declared that Ukrainian government officials’ mobile communications were\nsubjected to an ‘IP-telephonic attack’.[31] And on the World Wide Web, government sites\nand news portals suffered Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and deface­\nments – all of which contributed to a significant information blackout.[32],[33]\n\nThe ‘hacktivist’ group Cyberberkut[34] has repeatedly claimed to have gained access\nto telephone recordings and e-mail correspondence between Ukrainian, European\nUnion (EU) and US officials – and released some content to prove it. Cyberberkut\nalso allegedly attacked the Ukrainian electronic voting system and defaced several\nNATO websites.[35]\n\nThe importance of gaining information superiority in warfare can be seen in\nhow much time and resources have been spent in creating official, semi-official,\nand unofficial sources of war-related information, including dedicated channels on\nYouTube.[36]\n\nThe success of IW is hard to gauge, but these attacks likely made it more difficult\nfor Kyiv to gain a clear picture of what was happening in Crimea – which in turn\npresumably hampered its decision-making process. Even unsophisticated cyber\nattacks tend to generate significant media attention, and as a bonus can sow general\ndistrust in systems and their security architecture.[37]\n\n27 Sergey Shoigy. 2014. ‘Шойгу о российской технике в Крыму: ‘чушь и провокация’.

On 17 April, 2014, Vladimir Putin referred to the south-eastern part\nof Ukraine as _Novorossiya, and a similarly named ‘confederation’ was formally_\ncreated on May 24, 2014.[41] However, an analysis of web data shows that cyber\npreparations were made prior to this announcement: Novorossiya websites such\nas novorus.info and novorossia.su were registered with who.is in March 2014,\nand the official websites of the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk were\nregistered before the entities came into being.[42] Finally, Moscow has consistently\ndenied that its military personnel are engaged in Ukraine, but web-based studies\nhave found evidence of their deployments to Ukraine[43] as well as their involve­\nment in the crash of the Malaysian Airlines flight 17,[44] via social media and imag­\nery analysis.[45]\n\n##### 4 The Unique Characteristics of Russian IW\n\nThe Russian political narrative – aimed at both domestic and foreign audiences –\ndescribes a ‘Russian World’ (Русский Мир), ‘Russian values’, and even a ‘Russian\nsoul’. The narrative’s articulation begins at the very top, in the person of Vladimir\nPutin, and flows downward in a pyramidal fashion through traditional media and\ncyberspace all the down to the grassroots level. It targets not just Russian citizens but\nthe entire Russian-speaking population of planet Earth. Beyond that, it is expected\nthat the narrative’s influence will organically spread outside the diaspora.\n\nThe basic storyline is easy to comprehend and to convey, and is intended to be\nbecome a foundation for the interpretation of current and future world events. In\nthis narrative, Russia is a misunderstood and misjudged superpower, and a neces­\nsary counterweight to Western liberal values. By contrast, the West has experienced\n\n38 [‘Information Resistance’ is, according to its own description on http://sprotyv.info/en/about-us, a non-governmental project](http://sprotyv.info/en/about-us)\nthat aims to counteract external threats to the informational space of Ukraine’. The group provides operational data and analyt­\nics. As one of the project’s front figures, Dmitry Tymchuk has provided analysis to, amongst others, Kyiv Post and Huffington\nPost.\n39 [Dimitro Tymchuk. ‘О предательстве (On betrayal).’ Gazeta.ua, March 2014. http://gazeta.ua/ru/blog/42707/o-predatelstve.](http://gazeta.ua/ru/blog/42707/o-predatelstve)\n40 Yuzhniy Kurier. ‘Все.

As a\nresult, the West’s philosophy, systems, and actions should not be trusted.\n\nAt the bottom of the pyramid, the Russian political narrative is absorbed into\nindividual group ideologies in different ways. For example, nationalists focus on\nRussia’s historic power, while communist groups decry capitalism. Each group\nself-selects and customises the narrative in unique ways that correspond to their\nown natural biases. And this stovepiping dynamic also tends to bypass critical peer\nreview from the wider public.\n\nThis group dynamic capitalises on the pre-established interpersonal trust charac­\nteristic of online social media – a by-product of information overload in the internet\nera. There are many groups which are naturally sceptical of mainstream information\nchannels, such as the population of the Former Soviet Union, where citizens have\nlong had little trust in official media. In Moscow, the word of friends and colleagues\nis immeasurably more important than that of mass media.[46]\n\nOne of the latest developments in this arena has been the rise of professional\n‘trolls’ and other (sometimes anonymous) ‘opinion agents’. Such operations (in Rus­\nsian military terminology ‘maskirovka’ (маскировка), or denial and deception) can\nbe countered through the effective analysis of open source information, but usu­\nally not in a timely manner. Therefore, analysts and scholars must exercise caution,\nbecause online persona, images, messages, and campaigns can be wholly fabricated.\n\n##### 5 Conclusion\n\nThe global internet offers military and intelligence agencies the opportunity to\nexpand and enhance IW, and it simultaneously presents their targets and victims\nwith novel challenges. Russian IW – both in traditional media and in cyberspace\n– tangibly contributed to the successful annexation of Crimea, and is playing an\nimportant role in the ongoing crisis in eastern Ukraine. On balance, this author\nbelieves that Russia, and not the West, currently has the lead in contemporary IW.\n\nUnlike propaganda in Soviet times, which was largely a unidirectional, top-down\nphenomenon, today’s IW encompasses a worldwide audience that is both narra­\ntive-bearing and narrative-developing. Domestic, diaspora, and foreign audiences\ninteract with current events in real time as they travel through online platforms\nsuch as social media. This dynamic makes it more challenging for propagandists to\npredict how and where the narrative will evolve, but to some degree it is possible to\npresume how certain political groups will interpret the narrative and how they will\ndescribe it to their followers.\n\nIn sum, the traditional ‘fog of war’ has changed in the internet era. The ubiq­\nuity and anonymity of internet communications offer all nations including Russia\n\n46 Markku Lonkila. ‘Russian Protest On-and Offline: The role of social media in the Moscow opposition demonstrations in De­\ncember 2011.’ UPI FIIA Briefing Papers 98, 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### In sum, the traditional\n new IW opportunities, even as defenders also\n\nhave more tools and tactics at their disposal\n\n##### ‘fog of war’ has changed\n\nto counter hostile actions.

And while it is possible\nto counter adversary operations with accurate open source analysis (for journalists,[48]\nscholars, and activists[49]), this is unfortunately difficult to do in a timely manner.\n\n47 However, even unsophisticated cyber attacks such as DDoS and website defacements tend to garner widespread media ex­\nposure, and can sow distrust in the security of systems. This occurred during the invasion of Crimea, when Russia sought to\ncapitalise on events that unfolded far too quickly for methodical information analysis to take place.\n48 Jessikka Aro.‘Yle Kioski Investigated: This is How Pro-Russia Trolls Manipulate Finns Online – Check the List of Forums\n[Favored by Propagandists’.

Much of cyber\noperations is classified and hidden from public view, but there are numerous ways\nin which information becomes known, including via intelligence leaks and open\nsource analysis. This chapter focuses on leadership communications and what they\ncan tell us about conflict in cyberspace.\n\nIn geopolitics, heads of state are the ultimate decision-makers, especially during\na national security crisis. Leaders are expected to show rhetorical as well as execu­\ntive leadership. The media takes it from there, but the public still struggles to find\na consistent evaluation, primarily relying on experts and opinion leaders.[1] As the\nhead of state seeks his or her ‘rally around the president’ moment,[2] domestic and\ninternational observers analyse their explanations and emotions – as well as their\nproffered initiatives and guidance.[3] From a national podium, heads of state have an\ninherent advantage, as their arguments are ‘more likely to resonate with the public\nthan the opinions of leaders voicing a more local outlook’.[4]\n\nCommunication and discourse analysis in international affairs rests on the idea\nthat language cannot be taken at face value. Words carry definitional meaning, but dif­\n\n1 Timothy E Cook. Governing with the News (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1998).\n2 Birgitte Lebens Nacos.

Critical analysis can yield insight into\nthe true beliefs and motivations of any speaker, including policy-makers. Meaning is\n‘mediated through language’[5] and all words have ‘social values’[6] that vary with context.\n\nThis chapter analyses Russian and Ukrainian leadership statements, speeches,\npress releases and other rhetoric from 2014 and 2015, especially the English-lan­\nguage elements, written for a global audience and printed in international media.\nThe author also searched major international news outlets for the keywords\n‘Ukraine’, ‘Russia’, ‘cyber’, and ‘information warfare’. In all cases, focus remained on\nthe rhetoric attributable to a head of state or other high-level political player,[7] with\nan eye toward uncovering their underlying motivations, beliefs, and ideologies.\n\n##### 2 Analytical Focus\n\nThis analysis is designed to yield insight into numerous areas of international con­\ncern. Above all, the world would like to understand more about the emerging threat\nof cyber warfare. New developments in research and technology, as well as in the\nmeans and methods of war, are usually far ahead of their codification in doctrine.\n\nComputer network operations fit nicely within the concept of hybrid warfare that\nhas been so characteristic of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Cyber attacks are similar to\ncovert operations, information operations, denial and deception, false flag and no-flag\n\nattacks: they give national command and con­\n\n##### An analysis of political trol structures some degree of plausible deni­ rhetoric may yield signif­ ability.

National security establishments must provide legal support for their\nactions through the release of press statements and promulgation of doctrine. With\nthese in hand, analysts may be able to understand much more about the other­\nwise covert nature of cyber attacks. In 2015, Russia has a fairly well-developed mil­\nitary doctrine on cyber and information warfare, while that of Ukraine is still in its\ninfancy. This analysis offers a deeper understanding of each nation’s non-explicit\npolitical objectives related to cyber warfare.\n\n5 Henrik Larsen.

Putin said,\n‘There are still many threats and challenges in the world today. As you may know,\nin Europe, militant nationalism is raising its head here and there – the one that once\nled to the appearance of the Nazi ideology. I will not dwell on each of the hotspots\nseparately – we all know where the danger is. Incidentally, the situation in our\nneighbouring brotherly Ukraine is an example of the disaster and loss such an irre­\nsponsible policy can bring about.’[10] In explaining Gazprom’s tough stance vis-à-vis\nUkraine, for example, Putin has argued that there was no other choice but to take\na hard line against Kyiv,[11] again placing Russia as a bystander, not an active party.\n\nPutin has consistently delegitimised Poroshenko’s government:\n\n_‘There can only be one assessment: this was an anti-constitutional takeover,_\n_an armed seizure of power [that] significantly destabilised the east and south­_\n_east of Ukraine […] we see the rampage of reactionary forces, nationalist_\n_and anti-Semitic forces going on in certain parts of Ukraine, including Kyiv_\n\n_[…] Are the current authorities legitimate?

There have\nbeen some commercial reports alleging specific Russian cyber attacks, such as that\nby the security firm FireEye,[13] but these are typically dismissed as Western propa­\nganda. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, ‘We know that blaming\nRussia for everything has turned into a sport’.[14]\n\nPutin did refer to the stories about phone hacking and surveillance of top politi­\ncians, which were prominent in the news in 2014:\n\n_‘As for the facts of cyber espionage that you mentioned, it not only amounts to_\n_overt hypocrisy in relationships between allies and partners, but also a direct_\n_violation of the state’s sovereignty, an infringement on human rights and an_\n_invasion of privacy. We are looking forward to jointly developing an interna­_\n_tional information security system’.[15]_\n\nThis quote may indicate an underlying assumption of Russian doctrine: today,\neveryone is spying on everyone, there are currently no acceptable international laws\nto govern such activities in cyberspace, and Russia must be a part of any credible\neffort to develop such norms.\n\nAlthough Russia claims not to be directly involved in the Ukraine conflict, Mos­\ncow still wants to direct its peace-making efforts. Putin has championed a consid­\neration of Ukraine’s eastern regions[16] has produced a diplomatic solution called the\nPutin Plan[17] and ‘gave the instruction to hold consultations with foreign partners,\nincluding the IMF and the G8 countries, on organising financial assistance for\nUkraine’.[18]\n\n##### 4 Ukraine\n\nMany of these quotes came from the President of Russia’s website, and are directly\nattributable to Vladimir Putin. However, most of the conflict-related quotes in this\nsection – from the President of Ukraine’s website – are from news articles and press\nreleases that quote Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Unlike on the Russian\nsite, full-length Ukrainian speeches are a smaller proportion of the presidential\ncommunications.

Various terms have\n\n##### clearer than Russia in identi­\n\nbeen used, such as ‘cyber security’,[19]\n‘informational cyber-security system _fying cyberspace as a separate_\nof Ukraine’,[20] and ‘cyber and informa­ _and active domain of conflict._\ntion security’.[21] These terms may refer to\nslightly different things at different times, but in general, there was more cyber war­\nfare-related content to analyse.\n\nFrom the beginning of the conflict, Ukraine has suffered a variety of network\nattacks. In February 2014, the Ukrainian telecommunications firm Ukrtelecom\nreported that ‘unknown people’[22] had damaged a fibre backbone cable that resulted\nin the loss of communication between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine. Not long\nafter, Ukrainian security chief Valentyn Nalivaichenko announced, ‘I confirm that\nan ... attack is under way on mobile phones of members of the Ukrainian parlia­\nment for the second day in a row’.[23] The most sophisticated attack came against the\nUkrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) during Ukraine’s Presidential elec­\ntions.[24] However, there was no official attribution for any of these attacks provided\nby the government in Kyiv.\n\nThere were at least two cases of cyber attack attribution, both to Russia. The\nSecurity Service of Ukraine linked the disruption of mobile communications and\nthe defacement of websites to pro-Russian hackers and to pro-Russian forces in\nCrimea. There was no direct link made to Moscow, perhaps in part because the\n‘IP-telephonic’ attack was aimed at top Ukrainian politicians irrespective of their\npolitical allegiance.[25] On another occasion, when the hacktivist group CyberBerkut\nclaimed responsibility for an attack on German government websites, Ukrainian\nPrime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk placed the blame on Russian intelligence: ‘I\nstrongly recommend that the Russian secret services stop spending taxpayer money\nfor cyberattacks against the Bundestag and Chancellor Merkel’s office’.[26]\n\nIn the case of downed Malaysian airliner MH17, which Poroshenko called ter­\nrorism,[27] the President stated that ‘The State Security Service of Ukraine has inter­\n\n19 ‘President met with U.S. Congress delegation,’ Office of the President of Ukraine, 6 August 2014 http://www.president.gov.ua/\nen/news/prezident-zustrivsya-z-delegaciyeyu-kongresu-ssha-35766.\n20 ‘NSDC decision: Ukraine asks the UN, NATO, EU, OSCE and strategic partners for help,’ Office of the President of Ukraine,\n28 August 2014, http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-zvertayetsya-za-dopomogoyu-do-oon-nato-yes-ob­\nsye-de-33573.\n21 ‘Presidents of Ukraine and Lithuania have held the Seventh session of the Council of Presidents’ Office of the President of\nUkraine, 24 November 2014. http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezidenti-ukrayini-i-litvi-proveli-some-zasidannya-ra­\ndi-pre-34105.\n22 Ukrtelecom. ‘Ukrtelecom’s Crimean sub-branches officially report that unknown people have seized several telecommunica­\ntions nodes in the Crimea,’ 28 February 2014, http://en.ukrtelecom.ua/about/news?id=120467.\n23 Dave Lee. ‘Russia and Ukraine in cyber ‘stand-off’,’ BBC News, 5 March 2014 http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26447200.\n24 SRK/NN/SS, ‘Hackers attack Ukraine election website,’ _PressTV, 25 October 2014, http://www.presstv.com/de­_\ntail/2014/10/25/383623/ukraines-election-website-hacked.\n25 Max Smolaks. ‘Security Service Of Ukraine Claims Politicians’ Phones Are Under Attack,’ TechWeek Europe, 4 March 2014,\nhttp://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/workspace/security-service-ukraine-claims-politicians-phones-attack-140643.\n26 Erik Kirscbaum. ‘Ukraine says Russia behind cyber attack on German government,’ _Reuters, 8 January 2015, http://www._\nreuters.com/article/2015/01/08/us-germany-cyberattack-idUSKBN0KH0IY20150108.\n27 ‘Address of the President on the occasion of the crash of Malaysia Airlines aircraft,’ Office of the President of Ukraine, 18 July\n2014, http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-z-privodu-tragediyi-z-litakom-aviakomp-33262.\n\n\n-----\n\ncepted a conversation in which one of the leaders of the mercenaries boasted about\nbringing down the plane in his reporting to his Russian supervisor, a colonel of the\nGeneral Intelligence Unit of Russia’s Armed Forces’[28] and ‘terrorists have already\ndeclared their desire to hide the evidence and transport the aircraft’s black boxes to\nMoscow’.[29]\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Poroshenko contends that the separatist movement is ‘fully\ncontrolled’ by Russian leadership[30] and even in government-controlled territory, he\nannounced that ‘[t]he Security Service of Ukraine unmasked and neutralised the\nterrorist group coordinated by special forces of the Russian Federation’.[31]\n\nTo international audiences, Poroshenko has focused primarily on the broader\ntopic of hybrid warfare, taking care to fit within the narratives and terminology\n\nof the West.

During the Ukraine crisis, numerous groups such as Cyber­\nBerkut have positioned themselves as independent, Internet-based guerrillas, and\nto some degree they have influenced the course of events. In general, there is too\nlittle public information available for analysts to determine if any of these non-state\nactors has a direct or indirect government connection.\n\nIn Ukraine, one of the most prominent non-state cyber leaders is Eugene\nDokunin, who describes himself as a ‘lone wolf waging a furious battle against the\nthousands of paid hackers and trolls in Russia’.[41] Whereas governments may not\nboast about their achievements, rogue actors do. Dokunin’s group claims to have\nblocked more than 170 PayPal and other online accounts belonging to separatists,\nand frozen almost $3 million of their cash. In one attack, they compromised net­\nworked printers in separatist regions, forcing them to spew out documents glorify­\ning Ukraine, as well as the popular chant ‘Putin is a dick’, which is sung in football\nstadiums across Ukraine’.[42] Dokunin reserves some of his ire for the sitting govern­\nment in Kyiv: ‘The Ukrainian Government hasn’t invested a cent in cyber warfare,\neven though this is also an information war’.\n\n##### 6 Conclusion\n\nCommunication analysis reveals that both Putin and Poroshenko have adopted\nsimilar rhetorical strategies – ‘good vs. evil’ and ‘us vs. them’ – in an effort to rally\ncitizens around the flag. They emphasise the righteous nature of their cause, their\nleadership in working toward a solution, and other countries’ approval of their\npolitical stances. This is an exercise in national identity building, while portraying\nthe adversary as illegitimate, dangerous, and even terrorist in nature.

Russia has referred to\nit only in high-level, diplomatic terms. Ukraine, despite the fact that it has suffered\nnumerous cyber attacks, primarily frames the issue within the larger concept of\nhybrid warfare. Neither country denies that cyberspace is now a theatre of warfare,\nor that it is part of the Ukrainian conflict, but neither has argued that cyberspace is\nan integral aspect of it. And for the most part, this echoes the sentiments of other\nauthors and chapters in this volume.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 12\n\n\n## Strategic Communications\n and Social Media in the\n Russia Ukraine Conflict\n\n##### Elina Lange-Ionatamishvili Sanda Svetoka\n\n_NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence_\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\nThe new information environment has changed the nature of warfare. The events\nin south-east Ukraine have demonstrated that a conflict can be won without firing\na single shot and some of the key battles can take place in the cyber and communi­\ncations domains rather than on the land,\nair and sea. As Thomas Elkjer Nissen said _Key battles can take place in_\nin his recent book, the internet, cyber­ _the cyber and communica­_\nspace, and social media can be used to\n\n##### tions domains rather than\n\ncollect intelligence or even to target peo­\nple and organisations. Such tactics may be _on the land, air and sea._\nemployed in isolation, but they are much\nmore likely to be an integral part of a larger strategy.[1]\n\nThe operation for the take-over of Crimea was a particularly bold example of\nan influence operation where the traditional role of conventional forces was mini­\n\n1 Thomas Elkjer Nissen. #TheWeaponizationOfSocialMedia. @Characteristics_of_ Contemporary_Conflicts. Copenhagen: Royal\nDanish Defence College, 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nmised. As the conflict continues to develop in the east of Ukraine, Russia continues\nto exploit the opportunities offered by new technologies and the new information\nenvironment. It does so with the purpose of influencing the hearts and minds of its\naudiences: if Russia succeeds in mobilising its supporters, demonising its enemy,\ndemoralising its enemy’s government and armed forces, and legitimising its own\nactions, then really there is no need for conventional fighting in order to subdue\nUkraine.\n\nIn the modern-day operations cyberspace plays an increasingly important role.\nA targeted attack by an adversary in the cyber environment is often understood as\nan attack on the computerised systems which help us run our daily lives and busi­\nnesses, sustain critical infrastructure and conduct financial transactions amongst\nother things. As the former White House advisor Richard Clarke writes, a cyber-at­\ntack can mean that these vital systems go down and we see exploding oil refineries,\nderailing trains, runaway satellites, food shortages, and much more.[2] But what we\ndo not often realise is that we can be attacked in the cyber environment by an adver­\nsary presenting manipulative information to us with the intent to affect our percep­\ntion of the situation and our decision-making, and provoke some resulting action.\nThe real-life consequences of this ‘soft’ cyber-attack can be as severe as an attack on\na critical infrastructure.\n\n##### 2 Strategic Communications and Cyberspace\n\nStrategic Communications (StratCom) is a mind-set which implies placing commu­\nnications at the heart of a strategy. It means that our activity is narrative-driven and\nwe communicate it to different audiences through coordinated words, images and\ndeeds. Cyberspace plays an increasingly important role in StratCom as our depen­\ndency on modern technologies, computer networks and the internet grows day by\nday. We use it for receiving and conveying information, for coordinating our actions\nand also for analysing the environment around us in order to detect and evaluate\npotential threats.\n\nCyberspace is often used in a conflict in order to take out the communications\nsystems of an adversary. However, the conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated that\ncyberspace can also play a role in conducting a narrative-driven operation where\nthe main targets are not the machines or networks but the minds of the people.\n\nThe internet and social media, due to their ability to multiply information at\nhigh speed and at little cost, are increasingly used for propaganda, information war­\nfare, and influence operations, all of which can tangibly change both the perception\nand behaviour of the target audience. It is a highly dynamic, user-driven, constantly\nchanging environment where it is easy to get a message to ‘go viral’, and also difficult\n\n2 Richard A. Clarke and Robert Knake. Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It. New York:\nHarperCollins, 2011.\n\n\n-----\n\nto track the initial source of information, verify its authenticity, and separate fact\nfrom fiction.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of social media platforms, the concept of social\ncyber attack is gaining traction.[3] It allows for a low-cost, speedy way of manipu­\nlating society’s perceptions in order to cause disruptive behaviour in real life. The\nsocial cyber attacks observed during the crisis in Ukraine led to an assumption that\nat least part of them were implemented in an organised way, as part of a larger influ­\nence strategy.\n\n##### 3 Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) and Social Media\n\nPsychological Operations (PSYOPS) is a military activity which is aimed at influenc­\ning the perceptions, attitudes and behaviours of target populations. The perception\nis usually affected by either emotional appeals or rational arguments, corresponding\nto the master narrative, and in social media, where one has to compete with a flood\nof information and large amounts of information noise, elements like surprise, cog­\nnitive dissonance, easily recognisable symbols or some eye-catching techniques are\nused in order to draw the audience into the PSYOPS product.\n\nIn PSYOPS the influence over a target group is often achieved by spreading\nrumours. Those can be:\n\n  - Hate rumours: exploit ingrained dislikes and prejudices\n\nof a target population.\n\n  - Fear rumours: exploit a human tendency to believe the worst.\n\n  - Hope rumours: exploit wishes for a favourable turn of events.\n\nModern technology allows particularly easy exploitation of digital material in\norder to produce falsified or ambiguous content which can be used for deception\nand manipulation. Textual messages (posts, status updates, comments) can also be\ncrafted according to the same principles.\n\nSocial media provides fruitful soil for PSYOPS as it is largely a trust-based net­\nwork since it is formed on a networks of friends or like-minded group members.\nHence the information coming from an individual or group can be more trusted\nthan that coming from an official mass-media outlet or government communica­\ntors. This trust can be manipulated to achieve particular effects. It allows targeting\nof groups of people connected by certain social ties which increases the chance of\nthe desired effect on perception and behaviour.\n\nIt is also very easy to hide the real identity or original source of information on\nsocial media as well as manipulate digital data such as imagery. Hence the concept\n\n3 Rebecca Goolsby. On Cybersecurity, Crowdsourcing and Social Cyber-Attack. Washington: Wilson Center. U.S. Office of Naval\nResearch, 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\nof social cyber attack becomes increasingly important as it is based on manipulated\ninformation being spread under false identities to networks of users.\n\n##### 4 Understanding Social Cyber Attacks\n\nA social cyber attack, as defined by Dr Rebecca Goolsby, involves acting under false\npretences or anonymously, by either releasing a manipulated signal into the social\nmedia or by manipulating an existing signal in order to achieve the desired effects:\nchaos, panic, mass disorders. This type of cyber attack offers a different view to the\ntraditional views on attacks in the cyber environment, as the effects of these attacks\nare purely psychological.\n\nSpreading rumours is one of the most effective tactics of the social cyber attack,\nas those can create fear, hate or unfounded hope in the target audience which\n\n\n##### Spreading rumours is one of the most effective tactics of social cyber attack.\n\n\nwill most likely result in real-life action:\nfor example, mass protests, withdrawing\nmoney from banks, or organised attacks on\ncertain groups or individuals whose image\nhas been portrayed as the enemy.[4]\n\n\nSocial cyber attack can also involve\ntraditional hacking if the information to be manipulated and released needs to be\nobtained or published this way. Since the concept of the social cyber attack is very\nnew, it is often difficult to determine what activity should be classified as one. One\nmight argue that the key component to social cyber attack is the narrative which\ndrives it. The actions by the pro-Russian ‘Cyber Berkut’ (КиберБеркут) and its\nnemesis, the pro-Ukrainian ‘Cyber Hundred’ (Киберсотня) can serve as examples.\n\nCyber Berkut is frequently in the news, propagating the Russian political nar­\nrative as well as hacking both the Ukrainian Government and other countries. The\ngroup successfully attacked and defaced the websites of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganisation (NATO) and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excel­\nlence (NATO CCD COE), claiming that its activities were in retaliation for NATO\nsupport for Ukraine.[5] However, the key to Cyber Berkut’s activities is the narrative\nwhich it uses to justify and promote its activities. Cyber Berkut claimed credit on its\nsocial networking site VKontakte page for hacking electronic advertising billboards\nin the centre of Kyiv prior to a Ukrainian parliamentary election on 24 October\n2014, displaying videos of numerous prominent Ukrainian politicians and labelling\nthem war criminals:[2]\n\n_[English translation] ‘We Cyber Berkut intend to use every opportunity to_\n_defend the interests of Ukrainian citizens from the arbitrariness of nationalist_\n\n4 _Ibid._\n5 [The post and video can be found here: http://vk.com/wall-67432779_14678](http://vk.com/wall-67432779_14678)\n\n\n-----\n\n_fringe and the oligarchic elite …Today, we have used a few dozen billboards_\n_in Kyiv, Ukraine to remind people about the futility of farcical elections …We_\n_reiterate once again that no one will change our lives for us. If the people will_\n_continue to hope that the authorities in the offices there are people concerned_\n_about the problems of ordinary citizens, Ukraine will be more immersed in_\n_the chaos of civil war. The United States and the West first brought into the_\n_government people who are ready to sell our country to please their owners,_\n_and now want to put the same traitors in Parliament. Today, everyone has to_\n_realise that his decision depends the future of our country, and the sooner we_\n_crack down on neo-Nazi government and deputies, who are just cashing in_\n_on this war, the sooner the country’s peace and order.’_\n\nThis narrative was also spread on social media networks. Analysing this state­\nment, one can identify clear attempts to construe enemy images of the Ukrainian\nGovernment and induce fear in the population by calling it neo-Nazi and threaten­\ning chaos and civil war. The hacking of the billboards had no other meaning than to\nconduct a social cyber attack by propagating this narrative and spreading rumours\nthrough manipulated information.\n\n##### 5 Social Media in the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict\n\nDuring the war in Ukraine, social media has become home to intense conflict-re­\nlated information updates, impassioned arguments, and debate.[6] The social media\nspace has been abused, and pro-Russian forces have given the world a masterclass.\n\nAt the beginning of the conflict, we saw strategic communications in action.\nOver Twitter and YouTube, unknown attackers released an intercepted phone con­\nversation between the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and Geof­\nfrey Pyatt, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.[7] In one stroke, the perpetrators sought\nto discredit Western policy and to announce their access to Western lines of gov­\nernment communication. Thus we saw both a technical exploit on an information\nsystem and a psychological attack on the West via social media.\n\nDuring the course of the conflict, Russia’s narrative has been tightly scripted and\ndisseminated, both on traditional media (in ‘breaking’ and ‘eyewitness’ accounts on\ntelevision) and in cyberspace via social media. These venues are mutually reinforcing,\nencompassing older and younger readers with varying degrees of access to technol­\nogy. For example, one can no longer watch Ukrainian television in eastern Ukraine;\nsimilarly, Russian television channels are no longer available in western Ukraine.\n\n6 See, for example, Irina Anilovskaja. Война: переписка одноклассников, Alfra Reklama, 2014.\n7 Anne Gearan. ‘In recording of U.S. diplomat, blunt talk on Ukraine’ Washington Post, 6 February 2014, https://www.washing­\ntonpost.com/world/national-security/in-purported-recording-of-us-diplomat-blunt-talk-on-ukraine/2014/02/06/518240a48f4b-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn social media, pro-Russian voices have systemically cultivated fear, anxiety,\nand hate among the ethnically Russian (and other non-Ukrainian populations) of\nUkraine. They have manipulated and distributed images of purported atrocities by\nthe Ukrainian army, including: mass graves of tortured people, civilians used for\norgan trafficking, burning crops to create a famine, recruiting child soldiers, the use\nof heavy weapons against civilians, and acts of cannibalism.[8]\n\nVia social media, such information – whether offered with some evidence or\nmerely in the form of rumours – often criss-crosses the globe in minutes, and a\nwell-organised social media campaign can easily influence a target population’s per­\nceptions and behaviours.\n\nThe Latvian media company LETA conducted an analysis of Twitter posts during\nthe first six months of 2014, and identified an increasing polarisation between\npro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian social media users as the conflict escalated, espe­\ncially following the violence in Odessa.[9] The researchers wrote that 12.2% of all\ntweets related to the conflict in eastern Ukraine were ‘aggressive’, dominated by\npro-Russian stances, most intense relative to human casualties, and included epi­\nthets such as ‘fascist’ and ‘ruscist’.[10]\n\n\n##### Numerous social media postings appear to be dissem­ inated in order to manipulate people in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has seen\nnumerous social media postings that\nappear to be deliberately disseminated\nin order to manipulate people in east­\nern Ukraine and beyond. During the\nMay 2014 violence in Odessa, someone\nposted the following to Facebook:\n\n\n\n_[English translation] ‘Hello. My name is Igor Rosovskiy.

However, analysts subsequently discovered that Dr. Rozovs­\nkiy’s profile picture was actually that of a dentist from the North Caucasus, and now\nbelieve this social media post to be a hoax.[11]\n\nOn 4 June 2014, Pavel Astakhov, the Children’s Ombudsman under the President\nof the Russian Federation, announced on his Instagram account that ‘more than 7,000’\nUkrainian refugees had fled Ukraine and arrived in the Rostov Oblast in the previous\n24 hours. The next day, that number had risen to 8,386. Russian mass media reported\nthese numbers, but Rostov authorities apparently contradicted them, where the Gov­\nernor’s office reported that the number of refugees did not exceed 712.[12]\n\nIn July 2014, 3-year-old boy was allegedly tortured and crucified by the Ukrainian\nmilitary in a public square in Slovyansk, Ukraine. The Russian state-run TV Channel\n_One broadcast the ‘eyewitness’ testimony of Galina Pyshnyak, who stated that she and_\nothers were forcibly brought to the central square to witness the public execution. The\ninterview took place at a refugee camp in Russia’s Rostov region and was widely dis­\nseminated on social media.[13] However, Russian journalist Yevgeny Feldman of Novaya\n_Gazeta, as well as journalists from Russia’s independent channel Dozhd, challenged_\nthe report with contradictory testimonies from multiple interviews in Slovyank, in\nwhich numerous residents denied any knowledge of the incident.[14]\n\nThroughout 2014, the list of rumours from eastern Ukraine grew to be quite\nlong: the Kyiv government and European Union were building concentration\ncamps; the forest was full of right-wing killers; the May 9 Victory Day holiday had\nbeen cancelled;[15] property would be confiscated; and use of the Russian language\nwas prohibited. On one occasion, terrified locals called the Donbas Water Company\nafter social media informed them that the region’s water supply had been poisoned.[16]\n\nThese stories can be contrasted with the ‘Polite People’ campaign on Vkontakte,\nwhich supported the Russian invasion of Crimea with pictures of Russian troops\nposing alongside girls, mothers with children, the elderly, and pets.[17]\n\n11 ‘Odesa Doctor Or Random Dentist?

Who posts Facebook updates in support of\nmilitary operations? Of course, there are millions of true believers in the world,\nadherents to every cause under the sun. However, it is also possible to fabricate\nsupport for anything, especially in cyberspace. The social media offers great\nopportunities for state and non-state actors to use fake identities or automati­\ncally generated accounts to disseminate their narrative to audiences as widely\nas possible.\n\nOn 24 May 2014, hacked and leaked email correspondence (revealed on b0ltai.\norg) allegedly from a company called the ‘Internet Research Agency’ in St. Peters­\nburg, Russia, offered evidence of the existence of a professional ‘troll farm’, including\nthe firm’s relationship to the Russian Government.

Examples by citizen journalists have shown that revealing**\nfalse facts to the public is an effective approach in mitigating the effects\nof disinformation. At the same time it is important not to engage in\ncounter-propaganda as this fuels the information war and creates\npublic distrust rather than diminishing the power of misinformation.\nHumour perhaps could be more helpful in countering aggressive pro­\npaganda as it hampers the ability to achieve its aim – subduing the\n[society of the target country.

A long-term educational effort to enhance crit­\nical thinking and media (including social media) literacy would also\ncontribute greatly to society’s self-defence against manipulation.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 13\n\n Ukraine: A Cyber Safe Haven?\n\n##### Nadiya Kostyuk\n\n_University of Michigan_\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, there has been a proliferation in online criminal\nactivity in Eastern Europe, and Ukraine is no exception. Famous for its hacker com­\nmunity, Ukraine ranks among the Top 10 countries in the world in cyber crime[1] and\nnumber 15 as a source of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.[2] In 2012,\nfive Ukrainian nationals stole more than $72 million from U.S. bank accounts;[3] in\n2013, Ukrainian hackers stole 40 million sets of debit and credit card details from\nthe US retail chain Target;[4] in 2014, the RAND Corporation wrote that Russian\nand Ukrainian (the primary language of Ukraine) were the lingua franca of online\nhacker forums.[5] In this light, it is natural to wonder if Ukraine is today a safe haven\nfor cyber criminals.\n\nTo be sure, there have been some law enforcement successes, such as when\nnumerous European countries and Europol (with the aid of the Ukrainian govern­\nment) arrested five hackers who stole at least €2 million from banks all around the\nworld.[6] However, there are major countervailing factors at play in Ukraine, which\ninclude ongoing political, military, and economic crises and the absence of zhyvoii\n\n1 Victor Zhora, e-mail to the author, July 30, 2015.\n2 ‘Украина вошла в рейтинг стран с наибольшим количеством DDoS-атак.’ Minfin, June 8, 2015.http://minfin.com.\nua/2015/06/08/7407564/.\n3 Taylor Armerding. ‘Ukraine Seen as a Growing ‘haven for Hackers’ March 13, 2012. http://www.csoonline.com/arti­\ncle/2131155/network-security/ukraine-seen-as-a-growing--haven-for-hackers-.html.\n4 Charles Riley and Jose Pagliery. ‘Target Will Pay Hack Victims $10 Million.’ CNNMoney.

Finally, the chapter\nends with recommendations based on best practices in cyber security – all of which\ncan help Kyiv to improve its cyber security posture. Beyond Ukraine, these insights\ncan be applied to numerous other countries in the region.\n\n##### 2 Ukraine as a Cyber Safe Haven\n\nOnce the internet conquered post-Soviet daily life, many talented computer pro­\ngrammers who had already dabbled in illegal activities such as stealing music and\nmovies realised that they could make a living as professional hackers. There were\nfew cyber security regulations in Ukraine and so, as in so many other countries,\ncyber crime quickly evolved from a mischievous hobby to a lucrative occupation.[8]\n\nSeveral factors contributed to making Ukraine a cyber safe haven. First, its\nSoviet school STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education\nis among the best in the world. Second, its underwhelming economic performance\nsince independence in 1991 has led these STEM specialists to explore alternative\ncareer paths, often online. Third, Ukraine’s social and cultural norms dictate that\nstealing from the West is not always a bad thing. This factor is compounded by the\nrelatively impersonal nature of cyberspace.[9]\n\nAt the policy level, ‘cyber crimes’ such as stealing intellectual property and\ncopyright infringement were not even considered illegal in Ukraine until recently.\nFor instance, the popular Russian social media website _vkontakte.ru used to be_\na source of large-scale music and movie piracy.[10] Ukraine recently has begun to\ndevelop a common lexicon on cyber security (a pre-requisite for progress in this\n\n7 Vlad Styran, Skype interview, July 6, 2015.\n8 Supra, note 5.\n9 The author can testify through personal experience.\n10 Kathryn Dowling. ‘VKontakte Case Puts Russian Music Piracy into Spotlight.’ August 11, 2014. http://www.bbc.com/news/\nbusiness-28739602.\n\n\n-----\n\nnew domain),[11] but the multiple cyber units within the Ukrainian government[12] still\ntend to operate independently, and rarely collaborate.[13] Moreover, as in other East­\nern European countries, government employees are poorly paid and lack resources,\nwhich in turn motivates skilled specialists to leave for the private sector. Finally, due\nto the high level of corruption in Ukraine, even when a cyber criminal is caught, he\nor she can usually bribe an official to have the charges reduced or dropped.[14]\n\n##### 3 Ukraine as a Cyber Target\n\nEven though Ukraine is not a rich country and is relatively new to online banking,\nits enterprises nonetheless lost ₴65 million[15] to cybercrime in 2014.[16] The origin of\nthese attacks is unclear, but numerous interviewees agreed that the cyber criminals\nwere not physically located in Ukraine. Most likely, they would follow the hack­\ner’s first ‘zapovid’’ (‘commandment’), the so-called ‘gypsy’ rule: ‘tam de zhyvesh,\n_tam ne kradesh’ (‘you do not steal in the place where you live’).[17] When asked_\nwhether Russia could be a source of such attacks, Vlad Styran, an information\nsecurity consultant at Berezha Security, answered affirmatively, but explained that\nsome groups originally operating from Russia have moved to Ukraine, mostly to\nthe self-proclaimed Donetsk National Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk National\nRepublic (LNR).[18] However, these groups may not be attacking Ukraine directly,\nbut Western countries farther afield, similar to online criminals in Romania, Tur­\nkey, and Belarus.[19] In Ukraine, the domestic climate, technical capabilities, and\nresources are better suited to criminals who engage in credit card fraud,[20] and\nas long as they steal money in small amounts, no one will touch them.[21] Cyber\ncriminals physically based in Ukraine have also begun to look for more comfort­\nable conditions in which to operate, as Ukrainian law enforcement agencies have\nbegun to collaborate with Western agencies.[22] Thus the number of cyber criminals\nin Ukraine may finally be declining.[23]\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine has given rise to numerous high-level cyber\nattacks. As part of its military operations, Russia has used cyber warfare tactics against\nUkrainian websites, some of which are physically hosted in Ukraine, while some are\n\n11 Oleksandr V.

The only operational definition is in Article 361 of the Criminal Codex of\nUkraine: ‘Illegal interference with the operation of computers (PCs), automated\nsystems, computer networks or telecommunications networks’.[31] However, it is not\nclear what ‘illegal interference’ actually means.\n\nRecently, lawmakers have considered new legislation – the ‘Cybersecurity Law of\nUkraine’ – which seeks to: update existing laws; create conditions for cooperation between\nthe private and publics sectors; protect critical information infrastructure; develop a com­\nprehensive legal framework; build a secure national security network; educate future\nspecialists; fight cyber crime and cyber terrorism; strengthen the state’s defence in cyber­\nspace; prevent other states from interfering in Ukraine’s internal affairs; neutralise attacks\non Ukraine’s information resources; and ensure Ukraine’s full participation in European\nand regional cybersecurity organisations.[ 32] However, such a comprehensive agenda faces\nnumerous acute challenges before it can be properly implemented.[33]\n\nFor example, ‘the strategy of creating a secure national segment of cyberspace’ lacks a\nworking definition of critical national infrastructure (CNI), as well as a valid list of CNI.\nAt this stage in Ukraine’s economic development, there is little CNI with internet-based\nmanagement, but that number is beginning to rise.[34] Another example is ‘ensuring full\nparticipation of Ukraine in European and regional systems’. Although Ukrainian cyber\nsecurity experts already share information and intelligence with Western colleagues, this\ncollaboration is not nearly as effective as it could\n\n##### For the foreseeable future,\n\nbe, because the West does not yet ‘respect [them]\nand do not share information with [them].[’35] _Ukrainian CNI will rely_\n\nIt is debatable, given the ongoing war in _on reasonably sound pri­_\neastern Ukraine, how urgent this process is,\n\n##### vate sector approaches.\n\nespecially given that all countries are cur­\nrently struggling to protect CNI. Even if adopted, the draft Cybersecurity Law of\nUkraine will take years to fully implement.[36] Therefore, for the foreseeable future,\nUkrainian CNI such as telecoms,[37] banks,[38] and insurance companies[39] will rely on\nreasonably sound private sector approaches to their cyber security challenges.[40]\n\n31 ‘Несанкцiоноване втручання в роботу електронно-обчислювальних машин (комп’ютерів), автоматизованих систем,\nкомп’ютерних мереж чи мереж електрозв’явку; supra, note 1.\n32 Supra, note 11, figure 1-1.\n33 Some of those challenges were mentioned earlier.\n34 Ukraine’s CNI objects are not controlled via the Internet, as mentioned in the skype interview with Vlad Styran on July 6, 2015\n(Supra, note 7).\n35 Supra, note 14.\n36 Its implementation has three stages: 1) 2014-2016; 2) 2016-2017; and 3) 2017 – the following years.\n37 Telecom operators are mostly protected as a huge portion of the population uses these services. They do no necessarily suffer\nfrom cyber attacks but they suffer from their clients’ abuse of the system.

It is quite a new trend in Ukraine as banks\nmostly operate using their clients’ money. Last year, we witnessed the first cyber attacks on Ukrainian banks. From supra, note 7.\n39 Insurance companies take the third place on the level of protection. They are active in protecting their companies from cyber\nattacks not because they are subjects to those attacks, but mostly because they are part of some international group, which\nrequires them to follow the EU or U.S. requirements or because they need to create their image.

Its Computer Emer­\ngency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) handles international cooperation.\n\nEach agency faces its own unique challenges and suffers from its own, unique\ncriticism. For example, one interviewee said of CERT-UA: ‘[its specialists] just visit\nEurope and tell [the Europeans] how amazing they are. They [only] do PR and make\ncontacts in Ukraine and abroad.’[47] Others, however, disagreed, arguing that in 2013\nCERT-UA processed 232 incident reports\nfrom foreign CERTs[48] and was ‘quite effective’ _CERT-UA’s bigger prob­_\ndespite ‘significantly limited powers’, a lack\n\n##### lem is the country’s\n\nof qualified specialists, insufficient resources,\nand a low level of outside trust.[49] Two inter­ _almost exclusive focus on_\nviewees, Kostiantyn Korsun of Berezha Secu­ _fighting Russian aggres­_\nrity and Glib Pakharenko of ISACA Kyiv, _sion in eastern Ukraine._\nadded that CERT-UA’s bigger problem is the\ncountry’s almost exclusive current focus on fighting Russian aggression in eastern\nUkraine.[50]\n\nAt the MVD, Vasyl Guzii, a specialist in kartkove shakhraistvo (credit card fraud\noperations)[,] asserted that no ‘sdelka iz pravosudiiem’ (‘deal with law enforcement agen­\ncies’ in Russian) exists in Ukraine.[51] However, Styran was not so sure, suggesting that\n‘verbyvannia’ (‘recruitment’) was common.[52] In effect, this means that instead of arrest­\ning hackers, law enforcement agencies simply offer krysha (protection)[53] in exchange\nfor future favours.[54] The overall level of corruption in Ukraine is high, even at the SBU.[55]\n\nDespite everything, there is progress to report. Beyond the new draft law on\ncyber security and the proposed new IT ministry[56] Ukraine is setting up an Intera­\ngency Board[57] to counter strategic cyber threats (see Figure 1‑2). This initiative will\nof course take time to blossom, and there are already doubts about technical talent,\nbureaucratic implementation, and overall SBU power in this new initiative.[58] So, for\nthe time being, it is likely that the Ukrainian government will continue to rely on\nan approach favoured in the United Kingdom: pereklastu or delegating many cyber\ncrime-related tasks, including client protection, to the private sector.[59]\n\n47 Supra, note 7.\n48 Supra note, 11.\n49 “незважаючи на суттєве обмеження повноважень в сфері розслідування комп’ютерних злочинів (це не належить до\nїхньої компетенції), відсутність достатньої кількості кваліфікованих фахівців, недостатні матеріальну базу та рівень\nфінансового забезпечення, низький рівень довіри з боку як бізнес-структур, так навіть і органів державної влади.”\nSupra, note 1.\n50 However, Korsun pointed out that nearly all countries – especially in Eastern Europe – face the same challenges of low salaries\nand poor skillsets.

Analysts believe that cyber crime is rife in Ukraine, but there\n\nare no accurate measurements or reliable studies that have docu­\nmented this problem. Some Western[60] and Ukrainian companies[61] are\nnow addressing this issue, but without better data and analysis, it is\nhard to separate fact from fiction.\n\n  - Prevention. Until Ukraine invests more in proactive cyber defence,\n\nit will remain in a reactive mode vis-à-vis cyber criminals, a serious\nproblem in the age of light-speed communications.\n\n60 Such as RAND.\n61 Supra, note 14.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Corruption. Ukraine must address bribes, protection,[62] and the uneth­\n\nical recruitment of hackers. In one infamous case, a fraudulent cyber\ncrime ‘call centre’, which in fact was used to steal credit card informa­\ntion, actually operated from a Ukrainian prison.[63]\n\n  - Culture. Ukraine must promote cyber crime awareness and enforce\n\nexisting law. Ukrainian citizens must recognise that stealing money\nfrom the West is against the law, and they must be willing to report\nsuch crimes to law enforcement.[64]\n\n  - Education. Kyiv must invest in the academic side of cyber security, to\n\ninclude software engineering, critical infrastructure protection, and\nmore.[65] Some steps have already been taken, including the creation\nof kiberpolitseiski (cyber police) departments at the Kyiv and Kharkiv\nMVD Institutes;[66 ] further, the MVD has collaborated with various\ndepartments of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI).

The Ukrainian Government requires pressure from below\n\nto assist in the implementation of so many needed changes. Even from\nabroad, the Ukrainian diaspora can help.\n\n  - Oversight. Ukrainian lawmakers often receive foreign assistance to\n\nhelp the country adopt and implement reform, but currently there is\nno effective oversight body helping to manage this process.[69]\n\n  - Public sector labour force. The Ukrainian government must find a\n\nway to hire qualified cyber security professionals and retain them with\nquality training and attractive salaries. It must be said that this chal­\nlenge is not unique to Ukraine.[70]\n\n**_6.2 Regional and International_**\n\n  - Collaboration. Ukrainian cyber security institutions must develop a\n\nhigher level of trust with their international counterparts, especially in\nthe West.

This chapter considers this question from a legal perspective. The term ‘cyber­\nwar’ has no precise legal meaning. Even the term ‘war’ is less important than it used\nto be. Contemporary international law distinguishes ‘armed conflict’, ‘armed attack’,\nand ‘use of force’, but the question is how to place cyber conflict into that frame­\nwork. In Ukraine, are we seeing ‘cyber armed conflict’ or merely cyber crime?\n\nCyber operations have to be considered within the context of the whole conflict.\nAlthough cyber can be used as stand-alone operation, the more likely case – and\nthis holds true in Ukraine – is that cyber is used as a facilitator for other, more\ntraditional types of warfare. The law applicable to the conflict as a whole should\nbe applied to the cyber activities that are part of it. In other words, the wider con­\ntext determines the legal framework for cyber operations. Particularly relevant is\nwhether the conflict in Ukraine is an ‘armed conflict’ that leads to the application of\nthe Law of Armed Conflict (or international humanitarian law).\n\nThis chapter will first briefly outline the applicability of international law to\ncyberspace. Then it will describe the legal framework of the conflict, related to the\nsubsequent phases of the conflict, from the protests at Maidan Square in November\n2013 to the present day. After that, the associated cyber activities will be placed in\nthis legal context.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2 International Law and Cyber Operations\n\nThe applicability of international law to cyberspace has long been debated. Most\nWestern countries posit that existing international law applies. Some countries,\nsuch as China and Russia, have proposed a unique and separate set of norms.[1]\nToday, it is generally recognised that international law applies, which is illustrated\nby the 2013 report of the Governmental Group of Experts, established by the United\nNations (UN) General Assembly. It states that ‘International law, and in particular\nthe Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace\nand stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environ­\nment.’[2] However, the better question now concerns exactly how to apply interna­\ntional law in the cyber domain, and this is not a debate that will be resolved in\nthe near future.[3] NATO ‘recognises that international law, including international\nhumanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace’.[4] It also considers\ncyber defence to be an intrinsic part of its collective defence task, and has declared\nthat a cyber attack could have the impact as harmful as a conventional armed attack,\nwhich could lead to the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.[5]\n\nIn this chapter, the author takes as a premise that existing international law\napplies to cyberspace.\n\n##### 3 Legal Framework for the Conflict in Ukraine\n\n\n##### Cyber activities conducted as part of a wider conflict are governed by that con­ flict’s legal framework.\n\n\nCyber activities conducted as part of a wider\nconflict are governed by that conflict’s legal\nframework. This section will describe the\nwider conflict in Ukraine. Section 1.4 will\nexamine specific cyber incidents and how\nthey fit into the larger legal puzzle.\n\n\n1 United Nations, General Assembly, Letter Dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyr­\n_gyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, A/69/723,_\n2015.

On 21 November, Presi­\ndent Viktor Yanukovych decided to abandon the Association Agreement. This was\nfollowed by massive pro-EU demonstrations in _Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Indepen­_\ndence Square) in Kyiv. The clashes with the authorities grew violent. By mid-Febru­\nary, the events had escalated significantly, and had taken over 100 lives.\n\nBefore the _Euromaidan protests began, tensions in Ukraine had already trig­_\ngered hostile activity in cyberspace. Politically motivated hacker groups launched\nDistributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and other cyber attacks against a wide range\nof targets. On 28 October, the hacker group ‘Anonymous Ukraine’ started ‘Opera­\ntion Independence’ (#OpIndependence), favouring Ukraine’s independence from\nany external influence, including the EU, NATO, and Russia.[6] Operation Indepen­\ndence included DDoS attacks and website defacements against both Western and\nRussian sites. During _Euromaidan DDoS attacks and defacements against both_\nsides continued. Information leaks were used for propaganda purposes. Operation\nIndependence leaked emails from opposition leader Vitali Klitchko and his political\nparty, the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms. Unknown hackers leaked\nthe U.S. officials’ phone call which included the infamous statement, ‘f*ck the EU.’[7]\n\n_3.1.1 Legal Analysis_\nThe Euromaidan protests were the violent culmination of a conflict between gov­\nernment authorities and pro-Western, civilian groups. Although the controversy\nwas about Ukraine’s external relations, it was primarily an internal matter between\na state and an opposition within that state. And while the conflict engendered con­\nsiderable violence – one only has to look at the number of casualties – at that stage,\nit could not be seen as an ‘armed conflict’. It was not a conflict with ‘armed forces on\neither side engaged in hostilities [...] similar to an international war’.[8] The incidents\nhad the character of internal disturbances, civilian uprising, and violent clashes\nbetween protesters and police.\n\n**_3.2 Forming Interim Government and Annexation of Crimea (February – March 2014)_**\nOn 21 February, President Yanukovych fled to Russia, and an Interim Government\nwas formed, uniting the opposition. Events unfolded rapidly in Crimea. Pro-Rus­\nsian gunmen seized key government buildings. On 1 March, the upper house of the\nRussian Parliament approved the deployment of troops in Ukraine to protect the\n\n6 Eduard Kovacs. ‘Anonymous Ukraine Launches OpIndependence, Attacks European Investment Bank’, _Softpedia, 31 Oc­_\ntober 2013, http://news.softpedia.com/news/Anonymous-Ukraine-Launches-OpIndependence-Attacks-European-Invest­\nment-Bank-395790.shtml.\n7 Listen to recording here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL_GShyGv3o.\n8 ICRC Commentary to Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian speaking minority. Russian military forces (coined ‘little green men’) were\nreportedly present in Crimea and blocked the positions of Ukrainian troops.[9] A\nreferendum, initiated by the Crimean Parliament, was held in Crimea on 16 March,\nwhich declared that 97% of voters supported joining Russia. Two days later, Presi­\ndent Vladimir Putin signed a bill declaring Crimea to be part of the Russian Federa­\ntion.[10] These events were crucial in setting the stage for the ongoing conflict in east­\nern Ukraine, and led to a dramatic change in relations between Russia and the West.\n\nIn cyberspace, there was a simultaneous rise in malicious activity during the mil­\nitary operations in Crimea. Operations were conducted against Ukraine’s mobile\ninfrastructure, the mobile phones of members of the Ukrainian Parliament, and secu­\nrity communications. Some traditional methods were used, including the seizure of\n_Ukrtelecom offices and the physical cutting of telephone and internet cables.[11]_ Digital\nattacks included DDoS targeting Ukrainian, Crimean, NATO, and Russian websites.\nThe pro-Russian hacker group CyberBerkut was particularly active against NATO,[12]\nwhile groups like OpRussia and Russian CyberCommand directed their actions against\nRussian websites.[13] Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian websites were also defaced, includ­\ning the site of Russia Today, sometimes with historical references to World War II.[14]\n\nInformation leaks continued. A sensitive conversation between the Estonian Min­\nister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Paet [and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy)\n[and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was made public, revealing their discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy)\nof information suggesting that both sides, the opposition and the government, were\nresponsible for sniper killings during the Maidan protests.[15] Anti-Russian motivated\ninformation leaks included the disclosure of the names of members of _Berkut, the_\nanti-riot police,[16] as well as documents belonging to a Russian defence contractor.[17]\n\nDuring this time, it also became clear that the spyware _Snake (also known as_\n_Ouruborus or Turla) was used against several targets in Ukraine, including the gov­_\nernment. Snake is sophisticated malware, known to be in use for at least eight years,\nwhose origin is uncertain, but believed to be developed in Russia.[18]\n\n9 Vitaly Shevchenko. ‘“Little green men” or “Russian invaders”?’, _[BBC News, 11 March 2014, http://www.bbc.com/news/](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26532154)_\n[world-europe-26532154.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26532154)\n10 [See for an overview of events: ‘Ukraine crisis: timeline’, BBC News, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275)\n11 John Leyden. ‘Battle apparently under way in Russia-Ukraine conflict’, _[The Register, 4 March 2014, http://www.theregister.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/04/ukraine_cyber_conflict/)_\n[co.uk/2014/03/04/ukraine_cyber_conflict/.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/04/ukraine_cyber_conflict/)\n12 [Adrian Croft and Peter Apps. ‘NATO websites hit in cyber attack linked to Crimea tension’, Reuters, 16 March 2014, http://](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/16/us-ukraine-nato-idUSBREA2E0T320140316)\n[www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/16/us-ukraine-nato-idUSBREA2E0T320140316.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/16/us-ukraine-nato-idUSBREA2E0T320140316)\n13 [Jeffrey Carr. ‘Rival hackers fighting proxy war over Crimea’, Reuters, 25 March 2014, http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/25/opin­](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/25/opinion/crimea-cyber-war/)\n[ion/crimea-cyber-war/.

States\nhave the right to act when necessary to rescue their nationals abroad. However, in\nthis case, there were no indications that native Russians were in danger. Even if that\nwere the case, it could only have justified their evacuation, not the occupation of the\nentire peninsula.[20] A second possible justification for Russian intervention was an\ninvitation by the Ukrainian authorities, i.e. President Yanukovych. But, after Yanu­\nkovych was replaced by the Interim Government, his actions could not be attributed\nto Ukraine anymore.[21] A third possible justification is the right to self-determina­\ntion for the people of Crimea. However, while this right exists for ‘peoples’ within\nthe existing borders of a state, it does not allow for a complete political separation.[22]\n\nRussia’s annexation of Crimea was a breach of international law by violating\nthe territorial integrity of Ukraine. Russia also\nbreached the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and _Russia’s annexation of_\nthe 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation,\n\n##### Crimea was a breach of\n\nand Partnership.[23] The Black Sea Fleet Status of\nForces Agreement allowed for a Russian mili­ _international law._\ntary presence in Crimea, but not at the scale as\nwas the case in March 2014. But was this armed intervention also a use of force, a\nviolation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter?[24] Moving armed forces to the territory of\nanother state, without the consent of that state, should definitely be considered a use\nof force.[25] That is exactly what happened: troops belonging to the Russian Black Sea\nFleet in Crimea left their bases, and there were clear indications that other Russian\n\n19 [ʻ[A] spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivered a statement saying that he was ‘gravely concerned about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General)\nthe deterioration of the situation’ in Ukraine and planned to speak shortly with Putin.

In this\ncase the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nCould Russia’s actions be seen as an armed attack, in which case Ukraine would\nhave had the right to use force in self-defence?[26] Like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’\nis not defined in the UN Charter; in essence, a state determines on a case-by-case\nbasis whether it considers an attack against it as an ‘armed attack’. A violent attack\nwith military forces resulting in damage and casualties would certainly be seen as an\narmed attack. In the case of Crimea, however, hardly a shot was fired. On the other\nhand, it is difficult to argue that Ukraine would not have the right to use force to\ndrive Russian troops out of Crimea.[27]\n\nIrrespective this analysis of the legal basis of the intervention in Crimea, what\nwould be the legal regime for the operations conducted by the parties to the con­\nflict, including the cyber operations? Did the situation qualify as an ‘international\narmed conflict’ where the Law of Armed Conflict applies? The criterion here is that\nit relates to hostilities between nation-states. In Crimea, however, the situation was\nunclear. Firstly, there was no fighting, although the threshold for ‘armed’ is low.[28]\nSecondly, Russia denied the troops present were theirs and referred to them as\n‘local self-defence groups’. However, reports indicated the active involvement of\nRussian troops[29] and, eventually, Putin admitted that Russian troops were present.[30]\nEven in the event that only local forces were active, a situation of international\narmed conflict could still prevail if they were acting under Russia’s control.\n\nThe Law of Armed Conflict also\napplies in a situation of a total or partial\n\n##### The Law of Armed Conflict\n\noccupation, even if the occupation did not\n\n##### applies in a situation of\n\nmeet armed resistance.[31] Occupation is a\n\n##### total or partial occupation. ‘hostile substitution of territorial power\n\nand authority’.[32] This is precisely the case\nin Crimea, where Russia exercises territorial control without the consent of the\nUkrainian Government.\n\n26 Charter of the United Nations, Article 51.\n27 Deeks. ‘What International Law Says.’\n28 ‘Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict\nwithin the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.

Protesters from the Russian speaking minority in\nthe cities of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv occupied government buildings and called\nfor independence.[33] Pro-Russian ‘separatist groups’ emerged. The Ukrainian authorities\nresponded by starting an ‘anti-terrorist operation’. On 17 April, the first violent deaths\noccurred in eastern Ukraine; in the Black Sea city of Odessa, 42 people died in clashes.\nOn 11 May, Donetsk and Luhansk declared themselves to be independent republics.\n\nPetro Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May, but this poll\ncould not be held in large parts of the conflict-ridden east. A cease-fire agreement,[34]\nsigned in Minsk on 5 September 2014, collapsed when fighting started again in\nJanuary 2015. A second agreement signed in the capital of Belarus on 11 February,\n_Minsk II, provided for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front_\nline, a release of prisoners of war, and constitutional reform in Ukraine.[35] This sec­\nond agreement has also been violated, although currently, in September 2015, the\nsituation seems to have calmed down. NATO reported the active involvement of\nRussian troops in eastern Ukraine,[36] but Russia has consistently denied involvement.\n\nCyber operations have continued throughout the conflict. In May 2014, cyber\nmeans were used in an attempt to disrupt the presidential elections, including an\neffort to falsify the outcome. _CyberBerkut_ may have taken part and some analysts\nbelieve that Russia was behind it.[37] In August 2014, hackers conducted a DDoS attack\nagainst Ukraine’s election commission website, just prior to the parliamentary polls.[38]\n\nThere are numerous publicly-known examples of intelligence gathering through\ncyber means, all of which reportedly have a Russian connection. In the Summer\nof 2014, the Blackenergy spyware was used against Ukrainian government institu­\ntions.[39] In August, the Snake malware was employed against the Ukrainian Prime\nMinister’s Office, as well as a number of foreign embassies.[40] In April 2015, Looking­\n_lass reported on a Russian campaign to extract classified documents from Ukrainian_\nmilitary and law enforcement agencies in an effort to support pro-Russian military\n\n33 [‘Ukraine crisis: Timeline’, BBC News, accessed 1 August 2015, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275)\n34 [Protocol on the results of consultations of the Trilateral Contact Group, Minsk, 5 September 2014, http://mfa.gov.ua/en/news-](http://mfa.gov.ua/en/news-feeds/foreign-offices-news/27596-protocolon-the-results-of-consultations-of-the-trilateral-contact-group-minsk-05092014)\n[feeds/foreign-offices-news/27596-protocolon-the-results-of-consultations-of-the-trilateral-contact-group-minsk-05092014.](http://mfa.gov.ua/en/news-feeds/foreign-offices-news/27596-protocolon-the-results-of-consultations-of-the-trilateral-contact-group-minsk-05092014)\n35 ‘Ukraine ceasefire: New Minsk agreement key points’, _[BBC News, 12 February 2015, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-eu­](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31436513)_\n[rope-31436513.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31436513)\n36 See for example: ‘NATO Commander: ‘Conditions in Eastern Ukraine Have to Change’’, OPB, 6 February 2015, http://www.\nopb.org/news/article/npr-nato-commander-conditions-in-eastern-ukraine-have-to-change/, and ‘Nato urges Russia to stop\nfuelling Ukraine conflict’, The Irish Times, 15 April 2015, http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/nato-urges-russiato-stop-fuelling-ukraine-conflict-1.2176718.\n37 Mark Clayton. ‘Ukraine election narrowly avoided ‘wanton destruction’ from hackers (+video)’, The Christian Science Monitor,\n[17 June 2014, http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2014/0617/Ukraine-election-narrowly-avoided-wanton-destruc­](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2014/0617/Ukraine-election-narrowly-avoided-wanton-destruction-from-hackers-video)\n[tion-from-hackers-video.](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2014/0617/Ukraine-election-narrowly-avoided-wanton-destruction-from-hackers-video)\n38 ‘Hackers attack Ukraine election website’, _[Presstv, 25 October 2014, http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/10/25/383623/ukrai­](http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/10/25/383623/ukraines-election-website-hacked/)_\n[nes-election-website-hacked/.

In January 2015,\n_CyberBerkut claimed responsibility for a cyber attack on German Government sites,_\ndemanding that Germany end its support to the Ukrainian government.[43]\n\nOn the pro-Ukraine side, the Ukrainian Cyber Troops reportedly claimed to have\nhacked into Russian interior ministry servers and CCTV cameras in separatist-con­\ntrolled eastern Ukraine.[44]\n\n_3.3.1 Legal Analysis_\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has characterised the situa­\ntion in eastern Ukraine as a ‘non-international armed conflict’,[45] a situation in which\nhostilities occur between governmental armed forces and non-governmental organ­\nised armed groups, or between such organised armed groups. The two requirements\nare a certain degree of organisation of the non-governmental groups and the exis­\ntence of ‘protracted armed violence’.[46] The conflict in Eastern Ukraine does in fact\nreach a high level of violence over a longer period of time, and the separatists do in\nfact have a high degree of organisation.\n\nAlthough Russia has consistently denied involvement, there continues to be\nwidespread belief to the contrary, suggesting that Moscow actively supports the\nDonetsk and Luhansk separatists, including by sending Russian military forces as\n‘volunteers’ to the area. If Russia actively participates or exercises ‘overall control’\nover the separatists, the conflict could be considered an international armed con­\nflict. To meet the criterion of ‘overall control’, a state must not only finance, train,\nequip, or provide operational support to local forces, but also have a role in organ­\nising, coordinating, and planning their operations.[47]\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this chapter, the conflict in eastern Ukraine is con­\nsidered to be a non-international armed conflict.\n\nThis analysis results in a situation where different legal regimes apply simultane­\n\n41 [Aarti Shahani. ‘Report: To Aid Combat, Russia Wages Cyberwar Against Ukraine’, NPR, 28 April 2015, http://www.npr.org/](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/04/28/402678116/report-to-aid-combat-russia-wages-cyberwar-against-ukraine)\n[sections/alltechconsidered/2015/04/28/402678116/report-to-aid-combat-russia-wages-cyberwar-against-ukraine.](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/04/28/402678116/report-to-aid-combat-russia-wages-cyberwar-against-ukraine)\n42 Ellen Nakashima. ‘Russian hackers use ‘zero-day’ to hack NATO, Ukraine in cyber-spy campaign’, The Washington Post, 13\n[October 2014, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-use-zero-day-to-hack-nato-ukrai­](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-use-zero-day-to-hack-nato-ukraine-in-cyber-spy-campaign/2014/10/13/f2452976-52f9-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html)\n[ne-in-cyber-spy-campaign/2014/10/13/f2452976-52f9-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-use-zero-day-to-hack-nato-ukraine-in-cyber-spy-campaign/2014/10/13/f2452976-52f9-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html)\n43 Michelle Martin and Erik Kirschbaum. ‘Pro-Russian group claims cyber attack on German government websites’, Reuters, 7\n[January 2015, http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/07/us-germany-cyberattack-idUSKBN0KG15320150107.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/07/us-germany-cyberattack-idUSKBN0KG15320150107)\n44 ‘The Daily Beast: Ukraine’s lonely cyber warrior,’ KyivPost, 18 February 2015, http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine-ab­\nroad/the-daily-beast-ukraines-lonely-cyber-warrior-381094.html, and Vitaly Shevchenko, ‘Ukraine conflict: Hackers take si­\ndes in virtual war’, BBC News, 20 December 2014, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30453069.\n45 ‘Fighting in eastern Ukraine continues to take its toll on civilians, and we urge all sides to comply with international human­\nitarian law, otherwise known as the law of armed conflict’, said Mr Stillhart. ‘These rules and principles apply to all parties to\nthe non-international armed conflict in Ukraine, and impose restrictions on the means and methods of warfare that they may\nuse [in Ukraine]’: ICRC calls on all sides to respect international humanitarian law, ICRC News Release 14/125, 23 July 2014.\nNon-international armed conflicts are ‘armed conflicts not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the\nHigh Contracting Parties,’ Geneva Conventions, Common Article 3.\n46 The criterion ‘protracted armed violence’ stems from Tadić, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal, para 70,\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2 October 1995.\n47 ‘Overall control’ is addressed in: Tadić, Appeals Chamber judgment, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugosla­\nvia, 15 July 1999, para 132, 137, 141, and 145.

Eastern Ukraine is a national issue in which the law\npursuant to non-international armed conflicts applies. There is a crucial difference.\nDuring an international armed conflict, the Law of Armed Conflict applies to the\nfull extent; during a non-international armed conflict, minimum rules apply.[48] An\nexample is that in an international armed conflict, combatants captured by the\nenemy are entitled to Prisoner of War (PoW) status. In a non-international armed\nconflict, the combatant’s status is unknown; belligerents have to be treated well, but\nthe extensive rules that protect PoWs do not apply. However, many rules of inter­\nnational armed conflict are customary law and apply also in a non-international\narmed conflict, as we will see with respect to cyber operations.\n\n##### 4 Legal Implications for Cyber Operations in Ukraine\n\nThe conflict started as an internal matter, the protests at Maidan Square, to an\nunlawful intervention and occupation of Crimea, culminating in the non-interna­\ntional armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDuring the first phase, the Euromaidan protests, the cyber incidents were a law\nenforcement issue. For example, the defacement of websites and DDoS attacks\nrestricting the use of internet services violated Ukrainian criminal law and could\nhave been prosecuted in Ukrainian courts.[49] Malicious cross-border cyber activ­\nities, involving both Ukraine and other countries, would fall under the criminal\njurisdiction of Ukraine and the affected countries.\n\nDuring the occupation of Crimea and the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, the\nLaw of Armed Conflict applies. It regu­\nlates the conduct of all actors in the con­ _During the Euromaidan_\nflict, including the cyber actors. Hereafter,\n\n##### protests, cyber incidents were\n\nfirst the status of the different cyber actors\nwill be discussed; after that the cyber _a law enforcement issue._\noperations we have seen in the Ukraine\nconflict will be evaluated from the perspective of the Law of Armed Conflict.\n\n**_4.1 Actors in Cyberspace_**\nIn an international armed conflict, belligerents that qualify as ‘combatants’ enjoy combat­\nant immunity, meaning they cannot be prosecuted for taking part in hostilities (except\n\n48 These ‘minimum rules’ are formulated in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, and in Additional Protocol II to the\nGeneva Conventions. The rules laid down in that protocol apply to a conflict within a state that is party to the Protocol between\nthe armed forces of that state and dissident armed forces or organised armed groups that control sufficient territory so ‘as to\nenable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations’, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12\nAugust 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977, Article\n1(1). Ukraine is party to Additional Protocol II, and the separatists do control significant territory.\n49 Ukraine is Party to the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 2001). The Convention aims to harmonise cybercrime legisla­\ntion and facilitate information exchange and international cooperation in the area of prosecution of cybercrimes. States that\nare party to the convention are obliged to incorporate certain violations in their national laws: ‘illegal access’, ‘illegal intercep­\ntion’, ‘data interference’, ‘system interference’, and ‘misuse of devices’.\n\n\n-----\n\nfor war crimes) and, on capture, have PoW status. These rules also apply during occu­\npation, as in Crimea. Most cyber actors in Crimea were nominally non-state actors, for\nexample the pro-Russian hacker group CyberBerkut. If such a group were an integrated\npart of Russia’s military forces, they would be combatants. If not, they could nevertheless\nbe considered combatants if they were part of an organised armed group, belonging to a\nparty to the conflict, when they fulfil the following conditions: (a) being commanded by\na person responsible for his subordinates; (b) having a fixed distinctive sign recognisable\nat a distance; (c) carrying arms openly; and (d) conducting their operations in accor­\ndance with the laws and customs of war.[50] These criteria are important to distinguish\ncombatants from civilians. It is unlikely that non-state hacker groups, also those active\nin the Ukraine crisis, meet all these criteria, especially when they are only ‘virtually’\norganised, only in contact through the internet.\n\nHackers or hacker groups who are non-combatants are to be regarded civilians.\nHowever, if they are ‘directly participating in hostilities’, they lose their protection as\ncivilians and can be targeted by the opposing party. Three criteria have to be met to be\nregarded ‘civilians directly participating in hostilities.’[ 51] First, there has to be a certain\namount of ‘harm’; the ‘act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or\nmilitary capacity of [the adversary] or […] to inflict death, injury or destruction on\npersons or objects protected against direct attack’.[52] Second, there has to be a ‘causal\nconnexion’ between the acts and the harm inflicted. Third, there has to be a ‘bellig­\nerent nexus’, meaning that the operations must be intended to affect the adversary’s\nmilitary operations. Harm can also be inflicted by cyber operations, and does not nec­\nessarily have to include physical damage. In the case of CyberBerkut and other active\nhacker groups the effects probably did not reach the threshold of ‘harm’.\n\nIn non-international armed conflicts, like in eastern Ukraine, ‘combatant immunity’\ndoes not exist. Whether or not belligerents – especially non-state armed groups – have\nimmunity, will be determined based on domestic law. Certain cyber operations will be\nillegal based on domestic law. Civilians have protected status, but as in international armed\nconflicts, when they are ‘directly participating in hostilities’ they lose that protected status.\n\n**_4.2 Information Operations_**\nDuring the conflict in Ukraine, cyber was mainly used for information warfare and\nintelligence gathering – not to damage cyber or critical infrastructure. Irrespective\ntheir effects, cyber operations are very often called ‘cyber attack.’ It is important to note\nthat, in the context of international and non-international armed conflicts, ‘attack’ has\na very specific meaning. ‘Attacks means acts of violence against the adversary, whether\nin offence or in defence.’[53] Whether or not an operation qualifies as attack is crucial\n\n50 Geneva Convention (III), 12 August 1949, Article 4, para A(2).\n51 ICRC Interpretive guidance on the notion of Direct Participation in hostilities under international humanitarian law, May\n2009.\n52 ICRC Interpretive guidance, 47.\n53 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International\nArmed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, Article 49(1).\n\n\n-----\n\nbecause the law imposes prohibitions and restrictions with respect to attacks, for\nexample the prohibition to attack civilians, civilian objects, and medical installations,\nand the requirement to take precautions before conducting an attack. Not every cyber\noperation that affects the adversary is an attack. A cyber operation that constitutes an\nact of violence however, is an attack. The Tallinn Manual defines a ‘cyber attack’ as ‘a\ncyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause\ninjury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.’[54] This interpretation of\nthe current law restricts ‘cyber attacks’ to acts that have physical consequences.\n\nIf the parties to the conflict in Ukraine would have used cyber to inflict physical\ndamage, injuries, or death, or to support kinetic operations, those cyber operations\nwould be ‘(cyber) attacks’ and subject to the relevant prohibitions and restrictions.\nMost of the cyber activities in Ukraine however are information operations and do\nnot meet the ‘attack’ threshold. Information operations, as such, are not directly\naddressed in the Law of Armed Conflict.\nWhether they would be in violation of the law _Information operations,_\nbasically depends on the content of the message. _as such, are not directly_\nOne example would be disseminating a threat­ _addressed in the Law of_\nening message with the purpose to spread terror\n\n##### Armed Conflict.\n\namong the civilian population.[55] The disruption\nof elections, that took place in Ukraine, definitely violated domestic law, and when\nconducted or supported by another state, could also have been a breach of interna­\ntional law, but was not a violation of the Law of Armed Conflict.\n\n**_4.3 Cyber Espionage_**\nDuring the conflict in Ukraine, cyber means have been used to gather intelligence\nincluding Snake, Blackenergy, and Sandworm. Intelligence gathering and espionage\nare not forbidden by international law. Espionage, in the context of the Law of Armed\nConflict, has a narrow scope: it refers to operations that are conducted clandestinely\nor under false pretences, taking place on territory controlled by the adversary; ‘behind\nenemy lines’.[56] For instance, a close access cyber operation where an agent is gaining\naccess to servers being used by the adversary by feigning a false identity and extracting\ninformation by using a thumb drive, could be espionage. An agent captured before\nreaching his own troops has no PoW status and can be tried as a spy. Gathering intel­\nligence from a distance is not espionage in the meaning of the Law of Armed Conflict.\n\n_Snake,_ _Blackenergy, and_ _Sandworm reportedly have a Russian connection. If_\nRussia – or another state – would be actively supporting the separatists in eastern\nUkraine by providing intelligence, that would not necessarily ‘internationalise’ the\nconflict. Mere operational support does not meet the ‘overall control’ threshold.[57]\n\n54 _Tallinn Manual, 106._\n55 Protocol I, Article 51(2), and Protocol II, Article 13(2).\n56 _Tallinn Manual, 192-193._\n57 _Tallinn Manual, 81._\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5 Conclusions\n\nInternational law applies to cyberspace. During armed conflict, the Law of Armed\nConflict applies to any cyber operation conducted in association with the hostilities.\nUntil now, we have not seen a case where cyber hostilities between parties by them­\n_selves constituted an armed conflict. Rather, they have remained as one part of a larger,_\ntraditional conflict. This dynamic has not changed during the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThis chapter describes the international legal framework for the conflict in\nUkraine and the cyber operations that have been conducted in association with that\nconflict. The ‘legal situation’ is somewhat unclear due to diverging views on various\naspects of the crisis, such as the annexation of Crimea and the alleged involvement\nof Russian military forces in eastern Ukraine. Another aspect that complicates a\nlegal evaluation is that cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors,\nwhose status and affiliation are not always clear.\n\nThe protests at Maidan Square turned violent, but they were not an ‘armed con­\nflict’; they were an internal law enforcement matter. The annexation of Crimea led\nto the peninsula’s occupation by Russia, but Russia disputes that interpretation.\nDuring an occupation, the Law of Armed Conflict applies. Eastern Ukraine can\ntoday be considered a non-international armed conflict, where cyber operations\nmust be conducted in accordance with the minimum safeguards the Law of Armed\n\nConflict provides for such situations.\n\nIn the Ukraine conflict, the publicly\n\n##### Cyber operations are often\n\nknown cyber operations have not gen­\n\n##### conducted by non-state erally been considered to be sophisti­ actors, whose status and affil­ cated – likely not corresponding to the iation are not always clear. real national capabilities of Russia and\n\nUkraine. The prevailing assumption is\nthat, with the exception of some advanced\ncyber espionage malware such as Snake, the known cyber attacks could have been con­\nducted by non-state actors. These hackers or hacker groups, trying to affect the adver­\nsary’s military activities, are participating in hostilities and have to conduct their opera­\ntions in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict.\n\nAt the end of the day, cyber operations in the Ukraine conflict have been used\neither to gather intelligence or as part of an ongoing ‘information war’ between the\nparties. They were not launched to inflict damage to infrastructure and other military\ncapabilities. As a result, most of these cyber operations have not yet risen to the level\nof activities proscribed or even governed by the Law of Armed Conflict. That would\nbe different when cyber would be more integrated in kinetic warfare operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 15\n\n The Ukraine Crisis\n as a Test for Proposed\n Cyber Norms\n\n##### Henry Rõigas\n\n_NATO CCD COE_\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\nIn international forums, governments, academia, and the private sector have stren­\nuously argued that states must agree on existing or develop a set of international\nnorms for conflict in cyberspace. Our current environment is characterised by a\nsteep rise in the development of offensive cyber tools and tactics – as well as a gen­\neral disagreement on when and where it is appropriate to use them. The overall\nresult is a popular perception of a weakened international security environment that\nthreatens to devolve into an anarchic Hobbesian world of ‘all against all’. Against this\nbackdrop, there have been urgent calls for greater investment in cyber diplomacy.[1]\n\nThe term ‘norm’ has become some­\nwhat of a buzzword in these discussions _The term ‘norm’ has become_\nused to argue that states should adhere _somewhat of a buzzword._\nto certain rules of behaviour with regard\nto conducting cyber operations. This chapter will thus first describe the nature of\n‘cyber norms’ and then discuss the primary developments in the global arena. The\nauthor’s focus will be on the proposed cyber norms of behaviour that would have\na politically binding character, and will avoid discussing existing international law\n\n1 [See, for example, developments in the United Nations: http://www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity/, and The](http://www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity/)\nCouncil of the European Union’s conclusions on cyber diplomacy: http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-61222015-INIT/en/pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\n(legal norms)[2] as well as the challenges of practical implementation of the these\nnorms.\n\nFinally, this chapter will analyse the Ukraine crisis in light of these propos­\nals, and attempt to assess their rationality and applicability. The Russo-Ukrainian\nconflict, in theory, offers a suitable case study in that there has been ample room\nfor malicious state-sponsored cyber activities: first, nation-states perceived as\nhaving considerable cyber capabilities – not only Russia and Ukraine, but also\nsurrounding nations and the member states of NATO – are involved, at least indi­\nrectly; and second, the crisis has both endured and evolved from the Euromaidan\nstreet protests to the Russian annexation of Crimea to open, armed conflict in\neastern Ukraine.\n\n##### 2 Proposed ‘Political’ Cyber Norms\n\nIn international relations, norms are often defined as ‘collective expectations of\nproper behaviour for an actor with a given identity’,[3] which is broad enough that\nstates (and other stakeholders) use the term to put forward a wide range of propos­\nals in diplomatic forums. This chapter takes a simplified approach, limiting its scope\n\nto (1) legal and (2) political norms: the\n\n##### Norms reflect the interna­ ‘proper behaviour’ of states is comprehen­ tional community’s expec­ sively regulated by international law (i.e.\n\n_legal norms such as treaties, international_\n\n##### tations, set standards for\n\ncustoms, and general principles of inter­\n\n##### responsible State behaviour. national law)[4] and through cyber diplo­\n\nmacy in the form of political or non-legally\nbinding agreements. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN\nGGE) has explained the nature of these politically binding instruments by stating\nthat ‘norms reflect the international community’s expectations, set standards for\nresponsible State behaviour and allow the international community to assess the\nactivities and intentions of States’. The problem, of course, is that breaches of such\npolitical norms only give rise to political, non-legal consequences.[5]\n\nThere has been some agreement between nation states on setting international\n‘cyber norms’. In 2013, the UN published an accord, written by a GGE including\nrepresentatives from the US, UK, China, and Russia, expressing consensus on the\n\n2 For a discussion on the role of legal cyber norms, see Michael N.

For a concept listing policy responses to\ncyber incidents, see Tobias Feakin. ‘Developing a Proportionate Response to a Cyber Incident’ Council on Foreign Relations,\nAugust 2015, http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/developing-proportionate-response-cyber-incident/p36927.\n\n\n-----\n\nbasic notion that existing international law applies to cyberspace.[ 6] In 2015, the same\nforum published another report[7] which delved into greater detail, but the GGE has\npreviously not elaborated on precisely how to apply existing laws (legal norms) to\nthe nuanced field of cyber security. The reports did state, however, that the unique\nattributes of information and communications technology (ICTs) could demand\nthe creation of altogether new norms.\n\nThe fairly general agreement expressed in the reports can be viewed both as\nthe lowest common denominator between the world’s key cyber powers and as a\nmanifestation of a general lack of clarity in this new geopolitical arena. Meanwhile\nacademia has to some degree filled the void, actively addressing the applicabil­\nity of existing international law,[8] although work in the area of state practice and\ninterpretation has been relatively limited. In the context of norms restraining state\nbehaviour, existing international law such as the prohibition on the use of force and\nthe law of armed conflict (LOAC) are highly relevant and indispensable, but it is\nlikely that additional norms – political rather than legal – will be developed by the\ninternational community over time. Two somewhat opposing approaches to these\nnew political norms will be addressed below.\n\nOne group of nations acting as ‘norm entrepreneurs’[9] seems to aim for a trea­\nty-level agreement to govern state activities in cyberspace. Member nations of the\nShanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)[10] have proposed a Code of Conduct for\nInternational Information Security[11] to the UN. In parallel, Russia has developed (in\n2011) a separate concept for a Convention on International Information Security[12]\nwhich covers, to a large extent, the same territory.\n\nThese proposed instruments do not apply the prefix ‘cyber’ when addressing\nICT-related issues; instead, the focus is on preserving ‘information security’ which\nrepresents a broad conceptualisation of the threat environment and the scope of\nlimited state activities.[13] According to SCO’s own agreement on information secu­\nrity (the Yekaterinburg Agreement of 2009)[14] and the aforementioned Convention\nproposal by Russia (2011), ‘information war’ entails, in addition to damaging infor­\nmation systems and critical infrastructures (which is often the ‘Western’ scope of\n\n6 United Nations, General Assembly, _Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Tele­_\n_communications in the Context of International Security, A/69/723, 2013, http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol­_\n=A/68/98.\n7 United Nations, General Assembly, _Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Tele­_\n_communications in the Context of International Security, A/70/174, 2015, http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/_\nN15/228/35/PDF/N1522835.pdf?OpenElement.\n8 [See the Tallinn Manual process: https://ccdcoe.org/research.html.](https://ccdcoe.org/research.html)\n9 See Finnemore and Sikkink. “International Norm Dynamics and Political Change,” October 1, 1998.\n10 Member States of the SCO are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.\n11 United Nations, General Assembly, Letter Dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyr­\n_gyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, A/69/723,_\n2015, https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/UN-150113-CodeOfConduct.pdf.\n12 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. _Convention on International Information Security (Concept),_\n2011, http://www.mid.ru/bdomp/ns-osndoc.nsf/1e5f0de28fe77fdcc32575d900298676/7b17ead7244e2064c3257925003bcbc­\nc!OpenDocument.\n13 See, for example, James A.

It asks states\nto refrain from ‘activities which run counter to the task of maintaining interna­\ntional peace and security’ and highlights a state’s responsibility to protect ‘infor­\nmation space and critical information infrastructure against damage resulting\nfrom threats, interference, attack and sabotage’. Further, it includes a section that\nprohibits states from using ‘dominant position in ICTs’ to engage in the afore­\n\n\nmentioned activities.

However, if the Code\nof Conduct would actually be adopted in the current form, it could not be con­\nsidered as a source of international law (a legal instrument) since the norms are\nof a politically binding character due their ‘aspirational’ and non-compulsory\nnature.[17]\n\nThe Code of Conduct has not been put to a vote as adoption at the UN is highly\nunlikely due to opposition from many liberal democracies. An alternative strategy,\npromoted initially by the US, is to strengthen international cyber security through\nvoluntary norms of behaviour that pertain during peacetime.[18] According to this\nlogic, most cyber operations fall below the\n‘use of force’ threshold, which means that _An alternative strategy_\nmost of the existing legal norms regulating _is to strengthen inter­_\ninterstate cyber operations are not suffi­\n\n##### national cyber security\n\ncient.[19] During the height of the cyber inci­\ndents in Ukraine, the US promoted the fol­ _through voluntary norms._\n\n15 See, for example, Keir Giles. ‘Russia’s Public Stance on Cyberspace Issues,‘ in 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Con­\n_flict, ed.

For example,\nMicrosoft has recommended six cybersecurity norms designed to limit the prolifer­\nation of cyber weapons and offensive operations in cyberspace.[22]\n\n##### 3 Observations from Ukraine:\n Hints of State-sponsored Operations\n\nThe attribution of cyber attacks is notoriously difficult. In order to discover\nstate-sponsored operations, one can only speculate based upon inconclusive indica­\ntors such as target, malware, motive, and complexity.\n\nIn Ukraine, some advanced cyber espionage tools such as Turla/Snake/Ouro­\nbours and Sandworm have not only been linked to the conflict, but also associated\nwith an ‘Advanced Persistent Threat’ (APT) actor (i.e. nation-state), likely Russia.[23]\nAt the same time, analysts have argued that most of the cyber attack methods in\nUkraine such as DDoS attacks and defacements have been technically unsophisti­\ncated. Thus, on balance, the ‘complexity criterion’ appears unmet.\n\n20 Painter. Testimony of Christopher M. E.

The internet is a natural terrain for these operations;[28] the reported\n‘troll factories’ in St. Petersburg creating pro-Russian comments for online new\nmedia serve as prominent examples.[29]\n\n##### 4 Which Norms of Behaviour Were Followed?\n\nThus, there are two dominant ongoing conversations relative to the creation of\npolitical cyber norms: (1) the information security norms proposed by the SCO,\nand (2) the voluntary norms of behaviour in peacetime (initially promoted by the\nUS).

However, one important\nquestion, given that Russia is directly involved in the Ukraine conflict, is how these\ncyber incidents fit into the Code of Conduct\nframework whose primary focus is informa­ _Alleged Russian cyber_\ntion sovereignty. In that regard, alleged Rus­\n\n##### operations appear incon­\n\nsian cyber operations would appear inconsis­\ntent with the norms it has hitherto proposed _sistent with the norms it_\nor supported. In fact, most of the cyber inci­ _has hitherto proposed._\ndents reported by both sides in the conflict\nseem to fall into the category of information operations, which could be interpreted\nas violating another state’s information sovereignty. In the words of the Code of\nConduct, ICTs were likely used in an effort to interfere ‘in the internal affairs of\nother States […] with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social\nstability’.\n\nSince the norms supported by SCO and Russia focus on ‘information’ rather\nthan strictly ‘cyber’ security, one can see that the non-cyber information opera­\ntions via other media such as TV are also inconsistent with the stated principle of\ninformation sovereignty. The Code of Conduct also prohibits the abuse of a ‘dom­\ninant position’ in cyberspace; in this regard too, Russia may have violated its own\nprinciples by abusing its control over Russian-owned social media networks such\nas Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki which are also popular among Ukrainian users.[31]\n\nAnalysing the application of the SCO-proposed information security norms\nreveals an inherent weakness: quantifying the influence of highly subjective infor­\nmation content or identifying a breach of ‘information sovereignty’ is problematic,\nif not impossible.\n\n**_4.2 The Voluntary Norms of Behaviour in Peacetime_**\nThe voluntary, politically binding norms advocated by the US (and partly recom­\nmended by the UN GGE) are intended to apply in peacetime. Nonetheless – and\nhowever one classifies the Ukraine conflict from a legal perspective[32] – we can still\nspeculate relative to their application during a time of conflict.\n\nIn Ukraine, the most important observation so far is that no destructive cyber\nattacks on critical infrastructure (CI) have been reported by either side. To some\ndegree, this offers hope that the norm of limiting cyber attacks against CI could\n\n30 See collection of legal arguments related to the use of force in the Ukraine conflict, ‘Debate Map: Ukraine Use of Force,‘ ac­\ncessed August 17, 2015, http://opil.ouplaw.com/page/ukraine-use-of-force-debate-map.\n31 Margarita Jaitner and Peter A.

With that in mind, even well-established\nnorms are mere ‘collective expectations of proper behaviour’[38], and it is unrealistic\nto assume that every actor (especially a nation at war) would always abide by them.\n\nAssuming there have been no attacks against CI in Ukraine, can we say that this\nis another example of cyber powers restraining themselves?[39] First, this restraint\nmay be strongly influenced by case-specific\nfactors, as explained by Martin Libicki in _Is it possible that cyber does_\nChapter 12.

More likely,\nit can be understood as one additional weapon in a state’s arsenal, and that existing\nnorms – both legal and political – governing traditional state-to-state actions are still\nfollowed as if they were applying to other, more conventional attack methods.\n\nAs of October 2015, the examples of cyber incidents in the Ukraine crisis allow\nus to make tentative observations about the other proposed norms of behaviours\n(2, 3, and 4). In respect of norm number 2, there have been no reported allegations\nof interference with the work of the national CERTs. However, although some per­\nsonal communications may have continued, there have been few official CERT to\nCERT discussions since the conflict began.[45] Against number 3, there have been no\npublished reports of recent Russo-Ukrainian cybercrime investigations,[46] but that\nmay be too much to hope for given that the two countries are currently in open\nconflict. However, the fact that Russia is unwilling to accede to the Budapest Con­\nvention on Cybercrime does not stand in its favour.\n\nThe final norm, number 4, which asks states not to steal intellectual property\nvia cyber means, is also likely not followed, given the two countries’ current state of\nhostilities and numerous reports of ongoing cyber espionage. Adopting the norm\nconcerning cyber espionage is in any case fraught with challenges, as its primary\nnorm entrepreneur, the US, has been heavily criticised by both allies and adversar­\nies in the wake of the Snowden revelations. Further, it can be difficult – if not highly\nsubjective – to determine whether any given attack was intended for political or\neconomic gain. On a global level, cyber espionage appears to be a silently accepted\nnorm. The latest UN GGE (2015), for example, did not mention it in its latest pub­\nlication, signalling that the international community is currently not motivated to\naddress the topic, and its global curtailment, at least in the short term, is unlikely.\n\n##### 5 Conclusion\n\nThe Ukraine case study suggests that, during this conflict, nation-states have not\nadhered to many of the proposed ‘political’ cyber norms covered in this chapter.\nHence, it is doubtful that these rules will be globally accepted in the near future.\n\n43 See, for example, note 40 on ‘The Cyberskeptics’, and discussion between Jarno Limnéll and Thomas Rid. ‘Is Cyberwar Real?,‘\n_Foreign Affairs, March/April 2014, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/global-commons/2014-02-12/cyberwar-real._\n44 See, for example, Martin Libicki. ‘Would Deterrence in Cyberspace Work Even with Attribution?,‘ Georgetown Journal of Inter­\n_national Affairs, April 22, 2015, http://journal.georgetown.edu/would-deterrence-in-cyberspace-work-even-with-attribution/._\n45 Conversations with Ukrainian cyber security experts.\n46 Brian Ries. ‘Gang of Cyber Criminals on the Run in Ukraine and Russia,‘Mashable, June 3, 2014, http://mashable.\ncom/2014/06/03/cyber-criminals-russia-ukraine-gameover-zeus/; Tom Brewster. ‘Trouble with Russia, Trouble with the Law:\nInside Europe’s Digital Crime Unit’ The Guardian, April 15, 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/15/eu­\nropean-cyber-crime-unit-russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, the known cyber operations appear contrary to the letter and spirit of the\nCode of Conduct as most of the incidents can be seen as part of the larger infor­\nmation war.

This appears to go against what one could\nexpect to see in a modern military conflict. Is this a sign that the norm of not using\ncyber to harm CI – as also recently advocated by the UN GGE – is likely to be glob­\nally accepted and followed in the future?

Numerous countries in the region\nfeel that their national security is directly threatened, especially those bordering Rus­\nsia. New NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland are seeking concrete\nforms of reassurance from Washington and Brussels, while non-members like Swe­\nden and Finland have reinforced their ties with the NATO Alliance. The Nordic and\nBaltic countries have sought a closer partnership during the Ukraine war, and this has\ncreated an opportunity to advance their regional cyber security dialogue.\n\nReceived wisdom states that small countries, especially those located next to a\nbig country, are most at risk when international security breaks down, and that big\nstates do what they want while small states do what they must. During the war in\nUkraine, northern European countries have been forced to re-evaluate their rela­\ntionship with NATO as well as their preparedness against Russia’s ‘hybrid warfare’\nwhich blends conventional and unconventional operations, regular and irregular\ntactics, information warfare, and cyber warfare. Cyber threats in particular have\nbeen an integral part of these ongoing discussions, as northern European countries\nhave been subjected to various forms of cyber attack during the Ukraine war.\n\nThis chapter concentrates on two of Russia’s neighbours that have always been\nin the ‘realist’ camp in term of their national security policy: Finland and Esto­\n\n\n-----\n\nnia. The response of each nation to the Ukraine crisis has been different, reflecting\ntheir traditional approaches to foreign and security policy as well as their existing\nties to NATO. Yet these two nations have much in common: a fundamental inter­\nest in regional stability, Western unity, a norms-based view of international order,\ninterdependence, and an essential need for cooperation in the field of foreign and\nsecurity policy. These same principles drive both nations’ prevailing views on both\ninformation security and cyber security – two issues which are sometimes distinct,\nand sometimes closely related.\n\n##### 2 Finland: Coming to Terms with Hybrid Warfare\n\n‘Is Finland really getting ready for war with Russia?’ An American news channel\nposed this question in May 2015, when nearly a million Finnish military reservists\nreceived letters detailing their assigned duties in a crisis situation.[1] In fact, the cor­\nrespondence was unrelated to Russia’s annexation of Crimea or its ongoing war in\nUkraine, but the media attention that this event generated speaks volumes about the\nage-old nature of the Russo-Finnish relationship.\n\nHistorically, Finland´s national security strategy has almost exclusively been\nfocused on Russia, and Finns have been following the war in Ukraine extremely\nclosely. From the beginning, Finland has condemned Russia´s activities in its largest\nEuropean neighbour. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö summarised the current situ­\nation well: ‘We have a long history with Russia — not that peaceful all the time. So\neverything the Russians are doing, surely the Finns notice and think very carefully\nabout what that might mean’.[2] Defence Minister Carl Haglund was more direct in\nhis choice of words: ‘Russia says one thing but does another. I do not trust Russia\nat all’.[3]\n\nThe concept of ‘cyber’ is rather new in the Finnish language.[4] It was institution­\nalised in 2013, when Finland published its National Cyber Security Strategy, which\ndescribed cyber security as ‘the desired end state in which the cyber domain is reli­\nable and in which its functioning is ensured’.[5] Public discussion of the importance\nof cyber security is a natural outgrowth of Finland being one of the most advanced\ninformation societies in the world, a country that relies heavily on the proper func­\ntioning of myriad electronic networks and services. For years, there has been an\nactive societal debate in Finland on topics such as public-private partnerships in\ncyberspace, the need for better legislation, the development of cyber defence capa­\nbilities within the Finnish Defence Forces, and much more.\n\n1 Holly Ellyatt. ‘Is Finland really getting ready for war with Russia?’CNBC, May 25, 2015.\n2 Griff Witte. ‘Finland feeling vulnerable amid Russian provocations,’ The Washington Post, November 23, 2014, 6.\n3 Gerard O’Dwyer. ‘Finland Brushes Off Russian Overtunes,’ DefenseNews, February 15, 2015, http://www.defensenews.com/\nstory/defense/international/2015/02/15/finland-russia-border-relationship/23301883/.\n4 Jarno Limnéll. ‘Kyber rantautui Suomeen,’ Aalto University Publication Series 12/2014, Helsinki 2014.

Finnish analysts have noticed Russian cyber espi­\nonage in Ukraine, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against Ukraine,\nand the disruption by pro-Russian hackers\nof Ukrainian media and telecommunica­ _It has not been necessary_\ntions networks.[6] However, most Finnish _for Russia to use its more_\ncyber experts have been surprised that _strategic cyber capabilities._\ncyber attacks have not played a greater role\nin the conflict, and frankly, we expected to see more. According to our analysis, the\nprimary reason for this is likely that Ukraine is simply not a very cyber-dependent\ncountry; therefore, Russia could better fulfil its national security agenda by other\nmeans, as cyber attacks may not have the desired effect. As a consequence, it has not\nbeen necessary for Russia to use its more strategic cyber capabilities.\n\nIn Finland, one change has been a deeper appreciation of the seriousness of\ncyber espionage, and this is partly due to Russia´s cyber activity in Ukraine. For the\nfirst time, Finland has accused Russia of carrying out intelligence activities – both\nphysical and cyber – within its territory. In the past, Finnish Security Police reports\nhad only vaguely mentioned that some ‘foreign countries’ had engaged in espionage\nagainst Finland.\n\nCyber threats from Russia have been viewed in Finland primarily in the con­\ntext of ‘hybrid’ warfare, which is understood in Finland to be a more intelligent\nor efficient way to wage war because it seeks to achieve political goals without the\nextensive use of traditional violence. Using a range of tools such as cyber attacks,\neconomic pressure, information operations, and limited physical attacks to gener­\nate uncertainty in the mind of the general population, an aggressor may be able to\nachieve its desired political goals.\n\nIn Finland, it is understood that modern Russian warfare puts great emphasis\non cyber and electronic warfare. In particular, Russian activities in Ukraine have\nspurred Finland to strengthen its military and societal defences. The new Finn­\nish Government programme puts it this way: ‘The Government will strengthen\nthe comprehensive concept of security nationally, in the EU and in international\ncooperation. This applies, in particular, to new and large-scale threats, such as the\ndefence against hybrid attacks, cyber attacks and terrorism’.[7]\n\nFrom a Nordic perspective, one of the most alarming aspects of the Ukraine\ncrisis has been Russian attempts to wage information warfare to influence public\nopinion. Finnish media – and even ordinary Finns – have discussed this dynamic in\ndetail. Even the Finnish Prime Minister has openly stated that there is an ongoing\n\n6 Jarno Limnéll. ‘Ukraine crisis proves cyber conflict is a reality of modern warfare,’ The Telegraph, April 19, 2014, http://www.\ntelegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/10770275/Ukraine-crisis-proves-cyber-conflict-is-a-reality-of-modern-war­\nfare.html.\n7 Prime Minister´s Office, Strategic Programme of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä’s Government, Government Publications 12/2015,\nMay 29, 2015, 38.\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation war in Ukraine.

For example, it is difficult to prepare\ncountermeasures for an attack that is outsourced to hacker groups that lie outside\nnormal state structures. In Ukraine, these are theoretically separatist groups in\nCrimea and eastern Ukraine. Cyberspace is the ideal place to wage anonymous – or\nat least plausibly deniable – operations.\n\nFor Finnish defence planning, the increased use of hybrid warfare does not mean\nforgetting more traditional military threats to our nation, but it does complicate\nmatters – especially societal preparedness. Cyber attacks are now an integral part\nof all conflicts and wars, and they are blurring the line between peace and war. As\nFinland´s President Niinistö stated:\n\n_‘With hybrid warfare, we are facing a substantial change in military_\n_operations. The boundary between actual war and other exercise of_\n_power is becoming blurred. Means of cyber war and information war are_\n_becoming increasingly important.

Today, Estonia is considered to be a world leader in all\nthings digital, including cyber security.[10] Estonia’s current Cyber Strategy notes that\nthe environment is growing more dangerous: ‘The amount and activeness of states\ncapable of cyber-attacks are increasing’.[11]\n\nEstonia has been subjected to pressure from Moscow for years, but Russian\ncyber espionage in Estonia’s government and commercial affairs is also getting\nworse. Therefore, when tensions began to rise in Ukraine, Estonia was one of the\nfirst nations to sound the alarm. In late 2014, Estonia´s Prime Minister Taavi Rõi­\nvas declared that ‘[w]e, in Estonia, fully understand that challenges may arise from\nother directions, including in the cyber domain’.[12]\n\nRussian´s annexation of Crimea has raised fears in the Baltic states that they\ncould be the next victims of Russian aggression. In all three countries, there are\nmany people alive today who personally witnessed Russian tactics similar to those\nnow on display in Ukraine. Both Latvia and Estonia have large Russian-speaking\nminorities living within their borders.\n\nEstonia is different from Finland in one key regard – its NATO membership.\nEstonia´s President Toomas Hendrik Ilves is an active figure in NATO security\nand policy circles, particularly those that relate to cyber: ‘Shutting down a country\nwith a cyberattack would be very difficult but not impossible. If you did that, why\nwouldn’t that be a case for Article 5 action?’ Article 5 of the NATO Charter states\nthat any attack on one member of the Alliance can be viewed as an attack on all. At\nthe NATO Wales Summit in 2014, in part due to Ilves´s tireless work, NATO minis­\nters ratified a policy stating that not only conventional and nuclear attacks, but also\ncyber attacks, may lead to an invocation of Article 5.[13,14]\n\nIn the past, a NATO ally under cyber attack could convene a group to consult on\nthe attack, but not call on allies to respond in any way. With cyber attacks now falling\nunder Article 5, NATO members now have the option of doing so. This is a major\nshift in policy, given that cyber warfare is still largely shrouded in mystery and secrecy.\nNational cyber capabilities tend to be highly classified. Therefore, despite differing\ncapabilities, viewpoints, and thresholds (after all, what Estonia might consider to be\nan intolerable assault on its sovereignty might not be seen the same way in Brussels or\nWashington) this was a significant event in that a public announcement that NATO\nmight respond to a cyber attack as it would to a kinetic or traditional attack has tangi­\nble value in the realm of international military deterrence.\n\nDuring the conflict in Ukraine, DDoS attacks against Estonia have been sur­\nprisingly few. In fact, despite expectations, the past year has been unusually calm\n\n10 According to the global cyber security index of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Estonia is ranked fifth in\nthe world in the field, and according to the recently published Business Software Alliance (BSA) report, Estonia, Austria and\nNetherlands are the most cyber-secure countries in Europe.\n11 Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Cyber Security Strategy 2014-2017, 2014, 5.\n12 Ashish Kumar Sen. ‘Estonia´s Prime Minister: NATO Presence Key to Counter Russia´s Provocations,’ Atlantic Council, De­\ncember 11, 2014.\n13 NATO, ‘Wales Summit Declaration,’ September 5, 2014. http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm.\n14 E.g. Roger Boyes. ‘NATO must respond to Russian cyber assault,’ The Times, April 3, 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\ncompared to the previous year.[15] In 2013, the level was much higher: for example,\nthe websites of the Ministry of Defence and the Estonian Defence Forces were both\nhit by DDoS, for which responsibility was claimed by ‘Anonymous Ukraine’.[16] Also\nin 2013, the website of Estonian railway company Elron (which happens to be the\nmost popular Google search term in Estonia) was defaced with messages claiming\nthat passenger train traffic had been halted as a result of a NATO military exercise.[17]\nEarlier the same day, the website of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre\nof Excellence (NATO CCD COE) came under DDoS attack (Anonymous Ukraine\nagain claimed responsibility). At NATO Headquarters in Belgium, several websites\nhave been targeted during the Ukraine war, as well as NATO’s unclassified e-mail\nsystem. NATO officials have described these attacks as serious assaults, but also said\nthat they did not pose any risk to NATO´s classified networks.[18]\n\nThe hacker group ‘Cyber Berkut’ said the attacks were carried out by patriotic\nUkrainians angry over NATO interference in their country, and also stated that\nNATO CCD COE experts had been in Ukraine training ‘cyber terrorists’. Although\nattribution of cyber attacks to specific actors and nations is difficult, technical anal­\nysis of the Cyber Berkut’s domains as well as the nature of its propaganda strongly\nsuggest ties to Russia.[19]\n\nSince the beginning of 2014, however, Estonian cyberspace has been unusually\ncalm. Like Finland, Estonia has seen espionage, pro-Russia trolling on Estonian\nweb forums, and propaganda, but little in the way of malware or computer exploits.\nEstonians feel that the ‘hostile information flow’ from Russia is aimed at creating\nand widening rifts between native Estonians and ethnic Russians (Moscow does\nnot see normal relations as beneficial to its current foreign policy). For example,\non 4 March 2015, the television channel Rossiya-1 (a key source of information for\nmany ethnic Russians in the Baltic region) aired a satirical anti-Nazi video that was\nsaid to be ‘proof’ of Estonia’s support for Nazism.[20] In response, Estonia will cre­\nate its own Russian-language TV channel, to be launched in September 2015 by a\nstate-financed public broadcaster, that will seek to empower the local ethnic Russian\nidentity.[21]\n\nA NATO member only since 2004, Estonia today occupies a highly visible\nposition within the Alliance. Thus, the hybrid military campaign that Russia has\nlaunched in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine almost forces NATO to take proactive\nsteps to guard against the use of such tactics in the Baltic states, if not to rethink\nsome of its defence strategies altogether. As Estonia´s Defence Minister Sven Mik­\nser stated, ‘We have reason to believe that Russia views the Baltic region as one\n\n15 Private conversations with Estonian officials.\n16 CERT-EE kokkuvõte, ‘Hajusad ummistusründed, võltsitud saatjaga e-kirjad ning näotustamised 1.-7.

For its part, Estonia is already sharing its cyber\nsecurity experience and expertise with Ukraine, including the organisation of large\ncyber security drills. And finally, Estonia has one major advantage on its side: it is\nhome to the NATO CCD COE, whose symbolic importance to Estonia has grown\nrapidly.\n\n##### 4 Conclusion: David vs. Goliath in Cyberspace\n\nFinland and Estonia both rank among the world’s most connected and cyber secu­\nrity-savvy countries.[23] In both nations, there is a high degree of dependence on the\ninternet, as well as a deep appreciation for the strategic nature of modern networks\nand the need to secure them. Therefore, both Finland and Estonia are at the fore­\nfront of the nations creating cyber norms in the world.[24]\n\nThe need to prepare defences against modern hybrid warfare forces govern­\nments, including those of Finland and Estonia, to take steps sooner rather than\nlater. There will be conflicts in which the regular armed forces of a foreign state are\nnot the most active participants. Some of the attacks may occur entirely in cyber­\nspace, and the attackers might even remain anonymous. In the internet era, a wide\nrange of national laws must be re-examined and contingencies rehearsed, so that\ndecision-makers have the best possible tools to respond to the challenges of hybrid\nwarfare in the future.\n\nRussia is far larger and more populous than both Finland and Estonia, but tra­\nditional notions of size – especially in the globalised internet era – is not the only\ndetermining factor on the cyber battlefield. Smaller countries such as Finland and\nEstonia, with a strong heritage of technical capability and experience, may possess\nsome advantages that not even great powers could dream of.

However, times change, and Vladimir Putin,\nnow facing strong sanctions and a weak rouble, could choose to retaliate against the\nWest in the form of ‘little green bytes’. US and European economies may, in fact, be\nnatural targets, carrying the implicit message: if you seriously affect Russia’s finan­\ncial health, you too will feel the pain.\n\n1 [Matthew Devost. ‘Risk of cyber terrorism raised at seminar,’ Massey University News, September 12, 2002, http://www.massey.](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/2002/news_release/13_09_02a.html)\n[ac.nz/~wwpubafs/2002/news_release/13_09_02a.html.](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/2002/news_release/13_09_02a.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nConflict in cyberspace offers adversaries many possibilities and Putin has\nnumerous options. In the near term, there are four obvious scenarios: local instabil­\nity, intimidation, frozen cyber conflict, and coercion.\n\nThe first option, local instability, would exclusively target Ukraine, causing cyber\ndisruption in the hope of keeping the country prostrate while trying to avoid escala­\ntion with the West and a tightening of sanctions. In the second option, intimidation,\nPutin would use cyber capabilities against the West to mirror his existing recipe\nof strategic threats, military exercises, submarine deployments, nuclear threats and\nnuclear-capable bomber flights. A further escalation here could be a third option\n– a frozen cyber conflict, where techniques of hybrid warfare are used to try for\nmedium-term disruption to the internet itself. The fourth option, coercion, would\ngo beyond local disruption and provocations and would attempt to use cyber force\nto disrupt Western economic and military targets. This last scenario is the most\ndangerous of all, potentially signifying a calculation by Putin that Russia has little\nremaining stake in the global economic game. In that case, why not upend the table\nand ruin the party for everyone?\n\n##### 2 Local Instability: Frozen Conflict with a Topping of Cyber\n\nIn the least aggressive scenario, Putin would escalate only within Ukraine in an\nattempt to further destabilise and delegitimise the existing government. The ‘little\ngreen bytes’ might deny service to Ukrainian government and media sites, or even\ntarget critical infrastructure. As in other post-Soviet frozen conflicts, the goal is not\nnecessarily to prevail, but rather to keep Ukraine destabilised for years and unable\nto pose any challenge.\n\nAs noted elsewhere in this book, the Russians, due to their legacy from the Mos­\ncow-dominated Soviet Union, have an extensive knowledge of Ukrainian systems.\nMost of Ukraine’s infrastructure is well understood – if not designed by – Russian\nenterprises, so exploiting them for cyber attack would be far easier than for a typical\ncyber campaign elsewhere. There may also be a sufficient number of insiders who\nare friendly to Russia, and who could either be bribed or blackmailed into leak­\ning sensitive government materials, disseminating propaganda, installing malicious\nsoftware, or even physically destroying key systems.\n\nRussia has shown some of its digital arsenal. Cyber espionage campaigns such\nas ‘Sandworm’ have played a role in intelligence collection operations against the\nUkrainian government and some NATO nations, even taking advantage of multiple\nzero-day exploits.[2]\n\nThe local instability cyber option could allow Putin to maintain pressure on\nUkraine while avoiding an increase in tensions with the West. He might even be\n\n2 ‘iSIGHT discovers zero-day vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 used in Russian cyber-espionage campaign,’ _iSight, October 14,_\n[2014, http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/10/cve-2014-4114/.](http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/10/cve-2014-4114/)\n\n\n-----\n\nable to accomplish this while claiming to be de-escalating the conflict. Russia, in this\nscenario, would only launch disruptive cyber attacks _within Ukraine, not against_\nother targets in the West, and attempting to limit the upper bound of escalation. The\ninternational community might be happy, however, to countenance a ‘cyber war’\nin Ukraine if it caused little tangible damage to other countries, limited the body\ncount, and generated fewer disturbing media images.\n\n##### 3 Intimidation: Cyber Provocations and Escalation\n\nA second option for Putin is to send a digital warning shot across the West’s cyber bow,\nin effect saying that Russia has additional cards up its sleeve and may play them if nec­\nessary. Russia is already escalating all sorts of military operations against the West, from\nmassive exercises and military flights to nuclear threats. ‘Little green bytes’ could there­\nfore be just one additional form of provocation to add instability on the world stage.\n\nSuch attacks would be just-deniable-enough and might target defence and mili­\ntary systems and networks. Russia could target allies with weaker defences, or gov­\nernments which Putin might calculate as being easier political prey, and more sus­\nceptible to Russian coercion.\n\nThis cyber escalation would simply be a natural extension of Putin’s provoca­\ntive behaviour in other military forces. In the last fifteen months, Russia has appar­\nently sneaked submarines into Swedish and Finnish territorial waters, stating that\nFinland’s growing ties with NATO were a ‘special concern’;[3] flown jet fighters and\nnuclear-capable bombers along the periphery of Europe; and buzzed NATO ships\nincluding the US guided-missile destroyer USS Ross as it sailed in international\nwaters off the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula.[4]\n\nApart from drilling his conventional forces, Putin in the spring of 2014 organ­\nised large-scale exercises designed to assess the preparedness level of his nuclear\nforces.[5] In the context of Russia’s nuclear threats against Denmark, these appear\nto be calculated (if clumsy) efforts to\nintimidate the West.[6] _Estonia in 2007 was a blueprint_\n\nThe Russian cyber assault on\n\n##### for a geopolitically inspired and\n\nEstonia in 2007 was a blueprint for a\ngeopolitically inspired and just-deni­ _just-deniable-enough digital_\nable-enough digital disruption.

In fact, it seems an escalation in such intrusions is\nalready underway.\n\nRussian state-sponsored hackers are believed to have recently compromised the\nUS Department of State, then used that access to penetrate the unclassified network\nof the Executive Office of the President.[8,9] Unlike during previous intrusions linked\nto Russia, on this occasion the digital spies did not back out of the system once they\nwere discovered, but fought back in order to maintain their foothold in the net­\nwork.[10] Investigators also believe that Russian spies were behind the recent intrusion\ninto the unclassified email of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, an intrusion which forced the\nPentagon to take the system down for several days.[11]\n\n##### 4 Freezing the Conflict in Cyberspace\n\nRather than, or in addition to, using cyber to help destabilise the Ukraine, Putin\nmight try to make the internet itself a new zone of frozen conflict. This option is\nperhaps not as likely as the others, but might offer Putin an intriguing possibility:\ninflict on the internet, which delivers ‘harmful’ content in the form of unwanted\ntruths to Russian citizens, just enough long-term disruption so that it is less useful,\nless trusted, and less an enabler to Western economies and societies.\n\nIn this option, Putin’s forces would use cyber capabilities to periodically disrupt\ncore internet infrastructure such as the domain name system, or frequently take\ndown Western information providers. Each new week could see a large-scale deni­\nal-of-service attack.\n\nThis option differs from the previous ‘intimidation’ option in two ways. First,\nthe attacks would be far more disruptive than mere shows of force.

The goal\nis therefore not to get them to back down, but hopefully to destabilise the internet\njust enough to deny cyber benefits to his perceived enemies.\n\n##### 5 Coercion: Escalate to De-escalate\n\nThe most aggressive option for Putin _What if, Sony-style, one bank a_\nis to use cyber capabilities to disrupt\n\n##### week were targeted for a disrup­\n\nthe economies of the West. Imagine\na massive, long-term and continuing _tive and embarrassing attack?_\nattack against the West’s financial sys­\ntem or power grids. What if, Sony-style, one bank a week were to be targeted for a\ndisruptive and embarrassing attack?\n\nRussia in the past had, along with at least the United States and China, the capa­\nbility to conduct such attacks, but lacked the intent. Russia had disagreements with\nthe West but was not engaged in any real conflict. Further, to some extent, Russia\nneeded healthy Western economies to itself thrive.\n\nThat situation has changed. Today, Putin may well see himself in a conflict with\nthe West, perhaps even a shooting war, and feel the very survival of his regime\ncould be at stake. In 2013, sanctions including asset freezes and export prohibi­\ntions pushed Russia to the brink of a recession, and the economy grew by only\n1.3%.[12] By the end of 2015, the World Bank predicts that ongoing sanctions cou­\npled with the decrease in oil prices will shrink the Russian economy by 3.8%.[13]\nPutin could calculate that Russia has few remaining stakes in the global economy\nand financial system.\n\nWithout international economic entanglement, it is far easier for Putin to use\nRussia’s impressive cyber capabilities to try to directly coerce (rather than threaten)\nthe West. By inflicting economic turmoil, he could turn Russia’s lack of a stake in the\nglobal financial system from a liability into an asset. With nothing to lose and every­\nthing to gain, Putin might calculate that unleashing his just-deniable-enough ‘little\ngreen bytes’ against Western economies could be a win-win situation for Russia.\n\nRussia is already pushing the idea that they may need to ‘escalate to de-escalate’\na brewing conflict with the West. In an extensive article in Vox, Max Fisher lays out\nthe evidence that the world is ever closer to conflict, even a world war, and especially\nthat Putin ‘has enshrined, in Russia’s official nuclear doctrine, a dangerous idea no\nSoviet leader ever adopted: that a nuclear war could be winnable’.[14]\n\n12 [‘How far do EU-US sanctions on Russia go?’ BBC, September 15, 2014, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28400218](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28400218)\n13 Andrey Ostroukh. ‘Russia’s Economic Outlook Worse Than Thought, World Bank Says,’ The Wall Street Journal, April 1, 2015,\n[http://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-economic-outlook-worse-than-thought-world-bank-says-1427883522.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-economic-outlook-worse-than-thought-world-bank-says-1427883522)\n14 Max Fisher. ‘How World War III Became Possible,’ Vox, June 29, 2015, http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn that light, cyber weapons may offer an even more attractive opportunity given\nthat cyber effects can be temporary and reversible. Russian Deputy Prime Minister\nDmitry Rogozin has already declared that Russian tanks ‘don’t need visas’ to cross\ninternational borders.[15] If Russia is willing to make nuclear threats and roll T-72s across\nborders, then how much more likely are attacks using faster, more deniable, electrons?\n\nOne obvious target would be Western financial firms that currently enforce the\nsanctions against Russia. Many analysts believe that Iran chose precisely this form\nof retaliation in 2012, in response to Stuxnet.[16] Other obvious targets could be the\noil, gas, or electricity sectors, in order to raise the price of oil.\n\nDuring our research for this chapter, several security analysts stated that Russia\nmay be preparing for this contingency with its Havex and BlackEnergy cyber cam­\npaigns.[17] In both cases, Russian government hackers apparently targeted Western\nenergy companies, not for espionage, but in order to prepare for a potential fol­\nlow-on disruptive attack. It appears Russia has proved that it has the required capa­\nbilities already in place to disrupt Western energy systems, now it is just a matter of\nhaving the intent.\n\nOr Putin could focus his cyber attack not against sectors, but against specific\nWestern allies; those he felt would be most likely to submit to coercive pressure. His\nwhispered promise might be something along the lines of ‘Drop your support for\nsanctions and all these cyber failures you’re experiencing can just go away.’ Coun­\ntries which might not have been fully committed to the sanctions in the first place\nmight not need much convincing.\n\n##### 6 Conclusion\n\nCyberspace – and cyber attacks – offer many ways, especially for a capable nationstate, to target an adversary. In the current conflict, the most likely near-term options\nfor Russia are perhaps local instability, intimidation and coercion. Of course, the\nscenarios discussed in this chapter are not mutually exclusive; Putin could jump\nbetween them or even employ them all simultaneously.\n\nFortunately to help analyse Russia’s cyber current actions, it may be enough to\nanalyse his actions in the physical world: Russian hostility in Europe is likely to be\nmatched with Russian hostility online. If this process starts to get out of control,\nthen Western leaders have to be at their highest level of concern.\n\nIf Putin believes he is approaching a use-it-or-lose-it situation for his autocratic\nregime and its stolen billions, he may just decide to take the internet down with him.\n\n15 [‘Russian Official: ‘Tanks Don’t Need Visas’, Defense One/Agence France-Presse, May 25, 2015, http://www.defensenews.com/](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/international/europe/2015/05/25/russian-official-tanks-need-visas/27924351/)\n[story/defense/international/europe/2015/05/25/russian-official-tanks-need-visas/27924351/.](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/international/europe/2015/05/25/russian-official-tanks-need-visas/27924351/)\n16 [Siobhan Gorman and Julian Barnes. ‘Iran Blamed for Cyberattacks,’ The Wall Street Journal, October 12, 2012, http://www.wsj.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444657804578052931555576700)\n[com/articles/SB10000872396390444657804578052931555576700.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444657804578052931555576700)\n17 Blake Sobczak and Peter Behr. ‘Secret meetings tackle back-to-back energy-sector cyberthreats,’ EnergyWire, October 31, 2014,\n[http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060008193.](http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060008193)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 18\n\n Strategic Defence\n in Cyberspace:\n Beyond Tools and Tactics\n\n##### Richard Bejtlich\n\n_The Brookings Institution_\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\nThe digitisation of information, which began during the Second World War, has\nsignificantly deepened the relationship between human beings (from the individ­\nual to the nation-state) and unstructured data, structured information (such as a\ndatabases), and intelligence (information of political or military value). Every part\nof society has benefited from information technology; however, as we have increas­\ningly become data-reliant, our adversaries have sought to leverage information\nagainst us. Attackers and defenders now battle for access to, and control of, infor­\nmation in the political, economic, military, and social spheres. In military parlance,\ndata has become a virtual ‘high ground’ from which the better-informed can influ­\nence an adversary.\n\nThe Ukrainian Government currently finds itself at a tactical disadvantage vis-à-vis\nRussia, both on the traditional field of battle as well as in cyberspace. However, cyber\nsecurity, especially at the national level, is a strategic game, and Kyiv can make smart\ninvestments that will pay off over the long run. In Ukraine, as in every other nationstate, practitioners, academics, policy-makers, and the public are individually and col­\nlectively vexed by the question of how to defend data, information, and intelligence.\nPart of the problem is that adversaries do not have one or even several attack strategies\nat their disposal: they can steal, destroy, deny access to, or even alter information – as\nwell as the systems that store, process, and display it to its ostensible owners.\n\n\n-----\n\nDigitised information is a human product which resides in mechanical devices\nbuilt by engineers and programmers, and so decision-makers naturally turn to the\ntechnical community for answers to these challenges. Technical proposals take\nmany forms. Several frequently appear in policy-making circles: we could scrap the\ninternet entirely and replace it with a ‘more secure’ alternative;[1] we might build\nsoftware that is ‘not hackable,’ possibly through ‘leap ahead’ technologies that make\ndefence easier than offense (which is today manifestly not the case);[2] or we can out­\nsource our security to third-party vendors.[3] These are all technical ideas, but they\nare generally not feasible for a variety of reasons. More fundamentally, it is danger­\nous to rely solely on technology to mitigate core security problems.\n\n##### 2 The Limitations of Technology-driven Approaches\n\nTechnology plays an important role in defending data. Thoughtfully designed\nnetworks, higher quality software, and agile start-ups can frustrate opportunistic\nintruders seeking easy prey. Unfortunately, well-resourced, professional attackers\nsometimes have long-standing missions to compromise specific high-value targets,\nwhether for information theft or data manipulation. They will not give up until their\nmission requirements change or until they succeed in their assignment.\n\nDigital defenders may only get a glimpse of the intruder, and often this comes\nfar too late in the game. Whereas the victim’s perspective is usually narrow and\nincomplete, professional attackers are persistent and know exactly what they are\ntargeting. According to the Mandiant 2015 M-Trends report, the median number of\ndays in 2014 that a successful threat group was present on a victim’s network before\ndetection, was 205. In one case, an adversary had maintained unauthorised access\nfor over 8 years.[4] Even after discovery, organisations can spend months trying to\nremove the intruder. In February 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US\n\n\n##### A technology-centric world­ view obsesses about a static, one-time exchange between attacker and defender.\n\n\nState Department continued to be plagued\nby foreign hackers fully three months\nafter the agency confirmed reports of an\nintrusion.[5]\n\nThis relationship between security\nand time is central to protecting digital\n\n\n1 [Thom Shanker. ‘Cyberwar Chief Calls for Secure Computer Network,’ New York Times, 23 September 2010, http://www.ny­](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/us/24cyber.html)\n[times.com/2010/09/24/us/24cyber.html; John Markoff. ‘Do We Need a New Internet?’](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/us/24cyber.html) _New York Times,_ 14 February 2009,\n[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/weekinreview/15markoff.html.](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/weekinreview/15markoff.html)\n2 Jim Garamone. ‘DARPA Director Discusses Cyber Security Challenges,’ DoD News, 1 October 2014, http://www.defense.gov/\nnews/newsarticle.aspx?id=123307.\n3 Over 400 vendors demonstrated their products and services at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, California in April 2015.\n[RSA Conference 2015 vendors, http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/expo-sponsors.](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/expo-sponsors)\n4 The median number for 2013 was 229 days.

An analysis of time intervals is key to understanding the interaction\nbetween attackers and defenders, but in general the security community does not\nsufficiently understand or appreciate the nature and consequences of this relation­\nship. A technology-centric worldview obsesses about a static, one-time exchange\nbetween attacker and defender. This is not an accurate description of the real world,\nwhich is populated, not with mindless code, but with rational and irrational human\nbeings who are both intelligent and adaptive adversaries and who observe their tar­\ngets, allocate resources, and make dynamic decisions in order to accomplish their\ngoals.[6]\n\nDigital defenders ignore these facts at their peril. The interactive and time-de­\npendent nature of network attack and defence leads to the promotion of suboptimal\napproaches to security. The emphasis on ‘cyber hygiene’ is illustrative.[7] To defeat\nintruders, this method promotes knowing one’s network, removing unauthorised\nsystems, patching vulnerabilities, and improving configurations. All of these are\ncertainly both requisite and commendable defensive steps. However, they are insuf­\nficient when confronting an attacker who has the time and resources to adapt to and\novercome the target’s defences. ‘Washing cyber hands’ is helpful when minimising\nthe spread of mindless germs, but it is less effective when those germs are as smart\nas, or better-resourced and motivated than, the hand-washer.\n\n##### 3 Strategic Thought in Cyber Defence\n\nTo better address the dynamic challenge of continuous interaction between adap­\ntive, intelligent adversaries, this chapter advocates the application of strategic mili­\ntary concepts to conflict in cyberspace. Armed conflict has long been characterised\nas a struggle between persistent adversaries over time. However, the advent of mass\narmies, modern weapons, and nation-state warfare in the late 18th and early 19th\ncenturies took this concept to a higher level. During the 20th century, military strat­\negists therefore had to think beyond the traditional dichotomy of strategy versus\ntactics. Over time, they codified multiple ‘levels of warfare’.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, U.S. Army doctrine described three levels of war: strate­\ngic, operational, and tactical.[8] These built on previous writings and lessons learned,\nfrom Napoleonic battles to Soviet military planning. National goals and policy – sit­\nting above the strategic level of war – were incorporated into doctrine, although this\ncan be confusing given that the word ‘strategic’ often appeared in both the model’s\nname and one of its primary elements.\n\n6 John R.

Certainly in physical warfare one uses ‘tools’ to inflict kinetic dam­\n\nage. In the digital world, the model explicitly\n\n##### Too many digital secu­ introduces tools in order to show practitioners rity professionals believe where they fit in strategic thinking. Too many\n\ndigital security professionals believe tools are\n\n##### tools are the sole focus\n\nthe sole focus of defensive action. By placing\n\n##### of defensive action. tools at the bottom of the model, they appear,\n\nin the author’s opinion, in their proper place.\nFurthermore, in this model, the term ‘campaign’ is included at the operational level.\n‘Campaigns’ and ‘operations’ are sometimes interchanged, so both appear to reduce\nconfusion.\n\nThese five levels are depicted in Figure 1‑1. Policies and goals are broad state­\nments by organisational leadership that describe the desired purpose of the stra­\ntegic programme. Strategies are concepts for employing organisational resources\nto accomplish the stated policies and goals. Operations (which in this schema are\norganised into campaigns) are sets of activities designed to implement strategies\nthat are pursued over days, weeks, months, or even years. Tactics are actions taken\nwithin individual encounters with an adversary, and serve as the atomic elements\nof a campaign. Tools are the digital equipment with which an actor implements\ntactics.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of these elements must be connected in order to achieve successful outcomes.\nBefore explaining how these five levels can improve digital defence, it is important\nto recognise that I am not advocating the ‘militarisation’ of cyberspace – which is a\nvalid concern of many analysts. For example, in 2013, Jason Healey wrote in Foreign\n_Affairs that the military had ‘prioritised one national security goal – more spying_\nand attack capabilities – above all others’.[9] A _Forbes journalist defined the prob­_\nlem as ‘giv[ing] a military character to’ it, ‘equip[ping] [it] with military forces and\ndefences’ or ‘adapt[ing] [it] for military use’,[10] This author, while generally disagree­\ning with these premises, does not equate strategic thought with militarisation. The\npurpose of this chapter on strategic thought is to familiarise defenders with another\nstrategy to protect information, one suited to the timescales and interactive nature\nof modern computer intrusions.\n\n##### 4 Traditional Security within the Strategic Model\n\nSquaring traditional security concepts with the strategic model contributes to a rich\ndiscussion of digital defence. Typically, network defenders concentrate on tools and\ntactics, which are in turn dominated by the notions of security software, software\nsecurity, and securing software. Security software consists of programs written by\nvendors, open source developers, and individual security teams that are designed\nto detect, frustrate, and remove adversaries. Software security refers to the process\nof writing computer programs that are free from coding, process, and logic flaws,\noptimally using a process such as the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIM­\nM).[11] Securing software is a process to enable the ‘cyber hygiene’ model, whereby\ndefenders take various tactical steps to reduce the likelihood of compromise.\n\nBeyond the security team, one finds multiple layers of management, including\na chief security or information security officer (CSO or CISO), one or more chief\ntechnology or information officers (CTO or CIO), other members of the so-called\n‘C-suite’ including the chief financial or operating officers (CFO, COO), and ulti­\nmately the chief executive officer (CEO) and board of directors. At the nation-state\nlevel, some governments have appointed cyber security coordinators reporting to\nthe head of government. Recent examples include the United States, the United\nKingdom, Germany, Russia, Japan, and France.[12] In China, President Xi Jinping\npersonally leads the country’s top information security group.[13] One would think\n\n9 Jason Healey. ‘How Emperor Alexander Militarized American Cyberspace,’ Foreign Policy, 6 November 2013, http://foreign­\npolicy.com/2013/11/06/how-emperor-alexander-militarized-american-cyberspace/.\n10 Sean Lawson. ‘Is the United States Militarizing Cyberspace?’ Forbes, 2 November 2012, http://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlaw­\nson/2012/11/02/is-the-united-states-militarizing-cyberspace/.\n11 BSIMM, https://www.bsimm.com/.\n12 French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development, ‘France and cyber security,’ http://www.diplomatie.gouv.\nfr/en/french-foreign-policy/defence-security/cyber-security/.\n13 Shannon Tiezzi. ‘Xi Jinping Leads China’s New Internet Security Group,’ The Diplomat, 28 February 2014, http://thediplomat.\ncom/2014/02/xi-jinping-leads-chinas-new-internet-security-group/.\n\n\n-----\n\nthat, with so much focus on cyber and information security at the upper levels of\nmanagement, defence strategies would be clear. However, despite numerous recent\nhigh-profile breaches, security leaders continue to fret that their ‘organisation’s busi­\nness leadership didn’t provide them the support and space they need to secure their\norganisations properly’.[14]\n\nImproving the dynamics of strategic thought according to the proven military\nmodel can help organisations and nation states move beyond a ‘tools and tactics’\nfocused approach. The latter is by far the prevailing paradigm. For example, one\n2014 RSA Conference presentation encouraged attendees to ‘exploit pet projects’\nand ‘capitalise on timely events’ by using the ‘near-death experiences of others to\njustify security spend’.[15] One 2015 article written for security managers stressed\nthe need for more capable software, stating that ‘a CISO must successfully address\nmany challenging elements when procuring a new security technology solution’.[16]\nIn 2014, Symantec’s Senior Vice President for Information Security said that only\n45% of cyber attacks are prevented by anti-virus software, calling it a ‘dead’ tech­\nnology.[17] Writing secure software, while a laudable goal, continues to be difficult,\neven for leading companies like Microsoft. Bill Gates accelerated the programme\nto find a secure development lifecycle in 2002, but the vendor continues to release\npatches for ‘remote code execution’ vulnerabilities in core Microsoft platforms on\na monthly basis. In brief, we need more than tools and tactics to counter digital\nadversaries.\n\nWhen trying to learn how to communicate with higher level managers and\nCISOs, agency leads, and policy-makers are bombarded with advice like the fol­\nlowing:\n\n_‘One of the most strategic skills a security chief can bring is the profi­_\n_ciency in translating security speak into the language of business risks_\n_and financial ROI [return on investment] terms... At the board level, the_\n_ability to show dollar return on security initiatives is critical to ensure_\n_continued executive support on security investments’.[18]_\n\nThe problem with the focus on tools and tactics, and related topics of risk and\nROI is that higher-level management and boards do not feel connected to the true\ndefensive posture of their organisation. Because leaders have not been valued parts\nof the security program development process, they think security is mainly an issue\nto be solved by technical professionals.

The _Christian Science Monitor reported_\nthe following in February 2015:\n\n_‘In a survey commissioned by defence contractor Raytheon of 1,006_\n_chief information officers, chief information security officers, and other_\n_technology executives, 78 percent said their boards had not been briefed_\n_even once on their organisation’s cybersecurity strategy over the past 12_\n_months ... The findings are similar to those reported by Pricewaterhouse­_\n_Coopers in its Global State of Information Security Survey last year in_\n_which fewer that 42 percent of respondents said their board actively par­_\n_ticipates in overall security strategy’.[19]_\n\n\nIn light of these challenges, this chapter\nadvocates making boards and higher-level\nmanagers integral aspects of the security\nprocess, by way of strategic thought.\n\n\n##### This chapter advocates mak­ ing boards and higher-level managers integral aspects of the security process.\n\n\n##### 5 Cyber Security without Strategy\n\nThe following scenario will help the reader understand how the application of stra­\ntegic cyber security principles can better protect digital assets. A private organisa­\ntion suffers targeted attacks by both criminal and nation-state threat groups, which\nnot only compromise the organisation but also steal intellectual property including\ntrade secrets, sensitive commercial data, and other digital resources.\n\nThe traditional ‘tools-and-tactics’ security model is characterised by suboptimal\ncommunication and poor alignment between the management, board, and security\nteam. The latter, led by the CISO, is determined to counter the adversary. Their first\ninstinct will be to take some concrete action: to hire new personnel, to develop a\nnew capability, to adopt a new tactic, or to purchase a new software tool. Next, they\nwill attempt to translate their plan into ‘business speak’, and the CISO will develop\nan argument based on an ROI estimate that includes the cost of the initiative, the\namount of money it should save (if all goes well), and a mathematical calculation of\nthe overall risk to the enterprise.\n\nIf asked by the CEO or board to explain his or her rationale, the CISO will reply\nthat a tools-and-tactics approach will save the enterprise money and reduce its level\nof risk. Finally, the management will give the proposal a green light, or send the\nCISO back to the drawing board.\n\n19 Jaikumar Vijayan. ‘After high-profile hacks, many companies still nonchalant about cybersecurity,’ _Christian Science Mon­_\n_itor,_ 19 February 2015, http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2015/0219/After-high-profile-hacks-many-compa­\nnies-still-nonchalant-about-cybersecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis budget request cycle is repeated ad nauseam, until management gets wise to\nthe fact that network security ROI seems to have an Alice-in-Wonderland quality\nabout it: the more money they spend, the more money they are supposed to save.\nEventually, management realises that security is a lot more about loss prevention\nthan revenue generation, and they begin to feel disconnected (and disaffected) from\nthe defence of their digital resources. Further, they recognise that their organisation\nis one of many whose boards are not briefed on real strategy, and who have in fact\nnever participated in serious strategy formulation.\n\n##### 6 Strategic Cyber Security\n\nA strategic cyber security programme, by contrast, does not begin with tools and\ntactics, but with an articulation of one or more programme goals. First, the strate­\ngy-minded CISO gets executive buy-in to those goals. To that end, the CISO must\nincorporate all levels of strategic thought, starting with the board and CEO – every­\none must feel ownership and participation. The smart CISO recognises that security\nis a journey, not a destination, and that relationship building requires an ability to\ntranslate between technical and non-technical vocabularies.\n\nThe CISO ensures that the programme goals accurately govern the objectives of\nthe enterprise’s digital security programme. In our scenario, the CISO, board, and\nCEO all agree that, with respect to intellectual property, trade secrets, and sensitive\ndata, the new policy goal is to minimise loss due to intrusion. This statement implies\nthat everyone understands that stopping all adversaries and all attacks is simply\nnot possible, especially when dealing with nation-state actors and some advanced\ncriminal groups.\n\nThe primary objective of this exercise is to achieve consensus on a simply stated,\nnon-technical programme goal. No in-depth technical discussion is needed to\n\nachieve consensus, although the CISO\n\n##### The primary objective is must ensure that all goals, policies, and\n\nstrategies are technically feasible. With\n\n##### to achieve consensus on a\n\na mandate in hand, the CISO can confi­\n\n##### simply stated, non-technical dently work with his or her security team programme goal. to plan the necessary operations and cam­\n\npaigns and, if necessary, acquire new tools\nand tactics to facilitate them. Together, they decide to implement a network security\nmonitoring (NSM) operation, defined as the collection and escalation of indications\nand warnings to detect and respond to intruders.[20] The security team begins the\nlong-term, strategic process of hunting for hostile cyber attack campaigns, encom­\npassing both known and unknown intrusion patterns.\n\n20 Richard Bejtlich. The Practice of Network Security Monitoring (San Francisco, CA: No Starch 2013).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CISO, board, and CEO all agree that a second programme goal is the rapid\ndetection, response, and containment of cyber threats. This goal helps to ensure that\nwhen intruders breach the perimeter defences, the game is far from over. Defenders\ncan still win, so long as they contain the threat before the attacker can accomplish his\nor her ultimate mission. Therefore, the security team will develop strategies to identify\ncompromises quickly, determine their nature, give them some level of attribution, and\nabove all develop a plan to stop the attacker from accomplishing his or her mission.\n\nAt the tactical level of individual engagements with the adversary – the equiva­\nlent of battles in war – the security team will have myriad decisions to make, includ­\ning whether to dislodge the intruder immediately or whether to watch the intruder\nfor a time in order to collect valuable intelligence. Some tactics govern how specific\ntools or techniques can be used, such as when Star Trek personnel switch their hand\nphasers between ‘stun’ and ‘kill’. As always, the adversary gets a say in what happens,\nbut from the enterprise’s point of view, programme goals, policies, and guidelines\nshould be written to govern this entire process.\n\n##### 7 The Relevance of Campaigns\n\nCentral to the concept, and success, of a strategic security program is the campaign,\nwhich functions at the operational level. In some sense, the maturity of a security\nprogramme can be derived from the attention shown by the CISO and his or her\nsecurity team to campaign development, and the understanding of campaign prog­\nress and analysis by top management. Consider the following quote from a Febru­\nary 2015 Reuters report on defence contractor Lockheed Martin:\n\n_‘[Chief Executive Officer Marillyn] Hewson told the company’s annual_\n_media day that Lockheed had faced 50 ‘coordinated, sophisticated cam­_\n_paign’ attacks by hackers in 2014 alone, and she expected those threats to_\n_continue growing’.[21]_\n\nWhen Ms. Hewson spoke in terms of campaigns, she showed that her security team\nthinks and works at an advanced level. It is likely that Lockheed also aligns campaigns\nwith specific threat actors and motives. Speaking about specific campaigns and ranking\nthem in terms of sophistication and impact permits a vastly more meaningful discus­\nsion with other executives, the board, and other stakeholders. The CEO should be able\nto speak in detail about the threat actors behind the campaigns, including their means\nand motives, as well as illustrative examples of each campaign and how the security team\ndetected and responded to them. The term ‘campaign’ also matches well with non-tech­\nnology business operations such as marketing campaigns and sales campaigns.\n\n21 Andrea Shalal. ‘Lockheed sees double-digit growth in cyber business,’ _Reuters, 18 February 2015, http://www.reuters.com/_\narticle/2015/02/19/us-lockheed-cybersecurity-idUSKBN0LN03K20150219.\n\n\n-----\n\nContrast this approach with a recent briefing by Japan’s National Institute of\nInformation and Communications Technology, which appeared in the Japan Times:\n\n_‘The number of computer attacks on government and other organisations_\n_detected in Japan doubled in 2014 from the previous year to a record 25.66_\n_billion, a government agency said Tuesday’.[22]_\n\nDiscussing individual attacks has limited value, as discrete incidents include\neverything from a suspicious TCP packet, to an odd computer port, dubious SQL\nquery, or ‘phishy’ email. On the other hand, how can anyone devise a credible pro­\ngramme goal to counter over 25 billion attacks?

The researchers found a ‘direct correlation’ between digital attacks\nand the ongoing war, including an ‘alarming’ blend of cyber espionage, physi­\ncal warfare, and geopolitics.[23] Recent reports by security companies Trend Micro\nand FireEye describe other Russian campaigns, assigned the monikers ‘Operation\nPawn Storm’ and ‘APT28’, respectively.[24] According to FireEye, APT28 appeared\nto target individuals affiliated with European security organisations, including\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Organisation for Secu­\n\n\n22 ‘Cyberattacks detected in Japan doubled to 25.7 billion in 2014,’ Japan Times, 17 February 2015, http://www.japantimes.co.jp/\nnews/2015/02/17/national/crime-legal/cyberattacks-detected-in-japan-doubled-to-25-7-billion-in-2014/.\n23 Looking Glass Security, Operation Armageddon: Cyber Espionage as a Strategic Component of Russian Modern Warfare (Bump­\nas, VA: Looking Glass Security Corporation 2015) https://lgscout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Operation_Armaged­\ndon_FINAL.pdf.\n24 Loucif Kharouni, et al, Operation Pawn Storm: Using Decoys to Evade Detection (Trend Micro Incorporated: Irving, TX 2015)\nhttp://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-pawn-storm.pdf and\nAPT28 https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/apt28.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\nrity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which the Russian Government has long\ncited as existential threats.[25]\n\nSimilarly, Russian non-government groups such as CyberBerkut have been active\nagainst NATO and Ukrainian targets.[26] In March 2014, the group directed Distrib­\nuted Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against NATO’s main website, the CCD COE\nwebsite, and NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly website.[27] In October 2014, on the\neve of parliamentary elections in Ukraine, the website of the country’s Central Elec­\ntion Commission suffered DDoS attacks.[28] The group has apparently also targeted\nUS military contractors working in Ukraine, stealing and publishing documents\nabout the movement of Western military equipment to Ukraine.[29]\n\nNation state security requirements are strategic in nature, and they do not fre­\nquently change. For what is seen to be a valid national security concern, states will\ndevote enormous human and technological resources to achieve their objectives,\nand use a variety of methods and attack vectors. Neither does a state give up after\none or even a hundred unsuccessful tactical engagements. Rather, it will adapt, and\nusually overcome defences eventually. The key factor that sets nation states apart\nfrom individuals and even hacker groups like Anonymous is _persistence, and the_\nability to maintain persistence indefinitely.\n\nActors such as Russia also qualify as highly ‘advanced’. Here is the author’s work­\ning definition, published in 2009:\n\n_‘Advanced means the adversary can operate in the full spectrum of computer_\n_intrusion. They can use the most pedestrian publicly available exploit against_\n_a well-known vulnerability, or they can elevate their game to research new vul­_\n_nerabilities and develop custom exploits, depending on the target’s posture’.[30]_\n\nRecognising that any nation-state – in this case Russia – has the capability to\nadapt and overcome is one reason why threat attribution is so important, at all levels\nof strategic thought.[31] This means that any time the security team recognises a failed\nintrusion attempt as coming from an advanced persistent threat actor, they can be\nsure the foe will return with a new technique and perhaps even a new campaign.\n\n25 _Ibid._\n26 ‘Berkut’ is Ukrainian for ‘special police force,’ although CyberBerkut is a pro-Russian group.\n27 ‘Ukrainian CyberBerkut takes down NATO websites,’ _RT,_ 16 March 2014, http://www.rt.com/news/nato-websites-ddosukraine-146/.\n28 Vitaly Shevchenko. ‘Ukraine conflict: Hackers take sides in virtual war,’ BBC News, 20 December 2014, http://www.bbc.com/\nnews/world-europe-30453069.\n29 Jack Smith IV, ‘Pro-Russian Hackers Expose U.S. Military Contractor Activity in Ukraine,’ Observer, 2 March 2015, http://\nobserver.com/2015/03/pro-russian-hackers-expose-u-s-military-contractor-activity-in-ukraine/.\n30 Richard Bejtlich. ‘What APT Is’, Information Security Magazine, July 2010, http://www.academia.edu/6842130/What_APT_Is.\n31 Richard Bejtlich. ‘Five Reasons Attribution Matters,’ _TaoSecurity Blog,_ 30 December 2014, http://taosecurity.blogspot.\ncom/2014/12/five-reasons-attribution-matters.html.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 9 Conclusion\n\nThe Ukrainian Government currently finds itself at a tactical disadvantage vis-à-vis\nRussia, both on the traditional field of battle and in cyberspace. However, cyber\nsecurity, especially at the national level, is a strategic game, and Kyiv can make smart\n\ninvestments that will pay off over the long run.\n\n##### Cyber security, especially This chapter has argued for the need to\n\napply strategic thought to digital defence.\n\n##### at the national level, is a\n\nIt began by advocating the utility of a mili­\n\n##### strategic game. tary model in cyberspace, albeit without any\n\ndesire for the militarisation of cyberspace.\nThe author explained how the military mind set, based on conflict with dynamic,\nadaptive adversaries, is a more reliable strategy than the popular ‘cyber hygiene’\nmodel. It then described the five levels of strategic thought, which link goals with\npolicy, strategy, campaigns and operations, tactics, and tools. The author applied\neach level of strategic thought to a hypothetical network defence scenario. By inte­\ngrating strategic thought into digital defence, this chapter demonstrated an alterna­\ntive to technology-centric approaches that are not sufficient to defeat the adversary.\n\nIn a time of war, Ukraine is a natural target for many cyber threat actors and\ncampaigns. The only way to counter them is to develop an equally determined\ndefensive posture in cyber space.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Authors\n\n**Richard Bejtlich is FireEye’s Chief Security Strategist; previously, he was Mandi­**\nant’s Chief Security Officer.
