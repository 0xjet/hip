The actor took over a month-long break from April\nto May 2021 before returning with new campaigns that include some changes to the group’s\ntactics, techniques, and procedures:\n\nNew name: The group, who have previously identified themselves as “Fancy Bear”,\n“Lazarus,” “Lazarus Group,” and “Armada Collective,” among others, is now going by\n“Fancy Lazarus.” There is no known connection between this group and the APT actors\nwith the same names.\n\n\n-----\n\nNew price: The extortion emails now have adjusted ransom pricing, lowering it from\nransoms as high as ten Bitcoin (BTC) to its current two BTC starting price. This change\nis likely to account for Bitcoin’s fluctuating value.\nVariation in email content: In terms of email body content, the specific variant is\nreminiscent of the original variants from August 2020 with some minor changes and\nevolutions. It is interesting that the group is still going back and tweaking the original\nemail, potentially indicating its effectiveness. Between August 2020 and\nnow, however, they have tried completely different text in the emails.\n\n## Background\n\n[In mid-to-late August 2020, Akamai and the U.S. Federal Bureau of](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2020/08/ransom-demands-return-new-ddos-extortion-threats-from-old-actors-targeting-finance-and-retail.html)\nInvestigation (FBI) [alerted organizations to a spate of ransom denial-of-service extortion](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7070798-FLASH-MU-000132-DD.html)\nemails from this group. According to the published reports, this group took aim at thousands\nof organizations from multiple global industry verticals. In each case the threat\nactor demanded Bitcoin payment or else a small-scale denial-of-service attack would be\nlaunched with a more substantial attack mere days later.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nThe campaigns always begin with sensational emails. The current iteration, as illustrated in\nFigure 1, starts with an announcement of the name the group uses currently and an\nacknowledgement that they are targeting a specific company. They then threaten a DDoS\nattack in seven days, and, to prove it is not a hoax, mention a \"small attack\" that will be\nlaunched on a specific IP, subnet, or Autonomous System. The emails claim that the max\nattack speed will be \"2 Tbps.” They also warn about potential damage to the target\ncompany’s reputation and loss of internet access at their offices almost\ncertainly to further coerce the victim into complying with their demands.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Example of current emails being sent by “Fancy Lazarus.”\n\nEach of the campaigns is also characterized by the following elements:\n\n**Recipients: The emails are typically sent to well researched recipients, such as**\nindividuals listed as contacts in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) or Whois information\nfor company networks. The emailed individuals also work in areas such as\ncommunications, external relations, investor relations. Additionally, extortion emails are\noften sent to email aliases such as help desk, abuse, administrative contacts, or\ncustomer service.\n**Email body: There are three email variants sent to the same recipients conveying the**\nsame information, except with the email body in plain text, HTML, or as a JPG image\nattachment. This is a likely an attempt to evade detections.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sender emails: Each sender email is different and unique to the targeted**\ncompany. Previously the sender often contained “Fancy Bear,” \"F.B.,” \"Armada\nCollective,” \"A.C.,” \"Lazarus,” or \"Lazarus Group,\" and even at times included the\ntargeted company’s highest-ranking person such as the CEO’s name. In the\nmost current campaign, a random “First name Last name” format is used and the\nnames appear fictional.\n**Sender email provider: Each email is created at one of the various free email**\nservices.\n**Payment: Proofpoint has observed ransom demands of two BTC, which**\nroughly equated to $76,000 USD on May 26, 2021. The price doubles to four BTC after\nthe deadline and increases by one BTC each day after that. The Bitcoin addresses are\nunique to each potential target.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile Proofpoint does not have visibility into the actual “Fancy Lazarus” DDoS attacks and\nwhether they are carried out, FBI [reporting indicates that many affected companies that pass](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7070798-FLASH-MU-000132-DD.html)\nthe threatened deadline either do not see any additional activity or the activity is successfully\n[mitigated. There are, however, several prominent institutions that have either received attack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-targeted-financial-sector-in-mass-extortion-campaign-11612909155)\ndemonstrations or reported an impact to their operations, so it is important for companies\nand organizations to be prepared by having appropriate mitigations in place such as using a\nDoS protection service and having disaster recovery plans at the ready.\n\n_EDIT (Added on 06/11/21)_\n\nA recent [report by Akamai also notes a resurgence of this activity since May 2021 and](https://blogs.akamai.com/2021/06/the-rapid-resurgence-of-ddos-extortion-that-didnt-take-long.html)\nprovides a great amount of details and examples on the specific nature of the DDoS traffic.\n\n_Is your organization protected from extortion threat actors?
