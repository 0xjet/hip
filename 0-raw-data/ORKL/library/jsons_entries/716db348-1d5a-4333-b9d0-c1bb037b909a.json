Vixen Panda is the one with the most focus\non Australia,\" he said.\n\nBased on his research, Mr Alperovitch said he believed Vixen Panda was actually a Beijingbased military unit within the People's Liberation Army's Third Department.\n\nThe Third Department, or 3PLA as it is known, is China's version of the US National Security\nAgency (NSA) or the Australian Signals Directorate.\n\n\"You have a unit of the Chinese military conducting espionage against Australian\nGovernment... and the information that they're stealing is being passed on through the\nmilitary chain to the leadership of the Chinese government,\" he said.\n\nPosted 13 Nov 201413 Nov 2014Thu 13 Nov 2014 at 7:23am, updated 13 Nov 201413 Nov\n2014Thu 13 Nov 2014 at 10:04am\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### Spy agency warns Australian business of G20-linked cyber attacks\n\n\n-----",
