This is typical of this\nkind of malware.\nMultiple-stage loader/shellcode execution has been researched in prior publications and has made it difficult to reach a proper\ninteractive disassembly workflow with the actual information-stealing logic.\nWe provide highlights of the Dark Web ‘buzz’ surrounding this malware.\nWe share telemetry insights which confirm that by the nature of how the malware is used, large orgs are also being subjected to\nincidental drive-by attacks that have a theoretical potential to escalate.\nWe present a method of forensically resolving API calls of homebrew function tables in “orphaned” memory dumps from\nconcluded sandbox runs, using the in-memory addresses alone.\nWe use this method to convert a memory dump of Rhadamanthys information stealing code into a workable interactive\ndisassembly database with resolved API calls, and showcase the newly available level of analysis by presenting a step-by-step\ndisassembly breakdown of how the malware compiles its own database of stolen Google Chrome information in order to send\nback to the C2 server.\n\n## Background\n\nWhat causes a man to wake up one day and say, “I’m going to build my own malware and go sell it to cybercriminals on the dark\nweb”? After all, the market is saturated with competitors, and the product is judged on the one sole metric of how many victims it has\nsuccessfully parted with their funds and personal data. Statistically, during the past 5 years, someone must have created what would\nhave been the great malware strain to stun the entire industry, but the first two criminals to actually try out the thing had a weak spam\ngame, got weak results, and that was that.\n\nAll this must have been acutely clear to an individual who on September 24, 2022, under the alias “kingcrete2022”, posted the\nfollowing to the appropriate channels:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe author did not rush into this venture. They had already spent half a year lurking in the forum as “kingcrete2022”, and possibly\nmore than that under other aliases. Builds of the malware would later surface that were already polished enough to see the light of\nday, yet had been compiled a full month before the official launch. It would not be surprising if this person had already spent a long\ntime operating in the cybercrime sphere, even before the debut of the “King Crete” persona – earlier this year Analyst1 published an\nastoundingly in-depth report on the LockBit gang, with a repeated emphasis on how the ransomware-sphere was much smaller and\nincestuous than people tend to assume; it’s easy to imagine the same incentives at work dictating that one does not go from being a\nnobody to publishing an offering like the above after just six months of familiarity with the cybercrime landscape, and that this isn’t the\nKing’s first rodeo.\n\nFollowing this announcement, KingCrete aggressively went to work, determined to prove that his was the superior product. Curious\nwould-be clients who nonchalantly remarked “seems interesting, I will check it out” earned an immediate response and a request to\npost a review and follow up with comments. A manic stream of version updates checkered the forum thread for the coming months,\nadding a very long litany of features, sub-features and sub-sub-features, and providing support in both English and Russian. One\nupdate reads, “repaired major security vulnerability that the panel session is not affected by password modification”; just “security\nvulnerability” alone would have technically sufficed, but it doesn’t project the same ruthless self-criticism and drive for excellence.\n\nAs luck would have it, the first few customers had their campaigns go as planned. “I like this stealer, rep++”, said one. “The stealer\nrocks, stealer and support is just great”, said the other. Just between these few early adopters, the campaigns they set up racked up\nthousands of compromised users, hundreds of thousands of compromised passwords and several hundred compromised\ncryptocurrency wallets. Some prospective customers had trouble getting their operation running, and the author made sure not to\nleave them behind, posting: “for those who have difficulties in purchasing VPS or servers, we provide turnkey solutions, please contact\nus if you need”.\n\nInterested?\n\n## Victimology\n\n\n-----\n\nIn theory, the author of Rhadamanthys isn’t concerned with what you do with the ill-gotten data handed to you by the stealer. Commit\nfraud, sell the data, start a civil war, it’s all the same to him. In practice, the main customers for off-the-shelf malware like this are\nopportunistic cybercriminals, who aim to infect whomever and whenever (“as long as the target is not located in the commonwealth of\nindependent states”, per the author, who certainly did not invent that practice). Campaign victims are therefore spread all around the\nworld, though some spikes are visible where a campaign particularly enjoyed success, and some operators will put their own twist on\n[where and how they aim the infection (one campaign disseminated samples under the guise of video editing software, such as OBS](https://twitter.com/1ZRR4H/status/1614728368334716932)\nstudio, pushed to the crowd of unsuspecting streamers via Google ads).\n\nFigure 5 – Two sample campaign heatmaps shared on the forums. The\n\nperpetrator of the second campaign, which netted 600,000+ passwords and 900+ cryptocurrency wallet contents, is the one who wrote\n“I like this stealer, rep++”, to which the author responded, “What a great New Year’s gift!”\nCommon wisdom says people who operate this sort of malware are typically not too concerned with “big game hunting” the way the\nbig ransomware gangs are. To them it’s a numbers game: rake in many victims and monetize them wholesale. Think of your favorite\nhack of the past decade, and chances are at no point it came to light that actually the initial breach was due to a trigger-happy\ncybercriminal spamming Emotet maldocs in every direction, who then suddenly realized one of their twenty thousand victims was a\nlucrative target. Still, these indiscriminate attacks do end up aimed at major organizations, by sheer statistics; via our telemetry we\nwere able to confirm an attempted Rhadamanthys infection of a government agency in Canada, as well as an energy company in\nIndia’s infrastructure sector. We like to imagine that even if these attempts had succeeded, they would have led to just two more\npeople having a bad day and canceling their credit cards, and not the more troubling scenario of a hefty sum exchanging hands\nfollowed by a champagne bottle being opened someplace geopolitically hostile to India; but there is certainly no guarantee of it.\n\n## Functionality Overview\n\nIn the award-winning film Everything Everywhere All At Once, antagonist Jobu Tupaki delivers the following monologue:\n\nI got bored one day, and I put everything on a bagel. Everything. All my hopes and dreams, my old report cards, every breed of\ndog, every last personal ad on craigslist. Sesame Poppy seed. Salt. And it collapsed in on itself. Because, you see, when you\nreally put everything on a bagel, it becomes this. The truth. [..] Nothing matters. Feels nice, doesn’t it? If nothing matters, then all\nthe pain and guilt you feel for making nothing of your life, it goes away. Sucked into a bagel.\n\nHaving read that, you now understand Rhadamanthys stealer’s design philosophy. The mind-numbing list of features included in the\ninitial release speaks plenty for itself already, but we would be remiss not to emphasize the inclusion of – for instance – capabilities for\nstealing information from KMeleon and Pale Moon web browsers, which each possess a market share imperceptible to the naked\n\n\n-----\n\neye; or stealing cryptocurrency from the Firefox Auvitas Wallet browser extension, which, as of the writing of these words, has\nexactly one user. Rhadamanthys’ feature list was not hand-picked to maximize return on developer time investment. It resulted from\none simple guiding principle: “Add it in! Add it all in!”.\n\nFigure 6 – It’s too late. You can’t look away from\n\nit now.\nMaybe you are here for the actual list of things that King Crete had put on the bagel. In that pathological case, the list follows below,\nwithout bulleted list format so as not to consume too much vertical real estate. Rhadamanthys’ feature list includes stealing the victim’s\nsystem information – Computer name, username, ram capacity, CPU cores, screen\n**resolution, timezone, geoip, environment, installed software, screenshots, cookies, history, autofill, saved credit**\n**cards, downloads, favorites and extensions; it steals credentials from FTP clients – Cyberduck, FTP**\n**Navigator, FTPRush, FlashFXP, Smartftp, TotalCommander, Winscp, Ws_ftp and Coreftp; and from Mail**\nclients CheckMail, Clawsmail, GmailNotifierPro, Mailbird, Outlook, PostboxApp, Thebat!, Thunderbird, TrulyMail, eM and Foxmail;\nIt steals credentials from 2FA applications and password managers RoboForm, RinAuth, Authy and KeePass; VPN services\nincluding AzrieVPN, NordVPN, OpenVPN, PrivateVPN_Global_AB, ProtonVPN and WindscribeVPN; Note-taking applications\nincluding NoteFly, Notezilla, Simple Stick Notes and Windows Sticky notes; Message history from messenger applications\nincluding Psi+, Pidgin, tox, Discord and Telegram; also, it steals victim credentials for Steam, TeamViewer and SecureCRT.\n\nFigure 7 – Exfiltrated Filezilla FTP credentials as they appear on the attacker’s end.\nThe author put a particular emphasis on features related to stealing cryptocurrency; in one version update, which featured 9 new\nfeatures, 4 of these were enhancements to exfiltrating and cracking cryptocurrency wallets. The list of supported wallets in the initial\nrelease is truly unwieldy, and includes Auvitas, BitApp, Crocobit, Exodus, Finnie, GuildWallet, ICONex, Jaxx, Keplr, Liquality,\n**MTV, Metamask, Mobox, Nifty, Oxygen, Phantom, Rabet, Ronin, Slope, Sollet, Starcoin, Swash, Terra, Station, Tron, XinPay,**\n**Yoroi, ZilPay, Coin98, Armory, AtomicWallet, Atomicdex, Binance, Bisq, BitcoinCore, BitcoinGold, Bytecoin, coinomi,**\n**DashCore, DeFi, Dogecoin, Electron, Electrum, Ethereum, Exodus, Frame, Guarda, Jaxx, LitecoinCore, Monero, MyCrypto,**\n**MyMonero, Safepay, Solar, Tokenpocket, WalletWasabi, Zap, Zcash and Zecwallet. We wouldn’t blame the reader for wondering**\nhow many of these are actually Pokemon that we had covertly added to the list as a practical joke.\n\nAll of these stealing actions are performed automatically upon infection. If the attacker decides to get more hands-on with the infected\nmachine, they can push a new configuration to the “file grabbing” module, which will exfiltrate all files matching a windows search\nquery; or, for the true power user, push hand-crafted powershell to be executed on the victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nappear on the attacker’s end.\n\nexfiltrated by the “file grab” module as they appear on the attacker’s end.\n\n## Technical Analysis Highlights\n\n### Preliminary execution flow\n\n\nFigure 8 – Exfiltrated environment variables as they\n\nFigure 9 – Files\n\n\nIn [this detailed and instructive write-up, Eli Salem punches with determination through each of the half-dozen execution stages](https://elis531989.medium.com/dancing-with-shellcodes-analyzing-rhadamanthys-stealer-3c4986966a88)\n(droppers, shellcodes, installers, …) that this malware goes through before it gets to the information-stealing functionality.\n\nWhen analyzing Rhadamanthys, we have observed differences between the logic of the analyzed sample and the logic detailed in the\nabove write-up, which testify to the malware’s constant development and flexible build process. Most notable was the behavior of the\nNSIS loader DLL, which in the execution flow we analyzed, creates a suspended process\nfrom C:\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft.Net\\\\Framework\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\AppLaunch.exe then replaces the suspended process’ sections oneby-one with injected malicious code.\n\nAs described in the above-mentioned write-up, the injected code then proceeds to load several execution stages in sequence, one of\n[which attempts many VM evasions taken from the Al-Khaser project and then unhooks functions in ntdll.dll in an attempt to avoid](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser)\ndetection. Finally, it resolves an internally obfuscated C2 address and, from there, downloads the final stage containing the actual\ninformation-stealing functionality.\n\n### Analyzing an Orphaned Memory Dump\n\nAnalyzing the actual stealing logic is not so straightforward. Without access to a live C2 server, at this point an analyst has two\noptions. Either they go chasing a brand new execution chain, doing the hard work debugging all the stages and hoping to catch a live\nC2 server which won’t filter them out using god knows how many heuristics; or else working with a dump in an unreadable state\n\n\n-----\n\n[obtained from a sandbox run that happened when the C2 was still live. In this particular case the memory dump contains many telling](https://tria.ge/221227-vprhbsae8t/behavioral2#report)\nstrings that telegraph what the malware does in broad strokes, but there are many obstacles before proper interactive disassembly\ncan take place.\n\nThe first and most major obstacle is the lack of resolution for API calls. Opening the dump in a disassembler and following the function\ncalls, one very quickly runs across what must be a homebrew import table of dynamically resolved functions. The dump is an artifact of\na sandbox run that has long since concluded and these addresses seem to be meaningless now. We were able to resolve nearly\nevery function using a method that will be explained below.\n\nFirst, we know that these addresses, during the sandbox run, pointed to DLLs that were loaded into memory. Second, we know in\n[what environment the execution took place: a tria.ge environment with the code name Win10v2004-20220812-en. We upload our own](http://tria.ge/)\ndummy executable to the sandbox, make sure that we choose the same environment used in the original sandbox run, then look at a\nDLL of our choice and recover the DLL version.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, even if we do have the DLL version, Microsoft is not so generous with offering historical versions of DLLs for download.\n[There are various workarounds for this sort of issue (e.g. you might want to consult winbindex). We opted to use an esoteric feature](https://winbindex.m417z.com/)\nof [tria.ge sandbox: many users had asked for functionality to manually dump files generated during an execution flow. As a](http://tria.ge/)\n[workaround, the sandbox introduced a feature allowing users to dump any file they wish, as long as they open windows File Explorer](https://hatching.io/blog/dropped-files-ui/#dump-deleted-files)\nand delete the file there manually. Well, if we try deleting kernel32.dll from its residing place in C:\\windows\\system32 the OS won’t\nallow it (and justifiably so), but nothing prevents us from copying the file somewhere else, then deleting the copy. The same DLL\nloaded into memory during the original sandbox run is now available from the “downloads” section of the analysis report once the\nanalysis is terminated.\n\nIn this way we download many DLLs that are the “usual suspects” that malware, or any software really, would want to resolve APIs\nfrom – such as advapi32.dll, user32.dll, msvcrt.dll, ws2_32.dll and so on. Now we can open each of these in a disassembler,\nwhich manually loads the file and assigns virtual addresses to each of the DLL functions. Sadly we are far from done because we still\ndo not know the base address of the DLL when it was loaded originally, or even what particular DLL contains the function that some\nmemory address refers to.\n\nNot even knowing which is the relevant DLL can be mitigated to some degree by plain observation – for example, in the below image,\nthe function qword_c5c08 (pointer value 0x7ffbf1bd5f20) is taking a registry key as an argument, and so is highly likely to have come\nfrom advapi32.dll. But this won’t work for every DLL – we won’t always be lucky enough to find a function that the malware feeds\nsuch an incriminating hardcoded string as a parameter. More crucially, even if we somehow knew the correct DLL for every function\naddress, this still wouldn’t tell us the original address the DLL was loaded at during the original sandbox run, necessary to calculate\nthe rebase delta between the function addresses that were loaded then into memory (which we are trying to resolve) and the labeled\nfunction addresses in the loaded, annotated DLL that we have open in the disassembler.\n\nFigure 15 – qword_c5c08 is\n\nprobably a function that interacts with the Windows registry in some way.\nTo get past this hurdle we note that the function addresses in the sandbox dump are probably divided into contiguous sequences that\nwere each imported from the same DLL. This means if we take 10 qword pointers from the table and get lucky enough that they were\nall resolved from the same DLL, then in that DLL when loaded into memory, these 10 functions will exist with the\nsame differences between their addresses. To show the key insight here we will use a toy example: suppose our list of 10 addresses\nto resolve begins with some address AX then proceeds with AX+0x300, AX+0x500, AX+0x930, and so on six other addresses;\nsuppose further that in one of the loaded and annotated DLLs we find that for some address AY it happens\nthat AY+0x300, AY+0x500, AY+0x930 and so on and so on are all addresses of functions. This is a very lucky coincidence to have\nhappened on its own, and in all probability, the original address AX in the original sandbox run resolved to the function that is in AY in\nour annotated file. It is possible to further sanity-check the match by looking at the 10 function names that match the addresses on the\nlist and verifying that they seem like a reasonable list to have been required by the software that had been run in the sandbox.\n\nThe following IDAPython code, when run in a loaded DLL database, will automate the task of finding matches of function address\nsequences:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndef dll_match(imports):\n\n  result = []\n\n  import_anchor = imports[0]\n\n  for anchor in exports:\n\n    if all([anchor+(_import-import_anchor) in exports for _import in imports]):\n\n      result.append({_import:get_func_name(anchor+(_import-import_anchor)) for _import in imports})\n\n  return result\n\n```\nFor example, the address seen in the above image (the one we suspect to have been resolved from advapi32.dll) appears in the\nfollowing sequence of 10 addresses:\n```\n[0x7ffbf1bd5950, 0x7ffbf1bd5f20, 0x7ffbf1bd6a80, 0x7ffbf1bd5f90, 0x7ffbf1bd6830, 0x7ffbf1bee0c0, 0x7ffbf1bee120,\n0x7ffbf1bc42d0, 0x7ffbf1bdb970, 0x7ffbf1bd6780, 0x7ffbf1bd6c50, 0x7ffbf1bd69d0, 0x7ffbf1bd6490, 0x7ffbf1bd5f40,\n0x7ffbf1bd7580, 0x7ffbf1bd7530, 0x7ffbf1bd6a20]\n\n```\nWe open an annotated idb of the advapi32.dll file we dumped from the sandbox, load the above IDA script and run the\nfunction dll_match with this list of addresses as input. As output we receive the correct resolution for each of these function\naddresses.\n\nIt turns out that the above-mentioned function that had been loaded to the address 0x7ffbf1bd5f20 during the sandbox run\nis RegQueryValueExW. Using this method, it is easy to go “shopping” and try running the same script against various DLLs to see what\nmatches are obtained, and how feasible they are. While that specific workflow doesn’t scale very well, it’s not too difficult to see how\nthe process can be streamlined, if need be (for instance, by keeping a precomputed database of function address differences of many\nDLL versions, and making all the difference comparisons against it).\n\n### Interactive Disassembly of a Sample Functionality: Stealing Chrome Information\n\nEven with the API calls resolved, the database is still very large and spans over 2500 functions. Many of these are library functions\n[from 3rd party libraries such as sqlite3 and lua_cjson; this introduces a further hassle in that resolving these functions requires us to](https://github.com/mpx/lua-cjson/blob/e8972ac754788d3ef10a57a36016d6c3e85ba20d/lua_cjson.c)\ncompile our own annotated version of these libraries and then perform a bindiff (or somesuch) to label the functions used by\nRhadamanthys. This is an infamously finicky process, and many of the labels are not of very much use before being verified manually.\n\nWith all that said, the state of the database is more palatable now and allows us to analyze the execution flow in a way we couldn’t\nbefore. As an example we will focus on the malware’s capability of stealing stored login credentials, cookies and so on from Google\nChrome, which includes three stages:\n\nSearching for the correct directory containing all the data\nReading raw data out of files of interest containing cookies, login data, and so on\nBased on whether the data is in JSON or SQL database format, using 3rd-party library logic to parse the data\n\nThe malware first performs a recursive search of the victim filesystem for a file named “web data” in order to navigate\nto %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\\\\default, then traverses the tree to look for other artifacts such as “Cookies” or\n“Login Data” and collects each match into a binary bitfield; if this bitfield is sufficiently nonzero, the malware is then satisfied that it has\nlocated the Chrome directory correctly.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then accesses files of interest, such as login data. Some of these files are SQL databases, in which case the malware\ninitializes a SQL database from the file contents in-memory, then obtains the desired data by issuing a SELECT statement. In contrast,\nothers are in JSON format, and so the malware instead calls a function to parse the JSON and extract the value associated with a\ncertain key:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWith the information parsed into plaintext format, it can now be appended to the database of stolen information that is eventually\nreported back to the attacker, and the stealing functionality for this specific target (Chrome) is concluded. Most of Rhadamanthys’ code\nbase is composed of an entirely too large amount of variations on this same idea, each targeting a different piece of data as laid out in\nthe earlier description of the malware’s feature set.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRhadamanthys represents a step in the emerging tradition of malware that tries to do as much as possible, and also a demonstration\n[that in the malware business, having a strong brand is everything. Some readers may recall the odd tale of Godzilla loader, which tried](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/godzilla-loader-and-the-long-tail-of-malware/)\nto undercut Emotet by retailing for a quarter of the price and boasted a set of features so different from its competitor that a proper\ncomparison between the two was impossible. This was a stark demonstration that cybercriminals don’t make explicit calculations of\nwhich feature-sets will net them a higher amount of victims – they rely on a fuzzy feeling of how well they trust the developer, the\nbrand and the sound of the feature list; and, failing that, on trial and error. Any developer can write a piece of malware, and some\ndevelopers can even write a decent piece of malware with useful features, but it takes a cunning mind in tune with the market to come\nout swinging like the author of this malware did, shouting “I have all the features, I have the best features” and fostering a successful\nrelationship with a base of early adopters.\n\nShould we be worried? It is tempting to quietly classify malware like Rhadamanthys in the “nuisance” drawer. An uninvited credit card\ncharge of $2,000 doesn’t seem like much compared to ransomware and the existential threat it poses to entire organizations. It’s easy\nto forget the process by which the $2,000 charge happens – the malware doesn’t just steal your credit card details, it steals everything.\nIt is a relief that employees in government agencies and energy companies who get hit with this kind of malware are typically treated\nthe same by attackers as any other victim, but we would do well to remember that this is not a law of nature.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe would also do well to dwell on the technical demands such malware poses to us on the defensive side. It used to be a quaint sport\nto sidestep sandboxes and frustrate analysts who are trying to properly disassemble, debug, analyze the API call log of some\nmalware. For how long can the analysis be delayed? An hour? A day? God forbid, a week? But nowadays, there seems to be a\nsinister shift where malware authors have gotten more ambitious and are saying, let’s see how close I can get to the whole analysis\njust not happening. While we are still quite far off from that scary scenario, malicious instruments that inch us closer there are being\nthought of all the time, and the unexplored and under-explored space of such instruments is well and truly frightening. As an industry, it\nis paramount that we create new tools and protocols to meet these instruments with equal and opposite force when they arrive.\n\nGO UP\n[BACK TO ALL POSTS](https://research.checkpoint.com/latest-publications/)\n\n\n-----",
