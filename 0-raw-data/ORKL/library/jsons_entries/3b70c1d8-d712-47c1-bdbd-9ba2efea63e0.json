It’s quite odd (and probably underreported), however, to see it used\n[as a vector for cyberespionage.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/can-online-dating-apps-be-used-to-target-your-company/)\n\n[We stumbled upon the Confucius hacking group while delving into Patchwork’s cyberespionage](https://www.scmagazine.com/cc-attacks-used-plain-text-to-drop-malware-on-quora-and-yahoo-answers/article/529775/)\noperations, and found a number of similarities. Code in their custom malware bore similarities, for\ninstance. Confucius targeted a particular set of individuals in South Asian countries, such as\nmilitary personnel and businessmen, among others.\n\nAre Patchwork and Confucius the same group? The commands in their backdoors do resemble each\nother. The config files have a similar, custom structure, and both groups have infrastructure overlap.\nHowever, we construe them to be different groups, possibly within the same community, with\ndifferent objectives and modi operandi. While Patchwork may be more straightforward with its\npredominantly malware-based attacks, Confucius’ can be inferred to be more nuanced, relying\nheavily on social engineering.\n\n**_Exploiting the human psyche with chat apps_**\nProbing Confucius’ infrastructure, we came across websites offering Windows and Android chat\napplications, most likely iterations of its predecessor, Simple Chat Point: Secret Chat Point, and\nTweety Chat. We are admittedly uncertain of the extent — and success — of their use, but it’s one\nof the ingredients of the group’s operations.\n\nWhile the chat applications indeed have real chat features (although the communication is not\nanonymous, as advertised), they have backdoor routines and file-stealing behaviors that get\ntriggered when specific words are sent to the app: collecting and harvesting all SMS messages,\ncontacts, and accounts. Tweety Chat’s Android version can record audio, too. Its latest version can\nmute the device (i.e., take out the ringtone and vibration features) and sync call logs and SMSs.\n\nWe further tested Tweety Chat and saw red flags indicating their targets of interest: verification\nemails with a physical address whose postal code is assigned to a provincial capital that also\nappears (upon logging in) as a chat channel in Tweety Chat.\n\n\nFeatured Stories\n\nsystemd Vulnerability Leads\n[to Denial of Service on](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/systemd-vulnerability-leads-to-denial-of-service-on-linux/)\nLinux\nqkG Filecoder: Self[Replicating, Document-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/qkg-filecoder-self-replicating-document-encrypting-ransomware/)\nEncrypting Ransomware\nMitigating CVE-2017-5689,\n[an Intel Management Engine](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mitigating-cve-2017-5689-intel-management-engine-vulnerability/)\nVulnerability\nA Closer Look at North\nKorea’s Internet\nFrom Cybercrime to\nCyberpropaganda\n\nSecurity Predictions for 2018\n\nAttackers are banking on\nnetwork vulnerabilities and\ninherent weaknesses to\nfacilitate massive malware\nattacks, IoT hacks, and\noperational disruptions.

The chat logs shed light on the social engineering used by the operators\nto persuade victims to install the cyberespionage malware on their Android devices. The first user\nand chatroom were created on August 27, 2017, and were probably the app authors’ testing ground.\nThe succeeding users and chatrooms were created on October 31 and December 12 the latest.\n\nA certain hayat22 and love piqued our interest. hayat22, supposedly a female student, engaged in\nan online romance with a target whose handle was love, describing himself as living in South Asia\nworking in garments manufacturing and wholesaling.\n\nOver the course of their correspondence, love suggested using WhatsApp to\ncommunicate. hayat22 declined, saying she felt safer using Tweety Chat. love refused, but\nwhen hayat22 demurred and gave love an online cold shoulder, love tried installing Tweety Chat —\nand failed. He claimed that he wasn’t able to install the app. hayat22 quickly lost interest and\nstopped replying to him altogether. She also sent him a screenshot to show what Tweety Chat\nlooked like.\n\nWe’re not sure how love wound up in the chat room or how he met hayat22. He was probably\neither using the Windows version of Secret Chat Point or its web interface, which explains\nwhy hayat22 was urging him to install Android Tweety Chat.\n\nIn an earlier chat group, an operator called Heena urged the members to install Secret Chat Point on\nother people’s mobile devices to get perks like credits or the ability to “go invisible”. In another\nchat room called “Maira’s room”, a target of interest disclosed he was a government officer\ntraveling back from a northern city near the country’s provincial capital. A few days after, the\noperator stopped answering in the chat room, and her user account was deleted from the server.\n\n_Figure 2: ByeBye Shell’s interface showing Confucius’ campaigns_\n\n_Figure 3: Screenshot showing a group chat where the moderator is urging users to install Tweety_\n\n_Chat_\n\n\ng\n\nqkG Filecoder: Self[Replicating, Document-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/qkg-filecoder-self-replicating-document-encrypting-ransomware/)\nEncrypting Ransomware\n\nBad Rabbit Ransomware\n[Spreads via Network, Hits](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bad-rabbit-ransomware-spreads-via-network-hits-ukraine-russia/)\nUkraine and Russia\n\nA Look at Locky\n[Ransomware’s Recent Spam](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/look-locky-ransomwares-recent-spam-activities/)\nActivities\n\nMagnitude Exploit Kit Now\n[Targeting South Korea With](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/magnitude-exploit-kit-now-targeting-korea-with-magniber-ransomware/)\nMagniber Ransomware\n\nRecent Posts\n\nTropic Trooper’s New\nStrategy\n\nMarch Patch Tuesday\nFixes 75 Security Issues,\n[Drops Registry Key](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/march-patch-tuesday-fixes-75-security-issues-drops-registry-key-requirement-in-windows-10/)\nRequirement in Windows\n10\n\nDetecting Attacks that\nExploit Meltdown and\nSpectre with Performance\nCounters\n\nCampaign Possibly\nConnected to\n[“MuddyWater” Surfaces](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/)\nin the Middle East and\nCentral Asia\n\nCryptocurrency-Mining\n[Malware: 2018’s New](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cryptocurrency-mining-malware-2018-new-menace/)\nMenace?\n\nRansomware 101\n\nThis infographic shows how\nransomware has evolved,\nhow big the problem has\nbecome, and ways to avoid\nbeing a ransomware victim.\n[Check the infographic](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-101-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)\n\nPopular Posts\n\nHomemade Browser\n[Targeting Banco do Brasil](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/homemade-browser-targeting-banco-do-brasil-users/)\nUsers\nVulnerabilities in Apache\n[CouchDB Open the Door to](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/vulnerabilities-apache-couchdb-open-door-monero-miners/)\n\n\n-----\n\np\nMonero Miner Payloads\nCryptocurrency-Mining\n[Malware: 2018’s New](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cryptocurrency-mining-malware-2018-new-menace/)\nMenace?\nNew AndroRAT Exploits\nDated Privilege Escalation\nVulnerability, Allows\nPermanent Rooting\n\nStay Updated\n\nEmail Subscription\n\n\nYour email here\n\n\n_Figure 4: Screenshot showing Tweety Chat promoted in social media_\n\n**_A tangled web of malware_**\nConfucius’ operations include deploying bespoke backdoors and stealing files from their victim’s\nsystems with tailored file stealers, some of which bore resemblances to Patchwork’s. The stolen\nfiles are then exfiltrated by abusing a cloud storage service. Some of these file stealers specifically\ntarget files from USB devices, probably to overcome air-gapped environments.\n\nCompared to Patchwork, whose Trojanized documents exploit at least five security flaws,\nConfucius’ backdoors are delivered through Office files exploiting memory corruption\n[vulnerabilities CVE-2015-1641 and CVE-2017-11882. Their malware’s resemblance to that of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/vulnerability/7404/microsoft-office-memory-corruption-vulnerability-cve20151641)\nPatchwork’s is also notable. The use of an exploit for a security flaw disclosed in December 2017\nand their recent activities suggest Confucius is keenly trailing their targets.\n\nConfucius has a miscellany of backdoors: sctrls, ByeBye Shell, remote-access-c3, and\nsip_telephone, to name a few. One of its file stealers, swissknife2, abuses a cloud storage service as\na repository of exfiltrated files. At the time of research, there were around 60 victims whose data\nwere uploaded to Confucius-owned cloud storage account. There were also a few thousand files in\nthe account that were later deleted.\n\nOur research, **[Deciphering Confucius: A Look at the Group’s Cyberespionage Operations,](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/research-deciphering-confucius-cyberespionage-operations.pdf)**\ndelves into the group’s operations, the social engineering methods and gamut of malware it uses,\nand the countermeasures that organizations can adopt to mitigate them.
