Ensure these copies are not accessible for modification or deletion from\nany system where the original data resides.\nImplement network segmentation, such that all machines on your network are not\naccessible from every other machine.\nInstall and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time\ndetection.\nInstall updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as\nupdates/patches are released.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or\nunrecognized user accounts.\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with\nleast privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\nDisable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor\nremote access/RDP logs for any unusual activity.\nConsider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\nDisable hyperlinks in received emails.\nUse double authentication when logging into accounts or services.\nEnsure routine auditing is conducted for all accounts.\nEnsure all the identified IOCs are input into the network SIEM for continuous\nmonitoring and alerts.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Cybersecurity agencies reveal top initial access attack vectors](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cybersecurity-agencies-reveal-top-initial-access-attack-vectors/)\n\n[FBI, CISA, and NSA warn of hackers increasingly targeting MSPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-cisa-and-nsa-warn-of-hackers-increasingly-targeting-msps/)\n\n[FBI: BlackCat ransomware breached at least 60 entities worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-blackcat-ransomware-breached-at-least-60-entities-worldwide/)\n\n[FBI warns of ransomware attacks targeting US agriculture sector](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-warns-of-ransomware-attacks-targeting-us-agriculture-sector/)\n\n[US and allies warn of Russian hacking threat to critical infrastructure](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-and-allies-warn-of-russian-hacking-threat-to-critical-infrastructure/)\n\n\n-----",
