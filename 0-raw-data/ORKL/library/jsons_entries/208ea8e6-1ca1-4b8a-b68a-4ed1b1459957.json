These events don't need to be global in nature, and are often only of local or regional interest. This helps the\nbad actors narrow their target hoping for a greater chance of success.\n\nSo when the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) terminates engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts it\nhad previously awarded, attentive cybercriminals have new fodder for another scheme.\n\nSince July 2020, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team has observed an increase in targeted attacks against multiple supply chain-related\norganizations in the oil and gas sector in the Middle East. We discovered multiple instances of malicious PDF files sent as email\nattachments and were used to distribute an information-stealing Trojan, AZORult, to these organizations.\n\nIn this blog, we describe the details of this campaign, explaining the attack vectors, the malware distribution strategy, and the threat\nattribution.\n\n## Distribution strategy\n\nThe attack chain begins with an email that appears to be from an official working at the ADNOC and is targeted at officials working in\nthe supply chain and government sectors in the Middle East.\n\nEach email in this campaign has an attached PDF file. This PDF contains download links on the first page that lead to legitimate file\nsharing sites, such as wetransfer and mega.nz where a ZIP archive is hosted. The ZIP archive contains a malicious and packed .NET\nexecutable that will decrypt, load, and execute the embedded AZORult binary. Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the\nattack flow.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: The flow of attack_\n\n**Email analysis**\n\nFigure 2 shows an email message that pretends to come from a senior chemist of lab operations of ADNOC Sour Gas.\n\n_Figure 2: A fake email sent to officials in the supply chain industry in the Middle East._\n\nIn all the cases, the emails were sent from Gmail-based address. The two Gmail addresses observed in the attacks were:\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f58694999086869c929894cdc2b59298949c99db969a98)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f484869b97818699919a80da979c919287929d868780da979b99b49399959d98da979b99)\n\nThe threat actor also leveraged anonymous email services from Tutanota to create emails registered with keemail.me and tuta.io\nwhich were also used in this email campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PDF files attached to the email are multipage documents (containing 14 pages) that appear to be Requests for Quotations (RFQ)\nfor supply contracts and legal tenders for various projects related to ADNOC and the Doha airport. The decoy documents are\ncarefully crafted to appear legitimate for social engineering purposes. The first page of each document contains the instructions to\naccess the specifications and drawings using embedded download links that lead to malicious ZIP archives as described in the attack\nflow above.\n\nSome examples of the content in the PDFs include:\n\n**PDF Filename: PI-18031 Dalma Gas Development Project (Package B) -TENDER BULLETIN-01.pdf**\n\n**MD5 hash: e368837a6cc3f6ec5dfae9a71203f2e2**\n\nFigure 3 shows a PDF that pretends to be a legitimate Request for Quotation (RFQ) related to the Dalma gas development project. It\nbears the logo of ADNOC at the top right and the first page contains the malicious download links.\n\n_Figure 3: The fake letter contained in the PDF associated with this attack._\n\n**PDF Filename: AJC-QA HAMAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT EXPANSION, DOHA.pdf**\n\n**MD5 hash: abab000b3162ed6001ed8a11024dd21c**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 shows a PDF that pretends to be a Request for Quotation for Hamad International Airport expansion plan for Doha and\nsupposedly comes from a supply chain trading contractor in Qatar.\n\n_Figure 4: The fake RFQ for a local airport expansion project._\n\n## Threat attribution\n\nThe threat actor is specifically interested in Middle East targets, such as organisations in the supply chain and government sectors of\nthe Middle East, especially the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar.\n\nBased on the target recipients of the email, the contents of the email, and the attached PDF files, along with the metadata and\ninfrastructure analysis, we conclude that this is a targeted attack on organisations in the Middle East.\n\n## Metadata analysis\n\nAfter investigating the metadata of PDF files, we were able to discover several PDFs that we associate with the same threat actor.\nThe distribution method has been used in the wild from January 2020 through May 2020 in low volume.\n\nStarting from July 2020, we observed an increase in the activity of this threat actor, returning with a new campaign.\n\nThe metadata of the PDF files indicates that they were generated using Microsoft Office Word 2013. The only unique author names\nused in all the PDF samples were:\n\nDonor1\n\nMr. Adeel\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of the metadata for the PDF file with the MD5 hash e368837a6cc3f6ec5dfae9a71203f2e2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: The metadata of one of the PDFs used in this campaign._\n\nThe complete list of all the PDF samples identified in this campaign is provided in the Appendix.\n\n## Infrastructure analysis\n\nIn addition to the contents of the emails and the documents that were used for threat attribution, we can also infer from the Command\nand Control (C&C) infrastructure that the threat actor has specifically chosen a C&C server that blends with the theme.\n\nThe C&C server in the samples we discovered was crevisoft.net.\n\nAt the time of analysis, this domain was resolving to the IP address 167.114.57.136. We observed that this domain, when accessed\ndirectly, would redirect to a service consulting company from Egypt hosted at crevisoft.com as shown in Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: A legitimate Middle East-based site hosted at crevisoft.com._\n\nAll of the following four domains would redirect to the above domain:\n\ncrevisoft.net\n\ncis.sh\n\ncrevisoft.org\n\ncrevisoft.co\n\nWith a high confidence level, we can conclude that this threat actor is interested in stealing information and gaining access to\ninfrastructure of supply chain-related organisations located in the Middle East.\n\n## Technical analysis of the .NET payload\n\nFor the purpose of technical analysis, we will consider the .NET binary with MD5 hash: 84e7b5a60cd771173b75a775e0399bc7\n\nThis payload, which is present inside the downloaded ZIP archive, is a packed and obfuscated .NET binary.\n\nBased on static analysis, we can see that the payload pretends to be a Skype application with spoofed metadata as shown in Figure\n7.\n\n_Figure 7: Metadata of the main .NET executable._\n\nUpon execution, it unpacks another payload that is embedded in the resource section. Figure 8 shows the custom algorithm that\ndecrypts the payload using a hardcoded key “GXR20”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: The subroutine used to decrypt the second stage .NET DLL._\n\n## Second stage\n\nFigure 9 shows the decrypted payload, which is a .NET DLL with the MD5 hash 0988195ab961071b4aa2d7a8c8e6372d and the\nname Aphrodite.dll\n\n_Figure 9: The unpacked and loaded second stage DLL called Aphrodite._\n\nThe code execution is transferred to the DLL by creating an object for class named “Mortiz.Anton” along with the following three\nparameters, as shown in Figure 10.\n\nugz1: “ddLPjs” (name of the bitmap image resource)\n\nugz3: ”KKBxPQsGk” (the decryption key)\n\nprojName: “Skype” (name of the project of main executable)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: The code control passed to the Aphrodite DLL._\n\nThis DLL further unpacks another binary, which is embedded as a bitmap image in the resource section of the main executable, as\nshown in Figure 11.\n\n_Figure 11: The bitmap image inside the resource section that contains the next stage payload._\n\nSimilar to the second stage (Aphrodite), it is also encrypted with a custom algorithm. The custom algorithm is based on XOR using\nthe key indicated by the parameter ugz3.\n\n## Third stage\n\nThe resulting unpacked binary is a .NET DLL with MD5 hash ae5f14478d5e06c1b2dc2685cbe992c1 and the name Jupiter.\n\nThe code control is transferred to the third stage DLL via a call to one of its routines as shown in Figure 12.\n\n_Figure 12: The unpacked and loaded third stage DLL called Jupiter._\n\nThis third stage DLL uses various methods to detect the presence of a virtualization or an analysis environment.\n\n## Evasion techniques\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a summary of the methods used by this DLL to detect the analysis environment.\n\n## Registry checks:\n\nRegistry key: \"HARDWARE\\\\DEVICEMAP\\\\Scsi\\\\Scsi Port 0\\\\Scsi Bus 0\\\\Target Id 0\\\\Logical Unit Id 0\"\n\nValue: \"Identifier\"\n\nData contains: \"VBOX\" OR \"VMWARE\" OR \"QEMU\"\n\nRegistry key: \"HARDWARE\\\\Description\\\\System\"\n\nValue: \"SystemBiosVersion\"\n\nData contains: \"VBOX\" OR \"QEMU\"\n\nRegistry key: \"HARDWARE\\\\Description\\\\System\"\n\nValue: \"VideoBiosVersion\"\n\nData contains: \"VIRTUALBOX\"\n\nChecks if key present: \"SOFTWARE\\\\Oracle\\\\VirtualBox Guest Additions\" OR \"SOFTWARE\\\\VMware, Inc.\\\\VMware Tools\"\n\nRegistry key: \"HARDWARE\\\\DEVICEMAP\\\\Scsi\\\\Scsi Port 1\\\\Scsi Bus 0\\\\Target Id 0\\\\Logical Unit Id 0\"\n\nValue: \"Identifier\"\n\nData contains: \"VMWARE\"\n\nRegistry key: \"HARDWARE\\\\DEVICEMAP\\\\Scsi\\\\Scsi Port 2\\\\Scsi Bus 0\\\\Target Id 0\\\\Logical Unit Id 0\"\n\nValue: \"Identifier\"\n\nData contains: \"VMWARE\"\n\nRegistry key: \"SYSTEM\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum\"\n\nValue: \"0\"\n\nData contains: \"VMWARE\"\n\nRegistry key: \"SYSTEM\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Control\\\\Class\\\\{4D36E968-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\\\\0000\"\n\nValue: \"DriverDesc\"\n\nData contains: \"VMWARE\"\n\nRegistry key:\n\n\"SYSTEM\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Control\\\\Class\\\\{4D36E968-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\\\\0000\\\\Settings\"\n\nValue: \"Device Description\"\n\nData contains: \"VMWARE\"\n\nRegistry key: \"SOFTWARE\\\\VMware, Inc.\\\\VMware Tools\"\n\nValue: \"InstallPath\"\n\nData contains: \"C:\\\\PROGRAM FILES\\\\VMWARE\\\\VMWARE TOOLS\\\\\"\n\n**Wine environment detection:**\n\nChecks if the export functions of kernel32.dll contains: wine_get_unix_file_name\n\n**Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query-based checks:**\n\nWMI Query: \"SELECT * FROM Win32 VideoController\"\n\n\n-----\n\nProperty: Description\n\nChecks for the presence of the following keywords in the description field:\n\n\"VM Additions S3 Trio32/64\"\n\"S3 Trio32/64\"\n\"VirtualBox Graphics Adapter\"\n\"VMware SVGA II\"\n\"VMWARE\"\n\n**DLL name-based checks:**\n\nChecks for the presence of a DLL with the name: \"SbieDll.dll\" in the process address space.\n\n**Username-based checks:**\n\nChecks if the system username contains either of the following strings:\n\n\"USER\"\n\"SANDBOX\"\n\"VIRUS\"\n\"MALWARE\"\n\"SCHMIDTI\"\n\"CURRENTUSER\"\n\n**Filename or filepath-based checks:**\n\nFilePath contains: \"//VIRUS\" OR \"SANDBOX\" OR \"SAMPLE\" OR \"C:\\\\file.exe\"\n\n**Window class check:**\n\n\"Afx:400000:0\"\n\nAfter all the above environment checks are performed, the AZORult payload (MD5 hash: 38360115294c49538ab15b5ec3037a77) is\ninjected using the process hollowing technique in a new instance of the main process.\n\nWe will not describe the details of the functionality of AZORult information stealer since it is already well-documented in the public\ndomain.\n\nIt is important to note that based on the flow of the code execution and the anti-analysis techniques used, the .NET packed payload\nappears to be created using the CyaX packer. More details about this packer can be found here.\n\n## Network communication\n\nThe final unpacked payload, AZORult, will perform information stealing activities on the machine and exfiltrate the information by\nsending an HTTP POST request to the URL: hxxp://crevisoft.net/images/backgrounds/ob/index.php\n\nUpon inspection, we discovered that opendir was enabled on the C&C server as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: Opendir enabled on the C&C server._\n\nThe AZORult panel on the C&C server can be accessed at the URL: hxxp://crevisoft.net/images/backgrounds/ob/panel/admin.php.\n\n_Figure 14: The AZORult panel_\n\n## PHP mailer script\n\nAmong other artifacts we discovered on the C&C server, we found a PHP mailing script deployed\nat hxxp://crevisoft[.]net/images/-/leaf.php.\n\nThis enables the threat actor to send emails using the C&C server’s SMTP.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: The PHP mailing script on the C&C server._\n\n## Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection\n\nFigure 16 shows the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox successfully detecting this .NET-based threat.\n\n_Figure 16: Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection._\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levels, as seen here:\n\n[Win32.PWS.Azorult](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.PWS.Azorult)\n\n[Win64.PWS.Azorult](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win64.PWS.Azorult)\n\n[PDF.Downloader.Azorult](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=PDF.Downloader.Azorult)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThis threat actor is targeting employees in the supply chain industries in Oil and Gas sector in the middle east region. As always,\nusers should be cautious when receiving emails out of the blue, even if those emails appear to be related to something you are\ninterested in, such as a legal tender for a project which might appear relevant. And always be wary of links embedded inside file\nformats such as PDF since these links could lead to download of malicious files on your system.\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others, to help keep our customers safe.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping\n\n**ID** **Tactic** **Technique**\n\nT1566.001 Spearphishing Attachment Uses PDF attachments containing malicious URLs\n\nT1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File User opens pdf file.
