It’s certainly true that Linux hasn’t faced the\ndeluge of viruses, worms and Trojans faced by those running Windows systems over the\nyears. However, there is certainly malware for Linux – including PHP backdoors, rootkits and\nexploit code. Moreover, numbers can be misleading. The strategic importance of servers\nrunning Linux makes them an attractive target for attackers of all kinds. If an attacker is able\nto compromise a server running Linux, they not only gain access to data stored on the server\nbut can also target endpoints connected to it running Windows or macOS – for example,\nthrough a drive-by download. Furthermore, Linux computers are more likely to be left\nunprotected, so that such a compromise might well go unnoticed. When the Heartbleed and\n\n\n-----\n\n[Shellshock vulnerabilities were first reported in 2014, two major concerns were that](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-a-linux-bug-may-affect-windows-based-infrastructure/15017/)\ncompromised Linux servers could become an attacker’s gateway into a corporate network\nand could give an attacker access to sensitive corporate data.\n\nThe Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky publishes regular\nsummaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, based on the threat intelligence\nresearch discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports. In this report, we focus on the\ntargeting of Linux resources by APT threat actors.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\ninformation on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.\n\n## Barium\n\nWe first wrote about the [Winnti APT group (aka APT41 or Barium) in 2013, when they were](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\ntargeting mostly gaming companies for direct financial profit. Meanwhile, they grew their\noperations, developed tons of new tools and went for much more complex targets.\nMESSAGETAP is Linux malware used by this group to selectively intercept SMS messages\nfrom the infrastructure of telecoms operators. According to FireEye, the group deployed this\n[malware on SMS gateway systems as part of its operations to infiltrate ISPs and telecoms](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/messagetap-who-is-reading-your-text-messages.html)\ncompanies in order to build a surveillance grid.\n\nRecently, we discovered another suspected Barium/APT41 tool, written in the programming\nlanguage Go (also known as Golang) that implements a dynamic, C2-controlled packet\ncorruption/network attack tool for Linux machines. Although it’s not 100% clear if this is a tool\ndeveloped for system administration tasks or if it is also part of the APT41 toolset, the fact\nthat the functionality it offers can also be achieved through other system management tools\nsuggests that its purpose may not be legitimate. Also, its name on disk is rather generic and\nis unrelated to its functionality, again suggesting that it is potentially a covert tool used for\ncarrying out certain types of destructive attacks. More details about this tool can be found in\nour private report “Suspected Barium network control tool in GO for Linux”.\n\n## Cloud Snooper\n\nIn February 2020, Sophos published a report describing a set of malicious tools it attributes\n[to a previously unknown threat actor called Cloud Snooper. The centerpiece is a server-](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophoslabs-cloud-snooper-report.pdf)\noriented Linux kernel rootkit that hooks netfilter traffic control functions in order to enable\nfirewall-traversing covert C2 (command-and-control) communications. We analyzed and\ndescribed the rootkit’s userland companion backdoor, dubbed ‘Snoopy’, and were able to\ndesign detection and scanning methods to identify the rootkit at scale. We also discovered\nmore samples, as well as targeted servers in Asia. We believe that this evolved toolset might\nhave been in development since at least 2016.\n\n## Equation\n\n\n-----\n\n[We uncovered the Equation group in 2015. This is a highly sophisticated threat actor that](https://securelist.com/?s=equation)\nhas been engaged in multiple CNE (computer network exploitation) operations dating back to\n2001, and perhaps as early as 1996. For many years this threat actor interacted or worked\ntogether with other powerful APT groups, for projects such as Stuxnet and Flame. The group\nhas a powerful arsenal of implants. Among those we found were: ‘EQUATIONLASER’,\n‘EQUATIONDRUG’, ‘DOUBLEFANTASY’, ‘TRIPLEFANTASY’, ‘FANNY’ and ‘GRAYFISH’.\nThe innovations of the Equation group aren’t limited to the Windows platform. The group’s\nPOSIX-compliant codebase allows for parallel developments on other platforms. In 2015, we\ncame by the early-stage DOUBLEFANTASY malware for Linux. This implant collects system\ninformation and credentials and provides generic access to an infected computer. Given the\nrole this module plays in the infection lifecycle, it would suggest the presence of analogous\nlater-stage, more sophisticated implants, although we weren’t able to find any.\n\n\n-----\n\n## HackingTeam\n\n[HackingTeam was an Italian information technology company that developed and sold](https://securelist.com/spyware-hackingteam/37064/)\nintrusion and so called “legal surveillance software” to governments, law enforcement\nagencies and businesses around the world. Unfortunately for them, they were hacked and\nsuffered a data breach in 2015, at the hands of the activist known as Phineas Phisher. The\nsubsequent leak of 400GB of stolen company data, including source code and customer\ninformation, allowed these tools to be acquired, adapted and used by threat actors around\nthe world, such as DancingSalome (aka Callisto). The leaked tools included a zero-day\nexploit for Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-5119) as well as sophisticated platforms capable of\nproviding remote access, keylogging, general information recording and exfiltration, and\nperhaps most notably, the ability to retrieve Skype audio and video frames directly from\n\n\n-----\n\nmemory, bypassing stream encryption. The RCS (Remote Control System) malware (aka\nGalileo, Da Vinci, Korablin, Morcut and Crisis) includes multiple components, including\ndesktop agents for Windows, macOS and perhaps unsurprisingly… Linux.\n\n## Lazarus\n\nIn late 2018, we discovered a previously unknown malicious framework that we named\n[MATA internally. This framework was used to target commercial companies in Korea, India,](https://securelist.com/mata-multi-platform-targeted-malware-framework/97746/)\nGermany and Poland. While we weren’t able to find code overlaps with any other known\nactor, the Kaspersky Threat Attribution engine showed code similarities with Manuscrypt,\ncomplex malware used by Lazarus (aka Hidden Cobra). This framework, as with earlier\nmalware developed by Lazarus, included a Windows backdoor. However, we also found a\nLinux variant that we believe was designed for networking devices.\n\n[In June 2020, we analyzed new macOS samples linked to Lazarus Operation](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus-sequel/95596/) [AppleJeus and](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus-sequel/95596/)\nTangoDaiwbo campaigns, used in financial and espionage attacks. The samples had been\nuploaded to VirusTotal. The uploaded files also included a Linux malware variant that\nincluded similar functionality to the macOS TangoDaiwbo malware. These samples confirm a\ndevelopment that we had highlighted two years earlier – that the group was actively\ndeveloping non-Windows malware.\n\n## Sofacy\n\n[Sofacy (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Sednit and Tsar Team) is a highly active and](https://securelist.com/sofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset/72924/)\nprolific APT threat actor. From its high-volume zero-day deployment to its innovative, broad\nmalware set, Sofacy is one of the top groups that we monitor. Among the tools in the group’s\narsenal is SPLM (also known as CHOPSTICK and XAgent), a second-stage tool used\nselectively against targets around the world. Over the years, Sofacy has developed modules\nfor several platforms, including, in 2016, modules for Linux, detected as ‘Fysbis’. The\nconsistent artefacts seen over the years and across Windows, macOS, iOS and Linux\nsuggests that the same developers, or a small core team, is modifying and maintaining the\ncode.\n\n## The Dukes\n\nThe [Dukes is a sophisticated threat actor that was first documented by us in 2013, but whose](https://securelist.com/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/31112/)\ntools have been used in attacks dating back to 2008. The group is responsible for attacks\nagainst targets in Chechnya, Ukraine, Georgia, as well as western governments and NGOs,\nNATO and individuals – the group is thought to be behind the hack of the Democratic\nNational Congress in 2016. The Dukes’ toolset includes a comprehensive set of malware\nimplementing similar functionality but coded in several different programming languages. The\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup s malware and campaigns include PinchDuke, GeminiDuke, CosmicDuke, MiniDuke,\nCozyDuke, OnionDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke and CloudDuke. At least one of these,\nSeaDuke, includes a Linux variant.\n\n## The Lamberts\n\nThe Lamberts is a highly sophisticated threat actor group which is known to possess a huge\nmalware arsenal, including passive, network-driven backdoors, several generations of\nmodular backdoors, harvesting tools and wipers for carrying out destructive attacks. We\ncreated a color scheme to distinguish the various tools and implants used against different\nvictims around the world.\n\n**_Lamberts discovery timeline_**\n\n[In 2017, we published an overview of the Lamberts family; and further updates](https://securelist.com/unraveling-the-lamberts-toolkit/77990/)\n(GoldLambert, SilverLambert, RedLambert, BrownLambert) are available to customers of our\n[threat intelligence reports. The focus of the various Lamberts variants is definitely Windows.](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/apt-intelligence-reporting)\nNevertheless, signatures that we created for Green Lambert for Windows also triggered on a\nmacOS variant of Green Lambert that was functionally similar to the Windows version. In\naddition, we also identified samples of the SilverLambert backdoor compiled for both\nWindows and Linux.\n\n## Tsunami backdoor\n\nTsunami (aka Kaiten) is a UNIX backdoor used by multiple threat actors since it was first\nseen in the wild in 2002. The source code was made public some years ago; and there are\nnow more than 70 variants. The source code compiles smoothly on a wide range of\nembedded devices; and there are versions for ARM, MIPS, Sparc and Cisco 4500/PowerPC.\nTsunami remains a threat for Linux-based routers, DVRs and the increasing number of IoT\n[(internet of things) devices. In 2016, a variant of Tsunami was used in the Linux Mint hack,](https://securelist.com/beware-of-backdoored-linux-mint-isos/73893/)\nwhere an unknown threat actor compromised the Linux Mint distribution ISOs to include a\nbackdoor. We also observed the use of the Tsunami backdoor to surgically target a number\nof cryptocurrency users on Linux.\n\n## Turla\n\nTurla (aka Uroboros, Venomous Bear and Waterbug) is a prolific Russian-speaking group\n[known for its covert exfiltration tactics such as the use of hijacked satellite connections,](https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/)\n[water-holing of government websites, covert channel backdoors, rootkits and deception](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[tactics. This threat actor, like other APT groups, has made significant changes to its toolset](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07184135/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf)\nover the years. Until 2014, every malware sample used by Turla that we had seen was\ndesigned for 32- or 64-bit versions of Windows.\n\n[Then in December 2014, we published our report on Penguin Turla, a Linux component in](https://securelist.com/the-penquin-turla-2/67962/)\nthe Turla arsenal. This is a stealth backdoor that didn’t require elevated privileges, i.e.\nadministrator or root rights. Even if someone with limited access to the system launches it,\nthe backdoor can intercept incoming packets and run commands from the attackers on the\nsystem while maintaining stealth. It is also rather hard to uncover, so if it’s installed on a\ncompromised server, it could sit there unnoticed for a long time. Further research on Penguin\n[Turla revealed that its roots stretch back to the Moonlight Maze operation in the mid-1990s.](https://securelist.com/penquins-moonlit-maze/77883/)\n[In May this year, researchers from Leonardo published a report about Penguin_x64, a](https://www.leonardocompany.com/documents/20142/10868623/Malware+Technical+Insight+_Turla+%E2%80%9CPenquin_x64%E2%80%9D.pdf/541d279e-a827-38b4-99e8-3c23553cd66a)\npreviously undocumented variant of the Penguin Turla Linux backdoor. Based on this report,\nwe generated network probes that detect Penquin_x64 infected hosts at scale, allowing us to\ndiscover a couple dozen infected servers in Europe and the US, as recent as July 2020. We\nbelieve that, following public documentation of GNU/Linux tools, Turla may have been\nrepurposing Penguin to conduct operations other than traditional intelligence gathering.\n\n## Two-Sail Junk\n\n\n-----\n\nIn January 2020, a watering hole was discovered that utilized a full remote iOS exploit chain\nto deploy a feature-rich implant named LightSpy. The site appears to have been designed to\ntarget users in Hong Kong, based on the content of the landing page. For the time being,\nuntil we can link the campaign to a known group, we have given the name Two-Sail Junk to\n[the threat actor behind this implant. However, while our public report focused on the iOS](https://securelist.com/ios-exploit-chain-deploys-lightspy-malware/96407/)\nimplant, the project is broader than previously thought, supporting an Android implant, and\nprobably supporting implants for Windows, Linux and MacOS.\n\n## WellMess\n\nIn March 2020, we began to actively track new C2 servers associated with malware\ncommonly referred to as WellMess, indicating a potentially massive new wave of activity.\n[This malware was initially documented by JPCERT in July 2018 and has been sporadically](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html)\nactive since then. There were rumors that hint at a possible connection with CozyDuke (aka\nAPT29), along with speculation that the current activity was focused on the healthcare\nindustry, although we were unable to verify either claim. WellMess is a Remote Access\nTrojan, written in .NET and Go (Golang), cross-compiled to be compatible with both Windows\nand Linux.\n\n## WildNeutron\n\nWe [first published about WildNeutron in 2015, together with our colleagues from Symantec,](https://securelist.com/wild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks/71275/)\nwho call it Morpho or Butterfly. This group, which rose to prominence with their 2012-2013\nattacks on Twitter, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, are one of the most elusive, mysterious\nand dynamic we have seen. Their arsenal included many interesting and innovative tools,\nsuch as LSA backdoors or IIS plugins, coupled with both zero-day-based and physical\ndeployment. Unsurprisingly, in several known attacks WildNeutron used a custom Linux\nbackdoor as well.\n\n## Zebrocy\n\nZebrocy is custom malware that we have been tracking since 2015. The group using this\nmalware started as a subset of Sofacy, but also has similarities and overlaps with other APT\ngroups. The group has developed malware in several languages, including Delphi, AutoIT,\n.NET, C#, PowerShell and Go. Zebrocy has mainly targeted Central Asian governmentrelated organizations, both in-country and in remote locations. The group makes extensive\nuse of spear phishing to compromise Windows endpoints. However, its backdoors are\nconfigured to communicate directly with IP-assigned web server hosts over port 80; and the\ngroup seems to favor Linux for this part of its infrastructure – specifically, Apache 2.4.10\nrunning on Debian Linux.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recommendations for protecting Linux systems\n\nOne of the main reasons that Linux systems go unprotected is a false sense of security from\nusing Linux instead of the far more popular (and more targeted) Windows. Nevertheless, we\nhope all the aforementioned points are convincing enough for you to start securing your\nLinux-based machines in a serious way.\n\nThe very first recommendation is to maintain a list of trusted sources of your software.\nThink about this in the same way as the recommended approach to Android or iOS apps –\nonly installing applications from official repositories. In the Linux world we enjoy more\nfreedom: for example, even if you are using Ubuntu, you’re not restricted only to Canonical’s\nown repository. Any .DEB file, or even application source code from GitHub, is at your\nservice. But please choose these sources wisely. Don’t just blindly follow instructions like\n“Run this script from our server to install”; or “curl https://install-url | sudo bash” – which is a\nsecurity nightmare.\n\nPlease also be mindful of the secure way to get applications from these trusted\nrepositories. Your channels to update the apps have to be encrypted using HTTPS or SSH\nprotocols. Besides your trust in software sources and its delivery channel, it’s critical for\n**updates to arrive in a timely fashion. Most modern Linux flavors are able to do this for**\nyou, but a simple cron script would help you to stay more protected and to get all the patches\nas soon as they are released by developers.\n\nThe next thing we would recommend is checking network-related settings. With commands\nlike “netstat -a” you could filter out all unnecessary opened ports on your host. Please\navoid network applications you really don’t need or don’t use to minimize your network\n\n\n-----\n\nfootprint. Also, it would be strongly recommended to properly set up the firewall from your\nLinux distributive, to filter traffic and store the host’s network activity. It’s also a very good\nidea not to go online directly, but through NAT.\n\nTo continue with the network-related security rules, we recommend protecting your locally\n**stored SSH keys (used for your network services) using passwords at least. In more**\n“paranoid” mode you could even store the keys on external protected storage, like tokens\nfrom any trusted vendor. On the server side of connections, nowadays it’s not that hard to\n**set up multi-factor authentication for SSH sessions, like the messages to your phone or**\nother mechanisms such as authenticator apps.\n\nSo far, our recommendations have covered software sources, application delivery channel,\navoiding unnecessary network footprint and protection of encryption keys. One more idea we\nrecommend for monitoring threats you couldn’t find at the filesystem level is to keep and\n**analyze the network activity logs. You could install and use an out-of-band network tap to**\nindependently monitor and analyze the network communications of your Linux systems.\n\nAs part of your threat model, you need to consider the possibility that, despite all the\naforementioned measures, attackers can compromise your protection. Think about the next\nprotection step in terms of an attacker’s persistence in the system. They will probably make\nchanges to be able to start their Trojan automatically after the system reboots. So, you need\nto regularly monitor the main configuration files as well as the integrity of system\n**binaries, just in case of file viruses. The logs mentioned above for monitoring network**\ncommunication, is fully applicable here: the Linux auditing system collects system calls\n**and file access records. Additional daemons such as “osquery” can be used for the same**\ntask. . Any suspicious files, URLs, and IP addresses can be checked at Kaspersky Threat\nIntelligence Portal.\n\nPhysical security of devices is also important. It doesn’t matter how much attention you pay\nto network and system level hardening if your laptop ends up in an attacker’s hands and you\nhaven’t taken steps to protect it from this attack vector. You should consider full disk\n**encryption and safe boot mechanisms for physical security. A more spy-like approach**\nwould be to place tamper-evident security tape on your most critical hardware.\n\n[Dedicated solution with Linux security can simplify the protection task: web threat protection](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/endpoint)\ndetects malicious and phishing websites; network threat protection detects network attacks in\nincoming traffic; behavior analysis detects malicious activity, while device control allows\nmanagement of connected devices and access to them.\n\nOur final recommendation relates to Docker. This is not a theoretical threat: infection of\n[containers is a very real issue. Containerization doesn’t provide security by itself. Some](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-linux-malware-uses-dogecoin-api-to-find-c-c-server-addresses/?amp=1)\ncontainers are quite isolated from the host, but not all – network and file system interfaces\n**exist in them and in most cases there are bridges between physical and containerized**\nworlds.\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore, you can use security solution that allows to add security into development\nprocess. [Kaspersky Hybrid Cloud Security includes integration with CI/CD platforms, such as](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/devops-security)\nJenkins, through a script to scan Docker images for malicious elements at different stages.\n\nTo prevent supply-chain attacks, On-Access Scanning (OAS) and On-Demand Scanning\n(ODS) of containers, images, and local and remote repositories can be used. Namespace\nmonitoring, flexible mask-based scan scope control and the ability to scan different layers of\ncontainers help to enforce secure development best practices.\n\nWe have broken down this list of recommendations into logical sections. Please bear in mind\nthat, besides applying all the measures we have mentioned, you should also audit and check\nall the generated logs and any other messages regularly. Otherwise you could miss signs of\nintrusion. A final idea, for security enthusiasts, is to adopt active measures – to provide\nsystem penetration testing from time to time.\n\n### Summary of recommendations:\n\nMaintain a list of trusted software sources, avoid using unencrypted update channels.\nDo not run binaries and scripts from untrusted sources. A widely advertised way to\n[install programs with commands like “curl https://install-url | sudo bash” is a security](http://install-url/)\nnightmare.\nMake sure your update procedure is effective. Set up automatic security updates.\nSpend time to set up your firewall properly: make sure it logs network activity, block all\nports you don’t use, minimize your network footprint.\nUse key-based SSH authentication, protect keys with passwords.\nUse 2FA and store sensitive keys on external token devices (e.g. Yubikey).\nUse an out-of-band network tap to independently monitor and analyze network\ncommunications of your Linux systems.\nMaintain system executable file integrity. Review configuration file changes regularly.\nBe prepared for insider/physical attacks: use full disk encryption, trusted/safe boot and\nput tamper-evident security tape on your critical hardware.\nAudit the system, check logs for indicators of attacks.\nRun penetration tests on your Linux setup.\nUse a dedicated security solution for Linux with web and network protection, as well as\nfeatures for DevOps protection.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Linux](https://securelist.com/tag/linux/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\nGReAT\n\nAn overview of targeted attacks and APTs on Linux\n\nYour email address will not be published.
