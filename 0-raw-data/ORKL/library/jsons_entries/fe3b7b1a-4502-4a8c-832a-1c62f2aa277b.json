Hupigon\nhas been anecdotally associated with state-sponsored APT threat actors among others.\nProofpoint researchers have recently discovered a large volume Hupigon campaign primarily\ntargeting both faculty and students at United States colleges and universities.\n\nMessages arrive obfuscated as adult dating lures requesting the user to choose between\none of two pictures to connect with by clicking the link under their picture as shown in Figure\n1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Adult Dating Lure\n\nIf the recipient clicks either link, an executable download begins.\n\nFigure 2 Hupigon Download\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the recipient runs the file in the download, Hupigon is then installed on their system. In\nFigure 3 you can see the traffic upon clicking the malicious link leading to the download of\nthe compressed executable.\n\nFigure 3 Downloading the Hupigon Executable\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the volumes of this campaign unfolding between April 13, 2020 and April\n17, 2020.\n\nFigure 4 Hupigon Adult Dating Campaign Volume\n\nBetween the April 14, 2020 and April 15, 2020, message volumes reached approximately\n80,000 messages, coinciding with an observed rotation in payload, exemplified below:\n\n\n**Date**\n**Used**\n\nApril 14,\n2020\n\n\n**SHA256**\n\n8e2f624f7bf79f35951fa8a434537caa7d82dfbdf0bcd97461f879c43eece7fa\n\n\n-----\n\nApril 15\n2020\n\n\n373c7986a56ee7b428757ac7862676a6b5bbaaa1aee4122747fce5680ae024ff\n\n\nThis campaign delivered over 150,000 messages to over 60 different industries, with 45%\nfocused on education, colleges, and universities.\n\n[Hupigon has many features and capabilities. It allows actors to access the infected machine,](https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/backdoor_w32_hupigon.shtml)\nhas rootkit functionality, webcam monitoring, and the ability to log keystrokes and steal\npasswords.\n\nThe payload makes a DNS request to eth[.]ceo located at 142.54.162[.]66 for the initial\ncommand and control communication. In addition, another domain was discovered on the IP\naddress - ‘ooeth[.]com’. Interesting to note the domain used for delivery\n‘down.gogominer[.]com’ is hosted on the same address space as the C2 ‘142.54.162[.]67’.\n\nProofpoint associates Hupigon with historic APT campaigns based on the language of the\nbuilder, open source breach reporting, and multiple reports of similar APT actor behaviors\nbetween 2010 and 2012.\n\nIn this case, cybercriminals repurposed a nearly 15-year-old attack tool leveraged by statesponsored threat actors among others. We believe this campaign is crimeware motivated.\nThis judgment is based on the distribution methods and message volumes referenced in\nFigure 4 as well as other technical associations that we observed.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nPayload 8e2f624f7bf79f35951fa8a434537caa7d82dfbdf0bcd97461f879c43eece7fa\n\nPayload 373c7986a56ee7b428757ac7862676a6b5bbaaa1aee4122747fce5680ae024ff\n\nC2 142.54.162[.]66\n\nC2 eth[.]ceo\n\nDNS ooeth[.]com\n\n\nDelivery\nDomain\n\n\ndown.gogominer[.]com\n\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
