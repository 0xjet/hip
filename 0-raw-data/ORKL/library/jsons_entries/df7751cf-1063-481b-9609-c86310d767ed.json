Over the\nlast two years, many attackers have evolved their ransomware tactics to include data\n[exfiltration. This tactic is known as \"double-extortion\": attackers demand ransom for the](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-double-extortion-ransomware)\ndata decryption in addition to the ransom to prevent public release of the stolen data.\nThreatLabz monitors these threat actors and analyzes the attack sequences of double\nextortion attacks. AtomSilo is a new player on the scene, and in this blog, we'll break down\nthe details of their attacks.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAtomSilo ransomware emerged around September 2021, with their tactics including\nexfiltrating and publishing their first victim's data.\n\nWe'll break down one of their attacks, which started with initial access through exploiting a\n[vulnerability in Atlassian’s Confluence collaboration software. The ransomware operators](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/10/04/atom-silo-ransomware-actors-use-confluence-exploit-dll-side-load-for-stealthy-attack/)\nplanted a back door using legitimate software via a dll side loading technique. The backdoor\nallowed remote code execution of Windows Shell commands through WMI (Windows\nManagement Interface), which operators exploited using compromised administrative\naccounts before dropping AtomSilo.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nThe AtomSilo payload is 64-bit and packed with a modified UPX packer. Once executed, it\nenumerates each drive and drops a ransom note in each folder except the few listed in\n_Table1. The ransom note is named “README-FILE-{COMPUTER_Name}-{DateTime}.hta”._\n\n_Figure 1: AtomSilo ransom note_\n\nIt enumerates each file and encrypts all folders and files EXCEPT those that contain the\nbelow names:\n\n**Folder name** **File name**\n\nBoot autorun.inf\n\nWindows index.html\n\nWindows.old boot.ini\n\nTor Browser bootfont.bin\n\nInternet Explorer bootsect.bak\n\nGoogle bootmgr\n\n\n-----\n\n**Folder name** **File name**\n\nOpera bootmgr.efi\n\nOpera Software bootmgfw.efi\n\nMozilla desktop.ini\n\nMozilla Firefox iconcache.db\n\n$recycle.Bin ntldr\n\nProgramData ntuser.dat\n\nAll Users ntuser.dat.log\n\n#recycle\n\nthumbs.db\n\nntuser.ini\n\n_Table1: List of files and folders_\n\nIt also does not encrypt files with the following extensions:\n\n.hta .idx\n\n.hlp .ini\n\n.html .sys\n\n.icl .cab\n\n.exe .spl\n\n.icns .cur\n\n.dll .ocx\n\n.ico .cpl\n\n.cpl .drv\n\n_Table2: List of extensions_\n\n### File Encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware appends .atomsilo extensions to files after encryption. Ransomware uses\n“CreateFileMappingA” and “MapViewOfFile” APIs to map the file in memory and moves the\npointer to the start of the mapped file. AtomSilo uses XOR and AES Encryption algorithms\nto encrypt files. It generates AES round keys using the “AESKEYGENASSIST” instruction\nas shown in the below figure.\n\n_Figure 2: AtomSilo generates encryption keys using AESKEYGENASSIST_\n\nThe encryption key is 240 bytes. The first 32 bytes are randomly generated by the payload,\nand other 208 bytes are generated using the “AESKEYGENASSIST” instruction. In the file,\nit takes 16 bytes of plain text and does XOR as a first stage encryption. Then, it encrypts it\nwith 14 rounds of AES encryption. It uses “AESENC” instruction for the first 13 rounds and\nthe last round uses “AESENCLAST” instruction.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Encrypting data using AES algorithm_\n\nIt encrypts chunks of the file, not the complete file. It encrypts the first 16 bytes, leaves the\nnext 32 bytes as-is, encrypts the next 16 bytes, and so on. The below screenshot shows the\ncomparison of the normal file and encrypted file, where we can see that chunks of files are\nnot encrypted. The encryption key and other information are encrypted and appended at the\nend of the encrypted file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Original vs Encrypted file_\n\n### Data Leak site\n\nAccording to their leak sites, AtomSilo actors won't attack the following types of\norganizations:\n\nHospitals.\nCritical infrastructure facilities (nuclear power plants, power plants, water treatment\nfacilities).\nOil and gas industry (pipelines, oil refineries).\nEducational unit.\nNon-profit companies.\n\nThey also promise to provide free decryption if the victim company is on the above list.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Data leak site_\n\nThe first data leak was from a Brazilian Pharmaceutical company. AtomSilo published\naround 900 GB data as shown in the below screenshot:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Victim data published on data leak site_\n\n## Cloud Sandbox Detection\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection of AtomSilo ransomware_\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects\nindicators at various levels.\n\n[Win64.Ransom.AtomSilo](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?threatname=win64.ransom.atomsilo)\n\n## IOC\n\n**Md5**\n\n04a8307259478245cbae49940b6d655a\n\n\n-----",
