The announcement was](https://www.airindia.in/images/pdf/Data-Breach-Notification.pdf)\npreceded by data breaches in various airline companies, including Singapore Airlines and\n**Malaysia Airlines. According to the public source data, these airlines use services of the**\nsame IT service provider. The media [suggested the airline industry was facing \"a coordinated](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/sita-supply-chain-breach-hits/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_22d96108ea7a7a023a70a6e1ae2d307113653a31-1626767310-0-gqNtZGzNAfijcnBszQp6)\nsupply chain attack\". Air India was the first carrier to reveal more details about its security\nbreach.\n\nThe data revealed by Air India suggested that the massive data breach that affected multiple\ncarriers was a result of the compromise of the airline's IT service provider. That\nannouncement prompted Group-IBThreat Intelligence analysts to look closer at the attack.\n\nUsing its external threat hunting tools, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team then discovered\nand attributed another previously unknown cyberattack on Air India with moderate\nconfidence to the Chinese nation-state threat actor known as APT41. The campaign was\ncodenamed ColunmTK.\n\n**In this blog post you will find:**\n\nPreviously unknown details about the ColunmTK campaign\nEvidence of compromised workstations and exfiltration of 200 MB of data from Air\nIndia's network\nDescriptions of TTPs used during the ColunmTK campaign\n\nConnections between APT41 and the infrastructure used during the ColunmTK\ncampaign\n\nThe potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that\nmight yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant. To help companies\ndetect and hunt for ColunmTK, we have provided a full list of indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) that we retrieved. MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE Shield, and recommendations are\navailable at the end of this blog post. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team informed CERT\nIndia and Air India of its findings so that they can take the necessary steps to mitigate the\nthreat.\n\n**Background**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 21, Air India, India s flag carrier, [published an official statement on their website](https://www.airindia.in/images/pdf/Data-Breach-Notification.pdf)\nabout a data breach. The announcement revealed that the breach was caused by a February\nincident at the airline's IT service provider, which is responsible for processing customers'\npersonally identifiable information (PII). However, that statement has since been corrected. It\ncame to light that the cyberattack on this IT service provider affected 4,500,000 data subjects\nglobally, including data related to Air India's customers.\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after Air India s public announcement, the database allegedly related to their security\nbreach was put up for sale on an underground market at USD 3,000.\n\nAccording to [Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, the alleged database was](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\npublished on a fraudulent resource known for reselling data that has been published on\nvarious data-leak websites. Because the database had never surfaced anywhere on the dark\nweb, nor in the public domain, Group-IB researchers considered it fake and decided to\ninstead look deeper and discovered that the post about Air India's alleged data had nothing\nto do with what happened in reality. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team soon realized that in\nthis other attack on Air India they were dealing with a sophisticated nation-state threat actor,\nrather than another financially motivated cybercriminal group.\n\n**Compromise of Air India's network**\n\nIn mid-February 2021, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system detected infected\ndevices that were part of Air India's computer network. Starting from at least February 23,\n2021, a device inside the company's network communicated with a server with the IP\naddress 185[.]118[.]166[.]66. According to Group-IB's Network Graph, this server has hosted\nCobalt Strike, a popular post-exploitation framework, since December 11, 2020 (we will come\nback to it a little later).\n\n\n-----\n\nLifetime of a Cobalt Strike tag in Group-IB's Network Graph\n\nThe patient zero that started communicating with the C&C server was a device named\n«SITASERVER4» with the local IP address 172[.]16[.]11[.]103 and managed by AirIndia.\n\nAfter the attackers established persistence in the network and obtained passwords, they\nbegan moving laterally. The threat actor collected information inside the local network,\nincluding names of network resources and their addresses.\n\nBelow are examples of commands that were used for lateral movement:\n\nThe results of some commands:\n\nThe attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations\nusing hashdump and mimikatz. The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help\nof BadPotato malware. BadPotatoNet4.exe was uploaded to one of the devices inside the\nvictim's network under the name SecurityHealthSystray.exe. According to our data, at least\n20 devices from Air India's network were compromised during the lateral movement stage.\nThe attackers used DNS-txt requests to connect the bots to the C&C server. The following\ndomains were used for DNS tunneling.\n\nns2[.]colunm[.]tk;\n\n\n-----\n\nns1[.]colunm[.]tk.\n\nThe name of the campaign, ColunmTK, is derived from these initially discovered domains.\n\nIt was also found that the attackers extracted 233,390,032 bytes of data from the following\ndevices:\n\nSITASERVER4\nAILCCUALHSV001\nAILDELCCPOSCE01\nAILDELCCPDB01\nWEBSERVER3\n\nAccording to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution data, the compromised devices\nwere located in different subnets, which may indicate that the compromise affected various\nsegments of Air India's network. While the initial attack vector remains unknown, according\nto Group-IB's records, the attack on Air India lasted for at least 2 months and 26 days. It took\nthe attackers 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the\nairline's network.\n\nColunmTK Timeline\n\n**Connections with APT41**\n\nGroup-IB researchers believe with moderate confidence that the ColunmTK campaign was\ncarried out by APT41, a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state threat actor. APT41, also\nknown as WICKED SPIDER (PANDA), Winnti Umbrella, and BARIUM, is believed to have\n\n\n-----\n\nbeen engaging in state-sponsored espionage in China s interests as well as committing\nfinancially motivated cybercrimes. According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution\nsystem, the threat actor has been active since at least 2007.\n\nAPT41 is known for stealing digital certificates for its cyber espionage operations. India is a\n[frequent target of Chinese nation-state adversaries.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/prime/technology-and-startups/chinas-state-sponsored-hackers-are-targeting-indias-infrastructure-and-silence-may-not-be-golden-/primearticleshow/82245441.cms)\n\nWhen analyzing the network infrastructure of the C&C-server involved in the cyberattack\nagainst Air India, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system revealed that the threat\nactor used a specific SSL certificate, which was detected on five hosts only.\n\nNetwork relations between hosts with a specific fingerprint presented in Group-IB's Threat\nIntelligence & Attribution system\n\nLet's take a closer look at these five IP addresses.\n\nOne of them, 45[.]61[.]136[.]199, was attributed to APT41(aka Barium) by [Microsoft in their](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/hunting-for-barium-using-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1875913)\nrecent research.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is worth looking at another IP address from the list: 104[.]224[.]169[.]214. This IP address\nwas used as an A record for two domains: server04[.]dns04[.]com and\nservice04[.]dns04[.]com. The IP address was also used to host the Cobalt Strike framework\nand shared an SSL certificate, b3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b, with\nColunmTK's IP address 185[.]118[.]166[.]66. When analyzing the dns04[.]com subdomains,\nwe found that these domains were parked at the IP address 127.0.0.1 on the same date:\nApril 15, 2021. According to Group-IB researchers, APT41 usually parks their domains for\nsome time at 127.0.0.1 after their campaigns are over.\n\nNetwork relations between hosts parked at 127.0.0.1.\n\nSource: Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting domain is service[.]dns22[.]ml. This domain shared the SSL certificate\nb3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b with ColunmTK's IP address and was\n[parked at 127.0.0.1 on January 15, 2021. Security researchers found that the IP address](https://ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/)\n104[.]224[.]169[.]214 was used as the IP address for a shellcode loader in APT41's earlier\ncampaigns, in which the domain service[.]dns22[.]ml was also used.\n\nGroup-IB researchers discovered a file named \"Install.bat\" (SHA17185bb6f1dddca0e6b5a07b357529e2397cdee44). The file was uploaded by the attackers to\nsome of the compromised devices inside Air India's network as part of the ColunmTK\n[campaign. The file is very similar to one used by APT41 in a different campaign described by](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html)\nFireEye researchers.\n\nIn both cases, the files were used to establish persistence in the network. The files are very\nsimilar in the way they launch a DLL file as a service and create keys in the registry.\nThe contents of the file \"install.bat\" from APT41's This is Not a Test campaign:\n```\n@echo off\nset \"WORK_DIR=C:\\Windows\\System32\"\nset \"DLL_NAME=storesyncsvc.dll\"\nset \"SERVICE_NAME=StorSyncSvc\"\nset \"DISPLAY_NAME=Storage Sync Service\"\nset \"DESCRIPTION=The Storage Sync Service is the top-level resource for File Sync.
