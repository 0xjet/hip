I haven’t seen them in UK for a while now, but it looks like\nthe Kovter gang have taken advantage of the Petya outbreak to add to the mix. They have updated the nemucod ransomware version to make\nit, on first look, impossible to decrypt at this time without paying the ransom\n\n**[Update 12 July 2017: Decryptor now available Download HERE](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/https://decrypter.emsisoft.com/nemucodaes)**\n\n[Thanks to the wonderful and dedicated techs at Emsisoft. There is now a](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/http://blog.emsisoft.com/2017/07/12/nemucodaes-ransomware-removal-decrypt/) [decryptor for this ransomware. You can find a clear, easy to follow](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/https://decrypter.emsisoft.com/nemucodaes)\n[set of instructions on how to use the decryptor at Bleeping Computer](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/decrypted-emsisoft-releases-a-decryptor-for-nemucodaes-ransomware/)\n\n**Important Notice: With this Nemucod Ransomware version your files get encrypted without changing file names or file extensions. The victim**\nonly knows his or her files are definitely gone when they try to open them or see the changed desktop background and ransom message. If an\nantivirus kicks in & removes the malware files and the desktop warning which frequently happens, then the victim only knows his or her files\nare definitely gone when they try to open them.\n\nI recently came across ( off line) a couple of examples where a victim asked for help with image files they could not open. On careful\nexamination we saw their anti-malware tool had kicked in, removed ( or blocked the creation of ) the .hta file which displayed the “your Files\nare encrypted” message and the original .js file, but had not detected or removed most of the other files that actually do the encryption, so the\nvictim did not know that their problem was caused by ransomware.\n\n**Update 2 July 2017: now also using FedEx and delivering Kovter & Cerber ransomware, while the UPS continues simultaneously delivering**\nNemucod ransomware and Kovter\n\n**Update 7 July 2017: slight change to the js file in the emails that delivers the ransomware and Kovter payloads (See below)**\n\n**Update 19 July 2017: I am** [informed that for the last couple of days these are only distributing the Nemucod php Ransomware not Kovter. (](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/07/18/index.html)\nKovter is still on the compromised download sites and manually available for download, although an older well detected version). I have seen\nthis before on odd occasions when the malware bad actors are in process of adding or changing one or more of the malware downloads. I\nwould not be surprised to see a different ransomware and backdoor payload being distributed in the next few days. Especially now there is a\npublicly available decoder / decryptor so income for this gang will stop or vastly reduce with present versions.\n\n**Update 23 July 2017: a change in the ransom note see below**\n\n**Update 30 July 2017: another change in js file see below**\n\n**Update 16 August 2017: there has been a 2 week break from these, but this morning they are starting to trickle in again. see below**\n\n**Update 19 August 2017: A change in behaviour today. They have switched back to using Locky ransomware as the payload ( see below) I**\nhaven’t seen Locky ransomware delivered by these fake UPS delivery emails for over 6 months.\n\n**Update 20 August 2017: yet another change today. now a html file attachment that pretends to be a word on line word document that cannot**\nbe read in your browser so you need to download & run the plug in to make it work See below\n\n\n-----\n\na s to [c ae G esp e a](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/https://twitter.com/demonslay335) e o a t a so a e ca pa g e o s ass sta ce a d po t g e t e g t d ect o about t e e\n[nemucod ransomware version.

The victim only knows his or her files are definitely gone when they try to open them or see the\nchanged desktop background and ransom message.\n\n[And this video also created by the same researcher with the](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/https://twitter.com/GrujaRS) newly updated version of the js file ( 7 July 2017 ). This video shows word being\nopened but no doc appearing, just garbled plain txt. while all the action happens in the background while your attention is on the fake word\ndoc. It clearly shows the encryption happening before the hta file that creates and displays the ransom note is dropped and the desktop\nchanged and ransom notes created.\n\nWe have been hearing about some antiviruses block .hta file creation or delete them as soon as they are created before they can display the\nransom note. But not recognize or block the actual .js file and the subsequent php files from running, so allow the ransomware to work.\nBecause there is no displayed note or background change the victim doesn’t realise their files have been encrypted until they go to use them.\n\nbut there is a difference in the .js files that are coming in the zips.\n\nThe initial js looks very similar to previous but has much longer vars ( var zemk) that is used to download the other files. This file looks like\n\n\n-----\n\nas usual you take the first site name in var x and add /counter/? and then var zemk to get the counter.js. these download counter.js. ( if the\nfirst site is not responding, it moves on to the other sites in the list). The first smaller counter.js is downloaded when you use internet explorer\nto download it or an IE user agent in Wget. The second larger counter.js is only delivered when the js from the email is allowed to download it,\nor you use a “null” user agent via browser or wget or use Chrome or Firefox browser.\n\nthe small one looks like\n\nThe downloaded counter needs to be deobfuscated by using the specific var ruxk in the original js file not the var zemk as in previous versions\ngiving\n\n\n-----\n\nThe larger counter (1) which is a transformed to the ( drops the embedded) php file ( only a part shown in screenshot)\n\nwhich is decoded using the same vars as in earlier example to\n\n\n-----\n\nc tu eeds u t e decod g to a e a o g p p e t at actua y does t e e c ypt o, c decoded us g t e o e p p\n[decoding service http://www.unphp.net/decode/519e3ad90af1d2854b014a259e079e98/ giving something more readable to humans](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/http://www.unphp.net/decode/519e3ad90af1d2854b014a259e079e98/)\n\n[Where I am told the relevant part for our purposes is:](http://web.archive.org/web/20181007211751/https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/880173903506755584)\n\nShowing a high level of encryption that at this time appears unable to be decrypted without paying the ransom.\n\nThis ransom note ( or something similar with different links gets displayed on the victim’s desktop\n\nThe original js downloads 4 files via the counter file1 is Kovter as usual, the second is unknown and there is a massive 6.7mb php\ninterpreter.
