To Solve Analytic Problems\n\n\n\n###### • Activity grouping is used to solve a number of problems.\n • These problems generally require deduction and inference based on a common set of features (i.e., feature vector).\n • These problems are generally distinct enough to require a different feature vector for each problem.\n • For instance, the feature vector which would group events and threads by likely adversary (e.g., attribution) would not always suffice to group events to discover common malware authors/developers\n\n\n\n- Trending: How has an adversary’s activity\nchanged over time and what is the current vector\nto infer future change?\n\n- Intent Deduction: What is the intent of the\nadversary?\n\n- Attribution Deduction: Which events and\nthreads are likely conducted by the same\nadversary?\n\n- Adversary Capabilities and Infrastructure:\nWhat is the complete set of observed capabilities\nand infrastructure of the adversary?\n\n- Cross-Capability Identification: Which\ncapabilities have been used by multiple\nadversaries?\n\n- Adversary Campaign Knowledge Gap\nIdentification: What are the organization’s\n\n\n\n                       -
