    "plain_text": "# New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)**\n\nIonut Ilascu\n\nBy\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nApril 28, 2022\n07:45 AM\n0\n\nA newly discovered malware loader called Bumblebee is likely the latest development of the\nConti syndicate, designed to replace the BazarLoader backdoor used to deliver\nransomware payloads.\n\nThe emergence of Bumblebee in phishing campaigns in March coincides with a drop in\nusing BazarLoader for delivering file-encrypting malware, researchers say.\n\nBazarLoader is the work of the TrickBot botnet developers, who provided access to victim\nnetworks for ransomware attacks. The TrickBot gang is now working for the Conti\nsyndicate.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a report in March on a threat actor tracked as Exotic Lily that provided initial access for\n[Conti and Diavol ransomware operations, Google's Threat Analysis Group says that the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-cybercrime-group-linked-to-new-diavol-ransomware/)\nactor [started to drop Bumblebee, instead of the regular BazarLoader malware, to deliver](http://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\nCobalt Strike.\n\n## Bumblebee delivery methods\n\n[Eli Salem, lead threat hunter and malware reverse engineer at Cybereason says that the](https://twitter.com/elisalem9/)\ndeployment techniques for Bumblebee are the same as for BazarLoader and IcedID, both\nseen in the past deploying Conti ransomware.\n\nProofpoint confirms Salem’s finding, saying that they’ve observed phishing campaigns\nwhere “Bumblebee [was] used by multiple crimeware threat actors previously observed\ndelivering BazaLoader and IcedID.”\n\n\"Threat actors using Bumblebee are associated with malware payloads that have been\nlinked to follow-on ransomware campaigns\" - Proofpoint\n\nThe company also notes that “several threat actors that typically use BazaLoader in\nmalware campaigns have transitioned to Bumblebee” to drop shellcode and the Cobalt\nStrike, Sliver, and Meterpreter frameworks designed for red team security assessment.\n\nAt the same time, BazaLoader has been missing from Proofpoint's data since February.\n\nIn a report today, [Proofpoint says that it observed multiple email campaigns distributing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/bumblebee-is-still-transforming)\nBumblebee within ISO attachments that contained shortcut and DLL files.\n\nOne campaign leveraged a DocuSign document lure that led to a ZIP archive with a\nmalicious ISO container hosted on Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service.\n\nThe researchers say that the malicious email also included an HTML attachment that\nappeared as an email to an unpaid invoice, Proofpoint says.\n\n\n-----\n\n_source: Proofpoint_\nThe URL embedded in the HTML file used a redirect service that relies on the Prometheus\nTDS (traffic distribution service) that filters downloads based on the victim’s timezone and\ncookies. The final destination was also the malicious ISO hosted on OneDrive.\n\nProofpoint researchers attributed this campaign with high confidence to the cybercriminal\ngroup TA579. Proofpoint has tracked TA579 since August 2021. This actor frequently\ndelivered BazaLoader and IcedID in past campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nIn March, Proofpoint observed a campaign that delivered Bumblebee through contact forms\non a target’s website. The messages claimed that the website used stolen images and\nincluded a link that ultimately delivered an ISO file containing the malware.\n\nProofpoint attributes this campaign to another threat actor that the company tracks as\nTA578 since May 2020 and uses email campaigns to deliver malware like Ursnif, IcedID,\nKPOT Stealer, Buer Loader, and BazaLoader, as well as Cobalt Strike.\n\nThe researchers detected another campaign in April that hijacked email threads to deliver\nthe Bumblebee malware loader in replies to the target with an archived ISO attachment.\n\n_source: Proofpoint_\nAlthough it has not found undeniable evidence, Proofpoint believes that the threat actors\ndeploying Bumblebee are initial network access brokers working with ransomware actors.\n\n## Highly-complex malware\n\nResearchers agree that Bumblebee is a “new, highly sophisticated malware loader” that\nintegrates intricate elaborate evasion techniques and anti-analysis tricks that include\ncomplex anti-virtualization methods.\n\nIn a [technical analysis on Thursday, Eli Salem shows that Bumblebee’s authors used the](https://elis531989.medium.com/the-chronicles-of-bumblebee-the-hook-the-bee-and-the-trickbot-connection-686379311056)\n[entire anti-analysis code from the publicly available al-khaser PoC ‘malware’ application.](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser/tree/master/al-khaser)\n\nSalem’s code examination revealed that the malware searches for multiple tools for\ndynamic and static analysis, it tries to detect “any kind of virtualization environment” by\nlooking for their processes, and by checking registry keys and file paths.\n\nThe researcher notes that one of the most interesting things he found in Bumblebee’s core\nloader component is the presence of two 32/64-bit DLL files called RapportGP.dll, a name\nused by the Trusteer’s Rapport security software for protecting sensitive data like\ncredentials.\n\nIn its separate technical analysis, Proofpoint found that the Bumblebee loader supports the\nfollowing commands:\n\nShi: shellcode injection\n\n\n-----\n\nDij: DLL injection in the memory of other processes\nDex: Download executable\nSdl: uninstall loader\nIns: enable persistence via a scheduled task for a Visual Basic Script that loads\nBumblebee\n\n## Bumblebee uses TrickBot code\n\nMalware researchers at cybersecurity companies Proofpoint and Cybereason analyzed\nBumblebee and noticed similarities with the TrickBot malware in code, delivery methods,\nand dropped payloads.\n\nSalem established a connection between Bumblebee to TrickBot after seeing that both\nmalware pieces rely on the same installation mechanism for the hooks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_source:_ _[Eli Salem](https://elis531989.medium.com/the-chronicles-of-bumblebee-the-hook-the-bee-and-the-trickbot-connection-686379311056)_\nThe similarities go even further, as Bumblebee uses the same evasion technique for\nRapportGP.DLL as TrickBot for its web-inject module.\n\nAdditionally, both malware pieces try to use the LoadLibrary and get the address of the\nfunction they want to hook, the researcher found.\n\nSalem says that while there isn’t sufficient evidence to say that Bumblebee and TrickBot\nhave the same author it is plausible to assume that Bumblebee’s developer has the source\ncode for TrickBot’s web-inject module.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Rapid malware development\n\nBumblebee is actively developed, gaining new capabilities with each update. The most\nrecent one Proofpoint observed is from April 19 and it supports multiple command and\ncontrol (C2) servers.\n\n_source:_\n\n_Proofpoint_\nHowever, Proofpoint says that the most significant development is the addition of an\nencryption layer via the RC4 stream cipher for network communications, which uses a\nhardcoded key to encrypt requests and decrypt responses from the C2.\n\nAnother modification appeared on April 22 when researchers noticed that Bumblebee\nintegrated a thread that checks for common tools used by malware analysts against a\nhardcoded list.\n\n_source: Proofpoint_\nProofpoint believes that Bumblebee is a multifunctional tool that can be used for initial\naccess to victim networks to later deploy other payloads such as ransomware.\n\nSherrod DeGrippo, Vice President of Threat Research and Detection at Proofpoint, says\nthat “the malware is quite sophisticated, and demonstrates being in ongoing, active\ndevelopment introducing new methods of evading detection.”\n\n\n-----\n\n[The reports [1,](https://elis531989.medium.com/the-chronicles-of-bumblebee-the-hook-the-bee-and-the-trickbot-connection-686379311056) [2] from Cybereason s Eli Salem and Proofpoint came one day apart and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/bumblebee-is-still-transforming)\ninclude a detailed technical analysis of Bumblebee malware's most significant aspects.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[AstraLocker 2.0 infects users directly from Word attachments](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/astralocker-20-infects-users-directly-from-word-attachments/)\n\n[Google Drive now warns you of suspicious phishing, malware docs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-drive-now-warns-you-of-suspicious-phishing-malware-docs/)\n\n[Fake copyright infringement emails install LockBit ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-copyright-infringement-emails-install-lockbit-ransomware/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - June 24th 2022 - Splinter Cells](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-june-24th-2022-splinter-cells/)\n\n[BazarLoader](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bazarloader/)\n[Bumblebee](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bumblebee/)\n[Cobalt Strike](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cobalt-strike/)\n[Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/conti/)\n[ISO](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/iso/)\n[Meterpreter](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/meterpreter/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Sliver](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sliver/)\n[TrickBot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trickbot/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
