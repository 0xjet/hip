The two embedded FTP sites currently being used by the malware\nare down.\n\n## Targeting highly sensitive documents\n\nAs you can see, the targeted keywords are related to sensitive subjects for a variety of data\ncategories such as:\n\n**Banking: 'SWIFT', 'IBAN', 'balance', 'statement', 'checking', 'saving', 'routing'**\n**Finance: 'N-CSR', '10-SB', 'EDGAR', 'newswire', 'marketwired', '10-Q'**\n**Law Enforcement: 'clandestine', 'investigation', 'federal', 'bureau', 'government',**\n'security', 'victim', 'court'\n**Military: 'NATO', 'operation', 'attack', 'spy', 'radar', 'tactical', 'tank', 'submarine'**\n**Personal: 'personal', 'passport', 'Emma', 'Liam, 'Olivia, 'Noah', 'William', 'Isabella',**\n'James', 'Sophia', 'Logan'\n\nThe names in the Personal category are taken from the United States Social Security\n[Department's list of top baby names.](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/top5names.html)\n\nSome of the new search words that were added since the latest version include 'treason',\n'NATO', 'convict', 'traitor', 'embeddedspy', 'cyber', 'submarine', 'Submarinesecret',\n'contraband', 'radio', 'suspect', 'operation', and 'bribery.'\n\nBased on the targeted keywords in this malware, it looks like the attackers are looking for\nconfidential information to sell to foreign adversaries, corporations, or to be used as\nblackmail.\n\nAt this time, we do not know how this malware is being distributed and if its bundled with\nransomware attacks or used independently.\n\n[With data exfiltration becoming more common and increasingly being used by ransomware,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-will-now-publish-victims-data-if-not-paid/)\nit is important to make sure you have good security measures in place to protect your\nnetwork from compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis includes being careful of phishing emails with malicious attachments, do not make\nRemote Desktop Services publicly accessible, make sure all software and operating\nsystems are updated, and make sure to use security software and good password policies.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New Industrial Spy stolen data market promoted through cracks, adware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-industrial-spy-stolen-data-market-promoted-through-cracks-adware/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Popular Python and PHP libraries hijacked to steal AWS keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-python-and-php-libraries-hijacked-to-steal-aws-keys/)\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ryuk/)\n[Ryuk Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ryuk-stealer/)\n[Steal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/steal/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
