This comes against a backdrop of persistent\nransomware attacks, the increasing regularity of supply chain vulnerabilities and a large\n[attack surface due to sustained high levels of remote work.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/attack-surface/)\n\nAlthough these are legitimate concerns, the battle is not lost. Effective managed\ncybersecurity services that include continuous threat hunting and rapid response can provide\norganizations with an immediate injection of world-class capability to detect, disrupt and\ncontain serious hands-on-security threats at speed and at scale.\n\n## “Trusted” Entry Points Are No Match for Human Hunters\n\n[Many survey respondents (84%) predict that supply chain attacks could become one of the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/supply-chain-attacks/)\nbiggest cyber threats facing their organization. This boils down to a fear of an adversary\ngaining access through a trusted channel and going undetected. Sophisticated attacks of this\n\n\n-----\n\nnature require a mix of automation and human expertise in the form of human-based threat\nhunting. One of the strengths of threat hunting is that the ability to quickly and decisively\ndetect a threat is not contingent on the initial access vector. Whether initial access is\nachieved via a supply chain attack, a vulnerable public-facing application or another trusted\nentry point, CrowdStrike Falcon® OverWatch™ remains vigilant in hunting for postexploitation behavior that signals an interactive threat on an endpoint.\n\nOverWatch recently uncovered interactive intrusion activity that followed the unintended\ndownload of a suspected backdoored Zsh installation file. Zsh is a legitimate Unix shell and\nwas likely downloaded by the victim organization from a legitimate GitHub repository.\n\nUpon download and installation of Zsh, a binary for the remote access utility NetSupport was\nexecuted. Concurrently, the malicious installer also attempted to download additional\nbinaries and batch files from an external domain. OverWatch tracked the adversary as they\nleveraged NetSupport to execute PowerShell commands to download a malicious DLL and\nbatch file from an adversary command-and-control (C2) server and execute basic network\nreconnaissance commands. Later investigation found that the malicious DLL was modified to\ninclude VBScript that, if loaded, would have attempted to disable and add a number of folder\nexclusions to a third-party security tool.\n\nThis attempted intrusion highlights how adversaries abuse user trust in legitimate download\nlocations and exploit public edit settings on numerous GitHub repositories. Fortunately for\nthis victim organization, OverWatch’s continuous hunting quickly spotted the anomalous\n[activity based on threat hunting leads and known indicators of compromise (IOCs). Based on](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/)\nthis rapid detection, OverWatch provided the necessary context to the victim organization\nenabling them to take swift remedial action.\n\n\n-----\n\nManaged threat hunting delivers the human element that is crucial in detecting and\ndisrupting adversary activity designed to exploit trusted components in a victim environment.\nUnlike solutions based exclusively on automated technology, human hunters approach their\nanalysis with informed skepticism. OverWatch looks for behaviors that are indicative of a\nmalicious presence in an environment. While the application or user activity involved with\ninitial access might fall within parameters that technology considers normal, hunting looks at\nthe broader context to detect even the faintest traces of malicious follow-on activity.\n\n## OverWatch and Falcon Complete Combine Forces to Stop Ransomware in Its Tracks\n\nThe 2021 survey also revealed that the persistent threat of ransomware attacks remains\norganizations’ most pressing cybersecurity concern, a concern that is firmly based in their\nlived experience. Two-thirds of the organizations surveyed had fallen victim to at least one\nransomware attack in the preceding 12 months. This highlights how critical it is for\norganizations to have comprehensive security solutions in place that ensure that\nransomware attempts are met with swift and decisive action.\n\nOverWatch and CrowdStrike Falcon® Complete™ recently disrupted a ransomware attempt\nagainst a victim organization’s domain controller. An affiliate of the LockBit ransomware as a\nservice (RaaS), run by BITWISE SPIDER, targeted the domain controller by exploiting the\nZerologon vulnerability. The adversary connected to the domain controller remotely from a\nhost on the network that did not have Falcon coverage. Thanks to the Falcon platform’s rich\ntelemetry on covered workloads and OverWatch’s proactive threat hunting, the attack was\nimmediately detected. Within minutes, OverWatch identified the adversary’s presence and\nbegan investigating.\n\nHaving leveraged the exploit to obtain domain admin privileges, the adversary undertook\ninitial discovery actions and created a new domain account to facilitate persistence and\nlateral movement. In under 20 minutes, the adversary used their new domain account to\nmove laterally, via RDP, to another domain controller on the network, where they changed\nthe “administrator” account’s password. By this time, OverWatch hunters were already in\ndirect communication and coordination with Falcon Complete responders to begin stopping\nthe attack.\n\nLess than 10 minutes after the breakout, the adversary deployed and attempted to execute a\nnovel binary. Further analysis performed by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team found the\nbinary to be a variant of LockBit 2.0. Thanks to the Falcon platform’s prevention capabilities,\nthe attempted LockBit execution was prevented, ensuring that this CrowdStrike customer did\nnot become another one of BITWISE SPIDER’s many victims.\n\n**A Bit About LockBit**\n\n\n-----\n\nLockBit is developed by an adversary that CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks as BITWISE\nSPIDER, who provides their ransomware to affiliates in a RaaS model. BITWISE SPIDER\nhas recently and quickly become a significant player in the big game hunting (BGH)\nlandscape. Their dedicated leak site (DLS) has received the highest number of victims\nposted each month since July 2021 compared to other adversary DLSs due to the growing\npopularity and effectiveness of LockBit 2.0.\n\nThe Falcon platform is finely tuned to identify known malicious behaviors associated with\nransomware. Despite the novel nature of the binary used in this attempted intrusion, the\nFalcon platform anticipated and immediately prevented the unknown threat from executing\nusing a combination of artificial intelligence, behavioral detection and machine learning\nalgorithms.\n\nMeanwhile, OverWatch tracked the adversary at every turn, providing context-rich\ninformation about the adversary’s movements to Falcon Complete, whose responders\nnotified the customer and rapidly performed their response. Falcon Complete began by\nrapidly network containing the affected hosts, completely cutting off the adversary’s remote\naccess. They also disabled the domain account created by the adversary and deployed a\ncustom IOC hash block across the entire environment for the observed LockBit variant. To\nfurther assist the customer, Falcon Complete analysts delivered specific recommendations\nfor further hardening of the network, including guidance, removing the adversary-created\naccount, resetting the affected “administrator” account and fully patching the compromised\ndomain controller.\n\nThanks to the unrivaled security combination of the Falcon platform and the OverWatch,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon Complete teams, the adversary was thwarted. This\ncoordinated response effectively stopped the intrusion before the customer suffered any\nsignificant impact — protecting them against a serious eCrime threat that is growing all too\nprevalent.\n\nThe findings from last year’s survey prove that it is a matter of when, not if, an organization\nwill fall victim to an attempted ransomware attack. Yet, respondents’ self-reported estimated\ntime to detect an intrusion has increased to an average of 146 hours, or over 6 days. Having\nexpert managed services on your side makes the difference when minutes matter. The\ncombination of OverWatch’s unrivaled ability to uncover adversary activity and Falcon\nComplete’s expert and timely response is proven to disrupt ransomware attempts before the\nadversary can do damage.\n\n## Managed Services Plug the Skills Gap\n\nAmid these persistent threats, organizations report difficulty in finding staff with the skills\nneeded to establish and maintain a comprehensive security posture. Managed services can\ndeliver an immediate injection of security capability that can begin to pay dividends from Day\n\n\n-----\n\nOne. In fact, OverWatch regularly uncovers pre-existing intrusions during roll-out to new\ncustomer environments.\n\nCrowdStrike’s managed services provide benefits that cannot easily be replicated with an inhouse solution. Because CrowdStrike analysts have access to cloud-scale telemetry\nencompassing trillions of events per day, they have unparalleled visibility across the entire\ncustomer install base. This allows hunters to rapidly identify anomalous activity, which\nensures every customer benefits from near-real time insights into active threats. Both\nOverWatch and Falcon Complete are powered by CrowdStrike’s global threat intelligence,\nbringing critical context to the detection and response process. Crucially, all of this is\ndelivered with 24/7/365 coverage, providing comprehensive security when it is most needed:\nALWAYS.\n\nFinally, a partnership with CrowdStrike’s managed services equips organizations with roundthe-clock access to elite resources. OverWatch’s expert hunters deliver context-rich alerts\nthat empower organizations to rapidly contain threats and remediate their environments with\nconfidence. For organizations leveraging the power of Falcon Complete, expert responders\nwill work in lock-step with OverWatch threat hunters to rapidly and surgically remediate\nmalicious activity on an organization’s behalf.\n\nManaged services can be your fast track to a comprehensive, mature endpoint security\nprogram that equips you to face the most pressing global security challenges into 2022 and\nbeyond.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Download the 2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude Survey.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-security-attitude-survey-2021/)_\n_[Learn more about Falcon OverWatch’s proactive managed threat hunting.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-overwatch-threat-hunting/)_\n_[Check out the Falcon Complete product webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-complete/)_\n_[Watch this video to see how Falcon OverWatch proactively hunts for threats in your](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/videos/falcon-overwatch-proactively-hunts-threats-environment/)_\n_environment._\n_Read a white paper: CrowdStrike Falcon® Complete: Instant Cybersecurity Maturity for_\n_Organizations of All Sizes._\n_[Learn how the powerful CrowdStrike Falcon® platform provides comprehensive](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)_\n_protection across your organization, workers and data, wherever they are located._\n\n\n-----",
