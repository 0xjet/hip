Sources include Recorded\nFuture’s platform, VirusTotal, ReversingLabs, and third-party metadata, as well as common\nOSINT and network metadata enrichments, such as DomainTools IRIS and PassiveTotal. This\nresearch is part of a series highlighting the breadth of sophisticated techniques used by the\nChinese state against perceived domestic threats.\n\n### Executive Summary\n\n[Following our research uncovering the Chinese RedAlpha campaigns targeting the Tibetan](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redalpha-cyber-campaigns/)\ncommunity, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a novel Linux backdoor called “ext4,”\ndeployed against the same Tibetan victim group. By analyzing the backdoor, we uncovered\nrepeated attempted connections to the same compromised CentOS web server emanating\nfrom infrastructure registered to Tsinghua University, an elite Chinese academic 1\n\ninstitution.\n\nWe also identified network reconnaissance activities being conducted from the same\nTsinghua University infrastructure targeting many geopolitical organizations, including the\nState of Alaska Government, Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources, the United Nations\noffice in Nairobi, and the Kenya Ports Authority. Additionally, we identified the targeted\nscanning of German automotive multinational Daimler AG that began a day after it cut its\nprofit outlook for the year, citing the growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. In\nseveral cases, these activities occurred during periods of Chinese dialogue for economic\ncooperation with these countries or organizations.\n\nWe assess with medium confidence that the network reconnaissance activities we\nuncovered were conducted by Chinese state-sponsored actors in support of China’s\neconomic development goals.\n\n### Key Judgments\n\n  - Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246 engaged in network reconnaissance targeting\norganizations in Alaska, Kenya, Brazil, and Mongolia during times of economic\ndialogue or publicity around China’s investment in foreign infrastructure projects\nconcerning China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\n  - The network reconnaissance activity against Alaskan organizations increased\nfollowing the governor of Alaska’s trade delegation trip to China in late May.\n\n1 Tsinghua University is also romanized as Qinghua University.\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations targeted by the reconnaissance activity were in industries at the heart\nof the trade discussions, such as oil and gas.\n\n  - The targeting of German automotive multinational Daimler AG was observed a day\nafter it announced a profit warning in light of the growing U.S. and China trade\ntensions.\n\n  - The Tsinghua IP made at least one attempt to subscribe to a U.S.-based hotel’s\nhigh-speed internet portal. We assess with low confidence that this may\ndemonstrate an intent to breach Nomadix internet gateways within the hospitality\nsector running vulnerable WindWeb servers.\n\n  - The Tsinghua IP repeatedly attempted to connect with a Tibetan network that was\ncompromised with a highly sophisticated backdoor, “ext4.”\n\n  - “ext4” only allowed incoming TCP 443 connections to the compromised network\nduring a 180-second window every hour, with packets requiring a unique\ncombination of TCP header options to successfully connect. In over 20 observed\nattempts, the Tsinghua IP did not transmit the correct TCP options to activate the\nbackdoor. This suggested:\n\n    - The threat actors connecting from the Tsinghua IP were ill-informed of the\ncorrect “ext4” backdoor connection sequence and were making mistakes.\n\n    - The targeting of the Tibetan network is not associated with the presence of\nthe “ext4” backdoor and the network was being probed in line with wider\ngeopolitical and economic network reconnaissance activity being conducted\nby the Tsinghua IP.\n\n### Background\n\n[The People’s Republic of China (PRC) claims sovereignty over Tibet and regards all Tibetan](http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/tibet/)\nindependence movements as separatist threats. While the PRC uses many forms of\ncoercion against the Tibetan community, cyberespionage against Tibetan targets has\nbecome a frequently used tool, especially during times of heightened tensions. The first\n[known incident of Chinese cyberespionage against Tibet, dubbed GhostNet, was in 2008.](http://www.nartv.org/mirror/ghostnet.pdf)\nThis was part of a wider attempt to monitor foreign targets of national interest. There has\nsince been numerous cyberespionage campaigns documented against Tibetans, including\nin Recorded Future’s recent [RedAlpha report .](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redalpha-cyber-campaigns/)\n\n[Tsinghua University is located in the Haidian District in Beijing. Dubbed “China’s MIT,” it is](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html)\none of China’s premier technical research universities. Chinese universities have often been\nassociated with Chinese state-sponsored cyber capabilities both directly and indirectly. In\n2015, APT17 infrastructure was connected to a professor at [China’s Southeast University,](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/)\nand in 2017, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) [partnered with Xi’An Jiaotong University to](http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2017-07-13/doc-ifyiaewh9001223.shtml)\ncreate a cyber militia program. Tsinghua University is itself a state-owned institution and is\n\n\n-----\n\n[among the world’s top research and engineering schools. Its students’ offensive cyber](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/tsinghua-university)\ncapabilities are most famous through Blue-Lotus, a security research team composed of\nTsinghua University-affiliated individuals.

Tsinghua University’s Office of Scientific Research\n[and Development met with China CITIC Group for Communist Party meeting activities in](http://www.rd.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/kyy/9985/2018/20180529150910580154811/20180529150910580154811_.html)\nMay 2018, during which they discussed strategic cooperation between enterprises and\nresearch institutes to serve the development of the country. In the [1999 Select Committee](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRPT-105hrpt851/pdf/GPO-CRPT-105hrpt851.pdf)\n[on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the PRC (the so-called](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRPT-105hrpt851/pdf/GPO-CRPT-105hrpt851.pdf)\n“Cox Report”), CITIC was linked to PLA covert operations and the theft of sensitive U.S.\ntechnology. The Cox Report also cited an attempt in 1990 by CITIC to acquire a U.S. aircraft\nparts manufacturer on behalf of the PLA in order to access U.S. export-controlled\naerospace technology. Further, CITIC’s former chairman, Wang Zhen, was involved in the\n[1996 Poly Technologies indictment](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/senate-report/167/4) stemming from the company’s attempt to smuggle\n2,000 Chinese AK-47 assault rifles into the United States.\n\nTsinghua’s Institute of Information Systems and Engineering is also openly affiliated with\nChina’s National [863 and 973 programs. The](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) [863 Program, also known as the State](http://www.most.gov.cn/eng/programmes1/)\n[High-Tech Development Plan, focuses on developing national capabilities within China’s key](http://www.most.gov.cn/eng/programmes1/)\n[technological industries, while the](https://books.google.com/books?id=sWcolDneRrMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=the%20973%20Program&f=false) [973 Program, first established in 1997, focuses on](https://web.archive.org/web/20070612185037/http://www.973.gov.cn/English/Index.aspx)\ndeveloping the basic technologies required to achieve technological superiority in the key\nindustries. Both programs have had the effect of making it easier for China to steal\nintellectual property in order to achieve program goals.\n\nIn the past 10 years, a number of Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat actors have been\nidentified conducting widespread cyberespionage directly reflecting China’s [policy](http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2016-03/17/content_5054992.htm)\n[directives to gain scientific, technical, and economic advantage in key strategic industries.](http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2016-03/17/content_5054992.htm)\nThis activity can be observed most recently in operations by APT10, targeting [managed IT](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html)\n[service providers, and APT17, which conducted massive supply chain attacks against the](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html)\npopular software product CCleaner in 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future timeline of Tsinghua IP activity in correlation with Tibetan protests.\n\n### Threat Analysis\n\nRecorded Future discovered the presence of the “ext4” backdoor during our ongoing\nresearch into the targeting of the Tibetan community. This backdoor was configured to run\non a Linux web server running CentOS and was stealthily designed to be embedded within\na system file. The backdoor was mostly inactive other than during a three-minute window\nevery hour when it would activate and accept incoming connections on TCP port 443.\n\nIn total, Recorded Future’s unique coverage enabled us to observe 23 attempted\nconnections to the same compromised CentOS server between May and June 2018. Every\nattempt originated from the same IP, 166.111.8[.]246, which resolved to the China\n[Education and Research Network Center. WHOIS records reveal that the IP sits within a](https://www.abuseipdb.com/whois/166.111.8.246)\nlarge /16 CIDR range registered to an address at “Tsinghua University.”\n\n\n-----\n\nA unique selection of options in the TCP header, set at the maximum possible segment size\nof 60 bytes, were observed in every packet that attempted to connect to the Tibetan\nnetwork from the Tsinghua IP, as noted in the PCAP below.\n\nPCAP of connection attempt from Tsinghua IP to compromised Tibetan CentOS server.\n\nThe “ext4” code appears to be unique, with no prominent traces online for code or naming\nsimilarity. Aside from our submission, no uploads of a backdoor resembling the key\ncharacteristics of “ext4” were observed in leading multi-scanner repositories as of August 3,\n2018. A detection ratio of 0/58 in VirusTotal confirmed that the “ext4” sample we\ndiscovered was a new and unique backdoor targeting the Tibetan community.\n\nA detailed analysis of the “ext4” binary can be found in the Technical Analysis section of\nthis report.\n\n**Tsinghua University IP 166.111.8[.]246**\n\nThis IP was first observed in Recorded Future on March 23, 2018, and resolved to the\nChinese Education and Research Network Center (CERNET), according to several IP\nenrichment sources. [CERNET is one of China’s six major backbone networks and is a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERNET)\ncatchall organization serving a large swath of addressable IP space reserved for Chinese\nacademic and research institutes. As noted previously, WHOIS records confirm the IP sits\nwithin a range registered to “Tsinghua University.”\n\nAvailable port scan data revealed that the IP is currently configured with several actively\nrunning services, including [PPTP (TCP port 1723),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol) [MySQL (3306), and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) [MAMP (8888), as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAMP)\nas the more common [OpenSSH (22), HTTP (80, 8080, 8008), SSL (443, 8443, 9443), and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH) [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange)\n[IKE (500) services, among others. The HTTP ports appeared to be configured as NGINX web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange)\nservers, likely as reverse proxies or load balancers, given the nature of the activity we have\nobserved from this IP. The large number of open ports and associated services indicate\nthat the Tsinghua IP may be an internet gateway or VPN endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future Intelligence Card for Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246.\n\n[Recorded Future enrichments of the IP show that it has been the source of scanning,](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/166.111.8.246)\nbrute-force attacks, and active exploitation attempts in the past. It has triggered several risk\nrules, including being flagged by the Taichung City Education Bureau in Taiwan, which\ntracks Chinese-originating malicious cyber indicators, and appears in an AlienVault blacklist.\nMetadata analysis of the IP further indicates that it is likely a gateway, NAT, or proxy, and\nthat the true originating machine for this activity lies behind this IP.\n\nThe same IP address was also observed conducting large-scale network reconnaissance of\norganizations that were engaged in key trade discussions with Chinese state-owned entities\nat the time. We believe these reconnaissance activities were not coincidental as they align\nbroadly with China’s strategic and economic interests.\n\n\n-----\n\n**“Opportunity Alaska”**\n\nBetween April 6 and June 24, 2018, we observed over one million IP connections between\nthe Tsinghua IP and several networks in Alaska including:\n\n  - The Alaska Communications Systems Group\n\n  - Alaska Department of Natural Resources\n\n  - Alaska Power & Telephone Company\n\n  - State of Alaska Government\n\n  - TelAlaska\n\nThe vast number of connections between the Tsinghua IP and the above organizations\nrelate to the bulk scanning of ports 22, 53, 80, 139, 443, 769, and 2816 on the Alaskan\nnetworks and were likely conducted to ascertain vulnerabilities and gain illegitimate access.\nThe scanning activity was conducted in a systematic manner with entire IP ranges\ndedicated to the organizations probed for the above ports.\n\nThis targeting of the the State of Alaska Government followed Alaska’s large trade mission\n[into China dubbed “Opportunity Alaska .” This trade mission occurred in late May and was](https://gov.alaska.gov/services/office-of-international-trade/alaska-china-trade-mission/)\nled by Bill Walker, governor of Alaska. During these talks, one of the highest-profile\ndiscussions occurred around the prospect of a [gas pipeline between Alaska and China.](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Is-A-Natural-Gas-Pipeline-Between-Alaska-And-China-Realistic.html)\n[Despite fears of a China-U.S. trade war, Gov. Walker’s office](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/21/c_137193556.htm) [stated that the trade mission](https://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2018/04/alaska-businesses-selected-for-opportunity-alaska-china-trade-mission/)\n“represent[ed] some of the best Alaska has to offer, and ... [highlighted] the wide scope of our\nshared interests with our largest trade partner.” Opportunity Alaska consisted of delegates\n[from Alaskan businesses in the fshing, tourism, architecture, and investmenti](http://www.publicnow.com/view/C2AAB8A7B2C113C46307566F3B54B86C13109434) industries,\nand made stops in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork probing events conducted by Tsinghua IP targeting Alaskan institutions coinciding with Alaskan trade\n\ndelegation to China in May 2018.\n\nRecorded Future first observed the scanning activity against Alaskan networks in late\nMarch, only a few weeks after Gov. Walker announced a trade delegation to China. The\nactivity picked up for a few days prior to the delegation arriving on May 20, 2018, and\ndropped off as the delegation arrived. Probing of the Alaskan networks remained at low\nlevels until May 28 as the delegation concluded its activities, then ramped up considerably\nas delegates left China. The spike in scanning activity at the conclusion of trade discussions\non related topics indicates that the activity was likely an attempt to gain insight into the\nAlaskan perspective on the trip and strategic advantage in the post-visit negotiations.\n\nThere was a further surge in interest between June 20 and June 24 against the State of\nAlaska and Alaska Department of Natural Resources networks. This was possibly in\n[response to Gov. Walker announcing on June 19 that he intended to visit Washington, D.C.](https://www.upi.com/Alaskas-governor-to-issue-plea-to-avert-trade-war/3971529407509/)\nto meet U.S. and Chinese officials to raise his concerns on the growing trade dispute\nbetween the two nations.\n\n**The “Belt and Road Initiative” and China’s Economic Goals**\n\nDuring the course of our research, we also observed the Tsinghua IP scan ports and probe\ngovernment departments and commercial entities networks in Mongolia, Kenya, and Brazil.\n\n\n-----\n\nEach of these countries are key investment destinations as part of China’s Belt and Road\nInitiative.\n\n[China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is one of President Xi Jinping’s most ambitious](http://english.gov.cn/archive/publications/2015/03/30/content_281475080249035.htm)\nprograms. Envisaged to project [China’s transformative geopolitical infuencel](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/what-does-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-mean-for-us-grand-strategy/) across the\nworld, the scale and scope of the project is unprecedented.

The\nscheme is designed to connect major economic centers in Eurasia together over land and\nsea, many of which historically served the ancient Silk Road two thousand years ago.\n\nAccording to [The Diplomat, “the BRI aims to stabilize China’s western peripheries, rekindle](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/what-does-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-mean-for-us-grand-strategy/)\nits economy, propel non-Western international economic institutions, gain influence in\nother countries, and diversify trade suppliers/routes while circumventing the U.S. pivot to\nAsia.”\n\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n[Source: Mercator Institute for China Studies, merics.org](https://www.merics.org/en)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BRI also aims to further strengthen China’s geopolitical and economic influence in\nAfrica, capitalizing on significant infrastructure investments made across the continent.\nKenya in particular has commanded increased attention due to its strategic geographical\nadvantage in China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) — the sea-based component of\nChina’s BRI initiative.\n\nEarlier this year, [Kenya announced that it would be lobbying for regional projects under the](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/30/c_137075352.htm)\nBRI. China has already funded a [480-kilometer railway between the Kenyan port city of](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/01/c_137223684.htm)\nMombasa and its capital, Nairobi; the railway is eventually [expected to extend to](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-06/01/content_29570088.htm)\nneighboring countries Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi as well. However, in May 2018, [Kenya](http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya-rejects-China-EAC-free-trade-agreement/2560-4562142-x5dhrgz/index.html)\n[announced that it would not sign a free trade deal with China that had been under](http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya-rejects-China-EAC-free-trade-agreement/2560-4562142-x5dhrgz/index.html)\ndiscussion with East African Community (EAC) states, raising tensions between Beijing and\nNairobi.\n\nIn early June 2018, we observed the Tsinghua IP address aggressively scanning ports 22, 53,\n80, 389, and 443 of various Kenyan internet-hosting providers and telecommunications\ncompanies, as well as ranges dedicated to the Kenya Ports Authority, a state corporation\nresponsible for the maintenance and operation of all of Kenya’s seaports. Recorded Future\nalso identified network reconnaissance activities directed at the United Nations Office in\nNairobi, Kenya’s Strathmore University, and a broader national education network.\n\nThis chart below shows a clear spike in network reconnaissance activity against Kenyan\norganizations from the Tsinghua IP. This spike occurred merely two weeks after Kenya\nannounced its intentions not to support the China-EAC free trade agreement.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork recon events conducted by Tsinghua IP targeting Kenyan institutions overlayed with key China-Kenya\n\neconomic developments, March 2018 to June 2018.\n\n[In April of this year, President Xi added Brazil to the list of countries receiving Chinese](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-25/china-expands-brazil-frontier-as-investment-grows-during-crisis)\ninvestment in infrastructure from the BRI.

The next day, on June 21, we observed network reconnaissance activity\nspecifically targeting ports 139, 22, 443, and 53 on networks resolving to Daimler AG. The\nprobes originated from the same Tsinghua University IP.\n\n\n-----\n\nTsinghua IP probing Daimler AG networks on ports 139, 22, 443, and 53 between June 20 to 24, 2018.\n\n**Interaction With U.S. Managed Hotel Network Solutions Provider**\n\nA Shodan query on the Tsinghua IP returned an HTTP 302 response serving a\n[“snap.safetynetaccess.com” redirection notice.

However, none of the attempted\nconnections to the Tibetan device from the Tsinghua IP resulted in the successful activation\nof the backdoor, leaving it unclear whether the threat actors behind the widespread\nnetwork recon activities were also responsible for the “ext4” backdoor.\n\nThat leaves us with two possible scenarios explaining the involvement of the “ext4”\nbackdoor on a Tibetan network with the Tsinghua IP:\n\n1. The Tsinghua IP is being used by a threat actor to access the “ext4” backdoor, but a\ntechnical fault or operator error is resulting in the misconfiguration of the TCP\nconnection packets required to establish communication with the backdoor.\n2. The Tsinghua IP is being used extensively to conduct network reconnaissance and\ncyberespionage against strategic economic and national interests, not only targeting\ncountries that China is engaging with under BRI, but also targeting “Five Poisons ” 2\n\norganizations, such as the Tibetan network. The “ext4” backdoor is therefore likely to\nbelong to another threat actor not engaged in the network scanning activity against\norganizations outlined earlier in this report.\n\n2 The “Five Poisons” are threats the Chinese Communist Party sees to its stability, including Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong,\nthe Chinese democracy movement, and Taiwan’s independence movement.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n**The “ext4” Backdoor**\n\n**MD5** d08de00e7168a441052672219e717957\n\n**SHA1** 7f77d2f18c82b4fedf313b2df7d2b581a9b73a48\n\n**SHA256** acd07de34cc15f49fd919dc18e695632a08a132fcfc4e9b6292e1a0d45e953e5\n\n**Type** ELF x64\n\n**Size** 9511 bytes\n\n**File Name** ext4\n\n“ext4” backdoor key characteristics.\n\n“ext4” is a novel Linux backdoor that was present on the victim network during the same\ntime that the Tsinghua IP reconnaissance activity was observed (May to June, 2018). In total,\n23 attempts to connect to the victim device over TCP 443 were made from the Tsinghua IP\nduring this period.\n\n[The “ext4” backdoor was identified running within a legitimate system “ cron ” file on a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)\ncompromised CentOS web server affiliated with the Tibetan community. An analysis of\nmodified system files revealed that the “0anacron” “cron” file had been modified to execute\na non-standard binary called “ext4” located in the /usr/bin/ext4 directory on the\ncompromised server. The binary was configured to run hourly, and, interestingly, as a\nbackground process. This would suppress any output from appearing on the Linux\nterminal’s standard output, thus making it less detectable to the administrator of the web\nserver.\n\n|MD5|d08de00e7168a441052672219e717957|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|7f77d2f18c82b4fedf313b2df7d2b581a9b73a48|\n|SHA256|acd07de34cc15f49fd919dc18e695632a08a132fcfc4e9b6292e1a0d45e953e5|\n|Type|ELF x64|\n|Size|9511 bytes|\n|File Name|ext4|\n\n\n-----\n\nModified etc/cron.hourly/0anacron script to include “ext4” backdoor function.\n\nThe “ext4” binary was relatively small at only 9511 bytes and was made up of simple\nfunctions. It was dynamically linked to the libpcap library, which is present on Unix systems\n[to allow the capturing of packets ( pcap files) typically used by “network sniffers.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcap)\n\nThere were three primary functions that drive the operation of the backdoor: “main,”\n“process,” and “my_pcap_handler.” All of these functions flow together to perform the main\nfunctionality of the backdoor.\n\n**Main Function**\n\nThe main function performed three central tasks: to remove the file “tmp/0baaf161db39,”\nto create a child process that executes the backdoor functionality, and to set a sleep timer\nof 180 seconds. The process is terminated when the sleep timer limit is reached.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the main function also checked the command line arguments to determine\nwhich network interface to monitor on the compromised network. By default, “ext4” used\n“eth0.”\n\n**Process Function**\n\nThe main purpose of the process function was to create a handle to capture network\ntraffic, which was done by use of the libpcap function, “pcap_open_live.”\n\nOnce the handle had been created, another libpcap function, “pcap_loop,” was executed,\nwhich processed all of the packets sent to the interface specified in “pcap_open_live” and\n\n\n-----\n\nsent them to the function “my_packet_handler” to parse and perform actions based on the\ntype of packet sent.\n\n**“my_packet_handler” Function**\n\nAll packets sent to a specified network interface were received by the “my_packet_handler”\nfunction. The handler then parsed the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers to perform a series of 3\n\nchecks to validate if it is a packet that it is meant to process. Once validated, the function\ndecoded the payload, which would typically be a command fed to a bash shell on the\ncompromised CentOS host.\n\nThe below steps demonstrate the parsing and validation criteria the function used to\nensure that it processed the correct packets. If at any point the function receives\nunexpected results, the packet is dropped from the function and the next one is processed.\n\n1. Check the ethernet header to ensure the type is IP (Type 2048).\n2. IP header length is parsed from the IP header.\n3. Parse the IP header to ensure the protocol is TCP (Type 6).\n4. Parse the TCP header to ensure the destination port is 443.\n5. Find the data offset or the start of the payload.\n6. Check that the TCP flags equal 322, which equates to the following flags being set:\nNS (Nonce Sum), ECE (ECN-Echo), and SYN.\n\n3 For reference, we have provided a table in Appendix A that shows the offsets for the ethernet, IP, and TCP headers. This can\nbe used to help follow how this function parses the headers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe breakdown of the flags is important, as it looks for the SYN and ECE to be set, as well as\nthe NS flag. The NS flag is used to protect against accidental or malicious concealment of\nmarked packets from the TCP sender.\n\nThe ECE flag is responsible for indicating if the TCP peer is Explicit Congestion Notification\n[( ECN ) compatible. ECN is an optional extension to TCP that prevents packets being dropped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Congestion_Notification)\ndue to congestion. While the use of ECN can be normal in larger enterprises with\nECN-capable routers, the use of the NS bit seems to be experimental and is not officially\nused in any TCP implementations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a packet passes all of the criteria, the function gets the length of the payload and checks\nthat it is between five and 1024 bytes. After that, it allocates memory and then saves the\npayload into memory.\n\nThe payload is XOR-encoded, and the first byte of the payload is the XOR key. The function\nwill use the first byte of payload to decode the next five bytes and check to see if they equal\nthe string “anti:.”\n\nIf the decoded bytes equal “anti:,” then the rest of payload will be decoded and passed as a\nfinal argument to run a bash command using the execl call.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Outlook\n\nChina continues to use cyber operations to monitor and track threats to domestic stability,\nneatly summarized as the “Five Poisons.” This focus on domestic threats enables security\nresearchers to identify new campaigns and tools being aggressively used against\npersecuted communities. “ext4” is a sophisticated lightweight Linux backdoor designed to\nenable the threat actor to access the compromised device and conduct further malicious\nactivity. It is also an example of a tool probably being used by Chinese nation-state actors\nto target the Tibetan community.\n\nFurther, the widespread use of CentOS servers, many of which are unpatched and used in\nproduction systems, highlights the breadth of the potential attack surface.\n\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative and its [long-term investment in African infrastructure has](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/the-closest-look-yet-at-chinese-economic-engagement-in-africa)\n[enabled China to wield massive infuencel](https://www.ft.com/content/0f534aa4-4549-11e7-8519-9f94ee97d996) in those countries targeted by these policies. We\nassess with medium confidence that the widespread network reconnaissance activities\nemanating from Tsinghua University infrastructure and targeting economic interests in\nKenya, Mongolia, and Brazil are state directed.\n\nChina has repeatedly conducted cyberespionage in support of its national economic\ninterests. In November 2017, the [DOJ indicted three Chinese hackers found guilty of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-three-chinese-hackers-who-work-internet-security-firm-hacking-three-corporations)\neconomic cyberespionage. Further, in its [recent report on Foreign Economic Espionage in](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf)\n[Cyberspace, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center highlighted Chinese](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf)\nthreat actors APT10, KeyBoy, and Temp.Periscope as having conducted extensive\ncyberespionage in support of strategic national and economic benefit.\n\nOther than the discovery of the “ext4” backdoor targeting the Tibetan community, we have\nnot identified the presence of malware in any of the documented organizations in this\nreport, as the bulk of our analysis was based on third-party metadata. However, we assess\nwith medium confidence that the targeted scanning and probing of networks during the\ntimeframe of bilateral trade and strategic dialogue between China and its Alaskan, Kenyan,\nBrazilian, and Mongolian counterparts indicates the activity is being conducted by a threat\nactor (or multiple threat actors with access to the same Tsinghua endpoint) directed by the\nChinese state.\n\n**Network Defense Recommendations**\n\nRecorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following measures when\ndefending against hostile network reconnaissance and the potential deployment of a\nCentOS backdoor from the Chinese threat actor detailed in this report:\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems\n(IPS) to alert and block connection attempts from Tsinghua University IP\n166.111.8[.]246.\n\n  - Using the provided Yara rule for the “ext4” backdoor, conduct scans of any Linux\nhosts on networks for presence of the backdoor.\n\n  - If applicable, ensure the “ext4” Yara rule is deployed to the endpoint protection\nappliance used in your organization.\n\n  - Scan Linux hosts for the presence of the “/usr/bin/ext4” and “/tmp/0baaf161db39”\nfiles.\n\nAdditionally, we advise organizations to follow the following general information security\nbest practice guidelines:\n\n  - Keep all software and applications up to date; in particular, operating systems,\nantivirus software, and core system utilities.\n\n  - Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.\n\n  - Make regular backups of your system and store the backups offline, preferably\noff-site so that data cannot be accessed via the network.\n\n  - Have a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan.\n\n  - Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. In particular, look\nat which data anyone with access to an employee account or device would have\naccess to (for example, through device or account takeover through phishing).\nStrongly consider instituting role-based access, limiting company-wide data access,\nand restricting access to sensitive data.\n\n  - Employ host-based controls — one of the best defenses and warning signals to\nthwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and intrusion detection\ncapabilities.\n\n  - Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and controls like\nnetwork IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside human\nmonitoring of detection sources.\n\n  - Be aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Being able to monitor and\nenforce security standards for ecosystem partners is an important part of any\norganization’s security posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix A —** **[Indicators of Compromise](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0816-iocs.csv)**\n\nSHA256: acd07de34cc15f49fd919dc18e695632a08a132fcfc4e9b6292e1a0d45e953e5\n166.111.8[.]246\n/usr/bin/ext4\n/tmp/0baaf161db39\n\n**Appendix B —** **[Yara Rules](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0816-yara-rules.yar)**\n\nrule apt_ext4_linuxlistener\n{\nmeta:\ndescription = \"Detects Unique Linux Backdoor, Ext4\"\nauthor = \"Insikt Group, Recorded Future\"\nTLP = \"White\"\ndate = \"2018‐08‐14\"\nmd5_x64 = \"d08de00e7168a441052672219e717957\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$s1=\"rm /tmp/0baaf161db39\"\n$op1= {3c 61 0f}\n$op2= {3c 6e 0f}\n$op3= {3c 74 0f}\n$op4= {3c 69 0f}\n$op5= {3c 3a 0f}\n\ncondition:\nall of them\n}\n\n**Appendix C — Ethernet, IP, and TCP Header Offset 4**\n\n4 Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/](https://en.wikipedia.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence solution powered by patented machine learning to\nlower risk.
