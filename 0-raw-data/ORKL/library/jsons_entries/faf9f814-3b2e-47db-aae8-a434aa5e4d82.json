By 2015, the group managed to\nbreach more than 100 banks in 40 countries around the world and stole more than $1 billion,\n[according to a Kaspersky investigation.](https://securelist.com/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/68732/)\n\nImage: Kaspersky\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wUU8bAVgx80\n\n[A first Carbanak member was arrested in March 2018 in Spain.
