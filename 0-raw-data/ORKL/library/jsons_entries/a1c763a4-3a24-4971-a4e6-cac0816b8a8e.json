Threat actors who subscribe to the operation\nwill get access to an admin panel that lets them customize the malware, retrieve stolen data\n(aka logs), and create new malware builds.\n\nThe malware is very popular among threat actors as it can steal a wide variety of information\nfrom infected devices, including stored browser credentials, browser information,\n[cryptocurrency wallets, credit cards, email data, and other data from numerous applications.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/racoon-malware-steals-your-data-from-nearly-60-apps/)\n\n## Raccoon Stealer operation suspended\n\n\n-----\n\nAs first spotted by security researcher [3xp0rt, the threat actors behind the Raccoon Stealer](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog)\nposted today to Russian-speaking hacking forums that they are suspending their operation\nafter one of their core developers was killed in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Dear Clients, unfortunately, due to the \"special operation\", we will have to close our\nproject Raccoon Stealer.\n\nThe members of our team who are responsible for critical moments in the operation of\nthe product are no longer with us.\n\nWe are disappointed to close our project, further stable operation of the stealer is\nphysically impossible.\"\n\n**Raccoon Stealer operation suspending operations**\n\n_Source: 3xp0rt_\nHowever, it does not appear that they will be gone forever, as they state that they plan to\nrebuild the lost components and relaunch in a few months.\n\nWith the closure of Raccoon Stealer, 3xp0rt told BleepingComputer that threat actors are\nnow moving to the Mars Stealer operation, which offers a similar service as Raccoon.\n\nAccording to a post on the Russian-speaking XSS hacking forum, the 'MarsTeam' has been\noverwhelmed with requests since Raccoon announced they are shutting down, making it\ndifficult to respond to everyone.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Threat actors switching to Mars Stealer**\n3xp0rt says that we should expect a surge of Mars Stealer campaigns shortly, as threat\nactors move to the service, which operates similarly to Raccoon.\n\n## Ukraine has an active cybercrime community\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has had a significant impact on cybercrime and the hacking\nunderground, with many threat actors residing in the country and publicly taking sides in the\nwar.\n\nA representative of the now-defunct Maze ransomware operation recently released the\nmaster decryption keys for past victims [on BleepingComputer's forums.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/768330/leak-maze-egregor-sekhmet-keys-along-with-m0yv-expiro-source-code/)\n\nIn a conversation with the Maze representative who leaked the keys, BleepingComputer was\nalso told that he is Ukrainian and was arrested by the Ukrainian police.\n\n[The recent 'Conti Leaks' of internal chats, source code, and the doxing of TrickBot and Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomwares-internal-chats-leaked-after-siding-with-russia/)\nransomware members was directly caused by the criminal operations taking sides with\nRussia and upsetting Ukrainian threat actors and researchers.\n\nLaw enforcement has also been very active over the past year, arresting numerous threat\n[actors
