It is actively used against high-value targets, most likely for espionage purposes. Phishing campaigns\nconducted by Nobelium operators have targeted countries in Europe, Africa, North America and Asia. Activities\nlinked to this intrusion set have been publicly linked to the Russian foreign intelligence service SVR.\n\nSeveral observers and ANSSI’s partners describe activities tied to this intrusion set under the name APT29. How-\never, based on the observation of attackers’ evolving codes, tactics, technics and procedures, ANSSI prefers to dif-\nferentiate three different and full-fledged SVR-related intrusion sets: APT29, also known as The Dukes, reportedly\nactive since at least 2008, used until 2019 against various governments, think-tanks, diplomatic entities and political\nparties and notably associated with the 2015 attack against the American Democratic National Committee [2]; Dark\n_Halo, publicly linked to the supply chain attack via SolarWinds and exposed in December 2020; and Nobelium, likely_\nactive since at least October 2020.\n\n_Nobelium is characterized by the use of specific codes, tactics, technics and procedures. Most of Nobelium cam-_\npaigns against diplomatic entities use compromised legitimate email accounts belonging to diplomatic staff,\n**and conduct phishing campaigns against diplomatic institutions, embassies and consulates. These activities**\nare also publicly described as a campaign called “Diplomatic Orbiter”. The lure documents used in these attacks are\ntypically forged to target diplomatic staff. The operators attempt to deliver their own private loaders, in order to\nexecute public tools such as Cobalt Strike or Brute Ratel C4, to access the victim’s network, ensure persistence and\nexfiltrate valuable intelligence. However, several IT companies have also reported that they have been targeted by\n_Nobelium’s operators in late 2023 and 2024._\n\nDecember: supply-chain attack February-May: targeting of the May: targeting of French embassies\n_via_ Solar Winds French MFA in Ukraine and Romania\n\nAPT29\nDark Halo Nobelium\n\n2015: attack against the American March-May: targeting of December: attack January: attack\nDemocratic National Committee several French embassies against Microsoft against Hewlett\n\nPackard Enterprise\n\nExamples of attacks linked with APT29, Dark Halo and Nobelium\n\n## Malicious activities against French diplomatic entities\n\nWestern diplomatic entities, such as embassies and Ministries of Foreign Affairs, account for the majority of known\n_Nobelium’s victims. French public organisations have been targeted several times by phishing emails sent_\n**from foreign institutions previously compromised by Nobelium’s operators.**\n\nFrom February to May 2021, Nobelium operators conducted several phishing campaigns [3] exploiting compromised\nemail accounts belonging to the French Ministry of Culture and the National Agency for Territorial Cohesion\n(ANCT), sending an attachment called “Strategic Review”. The investigations led by ANSSI concluded that the\n\n[1. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-threat-actor-naming?view=o365-](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-threat-actor-naming?view=o365-worldwide)\n```\n      worldwide\n\n```\n[2. https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/)\n[3. https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2021-CTI-011/](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2021-CTI-011/)\n\nPage 1 of 3\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious activities linked to the Nobelium intrusion set\n\nattackers did not manage to move laterally within the Ministry of Culture and the ANCT information systems.\nThese compromised accounts have been used to target a variety of entities, including the French Ministry of For-\neign Affairs. Nobelium operators attempted to install the Cobalt Strike tool on the French Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs information system, which could have enabled remote control on the compromised machines. However,\nthe attack against the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unsuccessful.\n\nIn March 2022, a European embassy in South Africa received a malicious email impersonating a French embassy,\nwhich announced its closing due to an unspecified terrorist act. The phishing emails were sent from a compromised\naccount belonging to a French diplomat.\n\nIn April and May 2022, dozens of email addresses belonging to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs were targeted\nby phishing emails linked to Nobelium. In order to draw the attention of their targets, these phishing emails were\nthemed on the closing of a Ukrainian embassy or an appointment with a Portuguese ambassador.\n\nIn May 2023, several European embassies in Kyiv were targeted by a phishing campaign conducted by Nobelium’s\noperators. The French embassy in Kyiv was one of the targets of this campaign, which was conducted through an\nemail that was themed about a “Diplomatic car for sale”.\n\nIn May 2023, an attempt by Nobelium operators to compromise the French Embassy in Romania was detected but\nwas also unsuccessful thanks to the appropriate behavior of the diplomatic staff.\n\n**ANSSI and C4 members consider that the imputation of these activities against French diplomatic entities**\n**to Nobelium is consistent. The tools and infrastructures employed by the attackers show similarities with other**\n_Nobelium-linked campaigns. The victims of these activities aiming to exfiltrate strategic intelligence are consistent_\nwith the usual targeting associated with Nobelium by other observers. The capabilities implemented to compro-\nmise such a vast number of email accounts, the persistence of the attacks, the efforts put into the forgery of lure\ndocuments indicate that Nobelium is almost certainly operated on behalf of a state actor.\n\n## Malicious activities against international IT entities\n\nSeveral companies in the IT industry have disclosed their targeting and compromise by Nobelium’s operators. Ac-\ncording to Microsoft, part of the activities linked to Nobelium (alias Midnight Blizzard) has targeted technology\ncompanies worldwide, especially in North America and Western Europe.\n\nMicrosoft reported a security incident at the end of November 2023 attributed to Nobelium [4]. The attackers exfil-\ntrated emails from the cybersecurity and legal teams as well as executives. The cybersecurity teams at Microsoft\nregularly publish intelligence concerning Nobelium’s activities: the attackers may have tried to find out the infor-\nmation Microsoft held on their operations. These insights could give the attackers opportunities to improve their\noperational security, to avoid the detection of their attacks and to hinder the analysts’ monitoring capabilities.\n\nIn January 2024, the American company Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has reported that a suspected nation-\nstate actor, believed to be the threat actor Midnight Blizzard obtained a non-authorized access to the company’s\ncloud-based email environment [5].\n\nA report [6] published in December 2023 by Polish, British and American authorities stated that Nobelium operators\nhad exploited CVE-2023-42793 since September 2023 on a large scale against servers hosting the JetBrains software\ndeveloped by TeamCity. It seems that this campaign was opportunistic and not driven by a consistent targeting\npattern: at least a dozen companies in various countries and sectors have been identified as compromised. Accord-\ning to CERT.PL, the compromise of TeamCity servers could have made it possible to carry out supply-chain attacks,\nhowever such attempts have not been observed. Nevertheless, this campaign shows that Nobelium’s operators are\npotentially looking for opportunities to carry out supply-chain attacks.\n\n[4. https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/)\n```\n      blizzard/\n\n```\n[5. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1645590/000164559024000009/hpe-20240119.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1645590/000164559024000009/hpe-20240119.htm)\n[6. https://cert.pl/en/posts/2023/12/apt29-teamcity/](https://cert.pl/en/posts/2023/12/apt29-teamcity/)\n\nPage 2 of 3\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious activities linked to the Nobelium intrusion set\n## Nobelium remains an active threat to French and international interests\n\nANSSI has observed a high level of activities linked to Nobelium against the recent backdrop of geopolitical tensions,\nespecially in Europe, in relation to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Nobelium’s activities against government\n**and diplomatic entities represent a national security concern and endanger French and European diplomatic**\n**interests.**\n\nThe targeting of IT and cybersecurity entities for espionage purposes by Nobelium operators potentially strengthen\n**their offensive capabilities and the threat they represent. The intelligence gathered during recent attacks against**\nIT sector entities could also facilitate Nobelium’s future operations.\n\n_Nobelium’s technics, tactics and procedures remain mainly constant over time. Technical elements are available in_\nANSSI’s publication dated of the 6[th] of December 2021 “Phishing campaigns by the Nobelium intrusion set” [7].\n\nMoreover, ANSSI and its partners observed several indicators of compromise (IOCs) linked to Nobelium’s latest\ncampaigns. They are available on Zscaler [8] and Mandiant [9] websites.\n\n[7. https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2021-CTI-011/](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2021-CTI-011/)\n[8. https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-spikedwine-wineloader](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-spikedwine-wineloader)\n[9. https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt29-wineloader-german-political-parties](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt29-wineloader-german-political-parties)\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\n\n-----",
