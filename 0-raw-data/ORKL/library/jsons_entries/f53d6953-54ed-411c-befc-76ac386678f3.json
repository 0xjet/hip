Dubbed Operation Cobalt Kitty, the APT targeted\n**a global corporation based in Asia** with the goal of stealing proprietary business information. The threat actor\ntargeted the company’s top-level management by using sophisticated spear-phishing attacks as the initial\npenetration vector, ultimately compromising the computers of vice presidents, senior directors and other key\npersonnel in the operational departments. During Operation Cobalt Kitty, the attackers compromised more than 40\nPCs and servers, including the domain controller, file servers, Web application server and database server.\n\nForensic artifacts revealed that the attackers persisted on the network for at least a year **before Cybereason was**\n**deployed. The adversary proved very adaptive and responded to company’s security measures by periodically**\nchanging tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs), allowing them to persist on the network for such an extensive\nperiod of time. Over 80 payloads and numerous domains were observed in this operation – all of which were\nundetected by traditional security products deployed in the company’s environment at the time of the attack.\n\nThe attackers arsenal consisted of modified publicly-available tools as well as six **undocumented custom-built**\n**tools, which Cybereason considers the threat actor’s signature tools. Among these tools are two backdoors that**\nexploited DLL sideloading attack in **Microsoft, Google and Kaspersky applications. In addition, they developed**\na novel and stealthy backdoor that targets Microsoft Outlook for command-and-control channel and data\nexfiltration.\n\nBased on the tools, modus operandi and IOCs (indicators of compromise) observed in Operation Cobalt Kitty,\n[Cybereason attributes this large-scale cyber espionage APT to the “OceanLotus Group” (which is also known as,](https://ti.360.com/upload/report/file/OceanLotusReport.pdf)\n[APT-C-00, SeaLotus and APT32). For detailed information tying Operation Cobalt Kitty to the OceanLotus Group,](http://zhuiri.360.cn/report/index.php/2015/05/29/482/?lang=en)\n[please see our Attacker’s Arsenal and Threat Actor Profile](https://www2.cybereason.com/asset/59:research-cobalt-kitty-attackers-arsenal) sections.\n\n[Cybereason also attributes the recently reported Backdoor.Win32.Denis to the OceanLotus Group, which at the time](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\nof this report’s writing, had not been officially linked to this threat actor.\n\nFinally, this report offers a rare glimpse into what a cyber espionage APT looks like “under-the-hood”. Cybereason\nwas able to monitor and detect the entire attack lifecycle, from infiltration to exfiltration and all the steps in\nbetween.\n\nOur report contains the following detailed sections (PDF):\n\n## High-level attack outline: A cat-and-mouse game in four acts\n\nThe following sections outline the four phases of the attack as observed by Cybereason’s analysts, who were called\nto investigate the environment after the company’s IT department suspected that their network was breached but\ncould not trace the source.\n\n\n-----\n\nattack that began about a year before Cybereason was deployed in the environment. During that phase, the threat\nactor operated a fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure, using customized PowerShell payloads taken from\n[known offensive frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, PowerSploit and Nishang.](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon)\n\nThe initial penetration vector was carried out by social engineering. Carefully selected group of employees received\nspear-phishing emails, containing either links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents. These documents\ncontained malicious macros that created persistence on the compromised machine using two scheduled tasks,\nwhose purpose was to download secondary payloads (mainly Cobalt Strike Beacon):\n\n**Scheduled task 1: Downloads a COM scriptlet that redirects to Cobalt Strike payload:**\n\n**Scheduled task 2: Uses Javascript to download a Cobalt Strike Beacon:**\n\n[See more detailed analysis of the malicious documents in our Attack Life Cycle section.](https://www2.cybereason.com/asset/60:research-cobalt-kitty-attack-lifecycle)\n\n### Fileless payload delivery infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the first phase of the attack, the attackers used a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure consisting of\nthe following components:\n\n1. **VBS and PowerShell-based loaders**\n\nThe attackers dropped Visual Basic and PowerShell scripts in folders that they created under the ProgramData (a\nhidden folder, by default). The attackers created persistence using Windows’ registry, services and scheduled tasks.\nThis persistence mechanism ensured that the loader scripts would execute either at startup or at predetermined\nintervals.\n\nValues found in Windows’ Registry: the VBS scripts are executed by Windows’ Wscript at startup:\n\nThe .vbs scripts as well as the .txt files contain the loader’s script, which launches PowerShell with a base64\nencoded command, which either loads another PowerShell script (e.g Cobalt Strike Beacon) or fetches a payload\nfrom the command-and-control (C&C) server:\n\n\n-----\n\n2. **In-memory fileless payloads from C&C servers**\n\nThe payloads served by the C&C servers are mostly PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads\n(Metasploit and Cobalt Strike payloads):\n\n**Example 1: PowerShell payload with embedded Shellcode downloading Cobalt Strike Beacon**\n\nThe decoded payload is a shellcode, whose purpose is to retrieve a Cobalt Strike Beacon from the C&C server:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example 2: Cobalt Strike Beacon embedded in obfuscated PowerShell**\n\nA second type of an obfuscated PowerShell payload consisted of Cobalt Strike’s Beacon payload:\n\n**Less than 48 hours after Cybereason alerted the company about the breach**, the attackers started to change\ntheir approach and almost completely abandoned the PowerShell infrastructure that they had been using – replacing\nit with sophisticated custom-built backdoors The attackers’ remarkable ability to quickly adapt demonstrated their\n\n\n-----\n\nPolicy Object (GPO) and Cybereason s execution prevention feature to prevent PowerShell execution.\n\n### Phase two: Backdoors exploiting DLL-hijacking and using DNS tunneling\n\nAfter realizing that the PowerShell infrastructure had been discovered, the attackers had to quickly replace it to\nmaintain persistence and continue the operation. Replacing this infrastructure in 48 hours suggests that the threat\nactors were prepared for such a scenario.\n\nDuring the second phase of the attack, the attackers introduced two sophisticated backdoors that they\n**attempted to deploy on selected targets. The introduction of the backdoors is a key turning point in the**\ninvestigation since it demonstrated the threat actor’s resourcefulness and skill-set.\n\n**At the time of the attack, these backdoors were undetected and undocumented by any security vendor.**\n[Recently, Kaspersky researchers identified a variant of one of the backdoors as Backdoor.Win32.Denis. The](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\nattackers had to make sure that they remained undetected so the backdoors were designed to be as stealthy as\npossible. To avoid being discovered, the malware authors used these techniques:\n\n**Backdoors exploiting DLL hijacking against trusted applications**\n\n[The backdoor exploited a vulnerability called “ DLL hijacking” in order to “hide” the malware inside trusted software.](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/dll-hijacking-attacks-revisited/)\nThis technique exploits a security vulnerability found in legitimate software, which allows the attackers to load a fake\nDLL and execute its malicious code.\n\nPlease see an analysis of the backdoors in the [Attacker’s Arsenal section.](https://www2.cybereason.com/asset/59:research-cobalt-kitty-attackers-arsenal)\n\nThe attackers exploited this vulnerability against the following trusted applications:\n\n**Windows Search (vulnerable applications: searchindexer.exe /searchprotoclhost.exe)**\n\n**Fake DLL: msfte.dll (638b7b0536217c8923e856f4138d9caff7eb309d)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Google Update (d30e8c7543adbc801d675068530b57d75cabb13f)**\n\n**Fake DLL: goopdate.dll (973b1ca8661be6651114edf29b10b31db4e218f7)**\n\n\n-----\n\n(691686839681adb345728806889925dc4eddb74e)\n\n**Fake DLL: product_info.dll**\n(3cf4b44c9470fb5bd0c16996c4b2a338502a7517)\n\nBy exploiting legitimate software, the attackers bypassed application whitelisting and legitimate security software,\nallowing them to continue their operations without raising any suspicions.\n\n**DNS Tunneling as C2 channel –**\n\nIn attempt to overcome network filtering solutions, the attackers implemented a [stealthier C2 communication](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\n[method, using “DNS Tunneling” – a method of C2 communicating and data exfiltration using the DNS protocol. To](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/dns-tunnelling/#gref)\nensure that the DNS traffic would not be filtered, the attackers configured the backdoor to communicate with Google\nand OpenDNS DNS servers, since most organizations and security products will not filter traffic to those two major\nDNS services.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot below shows the traffic generated by the backdoor and demonstrates DNS Tunneling for C2\ncommunication. As shown, while the destination IP is “8.8.8.8” – Google’s DNS server – the malicious domain is\n“hiding” inside the DNS packet:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phase three: Novel MS Outlook backdoor and lateral movement spree\n\nIn the third phase of the operation, the attackers harvested credentials stored on the compromised machines and\nperformed lateral movement and infected new machines. The attackers also introduced a very rare and stealthy\n**technique to communicate with their servers and exfiltrate data using Microsoft Outlook.**\n\n### Outlook macro backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nthat enabled them to execute commands, deploy their tools and steal valuable data from the compromised\nmachines.\n\n[For a detailed analysis of the Outlook backdoor, please see the Attacker’s Arsenal section.](https://www2.cybereason.com/asset/59:research-cobalt-kitty-attackers-arsenal)\n\nThis technique works as follows:\n\n1. The malicious macro scans the victim’s Outlook inbox and looks for the strings “$$cpte” and “$$ecpte”.\n\n2. Then the macro will open a CMD shell that will execute whatever instruction / command is in between the\n\nstrings.\n\n3. The macro deletes the message from inbox to ensure minimal risk of exposure.\n\n4. The macro searches for the special strings in the “Deleted Items” folder to find the attacker’s email address\n\nand sends the data back to the attackers via email.\n\n5. Lastly, the macro will delete any evidence of the emails received or sent by the attackers.\n\n### Credential dumping and lateral movement\n\n[The attackers used the famous Mimikatz credential dumping tool as their main tool to obtain credentials including](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nuser passwords, NTLM hashes and Kerberos tickets. Mimikatz is a very popular tool and is detected by most\nantivirus vendors and other security products. Therefore, the attackers used over 10 different customized Mimikatz\npayloads, which were obfuscated and packed in a way that allowed them to evade antivirus detection.\n\nThe following are examples of Mimikatz command line arguments detected during the attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stolen credentials were used to infect more machines, leveraging Windows built-in tools as well as pass-the[ticket and pass-the-hash attacks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash)\n\n### Phase four: New arsenal and attempt to restore PowerShell infrastructure\n\nAfter a four week lull and no apparent malicious activity, the attackers returned to the scene and introduced new and\nimproved tools aimed at bypassing the security mitigations that were implemented by the company’s IT team. These\ntools and methods mainly allowed them to bypass the PowerShell execution restrictions and password\n**dumping mitigations.**\n\nDuring that phase, Cybereason found a compromised server that was used as the main attacking machine, where\nthe attackers stored their arsenal in a network share, which made it easier to spread their tools to other machines\non the network. The attackers’ arsenal consisted:\n\n**New variants of Denis and Goopy backdoors**\n\n**PowerShell Restriction Bypass Tool** **[– Adapted from PSUnlock Github project.](https://github.com/p3nt4/PSUnlock)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[script adapted from a Daniel Bohannon s GitHub project.](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation/blob/master/Invoke-Obfuscation.ps1)**\n\n**HookPasswordChange** **[– Inspired by tools found on GitHub, this tool alerts the attackers if a password has](https://gist.github.com/mubix/6514311#file-evilpassfilter-cpp)**\nbeen changed. Using this tool, the attackers could overcome a password reset. The attackers modified their\ntool.\n\n**Customized Windows Credentials Dumper – A PowerShell password dumper that is based on a** known\npassword dumping tool, using PowerShell bypass and reflective loading. The attackers specifically used it to\nobtain Outlook passwords.\n\n**Customized Outlook Credentials Dumper – Inspired by known Outlook credentials dumpers.**\n\n**Mimikatz – PowerShell and Binary versions, with multiple layers of obfuscation.**\n\n[Please see the Attacker’s Arsenal section for detailed analysis of the tools.](https://www2.cybereason.com/asset/59:research-cobalt-kitty-attackers-arsenal)\n\nAn analysis of this arsenal shows that the attackers went out of their way to restore the PowerShell-based\ninfrastructure, even though it had already been detected and shut down once. The attackers’ preference to use a\nfileless infrastructure specifically in conjunction with Cobalt Strike is very evident. This could suggest that the\nattackers preferred to use known tools that are more expendable rather than using their own custom-built tools,\nwhich were used as a last resort.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOperation Cobalt Kitty was a major cyber espionage APT that targeted a global corporation in Asia and was carried\nout by the OceanLotus Group. The analysis of this APT proves how determined and motivated the attackers were.\nThey continuously changed techniques and upgraded their arsenal to remain under the radar. In fact, they never\ngave up, even when the attack was exposed and shut down by the defenders.\n\nDuring the investigation of Operation Cobalt Kitty, Cybereason uncovered and analyzed new tools in the OceanLotus\nGroup’s attack arsenal, such as:\n\nNew backdoor (“Goopy”) using HTTP and DNS Tunneling for C2 communication.\n\nUndocumented backdoor that used Outlook for C2 communication and data exfiltration.\n\nBackdoors exploiting DLL sideloading attacks in legitimate applications from Microsoft, Google and\nKaspersky.\n\nThree customized credential dumping tools, which are inspired by known tools.\n\n[In addition, Cybereason uncovered new variants of the “Denis” backdoor and managed to attribute the backdoor to](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\nthe OceanLotus Group – a connection that had not been publicly reported before.\n\nThis report provides a rare deep dive into a sophisticated APT that was carried out by one of the most fascinating\ngroups operating in Asia. The ability to closely monitor and detect the stages of an entire APT lifecycle – from initial\ninfiltration to data exfiltration – is far from trivial.\n\nThe fact that most of the attackers’ tools were not detected by the antivirus software and other security products\ndeployed in the company’s environment before Cybereason, is not surprising. The attackers obviously invested\nsignificant time and effort in keeping the operation undetected, striving to evade antivirus detection.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, some of the IOCs observed in Operation Cobalt Kitty started to emerge in the wild,\n[and recently some were even reported being used in other campaigns. It is important to remember, however, that](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html)\nIOC h t d t h ti Th f d t di th t t ’ b h i l tt i\n\n\n-----\n\nfingerprints also played an important role in tying Operation Cobalt Kitty to the OceanLotus Group.\n\nLastly, our research provides an important testimony to the capabilities and working methods of the OceanLotus\nGroup. Operation Cobalt Kitty is unique in many ways, nonetheless, it is still just one link in the group’s evergrowing chain of APT campaigns. Orchestrating multiple APT campaigns in parallel and attacking a broad spectrum\nof targets takes an incredible amount of resources, time, manpower and motivation. This combination is likely to be\nmore common among nation-state actors. While the are many rumours and speculations circulating in the InfoSec\ncommunity, at the time of writing, there was no publicly available evidence that can confirm that the OceanLotus\nGroup is a nation-state threat actor.\n\nUntil such evidence is made public, we will leave it to our readers to judge for themselves.\n\nTo be continued … Meow.\n\n[advanced persistent threat, APT, Cobalt Strike, Cybereason, Cybereason Labs, DLL hijacking, DNS Tunneling,](https://www.cybereason.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threat/)\n[fileless malware, OceanLotus Group, Operation Cobalt Kitty, Powershell](https://www.cybereason.com/tag/fileless-malware/)\n\n### Check out more research from Cybereason Labs\n\n[← See all lab blog posts](https://www.cybereason.com/labs-blog)\n\n\n-----",
