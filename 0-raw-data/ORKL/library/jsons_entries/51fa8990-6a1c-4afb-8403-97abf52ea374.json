Active since November 2021, the\ncampaign has distributed a malicious app through a website impersonating Shagle – a random-video-chat service that provides encrypted\ncommunications between strangers. Unlike the entirely web-based, genuine Shagle site that doesn’t offer an official mobile app to access\nits services, the copycat site only provides an Android app to download and no web-based streaming is possible.\n\n**Key points of the blogpost:**\n\nOnly one other Android campaign has been previously attributed to StrongPity.\nThis is the first time that the described modules and their functionality have been documented publicly.\nA copycat website, mimicking the Shagle service, is used to distribute StrongPity’s mobile backdoor app.\nThe app is a modified version of the open-source Telegram app, repackaged with StrongPity backdoor code.\nBased on similarities with previous StrongPity backdoor code and the app being signed with a certificate from an earlier StrongPity\ncampaign, we attribute this threat to the StrongPity APT group.\nStrongPity’s backdoor is modular, where all necessary binary modules are encrypted using AES and downloaded from its C&C\nserver, and has various spying features.\n\nThe malicious app is, in fact, a fully functional but trojanized version of the legitimate Telegram app, however, presented as the nonexistent Shagle app. We will refer to it as the fake Shagle app, the trojanized Telegram app, or the StrongPity backdoor in the rest of this\nblogpost. ESET products detect this threat as Android/StrongPity.A.\n\nThis StrongPity backdoor has various spying features: its 11 dynamically triggered modules are responsible for recording phone calls,\ncollecting SMS messages, lists of call logs, contact lists, and much more. These modules are being documented for the very first time. If\nthe victim grants the malicious StrongPity app accessibility services, one of its modules will also have access to incoming notifications and\nwill be able to exfiltrate communication from 17 apps such as Viber, Skype, Gmail, Messenger as well as Tinder.\n\nThe campaign is likely very narrowly targeted, since ESET telemetry still doesn’t identify any victims. During our research, the analyzed\nversion of malware available from the copycat website was not active anymore and it was no longer possible to successfully install it and\ntrigger its backdoor functionality because StrongPity hasn’t obtained its own API ID for its trojanized Telegram app. But that might change\nat any time should the threat actor decide to update the malicious app.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis StrongPity campaign centers around an Android backdoor delivered from a domain containing the word “dutch”. This website\nimpersonates the legitimate service named Shagle at shagle.com. In Figure 1 you can see the home pages of both websites. The\nmalicious app is provided directly from the impersonating website and has never been made available from the Google Play store. It is a\ntrojanized version of the legitimate Telegram app, presented as if it were the Shagle app, although there is currently no official Shagle\nAndroid app.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Comparing the legitimate website on the left and the copycat on the right_\n\nAs you can see in Figure 2, the HTML code of the fake site includes evidence that it was copied from the legitimate shagle.com site on\n[November 1, 2021, using the automated tool HTTrack. The malicious domain was registered on the same day, so the copycat site andst](https://www.httrack.com/)\nthe fake Shagle app may have been available for download since that date.\n\n_Figure 2. Logs generated by the HTTrack tool recorded in the fake website’s HTML code_\n\n### Victimology\n\n\nOn July 18, 2022, one of our YARA rules at VirusTotal was triggered when a malicious app and a link to a website mimicking shagle.comth\n[were uploaded. At the same time, we were notified on Twitter about that sample, although it was mistakenly attributed to Bahamut. ESET](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1549125906416943108)\ntelemetry data still does not identify any victims, suggesting the campaign is likely to have been narrowly targeted.\n\n### Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nThe APK distributed by the copycat Shagle website is signed with the same code signing certificate (see Figure 3) as a trojanized Syrian\n[e-gov app discovered in 2021 by Trend Micro, which was also attributed to StrongPity.](https://www.trendmicro.com/ru_ru/research/21/g/strongpity-apt-group-deploys-android-malware-for-the-first-time.html)\n\n_Figure 3. This certificate signed the fake Shagle app and the trojanized Syrian e-gov app_\n\nMalicious code in the fake Shagle app was seen in the previous mobile campaign by StrongPity, and implements a simple, but functional,\nbackdoor. We have seen this code being used only in campaigns conducted by StrongPity. In Figure 4 you can see some of the added\nmalicious classes with many of the obfuscated names even being the same in the code from both campaigns.\n\n_Figure 4. Class name comparison of the trojanized Syrian e-gov app (left) and the trojanized Telegram app (right)_\n\n\n-----\n\nComparing the backdoor code from this campaign to that from the trojanized Syrian e gov app (SHA 1:\n5A5910C2C9180382FCF7A939E9909044F0E8918B), it has extended functionality but with the same code being used to provide similar\nfunctions. In Figure 5 and Figure 6 you can compare the code from both samples that is responsible for sending messages between\ncomponents. These messages are responsible for triggering the backdoor’s malicious behavior. Hence, we strongly believe that the fake\nShagle app is linked to the StrongPity group.\n\n_Figure 5. Message dispatcher responsible for triggering malicious functionality in the trojanized Syrian e-gov app_\n\n_Figure 6. Message dispatcher responsible for triggering malicious functionality in the fake Shagle app_\n\n## Technical analysis\n\n### Initial access\n\nAs described in the Overview section of this blogpost, the fake Shagle app has been hosted at the Shagle copycat website, from which\nvictims had to choose to download and install the app. There was no subterfuge suggesting the app was available from Google Play and\nwe do not know how potential victims were lured to, or otherwise discovered, the fake website.\n\n### Toolset\n\nAccording to the description on the copycat website, the app is free and intended to be used to meet and chat with new people. However,\nthe downloaded app is a maliciously patched Telegram app, specifically Telegram version 7.5.0 (22467), which was available for download\naround February 25, 2022.th\n\nThe repackaged version of Telegram uses the same package name as the legitimate Telegram app. Package names are supposed to be\nunique IDs for each Android app and must be unique on any given device. This means that if the official Telegram app is already installed\non the device of a potential victim, then this backdoored version can’t be installed; see Figure 7. This might mean one of two things –\neither the threat actor first communicates with potential victims and pushes them to uninstall Telegram from their devices if it is installed, or\nthe campaign focuses on countries where Telegram usage is rare for communication.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. If the official Telegram app is already installed on the device, the trojanized version cannot be successfully installed_\n\nStrongPity’s trojanized Telegram app should have worked just as the official version does for communication, using standard APIs that are\nwell documented on the Telegram website – but the app doesn’t work anymore, so we’re unable to check.\n\nDuring our research, the current version of malware available from the copycat website was not active anymore and it was no longer\npossible to successfully install it and trigger its backdoor functionality. When we tried to sign up using our phone number, the repackaged\nTelegram app couldn’t obtain the API ID from the server, and hence did not work properly. As seen in Figure 8, the app displayed an\nAPI_ID_PUBLISHED_FLOOD error.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Error displayed during sign-up using phone number_\n\nBased on Telegram’s [error documentation, it seems that StrongPity hasn’t obtained its own API ID. Instead, it has used the sample API ID](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#using-telegrams-open-source-code)\nincluded in Telegram’s open-source code for initial testing purposes. Telegram monitors API ID usage and limits the sample API ID, so its\nuse in a released app results in the error seen in Figure 8. Because of the error, it is not possible to sign up and use the app or trigger its\nmalicious functionality anymore. This might mean that StrongPity operators didn’t think this through, or perhaps there was enough time to\nspy on victims between publishing the app and it being deactivated by Telegram for APP ID overuse. Since no new and working version of\nthe app was ever made available through the website, it might suggest that StrongPity successfully deployed the malware to its desired\ntargets.\n\nAs a result, the fake Shagle app available on the fake website at the time of our research was not active anymore. However, this might\nchange anytime should the threat actors decide to update the malicious app.\n\nComponents of, and permissions required by, the StrongPity backdoor code are appended to the Telegram app’s AndroidManifest.xml file.\nAs can be seen in Figure 9, this makes it easy to see what permissions are necessary for the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. AndroidManifest.xml with components and permissions of the StrongPity backdoor highlighted_\n\nFrom the Android manifest we can see that malicious classes were added in the org.telegram.messenger package to appear as part of\nthe original app.\n\nThe initial malicious functionality is triggered by one of three broadcast receivers that are executed after defined actions –\n[BOOT_COMPLETED,](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED) [BATTERY_LOW, or](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_BATTERY_LOW) [USER_PRESENT. After the first start, it dynamically registers additional broadcast receivers to](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_USER_PRESENT)\n[monitor SCREEN_ON,](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_SCREEN_ON) [SCREEN_OFF, and](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_SCREEN_OFF) [CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE events. The fake Shagle app then uses IPC (interprocess](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#CONNECTIVITY_ACTION)\ncommunication) to communicate between its components to trigger various actions. It contacts the C&C server using HTTPS to send\nbasic information about the compromised device and receives an AES-encrypted file containing 11 binary modules that will be dynamically\nexecuted by the parent app; see Figure 10. As seen in Figure 11, these modules are stored in the app’s internal storage,\n/data/user/0/org.telegram.messenger/files/.li/.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. StrongPity backdoor receives an encrypted file that contains executable modules_\n\n_Figure 11. Modules received from the server stored in the StrongPity backdoor’s internal storage_\n\nEach module is responsible for different functionality. The list of the module names is stored in local shared preferences in the\nsharedconfig.xml file; see Figure 12.\n\nModules are dynamically triggered by the parent app whenever necessary. Each module has its own module name and is responsible for\ndifferent functionality such as:\n\nlibarm.jar (cm module) – records phone calls\nlibmpeg4.jar (nt module) – collects text of incoming notification messages from 17 apps\nlocal.jar (fm/fp module) – collects file list (file tree) on the device\nphone.jar (ms module) – misuses accessibility services to spy on messaging apps by exfiltrating contact name, chat message, and\ndate\nresources.jar (sm module) – collects SMS messages stored on the device\nservices.jar (lo module) – obtains device location\nsystemui.jar (sy module) – collects device and system information\ntimer.jar (ia module) – collects a list of installed apps\ntoolkit.jar (cn module) – collects contact list\nwatchkit.jar (ac module) – collects a list of device accounts\nwearkit.jar (cl module) – collects a list of call logs\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. List of modules used by the StrongPity backdoor_\n\nAll obtained data is stored in the clear in /data/user/0/org.telegram.messenger/databases/outdata, before being encrypted using AES and\nsent to the C&C server, as you can see in Figure 13.\n\n_Figure 13. Encrypted user data exfiltrated to the C&C server_\n\nThis StrongPity backdoor has extended spying features compared to the first StrongPity version discovered for mobile. It can request the\nvictim to activate accessibility services and gain notification access; see Figure 14. If the victim enables them, the malware will spy on\nincoming notifications and misuses accessibility services to exfiltrate chat communication from other apps.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Malware requests, from the victim, notification access and accessibility services_\n\nWith notification access, the malware can read received notification messages coming from 17 targeted apps. Here is a list of their\npackage names:\n\nMessenger (com.facebook.orca)\nMessenger Lite (com.facebook.mlite)\nViber – Safe Chats And Calls (com.viber.voip)\nSkype (com.skype.raider)\nLINE: Calls & Messages (jp.naver.line.android)\nKik — Messaging & Chat App (kik.android)\ntango-live stream & video chat (com.sgiggle.production)\nHangouts (com.google.android.talk)\nTelegram (org.telegram.messenger)\n\n\n-----\n\nWeChat (com.tencent.mm)\nSnapchat (com.snapchat.android)\nTinder (com.tinder)\nHike News & Content (com.bsb.hike)\nInstagram (com.instagram.android)\nTwitter (com.twitter.android)\nGmail (com.google.android.gm)\nimo-International Calls & Chat (com.imo.android.imoim)\n\nIf the device is already rooted, the malware silently tries to grant permissions to WRITE_SETTINGS, WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS,\nREBOOT, MOUNT_FORMAT_FILESYSTEMS, MODIFY_PHONE_STATE, PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS,\nREAD_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE, to enable accessibility services, and to grant notification access. The StrongPity backdoor then\ntries to disable the SecurityLogAgent app (com.samsung.android.securitylogagent), which is an official system app that helps protect the\nsecurity of Samsung devices, and disables all app notifications coming from the malware itself that might be displayed to the victim in the\nfuture in case of app errors, crashes, or warnings. The StrongPity backdoor does not itself try to root a device.\n\nThe AES algorithm uses CBC mode and hardcoded keys to decrypt the downloaded modules:\n\nAES key – aaaanothingimpossiblebbb\nAES IV – aaaanothingimpos\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe mobile campaign operated by the StrongPity APT group impersonated a legitimate service to distribute its Android backdoor.\nStrongPity repackaged the official Telegram app to include a variant of the group’s backdoor code.\n\nThat malicious code, its functionality, class names, and the certificate used to sign the APK file, are the same as from the previous\ncampaign; thus we believe with high confidence that this operation belongs to the StrongPity group.\n\nAt the time of our research, the sample that was available on the copycat website was disabled due to the API_ID_PUBLISHED_FLOOD\nerror, which results in malicious code not being triggered and potential victims possibly removing the non-working app from their devices.\n\nCode analysis reveals that the backdoor is modular and additional binary modules are downloaded from the C&C server. This means that\nthe number and type of modules used can be changed at any time to fit the campaign requests when operated by the StrongPity group.\n\nBased on our analysis, this appears to be the second version of StrongPity’s Android malware; compared to its first version, it also\nmisuses accessibility services and notification access, stores collected data in a local database, tries to execute su commands, and for\nmost of the data collection uses downloaded modules.\n\n_ESET Research also offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
