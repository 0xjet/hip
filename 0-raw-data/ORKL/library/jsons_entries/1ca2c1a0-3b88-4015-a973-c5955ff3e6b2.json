According to Google TAG, these threat actors are\nNorth Koreans and they had multiple goals of establishing credibility by publishing a well\nthought of blog posts as well as interacting with researchers via Direct Messages and lure\nthem to download and run an infected Visual Studio project.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ihackbanme/status/1353870720191787010\nSome of the fake profiles were: @z0x55g, @james0x40, @br0vvnn, @BrownSec3Labs\n\n## Using a Chrome 0day to infect clients?\n\nIn their post, Google TAG, mentioned that the attackers were able to pop a fully patched\nWindows box running Chrome.\n\nFrom Google’s post:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to targeting users via social engineering, we have also observed several\ncases where researchers have been compromised after visiting the actors’ blog. In\neach of these cases, the researchers have followed a link on Twitter to a write-up\nhosted on blog.br0vvnn[.]io, and shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on\nthe researcher’s system and an in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing to an\nactor-owned command and control server. At the time of these visits, the victim\nsystems were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser\nversions.\n\n## Attacking Mobile Users?\n\nAccording to ZecOps Mobile Threat Intelligence, the same threat actor might have used an\nAndroid 0day too.\n\nIf you entered this blog from your Android or iOS devices – we would like to examine your\n[device using ZecOps Mobile DFIR tool to gather additional evidence.](https://www.zecops.com/solutions/mobile-devices-dfir)\n\n[Please contact us as soon as convenient at [email protected]](https://blog.zecops.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f7e6f6b7f455a5c504f4c115c5052)\n\n## Hear the news first\n\nOnly essential content\nNew vulnerabilities & announcements\nNews from ZecOps Research Team\n\nWe won’t spam, pinky swear 🤞\n[Follow @ZecOps](https://twitter.com/ZecOps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----",
