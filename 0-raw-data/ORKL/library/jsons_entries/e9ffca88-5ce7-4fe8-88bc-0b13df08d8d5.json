EventBot is a mobile banking trojan and infostealer that abuses Android’s\naccessibility features to steal user data from financial applications, read user SMS messages, and steal\nSMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.\nEventBot targets users of over 200 different financial applications, including banking, money transfer\n[services, and crypto-currency wallets. Those targeted include applications like Paypal Business,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paypal.merchant.client&hl=en_US) [Revolut,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolut.revolut&hl=en_US)\n[Barclays,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barclays.android.barclaysmobilebanking&hl=en_US) [UniCredit,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unicredit&hl=en_US) [CapitalOne UK,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ie.capitalone.uk&hl=en_US) [HSBC UK,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.hsbc.hsbcukmobilebanking&hl=en_US) [Santander UK,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.santander.santanderUK&hl=en_US) [TransferWise,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transferwise.android&hl=en_US) [Coinbase,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android&hl=en_US) [paysafecard,](https://twitter.com/paysafecard)\nand many more.\nIt specifically targets financial banking applications across the United States and Europe, including Italy,\nthe UK, Spain, Switzerland, France, and Germany.

This brand new malware has real\npotential to become the next big mobile malware, as it is under constant iterative improvements, abuses a\ncritical operating system feature, and targets financial applications.\nThis research gives a rare look into the process improvements malware authors make when optimizing\nbefore launch. By going on the offensive and hunting the attackers, our team was able to unearth the\nearly stages of what may be a very dangerous mobile malware.\n\n## table of contents\n\n Security Recommendations\n\nKeep your mobile device up-to-date with the latest software updates from legitimate sources.\nKeep Google Play Protect on.\nDo not download mobile apps from unofficial or unauthorized sources.

This malware appears to be newly](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/new-bank-trojan-eventbot-affects-234-financial-applications/)\ndeveloped with code that differs significantly from previously known Android malware. EventBot is under active\ndevelopment and is evolving rapidly; new versions are released every few days with improvements and new\ncapabilities.\n\nEventBot abuses Android’s accessibility feature to access valuable user information, system information, and\ndata stored in other applications. In particular, EventBot can intercept SMS messages and bypass two-factor\nauthentication mechanisms.\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus team has concluded that EventBot is designed to target over 200 different banking\nand finance applications, the majority of which are European bank and crypto-currency exchange applications.\n\nBy accessing and stealing this data, Eventbot has the potential to access key business data, including financial\ndata. [60% of devices containing or accessing enterprise data are mobile, and mobile devices tend to include a](https://www.rsaconference.com/industry-topics/blog/the-battle-to-address-mobile-threats-in-the-endpoint-security-space)\nsignificant amount of personal and business data, assuming the organization has a bring-your-own-device\npolicy in place. Mobile malware is a significant risk for organizations and consumers alike, and must be\nconsidered when protecting personal and business data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Applications targeted by EventBot._\n\n_Cybereason Mobile detecting EventBot._\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nThough EventBot is not currently on the Google Play Store, we were able to find several icons EventBot is\nusing to masquerade as a legitimate application. We believe that, when it is officially released, it will most likely\nbe uploaded to rogue APK stores and other shady websites, while masquerading as real applications.\n\n_Icons used for EventBot masqueraded as legitimate with these icons.application._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware Capabilities**\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus team has been following EventBot since the beginning of March 2020. The team\nhas encountered different versions of the malware over time as it has rapidly evolved. At the time of writing this\nresearch, four versions of the EventBot malware were observed: Version 0.0.0.1, 0.0.0.2, and 0.3.0.1 and\n0.4.0.1. Each version expands the bot’s functionality and works to obfuscate the malware against analysis. In\nthis research, we review common features of the malware and examine the improvements the threat actor\nmade in each version.\n\n## Common Features\n\n**Permissions**\n\n[When installed, EventBot requests the following permissions on the device:](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission)\n\n**SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - allow the app to create windows that are shown on top of other apps.**\n**READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - read from external storage.**\n**REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES - make a request to install packages.**\n**INTERNET - open network sockets.**\n**REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - whitelist the app to allow it to ignore battery**\noptimizations.\n**WAKE_LOCK - prevent the processor from sleeping and dimming the screen.**\n**ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - allow the app to access information about networks.**\n**REQUEST_COMPANION_RUN_IN_BACKGROUND - let the app run in the background.**\n**REQUEST_COMPANION_USE_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND - let the app use data in the background.**\n**RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - allow the application to launch itself after system boot. EventBot uses**\nthis permission in order to achieve persistence and run in the background as a service.\n**RECEIVE_SMS - allow the application to receive text messages.**\n**READ_SMS - allow the application to read text messages.**\n\n_EventBot’s permissions as seen in the manifest file._\n\n**The Initial Installation Process**\n\n[Once installed, EventBot prompts the user to give it access to accessibility services.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270583698_On_Malware_Leveraging_the_Android_Accessibility_Framework)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Initial request by EventBot to run as a service._\n\nOnce the malware can use accessibility services, it has the ability to operate as a keylogger and can retrieve\nnotifications about other installed applications and content of open windows.\n\n_EventBot’s request to use accessibility services._\n\nIn more up-to-date versions of Android, EventBot will ask for permissions to run in the background before\ndeleting itself from the launcher.\n\n\n-----\n\n_EventBot requests permissions to always run in the background._\n\n**Download and Update the Target Configuration File**\n\nBy analyzing and decoding the HTTP packets in EventBot Version 0.0.0.1, we can see that EventBot\ndownloads and updates a configuration file with almost 200 different financial application targets. Following is\nthe HTTP response from the C2 server, containing the encrypted configuration:\n\n_Encrypted HTTP response returned from the C2._\n\nIn Version 0.0.0.1, the communication with the C2 is encrypted using Base64 and RC4. The RC4 key is\nhardcoded in EventBot. Upon decryption, we can see that the response from the server is a JSON object of\nEventBot’s configuration, which contains C2 URLs and a targeted applications list.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decrypted EventBot configuration returned from the C2._\n\nThe configuration file contains a list of financial applications that can be targeted by EventBot. This version\nincludes 185 different applications, including official applications of worldwide banks. 26 of the targeted\napplications are from Italy, 25 are from the UK, 6 are from Germany, 5 are from France, and 3 are from Spain.\nHowever, it also targets applications from Romania, Ireland, India, Austria, Switzerland, Australia, Poland and\nthe USA. In addition to official banking applications, the target list includes 111 other global financial\napplications for banking and credit card management, money transfers, and cryptocurrency wallets and\n[exchanges. Those targeted include Paypal Business,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paypal.merchant.client&hl=en_US) [Revolut,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolut.revolut&hl=en_US) [Barclays,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barclays.android.barclaysmobilebanking&hl=en_US) [UniCredit,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unicredit&hl=en_US) [CapitalOne UK,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ie.capitalone.uk&hl=en_US) [HSBC UK,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.hsbc.hsbcukmobilebanking&hl=en_US)\n[Santander UK,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.santander.santanderUK&hl=en_US) [TransferWise,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transferwise.android&hl=en_US) [Coinbase,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android&hl=en_US) [paysafecard, and many more. The full list of banking applications](https://twitter.com/paysafecard)\ntargeted is included in the appendix.\n\n**Abuse of Accessibility Services**\n\nEventBot [abuses the accessibility services of Android devices for the majority of its activity. Accessibility](https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/how-are-we-doing-with-androids-overlay-attacks-in-2020/)\nfeatures are typically used to help users with disabilities by giving the device the ability to write into input fields,\nauto-generate permissions, perform gestures for the user, etc. However, when used maliciously, accessibility\nfeatures can be used to exploit legitimate services for malicious purposes, like with EventBot. EventBot uses\nmultiple methods to exploit accessibility events for webinjects and other information stealing purposes.\n\n**Data Gathering**\n\n**Getting a list of all installed applications: Once EventBot is installed on the target machine,**\nit lists all the applications on the target machine and sends them to the C2.\n\n**Device information: EventBot queries for device information like OS, model, etc, and also sends that to**\nthe C2.\n\n_Information gathered about the infected device to be sent to the C2._\n\n**Data encryption: In the initial version of EventBot, the data being exfiltrated is encrypted using**\nBase64 and RC4. In later versions, another encryption layer is added using Curve25519 encryption.\n[All of the most recent versions of EventBot contain a ChaCha20 library that can improve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant)\nperformance when compared to other algorithms like RC4 and AES. This implies that the authors\nare actively working to optimize EventBot over time.\n**SMS grabbing: EventBot has the ability to parse SMS messages by using the targeted device’s**\nSDK version to parse them correctly\n\n\n-----\n\n_Parsing of grabbed SMS messages._\n\n**Webinjects: According to the bot’s configuration, if a webinject is set for a given application, it will**\nbe executed.\n\n_Web injects execution method by a pre-established configuration._\n\n**Bot Updates**\n\nEventBot has a long method called parseCommand that can update EventBot’s configuration XML files, located\nin the [shared preferences folder on the device.](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences)\n\n_Dropped XML configuration files on the device._\n\nEventBot uses this function to update its C2s, the configuration of webinjects, etc. The following code shows\nEventBot parsing instructions sent from the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Parsing of instructions by the bot from the C2 ._\n\n## Unique Features by Version\n\n**EventBot Version 0.0.0.1**\n\nRC4 and Base64 Packet Encryption\n\n_RC4 and Base64 data decryption from the C2._\n\nAs mentioned above, EventBot Version 0.0.0.1 sends a JSON object containing the Android package names of\nall the apps installed on the victim’s device alongside additional metadata, including the bot version, botnetID,\nand the reason this package is sent For this particular packet the reason is registration of the bot If the\n\n\n-----\n\nconnection to the C2 fails, it will continue to retry until it is successful.\n\n_Logcat from the infected device._\n\n**EventBot Version 0.0.0.2**\n\nDynamic Library Loading\n\nAs of Version 0.0.0.2, EventBot attempts to hide its main functionality from static analysis. With Version 0.0.0.1,\nthere is a dedicated functions class where all main malicious activity happens and can be observed. Instead, in\nVersion 0.0.0.2, EventBot dynamically loads its main module.\n\n_Loaded library as seen in Logcat._\n\nBy browsing EventBot’s installation path on the device, we can see the library dropped in the app_dex folder.\n\n_The loaded library dropped on the device._\n\nThe code to load the main module dynamically can also be seen statically. The malicious library is loaded from\nEventbot’s assets that contain a font file called default.ttf which is actually the hidden library and then decoded\nusing RC4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The method responsible for the library loading._\n\nEventBot has the ability to update its library or potentially even download a second library when given a\ncommand from the C2. An updated library name is generated by calculating the md5sum of several device\nproperties, while concatenating the build model twice in case of an update to the library.\n\n_Updated library naming convention_\n\n_New library naming convention._\n\nData Encryption\n\nThe [Curve25519 encryption algorithm was implemented as of EventBot Version 0.0.0.2. This encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519)\nalgorithm is an extra security layer for communicating with the C2, an improvement over the previous version of\na plain RC4 encryption. When reviewing the decrypted packet, it’s clear it has the same content as previous\nversions.\n\n_Decryption of packets from the C2 using Curve25519._\n\n\n-----\n\n**EventBot Version 0.3.0.1**\n\nAdditional Assets Based on Country / Region\n\n_Images in Spanish and Italian added in version 0.3.0.1._\n\nVersion 0.3.0.1 includes Italian and Spanish language compatibility within the resources section. Presumably,\nthis was done to make the app seem more credible to targeted users in different countries.\n\nGrabbing the Screen PIN with Support for Samsung Devices\n\nVersion 0.3.0.1 added an ~800 line long method called grabScreenPin, which uses accessibility features to\ntrack pin code changes in the device’s settings. It listens to events like _[TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED. We](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityEvent#TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED)_\nsuspect the updated PIN is sent to the C2, most likely to give the malware the option to perform privileged\nactivities on the infected device related to payments, system configuration options, etc.\n\n_Listening to TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED accessibility event._\n\nAfter collecting the changed PIN code, it is sent back to the C2.\n\n_Sending the pin code back to the C2._\n\nEventually, the screen PIN preferences will be saved to an additional XML file in the shared preferences folder.\n\n_The content of screenPinPrefs.xml._\n\nThe grabScreenPin method has separate conditioning to handle screen lock events in Samsung devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A new method to handle screen lock with support for Samsung devices._\n\n**EventBot Version 0.4.0.1**\n\nPackage Name Randomization\n\nIn this version, the package name is no longer named ‘com.example.eventbot’, which makes it more difficult to\ntrack down.\n\n_Randomized package name instead of com.example.eventbot._\n\nProGuard Obfuscation\n\nAs with many other Android applications, EventBot is now using obfuscation. Both the loader and dropped\n[class are obfuscated using ProGuard, which obfuscates names using alphabet letters. The code itself is not](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/07/obfuscation-android-malware-and-how-fight-back)\nmodified by this type of obfuscation though, making the analysis easier.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obfuscated class names using letters of the alphabet._\n\nHidden Configuration Data\n\nAs mentioned above, EventBot begins using obfuscation. Due to this obfuscation, a part of the previously\nmentioned cfg class is now mapped to c/b/a/a/a or c/a/a/a/a.\n\n_C2 URLs and other settings in a nested class._\n\nOther configuration data is located elsewhere, and some of it can been seen here:\n\nThe encrypted library path\n\nThe output folder on the device for the dropped library\nThe name of the library after it is loaded\n\neventBot name string\n\nVersion number\nA string used as an RC4 key, both for decrypting the library and as a part of the network data\nencryption (hasn’t changed from the previous version)\nThe C2 URLs\nA randomized class name using the device’s accessibility services\n\n\n-----\n\n_Part of the extracted configuration of the new version._\n\n## Malware Under Active Development\n\n_EventBot “cfg” class._\n\nEventBot is in constant development, as seen with the botnetID string above, which shows consecutive\nnumbering across versions. This example is from a later version of EventBot, and in other versions the naming\nconvention is very similar, with bot IDs such as word100, word101, word102, and test2005, test2006 etc. In the\nlatest version, a layer of obfuscation was added, perhaps taking the malware one step closer to being fully\noperational.\n\n## Suspected Detection Tests by the Threat Actor\n\nIn searching for EventBot, we’ve identified multiple submissions from the same submitter hash, 22b3c7b0:\n\n_The 22b3c7b0 submitter hash that submitted most of the EventBot samples to VirusTotal._\n\nThis submitter has thousands of other submissions in VirusTotal, however, it is the only one that continues to\nsubmit EventBot samples via the VirusTotal API. Also, the botnet IDs increment over time as they are\nsubmitted. Given this, and the naming convention of the submissions (<hash>.virus), the submitter hash most\nlikely belongs to an AV vendor or sandboxing environment that automatically submits samples to online\nmalware databases. It may be that these submissions are made from the author’s machine, or that they submit\nit to a detection service that in turn submits to online malware databases.\n\n## EventBot Threat Actors\n\nAs a part of this investigation, the Cybereason Nocturnus team has attempted to identify the threat actors\nbehind the development of EventBot. The evidence above suggests that EventBot is still in the development\nstage, and as such, is not likely to have been used for large attack campaigns thus far.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus team is monitoring multiple underground platforms in an attempt to identify chatter\nrelating to EventBot. New malware is often introduced to underground communities by being promoted and\nsold or offered as a giveaway. However, at the time of writing, we were unable to identify relevant conversations\nabout the EventBot malware. This strengthens our suspicion that this malware is still undergoing development\nand has not been officially marketed or released yet.\n\n## EventBot Infrastructure\n\nBy mapping the C2 servers, a clear, repeated pattern emerges based on the specific URL\n_gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c. As of this writing, all the domains were registered recently and some are already_\noffline.\n\n**URL** **Status** **IP** **Domain**\n**registration**\n**date**\n\nhttp://ora.studiolegalebasili[.]com/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c offline 31.214.157[.]6 2020-02-29\n\nhttp://themoil[.]site/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c online 208.91.197[.]91 2020-03-04\n\nhttp://ora.carlaarrabitoarchitetto[.]com/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c offline 31.214.157[.]6 2020-03-26\n\nhttp://rxc.rxcoordinator[.]com/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c online 185.158.248[.]102 2020-03-29\n\nhttp://ora.blindsidefantasy[.]com/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c online 185.158.248[.]102 2020-04-02\n\nhttp://marta.martatovaglieri[.]it/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c online 185.158.248[.]102 2020-04-14\n\nhttp://pub.douglasshome[.]com/gate_cb8a5aea1ab302f0_c online 185.158.249[.]141 2020-04-26\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the team discovered a potential link to an additional Android infostealer. The\nIP address of both ora.carlaarrabitoarchitetto[.]com and ora.studiolegalebasili[.]com, 31.214.157[.]6, was\npreviously hosting the domain next.nextuptravel[.]com. This was the C2 for an Android infostealer responsible\nfor several attacks in Italy [back in late 2019.](https://www.cert-pa.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CERT-PA-B007-191121.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n_VirusTotal search for the malicious IP address._\n\n## Impact\n\nEventBot is a mobile malware banking trojan that steals financial information, is able to hijack transactions.\nOnce this malware has successfully installed, it will collect personal data, passwords, keystrokes, banking\ninformation, and more. This information can give the attacker access to personal and business bank accounts,\npersonal and business data, and more.\n\n[Letting an attacker get access to this kind of data can have severe consequences. 60% of devices containing](https://www.rsaconference.com/industry-topics/blog/the-battle-to-address-mobile-threats-in-the-endpoint-security-space)\nor accessing enterprise data are mobile. Giving an attacker access to a mobile device can have severe\nbusiness consequences, especially if the end user is using their mobile device to discuss sensitive business\ntopics or access enterprise financial information. This can result in brand degradation, loss of individual\nreputation, or loss of consumer trust.\n\n[Much like we have seen in recent months, anyone can be impacted by a mobile device attack. These attacks](https://www.teiss.co.uk/jeff-bezos-phone-hack/)\n[are only becoming more common, with one third of all malware now targeting mobile endpoints. Care and](https://www.zimperium.com/mobile-malware)\nconcern both for using a mobile device and for securing a mobile device is critical, especially for those\norganizations that allow bring-your-own-devices.\n\n## Cybereason Mobile\n\nCybereason Mobile detects EventBot and immediately takes remediation actions to protect the end user. With\nCybereason Mobile, analysts can address mobile threats in the same platform as traditional endpoint threats,\nall as part of one incident. Without mobile threat detection, this attack would not be detected, leaving end users\nand organizations at risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cybereason Mobile detects EventBot and provides the user with immediate actions._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this research, the Nocturnus team has dissected a rapidly evolving Android malware in the making. This\nmalware abuses the Android accessibility feature to steal user information and is able to update its code and\nrelease new features every few days. With each new version, the malware adds new features like dynamic\nlibrary loading, encryption, and adjustments to different locales and manufacturers. EventBot appears to be a\ncompletely new malware in the early stages of development, giving us an interesting view into how attackers\ncreate and test their malware.\n\nCybereason classifies EventBot as a mobile banking trojan and infostealer based on the stealing features\ndiscussed in this research. It leverages webinjects and SMS reading capabilities to bypass two-factor\nauthentication, and is clearly targeting financial applications.\n\nAlthough the threat actor responsible for the development of EventBot is still unknown and the malware does\nnot appear to be involved in major attacks, it is interesting to follow the early stages of mobile malware\ndevelopment. The Cybereason Nocturnus team will continue to monitor EventBot’s development.\n\nIn recent years, online activity has gradually been shifting from personal computers to mobile devices.\nNaturally, this resulted in the introduction of malware for mobile platforms, especially Android devices, including\n[Cerberus,](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/cerberus-a-new-banking-trojan-from-the-underworld.html) [Xhelper and the](https://www.cisomag.com/mysterious-malware-infects-over-45000-android-phones/) [Anubis Banking Trojan.
