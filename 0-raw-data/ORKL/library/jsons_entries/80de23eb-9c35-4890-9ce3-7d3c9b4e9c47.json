Security researchers first reported a new\nbanking Trojan known as \"IcedID\" [1] in November 2017. At the time of discovery, IcedID\nwas being distributed by Emotet, another well-known banking trojan malware. In late\nFebruary and throughout March 2018, we noticed an increase in infections from IcedID being\ndetected throughout the AMP ecosystem. Like in November 2017, some of the infections\ncould be traced to Emotet, but this time, many detections could instead be traced to emails\nwith attached malicious Microsoft Word documents containing macros. When the malicious\ndocuments are opened and the macros are enabled, Ursnif/Dreambot, another trojan, would\nbe downloaded and executed, which subsequently downloads IcedID. In addition to\nUrsnif/Dreambot, many of the samples downloaded a second payload, a Bytecoin miner\n(Bytecoin is a crypto currency similar to bitcoin).\n\nUrsnif/Dreambot is financially motivated malware that is known to download and install\nadditional modules, or other malware families. This Ursnif/Dreambot/IcedID attack was\ninteresting for two reasons:\n\n1. The targeted nature of the emails that use spear-phishing techniques to entice victims\n\ninto opening the malicious Microsoft Word documents.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. The minimalist code injection technique used by IcedID that improves on existing code\n\ninjection techniques, and is harder to detect.\n\nFigure 1: Malicious document that installs Ursnif/Dreambot and IcedID banker attached to\nspear-phishing emails\n\nUse of spear-phishing emails\n\nAt first, this attack appeared to be similar to the countless malicious Microsoft Word\ndocuments with macros that Cisco blocks every day. In this case, when the documents are\nopened, users are enticed to enable macros in order to view the content. If the user enables\nmacros within the document, an auto-close macro is triggered when the user closes the\ndocument that executes mshta.exe (a built-in Windows component) to download and\nexecute a remote script. The remote script launches two instances of PowerShell to\ndownload and execute the Ursnif/Dreambot/IcedID and Bytecoin miner payloads.\n\nThis attack became more interesting when the targeted nature of the emails and the file\nnames of email attachments were investigated.\n\nWidely distributed malware families that spread over email (like Ursnif/Dreambot) generally\nsend out their malicious messages in high volume. Most end-user security training programs\ncenter around helping users identify these kinds of emails, and to be suspicious of any\nunexpected emails. An attacker sending emails in large volumes has typically chosen email\ncontent that applies to a wide range of different recipients, but will not immediately be viewed\nas suspicious. For example, attackers have recently been using email content such as job\napplications with attached resumes, shipment delivery notifications with attached tracking\ninformation, or notices for payment with attached invoices. In contrast, spear-phishing\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks use emails that are much more targeted at the recipient, and contain information\nfamiliar to the recipient. Previously, spear-phishing was primarily used by advanced\npersistent threat (APT) actors who had specific targets.\n\nUrsnif/Dreambot/IcedID is a clear example of the evolution of spear-phishing from exclusive\nuse by APT actors, to use by malware families with wide distribution. For example, one of the\nUrsnif/Dreambot distribution emails had the following features:\n\nThe email was sent to an employee of a city in the state of Arkansas.\nThe email's subject referenced a meeting relevant to city business.\nThe email's body referenced and discussed the meeting, as well as containing names\nof employees that work at the city.\nThe name of the document attached to the email included the name of a civil\nengineering company local to Arkansas.\n\nA similar example to the one above was found in a malicious email received by an electrical\ncompany in Raleigh, North Carolina. The file name of the attached document included the\nname of an engineering company also local to North Carolina.\n\nNot all examples were as highly targeted to a specific business, but rather targeted users in\na similar industry. For example, users with email addresses related to the automotive\nindustry received emails with an attachment file name that referenced the name of a car\ndealership in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe use of spear-phishing techniques to create emails containing references to people or\nbusinesses that the recipient is familiar with makes it more likely that the user will open the\nattachment and enable the macros within. Since spear-phishing emails require the attacker\nto create emails for each target, there is a higher cost to the attacker to launch this kind of\nattack, but will pay off if the attacker invests the time necessary.\n\nMinimalist code injection\n\nOnce launched, IcedID takes advantage of an interesting technique to inject malicious code\ninto svchost.exe — it does not require starting the target process in a suspended state, and\nis achieved by only using the following functions:\n\nkernel32!CreateProcessA\nntdll!ZwAllocateVirtualMemory\nntdll!ZwProtectVirtualMemory\nntdll!ZwWriteVirtualMemory\n\nIcedID's code injection into svchost.exe works as follows:\n\n1. In the memory space of the IcedID process, the function ntdll!ZwCreateUserProcess is\n\nhooked.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. The function kernel32!CreateProcessA is called to launch svchost.exe and the\n\nCREATE_SUSPENDED flag is not set.\n3. The hook onntdll!ZwCreateUserProcess is hit as a result of calling\n\nkernel32!CreateProcessA. The hook is then removed, and the actual function call to\nntdll!ZwCreateUserProcess is made.\n\n1. At this point, the malicious process is still in the hook, the svchost.exe process has\n\nbeen loaded into memory by the operating system, but the main thread of svchost.exe\nhas not yet started.\n\n1. The call to ntdll!ZwCreateUserProcess returns the process handle for svchost.exe.\n\nUsing the process handle, the functions ntdll!NtAllocateVirtualMemory and\nntdll!ZwWriteVirtualMemory can be used to write malicious code to the svchost.exe\nmemory space.\n2. In the svchost.exe memory space, the call to ntdll!RtlExitUserProcess is hooked to\n\njump to the malicious code already written\n3. The malicious function returns, which continues the code initiated by the call\n\ntokernel32!CreateProcessA, and the main thread of svchost.exe will be scheduled to\nrun by the operating system.\n4. The malicious process ends.\n\nSince svchost.exe has been called with no arguments, it would normally immediately shut\ndown because there is no service to launch. However, as part of its shutdown, it will call\nntdll!RtlExitUserProcess, which hits the malicious hook, and the malicious code will take over\nat this point.\n\n_Video: Identifying and analyzing IcedID’s minimalist injection technique (6:04)_\n\nMalware authors are constantly looking for more surreptitious ways to inject code into benign\nprocesses. Process doppelganging, a fileless code injection technique, [2] and atom\nbombing, a technique which uses atom tables for writing into memory of another process, [3]\nare examples of completely new classes of code injection techniques malware authors have\nrecently found and leveraged. The minimalist process injection technique used by IcedID is\nan evolution of existing process injection techniques [4], rather than an entirely new class of\ntechnique.\n\nMinimalist code injection does offer the following improvements over known techniques:\n\nRequires only four Windows API calls to achieve code injection.\nDoes not require the created process to be created in a suspended state.\nDoes not require new threads to be created in the target process.\n\nUsing fewer functions and less suspicious process-creation flags makes this minimalist code\ninjection technique more difficult for security solutions to detect.\n\n\n-----\n\nDetection\n\nCisco AMP for Endpoints' new exploit prevention engine offers protection against both\nUrsnif/Dreambot and IcedID. While neither Ursnif/Dreambot nor IcedID contain actual\nexploits, both are detected and blocked by the AMP exploit prevention engine because of\nsuspicious access to memory that each performs. In the case of Ursnif/Dreambot, memory\nmanipulation done by its unpacking routine is detected. In the case of IcedID, when it\nperforms the minimalist memory injection technique, it is detected when it attempts to place\nthe hook on the ntdll!ZwCreateUserProcess function.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe use of spear-phishing emails targeted at specific organizations and industries by\nUrsnif/Dreambot/IcedID show that widely distributed malware families are adapting to an\nenvironment of improved defenses. As detection methods improve, and users become more\nskilled at identifying suspicious emails, attackers who could once send the same malicious\nemail to all their targets are having to improve their techniques. But the use of the minimalist\ncode injection technique by IcedID shows that attackers are changing their techniques postinfection to better hide and remain on systems that older injection techniques would likely\nhave been detected on.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n[Network Security appliances such asNGFW,NGIPS, andMeraki MX can detect malicious](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html)\nactivity associated with this threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\nOpen Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the\n[latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.](https://www.snort.org/products)\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nMalicious Document\nb0457ecdcc1940850af6d858e2f2e91e555a71f250f53b7ba9d4434a81810032\n\nUrsnif/Dreambot\n5916b8c0c0668d106ebfcad97eb5c90687c873a732eb61f00e5d7033f8fd85ed\n\nIcedID\n\nUnpacked IcedID binary demonstrating injection\nd5164e296c7e7a0c3b2a9e34f07bebcdd0ab7df9ab63ca7dffac6d65e60b0b25\n(see hook on ntdll!ZwCreateUserProcess at 0x4016a6)\n\nAdditional IcedID binaries\n\n0bd92149834e083320bc5a51f21ac768e26a115c0d589aae22d56ce4c5cf2330\n0ca2971ffedf0704ac5a2b6584f462ce27bac60f17888557dc8cd414558b479e\n0ea7f227bcbc0b7cd9d1d951a8dfde56f8d18989e4f4c2b0290246e282a14842\n107f44919999afc3ddf9c8d1e552ca8463c71ac53fbeaf62ab7de80aba796e15\n1f8b4e2ef4c318625447884156be50691555e409242252e504ab15ade5bba4d8\n24bde557761930ec48a6573c2f7f538be784652e7c55224ba474e443bd1d8c55\n4c851e40390df6021c8396c9141d50b52d2dc027586a2edb5f682707987adfad\n64f3abc5b0b65cd4bca68b3200cf2d645d3557fbc6dfe36a127734c3ce436860\n693599aa847dece5b5cfcca5d545fe5f3f87e5acd10ed807e731741ee306ab4c\n70e2782079e95e312d7e2de69a6ac0f56874caaf021e1e3f45750f62b7d386ff\n7700fe76b40bc4a0f1b93ae32b9f34c595ef0e2886632e26ebf5f43be1aea63c\n7c89b72451f7361cc3f120d0c38287fe5acc9f6e8210279cfe09318d6fe92869\n8408fd2fab0b7fce952d6338164040eeb5ae910cbf355ea41f798e04998507bc\n84a664fd2ca39c0a7258bed6f8d3e707bcf6c597bb4f94401940b4e005578dae\n84ecae42c9c88ae5c2bdf51d546421b02d06bcf57b48b2abafdbd38d81bacfa8\n\n\n-----\n\n8ce7889ca54f6c480ee3534fbeb2383779583e258b1e4ac5b851b578a40bc31f\n9426acf9edf6479374905b743ab0a550183c2b1869af1a8da2bb69a25e2cad1e\n995de239c8160435f50675d42a20cf773e6a3e10c8812f4d680114170e07f914\n9b5930266d5494553f3801d62d7ef20dc866fadda0ee654da85e01042aa91338\na5779442a31d66407cec78d1d58832a847d5929587cb22b8ad7459f4a28deeef\na88f9196456011043bd404377146f7443550a6f11a08fcfac29a55273bd75509\nda1e9b6766b9a6445c77ac522a73cc763be2f2500fb1ed8af63e2c47e0f884fb\ne899b27d0e241914cba36c43dfb686bf008237d10beff9114f9aad04b7c919de\ned578c318be8a671b4b3d23db9b3fc4bd031befe490543d60e6bcf0759fc51c5\nffc7479a186f1101a9e7800d8830d235ba6797dc293ade57864f2db26fa58c0f\n\nNetwork\nefoijowufjaowudawd[.]com\n86.123.64.43\n\nScheduled task\nThe existence of a scheduled task at:\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\Update\n\nThe \"Exec\" action within the scheduled task will take the command line argument \"/i\" and the\npath of the executable will be in the APPDATA directory.
