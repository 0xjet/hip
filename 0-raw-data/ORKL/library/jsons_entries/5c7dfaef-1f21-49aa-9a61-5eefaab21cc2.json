The personal phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby\n_TV was also hacked._\nThe phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call KISMET, which\nappears to involve an invisible zero-click exploit in iMessage. In July 2020, KISMET\nwas a zero-day against at least iOS 13.5.1 and could hack Apple’s then-latest iPhone\n11.\nBased on logs from compromised phones, we believe that NSO Group customers also\nsuccessfully deployed KISMET or a related zero-click, zero-day exploit between\nOctober and December 2019.\nThe journalists were hacked by four Pegasus operators, including one operator\n**_MONARCHY that we attribute to Saudi Arabia, and one operator SNEAKY KESTREL_**\nthat we attribute to the United Arab Emirates.\nWe do not believe that KISMET works against iOS 14 and above, which includes new\nsecurity protections. All iOS device owners should immediately update to the latest\nversion of the operating system.\nGiven the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability\nof almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections\nthat we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit.\n\n\n-----\n\nInfrastructure used in these attacks included servers in Germany, France, UK, and Italy\nusing cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma, and DigitalOcean.\nWe have shared our findings with Apple and they have confirmed to us they are looking\ninto the issue.\n\n## 1. Background\n\nNSO Group’s Pegasus spyware is a mobile phone surveillance solution that enables\ncustomers to remotely exploit and monitor devices. The company is a prolific seller of\nsurveillance technology to governments around the world, and its products have been\n[regularly linked to surveillance abuses.](https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group/)\n\nPegasus became known for the telltale malicious links sent to targets via SMS for many\n[years. This method was used by NSO Group customers to target Ahmed Mansoor, dozens](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\n[of members of civil society in Mexico, and political dissidents targeted by Saudi Arabia,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/)\namong others. The use of malicious links in SMSes made it possible for investigators and\ntargets to quickly identify evidence of past targeting. Targets could not only notice these\nsuspicious messages, but they could also search their message history to detect evidence of\nhacking attempts.\n\n[More recently, NSO Group is shifting towards zero-click exploits and network-based attacks](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/moroccan-journalist-targeted-with-network-injection-attacks-using-nso-groups-tools/)\n[that allow its government clients to break into phones without any interaction from the target,](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/)\n[and without leaving any visible traces. The 2019 WhatsApp breach, where at least 1,400](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/)\nphones were targeted via an exploit sent through a missed voice call, is one example of such\na shift. Fortunately, in this case, WhatsApp notified targets. However, it is more challenging\nfor researchers to track these zero-click attacks because targets may not notice anything\nsuspicious on their phone. Even if they do observe something like “weird” call behavior, the\nevent may be transient and not leave any traces on the device.\n\nThe shift towards zero-click attacks by an industry and customers already steeped in secrecy\nincreases the likelihood of abuse going undetected. Nevertheless, we continue to develop\nnew technical means to track surveillance abuses, such as new techniques of network and\ndevice analysis.\n\n### iMessage Emerges as a Zero-Click Vector\n\n[Since at least 2016, spyware vendors appear to have successfully deployed zero-click](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/12/14/the-pernicious-invisibility-of-zero-click-mobile-attacks/)\nexploits against iPhone targets at a global scale. Several of these attempts have been\nreported to be through Apple’s iMessage app, which is installed by default on every iPhone,\nMac, and iPad. Threat actors may have been aided in their iMessage attacks by the fact that\n[certain components of iMessage have historically not been sandboxed in the same way as](https://www.wired.com/story/ios-security-imessage-safari/)\nother apps on the iPhone.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, Reuters [reported that United Arab Emirates (UAE) cybersecurity company](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/)\nDarkMatter, operating on behalf of the UAE Government, purchased a zero-click iMessage\nexploit in 2016 that they referred to as “Karma,” which worked during several periods in 2016\nand 2017. The UAE reportedly used Karma to break into the phones of hundreds of targets,\n[including the chairmen of Al Jazeera and Al Araby TV.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-media/)\n\n[A 2018 Vice Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvakb3/inside-nso-group-spyware-demo) report about a Pegasus product presentation mentioned that NSO\nGroup demonstrated a zero-click method for breaking into an iPhone. While the specific\nvulnerable app in that case was not reported, a 2019 _[Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-israel-s-cyber-spy-industry-aids-dictators-hunt-dissidents-and-gays-1.6573027)_ report interviewed “Yaniv,” a\npseudonym used by a vulnerability researcher working in Israel’s offensive cyber industry,\nwho seemed to indicate that spyware was sometimes deployed to iPhones via Apple’s Push\nNotification Service (APNs), the protocol upon which iMessage is based:\n\n“An espionage program can impersonate an application you’ve downloaded to your\nphone that sends push notifications via Apple’s servers. If the impersonating program\nsends a push notification and Apple doesn’t know that a weakness was exploited and\nthat it’s not the app, it transmits the espionage program to the device.”\n\n### The Gulf Cooperation Council: A Booming Spyware Market\n\n[The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is one of the most significant customer](https://wired.me/technology/privacy/surveillance-gulf-states/) bases\n[for the commercial surveillance industry, with governments reportedly paying hefty premiums](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-with-israel-s-encouragement-nso-sold-spyware-to-uae-and-other-gulf-states-1.9093465)\nto companies that provide them special services, including analysis of intelligence that they\ncapture with the spyware. The UAE apparently became an NSO Group customer in 2013, in\n[what was described as the “next big deal” for NSO Group after its first customer, Mexico. In](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5444998,00.html)\n[2017, Saudi Arabia (which the Citizen Lab calls KINGDOM) and Bahrain (PEARL) appear to](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/)\n[have also become customers of NSO Group. Haaretz has also reported that Oman is an](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-with-israel-s-encouragement-nso-sold-spyware-to-uae-and-other-gulf-states-1.9093465)\nNSO Group customer, and that the Israeli Government prohibits NSO Group from doing\nbusiness with Qatar.\n\n### Al Jazeera and the Middle East Crisis\n\nThe relationship between Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt (jointly, “the four countries”)\nand Qatar is fractious. The four countries often claim that Qatar shelters dissidents from the\nfour countries and supports political Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood,\nwhom they view as the most serious challenge to the existing political order in the Middle\nEast.\n\n[In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors and froze](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/middleeast/3-persian-gulf-states-pull-ambassadors-from-qatar.html)\nrelations with Qatar for [eight months. A second crisis occurred on June 5, 2017, when the](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-summit-ambassadors-idUSKCN0J00Y420141116)\nfour countries [cut off diplomatic relations and closed their borders with Qatar. The crisis was](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40164552)\nostensibly precipitated by a fake story planted on the state-run Qatar News Agency (QNA) by\n\n\n-----\n\nhackers, which misquoted Qatar s Emir referring to Iran as an Islamic power, and praising\nHamas. According to US intelligence officials speaking with The _Washington Post, senior_\nUAE Government officials [approved the QNA hacking operation.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/uae-hacked-qatari-government-sites-sparking-regional-upheaval-according-to-us-intelligence-officials/2017/07/16/00c46e54-698f-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html)\n\n[On June 23, 2017, the four countries issued a joint statement which outlined 13 demands to](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/close-al-jazeera-saudi-arabia-issues-qatar-with-13-demands-to-end-blockade)\nQatar, including closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, scaling down ties with Iran, and\nshutting down Al Jazeera and its affiliate stations and news outlets.\n\n**_Al Jazeera: targeted by criticism, hacking & blocking by neighboring countries_**\n\n_Al Jazeera is somewhat distinctive in the Middle East in terms of its media coverage. On_\nmany issues, it presents alternative viewpoints not available from largely state-run media\noutlets in the region. Several other attempts at building credible media channels in the GCC\nhave been met with less success, including Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal’s highly publicized\nBahrain-based Al Arab channel, which was permanently shut down by local authorities on its\n[first day of operations after airing an interview with a member of Bahrain’s opposition Al](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/02/saudi-prince-alarab-news-channel)\nWefaq political society.\n\n_Al Jazeera’s reporting featured prominently in the Arab Spring, where its extensive, real-time_\ncoverage of protests in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya “helped propel insurgent emotions\nfrom one capital to the next.” Leaders of countries neighboring Qatar regularly express deep\nconcerns about its coverage and in some cases have taken action to limit the availability of\n[the channel in their countries. In 2017, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE blocked Al Jazeera’s](https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/24/media/al-jazeera-blocked-saudi-arabia-uae/)\nwebsite.\n\nAfter the fall of Egypt’s President Mubarak in the Arab Spring, Muslim Brotherhood leader\nMohammed Morsi was elected President of Egypt. This election was considered by Saudi\nArabia and the UAE as a threat and a sign of the expansion of Qatar’s regional influence\nbecause of Qatar’s history of support for the Muslim Brotherhood. However, Morsi was\ndeposed by a military coup on July 3, 2013 led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and taken to\nmilitary custody. One day after the coup, the military shut down a number of news stations in\nEgypt, including Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr and Al Jazeera’s bureau in Egypt, and detained\nfive of the staff.\n\nAlthough Al Jazeera’s Arabic language coverage of uprisings in neighboring Gulf countries,\n[including Bahrain, was generally seen as striking a more muted tone than its English](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/al-jazeera-tv-network-draws-criticism-praise-for-coverage-of-arab-revolutions/2011/05/08/AFoHWs2G_story.html)\nlanguage coverage, the channel was still criticized. For example, Bahrain’s Foreign Minister\n[famously tweeted the following about a documentary on the channel: “It’s clear that in Qatar](https://twitter.com/khalidalkhalifa/status/99281312271183872)\nthere are those who don’t want anything good for Bahrain. And this film on Al Jazeera\nEnglish is the best example of this inexplicable hostility.”\n\n## 2. The Attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n_This section describes the hacking of two reporters phones, Tamer Almisshal and Rania_\n_Dridi. They are among the 36 reporters and editors targeted in the attack, most of whom_\n_have requested anonymity. Almisshal and Dridi consented to be named in this report and for_\n_the Citizen Lab to describe their targeting in detail._\n\n### The 19 July 2020 Attack on Tamer Almisshal\n\nTamer Almisshal is a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language\nchannel, where he anchors the “ﻣﺎ ﺧﻔﻲ أﻋﻈﻢ” program (translated as “this is only the tip of the\n_iceberg” or “what is hidden is more immense”). Almisshal’s program has reported on a wide_\nvariety of politically sensitive topics in the Middle East, including UAE, Saudi, and Bahraini\n[Government involvement in an attempted 1996 coup in Qatar, the Bahrain Government’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcyP_b435TQ)\n[hiring of a former Al-Qaeda operative for an assassination program, the Saudi killing of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BptzscpcCBQ)\nJamal Khashoggi, and ties between a powerful member of the UAE’s Royal Family, Sheikh\nMansour Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and UAE businessman B.R. Shetty’s healthcare empire,\nwhich [collapsed in 2020 due to alleged fraud and disclosures of hidden debt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ZFA45hbP4)\n\n**[Figure 1: Tamer Almisshal (right) interviews an Istanbul taxi driver who was reportedly hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snu-0lGABUI)**\nby two members of the team that killed Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\nAlmisshal was concerned that his phone might be hacked, so in January 2020, he consented\nto installing a VPN application for Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated\nwith his Internet traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Timeline of 19 July attack on Tamer.**\nWhile reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website\nthat we had detected in our Internet scanning as an Installation Server for NSO Group’s\nPegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus.\n\n**Time: 19 July 2020, 11:29 – 11:31 UTC**\n\n**Domain:** _9jp1dx8odjw1kbkt.f15fwd322.regularhours.net_\n\n**IP: 178.128.163.233**\n\n**Downloaded: 1.74MB**\n\n**Uploaded: 211KB**\n\n**Initial Vector: Apple Servers**\n\nWe conclude that Almisshal’s phone reached out to the Pegasus Installation Server due to\nan apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers. In the 54 minutes before Almisshal’s\nphone visited the Pegasus Installation Server, we observed an unusual behavior:\nconnections to a large number of iCloud Partitions (p*-content.icloud.com). In the more than\n3000 hours that we have been monitoring Almisshal’s Internet traffic, we have only seen 258\nconnections to iCloud Partitions (excluding p20-content.icloud.com, which Almisshal’s phone\nuses for iCloud backups), with 228 of these connections (~88%) occurring during a 54\nminute period between 10:32 and 11:28 on 19 July. 1 On 19 July, we saw no matching\nconnections prior to 10:32 or after 11:28. The connections in question were to 18 iCloud\npartitions (all odd-numbered).\n\n**Figure 3: Screenshot of a 19 July packet capture from Almisshal’s phone showing DNS**\nlookups for iCloud Partitions immediately before a lookup for a Pegasus Installation Server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe connections to the iCloud Partitions on 19 July 2020 resulted in a net download of\n2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. Because these anomalous iCloud connections\noccurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation at 11:29 UTC, we believe\nthey represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked. Our analysis\nof an infected device (Section 3) indicates that the built-in iOS `imagent application was`\nresponsible for one of the spyware processes. The `imagent application is a background`\nprocess that appears to be associated with iMessage and FaceTime.\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nSixteen seconds after the last connection to the Pegasus Installation Server, we observed\nAlmisshal’s iPhone communicate for the first time with three additional IPs over the next 16\nhours. We never observed his phone communicating with these IPs previously, and have not\nobserved communications since.\n\n**Times (UTC)** **IP** **Uploaded** **Downloaded**\n\n7/19/2020 11:31 – 7/20/2020 03:09 45.76.47.218 133.06MB 7.53MB\n\n7/19/2020 11:31 – 7/20/2020 03:08 212.147.209.236 75.94MB 4.30MB\n\n7/19/2020 11:31 – 7/20/2020 03:09 134.122.87.198 61.16MB 3.32MB\n\nOverall, we observed 270.16MB of upload, and 15.15MB of download, and each IP returned\na [valid TLS certificate for bananakick.net. The phone did not set the SNI in the HTTPS Client](https://censys.io/certificates/2efca506b8caa6ecafe3ddd1249de8f10ffd977c8ee2d6e30d06691551285b43)\nHello message, nor did it perform a DNS lookup for bananakick.net, perhaps an effort to\n[thwart our previously-reported DNS Cache Probing technique to locate infected devices, or](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/)\nan effort to thwart anti-Pegasus countermeasures implemented nationwide in Turkey\n(Section 4), another popular target of Pegasus operators. Because communications with\nthese three servers commenced 16 seconds after the communications with a known\nPegasus Installation Server, we suspected that these three IPs were Pegasus command and\ncontrol (C&C) servers.\n\n**Analysis of Device Logs**\n\nAlmisshal’s device shows what appears to be an unusual number of kernel panics (phone\ncrashes) between January and July 2020. While some of the panics may be benign, they\nmay also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device.\n\n**Timestamp (UTC)** **Process** **Type of Kernel Panic**\n\n2020-01-17 01:32:09 fileproviderd Kernel data abort\n\n2020-01-17 05:19:35 mediaanalysisd Kernel data abort\n\n2020-01-31 18:04:47 launchd Kernel data abort\n\n\n-----\n\n**Timestamp (UTC)** **Process** **Type of Kernel Panic**\n\n2020-02-28 23:18:12 locationd Kernel data abort\n\n2020-03-14 03:47:14 com.apple.WebKit Kernel data abort\n\n2020-03-29 13:23:43 MobileMail kfree\n\n2020-06-27 02:04:09 exchangesyncd Kernel data abort\n\n2020-07-04 02:32:48 kernel_task Kernel data abort\n\n### A Series of Attacks on Rania Dridi\n\nRania Dridi is a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV, where she presents the “ﺷﺒﺎﺑﯿﻚ”\nnewsmagazine program (translated from Arabic as “windows”), which covers a variety of\ncurrent affairs topics.\n\n**Figure 4: Rania Dridi reporting on sexual harassment in the Arab world in an episode of**\nﺷﺒﺎﺑﯿﻚ.\nWhile reviewing device logs from Rania Dridi’s iPhone Xs Max, we found evidence that her\nphone was hacked at least six times with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware between 26\nOctober 2019 and 23 July 2020. Two of these instances, on 26 October and 12 July, were\nlikely zero-day exploits, as the phone appears to have been hacked while running the latest\navailable version of iOS. At the other times Dridi’s phone was hacked, there was a newer\nversion of iOS available, meaning that there is no evidence one way or the other as to\nwhether the exploits were zero-days.\n\n**Approx. Infection Time** **iOS Version** **Zero-Day?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Approx.

The 12 July 2020 attack, and another attack on 23 July 2020\nappear to have used the KISMET zero-click exploit.\n\nNetwork logs show that Dridi’s phone communicated with the following four servers between\n13 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 that we attributed to NSO Group operator SNEAKY\n**_KESTREL. No communications were observed between 17 July and 22 July 2020._**\n\n**Times (UTC)** **IP** **Uploaded**\n\n07/13/2020 09:13 – 07/23/2020 16:20 31.171.250.241 18.31MB\n\n07/13/2020 09:13 – 07/23/2020 16:19 165.22.80.68 15.92MB\n\n07/13/2020 09:13 – 07/23/2020 16:12 159.65.94.105 12.42MB\n\n07/13/2020 09:13 – 07/23/2020 16:09 95.179.220.244 8.43MB\n\nWe suspect that the attacks on Dridi’s phone in October, November, and December 2019\nalso used a zero-click exploit, because we saw an NSO Group zero-click exploit deployed\nagainst another iPhone target during this timeframe, and because we found no evidence of\ntelltale SMS or WhatsApp messages containing Pegasus spyware links on her phone.\nNetwork logs were unavailable for these periods.\n\n### 4. Other Infections at Al Jazeera\n\nWorking with Al Jazeera’s IT team, we identified a total of 36 personal phones inside Al\n_Jazeera that were hacked by four distinct clusters of servers which could be attributable to_\nup to four NSO Group operators.

However, we are aware of only one phone that was targeted by\n\n\n-----\n\nboth operators, and we are not aware of any infrastructructure overlap between the two\noperators.

Analysis of Device Logs from a Live Pegasus Infection\n\nWe obtained logs from an iPhone 11 device inside Al Jazeera networks while it was infected.\nOur analysis indicates that the current Pegasus implant has a number of capabilities\nincluding: recording audio from the microphone including both ambient “hot mic” recording\nand audio of encrypted phone calls, and taking pictures. In addition, we believe the implant\ncan track device location, and access passwords and stored credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Some Pegasus implant capabilities observed on an infected device.**\nThe phone logs showed a process `launchafd on the phone that was communicating with`\nthe four *.crashparadox.net IP addresses in Table 1, which we linked to SNEAKY\n**_KESTREL._**\n\nThe `launchafd process was located in flash memory in the`\n```\ncom.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging folder:\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchafd\n\n```\n\nThis folder appears to be used for iOS updates, and we suspect that it may not survive iOS\nupdates. It appeared that additional components of the spyware on this device were stored in\na folder with a randomly generated name in `/private/var/tmp/ . The contents of the`\n```\n/private/var/tmp/ folder do not persist when the device is rebooted. The parent process\n\n```\nof `launchafd was listed as` `rs, and was located in flash memory at:`\n\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/rs\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe `imagent process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was`\nlisted as the responsible process for `rs, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage`\nor FaceTime. The same `rs process was also listed as parent of` `passd, a built-in Apple`\napp that interfaces with the keychain, as well as `natgd, another component of the spyware,`\nwhich was located in flash memory at:\n\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/natgd\n\n```\n\nAll three processes were running as `root . We were unable to retrieve these binaries from`\nflash memory, as we did not have access to a jailbreak for iPhone 11 running iOS 13.5.1.\n\nThe phone’s logs show evidence that the spyware was accessing a variety of frameworks on\nthe phone, including the Celestial.framework and MediaExperience.framework which could\nbe used to record audio data and camera, as well as the LocationSupport.framework and\n_CoreLocation.framework to track the user’s location._\n\n### Sharing Findings\n\nWe have shared our findings and technical indicators with Apple Inc. which confirms that it is\ninvestigating the issue.\n\n## 4. Turkish CERT vs. NSO Group\n\nIn late 2019, Turkey’s Government-run Computer Emergency Response Team (USOM)\nappears to have observed Pegasus attacks involving both MONARCHY and SNEAKY\n**_KESTREL, and sinkholed some domain names used by these operators on a national level._**\n\n[USOM publishes a “list of malicious links” (“zararlı bağlantılar”) available on their website.](https://www.usom.gov.tr/zararli-baglantilar/1.html)\nThe list of indicators includes domain names, URLs, as well as IP addresses. Turkish ISPs\ngenerally redirect their subscribers who try to access indicators on this list to a USOM\nsinkhole IP address (88.255.216.16).\n\n**Figure 6: A Sandvine PacketLogic device on Turk Telekom’s network injects an HTTP**\nredirect to USOM’s sinkhole in response to a request directed at a Pegasus C&C server.\nEach ISP appears to implement this sinkholing using the same technique they use to\nimplement website censorship. For example, Turk Telekom appears to use their Sandvine\nPacketLogic devices to inject HTTP redirects for elements on the USOM list, whereas\nVodafone Turkey appears to use its DNS tampering system, returning the USOM IP in\nresponse to any request for a domain name on the list.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: A Vodafone Turkey DNS server responds to our lookup for an unpublished**\n**_MONARCHY Pegasus C&C domain name with USOM’s sinkhole IP address._**\nIt is clear that USOM has a particular interest in Pegasus, as all Pegasus domain names\n[published in three](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/) [Amnesty](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2019/10/morocco-human-rights-defenders-targeted-with-nso-groups-spyware/) [reports about Pegasus were added to the USOM list after](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/moroccan-journalist-targeted-with-network-injection-attacks-using-nso-groups-tools/)\nAmnesty’s publication.4\n\n### Turkish CERT Sinkholes Pegasus Domains\n\nOn 5 November 2019, USOM added the following NSO Group Pegasus domain names and\nIP addresses to their list of malicious links. We attribute these domains and IPs to\n**_MONARCHY and SNEAKY KESTREL. These indicators were not previously published in_**\nany other location that we can identify, and the USOM list indicates that the source of the\ndomains and IPs was one of Turkey’s SOMEs (institutional computer emergency response\nteams (CERTs) for government agencies and industries).\n\n**Figure 8: Pegasus domain names and IP addresses on USOM’s list of malicious links.**\nWe suspect that USOM’s information about the Pegasus infrastructure came from observing\nspecific infections, as opposed to a broader compromise of NSO Group, or a broader effort\nto fingerprint NSO Group traffic within Turkey. Several other operators that appeared to be\nspying inside Turkey with Pegasus at the time did not have their infrastructure sinkholed.\n\nWe are not aware which individuals were targeted in the attacks observed by the Turkish\n[Government that triggered the sinkholing. However, a 2019 Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/) report mentions that, in\n2016 and 2017, the UAE used the “Karma” exploit to hack hundreds of individuals around\nthe world, including the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister.5\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the IP addresses added to the USOM list on 5 November 2019 appears to have been\nabandoned by NSO Group on 28 October 2019, suggesting that at least some of the attacks\nobserved by Turkey occurred prior to 28 October. Interestingly, despite the fact that\n_regularhours.net and holdmydoor.com appeared on a Turkish CERT list in November 2019,_\nwe observed MONARCHY and SNEAKY KESTREL continue to use these domain names in\nattacks through August 2020.\n\n## 5. Discussion: The Spyware Industry is Going Dark\n\nWhen authoritarian governments are enabled by commercial spyware companies like NSO\nGroup, and emboldened by the belief that they are acting in secret, they target critical voices\nlike journalists. Unfortunately, it is increasingly difficult to track such cases.\n\nThe spyware industry does business in secret, and major spyware sellers invest heavily in\nfighting regulation and avoiding legal accountability. Yet, certain industry realities and\ntechnical limitations have historically made it possible to track infections. For example, for\nmany years all but the most sophisticated commercially available spyware required some\nuser interaction, such as opening a document or clicking a link, to infect a device.\n\nThe deception involved in tricking a target into becoming a victim left traces even after\nsuccessful infections. These traces—especially messages used to seed spyware—have\nbeen an invaluable source of evidence for investigators. Over the years, by gathering and\nexamining the ruses used to deliver spyware, often aided by victims themselves, it has been\npossible to identify hundreds of victims.\n\nThe current trend towards zero-click infection vectors and more sophisticated anti-forensic\ncapabilities is part of a broader industry-wide shift towards more sophisticated, less\ndetectable means of surveillance. Although this is a predictable technological evolution, it\nincreases the technological challenges facing both network administrators and investigators.\n\nWhile it is still possible to identify zero-click attacks—as we have done here—the technical\neffort required to identify cases markedly increases, as does the logistical complexity of\ninvestigations. As techniques grow more sophisticated, spyware developers are better able\nto obfuscate their activities, operate unimpeded in the global surveillance marketplace, and\nthus facilitate the continued abuse of human rights while evading public accountability.\n\n### Journalists Increasingly Targeted With Spyware\n\nCounting the 36 cases revealed in this report, there are now at least fifty publicly known\ncases of journalists and others in media targeted with NSO spyware, with attacks observed\n[as recently as August 2020. We have previously identified over a dozen journalists and civic](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/)\nmedia targeted with NSO Group’s spyware. Amnesty International has identified still more\n[targeting, as recently as January 2020.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/moroccan-journalist-targeted-with-network-injection-attacks-using-nso-groups-tools/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Al Jazeera attacks are part of an accelerating trend of espionage against journalists and\nnews organizations. The Citizen Lab has documented digital attacks against journalists by\nthreat actors from [China,](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/foreign-journalists-in-china-target-of-computer-attack/article1202851/) [Russia,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/) [Ethiopia,](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/hacking-team-targeting-ethiopian-journalists/) [Mexico, the](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/) [UAE, and](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon/) [Saudi Arabia, among](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/)\nothers. Other research groups have documented similar trends, which appear to be\n[worsening with the COVID-19 pandemic. Often these attacks parallel more more traditional](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/28/how-the-free-press-worldwide-is-under-threat)\nforms of media control, and in some cases physical violence.\n\nThe increased targeting of the media is especially concerning given the fragmented and\noften ad-hoc security practices and cultures among journalists and media outlets, and the\ngap between the scale of threats and the security resources made available to reporters and\nnewsrooms. These concerns are likely particularly acute for independent journalists in\nauthoritarian states who, despite the fact that they play a crucial role in reporting information\nto the public, may be forced to work in dangerous conditions with even fewer security tools at\ntheir disposal than their peers in large news organizations.\n\n**Progress, But New Perils**\n\n[Journalist security has attracted recent](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/journosec-guides) [research interest, grantmaking, and practice](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1777882)\ninnovation. Progress is showing in many areas. However, the zero-click techniques used\nagainst Al Jazeera staff were sophisticated, difficult to detect, and largely focused on the\npersonal devices of reporters. Security awareness and policies are essential, but without\nsubstantial investment in security, network analysis, regular security audits and collaboration\nwith researchers like the Citizen Lab these cases would not have been detected.\n\nJournalists and media outlets should not be forced to confront this situation on their own.\nInvestments in journalist security and education must be accompanied by efforts to regulate\nthe sale, transfer, and use of surveillance technology. As the anti-detection features of\nspyware become more sophisticated, the need for effective regulatory and oversight\nframeworks becomes increasingly urgent. The abuse of NSO Group’s zero-click iMessage\nattack to target journalists reinforces the need for a global moratorium on the sale and\ntransfer of surveillance technology, as [called for by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/SR2019ReportToHRC.aspx)\npromotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, “until rigorous\n_human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices and guarantee that_\n_governments and non-State actors use the tools in legitimate ways.”_\n\nThese safeguards should include strengthening and expanding regional and international\nexport controls, enacting national legislation that constrains invasive new surveillance\ntechnology such as zero-click spyware, and the expansion of mandatory due diligence\nrequirements for spyware developers and brokers.\n\n## Update your iOS Device Immediately\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have seen no evidence that the KISMET exploit still functions on iOS 14 and above,\nalthough we are basing our observations on a finite sample of observed devices. Apple\nmade many new security improvements with iOS 14 and we suspect that these changes\nblocked the exploit. Although we believe that NSO Group is constantly working to develop\nnew vectors of infection, if you own an Apple iOS device you should immediately update\n**to iOS 14.** [Click here for instructions.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nBill Marczak’s work on this report was supported, in part, by the International Computer\nScience Institute and the Center for Long-Term Cyber Security at the University of California,\nBerkeley.\n\nThe authors would like to thank Bahr Abdul Razzak for review and assistance.
