This report exposes\ntheir vast espionage apparatus, active during 2016-2017. We present incidents of company impersonation,\nmade up organizations and individuals, spear phishing and watering hole attacks. We analyze their\nexploitation, delivery, and command-and-control infrastructure, and expose DownPaper, a malware\ndeveloped by the attackers, which has not been publicly documented to date.\n\nIncidents documented in this report are likely a small fraction of the actual amount of targeted attacks,\nwhich may reach thousands of individuals. We expose more than 85 IP addresses, 240 malicious domains,\nhundreds of hosts, and multiple fake entities – most of which were created in 2016-2017. The most recent\ndomains (com-archivecenter[.]work, com-messengerservice[.]work and com-videoservice[.]work) were\nregistered on December 2[nd], 2017, and have probably not been used in attacks yet.\n\nWe present the connection between Behzad Mesri, an Iranian national recently indicted for his involvement\nin hacking HBO, and Charming Kitten. We also identify other members of the group.\n\nThis report refers to two likely distinct groups, Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten, together. This is not to\nsay that the two groups are one, but that due to overlap in infrastructure, tools, targets, and modus\noperandi we are unable to precisely attribute each incident to one or the other. Further discussion appears\nin the section \"Charming Kitten or Rocket kitten?\"\n\n###### Targets\n\nThe attackers' focus appears to be individuals of interest to Iran in the fields of Academic research (i.e.\nIranists - Scholars who study Iran), Human right and media. Emphasis is given to Iranian dissidents living in\nIran or abroad, and people who come in touch with Iranians or report on Iranian affairs such as journalists\nand reporters, media outlets covering Iran, and political advisors.\n\nMost targets known to us are individuals living in Iran, the United States, Israel, and the UK. Others live in\nTurkey, France, Germany, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, India, Denmark and other countries.\n\nNotably, the attackers usually try to gain access to private email and Facebook accounts. They seek to\ninfiltrate the targets’ social network as a hop point to breach other accounts in their social network, or to\ncollect information about their targets. Sometimes, they aim at establishing a foothold on the target’s\ncomputer to gain access into their organization, but, based on our data, this is usually not their main\nobjective, as opposed to other Iranian threat groups, such as Oilrig[1] and CopyKittens[2].\n\n1 [http://www.clearskysec.com/oilrig/](http://www.clearskysec.com/oilrig/)\n2 [http://www.clearskysec.com/tulip/](http://www.clearskysec.com/tulip/)\n\nPage 3 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n### Charming Kitten or Rocket kitten?\n\n\nWhile Iranian threat actors have been well documented by security researchers, the inner workings of the\necosystem of Iran's hackers is not entirely clear. Groups can be vigorously active for years and then\ndisappear abruptly, sometimes due to being publicly outed. Researchers make a best-faith effort to assign\noperations to certain groups, but the instability in the field makes the process challenging.\n\nA case of these obscure lines can be found in a blogpost published in coordination and parallel to this report\n-“Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code”[3] by Collin Anderson and Claudio\nGuarnieri. Flying Kitten (which is another name given by the security industry to Charming Kitten) was one of\nthe first groups to be described as a coherent threat actor conducting operations against political opponents\nof the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) government and foreign espionage targets. FireEye’s publication of\n“Operation Saffron Rose” report, which described Flying Kitten’s operations against aviation firms, led to the\ndismantling of Flying kitten's infrastructure and the apparent end of its activities. Months later, another,\nseemingly distinct group, “Rocket Kitten,” would be described by a series of reports.\n\nWhile the two groups exhibited different behaviors that lend credence to the assumption they were distinct,\ndisclosures of private toolkits strongly suggest that Rocket Kitten had used Flying Kitten resources\nthroughout its credential-theft operations. Moreover, Rocket Kitten had experimented with reusing malware\nthat appeared to be an undisclosed precursor to Flying Kitten's “Stealer” agent documented by FireEye.\nThese overlaps provide some indication that Rocket Kitten had some relationship to Flying Kitten – perhaps\nmembers of the latter joining the new team. Rocket Kitten has since largely subsided as a formidable actor,\nand repeating the theme of its predecessor now only appears in echoes of other campaigns.\n\nRead -“Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code” here:\n[https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten.](https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten)\n\nFurther information is available in \"Appendix B - Previous reports about Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten\".\n\n3 [https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten](https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten)\n\nPage 4 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n### The HBO hacker and Charming Kitten\n\n\n###### HBO hacking indictment \n\nIn November 21, 2017, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment[4] against Behzad\n**Mesri (A.K.A “Skote Vahshat”)[5] for his involvement hacking and extorting HBO, and for subsequently leaking**\nthe stolen content on the Internet. Leaked content included confidential information about upcoming\nepisodes of the popular television series, “Game of Thrones,” and video files containing unreleased episodes\nof other television series created by HBO[6].\n\nAccording to the indictment, \"Mesri is an Iran-based computer hacker who had previously worked on behalf\nof the Iranian military to conduct computer network attacks that targeted military systems, nuclear software\nsystems, and Israeli infrastructure. At certain times, Mesri has been a member of an Iran-based hacking\ngroup called the Turk Black Hat security team\".\n\n###### Connection to Iranian government backed threat agent\n\nSecurity researcher Collin Anderson of Iran Threats[7] tagged Mesri's twitter account[8] in a tweet[9] suggesting\nthat Mesri might be related to Charming Kitten.\n\n4 [https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/acting-manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-iranian-national-](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/acting-manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-iranian-national-conducting)\n[conducting](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/acting-manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-iranian-national-conducting)\n5 [https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/behzad-mesri](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/behzad-mesri)\n6 Other stolen content includes: (a) confidential video files containing unaired episodes of original HBO television\nprograms, including episodes of “Barry,” “Ballers,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Room 104,” and “The Deuce”; (b) scripts\nand plot summaries for unaired programs, including but not limited to episodes of “Game of Thrones”; (c) confidential\ncast and crew contact lists; (d) emails belonging to at least one HBO employee; (e) financial documents; and (f) online\ncredentials for HBO social media accounts (collectively, the “Stolen Data”).\n7 [https://iranthreats.github.io/](https://iranthreats.github.io/)\n8 [https://twitter.com/skote_vahshat](https://twitter.com/skote_vahshat)\n9 [https://twitter.com/CDA/status/932992141466279936](https://twitter.com/CDA/status/932992141466279936)\n\nPage 5 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nSubsequently, we tried to find connections of Mesri to other activities and people mentioned in this report.\nThanks to the public nature of how Mesri and other members of Turk Black Hat conducted their hacking\nactivities and private online life, we could find several connections. This is not to say that the HBO hack was\nordered by the Iranian government. Rather, we try to strengthen the assumption that Mesri was, at a certain\ntime, part of, or related to Charming Kitten. In addition, we unmask other members of the group based on\ntheir connection to Mesri and to Charming Kitten infrastructure.\n\n###### From Mesri to Charming Kitten\n\n**ArYaIeIrAN (AKA aryaieiran@gmail.com AKA aryaieiran@hotmail.com AKA mno_1988_fgh@yahoo.com)**\nis a 29 years old Iranian hacker and member of Turk Black Hat. Below is his profile page in \"Iranian\nengineers club\"[10]:\n\n10 http://www.iran-eng.ir/member.php/77662-ArYaiEiRan?langid=1\n\nPage 6 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nA list of websites he defaced, listed on Zone-H :\n\nAnd a mirror page of a defacement he made in 2012, showing some of his team members and email address:\n\n11 http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=ArYaIeIrAn\n\nPage 7 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same email address, aryaieiran@gmail.com, shows up in the SOA (Start of Authority) record of multiple\ndomains registered and used by Charming Kittens that are presented in this report. These include\nbritishnews.com[.]co, britishnews[.]org, broadcastbritishnews[.]com and mehrnews[.]info. All these websites\nused persiandns[.]net as their NS (name server), as can be seen in PassiveTotal[12] [13]:\n\n12 [https://community.riskiq.com/search/britishnews.org](https://community.riskiq.com/search/britishnews.org)\n13 [https://community.riskiq.com/search/britishnews.com.co](https://community.riskiq.com/search/britishnews.com.co)\n\nPage 8 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n_aryaieiran@gmail.com also registered persiandns[.]net, potentially indicating that he is the administrator of_\nthe services and an employee in the company:\n\nIn a defacement, still online at the time of writing, both ArYaIeIrAn and Skote_Vahshat, the HBO hacker, take\ncredit as members of Turk Black Hat. This indicates that both were members of Turk Black Hat at the same\ntime, and likely knew each other.\n\nPage 9 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\npersiandns[.]net hosting services, which hosted malicious domains used by charming kitten, redirects to\n**_mahanserver[.]ir, indicating it is the same company:_**\n\nThe about page (درباره ما) of mahanserver[.]ir leads to a 404 error page:\n\nPage 10 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CEO of mahanserver[.]ir is Mohammad Rasoul Akbari (A.K.A ra3ou1), likely the boss or partner of\nArYaIeIrA:\n\nPage 11 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nThe two follow each other on twitter:\n\nAkbari is a Facebook friend of the HBO hacker, Behzad Mesri [14].\n\n14 [https://www.facebook.com/friendship/sk0te.vahshat/ra3ou1/](https://www.facebook.com/friendship/sk0te.vahshat/ra3ou1/)\n\nPage 12 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Linkedin, MahanServer only has two employees: CEO Mohammad Rasoul Akbari and Mohammadamin\nKeshvari:\n\nInterestingly, Mohammadamin Keshvari's profile picture is a pomegranate, like that of ArYaIeIrAN’s twitter\naccount[15]:\n\n15 [https://twitter.com/aryaieiran](https://twitter.com/aryaieiran)\n\nPage 13 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, Mohammadamin Keshvari mentions in his LinkedIn profile that he works at ARia Dc (ariadc[.]com,\n_ariadc[.]net) which was registered by aryaieiran@gmail.com for three days in 2013 before changing to a_\ngeneric email[16]:\n\nARia Dc later turned into MahanServer, as can be seen in Waybac Machine:\n\n16 Data from DomainTools whois history.\n\nPage 14 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nTo sum up, the HBO hacker - Behzad Mesri is a member of Turk Black Hat along with ArYaIeIrAn, who\nprovides infrastructure for Charming Kitten activity via PersianDNS / Mahanserver together with\n**Mohammad Rasoul Akbari, who is a Facebook friend of Behzad Mesri's. We tend to identify ArYaIeIrAn with**\n**Mohammadamin Keshvari, because the latter is the only other employee of Mahanserver and works in a**\ncompany whose domain was registered by the former (and both have a similar and unique profile picture).\n\n**We estimate with medium certainty that the three are directly connected to Charming Kitten, and**\n**potentially, along with others – are Charming Kitten.**\n\nWe used SocialNet, Shadow Dragon’s Maltego transform for social media analysis[17] to analyze these\nconnections and visually depict them, as can be seen below:\n\n17 [https://shadowdragon.io/product/socialnet](https://shadowdragon.io/product/socialnet)\n\nPage 15 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n### Delivery and Infection\n\n\nCharming Kitten attack their targets using the following methods:\n\n  - **Made up organizations and people – entities are made up to lure people into malicious websites or**\nto receive malicious messages.\n\n  - **Impersonating real companies – real companies are impersonated, making victims believe they are**\ncommunicating or visiting the website of the real companies.\n\n  - **Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites.**\n\n  - **Spear phishing – pretending to be** Gmail, Facebook, and other services providers, or pretending to\nbe a friend of the target sharing a file or a link.\n\nThese methods are elaborated below.\n\n##### Made up organizations and people \n\n###### British News \n\nCharming kitten regularly target international media outlets with Persian-language services. Two recent\nreports – \"How Iran tries to control news coverage by foreign-based journalists\"[18] and \"Iranian agents\nblackmailed BBC reporter with ‘naked photo’ threats\"[19] describe harassment and intimidation methods\napplied by Iranian intelligence agencies. These campaigns often target reporters and journalists in phishing\nattempts.\n\nOn the same note, we identified a fake-news agency \"established\" by the attackers, called “The British news\n_agency”_ or “Britishnews” (inspired by BBC)[20]. Its website domain is britishnews.com[.]co and two other\ndomains, broadcastbritishnews[.]com and britishnews[.]org, redirected to it. Below are screenshots of the\nmain page of the website, which is online at time of writing:\n\n18 [https://rsf.org/en/news/how-iran-tries-control-news-coverage-foreign-based-journalists](https://rsf.org/en/news/how-iran-tries-control-news-coverage-foreign-based-journalists)\n19 [http://www.arabnews.com/node/1195681/media](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1195681/media)\n20 Outed in collaboration with Forbs On Jan 2017, see “With Fake News And Femmes Fatales, Iran's Spies Learn To Love\n[Facebook” forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/27/iran-hackers-oilrig-use-fake-personas-on-facebook-linkedin-for-](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/27/iran-hackers-oilrig-use-fake-personas-on-facebook-linkedin-for-cyberespionage)\n[cyberespionage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/27/iran-hackers-oilrig-use-fake-personas-on-facebook-linkedin-for-cyberespionage)\n\nPage 16 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the “about” page of the fake news agency website, detailing its objectives and\ngiving the email addresses of various “employees”:\n\nPage 17 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nNote the use of present perfect instead of past simple in \"has been established\" (instead of \"was\nestablished\"), present progressive (we are covering) instead of present simple (we cover) to mark a habitual\naspect, and \"began this work\" – all suggesting a Persian-thinking writer.\n\nThis fake news-agency and accompanying social media accounts are not used to disseminate propaganda or\nfalse information. Their content was automatically copied from legitimate sources. The purpose of this news\nagency is to create legitimacy, with the end goal of reaching out to their targets and infecting them while\nvisiting the infected website.\n\nThe website contains BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework – a penetration testing tool that focuses on web\nbrowsers), however it seems that the payload is sent only when the victim visits the site from IPs in a whitelist\nmanaged by the attackers. This might indicate they are after specific targets or organizations rather than\nwidespread infection.\n\nThe screenshot below shows w3school.hopto[.]org, which served BeEF, called when britishnews.com[.]co is\nloading:\n\nPage 18 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nPage 19 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the bottom of the site are links to social media accounts created by the attackers:\n\nBelow are screenshots of the accounts.\n\nInstagram, Instagram[.]com/britishnewslive with over 13,000 followers (unavailable for several months):\n\nPage 20 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nTwitter, https://twitter[.]com/britishnewslive (online at time of writing):\n\nFacebook page - facebook[.]com/officialbritishnewslive (unavailable for several months):\n\nPage 21 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nLinkedIn company page, linkedin[.]com/company/britishnews (unavailable for several months):\n\nThe attackers also created a fake LinkedIn profile, Isabella Carey, that “worked” at the fake news company:\n_linkedin[.]com/in/isabella-carey-98a42a129 (unavailable for several months):_\n\nPage 22 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nAn email address with the same name, isabella.careyy@gmail.com, was used to register 12 malicious\ndomains by Charming Kitten, as can be seen in PassiveTotal[21]:\n\n21 [https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/isabella.careyy@gmail.com](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/isabella.careyy@gmail.com)\n\nPage 23 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Made up studens and jurnalists\n\nMultiple Israeli Iranist and middle east researchers were sent emails and Twitter direct messages by made up\nentities.

UTC is a large military contractor, getting about 10% of its revenue\nfrom the U.S. government”[23]. The fake website was first reported by Iran Threats researchers on 6 February\n2017[24]. We do not have evidence that UTC was targeted or impacted.\n\nThe fake website, which was built in January 2017, claimed to offer “Free Special Programs And Courses For\nEmployees Of Aerospace Companies like Lockheed Martin, SNCORP, ….”.

Alon produced a satire\nfilm about the Israeli Mossad, which potentially confused the attackers to thinking he is associated with the\nIsraeli Mossad. The breached account was used to send a phishing email to Thamar Eilam Gindin (who is\ntargeted by the group since 2015[26]). Below is a screenshot of the phishing email:\n\nThe email contained a shortened bit.ly link to a domain registered by the attackers - drivers.document_supportsharing[.]bid. In the statistics and usage page of the bit.ly URL we can see that the first click, likely a_\ntest run performed by the attackers before sending the phish, was from Iran.\n\n25 Names of victims and targets are shared with their permission.\n[26 See, Thamar Reservoir: http://www.clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/](http://www.clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/)\n\nPage 34 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing page pretends to be a Gmail shared document downed page that requires the visitor to log in:\n\nPage 35 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Wave 2\n\nSometimes the phishing email does not contain live text, but only an image of text linked to a phishing page.\nThis is usually done to bypass text based spam filters.\n\nThe attackers used WebRTC (code copied from Github[27]) to detect the real IP address of targets who use\nproxies (This method was documented by Iran Threats[28]):\n\nWhile sending the spear phishing, the attackers preformed password recovery on the target’s Facebook\naccount, as can be seen below. Thus, she received fake emails and legitimate ones at the same time which\ncould cause her confusion and subsequently to give her credentials in the phishing.\n\n27 [https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips/blob/master/README.md)\n28 [https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/webrtc-deanonymization/](https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/webrtc-deanonymization/)\n\nPage 36 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Wave 3\n\nThe attackers often open a new Gmail account and send phishing emails from it. For example,\n_suspended.user.noitification@gmail.com was used to send the following email to targets:_\n\nWhich leads to:\n\nPage 37 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nIn other cases, 7 different targeted phishing emails were sent to the same victim on the same day from\n_customers.mailservice@gmail.com:_\n\nPage 38 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nPage 39 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing messages were sent to hundreds of recipients from a previously unknown email address:\n_mails.customerservices@gmail.com_\n\nThey contained a link to goo-gle[.]mobi\n\nBelow are screen captures of two of the messages. The content is not copied directly from Googles original\nnotices, as evident from the spelling and grammatical errors, some of them typical of Persian speakers, e.g.\nusing direct speech where English would use indirect speech (\"that\" instead of \"whether\"):\n\nPage 40 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nHamed Hashemi, an Iranian Independent researcher and photographer living in the Netherlands was targeted\nin this campaign. He detected the malicious emails and wrote about them in his twitter account[29] [30]:\n\nTranslation: \"The brothers'[31] new method for hacking e-mails. Do not be fooled by such an email\".\n\n29 [https://twitter.com/hamed_hashemi/status/869835075550162944](https://twitter.com/hamed_hashemi/status/869835075550162944)\n30 [https://twitter.com/hamed_hashemi/status/869865703939219456](https://twitter.com/hamed_hashemi/status/869865703939219456)\n31 I.e. people working for the IRI.\n\nPage 41 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation: \"Ramezān (The month of Ramadan) operation continues.\"\n\nOther reported receiving 6 spear phishing emails within a few minutes. For example, Soudeh Rad[32] board\nmember at ILGAEurope[33] (an organization for human rights and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and\nintersex people at European level):\n\nTranslation: \"What's the most important thing to do when you're under a phishing attack? Keep your calm\n\n☺ 6 e-mails arrived within 10 minutes (saying) someone signed into your email (account), confirm your\n\n_account.\"_\n\n32 [https://twitter.com/soudehrad/status/876062478685396992](https://twitter.com/soudehrad/status/876062478685396992)\n33 [https://twitter.com/ILGAEurope](https://twitter.com/ILGAEurope)\n\nPage 42 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n34 [https://twitter.com/Behrang](https://twitter.com/Behrang)\n35 [https://twitter.com/Behrang/status/855761991117484032](https://twitter.com/Behrang/status/855761991117484032)\n\nPage 43 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation: “And if you click on the link but don't type your password, they send you another email.

These services are often used\nby marketing people to monitor their campaign effectiveness. Below is the source code of a spear phishing\nemail with a mailtrack.io tracking link:\n\nSometimes the attackers used a similar email tracking service, by Pointofmail. In this case, the malicious\nemail was sent from Pointofmail’s servers (this is part of their service, not due to a breach). The email\ncontained a redirect link to legitimate address advmailservice.com:\n\nWhich redirects several times, eventually reaching the malicious page:\n\nPage 45 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Targeted emails with malware\n\nEmail address customers.mailservice@gmail.com was mostly used for spear phishing. Occasionally, it was\nused to deliver links to malware. For example, the email below linked to http://tinyurl[.]com/hjtaeak which\nredirected to http://login.radio-m[.[cf/i/10-unique-chocolates-in-the-world.zip. The final URL contained the\nsame sample of DownPaper that was hosted in the fake UTC website mentioned above\n(be207941ce8a5e212be8dde83d05d38d).\n\nNote, that the person who “shared” the file with the target in the malicious email was indeed a Facebook\nfriend of the target (the target shared a link by her a few hours prior to receiving this message), and the\nsubject of chocolate was trending on the target's feed at the time. The attackers spied on the target\n(potentially by following her on various social networks), and crafted an email she would be likely to receive.\n\nPage 46 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n### DownPaper Malware\n\n\nDownPaper, sometimes delivered as sami.exe, is a Backdoor trojan. Its main functionality is to download\nand run a second stage.\n\nThe sample used in our analysis (3261d45051542ab3e54fa541f132f899) was contained in a Cabinet selfextractor (be207941ce8a5e212be8dde83d05d38d), served from the following URL:\n\n_http://login.radio-m[.]cf/utc/dnld.exe_\n\nThe process tree below shows dnld.exe drops sami.exe (DownPaper), which in turn runs Powershell to gain\npersistency:\n\nDownPaper performs the following steps:\n\n1. Loads from a resource file a URL of a command and control server. In the sample we\n\nanalyzed, the URL was “http://46.17.97[.]37/downloader/poster.php”, Base64 encoded as\ncan be seen below:\n\n2. Searches and reads the value of Window Update registry key in the following path:\n\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.\n\na. If the value is Null, a new mutex is created, called Global\\UpdateCenter, and a mutex\n\nsynchronization function is executed.\n\nb. If the value is different than the name of the running file, section 2.a. is executed and a\n\nfunction called SetStartUp is called via PowerShell to create a registry key named\n_Window Update with the following value:_\n\nPage 47 of 59\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n$scriptRoot\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\wuauclt.exe\n\n3. Sends an HTTP POST request to get the location of a second stage from the command and control\n\nserver. The requests contain the following fields:\n\na. Infected computer host name\n\nb. Username\n\nc. Serial Number – Retrieved via the following query: SELECT * FROM Win32_BaseBoard\n\n4. When a file is received, runs it in a new thread.\n\n5.

The report says\nthat Magic Hound “has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors\nthat are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia”. Also, “Link analysis of infrastructure and\ntools […] revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called ‘Rocket\nKitten’”. The last notion is in line with our findings.\n\nMAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER is a .NET downloader that retrieves secondary payloads using an embedded URL\nin its configuration as the C2.
