More money is lost to this type of attack than\nany other cybercriminal activity. The FBI reported that from June 2016 to June 2019,\n[companies reported $26.2B in losses. And in 2019 alone, BEC scams accounted for more](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/business-email-compromise)\nthan half of all cybercrime losses—an estimated $1.77B. The average loss per BEC incident\n[in 2019 was $74,723.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120)\n\nAn indication of how pervasive a problem BEC/EAC is: Proofpoint blocks over 15,000\nBEC/imposter messages a business day or nearly 4 million messages a year.\n\n[In this series, we cover BEC/EAC attack types that Proofpoint considers the most important](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/cybersecurity-essentials/anatomy-business-email-compromise-and-email-account-compromise-attack)\nfor a business to be aware of. In each of these posts, we explain what the attack is and how\nit works so that you can better understand these BEC/EAC attacks and can better protect\nyourself. In this post, we focus on BEC/EAC supplier invoicing attacks.\n\n## What Is BEC Supplier Invoicing Fraud\n\nBEC supplier invoicing scams are sophisticated and complex schemes to steal money by\neither presenting a fraudulent invoice as legitimate or by re-routing the payment to a bank\naccount controlled by the attacker. When you consider the large dollars associated with\nsupplier invoices, these scams are often the costliest for victim organizations. Proofpoint has\nstopped multiple supplier invoicing attempts where each incident was millions of dollars.\n\n\n-----\n\nBEC supplier invoicing fraud can be so successful that even prominent, well-known\nindividuals can fall for them. In February 2020, Shark Tank’s Barbara Corcoran\nnearly [lost close to US$400,000 to a BEC supplier invoicing attack. Happily for her, they](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/shark-tanks-barbara-corcoran-loses-nearly-400k-bec-attack-what-you-need-know)\n[were able to recover the funds before the attackers were able to collect them. That happy](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/business/barbara-cocoran-email-hack-money-returned/index.html)\nending however is rare: BEC supplier invoicing scams rarely end with funds being\nsuccessfully recovered.\n\nThis example is consistent with the high payoff successful supplier invoicing scams can yield.\nProofpoint has successfully stopped invoicing fraud that could have yielded attackers millions\nof dollars if successful.\n\n[Similar to gift card scams and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-protection/understanding-bec-and-eac-attacks-gift-card-scams) [payroll diversion scams, supplier invoicing scams rely on](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/cybersecurity-essentials/understanding-bec-scams-payroll-diversion)\nsocial engineering and impersonation to convince the target victim to send money to the\nattackers. But what sets BEC supplier invoicing scams apart is not just the large dollar\namounts often associated with these scams, but also the complex nature of these scams.\n\nWhile gift card scams are relatively simple, using maybe one email targeting one employee,\nsupplier invoicing scams are more byzantine involving compromise and impersonation of\ntrusted vendors and carried out in multiple stages against multiple individuals and\norganizations. The impersonation can either be at an account level or at the domain level\n(e.g. domain lookalikes).\n\n### How BEC Supplier Fraud Works\n\nMany of the BEC supplier invoicing attacks Proofpoint has observed indicate that these\nattacks originate from a legitimate email account that has been compromised. These\ncompromised accounts are highly prized by threat actors. They can conduct extensive\nreconnaissance and fraudulent emails sent from the compromised account will pass email\nauthentication controls (e.g. DKIM, SPF, DMARC) because they are sent from a legitimate\naccount.\n\nOnce a legitimate transaction is identified, the threat actor “thread hijacks” an already inprogress email conversation about the transaction (step 3 in the diagram below). Since the\nattacker’s message is part of an email thread that the target victim reasonably believes to be\nlegitimate, their message has greater credibility. As such requests for bank account changes\ndue to audit or COVID-19 seem more plausible. This believability and trust are key elements\nof social engineering. By their very nature, thread hijacking attacks are very difficult, if not\nimpossible for users to identify, making this a threat vector where technology\ncountermeasures are particularly needed and useful.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Anatomy of a Supplier Invoicing Fraud Attack_\n\nAt this stage of the attack, the threat actor pivots to a supplier account impersonation tactic\nwhere the attacker inserts an impersonated account in the “reply-to” or “cc” of the email\nconversation. The impersonated accounts can be a lookalike of the supplier domain (e.g.\nsupp1ier.com instead of supplier.com) or a lookalike of the account (e.g.\njanedoe[.]supplier[@]mail[.]com instead of jane[.]doe[@]supplier[.]com).\n\nWhy do this? The impersonation pivot allows the threat actor to maintain the email\nconversation with the target when the compromised account be remediated. In many cases,\nthe email thread continues via the impersonated account. Shifting the conversation to the\nimpersonated account also makes it more difficult for forensics and investigations because\nyou lose the logs in the supplier SEG.\n\nThe images below show exchanges in a BEC supplier invoicing attack that Proofpoint\nstopped. The attackers in this particular attack started with the compromised supplier\naccount where the attackers hijacked an existing email thread and utilized the\n“impersonation reply-to pivot” tactic. They impersonated two separate trusted individuals and\ntargeted two separate individuals in Finance and Accounting roles to try and make the fraud\nseem legitimate.\n\nIn Figure 2 we see an email message from the compromised account of a trusted individual\nfrom a supplier hijacking an existing email thread about several legitimate invoices. In this\nmessage the attackers are using the trusted individuals actual account and achieving\nimpersonation through control granted by compromising that account.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Hijacking Email Thread from Compromised Supplier Account to Target Account 1_\n\nIn Figure 3 the attackers pivot from the compromised account to an impersonated account\nfully under the attacker’s control. This account appears to be another trusted individual from\nthe supplier sending a follow up email to both target victims. The impersonation is carried out\nthrough use of a fake account made to seem like the trusted individual’s account.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Email from Impersonated Account to Both Target Accounts_\n\nThe fraud is made more credible by the fact that this second email references the same\ninvoice numbers as the first email and both emails have been sent to one of the target\nvictims. These two emails reinforce each other and that helps create a greater sense of\nlegitimacy that the attackers hope will convince one of the target victims to respond and take\naction.\n\nIn Figure 4 the attackers have shifted back to the compromised supplier account and are\nrequesting a change of bank to intercept the payment.\n\n_Figure 4: Email from Compromised Supplier Account requesting bank change for payment_\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s also notable that this email is using both authority and urgency, both common social\nengineering tactics in BEC attacks. Also notable is that the fraudulent emails are devoid of\nany malware payload such as an attachment or URL. There are no links or attachments for\nthe victims to click.\n\nTaken as a whole, this shows how attackers weave together identity deception, authority, and\nurgency while using tactics like account compromise and impersonation pivot all to make a\nfraudulent bank account change request seem legitimate so that target will pay the invoices\nto the threat actor’s bank account.\n\n### How Proofpoint Protects Against BEC/EAC Supplier Invoicing Fraud Scams\n\nProofpoint provides a multi-layered solution to help organizations protect against supplier\ninvoicing fraud. First, as part of Proofpoint Email Protection, NexusAI for BEC\nDetection dynamically analyzes a wide range of message attributes, including header\ninformation, domain, and message body to determine if a message is an impostor\n[message. Proofpoint Email Protection delivers unique value to Proofpoint customers in the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection)\nfollowing ways:\n\nThe Nexus Threat Graph aggregates and correlates trillions of threat data points\nacross email, cloud accounts, domains and more. Threat visibility across multiple\nattack vectors is a critical element to identify a fraudulent message from a\ncompromised account.\nAnalyzing and blocking 15,000 BEC messages per day globally gives each Proofpoint\ncustomer an unfair advantage as NexusAI for BEC Detection has a large corpus of\nprior BEC attacks to compare message body contents against.\nBeing in outbound mail flow enables us to understand bi-directional communications\nand identify whether there’s an established history of communication or whether the\nmessage is from someone you’ve never communicated with but is impersonating a\nsupplier.\n\nSecond, the Nexus Supplier Risk Explorer continuously maps your supply chain and\nuncovers what threats they may be sending to your organization. This visibility helps you\nunderstand which suppliers are the riskiest and allows you to implement adaptive controls to\nmitigate that risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Nexus Supplier Risk Explorer automatically identifies your suppliers and the risks_\n_they pose_\n\nThird, Proofpoint provides incident responders with reporting to understand what type of BEC\nattack it is (e.g. invoicing, gift card, payroll) and who received it. This visibility is an important\nfor prioritization efforts and informs what actions should be taken. Proofpoint also helps\nstreamline incident response with the ability to automatically find and pull back delivered\nmessages, included forwarded mail and distribution lists.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Detailed reporting helps incident responders understand what type of BEC attack_\n_and understand who received this attack._\n\n[Last, but not least, Proofpoint provides security awareness training to help organizations turn](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/security-awareness-training)\nusers into part of their defense. Because BEC supplier invoicing fraud relies on social\nengineering to trick end users, it’s critical to train employees about BEC supplier invoicing\nscams. Not only can Proofpoint help organizations teach users to spot BEC supplier\ninvoicing fraud, but we can also enable those users to report those messages as suspicious\nand automate the investigation and remediation of those reported messages.\n\n### Are You Protected?\n\nBEC supplier invoicing scams are not sophisticated in their goals or even their tactics. The\ngoal is simple: convince a target victim a fraudulent invoice is legitimate, so they’ll pay it. The\ntactics primarily focus on spoofing and account compromise: tactics that are not technically\nsophisticated.\n\nHowever, BEC supplier invoicing fraud weaves these tactics together in creative ways which\nis why BEC supplier invoicing scams continue to be successful. As we see in the example\nhere, the end result of these tactics is a multi-layered fraud that is reasonably, highly\ncredible.\n\nOne of the most important things you can do to help protect against BEC/EAC gift card\nscams is to understand how prepared your organization is to combat them.
