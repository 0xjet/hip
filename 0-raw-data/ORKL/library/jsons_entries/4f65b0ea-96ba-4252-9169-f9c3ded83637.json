All of these attacks leveraged CVE-2014-4114 and were delivered via malicious Microsoft](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4114)\nPowerPoint Slideshow files (*.pps). These attacks are highly targeted, appear to re-purpose legitimate content\nin decoy documents, and had very low antivirus (AV) detection rates at the time they were deployed.\n[The attacks against Tibetan groups shows a change in tactics from previous campaigns. Over the past four](https://targetedthreats.net/)\n[years the majority of attacks we have seen against Tibetan groups use CVE-2010-3333 or CVE-2012-0158.](https://targetedthreats.net/)\nThe use of CVE-2014-4114 marks the first time we have observed a change from this pattern in the last two\nyears.\n\nOne attack sent to Tibetan groups used a link to a file on Google Drive to deliver the malware. Groups in the\nTibetan community have promoted awareness campaigns around e-mail attachments, which have been the\n[most common attack vector for the community. This campaign, “Detach from Attachments,” urges users to](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-hardy.pdf)\navoid sending or opening email attachments, and to use cloud-based storage to send files like Google Drive as\nan alternative. The use of Google Drive to send malware may be evidence of attackers adapting to the\nbehavioral countermeasures promoted by the campaign.\nIn addition to the use of the same CVE, some of the attacks targeting Tibetan rights groups and Hong Kong\ngroups have overlap in malware family (PlugX) and Command and Control (C2) domains. The similarities\nbetween these attacks suggests that either they are being conducted by the same threat actor or threat actors\ntargeting these groups are sharing tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs).\n\n## Targeting and Social Engineering\n\nWe observed a total of five malware campaigns that used CVE-2014-4114 and a range of social engineering\ntactics to persuade recipients to either open an attachment, or visit a URL and download a malicious file.\nIn all of these attacks, if a recipient double clicks on the .pps file, they are shown decoy content. Examination\n\n\n-----\n\nof the exif metadata of the files indicates that the attackers are likely repurposing material from legitimate\npresentations.\n\nPPT files (the more commonly used PowerPoint file extension) are automatically opened in edit mode,\nwhereas .pps files are automatically opened in slideshow mode. For the CVE-2014-4114 exploit to work, the\nPowerpoint Slideshow needs to be played. Sending .pps files that automatically run a PowerPoint Slideshow is\nlikely an attempt by the attackers to increase the infection rate.\n\n## TIBETAN ATTACKS\n\nOver April and May 2015 we observed 3 attack campaigns targeting a number of Tibetan organizations. The\nsophistication of the social engineering varied between attacks, but all attacks appeared to use re-purposed\nlegitimate content.\n\n## Tibet Attack 1: April 2015\n\nThe first attack we observed was sent to multiple Tibetan groups over the course of April 2015. The email text\n[is taken from a website related to an advocacy campaign and report by the International Tibet Network (ITN),](http://www.xijinping-tibetchallenge.org/)\na prominent Tibetan rights group. The email signature includes the real office address of ITN. However, the\nsender’s email address (tibet_net@yahoo.com.hk) is not a legitimate address related to the group. Attached to\nthe email was a .pps file that repurposes slides from a presentation related to the same report and advocacy\ncampaign referenced in the email message.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Email lure sent to Tibetan groups**\n\n**Figure 2: Image from decoy PowerPoint Slideshow file**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tibet Attack 2: April 28, 2015\n\nThe second attack was sent out on April 28 2015 to multiple Tibetan organizations. The email message\nreferences a recent visit between Archbishop Desmond Tutu and His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL). The\n.pps attachment also referenced the event and appears to be repurposed from legitimate material.\n\n## Tibet Attack 3: May 6 2015\n\nThe third attack was sent to Tibetan groups on May 6 2015 and contained a simpler message than previous\nattacks that urges the recipient to download a file from Google Drive, appears to repurpose legitimate content.\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI have shared the Biography of H.H. THE 14TH DALAI LAMA via Google Drive.\nKindly download it.\nPowerPoint Slideshow files do not display properly on Google Drive, and therefore a recipient may be\ntempted to download and open the file on their computer. The use of Google Docs is potentially evidence of\n[attackers changing tactics in reaction to the Detach from Attachments campaign.](https://www.cybersuperhero.net/safer-file-sharing/)\n\n## HONG KONG ATTACK CAMPAIGNS\n\nWe analyzed two attacks sent over the course of March 2015 that targeted individuals associated with human\nrights groups and pro-democratic political parties in Hong Kong.\n\n## Hong Kong Attack 1: March 6, 2015\n\nThe first attack was sent on March 6 2015. The email signature was made to appear to come from an assistant\n[of Dr. Margaret Ng who is a Barrister and a former member of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong. The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Ng)\n.pps attachment used a decoy document that appears to repurpose slides from an actual presentation Dr. Ng\n[gave to Columbia Law School in February 2015.](http://home.columbia.edu/event/speech-and-media-freedom-new-lessons-umbrella-revolution-76595)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hong Kong Attack 2: March 31, 2015\n\n# The second attack was sent on March 31 2015, and contained a message related to the Occupy Central protests. The .pps file attachment was also related to Occupy Central and appears to repurpose legitimate content.\n\n## INFECTION\n\nDespite the variety of targets and delivery approaches, the malware shares a common infection process. When\n[the PowerPoint Slideshow is played, the malware leverages CVE-2014-4114, a vulnerability in the OLE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4114)\nPackage Manager to infect the target machine. Computers using Windows Vista and above are susceptible to\nthis attack. In addition to the decoy document, the malicious slideshow contains two embedded OLE objects:\na .inf file and a malicious executable with a .gif extension that are dropped to the temp folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe .inf file is used to copy the executable and then run it.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The CVE-2014-4114 vulnerability has been described by Rapid7 and was previously linked to the](http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_060_sandworm)\n“Sandworm” Russian threat actor. In these previously reported attacks, the .inf and .gif files are copied from a\nremote smb share to the victim’s computer. In the attacks we describe here the payload is embedded in the\n[OLE objects, similar to cases described by TrendMicro.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-cve-2014-4114-attacks-seen-one-week-after-fix/)\n\nSince CVE-2014-4114 is a vulnerability in the OLE package manager it makes it possible for attackers to\ncreate a PowerPoint presentation in which the OLE package manager loads a fake .gif file (that is actually a\nmalicious executable), and then a malicious .inf file that runs the executable.\n\nIf a user double clicks on the malicious attachment, the decoy file opens without crashing the program or\nproducing any other obvious signs that something is wrong with the file. This behaviour contrasts with how\n[other common CVEs used to target groups in the Tibetan community (e.g, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2010-3333)](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\nbehave, which typically cause the vulnerable program to crash before opening a decoy document.\n\nThe exploit used in these attacks does not contain shell code, which makes it harder for AV heuristics to detect\n\n\n-----\n\nit. Of the samples we analyzed that have been uploaded to VirusTotal, two currently have 0 detections out of\n57 AV engines (see Table 1).\n\n**Table 1: AV Detection Rates**\n\n# AV Detection Rate\n AV Detection Rate\n Sample MD5 (Orignal\n (Current)\n Submission)\n Date / Time: 2015 Date / Time: 2015 18bb1ce405e4abac4b0fc63054 06-04 11:53:17\n 04-30 13:44:39\n beac6c Detection rate:\n Detection rate: 0/56\n 0/57\n Date / Time: 2015 Date / Time: 2015 8a18a13910838d08e38db80a0 06-05 18:36:01\n 03-06 02:30:16\n 8e15bd5 Detection\n Detection rate: 0/57\n rate: 0/57\n Date / Time: 2015 Date / Time: 2015- 06-05 18:38:17\n 2a544922d3ece4351c1af4ca63\n 05-06 09:28:05 20/57\n c24550\n Detection rate 8/57 Detection\n rate: 20/57\n\n## PLUGX ATTACKS\n\n# Three of the sampled we analyzed used the PlugX malware family. PlugX is a well-known malware family that researchers have observed being used in targeted attacks against NGOs, government institutions, and private companies. A Trend Micro report on PlugX, describes a long-standing campaign that previously used Poison Ivy, another malware family. Jaime Blasco at AlienVault claims to have tracked down the author of PlugX, who is allegedly based at a Chinese security company.\n In these three samples, the embedded executable in OLE is a self extracting RAR containing the three components of PlugX: a signed legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, and a binary file containing the main payload. Using a technique known as DLL sideloading, the legitimate executable runs the malicious DLL. This malicious code then decrypts and decompresses the binary\n\n|Table 1: AV Detection Rates|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Sample MD5|AV Detection Rate (Orignal Submission)|AV Detection Rate (Current)|\n|18bb1ce405e4abac4b0fc63054 beac6c|Date / Time: 2015- 04-30 13:44:39 Detection rate: 0/56|Date / Time: 2015- 06-04 11:53:17 Detection rate: 0/57|\n|8a18a13910838d08e38db80a0 8e15bd5|Date / Time: 2015- 03-06 02:30:16 Detection rate: 0/57|Date / Time: 2015- 06-05 18:36:01 Detection rate: 0/57|\n|2a544922d3ece4351c1af4ca63 c24550|Date / Time: 2015- 05-06 09:28:05 Detection rate 8/57|Date / Time: 2015- 06-05 18:38:17 20/57 Detection rate: 20/57|\n\n\n-----\n\n# file in memory which contains the main functionality. Since the malicious code is being run by a signed, legitimate executable, and the payload never exists unencrypted on disk, it is more difficult for AV to detect PlugX.\n For two of the three Plug X samples the the malware leverages expired certificates from legitimate vendors: one executable signed by Microsoft and one by F-Secure.\n\n**Figure 3: Microsoft Certificate**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: F-Secure Certificate**\n\n**Connections To Other Malware Families And Campaigns**\n\n# While three attacks used PlugX malware, two other attacks did not. One of these attacks targeted Tibetan groups, the second targeted Hong Kong-based groups. The non-PlugX attack against Tibetan groups communicates with free1999.jkub.com, a C2 that we have previously observed in multiple campaigns using the Surtr malware family and targeting Tibetan groups. The Valkyrie-X Security Research Group has also observed this C2 used in attacks against Hong Kong-based groups.\n The non-PlugX attack against Hong Kong-based groups used a malware family that Symantec calls Wofeksad and connects to the C2 eset-windows.findhere.org. We have observed the Wofeskad malware family in another attack against a large International NGO that works on multiple countries and issues. However, that attack used CVE-2012-0158 and communicated with a different C2. Details of the samples analyzed in this report are outlined in Table 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2: Sample Details**\n\n# Delivery Targe Malwa\n Command and\n Sample MD5 Mechani ted re\n Control\n sm Group Family\n Email eset 8a18a13910838d08e38db80a Hong Wofeks\n Attachm windows.findhe\n 08e15bd5 Kong ad\n ent re.org\n PlugX\n Email\n 705147c509206151c22515ef Hong (Sideloa dnsupdate.dyna\n Attachm\n 568bac51 Kong d F- mic-dns.net\n ent\n Secure)\n PlugX\n Email\n 18bb1ce405e4abac4b0fc6305 Tibeta (Sideloa dnsupdate.dyna\n Attachm\n 4beac6c n d F- mic-dns.net\n ent\n Secure)\n PlugX (Sideloa d\n Google Microso\n 2a544922d3ece4351c1af4ca6 Tibeta\n Drive ft good.wha.la\n 3c24550 n\n Link Office\n 2003 compon ent)\n Email Not\n d7832e76ee2c5c48ae428e575 Tibeta free1999.jkub.c\n Attachm identifie\n 99b589e n om\n ent d\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe re-purposed content, low AV detection rate, and the lack of any obvious signs to a user that the files are\nmalicious (such as a program crash) make these attacks concerning. In the case of the Tibetan attacks, the use\nof CVE-2014-4114 shows a shift in tactics and a possible move away from CVE-2012-0158, which is the\nmost commonly used CVE we have seen in attacks against the community. In addition, the use of Google\nDrive further suggests a potential change in tactics, possibly in response to behavioral countermeasures\ndeveloped by Tibetan civil society.\n\n|Sample MD5|Delivery Mechani sm|Targe ted Group|Malwa re Family|Command and Control|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|8a18a13910838d08e38db80a 08e15bd5|Email Attachm ent|Hong Kong|Wofeks ad|eset- windows.findhe re.org|\n|705147c509206151c22515ef 568bac51|Email Attachm ent|Hong Kong|PlugX (Sideloa d F- Secure)|dnsupdate.dyna mic-dns.net|\n|18bb1ce405e4abac4b0fc6305 4beac6c|Email Attachm ent|Tibeta n|PlugX (Sideloa d F- Secure)|dnsupdate.dyna mic-dns.net|\n|2a544922d3ece4351c1af4ca6 3c24550|Google Drive Link|Tibeta n|PlugX (Sideloa d Microso ft Office 2003 compon ent)|good.wha.la|\n|d7832e76ee2c5c48ae428e575 99b589e|Email Attachm ent|Tibeta n|Not identifie d|free1999.jkub.c om|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe overlap in attacks against Tibet and Hong Kong groups also raises questions for future work. Are the\nattacks being conducted by the same threat actor, or is there sharing of TTPs between actors targeting these\ngroups? Further analysis of attacks against these communities is needed to probe these questions.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n[Special thanks to Valkyrie-X Security Research Group.](https://sites.google.com/site/valkyriexsecurityresearch/)\nThe Citizen Lab's research on Targeted Threats against Civil Society is supported by the John D. and\nCatherine T.
