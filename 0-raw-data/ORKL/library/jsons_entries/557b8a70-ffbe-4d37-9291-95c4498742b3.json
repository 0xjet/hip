Hackers](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/)\ntargeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology industries, all the targets\nare located or have an interest in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe attackers leverage a wide range of custom tools and an open-source cross-platform\nremote access tool (RAT) dubbed Pupyfor the Magic Hound campaign.\n\n“According to the developer, PupyRAT is a “multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android),\nmulti-function RAT and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python.” CTU™ analysis\nconfirms that PupyRAT can give the threat actor full access to the victim’s system.” reads the\n[analysis published by SecureWorks.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe arsenal of the threat actor includes different types of custom tools such as droppers,\ndownloaders, executable loaders, document loaders and IRC bots.\n\n_“Unit 42 has discovered a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East_\n_dating back to at least mid-2016 which we have named Magic Hound. This appears to be an_\n_attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted_\n_organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either in in or_\n_[business interests in Saudi Arabia.” reads the analysis published by PaloAlto Networks.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/)_\n\n_“Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic_\n_[Hound and the adversary group called “Rocket Kitten” (AKA](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41865/cyber-crime/rocket-kitten-report.html)_ _[Operation Saffron Rose,](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/25355/hacking/iranian-hackers-social-media.html)_ _Ajax_\n_Security Team,_ _[Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35128/cyber-crime/operation-woolen-goldfish.html)_\n_Newscasters.”_\n\nThe same campaign was also monitored by experts at SecureWorks that [attributed it to a](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations)\nthreat actor tracked as COBALT GYPSY that is associated with the Iranian government.\n\nThe attackers behind the Magic Hound used Word and Excel documents embedding\nmalicious macros that were able to download and execute additional tools using PowerShell.\n\nThe bait files appear to be holiday greeting cards, job offers, and official government\ndocuments from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Commerce in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn interesting discovery made by the experts is that some of the domains used in the Magic\nHound campaign were also uncovered by IBM X-Force researchers in the analysis of the\n[Shamoon 2 attack chain.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56327/cyber-crime/shamoon-attack-chain.html)\n\nAccording to the experts at Palo Alto Networks an IRC bot used in the Magic Hound\n[campaign is very similar to a piece of malware used by Newscaster, aka](http://www.securityweek.com/iranian-hackers-targeted-us-officials-elaborate-social-media-attack-operation) Charming Kitten\nand NewsBeef, an Iranian actor that targeted individuals in the U.S., Israel and other\ncountries using fake social media profiles.\n\nIranian hackers appear very active in this period, both Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten\n[actors were mentioned in an analysis of MacDownloader used by to exfiltrate data from Mac](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56095/hacking/macdownloader-iranian-hackers.html)\ncomputers.\n\n**[Pierluigi
