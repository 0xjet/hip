Among those, it has successfully breached more than 500\nservers, infecting well-known universities in the U.S. and Europe, and a railway\ncompany.\n**Sophistication: FritzFrog is completely proprietary; its P2P implementation was written**\nfrom scratch, teaching us that the attackers are highly professional software\ndevelopers.\n**Interception: Guardicore Labs has developed a client program in Golang which is**\ncapable of intercepting FritzFrog’s P2P communication, as well as joining as a network\npeer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attribution: While we are unable to attribute the FritzFrog botnet to a specific group,**\nwe have found some resemblance to a previously-seen P2P botnet named Rakos.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFritzFrog is a highly sophisticated peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet that has been actively breaching\nSSH servers worldwide. With its decentralized infrastructure, it distributes control among all\nits nodes. In this network with no single point-of-failure, peers constantly communicate with\neach other to keep the network alive, resilient and up-to-date. P2P communication is done\nover an encrypted channel, using AES for symmetric encryption and the Diffie-Hellman\nprotocol for key exchange.\n\nUnlike other P2P botnets, FritzFrog combines a set of properties that makes it unique: it is\nfileless, as it assembles and executes payloads in-memory. It is more aggressive in its bruteforce attempts, yet stays efficient by distributing targets evenly within the network. Finally,\nFritzFrog’s P2P protocol is proprietary and is not based on any existing implementation.\n\nThe malware, which is written in Golang, is completely volatile and leaves no traces on the\ndisk. It creates a backdoor in the form of an SSH public key, enabling the attackers ongoing\naccess to victim machines. Since the beginning of the campaign, we identified 20 different\nversions of the malware executable.\n\nIn this report, we will describe how the FritzFrog campaign was discovered, the nature of its\nP2P network and the malware’s inner workings – including the infection process, command\nencryption and volatile behavior.\n\n[Guardicore Labs provides a Github repository containing a detection script as well as a list of](https://github.com/guardicore/labs_campaigns/tree/master/FritzFrog)\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exploring FritzFrog\n\nGuardicore Labs first noticed this campaign as part of its ongoing Botnet\nEncyclopedia research. On January 9, new attack incidents appeared where malicious\nprocesses named ifconfig and nginx were executed. We started monitoring the campaign’s\nactivity, which rose steadily and significantly with time, reaching an overall of 13k attacks on\nGuardicore Global Sensors Network (GGSN). Since its first appearance, we identified 20\ndifferent versions of the Fritzfrog binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat was intriguing about this campaign was that, at first sight, there was no apparent\ncommand and control (CNC) server being connected to. It was shortly after the beginning of\nthe research when we understood no such CNC existed in the first place.\n\nTo intercept the FritzFrog network, Guardicore Labs has developed a client program in\nGolang, which performs the key-exchange process with the malware and is capable of\nsending commands and receiving their outputs. This program, which we named frogger,\nallowed us to investigate the nature and scope of the network. Using frogger, we were also\nable to join the network by “injecting” our own nodes and participating in the ongoing P2P\ntraffic.\n\nFritzFrog was found to brute-forces millions of IP addresses, among which are governmental\noffices, educational institutions, medical centers, banks and numerous telecom companies. It\nhas successfully breached over 500 SSH servers, including those of known high-education\ninstitutions in the U.S. and Europe, and a railway company.\n\n## New Generation P2P\n\n### Why “New-Generation”?\n\nFritzFrog has a special combination of properties, which makes it unique in the threat\nlandscape:\n\n_Fileless – FritzFrog operates with no working directory, and file transfers are done in-_\nmemory using blobs.\n_Constantly updating – databases of targets and breached machines are exchanged_\nseamlessly.\n_Aggressive – Brute-force is based on an extensive dictionary. By comparison, DDG, a_\nrecently discovered P2P botnet, used only the username “root”.\n_Efficient – Targets are evenly distributed among nodes._\n_Proprietary– The P2P protocol is completely proprietary, relying on no known P2P_\nprotocols such as μTP.\n\nOnce a victim is successfully breached, it starts running the UPX-packed malware, which\nimmediately erases itself. The malware process runs under the names ifconfig and nginx, to\nminimize suspicion. As part of its startup process, the malware begins listening on port 1234,\nwaiting for commands. The first commands which a new victim receives are responsible for\nsyncing the victim with the database of network peers and brute-force targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nTraffic on a non-standard port, such as 1234, can be easily detected and blocked by firewalls\nand other security products. Thus, FritzFrog’s author employed a creative technique to\nevade detection and stay under the radar. Instead of sending commands directly over port\n1234, commands are sent to the victim in the following manner: The attacker connects to the\nvictim over SSH and runs a netcat client on the victim’s machine, which in turn connects to\nthe malware’s server. From this point on, any command sent over SSH will be used as\nnetcat’s input, thus transmitted to the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Fritzfrog attackers implemented an encrypted command channel with over 30 different\ncommands. Command parameters and responses are transferred in designated data\nstructures and serialized (“marshalled”) to JSON format. Prior to sending, the data is\nencrypted using AES symmetric encryption and encoded in Base64. To agree upon the\nencryption key, the involved nodes use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.\n\nFritzFrog’s P2P\nCommands\n\n\nDatabase Operations Payloads\nOperations\n\n\ngetstatus\n\ngetstats\n\ngetblobstats\n\ngetpeerstats\n\ngetvotestats\n\nmapblobs\n\ngetlog\n\npushlog\n\ngetargs\n\nproxy\n\nping\n\ncomm\n\nexit\n\n\ngetdb\n\npushdb\n\npushdbzip\n\ngetdbzip\n\ngetdbnotargetsgettargets\n\npushtargets\n\nforcetargets\n\nputtargetpoolputblentry\n\n\nresetowned\n\npushowned\n\nputowned\n\ngetownedgetdeploy\n\nputdeploying\n\ndeploystatus\n\n\nAdministration\nOperations\n\nrunscript\npushbin\n\ngetbin\n\nsharefiles\n\n\n-----\n\nNodes in the FritzFrog network keep in close contact with each other. They constantly ping\neach other to verify connectivity, exchange peers and targets and keep each other synced.\nThe nodes participate in a clever vote-casting process, which appears to affect the\ndistribution of brute-force targets across the network. Guardicore Labs observed that targets\nare evenly distributed, such that no two nodes in the network attempt to “crack” the same\ntarget machine.\n\n## Delving into the Malware\n\nFritzFrog’s binary is an advanced piece of malware written in Golang. It operates completely\nin-memory; each node running the malware stores in its memory the whole database of\ntargets and peers. The malware spawns multiple threads to perform various tasks\nsimultaneously, as detailed in the table below.\n\nFritzFrog defines the following states with regards to the management of victim and target\nmachines.\n\n1. Target – a machine found in the target queue will next be fed to the Cracker module,\n\nwhich in turn will scan and try to brute-force it;\n2. Deploy – a machine which was successfully breached is queued for malware infection\n\nby the DeployMgmt module;\n3. Owned – a machine which was successfully infected will be added to the P2P network\n\nby the Owned module.\n\n**MODULE NAME** **FUNCTIONALITY**\n\n_Cracker_ Brute force targets\n\n\n_CryptoComm +_\n_Parser_\n\n\nEncrypted P2P communication\n\n\n_CastVotes_ Voting mechanism for target distribution\n\n_TargetFeed_ Ingesting targets from peers\n\n_DeployMgmt_ Worm module, deploying malware on breached (“cracked”)\nmachines\n\n_Owned_ Connecting to victims after malware deployment\n\n_Assemble_ In-memory file assembling from blobs\n\n_Antivir_ Competitors elimination. Kills CPU-demanding processes with the\nstring “xmr”\n\n_Libexec_ Monero Cryptominer\n\n\n-----\n\nEach node that runs the malware has a worker thread which is responsible for receiving\ncommands, parsing them and dispatching them to the appropriate function in the code.\n\nThe malware is transient – it does attempt to survive system reboots. However, a backdoor is\nleft to enable future access to the breached victim, whose login credentials are saved by the\nnetwork peers. The malware adds a public SSH-RSA key to the authorized_keys file. This\nsimple backdoor allows the attackers – who own the secret private key – for passwordless\nauthentication, in case the original password was modified. FritzFrog has used only a single\npublic key which is given in the box below.\n```\nssh-rsa\nAAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDJYZIsncBTFc+iCRHXkeGfFA67j+kUVf7h/IL+sh0RXJn7yDN0vEXz7i\n\n```\nThe malware file runs various shell commands on the local machine, some of them\nperiodically, to monitor the system state. For example, it runs free -m to check for available\nRAM, uptime, journalctl -S @0 -u sshd to monitor SSH logins, and other commands which\noutput the CPU usage statistics. These statistics are available for other nodes in the network\nto consume, and are used to determine, for example, whether to run a cryptominer or not.\n\nThe malware runs a separate process – named libexec – to mine the Monero coin. The\nminer is based on the popular XMRig miner and connects to the public\npool web.xmrpool.eu over port 5555.\n\n## An Evil Torrent-Like Network\n\nFritzfrog relies on the ability to share files over the network, both to infect new machines and\nrun malicious payloads, such as the Monero cryptominer.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo share and exchange files between nodes, Fritzfrog uses a stealthy, fileless approach.\nFiles are split into blobs – bulks of binary data – which are kept in memory. The malware\nkeeps track of the available blobs by storing them in a map together with each blob’s hash\nvalue.\n\nWhen a node A wishes to receive a file from its peer, node B, it can query node B which\nblobs it owns using the command getblobstats. Then, node A can get a specific blob by its\nhash, either by the P2P command getbin or over HTTP, with the URL https://:1234/. When\nnode A has all the needed blobs – it assembles the file using a special module named\nAssemble and runs it.\n\n## Attribution\n\nTracking the operators of a P2P botnet is a complicated task; due to its distributed nature,\ncommands can be sent to and from any node in the network. Still, we’ve attempted to\ncompare it to previous P2P botnets seen in the threat landscape.\n\nEven when compared with past P2P botnets, FritzFrog appears unique; it does not use IRC\n[like IRCflu, it operates in-memory unlike DDG, and runs on Unix-based machines – as](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/ssh-targeting-golang-bots-becoming-the-new-norm/)\n[opposed to the InterPlanetary Storm botnet. If any, it bears some resemblance – especially](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/ssh-targeting-golang-bots-becoming-the-new-norm/)\n[with regards to function naming and version numbers – to Rakos, a P2P botnet written in](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/20/new-linuxrakos-threat-devices-servers-ssh-scan/)\nGolang and analyzed by ESET back in 2016.\n\n## Detection & Mitigation\n\n[Guardicore Labs provides a FritzFrog detection script to run on SSH servers. It looks for the](https://github.com/guardicore/labs_campaigns/blob/master/FritzFrog/detect_fritzfrog.sh)\nfollowing FritzFrog indicators:\n\nRunning processes nginx, ifconfig or libexec whose executable file no longer exists on\nthe file system (as seen below)\nListening port 1234\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, TCP traffic over port 5555 can indicate network traffic to the Monero pool.\n```\nubuntu@ip-111-11-11-11:~$ ./detect_fritzfrog.sh\nFritzFrog Detection Script by Guardicore Labs\n=============================================\n[*] Fileless process nginx is running on the server.\n[*] Listening on port 1234\n[*] There is evidence of FritzFrog's malicious activity on this machine.\n\n### Learn More About Threat Intelligence Firewall\n\n```\n[VIEW NOW](https://www.guardicore.com/lp/threat-intelligence-firewall/)\n\nFritzFrog takes advantage of the fact that many network security solutions enforce traffic only\nby the port and protocol. To overcome this stealth technique, process-based segmentation\nrules can easily prevent such threats.\n\nWeak passwords are the immediate enabler of FritzFrog’s attacks. We recommend choosing\nstrong passwords and using public key authentication, which is much safer. In addition, it is\ncrucial to remove FritzFrog’s public key from the authorized_keys file, preventing the\nattackers from accessing the machine. Routers and IoT devices often expose SSH and are\nthus vulnerable to FritzFrog; consider changing their SSH port or completely disabling SSH\naccess to them if the service is not in use.\n\n\n-----",
