This time, instead of being installed by the OSX/Revir.A dropper, this new](https://www.welivesecurity.com/encyclopaedia/osx-revir-a-trojan-dropper)\nvariant of OSX/Imuler hides itself inside a ZIP archive, right in the middle of an array of\nerotic pictures, waiting for the user to open the malicious application.\n\nThis new variant is very similar to its ancestors in terms of command-and-control (C&C )\ncommunication and functionalities. (OSX/Imuler is an information stealer that can gather\nand transmit files, screenshots, and other data to a remote server.) The network protocol is\nstill HTTP-based and the payload is compressed with zlib. The hardcoded C&C domain\n\n\n-----\n\nnow being used is a new one, registered on February 13th, 2012 via a Chinese registrar.\nThe domain points to the same IP address as the previous variants, located in the USA and\nstill active at time of writing.\n\nThis all seems to indicate that the new variant was most likely released to improve its antivirus evasion.\n\nOSX/Imuler has the functionality to upload arbitrary local files to the C&C. A specialized\nseparate executable named CurlUpload, downloaded from the C&C every time the malware\nstarts, is used to perform the operation. This stand-alone executable, first seen in early\n2011, presents interesting strings that suggest it was initially built for Win32 but later\nrecompiled for OS X:\n\nESET security software (including ESET Cybersecurity for Mac) since signature update\n6970 detects this new variant as OSX/Imuler.C.\n\nMD5 of the files analyzed:\n\n7dba3a178662e7ff904d12f260f0fff3 (Installer)\n\n9d2462920fdaed5e360875fb0cf8274f (malicious payload))\n\ne00a280ad29440dcaab42ad093bcaafd (uploader module)\n\nBig thanks to my colleague Marc-Étienne M. Léveillé for his work on this investigation.\n\n**Alexis Dorais-Joncas**\n\n16 Mar 2012 - 10:02AM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n\n-----\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n-----",
