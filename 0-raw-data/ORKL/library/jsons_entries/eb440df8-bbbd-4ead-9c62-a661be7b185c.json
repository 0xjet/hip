    "plain_text": "### Operation Marstech Mayhem\n# Lazarus Group’s Open-Source Trap:\n## North Korea’s New Malware Tactic Targeting Developers and Crypto Wallets\n\n\n-----\n\n**In the wake of Operation99 and Operation Phantom Circuit, STRIKE uncovered that the Lazarus Group had**\n\n**engineered an advanced implant, codenamed \"marstech1.\" This state-of-the-art tool marks a significant**\n**evolution from earlier iterations deployed in global campaigns against developers, featuring unique functional**\n**enhancements that distinctly set it apart.**\n\n#### Key Findings\n\n**•** **A new implant, Marstech1, was developed and deployed by the threat actor, showing significant differences**\n**from previous versions.**\n\n**•** **The implant Marstech seems to be used in limited targeted attacks on the supply; it has not surfaced**\n**elsewhere, since its two occurrences in late 2024 and Jan 2025.**\n\n**•** **STRIKE also identified a GitHub profile associated with the Lazarus Group operator behind this campaign,**\n**who has been actively developing implants since November 2024.**\n\n#### Analysis\n\n\n**STRIKE uncovered an additional command and control**\n**server hosted on Stark Industries LLC that exhibited a pattern**\n**reminiscent of Operation 99 and Phantom Circuit. However, this**\n**server appears to employ entirely different tactics from what**\n**we've seen before. While recent C2s have communicated over**\n**ports 1224 and 1245, this one is operating on port 3000 and**\n**lacks the React web admin panel observed in Phantom Circuit—**\n**though it clearly runs Node.js Express on the backend. This**\n**setup is markedly different from those seen in previous operations.**\n\n\n**NMAP Scan**\n\n\n**The C2 is delivering an obfuscated Java Script implant known as Marstech1, which we cover later on what**\n**it exactly does. In addition, it serves similar implants that were observed in Operation99, but they have also**\n**evolved. Two implants known as pay_marstech1 and brow_marstech1 are similar, but different.ions, specifically**\n**on December 30, January 6, and January 10, maintaining an RDP session for 10 days. In the context of**\n**Operation99, which involved the C2 server 5[.]253[.]43[.]122, the adversary logged in via RDP more than a**\n**dozen times between December 26 and January 15.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Obfuscation Techniques\n\n**The Marstech implants utilize different obfuscation techniques than previously seen. The JS implant that was**\n**observed utilizes;**\n\n**•** **Control flow flattening & self-invoking functions**\n\n**•** **Random variable and function names**\n\n**•** **Base64 string encoding**\n\n**•** **Anti-debugging (anti-tamporing checks)**\n\n**•** **Splitting and recombining strings**\n\n**This ensures that if the threat actor embedded the JS into a software project it would go unnoticed.**\n\n**The other components, namely pay_marstech1 and brow_marstech1, employ an alternative method to obscure**\n**their actual purpose. Their obfuscation process consists of two steps:**\n\n**•** **Base85 Encoding:**\n**The long string (assigned to pq) is divided into two segments. The first 8 characters serve as a key**\n**(stored in wq), while the remainder (from index 9 onward) is Base85 encoded. The code utilizes Python’s**\n**b85decode to decode this segment.**\n\n**•** **XOR Decryption:**\n**Following the Base85 decoding, the code iterates over each byte of the decoded data, applying an XOR**\n**operation with a corresponding byte from the key. The key repeats every 8 bytes, achieved using the**\n**modulo operation (l0 & 7). This process effectively reverses a simple repeating-key XOR cipher.**\n\n#### Operation\n\n\n**The GJS Marstech implant is engineered to**\n**collect system details from the target machine,**\n**including the hostname, platform, and home**\n**directory—a standard reconnaissance**\n**tactic in Lazarus implants to assess the host**\n**environment. When accessed directly from the**\n**C2 server at hxxp://74.119.194.129:3000/j/**\n**marstech1, the JS script appears completely**\n**unreadable and obfuscated. The adversary can**\n**embed this implant into legitimate websites,**\n**software packages, and other parts of the supply**\n**chain, and it may even be included in genuine**\n**NPM packages aimed at the cryptocurrency/**\n**web3 sector.**\n\n\n**Latest Marstech Victims from Jan 2025**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Have we seen this before?\n\n**The Marstech implant appears to have first emerged in late**\n**December 2024, linked to a command and control server**\n**at 95.164.45.239, which the threat actor also hosted within**\n**Stark Industries. It followed similar patterns to recent C2**\n**infrastructure, establishing connections over port 3000. The**\n**implant was embedded within the code of a GitHub repository**\n**associated with SuccessFriend, which STRIKE suspects to be**\n**the Lazarus threat actor’s GitHub profile. Notably, the Marstech**\n**operation seems to be distinct from other campaigns targeting**\n**developers.**\n\n##### Lazarus in Github\n\n\n**Profile for Success Friend**\n\n\n**STRIKE discovered this profile connected to several C2s dating back to 2024 for the Marstech implant. The**\n**profile mentioned web dev skills and learning blockchain which is in alignment to the interests of Lazarus. The**\n**threat actor was committing both pre-obfuscated and obfuscated payloads to various github repositories.**\n**The SuccessFriend github profile has been active since July 2024, with the most recent activity 2 weeks ago.**\n**The profile contains a history of legitimate code committed to a number of projects, most recently starting in**\n**November 2024 malware related repos started to appear.**\n\n\n**The threat actor published several repositories that**\n**contained code related to this recent operation, such**\n**as test0122 which contains the implant code pre-**\n**obfuscation.**\n\n\n**Malware Repo time-line**\n\n\n**This repository contained the 1[st] and 2[nd ]stage implants**\n**involved in the Marstech operation, including pre-**\n**obfuscated 2[nd] stage and obfuscated 1[st] stage implants.**\n\n\n**Malware Repo time-line**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Marstech1 1[st] stage Implant to download**\n**from URL (hxxp://95.164.45.239:3001/**\n**client/marstech1)**\n\n\n**The actor published the 1[st] stage implant (origin.**\n**js) known as Marstech1 in this repository. The**\n**full functionality of Marstech is described in later**\n**sections. This implant sent exfiltrated data to the**\n**URL path hxxp://95.164.45.239:3001/uploads**\n**and retrieved 2[nd] stage implants from the URL path**\n**hxxp://95.164.45.239:3001/client/marstech1.**\n\n\n##### Analysis of code from test0122\n\n**The implants in the Github repository are remarkably different from what is being served from the command**\n**and control. In the repository test0122 it contains an implant named mc_cur.py that was created two weeks ago.**\n**The purpose of this implant is to search across Chromium-based browser directories, across multiple operating**\n**systems in order to modify specific browser configuration files. It focuses on tampering with extension related**\n**settings, most notably for the MetaMask extension (a popular cryptocurrency wallet extension). Further, the**\n**implant will report status and download payloads from the C2 URL 74.119.194.129 on port 3001. The implant**\n**will inject into the browser, but first it must gather a unique identifier from the system (Windows it locates SID**\n**and macOS the hardware UUID).**\n\n**The implant will then specify what browser extensions**\n**it will target for injection. The example below shows**\n**the extension ID for MetaMask. The next step**\n**afterwards is to iterate over target browsers and**\n**their profiles, followed by looking for the extensions**\n**settings folder and preparing for injection.**\n\n**Function to obtain a unique ID from target system**\n\n**The implant will download and extract a remote payload**\n\n\n**from the C2 and extract it in the destination extensions**\n**folder. Once the payload is present in the directory, the**\n**implant will modify the browsers preferences file to**\n**integrate remote config data from the C2 server.**\n\n\n**Function to specify what target extension to inject**\n\n\n**Remote payload downloading**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Remote payload downloading**\n\n#### Marstech Implant Capabilities\n\n**The following is the analysis of the obfuscated JavaScript file found being served by the C2 and within the code**\n**repositories.**\n\n##### Crypto Currency Targeting\n\n**This JS implant is targeting Exodus and Atomic Crypto currency wallets on Linux, MacOS and Windows. The**\n**implant will scan the system looking for cryptocurrency wallets in an effort to scan and read the file contents or**\n**extract metadata.**\n\n**The code begins by verifying that a specified**\n**target directory exists and is accessible. It then**\n**creates a temporary workspace by appending**\n**a fixed suffix (in this case, a '9') to the original**\n**directory path. This temporary directory is used**\n**to recursively copy or enumerate all files and**\n**subdirectories. For each file discovered, the script**\n**constructs its full path using Node’s path-joining**\n**methods and reads the file's contents using a**\n**helper function, effectively gathering data from**\n**every file in the target directory.**\n\n**Obfuscated Code for Crypto Wallet Scanning**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Once the file data is collected, each file’s content is packaged along with a unique identifier—which combines a**\n**provided label and the filename—into an object. These objects are aggregated into an array that represents all**\n**of the extracted data. Finally, this array is passed to an exfiltration function, which is responsible for sending the**\n**data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This entire mechanism is part of a larger operation aimed at**\n**stealing sensitive information from the scanned directory.**\n\n**Function for scanning and data extraction**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Data Exfiltration\n\n**Once the file data is packaged into an array of objects (each containing the file’s content along with its**\n**corresponding identifier and metadata), the script calls a dedicated exfiltration function—commonly referenced**\n**as aW. This function builds a payload that includes not only the aggregated file data but also additional**\n**metadata such as a timestamp (derived from Date.now()), a fixed type identifier (e.g., \"marstech1\"), and a host**\n**identifier. The payload is structured into an object where different keys (decoded from Base64 strings) are used**\n**to label the data and metadata.**\n\n\n**Functionality to exfiltrate data to C2**\n\n**In this code, ak decodes the Base64**\n**string \"NzQuMTE5LjaHR0cDovLwE5NC4**\n**xMjk6MzAwMA==\" to produce**\n**\"74.119.194.129: 3000\", and the decoded**\n**fragment from \"L3VwbG9hZHM\"**\n**is \"/uploads\". When concatenated,**\n**they yield the full C2 endpoint:**\n**hxxp://74.119.194.129:3000/uploads.**\n\n\n**The constructed payload is then sent to the**\n**command-and-control (C2) server using the**\n**Node.js HTTP request library. Specifically, the**\n**function makes an HTTP POST request by calling**\n**a method on the imported request module (after**\n\n**decoding, this corresponds to request.post).**\n**The target URL for the POST is also dynamically**\n**constructed from Base64-encoded fragments,**\n**making it harder to detect. This POST request**\n**delivers the packaged data over the network,**\n**effectively exfiltrating the sensitive information to**\n**the remote C2 server controlled by the attacker.**\n\n**Specific function to send data via HTTPs post to /uploads**\n\n\n**Decoding C2 URL from JS code**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Anti-Analysis\n\n**The anti-analysis code employs one-time execution wrappers and console hijacking techniques to complicate**\n**both static and dynamic analysis. The one-time wrappers (functions like a6 and a8) allow critical functions to**\n**run only once, immediately nulling the callback afterward so that subsequent calls yield no effect. This prevents**\n**analysts from repeatedly invoking or modifying key functions during debugging or automated analysis.**\n**Additionally, a self-referential check (in a7) examines the function's own string representation, a tactic intended**\n**to detect tampering or reverse engineering attempts.**\n\n**In parallel, the script modifies standard console methods (via the function wrapped in a9) by replacing them**\n**with custom bound functions. This console hijacking obscures debug output and interferes with traditional**\n**logging, making it harder to trace internal operations during runtime. Together, these techniques hinder the**\n**analyst’s ability to fully understand or debug the malware, thus enhancing its resistance against analysis and**\n**reverse engineering.**\n\n**Anti Analysis one-time execution wrapper**\n\n**Modifying Console functions**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n**Operation Marstech Mayhem exposes a critical evolution in the Lazarus Group's supply chain attacks,**\n**demonstrating not only their commitment to operational stealth but also significant adaptability in implant**\n**development. The introduction of the Marstech1 implant, with its layered obfuscation techniques—from**\n**control flow flattening and dynamic variable renaming in JavaScript to multi-stage XOR decryption in Python—**\n**underscores the threat actor’s sophisticated approach to evading both static and dynamic analysis.**\n\n**The discovery of novel command-and-control infrastructure operating on unconventional ports and hosting**\n**unique Node.js Express backends highlights a deliberate shift from previous tactics seen in Operations 99**\n**and Phantom Circuit. This divergence in operational methodology not only complicates detection but also**\n**suggests that the Lazarus Group is continuously refining their techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in modern**\n**software supply chains, including the targeting of cryptocurrency wallets and tampering with browser extension**\n**configurations.**\n\n**Furthermore, the integration of these implants within legitimate repositories on GitHub, and their subsequent**\n**embedding in trusted software packages, poses a significant risk to both developers and end-users alike. The**\n**use of advanced anti-debugging measures and self-modifying code further exacerbates the challenge of real-**\n**time threat analysis, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and a robust security framework in supply**\n**chain management.**\n\n**In summary, the findings of Operation Marstech Mayhem serve as a stark reminder that the landscape of**\n**cyber threats is rapidly evolving. It is imperative for organizations and developers to adopt proactive security**\n**measures, continuously monitor supply chain activities, and integrate advanced threat intelligence solutions to**\n**mitigate the risk of sophisticated implant-based attacks orchestrated by threat actors like the Lazarus Group.**\n\n#### Contact STRIKE for Incident Response\n\n**SecurityScorecard’s STRIKE Team has access to one of the world’s largest databases of cybersecurity signals,**\n**dedicated to identifying threats that evade conventional defenses.
