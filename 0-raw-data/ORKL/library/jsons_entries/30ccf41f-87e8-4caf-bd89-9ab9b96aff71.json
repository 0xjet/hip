    "plain_text": "CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n# European Energy Sector Organization Targeted by PupyRAT Malware in Late 2019\n\n## By Insikt Group®\n\n\n-----\n\n_This report is based on proprietary Recorded Future network traffic analysis of RAT_\n_controllers detected using signatures developed by Insikt Group researchers. The_\n_period of analysis covers November 28, 2019 through January 5, 2020._\n\n_This report will primarily be of interest to SOC analysts and threat intelligence_\n_professionals in organizations operating in the energy sector who are conducting threat_\n_hunting assignments relating to malware used by Iranian nation-state threat actors._\n\nOver the course of the last year, [Recorded Future research has](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-operations-infrastructure/)\ndemonstrated that Iran-nexus groups, possibly including APT33\n(also called Elfin), have been prolific in amassing operational network\ninfrastructure throughout 2019. Additionally, in November 2019,\n[Microsoft disclosed that APT33 had shifted focus from targeting](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-apt33-industrial-control-systems/)\nIT networks to physical control systems used in electric utilities,\nmanufacturing, and oil refineries. We also documented state[sponsored Iran-nexus groups making heavy use of freely available](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\ncommodity malware for active network intrusions. These tools are\nusually intended to be used for defensive red-teaming exercises.\nOne such tool used by several Iran-nexus groups is PupyRAT.\n\nUsing Recorded Future remote access trojan (RAT) controller\ndetections and network traffic analysis techniques, Insikt\nGroup identified a PupyRAT command and control (C2) server\ncommunicating with a mail server for a European energy sector\norganization from late November 2019 until at least January 5,\n2020. While metadata alone does not confirm a compromise, we\nassess that the high volume and repeated communications from\nthe targeted mail server to a PupyRAT C2 are sufficient to indicate\na likely intrusion.\n\n[PupyRAT is an open source RAT available on Github, and according](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)\nto the developer, it is a “cross-platform, multi-function RAT and\npost-exploitation tool mainly written in Python.” It has been used\n[previously by Iranian groups APT33 (Elfin, Magic Hound, HOLMIUM)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/)\n[and COBALT GYPSY (which overlaps with APT34/OilRig).](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations)\n\nAlthough this commodity RAT, PupyRAT, is known to have been\nused by Iranian threat actor groups APT33 and COBALT GYPSY, we\ncannot confirm whether the PupyRAT controller we identified is\nused by either Iranian group. Whoever the attacker is, the targeting\nof a mail server at a high-value critical infrastructure organization\ncould give an adversary access to sensitive information on energy\nallocation and resourcing in Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targeting of a key organization in the European energy sector is\nof particular interest given their role in the coordination of European\nenergy resources. Iranian groups (and others) have targeted a wide\nvariety of industries in the U.S. and Europe, with recent reporting\n[indicating an increase in the targeting of energy sector industrial](https://www.securityweek.com/iran-linked-zerocleare-wiper-targets-energy-industrial-sectors-middle-east)\n[control software.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/apt33-microsoft-iran-ics/)\n\nWe emphasize that this activity predates the recent escalation of\nkinetic activity between the U.S. and Iran, and therefore likely relates\nto espionage-motivated intrusion activity or the prepositioning of\nnetwork access within a high-value network in the European energy\nsector.\n\nTo defend against commodity RATs such as PupyRAT and others,\nRecorded Future recommends that organizations:\n\n - Monitor for sequential login attempts from the same IP\n\nagainst different accounts. This type of activity is more\ndifficult to detect than traditional brute forcing, but will\nhelp insulate organizations from a favored tactic of cyber\noperators.\n\n - Introduce multi-factor authentication. This has proven to be\n\na highly effective mitigation practice for many organizations\nthat have historically experienced a high level of credential\nstuffing and password-spraying attacks.\n\n - Use a password manager and set a unique strong password\n\nfor each online account.\n\n - Analyze and cross-reference log data. This may help to detect\n\nincidents involving high-frequency lockouts, unsanctioned\nremote access attempts, temporal attack overlaps across\nmultiple user accounts, and fingerprint unique web browser\nagent information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
