Initially, Microsoft\nattributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 – a temporary name given by\nthe tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal\nransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in\nrecent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S\n\nThe ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting\nthem with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns\ndistribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via\nmalicious advertisements.\n\nAlthough Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors\nbehind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques.\nLet’s take a look at Royal, their tactics and techniques, and what organizations can do to\nprotect themselves and keep their cyber environments safe.\n\n\n-----\n\n## royal ransomware attacks\n\n### SILVERESTONE CIRCUIT\n\nIn September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their\nmalicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other\nransomware operation’s encryptors, such as BlackCat.\n\nBy November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United\nKingdom’s most popular racing circuits – Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of\nFormula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed,\nbut Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal’s ransomware is secure,\nits encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups,\nRoyal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files\nrather than using randomly generated extensions.\n\n### TRAVIS CENTRAL APPRAISAL DISTRICT\n\nThe threat actors followed up this attack with an attack on the Travis Central Appraisal\nDistrict in December 2022. The agency provides appraisal values for properties. As a result\nof the attack, the agency’s servers, website, and email were shut down for more than two\nweeks. However, because the agency diversified where its information was stored, it was\nable to continue operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### HC3\n\nAlso in December 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services Cybersecurity\nCoordination Center (HC3) warned that Royal based ransomware attacks were steadily\nincreasing. Ransom demands from the threat actor ranged from $250,000 to more than $2\nmillion. HC3 also stated that Royal should be considered a threat to the health and public\nhealth sectors due to the ransomware group victimizing the healthcare community.\n\n[Initially Royal was using BlackCat’s encryptor but they transitioned to using their own Zeon](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/blackcat-ransomware-triple-extortion-analysis-tactics)\nencryptor, leaving behind a ransomware note that looked very similar to Conti’s ransomware\nnotes. If you recall, Conti was notorious for targeting the healthcare sector as well. The threat\nactors behind the Zeon encryptor were seen impersonating healthcare patient data software\nback in October 2022.\n\nAvertium’s technology partner, AdvIntel confirmed that the attackers contacted healthcare\nemployees of targeted organizations and gained access via the Zoho remote access tool.\nSince the middle of September 2022, Royal has been using their branded name in their\nransom notes generated by a new encryptor.\n\nImage 1: A Zeon Ransomware Note\n\n_Source: Bleeping Computer_\n\nCurrently, Royal is relying on malicious ads (malvertising), phishing links that point to a\nmalware downloader masquerading as software installers, updates embedded in spam\nemails, fake forum pages, and blog comments to spread their ransomware. The group’s\n[phishing attacks include callback phishing where they impersonate food delivery and](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/everything-you-need-to-know-about-callback-phishing)\nsoftware providers in emails that look like subscription renewals. The phishing emails contain\nphone numbers that the victim must contact to cancel the “subscription”. Once the victim\n\n\n-----\n\ncalls the number, they speak to threat actors who use social engineering to convince the\nvictim to install remote access software. This remote access software is used to gain initial\naccess to corporate networks.\n\nRoyal does not have a data leak site and they are not a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nwith affiliates. Also, the group is low key and does not announce their attacks. The ransom\nnote left behind is named README.TXT and contains a link to a private Tor negotiation\npage. The negotiation page consists of a chat screen for communication with Royal\nransomware operators. Sometimes, Royal will decrypt a few files to prove to their victims that\ntheir decryptor works. They will also share file lists of stolen data at times.\n\nImage 2: Royal's Newly Branded Ransomware Note\n\n_Source: Bleeping Computer_\n\n## royal/dev-0569 tactics & techniques\n\nAs previously stated, Royal ransomware emerged in January 2022, but their attacks were\nnot noticed by security researchers until September 2022. Initially attributed to DEV-0569,\nRoyal ransomware is distributed by vetted threat actors and the attacks using the\nransomware show a pattern of continuous innovation. Royal has displayed a consistent\nincorporation of new defense evasion, techniques, and various post-compromise payloads.\n\nSince Royal emerged, the ransomware operators have evolved their delivery methods to\ninclude:\n\nUsing Google Ads in a campaign to blend in with normal ad traffic.\nMaking malicious downloads appear authentic by hosting fake installer files on\nlegitimate looking software download sites.\nUsing contact forms located on an organization’s website to distribute phishing links.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above methods have allowed the ransomware operators to reach a greater number of\ntargets and achieve their goal of deploying various post-compromise payloads. Microsoft\nstated that Royal uses signed binaries and delivers encrypted malware payloads – relying\nheavily on defense evasion techniques.\n\nThe group has also continued to use Nsudo, an open-source tool, to try and disable antivirus\nsolutions. As previously stated, Royal has a few ways of gaining initial access and one of\nthose ways is via malicious links delivered to their targets. The links are embedded in\nadvertisements, fake forum pages, phishing emails, and blog comments. After the victim\nclicks, the links lead them to malicious files signed by Royal using a legitimate certificate.\n\nThe malicious files masquerade as installers or updates for applications such as Zoom or\nMicrosoft teams. The victim does not know that the files are malware downloaders known as\nBATLOADER. When the legitimate applications are launched, BATLOADER uses MSI\nCustom Actions to launch malicious PowerShell activity. BATLOADER also uses the MSI\nCustom Actions to run batch scripts that attempt to disable security solutions, leading to the\ndelivery of various encrypted malware payloads.\n\nBetween August and October 2022, Royal’s observed activity included BATLOADER being\nhosted on attacker-created domains masquerading as software download sites such as\n_anydeskos[.]com, and on legitimate repositories such as OneDrive and GitHub._\n\nImage 3: BATLOADER Masquerading as a TeamViewer Installer\n\n_Source: Microsoft_\n\nIn addition to using installer files, Royal uses file formats such as Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) to\nimpersonate legitimate software for first-stage payloads. Royal also uses various infection\nchains that use PowerShell and batch scripts, ultimately leading to the download of malware\npayloads such as a legitimate remote management tool used for persistence on the network.\nThe management tool also acts as an access point for the staging and spreading of\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy late October 2022, Royal was using malicious Google Ads to deliver BATLOADER in\nwhat researchers are calling a malvertising campaign. The Google Ads pointed to the\nlegitimate traffic distribution system (TDS) Keitaro. According to Microsoft, Keitaro provides\ncapabilities to customize advertising campaigns via tracking and ad traffic and user or\ndevice-based filtering. The TDS redirects the victim to a legitimate download site or to a\nmalicious BATLOADER download site. By using Keitaro, Royal can filter traffic and avoid IP\nranges of known security sandboxing solutions.\n\n## what organizations can do\n\nAlthough there are no confirmed reports of successful ransomware payments between Royal\nand their victims, evolving ransomware groups like Royal don’t give up easily. They will keep\nevolving their tactics and techniques, targeting enterprises and organizations until they\nachieve their ultimate goal – financial gain. Fortunately, there are ways organizations can\nstay safe and protect themselves from Royal:\n\nEnabling Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will help guard against phishing by\ninspecting the body of emails and URLs for patterns.\nRoyal’s phishing campaigns abuses legitimate services; therefore, organizations should\nleverage mail flow rules and capture suspicious keywords or review broad exceptions\nsuch as those related to domain-level allow lists and IP ranges.\n[Also, enabling Safe Links for Microsoft Teams, emails, and Office Apps will also help](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links?view=o365-worldwide)\nkeep your organization safe.\nUser awareness training regarding email threats and social engineering will help build\nresilience against Royal. After training, provide users with a method for reporting a\nsuspected attack.\nOrganizations should maintain credential hygiene and practice the principle of least\nprivilege. This means that an organization should provide access a user absolutely\nneeds to do their job. Organizations should also ensure that the accounts have strong\npasswords and multifactor authentication.\nTo prevent threat actors from stopping security services, organizations should turn on\ntamper-protection features.\n\nMaking sure that your organization takes proactive measures by keeping track of Indicators\nof Compromise (IoCs) and by keeping track of Royal’s attack methods will ensure good\ndefense against Royal ransomware.\n\n## How Avertium is Protecting Our CUSTOMERS\n\nIt’s important to get ahead of the curve by being proactive with protecting your organization,\ninstead of waiting to put out a massive fire.

Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software\nor hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or\nproprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location\n(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and\ndomain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.\n\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or\nunrecognized accounts.\n\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can\nhelp prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and\naccess to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.\n\nConsider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\n\nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and\nlateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If\nthreat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating\nprivileges and/or moving laterally.\n\n**MITRE Map**\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n\n**Hashes**\n\n01492156ce8b4034c5b1027130f4cf4e\n\n\n-----\n\nafd5d656a42a746e95926ef07933f054\n04028a0a1d44f81709040c31af026785209d4343\n6b0deb67a178fe20e81691133b257df3bafa3006\n2598e8adb87976abe48f0eba4bbb9a7cb69439e0c133b21aee3845dfccf3fb8f\n9db958bc5b4a21340ceeeb8c36873aa6bd02a460e688de56ccbba945384b1926\n\n**Supporting Documentation**\n\n[New Royal Ransomware emerges in multi-million dollar attacks (bleepingcomputer.com)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-royal-ransomware-emerges-in-multi-million-dollar-attacks/)\n\nHHS warns Royal ransomware threat targeting healthcare providers | SC Media\n(scmagazine.com)\n\nDEV-0569 finds new ways to deliver Royal ransomware, various payloads - Microsoft\nSecurity Blog\n\nPopular UK motor racing circuit investigating ransomware attack - The Record by Recorded\nFuture\n\n[This sneaky ransomware gang keeps changing tactics to spread its malware | ZDNET](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-sneaky-ransomware-gang-keeps-changing-tactics-to-spread-its-malware/)\n\nMicrosoft: Royal ransomware group using Google Ads in campaign - The Record by\nRecorded Future\n\nMicrosoft Warns of Cybercrime Group Delivering Royal Ransomware, Other Malware |\nSecurityWeek.Com\n\n[Travis Central Appraisal District hit with ransomware, officials say (statesman.com)](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/12/05/travis-county-tx-home-appraisals-ransomware-attack/69703419007/)\n\nH-ISAC TLP Green Threat Bulletin: Zeon Threat Group Impersonating Healthcare Patient\nData Software Solutions | AHA\n\n[202212071400_Royal Ransomware Analyst Note_TLPCLEAR (hhs.gov)](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/royal-ransomware-analyst-note.pdf)\n\n## APPENDIX II: Disclaimer\n\n_This document and its contents do not constitute, and are not a substitute for, legal advice._\n_The outcome of a Security Risk Assessment should be utilized to ensure that diligent_\n_measures are taken to lower the risk of potential weaknesses be exploited to compromise_\n_data._\n\n_Although the Services and this report may provide data that Client can use in its compliance_\n_efforts, Client (not Avertium) is ultimately responsible for assessing and meeting Client's own_\n_compliance responsibilities.
