There are strong incentives for adversary nations to understand the intentions\nand preferences of the people and parties that will shape a country's future path and to\n[reduce uncertainty about likely winners. Mandiant Threat Intelligence regularly observes](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)\ncyber espionage operations we believe to be seeking election-related information targeting\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernments, civil society, media, and technology organizations around the globe. We have\nalso seen disruptive and destructive cyber attacks and propaganda campaigns seeking to\nundermine targeted governments and influence the outcomes of electoral contests.\n\nThe 2020 U.S. elections are currently drawing attention to election cyber risks, but 2020 has\nalready hosted dozens of elections worldwide, with more to come. In the Asia-Pacific region\nthese included elections in Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Singapore to name a few, with\nregional elections scheduled for Indonesia in December.\n\nGiven the prevalence of such activity worldwide and Mandiant's unique visibility into threat\nactor activity, we believe it is worthwhile to examine trends in adversary targeting of elections\nin a variety of regional contexts because the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nused in one region today may soon be deployed or mimicked in other regions.\n\n**Notable Electoral Targeting in Asia-Pacific Region**\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence tracked numerous elections-related incidents in the Asia-Pacific\nregion in recent years. During this time, the most prolific regional actor was China, which we\nobserved in more than 20 elections-related campaigns most frequently affecting Hong Kong\nand Taiwan. We believe that China's primary motives for elections targeting includes\nmonitoring political developments, internal stability, and supporting Belt and Road Initiative\n(BRI) investments.\n\nExamples of Chinese cyber espionage targeting electoral support organizations include:\n\nTargeting candidates and related staff associated with the November 2019 Hong Kong\nDistrict Council elections with a malicious macro document.\nTargeting the Australian Parliament in February 2019, three months before the\ncountry's general elections.\nCompromising Cambodia's National Election Commission in mid-2018 based on the\nuse of AIRBREAK malware by APT40, possibly looking to understand the impact of the\n[election outcome on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plans. See our blog post for more](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections)\ndetails about this campaign.\nA spear phishing campaign targeting multiple government agencies in Southeast Asia\nin the spring of 2018 to deliver FIREPIT payloads. The nature of the lure material and\ntargeting indicate the activity was potentially an effort to monitor an upcoming election\nin the affected country.\n\nSpecifically, Mandiant has observed multiple instances in which organizations such as\nelectoral boards and commissions that support or help administer elections have been\ntargeted. Both Russian and Chinese cyber espionage operations have targeted election\nadministrators and government officials since at least 2014. Observed TTPs include phishing\nand strategic website compromise (SWC), also known as watering hole attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, in the November 2019 activity targeting Hong Kong (previously referenced),\nMandiant Threat Intelligence believes that candidates or related staff associated with the\nHong Kong District Council elections were targeted with a malicious macro document just\nprior to the elections based on geolocation information, the spear-phishing lure, and other\ndata.\n\n\nDecoy content from phishing email\n\n\nFigure 1: Decoy content from phishing email\n\n**Elections Ecosystem**\n\nAs our readers will know, Mandiant takes a specific approach to deconstructing attacks\n[against elections, which we detailed in a previous blog post.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/framing-problem-cyber-threats-and-elections)\n\n\n-----\n\nOur approach examines threats through the lens of risk posed at various levels of the\nelections ecosystem. We break the elections threat landscape into distinct attack surfaces to\nbetter allow our customers and partners to take action. These include the following:\n\nElectoral Platforms Affecting Public Opinion\nElectoral Process Support Organizations\nCore Electoral Process Systems\n\n\nAttack surfaces associated with the electoral process\n\n\nFigure 2: Attack surfaces associated with the electoral process\n\n**Top Target of Election Cyber Threat Activity: Public Opinion**\n\nUsing our ecosystem taxonomy, based on activity observed from 2016 to 2019, Mandiant\nThreat Intelligence assesses that actors concentrated on \"platforms affecting public opinion\"\nmuch more often than \"core election systems\" such as voting machines, or \"electoral support\n\n\n-----\n\norganizations such as election commissions.\n\n\nElectoral platforms affecting public opinions are most frequently targeted\n\n\nFigure 3: Electoral platforms affecting public opinions are most frequently targeted\nGlobally, we assess that actors continue to deploy disinformation in the form of fabricated\nnews and hoaxes spread primarily via social media and counterfeit websites designed to\nmimic legitimate news organizations, which may be picked up by legitimate news\norganizations. In the last several years, we have seen influence operations use increasingly\ncreative methods to blend their inauthentic messaging with legitimate speech (e.g., by\ninterviewing, impersonating, and hiring legitimate journalists or experts, and sending letters\nto the editor to real publications).\n\nMalicious actors create and spread disinformation with the intent to mislead an electorate by\ncausing reputational damage to an individual or political party, or by casting doubt regarding\na particular issue or political process. Influence campaigns also seek to exacerbate existing\nsocietal divisions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed pro-China threat actors\nspoof Taiwanese media outlet TVBS (官方網站) to promote narratives in line with the\nPeople's Republic of China's (PRC's) political interests in a coordinated, inauthentic\nmanner. The accounts use a variety of tactics in order to pose as Western media outlets,\nincluding the use of identical or near-identical usernames, display names, and profile photos\nas the accounts of the outlets they imitate.\n\n@TVSBnews quote-tweets People's Daily video citing alleged U.S.\ninterference in foreign elections\n\n\nFigure 4:\n\n@TVSBnews quote-tweets People's Daily video citing alleged U.S. interference in foreign\nelections\nPublic exposure of high-profile information operations, such as Russia's interference in the\n2016 U.S. presidential election, has strengthened perceptions that such operations are\neffective. It also demonstrates the difficulty that open societies face in countering this threat,\nencouraging current and aspiring information operation sponsors to grow their efforts. We\nanticipate that influence operations conducted in support of the political interests of nationstates will increase in sophistication, volume, and diversity of actors through 2020 and\nbeyond.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed and reported on information\noperations conducted in support of the political interests of numerous countries. During\nSingapore's 2020 general elections, the country's first \"digital\" election, Mandiant Threat\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelligence identified multiple inauthentic accounts. These accounts did not, however,\nappear to be acting in a coordinated manner.\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nWe expect that threat actors will continue to target entities associated with elections\nworldwide for the foreseeable future and may expand the scope of this activity as long as the\npotential rewards of these operations outweigh the risks. State-sponsored actors almost\ncertainly view targeting the electoral process as an effective means of projecting power and\ncollecting intelligence.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous expansion of the social media landscape will likely encourage\nvarious actors to pursue information operations by promoting preferred narratives, including\nthe use of propagating inauthentic or deceptive information. We have already seen tactics\nevolve to avoid detection and incorporate emerging technologies, such as \"deepfake\" or\nmultimedia manipulation technology, to advance more believable and impactful information\noperations, and we expect these innovations to continue. Lower tech methods, such as\noutsourcing propaganda activities to real people hired specifically to spread false and\nmisleading content, can hinder attribution efforts and potentially increase the effectiveness of\noperations if those people have a more specialized understanding of the information\nenvironment.\n\nTo battle election threats, there is an urgent need to increase public awareness of the threat\nand inculcate behaviors that reduce the risk of compromise or disruption. These include\neverything from rigorously securing email to implementing policy around notification of cyber\nincidents in the supply chain. In addition, governments can consider mandating digital imprint\nrequirements for election campaigning, increasing fines for electoral fraud, and increasing\ntransparency around digital political advertisements. Investment in news verification and\nscreening methodologies on search and social media platforms as well as public education\nefforts equipping voters and students to distinguish trustworthy information from suspicions\nmay also reduce the impact of influence operations.\n\n\n-----",
