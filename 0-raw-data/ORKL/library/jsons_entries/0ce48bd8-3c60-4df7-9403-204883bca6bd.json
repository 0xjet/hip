Credential stuffing attacks, commonly\nreferred to as account cracking, apply valid username and password combinations, also known\nas user credentials or “combo lists”, from previously compromised online resources or data\nleaks. Malicious actors utilizing valid user credentials have the potential to access numerous\naccounts and services across multiple industries – to include media companies, retail,\nhealthcare, restaurant groups and food delivery – to fraudulently obtain goods, services and\n\n1 A proxy is an intermediary between an end user (a client) and an online resource (a server). In the context of\ncredential stuffing, proxies are used to mask the true source of a credential stuffing attack, making it appear to the\ntarget that the requests are coming from the proxies and not the computer executing the attack.\n\n2 Configurations, also known as “configs,” refer to a file containing instructions or configuration options used by a\ncredential stuffing tool to customize an attack against a particular target.\n\n\n-----\n\naccess other online resources such as financial accounts at the expense of legitimate account\nholders.\n\nThe FBI acknowledges the Australian Federal Police for their assistance collecting the\ninformation included in this Private Industry Notification.\n\n### Threat\n\nCyber criminals leverage proxies and configurations to mask and automate credential stuffing\nattacks on online customer accounts of US companies. Credential stuffing, a type of brute force\nattack that exploits leaked user credentials from a website breach or purchased on dark web\ncredential selling websites, takes advantage of the fact that many users reuse usernames and\npasswords across multiple accounts and services. Leveraging proxies and configurations\nautomates the process of attempting logins across various sites and facilitates exploitation of\nonline accounts. In particular, media companies and restaurant groups are considered lucrative\ntargets for credential stuffing attacks due to the number of customer accounts, the general\ndemand for their services, and the relative lack of importance users place on these types of\naccounts.\n\nNumerous publicly accessible websites offer for sale compromised account credentials from\npopular online services. Two such websites investigated by the FBI and the Australian Federal\nPolice were found to contain over 300,000 unique sets of credentials obtained via credential\nstuffing. The websites had over 175,000 registered customers and over 400,000 USD in sales. In\naddition to “combo lists” purchased from cyber criminal forums and websites dedicated to\naccount cracking, cyber criminals can acquire configurations or “configs”, which facilitate\nattacks by customizing credential stuffing tools to gain access to a particular target website. The\nconfig may include the website address to target, how to form the HTTP request, how to\ndifferentiate between a successful vs unsuccessful login attempt, whether proxies are needed,\netc. In addition, cracking tutorial videos available via social media platforms and hacker forums\nmake it relatively easy to learn how to crack accounts using credential stuffing and other\ntechniques.\n\nActors may opt to use proxies purchased from proxy services, including legitimate proxy service\nproviders, to facilitate bypassing a website’s defenses by obfuscating the actual IP addresses,\nwhich may be individually blocked or originate from certain geographic regions. In executing\nsuccessful credential stuffing attacks, cyber criminals have relied extensively on the use of\nresidential proxies, which are connected to residential internet connections and therefore are\nless likely to be identified as abnormal. Existing security protocols do not block or flag\nresidential proxies as often as proxies associated with data centers. In some instances, actors\nconduct credential stuffing attacks without the use of proxies, requiring less time and financial\nresources to execute. Some cracking tools, including one of the most popular automated attack\ntools, allow actors to run the software without proxies.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber criminals may also target a company’s mobile applications as well as the website. Mobile\napplications, which often have weaker security protocols than traditional web applications,\nfrequently permit a higher rate of login attempts, known as checks per minute (CPMs),\nfacilitating faster account validation. Cyber criminals leverage packet capture software, such as\nWireshark[3], Burp Suite[4], or Fiddler[5] to record and gain an understanding of the authentication\nmechanism employed by the targeted website and/or mobile application. This allows the cyber\ncriminal to craft a custom configuration for credential stuffing activities. Other cyber criminals\nbuy configurations created by others or obtain them from hacking forums. Cyber criminals have\nemployed dedicated, hosted servers to execute credential stuffing attacks.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nThe FBI recommends the following mitigating practices for companies to defend against\naccount cracking activity:\n\n  - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA adds additional layers of protection\nagainst credential stuffing attacks and is particularly helpful when a login request\nderives from an unusual location, such as an unexpected country.\n\n  - Educate users to avoid choosing passwords that have appeared in data breaches.\nMultiple websites maintain databases of breached usernames and passwords. Require\nall accounts to have strong, unique pass phrases. Pass phrases should not be reused\nacross multiple accounts.\n\n  - Download publicly available credential lists, test them against your customer accounts,\nand force password resets for customer accounts that use compromised credentials.\n\n  - Use fingerprinting. Fingerprinting allows websites to analyze information about clients\nin order to detect unusual activity, like attempts by a single IP address to log into several\ndifferent accounts.\n\n  - Research and consider implementing shadow banning. When a user is shadow banned,\ntheir activities, which are not propagated to other users or to system data, do not\nimpact the system. Because shadow banning limits users' activities in a way that is not\napparent, the user is unaware their access is limited. When utilized in conjunction with\nfingerprinting, shadow banning can prevent account crackers from determining the\nlegitimacy of credentials used during a login attempt. Ideally, shadow banning should be\nconfigured so that response times to requests from banned and non-banned IPs are\nindistinguishable.\n\n  - Identify and monitor for default user agent strings used by credential stuffing attack\ntools.\n\n3 Wireshark, a free open-source packet analyzer, is a network analysis tool used for network troubleshooting,\nanalysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.\n4 Burp Suite is a set of tools used to perform security testing of web applications.\n5 Fiddler is a web proxy server tool used to debug web applications by capturing network traffic between the\ninternet and test computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Ensure that both web-based access and mobile applications have the same, up-to-date\nsecurity protections. Disable older and less secure versions of applications.\n\n  - Use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) pinning[6] in mobile applications. SSL pinning makes it more\ndifficult for tools to track API requests, and applications that use it are generally more\ndifficult to crack.\n\n  - Search online for account cracking configurations tailored to your company’s website,\nthen make changes to that website to prevent the configurations from working.\n\n  - Employ cloud protection services (also known as content delivery networks, or CDNs),\nsome of which can detect and block suspicious traffic.\n\n  - Do not rely solely on CAPTCHA[7] to defend against credential stuffing and other\nautomated attacks. CAPTCHAs may help deter account cracking but can also be easily\ndefeated using CAPTCHA solving services.\n\nFor additional information, see Private Industry Notification 20200910-001 TLP: WHITE Cyber\n_Actors Conduct Credential Stuffing Attacks Against US Financial Sector, and I-112321-PSA Cyber_\n_Criminals Likely Developing and Selling Scamming Tools to Harvest Credentials of Brand-Name_\n_Consumers._\n\n6 SSL pinning is a process of associating a host with its certificate or public key. This security measure pins the\nidentity of trustworthy certificates on mobile applications and blocks unknown documents from the suspicious\nservers. SSL pinning is used as an additional security layer for application traffic.\n7 CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Reporting Notice\n\nThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal\n\nactivity to their local FBI field office.
