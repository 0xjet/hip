Unit 42 actively monitors\nthis group due to their persistent nature globally across all industry verticals. Recently, we discovered a\ncampaign launched at various Ministries of Foreign Affairs around the world. Interestingly, there appear to\nbe two parallel efforts within the campaign, with each effort using a completely different toolset for the\nattacks. In this blog, we will discuss one of the efforts which leveraged tools that have been known to be\nassociated with the Sofacy group.\n\n### Attack Details\n\nAt the beginning of February 2018, we discovered an attack targeting two government institutions related\nto foreign affairs. These entities are not regionally congruent, and the only shared victimology involves\ntheir organizational functions. Specifically, one organization is geographically located in Europe and the\nother in North America. The initial attack vector leveraged a phishing email (seen in Figure 1), using the\nsubject line of Upcoming Defense events February 2018 and a sender address claiming to be from Jane’s\n[360 defense events <events@ihsmarkit com> Jane’s (http://www janes com/) by IHSMarkit is a well](http://www.janes.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\noriginate from IHSMarkit at all. The lure text in the phishing email claims the attachment is a calendar of\nevents relevant to the targeted organizations and contained specific instructions regarding the actions the\nvictim would have to take if they had “trouble viewing the document”.\n\n_Figure 1 Spear-phishing email used in the attack campaign_\n\nThe attachment itself is an Microsoft Excel XLS document that contains malicious macro script. The\ndocument presents itself as a standard macro document but has all of its text hidden until the victim\nenables macros. Notably, all of the content text is accessible to the victim even before macros are\nenabled. However, a white font color is applied to the text to make it appear that the victim must enable\nmacros to access the content. Once the macro is enabled, the content is presented via the following\ncode:\n\nActiveSheet.Range(“a1:c54”).Font.Color = vbBlack\n\nThe code above changes the font color to black within the specified cell range and presents the content\nto the user. On initial inspection, the content appears to be the expected legitimate content, however,\ncloser examination of the document shows several abnormal artifacts that would not exist in a legitimate\ndocument. Figure 2 below shows how the delivery document initially looks and the transformation the\ncontent undergoes as the macro runs.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Delivery Document\n\nAs mentioned in a recent ISC diary entry\n(https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Simple+but+Effective+Malicious+XLS+Sheet/23305/), the macro gets\nthe contents of cells in column 170 in rows 2227 to 2248 to obtain the base64 encoded payload, which\ncan be seen in the following screenshot:\n\n_Figure 3 Delivery Document showing base64 encoded payload_\n\nThe macro prepends the string —–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—– to the beginning of the base64 encoded\npayload and appends —–END CERTIFICATE—– to the end of the data. The macro then writes this data to\na text file in the C:\\Programdata folder using a random filename with the .txt extension. The macro\nthen uses the command certutil ­decode to decode the contents of this text file and outputs the\ndecoded content to a randomly named file with a .exe extension in the C:\\Programdata folder. The\nmacro sleeps for two seconds and then executes the newly dropped executable.\n\nThe newly dropped executable is a loader Trojan responsible for installing and running the payload of this\nattack. We performed a more detailed analysis on this loader Trojan, which readers can view in this\nreport’s appendix. Upon execution, the loader will decrypt the embedded payload (DLL) using a custom\nalgorithm, decompress it and save it to the following file:\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\cdnver.dll\n\nThe loader will then create the batch file %LOCALAPPDATA%\\cdnver.bat, which it will write the\nfollowing:\n\nstart rundll32.exe “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\cdnver.dll”,#1\n\nThe loader Trojan uses this batch file to run the embedded DLL payload. For persistence, the loader will\nwrite the path to this batch file to the following registry key, which will run the batch file each time the user\nlogs into the system:\n\nHKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript\n\nThe cdnver.dll payload installed by the loader executable is a variant of the SofacyCarberp\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/carberp/) payload, which is used extensively by the\nSofacy threat group. Overall, SofacyCarberp does initial reconnaissance by gathering system information\n\n\n-----\n\nSofacyCarberp was configured to use the following domain as its C2 server:\n\ncdnverify[.]net\n\nThe loader and the SofacyCarberp sample delivered in this attack is similar to samples we have analyzed\nin the past but contains marked differences. These differences include a new hashing algorithm to resolve\nAPI functions and to find running browser processes for injection, as well as changes to the C2\ncommunication mechanisms as explained in detail within the appendix.\n\n### Open-source Delivery Document Generator\n\nIt appears that Sofacy may have used an open-source tool called Luckystrike\n(https://github.com/curi0usJack/luckystrike) to generate the delivery document and/or the macro used in\nthis attack. Luckystrike, which was presented at DerbyCon 6 in September 2016\n(https://www.shellntel.com/blog/2016/9/13/luckystrike-a-database-backed-evil-macro-generator), is a\nMicrosoft PowerShell-based tool that generates malicious delivery documents by allowing a user to add a\nmacro to an Excel or Word document to execute an embedded payload. We believe Sofacy used this tool,\nas the macro within their delivery document closely resembles the macros found within Luckystrike.\n\nTo confirm our suspicions, we generated a malicious Excel file with Luckystrike and compared its macro\nto the macro found within Sofacy’s delivery document. We found that there was only one difference\nbetween the macros besides the random function name and random cell values that the Luckystrike tool\ngenerates for each created payload. The one non-random string difference was the path to the “.txt” and\n“.exe” files within the command “certutil -decode”, as the Sofacy document used “C:⧵Programdata⧵” for\nthe path whereas the Luckystrike document used the path stored in the Application.UserLibraryPath\nenvironment variable. Figure 3 below shows a diff with the LuckyStrike macro on the left and Sofacy\nmacro on the right, where everything except the file path and randomly generated values in the macro are\nexactly the same, including the obfuscation attempts that use concatenation to build strings.\n\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/luckystrike_diff.png)\n\n_Figure 4 Diff of macros in Luckystrike generated document (left) and Sofacy’s delivery document (right)_\n\n### Discovery and relationships\n\nWith much of our research, our initial direction and discovery of emerging threats is generally some\ncombination of previously observed behavioral rulesets or relationships. In this case, we had observed a\nstrange pattern emerging from the Sofacy group over the past year within their command and control\ninfrastructure. Patterning such as reuse of WHOIS artifacts, IP reuse, or even domain name themes are\n\n\n-----\n\nrepeatedly over the course of the year. No other parts of the C2 infrastructure amongst these domains\ncontained any overlapping artifacts. Instead, the actual content within the body of the websites was an\nexact match in each instance. Specifically, the strings 866­593­54352 (notice it is one digit too long),\n403­965­2341, or the address 522 Clematis. Suite 3000 was repeatedly found in each instance.\n[ThreatConnect (https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/track-to-the-future/) had made the same](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/track-to-the-future/)\nobservation regarding this patterning in September 2017.\n\n_Figure 5 Default landing page for cdnverify.net domain_\n\n_Figure 6 Default landing page for hotfixmsupload.com domain_\n\nHotfixmsupload[.]com is particularly interesting as it has been identified as a Sofacy C2 domain\nrepeatedly, and was also brought forth by Microsoft in a legal complaint against STRONTIUM (Sofacy) as\n[documented here (https://noticeofpleadings.com/strontium/).](https://noticeofpleadings.com/strontium/)\n\n\n-----\n\nused by the Sofacy group. In this scenario, the domain cdnverify[.]net was registered on January 30,\n2018 and just two days later, an attack was launched using this domain as a C2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Sofacy group should no longer be an unfamiliar threat at this stage. They have been well documented\nand well researched with much of their attack methodologies exposed. They continue to be persistent in\ntheir attack campaigns and continue to use similar tooling as in the past. This leads us to believe that their\nattack attempts are likely still succeeding, even with the wealth of threat intelligence available in the public\ndomain. Application of the data remains challenging, and so to continue our initiative of establishing\nplaybooks for adversary groups, we have added this attack campaign as the next playbook (https://panunit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/) in our dataset.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat by:\n\n1. WildFire detects all SofacyCarberp payloads with malicious verdicts.\n2. AutoFocus customers can track these tools with the Sofacy\n\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Sofacy), SofacyMacro\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SofacyMacroDoc) and SofacyCarberp\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SofacyCarberp)\n3. Traps blocks the Sofacy delivery documents and the SofacyCarberp payload.\n\n### IOCs\n\n**SHA256**\n\nff808d0a12676bfac88fd26f955154f8884f2bb7c534b9936510fd6296c543e8\n\n12e6642cf6413bdf5388bee663080fa299591b2ba023d069286f3be9647547c8\n\ncb85072e6ca66a29cb0b73659a0fe5ba2456d9ba0b52e3a4c89e86549bc6e2c7\n\n23411bb30042c9357ac4928dc6fca6955390361e660fec7ac238bbdcc8b83701\n\n**Domains**\n\nCdnverify[.]net\n\n**Email Subject**\n\nUpcoming Defense events February 2018\n\n**Filename**\n\nUpcoming Events February 2018.xls\n\n### Appendix\n\n Loader Trojan\n\n\n-----\n\nexecuting a dynamic link library (DLL) to the system. This executable contains the same decryption\nalgorithm as the loader we analyzed in the DealersChoice attacks in late 2016\n[(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-dealerschoice-sofacys-flash-player-exploit-](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-dealerschoice-sofacys-flash-player-exploit-platform/)\nplatform/).\n\nThe loader has several coding features that make it interesting. For example, upon execution, the loader\nattempts to load the following library: api­ms­win­core­synch­l1­2­0.dll. This DLL is part of the\nUniversal Windows Platform app to Windows 10. Typically, a developer would not link directly to this file,\nbut to WindowsApp.lib, which gives access to the underlying APIs. It appears the loader included\ndefinitions of wrappers for Windows API functions that cannot be called directly because they are not\nsupported on all operating systems.\n\nUpon execution, the loader will decrypt the embedded payload (DLL) using a custom algorithm followed\nby decompressing it using the RtlDecompressBuffer API. This API is normally used for Windows\ndrivers, but there is nothing to prevent a userland process from using it, and the parameters are\ndocumented (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntifs/nf-ntifsrtldecompressbuffer) on MSDN. The compression algorithm used is LZNT1 with maximum compression\nlevel. The payload is decrypted using a starting 10-byte XOR key of: 0x3950BE2CD37B2C7CCBF8. Once\ndecrypted, the data is then passed to the decompression routine. The payload is in the loader at file\noffset: 0x19880 – 0x1F23C size of 0x59BD. The payload can be decrypted and decompressed with\nthe following Python script:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\n\nimport ctypes\nnt  = ctypes.windll.ntdll\n\ndef decompress_buffer(data):\nfinal_size = ctypes.c_ulong(0)\nuncompressed =ctypes.c_buffer(0x7c00)\nnt.RtlDecompressBuffer(0x102,uncompressed,0x7C00,ctypes.c_char_p(data),0x59BD,ctypes.byref(fi\nreturn uncompressed.raw\n\ndef main():\nStartkey=\"3950BE2CD37B2C7CCBF8\".decode('hex')\nwith open(\"C:\\\\temp\\\\carvedDLL.dat\",\"rb\") as fp:\nPayload=fp.read()\ndecrpted=[]\nCount=0\nfor i in Payload:\nInnerCount=0\nkey=ord(i)\nfor x in range(0,len(Startkey)):\nresult = (ord(Startkey[x]) + Count * InnerCount) & 0xFF\nInnerCount+=1\nkey ^= result\nCount+=1\ndecrpted.append(key)\ndecompressed=decompress_buffer(str(bytearray(decrpted)))\nwith open(\"C:\\\\temp\\\\CarvedDLL_decrypted.dat\",\"wb\") as wp:\nwp.write(bytearray(decompressed))\nprint \"Finished\"\nif __name__ == '__main__':\nmain()\n\n\nThe loader will drop the following files in the %LOCALAPPDATA% file path:\n\nCdnver.dll\nCdnver.bat\n\nTo evade observable detection from Windows explorer, file attributes are set to hidden.\n%LOCALAPPDATA% would be the user’s path from the user who launched the executable, i.e.,\nC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local where the user would contain the user’s logon account.\n\nTo execute the dropped DLL, the loader first checks the integrity level of the executing process, and if it\ndoes not have the necessary permissions, the loader will enumerate the system’s processes searching for\n\n\n-----\n\nCreateProcessAsUser. If the user who executed the loader is admin or has sufficient privileges this\nstep is skipped. The execution is handled using the Windows rundll32.exe program and calls the\nDLL’s export via ordinal number 1. Example:\n\nstart rundll32.exe “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\cdnver.dll”,#1\n\nFor persistence, the loader will add the following registry key UserInitMprLogonScript to HKCU\n\\Environment with the following value:\n\nC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\cdnver.bat\n\nThis entry would cause the batch file to be executed any time the user logs on. The batch file contains\nthe following information:\n\nstart rundll32.exe “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\cdnver.dll”,#1\n\nThe use of the UserInitMprLogonScript is not new to Sofacy, as Mitre’s ATT&CK framework\n(https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1037) shows Sofacy’s use of this registry key as an example of\n[the Logon Scripts (https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1037) persistence technique.](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1037)\n\n### SofacyCarberp Payload\n\nThe DLL delivered in these attacks is a variant of the SofacyCarberp payload, which is used extensively by\nthe Sofacy threat group.\n\n### API Resolution\n\nPrevious versions of this Trojan used code taken from the leaked Carberp source code, which mainly\ninvolved Carberp’s code used to resolve API functions. However, this version of SofacyCarberp uses a\nhashing algorithm to locate the correct loaded DLL based on its BaseDLLName in order to manually load\nAPI functions. It does so by loading the PEB, then accesses the _PEB_LDR_DATA structure and then\nobtains the unicode string for BaseDllName in the InLoadOrderModuleList. It treats this unicode string\nas an ASCII string by skipping every other byte then gets the lowercase version of the string. It then\nsubjects the resulting string of lowercase characters to a hashing algorithm and checks the resulting hash\nto a hardcoded value. The following Python script shows the algorithm used to determine the hashed\nvalues:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\nl = [\"kernel32.dll\",\"ntdll.dll\"]\nfor lib in l:\nseed = 0\nfor e in lib:\nc = ord(e)\nif ord(e)-0x41 <= 25 and ord(e)-0x41 > 0:\nc = ord(e)+32\nseed = (c + 0x19660D * seed + 0x3C6EF35F )& 0xFFFFFFFF\n\nprint \"%s is 0x%x\" % (lib,seed)\n\n\nThe following is a list of hardcoded values used to find the correct loaded DLL:\n\n0x98853A78 – kernel32.dll\n0xA4137E37 – ntdll.dll\n\nIt specifically looks for the following APIs based on its hash:\n\n0x77b826b3 – ? (most likely ntdll.ZwProtectVirtualMemory based on code context)\n0x2e33c8ac – ntdll.ZwWriteVirtualMemory\n0xb9016a44 – ntdll.ZwFreeVirtualMemory\n0xa2ea8afa – ntdll.ZwQuerySystemInformation\n\n\n-----\n\n0x3B66D24C – kernel32.?\n0x79F5D836 – kernel32.?\n\n### Injecting into Browsers\n\nThe Trojan will use the same hashing algorithm for API resolution to find browser processes running on the\nsystem with the intention of injecting code into the browser to communicate with its C2 server. The use of\nthis hashing algorithm differs from previous variants of SofacyCarberp, as previously reported by ESET\n(https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-part1.pdf).\n\nTo begin the code injection, the Trojan calls the ZwQuerySystemInformation function, specifically\nrequesting for the data associated with SystemProcessInformation. The result is a structure named\nSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION, which the Trojan will access the Unicode string in the field\nImageName (offset 0x3c). The Trojan then subjects this unicode string in ASCII format to the\nhashing algorithm, looking for the following:\n\n0xCDCB4E50 – iexplore.exe\n0x70297938 – firefox.exe\n0x723F0158 – chrome.exe\n\nThe Trojan will attempt to inject code into these browsers to carry out its C2 communications. To carry out\nC2 communications via injected code in a remote process, the injected code reaches out to the C2 server\nand saves the response to a memory mapped file named SNFIRNW. The Trojan uses a custom\ncommunication protocol within this mapped file, but at a high level the Trojan will continually look for data\nwithin the mapped SNFIRNW file and process the data in the same manner as if it communicated with the\nC2 server within its own process.\n\n### Command and Control Communications\n\nIn addition to being able to communicate with its C2 server from code injected into a web browser, the\nTrojan can also carry out the same communication process within its own process. The C2\ncommunication uses HTTPS and specifically sets the following flags to do so in a manner to allow invalid\ncertificates:\n\nSECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_DATE_INVALID|SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_CN_INVALID|SEC\nURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CA|SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_REVOCATION\n\nThe initial request sent from the Trojan is to google.com, likely as an internet connectivity check.\n\n_Figure 7 Initial request from SofacyCarberp Trojan to Google to check for Internet access_\n\nAs seen in the activity above, the Trojan issues a POST request to a URL that contains randomly sized and\nrandomly generated strings. The URL also contains a randomly chosen string from the following list:\n\n\n-----\n\n.ktx\n.rfc822\n.vnd.flatland.3dml\n.report\n.vnd.radisys.msml-basic-layout\n.3gpp\n\nThis list of strings differs from previously analyzed SofacyCarberp samples, such as the variant discussed\nin our June 2016 blog “New Sofacy Attacks Against US Government Agency\n[(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-government-agency/)\ngovernment-agency/)“ that chose from a list of strings .xml, .pdf, .htm or .zip.\n\nThe value for the one parameter, specifically WrLqG1kMJXpgID1rODM= is base64 encoded ciphertext that\ndecrypts to the string UihklEpz4V, which is hardcoded in the Trojan. The algorithm used to encrypt the\ndata in the URL the same algorithm as used in previous SofacyCarberp samples\n[(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-government-agency/)\ngovernment-agency/) we have analyzed (https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42dealerschoice-sofacys-flash-player-exploit-platform). The data in the POST request is the base64\nencoded user-agent seen in the request.\n\nAfter establishing that the system has Internet access, the Trojan will gather detailed system information\nand send it to the C2 server. The gathered information includes a unique identifier based on the storage\nvolume serial number (id field), a list of running processes, network interface card information, the storage\ndevice name (disk field), the Trojan’s build identifier (build field, specifically 0x9104f000), followed by a\nscreenshot of the system (img field). The screenshot functionality in this Trojan is rather interesting, as\ninstead of using Windows APIs to take a screenshot, the Trojan’s code simulates the user pressing the\n“Take Screenshot” key (VK_SCREENSHOT) on the keyboard which saves the screenshot to the clipboard.\nThe Trojan then accesses the data in the clipboard and converts it to a JPG image to include in this HTTP\nrequest. All of this data is encrypted, base64 encoded and sent to the C2 server in a HTTP POST to a\nURL that a similar structure as the initial internet connectivity check.\n\n_Figure 8 HTTP POST from SofacyCarberp to C2 server with system information_\n\nThe SofacyCarberp Trojan parses the C2 server’s response to the request for data that the Trojan will then\nuse to download a secondary payload to the system. The Trojan looks in the response data for sections\nbetween the tags [file] and [/file] and [settings] and [/settings], which we have observed\nin other SofacyCarberp samples we have analyzed. However, this particular variant also contains another\nsection with the tags [shell] and [/shell]. The Trojan parses these sections for specific fields that\ndictate how the Trojan will operate, including where the Trojan will save the downloaded file, how the\nTrojan runs the secondary payload and what C2 location the Trojan should communicate with. The\nfollowing fields are parsed by the Trojan:\n\nFileName: Specified filename\nPathToSave: Path to specified file\nE C i h h ifi d fil\n\n\n-----\n\nLoadLib: Load the specified DLL into the current process\nReadFile: Reads a specified the file\nRundll: Runs the specified DLL with a specified exported function\nIP: Set C2 location\nshell: Run additional code in a newly created thread\n\nThe data in the shell section specified in the shell field is base64 encoded data that decodes to raw\nassembly. We surmise this fact based on the Trojan using the base64 decoded data to create a local\nthread, which suggests that the provided data can be any position independent code or shellcode.\n\n###### Got something to say?\n\nLeave a comment...\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-mail**\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail (required)\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n**SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTERS**\n\nEmail\n\n**COMPANY**\n\n[Company (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\n[Careers (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)\n\n[Sitemap (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)\n\nR t V l bilit (htt // l lt t k / it di l )\n\n\n-----\n\n[Privacy Policy (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)\n\n[Terms of Use (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n**ACCOUNT**\n\n[Manage Subscription (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)\n\n##  (https://www.linkedin.com/company/palo-alto-networks)   (https://www.facebook.com/PaloAltoNetworks/)   (https://twitter.com/PaloAltoNtwks)\n\n(https://ignite.paloaltonetworks.com/usa/?\n\nCampaignId=7010g000001IH8U&utm_content=Ignite18USA&utm_medium=390x90banner&utm_source=website)\n\n© 2016 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
