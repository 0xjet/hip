    "plain_text": "## Revealed: Operation Shady RAT\n\n#### By Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President, Threat Research, McAfee\n\n### An investigation of targeted intrusions into\n more than 70 global companies, governments, and non-profit organizations during the last five years\n\nVersion 1 1\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the last few years, especially since the public revelation of Operation Aurora, the targeted successful\nintrusion into Google and two dozen other companies, I have often been asked by our worldwide\ncustomers if they should worry about such sophisticated penetrations themselves or if that is a concern\nonly for government agencies, defense contractors, and perhaps Google. My answer in almost all cases\nhas been unequivocal: absolutely.\n\nHaving investigated intrusions such as Operation Aurora and NightDragon (the systemic long-term\ncompromise of Western oil and gas industry), as well as numerous others that have not been disclosed\npublicly, I am convinced that every company in every conceivable industry with significant size and\nvaluable intellectual property and trade secrets has been compromised (or will be shortly), with the great\nmajority of the victims rarely discovering the intrusion or its impact. In fact, I divide the entire set of\nFortune Global 2,000 firms into two categories: those that know they’ve been compromised and those\nthat don’t yet know.\n\nLately, with the rash of revelations about attacks on organizations such as RSA, Lockheed Martin,\nSony, PBS, and others, I have been asked by surprised reporters and customers whether the rate\nof intrusions is increasing and if it is a new phenomenon. I find the question ironic because these\ntypes of exploitations have occurred relentlessly for at least a half decade, and the majority of the\nrecent disclosures in the last six months have, in fact, been a result of relatively unsophisticated and\nopportunistic exploitations for the sake of notoriety by loosely organized political hacktivist groups\nsuch as Anonymous and Lulzsec. On the other hand, the targeted compromises we are focused\non — known as advanced persistent threats (APTs) — are much more insidious and occur largely without\npublic disclosures. They present a far greater threat to companies and governments, as the adversary\nis tenaciously persistent in achieving their objectives. The key to these intrusions is that the adversary is\nmotivated by a massive hunger for secrets and intellectual property; this is different from the immediate\nfinancial gratification that drives much of cybercrime, another serious but more manageable threat.\n\nWhat we have witnessed over the past five to six years has been nothing short of a historically\nunprecedented transfer of wealth — closely guarded national secrets (including those from classified\ngovernment networks), source code, bug databases, email archives, negotiation plans and exploration\ndetails for new oil and gas field auctions, document stores, legal contracts, supervisory control and\ndata acquisition (SCADA) configurations, design schematics, and much more has “fallen off the truck”\nof numerous, mostly Western companies and disappeared in the ever-growing electronic archives of\ndogged adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is happening to all this data — by now reaching petabytes as a whole — is still largely an open\nquestion. However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor\nat a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team’s playbook), the loss represents a massive\neconomic threat not just to individual companies and industries but to entire countries that face the\nprospect of decreased economic growth in a suddenly more competitive landscape and the loss of\njobs in industries that lose out to unscrupulous competitors in another part of the world. And let’s not\nforget the national security impact of the loss of sensitive intelligence or defense information.\n\nYet, the public (and often the industry) understanding of this significant national security threat is\n\nlargely minimal due to the very limited number of voluntary disclosures by victims of intrusion activity\ncompared to the actual number of compromises that take place. With the goal of raising the level\nof public awareness today, we are publishing the most comprehensive analysis ever revealed of victim\nprofiles from a five-year targeted operation by one specific actor — “Operation Shady RAT,” as I have\nnamed it at McAfee (RAT is a common acronym in the industry that stands for remote access tool).\n\nThis is not a new attack, and the vast majority of the victims have long since remediated these specific\n\ninfections (although whether most realized the seriousness of the intrusion or simply cleaned up the\ninfected machine without further analysis into the data loss is an open question). McAfee has detected\nthe malware variants and other relevant indicators for years with Generic Downloader.x and Generic\nBackDoor.t heuristic signatures (those who have had prior experience with this specific adversary may\nrecognize it by the use of encrypted HTML comments in web pages that serve as a command channel\nto the infected machine).\n\nMcAfee has gained access to one specific command and control (C&C) server used by the intruders.\nWe have collected logs that reveal the full extent of the victim population since mid-2006 when the log\ncollection began. Note that the actual intrusion activity may have begun well before that time, but that\nis the earliest evidence we have for the start of the compromises. The compromises themselves were\nstandard procedure for these types of targeted intrusions: a spear-phishing email containing an exploit\nis sent to an individual with the right level of access at the company, and the exploit, when opened,\non an unpatched system will trigger a download of the implant malware. That malware will execute\nand initiate a backdoor communication channel to the C&C web server and interpret the instructions\nencoded in the hidden comments embedded in the webpage code. This will be quickly followed by\nlive intruders jumping on to the infected machine and proceeding to quickly escalate privileges and\nmove laterally within the organization to establish new persistent footholds via additional compromised\nmachines running implant malware, as well as targeting for quick exfiltration the key data they came for.\n\nAfter painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim\norganizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from\nexplicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names\nis warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization,\nbut to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they\nare the United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national\nOlympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all, we identified 71 compromised parties (many more were present in the logs but without\nsufficient information to accurately identify them). Of these, the breakdown of 32 unique\norganization categories follows:\n\n# 6 13 13 6 12\n\n**Construction/** **3** **Electronics** **3** **Defense** **13** **Real Estate** **2** **International**\n**Heavy** **Industry** **Contractor** **Sports**\n\n|Defense Contractor|13|\n|---|---|\n\n|Real Estate|2|\n|---|---|\n|Accounting Industry|2|\n|Agriculture|1|\n|Insurance|1|\n\n|Construction/ Heavy Industry|3|\n|---|---|\n|Steel Industry|1|\n|Energy|1|\n|Solar Power|1|\n\n|International Sports|5|\n|---|---|\n|Economics/ Trade|2|\n|Think Tanks|2|\n|International Government/ Economics/ Trade|1|\n|Political Non-Profit|1|\n|US National Security Non-Profit|1|\n\n|Electronics Industry|3|\n|---|---|\n|Computer Security|2|\n|Information Technology|2|\n|Satellite Communica- tions|2|\n|News Media|2|\n|Information Services|1|\n|Communica- tions Technology|1|\n\n|US Federal Government|6|\n|---|---|\n|US State Government|5|\n|US County Government|3|\n|Canadian Government|2|\n|Vietnam Government|1|\n|Taiwan Government|1|\n|US Government Contractor|1|\n|United Nations|1|\n|Indian Government|1|\n\n\nSource: McAfee\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd for those who believe these compromises occur only in the United States, Canada, and Europe,\nallow me to change that perception with the following statistics on 14 geographic locations of the targets:\n\n#### 1\n\n 2 1\n 1\n 2 2\n 2 1 1\n\n 3\n\n 1 1\n\nVictim’s Country of Origin Victim Count Victim’s Country of Origin Victim Count\n\n**USA** 49 **Indonesia** 1\n\n**Canada** 4 **Vietnam** 1\n\n**South Korea** 2 **Denmark** 1\n\n**Taiwan** 3 **Singapore** 1\n\n**Japan** 2 **Hong Kong** 1\n\n**Switzerland** 2 **Germany** 1\n\n**United Kingdom** 2 **India** 1\n\nSource: McAfee\n\n|Victim’s Country of Origin|Victim Count|\n|---|---|\n|USA|49|\n|Canada|4|\n|South Korea|2|\n|Taiwan|3|\n|Japan|2|\n|Switzerland|2|\n|United Kingdom|2|\n\n|Victim’s Country of Origin|Victim Count|\n|---|---|\n|Indonesia|1|\n|Vietnam|1|\n|Denmark|1|\n|Singapore|1|\n|Hong Kong|1|\n|Germany|1|\n|India|1|\n\n\n#### 4\n\n 49\n\n\n#### 2\n\n\n#### 1\n\n\n#### 3\n\n\n#### 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe interest in the information held at the Asian and Western national Olympic Committees, as well\nas the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency in the lead-up and\nimmediate follow-up to the 2008 Olympics was particularly intriguing and potentially pointed a finger\nat a state actor behind the intrusions, because there is likely no commercial benefit to be earned from\nsuch hacks. The presence of political non-profits, such as a private western organization focused on\npromotion of democracy around the globe or a US national security think tank is also quite illuminating.\nHacking the United Nations or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat is also not\nlikely a motivation of a group interested only in economic gains.\n\nAnother fascinating aspect that the logs have revealed to us is the changing tasking orders of the\n\nperpetrators as the years have gone by. In 2006, the year that the logs begin, we saw only eight\nintrusions: two on South Korean steel and construction companies and one each on a Department\nof Energy Research Laboratory, a US real estate firm, international trade organizations of Asian and\nWestern nations and the ASEAN Secretariat. (That last intrusion began in October, a month prior to the\norganization’s annual summit in Singapore, and continued for another 10 months.) In 2007, the pace\nof activity jumped by a whopping 260 percent to a total of 29 victim organizations. That year we began\nto see new compromises of no fewer than four US defense contractors, Vietnam’s government-owned\ntechnology company, US federal government agency, several US state and county governments, and\none computer network security company. The compromises of the Olympic Committees of two nations\nin Asia and one Western country began that year as well. In 2008, the count went up further to 36\nvictims, including the United Nations and the World Anti-Doping Agency, and to 38 in 2009. Then the\nnumber of intrusions fell to 17 in 2010 and to 9 in 2011, likely due to the widespread availability of the\ncountermeasures for the specific intrusion indicators used by this specific actor. These measures caused\nthe perpetrator to adapt and increasingly employ a new set of implant families and C&C infrastructure\n(causing activity to disappear from the logs we analyzed). Even news media was not immune to the\ntargeting, with one major US news organization compromised at its New York headquarters and Hong\nKong bureau for more than 21 months.\n\nThe shortest time that an organization remained compromised was less than a single month; nine\n\nshare that honor: International Olympic Committee (IOC), Vietnam’s government-owned technology\ncompany, a trade organization of a nation in Asia, one Canadian government agency, one US defense\ncontractor, one US general government contractor, one US state and one county government, and\na US accounting firm. I must, however, caution that this may not necessarily be an indication of the\nrapid reaction of information security teams in those organizations, but perhaps merely evidence that\nthe actor was interested only in a quick smash and grab operation that did not require a persistent\ncompromise of the victim. The longest compromise was recorded at an Olympic Committee of a nation\nin Asia; it lasted on and off for 28 months, finally terminating in January 2010.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the complete list of all 71 targets, with country of origin, start date of the initial compromise\nand duration of the intrusions:\n\n|Victim|Country Intrusion|Start Date|Intrusion Duration (Months)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|South Korean Construction Company|South Korea|July 2006|17|\n|South Korean Steel Company|South Korea|July 2006|11|\n|Department of Energy Research Laboratory|USA|July 2006|3|\n|Trade Organization|Country in Asia|July 2006|1|\n|US International Trade Organization|USA|September 2006|12|\n|ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Secretariat|Indonesia|October 2006|10|\n|US Real-Estate Firm #1|USA|November 2006|8|\n|Vietnam’s Government-owned Technology Company|Vietnam|March 2007|1|\n|US Real-Estate Firm #2|USA|April 2007|17|\n|US Defense Contractor #1|USA|May 2007|21|\n|US Defense Contractor #2|USA|May 2007|20|\n|US Northern California County Government|USA|June 2007|7|\n|US Southern California County Government|USA|June 2007|24|\n|US State Government #1|USA|July 2007|6|\n|US Federal Government Agency #1|USA|July 2007|8|\n|Olympic Committee of Asian Country #1|Country in Asia|July 2007|28|\n|US State Government #2|USA|August 2007|1|\n|US State Government #3|USA|August 2007|25|\n|US Federal Government Agency #2|USA|August 2007|7|\n|Olympic Committee of Western Country|Western Country|August 2007|7|\n|Taiwanese Electronics Company|Taiwan|September 2007|8|\n|US Federal Government Agency #3|USA|September 2007|4|\n|US Federal Government Agency #4|USA|September 2007|8|\n|Western Non-Profit, Democracy-Promoting Organization|Western Country|September 2007|4|\n|Olympic Committee of Asian Country #2|Country in Asia|September 2007|7|\n|International Olympic Committee|Switzerland|November 2007|1|\n|US Defense Contractor #3|USA|November 2007|7|\n|US Network Security Company|USA|December 2007|3|\n|US Defense Contractor #4|USA|December 2007|7|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Victim|Country Intrusion|Start Date|Intrusion Duration (Months)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|US Accounting Firm|USA|January 2008|1|\n|US Electronics Company|USA|February 2008|13|\n|UK Computer Security Company|United Kingdom|February 2008|6|\n|US National Security Think Tank|USA|February 2008|20|\n|US Defense Contractor #5|USA|February 2008|9|\n|US Defense Contractor #6|USA|February 2008|2|\n|US State Government #4|USA|April 2008|2|\n|Taiwan Government Agency|Taiwan|April 2008|8|\n|US Government Contractor #1|USA|April 2008|1|\n|US Information Technology Company|USA|April 2008|7|\n|US Defense Contractor #7|USA|April 2008|16|\n|US Construction Company #1|USA|May 2008|19|\n|US Information Services Company|USA|May 2008|6|\n|Canadian Information Technology Company|Canada|July 2008|4|\n|US National Security Non-Profit|USA|July 2008|8|\n|Denmark Satellite Communications Company|Denmark|August 2008|6|\n|United Nations|Switzerland|September 2008|20|\n|Singapore Electronics Company|Singapore|November 2008|4|\n|UK Defense Contractor|United Kingdom|January 2009|12|\n|US Satellite Communications Company|USA|February 2009|25|\n|US Natural Gas Wholesale Company|USA|March 2009|7|\n|US Nevada County Government|USA|April 2009|1|\n|US State Government #5|USA|April 2009|3|\n|US Agricultural Trade Organization|USA|May 2009|3|\n|US Construction Company #2|USA|May 2009|4|\n|US Communications Technology Company|USA|May 2009|7|\n|US Defense Contractor #8|USA|May 2009|4|\n|US Defense Contractor #9|USA|May 2009|3|\n|US Defense Contractor #10|USA|June 2009|11|\n|US News Organization, Headquarters|USA|August 2009|8|\n|US News Organization, Hong Kong Bureau|Hong Kong|August 2009|21|\n|US Insurance Association|USA|August 2009|3|\n|World Anti-Doping Agency|Canada|August 2009|14|\n|German Accounting Firm|Germany|September 2009|10|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Victim|Country Intrusion|Start Date|Intrusion Duration (Months)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|US Solar Power Energy Company|USA|September 2009|4|\n|Canadian Government Agency #1|Canada|October 2009|6|\n|US Government Organization #5|USA|November 2009|2|\n|US Defense Contractor #11|USA|December 2009|2|\n|US Defense Contractor #12|USA|December 2009|1|\n|Canadian Government Agency #2|Canada|January 2010|1|\n|US Think Tank|USA|April 2010|13|\n|Indian Government Agency|India|September 2010|2|\n\n\nBelow are the complete timelines for each year of intrusion activity.
