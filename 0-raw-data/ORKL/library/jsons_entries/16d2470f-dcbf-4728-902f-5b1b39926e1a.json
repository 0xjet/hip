According to public reporting,\n[Scattered Spider threat actors have [2],[3],[4]:](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/scattered-spider-the-modus-operandi.html)\n\n  - Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain\n[credentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598],[T1656].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1598/)\n\n  - Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff to direct employees to run commercial remote\n[access tools enabling initial access [T1204],[T1219],[T1566].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1204/)\n\n  - Posed as IT staff to convince employees to share their one-time password (OTP), an MFA\nauthentication code.\n\n  - Sent repeated MFA notification prompts leading to employees pressing the “Accept” button\n[(also known as MFA fatigue) [T1621].[5]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1621/)\n\n  - Convinced cellular carriers to transfer control of a targeted user’s phone number to a SIM card\nthey controlled, gaining control over the phone and access to MFA prompts.\n\n  - Monetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by\n[ransomware and data theft [T1657].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1657/)\n\nAfter gaining access to networks, FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors using publicly\navailable, legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Table 1 details a list of legitimate tools Scattered\nSpider, repurposed and used for their criminal activity. Note: The use of these legitimate tools alone\nis not indicative of criminal activity. Users should review the Scattered Spider indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) and TTPs discussed in this CSA to determine whether they have been\ncompromised.\n\n_Table 1: Legitimate Tools Used by Scattered Spider_\n\n|Tool|Intended Use|\n|---|---|\n|Fleetdeck.io|Enables remote monitoring and management of systems.|\n|Level.io|Enables remote monitoring and management of systems.|\n|Mimikatz [S0002]|Extracts credentials from a system.|\n|Ngrok [S0508]|Enables remote access to a local web server by tunneling over the internet.|\n|Pulseway|Enables remote monitoring and management of systems.|\n|Screenconnect|Enables remote connections to network devices for management.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tool|Intended Use|\n|---|---|\n|Splashtop|Enables remote connections to network devices for management.|\n|Tactical.RMM|Enables remote monitoring and management of systems.|\n|Tailscale|Provides virtual private networks (VPNs) to secure network communications.|\n|Teamviewer|Enables remote connections to network devices for management.|\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\nIn addition to using legitimate tools, Scattered Spider also uses malware as part of its TTPs. See\nTable 2 for some of the malware used by Scattered Spider.\n\n_Table 2: Malware Used by Scattered Spider_\n\n**Malware** **Use**\n\nAveMaria (also known as\nEnables remote access to a victim’s systems.\n[WarZone [S0670])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0670/)\n\n[Steals information including login credentials [TA0006],](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0006/)\nRaccoon Stealer\n[browser history [T1217], cookies [T1539], and other data.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1217/)\n\nSteals information including login credentials, browser history,\nVIDAR Stealer\ncookies, and other data.\n\nScattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off\nthe land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently\nmodifying their TTPs.\n\n[Observably, Scattered Spider threat actors have exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/)\nthreatened to release it without deploying ransomware; this includes exfiltration to multiple sites\n[including U.S.-based data centers and MEGA[.]NZ [T1567.002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1567/002/)\n\n### Recent Scattered Spider TTPs\n\n#### New TTP - File Encryption\n\nMore recently, FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after\n[exfiltration [T1486]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/)\ncommunicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications.\n\n|Malware|Use|\n|---|---|\n|AveMaria (also known as WarZone [S0670])|Enables remote access to a victim’s systems.|\n|Raccoon Stealer|Steals information including login credentials [TA0006], browser history [T1217], cookies [T1539], and other data.|\n|VIDAR Stealer|Steals information including login credentials, browser history, cookies, and other data.|\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\n#### Reconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access\n\n[Scattered Spider intrusions often begin with broad phishing [T1566] and smishing [T1660] attempts](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/)\nagainst a target using victim-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3\n\n[[T1583.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/001/)\n\n_Table 3: Domains Used by Scattered Spider Threat Actors_\n\n\n**Domains**\n\n\nvictimname-sso[.]com\n\nvictimname-servicedesk[.]com\n\nvictimname-okta[.]com\n\nIn most instances, Scattered Spider threat actors conduct SIM swapping attacks against users that\nrespond to the phishing/smishing attempt. The threat actors then work to identify the personally\nidentifiable information (PII) of the most valuable users that succumbed to the phishing/smishing,\nobtaining answers for those users’ security questions. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII\n\n[[T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques [T1656]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/)\nto convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens\n\n[[T1078.002],[T1199],[T1566.004] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign-on](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/002/)\n(SSO) environments.\n\n#### Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation\n\n[Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006],[T1606] after](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1556/006/)\n[compromising a user’s account to establish persistence [TA0003]. Further, the threat actors add a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0003/)\nfederated identity provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking\n\n[[T1484.002]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1484/002/)\naccount attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider\nand then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the\n[threat actors to perform privileged escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0004/)\n[are changed [T1078]. Additionally, they leverage common endpoint detection and response (EDR)](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/)\ntools installed on the victim networks to take advantage of the tools’ remote-shell capabilities and\nexecuting of commands which elevates their access. They also deploy remote monitoring and\n[management (RMM) tools [T1219] to then maintain persistence.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/)\n\n#### Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration\n\nOnce persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform\n[discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1213/002/)\n\n[[T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/001/)\n[into Virtual Private Networks (VPN) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the victim’s Active](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0007/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\n[Directory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim’s code repositories [T1213.003], code-](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1213/003/)\n[signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083],[TA0010]. Threat actors activate Amazon](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/004/)\n[Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral movement](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1538/)\n\n[[TA0007],[TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0007/)\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data\nexfiltration, Scattered Spider threat actors use actor-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools\n\n[[T1648] to bring data from multiple data sources into a centralized database [T1074],[T1530].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1648/)\nAccording to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat\nactors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks—thereby encrypting\n[VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/)\n\nTo determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider\nthreat actors often search the victim’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for\n[emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor’s intrusion and any security response. The](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1114/)\nthreat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to\nidentify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in\nresponse to victim defenses. This is sometimes achieved by creating new identities in the\n[environment [T1136] and is often upheld with fake social media profiles [T1585.001] to backstop](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1136/)\nnewly created identities.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES\n\nSee Tables 4 through 17 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.\n\n_Table 4: Reconnaissance_\n\n**Technique Title** **ID** **Use**\n\nGather Victim Identity Scattered Spider threat actors gather usernames,\n[T1589](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/)\nInformation passwords, and PII for targeted organizations.\n\nScattered Spider threat actors use phishing to\n\nPhishing for Information [T1598](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1598/) obtain login credentials, gaining access to a\n\nvictim’s network.\n\n_Table 5: Resource Development_\n\n|Technique Title|ID|Use|\n|---|---|---|\n|Gather Victim Identity Information|T1589|Scattered Spider threat actors gather usernames, passwords, and PII for targeted organizations.|\n|Phishing for Information|T1598|Scattered Spider threat actors use phishing to obtain login credentials, gaining access to a victim’s network.|\n\n|Technique Title|ID|Use|\n|---|---|---|\n|Acquire Infrastructure: Domains|T1583.001|Scattered Spider threat actors create domains for use in phishing and smishing attempts against targeted organizations.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Technique Title|ID|Use|\n|---|---|---|\n|Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts|T1585.001|Scattered Spider threat actors create fake social media profiles to backstop newly created user accounts in a targeted organization.|\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\n_Table 6: Initial Access_\n\nvictim.\n\n_Table 7: Execution_\n\n|Technique Title|ID|Use|\n|---|---|---|\n|Phishing|T1566|Scattered Spider threat actors use broad phishing attempts against a target to obtain information used to gain initial access.

A properly\nconfigured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution.\nAllowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of\nmalicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression,\nencryption, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:**\n`o` **Auditing remote access tools on your network to identify currently used and/or**\nauthorized software.\n`o` **Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software to detect abnormal use of**\n[programs running as a portable executable [CPG 2.T].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n`o` **Using security software to detect instances of remote access software being loaded only**\nin memory.\n`o` **Requiring authorized remote access solutions to be used only from within your network**\nover approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual\ndesktop interfaces (VDIs).\n`o` **Blocking both inbound and outbound connections on common remote access**\nsoftware ports and protocols at the network perimeter.\n`o` **Applying recommendations in the** [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/Guide%20to%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20Software_clean%20Final_508c.pdf)\n\n- **Implementing FIDO/WebAuthn authentication or Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based**\n**MFA. These MFA implementations are resistant to phishing and not suspectable to push**\nbombing or SIM swap attacks, which are techniques known to be used by Scattered Spider\nactors. See CISA’s fact sheet [Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA for more information.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\n\n  - **Strictly limit the use of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other remote desktop**\n**[services. If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example [CPG 2.W]:](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)**\n```\n   o Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n   o Close unused RDP ports.\n   o Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\n```\n`o` [Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA).](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n```\n   o Log RDP login attempts.\n\n```\nIn addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following\nmitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques,\nand to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n\n  - **Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary**\ndata and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,\nstorage device, the cloud).\n\n  - **Maintain offline backups of data and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or**\nweekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption\n[to its business practices [CPG 2.R].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n\n  - **Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and**\n[domain admin accounts) to comply with NIST's standards for developing and managing](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)\npassword policies.\n```\n   o Use longer passwords consisting of at least eight characters and no more than 64\n\n```\n[characters in length [CPG 2.B].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n```\n   o Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\n   o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.\n   o Avoid reusing passwords [CPG 2.C].\n   o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 2.G].\n   o Disable password “hints.”\n   o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\n\n```\n**Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and**\nfrequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users\ndeveloping password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n```\n   o Require administrator credentials to install software.\n\n```\n  - **Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent**\npossible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access\n[critical systems [CPG 2.H].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n\n  - **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of**\nthe most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to\n[cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n[systems [CPG 1.E].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n\n  - **Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help**\nprevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—\n[various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\n\n  - **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the**\n**indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the**\nransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including\nlateral movement, on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly\nuseful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon\n[network connections for each host [CPG 3.A].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n\n  - **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all**\nhosts.\n\n  - **Disable unused** **[ports and protocols [CPG 2.V].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)**\n\n  - **[Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization [CPG](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)**\n2.M].\n\n  - **Disable hyperlinks in received emails.**\n\n  - **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be**\n[altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [CPG 2.K, 2.L,](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n2.R].\n\n## VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS\n\nIn addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your\norganization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for\nEnterprise framework in this advisory. FBI and CISA recommend testing your existing security\ncontrols inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this\nadvisory.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 4-17).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance\ndata.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the\ndata generated by this process.\n\nFBI and CISA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production\nenvironment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this\nadvisory.\n\n## REPORTING\n\nFBI and CISA are seeking any information that can be shared, to include a sample ransom note,\ncommunications with Scattered Spider group actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or\na benign sample of an encrypted file. FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment\ndoes not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden\nadversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI  CISA\n\n\ndistribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your\norganization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware\n[incidents to a local FBI Field Office, report the incident to FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\nat [IC3.gov, or CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/) or 888-282-0870).\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[[1] MITRE ATT&CK – Scattered Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/groups/G1015/)\n\n[[2] Trellix - Scattered Spider: The](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/scattered-spider-the-modus-operandi.html) Modus Operandi\n\n[[3] Crowdstrike - Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies/)\n[Telco and BPO Companies](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies/)\n\n[[4] Crowdstrike - SCATTERED SPIDER Exploits Windows Security Deficiencies with Bring-Your-](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid-detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/)\n[Own-Vulnerable-Driver Tactic in Attempt to Bypass Endpoint Security](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid-detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/)\n\n[[5] Malwarebytes - Ransomware group steps up, issues statement over MGM Resorts compromise](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/ransomware-group-steps-up-issues-statement-over-mgm-resorts-compromise)\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
