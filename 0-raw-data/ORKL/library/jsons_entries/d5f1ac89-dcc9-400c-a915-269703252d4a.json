He used the victims’ devices to\nbuild and operate an Internet of Things (IoT)-based botnet dubbed the “Russian2015” using\nthe domain Russian2015.ru. He modified the operation of each compromised internet router\nso it could be used as a proxy to transmit third-party internet traffic without the owners’\nknowledge or consent. He then sold access to global cybercriminals who channeled their\ntraffic through the victims’ home routers, using the victims’ devices to engage in spam\ncampaigns and other criminal activity. The Alaska victims experienced significant data\noverages even when there were no home computers connected to the victims’ home\nnetworks. The data overages resulted in hundreds to thousands of dollars per victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nToday s cybercriminals rely on increasingly sophisticated techniques to hijack computers\nand personal electronic devices for their criminal activities. Botnets like the ‘Russian2015’\nare a dangerous threat to all Americans and today’s guilty plea demonstrates we can and will\nhold accountable foreign cybercriminals and their enablers,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Bryan\nWilson, District of Alaska. “Our success in disrupting this botnet was the result of a strong\npartnership between private industry experts and law enforcement.”\n\nTsurkan is scheduled to be sentenced on November 10, 2021 and faces a maximum penalty\nof 10 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after\nconsidering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI’s Anchorage Field Office is investigating the case with support from GCI and Palo\nAlto Networks Unit 42. The FBI’s New Haven, Connecticut, Field Office provided assistance\nduring the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Adam Alexander and Trial Attorney Alden Pelker of the Criminal\nDivision’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[USAO - Alaska](http://www.justice.gov/usao-ak)\nPress Release Number:\n\n21-51\n\n\n-----",
