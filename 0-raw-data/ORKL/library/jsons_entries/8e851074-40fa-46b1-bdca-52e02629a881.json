The activity was identified through a combination of Network\nIntelligence and analysis derived from open-source reporting. The report will be\nof most interest to network defenders and individuals engaged in strategic and\noperational intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian state in\ncyberspace.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nBeginning in July 2022, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed the recurring\nuse of similar infrastructure by the threat activity group TAG-53. This newly\ndiscovered infrastructure likely overlaps with other infrastructure tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) previously attributed to Callisto Group,\nCOLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM, who have been linked to activity aligning\nwith Russian state interests.\n\nInsikt Group has observed the recurring use of common traits by TAG-53 when\ncurating its infrastructure, including the use of domain names employing a\nspecific pattern construct along with Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates, the use of a\nspecific cluster of hosting providers, and the use of a small cluster of\nautonomous systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nTAG-53 infrastructure was found to contain a spoofed Microsoft login page\nmasquerading as a legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the\nUnited States, suggesting that some TAG-53 infrastructure has likely already\nbeen operationalized. Based on historical public reporting on overlapping TAG53 campaigns, it is likely that this credential harvesting activity is enabled in\npart through phishing.\n\n**Key Judgments**\n\nInsikt Group has identified new infrastructure used by TAG-53, a group\nlikely linked to suspected Russian threat activity groups Callisto Group,\nCOLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM.\nThe identified TAG-53 infrastructure features common traits including the\nuse of specific domain registrars, the use of Let’s Encrypt TLS\ncertificates, and a small cluster of autonomous systems. Most of TAG53’s domains use a specific stylistic structure.\nTAG-53 has used domains masquerading as organizations across\nmultiple industry verticals, with a particular focus on government,\nintelligence, and military industries.\n\n**Background**\n\nTAG-53 is consistent when setting up its infrastructure, which bears significant\nhallmarks and crossover with infrastructure attributed to Callisto Group,\nCOLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM. The group continues to use particular\nstylistic structures when registering malicious domains alongside the use of\nspecific domain registrars with IP addresses that reside in a small cluster of\nautonomous systems.\n\n[On August 15, 2022, a Microsoft report published in collaboration with Google’s](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations)\nThreat Analysis Group (TAG) and Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team detailed\nSEABORGIUM’s phishing operations. In this research, Microsoft assesses that\nSEABORGIUM originates from Russia and has “objectives and victimology that\nalign closely with Russian state interests”. Microsoft denotes that\nSEABORGIUM shares overlaps with Callisto Group, TA446, and COLDRIVER\nand indicates that the threat actor has carried out persistent phishing and\ncredential theft campaigns that have led to intrusions and data theft.\nSEABORGIUM primarily focuses its targeting on NATO countries, including a\nspecific emphasis on the United States and the United Kingdom. The group\nalso targeted Ukraine in the run-up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country\nin February 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle s TAG [reported in March and](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe) [updated in May 2022 that COLDRIVER](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe)\nhas conducted credential phishing campaigns using Gmail accounts targeting\nnongovernmental organizations and think tanks, journalists, and government\nand defense officials. TAG also suggests that COLDRIVER’s TTPs have\nevolved over time, moving towards incorporating PDF or DOC file links that are\nhosted on Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive within its phishing emails.\n\n**Threat and Technical Analysis**\n\n[Insikt Group used intelligence provided in open-source reporting (1,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations) [2,](https://blog.sekoia.io/calisto-continues-its-credential-harvesting-campaign) [3,](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe) [4) to](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe)\nprofile TAG-53 infrastructure that likely overlaps with Callisto Group,\nCOLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM infrastructure. TAG-53 infrastructure was\nuncovered by analyzing specific combinations of domain registrars,\nautonomous systems, domain name structures, and related TLS certificates.\nBased on this information, it is highly likely that this threat group is continuing\nits phishing and credential-harvesting operations. While monitoring TAG-53\ninfrastructure, Insikt Group observed a spoofed Microsoft login page\nmasquerading as a legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the\nUS, suggesting that some TAG-53 infrastructure has likely already been\noperationalized.\n\nRegistrars\n\nUsing both current and passive Domain Name System (DNS) records, Insikt\nGroup resolved IP addresses for 38 registered domains used by TAG-53 since\nJanuary 2022. The identified TAG-53 domains, listed in Appendix A, have\nhighlighted a trend towards the use of NameCheap, Porkbun, REG.RU, and\nregway for domain registration that has persisted since mid-2022, a breakdown\nof which can be seen in Figure 1. The reason for the preference of these\nregistrars is unknown, but it is a useful metric when profiling candidate TAG-53\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Breakdown of domain registrars used by TAG-53 since January**\n**2022 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nAlongside the use of specific domain registrars is the use of particular\nautonomous systems, with all domains collected under TAG-53 found to exist in\n10 autonomous systems with a significant concentration found located in 2\nAutonomous System Numbers (ASNs) linked to MIRhosting (AS52000) and\nHostwinds (AS54290) shown in Table 1 below.\n\nASN AS Name TAG-53 Domain Count\n\nAS52000 MIRhosting 11\n\nAS54290 HOSTWINDS 10\n\nAS44094 WEBHOST1-AS 4\n\nAS62240 Clouvider 4\n\nAS62005 BV-EU-AS 3\n\nAS44477 STARK-INDUSTRIES 2\n\nAS16276 OVH 1\n\nAS20278 NEXEON 1\n\nAS206446 CLOUDLEASE 1\n\n\n-----\n\nAS43624 STARK-INDUSTRIES-SOLUTIONSAS\n\n\n1\n\n\n**Table 1: ASN detail breakdown for TAG-53 linked domains (Source:**\n**Recorded Future)**\n\nDomain Name Structure\n\nMost of the domains discovered via TAG-53 tracking use similarly structured\ndomain names, primarily made up of 2 terms separated by a hyphen, such as\n“cloud-safety[.]online”. Of the 38 domains identified, 33 used the stylistic form\n“-.(com|online|ru)”. Of the remaining 5 domains, 4 were found to be similar, but\nconsisted of 3 terms and 2 hyphens — “share-drive-ua[.]com”, “networkstorage-ltd[.]com”, “land-of-service[.]com”, and “nonviolent-conflictservice[.]com” — and 1 contained no hyphens — “proxycrioisolation[.]com”.\nHowever, additional factors enabled Insikt Group to link these domains to the\nrest of TAG-53’s infrastructure.\n\nA breakdown of the terms found in TAG-53 domains, shown in Figure 2,\nhighlights the repeated use of specific words within the domains, most of which\nare common, generic computing terms.\n\n**Figure 2: Breakdown of terms used in TAG-53 linked domains (Source:**\n**Recorded Future)**\n\nX.509 TLS Certificates\n\n\n-----\n\nAll identified TAG-53 domains were found to host corresponding X.509 TLS\ncertificates provided by Let’s Encrypt, an example of which is shown in Figure\n3. The prevalent use of Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates allows for further\ncorrelations between TAG-53 domains and infrastructure, strengthening the\nclustering of this activity.\n\n**Figure 3: Partial X.509 TLS certificate for drive-globalordnance[.]com**\n**(Source:** **[crt.sh)](https://crt.sh/?id=7672587577)**\n\nTargeting and Victimology\n\nOf the 38 discovered domains, 9 contained references to potential target\norganizations or organizations that TAG-53 may be attempting to masquerade\nas, shown in Table 2. The reason behind the use of these themed domains is\nnot fully understood beyond the likely attempt to emulate real entities in order\nto appear more legitimate to potential targets and victims.\n\n\nTAG-53 Domain Suspected\nTarget/Masquerade\n\n\nIndustry Vertical\n\n\numopl-drive[.]com UMO Poland Aerospace and\nDefense:\nHardware/Weaponry\n\n\ndriveglobalordnance[.]com\n\n\nGlobal Ordnance Aerospace and\nDefense:\nHardware/Weaponry\n\n\nsangrail-share[.]com Sangrail LTD Aerospace and\nDefense: Military &\nCivilian Intelligence\n\ndtgruelle-us[.]com DTGruelle Logistics\n\n\n-----\n\ndtgruelle-drive[.]com\n\ncija-docs[.]com The Commission for\nInternational Justice and\nAccountability (CIJA)\n\n\nNGO: Armed Conflict\nCrime Investigations\n\n\nblueskynetworkshared[.]com\n\n\nBlue Sky Network Telecommunications:\nSatelite\n\n\ndns-mvd[.]ru The Ministry of Internal\nAffairs of the Russian\nFederation (MVD)\n\nmvd-redir[.]ru\n\n\nGovernment: Russian\nMinistry of Internal\nAffairs\n\n\n**Table 2: Suspected targets/masquerades of TAG-53 linked domains**\n**(Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nAnalysis of the 9 domains reveals that 7 share a focus around industry verticals\nthat would likely be of interest to Russia-nexus threat groups, especially in light\nof the war in Ukraine. The 2 outlier domains are probably intended to\nmasquerade as the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.\n(MVD)\n\nCredential Harvesting\n\nThe TAG-53 domain “drive-globalordnance[.]com” includes a spoofed sign-in\npage for the legitimate company Global Ordnance, a military weapons and\nhardware supplier in the US. The spoofed sign-in page, shown in Figure 4,\nuses Global Ordnance branding and is suspected to be used for follow-on\ncredential harvesting after a target has been phished. It is unclear whether\nGlobal Ordnance is the intended target of this attempted credential harvesting\noperation or whether TAG-53 is using a Global Ordnance-styled domain and\nspoofed sign-in page to masquerade as a legitimate entity to target victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: TAG-53 Global Ordnance spoofed sign-in page (Source:**\n**URLScan)**\n\n**Mitigations**\n\nUsers should conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate activity\nassociated with TAG-53:\n\nConfigure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention\nsystems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on\n— and upon review, consider blocking connection attempts to and from\n— the external IP addresses and domains listed in the appendix.\nRecorded Future proactively detects malicious server configurations and\nprovides means to block them in the Command and Control Security\nControl Feed. The Command and Control Feed includes tools used by\nTAG-53 and other Russian state-sponsored threat activity groups.\nRecorded Future clients should alert on and block these C2 servers to\nallow for detection and remediation of active intrusions.\n[Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI),](https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/threat-intelligence) [Third-Party Intelligence, and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/third-party-intelligence)\n[SecOps Intelligence modules users can monitor real-time output from](https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/secops-intelligence)\nNetwork Intelligence analytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion\nactivity involving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n\n-----\n\nMonitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains spoofing your\n[organization, through the Recorded Future Brand Intelligence (BI)](https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/brand-intelligence)\nmodule.
