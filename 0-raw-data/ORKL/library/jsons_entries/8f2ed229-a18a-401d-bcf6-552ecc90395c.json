We hang on to these occasional victories because history\ntells us that most ransomware moneymaking collectives don’t go away so much as reinvent\nthemselves under a new name, with new rules, targets and weaponry. Indeed, some of the\nmost destructive and costly ransomware groups are now in their third incarnation.\n\nA rough timeline of major ransomware operations and their reputed links over time.\n\nReinvention is a basic survival skill in the cybercrime business. Among the oldest tricks in the\nbook is to fake one’s demise or retirement and invent a new identity. A key goal of such\nsubterfuge is to throw investigators off the scent or to temporarily direct their attention\nelsewhere.\n\nCybercriminal syndicates also perform similar disappearing acts whenever it suits them.\nThese organizational reboots are an opportunity for ransomware program leaders to set new\nground rules for their members — such as which types of victims aren’t allowed (e.g.,\nhospitals, governments, critical infrastructure), or how much of a ransom payment an affiliate\nshould expect for bringing the group access to a new victim network.\n\n\n-----\n\nI put together the above graphic to illustrate some of the more notable ransom gang\nreinventions over the past five years. What it doesn’t show is what we already know about\nthe cybercriminals behind many of these seemingly disparate ransomware groups, some of\nwhom were pioneers in the ransomware space almost a decade ago. We’ll explore that more\nin the latter half of this story.\n\nOne of the more intriguing and recent revamps involves DarkSide, the group that extracted a\n$5 million ransom from Colonial Pipeline earlier this year, only to watch much of it get\nclawed back in an operation by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nAfter acknowledging someone had also seized their Internet servers, DarkSide announced it\nwas folding. But a little more than a month later, a new ransomware affiliate program called\n**[BlackMatter emerged, and experts quickly determined BlackMatter was using the same](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/)**\nunique encryption methods that DarkSide had used in their attacks.\n\nDarkSide’s demise roughly coincided with that of REvil, a long-running ransomware group\nthat claims to have extorted more than $100 million from victims. REvil’s last big victim was\n**Kaseya, a Miami-based company whose products help system administrators manage large**\nnetworks remotely. That attack let REvil deploy ransomware to as many as 1,500\norganizations that used Kaseya.\n\nREvil demanded a whopping $70 million to release a universal decryptor for all victims of the\nKaseya attack. Just days later, President Biden [reportedly told Russian President Vladimir](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/09/ransomware-biden-presses-putin-to-disrupt-cybercriminals-in-russia.html)\n**Putin that he expects Russia to act when the United States shares information on specific**\nRussians involved in ransomware activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nA REvil ransom note.\n\nWhether that conversation prompted actions is unclear. But REvil’s victim shaming blog\nwould disappear from the dark web just four days later.\n\n**[Mark Arena, CEO of cyber threat intelligence firm Intel 471, said it remains unclear whether](https://www.intel471.com/)**\nBlackMatter is the REvil crew operating under a new banner, or if it is simply the\nreincarnation of DarkSide.\n\nBut one thing is clear, Arena said: “Likely we will see them again unless they’ve been\narrested.”\n\n[Likely, indeed. REvil is widely considered a reboot of GandCrab, a prolific ransomware gang](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=gandcrab)\nthat boasted of extorting more than $2 billion over 12 months before abruptly closing up shop\nin June 2019. “We are living proof that you can do evil and get off scot-free,” Gandcrab\nbragged.\n\n[And wouldn’t you know it: Researchers have found GandCrab shared key behaviors with](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/gandcrab-ransomware-mindset/)\n**Cerber, an early ransomware-as-a-service operation that stopped claiming new victims at**\nroughly the same time that GandCrab came on the scene.\n\n## GOOD GRIEF\n\nThe past few months have been a busy time for ransomware groups looking to rebrand.\n_BleepingComputer recently_ [reported that the new “Grief” ransomware startup was just the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/)\nlatest paintjob of DoppelPaymer a ransomware strain that shared most of its code with an\n\n\n-----\n\nearlier iteration from 2016 called BitPaymer.\n\nAll three of these ransom operations stem from a prolific cybercrime group known variously\nas [TA505, “Indrik Spider” and (perhaps most memorably) Evil Corp. According to security](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/)\nfirm CrowdStrike, Indrik Spider was formed in 2014 by former affiliates of the GameOver\n[Zeus criminal network who internally referred to themselves as “The Business Club.”](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/inside-the-100m-business-club-crime-gang/)\n\nThe Business Club was a notorious Eastern European organized cybercrime gang accused\nof stealing more than $100 million from banks and businesses worldwide. In 2015, the FBI\noffered a standing $3 million bounty for information leading to the capture of the Business\nClub’s leader — Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. By the time the FBI put a price on his\nhead, Bogachev’s Zeus trojan and later variants had been infecting computers for nearly a\ndecade.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe alleged ZeuS Trojan author, Evgeniy Mikhaylovich Bogachev. Source: FBI\n\nBogachev was way ahead of his colleagues in pursuing ransomware. His Gameover Zeus\nBotnet was a peer-to-peer crime machine that infected between 500,000 and a million\n**Microsoft Windows computers. Throughout 2013 and 2014, PCs infected with Gameover**\n[were seeded with Cryptolocker, an early, much-copied ransomware strain allegedly authored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker)\nby Bogachev himself.\n\nCrowdStrike notes that shortly after the group’s inception, Indrik Spider developed their own\n[custom malware known as Dridex, which has emerged as a major vector for deploying](https://any.run/malware-trends/dridex)\nmalware that lays the groundwork for ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarly versions of Dridex were primitive, but over the years the malware became increasingly\nprofessional and sophisticated,” CrowdStrike researchers wrote. “In fact, Dridex operations\nwere significant throughout 2015 and 2016, making it one of the most prevalent eCrime\nmalware families.”\n\nThat [CrowdStrike report was from July 2019. In April 2021, security experts at Check Point](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/doppelpaymer-ransomware-and-dridex-2/)\n**[Software found Dridex was still the most prevalent malware (for the second month running).](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/05/13/april-2021s-most-wanted-malware-dridex-remains-in-top-position-amidst-global-surge-in-ransomware-attacks/)**\nMainly distributed via well-crafted phishing emails — such as a recent campaign that\nspoofed **QuickBooks — Dridex often serves as the attacker’s initial foothold in company-**\nwide ransomware attacks, CheckPoint said.\n\n## REBRANDING TO AVOID SANCTIONS\n\n[Another ransomware family tied to Evil Corp. and the Dridex gang is WastedLocker, which](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/)\nis the latest name of a ransomware strain that has rebranded several times since 2019. That\nwas when the Justice Department put a $5 million bounty on the head of Evil Corp., and the\nTreasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) said it was prepared to\n[impose hefty fines on anyone who paid a ransom to the cybercrime group.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/ransomware-victims-that-pay-up-could-incur-steep-fines-from-uncle-sam/)\n\nAlleged Evil Corp leader Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets. Image: FBI\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early June 2021, researchers discovered the Dridex gang was once again trying to morph\n[in an effort to evade U.S. sanctions. The drama began when the Babuk ransomware group](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/babuk-ransomware/)\nannounced in May that they were starting a new platform for data leak extortion, which was\nintended to appeal to ransomware groups that didn’t already have a blog where they can\npublicly shame victims into paying by gradually releasing stolen data.\n\nOn June 1, Babuk changed the name of its leaks site to payload[dot]bin, and began leaking\nvictim data. Since then, multiple security experts have spotted what they believe is another\nversion of WastedLocker dressed up as payload.bin-branded ransomware.\n\n“Looks like EvilCorp is trying to pass off as Babuk this time,” [wrote Fabian Wosar, chief](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1401110845820747797)\ntechnology officer at security firm Emsisoft. “As Babuk releases their PayloadBin leak portal,\nEvilCorp rebrands WastedLocker once again as PayloadBin in an attempt to trick victims into\nviolating OFAC regulations.”\n\nExperts are quick to point out that many cybercriminals involved in ransomware activity are\naffiliates of more than one distinct ransomware-as-a-service operation. In addition, it is\ncommon for a large number of affiliates to migrate to competing ransomware groups when\ntheir existing sponsor suddenly gets shut down.\n\nAll of the above would seem to suggest that the success of any strategy for countering the\nransomware epidemic hinges heavily on the ability to disrupt or apprehend a relatively small\nnumber of cybercriminals who appear to wear many disguises.\n\nPerhaps that’s why the Biden Administration said last month it was offering a $10 million\nreward for information that leads to the arrest of the gangs behind the extortion schemes,\nand for new approaches that make it easier to trace and block cryptocurrency payments.\n\n\n-----",
