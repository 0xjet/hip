Analysts tested the ability to statically extract configuration data,\nbypassing dynamic anti-analysis features using data processed by CT, 1 discovering\napproximately 1,300 additional samples. The RoboSki-packed malware samples discovered\nfeature new capabilities, such as the ability to load resources and convert pixelated data to\nRGB order, resulting in the RoboSki component, and decoding and decrypting a ReZer0\nloader. The ReZer0 loader can embed malware or fetch it from remote servers and is known\nfor its ability to deliver encrypted payloads and anti-sandbox checks. Layering loaders is a\ntactic many malware distributors use to evade anti-virus detection and security scanners.\n\nCT partnered with IBM X-Force to uncover how attackers delivered the commercial\nRATs while analyzing the delivery of RoboSki samples, X-Force isolated a sample of 21\nphishing emails addressed to organizations worldwide in, and around mid-February 2021\nwith attachments including RoboSki packed malware. The emails, which feature global trade\nthemes, lead to the delivery of numerous malwares, such as Agent Tesla, FormBook, njRAT,\nNetWire, and the Remcos RAT.\n\nX-Force found infrastructure overlaps with the delivery of RoboSki’s distribution with recent,\nor ongoing activity spreading malware such as AsyncRAT, LokiBot, [NanoCore, and the](https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/TUFMV0FSRSU3Q05BTk9DT1JF)\n[Gamarue Botnet, in addition to Agent Tesla,](https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/2170b8b0-8082-4aa2-9605-3488e0b7bfdc) [FormBook,](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/DHL-Faked-in-Formbook-Info-Stealer-Campaign-57f24e89208f825ab7752a94e1370a7d) [njRAT,](https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/TUFMV0FSRSU3Q05KUkFU) [NanoCore, and](https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/TUFMV0FSRSU3Q05BTk9DT1JF) [Remcos RAT](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/sba-spoofed-in-covid-19-spam-to-deliver-remcos-rat/)\n[which have previously been reported on IBM’s premium threat intelligence platform TruSTAR](https://station.trustar.co/browse/reports)\n[and Security Intelligence.](https://securityintelligence.com/)\n\n[Prior references to the RoboSki malware have been made in mid-2020, linking it to activity](https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/vendetta-new-threat-actor-from-europe/)\nby a group known as “Vendetta”. X-Force and CT do not necessarily attribute the new\nRoboSki variant we analyzed, or its means of delivery, exclusively to Vendetta. We believe\nthat the activity we examined points to independent cybercriminals distributing malware\nglobally, and a part of the continuous effort to evolve tools and methods, better obfuscate\nactivity and evade detection\n\n\n-----\n\n[Automated Component and Configuration Extraction(ACCE)](https://ciphertechsolutions.com/acce)\n\n## Are Cybercriminals Riding the Tide of Global Recovery?\n\n2020 saw the global economy experience the worst peacetime economic decline since the\n[Great Depression, but in its economic growth forecast for 2021, the International Monetary](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/03/23/world-economic-outlook-april-2021)\nFund (IMF) predicts renewed global economic expansion of 6% in 2021 alone. Arguably\nunderpinning this recovery in global trade is a worldwide expansion in the eCommerce\necosystem, which grew by a staggering 30% within the last year. Doubtlessly attune to these\nchanges in the digital current, malicious cyber actors are baiting their hooks accordingly to\nimitate authentic requests for quotations, payment orders, and shipping updates, hoping to\nsnare those logistical linchpins, like manufacturers, shippers, and suppliers, in the global\nsupply chain.\n\nX-Force analysts studied a sample of 21 phishing emails containing malicious attachments\nthat deliver the RoboSki packer, and subsequently a variety of final payloads. Analyzed\nemails were sent approximately between the second and third week of February 2021 and\nwere categorized into three main themes: Purchase Order/RFQ/Inquiry, Shipping\nNotification, and Payment Notice/ Bank Transfers. The sample emails were sent to 15 unique\ncompanies located in 12 different countries across Europe, South America, the Middle East,\nand South Asia.\n\nIn all instances, the phishing emails were addressed to companies associated with the\nmanufacture or export of items supporting and/or supplying construction, transport,\nengineering, or energy services. Most samples were directed at entities in Europe, with the\nhighest concentration of targeted organizations based in Romania, Italy, and Germany.\n\nX-Force and CT analysts assess with high confidence that global trade and logistics themed\nphishing campaigns will continue to plague organizations into the year ahead, as the\nrecovery of global trade unfolds over time. Organizations, especially those engaged in\nimport and export, should exercise extra caution, and seek to cultivate a culture of cyber\nawareness among management and all employees.\n\n## New Orders and Requests for Quotations\n\nMost emails in our sample were sent to a Romania-based company characterized as a\nglobal supplier of electrotechnical power products, including power transformers and rotary\nelectric machines. Several of the emails were crafted to appear to originate from real\ncompany email domains, indicating the senders are trying to increase the likelihood that the\nphishing email appears legitimate. Apart from a single instance, the emails pose as an\ninquiry surrounding purchase orders and requests for quotations. All emails are written in\npoor English and include an attached purchase order or quotation contained in an archive file\n(Zip, CAB, or RAR), which when executed, drops the RoboSki packed malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Sample email sent to a Romania based company_\n\nAdditional phishing messages uncovered with the same theme were primarily composed in\nvarying qualities of English and directed at seven unique entities across Europe and South\nAmerica, targeting companies that manufacture automobile parts, machinery, and energy\ncomponents. While the quality of the text differs by sample, the uncovered emails contain\nsignature blocks attempting to impersonate well known global corporations.\n\n## Where’s My Package?\n\nWe found the email sender janattbs7[@]gmail[.]com sent not only one email to the\nRomanian-based company regarding a “quotation request”, but also an email for “shipping\ndocuments”. Due to additional emails sent to the same company with varying themes, XForce researched the spoofed sender company as well as the recipient company; however,\nno clear connection between the two was discerned.\n\nSome of the sample emails used package delivery lures that purported to come from DHL or\nFedEx. These were typically sent to companies within the construction industry that support\noil companies and government clients, as well as water technology and processing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Sample DHL Email_\n\n_“Dear Customer,_\n\n_Your package has arrived at the office. Our courier could not deliver it to your address due to_\n_a wrong address provided by our customer._\n\n_To receive your package, please go to any of our nearest office and show this receipt._\n\n**CLICK ON THE ATTACHED FILE TO DOWNLOAD AND PRINT THE RECEIPT.**\n\n_Greetings_\n\n_The DHL team”_\n\n## Fake Notices, Payments, and Invoices\n\nOther emails in the sample featured fake payment notices, invoices, or bank transfers and\nwere sent to organizations in Europe and the Middle East. Half of the samples were\ncomposed in the native language of the targeted recipients and contained signature blocks of\nauthentic banks or import/export companies. The remaining emails were composed in wellworded English, and featured signature blocks impersonating the Managing Director of a\nlegitimate global shipping and logistics/supply chain management company based in\nBangladesh.\n\nWhile the sender email addresses did not match the signature blocks featured in each of the\nsamples, in all cases the signature blocks themselves imitate authentic companies that may\nhave a legitimate interest in the products or services of the targeted corporation.\n\n[In two instances, emails used the encrypted email service Tutanota (ex.](https://tutanota.com/)\nimports[@]tutanota[.]com[.]de.). Affixed to each of these emails was an attached archive file\n(TAR, 7z, GZIP) posing as either Transfer Requests, SWIFT statements from an authentic\nbank, or numeric codes potentially pointing to account numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Sample payment email_\n\n## Observations from Our Analysis\n\nX-Force uncovered several unique characteristics which provide insight into the attack\ninfrastructure used in the various delivery of RoboSki packed malware to facilitate\noperations. The activity we examined involved at least 289 email addresses for exfiltration of\nwhich, about 150 do not appear legitimate nor have discoverable returns, while more than\nhalf appear to be valid accounts.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the valid email accounts showed server errors, and roughly 10 percent\nof accounts were associated with catch-all servers that accept emails sent to the domain,\nregardless of whether the mailbox exists or not. The remaining accounts returned as either\nbelonging to invalid domains with no mail exchange record, bad syntax, transient network\nfaults, or unknown status.\n\n**Infrastructure Overlaps with Distribution of Other Malware**\n\nWe isolated about 165 different C2 IP addresses and domains that were used in the\ndistribution of malicious payloads. Several IP addresses and domains have been reported in\nprevious malware campaigns or are associated with recent or ongoing activity delivering a\nvariety of other malware. Some malware variants include Eldorado, Telegram Bot, NanoBot,\nLokiBot, and the password stealers Fareit and Redline. The following represents a sample of\nthe recent, or ongoing, campaigns that share, or have shared infrastructure overlaps with the\nRoboSki packer:\n\n_AsyncRAT_\n\nSome malicious overlaps include domain 8123wsheurope.access[.]ly which resolved to the\nRoboSki packed AsyncRAT C2 IP address 79.134.225[.]44 in December 2020. Recently, this\ndomain was reported as being part of activity in which attackers used collaboration platforms\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as Slack, to evade detection and deliver several types of RATs and stealers. [AsyncRAT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-warns-watch-out-for-this-new-malware-that-steals-passwords-webcam-and-browser-data/)\n[has also been active in the past month in attacks on the aviation, travel, and cargo industry.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-warns-watch-out-for-this-new-malware-that-steals-passwords-webcam-and-browser-data/)\n\n_NanoCore RAT_\n\nIn the same netblock as the AsyncRAT IP address, a RoboSki-packed NanoCore C2 IP\naddress 79.134.225[.]71 resolved to adam9.ddns[.]net, which was a C2 domain reported in\n[late-2020 with relation to activities by the Blade Eagle (Blade Hawk) APT group. In that](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/Blade-hawk-The-activities-of-targeted-the-Middle-East-and-West-Asia-are-exposed/)\ncampaign, Blade Eagle targeted organizations in the Middle East and West Asia. We also\n[found that C2 domains uyeco[.]pw and zolta[.]icu were seen in a recent malspam campaign](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/new-campaign-uses-fake-icon-to-deliver-trojan-a-16179)\nin which malicious executable file formats were abused, and used, in a way that hid them\nfrom email scanners and anti-malware software, ultimately to deliver the NanoCore RAT. The\ninfection TTPs were similar to the ones used to deliver the RoboSki packed malware, via\nemails themed with purchase orders in archived files.\n\n_LokiBot_\n\nOther observed overlaps include RoboSki-packed LokiBot C2 domains:\n\n– alphastand[.]trade – alphashtand[.]top – alphastand[.]win – kbfvzoboss[.]bid\n\nThese were previously observed in a campaign using Microsoft Publisher files to deliver the\n[Pony malware. The domains were also reported as a separate phishing campaign in 2019](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/02/pony-pub-files.html)\nusing [“SWIFT monetary transfer” themed lures to deliver LokiBot, in addition to Neshta, and](https://redskyalliance.org/Finance/swift-themed-malware-trending-lokibot-domination)\nFuerboos. All four C2 domains were used again in October 2020, as part of a different\nLokibot [spam campaign. Of note, these C2 domains were present in 95 of the RoboSki](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/evasive-urls-in-spam-part-2/)\npacked LokiBot samples, accounting for 41 unique LokiBot payloads.\n\n_Gamarue Botnet_\n\nIn addition, the C2 domains azmtool[.]us, becharnise[.]ir, newcesarnex[.]com, and\n[klimsourcinq[.]com, were reported in February as being related to the Gamarue Botnet. In](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/threat-roundup-0212-0219.html)\nthese instances, each of the domains were present in varying RoboSki packed LokiBot\nsamples.\n\n**File Path Observations**\n\nSome file paths have noticeable misspellings such as %AppData%\\microsift.exe, which was\nobserved in a RoboSki packed AsyncRAT sample. We found that additional file paths, such\nas %Temp%\\windefendllinici.exe in RoboSki packed AsyncRAT samples, may be associated\nwith files compiled in February 2021, that matched YARA signatures for Nanocore, and\npassword stealers, several of which communicate with the RoboSki packed AsyncRAT C2\ndomain laboratoriogenfarp.linkpc[.]net.\n\nIt is possible the appearance of the same file path in a limited sample set may suggest that\nthe same malicious actor has been involved in several campaigns delivering various\nmalwares. File path %AppData%\\notes\\logs.dat, seen in a RoboSki packed Remcos sample,\n\n\n-----\n\nwas also observed within other files that matched YARA rules for Remcos RAT and Agent\nTesla. The presence of %AppData%\\seguridad\\logs.dat in a RoboSki packed Remcos\nsample may suggest that a Spanish-speaking company may have had their security logs\naccessed. In addition, this file path was found within a file possibly related to Razy malware.\n\n**License Re-Use**\n\nWhile analyzing some of the final payloads, some interesting and specific attributes\nregarding Remcos RAT were observed. Our analysts found that the Remcos configuration\ncontains a license code field (“license_code”), which is unique to each purchaser. In some\ncases where the RoboSki packer led to the delivery of Remcos, it was observed that two\nspecific license codes were re-used.\n\nThe license codes we observed within the configuration of multiple payloads for packaging\nwere:\n\n1. License code A830299B3222E31F1F2765E3AC4D37FD – observed four times and\n\nassociated with C2 addresses 184.140.53.148:1011, and 79.134.225.14:1011.\n2. License code 8896DBA4C4FC821D8BAAC764BC9822E3 appeared in eight instances,\n\nassociated with C2 addresses 91.241.19.107:1313, and 176.111.174.14:2804.\n\nIn addition, the configuration of Remcos RAT contains the field “server_password”, with both\nof these license codes using the password “Yes”- although it is possibly defined as the\ndefault password.\n\n## New RoboSki Version – The Technical Details\n\nAs identified by X-Force, the RoboSki packer file typically arrives within a malicious email\narchive attachment. CT further analyzed the packer and its embedded components to\nunderstand the execution flow leading to a commodity RAT payload and how that execution\nflow differed from previous RoboSki packers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Mapping of RoboSki Packer to Final Payload_\n\n**RoboSki.Packer**\n\nCT analysts found that the RoboSki packer contains numerous .NET Microsoft resources,\nincluding the two resources of interest, SzGeneric and EventWaitHandleRights (highlighted\nin figure 5), which are stored as PNG images.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Key Resources_\n\nThe resource SzGeneric contains the RoboSki component. The Roboski component is used\nto decrypt the contents of the resource EventWaitHandleRights, resulting in a ReZer0 loader.\nTo get to the ReZer0 loader, the RoboSki packer first loads the SzGeneric resource and\nconverts the pixel data to RGB order, as denoted in the image below, resulting in the\nRoboSki component.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Conversion to RGB Order_\n\nThis differs from previous RoboSki packer versions wherein the component was stored as\nstring data and decoded using string replacement and the Base32 algorithm or string\nreplacement, string reversal, and the Base64 algorithm.\n\nThe converted data is then executed and invoked in a series of module calls, depicted in the\nimage below, in which the component is executed from its O5.Ga namespace/class and\npassed parameters from the class named ChannelSinkStack.\n\n_Figure 7: Converted Data Executed and Invoked_\n\nThe parameters stored within ChannelSinkStack are the hex-encoded values for the\nresource named EventWaitHandleRights, and a base XOR key “xNksm”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: ChannelSinkStack Parameters_\n\n**RoboSki.Component**\n\nAs described above, during execution the RoboSki component is provided resource and\nXOR key parameters, and proceeds to decode and decrypt the ReZer0 loader from the\nRoboSki packer. The component loads the resource and arranges the pixels in BGRA order.\nThe component then parses the resource according to the structure below, and XOR\ndecrypts the data using the results of permutations against the base XOR key and a control\nkey.\n\n_Figure 9: Python Construct Library Structure_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Structure Parsing and XOR Decryption_\n\nThe resultant ReZer0 loader is then executed in memory and subsequently decrypts and\nexecutes an embedded payload, which in this case, is an instance of the Agent Tesla RAT.\n[The ReZer0 loader operates in the same manner as described by 360 Total Security and](https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/vendetta-new-threat-actor-from-europe/)\n[Fortinet. As mentioned in those blog posts, the ReZer0 loader exhibits anti-analysis features](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deconstructing-an-evasive-formbook-campaign-leveraging-covid-19-themes)\nsuch as detection of Virtual Machines or Sandboxes and can bypass Anti-Virus software.\nDue to these anti-analysis features, the results from dynamic analysis, including sandboxes,\nmay be incomplete or wildly inaccurate. By using Automated Component and Configuration\nExtraction (ACCE) to statically extract the configuration data, we bypass all dynamic antianalysis features that would otherwise prevent accurate and reliable analysis.\n\n## How Do We Build ACCE Support?\n\nACCE is built on top of CT’s proprietary libraries, as well as the Department of Defense\n[Cyber Crime Center’s (DC3) Malware Configuration Parser (MWCP) and](https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/DC3-MWCP) [kordesii](https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/kordesii)\nframeworks. This promotes an automation workflow where initial YARA signature detections\nprompt running targeted modules organized by capability, to extract layers of components\n(RoboSki packer-> ReZer0 loader -> Agent Tesla payload) and report configuration at each\n\n\n-----\n\nlayer. By adopting the ACCE workflow, Reverse Engineers can develop modules based upon\nanalysis of a few samples, and then leverage that module to continue to extract results from\nthousands of other related malware variants.\n\nThe primary difference between the newly analyzed RoboSki packer and previous RoboSki\npackers is the way the ReZer0 loader is encrypted. Previously written code for parsing the\nPNG pixels of the image resource was used in conjunction with new code for obtaining and\nusing the resource name and initial XOR key using construct, regex patterns, and an internal\nlibrary.\n\n_Figure 11: Construct_\n\n_Figure 12: Construct PAYLOAD_SPEC_\n\nThe referenced resource is acquired, PNG pixels are parsed, and the resulting data is\nparsed using the construct PAYLOAD_SPEC.\n\n\n-----\n\nSubsequently, the ReZer0 loader is decrypted and dispatched for further processing. The\nconfiguration output for the RoboSki packer (MD5: 9b792353406c1c8bf440fa5417aee5b2)\nwhich contained the LokiBot sample with C2 domains previously observed in other\ncampaigns:\n\n_Figure 13: Configuration Output_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Hunting Using ACCE Output\n\nAfter adding a parser module to automatically extract the RoboSki component and ReZer0\nloader from the new RoboSki packer variant, we used VirusTotal to find additional samples\nusing the new RoboSki packer variant. As a result, 55 samples were selected to test against\nthe new parser module.\n\nTwo variations in the initial RoboSki packer were observed:\n\n1. In addition to being hex-encoded, the .NET Microsoft resource name and base XOR\n\nkey are Base64 encoded.\n2. A .NET obfuscator is leveraged to encrypt all strings in the RoboSki packer, inhibiting\n\nthe ability to easily extract the resource name and base XOR key.\n\nAll 55 RoboSki packer samples contained the same RoboSki decryption component.\n\nAfter updating the parser module(s) to support the variations observed in the RoboSki\npacker, approximately 1300 additional RoboSki packer samples were obtained via\nVirusTotal, and subsequently run against the capability. The resultant payload distribution is\nas denoted in the following chart:\n\n_Figure 14: Payload Distribution_\n\nThe most common payload observed was Agent Tesla, accounting for over half of the\nobtained payloads. Notably, all the payloads fell into a category of commodity malware such\nas information stealers or commercial RATs.\n\n## An Ever-Evolving Commodity Malware Scene\n\nMalware distribution is a continually evolving practice that’s undertaken by potential botnet\nherders and spam distributors alike, constantly on the quest to bypass organizational\nsecurity controls to deliver malware. As part of that ecosystem, commodity packers, such as\n\n\n-----\n\nRoboSki, are used extensively to spread numerous types of malicious code. Keeping up to\ndate about new variations, IOCs, and overall delivery TTPs are essential to keeping\nnetworks free of malware that could eventually result in more advanced compromises.\n\nTo avoid the associated risks that come with a reliance on digital exchange for operations,\nthe use of automation to rapidly generate indicators can help equip Net Defenders with the\nnecessary insight to identify and prevent compromise. X-Force and CT analysts assess with\nhigh confidence that the use of ordering and logistics themed phishing emails will persist,\nespecially as global trade continues to recover. Organizations especially engaged in the\nimport and export of items worldwide, should exercise extreme caution and harden their\nnetwork environments.\n\nFor up to date information about malware campaigns, IOCs, and malware reports, join us on\n[X-Force Exchange.](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/)\n\n\n-----",
