According to\nprosecutors, the defendants stole more than 31 terabytes of data from universities,\ncompanies, and government agencies around the world. The cost to the universities alone\nreportedly amounted to approximately $3.4 billion. The information stolen from these\nuniversities was used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or sold for profit\ninside Iran.\n\nToday, [@TheJusticeDept,](https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#FBI,](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBI?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@USTreasury,](https://twitter.com/USTreasury?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@NewYorkFBI, &](https://twitter.com/NewYorkFBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@SDNYnews](https://twitter.com/SDNYnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[announced charges against nine Iranians for conducting massive #cyber theft](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cyber?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\ncampaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n[https://t.co/WS382CZPUm](https://t.co/WS382CZPUm) [pic.twitter.com/qHHd2bajTa](https://t.co/qHHd2bajTa)\n\n— FBI (@FBI) [March 23, 2018](https://twitter.com/FBI/status/977202144045621258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nPhishLabs has been tracking this same threat group since late-2017, designating them Silent\nLibrarian. Since discovery, we have been working with the FBI, ISAC partners, and other\ninternational law enforcement agencies to help understand and mitigate these attacks.\n\nThe details of the phishing attacks identified by PhishLabs give a broader sense of the\noverall threat posed by this group when read alongside the crimes outlined in the indictment.\nWhile the indictment details the finely-crafted spear phishing campaigns targeting university\nprofessors, the attacks tracked by PhishLabs also involved the general targeting of university\nstudents and faculty to collect credentials for the victims’ university library accounts. In light\nof the news from Friday, we are sharing insights and research that provide additional context\nto the Mabna Institute indictment.\n\n## History and Targets\n\nPhishLabs began compiling attacks, lures, and other information tied to Silent Librarian in\nDecember 2017. Starting with just two domains that hosted nearly two dozen university\nphishing sites, we used PassiveDNS analysis, Whois data, SSL certificate monitoring, and\nopen source research to identify more phishing sites linked to the same group. To date, we\nhave identified more than 750 phishing attacks attributed to Silent Librarian dating back to\nSeptember 2013. These attacks have targeted more than 300 universities in 22\n\n\n-----\n\ncountries. While most of the targeted universities are located in the United States, Canada,\nUnited Kingdom, and Australia, there have also been schools targeted in other countries in\nWestern Europe and Asia.\n\n_Countries targeted by Silent Librarian phishing attacks._\nLooking at the list of university targets, it is clear that they are not randomly selected. All of\nthe universities targeted in the Silent Librarian campaigns are generally prominent research,\ntechnical, or medical universities. Some schools in particular have been targeted numerous\ntimes over the past four-and-a-half years. For example, Monash University, located in\nAustralia, has been a popular Silent Librarian target. The university has been targeted more\nthan two dozen times by the group since the beginning of 2017. In addition to universities,\nSilent Librarian has also targeted non-academic institutions, such as Los Alamos National\nLaboratory, Electric Power Research Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Ohio\nState Wexner Medical Center, and Thomson Reuters.\n\n## Silent Librarian Lures\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Silent Librarian phishing campaigns is that their tactics have\nbarely changed over time. Outside the correction of a few minor spelling errors, the content\nof the phishing lures has remained incredibly consistent. The likely reason for this\nconsistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high enough that\n\n\n-----\n\nthere was no need for them to evolve. From a research perspective, though, the static\nnature of the group’s lure made it easier for us to identify past campaigns and track new\ncampaigns as they occurred.\n\n_Body of an email lure sent to an American university in February 2014._\n\n_Body of an email lure sent to an Australian university in October 2017._\n\nOverall, the lures constructed by Silent Librarian are remarkably authentic-looking. Spelling\nand grammar, two of the primary indicators of a malicious email, are nearly perfect. The\nmessage in the lures are contextually legitimate, meaning it is an email a recipient could be\nreasonably expected to receive.\n\nMost of the Silent Librarian lure emails contain spoofed sender email addresses, which make\nthem appear as if they’re coming from a legitimate source. Some of the phishing emails,\nthough, have been sent from temporary Gmail addresses. A small number of lures have\neven been sent from what appear to be email accounts at various Turkish universities.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example lure sent from a temporary Gmail account._\n\nEach of the Silent Librarian lures ends with a very realistic looking closing signature\ncontaining contact information for the target library. This information is collected through\nopen source research conducted by the threat actors. In some cases, all of the contact\ninformation can be found together on one webpage; however, some of the information is in\ndifferent locations, indicating the actors are likely performing manual reconnaissance to\ngather the information.\n\nAt least a third of the Silent Librarian lures identified use fictitious personas to add a sense of\nauthenticity to the emails. The names of these personas have evolved over time; however,\nthe group has used the personas “Sarah Miller” and “Susan Jackson” frequently in recent\ncampaigns. The group also changes the names of the personas to match the location of the\ntarget university. For example, a recent campaign targeting an Australian university used the\npersona “Jonathon Dixon,” while the persona identity “Shinsuke Hamada” was previously\nused in an email lure targeting a Japanese school.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example lure containing “Sarah Miller” persona sent from a Turkish university email account._\n\nLike the overall content of their lures, the subject lines of Silent Librarian phishing emails\nhave remained consistent over time. Since the beginning of 2017, 97 percent of lures\ncontained the subject “Library Account,” “Library Notifications,” or “Library Services.”\nSometimes the name of the target university has been appended to the subject to add more\nperceived authenticity to the attack vector.\n\n## Phishing Pages\n\nWe have identified 127 different domains used to host Silent Librarian phishing sites since\n2013. Like a growing number of phishing sites, domains registered by Silent Librarian\ngenerally use Freenom top-level domains (TLDs) (.TK, . CF, .GA, .GQ, .ML) because they\n\n\n-----\n\nare available at no cost. The group has used domains on other TLDs, though rather\nsparingly. Some of the other recent TLDs associated with Silent Librarian domains include\n.IN, .IR, .INFO, .LINK, and .TOP.\n\nLike their lures, the phishing sites crafted by Silent Librarian are very realistic. The URLs\nassociated with the phishing pages closely mirror the full legitimate URL path of the account\nlogin page for the target university library.\n\n_Legitimate American University Library Login URL (above)_\n\n_Silent Librarian Phishing URL (January 2018)_\n\nThe content of Silent Librarian phishing pages is almost identical to the legitimate target\nsites. The actors likely scrape the original HTML source code from the legitimate library login\npage, then edit the references to resources used to render the webpage (images, JavaScript,\nCSS, etc.) to point back to the original page, a common tactic among phishers.\n\n_Side-by-side comparison of a legitimate login page (left) and a phishing page (right)._\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, Silent Librarian began to regularly obtain free Let’s Encrypt SSL\ncertificates for their phishing pages. This technique, which we have previous discussed at\n[length in blog posts from November and](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/have-we-conditioned-web-users-to-be-phished) [December, is used to create more realistic-looking](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/quarter-phishing-attacks-hosted-https-domains)\nphishing pages.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example phishing page with valid SSL certificate._\n\nFor a few of the Silent Librarian attacks, we identified and collected the phish kits that were\nused to construct the phishing sites and left on the malicious server. Phish kits contain all of\nthe files necessary to stand up a phishing site quickly, such as HTML files, PHP mailing\nscripts, and other resources (image files, JavaScript, CSS, etc.). Because these kits are\nessentially the “recipe” of how a phishing site is created, they can provide valuable\nintelligence into the back-end functionality of the site. One of the best pieces of evidence that\ncan be collected from a phish kit is the PHP mailing script, which contains the location where\ncompromised information is sent, usually an email address. An analysis of the Silent\nLibrarian kits identified two email accounts that were used to receive compromised victim\ncredentials. One was a Gmail email address and the other was an email address with\nVatanmail, an Iranian email service provider.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Silent_\n\n_Librarian PHP mailer referencing a Vatanmail drop email account._\n\n## What Happens to the Stolen Credentials?\n\nAs outlined in Friday’s indictment, in addition to being passed to the IRGC, some of the\nstolen credentials were also sold on two Iranian websites, Megapaper[.]ir and Gigapaper[.]ir.\nSimilarly, the credentials stolen in the Silent Librarian phishing attacks we identified were\nsold on an Iranian website; however, it is not one of the sites specified in the indictment.\n\nUsing a combination of technical and open source research, we identified another website,\nUniaccount[.]ir, that was used to sell the credentials compromised in the Silent Librarian\nphishing attacks. The Uniaccount website is likely run by Mostafa Sadeghi, who was named\nin the recent indictment as a “prolific Iran-based computer hacker who was an affiliate of the\nMabna Institute.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Uniaccount home page._\n\nOn the Uniaccount website, credentials are offered for dozens of universities around the\nworld. Visitors are asked to send an email to a specified Gmail address to request the price\nof a password for a specific university. Notably, the website also mentions that all accounts\nthat are purchased have a one-month warranty, so if the account is cut off during that period,\nthe purchaser will be given a new account to use.\n\nIn addition to\n\nbuying an account for a specific university, a visitor on Uniaccount can also simply purchase\nresearch journal articles individually. The cost of a single article on Uniaccount is 2,000\nTomans, or approximately 60 U.S. cents. Ebooks and standards documents are also\nadvertised for sale on the site.\n\n\n-----\n\nPhishLabs continues to collaborate with universities, law enforcement, and ISAC partners as\nwe discover more information about this group.\n\n{{cta(‘f8eb51c1-9d02-44f3-9779-6d6b6fb519cf’,’justifycenter’)}}\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n\n-----",
