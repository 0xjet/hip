Those changes had as\nsource discrete developments in motives and tactics of the most important threat agent groups, namely\ncyber-criminals and state-sponsored actors. Monetization motives have contributed to the appearance of\ncrypto-miners in the top 15 threats. State-sponsored activities have led to the assumption that there is a\nshift towards reducing the use of complex malicious software and infrastructures and going towards low\nprofile social engineering attacks. These developments are the subject of this threat landscape report.\n\nDevelopments have been achieved from the side of defenders too. Through the emergence of active\ndefence, threat agent profiling has led to a more efficient identification of attack practices and malicious\nartefacts, leading thus to more efficient defence techniques and attribution rates. Initial successes\nthrough the combination of cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) and traditional intelligence have been achieved.\nThis is a clear indication about the need to open cyberthreat intelligence to other related disciplines with\nthe aim to increase quality of assessments and attribution. Finally, defenders have increased the levels of\ntraining to compensate skill shortage in the area of cyberthreat intelligence. The vivid interest of\nstakeholders in such trainings is a clear indicator for their appetite in building capabilities and skills.\n\nRecent political activities have underlined the emergence of various, quite novel developments in the\nperceived role of cyberspace for society and national security. Cyber-diplomacy, cyber-defence and cyberwar regulation have dominated the headlines. These developments, when transposed to actions, are\nexpected to bring new requirements and new use cases for cyberthreat intelligence. Equally, through\nthese developments, existing structures and processes in the area of cyberspace governance will undergo\na considerable revision. These changes will affect international, European and Member States bodies. It is\nexpected that threat actors are going to adapt their activities towards these changes, affecting thus the\ncyberthreat landscape in the years to come.\n\nIn summary, the main trends in the 2018’s cyberthreat landscape are:\n\n    - Mail and phishing messages have become the primary malware infection vector.\n\n    - Exploit Kits have lost their importance in the cyberthreat landscape.\n\n    - Cryptominers have become an important monetization vector for cyber-criminals.\n\n    - State-sponsored agents increasingly target banks by using attack-vectors utilised in cyber-crime.\n\n    - Skill and capability building are the main focus of defenders. Public organisations struggle with staff\nretention due to strong competition with industry in attracting cybersecurity talents.\n\n    - The technical orientation of most cyberthreat intelligence produced is considered an obstacle towards\nawareness raising at the level of security and executive management.\n\n    - Cyberthreat intelligence needs to respond to increasingly automated attacks through novel\napproaches to utilization of automated tools and skills.\n\n    - The emergence of IoT environments will remain a concern due to missing protection mechanisms in\nlow-end IoT devices and services. The need for generic IoT protection architectures/good practices\nwill remain pressing.\n\n    - The absence of cyberthreat intelligence solutions for low-capability organisations/end-users needs to\nbe addressed by vendors and governments.\n\nAll these trends are included in the content of the ENISA Threat Landscape 2018 (ETL 2018). Identified\nopen issues leverage on these trends and propose actions to be taken in the areas of policy, business and\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nresearch/education. They serve as recommendations and will be taken into account in the future\nactivities of ENISA and its stakeholders. An overview of identified points is as follows:\n\n**Policy Conclusions:**\n\n- The EU will need to develop capabilities (human and technical) to address the needs for CTI\nknowledge management. EU Member States are requested to introduce measures to increase its\nindependence from currently available CTI sources (mostly from outside the EU) and enhance the\nquality of CTI by adding a European context.\n\n- As CTI is perceived as a public good, capabilities will be required to offer “baseline CTI” to all\ninterested organisations. EU governments and public administrations are requested to share\n“baseline CTI”, covering sectorial and low-maturity needs of organizations.\n\n- Regulatory barriers to collect CTI exists and should be removed. Coordinated efforts among EU\nMember States is required in the collection and analysis of CTI, as crucial activity in the\nimplementation of proper defence strategies.\n\n**Business conclusions**\n\n- Businesses will need to work towards making CTI available to a large number of stakeholders, with\nfocus on the ones that lack technical knowledge. The security software industry needs to research and\ndevelop solutions using automation and knowledge engineering, helping end-users and organizations\nmitigating most of the low-end automated cyberthreats, with minimum human intervention.\n\n- Businesses will need to take into account emerging supply chain threats and risks. The technology\nindustry needs to introduce qualitative measures into its production processes, perform end-to-end\nsecurity assessments and adhere to certification schemes.\n\n- Businesses will need to bridge the gap in security knowledge among the operated services and endusers of the service. The consumption of CTI knowledge is a major step to achieve this goal.\n\n**Technical/research/educational conclusions**\n\n- The ingestion of CTI knowledge needs to be enlarged to include accurate information on incidents and\ninformation from related disciplines. CTI vendors and researchers have to find ways to enlarge the\nscope of CTI, while reducing necessary manual activities.\n\n- CTI knowledge management needs to be the subject of standardisation efforts. Of particular\nimportance are the developments of standard vocabularies, standard attack repositories, automated\ninformation collection methods and knowledge management processes.\n\n- Research needs to be conducted to better understand attack practices, malware evolution, malicious\ninfrastructure evolution and threat agent profiling. Advances in those areas may significantly reduce\nexposure to cyberthreats and advance CTI practices.\n\n- Much more training offerings need to be developed in order to satisfy the current market needs in CTI\ntraining.\n\nIn the last chapter of this document (see chapter 6), a number of important issues leading to the above\nconclusions are mentioned, providing more elaborated conclusions. It is proposed to consider these\nissues and identify their relevance by reflecting them to the own situation and elaborate on it accordingly.\n\nThe figure below summarizes the top 15 cyberthreats and trends in comparison to the landscape of 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Assessed Trends** **Assessed** **Change in**\n\n**Top Threats 2018**\n**2017** **Trends 2018** **ranking**\n\n####  1.

Introduction\n\nThis is the 2018 version of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL 2018) yearly report. It is the seventh in a\nseries of ENISA reports analysing the state-of-the-art in cyberthreats based on open source material[1]. This\nreport is the result of a one-year long collection, analysis and assessment activity of cyberthreat related\ninformation found in the public domain. Moreover, it captures experience gained through interactions\nwith experts during various ENISA events on the topic of Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI)[16,19]. The time span\nof the ETL 2018 is ca. December 2017 to December 2018 and is referred to as the “reporting period”\nthroughout the report.\n\nIn essence, ETL 2018 has maintained the structure of the previous ETL[2] by using the same template for the\ndescription of the assessed cyberthreats.\n\nAs part of the annual improvement process, some adaptations have been applied to the ETL 2018. These\nimprovements, originated from discussions with internal/external experts, helped increasing the\nefficiency in generating the report, collecting and disseminating the information and establishing better\ncoherence among a variety of ENISA materials on cyberthreats. As opposed to the ETL 2017, in 2018 these\nadvancements are merely content-oriented. Firstly, we included some work performed by ENISA in the\narea of CTI Maturity Model. Secondly, the assessment of threats has been brought into a wider basis,\nleveraging upon contributions of additional experts who have supported the information collection and\nthe assessment exercise.\n\nAn additional step in advancing ETL 2018 has been the inclusion of CTI knowledge obtained within related\nENISA events. Both the ENISA - FORTH Summer School and the ENISA event of CTI (CTI EU)[3] have\ndelivered valuable insights into the trends governing current CTI state-of-the-art. This knowledge has\nbeen integrated in this report by means of content related to CTI State-of-Play, the assessed cyberthreats\nand the conclusions drawn.\n\nThe channels used for information collection, ENISA has used information provided by the MISP\nplatform[4], by CERT-EU[5] and by also using threat intelligence of the cyber-security portal CYjAX[6], granted\nas access pro bono to ENISA. Confidential information found in these platforms has been taken into\naccount in our analysis without any disclosure or reference to this material.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that in 2018 ENISA has advanced with an established liaison with the EU\nagencies with cyber-security on the mandate. This involves the European Defence Agency (EDA), CERT-EU\nand EC3. This has been implemented by means of discussions for a more enhanced cooperation among all\n\n1 It is worth mentioning, that in this chapter some parts of the ETL 2017 text have been reused, in particular\nregarding the sections policy context and target group. These two topics are considered mostly identical to the\nprevious landscapes. Some changes have been added to policy context to reflect recent developments in EU–\nregulations.\n2 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-report-the-2017-cyber-threat-landscape, accessed](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-report-the-2017-cyber-threat-landscape)\nNovember 2018.\n3 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2018-cti-eu-event, accessed November 2018.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2018-cti-eu-event)\n4 [http://www.misp-project.org/, accessed November 2018.](http://www.misp-project.org/)\n5 [https://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html, accessed November 2018.](https://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html)\n6 [https://www.cyjax.com/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.cyjax.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nfour organisations, on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding that has been signed in the\nreporting period[7].\n\nThe links to these institutions already existed at a working level. ENISA has a tight cooperation with CERTEU in the area of threat information. This is implemented by means of mutual reviews of cyberthreat\nassessments, use of CERT-EU services and by intensive personal communication.\n\nWhile with EC3 and EDA a working relationship already exists, this year cooperation in the area of CTI has\nadvanced with the ENISA CTI EU event that was commonly supported by all four institutions. In addition,\nin 2018, ENISA has intensified its cooperation with the Commission services by engaging resources from\nDG Connect and European Security and Defence College within its CTI EU event[16].\n\n###### Policy context\n\nThe Cyber Security Strategy of the EU[8] underscores the importance of threat analysis and emerging trends\nin cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape contributes towards the achievement of objectives\nformulated in this strategy, in particular by contributing to the identification of emerging trends in\ncyberthreats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see 2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).\n\nMoreover, the ENISA Regulation[9 ]mentions the need to analyse current and emerging risks (and their\ncomponents), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with\n_statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the_\nnew ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses to current and emerging\n_network and information security risks and threats”._\n\nETL 2018 also relates to the context of the NIS-Directive[10], as it contributes towards the provision of\ncyberthreat knowledge needed for various purposes defined in the NIS-Directive (e.g. article 69).\nMoreover, it comprises a comprehensive overview of cyberthreats and as such, it is a decision support\ntool for EU Member States used in various tasks in the process of building cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nOf particular interest is, however, the important role of threat landscaping and threat intelligence within\nthe proposed new ENISA regulation/ ENISA mandate[11]. Article 7.7 foresees that “The Agency shall prepare\n_a regular EU Cybersecurity Technical Situation Report on incidents and threats based on open source_\n_information, its own analysis, and reports shared by, among others: Member States' CSIRTs (on a_\n_voluntary basis) or NIS Directive Single Points of Contact (in accordance with NIS Directive Article 14 (5));_\n_European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol, CERT EU.”. ENISA’s work in the area of threat analysis (as_\nexemplified by this report) largely satisfies this requirement, while articles 9 and 10 states the role of\nemerging cyberthreats, both to perform long-term analysis and feed research initiatives. Despite the fact\nthat this proposal may be modified during the review process, the role of threat analysis assigned by this\ndraft regulation is indicative for its future importance.\n\n7 [https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf,](https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf)\naccessed November 2018.\n\n8 [http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-](http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security)\n\n[freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed November 2018.](http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security)\n\n9 [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed November](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF)\n\n2018.\n10 [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN, accessed November](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN)\n2018.\n11 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of-enisa)\nof-enisa, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nConcluding the entire policy context with regard to cybersecurity, one has to mention an announcement\nof the Commission services that puts all cybersecurity related initiatives in the context policy areas in the\nEU space[12]. Besides repeating some of the policy documents mentioned above, this source touches upon\ndomains that are related to cybersecurity, thus underlying the importance of understanding the emerging\nthreat landscape. Of particular interest are the developments in the area of cyber defence, being one of\nthe most dynamic ones in the current and forthcoming Commission activities[13].\n\n###### Target audience\n\nThe information in this report has mainly strategic and tactical relevance[14] of approximately one year. It is\ndirected at executives, security architects and security managers. Nonetheless, the information provided\nis also of use by non-experts. For all these target groups, ENISA has developed a web application that will\nfacilitate the use of the ETL information.\n\nLooking at the details provided by this report and ETL in general, one can distinguish between the\nfollowing information types and target groups:\n\n  - The first part of the document found in chapter 2 is a description of the current state-of-play in\ncyberthreat intelligence (CTI). It reflects discussions performed in 2018 with the ENISA Threat\nLandscape Stakeholder Group (ETL SG) and within the ENISA event on Cyberthreat Intelligence in the\nEU (CTI EU)[16]. This information targets security professionals or scholars interested in open/emerging\nissues of CTI.\n\n  - The top cyberthreats may find a wider group of potential stakeholders who are interested in\nunderstanding the threat landscape in general or deepen their understanding to cover particular\nthreats and their aspects. Hence, decision makers, security architects, risk managers, auditors clearly\nbelong to the target group. Scholars and end-users who wish to be informed about the where-about\nof various cyberthreats may find this material useful. Finally, ETL 2018 can be a useful tool for\n**professionals of any speciality who are interested in understanding the state-of-play in the area of**\ncyberthreats.\n\nBesides the information on cyberthreats, ETL 2018 is offering an overview of the entire cybersecurity\nthreat “ecosystem”, by covering the relationships of various objects, such as threat agents, trends and\nmitigation controls. These interconnections make up the context of cyberthreats and can be used in\nvarious other activities, such as, any kind of security assessment, identification of protection needs or\ncategorization of assets.\n\nTogether with ETL 2018, interested readers may find a series of publications analysing cyberthreats based\non contemporary incidents. These reports are published as Cybersecurity Infonotes[15], issued in a regular\nbasis.\n\n12 [https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cyber-security, accessed November 2018.](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cyber-security)\n13 [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/11/19/cyber-defence-council-updates-policy-](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/11/19/cyber-defence-council-updates-policy-framework/)\n[framework/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/11/19/cyber-defence-council-updates-policy-framework/)\n14 [https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2015/23-march-2015-mwr_threat_intelligence_whitepaper-](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2015/23-march-2015-mwr_threat_intelligence_whitepaper-2015.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb)\n[2015.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb, accessed December 2017.](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2015/23-march-2015-mwr_threat_intelligence_whitepaper-2015.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb)\n15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info[notes#c5=2008&c5=2018&c5=false&c2=infonote_publication_date&reversed=on&b_start=0, accessed November](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes#c5=2008&c5=2018&c5=false&c2=infonote_publication_date&reversed=on&b_start=0)\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### Structure of the document\n\nThe structure of ETL 2018 is as follows:\n\nChapter 2 “Cyberthreat Intelligence and ETL” provides an overview of recent developments in cyberthreat\nintelligence, positions the ETL and summarizes some cyberthreat intelligence issues that are seen as\nemerging.\n\nChapter 3 “Top Cyberthreats” is the heart of the ENISA Threat Landscape.

Cyberthreat Intelligence and ETL\n\n###### Cyberthreat Intelligence: State of Play\n\nIn 2018, Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI) has continued improving with regard to good practices, tools,\ntraining courses and standards. These developments are the response to an increasing demand for\ncontextualized and actionable information about threats. Just as in 2017, large organisations continue to\nbe the main customer base for CTI. It is worth mentioning, that CTI has matured in concert with other\nrelated cybersecurity disciplines, such as Security Operation Centres (SOC), threat hunting and Security\nInformation and Event Management (SIEM). Nevertheless, CTI experts worry about the differences\nbetween cycles of cybersecurity related processes. In particular, syncing CTI with Incident Management,\nVulnerability Management and Risk management seems to be a necessity in order to keep the focus on\nincidents that matter for the protection of respective “crown jewels”[19].\n\nThough higher maturity levels are gradually implemented in large organisations, experts argue about the\nappropriateness of CTI in terms of a positive contribution to the enhancement of the level of defence[16,17].\nThe main concerns here are the increasing technical nature of CTI, the variability between CTI and other\ncybersecurity management disciplines in the organisation (e.g. Risk Management) and the potential\ndiversification of objectives among them. Shortage of CTI skills aggravates these deficiencies[18]. The\nimmense interest of experts in CTI trainings is a clear indicator of the market need for CTI trainings[19].\nMoreover, the adequacy of CTI for small and medium organisations is a valid concern within CTI experts.\n\nThrough the analysis of CTI publications[20,21], but also through a series of consultations with experts, ENISA\nhas identified the following topics as a summary of current CTI state of play.\n\nSome positive CTI developments:\n\n    - Pretty good information collection of publicly available CTI: information collection engines and tools\nexist, comprising of comprehensive collections in some cases grouped according various threat/attack\ntypes[22,23,24].\n\n    - Good information sharing, especially for low confidentiality incidents/threats: there are already either\nad-hoc or established CTI information sharing networks[25,26,27]. Loosely coupled individuals and user\ngroups establish repositories with CTI information for the most common threats.\n\n16 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2018-cti-eu-event, accessed November 2018.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2018-cti-eu-event)\n17 [https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/5-reasons-why-threat-intelligence-doesnt-work/a/d-](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/5-reasons-why-threat-intelligence-doesnt-work/a/d-id/1333188?print=yes)\n[id/1333188?print=yes, accessed November 2018.](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/5-reasons-why-threat-intelligence-doesnt-work/a/d-id/1333188?print=yes)\n18 [https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/membership/38285, accessed November 2018.](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/membership/38285)\n19 [https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/, accessed November 2018.](https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/)\n[20https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323704364_ODNI_COMMON_CYBER_THREAT_FRAMEWORK_A_NEW_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323704364_ODNI_COMMON_CYBER_THREAT_FRAMEWORK_A_NEW_MODEL_IMPROVES_UNDERSTANDING_AND_COMMUNICATION)\n[MODEL_IMPROVES_UNDERSTANDING_AND_COMMUNICATION, accessed November 2018.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323704364_ODNI_COMMON_CYBER_THREAT_FRAMEWORK_A_NEW_MODEL_IMPROVES_UNDERSTANDING_AND_COMMUNICATION)\n[21https://repository.stcloudstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=](https://repository.stcloudstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1085&context=msia_etds)\n[1085&context=msia_etds, accessed November 2018.](https://repository.stcloudstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1085&context=msia_etds)\n22 [https://embed.kumu.io/0b023bf1a971ba32510e86e8f1a38c38#apt-index, accessed November 2018.](https://embed.kumu.io/0b023bf1a971ba32510e86e8f1a38c38#apt-index)\n[23 https://github.com/CyberMonitor/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin_Collections, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/CyberMonitor/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin_Collections)\n24 [https://github.com/topics/attack, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/topics/attack)\n25 [https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/)\n26 [https://www.dhs.gov/ciscp, accessed November 2018.](https://www.dhs.gov/ciscp)\n27 [https://www.misp-project.org/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.misp-project.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- Sufficient training opportunities for most aspects of CTI: both professional and non-profit\norganisations offer comprehensive trainings on CTI[4,28,29]. Although available trainings cover most of\nthe market needs, it seems that additional elements regarding the use of CTI towards non-technical\nstakeholders are still necessary.\n\n- Good CTI practices with very comprehensive content: various state, academic and private\norganisations have issued CTI good practices (CTI-related frameworks, e.g. MITRE ATT&CK\nFRAMEWORK[30], CTI maturity models[31,32]). The high degree of uptake of these good practices\nmanifested through references in publications and presentations.\n\n- Good support of tools at the collection and correlation levels, especially for operational CTI:\nnumerous tools (both commercial and open source) do exist that facilitate correlation of CTI feeds\nand the identification of corrective actions to mitigate threats[33].\n\nDespite the positive developments in CTI, experts argue about several issues that are not optimally\nsettled. Areas where CTI could do better are:\n\n- Sharing of CTI information about higher confidentiality incidents: it has been argued, that CTI needs\nyet to penetrate important areas of cybersecurity. In particular, the use of CTI in emergency response\nhas not been yet sufficiently addressed[34]. Examples on the use of CTI in the Commission blueprint on\nCoordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises[35], or the use of CTI in the area\nof Industrial Control Systems[36].\n\n- Legal requirements regarding actions during collection of CTI information (e.g. vulnerability\nassessment): the legal frameworks for the collection of CTI needs to be further analysed. While in\nsome countries/sectors this matter is regulated[37], in many others, collecting intelligence is considered\na crime, putting thus limitations to corresponding activities of white hat actors[38,39]. This issue is acute\n\n28 [https://www.sans.org/course/cyber-threat-intelligence, accessed November 2018.](https://www.sans.org/course/cyber-threat-intelligence)\n29 [https://www.giac.org/about/mission, accessed November 2018.](https://www.giac.org/about/mission)\n30 [https://attack.mitre.org/, accessed November 2018.](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n31 [https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/events/2017/using-cyber-threat-intelligence-to-defend-against-advanced-](https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/events/2017/using-cyber-threat-intelligence-to-defend-against-advanced-cyber-threats-the-theories-and-practice/)\n[cyber-threats-the-theories-and-practice/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/events/2017/using-cyber-threat-intelligence-to-defend-against-advanced-cyber-threats-the-theories-and-practice/)\n32 [https://www.eclecticiq.com/resources/white-paper-threat-intelligence-maturity-model, accessed November](https://www.eclecticiq.com/resources/white-paper-threat-intelligence-maturity-model)\n2018.\n33 [https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence)\n34 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2018-cti-eu-event/cti-eu-2018-presentations/cti-eu-2018-dgcnt-panel.pdf,](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2018-cti-eu-event/cti-eu-2018-presentations/cti-eu-2018-dgcnt-panel.pdf)\naccessed November 2018.\n35 [https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-6100-F1-EN-ANNEX-1-PART-1.PDF, accessed](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-6100-F1-EN-ANNEX-1-PART-1.PDF)\nNovember 2018.\n36 [https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252436129/Cyber-threat-to-industrial-control-systems-highest-yet,](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252436129/Cyber-threat-to-industrial-control-systems-highest-yet)\naccessed November 2018.\n37 [https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-regulations/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-regulations/)\n38 [https://www.csoonline.com/article/3268761/data-protection/insider-threat-legalese.html, accessed November](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3268761/data-protection/insider-threat-legalese.html)\n2018.\n39\n\n[https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Securing%20High%20Value%20Assets_Version%201.1_July%2](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Securing%20High%20Value%20Assets_Version%201.1_July%202018_508c.pdf)\n[02018_508c.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Securing%20High%20Value%20Assets_Version%201.1_July%202018_508c.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nas regards to all activities related to vulnerability management[40] (e.g. penetration testing, brute force\nattacks to running systems).\n\n- Better/accurate identification of operational environment (crown jewels): CTI should not only follow\ntechnological trends. It needs to connect to business as early as possible[41]. Of particular importance is\nthe identification of “crown jewels” to be protected[42]. Albeit being a tedious task due to its dynamic\nnature, asset identification introduce risks when threat-hunting/incident management activities lead\nto the recognition of (mostly intangible) assets that for some reason (nefariously or unintentionally),\nhave been omitted from asset identification efforts.\n\n- Asynchronous cycles among cybersecurity disciplines: due to the inherent agility of CTI and related\ndisciplines (incident management, incident response, threat hunting, and vulnerability management),\nit does not properly connect to enterprise risk management cycles[41]. It is necessary to interlink these\ncycles in order to avoid a mismatch between these disciplines, to avoid diversified, technologycentred viewpoints[2] and lose the benefit from its synergies.\n\n- Relevant CTI stakeholders need to be identified and integrated into CTI cycle: as it has already been\nidentified in previous points, this is one of the main concerns of CTI professionals for the time\nbeing[2,41]. The solution seems to rely on better interaction with stakeholders during the requirements\nanalysis phase. Though this matter is not new in cybersecurity processes, it seems that it lags behind\nthe desired maturity. This might be a result of technology bias from cybersecurity experts and the\nneed for increased management attention.\n\n- Strategic CTI needs to be better communicated to business at a strategic level: CTI needs to adapt to\nthe vocabulary of business and strategy[1]. One step towards this goal is the use of standardised\nterminology[30] and its proper communication to the executive level.\n\n- CTI needs to be better interfaced to thematic areas: there is no one-size-fits-all CTI. CTI makes better\nsense if targeted towards a particular thematic, business or IT components of an organisation. In\naccordance with the mentioned areas, it becomes evident that CTI needs to be tailored to the\npeculiarities of businesses and certainly to the dependencies of the “crown jewels” under protection.\n\n- Presentation, use and analytics of CTI reports need to be enhanced: not much effort has been\ninvested in making CTI available to a wider audience than the CTI team. This may require a style-guide\nfor CTI information depending on the audience it is directed to[41]. Main elements of such a style-guide\nare visualisations, analytics and Bottom-Line Up First (BLUF)[41]. ENISA released this year a smart\ncybersecurity search engine named Open-CSAM[43]. A tool developed aiming the continuous monitor of\nsources, highlighting trending stories and news regarding cybersecurity threats, using artificial\nintelligence (AI).\n\n- CTI Skill profiles and roles need to be developed and adapted to the CTI (maturity) model adopted: it\nis a matter of fact that there is a skill shortage in CTI[44]. During the reporting period, some proposals\n\n40 [https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/02/pen-testing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/02/pen-testing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-agreement/?slreturn=20181012043755)\n[agreement/?slreturn=20181012043755, accessed November 2018.](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/02/pen-testing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-agreement/?slreturn=20181012043755)\n41 [https://threatintel.eu/2018/11/10/lets-make-cti-great-again/, accessed November 2018.](https://threatintel.eu/2018/11/10/lets-make-cti-great-again/)\n42 [https://www.moorestephens.co.uk/MediaLibsAndFiles/media/MooreStephensUK/Documents/Moore-Stephens-](https://www.moorestephens.co.uk/MediaLibsAndFiles/media/MooreStephensUK/Documents/Moore-Stephens-A-guide-to-Intellectual-property_1.pdf?ext=.pdf)\n[A-guide-to-Intellectual-property_1.pdf?ext=.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.moorestephens.co.uk/MediaLibsAndFiles/media/MooreStephensUK/Documents/Moore-Stephens-A-guide-to-Intellectual-property_1.pdf?ext=.pdf)\n43 [https://webapp.opencsam.enisa.europa.eu/, accessed November 2018.](https://webapp.opencsam.enisa.europa.eu/)\n44 [https://www.information-age.com/cyber-threat-landscape-skills-crisis-123471070/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.information-age.com/cyber-threat-landscape-skills-crisis-123471070/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nhave been made including a combination of automated tools[45],[46] and more precise CTI skill profiles for\nthe various levels of CTI maturity levels. Although this proposal may lead to a better coverage of CTI\nskills, existing CTI skill profile descriptions[47] are not considering the requirements of various CTI\nmaturity levels (see also corresponding conclusion point in this chapter).\n\n- Interlink between intelligence and CTI: to date, most CTI good practices are based on technical issues\nof information collection and analysis. Yet, in 2018, the relevance of CTI and traditional intelligence\nhas come to the forefront[48]. Experts argue that bridging these two disciplines will bring CTI closer to a\nnumber of non-technical stakeholders, while at the same time, enhance the quality of assessments.\n\n- CTI to be understood as a function: CTI needs to depart from a purely technological discipline to be\nrooted in the economic, geographic, regulatory, economic and strategic areas as a discrete function.\nFor this purpose, various roles of experts need to be defined aiming at the increase of visibility and\nusability of CTI.\n\nConcluding the state-of-play of CTI, we would like to mention a few topics that have been identified and\nregard the necessity for a European engagement in this area. After a discussion with experts in the field, it\nis considered that European businesses, Member States and organisations would need to initiate activities\nfor establishing the following CTI artefacts.\n\n- European raw data repositories: CTI is based on large amounts of collected information from\noperational systems. An important tool already operating in this area is Shadowserver[49]. Despite the\nmajor sponsorship from US companies, Shadowserver also collects European data. It is imperative for\nEurope to develop similar information collection capacities in order to develop its autonomy in this\ncritical sector. Such capability will help resolving overseas geopolitical dependencies and will allow an\nindependent mobilization of this resource in cases of emergencies within the EU.\n\n- Leveraging on EU CTI capabilities (planning, collection, collation, analysis, evaluation, dissemination):\nEurope needs to develop its’ own CTI capabilities to achieve an independent CTI knowledge base.\nOnce developed, these European CTI capabilities need to be included as a function in various\nEuropean initiatives that requires CTI feeds for the resolution of emergencies. This will include Law\nEnforcement Agencies (LEAs), CSIRTs, Cyber Defence, European Research and crisis management\ncapabilities, just to mention a few.\n\n- CTI Maturity Model: together with national and international partners, a CTI maturity model needs to\nbe developed. Given the novelty of such activity, involved actors may contribute with their\nrequirements, views or experience, thus leading to a good practice guide that is actionable for a\nvariety of CTI needs. In the reporting period, ENISA worked on the development of such model\ntogether with EU and US partners. The involvement of experts has been achieved through the\nmobilization of members of the ENISA Threat Landscape Stakeholder group. A first overview of the\nwork conducted by ENISA is presented in the next chapter (see chapter 2.2).\n\n- Development of CTI skill profiles/roles according to maturity levels: it is necessary to define various\nCTI roles and profiles[50] and adapt them to the maturity model.

This, in turn, would strengthen the European CTI job\nmarket and would increase Europe’s independency on CTI resources.\n\n  - CTI capabilities, CTI-as-a-Service (CaaS) for small and medium enterprises: Small and Medium\nEnterprises (SMEs) are the majority engaged in implementing IT systems, either directly or via supply\nchains. Given their role in the digital economy, SMEs are an important recipient of CTI knowledge. Yet,\ndue to the absence of skills, CTI is barely consumed by this type of organisations. Novel models of CTI\nusing tools and automation need to be developed and implemented for this purpose. Potentially, the\nresults of existing Horizon 2020 projects could build a good basis for this effort[51,52].\n\n  - Promoting a CTI culture: CTI practitioners need to organize themselves as a community to promote a\n“CTI culture” based on good practices, knowledge and experience sharing.\n\nThese and other topics have been debated in the ENISA CTI EU event, a CTI expert’s forum. Interested\nindividuals may find the event material in the corresponding web site[16] and/or attend the event.\n\n###### Cyberthreat Intelligence Maturity Model\n\nThe interest in CTI increased during the last five years, largely due to the need to have a better\nunderstanding about threats, adversary’s behaviour, tools and techniques in anticipation of cyberattacks.\n\nWith the adoption of automated monitoring and response solutions (based on AI and ML), cybersecurity\nprofessionals and decision makers are looking into new ways to prevent potential attacks. Part of the\nsolution is to obtain data and information that allows them to analyse and investigate the intention,\nbehaviour, tools, tactics and techniques of adversaries shifting from reactive to a proactive defence\nstrategy. The answer is to implement a CTI Program within the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the core\nelements and its interdependencies in a CTI Program.\n\n**Figure 1: Cyberthreat Intelligence Program representation**\n\n51 [https://project-saint.eu/, accessed November 2018.](https://project-saint.eu/)\n52 [https://sissden.eu/, accessed November 2018.](https://sissden.eu/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Objectives of a CTI Program are:\n\n\n_Promote resilience to_\n_cyber security threats._\n\n\n_Mitigate the risks from cyber_\n\n_security threats._\n\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**_Process and Capabilities_**\n\n_Promote a culture of awareness_\n\n_over cyber security threats._\n\n\nBy implementing such a program, the organization realizes a number of significant benefits, including:\n\n- Proactive identification of threats in the environment;\n\n- Increased efficiency of security and technical resources;\n\n- Improved communication of threats with sectorial, business and geographical context;\n\n- Increased capability for disseminating cyberthreat intelligence;\n\n- Improve communications with business Executives;\n\nThe expectation around the results produced by the CTI Program will ultimately depend on the how the\nprogram is planned, managed and evaluated. Much of the success in reaching the objectives will rely on\nthe governance model adopted during the first steps of the program. The following list captures some of\nthe core elements required to implement a CTI Program.\n\n- The **_Stakeholders_** ultimately define what is expected from a CTI Program. A CTI Program to be\neffective requires the alignment of information needs from stakeholders with the reality of the threat\nlandscape and the business context. The critical success factors rely on the capture of internal needs,\naligned with the ones from key stakeholders, to build people, process and technology that is fit for\npurpose.\n\n- To implement a CTI program, the appointment of a Team is required. The size of the team depends\non the scope of the Program, requirements from stakeholders and resources available in the\norganization to produces CTI. In smaller organizations, security related activities are typically\nperformed by someone from the ICT team, an outsourced company (e.g. cloud- based or service\nprovider) or an information security officer. In this situation, a program manager should be appointed\nto interface with the various technical and non-technical stakeholders, identify the requirements and\nassess the resources required. In larger organizations, the CTI Program team typically remains within\nthe Security Operation Center (SOC) under the Security Management Team. Considering the CTI\nProgram as a function, separate from the purely technical disciplines, positions the CTI Program Team\ncloser to business and the risk management as a discrete function.\n\n- The Scope of the Program refers to the various elements that may affect the production of CTI. The\ndefinition of the scope helps the CTI Program Team to select the sources, collect the information and\nanalyse it in context to the needs of the organization and its operating environment. Examples of\ntechnical infrastructure, future adoption of technology, policy, business strategy, among others are\nstrong candidates to outline the scope of the program.\n\n- The Outcomes of a CTI Program are dependent on the scope and stakeholders intelligence\nrequirements, classified into four categories: strategic, operational, technical and tactical. Strategic\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**_CTI is considered high-level information, consumed by senior management of an organization._**\n**_Operational CTI is relevant to the work of security staff such as defenders, penetration testers and_**\nincident responders. Technical CTI typically feeds the ICT staff to adjust the monitoring systems with\nsecurity configuration requirements. Tactical CTI is often referred to as Tactics, Techniques and\nProcedures (TTPs) produced internally or obtained from external sources.\n\n- The Process progresses through five clearly defined steps. The first step establishes the governance\nstructure of the program. The following steps include the collection, processing and analysis of data\nand information from various sources. The last steps focus on the evaluation, sharing and distribution\nof the CTI produced.\n\n- The Capabilities required for the implementation of the Program are multiple and include the\nmanagement of stakeholders, scope, requirements, sources of information, ingestion of structured\nand unstructured data and information, production, evaluation and dissemination of CTI. Not all\norganizations possess the resources and organizational structure required to implement a complete\nCTI Program. In this case, the decision might be to narrow the scope and requirements or to\noutsource some of the capabilities. In any case, the aforementioned objectives are still valid.\n\n- Each capability requires the execution of Activities with well-defined inputs, processing and outputs.\nCertain activities can be supported by systems - more automated solutions based in software - or\nmanual procedure - less automated. The option to adopt a system or a manual procedure depends on\nthe workload and resources available to the CTI program.\n\nA CTI Maturity Model helps in evaluating the state of play of the Program within an organization. The\nmodel here proposed evaluates the process and each capability required to achieve the expected\noutcomes.\n\nThe following fourteen questions try to ascertain whether certain preconditions are met in the\nimplementation of a CTI Program.\n\n1. Is the CTI Program known internally to the organization?\n\n2. Are the CTI Program objectives clearly defined and aligned with those of the organization?\n\n3. Does a process exists to identify and maintain information from relevant stakeholders?\n\n4. Does a process exists, to register and/or maintain stakeholders’ priorities and intelligence\n\nrequirements?\n\n5. Does the information about systems, digital assets and critical information exists and is accessible to\n\nthe CTI Program team?\n\n6. Is there an assessment and planning of resources required for the implementation of the CTI\n\nProgram?\n\n7. Does the CTI Program team has access to the organization’s security information and event\n\nmanagement data?\n\n8. Does a clearly defined process exists for collecting structured and unstructured threat data and\n\ninformation?\n\n9. Does an internal repository for threat data and information collected exists?\n\n10. Does the CTI Program team uses threat analysis and modelling techniques to produce CTI?\n\n11. Does the organization has an internal/external CTI dissemination policy?\n\n12. Does a process exists to support and manage the internal and external dissemination of CTI?\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n13. Does an independent process of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of CTI exists?\n\n14. Is there a clearly defined process of continuous learning and improvement, leading to proactive\n\nresponse to threats?\n\nFrom the answers obtained, it will be possible to identify the level of maturity of each capability and the\ngeneral state of the CTI Program. The maturity model considers four levels of evaluation:\n\n- **_Initial - An initial level, where the process is informal and information is generated in an unpredictable_**\nand reactive manner. There is no internal knowledge of the Program and no expectation or value\ndrawn. CTI is generated based on external information provided by third parties, particularly through\nalerts from specialized press or security vendors alerts.\n\n- **_Managed - A more advanced level, with greater control over the management of the program. A_**\nprocess involving stakeholders is established to discuss and agree on their expectations and\nintelligence requirements, although CTI is sporadically used. At this level, data (IoCs mainly) and\ninformation is collected from internal sources into a single repository, and later enriched with\nexternal information. An internal sharing process is established mainly based on distribution lists.\n\n- **_Repeatable - With greater management control, the next level considers the qualitative and_**\nquantitative evaluation of the results obtained, ensuring that these are aligned with those of the\norganization and its stakeholders. Recommendations and course of actions (CoA) are produced based\non analytical models through the association, correlation of data and information about motives,\ncapabilities, targets and behaviour of adversaries. CTI is integrated automatically into stakeholders\nsystems and processes.\n\n- **_Optimized - The last level considers the constant improvement of the Program with the main focus on_**\nlearning and optimization. The program success results from the collaboration and effort from all\nstakeholders and the CTI program team. CTI is recurrently used by all the stakeholders for decisionmaking and action.\n\nThe following table maps the evaluation criteria defined to the levels and capabilities of the maturity\nmodel.\n\n|Capability/level|INITIAL|MANAGED|REPEATABLE|OPTIMIZED|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1 – PLANNING PHASE|||||\n|1.1 Stakeholders Management|No knowledge about who are the stakeholders.|Stakeholders identified and registered.|Management of all Stakeholders interaction throughout the program.|All information from stakeholders, requirements, scope and resources are integrated and later associated with the CTI produced.|\n|1.2 Scope Management|No knowledge about digital assets, systems and processes in the organization.|Digital assets, “crown jewels”, processes and systems identified.|Management of all interaction with information from digital assets, “crown Jewels”, processes and systems.|All information from stakeholders, requirements, scope and resources are integrated and later associated with the CTI produced.|\n|1.3 Requirement Management|No knowledge about the stakeholders’ intelligence requirements.|Registration of stakeholder’ priorities and intelligence requirements.|Manage all interaction with stakeholders’ priorities and intelligence requirements.|All information from stakeholders, requirements, scope and resources are integrated and later associated with the CTI produced.|\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n|Capability/level|INITIAL|MANAGED|REPEATABLE|OPTIMIZED|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1.4 Resource Management|No resource requirements defined for the program.|Resource requirements identified for each of the activities.|Manage the resource allocation to activities throughout the program.|All information from stakeholders, requirements, scope and resources are integrated and later associated with the CTI produced.|\n|1.5 Program Management|The program is unknown to stakeholders.|The Program obtains organizational by-in but there is no general perception on how CTI may add value to stakeholder’s work.

Top Cyberthreats\n\nThe fifteen Top Cyberthreats reviewed in this year’s edition of the ETL results from the analysis of\ninformation collected throughout the reporting period. The information collected - mainly from publicly\navailable sources (Open source intelligence - OSINT) and some other references from commercial\nproviders - covers the majority of the most remarkable events and developments relevant to the study of\nthe top cyberthreats. However, ENISA does not claim exhaustiveness of the topics from the information\ncollected[53].\n\nContinuing the trend from previous years, incidents and advancements in defence and attack tactics have\nincreased in the reporting period. Among the many interesting developments in 2018, ransomware and\ncryptocurrency attacks have dominated the threat landscape. A further remarkable development is the\nmassive increase in the number of phishing/spear phishing attacks: it has now covered the gaps created\nby lawful takedowns of malicious infrastructure components such as botnets and exploit kits, while the\nrole of the latter has been significantly downgraded. The success of these methods is manifested by the\nnew record in data breaches reported in 2018.\n\nReference to the tight cooperation with CERT-EU, ENISA permanent stakeholders group and CYjAX\nIntelligence Portal (access provide pro-bono) manifested in the support provided during the collection\nprocess for this research. Moreover, malware information has been taken into account through the\nmalware information sharing platform MISP[54]. Though the information taken into account contained\nsome classified information, this material has not been disclosed. It has just been taken into account\nduring the analysis process, e.g. in the validation of performed assessments.\n\nThe presentation of the fifteen top cyberthreats follows the same structure defined for last year’s ETL.\nThe following list presents the structure of the ETL description template:\n\n    - a short description of the cyberthreat as it has manifested during the reporting period;\n\n    - a list of interesting points with remarkable observations for this cyberthreat;\n\n    - trends and main statistics including geographical information, when relevant;\n\n    - top incidents within this threat category;\n\n    - specific attack vectors used to launch this threat;\n\n    - specific mitigation actions;\n\n    - kill chain for this cyberthreat and\n\n    - authoritative references;\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the above elements might change depending on the findings and nature of\neach threat. Under certain conditions, kill-chains and mitigation actions (vectors) have been reused from\nprevious ETL reports, adapted accordingly, with new evidence as deemed necessary.\n\n53 Due to the surging number of information on cyber-security incidents and threats and the limited available\nresources, it is likely that many articles, reports, white papers, etc. have escaped our attention. It may also be the\ncase that missing reports have been intentionally left out from our references because they had significant overlaps\nwith used references.\n54 [https://www.misp-project.org/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.misp-project.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nThe fifteen top threats assessed reflect the dominance of the landscape during the reporting period. The\nlist presents one new entry and relevant changes in the ranking. The changes reflect the incidence of\nthreats throughout the reporting period. Some interesting observations regarding the researched\ncyberthreats and their ranking are as follows:\n\n- It is considered that data breaches and identity theft are not typical cyberthreats. Rather, they are\nconsequences of successful threats (i.e. actions on objectives, if formulated according to the killchain). In other words, in order to breach information, one has to successfully launch one or some of\nthe other cyberthreats addressed in this chapter. As such, data breach and identity theft are\nmaintained in our top list because they are found throughout the analysed material.\n\n- Some of the 15 cyberthreats belong to same distinct threat category. Hence, they represent instances\nfrom 12 threat types, according to the threat taxonomy used[55]. Ransomware, for example, is a\nspecialization of the threat type malware. Therefore, all malware protection measures must apply\nwith additional measures that are specific for this threat, i.e. in this case ransomware. The same is\ntrue for Identity Theft that is a special category of Data Breach. Nonetheless, it is handled separately\nbecause this threat is launched by special malicious artefacts.\n\n- Cyber espionage is more a motive than a cyberthreat. It has been maintained mainly because it unites\nalmost all of the other cyberthreats in addition to some high-capability threats that are specially\ncrafted by state-sponsored organisations, such as advanced hacking tools, vulnerability discovery and\ncombination of military/law enforcement intelligence methods.\n\n- The ranking in the list is indicative. The position is based on the number of incidents, impact and role\nplayed for other cyberthreats in the landscape. It was not considered the possibility of cyberthreats\nsharing the same position in the ranking. This leads to the interesting situation where - although a\nthreat increases - it is being ranked lower just because another cyberthreat has been ranked higher,\nimpacting thus the ranking of the ones below.\n\nA web-based tool is available for consultation of the findings from each multiannual ETL report. The tool\nprovides interactive and detailed cyberthreat information in a quicker and more efficient manner,\nallowing a better and more intuitive use of the ETL report.\n\n55 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy)\n[taxonomy, accessed November 2018.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### Malware\n\n 3.1.1 Description of the cyberthreat\n\nMalware is the most frequently encountered cyberthreat and somehow involved in 30% of all data breach\nincidents reported334. During the reporting period, there are no evidences of a global malware outbreak\nsimilar to the ones that happened during 2017 (i.e. WannaCry and Petya). We have observed, though, the\nmalware landscape evolved and malware authors are adjusting their TTPs in order to maximize their\nprofits and effectiveness rates. Notable observations include the shift from ransomware to cryptojacking,\nthe blurred lines between cyber criminals and cyber espionage actors, the high effectiveness of fileless\nattack techniques, the decline of exploit kits resulting in increased difficulty of delivering malware as well\nas the growing mobile threat landscape.\n\n###### 3.1.2 Interesting points\n\n  - **Advances in Command and Control (C2) communication. The use of encrypted C2 communication**\nhas increased by 300% during the reporting period[193], a development that creates challenges for the\nblue teams (especially the ones that have not implemented TLS interception[56]). Moreover, the (ab)use\nof legitimate encrypted channels is also growing, making the threat detection even more difficult as\ndomain and certificate intelligence are useless[193]. The percentage of malware samples that used\nlegitimate C2 services increased from 4% in 2008 to 9% in 2016[59]. Finally, an emerging trend for C2\ninfrastructure is the use of blockchain technology that is decentralised and difficult to take down[57]. It\nis expected that threat actors will continue (ab)using encrypted legitimate channels for C2\ncommunication, while the use of blockchain technology is expected to be leveraged (not widely\nthough) by cyber criminals[58,59].\n\n  - **Malware authors increasingly targeting IoT devices. One of the noteworthy events of 2018 was the**\nVPNFilter malware[60,61,62 ]campaign. VPNFilter is a multi-stage malware that targeted home and small\noffice routers and NAS devices. At the time of writing, it has compromised around 500.000 devices\nworldwide and thus created a huge anonymisation network for its creators[409]. Just like what\n\n56 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/ncsc-published-factsheet-on-tls-interception, accessed](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/ncsc-published-factsheet-on-tls-interception)\nOctober 2018.\n57 [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/04/cryptocurrencies-cyber-crime-blockchain-infrastructure-](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/04/cryptocurrencies-cyber-crime-blockchain-infrastructure-use.html)\n[use.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/04/cryptocurrencies-cyber-crime-blockchain-infrastructure-use.html)\n58 [https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n[predictions.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n59 [https://content.fireeye.com/predictions/rpt-security-predictions-2019, accessed November 2018.](https://content.fireeye.com/predictions/rpt-security-predictions-2019)\n60 [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\n61 [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/06/vpnfilter-update.html, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/06/vpnfilter-update.html)\n62 [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/09/vpnfilter-part-3.html, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/09/vpnfilter-part-3.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nhappened with Mirai[63], it is expected that VPNFilter malware will create copycats[427], aligned with the\nvolumes of attacks and vulnerabilities related to router and IoT devices during 2018[64,65,66,67].\n\n- **The blurred lines between nation state actors and cyber criminals[68]. It has been always the case that**\ncyber criminals follow and adopt TTPs used by nation state actors. During the reporting period, it has\nbeen observed that lines between actors are blurring and cyber criminals adopt advanced TTPs used\nby nation state actors[411,425]. Major TTPs that have been leveraged include fileless malware[69] and\nattacks against the RDP protocol[70]. Financial institutions and the retail sector are the most prominent\ntargets[328] and it is highly likely that cyber criminals will continue to leverage advanced TTPs initially\nused by nation state actors.\n\n- **The mobile malware landscape is steadily increasing. Mobile malware threats increase year-over-**\nyear and the continued use of older operating systems amplifies the problem[248,418]. Major mobile\nthreats include credential theft[71], mobile remote access trojans[421] and SIM card abuse/hijacking\n(followed by adware[72] and cryptomining[248], especially for Android devices[454]). Mobile threats are\nexpected to increase due to the mobile market growth, users’ shift to mobile banking and the\nupcoming rollout of the 5G mobile standard[241]. Moreover, it is expected that cyber criminals will put\neffort on increasing sophistication[421] of mobile malware as well as its’ delivery vectors (e.g. Roaming\nMantis spreading via DNS hijacking[73]).

More information on cryptojacking and ransomware threats can be found in\nthe respective sections of this report (see Ransomware threat in chapter 3.14).\n\n- **Fileless attack techniques are the new norm. Fileless malware techniques operate without placing**\nmalicious executables on the file system[77]. Fileless attacks are divided into 4 major techniques[78]: 1)\nmalicious documents (e.g. Microsoft Office with malicious macros, PDF files containing malicious\nJavaScript and abuse of DDE[79]), 2) malicious scripts (e.g. PowerShell, VBScript, batch files and\nJavaScript), 3) living-off-the-land techniques (e.g. WMI, LOLBins and LOLScripts[80]) and 4) malicious\ncode in memory (e.g. PowerSploit[93], Doppelgänging[81]). During the reporting period, we have observed\nincreasing fileless attack detections[82] the prevalence of which is so high that 77% of the attacks that\nsuccessfully compromised organizations utilized fileless techniques[82]. We expect that fileless attack\ntechniques will continue to be used by cyberthreat actors due to their effectiveness in evading\ndetection by organisations’ security controls. For more information about fileless attack-vector,\nplease consult chapter 5.4.\n\n- **A consistent year-over-year decline of financial trojans[248]. While financial trojans are still one of the**\nmost prevalent consumer threats, the number of detections over the years is falling[248]. This can be\nattributed to improved security controls, law enforcement activities and the shift of cyber criminals\ntowards other ways of making profit. It is interesting that some financial trojans do not only steal\nbanking credentials but also cryptocurrency wallet logins[83], while some have also added cryptomining\ncapabilities[172,436]. Most prevalent financial trojans during 2018 are Zeus, Emotet[84], URLzone, Ursnif\nand Trickbot[85]. It is expected that financial trojans will continue to be a key threat in the financial\nsector while cyber criminals are focusing on alternative ways to generate profits[241].\n\n- **The first malware targeting safety systems of critical infrastructure. During the reporting period, we**\nhave observed Triton which is the first malware that targets Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)[86,87,88].\nSafety instrumented systems are designed to shut down industrial processes when unsafe operating\nconditions are reached.

It is expected that the ICS/SCADA domain will be increasingly targeted by\nadvanced threat actors having the capability and intent to execute such operations.\n\n  - **Continued growth in the usage of open-source malware[59]. The “Githubification”[91] of Infosec gave the**\nopportunity for everyone to access hacking tools and frameworks like Mimikatz[92], Powersploit[93],\nMetasploit[94], Empire[95], PowerShell[96], PHP webshells[97], etc. Cyber-crime groups as well as cyber\nespionage groups have been extensively leveraging open source and publicly available tools for their\ncampaigns. The goals of this approach are to make attribution efforts harder and to reduce their\ntoolset development costs. We expect the continued usage and customization of such tools by both\ncyber espionage and cyber-crime actors.\n\n  - **Exploit kits in the back seat of preferred attack vectors. While exploit kits are still a threat, cyber**\ncriminals prefer other attack vectors to deliver their malicious payloads[428]. This trend has been\nobserved since 2016 when the disappearance of three prevalent exploit kits took place: Angler,\nNuclear and Neutrino[242]. The decline of exploit kits poses additional challenges to cyber criminals in\norder to deliver their malware[454]. Major exploit kits now are RIG EK, GrandSoft EK, Magnitude EK,\nGreenFlash Sundown EK, KaiXin EK and Underminer EK[98]. The identified low threat posed by exploit\nkits has resulted in not including this threat in the Top 15 of this ENISA Threat Landscape 2018 report\nfor the first time since 2013.\n\n###### 3.1.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - Although adware is one of the easiest ways to distribute malware and more often ignored by users,\nthere has been few developments of this threat during the reporting period[428].\n\n  - According to Verizon DBIR[334], the frequency of detected malware types is: .js (37,2%), .vbs (20,8%),\nWindows executable (14,8%), MS Office (14,4%), .pdf (3,3%) other (7,0%).\n\n  - A prevalence of polymorphic malware has been observed in the last years as 94% of all malicious\nexecutables have been polymorphic[417].\n\n  - 79% of the detected malware in organisations were targeting Windows, 18% Linux and 3% Mac\nsystems[436].\n\n  - The first Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) malware has been discovered in the wild[99].\n\n  - Most of the mobile malware was hosted in 3[rd] part app stores and the app categories that most\nmobile malware was found were Lifestyle (27%) and Music & Audio (20%)[248].\n\n[89https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossi](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf)\ner.pdf, accessed October 2018.\n90 [https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/)\nstuxnet/, accessed October 2018.\n91 [https://www.slideshare.net/attackcon2018/mitre-infosec-john-lambert-microsoft, accessed November 2018.](https://www.slideshare.net/attackcon2018/mitre-attckcon-2018-keynote-advancing-infosec-john-lambert-microsoft)\n92 [https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n93 [https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)\n94 [https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)\n95 [https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)\n96 [https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)\n97 [https://github.com/JohnTroony/php-webshells, accessed November 2018.](https://github.com/JohnTroony/php-webshells)\n98 [https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/08/exploit-kits-summer-2018-review/, accessed October](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/08/exploit-kits-summer-2018-review/)\n2018.\n99 [https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ESET-LoJax.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ESET-LoJax.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - On the positive side, a decline has been observed in the detections of PUA (Potential Unwanted\nApplications) tracking user behaviour[454].\n\n  - During 2018, there have been published a number of “celebrity” chipset vulnerabilities: Spectre and\nMeltdown[100,101], AMDFlaws[102] and Foreshadow[103].\n\n  - During the reporting period, the trend of pre-installed malware[455] has been observed in cases such as\nRottenSys[104] and Triada banking trojan[105].\n\n  - Remote Access Trojans are on the rise having FlawedAmmyy as the first ever RAT to appear in the top\nten malware list[106].\n\n  - Endpoints are increasingly targeted and this is the result of the blurring organisation perimeter and\nmobility[334]. By targeting endpoints, attackers can conduct reconnaissance, move laterally and further\nexecute their malicious actions.

According to Verizon DBIR334, email compromise\nwas the attack vector for 92,4% of detected malware, web and browser was the attack vector for 6,3%\nand 1,3% has been attributed to other attack vectors. Moreover, a non-negligible amount of malware still\nspreads via the web implying that web and browser based attack vectors such as exploit kits, malvertising,\ndrive-by and strategic web compromise are not dead. Besides email and web, special attention should be\ngiven to the abuse of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as an attack vector. The FBI has already published\nreports on the increasing usage of RDP to spread malware and more specifically ransomware70. Finally,\nsupply chain attacks is another attack vector can be utilised for delivering the malicious payload to\ntargeted organisations[107].\n\n###### 3.1.6 Specific mitigation actions\n\nThe mitigation vector for this threat contain the following elements:\n\n  - Relying exclusively on end-point or server malware detection and mitigation is not sufficient. Malware\ndetection should be implemented for all inbound/outbound channels, including network, web and\napplication systems in all used platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal computers and\nmobile devices).\n\n  - Establish interfaces of malware detection functions (intelligence led threat hunting) with security\nincident management in order to establish efficient response capabilities.\n\n  - Use available tools on malware analysis as well as sharing of malware information and malware\nmitigation (i.e. MISP)[108].\n\n  - Develop a security policies that specify the processes followed in cases of infection. Involve all\nrelevant roles, including executives, operations and end-users.\n\n107 [https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/supply-chain-attack-operation-red-signature-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/supply-chain-attack-operation-red-signature-targets-south-korean-organizations/)\n[targets-south-korean-organizations/, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/supply-chain-attack-operation-red-signature-targets-south-korean-organizations/)\n108 [http://www.misp-project.org/, accessed September 2018.](http://www.misp-project.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - Understand the capabilities of various security tools and develop security solutions.

This includes browser exploitations and injections (including extensions), websites, Content\nManagement System (CMS) exploitation, and web services. For instance, drive-by, watering-hole,\nredirection and man-in-the-browser attacks are a few known categories of such attacks. Web based\nattacks continued to be observed as one of the most important threats due to their wide spread surface\nacross the threat landscape, from general ad related spamming campaigns to banking trojans[117] and\nmultiple Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups[118] facilitating such attacks as their techniques to target\nvictims. This threat is expected to increase as more malware and exploitation techniques rely more\nheavily on it, as a delivery mechanism, during the end-to-end attack path.\n\n###### 3.2.2 Interesting points\n\nBelow are some interesting points about web based attacks:\n\n  - **APTs, malware campaigns and potential usage of watering-hole attacks. During March 2018 a**\nsecurity firm investigated a major telecommunication company in Hong Kong and identified a flash\nexploit (CVE-2018-4878) on their group’s corporate website – a great example of watering-hole\nattacks[119]. In addition, roughly during the same time, another campaign was identified targeting\nnational datacentres in central Asia potentially to conduct watering hole attacks, targeting employees\nand governments[120]. Since September, another aggressive attempt to get into Adobe ColdFusion\nvulnerable servers was observed which for now, are not yet used for any malicious purposes. Security\nresearchers believe that these will be used for staging phase as watering-hole or delivering spearphishing attacks[121]. On the other hand, in March 2018 the group behind Promethium (a.k.a\nStrongPity) had abused the deep packet inspection hardware, used by Turks telecom, redirecting\ncustomers in Turkey and Syria to download spyware[122].\n\n  - **New Financial malware with new web-based capability. During Q1 2018, Dridex made a return and**\nwas found to be more active as a financial malware with its script injection/redirect capability to steal\ncredentials. Emotet was observed delivering spam and financial malware payloads[123] while BackSwap\nappeared in Q2[124] with a more interesting technique - this banking trojan was observed using WinAPI\nto open the console of the developer mode and inject scripts in the page or browser by emulating\nkeystrokes.

Not surprisingly with the hype of cryptocurrencies, a Chrome Extension was identified\nby TrendMicro with multiple capabilities (FacexWorm - around April 2018) namely: injecting miners\n(.js), stealing credentials for crypto-trading platforms, hijacking transactions and hijacking traffic to\nattacker’s referral links (for crypto related referral programs)[127].\n\n  - **Content Management Systems (CMS) compromises on the rise. Early this year several attacks were**\nobserved against Drupal delivering browser-based cryptocurrency miners and social engineering\ntoolkits[128]. Later on, in September 2018, a wave of attacks was seen targeting Wordpress vulnerable\nwebsites[129] and related plugins, delivering multiple threats to the client-side (i.e. malicious JavaScript,\nmalicious code in the wp_posts table etc.).\n\n  - **The trend of web browser based (drive-by) exploit-kits is continuing. According to Malwarebytes**\nspring and summer report, the majority of exploit kits were observed in Asia. This might be related to\nthe continued use of Internet Explorer (Japan, South Korea) in this part of the world. Apart from\nknown browser type exploit-kits, researchers observed an increase in drive-by downloads labelled as\n“pseudo exploit-kits”. These type of exploit-kits typically miss a solid infrastructure and often result\nfrom a single malicious software developer/actor copy and pasting from leaked or POC-type\nexploits[130].\n\n###### 3.2.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - In the topic of browser type exploits, Internet Explorer (CVE-2018-8174) and Flash (CVE-2018-4878)\nhave been the most weaponised vulnerabilities for this type of web-based attacks[131].\n\n  - By Q2 2018:\n\n`o` A total of 351.913.075 unique malicious URLs were identified[132], representing an increase in the\n\nnumber of malicious URLs compared to Q1 totalling 282.807.433[133]. This is in contrast with the\nstats from 2017 Q1[134] and Q2[135] where the trend was showing a decrease over these quarters.\n\n`o` The US (45,87%), Netherlands (25,74%), Germany (5,33%) and France (4,92%) were the top four\n\nsource countries for web-based attacks[136], representing an increase not only for each country\ncompared to Q1 2018[137] but also to 2017[138] (figure 5).\n\n126 [https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/mega-browser-extension-hacked-google/, accessed November](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/mega-browser-extension-hacked-google/)\n2018.\n127 [https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/facexworm-targets-cryptocurrency-trading-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/facexworm-targets-cryptocurrency-trading-platforms-abuses-facebook-messenger-for-propagation/)\n[platforms-abuses-facebook-messenger-for-propagation/, accessed November 2018.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/facexworm-targets-cryptocurrency-trading-platforms-abuses-facebook-messenger-for-propagation/)\n128 [https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/09/mass-wordpress-compromises-tech-support-scams/,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/09/mass-wordpress-compromises-tech-support-scams/)\naccessed November 2018.\n129 [https://labs.sucuri.net/?note=2018-09-18, accessed November 2018.](https://labs.sucuri.net/?note=2018-09-18)\n130 [https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/08/exploit-kits-summer-2018-review/, accessed November](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/08/exploit-kits-summer-2018-review/)\n2018.\n131 [https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/10/exploit-kits-fall-2018-review/, accessed November](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/10/exploit-kits-fall-2018-review/)\n2018.\n132 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/)\n133 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2018-statistics/85541/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2018-statistics/85541/)\n134 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2017-statistics/78475/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2017-statistics/78475/)\n135 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2017-statistics/79432/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2017-statistics/79432/)\n136 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/)\n137 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2018-statistics/85541/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2018-statistics/85541/)\n138 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2017-statistics/79432/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2017-statistics/79432/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - According to G-Data security research[139] more attacks are web based. Although the number of attacks\nis fluctuating, they are becoming more targeted[140].\n\n_The overall trend of web-based attacks in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n**Figure 5: Web-Based Attack distribution by source Country (Q2, 2018)[141]**\n\n###### 3.2.4 Specific attack vectors \n\n  - **Browser exploits: are forms of malicious code that take advantage of a flaw or vulnerability in an**\noperating system or piece of software with the intent to breach the browser security by altering the\nsettings without the user’s knowledge. Malicious code may exploit ActiveX, HTML, images, Java,\nJavaScript, Flash and other Web technologies and cause the browser to run arbitrary code.\n\n  - **Drive-by downloads: is a common method of spreading malware as cybercriminals look for insecure**\nweb sites to plant a malicious script into HTTP or PHP code on one of the pages. This script may install\nmalware directly onto the computer of someone who visits the site, or it may take the form of an\nIFRAME that re-directs the victim to a site controlled by the cybercriminals. In many cases, the script\nis obfuscated, to make it more difficult for security researchers to analyse the code. Such attacks are\ncalled ‘drive-by downloads’ because they require no action from the victim — beyond simply visiting\nthe compromised web site: they are infected automatically (and silently) if their computer is\nvulnerable.\n\n  - **Malicious URL’s: are URL’s created with malicious purposes, among them, to download any type of**\nmalware to the affected systems, which can be contained in spam or phishing messages, or even\nimprove its position in search engines using Blackhat SEO techniques.\n\n139 [https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2018/09/31037-malware-figures-first-half-2018-danger-web, accessed](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2018/09/31037-malware-figures-first-half-2018-danger-web)\nNovember 2018.\n140 [https://www.symantec.com/security-center/publications/monthlythreatreport, accessed November 2018.](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/publications/monthlythreatreport)\n141 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - **Water-holing: Is a malware attack in which the attacker observes the websites often visited by a**\nvictim or a particular group and infects those sites with malware. A watering hole attack has the\npotential to infect the members of the targeted victim group using specific configurations for the\nmalware to be able to select the targets from the infected users (based on their IP for example).\n\n  - **Content Management System (CMS) Compromise. Although this category might be briefly touched**\nupon in other vectors, it is noteworthy that these types of compromise usually refers to plugins and\nfunctionalities on vulnerable system. Vulnerabilities that are subsequently exploited to deliver\nmalicious content/malware to the victim directly or indirectly by redirecting the victim to malicious\ncontent.\n\n###### 3.2.5 Specific mitigation actions\n\nThe mitigation vector for this threat type includes:\n\n  - Use web-traffic filtering to detect and block malicious payloads and destinations (IP’s, URL’s).\n\n  - Use web-traffic encryption technologies such as SSL/TLS.\n\n  - Update/patch web-browsers and web-server technologies and products regularly.\n\n  - Update/patch CMS based websites regularly (i.e. WordPress, Joomla or Drupal) and avoid the\nutilisation of third-party plugins (usually responsible for most of the attacks against CMS’s).\n\n  - Protect all endpoint systems from unpatched software containing known vulnerabilities.\n\n  - Avoid the installation of malicious programs through potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).\n\n  - Monitor the behaviour of software to detect malicious object, such as web browser plug-ins.\n\n  - Use web address, web content, files and applications reputation solutions, blacklisting and filtering to\nestablish risk-oriented categorization of web resources.\n\n  - Check the application and web-browser settings to avoid unwanted behaviour based on default\nsettings (esp. for mobile devices) to provide a more secure environment (i.e. disabling unused\nfeatures, extensions and plugins – particularly from untrusted/unverified sources).\n\n###### 3.2.6 Kill Chain \n\n**Figure 6: Position of web based attacks in kill-chain**\n\n###### 3.2.7 Authoritative references\n\n“IT Threat Evolution Q1 2018.

In other\nwords, the simple abuse of an active or passive component of a software available via web. Notably,\nthese types of attacks overlap with web-based quite often due the shared services on the application side\nand attack surface on the threat side. Web applications are becoming more interesting targets for\nadversaries as more businesses and firms are becoming dependent on web services, both in revenue and\nreputation. However, the trend of attacks during the reporting period shows a slight decrease in these\ntype of attacks[142]. Nevertheless, more firms are seeing what OWASP categorises as automated attacks[143]\nduring their first sixty day of appearance[144], showing more efficient and automated exploiting capabilities\non the adversary side. On the other side as web applications represent a large part of attacks on the\ninternet[145], enterprises and organisations are investing more on web applications detection, protection\nand defense systems in 2018, which presents a positive move in the industry[146].\n\n###### 3.3.2 Interesting points\n\n  - **SQL injection continues to lead the attacks types. SQLi attacks dominate the attack types in the web**\napplication category by 51% although they are one of the most understandable by both attackers and\ndefenders. This include targeted (and non-targeted) scanning activity, which can easily be hidden\nfrom the sight of defenders due to amount of noise generally caused.\n\n  - **Local File Inclusion and Cross-Site-Scripting count for the second and third most prominent attacks**\nwith 34% and 8% respectively of the attacks in the wild during summer 2018.\n\n  - **Orphan routes and APIs representing security blind spots. “Dead code”, also known as orphan**\nroutes/APIs are deprecated or abandoned parts of (web) applications with zero business purpose or\nvalue, in other words: “blind spots”. Thus, the increase in usage of APIs and the business\ninterconnectivity concepts affects the attack surface (cause by blind spots) to rise exponentially[147].\n\n  - **Fewer vulnerabilities observed for Finance, Retail and Healthcare. Although the number of critical**\nvulnerabilities in web apps grows year by year, White Hat security suggests that in 2018 less web\napplications were found with critical vulnerabilities comparing to 2017 which is potentially reflecting\nthe investment of these industries in application security area[148].\n\n142 [https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q3-2018.pdf, accessed](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q3-2018.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n143 [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications, accessed November](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications)\n2018.\n144 [https://info.tcell.io/hubfs/DemandGen_Content/Research%20Papers/tCell_wp-stateofsecurity-2018-web.pdf,](https://info.tcell.io/hubfs/DemandGen_Content/Research%20Papers/tCell_wp-stateofsecurity-2018-web.pdf)\naccessed November 2018.\n145 [https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/06/summer-soti---web-attacks.html, accessed November 2018.](https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/06/summer-soti---web-attacks.html)\n146 [https://cyber-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CyberEdge-2018-CDR.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://cyber-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CyberEdge-2018-CDR.pdf)\n147 [https://info.tcell.io/hubfs/DemandGen_Content/Research%20Papers/tCell_wp-stateofsecurity-2018-web.pdf,](https://info.tcell.io/hubfs/DemandGen_Content/Research%20Papers/tCell_wp-stateofsecurity-2018-web.pdf)\naccessed November 2018.\n148 [https://info.whitehatsec.com/rs/675-YBI-674/images/WhiteHatStatsReport2018.pd, accessed November 2018.](https://info.whitehatsec.com/rs/675-YBI-674/images/WhiteHatStatsReport2018.pd)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - **Legacy web application exploits are still among the top 20.

The trend remained almost the same\nsince Q2 2017 (33% and 9%) and somehow a slight decrease in SQLi attacks (with 36%) if we want to\ncompare the trend to Q4 2017[152].\n\n  - According to a research by Edgescan team over vulnerability exposures and taxonomies: 29% of web\napplication vulnerabilities were associated with insecure configuration/deployments, 24% were\nclient-side related (i.e. XSS), 20% information leakage (i.e. default pages), 12% injections (i.e. SQLi),\n6% authentication (i.e. CSRF), 5% authorisation weaknesses (i.e. file path traversals), 3% exposed\ninterfaces (i.e. APIs) and 1% denial of services[153].\n\n  - Web Application attacks dominated the trend in EMEA regardless of source with 42% among the\nother attack types in 2018. Moreover, this type of attack is often linked to major data breaches\nworldwide[154].\n\n  - The United States continued to lead the chart based on the web application attack source by 30,1% (\nca. 238 million attacks/alerts) and the Netherlands by 11,9% ( ca. 94 million attacks/alerts).\nSubsequently China, Brazil and Russia each contributing with 7,1%, 6,2% and 4,4% were the major\nattack sources geographically speaking in the first half of 2018[155]. These are relatively close figures to\nweb application attack during Q4 2017.\n\n  - During Q3 2018, 1.114 detections were reported per firm in the topic of web application attacks\nraising the overall index by 2%. However, 65,4% of the firms reported a severe malicious attempts\n(web) which is a 6,6% decrease comparing to same period in 2017 (79% Q3 2017[156] and 72% in Q4\n2017[157])[158].\n\n149 [https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q3-2018.pdf, accessed](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q3-2018.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n150 [https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/06/summer-soti---web-attacks.html, accessed November 2018.](https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/06/summer-soti---web-attacks.html)\n151 [https://www.akamai.com/de/de/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q2-2017-state-of-the-internet-](https://www.akamai.com/de/de/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q2-2017-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf)\n[security-report.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.akamai.com/de/de/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q2-2017-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf)\n152 [https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q4-2017-state-of-the-internet-](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q4-2017-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf)\n[security-report.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q4-2017-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf)\n153 [https://www.edgescan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/edgescan-stats-report-2018.pdf, accessed November](https://www.edgescan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/edgescan-stats-report-2018.pdf)\n2018.\n154 [https://www.nttsecurity.com/docs/librariesprovider3/resources/gbl-ntt-security-2018-global-threat-intelligence-](https://www.nttsecurity.com/docs/librariesprovider3/resources/gbl-ntt-security-2018-global-threat-intelligence-report-v2-uea.pdf?sfvrsn=c761dd4d_10)\n[report-v2-uea.pdf?sfvrsn=c761dd4d_10, accessed November 2018.](https://www.nttsecurity.com/docs/librariesprovider3/resources/gbl-ntt-security-2018-global-threat-intelligence-report-v2-uea.pdf?sfvrsn=c761dd4d_10)\n155 [https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/06/summer-soti---web-attacks.html, accessed November 2018.](https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/06/summer-soti---web-attacks.html)\n156 [https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/Threat-Report-Q3-2017.pdf, accessed](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/Threat-Report-Q3-2017.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n157 [https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q4-2017.pdf, accessed](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q4-2017.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n158 [https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q3-2018.pdf, accessed](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/threat-report-q3-2018.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n_The overall trend for web application attacks in 2018 is STABLE._\n\n###### 3.3.4 Top Web Application Attacks\n\nSimilar to the trend in 2016 and 2017, this year the top 5 web app attacks are Injection (SQLi, PHPi), Local\nFile Inclusion (LFI), cross-site scripting (XSS) and Remote File Inclusion with SQL injections on the top –\nfigure 7.\n\n**Figure 7: Web application attacks in 2018[159]**\n\n###### 3.3.5 Specific mitigation actions\n\nThe mitigation vectors for this threat type are recommended as below:\n\n  -

More specifically, phishers try to lure the recipients of phishing\nemails and messages to open a malicious attachment, click on an unsafe URL, hand over their credentials\nvia legitimate looking phishing pages, wire money, etc. Phishing is the preferred way of compromising\norganisations[179] and it has been reported that 75% of EU’s Member States disclosed cases of phishing[241].\nPhishing is so heavily leveraged that over 90% of malware infections and 72% of data breaches in\norganisations originate from phishing attacks[334].\n\n###### 3.4.2 Interesting points\n\n  - **Phishing attacks became more targeted. It is reported that while the traditional spam-related**\nphishing still exists, the number of targeted phishing attacks continue to grow[411]. The volumes of\nhacked and leaked personal data give the opportunity for phishers to conduct convincing and\ntargeted phishing campaigns[162] at scale (e.g. targeted sextortion scams[163]). Organised criminal groups\nalso target rich individuals, people with access to financial accounts or sensitive business data or even\npublic authorities that handle PII related data[428] (PII is becoming a juicy target in the age of GDPR). We\nassess that this trend will continue and phishing attacks will become increasingly targeted in the\nfuture.\n\n160 [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls, accessed Nov 2018.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls)\n161 [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide, accessed Nov](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide)\n2018.\n162 [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/the-year-targeted-phishing-went-mainstream/, accessed October 2018.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/the-year-targeted-phishing-went-mainstream/)\n163 [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/, accessed October](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/)\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- **Shift from consumer to enterprise targets. While phishers mostly targeted consumers during the**\nprevious years, an evolution has been observed that malicious actors are focusing on enterprise\ntargets[241]. This significant shift in threat actor motivations is profit-driven since enterprise data can be\nleveraged in multiple and more profitable ways compared to consumer data (e.g. extortion, selling\ndata in underground marketplaces, etc.)[421]. This trend also aligned with the fact that, email services\n(e.g. Microsoft O365[164]) and online services (e.g. DocuSign[165] and Dropbox[166]) were the top phishing\ntarget (26%) for first time above financial institutions (21%)[421].\n\n- **Steady growth in mobile phishing attacks. Phishing attacks on mobile devices have grown by an**\naverage of 85% year-over-year since 2011[167]. Mobile devices give opportunities for cyber criminals to\nutilize more attack vectors instead of email phishing. It has been observed that phishing via SMS,\nmobile messaging (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc.) and social media apps (e.g. Instagram) has\ngrown significantly[167]. More specifically, phishing of social media users has tripled during 2017 with\nphishers exploiting the inherent trust relationship between users and the social media platforms[421]. A\nnew mobile attack method has been appeared (URL padding) that takes advantage of the small screen\nsize of mobile phones[421]. Finally, during the reporting period, we observed advanced threat actors\nusing mobile phishing techniques e.g. Dark Caracal[168] and Pegasus[169]. We assess that due to the attack\nsurface that mobile devices provide as well as the increasing adoption of 2-factor authentication,\nphishing attacks against mobile devices will continue to evolve in sophistication and increase in\noccurrence.\n\n- **Rapid increase in phishing sites using HTTPS. It has been reported that one third of phishing web**\nsites have been served via HTTPS during 2017 compared to 5% during 2016[421,454,170]. During the\nreporting period it was observed that, phishers are shifting techniques and used free certificate\nservices (e.g. Let’s Encrypt[171] or Comodo[172]) to challenge the misconception that, sites using HTTPS\nare secure, safe and trustworthy. This shift follows the trend with the Internet’s wider adoption of\nHTTPS[173] and the fact that some browsers are starting to flag HTTP sites as “Not Secure”[174]. We expect\nthat the usage of HTTPS for phishing sites will continue to grow.\n\n- **The problem of Business Email Compromise (BEC)[241]. BEC is a type of phishing attack (also known as**\nwhaling) targeting C-level executives and employees in finance or human resources aiming to steal\nmoney from their organisations. From October 2013 to May 2018, ca. 78.000 BEC attacks have been\nreported worldwide responsible for US $12,5 billion of reported losses[175]. During the reporting period,\nthe majority of BEC attacks have targeted the real estate sector[175] (fraud cases happening during the\nproperty transaction) as well as employees working in human resources[334]. Due to the fact that 65%\nof Member States have observed BEC phishing attacks[241], this type of crime has gain the attention of\n\n164 [https://www.cbronline.com/news/microsoft-office-365-phishing, accessed October 2018.](https://www.cbronline.com/news/microsoft-office-365-phishing)\n165 [https://www.docusign.com/trust/alerts, accessed October 2018.](https://www.docusign.com/trust/alerts)\n166 [https://www.psafe.com/en/blog/dropbox-phishing-attacks-are-on-the-rise/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.psafe.com/en/blog/dropbox-phishing-attacks-are-on-the-rise/)\n167 [https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/Lookout-Phishing-wp-us.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/Lookout-Phishing-wp-us.pdf)\n168 [https://www.lookout.com/info/ds-dark-caracal-ty, accessed October 2018.](https://www.lookout.com/info/ds-dark-caracal-ty)\n169 [https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/)\n[canadian-soil/, accessed October 2018.](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/)\n170 [https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q1_2018.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q1_2018.pdf)\n171 [https://letsencrypt.org/, accessed October 2018.](https://letsencrypt.org/)\n172 [https://ssl.comodo.com/free-ssl-certificate.php, accessed October 2018.](https://ssl.comodo.com/free-ssl-certificate.php)\n173 [https://letsencrypt.org/stats/, accessed October 2018.](https://letsencrypt.org/stats/)\n174 [https://blog.chromium.org/2018/05/evolving-chromes-security-indicators.html, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/05/evolving-chromes-security-indicators.html)\n175 [https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180712.aspx, accessed October 2018.](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180712.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nlaw enforcement with successful arrests and takedown of fraud schemes[176,177,178].

It is reported that 71% of APT groups**\nhave used spearphishing as infection vector[248]. During the reporting period, the most high profile\norganised crime groups were FIN7[180,181] and Cobalt Group[182]. Furthermore, nation state actors still use\nspearphishing as their primary infection vector for their espionage and disruption operations[183,184].\n\n- **Trends in malicious attachments. During 2017, phishers used 28% more malicious attachments**\ncompared to malicious URLs within phishing emails[183]. The most common malicious file types in\nphishing emails were Microsoft Office documents, archive files, JavaScript files, Visual Basic Scripts\nand PDFdocuments [248,193,334]. Phishers also used some new types of malicious attachments and some\nthat were used in new ways[185]: .arj (“Archived by Robert Jung”[186]), .z (GNU Gzip[187]), .iqy (Internet\nQuery Files[188,189]), and .pdf[190] files. Legitimate platform features have also been exploited with most\nnotable the Microsoft Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)[191].

This indicates the effectiveness of security\nawareness campaigns within organisations.\n\n  - Vishing was mostly reported within the financial sector while it was only one third of the EU Member\nStates reporting this type of attack[ 241].\n\n  - Social media phishing has increased by 200% from 2016 to 2017. Social media accounts are useful for\nphishers as they can be leveraged to conduct further cybercrime activities[421].\n\n_The overall trend of phishing attacks in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n###### 3.4.4 Top Phishing Themes\n\nGiven the nature of phishing, top phishing artefacts are characterised by topics addressed by phishing\nmessages.

They\nshould also internally launch simulated phishing campaigns to test both their infrastructure and the\nresponsiveness of their staff.\n\n  - Use a security email gateway with regular (possibly automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam,\nanti-malware, policy-based filtering).\n\n  - Consider applying security solutions that use machine learning techniques to identify phishing sites in\nreal time.\n\n  - Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at the\nemail clients and update them frequently.\n\n  - SPF (Sender Policy Framework)[202], DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &\nConformance)[203] and DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)[204] are the three email security standards for\nthe reduction in spam. Relevant implementation of the aforementioned standards should be\ndeployed in the organisations.\n\n  - Implement a fraud and anomaly detection system at network level for both inbound and outbound.\n\n  - Ensure that users do not click on links or download attachments if you are not absolutely confident\nabout the source of an email.\n\n  - Ensure that users do not click on random links and especially short-links found in social media.\n\n  - Avoid the over-sharing of personal information in social media, e.g. time of absence from office or\nhome, flight information etc. as it is actively used by threat actors to collect information about\ntargets.\n\n  - Check the domain name of the websites you visit for typos, especially for sensitive websites, e.g. bank\nwebsites. Threat actors usually register fake domains that look similar to legitimate ones and use\nthem to “phish” their targets. Looking only for an https connection is not enough.\n\n  - Enable two factor-authentication whenever applicable. Two factor-authentication can prevent\naccount takeover.\n\n  - Use strong and unique password for every online service. Re-using the same password in various\nservices is a serious security issue and should be avoided at all times. Using strong and unique\ncredentials in every online service limits the risk of a potential account takeover to the affected\n\n202 [http://www.openspf.org/, accessed October 2018.](http://www.openspf.org/)\n203 [https://dmarc.org/, accessed October 2018.](https://dmarc.org/)\n204 [http://www.dkim.org/, accessed October 2018.](http://www.dkim.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nservice only. The use of a password manager software would make the managing of the whole set of\npasswords easier.\n\n  - In case of wiring money to an account, double-check the bank information of the recipient through a\ndifferent medium. Unencrypted and unsigned emails should not be trusted, especially for sensitive\nuse-cases like these.\n\n  - Implement multiple controls (including two-factor authentication) for critical financial transactions.\n\n###### 3.4.6 Kill Chain\n\n**Figure 10: Position of phishing in the kill chain**\n\n###### 3.4.7 Authoritative references\n\n“Trend & Intelligence Report 2018”, PhishLabs; “The Human Factor 2018”, Proofpoint; “Internet Security\nThreat Report 23” Symantec; “Spam and phishing in Q1 2018”, Kaspersky; “Spam and phishing in Q2\n2018”, Kaspersky; “Phishing Activity Trends Report 1Q 2018”, APWG.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### Denial of Service\n\n 3.5.1 Description of the cyberthreat\n\n(Distributed) Denial of Services is one of the highly impactful threats in cyber landscape that has been\ntargeting almost any business or organisation. It has been quite clear that preserving a solid defence for\nsuch threat has become extensively important for different organisations. According to Arbor Networks,\nthe strong demand for mitigation services provided by managed service providers in this field is notable\nwith financial services, e-commerce, cloud providers and governments on the top[205]. Also, Law\nenforcement activities in this realm have played a key role for fighting against such malicious activities by\nrunning operations to take down services like “webstressor.org”[206] during the first half of 2018. Although\nthis has been a great achievement, DDoS for hire services like this are not few and still the landscape is\nseeing activities with similar characteristics. On the other side the increase in the number of connected\nservices globally and their dependency on the Internet of Things (IOTs) to run and facilitate such services\nraised concerns over threats like DoS attacks to potentially cause nation wide failures for businesses and\ncritical systems. One example of such services is the concept of connected hospitals and related\nservices[207]. Yet with all the mitigation and preventative activities across the world reports and researches\nsuggest that the number of DDoS activities are on the rise (16% increase). Although we might not be\nobserving too many large attacks[208].\n\n###### 3.5.2 Interesting points\n\n  - **BCP38 and DDoS. Activities and research[209] on Implementing ingress traffic filtering to avoid IP-**\naddress spoofing in ISPs has been seen as a positive approach from different organisations and\ngovernment entities (i.e. NCSC UK). This approach prevents the ISPs infrastructure to be part of\n(generate) DDoS attacks which are facilitating the spoofed-IP technique[210].\n\n  - **Internet of connected Services. More organisations are depending on technologies and accordingly**\nhigher demand for connected services and information. Multiple reports emphasise the fact that APIs\nare becoming a popular attack surface for malicious actor in order to interrupt services in different\norganisations[211]. Also, researchers in CERT-EU predicted that health organisations are at risk of denial\nof service due to the same concept (connected hospitals with 80.000 publicly available medical\ndevices).\n\n  - **DDoS and geo-politics landscape. In Mexico a presidential candidate’s website (Ricardo Anaya) was**\nunder a DDoS attack while he was running a television debate.

During April 2018, law enforcement agencies from the US and UK announced that\nthey have identified a considerable number of infected devices (in EU, US and Australia) attributed\nand ran by Russian hackers ready to run state sponsored attacks. Just in matter of days a website\nowned by a Russian political party (United Russia) went down for two days by a DDoS campaign[212].\n\n- **Largest reflection-amplification attacks – Still on the rise. GitHub became a victim of a 1.35Tbps**\n(126.9 million pps) amplified DDoS attack[213]. The attack was originating from different autonomous\nsystems misusing memcached services (UDP port 11211). Five days after that incident, on 5[th] of\nMarch 2018 Arbor networks announced[214] a 1.7Tbps attack targeting a US service provider facilitating\nthe same memcached technique. Interesting enough since the first incident on GitHub the number of\nvulnerable memcached servers was cited publicly as 17000 and only 500 were remained vulnerable by\nJune 2018.\n\n- **Filtering at the Service provider level will help the defenders. Researchers at akamai believe that**\ndeploying few strategies at the telecoms or service provider lever will block a good amount of DDoS\nattacks at the source and prevent the ongoing infection on the customer side of ISPs. For instance,\nblocking DNS based C&C communication queries of a botnet (i.e. Necrus) in the provider’s network\ncan ideally prevent the complete DDoS functionality of that botnet. Other strategies like securing\ncloud assets and keeping residential address space clean were proposed[215].\n\n- **One of many DDoS for hire services taken down (Operation Power-Off). With the rise in providing**\nsuch services the price for running individual DDoS attacks was found to be as small as US $5. Thus\nmore frequent attacks leads to a better business for the malicious service provider. Not surprisingly\nthe price varies based on different capabilities of the service such as parallel attacks, limits per day\nand different vectors to flood the target with[216]. April 2018, the United Kingdom’s major law\nenforcement agency (National Crime Agency) along with the Dutch crime unit (Dutch National High\nTech Crime Unit) took down a major DDoS platform known as “webstresser.org” hosting more than\n136,000 users. It was reported that 4 to 6 million attacks worldwide were initiated using this\nplatform[217].\n\n  - **Multi-Vector DDoS attacks were observed with different characteristics. As mentioned above,**\nDDoS-for-hire is among the most popular services. Due to its nature, time constraint is one of the\nmain characteristics of these services. Akamai reported a specific attack series targeting DNS\nservers of the organisation for almost 2 days intermittently which also included another vector\n(PSH/ACK - TCP based) peaking at 120 Gbps (18.6Mpps). Additionally, a young malicious actor\nintroduced a set of traffic generators in a YouTube tutorial peaking at 170 Gbps (65Mpps).

The frequency though decreased by\n13%.\n\n_The overall trend of denial of service attacks in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n###### 3.5.4 Top 5 DDoS attacks\n\n  - **Memcached (reflected) amplification attacks. A legitimate service which is developed for handling a**\ndistributed memory caching system (using UDP) can be easily exploited to reflect the traffic to target\nwith an amplification factor of 50.000 times of the original request.\n\n  - **Multi target DDoS. When the attackers are not seeing the desired impact on their target they tend to**\nextend their impact to the wider network range to have a more distributed impact and potentially\nkeep the defence teams busier. This methodology was observed by facilitating multiple DDoS vectors\n(i.e. SYN floods, amplification and application layer) targeting the entire /24 subnet.\n\n  - **Cache Busting DDoS. In this type of attack the malicious actor aims to bypass the application’s**\ncaching capability by sending random (or not recognizable) GET requests to flood the application\nserver with requests to handle.\n\n  - **Persistent DDoS Attacks (i.e. multi-day). This type of DDoS is famous for its two stages of infecting**\nhosts and creating botnet of zombies who pretend to be a well defended endpoint and the attack\nphase that has been seen to take from minutes to over multiple days. The vector varies from network\ntype attacks to application layer attacks[235].\n\n  - **Encrypted Attacks. The rise of using encrypted services and traffic (SSL) on the web has attracted**\ndifferent levels of DDoS attacks. This includes attacks on the application level (flood attacks,\nbruteforce etc.), network level and the protocol level (i.e. SSL renegotiation or downgrade) making it\nharder for defenders and toolsets to recognise malicious traffic from legitimate[236].\n\n###### 3.5.5 Specific attack vectors \n\nAccording to Nexusgaurd Q2 2018 report, most of the attacks were focused on hit-run tactics and\nspecifically during peak times to strike their targets with UDP, TCP (SYN) and ICMP floods being the top 3\nvectors. The duration of these malicious attempts were mostly recorded as lasting less than 90 minutes\nand the longest to more than 6 days.\n\n[234https://www.ipexpoeurope.com/content/download/13783/181390/file/NETSCOUT_ThreatReport_FINAL_080618](https://www.ipexpoeurope.com/content/download/13783/181390/file/NETSCOUT_ThreatReport_FINAL_080618b.pdf)\nb.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n235 [https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2018/5353060/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2018/5353060/)\n236 [https://www.link11.com/en/blog/ssl-ddos-attacks-and-how-to-defend-against-them/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.link11.com/en/blog/ssl-ddos-attacks-and-how-to-defend-against-them/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Figure 12: DDoS Attack vectors, Q2 2018[237]**\n\n###### 3.5.6 Specific mitigation actions\n\n  - Assess the requirements for considering DDoS managed services (either through internet service\nprovider or directly)\n\n  - Promote the appropriate use (implementation, detection, update) of different defence technologies\nlike firewalls, web application firewalls, IPS/IDS systems, network flow, Access Control Lists and\nIntelligent DDoS mitigation tools or services on the network (perimeter, cloud or hybrid)[238].\n\n  - Remediate the information leakages related to the infrastructure (leak path) helping defenders\nreducing or even preventing a potential attack[239].\n\n  - Promote proactive activities by the provider to filter and clean their infrastructure playing a key role\nin preventing impactful denial of service attempts.

During the last years spam has evolved, (i.e. spam via social media and messengers) and it is\nassessed that it will continue to be used[241]. Spam is regarded a threat because of its low cost to send\nmessages while it is time consuming and costly for spam recipients and service providers in terms of\nnetwork bandwidth and storage. The good news here is that, the coordinated law enforcement activities\nfor botnet takedowns and the advances in anti-spam technologies have resulted in lowering the spam\nnumbers during the last years.\n\n###### 3.6.2 Interesting points\n\n  - **Consistent decrease in spam activity during the past decade. During the past decade, a consistent**\ndecrease in spam activity has been observed. This could be attributed to the efforts of law\nenforcement as well as the changing economics for the underground spamming ecosystem[242].\n\n**Figure 14: Spam as a percentage of total inbound email[242]**\n\n  - **Stable spam rate activity during the past 12 months. Based on the statistics of the total number of**\ndaily emails compared to the total number of daily spam emails during the past 12 months, the spam\nrate is almost stable as can be seen in the figure below[243]:\n\n241 [https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2018)\n[iocta-2018, accessed October 2018.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2018)\n242 [https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Library/Documents/2018-Trustwave-Global-Security-Report/, accessed](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Library/Documents/2018-Trustwave-Global-Security-Report/)\nOctober 2018.\n243 [https://www.talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep#global-volume, accessed October 2018.](https://www.talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep#global-volume)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Figure 15: Total number of daily emails vs total number of daily spam emails (in billions)[243]**\n\n- **Necurs is the top spamming botnet. 88%[249] of spam comes from botnets and the top 3 spamming**\nbotnets are: Necurs, Gamut and Cutwail[244]. During 2016 and 2017, spam-borne malware comes\nalmost entirely from Necurs[242] and it is reported that 75%[244] to 97%[245] of total spam comes from\nNecurs. During 2017, Necurs has sent out almost 15 million emails in total while it has sent ca. 67.000\nemails per day in the second half of 2017[248]. Necurs operates in shorts bursts of heavy spamming that\nare followed by dormant periods[242]. During its periods of full activity, the botnet sends spam from ca.\n200.000 to ca. 4.000.000 unique IP addresses daily[242]. Although a decrease in Necurs activity has been\nobserved, the start-and-stop nature of Necurs makes it difficult to make safe conclusions about\npotential decrease in the size of the botnet or actual decrease in its activity[242].\n\n- **Spam via messengers and social networks. It has been reported that spammers have been using**\nWhatsApp to distribute their content (mostly fictional lotteries, airplane ticket giveaways, popular\nretailers, etc.)[250]. Social networks are also abused to deliver spamming content via fake celebrity and\ncompany accounts, viral threads or even via the advertising mechanisms offered by the social\nnetwork[250]. A recent survey reported that 47% of social media users are seeing more spam in their\nfeeds[246] (79% of which believe that spam content on social media includes fake news).\n\n- **GDPR-themed spam. A large number of GDPR-themed spam emails have been observed during the**\nfirst quarter of 2018[247]. This spam activity included mostly paid seminars, webinars and workshops\nrelated to the new EU’s privacy regulation.\n\n- **Larger organisations have higher spam rates. It has been reported that, during 2017, employees of**\nlarge organisations receive more spam emails compared to the employees of smaller ones[248].\n\n244 [https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-jun-2018.pdf, accessed October](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-jun-2018.pdf)\n2018.\n245 [https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-mar-2018.pdf, accessed](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-mar-2018.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n246 [https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-users-seeing-more-spam, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-users-seeing-more-spam)\n247 [https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-q1-2018/85650/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-q1-2018/85650/)\n248 [https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-23-2018-en.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-23-2018-en.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - **Spam is getting more “international”. While one year ago 96% of the spam was in English, the levels**\nof spam in English have fallen to 90%[249]. This indicates a trend that spam is getting more\n“international” and localized.\n\n  - **Double email headers. During the second quarter of 2018, spammers tried to tamper the email**\nheader in order to evade filtering[250]. More specifically, they used two “From” fields in the email\nheader: a first email address from a well-known organization that has undoubtedly good reputation\nand subsequently, their real email address. The goal of spammers was to fool the email filters and to\nbe perceived as legitimate. However, modern anti-spam solutions can detect spam emails not only\nbased on the header details but also based on content.\n\n  - **Abuse of subscription forms for spamming. Another interesting technique that spammers used**\nduring the reporting period was the abuse of the subscription forms. Spammers used a script that\nauto-filled subscription forms of regular websites and inserted the target email address in the “Email”\nform as well as a short message with a spam link in the form of the “Name”. Thus, the targets\nreceived an automatic “list subscription” confirmation email that contained a spam link instead of\ntheir name. Spammers wanted to fool email filters since usually the content of “list subscription”\nconfirmation emails is normally allowed.\n\n  - **Common spam types. 75% of spam emails is comprised of the following 3 categories: health related**\nspam (26,6%), spam delivering malware (25,7%) and spam for online dating sites(21,4%)[242]. Following\nspam types include: stock spam (4,6%), phony job offers (3,5%), phishing spam (2,1%), financial spam\n(1,9%), adult spam (1,5%), etc.[242].\n\n  - **Spam gangs. It is reported that 80% of the spam targeting Internet users is coming from 100**\npersistent spam gangs[251]. Top spam gangs include: Canadian Pharmacy, Blaze Media Solutions,\nPredictLabs, Guangzhou-Seoul Information Technology Co. and RR Media.\n\n###### 3.6.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - Spam emails from webmail services are not very common as only 0,7% of spam is sent from webmail\naccounts like Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail[249].\n\n  - Spam emails are small in size since 40% of spam emails were 2Kb in size[252].\n\n  - The Mining, Construction and Manufacturing sectors had the highest spam rate during 2017[248].\n\n  - The average daily spam volume is 295,62 billion, while the average daily legitimate email volume is\n51,18 billion[243]. Thus, legitimate email volume is 14,76% of the total email volume while spam volume\nis 85,23% of the total email volume.\n\n  - The Top Level Domains (TLDs) that are the riskiest and spammy-est on the Internet are the following:\n.gq, .cf, .loan, .tk, .ml, .ga, .men, .faith, .top and .racing[253,254].\n\n_The overall trend of spam attacks in 2018 is STABLE._\n\n249 [https://antispamengine.com/spam-statistics/, accessed October 2018.](https://antispamengine.com/spam-statistics/)\n250 [https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-q2-2018/87368/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-q2-2018/87368/)\n251 [https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/spammers/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/spammers/)\n252 [https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-2017/83833/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-2017/83833/)\n253 [https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/)\n254 [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/bad-men-at-work-please-dont-click/, accessed October 2018.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/bad-men-at-work-please-dont-click/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.6.4 Top Spam sources\n\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n22.62%\n\n12.11%11.12%\n\n4.42% 4.34% 3.98% 3.88% 3.46% 3.18% 2.43%\n\n**Figure 16: Top 10 sources of spam by country[250]**\n\n###### Number of spamming bots by country\n\n**Figure 17: Top 10 countries with spamming bots[255]**\n\n\n###### 3.6.5 Specific mitigation actions\n\nThe mitigation measures for spam and spam-based threats are the following:\n\n  - Use a security email gateway with regular (possibly automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam, antimalware, policy-based filtering).\n\n255 [https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/botnet-cc/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/botnet-cc/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - Disable the automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at\nthe email clients and update them frequently.\n\n  - Implement SPF (Sender Policy Framework)[256], DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication,\nReporting & Conformance)[257] and DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)[258] email security standards for\nthe reduction of spam.\n\n  - Implement reputation filters, content filters, RBL (Real-time Blackhole List) and other measures.\n\n  - Use AI and specifically machine learning and anomaly detection techniques.\n\n  - Educate users, e.g. to ask themselves, e.g. if they know the sender, if they feel comfortable with the\nattachment content and type, if they recognize the subject matter of the mail, etc.\n\n  - The most important threat (impostor email) is still the most difficult to identify and mitigate as it does\nnot rely on technical means but rather on social-engineering, and the abuse of the inherent trust in a\nknown email partner. Therefore, user awareness and training is the first step in fighting it. In that\nrespect, there are training services that mimic tactics used by malicious actors.

From Necurs\nand Gamut covering almost 97% of the spam related attacks[259] to the variation of IoT related botnets,\nsocial media[260] and ads, which were driving sales for botnets[261]. On a different note, although the Mirai\ncreators were arrested[262], its technique and source code inspired many other actors to take the same\napproach and build more sophisticated IoT botnets. Tori-bot is one of the good examples with 6 different\npersistency techniques targeting multiple architectures. Another interesting trend in 2018 was the\nupdates and patches, which were delivered to these botnets for enhanced functionalities like VpnFilter\nand Hide and Seek botnets. In addition to these credential stuffing/reusing attacks saw a dramatic\nincrease according to Akamai’s September report. Below we will briefly cover interesting points and\ntrends of 2018 followed by top attacks and mitigation techniques.\n\n###### 3.7.2 Interesting points \n\nThe identified interesting points for botnets are as follows:\n\n  - **Another face of Necurs. For more than 6 years[263] since its existence, Necurs has shown different faces**\nfrom delivering sophisticated banking malware to huge spam campaigns. Since September 11, IBM XForce spamtraps caught new cyber extortion campaign from Necurs aimed at blackmailing users who\nare supposedly watching adult content[264].\n\n  - **Fbot tracking Crypto mining Botnets. Since September 2018, researchers from Netlab observed a**\nnew botnet activity with three specific interesting characteristics: aimed at removing crypto mining\nrelated malware/botnets, using blockchain based DNS to resolve C2s and quite bounded to the\noriginal Satori botnet[265].\n\n  - **Torii IOT botnet. Different from the Mirai and other Mirai-inspired botnets, Tori-bot keeps**\npersistency by using 6 different techniques without providing any typical services like DDoS or cryptomining (at least not yet). However, it provides a modular architecture for retrieving and executing\ncommands and exfiltration capabilities as well as multi-layered encrypted communication\nmechanism. It also targets multiple computer architectures (x86_64, x86, ARM, MIPS, Motorola 68k,\nSuperH, PPC etc.)[266].\n\n259 [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/necurs-and-gamut-botnets-account-for-97-percent-of-the-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/necurs-and-gamut-botnets-account-for-97-percent-of-the-internets-spam-emails/)\n[internets-spam-emails/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/necurs-and-gamut-botnets-account-for-97-percent-of-the-internets-spam-emails/)\n260 [https://www.hackread.com/hackers-selling-fortnite-accounts-botnet-on-instagram/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.hackread.com/hackers-selling-fortnite-accounts-botnet-on-instagram/)\n261 [https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pop-up-ads-and-over-a-hundred-sites-are-helping-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pop-up-ads-and-over-a-hundred-sites-are-helping-distribute-botnets-cryptocurrency-miners-and-ransomware/)\n[distribute-botnets-cryptocurrency-miners-and-ransomware/, accessed November 2018.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pop-up-ads-and-over-a-hundred-sites-are-helping-distribute-botnets-cryptocurrency-miners-and-ransomware/)\n262 [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/mirai-iot-botnet-co-authors-plead-guilty/, accessed November 2018.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/mirai-iot-botnet-co-authors-plead-guilty/)\n263 [https://securityintelligence.com/the-necurs-botnet-a-pandoras-box-of-malicious-spam/, accessed November](https://securityintelligence.com/the-necurs-botnet-a-pandoras-box-of-malicious-spam/)\n2018.\n264 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0)\n[fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0, accessed November 2018.](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0)\n265 [https://blog.netlab.360.com/threat-alert-a-new-worm-fbot-cleaning-adbminer-is-using-a-blockchain-based-dns-](https://blog.netlab.360.com/threat-alert-a-new-worm-fbot-cleaning-adbminer-is-using-a-blockchain-based-dns-en/)\nen/, accessed November 2018.\n266 [https://blog.avast.com/new-torii-botnet-threat-research, accessed November 2018.](https://blog.avast.com/new-torii-botnet-threat-research)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- **Chalubo botnet. Sophos researchers identified the activity of another Linux-based botnet in their**\nhoneypots trying to brute-force SSH to gain access. After the infection, the bot (Lua script) seems to\nbe focusing mostly on DDoS attacks (DNS, UDP and SYN floods).\n\n- **Botnets Updated: VpnFilter, a multistage and modular botnet originally developed to target the**\nModbus protocol, receive an update. Partially attributed to Fancy Bear[267], this botnet presents 7 new\nfeatures including: network discovery, larger coverage on endpoint exploitation and obfuscating the\nsource of the attack. Researchers found this botnet infecting Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, TP-Link and\nQNAP NAS network devices[268]. In addition to VPNFilter updates, Hide and Seek (HNS), which was\ninitially found targeting IP cameras[269], also received an update to cover android devices by exploiting\nAndroid Debug Bridge (ADB), similar to the Fbot botnet[270]. It is noteworthy that devices manufactured\nin Taiwan, China and Korea are typically distributed with this functionality enabled. For more\ninformation on multistage and modular threats, please consult chapter 5.5.\n\n- **Botnets and credential reuse attacks. Researchers at Akamai reported that in 2018 (between May-**\nJune) 8,3 billion malicious login attempts using automated bots were identified. The main objectives\nof these malicious attempts were to forge Identities, information gathering and capturing goods or\nmoney[271].\n\n- **Botnet to Lease. Renting out botnets was observed to be a reliable source for malicious actors to**\nmonetize their activities. Occasionally, these providers create some additional regular income by\nproviding extra support packages with their lease options. As an example, Blow-bot was seen costing\nUS $750 to US $1,200 based on the support and features needed[272].\n\n- **Social Media, a platform to run and advertise botnets. It has been reported that, different profiles on**\nInstagram are selling access to many IoT type botnets along with stolen or compromised data.\nAlthough this trend was mostly common on fraud and money laundry activities, now it seems that\nmalicious actors are turning to these platforms due to huge coverage of potential customers with\nminimal content moderation[273]. On the other hand, Proofpoint researchers investigated a botnet that\nwas misusing an old Facebook API and a third-party app to run spam campaigns. For instance,\ngathering likes and followers for Facebook branded posts and pages[274].\n\n- **Predictions made regarding botnets. Besides the above interesting points, some predictions**\nregarding botnets have been assessed in the reporting period. These are:\n\n267 [https://blog.avast.com/vpnfilter-malware-update-and-hide-seek-botnet-targets-android, accessed November](https://blog.avast.com/vpnfilter-malware-update-and-hide-seek-botnet-targets-android)\n2018.\n268 [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html, accessed November 2018.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\n269 [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-hns-iot-botnet-has-already-amassed-14k-bots/,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-hns-iot-botnet-has-already-amassed-14k-bots/)\naccessed November 2018.\n270 [https://blog.avast.com/vpnfilter-malware-update-and-hide-seek-botnet-targets-android, accessed November](https://blog.avast.com/vpnfilter-malware-update-and-hide-seek-botnet-targets-android)\n2018.\n271 [https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-attacks-report.pdf)\n[attacks-report.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-attacks-report.pdf)\n272 [https://cdn.armor.com/app/uploads/2018/03/27222933/2018-Q1-Reports-BlackMarket-DIGITAL-min.pdf,](https://cdn.armor.com/app/uploads/2018/03/27222933/2018-Q1-Reports-BlackMarket-DIGITAL-min.pdf)\naccessed November 2018.\n273 [https://www.hackread.com/hackers-selling-fortnite-accounts-botnet-on-instagram/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.hackread.com/hackers-selling-fortnite-accounts-botnet-on-instagram/)\n274 [https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-uk-tr-the-human-factor-2018.pdf, accessed November](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-uk-tr-the-human-factor-2018.pdf)\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n`o` _Swarmbots and hivenets. Recent reports predict that the evolution of botnets could be tied_\n\nclosely with swarm type of attacks[275], considering that these are scalable in architecture and\nautonomy. The concept of sharing collected intelligence between bots is to remove the\ndependency on the “bot master” or “bot herder”, to provide commands. This type of activity has\nthe potential to overwhelm the defence systems and teams by not only decreasing the time\nneeded for different stages of an attack by the attacker but, simultaneously attacking different\ndevices or infrastructure and exploiting vulnerabilities en-mass[276]. Hide and Seek botnet\nenhancements providing bidirectional commands in a peer-to-peer way is a small example of\nsuch capabilities.\n\n`o` _Blockchain and Botnets. Researchers at Fortinet predicted the usage of blockchain in Command_\n\nand Control (C2) communications in the near future due to the characteristics and cost effectivity\nof blockchain based communications. However, no sign of adoption of such methodology has\nbeen seen in the cybercriminal landscape[277].\n\n###### 3.7.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - In Q1 2018, the number and duration of DDoS attacks rose compared to Q4 2017 and Kaspersky\nresearchers believe that can be directly linked to 2 linux-based botnets known as Darkai and\nAESDDoS[278].\n\n  - The percentage of Linux-based botnet decreased slightly compared to Q4 2017 (from 71% to\n66%)[279].\n\n  - Regarding credential reuse in botnets, Akamai reported that each botnet is creating 300.000\nmalicious login attempts per hour with US, Russia and Vietnam as the top 3 sources of the\nattacks[280].\n\n  - According to McAfee’s September report, the United States is the top country for hosting botnet\ncontrol servers (36%) followed by Germany (14%) and Russia (5%) in the second and third\nplace[281].\n\n  - Gamut botnet by far was the dominant spam botnet in Q2 2018 with 86%. Most spams were\n“Canada Revenue Agency” followed by bogus job offers and money Mule.\n\n  - Source code of 7 variants of Mirai was leaked via a twitter handler in first half of 2018: Akiru,\nKatrina_V1, Sora, Owari, Saikin, Josho_V3, and Tokyo[282].\n\n275 [https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/rise-of-the--hivenet---botnets-that-think-for-themselves.html,](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/rise-of-the--hivenet---botnets-that-think-for-themselves.html)\naccessed November 2018.\n276 [https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n[predictions.html, accessed November 2018.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n277 [https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n[predictions.html, accessed November 2018.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n278 [https://securelist.com/ddos-report-in-q1-2018/85373/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/ddos-report-in-q1-2018/85373/)\n279 [https://securelist.com/ddos-report-in-q1-2018/85373/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/ddos-report-in-q1-2018/85373/)\n280 [https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-attacks-report.pdf)\n[attacks-report.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-attacks-report.pdf)\n281 [https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-sep-2018.pdf, accessed](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-sep-2018.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n282 [https://blog.avast.com/hacker-creates-seven-new-variants-of-the-mirai-botnet, accessed November 2018.](https://blog.avast.com/hacker-creates-seven-new-variants-of-the-mirai-botnet)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n_The overall trend of botnet attacks in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n###### 3.7.4 Top Botnet Attacks \n\n  - A new botnet was created in just one day by exploiting at least 18.000 Huawei routers using the old\nCVE-2017-17215 vulnerability. The code of this botnet was then used in Satori and Brickerbot botnets\nreportedly[283].\n\n  - Necurs 2018 activity represents its multiple faces: after a typical stream of spams, in August 2018 the\nNecurs botnet targets more than 3.701 banking domains[284]. During the same month, the botnet was\nobserved delivering Marap, which is a malware loader/dropper, to first fingerprint the infected device\nand then deliver the main malware at later stage, based on the objectives of the attack[285]. Later on, in\nSeptember it was observed delivering language targeted adult-related extortion scams[286], as reported\nby X-Force research team, in one instance it was seen sending 3 million messages to German\nrecipients[287]. Still one of the most dominant botnets.\n\n  - A credential reuse botnet attacked one fortune 500 financial services and made more than 8,5 million\nmalicious login attempts in just 48 hours, with a third of the traffic originated from Vietnam and the\nUnited States[288]. Also as previously mentioned, the general credential stuffing/reusing attacks\nbetween May and June 2018 were around 8.300 million attempts.\n\n###### 3.7.5 Specific attack vectors \n\nBotnets are unique in different ways when it comes to attack vectors. The infected machines (zombie\nnetworks) are created by exploiting common vulnerabilities, brute-forcing and other common infection\ntechniques. Furthermore, the “botnet herder” facilitates and provides a platform for different malicious\nattacks. Examples range from distributing spam, malware infections, credential reuse, crypto-mining and\nmost commonly DDoS.\n\n###### 3.7.6 Specific mitigation actions\n\nAs discussed Botnets are used in different types of attacks. DDoS attacks are a common scheme for usage\nof Botnets and we discussed the mitigation techniques in the chapter 3.5, describing the DDoS threat.\nMoreover, mitigation vectors for this threat include:\n\n  - Install and configure a network and application firewall.\n\n  - Perform traffic filtering to all relevant channels (web, network, mail).\n\n  - Install and maintain an IP address blacklist.\n\n283 [https://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-hacker-builds-huawei-based-botnet-using-18000-devices-in-one-day/,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-hacker-builds-huawei-based-botnet-using-18000-devices-in-one-day/)\naccessed November 2018.\n284 [https://cofense.com/necurs-targeting-banks-pub-file-drops-flawedammyy/, accessed November 2018.](https://cofense.com/necurs-targeting-banks-pub-file-drops-flawedammyy/)\n285 [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/necurs-botnet-pushing-new-marap-malware/, accessed](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/necurs-botnet-pushing-new-marap-malware/)\nNovember 2018.\n286 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0)\n[fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0, accessed November 2018.](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0)\n287 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0)\n[fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0, accessed November 2018.](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Necurs-delivers-language-targeted-porn-scams-fdb9d6b7941506807cbe56dd06e142d0)\n288 [https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-attacks-report.pdf)\n[attacks-report.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-2018-credential-stuffing-attacks-report.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - Implement a botnet Sinkholing[289].\n\n  - Orchestrate and deploy regular vulnerability and patch management programs[290].\n\n  - Implement network and host level controls (i.e. AntiMalware solutions, DNS analysis)[291].\n\n  - Follow the standards for invalid traffic detection methods[292].\n\n###### 3.7.7 Kill Chain\n\n**Figure 19: Position of botnets in the kill-chain**\n\n###### 3.7.8 Authoritative references\n\n“[state of the internet] / security credential stuffing attacks”, Akamai 2018, “The black market report”,\nARMOR 2018, “McAfee Labs Threats Report”, McAfee 2018, “The Human Factor”, Proofpoint 2018,\n“Quarterly Threat Landscape Report Q2-Q3 2018”, Fortinet 2018, “Statistics for botnet-assisted DDoS\nattacks” Kaspersky 2018.\n\n289 [http://la.trendmicro.com/media/misc/sinkholing-botnets-technical-paper-en.pdf, accessed November 2018.](http://la.trendmicro.com/media/misc/sinkholing-botnets-technical-paper-en.pdf)\n290 [https://www.veracode.com/security/botnet, accessed November 2018.](https://www.veracode.com/security/botnet)\n291 [https://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Information/BotnetDetection, accessed November 2018.](https://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Information/BotnetDetection)\n292 [http://mediaratingcouncil.org/082815_MRCDigitalRoadmapPDRF%20paper_Final_in12ptFont.pdf, accessed](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/082815_MRCDigitalRoadmapPDRF%20paper_Final_in12ptFont.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### Data Breaches\n\n 3.8.1 Description of the cyberthreat\n\nWhen it comes to threats and the cyber landscape, Data Breach is the only topic that does not specifically\napply to a threat but reflects a successful malicious attempt, which led to an incident from the\ncompromise or loss of data. Defined as a collective term for a successful incident from the leakage or\nexposure of data (including sensitive information related to organisations or simply personal details of\nindividuals, i.e. medical information), it relates directly to the outcome from other cyberthreats.\n\n###### 3.8.2 Interesting points\n\n  - **Healthcare and Social Media. Six social media breaches, including the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook**\nincident, accounted for over 56% of the total number of records compromised[293]. The Healthcare\nsector continues to lead in the number of incidents (27%). The largest incident was reported by 211\nLA County, disclosing the exposure of 3,5 million records from accidental loss.\n\n  - **Data is exposed or compromised every day. According to the \"breach level index report”, more than**\n25 million records were compromised or exposed every day during the first six months of 2018[294]. In\nthe United States alone, 22 million records were lost or stolen until July 2018.\n\n  - **Encryption is broken. Only 1% of all the data leaked, lost or stolen was encrypted which presents a**\ndecrease compared with 2017.\n\n  - **Web Applications attacks and breaches. Researchers suggests that web-application attacks often**\nresult in larger data breaches[295]. Not surprisingly, cloud infrastructure seems to be the most attractive\ntarget for malicious actors.\n\n  - **Costs of a cybersecurity breach. The average cost of a cybersecurity breach increased 6,4% in 2018.**\nNotably, the average size of a data breach is typically amplified by 2,2%. Third-party involvement and\nextensive cloud migration at the time of a breach increases the cost[386]. Factors such as incident\nresponse and encryption are repeatedly identified as key to reduce the costs of a data breach[296].\n\n  - **Insiders still play a big role. Different reports suggest that 48% of data breach incidents involved**\noutsiders and 27% were caused by human factor or negligence. This leaves 25% for system errors and\nglitches (business processes and IT)[297].\n\n  - **The 2018 prediction on data breaches. The enforcement of GDPR in Europe predicted an increase in**\nthe number of extortion attacks, targeting private/personal data covered by this directive. In other\nwords, malicious actors will increase the number of data breach attempts[298] threatening with GDPR\npenalties deriving from the disclosure. Furthermore, multiple reports suggest that data breaches will\n\n293 [https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-](https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-2018.aspx)\n[2018.aspx, accessed November 2018.](https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-2018.aspx)\n294 [https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-](https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-2018.aspx)\n[2018.aspx, accessed November 2018.](https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-2018.aspx)\n295 [https://www.nttsecurity.com/gtir, accessed November 2018.](https://www.nttsecurity.com/gtir)\n296 [https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-10-facts-about-todays-cybersecurity-landscape-that-](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-10-facts-about-todays-cybersecurity-landscape-that-you-should-know.html)\n[you-should-know.html, accessed October 2018.](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-10-facts-about-todays-cybersecurity-landscape-that-you-should-know.html)\n297 [http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=917, accessed November 2018.](http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=917)\n298 [https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/threat-landscape/2018-trend-micro-security-predictions-](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/threat-landscape/2018-trend-micro-security-predictions-paradigm-shifts)\n[paradigm-shifts, accessed October 2018.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/threat-landscape/2018-trend-micro-security-predictions-paradigm-shifts)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\ncause additional problems especially to US-companies[299], due to the introduction of new data\nprotection regulations in different countries[300]. Gemalto suggested that the implementation of\nAustralian regulation (Notifiable Data Breach) had an impact on the number of breaches, increasing\nfrom 18 to 308 in the country[301]. Considering the number of social media breaches, this trend is\nexpected to increase as more sectors are leveraging from these platforms to reach audiences[301].\n\n###### 3.8.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - Data Breaches compromised 4.500 million records in first half of 2018.\n\n  - Europol reported that external individual malicious actors carried out 73% of the breaches and 50%\nwere attributed to organised crime groups. Additionally, the industry believes that state sponsored\nactors were involved[302] in ca. 12% of the data breaches.\n\n  - Social media ranks top for the number of records breached (56%) due to the high-profile customer\ndata compromised from Facebook and Twitter, involving 2.2000 million and 336 million respectively.\n\n  - Healthcare continues to lead in number of incidents (27%). The largest of such incident, 211 LA\nCounty, exposed 3,5 million records through accidental loss.\n\n  - Identity theft continues to be the leading type of data breaches (56%). This has been the leading\nfactor since 2013, according to Gemalto.\n\n  - Considering the geographic landscape:\n\n`o` North America is considered the most popular target representing 57% of the breaches and 72%\n\nof the records exposed.\n\n`o` Europe observed a 36% decrease in the number of incidents but a 28% increase in the number of\n\nrecords breached, with UK organizations being the most affected in Europe.\n\n  - In terms of breach costs, Canada leads in direct costs and the United States has the highest indirect\ncosts (US $81 per compromised record in Canada and US $152 in US)[386].\n\n  - The number of incidents with data breaches declined comparing the first half of 2017 (171) with 2018\n(123). However, the number of records breached increase exponentially, from 2,7 million in the first\nhalf of 2017 to 4.5 billion in the first half of 2018.[301]\n\n  - Ca. 48% of the breaches identified, used hacking techniques such as malware ca. 30-51% and email as\na delivery mechanism ca. 49%[302].\n\n_The overall trend of data breaches in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n299 [http://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2018-experian-data-breach-industry-forecast.pdf,](http://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2018-experian-data-breach-industry-forecast.pdf)\naccessed November 2018.\n300 [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breach-predictions-the-trends-to-shape-2018-](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breach-predictions-the-trends-to-shape-2018-300569778.html)\n[300569778.html, accessed November 2018.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breach-predictions-the-trends-to-shape-2018-300569778.html)\n301 [https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-](https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-2018.aspx)\n[2018.aspx, accessed November 2018.](https://www.gemalto.com/press/pages/data-breaches-compromised-4-5-billion-records-in-first-half-of-2018.aspx)\n302 https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/iocta_2018_0.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### 3.8.4 Top Data Breaches \n\n  - **Huazhu Hotels Group (Chinese hotel chain): A total of ca. 22,3 GB of data, about ca. 130 million**\ncustomers’ personal data and booking information was hacked from 13 hotels operated by HHG - the\ndata was found advertised on the Dark Web.\n\n  - **Facebook: A weakness in the “Search” capability of the Facebook platform exposed ca. 2.000 million**\nusers’ information publicly.

This type of attack remains the most popular and commonly used web application**\nattack. Also referred as cloud malware injection attacks[312], these are gaining popularity from an increasing\ndemand for cloud hosting services.\n\n**Phishing Attacks. Attackers are targeting companies by trying to impersonate a partner or a vendor**\nthrough an email that asks users to take an action. These emails are giving attackers an access point to\ncritical data or information.\n\n**Insider threat. This category includes any kind of unauthorised or malicious use of organisational**\nresources. Although most of the attacks are facilitated by external actors, insiders (with or without\nprivileged access) are playing a key role in data breaches.\n\n**Physical theft and loss. This refers to intentional or unintentional loss of data due to physical or social**\nengineering attacks.\n\n###### 3.8.6 Specific mitigation actions \n\nDue to the wide nature of threats that can lead to a data breach, the below-mentioned mitigation\ncontrols overlap with other cyberthreats.

Any current or former employee,\npartner or contractor that has or used to have access to the organisation’ digital assets, may intentionally\nor unintentionally abuse this access. The three most common types of insider threats are the - malicious\ninsider - who acts intentionally - the negligent insider - who is just sloppy or does not comply with the\npolicies and security instructions and the - compromised insider - who acts unintentionally as the means\nfor the true attacker[314]. All these three types of insider threats must be studied in depth, as the\nacknowledgement of their existence and their modus operandi should define the organisation’s strategy\nfor security and data protection.\n\nAnalysis concludes that the insider threat trend decreased in 2018[315] mainly due to the infrequent publicly\ndisclosure of incidents from inside the organizations.\n\n###### 3.9.2 Interesting points \n\nThe identified interesting points for the insider threat are as follows:\n\n- **Insider threat perception changed with GDPR. In 2018, the number of reported incidents with insider**\nthreat reduced compared with previous years. This can be justified by the way these incidents are now\nclassified, shifting to data breaches with the introduction of GDPR.[315].\n\n  - **The GDPR compliance rally within the EU is also changing the perception of handling data breaches**\noriginated from insider threat incidents in the US[316].

A company or an organization facing a security\nincident must not exhaust its available resources; a part of the resources must become available for\nother incidents taking place simultaneously (the case where one incident is the smokescreen for a\nmore serious attack) or for recovery.\n\n  - Implement a Single-Sign-On (SSO) access for the company’s applications[326].\n\n  - Implement a multifactor authentication method[326].\n\n  - Define a security policy addressing insider threats, particulary based on user awareness, one of the\nmost effective controls for this type of cyberthreat.\n\n  - Use identity and access management (IAM) solutions by also implementing segregation of duties (e.g.\naccording to defined roles).\n\n325 https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/10/29/insider-threats-protection/, accessed November 2018.\n\n326 https://www.ca.com/us/collateral/solution-brief/how-can-i-counter-the-insider-threats-within-myorganization.thanks.html, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - Implement identity governance solutions defining and enforcing role-based access control.\n\n  - Implement/use security intelligence solutions.\n\n  - Use data-based behaviour analytical tools.\n\n  - Implement privileged identity management (PIM) solutions.\n\n  - Implement training and awareness activities.\n\n  - Implement audit and user monitoring schemes.\n\n###### 3.9.7 Kill Chain \n\n**Figure 23: Position of Insider Threat in kill-chain**\n\n###### 3.9.8 Authoritative references \n\n“2018 Cyberthreat Defense Report”, CyberEdge Group[315]; “Businesses collect more data than they can\nhandle”, Gemalto[321]; “The State of Industrial Cybersecurity 2018”, Kaspersky Lab[322]; “2018 Insider Threat\nReport” and “How can I counter the insider threats within my organization”, CA Technologies[323,326].\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### Physical manipulation/damage/theft/loss\n\n 3.10.1 Description of the cyberthreat\n\nAlthough physical attacks are not a real cyberthreat, they are still possible within businesses today.\nPhysical attacks may not be as popular as other types of cyberthreats, they can still lead to data breaches\n(even in a less subtle way). Companies are increasingly concerned about the data residing within the\ndevices and most specifically about the loss of PII data and Intellectual Property, especially in the age of\nGDPR. Although storage encryption would suffice to mitigate major risks of physical attacks, the number\nof companies that have a consistent enterprise-wide encryption strategy is stable. Finally, physical access\nto a device still gives the opportunity to attackers to conduct their malicious activities, e.g. ATM fraud and\nPOS attacks.\n\n###### 3.10.2 Interesting points\n\nThe identified interesting points for physical manipulation/damage/theft/loss are as follows:\n\n  - **Digital theft has overtaken physical theft with respect to corporate fraud[327]. Physical theft of assets**\nwas the most prevalent type of corporate fraud for the last 10 years. However, information theft, loss,\nor attack has been reported in 2017 as the most prevalent type of fraud compared to physical theft.\n\n  - **The widespread adoption of cloud storage. A recent reported indicated that 80% of organisations are**\nalready using cloud storage and file sharing services while 16% of organisations are planning to use\nthem in the next couple of years[328]. The aforementioned widespread adoption of cloud storage results\nin a limited number of reported physical thefts by major companies[329].\n\n  - **The GDPR effect. The GDPR[330] is relevant to organisations that handle personal data in a digital as well**\nas physical format. Recent privacy regulations have increased the compliance-driven activities and thus,\ntaking into account the potential fines outlined, companies will be interested in investing more in\ninformation security[331]. GDPR is expected to have a direct impact on improving the physical security of\norganisations.\n\n  - **The slow progress in storage encryption technologies. According to a survey[327]: establishing a storage**\nencryption solution is one of the most effective controls in data protection, for many managers from\nthe surveyed companies. The survey identified that only 43% of the companies currently have a\nconsistent enterprise-wide encryption strategy[332]. The aforementioned percentage is the same as last\nyear indicating slow progress for wider adoption of encrypted storage practices. Compliance with\nregulations is a significant driver for deploying encryption technologies according to half of the surveyed\ncompanies. Finally, according to a research[327], physical theft or loss of Intellectual Property is a top\nconcern for executives. A fact that will definitely help towards a wider adoption and deployment of\nstorage encryption technologies.\n\n327 [https://www.kroll.com/en-us/global-fraud-and-risk-report-2018, accessed October 2018.](https://www.kroll.com/en-us/global-fraud-and-risk-report-2018)\n328 [https://community.spiceworks.com/blog/3058-cloud-storage-services-who-claims-the-top-spot-among-](https://community.spiceworks.com/blog/3058-cloud-storage-services-who-claims-the-top-spot-among-microsoft-google-dropbox)\n[microsoft-google-dropbox, accessed October 2018.](https://community.spiceworks.com/blog/3058-cloud-storage-services-who-claims-the-top-spot-among-microsoft-google-dropbox)\n329 [https://www.shreddingmachines.co.uk/pdfs/Kensington-GDPR-White-Paper.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://www.shreddingmachines.co.uk/pdfs/Kensington-GDPR-White-Paper.pdf)\n330 [https://eugdpr.org/, accessed October 2018.](https://eugdpr.org/)\n331 [https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/cert/tietoturvakatsaukset/Tietoturvan-vuosi-2017_EN.pdf, accessed](https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/cert/tietoturvakatsaukset/Tietoturvan-vuosi-2017_EN.pdf)\nOctober 2018.\n332 [https://www.thalesesecurity.com/2018/global-encryption-trends-study, accessed October 2018.](https://www.thalesesecurity.com/2018/global-encryption-trends-study)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Figure 24: Trends in encryption strategy[332]**\n\n- **Consumers care more about lost data rather than lost devices. 57% of the people that lost a personal**\ndevice were mostly concerned about the data (pictures, documents, messages, etc.) residing within the\ngadget rather than the gadget itself[333].\n\n- **Locations of theft.** The victim’s work area or employee’s private vehicles were the most common\nlocations of theft[334] followed by theft in airports and hotels[335].\n\n- **Assets lost or stolen. Paper documents and laptops are the most prevalent assets found in physical**\ntheft or loss incidents[334].\n\n- **Physical security policies and controls. According to survey conducted by an industry player polling IT**\nprofessionals across different sectors, almost one-third of the organisations lack a physical security\npolicy to protect laptops and mobile devices[335]. It also concluded that, 42% of the organisations have\nfully implemented different security measures for the physical security of critical IT systems[336].\nMoreover, more than half of the organisations do not utilize physical locks to secure IT equipment[335].\n\n- **ATM physical attacks on the rise.** During 2017, almost 3.600 physical attacks against banking ATMs\nwere reported in Europe[337]. An increase of 73% is therefore observed compared to 2012 and 20%\ncompared to 2016. The European Association for Secure Transactions (EAST) reported that “black box”\nattacks in Europe increased 307% compared to 2016[338].

Approximately 60% of data**\nleakage incidents take place in government and education institutions, banks and healthcare\norganisations[360].\n\n###### 3.11.3 Trends and main statistics\n\nA recent report reveals the following trends regarding data disclosure[361].\n\n**Figure 29: Recent trends for data disclosure as of 2018[361]**\n\n  - As of March 2018, ca. 500.000 email accounts with passwords were priced at US $90 in the Dark Web[362].\n\n355 https://cdn1.esetstatic.com/ESET/US/resources/white-papers/ESET_Trends_Report_2018_final.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n356 https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/sites/epsc/files/strategic_note_issue_21.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n357 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8316392, accessed November 2018.\n\n358 https://inform.tmforum.org/research-reports/revenue-management-monetize-current-future-services/, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n359 http://www.analysysmason.com/Research/Content/Comments/data-monetisation-USA-Europe-RDMY0/articlepdf/, accessed November 2018.\n\n360 https://infowatch.com/middle_east_report_2017-2018, accessed 2018.\n361 [http://go.thalesesecurity.com/rs/480-LWA-970/images/2018-Data-Threat-Report-Global-Edition-ar.pdf, accessed](http://go.thalesesecurity.com/rs/480-LWA-970/images/2018-Data-Threat-Report-Global-Edition-ar.pdf)\n2018.\n\n362 https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-23-2018-en.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - In H1 2018, USB sticks and other removable media accounted for 2,1% of the leaks worldwide[363].\n\n  - In Q3 2018, a 20% increase in confidential data leaks compared with Q3 2017[364].\n\n  - Average total cost of data disclosure is US $3,86 million, which is a 6,4% increase[365].\n\n  - If data disclosure were to continue at the levels of 2015, fines to be paid to the European Regulators\n(according to GDPR) could see a 90-fold increase, from £1.4bn in 2015 to £122bn[366].\n\n  - The total amount of business data being stored is estimated to double every 12 to 18 months. Hence,\nthe potential data exfiltration is increasing accordingly[366].\n\n  - While the forensic costs are often less when data is unintentionally disclosed, the cost to insurers can\nstill be substantial due to the high notification and credit monitoring costs[366].\n\n  - Internal actors are 29% of those who are involved in data disclosures. In detail, 26% of the internal\nactors are system administrators, 22% are end-users, 12% are doctors or nurses and 22% are others[367].\n\n  - 16% of any data disclosure is due to miscellaneous errors, 13% due to privilege misuse and 7% due to\nlost or stolen assets[367].\n\n_The overall trend of information leakage in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n###### 3.11.4 Top data leaks incidents\n\n  - In January, information collected by the mobile fitness tracking and sharing app Strava has highlighted\nthe locations of secret Russia, UK, and US military bases in Syria and Afghanistan. The personal fitness\ntracker Fitbit, linked to the user’s Strava accounts revealed the information[368].\n\n  - The marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis left about 340 million records exposed on a publicly\naccessible server. The trove didn't include Social Security numbers or credit card numbers, but it\ncomprised 2 terabytes of very personal information about hundreds of millions of adults[369].\n\n  - At the beginning of May, Twitter disclosed that it had been unintentionally storing some user\npasswords in plaintext in an internal log. The company fixed the problem, but it wouldn't say for how\nlong the passwords were exposed[370].\n\n  - In July, the Domain Factory, a German hosting provider, experienced a data disclosure for the full set\nof its customers.

The\ndatabase was not password-protected, constituting an easy target for any malicious actor. The\ncompromised details included ca. 400 million email addresses and other records collected/created\nover a period of four years between 2013 and 2017 [364].\n\n  - Sungy Mobile Ltd., one of the world’s leading mobile application developers, leaked the details on ca.\n50 million consumers due to a misconfigured backup database[364].\n\n  - In mid-November, Google faced a significant incident from a routing protocol hijack which resulted in\nthe interception of network traffic and, thus, in an information leakage (i.e., Border Gateway Protocol\nleak). In detail, the incident affected a Nigerian ISP (MainOne Inc.), peering at IXPN (Internet Exchange\nPoint of Nigeria) in Lagos where Google and China Telecom are also members. The incident occurred\nwhen 212 network addresses, which aggregated more than 500 BGP announcements, were erroneously\nrerouted over the Russian ISP TransTelecom, to China Telecom, toward the Nigerian ISP Main One[372,373].\n\n###### 3.11.5 Specific attack vectors \n\nThe primary attack vector in information leakage is insiders. This term is often used to describe a person\nwith interest to exfiltrate important information on behalf of a third-party entity. Other common attack\nvectors used by this threat are misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and human errors. For more information\non attack vectors, please see chapter 5 in this report.\n\n###### 3.11.6 Specific mitigation actions \n\nThe mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements:\n\n  - Anonymise, pseudonymise, minimise and encrypt data according to the provisions of the European\nUnion General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act[374,375].\nAlways check the regulation commitments for counterpart entities who do not come under bi- or\nmultilateral initiatives[376,377,378].\n\n  - Store data only on secure IT assets[379].\n\n371 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/in/security/news/cyber-attacks/check-your-accounts-timehop-macy-sbloomingdale-s-domain-factory-announce-breach, accessed November 2018.\n\n372 https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2018/11/route-leak-caused-a-major-google-outage//, accessed November\n2018.\n\n373 https://www.wired.com/story/google-internet-traffic-china-russia-rerouted//, accessed November 2018.\n\n374 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679, accessed November 2018.\n\n375 https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375, accessed November 2018.\n\n376 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/data-protection-if-theresno-brexit-deal, accessed November 2018.\n\n377 https://iapp.org/news/a/brexit-and-data-protection-laying-the-odds/, accessed November 2018.\n\n378 https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/legal-updates/data-protection-and-brexit/5057412.article, accessed November\n2018.\n\n379 https://www.compuquip.com/blog/5-tips-to-prevent-data-leakage-at-your-company, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - Limit user access privileges under the need-to-know principle[379,380].\n\n  - Educate and train the organisation’s personnel periodically[379,381].\n\n  - Revoke access privileges to anyone who is not an employee[379].\n\n  - Utilise technology tools to avoid possible data leakages, such as vulnerability scans, malware scans\nand data loss prevention (DLP) tools.

Nowadays, bank accounts, home addresses, accounting records, health\nrecords and a slew of other personal information stored in own devices or organization’s/companies’\ndatabases and, they are, thus, vulnerable to cybercriminal activity.\n\nIdentity theft is a procedure rather than an isolated incident; the attackers need several elements of\npersonal information to accurately “build” a full profile of a particular person. Thus, identity theft\nassociated with various types of data such as health records, personal web accounts, bank account\ninformation, personal information, and information of contacts. If this information “bits and pieces” is not\nenough for a complete profile, the data is exchanged between attackers via the Dark Web[384], so that the\nidentity theft may be complete in the future.\n\nThe identity theft threat is strongly associated with data breaches in companies or organisations across all\nindustry sectors (Figure 31)[385]. Data breach attacks are in most cases targeting the company’s customer\nrecords. The information leaked through these attacks may be sufficient for the next step, which is the\nidentity fraud. Since the average number of records breached in 2018 has increased by 2,2%[386], it is safe\nto conclude that the identity theft trend is also increasing in the reporting period.\n\n**Figure 31: Records compromised by data breach in 2018, per sector[387]**\n\n383 https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/ebooks/a-guide-to-fraud-in-the-real-world.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n384http://www.thecommentator.com/article/6849/nhs_trusts_misplace_10_000_patient_records_in_major_security\n_breach, accessed November 2018.\n\n385 https://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/2018/ITRCBreachStatsReportSummary2018.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n386 https://databreachcalculator.mybluemix.net/assets/2018_Global_Cost_of_a_Data_Breach_Report.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n387 [https://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/2018/ITRCBreachStatsReportSummary2018.pdf, accessed](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/2018/ITRCBreachStatsReportSummary2018.pdf)\nNovember 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### 3.12.2 Interesting points \n\nThe interesting points for this threat in the reporting period are as follows:\n\n  - **GDPR to the rescue[388]. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced**\nfor all European Union’s public and private companies and organisations. The GDPR defines the rules\nand requirements for regulators or processors to set personal data protection policies at the Member\nStates level and the failure of compliance may cost up to 4% of the annual company’s turnover in\npenalties. Some of the policy elements include data encryption and the dual-factor authentication.\nAdditionally, the GDPR dictates a formal report of any data breach of the company’s assets to the\nregional Data Protection Agency (DPA). The basic points of the GDPR are the following:\n\n`o` Describes the frame for handling EU residents’ data.\n\n`o` Enforces resident’s consent regarding data collection and use.\n\n`o` Defines the types of personal data that can be stored and used by the company/organisation.\n\n`o` Enforces the use of open file formats for data transferring.\n\n`o` Allows individuals to delete or rectify their data.\n\n`o` Requires a ‘liaison’ officer for the collaboration between the company/organisation and the DPA.\n\n`o` Enforces the formal reporting of breaches within a few days of the event.\n\n  - **Legitimate software extensions used in campaigns. In May 2018, the Unimania campaign[389] was**\nrevealed. It has been noticed that via popular Chrome extensions’ such as the Video Downloader for\nFacebook (ca. 170.000 users), the PDF Merge (ca. 125.000 users) and others installed on this browser,\ncollected personal information based on user’s behaviour (i.e. posts, tweets, YouTube videos\nwatched, user IDs and location data). These extensions, developed with attention to detail, included\nan End-User License Agreement (EULA). Although the developer is still unknown and more\nimportantly, who was the recipient of the intercepted information, the EULA mentioned the company\nname Unimania, Inc. located in Tel-Aviv, Israel. An estimate indicates that more than 420.000 users\nmay have been affected by this incident.\n\nIn July 2018, the Big Star Labs campaign[390] was also revealed. The Big Stars Labs was not distributed\nonly via Chrome but also via other legitimate software extensions, such as the Block Site (Android\napplication and Firefox extension with ca. 100.000 users each, Chrome extension with ca. 1,4 million\nusers), the AdBlockPrime and several more Android and iOS applications, Chrome and Firefox\nextensions. The Big Star Labs campaign may have infected more than ca. 11 million users, 26 times\nmore users than the ones affected by Unimania.\n\nAs in the case of Unimania, also in the Big Star Labs campaign, it was not clear who were the targets.\nHowever, certain parts of the embedded code pointed out the involvement of an Israel-based web\nanalytics company.\n\n  - **Open government has exposed citizens data. In September 2018, the US based news channel CNN**\nreported the exposure of people’s personal details (i.e. social security numbers, citizenship status,\ncriminal records) by the public portal FOIA.gov. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) portal of the\nUS Environmental Protection Agency, operating as an intermediate between citizens and\n\n388 https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/src/uploads/2017/11/PandaLabs_Annual_Report_2017.pdf,\naccessed November 2018.\n\n389 https://adguard.com/en/blog/unimania-spyware-campaign/, accessed November 2018.\n\n390 https://adguard.com/en/blog/big-star-labs-spyware/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\ngovernmental agencies, processes personal information from applicants. A flaw on the FOIA.gov\ncomplex of servers allowed unauthorized searches on FOIA’s records, without neither the agency’s\nnor the applicant’s permission. CNN alerted the US Environmental Protection Agency, which then\nfixed the issue and stopped the exposure. A similar situation took place in August 2016, when the\nKennesaw State University, authorized to support the elections, exposed voters’ registration data.\n\nThe USA is not the only country that faced this type of incident in 2018. In March 2018, a software\nflaw in a third-party site for the Canadian government leaked ca. 7.000 documents and in August, the\nUK government exposed data found by Google. In the same month, more than ca. 2,3 million Mexican\nhealthcare records were exposed due to a database misconfiguration[391].\n\n###### 3.12.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - 10% of the UK healthcare organisations have been breached more than 10 times in the last year[392].\n\n  - 3% of the T-mobile customers’ records (2,3 million individuals) were breached in August 2018[393]. The\ncustomers’ personal information, such as name, billing address, and account number were stolen.\n\n  - The cost of fraud for 2018 only for the USA is estimated to exceed US $7.4 billion, a 32% growth of the\nrecorded US $5.6 billion cost in 2016[383].\n\n  - 38% of the organisations have cloud user accounts that were compromised[394].\n\n  - More than five employee identities where spoofed in each case of the 57% of the targeted companies\n(10% more companies than the year before)[395].\n\n  - 30% more phishing links were detected in social media[396].\n\n  - 141% increase in North America, 22% decrease in Europe and 36% decrease in Asia, in compromised\ncredentials[397].\n\n  - LokiPWS distribution increased by more than 300% in 2018[397].\n\n  - 28% more self-reported data breaches were recorded in 2017-2018 compared to the previous year, as\na result of GDPR reporting commitment[398,386].\n\n_The overall trend of identity theft in 2018 is INCREASING._\n\n391 https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/09/06/social-security-numbers-exposed-on-us-governmenttransparency-site/, accessed November 2018.\n\n392 https://www.carbonblack.com/uk-threat-report-2018/, accessed November 2018.\n\n393 https://www.securityweek.com/t-mobile-data-breach-hits-over-2-million-customers, accessed November 2018.\n\n394 https://www.ixiacom.com/system/files/private/2018-05/Ixia-S-RP-2018-Security-Report.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n395 https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-tr-q118-quarterly-threat-report.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n396 https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-tr-q218-quarterly-threat-report.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n397 https://www.blueliv.com/blog-news/credential-theft/credential-theft-industry/, accessed November 2018.\n\n398 https://www.itproportal.com/news/human-error-top-cause-of-self-reported-data-breaches/, accessed November\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Figure 32: The cost as an indicator for the trend of data breaches in 2018[399]**\n\n###### 3.12.4 Top identity theft threats \n\n  - **Skimmers. An identity theft method where fraudsters place devices (known as skimmers) over card**\nreaders at registers checkout, gas stations or ATMs. Skimmers store credit and debit card information\nso fraudsters can use this data to make counterfeit cards, use them for online purchases or sell them\non the black market[400].\n\n  - **Dumpster divers. Fraudsters dig through trash or mailboxes, looking for bank statements, copies of**\ntax returns and other documents that have personal information[401].\n\n  - **Telephone impersonators. Fraudsters may contact a bank's call center many times, each time gaining**\na different piece of information until they have enough information to impersonate an actual bank\ncustomer and gain account access[402].\n\n  - **Network administrator impersonators. A new form of identity theft targeting network**\nadministrators’ accounts, is performed by attackers in an attempt to circumvent mitigation tools and\npolicies and access the company’s database. By the use of legitimate network tools, such as\napplications for remote access or remote back-ups, the attacker was able to steal the administrator’s\nidentity and operate as the legitimate administrator within the company’s network. This style of\nattacking, namely the malwareless attacks, exceeded 49% of this year’s data breach incidents.[ 388].\n\n  - **Phishers and spear-phishers. Phishers use authentic-looking emails and websites to trick users to**\nclick on a link or open an attachment that will download malware onto their computers and leave\nconfidential information vulnerable[403].

Although companies and organizations are**\naccountable for the safekeeping of customers’ personal information, a gap is revealed since most of\nthe times, a part of the company’s digital assets are stored in cloud services or virtual machines.\n\n  - In the case of cloud computing, the company would face financial and legal consequences even in\ncloud provider’s data breaches. Most providers have security policies and tools, but, still, the\ncompany that hosts its digital assets in a provider’s infrastructure has no control over them. It has\nbeen reported that 73% of the cloud providers had misconfigurations in their security policies that\ncould lead to a data breach[394].\n\n  - Moreover, attacks on the cloud infrastructure are highly profitable, therefore attractive to hackers\nand cyber criminals, making them extremely likely.\n\n  - **Phishing tools. The group of cyber criminals mostly focused on the theft of identity’s information is the**\nphishers. Some of the main tactics[404] that were used by phishers to intercept user credentials were:\n\n`o` **_Domain squatting. Fraudulent domains that are similar to a valid one, for example,_**\n\n0racle[dot]com.\n\n`o` **_Domain shadowing. Fraudulent subdomains hidden in a valid domain, for example,_**\n\nshadow[dot]oracle[dot]com.\n\n`o` **_Malicious domains. Domains that lure users to register and via the registration intercept personal_**\n\ninformation.\n\n`o` **_URL shorteners. A shortened URL is used to hide the domain. Shorteners are used by valid_**\n\ndomains, for example goo[dot]gl and the users are familiarized with this trend. This assists the\nphishers to pass their shorteners as valid.\n\n`o` **_Subdomain services. A malicious site in a valid domain server, for example_**\n\nmalicious[dot]blogspot[dot]com.\n\nThese URLs are either intercepting random visitors or are sent via email to lure specific individuals or\ngroups of users. For more information about phishing and spear-fishing, please refer to section 3.6.\n\n  - **W2 scam. The W2 scam is another attack aiming at companies’ records to access sensitive**\ninformation. The scam starts by spoofing an executive member of finance or HR department for\nemployees’ records. These records are then used for identity theft. The scam is named after the US\nW2 tax form used to report employee’s wages. This social engineering scam, although old (first\nreported in 2016 by IRS), is resurfacing with an increase of 10% more incidents than last year[395].\n\n  - **Email fraud. In this type of attack (also known as Business Email Compromise or BEC) the sender of**\nthe email impersonates an executive member of the company or a partner organization and asks for\nsensitive information. It is just a query-mail, which makes it harder to detect in advance or prevent it.\nHowever, the attackers tend to use specific keywords on the mail’s subject that gives a hint of the\ntype of information they are after. The most common keywords are ‘Payment’, ‘Request’, ‘Urgent’,\nand ‘FYI’. The companies and organisations that are mostly targeted by BEC are retail, healthcare and\ngovernment organisations[396].\n\n404 https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/hu_hu/campaigns/security-hub/pdf/acr-2018.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - **LokiPWS.

This technique also applies to other malware such as Pony, Emotet, KeyBase and AZORult[397].\nFor more information about the use of malware for identity theft, please refer to the section 3.1.\n\n  - **Software and hardware vulnerabilities. Hard- software vulnerabilities may leave the user’s data**\nexposed. Some of the vulnerabilities recorded in 2018, which were associated with identity theft, are\nthe CVE-2018-14787 of Philips IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) devices that allowed interception of\nthe patient’s medical information[405], the CVE-2018-11776 of Apache Struts software and the CVE2018-7445 of MicroTik RouterOS that both allowed remote code execution and several exploits have\nbeen used[406][,][407].\n\n###### 3.12.6 Specific mitigation actions \n\n  - Sensitive information such as patient records should not be stored in handwritten notes to prevent\nloss or misplacement[384]. It is better to give digital files a small lifespan and then to destroy them\neffectively.\n\n  - Apply ‘threat hunting’ within a company to strengthen the security plans. Threat hunting[392] is\nconducted by skilled members of the Security Operation Centre (SoC) team to proactively identify\nvulnerabilities and prevent breaches.\n\n  - Introduce policies such as velocity-based rules to mitigate identity fraud, especially for payment card\ntransactions[383]. The machine data of valid transactions can provide sufficient information for the\noptimal policy definition.\n\n  - Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication methods, when available, allowing a user to access\nseveral applications with the same set of digital credentials. It is highly recommended to minimize the\nnumber of user’s accounts and the stored credentials[408].\n\n  - Introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to overcome the password hacking or loss and ensure\nthe authentication process with multiple keys. The adaptive MFA optimizes the authentication\nprocess based on user’s behaviour and context[408].\n\n  - Produce compulsory checks to URLs that are sent via email or randomly visited, before any further\nstep is taken[404]. Checks based on IP address, the ASN that associates with the IP, the owner of the\ndomain and the relation between this domain and others.\n\n  - Organizations that are adopting cloud services should have strong cloud security operations and\nprefer an architecture of on-premises storages, private cloud storages and public cloud storages\nsimultaneously to protect their customer’s personal information[394].\n\n  - Implement the use of strong and updated encryption methods for sensitive data such as TLS 1.3 (uses\nephemeral keys), to prevent hacking[394].\n\n  - Adequately protect all identity documents and copies (physical or digital ones) against unauthorised\naccess.\n\n405 https://threatpost.com/philips-vulnerability-exposes-sensitive-cardiac-patient-information/136669/, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n406 https://www.nopsec.com/blog/another-year-another-critical-struts-flaw-cve-2018-11776/, accessed November\n2018.\n\n407 https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-7445/, accessed November 2018.\n\n408 https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/identity-driven-security/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - Identity information should not be disclosed to unsolicited recipients and their requests by phone,\nemail or in person.\n\n  - Password protect devices, ensure good quality of credentials, and secure methods for their storage.\n\n  - Users should pay attention when using public Wi-Fi networks, as fraudsters hack or mimic them.

Cryptojacking (also known as cryptomining) is a\nnew term that refers to the programs that use the victim's device processing power (CPU or GPU[410]) to\nmine cryptocurrencies without the victim's consent. This processing power is used to solve cryptographic\npuzzles that are recorded in the blockchain. The Cybercrime-as-a-Service sector is always innovative and\nlooking for new ways to generate revenue[411] and to apply the \"follow-the-money\" principle: cyber\ncriminals take advantage of the victims' processing power (usually 70% to 80% unused processing\npower[412]) to mine cryptocurrencies and earn real world money, monetized after legal exchanges and\ntransactions.\n\n###### 3.13.2 Interesting points\n\nThe identified interesting points for cryptojacking threats are as follows:\n\n  - **Shift from ransomware to cryptojacking[458]. Since the fourth quarter of 2017, a clear trend for cyber**\ncriminals to move from ransomware[413] to cryptomining as the preferred way to make profit[242] has\nbeen observed. The spike in the value of Bitcoin and the fact that cryptocurrencies became a\nmainstream feature of society[414], encouraged cyber criminals to target cryptocurrencies (via\ncryptomining or stealing users' cryptocurrency) for various reasons. First, cryptojacking is simpler and\nmore straightforward due to the low barrier for entry (e.g. a couple of source code lines is enough for\na browser based cryptominer)[244]. Second, it is less risky, stable and a less disruptive way to make\nmoney while it allows cyber criminals to fly under the user radar since the latter are not prompted to\nmake any payment and may not notice the cryptomining activity. Third, every system can potentially\nbe a victim (including fully patched systems)[248]. Fourth, they have attracted minimal law enforcement\nattention[242]. Finally, monetization is easier for the cyber criminals since no intermediary and no fraud\nschemes are required.\n\n  - **The prevalence of anonymity cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin became the most popular cryptocurrency[415],**\nhowever, many new cryptocurrencies have been developed[416]. Most notable of alternative\ncryptocurrencies are Monero[417] [418], Ethereum[419] and Zcash[420] as they provide higher levels of\ntransaction anonymity for cyber criminals compared to Bitcoin. They can also be mineable in a\ndistributed way, which matches with the modus operandi of cyber criminals (via infected\n\n409 [https://lp.skyboxsecurity.com/rs/440-MPQ-510/images/Skybox_Report_Vulnerability_Threat_Trends_2018_Mid-](https://lp.skyboxsecurity.com/rs/440-MPQ-510/images/Skybox_Report_Vulnerability_Threat_Trends_2018_Mid-Year_Update.pdf)\n[Year_Update.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://lp.skyboxsecurity.com/rs/440-MPQ-510/images/Skybox_Report_Vulnerability_Threat_Trends_2018_Mid-Year_Update.pdf)\n410 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit, accessed October 2018.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)\n411 [https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-](https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2018.html)\n[assessment-netherlands-2018.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2018.html)\n412 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2018/85469/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2018/85469/)\n413 [https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/)\n414 [https://securelist.com/mining-is-the-new-black/84232/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/mining-is-the-new-black/84232/)\n415 [https://bitcoin.org/en/, accessed October 2018.](https://bitcoin.org/en/)\n416 [https://www.malwarebytes.com/pdf/white-papers/CTNT-Q1-2018.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/pdf/white-papers/CTNT-Q1-2018.pdf)\n417 [https://getmonero.org/, accessed October 2018.](https://getmonero.org/)\n418 [https://www-cdn.webroot.com/6515/2168/8585/Webroot_2018_Threat_Report_US.pdf, accessed October](https://www-cdn.webroot.com/6515/2168/8585/Webroot_2018_Threat_Report_US.pdf)\n2018.\n419 [https://www.ethereum.org/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.ethereum.org/)\n420 [https://z.cash/, accessed October 2018.](https://z.cash/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nmachines/bots)[421]. Monero has been by far the most preferred cryptocurrency as it has much lower\n“difficulty rate” for mining compared to Bitcoin[422]. XMRig[423] open source Monero mining software has\nbeen one of the most popular mining programs used by cyber criminals[455]. Finally, Monero miners\nhave also been leveraged by advanced threat groups like Lazarus[424] and Iron Tiger[425].\n\n- **The economics of cryptojacking. During the first half of 2018, it was estimated that cryptominers**\nhave monetized for their users more than US $2.5 billion[455]. Smominru mining botnet that has\ninfected more than 500.000 Windows machines has already mined Monero, valued between US\n$2.8M and US $3.6M[426]. It was estimated that an adversary controlling 2.000 victim computer systems\nwith Monero miners could generate US $500 per day or US $182.500 per year[427].\n\n- **Cryptocurrencies’ market price and cryptojacking detections correlation. During the past 12 months,**\nit has been observed that the trend in cryptominers closely follows the money flow and valuation of\ncryptocurrency market prices[428]. The figure below presents a positive correlation between Bitcoin’s\nmarket price and the detections of cryptojacking malware. One can assess (with moderate\nconfidence) that a potential big increase or decrease in the cryptocurrencies’ market price could\ndirectly influence the numbers of cryptominer detections[428].\n\n**Figure 34: Bitcoin cryptojacking malware volume and Bitcoin price during 1H2018 [429]**\n\n421 [https://info.phishlabs.com/hubfs/2018%20PTI%20Report/PhishLabs%20Trend%20Report_2018-digital.pdf,](https://info.phishlabs.com/hubfs/2018%20PTI%20Report/PhishLabs%20Trend%20Report_2018-digital.pdf)\naccessed October 2018.\n422 [https://www.accenture.com/t20180803T064557Z__w__/hu-en/_acnmedia/PDF-83/Accenture-Cyber-](https://www.accenture.com/t20180803T064557Z__w__/hu-en/_acnmedia/PDF-83/Accenture-Cyber-Threatscape-Report-2018.pdf)\n[Threatscape-Report-2018.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://www.accenture.com/t20180803T064557Z__w__/hu-en/_acnmedia/PDF-83/Accenture-Cyber-Threatscape-Report-2018.pdf)\n423 [https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig, accessed October 2018.](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)\n424 [https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/a-north-korean-monero-cryptocurrency-miner, accessed](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/a-north-korean-monero-cryptocurrency-miner)\nOctober 2018.\n425 [https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/april/decoding-network-data-from-](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/april/decoding-network-data-from-a-gh0st-rat-variant/)\n[a-gh0st-rat-variant/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/april/decoding-network-data-from-a-gh0st-rat-variant/)\n426 [https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/smominru-monero-mining-botnet-making-millions-](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/smominru-monero-mining-botnet-making-millions-operators)\n[operators, accessed October 2018.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/smominru-monero-mining-botnet-making-millions-operators)\n427 [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/malicious-xmr-mining.html, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/malicious-xmr-mining.html)\n428 [https://resources.malwarebytes.com/files/2018/07/Malwarebytes_Cybercrime-Tactics-and-Techniques-Q2-](https://resources.malwarebytes.com/files/2018/07/Malwarebytes_Cybercrime-Tactics-and-Techniques-Q2-2018.pdf)\n[2018.pdf, accessed October 2018.](https://resources.malwarebytes.com/files/2018/07/Malwarebytes_Cybercrime-Tactics-and-Techniques-Q2-2018.pdf)\n429 [https://www.fortinet.com/demand/gated/q2-2018-threat-landscape-report.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.fortinet.com/demand/gated/q2-2018-threat-landscape-report.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- **Drive-by cryptomining. Cryptomining can be browser-based using technologies such as JavaScript[430]**\nand WebAssembly[431] (a newer browser technology that is faster and more efficient than JavaScript).\nSince Coinhive[432] released its JavaScript based technologies in September 2017, it has been injected\ninto thousands of websites[455] by cyber criminals and website administrators (usually this happens via\n3[rd] party websites[435]). It is reported that 2,2% of the top 100 Alexa[433] websites have been found to use\ncryptomining scripts[242]. Coinhive is also marketed as an alternative way for websites to make revenue\ninstead of using ads[248]. It is understood that many Coinhive copycats have emerged due to Coinhive’s\nsuccess[416]. Finally, a major advance in web-based cryptomining is a new technique for persistent\nmining that maintains the process running even after the browser window is closed[434].\n\n- **Cryptomining capabilities in existing trojans and botnets. During the reporting period, we have**\nobserved existing trojans and botnets to incorporate cryptomining capabilities[435]. Examples of such\ntrend include TrickBot[436], Dridex[435], Neutrino[437] and CodeFork/Gamarue[438]. Malware authors can\neffortlessly and quickly push these cryptomining capabilities into their existing malware in order to\nmake more profit.\n\n- **Cryptojacking hits cloud’s high-powered resources. Cryptojacking is one of the major issues found in**\ncloud environments as 25% of organisations have been affected[439]. The recent incident with\ncryptojacking activity in the cloud environments of Telsa[440], Aviva, Gemalto[441] and LA Times[442] are\nindicative of the trend. Moreover, cloud threats also include cryptomining via Docker and\nKubernetes[443] as well as hacked serverless functions[444].\n\n- **Cryptojacking goes mobile.

Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs but also blocking execution of files (e.g.\nblock execution in Temp folder).\n\n  - Conduct regular security audits on corporate networks looking for anomalies.\n\n  - Implement robust vulnerability and patch management.\n\n  - Use whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed at the end-points.\n\n  - Invest in user awareness especially with regard to secure browsing behaviour.\n\n  -

The ransomware attacker gains ownership of files and/or\nvarious devices and blocks the real owner from accessing them. To return the ownership the attacker\ndemands a ransom in cryptocurrency[475].\n\nRansomware attacks are nowadays evolving from stand-alone to cyber-adversary campaigns. This\nmorphing is mostly due to the level of sophistication of attackers, often elevated by leaked or stolen\nclassified tools developed by government agencies[476]. The victims of these attacks not only suffer certain\nfinancial losses, but they also lose their credibility. This motivates the existence of an accurate and\nupdated prediction and prevention plan within every organization.\n\nAccording to several security researchers groups, there has been a decrease in ransomware incidents this\nyear, while an increase in cryptocurrency mining attacks has been observed[475]. In cryptocurrency mining,\nthe attacker is more focused on assuming the control of the machine’s computational power and\nproducing currency units indefinitely, than being paid a ransom amount once. For more information\nabout cryptojacking, please consult chapter 3.13.\n\nEven though the ransomware landscape is changing, many sectors still suffer from these attacks. For\nexample, over than 85% of the malware targeting medical devices in 2018 was ransomware[477].\nAdditionally, 973 out of a total of 30.362 security breach incidents (3,2%) in all sectors was due to\nransomware[478]. This keeps ransomware as a threat that cannot be ignored.\n\n###### 3.14.2 Interesting points \n\nThe identified interesting points for ransomware are as follows:\n\n  - **From ransomware to cryptojacking. In early 2018, a trend towards cryptojacking rather than**\nransomware attacks has been observed. In cryptojacking, the intruders invade a computer in a way\nsimilar to ransomware, but instead of demanding a ransom, they install malicious software to start\ncryptocurrency mining without the computer owner’s noticing. The first indication was that, although\nthe coin mining software (coin miners) known samples were approximately 400.000 in Q4 2017, they\ngrew to more than 2,9 million in Q1 2018. Only in the first half (H1) of 2018, the cryptocurrency\nmining detections increased by 96% compared to the total detections recorded in 2017[479].\nCryptojacking is simpler and less risky for the attackers who begin to monetise on the victim’s system\nwithout any delay or without risking the victim’s denial. In Q1 2018, Lazarus, an international\n\n474 https://www.cylance.com/content/dam/cylance-web/en-us/resources/knowledge-center/resourcelibrary/white-papers/RansomwarePreventionIsPossible.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n475 https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2018/06/27125925/KSNreport_Ransomware-and-malicious-cryptominers_2016-2018_ENG.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n476 https://www.dimensiondata.com/insights/-/media/dd/corporate/pdfs/gtir-executive-guide-2018.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n477 https://www.cylance.com/content/dam/cylance-web/en-us/resources/knowledge-center/resourcelibrary/white-papers/MedicalTechDeviceWhitePaper.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n478 https://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_DBIR_2018_Report_execsummary_en_xg.pdf,\naccessed November 2018.\n\n479 https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/29/cybercrime-tools-tactics-procedures/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\ncybercrime group responsible for several ransomware attacks since 2016, deployed a cryptocurrency\nscheme called HaoBao[480].\n\n  - **Ransomed medical devices: an ongoing threat. As predicted in the past[478], this year more than 85%**\nof all the malware that affected healthcare organizations was ransomware. Unfortunately, the\nhealthcare sector provides an easy target to attackers due to the usual lack of integration between IT\npolicies and the core hospital operations. Additionally, the nature of such organisations in many cases\nforces them to give in to ransom demands, putting a swift end to the attack. These reasons make the\nhealthcare organisations appealing to ransomware attackers.\n\n  - **Ransomware ‘DIY’ is now available for everyone. In most ransomware attacks, such as Cerber[481], the**\nuse of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as a backdoor allows the attacker to gain access to the victim’s\ncomputer. The sophistication of the criminal community on the use of RDP has reached a point that\ncriminals develop a ‘ransomware interface’ named WYSIWYE[482]. This interface allows users to select a\nnetwork computer to attack, a specific set of folders in a computer to lock, any email address to\ncontact or hack within the network, etc. Thus, it also allows someone to become a ransomware\ncriminal with minimum technical skills. This indicates that in the future, many more people with\nconsiderably less sophistication will unleash ransomware attacks.\n\n  - **The Dark Web is recycling. Security Intelligence experts have shown that there is a trend of ‘open’ use**\nof malware by multiple threat actors. Their analysis counted more than 3 million registered Dark Web\nusers in 25 sites that are offering access to tools and information for attacks. The content shared was\nconsidered sufficient for any wannabe attacker, regardless the technical knowledge or experience.\nNoteworthy that, 12% of the available Dark Web material was ransomware-related. Moreover, the\ncost for accessing the material is extremely low. This environment allows anyone with just a small\namount of money to be able to conduct attacks using already developed tools and methods[483]. This\ntrend of “sharing” malicious tools via the Dark Web has shifted the nature of ransomware attacks\nfrom individuals to global groups of attackers. Such coordinated attacks provided the tools used to\ntarget the Ohio Police and Fire Department and the Minnesota Psychiatric in June 2018[479], where\nboth critical and personal services were compromised.\n\n  - **Nations are getting involved. The ransomware attack campaigns WannaCry and NotPetya, organized**\nby nation-state actors, were initiated in 2017 and continued throughout 2018. In both cases, the main\ngoal of the attacks was the destruction of information or just causing a distraction rather than\nreceiving a specific ransom. This demonstrates that in nation-state attacks the recovery may not be a\npossibility for the victims. Although the attacks were allegedly orchestrated by a state, in many cases\nthe actor was a malicious individual or a group - the Lazarus group delivered the WannaCry campaign\norganized by the North Korean state[479]. This use of ransomware may indicate a future trend where\ngovernments or regimes get actively involved in the cyberwarfare.\n\n###### 3.14.3 Trends and main statistics\n\n  - A 30% drop in the number of ransomware victims and 22,5% less attacks to mobile users comparing Q1\n2018 and Q1 2017[475].\n\n480 https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-jun-2018.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n481 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2017/at_download/fullReport,\naccessed November 2018.\n\n482 https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/src/uploads/2018/07/Whitepaper-rasomwareEN.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n483 https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/26/dark_web_cybercrime_sitrep/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- Ransomware decreased to 2,80% of the total Q1 2018 malware attacks[475].\n\n- 44,5% more users encountered miners in Q1 2018[475].\n\n- Coin miners’ development and use increased to 4% of the total Q1 2018 threats; was 3% in 2017[475].\n\n- The mobile miners’ use percentage over the total threat incidents increased by 9,5% in Q1 2018[475].\n\n- The most common ransomware targets were payment card information (34%) and Personally\nIdentifiable Information (PII) (36%)[478].\n\n- 39% of the global malware-related data breaches were ransomware[484].\n\n- 17% of the total UK healthcare data breaches were ransomware[485].\n\n- 58,8% of the respondents to a security incident were using tools for ransomware prevention and 83%\nof them claimed that these tools were helpful[486].\n\n- 64% of the major incidents targeting industrial control systems or networks were ransomware[487].\n\n- 93% of phishing emails were related to ransomware[488].\n\n- 36% of all malicious email in Europe and Japan was related to ransomware[489].\n\n- 65% of the ransomware attacks were delivered via email and 35% via malicious URLs[489].\n\n- Nearly 70% of the cybercrime incidents targeting educational institutions were ransomware[489].\n\n- 5,4 billion WannaCry attacks were blocked[490].\n\n- Although 66% of the companies agreed that ransomware is a serious danger, less than 13% of them\nwere prepared for a ransomware attack[491].\n\n- Roughly 1,0% of the infected endpoints were attacked by ransomware[492].\n\n- Ransomware hit 15% of businesses in the top 10 industry sectors: education, IT/telecom,\nentertainment, financial services, construction, government, manufacturing, transport, healthcare\nand retail[493].\n\n484 https://www.techrepublic.com/article/new-blackberry-workspaces-platform-could-help-businesses-quicklyrecover-from-ransomware/, accessed November 2018.\n\n485 https://www.carbonblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/uk-threat-report-sept-2018.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n486 https://www.dflabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Survey_SOC-2018_DFLabs.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n487 https://ics.kaspersky.com/media/2018-Kaspersky-ICS-Whitepaper.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n488 http://www.intelligentcio.com/me/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/03/Cybercrime-by-the-Numbers-ScaleVulnerability-Infographic.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n489 https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-human-factor-report-2018-180425.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n490 https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-23-2018-en.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n491 https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-g-ransomware-survival-guide.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n492 https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/fileless-attacks-jump-94--in-first-half-of-2018/d/d-id/133268, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n493 http://invenioit.com/security/2018-ransomware-statistics/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n  - The most common ransomware attack was WannaCry, with 53,92%.

WannaCry is\nreplicated without any human interference and spreads from one computer to others on the same\nnetwork. A global WannaCry attack targeting healthcare organisations started in May 2017 and\nmanaged to infect more than 200.000 computers spread in 150 countries[474], including systems of the\nNational Health Services of Great Britain[496]. It was estimated that more than 312 ransom payments\nwere made for WannaCry attacks[497]. The Boeing aircraft manufacturing company suffered a\nWannaCry attack in March 2018[498]. In many cases, WannaCry has been used by regimes in search of\nfunding in foreign currency or in cryptocurrency [490].\n\n  - **GandCrab was used for the first time in January 2018 and infected more than 50.000 systems in less**\nthan a month. Since then, GandCrab is taking the lead on ransomware attacks; it was the secondhighest detected ransomware globally from March to July 2018[499]. It operates similarly to Locky[481] and\nJaff[481], as it is based on malicious macros hidden in files which in turn are delivered as email\n\n494 https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q2-2018-statistics/87170/, accessed November 2018.\n\n495 https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-sep-2018.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n496 https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/WannaCry-ransomware, accessed November 2018.\n\n497 https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/hu_hu/campaigns/security-hub/pdf/acr-2018.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n498 https://lp.skyboxsecurity.com/rs/440-MPQ-510/images/Skybox_Report_Vulnerability_Threat_Trends_2018_MidYear_Update.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n499 https://threatpost.com/gandcrabs-rotten-eggs-hatch-ransomware-in-south-korea/136689/, accessed November\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nattachments. However, the GandCrab ransom payments are done on Dash rather than on Bitcoin\ncryptocurrency[480]. GandCrab has been developed based on the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\nmodel and allows the developers and criminals to share the profit[500]. GandCrab targeted mostly\nScandinavian and English-speaking countries[501].\n\n- **NotPetya or Nyetya first arrived in June 2017. It is a combination of the EternalBlue and the**\nEternalRomance exploits and it also includes a credential harvesting code[476]. NotPetya was first\nunleashed in the Ukraine infecting more than 1 million computers in 2.000 different companies[497].\nNotPetya in most cases was used as a disk wiper after stealing data, disguising the attacker’s true\nmotive: the data[490].\n\n- **SamSam, a highly sophisticated ransomware that first appeared in 2015, is still used with high**\namounts of money stolen as ransom. The attackers using SamSam are specifically keen on hiding any\ndigital trace of their actions and avoid investigation. The SamSam encryption tool renders thoroughly\nthe victim’s data files and in most cases, the recovery is impossible even by reimaging or reinstalling\nthe software. More than US $6 million where lost due to SamSam in India during these past three\nyears[502]. SamSam incidents affected healthcare and government organizations in 2018 such as the city\nof Atlanta (US $17 million damage in recovery cost), the LabCorp. and the Colorado Department of\nTransportation (US $1,5 million damage in recovery costs)[503].\n\n- **Lokibot is a banking Trojan and info-stealer targeting smart mobile devices with Android OS.**\nHowever, Lokibot is also used for ransomware on mobiles because it allows the attacker to lock the\ndevice.

This threat typically targets industrial sectors, critical and strategic infrastructures across\nthe world including government entities, railways, telecommunication providers, energy companies,\nhospitals and banks[513,514,515]. Cyberespionage focuses on driving geopolitics, stealing state and trade\nsecrets, intellectual property rights and proprietary information in strategic fields. It also mobilises actors\nfrom the economy, industry, foreign intelligence services, as well as actors who work on their\nbehalf[516,517,518,519,520,521]. In a recent report[517], threat intelligence analysts were not surprised to learn that\n71% of the organizations are treating cyber espionage and other threats as a \"black box\" and are still\ngrowing and expanding their knowledge over them.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the number of nation-state-sponsored cyberattacks that focused primarly on\nthe economy has grown, and is likely to continue this way. In detail, nation-state-sponsored and other\nadversary-driven attacks on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are increasing in the utilities, oil and\nnatural gas (ONG), and manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, advanced persistent threat (APT)\ncyberattacks indicate that many financial attacks are motivated by espionage. Using tactics, techniques\nand procedures (TTPs) akin to their espionage counterparts, groups such as Cobalt Group, Carbanak and\nFIN7 have allegedly been targeting large financial institutions and restaurant chains successfully.\n\n###### 3.15.2 Interesting points\n\nThe identified interesting points[516,517,522] for cyber espionage are as follows:\n\n  - The European Parliament’s Committee of the Foreign Affairs calls the Member States to establish a\ncyber defence unit[523] and to jointly work on their common defence[524]. The US President Trump calls\non “proactive offensive tactics” regarding the Homeland security[544].\n\n513 http://wef.ch/risks2018\n\n514 https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-23-2018-en.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n515 https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-18/black-hat-intel-where-cybersecurity-stands.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n516 https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n517 https://www.accenture.com/t20180803T064557Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-83/Accenture-CyberThreatscape-Report-2018.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n518 https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/opinion/midterm-electionsrussia.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FCyberwarfare&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=st\nream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=collection, accessed November 2018.\n\n519 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/17/theresa-may-to-urge-eu-leaders-to-take-action-oncyber-attacks, accessed November 2018.\n\n520 https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-hacking-cyber-spies-espionage, accessed November 2018.\n\n521 https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-raises-red-flags-on-chinas-cyber-espionage/, accessed November 2018.\n\n522 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/content/files/ncsc_2018-annual-review.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n523 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-20170492+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN, accessed November 2018.\n\n524 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+COMPARL+PE625.376+01+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&language=EN, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- Cyber espionage groups and tools are becoming increasingly attractive among government officials\nforming a new open-market area[525].\n\n- Vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) generate interest among nation-states to support cyber-espionage activities\nthrough exploitation. A recent report disclosed a letter from the Israeli government addressed to USbased exploit developers inquiring about “advanced Vulnerabilities R&D and zero-day exploits for the\nuse of its law enforcement and security agencies for a wide variety of target platforms and\ntechnologies”[526].\n\n- Nation-states use various means to anonymise attacks making attribution extremely difficult.\n\n- Threat actors motivated by financial, political, or ideological gain will increasingly focus attacks on\nsupplier networks with weaker cybersecurity programs. Cyber espionage adversaries have slowly\nshifted their attack patterns to exploiting third- and fourth-party supply chain partners.\n\n- Software supply chain infiltration threatens the critical infrastructure sector and is poised to threaten\nother sectors.\n\n- Weak foreign laws could enable Intellectual Property theft. For example, when US companies do\nbusiness in China then valuable company data is stored in China and government approval is required\nprior to transferring this data outside China. Another example is Russia who demands source code\nreviews for all foreign technology being sold inside the country.\n\n- According to the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), state-sponsored hackers employed by\nhostile nations carry out most of the attacks. They are also tackling several phishing sites targeting\nBritish consumers.\n\n- The UK has developed a new categorisation framework to ensure that the appropriate handler\nmanages an incident: C1 attacks are national emergencies; C2 attacks can have a serious impact on a\nlarge portion of the population, economy or government; C3 attacks can have a serious impact on a\nlarge organisation or wider government; C4 attacks could threaten a medium-sized organisation; C5\nattacks include threats to a small organisation; C6 attacks on individuals and the response would be\nled by law enforcement agencies, such as the local police force.\n\n- The United States is projected to be a net oil and gas exporter by 2022 and if this projection comes to\nfruition, the United States will directly compete with Russia in the European market. Russian state\nactors could sponsor disruptive or espionage-related cyber operations or support hacktivists in the\nname of protecting the environment to contain this new competition in one of the largest energy\nmarket.\n\n- Newly imposed sanctions on Iran are likely to push the country to intensify state-sponsored\ncyberthreat activities in pursuit of its geopolitical and strategic objectives at a regional level,\nparticularly if Iran fails to keep its European counterparts committed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan\nof Action (JCPOA) agreement.\n\n525 https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gy8gmb/area-surveillance-tech-european-police-congress, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n526 [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/neqkgm/israel-zero-days-letter-to-american-hackers, accessed](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/neqkgm/israel-zero-days-letter-to-american-hackers)\nNovember 2018\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### 3.15.3 Trends and main statistics\n\nAs figure 41 illustrates, cyber espionage decreased overall by ca. 2% in 2018[527].\n\n**Figure 41: Distribution of attack motivations (2017-2018)[528]**\n\n- 66% of the oil and natural gas (ONG) IT managers said digitisation has made them more vulnerable to\nespionage compromises[517].\n\n- China, Russia, and Iran stand out as 3 of the most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic\nespionage[516,517].\n\n- 87% of the security professionals believe that recent activity emanating from Russia, China, and North\nKorea has made U.S. enterprise data less secure[515].\n\n- 43% of the security professionals believe that a potential attack by large nation-states is the greatest\nthreat to US critical infrastructure[515].\n\n- The time spent by security professionals preventing attacks from cyber espionage or surveillance by\nforeign governments or competitors decreased from 6% (2017) to 3% (2018)[515]. For the same threat, the\nprofessionals’ concern has also decreased from 11% (2017) to 9% (2018)[515].\n\n- Operational technology (OT) networks of industrial enterprises is a field of glory for espionage threat\nactors. These actors use remote administrator tools (RATs) which are already installed in the industrial\ncontrol systems (ICS). A recent report[529] reveals the top 20 countries in which RATs were used at least\nonce on espionage incidents during the H1 of 2018.\n\n527 https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018-master-table/, accessed November 2018.\n528 [https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018-master-table/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018-master-table/)\n\n529 https://securelist.com/threats-posed-by-using-rats-in-ics/88011/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Figure 42: RAT on ICS computers vs. total computers (top 20 countries in H1 2018)[530]**\n\n_The overall trend for cyber espionage in 2018 is DECREASING._\n\n**527,531**\n\n###### 3.15.4 Top cyberespionage attacks \n\n    - **ZooPark is a cyber espionage operation which targets Android users in Asia and Middle East.

Several generations of this espionage malware are active since June 2015. ZooParck\nincidents during the reporting are associated with the independence referendum in Kurdistan and\nfocused on victims in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran[532].\n\n    - **FIN7 (also known as, Carbanak group and Cobalt) cyber espionage threat-group continues to**\ninnovate, but it has been less active in 2018 compared with previous years.

Also, the PRB Backdoor, which targets companies in Egypt,\nmatching previous threat-actor interest in civil aviation organizations in the region. The OopsIE trojan\nhas the ability to execute remote commands and to upload and download files from the victim\nsystem[517]. New ISMDoor variants appeared in early 2018; these variants included an information\nstealer and a remote administration tool (RAT)[517].\n\n- **Unofficial Android marketplaces, such as Myket, use malware families to attack using update lures.**\nThese have been mostly targeting users of messaging and social media platforms (such as Telegram,\nTwitter, and Facebook). It is an Iranian espionage campaign discovered in 2018[517].\n\n- **TEMP.Periscope (or else “Leviathan”) cyber espionage group escalates its detected activity targeting**\nengineering and maritime entities, especially those connected to South China issues during March\n2018. This advantage includes the utilisation of a large library of malware including AIRBREAK,\nBADFLICK, PHOTO, HOMEFRY, LUNCHMONEY, MURKYTOP, China Chopper, and Beacon[533.]\n\n- **Operation Parliament attackers’ acts involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial**\nbodies, military and intelligence agencies and large trading companies around the world, especially\nthe Middle East and North Africa.

In most cases, common spreading and infecting methods, such as phishing, are used. For\nmore details about attack vectors, please see chapter 5.\n\n###### 3.15.6 Specific mitigation actions \n\nDue to the comprehensive nature of this threat, several mitigation measures found in other threats of this\nreport could be employed. The following advice[517,546,547,548] proposes baseline mitigation controls for this\nthreat:\n\n  - Hire talented individuals to manage and support AI-based technologies at the upstream level.\n\n  - Identify mission critical roles in the organisation and estimate their exposure to espionage risks.\nEspionage risks are being evaluated based on business information (i.e. business intelligence).\n\n  - Create security policies that accommodate human resource, business and operational security\ncontrols to cater for risk mitigation. This will include rules and practices for awareness raising,\ncorporate governance and security operations.\n\n  - Establish corporate practices to communicate, train and apply the developed rules and keep\noperational parts up and running.\n\n  - Develop an evaluation criterion (KPI) to benchmark the operation and adapt it to upcoming changes.\n\n  - Implement whitelisting development for critical application services, depending on the risk level\nassessed.\n\n  - Conduct regular vulnerability assessment and patching of used software, especially for systems that\nare in the perimeter.\n\n  - Implement a need-to-know principle for access rights definition and establish controls to monitor\nmisuse of privileged profiles.\n\n  - Implement a content filtering solution for all inbound and outbound channels (e.g. email, web,\nnetwork traffic).\n\n###### 3.15.7 Kill Chain \n\nKill chain is not relevant for this threat: this is a “composite” threat consists of many cyberthreats\nspanning all the phases of the kill chain, just as data breaches.\n\n544 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf, accessed November\n2018.\n\n545 https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-authorizes-offensive-cyber-operations-todeter-foreign-adversaries-bolton-says/2018/09/20/b5880578-bd0b-11e8-b7d20773aa1e33da_story.html?utm_term=.4e24594c7ab2, accessed November 2018.\n\n546 www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_DBIR_2017_Report_en_xg.pdf, accessed November 2018.\n\n547 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/rp_data-breach-digest-2018-cloud-storming_xg_en.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n548 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/rp_data-breach-digest-2018-credential-theft_xg_en.pdf, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### 3.15.8 Authoritative references \n\n“Internet Security Threat Report”, Symantec[514]; “Where Cybersecurity Stands”, Blackhat[515]; “Foreign\nEconomic Espionage in Cyberspace”, National Counterintelligence and Security Centre[516]; “Cyber\nThreatscape Report”, Accenture[517]; “Annual Review”, National Cyber Security Centre[522]; “Suspected\nChinese Cyber Espionage Group Targeting U.S. Engineering and Maritime Industries”, FireEye[533].\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n###### Visualising changes in the current threat landscape\n\nThis chapter provides a visualization of the changes assessed in 2018’s landscape in comparison with the\nprevious year (see table 4).

Threat Agents\n\n###### Threat agents and trends\n\nThreat agent matters have been one of the most interesting areas of the 2018’s threat landscape. Albeit\nuntil the middle of 2018 developments in this area advanced, they did so in analogy to the increasing\nmaturity of CTI practices. Around the end of the year, however, we have seen some quantum leap results\nin attributions[549,550]. These developments were mostly caused by increasing efforts to tackle terrorism[551],\nbut also by the increasing preparedness to politically and diplomatically thematise subliminal activities of\ncountries towards cyber-warfare and cyber-espionage. Numerous politically motivated initiatives came to\namplify the appetite of governments in looking into underground operations of opponents and use them\nwithin international diplomacy campaigns to accomplish their objectives[552,553].\n\nAs in other domains of CTI, the developments observed in the area of threat agents are due to a widening\nof the scope of cyberthreat intelligence to other related areas such as threat intelligence and generic\nintelligence. Definitely, the role of LEAs within cybersecurity operations but also the increasing role of\nNational Cyber Security Centres has contributed towards enhancing CTI’s scope. Moreover, it became\napparent that the impact of cyber-incidents affects the physical space. This has led inevitably to the\nmanifestation of the importance of attribution. Hence, the identification of threat agents has become a\ncentral element in cyberthreat mitigation.\n\nBy looking at the trends/advancements in the areas of threat agents from the defenders point of view, it\nis noticeable that:\n\n    - In 2018 we have seen approaches aiming at a better understanding of the “attacker perspective”[554].\nSuch approaches are based on the visualisation of the motives and identification of methods (TTPs)\nand modus operandi encountered in series of attacks[555]. Given the existence of recurring threat agent\nbehaviours (methods, tools and tactics), this approach leads to good rates of recognition of kind and\norigin of threat agents.\n\n    - In 2018 there have been increasing efforts to penetrate the infrastructure of threat agents. By using\nintelligence, some actors try to create trustful personas allowing them to enter into hacker fora[556].\nMoreover, various nation state organisations try to hack back to be in the position to monitor actions\n\n549 [https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/10/05/russia-spies-chance-pkg-sitroom-vpx.cnn, accessed October](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/10/05/russia-spies-chance-pkg-sitroom-vpx.cnn)\n2018.\n550 [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-russia/moscow-protests-russians-arrest-in-oslo-norwegians-seal-off-](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-russia/moscow-protests-russians-arrest-in-oslo-norwegians-seal-off-room-in-parliament-idUSKCN1M41F6)\n[room-in-parliament-idUSKCN1M41F6, accessed October 2018.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-russia/moscow-protests-russians-arrest-in-oslo-norwegians-seal-off-room-in-parliament-idUSKCN1M41F6)\n551 [https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/370748-new-defense-strategy-requires-paradigm-shift-in-us-](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/370748-new-defense-strategy-requires-paradigm-shift-in-us-counterterrorism)\n[counterterrorism, accessed October 2018.](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/370748-new-defense-strategy-requires-paradigm-shift-in-us-counterterrorism)\n552 [http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/russland-und-die-hacker-die-zeit-der-diplomatie-ist-vorbei-a-](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/russland-und-die-hacker-die-zeit-der-diplomatie-ist-vorbei-a-1232006.html)\n[1232006.html, accessed October 2018.](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/russland-und-die-hacker-die-zeit-der-diplomatie-ist-vorbei-a-1232006.html)\n553 [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/11/obamaera_cyber_detente_with_china_is_well_and_truly_over/,](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/11/obamaera_cyber_detente_with_china_is_well_and_truly_over/)\naccessed October 2018.\n554 [https://blog.barracuda.com/2018/09/10/gaining-the-attacker-perspective/, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.barracuda.com/2018/09/10/gaining-the-attacker-perspective/)\n555 [https://www.orange-business.com/en/blogs/hacker-personas-inside-mind-cybercriminal, accessed October](https://www.orange-business.com/en/blogs/hacker-personas-inside-mind-cybercriminal)\n2018.\n556 [https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/spy-on-spy-hacking-into-the-darknet/, accessed October](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/spy-on-spy-hacking-into-the-darknet/)\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nof threat agents and/or disrupt their infrastructures[557]. Finally, through the combination of\ncyberthreat intelligence and intelligence skills, some impressive successes regarding unveiling of state\nsponsored agents have been achieved[558,559].\n\n- Efforts to simulate threat agent tactics have been assessed in 2018. Via a series of tools, cybersecurity\ncompanies try to enhance awareness and preparedness of their customers in defending a cyberattack[560,561]. Though not directly related to threat agents, this approach may contribute towards less\nsuccessful threat agent activities.\n\n- Cyberthreat Intelligence experts have underlined inefficiencies of defending strategies based on the\nkill-chain[562]. In particular, defender activities are mostly triggered at a late stage of the kill-chain[563],\nthat is, after the adversaries have performed the infiltration of the target. In other words, defence is\nbased on the late phases of the kill-chain (i.e. command and control, action on objectives), while\ndefence in the early phases are often neglected in the defence strategies (i.e. reconnaissance,\nweaponization, delivery, exploitation and installation).\n\n2018 has also brought quite a few new developments from the side of threat agents:\n\n- It is assumed that traditional state sponsored threat agents are currently repositioning themselves in\nthe changing geopolitical space[564]: though activities of some groups seem to decrease, new types of\ncampaigns assigned to new actors may stem from known actors who have changed tactics and\ntargets, but they are using similar tools, malicious sites and vulnerabilities.\n\n- In 2018, attack tactics have shifted to malware-less attacks with email and impersonation attacks\nbeing the main infection vector[565]. In the enhanced threat agent capabilities belong time related\nattack tactics (e.g. kind of phishing according to week days), selective phishing via refined social\nengineering tactics, payload installed via remote access tools (e.g. Remote Desktop Protocol (RPD)\ninterfaces)[566], targeted attacks tailored to sectors, etc.[567].\n\n- Just as in 2018, the discovery of vulnerabilities continues increasing[568]. Until first half of 2018,\nvulnerabilities have reached an all year high and it is expected that 2018 in total will top all other\n\n557 [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/the-digital-vigilantes-who-hack-back, accessed October](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/the-digital-vigilantes-who-hack-back)\n2018.\n558 [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions)\n[and-millions, accessed October 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions)\n559 [https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2018/10/04/305-car-registrations-may-point-massive-gru-security-breach/,](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2018/10/04/305-car-registrations-may-point-massive-gru-security-breach/)\naccessed October 2018.\n560 [http://pentestit.com/adversary-emulation-tools-list/, accessed October 2018.](http://pentestit.com/adversary-emulation-tools-list/)\n561 [https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/how-a-breach-and-attack-simulation-bas-platform-can-help-financial-](https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/how-a-breach-and-attack-simulation-bas-platform-can-help-financial-organizations-to-be-better-protected/)\n[organizations-to-be-better-protected/, accessed October 2018.](https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/how-a-breach-and-attack-simulation-bas-platform-can-help-financial-organizations-to-be-better-protected/)\n562 [https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/, accessed October 2018.](https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/)\n563 [https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)\n564 [https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2018/86487/, accessed October 2018.](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2018/86487/)\n565 [https://www.itproportal.com/news/two-thirds-of-email-sent-in-2018-is-infected/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.itproportal.com/news/two-thirds-of-email-sent-in-2018-is-infected/)\n566 [https://diepresse.com/home/karriere/karrierenews/5388590/Ransomware_Hacker-haben-Vorgangsweise-](https://diepresse.com/home/karriere/karrierenews/5388590/Ransomware_Hacker-haben-Vorgangsweise-geaendert?from=rss)\n[geaendert?from=rss, accessed October 2018.](https://diepresse.com/home/karriere/karrierenews/5388590/Ransomware_Hacker-haben-Vorgangsweise-geaendert?from=rss)\n567 [https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Library/Documents/2018-Trustwave-Global-Security-Report/, accessed](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Library/Documents/2018-Trustwave-Global-Security-Report/)\nOctober 2018\n568 [https://meterpreter.org/risk-based-security-vulnerability-report/, accessed October 2018.](https://meterpreter.org/risk-based-security-vulnerability-report/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nyears. This trend has also positive effects[569]: in 2018, patching of vulnerabilities from software\nvendors has grown. Moreover, concepts such as vulnerability taxonomy are useful tools for end users\nto perform vulnerability-based mitigation[570].\n\n  - Threat agents introduce new methods for evading attribution and detection of attacks. File-less and\nmemory-resident threats as well as use of common attack tools seem to be efficient ways in achieving\nobjectives, while at the same time effectively hide their traits[571]. This a generic trend that is\nmanifested in various attack patterns on the one hand and the decline of activities of known threat\ngroups.\n\n  - Threat actors, especially advanced ones, are making progress in using the supply chain to achieve\ntheir objectives[572]. In 2018, a hardware attack has made headlines[573] and led to controversial\ndiscussions[574]. Despite this single incident, numerous supply chain attacks are assumed to take place,\nmainly launched by high capability agents[575]. Assessments hereto have led to the conclusion that\nsupply chain attacks are to be considered as a “key threat”.\n\nSome of the above points are taken up in the conclusions of this report (see chapter 6).\n\n###### Top threat agents and motives\n\nIn this chapter, we present an outline of top threat agent groups. It includes observations about their\nmotives and main trends assessed with regard to their capabilities. This is a complementary view to the\nthreat assessments (including tools, methods and tactics) presented within the top cyberthreats (see\nchapter 3) and the attack vectors (see chapter 5).\n\nBefore going into the developments in each particular threat agent group, it is necessary to explain the\ncomplex dynamics in this field. Increasing maturity in threat agent profiling demonstrates that the\ncharacteristics of the threat agent groups are in a permanent flow[576]. Albeit ideological matters may be\nthe main motives to let a person enter to whatever hacker group, personal developments, political\nenvironment, skills and monetary ambitions may be the drivers causing people to change their minds over\ntime. These forces may affect the motives of threat agents and make them change their group. Criminal\nprofiling may be the necessary tool to understand these shifts/changes. Though not applied in\nunderstanding cyberthreat agent group dynamics, these techniques start penetrating the threat\nlandscape[577]. It is expected that this trend will persist in the coming years and will further facilitate\nattribution.\n\n[569https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/statistics?adv_search=false&form_type=basic&results_type=statistics&search_t](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/statistics?adv_search=false&form_type=basic&results_type=statistics&search_type=all)\nype=all, accessed October 2018.\n570 [https://www.edgescan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/edgescan-stats-report-2018.pdf, accessed October](https://www.edgescan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/edgescan-stats-report-2018.pdf)\n2018.\n571 [https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/77041/apt/gallmaker-apt-emerges.html, accessed October 2018.](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/77041/apt/gallmaker-apt-emerges.html)\n572 [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-reports.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-reports.html)\n573 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-the-software-side-of-china-s-supply-chain-](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-the-software-side-of-china-s-supply-chain-attack)\nattack, accessed October 2018.\n574 [https://www.zdnet.com/article/dhs-and-gchq-join-amazon-and-apple-in-denying-bloomberg-chip-hack-story/,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dhs-and-gchq-join-amazon-and-apple-in-denying-bloomberg-chip-hack-story/)\naccessed October 2018.\n575 [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44941875, accessed October 2018.](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44941875)\n576 [https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/08/under-the-hoodie-why-money-power-and-ego-drive-](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/08/under-the-hoodie-why-money-power-and-ego-drive-hackers-to-cybercrime/)\n[hackers-to-cybercrime/, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/08/under-the-hoodie-why-money-power-and-ego-drive-hackers-to-cybercrime/)\n577 [https://pylos.co/2018/08/19/threat-profiling-and-adversary-attribution/, accessed October 2018.](https://pylos.co/2018/08/19/threat-profiling-and-adversary-attribution/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nJust as in previous threat landscapes, we consider the following threat agents’ groups: cyber-criminals,\ninsiders, cyber-spies, hacktivists, cyber-offenders, cyber-fighters, cyber-terrorists and script-kiddies. It\nshould be noted that the sequence of mentioning these actors is according to their engagement in the\nthreat landscape[578,579].\n\nThe assessed cyberthreat agent groups are as follows:\n\nIn 2018, Cyber-criminals remained the most active threat agent group in cyber-space. The activity of this\nthreat agent group increased from the previous year, being responsible for over 80% of the incidents[578].\nThe economics of cybercrime estimate that ca. 0,8% of the gross domestic product is impacted by this\nthreat agent group[580]. Overall, the activities of cybercriminals have demonstrated an increase in\ncomplexity and sophistication. On the top of used TTPs resides the propagation of malware through\nemails[581]. Over 60% of email traffic contained malicious content. Email was involved in more than 90% of\nthe cyber-attacks. Business email compromise (BEC) is responsible for a loss of over US $12 billion since\n2013[581]. A further new development regarding monetization in 2018 is the use of\ncyptojacking/cryptomining malware[579] and cryptocurrencies attacks[582]. In 2018, ca. US $880 million losses\nhave been attributed to cryptocurrencies attacks[583]. Although the losses are not attributed to\ncybercriminals only, there is a clear trend in 2018 of cybercriminals targeting cryptocurrencies. While\ncryptojacking/cryptomining has risen in 2018 to replace ransomware from the top of malware[584], the\nmonetisation achieved is not very high[585]. Another clear trend in cybercrime attacks in 2018 has been the\nrefinement of phishing by using social engineering techniques[586]. Remarkable are the trends towards\nattacking Software-as-a-Serice (SaaS), the rates of phishing using social engineering (tripled in 2018) and\nthe continuous innovation towards persuading users for the originality of phishing scams[587]. As regards to\ngeographical issues, cybercriminals still target mostly USA users with phishing attacks[586] with ca. 86% of\nregistered incidents. Despite the increase in attack complexity, simple/classic scams are still a popular\nmethod, since even low success rates allow penetration in targeted infrastructures. As a final element of\nthe dynamics of this threat agent group, one should mention the innovation trend of Cybercrime-as-aService platforms[579]. Besides improvements of offered services, these developments lead to a higher\nusability and popularity of these services. This may lead to more efficient attacks by all other threat agent\ngroups.\n\n578 [https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-statistics/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-statistics/)\n579 [https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2018)\n[iocta-2018, accessed October 2018.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2018)\n580 [https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252435439/Economic-impact-of-cyber-crime-is-significant-and-rising,](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252435439/Economic-impact-of-cyber-crime-is-significant-and-rising)\naccessed October 2018.\n581 [https://brica.de/alerts/alert/public/1229120/malware-less-email-attacks-increasingly-common-fireeye-finds/,](https://brica.de/alerts/alert/public/1229120/malware-less-email-attacks-increasingly-common-fireeye-finds/)\naccessed October 2018.\n582 [https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-security/crypto-thefts-drive-growth-of-global-coin-](https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-security/crypto-thefts-drive-growth-of-global-coin-money-laundering/64881793)\n[money-laundering/64881793, accessed October 2018.](https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-security/crypto-thefts-drive-growth-of-global-coin-money-laundering/64881793)\n583 [https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/77213/hacking/cyber-attacks-crypto-exchanges.html, accessed October](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/77213/hacking/cyber-attacks-crypto-exchanges.html)\n2018.\n584 [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cryptojacking-displaces-ransomware-as-top-malware-threat-a-11165,](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cryptojacking-displaces-ransomware-as-top-malware-threat-a-11165)\naccessed October 2018.\n585 [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/30/cryptojacking_pays_poorly/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/30/cryptojacking_pays_poorly/)\n586 [https://info.phishlabs.com/hubfs/2018%20PTI%20Report/PhishLabs%20Trend%20Report_2018-digital.pdf,](https://info.phishlabs.com/hubfs/2018%20PTI%20Report/PhishLabs%20Trend%20Report_2018-digital.pdf)\naccessed October 2018.\n587 [https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/phishing-campaign-uses-hijacked-emails-to-deliver-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/phishing-campaign-uses-hijacked-emails-to-deliver-ursnif-by-replying-to-ongoing-threads/)\n[ursnif-by-replying-to-ongoing-threads/, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/phishing-campaign-uses-hijacked-emails-to-deliver-ursnif-by-replying-to-ongoing-threads/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nThe insider threat (see also description as cyberthreat) is attributed to the threat agent group insider. This\ngroup consists of malicious and negligent insiders. Insiders may be users, privileged users and service\nproviders/contractors. According to reports analysed in 2018, this group is the second source of\ncompromise in the threat landscape after cybercriminals[567,588,589]. Breach statistics show that around 25%\nof incidents are attributed to insiders[588] in corporate environments. Yet, businesses perceive the insider\nthreat as being the most prevalent one, with 64% of them investing in deterrence measures against\ninsiders[590]. The difference in perception between the actual impact of actual insider misuse is causing\nnon-proportional security expenses to organisations w.r.t. the effect of the implemented controls.\nAssessments found in 2018 regarding insiders reveal that privilege misuse is the second source of\nincidents and miscellaneous errors are at the 6[th 591]. For the breaches resulting from these incidents,\nhowever, the sequence is inverted, that is, errors are leading to a higher number of breaches than\nprivilege misuse. This might be due to the higher exploitation of errors by adversaries of all types. While\nmonetization is the main motive of this threat agent group, most of the damage seems to be caused by\nunintentional actions of employees[592]. These being accidental disclosure of data (e.g. use of wrong email\naddresses), failures in recognising phishing attacks or misconfiguration errors[593]. Finally, it is worth\nmentioning that insider threat may directly or indirectly materialize in supply chain attacks[594,595].\n\nIn 2018, the activity of Nation States in cyberspace has been encountered multiple times in the\ninternational headlines. Undoubtedly, this was due to geopolitical developments/tensions among various\ncountries, such as China, USA, North Korea, Russia, Germany and UK, just to mention the most important\nones[596]. Hence, 2018 is the year where it becomes evident that cyberespionage has to be analysed by\ntaking into account diplomatic, military and geopolitical developments. Moreover, by further advancing\ntheir capabilities, nation states will continue bridging their cyber activities with all other affairs of national\nrelevance both within and outside the country. In 2018, we have seen these bridges being established by\ncoupling intelligence capabilities with threat and cyberthreat intelligence[559]. As regards the activity of this\nthreat agent group, 2018 has brought some noticeable changes. Firstly, it has been assessed that in 2018\nthe activity of some known threat agent groups has declined[578]. Yet, a comprehensive analysis of nationsponsored threat agents indicated that this inactivity may be explained as a step back towards\nreorganizing their infrastructures and tactics[597]. Given the high level of investments in this area and the\nneed to stay under the radar, this assumption seems to be plausible. Another interesting development in\n2018 was the attempt to increase impact of attacks. This has been manifested via high capability\ncampaigns aiming at destroying critical infrastructures[598].

Another trend of 2018 are attacks of\nstate sponsored agencies to banks, until now typical cybercrime targets[583]. It is assumed, that with such\nattacks nation states try to avoid the negative impact of sanctions restricting their access to international\ncurrencies[601]. Concluding the developments of this threat agent group, one has to mention a trend that\nhas been identified in 2018 regarding outsourcing of surveillance to foreign partners[602]. This trend may\nweaken governmental oversight over surveillance activities, thus causing additional, difficult to mitigate\nprivacy risks. As a final note, one should consider corporations using almost the same techniques as\nnation state agents. This is due to the vicinity of commercial organisations with strategic role in a country\nto state sponsored resources in order to obtain competitive knowledge from competitors[603].\n\n**Hacktivists continue their activity in 2018 at a similar pace as in the previous year[578]. They continue**\ndefacement campaigns based on target web sites and are using DDoS attacks to victims web services to\ndraw the attention of media. Driven by protest actions against political/geopolitical decisions affecting\nnational and international matters, hacktivists had in 2018 sufficient reasons to unfold their activities.\nWomen rights and gun violence have been some remarkable events that triggered protests[604]. Hacktivists\nstill perform cyber-activism as independent, loosely associated cells[605]. A comprehensive resource on\nhacktivists activities provides sufficient information on defacement techniques used[604,606]. According to\nthis report, the main defacement technique used is web site hacking. Through an extensive analysis of\nhacktivist activities over the last 18 years, the main techniques identified are SQL injection, unpatched\nsystem vulnerabilities and password stealing. Linux and Apache have been the main web platforms\ncompromised[607]. However, monetization is not the main motive behind hacktivist attacks, their access to\ncompromised web sites (ca. 10 Million) may be misused for this kind of motive. Similar incidents have\nbeen identified in the past[608]. This potential may create links to other threat agent groups aiming at profitdriven activities. Besides defacement, hacktivists are still active in disclosing confidential information\nfound in hacked web sites. Moreover, they are extensively using DDoS at tacks, especially due to the wide\navailability of this attack vector in underground markets. Hacktivism was the second motive as regards\nthe use of DDoS related attack vectors[609].\n\nIn 2018 we have not found sufficient reports on the motive Cyber Fighters per se, that is, on religiously\nmotivated groups. It seems that this motivation is currently being assumed to belong to Cyber Terrorists\n\n599 [https://www.darkreading.com/risk/take-(industrial)-control-a-look-at-the-2018-ics-threat-landscape/d/d-](https://www.darkreading.com/risk/take-(industrial)-control-a-look-at-the-2018-ics-threat-landscape/d/d-id/1332754)\n[id/1332754, accessed October 2018.](https://www.darkreading.com/risk/take-(industrial)-control-a-look-at-the-2018-ics-threat-landscape/d/d-id/1332754)\n600 [https://gbhackers.com/ics-systems-attacks/, accessed October 2018.](https://gbhackers.com/ics-systems-attacks/)\n601 [https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insights/security/cyber-threatscape-report-2018, accessed October 2018.](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insights/security/cyber-threatscape-report-2018)\n[602https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/24/state_agencies_outsource_surveillance_to_foreign_partners_says_ca](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/24/state_agencies_outsource_surveillance_to_foreign_partners_says_campaign_group/)\n[mpaign_group/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/24/state_agencies_outsource_surveillance_to_foreign_partners_says_campaign_group/)\n603 [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/chinas-cyber-spying-keeps-a-lot-of-us-tech-ceos-up-at-night.html, accessed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/chinas-cyber-spying-keeps-a-lot-of-us-tech-ceos-up-at-night.html)\nNovember 2018.\n604 [https://blog.trendmicro.com/graffiti-in-the-digital-world-how-hacktivists-use-defacement/, accessed October](https://blog.trendmicro.com/graffiti-in-the-digital-world-how-hacktivists-use-defacement/)\n2018.\n605 [https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/a-practical-method-of-identifying-cyberattacks.html, accessed](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/a-practical-method-of-identifying-cyberattacks.html)\nOctober 2018.\n606 [https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacktivism-web-defacement/, accessed October](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacktivism-web-defacement/)\n2018.\n607 [https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/web-defacements-exploring-the-methods-](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/web-defacements-exploring-the-methods-of-hacktivists)\n[of-hacktivists, accessed October 2018.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/web-defacements-exploring-the-methods-of-hacktivists)\n608 [http://www.indiandefensenews.in/2016/10/patriotic-indian-hackers-lock-pakistani.html, accessed October 2018.](http://www.indiandefensenews.in/2016/10/patriotic-indian-hackers-lock-pakistani.html)\n609 [https://www.netscout.com/report/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.netscout.com/report/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nand in some particular cases to state-sponsored actors[610]. This evidence has led us to merge Cyber\nFighters and Cyber Terrorists to a single group under the name of Cyber Terrorists. This decision is also\nseconded by the fact that the term Cyber Fighters is now associated with cyber defence groups that are\nmandated with the development of tactics related to cyber warfare defence[611]. Having said that, in 2018\ncyber and terrorism continue their convergence: terrorists continue using legitimate services to perform\npropaganda w.r.t. their efforts to recruit new members and perform fund rising to finance their\noperations. Together with the motive of performing cyber-attacks, monetisation and recruitment are the\nmain aims of this threat agent group[579]. It seems that defending cyber terrorism will require a tighter\ncooperation among law enforcement agencies, as well as public and private companies. The main concern\nwill be a better the scrutiny of social media (for recruitment and fund raining) for the identification of\nrogue actors[612]. Another important element is the observation of money flows, especially the ones\nregarding cryptocurrencies[579]. As regards cyber terrorist capabilities in performing cyber-attacks, it is\nbelieved that despite the existence of malicious tools in dark market, this threat agent group still\nmaintains low capabilities. Apparently, their ability to access cyber-attack knowledge remains at a low\nlevel[613]. Despite the assessed low level of capabilities, several states have put counterterrorism protection\non the agenda of state defence[614,615,616]. Given the availability of Crime-as-a-Service and the potential to\nrecruit hackers for their objectives, it is indicative that assessments show cyber terrorism picking up\nsignificantly in the years to come[617]. If seen in relation to weaknesses in industrial control systems (ICS)\nsystems, this predictions sound rather plausible[599,618].\n\nThe threat agent group script kiddies has been maintained in 2018’s assessments for a variety of reasons.\nFirstly, some incidents emanating from this threat agent group have been encountered in 2018[619,620].\nThough these incidents are just a minor part of the threat landscape, they clearly demonstrate the\npotential impact this threat agent group could may create. Secondly, the large amount of available tools\n\n610 [https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/)\n611 [https://www.icann.org/news/blog/engaging-with-the-new-generation-of-cyber-fighters, accessed October 2018.](https://www.icann.org/news/blog/engaging-with-the-new-generation-of-cyber-fighters)\n612 [https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/eu-plans-new-laws-to-target-terror-on-social-media-sites-1.762013,](https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/eu-plans-new-laws-to-target-terror-on-social-media-sites-1.762013)\naccessed October 2018.\n613 [https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-](https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2018.html)\n[assessment-netherlands-2018.html, accessed October 2018.](https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2018.html)\n614 [https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1076696/download, accessed October 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1076696/download)\n615 [https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/actualites/articles/les-manipulations-de-l-information-un-defi-pour-nos-](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/actualites/articles/les-manipulations-de-l-information-un-defi-pour-nos-democraties)\n[democraties, accessed October 2018.](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/actualites/articles/les-manipulations-de-l-information-un-defi-pour-nos-democraties)\n616 [http://www.basicint.org/publications/stanislav-abaimov-paul-ingram-executive-director/2017/hacking-uk-](http://www.basicint.org/publications/stanislav-abaimov-paul-ingram-executive-director/2017/hacking-uk-trident-growing-threat)\n[trident-growing-threat, accessed October 2018.](http://www.basicint.org/publications/stanislav-abaimov-paul-ingram-executive-director/2017/hacking-uk-trident-growing-threat)\n617 [https://www.raytheon.com/sites/default/files/2018-02/2018_Global_Cyber_Megatrends.pdf, accessed October](https://www.raytheon.com/sites/default/files/2018-02/2018_Global_Cyber_Megatrends.pdf)\n2018.\n618 [https://securelist.com/threat-landscape-for-industrial-automation-systems-in-h1-2018/87913/,](https://securelist.com/threat-landscape-for-industrial-automation-systems-in-h1-2018/87913/)\naccessed October 2018.\n619 [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/20/bitcoin_baron_gets_20_months/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/20/bitcoin_baron_gets_20_months/)\n620 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/19/british-15-year-old-gained-access-intelligence-operations-](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/19/british-15-year-old-gained-access-intelligence-operations-afghanistan/)\n[afghanistan/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/19/british-15-year-old-gained-access-intelligence-operations-afghanistan/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nand source code leakage bear the risk of misuse by minors[621,622,623,624]. Such tools may become a powerful\ninstrument in the hands of low capability groups. Moreover, when trying to quantify the available\nknowledge and striking power of script kiddies, one may have a look at various cyber security\nchallenges[625]: young individuals having some guidance may become very efficient in hacking. If taken as a\nmirror of capability levels that can be acquired by “entry level” hackers, these events are a clear indication\nat what levels a teenager may arrive when utilising existing tools. Though cyber-security challenges are\ndefinitely the right instruments to engage talented individuals, one should assume that not all hacking\nminors will be engaged in such events. These assumptions are funded by similar assessments in the cybersecurity community[626] and should be taken seriously by the cyber-security community.\n\n###### Threat Agents and top threats\n\nThe involvement of the above threat agents in the deployment of the identified top cyberthreats is\npresented in the table below (see table 5). The purpose of this table is to visualize which threat agent\ngroups are involved in which threats. This information is targeted towards stakeholders who are\ninterested in assessing possible threat agent involvement in the deployment of threats. This information\nmight be useful in identifying the capability level can be assumed behind the top threats and thus support\nin decisions concerning the strength of the security controls that are implemented to protect valuable\nassets. The table below is very similar to the one of ETL 2017[627], apart from some minor\nchanges/adaptations based on the engagement of threat agents in 2018’s incidents.\n\nThe table visualizes the various capability levels of various threat agent groups: threat agents who are the\nsource of many primary threat actions are the ones with higher capabilities, while with ones with more\nsecondary or no cyberthreat assignment are possess lower capabilities.\n\n621 [https://wccftech.com/new-tool-hacking-script-kiddies/, accessed October 2018.](https://wccftech.com/new-tool-hacking-script-kiddies/)\n622 [https://blog.newskysecurity.com/script-kiddie-nightmare-iot-attack-code-embedded-with-backdoor-](https://blog.newskysecurity.com/script-kiddie-nightmare-iot-attack-code-embedded-with-backdoor-39ebcb92a4bb)\n[39ebcb92a4bb, accessed October 2018.](https://blog.newskysecurity.com/script-kiddie-nightmare-iot-attack-code-embedded-with-backdoor-39ebcb92a4bb)\n623 [https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/subfinder-how-not-to-be-a-script-kiddie-567839e6ef55, accessed](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/subfinder-how-not-to-be-a-script-kiddie-567839e6ef55)\nOctober 2018.\n624 [http://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/02/03/new-tool-automatically-finds-hacks-vulnerable-internet-](http://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/02/03/new-tool-automatically-finds-hacks-vulnerable-internet-connected-devices/)\n[connected-devices/, accessed October 2018.](http://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/02/03/new-tool-automatically-finds-hacks-vulnerable-internet-connected-devices/)\n625 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/european-cyber-security-challenge-ecsc-2018, accessed October 2018.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/european-cyber-security-challenge-ecsc-2018)\n626 [https://www.uscybersecurity.net/script-kiddie/, accessed October 2018.](https://www.uscybersecurity.net/script-kiddie/)\n627 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2017, accessed October 2018.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2017)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n\n**THREAT AGENTS**\n\n\n**Cyber-** **Nation** **Cyber-**\n**Insiders** **Corporations** **Hacktivists**\n**criminals** **States** **terrorists**\n\n\n**Script**\n**kiddies**\n\n\n**Malware** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Web-based attacks** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Web application attacks** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Denial of Service** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Botnets** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Phishing** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Spam** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Ransomware** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Insider threat** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Physical manipulation / damage / theft / loss** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Exploit kits** `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Data breaches** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Identity theft** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Information leakage** `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Cyber espionage** `✓` `✓` `✓`\n\n**Legend:**\nPrimary group for threat: ✓\nSecondary group for threat: `✓`\n\n**Table 5: Involvement of threat agents in the top cyberthreats**\n\nIn this table, we differentiate between threats that are typically deployed through a group (primary group\nof a threat) and threats that are secondarily deployed by a group.

Attack Vectors\n\nThe deployment of the different cyberthreats assessed in the previous chapters is done by the use of one\nor more attack vectors.\n\n“Specifically, an attack vector is a path or means by which a threat agent can gain access to a computer or\n_network server, abuse weaknesses or vulnerability on assets (including human) in order to achieve a_\n_specific outcome”[628]._\n\nThe description of an attack vector is essential in order to understand the various tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTP) used by threat agents described earlier. It gives a structured way for threat analysts to\ndescribe a threat agent’s behaviour and defenders to implement appropriate defences, following a\n“Course of Action”.\n\nIn this ETL report, the primary attack vectors identified in various security incidents have been categorised\nin a taxonomy presented in topic 5.1. Attack vectors analysed in previous ENISA Threat Landscapes are\nstill valid. To this extent, the current chapter provides additional vectors that have been encountered in\nthe reporting period.\n\nOut of the sum of encountered attack vectors, three attack vectors are analysed in this report, namely\n“Misinformation/Disinformation”, “Web and browser-based attack vectors” and “Fileless or memory_based attacks”. The last section of this chapter reviews current trends with attack vectors encountered in_\nmodular and multi-staged threats.\n\n###### Attack vectors taxonomy for this year’s threat landscape\n\nThe list below provides a categorization of the most predominant and noteworthy attack vectors\nobserved by ENISA throughout the year.

The range of methods used includes\npropaganda, deception, misinformation/disinformation and other non-conventional tactics that have long\nbeen used to destabilise adversaries in the physical space. What is new about the attacks seen in recent\nyears is their transposition to cyberspace, hence their speed, scale and intensity, facilitated by rapid\ntechnological change and global interconnectivity.\n\nThis type of attacks has highly targeted business and individuals.

Most fake news stories that appear on social media originate from those\nfake news sites[631].\n\nThe analysis of attack vectors used in misinformation/disinformation campaigns highlights the growing\nimportance that this cyber capability plays in the threat landscape.\n\n**_Online trolling – The definition of online trolling is the practice of behaving in a deceptive, destructive or_**\ndisruptive manner using internet platforms (social media, messaging and blogs) with no apparent\ninstrumental purpose.\n\n**_The online spread of fake news – Online fake news consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes_**\nspreading via online platforms. Attackers can amplify their content and messages using social media,\nclickbait, and advertising. Furthermore, access to data and analytics on content performance and visitor\ndemographics enable the accessibility of targets and hone the viral nature of the launched messages.\n\n**_The abuse of social media and search engines algorithms - Algorithms are processes in (computational)_**\ncalculations and/or operations. Social media and search engines use various algorithms to predict what\nusers are interested in seeing and generate user engagement. Based on a user's habits and history of\nclicks, shares and likes, algorithms filter and prioritise the content that the user receives.

Since then, malicious cryptomining has been considered as a top\nthreat, added into the top 15 in this year’s ETL report. Cryptomining refers to a process in which, each\ntime a cryptocurrency transaction is made, a miner is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of\ninformation and updating the blockchain digital ledger, in return of a financial reward. Basically, cybercriminals use their victims’ resources such as computing power, connectivity, and electrical power by\nexploiting their web browser to perform mining operations. More information about cryptojacking can be\nfound in chapter 3.13.\n\nA simple cryptokacking attack is illustrated below:\n\n**Figure 44: A cryptojacking attack**\n\n**Example security incidents related to this attack vector:**\n\n  - Researchers discovered[636] a new Linux crypto-miner botnet dubbed PyCryptoMiner spreading over\nSSH. The Monero miner botnet is based on Python and leverages Pastebin as command and control\nserver when the original C&C isn’t available. If all C&C servers of the botnet are not accessible, all\nnewly infected bots are idle, polling for the botmaster’s Pastebin page.\n\n  - The Blackberry Mobile site was hacked exploiting a vulnerability of Magento.

Fileless\nattacks are capable of gaining control of computers without downloading any malicious files.\n\nCharacteristics of a fileless attack:\n\n  - Has no identifiable code or signature that allows typical antivirus tools to detect it. It also does not\nhave a particular behaviour; therefore, heuristics scanners cannot detect it.\n\n  - Lives in the computer's RAM.\n\n  - Uses processes that are native to the operating system in order to carry out the attack.\n\n  - Can be paired with other malware.\n\n  - Able to circumvent application whitelisting. Fileless malware takes advantage of approved\napplications that are already in the system.\n\n  - May include a “dropper” or a script used in early attack stages for malware installation and for a wide\nvariety of post-exploitation activities.\n\nA simple fileless attack is illustrated below:\n\n[638https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Campaign+is+using+a+recently+released+WebLogic+exploit+to+deploy+a+Mon](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Campaign+is+using+a+recently+released+WebLogic+exploit+to+deploy+a+Monero+miner/23191/)\n[ero+miner/23191/, accessed November 2018.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Campaign+is+using+a+recently+released+WebLogic+exploit+to+deploy+a+Monero+miner/23191/)\n639 [https://www.scmagazine.com/researchers-spotted-malware-coin-miners-in-malvertising-](https://www.scmagazine.com/researchers-spotted-malware-coin-miners-in-malvertising-campaigns/article/736315/)\n[campaigns/article/736315/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.scmagazine.com/researchers-spotted-malware-coin-miners-in-malvertising-campaigns/article/736315/)\n640 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/ news/security/linux-and-windows-servers-targeted-with-rubyminermalware/, accessed November 2018.\n641 https://www.scmagazine.com/millions-of-machines-download-xmrig-cryptominer-after-users-click-on-deviouslinks/article/739594/, accessed November 2018.\n642 https://www.symantec.com/blogs/feature-stories/your-next-big-security-worry-fileless-attacks, accessed\nNovember 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n**Figure 45: A fileless attack**\n\n**Example security incidents related to this attack vector:**\n\n  - In January 2018, security researchers uncovered[643] a campaign, dubbed Operation PowerShell\nOlympics, targeting organizations involved in the South Korea winter games, with the aim to control\nthe infected machines.

The CactusTorch fileless malware executes\nand loads malicious .NET files straight via the memory.\n\n**Related cyberthreats:**\n\nMalware, ransomware, malicious scripts and data breach.\n\n###### Multi-staged and modular threats\n\nRecent trends in multi-staged and modular malware attacks reveal how this type of attack is becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated, versatile and persistent. VPNFilter, BlackEnergy, and CobInt are good examples\nof this type of attack. It uses different vectors, depending on a pre-assessment conducted to the victim’s\ninfrastructure, to initiate the attack. The VPNFilter, for example, is able to support the collection of\nintelligence about the victim and from the analysis, download additional malware to shape the attack\ndynamically.\n\nList of known capabilities for multi-staged and modular threats:\n\n  - Self-propagates,\n\n643 [https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-target-winter-olympics-with-new-custom-built-fileless-malware/,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-target-winter-olympics-with-new-custom-built-fileless-malware/)\naccessed November 2018.\n644 https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/powerghost-a-stealthy-miner-with-eternal-blue-component-forspreading-further/, accessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- Self-destructs,\n\n- Communicates anonymously,\n\n- Behaves persistently,\n\n- Obfuscates the origin,\n\n- Downloads payloads and\n\n- Installs in memory.\n\nIn July 2018, security researchers described VPNFilter as a sophisticated malware affecting 500,000\nnetworking devices.[645]. The malware - initially affecting Ukrainian hosts - spread over 54 countries at an\nalarming rate. Researchers attributed this malware to a Russian state-sponsored hacking group Sofacy\n(also known as Fancy Bear and APT28).\n\nThe versatile and persistent behaviour of this malware on networking devices generated great concern\namong security professionals and authorities around the world. In its multi-stage and modular\ncapabilities, it is able to support the collection of intelligence, misattribution and destructive cyberattack\noperations. Moreover, it has a range of capabilities including data exfiltration, spying on traffic and\nultimately rendering the infected device unbootable.

Conclusions\n\n###### Main CTI-related cyber-issues ahead\n\nThis chapter summarizes the CTI-related issues that have been identified during the 2018’s threat\nassessments. They are either related directly to the assessed threats or they are consequences of those\nassessments. Moreover, some of those issues arise from experiences from the state-of-the-art in CTI, as\nthey have been communicated/discussed within various interactions with CTI-practitioners. As opposed\nto some potentially interesting/valuable sources of threat predictions[646,647,648,649], this chapter does not\nprovide any predictions per se. Instead, it consolidates identified needs that have to be performed in\norder to enhance efficiency of CTI. These activities are a consequence of the current threat landscape and\nthe current CTI practices. Although some causality may be evident in the sequence of the points below,\nthey are not listed according to any priority scheme, nor having any a weighting factor in mind. The issues\nmentioned below imply the conclusions provided in the forthcoming chapter (see chapter 6.2). They have\nbeen categorised according to their relevance with policy, business and technical matters.\n\nIn the reporting period, it has been assessed that state-sponsored agents are allegedly changing attack\n**practices. They shifted their modus operandi towards lower levels of infrastructure components. This is**\nbeing implemented through both hardware abuse and compromise of general-purpose components that\nare often outside the protection zones of organizations, such as ISPs, information brokers, cloud\nproviders, network management services, etc. Just this year, several governments[650,651] introduced a ban\nand campaigned against the involvement of tech-giants such as Huawei and ZTE in building their 5G\ninfrastructure, under the pretext of posing serious risks to their national security. Another element of\ntheir novel attack tactics includes targeted attacks at the user level: through social engineering, effective\nspear phishing attacks are being crafted. These changes in attack methods render sophisticated and\nexpensive network intrusion methods obsolete and can be implemented with commonly available\ntechniques and procedures. At the same time, their operations are difficult to spot, as they fall into the\nvast mass of attacks originated from other threat agents such as cybercriminals and hacktivists. These\ndevelopments make evident that detection and mitigation methods for these types of attacks need to be\naccordingly adapted.\n\nNon-targeted threats spreading contagiously in the cyberspace tend to last longer (or not to disappear at\nall). This is mainly due to the reduced adoption by individuals and organizations of cyber hygiene practices\n(cryptographic keys and user credentials protection, etc.), adherence to good security practices (revised\nsecurity policies, two face authentication (2FA), etc.) and systems still operating without any security\nupdates, to name a few. The same is valid to justify the lengthy time taken by many organizations to\nacknowledge and respond to an incident. This situation urges organizations to include cybersecurity into\n**their risk management functions and identify clear strategies to anticipate and/or respond to crises.**\n\n646 [https://securelist.com/kaspersky-security-bulletin-threat-predictions-for-2019/88878/, accessed November 2018.](https://securelist.com/kaspersky-security-bulletin-threat-predictions-for-2019/88878/)\n647 [https://www.csoonline.com/article/3322221/security/9-cyber-security-predictions-for-2019.html, accessed](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3322221/security/9-cyber-security-predictions-for-2019.html)\nNovember 2018.\n648 [https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/blog/cyber-threat-predictions-2018.html, accessed November 2018.](https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/blog/cyber-threat-predictions-2018.html)\n649 [https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n[predictions.html, accessed November 2018.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/the-evolving-threat-landscape---looking-at-our-2018-predictions.html)\n650 [https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/australia-bans-huawei-and-zte-from-supplying-technology-for-its-5g-](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/australia-bans-huawei-and-zte-from-supplying-technology-for-its-5g-network/)\n[network/, accessed November 2018.](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/australia-bans-huawei-and-zte-from-supplying-technology-for-its-5g-network/)\n651 [https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/24/us-huawei-warning-5g/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/24/us-huawei-warning-5g/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nDue to increased automation of many attack vectors, end-users are under permanent exposure to a vast\n**number of attacks[652]. Given the weak protection in many end-user systems, it is likely that targeted**\nindividuals may experience a successful attack. The existing gap in cybersecurity knowledge and CTI in\nparticular, makes affected end-users feel left alone with the mitigation of impact from successful attacks.\nIt is imperative to close this gap by disseminating related knowledge to all intermediate elements in the\ndelivery of services. CTI is definitely an important missing element in the protection of the entire chain of\nservice delivery. New models of CTI knowledge delivery and automated means of cyberthreat mitigation\nare necessary in order to bridge this gap. Otherwise, the trust of end-users is at risk, especially when\nmonetary impact is caused by successful attacks. An increasing number of such incidents have been\nencountered in the reporting period[653,654].\n\nThe above is also true for SMEs: the complexity of cyberthreats is raising with the combination of multiple\npayloads and stages, scalable architecture and a combination of a variety of delivery vectors in one single\nattack. Cyber criminals are also combining technical and non-technical attack vectors to make their\ncampaigns more effective. The diversity of profiles, skills and competencies required to formulate and\n**implement a complete end-to-end cyber security strategy goes beyond the capabilities of the great**\n**majority of small and medium organizations. Novel and affordable solutions will be required to automate**\nmany of the time-consuming manual tasks. Such solutions may be implemented via threat intelligence\ndriven Managed Security Services or via seamless integration of threat intelligence services into enddevice security solutions (i.e. CTI-as-a-Service).\n\n**Cybersecurity awareness and knowledge flows are often failing in the transitions between domains of**\n**responsibility. Variations in terminology, understanding of requirements and variating speed of relevant**\nmanagement cycles are the most common grounds for these failures. Numerous techniques have been\nidentified to avoid such failures. These include the better interconnection among the various\ncybersecurity stakeholders, the better identification of “crown jewels”, the use of horizon scanning\nactivities and the use of scenarios as basis for cybersecurity assessments. Other factors enabling better\nknowledge flows are sectorial cybersecurity assessments, more targeted reporting and better sharing\npractices of relevant information. Nonetheless, in cases of distributed governance[655] it is necessary to\nimplement measures that allow for the formulation of coordinated incentives, common understanding of\nstrategic objectives and strategic requirements. It is clear that in those cases, the effort of connecting to\nstakeholders and anticipating the multiple perspectives involved in decision-making processes is key to\nsuccess.\n\nCybercrime is reportedly originated from geographies with less restrictive laws/regulations to combat and\nprevent illegal activities outside their countries. The future protection of the digital economy, of a free\nand open Internet and transnational cybercrime reduction will require more effort for coordinated cyber**diplomacy, LEA and defence cooperation, enforcing the international law in cyberspace and create**\n**homogeneous regulatory geographies. Current activities in this direction are indicative of the importance**\nof this issue. Yet, the abstention of some key cyberspace actors from those initiatives is a source of\n\n652 https://www-05.ibm.com/dk/think[copenhagen/assets/pdf/Koncertsalen_Abning_5_SteveCowley_Presentation.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://www-05.ibm.com/dk/think-copenhagen/assets/pdf/Koncertsalen_Abning_5_SteveCowley_Presentation.pdf)\n653 [https://www.cshub.com/attacks/news/incident-of-the-week-phishing-scam-at-pa-bank-exposes-50k-accounts,](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/news/incident-of-the-week-phishing-scam-at-pa-bank-exposes-50k-accounts)\naccessed November 2018.\n654 [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/phishing-scam-dbs-posb-customers-fake-sms-police-](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/phishing-scam-dbs-posb-customers-fake-sms-police-10957456)\n[10957456, accessed November 2018.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/phishing-scam-dbs-posb-customers-fake-sms-police-10957456)\n655 [https://irgc.epfl.ch/risk-governance/page-139716-en-html/, accessed November 2018.](https://irgc.epfl.ch/risk-governance/page-139716-en-html/)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nconcerns towards the achievement of this goal[656]. Moreover, because cybersecurity is considered to be a\nutility, governments need to guarantee its continuous availability for all citizens. To this extent, CTI\ncapability constitutes a common good that will need to be delivered to all interested parties, at least at a\nbaseline level. Last but not least, differences in legal frameworks are a burden in collecting cyberthreat\n**intelligence. In some countries, assessing the weaknesses of publicly available services is considered to be**\na criminal act. In order to facilitate the collection and maintenance of CTI, it will be necessary to remove\nsuch regulatory barriers.\n\nWhile building CTI capabilities is a mainstream activity worldwide, European bodies/organisations and\n**member States are still at a low level of CTI maturity. This fact is manifested by weak or missing**\nreferences to CTI within policy documents and by the limited level of investments in relevant\ninfrastructures and services. With most CTI sources being developed outside Europe (e.g. US), European\norganisations are significantly dependent on capabilities maintained mainly outside the continent. This is\na threat to its sovereignty and its ability of self-determination with regard to the assessment of the\ncyberthreat landscape and the establishment of appropriate protection measures. And although some\napproaches to European CTI capabilities do exist[16,657,658,659,660], Europe lacks an overall strategy for the\ndevelopment of such capabilities and the enhancement of relevant skills. The establishment and further\ndevelopment of such capabilities is therefore seen as a high priority topic at the European level. Europe\nneeds independent CTI capabilities based on self-collected data from the EU space. Moreover, response\nto CTI events has shown that there is a high demand for bonding activities among European and\n**international CTI providers; and the exchange of information/experience on CTI good practices is very**\nhigh in the wish list of various types of organisations.\n\nAttacks to the supply chain have dominated the headlines for some time in 2018[573]. Supply chain attacks\nare happening in the transition phases of the development of complex systems and are targeting the\nweakest link in the chain. Though not new, these attacks have attracted the interest of cybersecurity\nexperts due to their detection difficulty and efficiency[661]. The mounting pressure to have shorter time-tomarket, to meet the demand and be cost effective, may lead to compromises during the initial stage of\nproduct research and development. But production phases are also at stake, especially due to\nglobalisation of industrial production to geographic areas that are outside the political and diplomatic\ninfluence of western high developed industrial nations. The uncertainty about the successful\nimplementation of cybersecurity and quality standards will persist, especially due to the emergence of IoT\nthat connects cyber and physical spaces. The threat landscape emerging from supply chain attacks is a\n**major cybersecurity concern, especially for low-cost devices.**\n\nJust as other cybersecurity disciplines, CTI has not yet been properly “synchronised” to other important\n**management cycles in organisations, such risk management, corporate governance and data protection.**\nAlthough asynchronous cycles are the root of problems in the communication of surfaced risks, it is also\n\n656 [https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/breakthrough-in-paris-as-51-states-agree-to-regulate-cyber-warfare-](https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/breakthrough-in-paris-as-51-states-agree-to-regulate-cyber-warfare-1.791103)\n[1.791103, accessed November 2018.](https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/breakthrough-in-paris-as-51-states-agree-to-regulate-cyber-warfare-1.791103)\n657 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/cti-eu-event/cti-eu-event-presentations/cert-eu-presentation/, accessed](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/cti-eu-event/cti-eu-event-presentations/cert-eu-presentation/)\nNovember 2018.\n658 [https://www.deutsche-systemhaus.eu/umbrella/?lang=en, accessed November 2018.](https://www.deutsche-systemhaus.eu/umbrella/?lang=en)\n[659https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/joint_communication_increasing_resilience_and_bolstering_capabilities_](https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/joint_communication_increasing_resilience_and_bolstering_capabilities_to_address_hybrid_threats.pdf)\n[to_address_hybrid_threats.pdf, accessed November 2018.](https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/joint_communication_increasing_resilience_and_bolstering_capabilities_to_address_hybrid_threats.pdf)\n660 [https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/, accessed November 2018.](https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/)\n661 [https://www.axios.com/homeland-security-supply-chain-task-force-6cf608ff-e180-4cfb-a308-c0fa35e73ead.html,](https://www.axios.com/homeland-security-supply-chain-task-force-6cf608ff-e180-4cfb-a308-c0fa35e73ead.html)\naccessed November 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\nnatural in all technology driven activities: often, technological projects develop own lives within\norganisations and may easily evade the attention of decision makers[662]. This shortcoming has been\nrecognised among CTI experts. The mobilization of multidisciplinary stakeholders seems to be the right\nway for its resolution. Yet, a discussion forum where these stakeholders can voice their concerns needs to\nbe created. Again, this is an opportunity for Europe to create such a forum and deliver a competitive\nadvantage for the European internal market.\n\nCyberthreat intelligence has evolved in the last 7-8 years from the need to follow up on a rapidly changing\ncyberthreat landscape. This rapid development was purely technology driven and narrowly scoped. Its\n**relevance highly matured traditional intelligence has been recently recognized. The advantages that can**\nbe materialised when coupling traditional intelligence and cyberthreat intelligence have not yet been\nimplemented. Individual events in the reporting period[549] have demonstrated the increases in efficiency\nwhen combining these two disciplines. Though the deployment of cyberdefence practices may facilitate\nmutual fertilization between these two disciplines, public and private organisation will need to benefit\nfrom these synergies too. This is yet another opportunity for Europe - but also for international players -to\nimplement a synergy that will boost cybersecurity to new quality and maturity level.\n\n###### Conclusions and recommendations for this year’s ETL report.\n\nIn this section, the conclusions of this year’s ETL are being presented. They are divided into three\ncategories, namely policy, business and research/education. This differentiation is indicative for the type\nof actors that would need to take up actions to cope with the points made below. Though there is a large\nvariety of organisations matching each of these categories, they are not further specified in this report.\nThis would go beyond the scope/purpose of this document. We believe, however, that it is quite\nstraightforward for interested readers to understand what type of organisation would be relevant for the\npoints made in each category, especially when national, sectorial and educational peculiarities are being\ntaken into account. This year’s conclusion are not overlap-free to the ones of previous years. However,\nnew developments have helped us to make them more specific/targeted.\n\n###### Policy conclusions\n\n  - Governments, EU Member States and EU Institutions need to facilitate training of CTI staff. Moreover,\ndue to the increased market needs for this skill and the competitive packages offered by industry,\nadministrations will need to develop employment conditions that can attract talents and lead to staff\nretention.\n\n  - EU and EU Member States will need to invest in CTI capability building by means of skills development\nand infrastructure (technical, human). Such activity will contribute towards the necessary\nimprovement of European CTI capabilities and will increase independence. This will enhance the level\nof CTI knowledge quality and turn it to a more effective resource towards successfully managing\ncritical events within Europe, especially the ones targeting critical infrastructures.\n\n  - The quality of CTI knowledge heavily depends on the ingested information. Several barriers do exist in\nEurope and worldwide that hinder access to such information: the existence of diversified regulatory\nspaces, the unavailability of reliable incident information and deficiencies in information sharing. A\nPolicy should enable better ingestion of information to produce CTI by removing legal and regulatory\nbarriers.\n\n662 [http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/apple-und-der-boersensturz-weg-von-hardware-hin-zu-software-a-](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/apple-und-der-boersensturz-weg-von-hardware-hin-zu-software-a-1239605.html)\n[1239605.html, accessed November 2018.](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/apple-und-der-boersensturz-weg-von-hardware-hin-zu-software-a-1239605.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- To a certain extent, CTI is considered a public good. Administrations will need to subsidize the\ncreation of CTI knowledge centres and support the development of good practices and tools for\nvarious types of organisations. This will be a direct contribution to enhance the protection of critical\nassets.\n\n- Currently, many players join cyber-activities in the cyberspace. Administrations will need to take\nproactive measures to avoid distortions that may be caused by overlapping activities and\nresponsibilities[663]. Such actions should contribute towards CTI information sharing and avoidance of\nduplication of work among states.\n\n- Administrations will need to make efforts to close the gap between end-users and high-end CTI\noperators. This will require the availability of CTI knowledge and services in a form that is digestible by\nnon-expert users.\n\n- High-level horizon scanning activities that are based on emerging cybersecurity challenges and\nemerging threats need to be introduced and taken into account when policy decisions are being\nmade. Such activities should be based on scenario development and may provide valuable insights for\nimpact assessments made in the framework of regulatory activities.\n\n###### Business conclusions\n\n- Businesses will need to develop viable CTI services to cover a wide range of enterprises that possess\nlow to no CTI skills. Such services may be oriented towards various maturity levels and provide\nseamless automation for the protection of assets based on CTI information.\n\n- Businesses will need to define processes for CTI knowledge management. Such processes need to be\nin sync with other cybersecurity processes and in particular with risk management. They aim at\nenhancing the agility of processes is to follow the agility of CTI knowledge management.\n\n- Businesses need to respond to the trend of cyber-attack automation. The developed solution should\nconsist of tools that automate the adaptation of controls based on CTI-feeds. Such solutions will be\ntailored to the needs of enterprises with low security budgets.\n\n- Businesses should estimate the risks emerging from potential cyber-attacks to their customer base by\nextrapolating their impact. By taking into account potential losses that can be experienced by users,\nthey will reduce attack surfaces and help end-users protecting their assets. Such an approach will\nenhance user trust and remove barriers to technology deployment. This is particularly important in\nareas such as IoT, eHealth and mobile computing.\n\n- Businesses should be aware of supply chain threats. Such threats are prevalent in complex product\ndevelopment processes involving multiple providers. While the development of qualitative criteria for\nthe various development phases may help, it is important to assess the end-to-end characteristics of\nused components. Light certification processes of the components used may be a further option for\nthe reduction of exposure to such threats.\n\n###### Technical, Research, Educational conclusions\n\n- Developing threat assessments on a sectorial basis will be necessary. Such assessments will be\noriented towards specific technology areas and will help users of these sectors managing threats on\nthose environments.\n\n663 [http://www.egmontinstitute.be/cyber-diplomacy-making-international-society-digital-age/, accessed November](http://www.egmontinstitute.be/cyber-diplomacy-making-international-society-digital-age/)\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019\n\n- Cyber-crime evolves towards professionalization in various verticals. Moreover, cyber-criminals\ncombine their skills to increase automation and efficiency of attack vectors. Defenders will need to\nbetter understand these developments and provide new methods for detection. Novel disruption\nmethods need to be developed. Such methods will need to take into account defences for all phases\nin the kill-chain, as opposed to current practices that are triggered mostly after exploitation has been\ndetected.\n\n- There is a pressing need for common vocabulary in the area of CTI. Currently available threat\ntaxonomies[664] and common frameworks[91], however, they are often side-products of threat\nassessment projects and are not systematically maintained/updated and/or consolidated.\n\n- Efficiency of cyber-attacks depends on the existence of vulnerabilities in targeted systems.\nVulnerability management practices need to be part of defence strategies. This is manifested through\na large number of vulnerabilities in end-user systems and services and the long time-windows for\npatching known vulnerabilities. The cyber-security community will need to develop better means for\nthe detection and removal of vulnerabilities by also covering geographical viewpoints (e.g. the\nEuropean space).\n\n- There are many improvements necessary at the ingestion level of CTI knowledge. Better sharing\nschemes and better analysis of known incidents are major avenues to achieve this goal. It is necessary\nto combine incident reporting and CTI processing. This will enhance the quality and accuracy of CTI.\n\n- CTI needs to be combined with related disciplines to enlarge scope and include additional sources. In\n2018, the combination of CTI and traditional intelligence has shown a great potential towards threat\nmitigation. Yet, mutual fertilisation from the combination of these two areas is at an initial\ndevelopment stage. The development of methods combining these areas needs to be enforced.\n\n664 [https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threatintelligence/evaluation-comprehensive-taxonomies-](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threatintelligence/evaluation-comprehensive-taxonomies-information-technology-threats-38360)\n[information-technology-threats-38360, accessed November 2018.](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threatintelligence/evaluation-comprehensive-taxonomies-information-technology-threats-38360)\n\n\n-----\n\nPO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece\nTel: +30 28 14 40 9710\ninfo@enisa.europa.eu\nwww enisa europa eu\n\n\n### ENISA\n###### European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE) Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece\n\n### Athens Office\n###### 1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece\n\nPO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece ISBN: 978-92-9204-250-9\nTel: +30 28 14 40 9710 ISSN: 2363-3050\n\nDOI: 10.2824/967192\n\ninfo@enisa.europa.eu\n\n\n-----",
