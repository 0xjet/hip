Foreign entities are launching\ncyber strikes to disrupt elections and sow discord. Unfortunately, the internet has become an\navenue for some governments to steal and leak information, spread disinformation, and\nprobe and potentially attempt to tamper with voting systems. We saw this during the United\nStates general election in 2016, last May during the French presidential election, and now in\na broadening way as Americans are preparing for the November midterm elections.\n\nBroadening cyberthreats to both U.S. political parties make clear that the tech sector will\nneed to do more to help protect the democratic process. Last week, Microsoft’s Digital\nCrimes Unit (DCU) successfully executed a court order to disrupt and transfer control of six\ninternet domains created by a group widely associated with the Russian government and\n[known as Strontium, or alternatively Fancy Bear or APT28. We have now used this approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear)\n12 times in two years to shut down 84 fake websites associated with this group. Attackers\nwant their attacks to look as realistic as possible and they therefore create websites and\nURLs that look like sites their targeted victims would expect to receive email from or visit.\nThe sites involved in last week’s order fit this description.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe re concerned that these and other attempts pose security threats to a broadening array\nof groups connected with both American political parties in the run-up to the 2018 elections.\nThat’s why today we are expanding Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program with a new\ninitiative called Microsoft AccountGuard. This initiative will provide state-of-the-art\ncybersecurity protection at no extra cost to all candidates and campaign offices at the\nfederal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations we now\nbelieve are under attack. The technology is free of charge to candidates, campaigns and\nrelated political institutions using Office 365.\n\nAs a special master appointed by a federal judge concluded in the recent court order\nobtained by DCU, there is “good cause” to believe that Strontium is “likely to continue” its\nconduct. In the face of this continuing activity, we must work on the assumption that these\nattacks will broaden further. An effective response will require even more work to bring\npeople and expertise together from across governments, political parties, campaigns and the\ntech sector.\n\n**An expansion of political targets**\n\nLast week’s order transferred control of the six internet domains listed below from Strontium\nto Microsoft, preventing Strontium from using them and enabling us to more closely look for\nevidence of what Strontium intended to do with the domains. These six domains are listed\nhere:\n\nImportantly, these domains show a broadening of entities targeted by Strontium’s activities.\nOne appears to mimic the domain of the International Republican Institute, which promotes\n[democratic principles and is led by a notable board of directors, including six Republican](http://www.iri.org/who-we-are/board-of-directors)\nsenators and a leading senatorial candidate. Another is similar to the domain used by the\n[Hudson Institute, which hosts prominent discussions on topics including cybersecurity,](https://www.hudson.org/research/14452-dni-coats-remarks-at-hudson-event-widely-covered-by-major-news-outlets)\namong other important activities. Other domains appear to reference the U.S. Senate but are\nnot specific to particular offices. To be clear, we currently have no evidence these domains\nwere used in any successful attacks before the DCU transferred control of them, nor do we\nhave evidence to indicate the identity of the ultimate targets of any planned attack involving\nthese domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft has notified both nonprofit organizations. Both have responded quickly, and\nMicrosoft will continue to work closely with them and other targeted organizations on\ncountering cybersecurity threats to their systems. We’ve also been monitoring and\naddressing domain activity with Senate IT staff the past several months, following prior\nattacks we detected on the staffs of two current senators.\n\nDespite last week’s steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and\nother sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks\nacross the political spectrum in the United States. Taken together, this pattern mirrors the\ntype of activity we saw prior to the 2016 election in the United States and the 2017 election in\nFrance.\n\n**Our new Microsoft AccountGuard initiative**\n\nAccountGuard will provide three services that will cover both organizational and personal\nemail accounts:\n\n1. Threat notification across accounts. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center will\n\nenable Microsoft to detect and provide notification of attacks in a unified way across\nboth organizational and personal email systems. For political campaigns and other\neligible organizations, when an attack is identified, this will provide a more\ncomprehensive view of attacks against campaign staff. When verifiable threats are\ndetected, Microsoft will provide personal and expedited recommendations to\ncampaigns and campaign staff to secure their systems.\n2. Security guidance and ongoing education. Officials, campaigns and related political\n\norganizations will receive guidance to help make their networks and email systems\nmore secure. This can include applying multi-factor authentication, installing the latest\nsecurity updates and guidance for setting up systems that ensure only those people\nwho need data and documents can access them. AccountGuard will provide updated\nbriefings and training to address evolving cyberattack trends.\n3. Early adopter opportunities. Microsoft will provide preview releases of new security\n\nfeatures on a par with the services offered to our large corporate and government\naccount customers.\n\nYou can read a more complete description of Microsoft AccountGuard in today’s blog by Tom\nBurt, the corporate vice president who heads Microsoft’s Customer Security and Trust group.\n\n**Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program**\n\n[Since we launched Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program in April, we have focused on](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/04/13/announcing-the-defending-democracy-program/)\nfour priorities: protecting campaigns from hacking, protecting voting and the electoral\nprocess, increasing political advertising transparency, and defending against disinformation\ncampaigns. In the coming months, we will offer AccountGuard in additional countries, as we\ncontinue to invest in and evolve other aspects of the Defending Democracy Program.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur Defending Democracy Program is an important piece of our work to protect customers\nand promote cyberdiplomacy around the world. While cybersecurity starts with Microsoft and\nother companies in the tech sector, it’s ultimately a shared responsibility with customers and\ngovernments around the world. Together with our industry partners, we’ve launched the\n[Cybersecurity Tech Accord, now endorsed by 44 leading tech companies to protect and](https://cybertechaccord.org/)\nempower civilians online and to improve the security, stability and resilience of cyberspace.\nAnd we will continue to call for stronger adherence to existing international norms and the\n[creation of new international laws – like a Digital Geneva Convention.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/11/10/need-modernize-international-agreements-create-safer-digital-world/)\n\nAs last week’s court order and today’s AccountGuard initiative reflect, we are committed not\nonly to stronger principles and laws but stronger action as well.\n\n**A democracy requires vigilance**\n\nIn 1787, as the American constitutional convention reached its conclusion in Philadelphia,\nBenjamin Franklin was asked as he departed Independence Hall what type of government\nthe delegates had created. He famously replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.”\n\nWe can only keep our democratic societies secure if candidates can run campaigns and\nvoters can go to the polls untainted by foreign cyberattacks.\n\nDemocracy requires vigilance and at times action by citizens to protect and maintain it. No\nindividual or company can hope to meet this imperative by itself. We all need to do our part.\nWe’re committed to doing our part by helping to protect candidates and campaigns in\npreserving their voices and votes no matter what party they support.\n\nTags: [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Digital Crimes Unit,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/digital-crimes-unit/) [elections,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/elections/) [Microsoft AccountGuard](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-accountguard/)\n\n\n-----",
