For example, the attackers used no zeroday exploits, only exploits that are widely available on the Internet. But that didn’t prevent the\ncampaign from staying under the radar for several years.\n\nThe total number of known victims is over 2800 worldwide, out of which Kaspersky Lab\nresearchers were able to identify 101 organizations. This list of victims seems to indicate\nCrouching Yeti’s interest in strategic targets, but it also shows an interest of the group in\nmany other not-so-obvious institutions.\n\nKaspersky Lab’s experts believe they might be collateral victims, but it might also be\nreasonable to redefine Crouching Yeti not only as a highly targeted campaign in a very\nspecific area of interest, but also as a broad surveillance campaign with interests in different\nsectors.\n\n## How do I know if I’m infected by Crouching Yeti\n\nThe best way to determine if you’ve been a victim of Crouching Yeti if to identify if there has\nbeen an intrusion. Threat identification can be done with a strong antivirus product such as\n[Kaspersky Anti-Virus.](https://www.kaspersky.com/antivirus)\n\nKaspersky Lab products will detect the malware involved in the Crouching Yeti campaign\nwith the following threat definitions:\n\nTrojan.Win32.Sysmain.xxx\nTrojan.Win32.Havex.xxx\nTrojan.Win32.ddex.xxx\nBackdoor.MSIL.ClientX.xxx\nTrojan.Win32.Karagany.xxx\nTrojan-Spy.Win32.HavexOPC.xxx\nTrojan-Spy.Win32.HavexNk2.xxx\nTrojan-Dropper.Win32.HavexDrop.xxx\nTrojan-Spy.Win32.HavexNetscan.xxx\nTrojan-Spy.Win32.HavexSysinfo.xxx\n\n## How can I protect myself against Crouching Yeti\n\n\n-----\n\nKeep all your software up to date. None of the exploits used by Crouching Yeti threats\nwere zero day exploit attacks, the majority of the infections could have been prevented\nby using up-to-date third party software.\nInstall and keep your security solution updated to prevent virus infections.\nEducation is an important part of security, especially regarding the spear phishing\nemails.\n\nKaspersky\nCrouching Yeti is a threat involved in several advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns\nthat have been active going back to at least the end of 2010.\n\n\n-----",
