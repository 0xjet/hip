To put that number in context, you’d\n[need to cut down more than 1.5 million trees to make enough paper to print out all of the](http://simplyted.blogspot.co.uk/2005/12/how-to-visualize-data.html)\nstolen data.\n\nThe group, which we have called “Silent Librarian,” has targeted universities and other\norganizations with strong research departments, particularly those focused on medicine and\ntechnology.\n\nBut the scale of the attacks, while alarming, isn’t the most concerning thing right now. Here’s\nthe real headline:\n\n**_Silent Librarian phishing attacks have continued unabated in the days since the_**\n**_indictment._**\n\nSince the indictment less than 14 days ago, PhishLabs analysts have observed 18 new\nphishing attacks targeting 14 different universities from five countries: United States, United\nKingdom, Canada, Australia, and France.\n\n### What Does This Mean for Potential Targets?\n\n\n-----\n\nOver the past two weeks, the indicted Iranian threat actors have continued their attacks\ndespite being formally charged. Including the most recent attacks, PhishLabs has attributed\nmore than 780 phishing attacks to Silent Librarian, which includes attacks against more than\n300 universities in 22 countries.\n\nWhile extradition or real sanctions were likely never in the cards, it was probably hoped that\npublicly “naming and shaming” the actors would at least put the attacks on hold. Since that\nhasn’t happened, it’s doubly important that potential targets do everything they can to protect\nthemselves from further attacks.\n\nTo reiterate, the attackers have explicitly gone after universities and other organizations with\nstrong research departments, particularly in the fields of technology and medicine.\n\nBelow is a list of high-level indicators of compromise (IOCs) that we have previously\nassociated with Silent Librarian phishing attacks, which includes domains hosting university\nphishing sites and IP addresses linked to those domains. It should be noted that all of the\ndomains used by Silent Librarian are maliciously registered and no legitimate content has\nbeen observed on any of the domains. For IP addresses referenced below, other non-Silent\nLibrarian domains have historically resolved to many of them and the maliciousness of those\ndomains has not been determined.\n\nWhile stringent anti-phishing measures should be taken to minimize the threat posed by\nSilent Librarian (or any threat, for that matter), the first order of business for any potential\ntarget organization should be to blacklist the domains and monitor and/or set flags for\noutbound traffic for the IP addresses listed below. It should also be noted that because this\ngroup is still deploying new attacks, new domains are being actively created, so this should\nbe viewed as a historical list, not a real-time list.\n\n**DOMAINS:**\n1edu.in\nacll.cf\naill.cf\natna.cf\natti.cf\nauthn.in\nauthn.website\naztt.tk\ncavc.tk\ncave.gq\nccli.cf\ncill.cf\ncitt.cf\ncntt.cf\ncrll.tk\n\n\n-----\n\ncsll.cf\ncsna.cf\nctll.tk\ncvnc.ga\ncvre.tk\nczll.tk\ncztt.tk\nditt.cf\nedlu.info\nedu-lib.cf\nedu-lib.ml\nedue.in\nedun.cf\neill.cf\neslog.in\neuca.cf\neuce.in\nezauth.xyz\nezll.tk\nezplog.in\nezproxy.in\nezproxy.tk\nezproxy.top\nezprx.xyz\neztt.tk\nflll.cf\niell.tk\niull.tk\nizll.tk\nlett.cf\nlib1.bid\nlib1.ga\nlib1.ml\nlib2.xyz\nlibb.ga\nlibc.cf\nlibe.ml\nlibg.cf\nlibg.ga\nlibg.gq\nlibk.gq\nlibk.ml\n\n\n-----\n\nlibloan.xyz\nlibn.gq\nlibnicinfo.xyz\nlibr.gq\nlibrary1.online\nlibrarylog.in\nlibraryme.ir\nlibt.cf\nlibt.ml\nlibu.gq\nlibv.ga\nlibv.gq\nlibw.cf\nlibw.ml\nlill.gq\nllbt.tk\nllib.cf\nllib.ga\nllic.cf\nllic.tk\nllil.cf\nllit.cf\nlliv.tk\nllse.cf\nmedpoint.ir\nmncr.tk\nncll.tk\nncnc.cf\nnctt.tk\nnecr.ga\nnelib.top\nnika.ga\nnikc.cf\nnsae.ml\nnuec.ml\nnuvo.cf\nnvre.tk\nreactivation.in\nrill.cf\nrtll.cf\nrtll.tk\nsaea.ga\n\n\n-----\n\nsctt.cf\nseae.tk\nshibboleth.link\nsitl.tk\nslli.cf\ntilc.tk\ntill.cf\ntitt.cf\nuill.cf\nuitt.tk\nulibe.ml\nulibi.ml\nulibl.ga\nulibr.cf\nulibr.ga\nulibt.ml\numlib.ml\numll.tk\nuni-lb.com\nuniv-database.cf\nuniv-library.ga\nunll.tk\nunsw.ga\nutll.tk\nvsre.cf\nweb2lib.info\nwebauth.in\nwebauth.xyz\nweblogin.site\nweblogon.xyz\nxill.tk\nzedviros.ir\nzill.cf\n\n**IP ADDRESSES:**\n103.241.3.91\n104.152.168.23\n107.180.57.7\n107.180.58.47\n136.243.145.233\n136.243.198.45\n138.201.17.56\n141.8.224.221\n\n\n-----\n\n144.217.120.73\n144.76.189.80\n148.251.116.93\n148.251.12.172\n162.218.237.3\n167.114.103.215\n167.114.13.164\n172.246.144.34\n173.254.239.2\n176.31.33.115\n176.31.33.116\n176.9.188.235\n178.33.115.10\n184.95.37.90\n185.105.185.22\n185.28.21.83\n185.28.21.95\n185.55.227.104\n185.86.180.250\n188.40.34.186\n192.169.82.134\n193.70.117.250\n195.154.102.75\n198.252.106.149\n198.27.68.142\n198.91.81.5\n199.204.187.164\n31.220.20.111\n45.35.33.126\n46.4.91.26\n5.135.123.163\n5.196.194.234\n51.254.198.131\n51.254.21.142\n66.70.197.208\n78.46.77.105\n79.175.181.11\n82.102.15.215\n87.98.249.207\n88.99.128.229\n88.99.139.8\n88.99.160.209\n\n\n-----\n\n88.99.40.240\n88.99.69.4\n93.174.95.64\n94.76.204.201\n\n## Why BitB Attacks are Concerning\n\nPhishLabs has identified a Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) campaign targeting financial\ninstitutions with a fake Office 365 (O365) authorization protocol.\n\n\n-----\n\n## What is the HelpSystems Value Proposition for Cybersecurity?\n\nIn this guest blog, Dr Ed Amoroso, CEO, Tag Cyber, provides a high-level overview of the\nHelpSystems cybersecurity portfolio value proposition based on a mapping of its component\nsolution offerings to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) phases.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cybercrime Cost U.S. $6.9 Billion in 2021\n\nThe FBI's annual look at phishing, scam, and personal data breach statistics is out.\n\n\n-----",
