Ironically the decoy document is a deceptive flyer\nrelating to the [Cyber Conflict U.S. conference. CyCon US is a collaborative effort between](http://aci.cvent.com/events/2017-international-conference-on-cyber-conflict-cycon-u-s-/event-summary-004d598d31684f21ac82050a9000369f.aspx)\nthe Army Cyber Institute at the United States Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative\nCyber Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.\nDue to the nature of this document, we assume that this campaign targets people with an\ninterest in cyber security. Unlike previous campaigns from this actor, the flyer does not\ncontain an Office exploit or a 0-day, it simply contains a malicious Visual Basic for\nApplications (VBA) macro.\n\nThe VBA drops and executes a new variant of Seduploader. This reconnaissance malware\nhas been used by Group 74 for years and it is composed of 2 files: a dropper and a payload.\nThe dropper and the payload are quite similar to the previous versions but the author\n\n\n-----\n\nmodified some public information such as MUTEX name, obfuscation keys... We assume\nthat these modifications were performed to avoid detection based on public IOCs.\n\nThe article describes the malicious document and the Seduploader reconnaissance\nmalware, especially the difference with the previous versions.\n\n## Malicious Office Document\n\n### Decoy Document\n\n[The decoy document is a flyer concerning the Cyber Conflict U.S. conference with the](http://aci.cvent.com/events/2017-international-conference-on-cyber-conflict-cycon-u-s-/event-summary-004d598d31684f21ac82050a9000369f.aspx)\nfollowing filename Conference_on_Cyber_Conflict.doc. It contains 2 pages with the logo of\nthe organizer and the sponsors:\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the nature of the document, we assume that the targeted people are linked or\ninterested by the cybersecurity landscape. The exact content of the document can be found\n[online on the conference website. The attackers probably copy/pasted it into Word to create](http://aci.cvent.com/events/2017-international-conference-on-cyber-conflict-cycon-u-s-/event-summary-004d598d31684f21ac82050a9000369f.aspx)\nthe malicious document.\n\n### VBA\n\nThe Office document contains a VBA script. Here is the code:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe goal of this code is to get information from the properties of the document (\"Subject\",\n\"Company\", \"Category\", \"Hyperlink base\" and finally \"Comments\"). Some of this information\ncan be directly extracted from the Windows explorer by looking at the properties of the file.\nThe \"Hyperlink Base\" must be extracted using another tool, strings is capable of obtaining\nthis by looking for long strings. Pay close attention to the contents of these fields as they\nappear base64 encoded.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis extracted information is concatenated together to make a single variable. This variable\nis decoded with the base64 algorithm in order to get a Windows library (PE file) which is\nwritten to disk. The file is named netwf.dat. On the next step this file is executed by\nrundll32.exe via the KlpSvc export. We see that this file drops 2 additional files: netwf.bat\nand netwf.dll. The final part of the VBA script changes the properties of these two files,\nsetting their attributes to Hidden. We can also see 2 VBA variable names: PathPld, probably\nfor Path Payload, and PathPldBt, for Path Payload Batch.\n\n## Seduploader Variant\n\n### Dropper Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nAs opposed to previous campaigns performed by this actor, this latest version does not\ncontain privilege escalation and it simply executes the payload and configures persistence\nmechanisms. The dropper installs 2 files:\n\nnetwf.bat : executes netwf.dll\nnetwf.dll : the payload\n\nThe dropper implements 2 persistence mechanisms:\n\nHKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript to execute the netwf.bat file\nCOM Object hijack of the following CLSID: {BCDE0395-E52F-467C-8E3D[C4579291692E}, the CLSID of the class MMDeviceEnumerator.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371399(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nThese 2 techniques have also been previously used by this actor.\n\nFinally the payload is executed by rundll32.exe (and the ordinal #1 in argument) or by\nexplorer.exe if the COM Object hijack is performed. In this case, explorer.exe will instance\nthe MMDeviceEnumerator class and will execute the payload.\n\n### Payload Analysis\n\nThe payload features are similar to the previous versions of Seduploader. We can compare it\nto the sample e338d49c270baf64363879e5eecb8fa6bdde8ad9 used in May 2017 by Group\n74. Of the 195 functions of the new sample, 149 are strictly identical, 16 match at 90% and 2\nmatch at 80%:\n\nIn the previous campaign where adversaries used Office document exploits as an infection\nvector, the payload was executed in the Office word process. In this campaign, adversaries\ndid not use any exploit. Instead,the payload is executed in standalone mode by rundll32.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdversaries also changed some constants, such as the XOR key used in the previous\nversion. The key in our version is:\n```\nkey=b\"\\x08\\x7A\\x05\\x04\\x60\\x7c\\x3e\\x3c\\x5d\\x0b\\x18\\x3c\\x55\\x64\"\n\n```\nThe MUTEX name is different too: FG00nxojVs4gLBnwKc7HhmdK0h\n\nHere are some of the Seduploader features:\n\nScreenshot capture (with the GDI API);\ndata/configuration exfiltration;\nExecution of code;\nFile downloading;\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Command & Control (CC) of the analysed sample is myinvestgroup[.]com. During the\ninvestigation, the server did not provide any configuration to the infected machines. Based\non the metadata of the Office documents and the PE files, the attackers had created the file\non Wednesday, the 4th of October. We can see, in Cisco Umbrella, a peak in activities 3\ndays later, Saturday the 7th of October:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnalysis of this campaign shows us once more that attackers are creative and use the news\nto compromise the targets. This campaign has most likely been created to allow the targeting\nof people linked to or interested by cybersecurity, so probably the people who are more\nsensitive to cybersecurity threats. In this case, Group 74 did not use an exploit or any 0-day\nbut simply used scripting language embedded within the Microsoft Office document. Due to\nthis change, the fundamental compromise mechanism is different as the payload is executed\nin a standalone mode. The reasons for this are unknown, but, we could suggest that they did\nnot want to utilize any exploits to ensure they remained viable for any other operations.\nActors will often not use exploits due to the fact that researchers can find and eventually\npatch these which renders the actors weaponized platforms defunct. Additionally the author\ndid some small updates after publications from the security community, again this is common\nfor actors of this sophisticated nature, once their campaigns have been exposed they will\noften try to change tooling to ensure better avoidance. For example the actor changed the\nXOR key and the MUTEX name. We assume that these modifications were performed in\norder to avoid detection based on public IOCs.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n[Network Security appliances such asNGFW,NGIPS, andMeraki MX can detect malicious](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html)\nactivity associated with this threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\nOpen Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the\n[latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.](https://www.snort.org/products)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Files\n\nOffice Documents:\n\nc4be15f9ccfecf7a463f3b1d4a17e7b4f95de939e057662c3f97b52f7fa3c52f\ne5511b22245e26a003923ba476d7c36029939b2d1936e17a9b35b396467179ae\nefb235776851502672dba5ef45d96cc65cb9ebba1b49949393a6a85b9c822f52\n\nSeduploader Dropper:\n\n\n-----\n\n522fd9b35323af55113455d823571f71332e53dde988c2eb41395cf6b0c15805\n\nSedupload Payload:\n\nef027405492bc0719437eb58c3d2774cc87845f30c40040bbebbcc09a4e3dd18\n\n### Networks\n\nCC:\n\nmyinvestgroup[.]com\n\n\n-----",
