Often\nanalyses are enough to temporary block cyber-criminals by sharing to everybody IOC\nallowing National and International players (ISP, AV vendors, CERTs and so on) to block\nconnections or to trash files. But sometimes when a ransomware hits a victim, the ultimate\ndesire is to be able to decrypt those files and to restore the last consistent data set. Today\nwe realized this ultimate scope and we want to release it public, to everybody needs a\ndecryptor for [LooCipher.](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/loocipher-the-new-infernal-ransomware/)\n\nAt the beginning of July Yoroi Z-Lab Team publicly released a quite exhaustive report about\n[LooCipher (available here). The initial vector (through Microsoft Office Macro) was](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/loocipher-the-new-infernal-ransomware/)\n[foreshadowing an important spread over the next few days. Indeed few days later Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/loocipher-can-encrypted-files-be-recovered.html)\n[researchers released a nice report on LooCipher (available here) mostly focused on the](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/loocipher-can-encrypted-files-be-recovered.html)\nencryption algorithm, where they discussed it through a python POC.\n\n“LooCipher starts its encryption routine by generating a 16-byte data block with random\ncharacters chosen from the following predefined characters, using the current system\ntime as seed. ”\n\n_From Fortinet report_\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the LooCipher technical features are described as follows:\n\nThe ransomware spreads using weaponized Word document.\nThe Command and Control is hosted on the TOR Network, at the following onion\naddress “hxxp://hcwyo5rfapkytajg[.]onion” .\nThe attackers leverage several Tor2Web proxy services to easily allow the access to\nthe Tor C2.\nThe binary can work both as cryptor and decryptor.\nThe C2 dynamically generates a different Bitcoin address for each infection.\n\nThe Fortinet researches spent time in describing the used algorithm (AES-256-ECB) and\nportrayed a decryption code as showed in the following image. By focusing on how to\nrecover the obfuscated key – which was retrievable either via network or via memory\ndumping Fortinet researchers gave us the right reading key to be able to write our own\ndecryptor code.\n\nFrom Fortinet Report\nThe turning point was on the way the key was encoded. The obfuscation method was quite\ntrivial. It consists in a simple find-and-replace of each key characters with a pre-defined\ndouble-digit number, belonging to the following set:\n\nDecoding Matrix\nSo once retrieved the obfuscated key it was possible to reconstruct the original key to\ndecrypt all involved files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe master key is available directly in memory into LooCipher segments. So please\nremember to not kill the process even if you have been infected or to not reboot your\nwindows box. If you kill the process or reboot your system, ZLab Team decrypter is not going\n[to work there. You can download it HERE and use it for free.](https://github.com/ZLab-Cybaze-Yoroi/LooCipher_Decryption_Tool)\n\n1. Find the Process ID of the LooCipher ransomware\n2. Open cmd with the Administrator privileges in the path where is downloaded the tool\n3. In cmd prompt: ZLAB_LOOCIPHER_DECRYPTION_TOOL.exe <PID>\n\nHappy recovery !\n\n\n-----",
