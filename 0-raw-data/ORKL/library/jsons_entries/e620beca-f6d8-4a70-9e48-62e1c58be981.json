The investigation exposes widespread global targeting with\nPegasus spyware. The investigation also includes results from the forensic examination of a\nnumber of devices that their technical partner, Amnesty International, assessed to be\ninfected.\n\n\n-----\n\nForbidden Stories and Amnesty International requested that the Citizen Lab undertake an\nindependent peer review of a sample of their forensic evidence and their general forensic\nmethodology. We were provided with iTunes backups of several devices and a separate\nmethodology brief. No additional context or information about the devices or the investigation\nwas provided to us.\n\n[We independently validated that Amnesty International’s forensic methodology correctly](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\nidentified infections with NSO’s Pegasus spyware within four iTunes backups. We also\ndetermined that their overall methodology is sound. In addition, the Citizen Lab’s own\nresearch has independently arrived at a number of the same key findings as Amnesty\nInternational’s analysis.\n\n## Methodological Assessment: Sound\n\nThe Citizen Lab provides the following assessment of Amnesty’s methodology:\n\nAmnesty’s described methodology for identifying Pegasus Process Names (and\n**email addresses linked to the NSO Pegasus killchain) is sound. Their method is**\nbased on temporal correlation between the items’ first appearance in logs and phones’\ncommunication with known Pegasus Installation servers, or other Pegasus Process\nNames.\nAmnesty’s described methodology for identifying times during which phones were\n**compromised is sound. Their method involves observing Pegasus Process Names in**\na DataUsage.sqlite file obtained from an iTunes backup, or a netusage.sqlite file\nobtained from a full filesystem extraction, or other log files on the phone that record\nprocess names.\nAmnesty’s described methodology for linking the zero-click compromise they\n**observed on iOS 14.6 to NSO Group is sound. Their method is the same as above.**\nAmnesty’s described methodology for linking the activity they observed involving\n**Amazon CloudFront servers to the NSO Pegasus killchain is sound. Their method**\nis the same as above.\nAmnesty did in fact detect Version 4 Pegasus servers. Citizen Lab and Amnesty\nTech conducted mutual sharing of Version 4 domain names we each detected as of\nJuly 2020. At that point, it became clear to both groups that we had independently\ndeveloped substantially similar methods to detect NSO Group’s infrastructure.\n\n## Additional Independent Support for Amnesty’s Findings\n\nThe Citizen Lab’s own research has independently arrived at several of Amnesty’s key\nfindings:\n\n\n-----\n\nCitizen Lab independently employed a similar methodology to Amnesty\n**International in our analysis of potential Pegasus compromise (i.e., identifying**\nprocess names proximate to communication with Pegasus servers), and have devised\nour own list of process names. Amnesty appears to have mentioned 45 process names\nin their draft report. We computed the intersection of this list with our list, and identified\n28 process names in common. We can also confirm that we have not observed\nAmnesty’s list of 45 process names used in association with any benign or legitimate\napps.\nCitizen Lab independently documented NSO Pegasus spyware installed via\n**successful zero-day zero-click iMessage compromises of an iPhone 12 Pro Max**\n**device running iOS 14.6, as well as zero-day zero-click iMessage attacks that**\n**successfully installed Pegasus on an iPhone SE2 device running iOS version**\n**14.4, and a zero-click (non-zero-day) iMessage attack on an iPhone SE2 device**\n**running iOS 14.0.1. The mechanics of the zero-click exploit for iOS 14.x appear to be**\nsubstantially different than the KISMET exploit for iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7, suggesting\nthat it is in fact a different zero-click iMessage exploit.\nCitizen Lab independently observed NSO Group’s new design for their hidden\n**infrastructure which appears to have been launched starting on September 2, 2018,**\nabout one month after Amnesty Tech and Citizen Lab published reports on NSO Group\nin August 2018. The new design is as Amnesty Tech describes in their draft report:\n“URL Shortener Servers” are separated from “Pegasus Installation Servers,” and\n“Installation DNS Servers” are introduced.\nCitizen Lab independently conducted similar scanning for Pegasus Infection\n**Server domain names, as well as Command and Control (C&C) server domain**\nnames. Citizen Lab and Amnesty International conducted mutual sharing of these\nVersion 4 domain names we detected in July 2020.\nCitizen Lab independently observed NSO Group begin to make extensive use of\n**Amazon services including CloudFront in 2021.**\nCitizen Lab observed that NSO Group’s spyware was modified in late 2019 or early\n**2020 to (incompletely) delete information from the DataUsage.sqlite file. We have**\nnever observed this anomaly outside of Pegasus infection, and in each case where we\nhave observed this anomaly, we are able to correlate it with other indicators of Pegasus\ninfection.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAmnesty International’s core forensic methods for analyzing devices to determine that they\nhave been infected with NSO Group spyware are sound.\n\nFurther information about the Citizen Lab’s own investigations into NSO Group can be found\nhere.\n\n\n-----",
