In that time, Berserk Bear infiltrated numerous industrial and critical\ninfrastructure entities – but with no known, deliberate disruptive effect. In this sense, Berserk stands apart from other\nentities targeting critical infrastructure linked to Russian intelligence organizations, such as Sandworm, which induced\nmultiple disruptions in various entities over the same period.\n\nBerserk thus appears a curious entity: capable of leveraging various sophisticated techniques, such as vendor and supply\nchain intrusions, to breach some of the most sensitive civilian institutions in Europe and North America, while seemingly\ndoing nothing with such access. Yet for all its lack of direct impact such activity is not benign, and likely does not represent\nmere information gathering. Rather, Berserk’s actions represent long-term capability and access development designed to\nprepare for action in the most frightening of environments: outright conflict between Berserk’s sponsors or directors (likely\nRussian strategic leadership) and various Western interests.\n\nIn this paper we will explore Berserk Bear’s decade of operations, including an overview of technical capabilities and\nefforts, to understand this enigmatic threat actor. While doing so, we will uncover items previously linked to this group’s\nactivity and also disclose likely physical disruption operations caused by this group accidentally, resulting in\nsignificant damage to victim environments. As a result of this discussion, we will not only learn more about a\nparticularly interesting threat actor, we will also discover vital aspects concerning supply chain intrusions, cyber\ncontributions to preparation for kinetic warfare, and what happens when intrusions in cyber-physical environments\nproduce unintended results.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\n‘Berserk Bear’ refers to a cyber threat actor operating, in various ways, since at least 2010. Alternatively referred to as\nDragonfly, Energetic Bear, TEMP.Isotope, Crouching Yeti, ALLANITE or DYMALLOY, among other names [1, 2], the\ngroup launched a series of campaigns against various critical infrastructure entities, largely in Europe and North America,\nbut is not associated with any known deliberate destructive event [3]. For the sake of simplicity, this entity will be referred\nto as ‘Berserk Bear’ or just ‘Berserk’ for the remainder of this paper. Linked to Russian intelligence operations by several\ngovernments and commercial researchers, Berserk Bear differentiates itself from other critical infrastructure targeting\ngroups with similar affiliation, such as Sandworm [4], due to this lack of identified impacts.\n\n_Figure 1: Berserk overview._\n\nYet a closer examination of Berserk Bear’s actions taking place over a decade reveals a much more nuanced and\nconcerning picture. Although not associated with deliberate disruption, the group has targeted and successfully\npenetrated networks ranging from critical industrial environments to election-related operations. This continued\nwillingness to target and breach sensitive, critical networks places Berserk in an interesting position: not pursuing\nimmediate payoffs, but rather establishing the information collection and access development operations that could\nfacilitate future actions at a time of its sponsor’s choosing. Given this history, a thorough review of activity linked to or\nassociated with Berserk Bear is incredibly valuable both to understand the intentions of a worrisome adversary and to\nensure awareness for defenders and policymakers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Berserk timeline._\n\n**THE DRAGONFLY CAMPAIGN**\n\nBerserk Bear first entered public consciousness through public reporting from Symantec, Kaspersky and CrowdStrike (who\nthen referred to the entity as Energetic Bear) [5, 6, 7]. Piecing together observations from each vendor, we witness a\nwidespread campaign starting no later than 2010 (but possibly earlier) through at least 2014, targeting manufacturing, oil\nand gas, and electric utility entities across North America and Europe. On a technical level, this activity is notable for\nblending operational techniques. At various times, Berserk Bear utilized mechanisms ranging from traditional phishing to\nstrategic website compromise (SWC), to supply chain intrusions for initial access. In most cases, such operations led to the\ndeployment of actor-specific malware, notably (but not exclusively) the modular Havex family.\n\n**Phishing activity**\n\nThroughout its initial period of activity, Berserk leveraged phishing with malicious attachments as a primary component of\ninitial access operations [6]. In all documented cases, which were active in 2013 – 2014 but also potentially as early as\n2010, malicious emails were sent to various executives and senior employees at target companies. While multiple vendor\nreports indicate phishing messages originated from the same Gmail account, it is unclear if this is definitive or instead an\nartifact of limited visibility.\n\nIrrespective of vector, the phishing activity consistently leveraged the same vulnerability for initial code execution:\nCVE-2011-0611, relating to embedded Flash objects in file formats such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) items\n\n[5, 8, 9]. In addition to native PDFs, some vendor reporting also indicates distribution via XML Data Package (XDP) files,\nwith a malicious PDF stored within the container [6]. In either case, typical infection activity combined the exploit (for\ncode execution purposes), malware (typically Havex, discussed in greater detail below), and a Java archive (JAR) file used\nto load and execute the malware payload.\n\nAnalysing publicly and commercially available samples, attachments to malicious emails typically displayed gibberish or\nno substantive content, rather than a fully developed lure or decoy. This aspect of lure documents would change\nsignificantly with Berserk evolution, even if other characteristics of malicious document use would remain similar.\n\n**Strategic website compromise**\n\nBerserk employed SWC (also referred to as ‘watering hole attacks’) concurrently with phishing activity. While reporting\nfrom Symantec indicates SWC activity took place largely in mid- to late-2013, Kaspersky analysis indicates such activity\nmay have started significantly earlier and continued through 2014. Berserk compromised a variety of websites, ranging\nfrom the energy to financial sectors, to insert a redirect to another compromised, legitimate website hosting an exploit kit\n\n[5, 10]. Overall, initial modified websites trended toward industrial, oil and gas, and electrical entities based on reporting\nfrom multiple entities. An overview of compromised sites noted in public reporting can be found in Table 1.\n\nInitially, Berserk operations used the LightsOut exploit kit to compromise either Java or Internet Explorer to gain initial\ncode execution on victim machines [10, 11]. The group then modified operations to a newer variant of LightsOut, dubbed\n‘Hello’ or ‘HelloEK’ [5, 12, 13]. In all publicly identified cases, the exploit kits were used to download a payload: either a\nvariant of Havex or a malware referred to as Karagany.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Website|Description|\n|---|---|\n|39essex[.]com|Legal organization operating in UK, SG and MY.|\n|Bsicomputer[.]com|CA-located computer and server manufacturer.|\n|Chariotoilandgas[.]com|Oil exploration and services company.|\n|Energo-pro[.]ge|GE-based electric generation and transmission company.|\n|Energyplatform[.]eu|European renewable energy generation consortium, no longer active.|\n|Firstenergy[.]com|US-based electric utility.|\n|Gamyba[.]le[.]lt|Electric generation entity in LT.|\n|Gritech[.]fr|FR-based engineering consultancy.|\n|Gse[.]com[.]ge|National electric system operator for GE.|\n|Jfaerospace[.]com|US-based engineering consultancy.|\n|Longreachoilandgas[.]com|Oil and gas exploration company.|\n|Nahoonservices[.]com|e-Commerce services company, no longer active.|\n|Rare[.]fr|FR-based environmental and energy consortium.|\n|Samashmusic[.]com|Music equipment retailer.|\n|Sbmania[.]net|SpongeBob Squarepants fan site.|\n|Strainstall[.]com|Engineering and offshore oil and gas services company.|\n|Utilico[.]co[.]uk|UK-based investment trust, no longer active.|\n|Vitogaz[.]com|FR-based gas distribution company.|\n|Vitoreseau[.]com|FR-based gas and propane distribution company.|\n|Yell[.]ge|GE-focused business directory.|\n\n\n_Table 1: Overview of compromised sites noted in public reporting._\n\n**Supply chain intrusions**\n\nFinally, early Berserk-related activity utilized a third intrusion mechanism: modifying installation packages for specific\ncontrol system software to deliver Havex variants. In many respects the most interesting as well as the most concerning\nintrusion vector, this methodology relied on first breaching a given vendor or supplier of equipment (and software) for\nindustrial environments, producing a modified installation package including malicious functionality, then replacing\nlegitimate packages on vendor websites for ultimate victims to download.\n\nThis phase of operations is the most explicit in industrial control system (ICS)-specific targeting. As documented by Erik\nHjelmvik, Joel Langill, Dale Peterson, and others, Berserk activity included at least six software suites across three vendors\n\n[14, 15, 16]:\n\n - MESA Imaging Swiss Ranger photography software [17].\n\n - eWon Talk2M eCatcher industrial maintenance software [18].\n\n - eWon eGrabit VPN client software [19].\n\n - Various MB ConnectLine tools, including mbCONFTOOL, mbCHECK and VCOM_LAN2, all associated with\nconfiguration software for industrial networking appliances [20].\n\nIn each of the above cases, the victim organization represented a niche supplier often integrated into larger projects, or at\nminimum far smaller than major ICS-related original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Of note, although the intrusion at\n_MESA is unclear (and the company has since gone out of business), both eWon and MB Connect statements indicate initial_\nintrusions into their respective environments via content management system (CMS) vulnerabilities on their respective\nwebsites [21, 22]. In both cases, limited information indicates CMS vulnerabilities were leveraged by Berserk to upload\nmalicious variants of the companies’ software packages.\n\nAll three of the impacted companies are (or were, in the case of MESA) based in European countries. Furthermore, analysis\nof product applications and use indicate the respective software items were largely focused on or only present in European\n\n\n-----\n\nmarkets. Even more interesting, in the case of MB ConnectLine’s mbCHECK, which had both North American and\nEuropean software versions, only the European version was modified even though the CMS vulnerability used would have\nallowed for both products to be replaced with malicious variants. Although other manufacturers may have been impacted in\nthis event, the above observations strongly suggest a primary targeting focus on Western European industrial entities for\nthis portion of Berserk operations.\n\nTechnical examination of the modified binaries shows a common artifact in the Portable Executable (PE) header of each: an\n‘.ndata’ section with a raw size of zero but a large virtual size, indicative of packed or compressed software. In this case, the\nobservations align with a specific packaging mechanism: the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS). Although designed\nfor legitimate use, various malicious entities utilize NSIS packaging to obfuscate malware or evade detection.\n\nNearly all the original, unmodified binaries do not use NSIS for packaging software. Looking at PE header information\nbetween the malicious items associated with Berserk activity and pre- and post-attack software, the legitimate software\nitems feature dramatically different structures from the NSIS-packaged Berserk items.\n\n_Figure 3: Comparison of PE headers for mbCHECK installer._\n\nAlthough definitive evidence does not exist, what information is available strongly suggests that Berserk modified the\noriginal binaries to package them, along with other components, with NSIS. This technique is not unique to Berserk and is\nreflected in activity ranging from ransomware to targeted intrusions.\n\nOf note, the MESA Imaging SwissRanger software legitimately used NSIS packaging in benign versions of the software before\nand after the Berserk-related events. In this case, it is unclear precisely how Berserk modified the binary, unless access to\nsource packages and related items allowed the entity to repackage the NSIS installer to include malicious functionality.\n\nIn all observed cases, the modified ICS-related binaries typically contain similar functionality: deploying an encoded\nHavex DLL payload to victim machines. Specific deployment characteristics and filesystem location change depending on\nthe variant. But in all publicly known cases, modified installers drop the Havex DLL to disk then launch it via ‘rundll32’\ncalling a ‘RunDllEntry’ export, passing execution on to the malware.\n\n**Havex malware**\n\nAll available information and third-party reporting indicate that the ultimate purpose of original Berserk activity (the\n‘Dragonfly campaign’) was delivery and installation of Havex malware. While delivered in various ways, including in some\n\n\n-----\n\ncases through intermediate malware (described briefly below), Havex represents the identified, known end-goal of these\nearly 2010s intrusions.\n\nHavex serves as scaffolding around which other capabilities can be built, working in a modular fashion to incorporate\nadditional functionality given Berserk’s intentions or purpose. As such, Havex on its own is a mere loader for other\ncapabilities. Berserk delivered Havex as a DLL, typically embedded in other objects, which injects further code into the\n_Explorer process. Once running in the context of a trusted program, Havex reaches out via its command-and-control (C2)_\ncommunications to check in with its operators, and download additional functionality or modules [6, 23]. Havex persistence\nis relatively simple, writing itself to disk (usually %AppData%, %TEMP% or %System32%) and creating an auto-start\nregistry key.\n\nHavex only begins to become interesting when examining the follow-on modules that provide functionality. Based on\nreporting from multiple security vendors, Berserk used compromised, legitimate websites to host C2 and Havex modules, a\ntrend which would continue through subsequent Berserk activity post-Dragonfly. Module functionality includes several\ntypical intrusion capabilities: system profiling, network enumeration, password theft, and similar post-exploitation\nactivities.\n\nHowever, Havex also included specialized modules with a then-unique purpose: enumerating and mapping ICS-specific\nsystems in victim environments. Although relatively primitive, examination of the various modules shows a definite\nemphasis on ICS-related processes and protocols [24, 25]. For example, a network scanner module used in Havex\noperations features relatively straightforward scanning functionality, but does so with a particular interest in hard-coded\nICS-related ports, as described in Table 2.\n\n**Port number** **Associated service or software**\n\n102 Siemens SIMATIC PLC Communications\n\n502 Modbus over Ethernet\n\n11234 Measuresoft ScadaPro Communications\n\n12401 7-Technologies Graphical SCADA, GE Proficy License Server Manager, WllinTech KingSCADA\n\n44818 Rockwell Automation ControlLogix and RSLinx, Tec4Data SmartCooler, Cisco IOS Common\nIndustrial Protocol processor\n\n_Table 2: Hard-coded ICS-related ports._\n\nFor emphasis: the above are the only ports scanned on the /24 subnet of the executing machine. Other, typical ports\nenumerated such as remote access services are simply not present. Such behaviour indicates specific intentions to identify a\nrelatively narrow range of industrial products.\n\nIn addition to the above module, Havex also incorporates a protocol-specific enumeration utility focusing on the Open\nPlatform Communication (OPC) standard [6, 24, 26, 27]. The module enumerates OPC servers to identify clients and\nrelated information, but no known functionality exists to deliberately interact with or modify OPC functionality. As written,\nall publicly identified examples of this module appear to be reconnaissance-focused, with no capability to intentionally\ncause disruption or manipulation of industrial systems.\n\nAlthough not designed to cause disruption, testing of Havex’s OPC module reveals some concerning features. When tested\nin certain environments, the OPC module induces OPC server crashes, which have the possibility of inducing follow-on\nprocess instability [28, 29]. Uncontrolled process termination in industrial environments can lead to a number of\nconsequences, from short-term loss of visibility to potential process destruction. That the OPC enumeration feature\ncontained this ability is indicative of either a lack of thorough testing by Berserk-supporting developers, or a callousness\nwith respect to potential consequences from running such a tool. The implications of this will be examined shortly.\n\n**Other observed malware tools**\n\nIn addition to Havex, the Dragonfly campaign is associated with several other tools. Although in several cases not exclusive\nto the actor, the other items were also present in early Berserk activity:\n\n - Karagany, a remote access and information-stealing tool used as an intermediate item prior to the deployment of Havex\n\n[5, 30]. The malware is based on leaked code from the earlier crimeware-focused DreamLoader framework [31], and\nas such cannot be considered exclusive to Berserk operations.\n\n - Sysmain, a remote access tool packaged as a DLL for information gathering and follow-on command execution [6].\nWhile otherwise unremarkable, analysis from Kaspersky indicated that in at least some instances, compromised MESA\n_Imaging software delivered Sysmain as its payload rather than Havex, making it an exception to the majority of_\nobserved supply chain compromises. This feature is also significant as MESA Imaging products were originally\npackaged via NSIS, unlike other vectors which were modified to do so.\n\n|Port number|Associated service or software|\n|---|---|\n|102|Siemens SIMATIC PLC Communications|\n|502|Modbus over Ethernet|\n|11234|Measuresoft ScadaPro Communications|\n|12401|7-Technologies Graphical SCADA, GE Proficy License Server Manager, WllinTech KingSCADA|\n|44818|Rockwell Automation ControlLogix and RSLinx, Tec4Data SmartCooler, Cisco IOS Common Industrial Protocol processor|\n\n\n-----\n\n - DDex, a lightweight downloader with persistence capability [6]. The malware takes its name from observed instances\nin the wild, named ‘ddex.exe’. Of note, in the few samples available for analysis, file names and paths are hard coded,\nindicating a somewhat brittle tool used as an intermediary to load additional functionality.\n\n - ClientX, which, based on analysis from Kaspersky, is functionally identical to Sysmain, but written in .NET [6].\n\nOther than Karagany, the remaining tools associated with early Berserk operations are only documented in reporting from\n_Kaspersky relating to what it refers to as ‘Crouching Yeti’. Yet other than Karagany’s origins in leaked code, the remaining_\ntools all appear to be uniquely associated with early Berserk operations with no evidence of widespread use. The latter\npoint is further emphasized in that, while the Dragonfly campaign featured analysis from multiple organizations, only one\nentity (Kaspersky) identified (or at least publicly documented) payloads beyond Havex and Karagany in reporting.\n\n**Campaign targeting**\n\nThe Dragonfly campaign started no later than 2010 and appears to have concluded in 2014 following public disclosure. During\nthis period, the threat actor impacted several entities. Yet the precise geography and industry vertical of victims shifts\ndepending on what public reporting one consults. For example, reporting from Symantec and CrowdStrike emphasize energy\nsector entities across Europe and North America as primary victims in the Dragonfly campaign [5, 7]. However, reporting from\n_Kaspersky shows quite widespread activity, including multiple victims in South America, Central and Southeast Asia, and the_\nRussian Federation, with significant representation from educational and government entities among known victims [6].\n\nBased on the above, the Dragonfly campaign appears confusing. Depending on the source, the campaign either appears\nfocused on ICS-related entities and critical infrastructure, or functions as a much wider targeting entity among both critical\ninfrastructure and traditional espionage targets. From a broader cyber threat intelligence (CTI) perspective, this situation\nhighlights how different types of visibility into events can produce different conclusions.\n\nIn the case of early Berserk behaviours, the Dragonfly campaign appears to be widespread in overall nature. However, by\n2013, the combination of SWC targets, specific Havex modules, and documented victimology strongly suggests the main\nthrust of the later stages of the Dragonfly campaign was gaining initial access to and performing reconnaissance of\nindustrial and critical infrastructure entities. Such activity took place across the oil and gas and manufacturing verticals in\nEurope and North America, with potential for activity in other regions as well. While concerning, such intrusions appear to\nhave stopped at information gathering without any disruptive impact or clear intention to deliver such an effect, or so it\nwould seem.\n\n**POSSIBLE DESTRUCTIVE INCIDENT**\n\nWhile there is nothing publicly known about the Dragonfly campaign and early Berserk activity, or in the capabilities of\nany software associated with these activities, that indicates such actions were intended to disrupt critical infrastructure\nenvironments, this observation does not remove the possibility of unintentional or accidental disruption while operating in\nsuch networks. Given the environments in which Berserk operated during parts of the Dragonfly campaign, even though the\ngroup likely did not have disruptive intent, the possibility exists for unintended consequences in sensitive environments.\n\nReviewing Havex functionality, interesting possibilities emerge. When looking specifically at the OPC enumeration utility,\ntesting in multiple environments demonstrated that this utility could cause a scanned OPC server to crash. Depending on\nerror handling and other controls, such an abrupt event could result in follow-on process instability. Therefore, while the\nDragonfly campaign appears to focus on espionage or, at worst, initial access to sensitive environments for later operational\nflexibility, the mere execution of one of the responsible entity’s survey programs could result in inadvertent disruption.\n\nIn an annual review of events taking place in 2014, the German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)\ndisclosed a disruptive incident at an unnamed steel mill resulting in physical destruction [32, 33]. Unfortunately, many\nspecific details around this event, including precisely when it occurred, were not provided in BSI’s reporting. Yet given\nwhen the report was released, as part of a review of events in 2014, we can assess with moderate confidence that the event\ntook place in 2014, and with high confidence (given the volatile nature of digital evidence to assess this as a cyber incident)\nthat the event took place not long before then. This tentative timeline would place the steel mill incident in the same period\nof time as the Dragonfly campaign.\n\nReviewing limited details of the steel mill event, BSI reporting indicates that unnamed intruders leveraged spear phishing to\ngain credentials from users in the victim environment to enable initial access. The intruder then pivoted throughout the\nenvironment until actions resulted in multiple components of the victim entity’s blast furnace to fail, inducing physical\ndamage.\n\nAlthough none of the reporting or analysing entities at the time of the incident made conclusive attribution statements, with\nthe benefit of hindsight we can draw some potential conclusions. While the tradecraft (loosely) documented in BSI\nreporting (phishing and credential capture for lateral movement) is rather common, such activity also aligns with Berserk\noperations in the Dragonfly campaign, and closely aligns with follow-on Berserk actions documented below. Additionally,\nthe Dragonfly campaign featured extensive intrusions into European manufacturing organizations from at least 2010\nthrough 2014, which links to the steel mill incident in terms of industry vertical and geography. Finally, the unstable nature\n\n\n-----\n\nof the OPC enumeration payload of Havex could induce process instability through ICS disruption, which could yield a\npotentially destructive result, depending on the environment.\n\nWhile insufficient evidence exists in publicly available resources to confirm any of the above observations, the combination\nof timing, victimology, and (inadvertent) capability points to Berserk Bear as a likely suspect for inducing the steel mill\nincident. Even though the event was almost certainly unintended, the effects produced show the risks inherent in operating\nin critical infrastructure or similar environments.\n\n**RESURGENCE: DRAGONFLY 2.0 TO PALMETTO FUSION**\n\nFollowing multiple public disclosures in 2014, Berserk-related activity appeared to cease after the Dragonfly campaign. Yet\nin 2017, researchers at Symantec disclosed a new campaign of phishing (combined with SWC) designed to capture\ncredentials from victims [34]. This reporting was reflected in subsequent US government notifications [35], which were\nlater revised to indicate a link to Russian state-sponsored activity [36]. Although the Symantec and US government\nreporting overlap, analysis of specific behaviours, targeting and tooling indicates a bifurcation in campaigns. Symantec’s\nDragonfly 2.0 activity appears aligned with targeting of Turkey and European entities from late 2015 through 2017, while\nUS reporting, referenced as ‘Palmetto Fusion’ in initial disclosures, targeted US and UK electric sector entities from 2017\nthrough at least 2019 [37, 38].\n\nGiven disclosures in 2014, Berserk appears to have taken only a short break in operations between the original Dragonfly\ncampaign and this activity. Within that time though, the group substantially modified operations while preserving enough\ntechnical and other links to associate this activity with previous campaigns. While behavioural characteristics of the\nactivities shifted, which would justify tracking this activity (including components of these campaigns) as separate\nbehavioural clusters, sufficient evidence exists combined with government disclosures to justify linking all these activities\nback to the same likely ‘sponsor’ or entity under Berserk Bear.\n\n**Continued phishing and strategic website compromise**\n\nAs with the Dragonfly campaign, Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion leveraged phishing and SWC for initial access\npurposes. However, while targeting characteristics (focus on energy-themed entities and concepts) were similar to earlier\nactivities, actual functionality was substantially different. Rather than utilize malicious documents or SWC to directly\ndeploy capabilities (e.g. exploits or malware) on victim systems, all observed items in this campaign instead used\nfunctionality in Windows operating systems to generate an outbound Server Message Block (SMB) communication to\nadversary-controlled infrastructure. If successful and collected, Berserk would then harvest NTLM credentials from this\nconnection to replay for remote access into victim environments, potentially via tools such as Responder [39].\n\n**_Fun with Phishery_**\n\nPublic indications of energy sector-focused phishing activity first appeared in July 2017 from researchers at Cisco Talos\n\n[40], although parallel non-public reporting existed in US government circles followed by media disclosure of some\nhigh-profile victims [41]. Malicious documents leveraged implementations of an open-source tool called Phishery for\ninjecting a remote resource, prompting an outbound SMB connection, into the file [42].\n\nWhile technically rather simple, targeting and document construction appears to be quite specific to victim organizations\nand industry verticals. For example, initial phishing activity linked to Dragonfly 2.0 targeted a Turkish oil and gas entity\nusing a holiday party theme, and an unnamed entity spoofing ISO 27001 awareness.\n\n_Figure 4: Phishing samples, Dragonfly 2.0._\n\n\n-----\n\nLater examples, more closely aligned with the Palmetto Fusion activity documented by the US government, generally used\nwell-crafted resumes for power engineers as lures with an ultimate focus on US and UK targets in the electric sector.\n\n_Figure 5: Palmetto Fusion resume phish._\n\nAlthough straightforward, the phishing campaigns in question, especially the later Palmetto Fusion stages, are interesting\ngiven strategic targeting of service providers as intermediate victims. As documented by Rebecca Smith and Robert Barry,\nthe entities responsible for this campaign appeared to compromise various contractors and other entities first, and used\nthese entities to then distribute the malicious emails and credential leaking documents to electric utility victims [43]. In this\nfashion, trust-subversion tactics previously observed in the Dragonfly campaign resurfaced, but this time targeting service\nrelationships rather than software dependencies. Through a sequence of intermediate compromises, Berserk could move\nfrom service providers to ultimate victims, leveraging existing trust relationships to improve the likelihood of successful\ninteraction with malicious attachments.\n\n_Figure 6: Palmetto Fusion campaign targeting sequence._\n\n**_Leaking credentials from websites_**\n\nSWC activity related to Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion activity followed the same behavioural pattern as the malicious\ndocuments: leaking credentials from victims, and not delivering exploits or malicious payloads directly. While avoiding\nsuch active content in modified web pages, these campaigns continued an emphasis on energy and related entities, as seen\nin the list of compromised sites involved in the incident (Table 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n|Website|Campaign|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|ameresco[.]com|Dragonfly 2.0|US-based renewable energy-focused engineering services.|\n|cfemedia[.]com|Dragonfly 2.0|US-based online publisher.|\n|cfemedia.gcnpublishing[.]com|Dragonfly 2.0|US-based online publisher.|\n|controleng[.]com|Palmetto Fusion|Control system engineering publication.|\n|csemag[.]com|Palmetto Fusion|Engineering-focused publication|\n|gama[.]com.tr|Dragonfly 2.0|TR-based holding company including energy investments.|\n|grand-central[.]net|Dragonfly 2.0|Customer data platform.|\n|oilandgaseng[.]com|Palmetto Fusion|Oil and gas engineering publication.|\n|plantengineering[.]com|Palmetto Fusion|Control systems engineering publication.|\n|reenergyholding[.]com|Dragonfly 2.0|Renewable energy company.|\n|turcas.[.]com.tr|Dragonfly 2.0|TR-based oil and gas company.|\n\n\n_Table 3: List of compromised sites involved in the incident._\n\nImplementation of SWC varied depending on timing and targeting. Dragonfly 2.0 targeting of European and Turkish\nenergy entities used a nested mechanism for redirecting queries, potentially acting as a filtering mechanism and similar to\nearlier Dragonfly activity, before arriving at the ultimate resource inducing the SMB connection [44]. A modified PHP\nobject first directs to one Virtual Private Server (VPS) via HTTP, which then attempts to retrieve a file object via SMB from\na different VPS instance.\n\nLater activity, corresponding with the largely US- and UK-focused Palmetto Fusion activity, appears to focus on\ncompromise of the TYPO3 Content Management System (CMS) to modify a JavaScript object (typically jquery.easing.js).\nCMS targeting, while not uncommon, links to the subversion of ICS software providers in the Dragonfly campaign. During\nPalmetto Fusion operations, multiple websites for power, energy, and engineering publications featured a modification to\nthe same resource with the following path:\n\n/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js\n\nWhen loaded, the modified library attempts to retrieve a 1x1 pixel image referencing an external object to prompt the\nexternal authentication attempt. Unlike the Turkish campaigns taking place earlier, this activity directly references\nadversary-controlled infrastructure as opposed to using redirects to obfuscate activity or introduce possible filtering.\n\n_Figure 7: Injected code example._\n\nIn addition to distinctions in direct reference of external resources, the two campaigns also feature differences in\ninfrastructure characteristics. While the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign appears to largely rely on adversary-owned and -controlled\nVPS infrastructure, the Palmetto Fusion campaign almost exclusively leverages legitimate, compromised network\ninfrastructure. As documented by Kaspersky, parallel Berserk-related operations focused on gathering infrastructure\nthrough server compromise, both to deploy SWC and to provide infrastructure to receive leaked credentials [45].\n\n**Change in tools and deployed capabilities**\n\nAlthough the Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion campaigns represent near continuous operations from late 2015 through at\nleast 2019, substantial differences in post-intrusion behaviour align with the geographic and temporal separation in\ncampaigns. Differences are significant enough that, using behaviour-focused attribution methodologies, the campaigns\ncould be taken as the actions of separate, distinct activity groups. Yet identified overlaps in infrastructure, targeting and\nsome techniques indicate that, at minimum, these operations were executed by entities pursuing similar objectives, if not\nseparate teams within the same organization.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier activities corresponding to Turkish and other targeting in the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign closely resemble the original\nDragonfly activity in many characteristics. While initial access mechanisms are noticeably different, post-intrusion\ntradecraft mirrors original Dragonfly operations through the use of a combination of various types of malware, including\nsome types narrowly associated with Berserk operations such as Karagany variants and a unique backdoor referred to by\n_Symantec as Heriplor, closely linked to Havex-related payloads from the Dragonfly campaign [34]._\n\nLater activity, aligned with the Palmetto Fusion phase of operations, shifted behaviours noticeably. While Berserk\nemployed similar intrusion techniques to the Dragonfly 2.0 activity (credential-leaking phishing and SWC), post-intrusion\nbehaviours were substantially different. Particularly, these operations featured the near-complete absence of any custom\ntooling or malware. Instead, lateral movement and post-exploitation activity focused on a combination of continuous\ncredential capture and reuse and the deployment of either legitimate tools used maliciously or publicly available\nframeworks for intrusion operations, such as the PSExec utility or leveraging system commands to create and enable\nadversary-controlled accounts.\n\n**ICS-specific activity**\n\nIn the Palmetto Fusion phase of operations, reporting from multiple commercial, media and government entities confirms\nthat Berserk sought and, in several cases, succeeded in gaining access to industrial environments, including control\nsystems. Yet unlike the Dragonfly campaign, no ICS-specific tooling or capability, such as Havex’s OPC item or related\nport scanners, were identified. At first glance, this appears to represent a devolution of capability, moving from ICS-aware\nsoftware to only using native commands and similar for reconnaissance purposes.\n\nYet given the previous discussion of the German steel mill incident and its potential connection to the Dragonfly campaign,\nthis operational change may represent an adjustment following that event. If Berserk was responsible for this incident, after\n(inadvertently) causing a disruptive incident through the somewhat buggy OPC polling entity, Berserk appears to have\nmodified its tradecraft to avoid capabilities that would result in similar unintended consequences. Particularly given that\nthis campaign largely focused on critical infrastructure entities in the US, an accidental disruption in these environments\nwould presumably be quite costly or risky, arguing for greater caution.\n\nBerserk’s restraint is shown in what actions the entity took in control system environments: searching for and copying items\nsuch as remote access profiles and control system-related documentation. When accessing more sensitive equipment, such\nas human-machine interfaces (HMIs) within a victim environment, Berserk deployed a custom tool to take a screenshot of\nthe system which was exfiltrated via existing remote access mechanisms, shown in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8: Exfiltrated screenshot of victim HMI._\n\n\n-----\n\nThus, while Berserk’s ability to access these environments is quite concerning, all available evidence indicates this entity\nsought to avoid any potential disruptive or unintentionally destructive impact. Whether this is a result of learning from the\nsteel mill incident, or an abundance of caution given the targets, we can look at these ICS-related intrusions as representing\naccess development and information gathering (potentially to enable future operations) as opposed to an immediate ‘attack’\nor similar [46].\n\n**Distinguishing Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion from Dragonfly**\n\nReviewing activity from Dragonfly to Dragonfly 2.0 to Palmetto Fusion, we can observe a steady evolution in operations\nand behaviours through each campaign. Illustrated Figure 9, we observe overlaps from one campaign to the next, but\nsufficient development such that Dragonfly and Palmetto Fusion ultimately look like separate operations aside from\noverlaps in targeting. Without the Dragonfly 2.0 activity serving as a vital link between the two, with its continued use of\nDragonfly-related tools but introduction of credential harvesting as a primary mechanism which the Palmetto Fusion phase\nwould rely on almost exclusively, drawing a line of continuity through these activities would be problematic. Yet because of\nthis iterative nature between campaigns, with only some aspects altered while others remain the same, we can link these\ngroups together as likely phases for the same entity, Berserk Bear.\n\n_Figure 9: Comparing Dragonfly, Palmetto Fusion and Dragonfly 2.0._\n\n**NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE INTRUSIONS**\n\nConcurrent with Palmetto Fusion activity in 2018, US and UK government reporting identified another campaign targeting\ncritical infrastructure environments [47, 48]. Subsequent discussions with victims and other sources indicate that the\nelectric sector was a primary, although not exclusive, target of this campaign. While US and UK sources did not attribute\nthis campaign to any specific threat actor (other than identifying it as Russian in origin), several items tangentially link this\nactivity to Berserk:\n\n - Targeting of critical infrastructure sectors directly and indirectly through service provider relationships (in this case,\nInternet service providers).\n\n - Timing that overlaps with the Palmetto Fusion phishing and SWC campaign.\n\n - Use of credential harvesting and replay to enable access and subsequent operations in victim environments.\n\n - Leveraging built-in system functionality and tools to modify configurations and other items for malicious purposes.\n\nWhile the above indicate a potential link, operations against network infrastructure devices such as routers would represent\na significant departure from known Berserk behaviours going back to the Dragonfly campaign. The identified activity may\nrepresent a link to the same ultimate decision-making authority within Russian intelligence operations, but behaviourally\nappears too distinct to firmly link to Berserk based on publicly available information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Recent activity**\n\nBeginning in 2019, SWC activity resembling previous Berserk operations in the Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion\ncampaigns reappeared. While remaining largely focused on critical infrastructure entities, targeting scope expanded to\ninclude entities such as airports, government and election authorities, and general media items.\n\n**Ukrainian political and energy entities**\n\nIn early to mid-February 2019, various websites in Ukraine featured compromises similar to past Berserk operations. In\naddition to targeting the Ukrainian energy sector, such as injecting into various subdomains for Ukrainian energy\nconglomerate Dtek, the campaign expanded in May 2019 to include various media and cultural entities.\n\n**Website** **Description**\n\ndtek[.]com Ukrainian energy conglomerate.\n\nunn[.]com[.]ua Ukrainian media entity.\n\nntn[.]ua Ukrainian media entity.\n\nzomua[.]tv Ukrainian media entity.\n\nfcdynamo[.]kiev[.]ua Ukrainian football club.\n\n_Table 4: Ukrainian websites featuring compromises._\n\nIn many cases, these compromises persisted through at least late 2020 [49]. Examination of specific SWC instances shows\na combination of injecting into static web pages, a tactic not observed in earlier activity, and modifying various JavaScript\nitems in a manner nearly identical to the Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion campaigns.\n\nFrom a targeting perspective this activity shows flexibility in what appear to be Berserk-related operations. In terms of\ntiming, initial compromises coincided with Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election. From this, we can hypothesize that\nBerserk-related operations were ‘retasked’ to cover this strategically significant event (from a Russian perspective). While\nthis seems plausible, the very broad nature of some of the targets, including major general media sites and a popular\nfootball club, indicates a very wide, unfocused net for activity. This lack of specificity is further emphasized by the lack of\nintermediate, ‘screening’ links as seen in historical Berserk-related activity.\n\n**Airports and Western infrastructure**\n\nIn April 2019, multiple entities identified a modification to San Francisco International Airport’s website (the primary web\npage, and a mirrored resource) [50]. Further analysis revealed a SWC incident essentially identical to historical Berserk\nactivity. Additional research identified over a dozen other airports in the United States exhibiting similar signs of\ncompromise in 2020, indicating a potential expansion of Berserk-related activity to transportation-related entities. Of note,\navailable evidence does not appear to indicate targeting of the airports as the primary objective, but rather inducing the\nsame credential leak behaviours to target visitors to the airport websites.\n\nSubsequent reporting in October 2020 identified further intrusions into transportation and local government networks in the\nUS [51, 52]. Most worrying about these intrusions, events appeared to extend into election and related infrastructure in line\nwith the 2020 US Presidential election. In this sense, activity mirrors the earlier Ukraine-focused activity, in being linked to\na major political event. As with other Berserk activity, the event is not linked to any known, attempted disruptive activity,\nand likely represents either intelligence gathering or, at most, opportunistic prepositioning for future operations.\nNonetheless, this extension to election-related infrastructure in state and local government networks represents a worrying\nexpansion in targeting.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP TO RUSSIAN-LINKED CYBER OPERATIONS**\n\nAlthough the original Dragonfly campaign largely evaded any specific attribution, the US and UK governments\nsubsequently linked Dragonfly 2.0 and Palmetto Fusion campaign activity to Russian intelligence operations [36, 53].\nWhile such statements establish a degree of high-level responsibility for events, such ‘general attribution’ claims are not\nespecially helpful for network defenders and critical infrastructure operators [54].\n\nRussian-nexus cyber operations targeting external entities largely break down into actions guided or executed by teams\nunder three entities: the Military General Staff’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB),\nand the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) [55]. In addition to academic interest in aligning cyber operations with their\nlikely sponsor organization, the missions and behaviours of these different organizations can give us insight into potential\nintentions and purpose. For example, GRU-aligned entities possess a history of engaging in direct, deliberate disruptive\noperations, such as the Ukraine power events and similar incidents tied to the GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies,\nUnit 74455, commonly referred to as Sandworm [4, 56]. Meanwhile operations associated with the SVR, although at times\n\n|Website|Description|\n|---|---|\n|dtek[.]com|Ukrainian energy conglomerate.|\n|unn[.]com[.]ua|Ukrainian media entity.|\n|ntn[.]ua|Ukrainian media entity.|\n|zomua[.]tv|Ukrainian media entity.|\n|fcdynamo[.]kiev[.]ua|Ukrainian football club.|\n\n\n-----\n\ninvolving critical infrastructure sectors, are exclusively linked with intelligence gathering and similar activity, even in\nrecent widespread campaigns such as NOBELIUM-related activity. [57] [58]\n\nGiven Berserk’s continued operations against critical infrastructure targets for over a decade, understanding how this group\naligns with more general Russian-nexus cyber operations can be quite valuable in determining potential motivations. For\nexample, alignment with GRU entities would indicate the potential for rapid movement from intrusion to deliberate\ndisruptive or destructive actions, while alignment with either of the civilian intelligence agencies (FSB or SVR) would\nstrongly suggest either an intelligence or long-term ‘prepositioning’ focus rather than attempting immediate impacts.\n\nIn 2018, the UK’s NCSC published a lengthy list of disruptive or controversial operations linked with various elements of\nthe GRU [56]. The list includes high-profile incidents such as the Ukraine electric sector attacks along with other\noperations, but notably omits elements of the Palmetto Fusion campaign (which also targeted the UK electric sector) and\nthe network infrastructure compromises discussed previously that may also link to Berserk operations [48]. Although\nunfortunately not definitive, the lack of any public link between Berserk operations with GRU-related incidents allows us to\nprovisionally conclude that Berserk is not part of Russia’s military intelligence apparatus, with its history of launching\ndisruptive events.\n\nIf we begin to look at Russia’s civilian intelligence organizations, the SVR and FSB, other possibilities begin to emerge\n\n[59]. Although no threat actor associated with the SVR or FSB is associated with a high-profile critical infrastructure event\nsuch as the Ukraine attacks, and responsibility for the 2017 Triton event remains unknown beyond general Russian\nresponsibility [60, 61], various campaigns linked to these entities have previously touched industrial and critical networks.\nExamples include the NOBELIUM campaign, along with historical activity linked to SVR-associated APT29 [62, 63].\n\nThe above observations are supported by limited information, primarily leaked from government sources, indicating that\nBerserk likely resides under FSB authorities [37, 41]. Reviewing available evidence, this appears to make sense for several\nreasons:\n\n - Lack of known, intentional disruptive operations against critical infrastructure (assuming Berserk is responsible for the\nsteel mill incident, and that this was an accident).\n\n - Absence of any group consistently targeting critical and industrial infrastructure linked to FSB authorities among\nRussian intelligence agencies.\n\n_Figure 10: Overview of Russia-linked cyber actors._\n\n\n-----\n\n - Possessing independent, unrelated ICS-related capabilities from all other entities linked to Russian intelligence\noperations.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the above items are simply stating what Berserk is not (specifically, not the GRU, and probably not\nthe SVR) rather than saying what Berserk actually is. As such, while multiple sources imply a link between Berserk Bear\nand Russia’s FSB, publicly available evidence does not exist at this point to solidify this link. Yet even though we have\nfailed in deriving specific attribution for Berserk, we can still make reasonable claims with respect to Berserk’s operations\nand likely intentions: to gather intelligence on and access to targets of interest, but likely not to move toward immediately\nusing such access for disruptive purposes except in extreme circumstances (such as armed conflict).\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nBerserk Bear, an entity known by many names over many years, carved a fascinating history through operations targeting\nmultiple facets of European and North American critical infrastructure entities. Aside from the group’s longevity (taking\nbehavioural evolutions into account), the group also demonstrated the capability to interact with ICS-related environments\nthrough multiple mechanisms. Yet despite the group’s history and technical prowess, it frequently receives second billing\n(at best) relative to other Russian-linked entities such as Turla, Sandworm and NOBELIUM.\n\nBerserk may be overlooked because in many respects (aside from the potential steel mill incident) it represents the ‘dog\nthat didn’t bark’. For all the group’s activity, it is not linked to any single, definitive incident or disruptive event that would\ngarner headlines and attention. While operations from the Palmetto Fusion campaign through the present indicate\nexpanding appetites for the group, there is no Triton incident or large-scale power disruption associated with the entity.\n\nBut adopting this view is myopic to say the least, and quite likely dangerous given Berserk’s demonstrated capabilities.\nPrincipally, Berserk Bear has repeatedly demonstrated the willingness and ability to penetrate industrial and critical\ninfrastructure environments for over ten years. In doing so, the group has almost certainly facilitated significant intelligence\ngathering, capability development, and potentially effects pre-positioning in highly sensitive networks. While available\ninformation indicates Berserk has not deliberately engaged in disruptive acts thus far, the group has laid the groundwork for\npotentially crippling attacks through its persistence and ability to generally avoid significant attention. While a Berserk\nBear intrusion may not be associated with an immediate attack like some other Russian-linked intrusion sets, asset owners\nand network defenders would do well to treat any sign of this group as deeply worrisome. While Berserk’s impacts may be\ndelayed, the group remains one of the most stubborn and capable entities willing to dive straight to the heart of vital\nnetworks across multiple industry verticals and geographies.\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**\n\nThe above analysis and research spans multiple organizations and individuals.
