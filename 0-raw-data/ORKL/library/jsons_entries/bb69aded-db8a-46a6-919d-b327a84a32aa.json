Removable storage devices\nare commonly used to exploit the vulnerability of individual nodes, as well as the associated networks,\nby transferring data and viruses in the isolated industrial control system. A mathematical model of\nan arbitrary order system is constructed and analyzed numerically to depict the control mechanism.\nA local and global stability analysis of the system is performed on the equilibrium points derived\nfor the value of α = 1. To understand the depth of fractional model behavior, numerical simulations\nare carried out for the distinct order of the fractional derivative system, and the results show that\nfractional order models provide rich dynamics by means of fast transient and super-slow evolution\nof the model’s steady-state behavior, which are seldom perceived in integer-order counterparts.\n\n**Keywords: fractional-order virus models; stuxnet virus; numerical computing; supervisory control**\nand data acquisition systems; computer networks; lyapunov analysis\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nA small piece of software code or program in a computer system that works on\na system without the consent of the user may cause damage or steal information for\nthe exploitation of the desired targets. In strategic conflicting environments, as well\nas in the financial market, computer viruses can be used in a network operation as a\ndigital weapon against the desired targets, e.g., a computer spyware program used as an\ninformation collection platform in the Syrian war [1], or Shamoon and Stuxnet viruses\nfor cyber incidents [2]. The tools used for cyberwar vary from a tiny code that exhibits\nannoying messages on the console to a complicated routine that physically damages the\nsystem, such as Stuxnet [3]. Stuxnet was discovered at Natanz, Iran, a nuclear enrichment\nfacility, in June 2010 [4]. The name of the Stuxnet virus was derived from two keywords\nin its source code, .stub and mrxnet.sys. The Stuxnet virus is a sophisticated piece of\ncode that mainly targets the supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA),\nexploits zero-day vulnerabilities/bugs to attack the targeted hosts, and uses advanced\ntechnology to hide from guard programs. The Stuxnet virus exploits different services,\nsuch as a print spooler (MS 10-061), the zero-day vulnerability of the windows system,\nnetwork shares, file-sharing and server message block (SMB), etc. Stuxnet virus monitors\nthe frequency of motors operating centrifuge machines before modification, which must be\nin the range of from 807 Hertz to 1210 Hertz. Stuxnet virus controls the running frequency\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 2 of 27\n\nof centrifuge machines for a short interval of time to 1410 Hertz and then decreases to 2 Hz\nand increases to 1064 Hertz. A change in the output frequency of the motors essentially\nsabotages the working of machines [5]. Due to the attack of the Stuxnet virus, approximately\n1000 centrifuge machines were out of order, of a total of 5000 machines operating in the Iran\nnuclear facility at Natanz [6]. The purpose of the virus was not just to infect the computers,\nbut to cause real-world physical damage.\nA theoretical study of the Stuxnet’s malicious code behavior was conducted through\nthe strength of epidemic modeling of virus spread [7–9]. The control scheme of these\nmalicious codes is very challenging because they often hide, and may exploit zero-day\nvulnerabilities, gain administrative rights and execute code as an authenticated program.\nThe development in technologies creates new issues regarding the safety and security of\nthe critical infrastructure of the countries in the presence of these vulnerabilities and smart\nviruses. The desire to manufacture an automated process immensely increases software\ndependencies, which ultimately require lengthy and complex routines.\nThese complex codes are challenging to screen out completely using software testing\nmechanisms, and leftover vulnerabilities in these codes can compromise the whole system [10]. Therefore, the comprehensive and dynamic study of these codes is a promising\ndomain for research communities to investigate.\nThe spread of the virus in a computer network is closely related to the spread of\nbiological viruses in the population. Mathematical and statistical models are often based\non concepts and methods borrowed from physics. Models play an important role in\ninfection control by quickly predicting and understanding disease outbreaks. In recent\ndecades, new infectious diseases have been observed, together with the development of\neliminated technologies.\nThe ability to quickly measure the unfolding of outbreaks, communications, and\nmovements is key to capturing the spread of a virus. The inherent complexity of such\nmethods limits the study of these processes. However, developments in technology are\nhelping to lift these limitations [11]. Classical approaches and linear thinking are unable\nto effectively mitigate the problem due to the lack of equilibrium and non-linear nature\nof the problems. A complex system, its counter-intuitive behavior, and other macrolevel changes can be addressed by applying complex sciences. The usual models did\nnot provide an in-depth picture of real system dynamics because these systems neglect\nfeedback scenarios, cascade effects, and instabilities. To predict the global-scale spread of\ndisease dynamics, several factors, such as demographic disparity, mobility scenarios which\ninclude air-flow system, commuter movement in the area, disease-specific information,\nand control mechanisms, should be acccounted for. There has long been work on the\ndevelopment of mathematical models for use in the analysis of infectious disease behavior.\nThe mathematical model of Daniel Bernoulli against smallpox disease was published\nin 1766. Mathematical models of these types were designed to elaborate the behavior\nof an epidemic over the course of time, in which every single population of the virus\nis assumed to interact with the individual of other populations. The ability to monitor\nhidden outbreaks, as well as contact and communication, are key to the portrayal of\ndisease-spreading [12]. It is known that immunizing a large fraction of the population or\na computer network, the epidemic that spreads upon contact between infected nodes or\nindividuals can be stopped.\nSome diseases require 80–90% immunization (measles requires 95%), and the same\nis true for the computer, where 100% immunization from the Internet may stop viruses\nin connected networks [13]. Mathematical modeling of infectious disease or viruses in\nbiology or in computer systems gives us a thorough understanding of the problem and\nhelps us to devise a reliable, viable, and robust control strategy [14]. It was observed that\nthe state of the various biological organisms at a certain time depends on its past states and\nfractional derivatives that also contains those characteristics. Thus, a fractional derivative\nis a natural approach to the solution of these biological systems. Mathematical modeling is\nused in numerous disciplines of science and engineering problems [15,16]. Kermack and\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 3 of 27\n\nMcKendrick founded mathematical modeling at the beginning of twentieth century with\na series of publications, and introduced a susceptible, infected and recovered epidemic\nmodel [17]. In this field, several other scientists, biologists, computer engineers and\nmathematicians have worked on epidemic modeling and published work in this area, such\nas time delay virus models [18], a fractional epidemiological model [19], antivirus strategy\nfor computer virus model [20], modified susceptible, infected and susceptible models [21]\nand epidemic models with two control mechanisms, quarantine and immunity [22], and\nmodels that highlight the topological facets of the network [23]. Besides these, the role\nof fundamental concepts and underlying theories of fractional calculus was effectively\napplied in modeling complex systems in diversified fields with rich dynamics compared to\nits integer counterparts [24–27]. Considering these facts, the current study aims to exploit\nthe rich heritage of fractional dynamics for the development of the fractional Stuxnet\nvirus model by using the features of the Stuxnet model to illustrate the virus spread in\nSCADA systems [28]. In this study, a fractional-order mathematical model of the Stuxnet\nvirus is presented to study the ultra-fast transient and slow evolutions of the virus spread\ndynamic and attack pattern on isolated critical infrastructures, managed by industrial\ncontrol computers. The contribution of the proposed fractional Stuxnet virus model is\nbriefly described as:\n\n           - A novel fractional-order Stuxnet virus model is proposed by exploiting the rich\nheritage of fractional calculus in an isolated and air-gapped network environment.\n\n           - Stability analysis of Stuxnet virus model for both local and global equilibrium points\nwhen disease-free, and endemic spread is performed.\n\n           - Correctness of the proposed Grunwald–Letnikov-based fractional numerical solver is\nascertained, with close results to the state-of-the-art Runge–Kutta numerical solver\nfor integer-order variants of the model.\n\n           - Numerical simulation with Grunwald–Letnikov-based fractional numerical solver for\na distinct order of the fractional derivative terms in the system shows that fractionalorder models offer rich characteristics by way of ultrafast transience and ultra-slow\nadvancements of steady-state.\n\n**2. Fractional Calculus Fundamentals**\n_2.1. Preliminaries_\n\nFractional calculus is a branch of mathematics and a generalization of the calculus\ntheory of integrals and derivatives of a real number or complex number power. The discussion of fractional calculus was started 300 years ago, and the idea of fractional calculus\nwas first listed in the literature with a letter from Leibniz to L’Hostital in 1696. In this letter,\na half-derivative term was introduced, i.e., the generalization of the derivative operator\n_D[α]_ _f (), where α, representing the order of a fractional derivative. The history of the frac-_\ntional derivative is as long as the classical differential operators in calculus, but the inherent\nstrength of the fractional operator is relatively less exploited in engineering domains until\nthe early 1980s. The physical interpretation of the fractional derivative outcomes is still\nambiguous, and remained an open debate for clarity in the research community. However,\nthe fractional derivative is an inspiring operator to describe the physics of many modeling\nphenomena, which are difficult to realize through integer-order derivatives. Recently,\nthe kernel function of a fractional derivative is referred to as a memory function, and\nfractional-order derivative is proposed as a memory index [29,30] with different types\nof kernel [31–36]. The theory development of fractional calculus belonged to the efforts\nof several scientists, such as Letnikov, Liouville, Euler, and Riemann [37,38]. Different\ndefinitions of fractional order derivatives have existed; the most-used definitions are those\nof Riemann–Liouville (RL), Caputo (CP), and Grunwald–Letnikov (GL) [39]. The GL\ndefinition of fractional derivative is as follows:\n\n\n_GL_ 1\n_a_ _[D]t[α]_ _[f][ (][t][) =][ lim]_\n_h→0_ _h[α]_\n\n\n(t−a)/h\n(−1)[m]([α]m[)][ f][ (][t][ −] _[mh][)][,][ t][ >][ a][,][a][ >][ 0.]_ (1)\n_m=0_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 4 of 27\n\nThe definition of Caputos fractional derivatives can be written as:\n\n\n_CP_ 1\n_a_ _[D]t[α]_ _[f][ (][t][) =]_ Γ(n − _α)_\n\n\n_t_\n�\n\n_a_\n\n\n_f_ _[n](x)_\n(2)\n(t − _x)[α][−][n][+][1][ dx][,]_\n\n\nfor (n − 1 < α < n) and where Γ(·) is a gamma function.\nThe RL definition is given as:\n\n\n_RL_ 1 _d[n]_\n_a_ _[D]t[α]_ _[f][ (][t][) =]_ Γ(n − _α)_ _dt_\n\n\n_t_\n�\n\n_a_\n\n\n_f (x)_\n(3)\n(t − _x)[α][−][n][+][1][ dx][.]_\n\n\nFor (n − 1 < α < n), while a and t are the bounds of the operation for aDt[α][, the Laplace]\ntransform method is normally used with CP, GL and-RL fractional derivatives under zero\ninitial conditions, as: [40]\n_£{aDt[±][α]_ _f (t); s} = s[±][α]F(s),_ (4)\n\nwhile the analytical expressions are represented by Mittag–Leffler (ML)-type functions [41]\nintroduced by Agarwal and Humbert [42] and are given mathematically as:\n\n\n_Eα,β(z) =_\n_k=0_\n\n\n_z[k]_\n\n(5)\nΓ(β + αk) [,]\n\n\n_α, β, z ∈_ _C, ℜ(α) > 0, ℜ(β) > 0,_\n\nwhere C represents the set of complex numbers and Eα,β is a two-parameter-based ML function.\n\n_2.2. Grunwald–Letnikov-Based Numerical Solver for FDEs_\n\nAnalytical solution to the fractional differential equations (FDEs) generally determined through the Laplace transform method (4), and these expressions are commonly\nrepresented by the ML function (5), while, for the numerical solutions, the most commonly\nused method is based on GL definition.\nTo introduce the numerical solver based on GL [43] for FDEs, let a general from of an\nFDE, along with its initial conditions, is given as follows:\n\n_a[D]t[α]_ _[f][ (][t][) =][ f][ (][y][(][t][)][,][ t][)][,]_\n\n(6)\n_y[(][k][)](0) = y0[(][k][)][,][ k][ =][ 0, 1, 2, . . .][ n][ −]_ [1,]\n\nwhere (n − 1 < α < n), using Equation (1), Ivo Petras [44] provided the final recursive\nexpression of a GL-based solver is as follows:\n\n\n1\n_h[α]_\n\n\n\n[(t−a)/h]\n(−1)[j]([α]k [)][y][(][t][ −] _[jh][)][ ≈]_ _[f][ (][y][(][t][)][,][ t][)][,]_\n_j=0_\n\n\nsimplifying above relation, we have\n\n\n_y(t) +_\n\n\n\n[(t−a)/h]\n(−1)[j]([α]k [)][y][(][t][ −] _[jh][)][ ≈]_ _[h][−][α][ f][ (][y][(][t][)][,][ t][)][.]_\n_j=1_\n\n\nIn case of discrete input grids between interval t ∈ [0, T] = [0, h, 2h, . . ., Mh = T],\nwhere h represents the step size parameter, so [0, T] = [t0 = 0, t1, . . ., tM = T] and any grid\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 5 of 27\n\npoints in the interval are represented as tm = mh for m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., M. Thus, in a discrete\nform, the above equation is written as:\n\n_m_\n_y(tm) +_ (−1)[j][�]αj �y(tm − _jh) = h[−][α]_ _f (y(tm), tm), m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., M._\n_j=1_\n\nIn simple usage, the above term is written as:\n\n_m_\n_y(tm) +_ _c[α]j_ _[y][(][t][m][ −]_ _[jh][) =][ h][−][α][ f][ (][y][(][t][m][)][,][ t][m][)][,][ m][ =][ 0, 1, 2, . . .,][ M][,]_\n_j=1_\n\nwhere c[(]j _[α][)]_ is defined as:\n\n_c[α]j_ [= (][−][1][)][j][�]αj �, (7)\n\nor equivalently with c0[α] [=][ 1,]\n\n\n�\n_c[α]j_ [=] 1 − [1][ +][ α]\n\n_j_\n\n\n�\n_c[α]j−1[,][ j][ =][ 0, 1, . . .]_\n\n\nGL numerical solver in the recursive form is written as:\n\n_k_\n_y(tm) = f (y(tm), tm)h[−][α]_ _−_ _c[α]j_ _[y][(][t][m][−][j][)][,][m][ =][ 0, 1, 2, . . .,][ M][.]_ (8)\n_j=1_\n\nA further elaboration of the Grunwald–Letnikov (GL)-based numerical solver can be\nseen in [45].\n\n**3. Model Formulation of Fractional Order Stuxnet Virus**\n\nThe formulation of a fractional-order Stuxnet virus model (FO-SVM) is presented\nhere. A detailed workflow of the proposed FO-SVM is shown in Figure 1. The entire\nFO-SVM is segmented into five classes: three for computer population, i.e., susceptible S(t),\ninfected I(t), and damaged M(t), and two for removable storage media, i.e., susceptible\nstorage media Us(t) and infected storage media Us(t). However, N(t) represents the\ntotal population, i.e., N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + M(t), and total removable devices U(t), i.e.,\n_U(t) = Us(t) + UI(t). In the rest of the article, the variables with respect to time t, S(t), I(t),_\n_M(t), Us(t), Us(t), N(t), and U(t) are denoted by S, I, M, Us, UI, N, and U, respectively._\nLet A1 and A2 represent the arrival of new computing nodes and removable storage media,\nrespectively, damage rate caused to PLC’s due to virus infection is represented by ρ, β1 is\nthe infectious contact rate of susceptible nodes with infected nodes during the network scan,\nand β2 denotes the contact rate of infectious-removable storage media with susceptible\ncomputer nodes, r1 and r2 represent the natural removal (death) of computer nodes and\nremovable devices from the network, respectively. The number of nodes in Internet\nprotocol version 4 (IPv4) is 2[32], and the probability of finding susceptible nodes in IPv4\nscheme is S/2[32]. Susceptible nodes can be infected at the rate β1SI or at β2SUI �N, while\nthe removable storage media could be infected at a rate of β2Us _I�N. Removable storage_\nmedia is a common source of virus spread in critical industrial air-gapped networks, which\nare isolated from normal networks. The removable storage devices facilitate the flow of\ninformation to and from the networks that make them as an easy prey for intruders [46]. In\nthis study, fractional-order virus model is used to explain the spread of the virus, especially\nStuxnet [47,48] in industrial networks through removable storage media. A proposed\nflow chart diagram of the Stuxnet virus model is shown in Figure 2, and the fundamental\nmathematical equations of the model are given as:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 6 of 27\n\n\n_D[α]S = A1 −_ _[β][1][SI]_ _−_ _r1S,_\n\n2[32][ −] _[β][2]N[SU][I]_\n\n_D[α]_ _I =_ _[β][1][SI]_ _[β][2][SU][I]_ _−_ _ρI −_ _r1_ _I,_\n\n2[32][ +] _N_\n\n_D[α]_ _M = ρI −_ _r1_ _M,_\n\n\n(9)\n\n\n_D[α]Us = A2 −_ _[β][2][U][s]_ _[I]_ _−_ _r2Us,_\n\n_N_\n\n_D[α]UI =_ _[β][2][U][s]_ _[I]_ _−_ _r2UI_\n\n_N_\n\nwhere α ∈ [0, 1] represents the order of the fractional derivative term D[α] = d[α][�]dt[α]. For the\nvalue of α = 1, the above-mentioned FO-SVM system provided in a set of Equation (9) will\nbe converted into a first-order system. From the differential equations mentioned in (9),\nsolving the equations by taking the value of α = 1, we get\n\n_dN_\n\n_dt_ [=][ A][1][ −] _[r][1][N][,]_\n\n(10)\n\n_dU_\n\n_dt_ [=][ A][2][ −] _[r][2][U][.]_\n\n\nThe change in population is given by c1 = A1 − _r1 and c2 = A2 −_ _r2, and the values_\nof these constants may be negative, positive or zero.\n\n**Figure 1.

Model Analysis**\n\nIn this unit, stability analysis of the model is performed through the derivation of\nbasic reproduction number, R0. The endemic and disease-free equilibrium points of the\nsystem are investigated for a local as well as global stability analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 8 of 27\n\n_4.1. Basic Reproduction Number (R0)_\n\nIn epidemiology modeling, a basic reproduction number is defined as the advent of a\nnew infection in an entirely susceptible population due to an infected individual, and is\nusually represented by R0. The value of R0 determines the spread of infection; for R0 > 1\ninfection will spread in the population, and for R0 < 1 infection will soon end [51].\nTo simplify the derivation process, a reduced model (14) has been utilized for further\ninvestigation of R0. The calculation of R0 is based on the value of α = 1.

Simulation and Results**\n\nIn this section, the results of numerical simulations for FO-SVM are presented to\nunderstand the dynamics of virus spread in a critical network infrastructure in the presence of removable storage connectivity, which may compromise the air-gap between the\nnetworks. Numerical experimentation is conducted for the designed FO-SVM as given\nin Equation (9) for a different variation in parameters and initial start-up scenarios, as\ngiven in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The dynamic behavior of the fractional order (FO)\nmodel is studied by varying the non-integer order derivative α. Most FO differential systems lack exact analytical solutions, so the numerical solver based on Grunwald–Letnikov\n(GL) procedure, as described in Section 2 is exploited for an approximate solution to the\nmodel. The security firms, including Symantec, tracked 100,000 infected computers as of\n29 September 2010, in the world. Additionally, available real data are used to validate the\naccuracy and convergence of the model for the Stuxnet virus spread. The virus infects\napproximately 100,000 users from 155 different countries, and 63% were only in Iran. Due\nto this attack, the number of hosts that lost functionality (hardware connected to these\nhosts was damaged due to sudden increase in frequency of up to 1410 Hz, which then\ndecreased to 2 Hz and increased to 1064 Hz in spite of the normal working range of from\n807 Hz to 1210 Hz) due to virus attack. A virus operates the machines connected with the\nhosts at an extreme range of frequencies dictated by Stuxnet and caused physical damage\nto 1500 centrifuge machines (approximately 1200 in Iran only). Approximately 3280 unique\nsamples and variants of the Stuxnet virus were recorded by Symantec and other security\ncorporations [3,6,55].\n\n**Table 1.

The results are determined for nine cases of\ninteger order models (9) by a GL-based computing technique for inputs t ∈ [0, 60] with\nstep size h = 0.001 (time t represents months). Numerical solutions to the model for the\nsame inputs are also calculated by the RK method for each variation. Figure 3 highlights the\ncomparison of model behavior with Stuxnet virus real-world data. FO-SVM model results\nshown in Figure 3 are calculated using the RK method to assume the value of fractional\norder α = 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 15 of 27\n\n**Figure 3.

In this case, removable media are considered to be 60,000, and, after increasing the\nnumber of removable-storage media, infection in the host nodes also increases (96,760 after\n23 months).\nThe number of infected removable-storage devices is 43,740 in 23 months, and in\n24 months, the time number of infected devices increases to 44,920. An increase in the\nnumber of damaged hosts is observed after the increase in infected hosts in 24 months’\ntime. This highlights the role of removable-storage media in spreading the infection in\nisolated critical networks in the absence of any remedial strategy in the model. Stuxnet is\nan advanced, persistent threat (APT) type of malicious code that penetrates in the remote\nsystem in a quasi-autonomous fashion. Then, a 23-month decline in the number of infected\nhosts is observed due to the availability of remedial technique and other controlling\nmechanisms. However, the Stuxnet virus was carried by removable-storage media spreads\nin other·networks.\nIn Figure 4, the solutions to the RK method with GL solver is compared with an error\nanalysis of susceptible hosts S: a and b for cases 2 to 4, c and d for cases 5 to 7, and e and f\nfor cases 8 to 10. Comparisons of results from both the RK numerical solver and GL-based\nmethod (for fractional-order α = 1) are presented for susceptible hosts S in nine cases. The\nerror analysis, based on the absolute difference between the two approaches, is also plotted\nin Figure 4 to assess closeness. The results show a matching of both solutions of up to\nthree decimal places of accuracy. The small errors in these plots show that the results of\nthe GL method are in good agreement with the standard RK numerical technique, which\nestablishes the working accuracy of the GL-based solver. In Figure 5, the solution of the\nRK method with the GL solver is compared in the case of infected hosts I and damaged\nhosts M: a and b for cases 1 to 3, c and d for cases 4 to 6, and e and f for cases 7 to 9.\nFigure 4 compares solutions for the RK method with GL solver in case of susceptible and\ninfected removable-storage media: a and b for cases 1 to 3, c and d for cases 4 to 6, and\ne and f for cases 7 to 9.

Considering Figures 4–6, and the different cases simulated, we have the following comments.\nThe effect of changing the infectious contact rate β1 from 36.6% to 60% is highlighted\nin case 1 of Equation (9) (value of β1 in Figure 3 is 36.6%). It is observed that the number of\ninfected hosts in 24 months is 96,760, as shown in Figure 5a (in Figure 3, the number of\ninfected hosts in 24 months is 96,270), which shows a slight increase in infected hosts due\nto β1. In case 2, the number of initially infected hosts is assumed to be 30,000. Increasing\nthe contact rate of infectious removable media (in case 2) reduces the number of susceptible\nhosts rapidly as compared to case 1 (Figure 4a). However, the number of infected hosts is\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 17 of 27\n\nreduced (Figure 5a) due to an increase in the natural removal rate of hosts and removable\nstorage r1 and r2 (hosts are removed to save them from the Stuxnet attack). In case 3, we\nreduce the damage rate and the quantity of initial susceptible removable-storage media,\nwhich reduces infected removable-storage media number (Figure 6b) and increases the\ninfected hosts, as in Figure 5a). A decrease in damaged hosts is observed in case 3, despite\nthe increase in the number of infected hosts.\n\n**Figure 5.

The results show that increasing the arrival rate of new hosts and arrival\nrate of new removable-storage media will not spread the infection faster without the presence of a sufficient number of infected removable-storage devices, as shown in Figure 5c.\nIn cases 5 and 6, we further increase the values of the arrival rate of new nodes as well as\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 18 of 27\n\nremovable-storage devices for an in-depth behavior analysis of the model. Both cases have\nsimilar parameters, except case 6, which represents a higher damage rate (especially for\nzero-day vulnerability or for a new virus attack) that increases the number of damaged\ncomputers and reduces the number of infected computers (removed due to high damage\nrate) in the networks as compared to case 5. Case 5 shows the high number of infected\nnodes (Figure 5c) because the Stuxnet virus only destroys the machines with specific\nhardware (Siemens specific PLCs) and remains dormant till it finds the target. In case 6\n(Figure 5c,d), the number of infected hosts decreases; however an increase in the number\nof damaged hosts is observed due to an increase in damage rate ρ.\n\n**Figure 6.

In case 7, the value of β1 = 0.745, as compared to 0.4 in case 6, and the value\nof β2 = 0.4, as compared to 0.745 in case 6. These swaps are carried out to observe the\ndevastation effect of infected removable storage media as compared to the effect of infected\nnodes in the model, because infected removable media have a greater devastation effect.\nSimulation results show that the number of damaged nodes in case 6 is 35,000, whereas, in\ncase 7, it is 5000, due to a decrease in the value of β2 infectious contact rate of removable\nstorage media (Figure 5e).\nHowever, by increasing β2 value (removable-storage media’s infectious contact rate\nwith susceptible computers) and A2 (the arrival of removable-storage media) for case 8\nwill also increase the infection in the network. This outlines the importance of removablestorage media in spreading the virus in air-gapped networks (Figure 5e). In case 9, the\ncontact rate of susceptible computer nodes with infectious removable-storage media β2\nis reduced, which results in a reduction in damaged nodes (Figure 5f) and infected nodes\n(Figure 5e), and an increase in the number of susceptible storage devices (Figure 6e). Case 9\nfurther elaborates the scenario presented in case 8.\nThe derivative order α = 1 is presented in Figures 4–6. The effect of change in fractional\norder α is presented in Figures 7–11. A detailed analysis of the FO-SVM model is conducted\nby changing the fractional order α in the system (9), such that one may observe fastchanging as well as super-slow growth in the model dynamics. The fractional order\nsolution of the FO-SVM model for different values of the fractional order α is solved using\na GL-based solver. The solutions are determined for nine cases of FO-SVM by a GL-based\nnumerical procedure for different fractional orders, i.e., α = [0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1],\nfor the inputs t ∈ [0, 60] with step size h = 0.001. Results for the dynamics of the FO-SVM\nmodel in terms of susceptible S, infected I, and damaged M computers are plotted in\nFigures 7–9 for cases 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9, respectively. Susceptible removable-storage media\n_Us and infected-removable-storage media UI are plotted in Figures 10 and 11 for cases 1–4_\nand 5–9, respectively, for different values of the fractional order α.\nFigure 7 shows a simulation of fractional order, i.e., α = [0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1]\nfor the FO-SVM model for different values of fractional order α for case 1–3 of susceptible\n_S, infected I and damaged hosts M. In Figure 7, the number of susceptible, infected and_\ndamaged hosts is plotted versus time for cases 1–3 for different values of α = [0.5, 0.75,\n0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1]. A consistent pattern is observed in the evolution of curves with the\nvalue of α. The value of infected hosts in case 1 with α = 1 is 96,760, and for α = 0.95, the\nvalue of infected hosts is approximately 56,000 for t = 24 months, as shown in Figure 7b. In\nFigure 7c, the number of damaged hosts (hosts that were connected with specific models\nof Siemens PLCs) for the value of α = 0.95 are 1000 for t = 30. Adjusting the value of α to\n0.98 may adjust the number of damaged hosts to 1500, which matches the real published\ndata of the Stuxnet virus. This illustrates the controllability feature of α for tuning the\nmodel. Despite the rapid spreadability of the Stuxnet virus, it causes little or no harm to\nthe systems that do not have specific hardware.\nFigure 8 shows the simulation of fractional order dynamics of the FO-SVM model for\ndifferent values of fractional order α for cases 4–6, and Figure 9 depicts the simulation of\nfractional-order dynamics of the FO-SVM model for case 7–9. Figures 8 and 9 highlight\nthe results for variation in fractional order α, which shows that variation in α gives smooth\nvariations in the dynamics of the model. For α = 0.1, we have the slowest evolution.\nSimulation of fractional order dynamics of FO-SVM model for different values of fractional\norder α for case 1–5 of susceptible removable-storage media Us and infected-removablestorage media UI are illustrated in Figure 10. Figure 11 shows the simulation of fractional\norder dynamics of FO-SVM model for different values of fractional order α, for cases\n5–9 of susceptible removable-storage media Us, and infected-removable-storage media\n_UI. In Figures 10 and 11, the number of susceptible storage media and infected storage_\nmedia is plotted for case 1–9 against the time variation for different values of fractional\norder α = [0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1]. It is observed that tuning the values of α tunes\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 20 of 27\n\nthe dynamics of transients, as shown in Figure 10a. The value of susceptible storage media\nfor t = 1 and α = 0.95 is 35,000, which is effectively reduced to 10,000 by a slight change in\nfractional order α from 0.95 to 0.8. In contrast, a slow change is observed in the dynamics\nof the FO-SVM model for α = 0.1. Increasing the fractional order α increases the rate of\nchange of the variables. Fractional-order virus models provide extra tunable parameters in\nthe form of α, which highlight more minute changes in the model dynamics.\n\n**Figure 7.

Conclusions**\n\nA detailed analysis of the novel design of the fractional order Stuxnet virus model\nis presented, with richer dynamics for the transmission of virus spread in an isolated\ncritical network through removable-storage media. The fractional-order Stuxnet-virusbased mathematical models are found to be at least as stable as integer-order models. The\nfractional order value α of the proposed fractional Stuxnet virus model more effectively\ncontrols the solution reachability towards a steady state point. Additionally, the fractional\norder system of the Stuxnet virus model can tackle the different responses, including\nsuper-slow evolutions and very fast transients; these responses are found to have long\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mathematics 2021, 9, 2160_ 25 of 27\n\nmemory characteristics in the system. Taking the value of α = 0.98, one may adjust the\nnumber of damaged hosts to 1500 in case 1, which matches the damage caused by the\nStuxnet virus. The transformation process of the classical model into a fractional model\nis very sensitive to the value of the order of differentiation α, and can be converted to a\nsimple SIR model if we choose the values of the infectious contact rate β2 = 0. A theoretical\nanalysis of the model capturing the Stuxnet virus-spreading characteristics is determined\nby a mathematical derivation of the basic reproduction number R0 for the value of α = 1.\nEquilibrium points of the model are globally and asymptomatically stable for R0 < 1 and\n_R0 > 1, respectively._\nIn the future, one may exploit the strength of stochastic numerical solvers [56–61]\nbased on fractional evolutionary and swarming techniques [62–67] for a detailed analysis\nof the designed fractional-order Stuxnet virus model. Additionally, new definitions of\nthe fractional operator, such as Yang–Machado [35] and Yang–Abdel–Aty–Cattani [36]\nfractional derivatives looks promising for the development of new computing solvers for\nthe numerical solution of the fractional-order Stuxnet virus model and other fractionalorder systems with better theoretical justifications, a better applicability domain, proof of\nthe accuracy, convergence, stability, and robustness.\n\n**Author Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.M. and M.A.Z.R.; methodology, Z.M. and M.A.Z.R.;**\nsoftware, Z.M.; validation, M.A.Z.R.; formal analysis, N.I.C. and M.A.Z.R.; investigation, Z.M.;\nwriting—original draft preparation, Z.M.; writing—review and editing, N.I.C. and M.A.Z.R.; visualization, N.I.C. and M.A.Z.R.; project administration, K.M.C. and A.H.M.; funding acquisition, K.M.C.\nand A.H.M.
