    "plain_text": "# Iranian Cyber Actors Responsible for Website Threatening U.S. Election Officials\n\n**[fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/iranian-cyber-actors-responsible-for-website-threatening-us-election-officials](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/iranian-cyber-actors-responsible-for-website-threatening-us-election-officials)**\n\nThe FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) possess highly\ncredible information indicating Iranian cyber actors almost certainly were responsible for the\ncreation of a website called Enemies of the People, which contained death threats aimed at\nU.S. election officials in mid-December 2020.\n\nThe FBI has identified multiple domains, to include the main site, enemiesofthepeople.org,\nthat contained personal information and photographs for a number of U.S. officials and\nindividuals from private sector entities involved with the 2020 election. The FBI has\nconfirmed the main site is currently inactive.\n\nIn addition, threatening emails were sent to the officials from the following email addresses:\n\nenemiesofthepeople@tutanota.com\n6e.nemiesOfThepeople.e9@protonmail.com\n3e.nemiesOfThePeopl.e3@protonmail.com\n3e.nemiesOfThePeopl.e3@gmail.com\n\nThe post-election creation of the Enemies of the People website demonstrates an ongoing\nIranian intent to create divisions and mistrust in the United States and undermine public\nconfidence in the U.S. electoral process. As referenced in Joint Cybersecurity\n[Advisories AA20-296B and](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2020/201022-2.pdf) [AA20-304A, and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a) [FBI FLASH Message ME-000138-TT, the FBI](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2020/201030.pdf)\nand CISA have previously warned that Iranian cyber actors were likely intent on influencing\nand interfering with the 2020 U.S. elections.\n\nThe FBI and CISA urge the public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they\nconsume and to seek out reliable and verified information.\n\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious\ncyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. The FBI\nalso investigates federal election crimes and violent crimes, including threats of violence\nagainst U.S. election or other public officials. CISA is responsible for protecting the nation’s\ncritical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.\n\nThe FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security, integrity, and\nresiliency of the U.S. electoral process. The FBI will continue to aggressively investigate\ncredible threats made against U.S. election officials through any media, including websites\nand telephonic or electronic communications.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Victim Reporting and Additional Information**\n\nThe FBI encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal\nactivity to their [local field office or online at](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) [tips.fbi.gov.](https://tips.fbi.gov/)\n\n\n-----",
