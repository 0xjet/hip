This blog outlines technical\ndetails of this new Hworm version and documents an attack campaign making use of the backdoor. Of the samples used in\nthis attack, the first we observed were June 2016, while as­of publication we were still seeing attacks as recently as mid­\nOctober, suggesting that this is likely an active, ongoing campaign.\n\n### Deconstructing the Threats:\n\nThe investigation into this malware began while searching through WildFire\n(https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure­the­network/subscriptions/wildfire) execution reports within AutoFocus\n(https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure­the­network/subscriptions/autofocus). Looking for newly submitted\nmalicious samples with no family label, a unique mutex surfaced, “RCSTEST”. Pivoting around the creation of this mutex, as\nwell as other dynamic behaviors, a group of samples slowly began to emerge. The group of samples has common delivery\nmechanisms, lures and decoy file themes, payloads (Hworm), as well as control infrastructure.\n\nSamples from this attack came in the form of SFX files. The original filenames of these delivery files are related to political\nfigures and groups in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. They include:\n\nMohamed Dahlan Abu Dhabi Meeting.exe\nﻓﺿﻳﺣﺔ ﻣﻥ ﺍﻟﻌﻳﺎﺭ ﺍﻟﺛﻘﻳﻝ ﺍﺭﺩﻭﻏﺎﻥ ﻳﺷﺭﺏ ﺍﻟﺧﻣﺭ.exe\nﺻﺭﺍﻋﺎﺕ ﺩﺍﺧﻠﻳﺔ ﻓﻲ ﺻﻔﻭﻑ ﺍﻻﺧﻭﺍﻥ ﺍﻟﻣﺳﻠﻣﻳﻥ.exe\nﻋﻣﻠﻳﺔ ﺍﻏﺗﻳﺎﻝ ﺍﻟﺩﻛﺗﻭﺭ ﻣﺣﻣﺩ ﻛﻣﺎﻝ.scr\nﺍﻟﻣﻠﻙ ﻋﺑﺩ ﷲ ﻳﻬﺩﺩ ﺩﻭﻝ ﺍﻟﺧﻠﻳﺞ ﻭﻳﺗﻭﻋﺩ ﺩﺣﻼﻥ.exe\nﺑﺎﻟﻔﻳﺩﻳﻭ ﺍﻣﻳﺭ ﺳﻌﻭﺩﻱ ﻳﻬﻳﻥ ﻣﻭﺍﻁﻧﻳﻥ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻬﻭﺍء.scr\n\nWhen executed each SFX file opens a decoy document, video, or URL, and eventually executes an Hworm payload in the\nbackground. The decoy files are similarly themed when compared to the above delivery file names. Figure 1 shows a\nscreenshot from a video one sample opens as a decoy.\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_1.png)\n\n_Figure 1 Decoy video_\n\nAnother sample displays a YouTube video by dropping a .url shortcut and opening it using the system’s default web browser.\nFigure 2 illustrates the .url file contents:\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_2.png)\n\n_Figure 2 .url file_\n\nWhen the .url file is opened, the above YouTube video is displayed as a decoy. It is unclear at this time if the uploader of this\nvideo has any relation to this particular attack\n\nBesides decoys, the samples also execute Hworm payloads, all of which are packed. Each Hworm payload created a unique\nmutex (while some SFX files delivered the same Hworm payload). All of the samples beaconed to one of three network\nlocations as shown in Figure 3:\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_3.png)\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_4.png)\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­\n\ncontent/uploads/2016/10/Houdini 5 png)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile prior reports on Hworm have been published (https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat­research/2013/09/now­you­see­me­\nh­worm­by­houdini.html), we were unable to identify any report detailing this particular version of Hworm. Some previous\nversions would embed AutoIT scripts in resource sections of PE files while others would execute obfuscated VBS scripts.\nSome previous versions of the Hworm implant would embed data in the headers of HTTP requests or POST bodies as a\nmethod of command and control. Beacons of that HTTP protocol example are easily recognized by the use of ‘<|>’ as a\ndelimiter and the URI of the request. This new version of Hworm uses a mixed binary and ASCII protocol over TCP. Figure 4\nis a packet capture of the protocol used by Hworm samples in this attack. It includes the string “new_houdini”, the mutex\nused by the implant, the name of the user, the operating system version, the version of the implant, and the name of the\nforeground process:\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_6.png)\n\n_Figure 4 Packet capture of new communications protocol_\n\nDuring the investigation of this malware a forum post on dev­point[.]com, an Arabic speaking technology and security forum,\nby a user with the handle “Houdini”, outlined plans for a rewrite of a backdoor in Delphi. This post occurred around July\n2015.\n\nAround October 2015, a password protected beta version of the builder used to create Delphi Hworm implants\n(a4c71f862757e3535b305a14ff9f268e6cf196b2e54b426f25fa65bf658a9242) was uploaded to VirusTotal. Unfortunately, the\nbuilder used to create the samples outlined in the above attack was not located. Unit 42 believes the samples used in the\nabove attack are a version which were released after the beta.\n\n### Analyzing the Hworm Malcode:\n\nUpon configuring and building a server, the builder prompts the user to save a VBS file and modifies a stub file to create the\nimplant. The VBS file is used to load and inject the implant. It appears that the operators behind the above attack either\nchose to not use the VBS loader or the newer versions of the builder no longer produce a VBS script.\n\n#### The VBS Loader:\n\nThe script contains three files encoded in base64. The first file is DynamicWrapperX (http://www.script­\ncoding.com/dynwrapx_eng.html) (DCOM_DATA), the second file is the RunPE shellcode (LOADER_DATA), and the third file\nis the file which gets injected into host process (FILE_DATA). DynamicWrapperX provides access to all Windows APIs from\na Visual Basic Script providing a wide range of functionality to this VBS script.\n\nThe configuration of the script is at the beginning of the file (Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­\n\ncontent/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_7.png)\n\n_Figure 5 Script configuration section_\n\nIn the above example, the script will use the registry as a startup method, it will drop itself into the system’s %appdata%\ndirectory using the filename myhworm.exe and it will inject itself into svchost.exe.\n\nAs the script executes it first adds one of three startup methods which will execute the script on Windows startup:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\nRegistry Run in HKCU\n\nPath: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nEntryData Wscript.exe //b //e:vbscript <filepath>\n/b Specifies batch mode, which does not display alerts, scripting errors, or\ninput prompts.\n/e Specifies the engine that is used to run the script.\nDefine startup directory\nStartup task (not implemented yet)\n\n\nFollowing the installation of persistence, the script checks if the current environment is WOW64. If so, the script will execute:\n\n\n1 %windir%\\syswow64\\wscript.exe /b /e:vbscript <filepath>\n\n\nThe script then drops DynamicWrapperX in the configured installation directory with file extension “.bin”.\n\n\n1 <installdir>\\<filename>.bin\n\n\nIt will then register DynamicWrapperX:\n\n\n1 regsvr32.exe /I /S <filename_dynamic_wrapperx>\n\n\nNext, the script will load the registered object:\n\n\n1 “set DCOM = CreateObject(\"DYNAMICWRAPPERX\")”\n\n\nIt registers /load VirtualAlloc and CallWindowProcW as functions which can be directly called in the script using\n“dcom.VirtualAlloc <arguments>”.\n\nUsing VirtualAlloc it will allocate new memory and copy RunPE shellcode (LOADER_DATA, loader.hex) and the to­be­\ninjected binary (FILE_DATA) into memory.\n\nUsing CallWindowProcW the script will jump to the RunPE shellcode and the shellcode will inject the file (FILE_DATA) into\nthe host process. The host process is by default svchost.exe but for .NET files injection can occur into the file:\n\n\n1 %windir%\\Microsoft.Net\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\msbuild.exe\n\n\nFigure 6 shows the main routine of the script:\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_8.png)\n\n_Figure 6 Main routine_\n\nFigure 7shows a hex dump of LOADER_DATA (RunPE shellcode):\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_9.png)\n\n_Figure 7 Hex dump of LOADER_DATA_\n\n\n-----\n\nin this beta builder can be seen in Figure 1. Top is the VBS file from the HTTP version of Hworm, compared with the VBS\nscript produced by the beta builder of Hworm (below).\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_10.png)\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_11.png)\n\n_Figure 8 Similarities between HWorm versions_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main server which the builder produces is developed in Delphi and is not encrypted. Unit 42 has seen variants packed\nwith VMProtect and ASPack. In some versions of the Delphi Hworm implants discovered (unpacked beta versions) the\nsettings are stored in the resource section RCData\\“CONFIG” and are in clear text (Figure 9).\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_12.png)\n\n_Figure 9 Settings_\n\nSome versions also have an unfinished PE spreader in the resource section\n(a65fd78951590833904bd27783b1032b7cc575220a12c6d6f44cb09061999af3). The spreader will terminate all running\nprocesses named “sm?rtp.exe” and execute a VBS file using wscript.exe:\n\n\n1 “wscript.exe /e:vbscript <current directory>\\$RECYCLE.BIN\\u vbs name here”.\n\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_13.png)\n\n_Figure 10 Spreader_\n\nThe server exports some unused functions (they all just have RET instruction). We have seen “wrom.exe” and “server.exe”\nused as the name in the export table (Figure 11).\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp­content/uploads/2016/10/Houdini_14.png)\n\n_Figure 11 Export table_\n\nThe author used the open source library Indy Components for network communication. They also used BTMemoryModule to\nload DLLs from memory (without saving it on the disc).\n\nThe Hworm implants use a connect­back communication. This means the server (implant) connects back to the client\n(remotely controlling system). It also has some modules implemented in the server and each module uses its own socket for\ncommunication (on the same port defined in the configuration).\n\nThe following modules provide features of this malware:\n\n**Screenshot: Provides the ability to capture screenshots in JPEG/BMP formats**\n**Keylogger: Provides the ability to log key strokes**\n**Internet IO: Provides the ability to download and execute files from the internet. It also provides the ability to load the**\nexecutables via the RunPE technique\n**File Manager: Provides the ability to list files and directories, delete, rename, and execute files, and upload or**\ndownload files via TCP or HTTP\n**Password: Provides the ability to steal passwords from Firefox, Opera, and Chrome browsers**\n**Misc: Provides the ability to list processes or modules and kill running processes**\n**USB Notifier: Provides the ability to notify the controller when a USB device is attached**\n**Houdini Client: Provides the main client, which contains the server’s configuration.**\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n\nThe similarities in coding styles and features of the server, as well as languages and handles used by the author of the\nmalware, lead us to believe the beta builder is a version of Hworm which was created somewhere between the HTTP\nversion and the version used in the above outlined attack.\n\nAs this RAT can be found online in semi­public locations it is possible the malware is used by both surgical threat actors as\nwell as within casual compromises. The above attack is only one such campaign Unit 42 has discovered using the Delphi\nversions of Hworm.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers can use AutoFocus to find all versions of Hworm samples using the “Hworm” tag.\n\n### Indicators:\n\n**Delphi Hworm Beta Builder**\na4c71f862757e3535b305a14ff9f268e6cf196b2e54b426f25fa65bf658a9242\n\n**Delivery Files**\n70c55fef53fd4bdeb135ed68a7eead45e8d4ba7d17e0fd907e9770b2793b60ed\n9af85e46344dadf1467c71d66865c7af98a23151025e7d8993bd9afc5150ad7d\n773716bc2d313e17326471289a0b552f90086a2687fa958ef8cdb611cbc9a8c9\ne0db0982c437c40ceb67970e0a776e9448f428e919200b5f7a0566c58680070c\n1f45e5eca8f8882481b13fd4a67ffa88a1aa4d6e875a9c2e1fbf0b80e92d9588\n\n\n-----\n\n106934ff7f6f93a371a4561fff23d69e6783512c38126fbd427ed4a886ca6e65\nba739f3f415efe005fbed6fcfcb1e6d3b3ae64e9a8d2b0566ab913f73530887c\n0672e47513aefcbc3f7a9bd50849acf507a5454bc8c36580304105479c58772a\n\n**Payloads**\n386057a265619c43ef245857b66241a66822061ce9bd047556c4f3f1d262ef36\n44b52baf2ecef2f928a13b17ba3a5552c32ca4a640e6421b8bc35ef5a113801b\n8428857b0c7dfe43cf2182dd585dfdfd845697a11c31e91d909dc400222b4f78\nd69e0456ddb11b979bf303b8bb9f87322bd2a9542dd9d9f716100c40bd6decd1\nbd5d64234e1ac87955f1d86ee1af34bd8fd11e8edf3a449181234bb62816acab\n774501f3c88ebdd409ec318d08af2350ec37fdbc11f32681f855e215e75440d7\nc66b9e8aaa2ac4ce5b53b45ebb661ba7946f5b82e75865ae9e98510caff911a7\n\n**Decoy files**\n7916ca6ae6fdbfb45448f6dcff374d072d988d11aa15247a88167bf973ee2c0d\n947d264a413f3353c43dafa0fd918bec75e8752a953b50843bc8134286d6f93f\n9ddf2f2e6ac7da61c04c03f3f27af12cb85e096746f120235724a4ed93fac5aa\n3d287cce7fe1caa5c033a4e6b94680c90a25cb3866837266130ba0fd8fab562c\n444b82caf3c17ea74034c984aeca0f5b2e6547af88a0fb15953f2d5b80e3b448\n3d3db84b6ad760540f638713e3f6a8daf8a226bd045351bcc72c6d22a7df8b3a\nfffda1e2d794a5645f973900083a88ef38c3d20a89c5e59ca21412806db28197\n\n**Command and Control Network Locations**\nstart.loginto[.]me\nsamah.sytes[.]net\n52.42.161[.]75\n78.47.96[.]17\n136.243.104[.]200\n\n#### Got something to say?\n\n\nLeave a comment...\n\n\nNotify me of followup comments via e­mail\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail (required)\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\n-----\n\nCOMPANY\n\n[Company (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\n[Careers (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)\n\n[Sitemap (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)\n\n[Report a Vulnerability (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security­disclosure)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security-disclosure)\n\nLEGAL NOTICES\n\n[Privacy Policy (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal­notices/privacy)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)\n\n[Terms of Use (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal­notices/terms­of­use)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\nACCOUNT\n\n[Manage Subscription (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)\n\n##  (https://www.linkedin.com/company/palo­alto­networks)   (https://www.facebook.com/PaloAltoNetworks/)   (https://twitter.com/PaloAltoNtwks)\n\n© 2016 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
