Although the\nmedal was presented by Lavrov, it was Russian President Vladimir Putin himself who\ndecided to award it. Not coincidentally, the medal, which is in the form of a wreath of olive\nbranches encircling a globe, includes the inscription “Peace and Friendship” in Cyrillic on the\nback, is the highest Russian state decoration that can be awarded to a foreigner.\n\n“I am proud that, despite the extremely unfavourable global and regional developments\nof recent years, while respecting our obligations to our alliances, we have also\nbeen able to maintain our cooperation with Moscow based on mutual trust and in line\nwith our national interests”, the Hungarian Foreign Minister boasted on his Facebook\npage.\n\n\n-----\n\nPéter Szijjártó knew long ago that Russia s intelligence services had attacked and hacked\ninto the IT systems of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFA), which he headed. By\nthe second half of 2021, it had become clear that the Russians had completely compromised\nthe foreign ministry’s computer network and internal correspondence. Furthermore, they had\nalso hacked into the encrypted network used to transmit “restricted” and “confidential” state\nsecrets and diplomatic information, which can only be used under strict security measures.\n\nAccording to an internal document we obtained, the foreign ministry was still under targeted\nattacks in January 2022. Details of the Russian hacking of the foreign ministry’s\ncommunications channels were shared with us by former state officials, among others, who\nlearned of the incident from officials with direct knowledge of it.\n\nAccording to former intelligence officials, the cyber attack trail suggests that hacker groups\nworking for Russian intelligence are clearly behind the operations against Hungary’s foreign\nministry. These hackers work for the Federal Security Service, FSB, which was previously\nheaded by Putin, and for the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU. According to our\nsources, these hacker groups have been well known to the Hungarian state authorities for a\nlong time, as they have been continuously attacking Hungarian government networks for at\nleast a decade. Russian attacks against Hungary are most often related to hacks against\nother NATO countries, and members of the Western alliance regularly cooperate and share\ninformation to identify these offensive cyber operations.\n\nHungarian diplomacy has become practically an open book for Moscow through the hacking\nof the ministry’s networks. Russians are able to know in advance what the Hungarian foreign\nministry is thinking and planning, and this is happening at a very sensitive time. Russian\ninfiltration remained active before and partly after the invasion of Ukraine, during the current\nEU and NATO crisis summits. Meanwhile, there is no sign that the Hungarian government\nhas publicly protested to Russia about the cyberespionage.\n\nDirekt36 uncovered the Russian intelligence operations against the Hungarian foreign\nministry and the inadequacy of Hungarian counter-intelligence measures, going back at least\na decade, with the help of foreign ministry documents and more than thirty background\ninterviews. For example, we spoke to former Hungarian intelligence and security officers who\nhad worked on Russian intelligence-related fields and had concrete information on many of\nthe cases described in this article. Sources familiar with the internal affairs of the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs and Trade shared information about the ministry’s handling of the\ncyberattack.\n\nWe sent detailed questions about all the main findings in the article to the foreign ministry,\nthe Ministry of Interior – which is primarily responsible for cyber defence and counterintelligence – and the Prime Minister’s Office last week. We have not yet received any\nresponse. (After the publication of this article, the foreign ministry replied to other media\n_outlets saying “we do not pay attention to campaign lies”.)_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Foreign ministry staff were not told that their computers were already infected\n\nSince autumn 2021, unusual messages have appeared on internal mailing lists at the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While ministry staff had previously received such\ncybersecurity-related emails only occasionally, from last year they kept frequently coming.\n\nAccording to a foreign ministry diplomatic cable obtained by Direkt36, it was announced on\nNovember 11, 2021 that “the Ministry’s Cyber Security Project is being developed to\nstrengthen the MFA’s IT and cyber security”. As a first step, an email address has been\ncreated to which foreign ministry officials are invited to “report cybersecurity-related issues\n(e.g. phishing email, DDOS attack, ransomware virus attack, password leak, data leak)”.\n\nSource: Direkt36\nBefore Christmas, the ministry had already issued instructions to Hungarian diplomatic\nmissions restricting the use of mobile phones for official work. Then, on January 7, 2022, the\ncyber security project officer scolded staff for not complying with the new policy. “Technical\ninvestigations carried out to increase the information and cyber security of the MFA have\nshown that the MFA’s official correspondence is not carried out exclusively using the types of\ndevices and programs authorised for this purpose,” another internal cable obtained by\nDirekt36 stated.\n\nThe cables have led to growing suspicions in the MFA that the problem could be quite\nserious. One source familiar with the ministry’s internal affairs thought at the time that the\nChinese might have hacked the foreign ministry’s system. One of the ministry’s cables hints\nat this: “Measurable amounts of devices are in use that have been proven to communicate\npersonal data to China in a covert manner. These include (but are not limited to) Huawei\n(ZTE), Honor, Xiaomi, Wiko, OnePlus, among others”.\n\n\n-----\n\nForrás: Direkt36\nThis cable is not only remarkable because it highlights serious vulnerabilities of government\ncommunication. The letter is also interesting because it shows that the Orbán government is\naware of the security risk posed by Chinese devices, while in public they denied it for years.\nMoreover, the Orbán government has been one of the biggest supporters of the use of\nChinese telecommunications devices in Europe. Szijjártó, for example, has repeatedly stood\nup for Huawei and claimed that the Chinese company’s devices do not pose any risk.\n\nOther vulnerabilities are also reported in the MFA cables. According to one, an internal\ninvestigation has also revealed that many bureaucrats prefer to use an American email client\ncalled BlueMail, which is also dangerous. According to the cyber defence project officer,\nBlueMail “openly stores entered passwords; has many programming flaws that can be easily\nexploited in an attack; constantly sends mobile device data to three different servers”.\n\nJust a week after the letter warning against Chinese devices, on 14 January 2022, the MFA\nissued a broad warning about a different kind of threat, saying that a phishing email attack\n“appeared in several foreign embassies this week”. The phishing email, written in English,\nclaimed that the recipient’s password for their @mfa.gov.hu ministry email account was\nabout to expire and needed to be changed. “Passwords entered will be automatically\nassigned to the attacker’s email address, which will be immediately forwarded to\nunauthorised users who can easily gain access to the full contents of the inbox,” the warning\nsaid.\n\nHowever, the MFA’s Cyber Security Project was not launched solely to raise awareness, and\ninternal investigations have not only revealed potential risks. By the second half of 2021, it\nhad also become apparent to the ministry’s leadership that Russian hackers were behind the\nactive, serious infection of ministry systems, several former Hungarian state officials told\nDirekt36. They had details from colleagues with direct knowledge of the Russian operation or\nwho had previously worked in fields related to Russian intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the hackers known methods from previous cyber attacks in Hungary and abroad,\nthe infection technique and other clues they left behind (IP addresses, origin and destination\nof network traffic, targets), it was clear from the beginning to the agencies involved in\ninvestigating the attack on the Hungarian MFA that Russian intelligence services had\nattacked the ministry. For example, some of the leads were specifically linked to, or bore an\nuncanny resemblance to known attacks against other NATO countries which had already\nbeen identified as being carried out by Russia.\n\nThe infection entered the Hungarian MFA partly through phishing attacks and email\nattachments containing malwares and viruses, and then spread throughout the internal\nnetwork – computers of the ministry at Bem Square in Budapest and in more than 150 sites\nof more than 90 Hungarian foreign missions were all affected. According to the former\nofficials, the infection had been lurking for years and was discovered so late that it is\nimpossible to say in retrospect at what points and in how many different ways the Russians\nhad hacked into the MFA’s systems.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the internal affairs of the ministry, agencies responsible for\nthe security of the networks informed Péter Szijjártó and the top leadership of the MFA at\nleast six months ago. Since then, Minister of Interior Sándor Pintér and his ministry’s heads\nhave also been filled in on the details by the security agencies they oversee. At the MFA,\ncybersecurity is the responsibility of the ministry’s Security, Information Technology and\nTelecommunications Department (BITÁF) and its civil intelligence agency, the Information\nOffice (IH). At the level of overall government, the agency in charge is the Special Service for\nNational Security (SSNS). However, according to several former intelligence officers, the\nNational Infocommunication Service Provider Ltd. (NISZ), as well as the counterintelligence\nagency, the Constitution Protection Office (AH) are also involved in mitigating the incident.\n\nSzijjártó told the Hungarian parliament’s committee on national security in early December\nlast year that the IH – which is also responsible for the national security protection of\nHungarian embassies abroad – had drawn up a new concept to strengthen protection, and\n“work on this has started this year as planned”. He added that in the IH, too, “we have taken\nmore measures to strengthen internal security.” However, he did not say that this had\nanything to do with cyber attacks.\n\n[At the same committee meeting, Pintér also had a note of concern. After saying that the](https://www.parlament.hu/documents/static/biz41/bizjkv41/NBB/2112092.pdf)\nHungarian cyber defence is “entirely” the responsibility of the SSNS, which he oversees, he\nadded that “regardless of this, each specific agency must implement its cyber defence tasks,\nbecause it is not enough to have a central vision if our individual staff members do not pay\nenough attention to computer and internet use”.\n\nEven though Szijjártó and his deputies have been aware of the risks for some time, they\nhave not disclosed it to the foreign service apparatus beyond general warnings in diplomatic\ncables mentioning that their everyday working devices and foreign ministry networks have\nbeen compromised for some time. In addition, the process of expelling the Russian\n\n\n-----\n\nintelligence services from the Hungarian foreign ministry networks has been extremely slow\nand has not been completed to date. According to former security officials, this is due to,\namong other things, fragmented and slow decision-making and a lack of expertise.\n\nYet Russian cyber attacks against the Hungarian government and the Hungarian MFA have\nbeen occuring for at least a decade.\n\n## Russians kept logging in and out of the system\n\nRussian hackers saw everything on the computer of the high-ranking Hungarian government\nofficial as if they were physically sitting in his chair in front of his monitor in Hungary. In the\nautumn of 2012, a modified version of a remote access application called TeamViewer was\ninstalled on his computer without his knowledge, allowing them to see virtually everything –\ndocuments, passwords, system settings, network connections.\n\nHe was not the only Hungarian government victim of the Russian cyber attack almost a\ndecade ago, and the targets were not only Hungarians. A few months later, in February\n2013, the embassy of a NATO and EU member state in Moscow was also a victim of the\nattack, later dubbed TeamSpy, as were research and educational institutions in France and\nBelgium, among others. The details of the attack were later published in an anonymised way\n[in an expert analysis.](https://www.crysys.hu/publications/files/teamspy.pdf)\n\nSource: Crysys Lab\n\n\n-----\n\nThe large-scale Russian TeamSpy attack was discovered not by the counterintelligence of\nWestern countries, but by experts at the cyber defence center of the Hungarian National\nSecurity Authority (NBF), according to a cyber security expert familiar with the incident. The\nHungarian center, called the Cyber Defence Management Authority (CMDA), set up in 2011,\ngathered expertise and cyber defence capabilities over ministries and state agencies, and\nwere so successful that one of their Hungarian experts was elected to head NATO’s cyber\ndefence task force.\n\nAccording to a cyber security expert familiar with the incident, the Hungarians responded to\nthe TeamSpy attack with an aggressive counterattack. They hacked into the Russian attack\ninfrastructure, identified Russian hackers operating from Russian and Ukrainian Internet\ncafes, among others, and obtained the target list of TeamSpy attacks. In a joint operation\nwith NATO partners, by accessing the victims’ computers around the world, they\nsimultaneously shut down infected devices, cutting off Russian hackers from a wealth of\ninformation. Such an operation requires serious organisation and expertise, which, according\nto several Direkt36 sources familiar with the case and involved in cybersecurity, shows how\nadvanced Hungarian cyber defence was at the time.\n\nIt was in the early 2010s that Russian intelligence services – mainly the Russian Federal\nSecurity Service (FSB) and the Russian military intelligence (GRU) – really started to get into\nhacking. “For Russia, cyber warfare is part of a permanent information warfare. This warfare\nis based on the perception that the Western world wants to undermine Russia’s position of\npower and is ultimately engaged in a comprehensive and continuous effort to subjugate the\ncountry,” AH’s former senior national security officer Péter Buda told Direkt36.\n\nSince the Russians see NATO simply as a military tool of the United States, Buda said, their\ncyber espionage “is mainly aimed at detecting information and conflicts of interest that could\ndisrupt the unity of the NATO alliance, in addition to the continuous monitoring of capabilities\nand intentions”. The cyber espionage method, also used by the Russians, called Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT), does not aim at immediate, visible damage, like a simple hacker\nattack, but at a persistent presence within the targeted IT system.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was already advertising his pivot towards Russia and\nChina, Russian hackers of the GRU and FSB – hacking groups known as APT28 and APT29\n– treated Hungary as an enemy and attacked it just as they did other EU and NATO member\nstates. An official of the Orbán government at the time, said that in 2012-2014, in addition to\nthe Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Interior and even the Ministry of\nDefence were compromised by hackers. Based on their digital footprint and intelligence\nsharing with NATO/EU partners, they were also very likely Russians.\n\n“For example, the attacks came from mispelling domains, such as mail.hm.qov.hu, with QOV\ninstead of GOV,” the former official recalled. Details of this attack, including screenshots of a\nduplicate site of the Ministry of Defence asking for login details, were published in 2016 by a\ncybersecurity firm.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Trend Micro\nHowever, nothing about the extensive Russian cyber attack on the MFA and its foreign\nmissions during the second Orbán government has been made public before.\n\n“Every end point of the entire MFA network was infected, everyone was affected. In\nfact, the Russians kept logging in and out of the system with domain administrator\nprivileges,” a former Orbán government official said.\n\nThese claims were confirmed by former intelligence officers who also worked in fields related\nto countering Russian intelligence. The integrity of the MFA’s systems was eventually\nrestored around 2013.\n\nSources have shared numerous stories about the cybersecurity weaknesses that the\nRussians may have exploited. For example, one former Hungarian diplomat recalled that a\nfew years ago it was possible to discuss work matters with the MFA’s state secretaries on\nFacebook Messenger – an insecure channel where such communication should not be\nallowed at all, and which has been hacked numerous times in recent years. Another example\nis that one of the default login passwords used to be “secretXX” (two identical numbers) on\nMFA computers. “And if it had to be changed, the number always increased by one. But ‘just\nin case we forget’, many secretariats and shared computers preferred to keep the original\npassword,” the former diplomat added.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, several databases leaked from hacking attacks years ago are still available\nonline, containing passwords alongside the email addresses of Hungarian MFA officials. For\nexample Direkt36 when looking for the contact details of a Hungarian ambassador, through a\nsimple Google search found not only the diplomat’s private email address, but also a\npassword beginning with “pussy..”.\n\nA former Orbán government official familiar with Russian cyberattacks also said that in the\nfirst half of the 2010s, the Russians hacked not only the Hungarian MFA’s own documents.\nSome of the infected government computers were connected to a zombie network, from\nwhich they continued to attack other NATO member states of greater interest to Moscow.\nZombie networks are computers and devices that hackers have secretly taken control of\nfrom afar and from which they launch coordinated attacks. In some cases, the Hungarian\ninfection was first detected by a NATO third country attacked from the Hungarian network –\nIP addresses made it look like the Hungarian ministry computer was the attacker.\n\n“It’s important to understand that Hungary is not the main target of these attacks, but\nthe security level of Hungarian public and private infrastructures is simply so poor that\nit is the easiest to penetrate here,” a cyber security expert said.\n\nFormer Cyber Defence Management Authority (CDMA) head Ferenc Frész said in a 2015\npresentation that much of their work was about addressing these vulnerabilities. But by then\nthe CDMA had virtually ceased to exist. In his presentation, Frész claimed that Hungarian\ncyber defence had been dismantled in a way that had completely eliminated Hungary’s\ndefence capabilities, and that “it was all done under Russian economic pressure”. He did not\nelaborate on what basis he made this claim, and when contacted by Direkt36 he declined to\ncomment on his statement at the time.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/F8IWjJDhl2w\n\nThe spectacular pro-Russian turn in Hungarian politics came in 2014, after Orbán and Putin\nannounced their agreement on the Paks2 nuclear power plant expansion. Then Péter\nSzijjártó, who already had extensive Russian connections, took over the leadership of the\nMFA. In November 2014, the head of the National Security Authority was fired, the institution\nwas brought under the Ministry of Interior, and a few months later the staff of the Cyber\nDefence Management Authority was laid off as part of a “reorganisation”.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert familiar with the case, the Orbán government began to\nsee Hungarian cyber defence as a linchpin of the Hungarian-Russian rapprochement, and\nthe agreement on the Paks nuclear expansion, among other things, brought a negative turn.\nAnother cybersecurity expert added that CDMA’s staff have also isolated themselves by\nrevealing to various ministries, in an unvarnished style and “without much diplomacy”, what\ncritical vulnerabilities they had found in government networks.\n\nUnder the third Orbán government, cyber defence tasks were taken over by agencies under\nthe Ministry of Interior, primarily the Special Service for National Security (SSNS). However,\nafter the abolition of the Cyber Defence Management Authority, in fact, all the intelligence\nand state agencies started to do a little bit of cyber defence. According to a former official of\nthe Orbán government, the consequence of this include that the various agencies regularly\npoint fingers at each other or wait for each other, operate in isolation from each other and\nsometimes there is even outright rivalry between them.\n\nThe next big wave of Russian attacks instantly showed the weaknesses of the new set-up.\n\n## The “institutional hush-up policy” begins\n\n\n-----\n\nOne morning in November 2016, when the MFA official entered their ministry office at Bem\nSquare in Budapest, they immediately noticed that their computer had disappeared from\ntheir desk. “At first I was just surprised. I went to our secretary to ask what had happened,\nbecause I can’t work without a computer,” the then MFA official recalled to Direkt36. All the\nsecretary could find out was that the computer had been infected with some virus and that\nanother device would arrive at some point.\n\nThe virus had entered the computer via an infected email back in October 2016, said a\nformer Hungarian intelligence officer who shared details of the incident. The Russians misled\nthe MFA official with a scheme known as spearphishing, which involved editing a deceptive,\npersonalised email. The email in this particular case may have appeared at first glance to\nhave been sent by an employee of NATO headquarters in Brussels. Such an email address\nand such a person are not actually in the address database of NATO headquarters in\nBrussels, and the format of the address was not legit either, a former NATO official told\nDirekt36.\n\nThe sender’s first name, however, was exactly the same as that of a close foreign\nacquaintance of the MFA official. “The name could have been misleading and I obviously\nclicked automatically. NATO was also a clever trick, if it wasn’t for the name, I would have\nclicked on it because of the NATO name anyway,” the former official said, adding that the\ncontent of the email was completely uninteresting and they could not remember whether they\nhad clicked on a link or an attachment within the email.\n\n“Nothing suspicious happened after the click, no little skull and crossbones appeared,” they\nadded. Even when their computer disappeared, the MFA official did not think anything was\nwrong, only when the Information Office (IH) later started an investigation, but even that was\nreassuring as it exonerated them from any wrongdoing or suspicion. Soon, however,\ncounterintelligence officers from the Constitution Protection Office (AH) also came in and sat\nthem down for two rounds of interrogations, and the second time the MFA was hooked up to\na lie detector. They tried to find out if the official was spying for Russia.\n\nAccording to a former Hungarian intelligence officer, all the elements of the email hoax were\npart of a carefully planned psychological effect to get the target to definitely open the email.\nThe source added that the Russian intelligence service had been studying the MFA official’s\nbackground, contacts and interests for some time. He knows this because the British\nintelligence service shared information about all this with the AH, which in turn informed the\nIH and the SSNS. Direkt36 sent a comment request to the British embassy about this, but\nthey have not yet replied.\n\nThe opening of the email did not only infect the MFA official’s own computer. “It was a\ncancer-like virus that gets into one machine and then spreads through the system to all the\nothers,” they said. But they only found out about this later, informally, through their senior\ngovernment contacts. At the time, a government contact told them that at least 20 other MFA\n\n\n-----\n\nofficials were also affected. Others who had received similarly personalised, infected emails,\nfor example, were dealing with NATO, security policy, or the Eastern European region. “My\nacquaintance told me that the Russians were trying to get into the system through several\ntargets, and I was just one of them,” the former MFA official added.\n\nBalázs Bencsik, director of the National Cyber Security Center (NKI), a specialised body\nwithin the Hungarian SSNS, revealed some information about Russian cyber attacks in\nHungary in 2016, following year at the Tusványos Summer University. He did not name a\nministry, but claimed that suspicious activity had been discovered on a Hungarian\ngovernment server before the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This Hungarian government\nserver transmitted data to the Netherlands and Germany. Later, it was also discovered that\nthese were orchestrated by the same Russian hacking groups who had also hacked into\nU.S. Democratic Party servers.\n\nBencsik added that similar attacks against Hungarian government systems were “frequent\nand continuous” but not primarily directed against Hungary. For example, he claimed that the\nHungarian government server hacked in 2016 was used by the Russians to disguise (“IP\naddress masking”) their attack on the United States during the presidential election\ncampaign. In other words, the Russians did the same thing again as they did when they\nhacked the MFA around 2012-13, and again used the hacked Hungarian government\ncomputers to launch further attacks on other NATO member states.\n\nRussian hackers did not only attack the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade:\nduring the same period, the Czech Foreign Ministry was also under a very similar Russian\nattack, the details of which were published in the Czech Counterintelligence Service (BIS)\nYearbook 2017. Since the beginning of 2016, the Russians have accessed the email\naccounts of at least 150 Czech MFA officials, from which all information has been periodically\nextracted. In parallel, since December 2016, a different type of less sophisticated “brute\nforce” attack has been launched against hundreds of Czech MFA email accounts.\n\nLubomír Zaorálek, then Czech Foreign Minister, [revealed in early 2017 that dozens of email](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/czech-cyber-attack-russia-suspected-of-hacking-diplomats-emails)\naccounts of senior Czech diplomats had been hacked, with some of the stolen information\nrelating to NATO and EU issues. According to Czech investigative website Neovlivni.cz, even\nthe email accounts of Zaorálek himself and his state secretaries were hacked and thousands\nof documents were downloaded. According to BIS, the compromise of the Czech Foreign\nMinistry’s email accounts “in numerous key aspects corresponds to similar cases\nof cyberespionage, which took place in other European states over the same period”.\n\nWhile the Czechs chose to go public, the Orbán government, like during the Hungarian\ncases of 2012-2014, kept the cyberattacks on MFA systems in 2016 hidden from the public.\n“There was an institutional hush-up policy,” the former MFA official who opened the infected\nemail said. A few months later, the counterintelligence classified the MFA official as a risk to\nnational security. In theory, this means that their activities or contacts were deemed\nincompatible with their work in the MFA for some reason, hence the official was fired.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis was done despite the fact that former intelligence officers with knowledge of the details\nof the case told Direkt36 that investigations had confirmed that the MFA official had not\ncolluded with the Russians, but had simply clicked on the email. Moreover, the official later\nstarted working for the government of another European NATO member state, passing that\ncountry’s national security screening without a hitch.\n\n“Unfortunately, several victims have been slaughtered,” a former official of the Orban\ngovernment who had direct knowledge of such cases said. According to him, the AH has on\nseveral occasions launched investigations on suspicion of espionage and fired ministry\nemployees who simply just clicked on infected emails. “They simply don’t believe that these\nattacks are really being carried out by all kinds of pimple faced St Petersburg kids,” he\nexplained. According to the source, this is basically due to the Ministry of Interior’s “senior\npoliceman mentality”, even when it comes to cyber defence: “What does a policeman do? He\nhas to respond immediately and nab someone physically” the former official added.\n\nBut firing the clicking employees has not helped stop the attacks.\n\n## Russians gained access to windowless secret rooms\n\nCompletely enclosed, windowless or curtained “VKH rooms” can be found everywhere in the\nworld where there is a Hungarian diplomatic mission, even in the most remote countries.\nThese secure rooms protect the endpoints of the closed Protected Foreign Network (Védett\nKülügyi Hálózat, VKH), foreign ministry computers that encrypt messages and to which, in\nprinciple, no external device can be connected, a former ambassador of the Orbán\ngovernment explained.\n\nVKH rooms are used by foreign ministry staff and Hungarian diplomats when they want to\ncommunicate classified national, NATO or EU information to their colleagues and superiors.\nThese rooms “may only be entered with a valid personal security certificate and user\nauthorisation, and in possession of a special card authorisation, or with the written\nauthorisation and escort of the head of security”, according to the Hungarian MFA’s security\nregulations.\n\nAnyone accessing this system can also access Hungarian state secrets and allied\ninformation classified as “restricted” and “confidential”. These are classified data, according\nto the law, the disclosure of which to the public or to unauthorised persons would adversely\naffect or be harmful to the public interest, and are classified by default for 10 and 20 years\nrespectively.\n\nThe former ambassador recalled the difficult process of communication. If a diplomat wants\nto send a message through the VKH, he or she brings their notes on piece of paper into the\nroom, types the message into a computer on the keyboard and the system encrypts it with a\n\n\n-----\n\nrandomly generated unique code. Then the piece of paper must be destroyed. No mobile\nphones or other electronic devices are allowed in the VKH premises. The system logs the\ntime spent in the room and the materials accessed.\n\nRussian intelligence had already successfully hacked the VKH network in the first major\nwave of attacks in the early 2010s, a former official of the Orbán government with direct\nknowledge of the incident told Direkt36. This claim was confirmed by Hungarian diplomats\nwho also heard about the hacking. The former government official said that around 2013, the\ndevices in all the VKH rooms around the world, in the ministry on Bem Square and in\nHungarian diplomatic missions abroad were all replaced to restore the integrity of the\nnetwork. The former ambassador of the Orbán government recalled that he had been told by\nthe people from the security department of the ministry who had visited them that the old\nequipment was outdated and that the network would be replaced completely.\n\nPéter Szijjártó, Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán. Photo: kormany.hu\nReplacing the computers almost ten years ago did not solve the problem for long. Several\nformer intelligence officials familiar with the cyberattack on the Foreign Ministry because of\ntheir agency’s involvement told Direkt36 that the VKH had been hacked again by Russians\nusing IT tools in recent years. A member of the Hungarian parliament’s foreign affairs\ncommittee recalled that Hungarian diplomats had been saying for at least a year and a half\nthat the system was again outdated and insecure, and that this was the reason why they had\nasked for money to upgrade the VKH.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, according to several reports, there were also problems with the physical security of\nthe system, but no information is available on whether these contributed to the latest breakin.\n\nAccording to the former ambassador of the Orbán government, for example, a common\nproblem was that the secure VKH rooms in remote diplomatic representations were not\nalways properly installed. The foreign affairs committee member confirmed this, adding that\nthe construction process itself posed a significant risk. For example, during a rebuilding\nproject, a VKH machine could be left unattended on the construction site. And a former MFA\nofficial recalled an incident from the first half of the 2010s, when the door of a secure VKH\nroom at a Hungarian mission in Central Asia was found to have been forced open. A similar\nincident was also made public in 2017. A diplomat from the Hungarian diplomatic mission in\nUzbekistan reported serious security deficiencies to the Szijjártó-led ministry, without much\ntraction. [He only received an informal reply to stop complaining – “give me a break”.](https://444.hu/2017/05/06/allitsd-le-magad-ennyi-volt-a-kulugyminiszterium-valasza-a-diplomatanak-aki-jelezte-hogy-teljesen-vedtelen-az-uzbeg-nagykovetseg)\n\nBy hacking the VKH, Russian intelligence services were able to access any of the\ndocuments transmitted on it. Sources who gave details to Direkt36 did not specify exactly\nwhat material was compromised and when. The classified documents transmitted on the\nVKH do not only contain information from Hungarian sources. According to the security\nregulations of the ministry, confidential NATO and EU documents are also received, and the\nformer ambassador of the Orbán government added that Hungarian reports transcribing\nvarious NATO or EU meetings are also received through this channel.\n\nBut beyond the “restricted” and “confidential” information also transmitted on the VKH, there\nis even more strictly protected information, classified by default for thirty years. These are\nclassified as “secret” or “top secret”. According to the former ambassador of the Orbán\ngovernment, no such information has been received by his representation through the VKH\nsystem. He said that documents considered to be highly classified information, could only be\naccessed by a narrow internal circle in the Bem Square ministry, through separate channels,\nas required by the ministry’s security regulations. Direkt36 has no information that these\neven more sensitive channels have been compromised.\n\nAccording to a former intelligence officer with indirect knowledge of the incident, the integrity\nof the VKH system was supposed to be temporarily restored around February 2022, but the\nnow obsolete VKH machines have not yet been replaced. The source added that the MFA’s\nregular internal network remained infected.\n\nEven half a dozen diplomats from EU and NATO member states told Direkt36 in February\n2022 that they had not received any official information from the Hungarian foreign ministry\nabout the Russian cyber attack, its severity or whether it had affected NATO and EU\ninformation. “It should go without saying that if you are unable to eradicate the infection on\nyour own, you ask for help from allies. The only time you don’t tell them is if you can\nimmediately repel the attack,” a former NATO official said. The source added that within the\nNorth Atlantic alliance, “there is also a gentlemen’s agreement that if you know your network\n\n\n-----\n\nis infected, you try to exclude NATO documents from it . A senior diplomat from an EU\ncountry, however, said that a government has discretion on what information to share and\nwhat not to share, as there are no specific rules.\n\nBut compared to the world of diplomacy, the rules are much clearer for counterintelligence.\n“Any vulnerability that allows the compromise of protected data of the allied system causes\ndamage that is difficult to repair afterwards,” Péter Buda, AH’s former senior national security\nofficer told Direkt36. According to him, preventing attacks on protected IT systems should be\na top priority. However, if rapid eradication fails, it will wittingly or unwittingly serve the\ninterests of the attacker.\n\nUnlike the secretive Hungarian diplomacy, however, the Hungarian counterintelligence\nservice had previously informed its partners of the compromise of the foreign ministry.\n\n## Hungarian counterintelligence discussed the problem over a beer\n\nIn the autumn of 2021, representatives of Europe’s intelligence services gathered again at\nthe Club de Berne to discuss current issues, with Russia being the main topic. Club de Berne\nis one of the most important intelligence sharing forums between Western\ncounterintelligence services, where the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Switzerland and\nthe UK are represented, and where the U.S., Canada and sometimes even Israel are invited.\nThe Hungarian participant in the intelligence sharing forum is the Constitution Protection\nOffice (AH).\n\nThis time, intelligence officers did not gather for a meeting at the most senior level, but for a\nlower-level expert meeting. In such cases, the invited participants are mid-level managers,\nsay counter-intelligence directors, who are familiar with the concrete details of major\noperations and can discuss them with their foreign counterparts. However, the most\nimportant part of the agenda is not the relatively formal and generic daytime conference\nprogramme, but the evening dinner and beer where a lot of interesting information is shared.\n\nA former intelligence officer with indirect knowledge of what happened at last autumn’s\nmeeting told Direkt36 that it was also at this time, during an informal drinking session after\nthe formal meetings, that the Hungarian AH representative told his Western colleagues that\nthe Hungarian MFA had apparently come under extremely heavy Russian infiltration. In\nresponse, several European participants immediately began to list the number and variety of\nhacking attempts made by Russians in their countries in the recent past.\n\nThe most recent case was in Germany, where the email accounts of Bundestag members\nand other politicians were hacked during the German election campaign, which the Russians\n“combined with disinformation and influence operations”, according to a report on the\nwebsite of the SSNS’s National Cyber Security Center. Similar Russian cyber attacks have\nhit Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in recent years. These EU countries\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowed roughly the same protocol in dealing with cyber espionage: they detected the\ntrouble, took more or less swift action to counter it, shared information with their allies, and\nthen finally made the incident public and protested to Russia.\n\nAccording to the former intelligence officer, the AH representative did not share information\nwith Club de Berne members on the specific official orders of the MFA or the Orbán\ngovernment. “The AH has a fundamental interest in sharing information, because if it doesn’t\ngive, it doesn’t get,” said a cybersecurity expert who has had previous ties to the agency.\n\nThe example of Austria, who were effectively suspended from the club a few years ago for\ntheir unreliability, could also serve as a deterrent to the Hungarian intelligence services. “One\nof the most important areas for NATO in the last few years has been the strengthening of\nalliance-level cooperation in countering Russian cyber attacks,” explained former senior AH\nofficer Péter Buda on the importance of information sharing on Russian matters.\n\nIn recent months, following the Club de Berne meeting, the news of the hacking of the\nHungarian MFA has reached a much wider audience of foreign and security policy experts,\nincluding foreigners. “It is now common knowledge in the European intelligence community\nthat the Russians have hacked the Hungarian foreign ministry and that many Hungarian\ndiplomatic missions have been compromised,” said an EU national security official who\nlearned of the hack from his own institution in January 2022.\n\nBut beyond secret intelligence sharing, the Orbán government is conspicuously refraining\nfrom openly confronting Russian intelligence activity. For example, Direkt36 previously\n[revealed that Russian spies caught in the act in Hungary are always “quietly expelled”, i.e.](https://www.direkt36.hu/en/orosz-diplomatakat-ertek-kemkedesen-magyarorszagon-es-szep-csendben-ki-is-szoritottak-oket/)\nthey are simply sent home and spy affairs are never made public.\n\nAs for the only Hungarian exception, the case of the Russian diplomat in Budapest who was\nexpelled after the Skripal poisoning, we revealed that Budapest and Moscow had\ndeliberately conducted the expulsion and counter-expulsion in a way that would not damage\nfriendly relations. For example, a Russian was expelled from Budapest when he had finished\nhis diplomatic posting and was preparing to return home anyway.\n\nThere are also quite spectacular examples of soft handling of Russian espionage. Former\nHungarian diplomat to Moscow Szilárd Kiss, for example, was allowed to stay in his post\neven after he failed two national security screenings because of his Russian intelligence\nconnections. As for former MEP Béla Kovács, who has since been convicted of preparations\nto commit espionage, Péter Szijjártó told Index.hu that he had not raised the issue with any\nformer Russian ambassador. Since then, Kovács has been living and teaching in Moscow\n[and is currently analysing the invasion of Ukraine on Russian propaganda websites.](https://24.hu/kulfold/2022/03/07/a-kemkedesert-elitelt-kgbela-egy-orosz-propagandaoldalon-elemzi-a-haborut/)\n\nThe last time Hungary made international news on Russian cyber espionage was a few\nweeks ago, when it emerged that the Orbán government was blocking Ukraine, which has\nsuffered serious Russian cyber attacks, from joining NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence\n\n\n-----\n\nCentre of Excellence. At the EU summit in December, Viktor Orbán was asked in vain to lift\nthe veto. Orbán was only willing to lift his veto after the Russian military invasion of Ukraine.\n\n_Illustration: Péter Somogyi (szarvas) / Telex_\n\n\n-----",
