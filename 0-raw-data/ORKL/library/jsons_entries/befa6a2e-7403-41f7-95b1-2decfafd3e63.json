Because individual organizations continue to battle highly capable — and highly\ncoordinated — cyber threat actors, including nation-state and advanced criminal groups.\nThe most effective way for private industry and individual government agencies to stand a\nchance against such threats, is to work together.\n\nOrganizations first need behavioral analytics that constantly look deep into individual\nnetworks and hunt for threats as they enter the network, as well as during successive stages\nof the attack. With those insights we can create a Collective Defense network, where\nindividual companies share anonymized threat information in real-time and collaborate to\ntriage and stop potential threats. This Collective Defense approach allows defenders to\nfunction on par with the attacker: hunting and fighting as a team, through knowledge\nsharing, crowdsourcing, and collaborative action.\n\n## Background\n\nCyber attacks are growing in frequency and intensity. On December 13th, news broke of a\nwidespread network intrusions based on a software supply chain compromise of IT service\nprovider SolarWinds. Quickly underscoring the severity of this breach, the U.S. Cybersecurity\nand Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nreleased alerts, and researchers at FireEye published technical details indicating that the\nsoftware supply chain compromise occurred earlier and resulted in a trojanized version of\nSolarWinds’ Orion remote management software. This version, which FireEye dubbed\nSUNBURST, was distributed to SolarWinds customers between March and June.\n\nMedia reporting has attributed these compromises to threat actors associated with Russian\nintelligence services. This follows previous reporting attributing the FireEye breach to APT29\n(aka Cozy Bear), a threat actor linked to Russia’s SVR intelligence service. Media reporting\nindicates these threat actors were able to penetrate deep into networks for many months and\nwere able to obtain administrative rights as well as establish legitimate-appearing credentials\nand points of entry. Given the scale and scope of these adversary activities, it is critical that\nwe take action now to limit further incidents.\n\nThe adversary will continue to modify their techniques...Their goal is to hide in the noise of\nnormal network activities, which is why being able to detect behaviors and collaborate broadly\nin real time is so critical.\n\n## SUNBURST tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\nThe threat actor used several sophisticated techniques to hide command and control traffic,\nsuch as mimicking SolarWinds’ Orion traffic and leveraging infrastructure providers to\nmasquerade as trusted geolocated environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile one of the distinctive network behaviors associated with SUNBURST that has been\ndiscussed by the cybersecurity community is command and control (C2) using Domain\nGeneration Algorithm (DGA), it is our perspective at IronNet that this behavior more closely\naligns with DNS tunneling. In fact, our initial detections of the SUNBURST C2 domain in\nearly Summer 2020 were based upon our DNS tunneling analytic.\n\nMore than 18,000 SolarWinds customers downloaded the update that had the SUNBURST\nbackdoor and were exposed. The actor then chose a much smaller set of companies and\ngovernment agencies they wanted to exploit and downloaded a second set of tools and\ncompromised those networks.\n\n## How IronNet detected — and correlated — SUNBURST\n\nOn May 31, 2020, using the DNS tunneling analytic within IronDefense, IronNet’s network\ndetection and response solution, we first detected the initial SUNBURST behavior in nearreal-time on a customer’s network.\n\nUpon detection, an alert was automatically shared into the customer’s IronDefense instance\nand into IronDome, our Collective Defense platform, where the same behavior was\nsubsequently detected and correlated across four customer environments spread over six\nmonths. While the significance of these alerts did not rise to an actionable level, providing\nour customers the ability to identify this unusual behavior propagating across multiple\norganizations enables them to collaborate in real time and significantly increase their ability\nto identify and stop the threat before it spreads. Moreover, based on our analysis and\ncontinued assessment, none of our customer networks were compromised by the second\nstage deployments of SolarWinds. It is our assessment that if such an attempt had been\nmade, it likely would have been detected and actionable.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe know that in the future, the adversary will continue to modify their advanced techniques\nin an attempt to hide their access operations, elevate privileges, move laterally, steal data,\nand potentially take more aggressive action to modify or delete information. As in this case,\ntheir goal is to hide in the noise of normal network activities, which is why being able to\ndetect behaviors and collaborate broadly in real time is so critical.\n\nThis is why IronNet was founded: We use advanced behavioral analytics and machine\nlearning techniques to find suspicious behaviors and leverage our game-changing collective\ndefense capability to crowdsource knowledge from our customers to help them identify new\nand novel threats. This allows our clients to see things others might miss, as well as to find\nthreat actors who’ve already gotten in and are trying to hide.\n\nHad a large percentage of those exposed to SolarWinds detected the behavior and been\nsharing information about this potential threat and collaborating on it in realtime, it is\nsignificantly more likely that the campaign would have been recognized early on.\n\n## The Call to Action\n\nMore than 18,000 companies were exposed to the SolarWinds hack. Each of those\ncompanies worked individually to protect their networks. Imagine if the security analysts for\nthose 18,000 companies had been working together at network speed and sharing\ncrowdsourced knowledge, leveraging their collective expertise to defend themselves, their\nindustries, and the nation.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow is the time to make this paradigm shift from defending in isolation to Collective\nDefense. In order to truly create a real-time defensive capability, we must leverage:\n\nBehavioral analytics to detect anomalies that are invisible to signature-based systems.\nAn expert system to help us deal with false positives and work at speed.\nA flexible hunt platform for analysts to find nation state actors early on.\nA machine learning engine that correlates events across organizations and industries.\nFor example:\n\nCompanies from specific industries or sectors;\nCross-industry collaborations, such as critical infrastructure providers;\nFederal government organizations from different departments and agencies; and\nCollaboration across the public and private sectors to address broad campaigns\nlike this one.\nSharing anonymized threat information, as appropriate, with the government to\nempower our national defense.\n\nThis will enable us to build the real-time radar picture of cyberspace that will allow the\ngovernment and industry to work together to defend their own companies, their sectors, and\nthe nation. This is the IronNet vision.\n\n## What IronNet customers are saying\n\nAt IronNet, we remain highly engaged with our customers as the SolarWinds/SUNBURST\nhack continues to unfold. This engagement goes beyond the real-time sharing and\ncollaboration enabled by our IronDefense solution and the IronDome platform. From our\nexecutive leadership and security operations center, to our customer success team, IronNet is\nworking closely, on a daily basis, with our customers to get them the latest on discussions\ntaking place at the local, state, national, and international level, and gathering their feedback\nand input. This tight partnership with our customers is what sets IronNet apart from other\nsecurity vendors and is a dynamic that we are committed to from the top down to every\nsingle employee.\n\nHere are a few comments customers have made throughout this event:\n\n“IronNet has the best visibility, tools, and people to support our investigation.” - Large\nenergy utility company\n\n“We cannot thank IronNet enough for all their support throughout this Incident.” - Large\ninvestment company\n\n“Thanks for hunting so hard and supporting us through this investigation.” - Large banking\ncompany\n\n\n-----\n\n“As a customer of IronNet I am proud to be able to say that we have the best network and\ncollective defense platform to help build our internal cyber resilience.” - International\nfinancial firm\n\n”Thank you [IronNet] for your vigilance and consultation throughout.” - Mid-sized banking\ncompany\n\n“IronNet is a partner, not a vendor. You are the first call I make when I need support and a\nsecond set of eyes to help determine ‘what’s next’.” - Large energy utility company\n\n“I’m really happy with the level of support [IronNet] has provided during this situation.” Large energy utility company\n\nFor more information on how Collective Defense can provide you with greater visibility and\n[cyber defense, view our on-demand demo or request a live demo today.](https://www.ironnet.com/on-demand-demo)\n\nAbout Ironnet\n\nFounded in 2014 by GEN (Ret.)
