In order to increase the likelihood of\ntheir malware successfully communicating home, cyber espionage threat actors are\nincreasingly abusing legitimate web services, in lieu of DNS lookups to retrieve a\ncommand and control address. This negates the requirement to make DNS requests for\ndomains that may be considered malicious and are therefore blocked. For attackers,\nthat’s an advantage because it allows their initial communications channel to be\nobscured amongst other traffic to legitimate services.\n\nThis blog post examines two similar malware families that utilize the aforementioned\ntechnique to abuse legitimate websites, their connections to each other, and their\nconnections to known espionage campaigns. The first of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_A’,\na malware family that has links to a series of attacks associated with a backdoor attack\nmethod commonly known as [SNEEPY (aka ByeByeShell) first reported by Rapid7 in](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=TrojanSpy:Win32/Sneepy.A)\n2013. The second of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_B’, which has a loose link to the series\nof attacks associated with [Operation Patchwork and](https://www.cymmetria.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Unveiling-Patchwork.pdf) [The Hangover Report.](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-05-20/hangover-report)\n\n## Confucius says… resolve your command and control domains using web services.\n\nIn 2013, Rapid7 reported on a series of relatively amateur attacks against Pakistani\ntargets. For a long time after the report was published, little changed in how the\nattackers operated. Although many of the attacks we see today from the group remain\nthe same, we began observing a new backdoor, CONFUCIUS_A, being dropped by the\nattackers starting in early 2014. Specifically, the command and control addresses used\nacross multiple SNEEPY samples were being used by CONFUCIUS_A samples. In the\ncase of just one or two samples, without temporal overlap, this may not be deemed a\nstrong link to CONFUCIUS_A, however it occurs across a great deal of the infrastructure\nwe have observed.\n\nIn most cases where we have been able to identify the droppers, the attack begins with\nan executable file being sent directly to targets via e-mail. Occasionally the attackers\nleverage builders for known document exploits, but most of the time they still use selfextracting binaries. The themes of the phishing e-mails vary according to the target, but\ninvariably the file is compiled with an icon that matches the expected content. Examples\nof the themes used in attacks using CONFUCIUS_A and the surrounding cluster of\nactivity include:\n\n\n-----\n\nInvitations to events relevant to the recipients\nPornographic material\nFake updates to popular software products\nNews content\nPolitical content\n\nWe have limited evidence of who the targets are, but they appear to primarily be based\nin the Middle East and parts of Asia, with a focus on Pakistan. In addition to those\ntargets, there are occasional targets seen at enterprises across the globe.\n\nEarly samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware did not use any legitimate web services\nfor DNS resolution; however, more recent samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware use\na range of legitimate web services to resolve command and control addresses, the\nhighest profile of which are Yahoo and Quora. The malware was given its name based\non the content of one of the first pages we saw being retrieved to determine a command\nand control address, which is written in the style of a ‘Confucius says’ joke. See Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1 – An example of Quora page contacted by the malware._\n\nSometimes malware communicates with legitimate web services simply to perform a\nconnectivity check, but in this case the page was too specific to suggest that was what\nthe attackers were doing. So we decided to investigate how the malware processed the\nresulting content.\n\n## If this is the question, what is the answer?\n\nFor the purposes of illustrating how the command and control address is decoded we will\nlook at the sample with SHA256:\na21b956e1be9dcfa8a28c38dc0bb0657508b5588bcf1435052700aea22910d7d. This\nsample of the malware requests the page shown below in order to determine what IP to\nPOST to.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – The Quora page contacted by the malware to retrieve its command and_\n_control address._\n\nReading through the answer, it all makes sense until the section highlighted is reached.\nBy looking at the underlying code, we found that CONFUCIUS_A is looking for keywords\nbetween the phrases “suggested options are” and “hope it will help” and decoding the\ninterim phrase. The decoding is done using a simple lookup table, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3 – A memory dump from a CONFUCIUS_A sample showing the lookup table_\n_used by the malware, the table is truncated for presentation purposes._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe lookup table begins with the marker for the beginning and end of the useful content,\nand then contains 255 words, each of which corresponds to a number (for example\nprudent == 255). Using this lookup table in memory it can then derive the command and\ncontrol address from the text between the markers, “fill plate clever road” becomes\n91.210.107[.]104.\n\n_Figure 4 – HTTP POST request made to command and control server_\n\n## Additional malware contacting Yahoo and Quora\n\nDuring our investigation into the CONFUCIUS_A malware, one of the ways we tried to\nidentify variations of the backdoor was by looking for samples that communicated with\nthe same legitimate services as known CONFUCIUS_A samples. In doing so, we\nencountered another set of samples exhibiting very similar behavior, which we refer to as\nCONFUCIUS_B, due to their similarity, and their likely similar origins. Unfortunately, we\nhave fewer details about how CONFUCIUS_B malware is delivered or the targets it\nintends to hit.\n\nFor the purposes of this write-up we will follow the chain of dropped files from the\ndropper with SHA256:\n627724fa447e3937f3cdc5388285935a52d6970a616f4ac3d02e583d160cbfc0.\n\n## Enter CONFUCIUS_B…\n\nAt first glance CONFUCIUS_B looks very similar to CONFUCIUS_A, and they are also\npackaged in plain SFX binary files. The CONFUCIUS_B executable is disguised as a\nPowerPoint presentation, using a Right-To-Left-Override (RTLO) trick and a false icon.\nWhen executed, the self-extracting RAR package drops four files to the %AppData%\nfolder, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n_Figure 5 – The files dropped by CONFUCIUS_B_\n\nFancy.vbs executes fancy.bat, which in turn opens the presentation and runs the second\nstage executable svchost.exe. As with CONFUCIUS_A, the initial beacons from this\nsvchost.exe are also to Yahoo and Quora, but the pages contacted, whilst odd did not\ncontain any obvious markers, rather they appeared to be entirely gibberish:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – An exemplary Quora page contacted by the malware._\n\nSo far, the execution chain, involving an SFX RAR and multiple scripts is similar to some\nsamples of SNEEPY, which we associate with CONFUCIUS_A, but this is where the\nsimilarities between CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B begin to diverge. Svchost.exe\nhas a custom obfuscation scheme not seen in CONFUCIUS_A. This obfuscation allows\nus to quickly identify all of the CONFUCIUS_B variants; their hashes are included at the\nend of this post. The obfuscation routine is given in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – The obfuscation routine shared across all CONFUCIUS_B samples._\n\n\n-----\n\nUnderneath that custom obfuscation lies a UPX packed executable which contains the\nYahoo and Quora functionality that originally piqued our interest. After unpacking the\nUPX code, we began reverse engineering the resulting binary to see how\nCONFUCIUS_B interacted with the Yahoo and Quora pages it initially requested. We\ndiscovered that CONFUCIUS_B pieces together its DNS resolution from keywords in the\nYahoo and Quora posts similar to that of CONFUCIUS_A.\n\nCONFUCIUS_B takes certain keywords in the Quora and Yahoo pages and applies\nthem to a lookup table in memory. Using that lookup table an IP address to POST to is\nderived. The way this is done can be seen in a memory dump from the running process\nwhen it contacts a relevant address, for example as shown in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8 – A memory dump of a CONFUCIUS_B illustrating the lookup table and initial_\n_beacon address._\n\nThe lookup table takes key words and assigns them numbers, or a ‘.’ character, in order\nto build an IP address, and is arranged as shown in Table 1.\n\nlove 0\n\nhate 1\n\nfire 2\n\ncouple 3\n\ngreen 4\n\nweed 5\n\nblock 6\n\nparty 7\n\n\n-----\n\nnatural 8\n\nhopeful 9\n\nor .\n\n_Table 1 – Lookup table used by the malware to determine it’s command and control_\n_address._\n\nBy applying the lookup table to the Quora page shown in Figure 6, we can derive the IP\nthe malware will POST to next for further communications.\n\nUsing our lookup table, giving us an address of 149.202.110[.]2:\n\nThis method of substituting words for components of an IP address, and the repeat use\nof Yahoo and Quora are novel, which suggest it is likely that the same malware author,\nor group of malware authors, authored both backdoors.\n\n## Link to Patchwork and test samples\n\nThe domain “com-account-jfnjkr[.]xyz” is linked to the CONFUCIUS_B attacks as it was a\nC2 for the sample\nc975954fbb473ed8ce3a98ca2c4977bf22d2413db01eda87599524969565836f, which\ndownloads CONFUCIUS_B. On May 24, 2016, the same domain hosted the sample\n8cfd559756630d967bb597b087af98adc75895a1ec52586d53a2d898e4a6e9b0; a basic\nfile stealer malware associated with the Patchwork attackers, via a shared mutex:\n{9754893678976458374658764387563876}.\n\nAll of the CONFUCIUS_B samples share the same mutex, “rCkBs1Uj493NaMXYY1LZ”.\nPivoting through samples in Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we were able to find what\nappears to be an early test sample of the malware that creates the same mutex; the\nSHA256 of the sample is\n0bd7db12ba8d9ce9d29983ef76205864dce146eb14cebe32a3431f994cc770ee. We\nbelieve it is a test sample, as the configured command and control domain for this\nsample is ‘breachframework[.]com’. This can also be linked back to known\nCONFUCIUS_B sample via a shared SSL certificate. Breachframework[.]com previously\nresolved to 5.135.85[.]16, which used the certificate\n\n\n-----\n\nf6438919d27d08aa545e2f90b58d445cccac6c09, the same certificate was used by\n104.23.35[.]15, a known command and control address for CONFUCIUS_B. These\nrelationships are summarized in Figure 9.\n\n_Figure 9 – An overview of the link to the test infrastructure._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we discussed two separate malware variations that behave in very\nsimilar ways and use similar techniques to acquire a C2 address, with both using Yahoo\nAnswers and Quora to evade traditional mechanisms for blocking command and control\ndomains. Although we cannot link the two clusters of activity by their infrastructure, the\ntechnique used to resolve domains is unusual. We also believe that both clusters of\nactivity have links to attacks with likely Indian origins, the CONFUCIUS_A attacks are\nlinked to the use of SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL and the CONFUCIUS_B have a loose link\nto Hangover. The two malware families themselves are also very similar, and therefore\nwe think that the shared technique is an indication of a single developer, or development\ncompany, behind both CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B. It is likely that the two\nclusters of activity are operated by two different operators; however, as the command\nand control infrastructure used by each cluster differs in the choices of hosting providers.\n\nPalo Alto Networks AutoFocus customers can further explore these malware families\nand related campaigns with the
