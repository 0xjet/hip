    "plain_text": "# Kremlin RATs from Nigeria\n\n**blog.group-ib.com/rats_nigeria**\n\n05.04.2021\n\nThe analysis of phishing campaigns carried out by a new threat actor\n\nIn May 2020, Group-IB's network graph — an automated tool for analyzing adversary\ninfrastructure — first detected domains with an unusual pattern (*kremlin*.duckdns.org) to\nwhich various malicious files were connecting. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution\nteam examined the domains and identified three phishing campaigns that were used to\ndeliver various RATs, such as NetWire or AsyncRAT. The campaigns had been active since\n2019 and targeted users in Poland, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan,\nBulgaria, Belarus, Greece, and the Czech Republic.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of these campaigns revealed that the threat actor used phishing emails with\nmalicious attachments to gain initial access. Office documents exploiting vulnerabilities in\nMicrosoft Office products, as well as malicious macros were used as attachments. Group-IB\ndiscovered more than 100 phishing email samples distributed en masse.\n\nDepending on the geographical distribution of the targets the cybercriminals altered the email\ncontents and language. Phishing emails were accompanied by fake purchasing orders and\nother financial documents, used COVID-19 as a theme sometimes and were made to look\nlike legitimate communications from banks or well-known logistics companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe unconventional naming pattern for the domains used to deliver malware (*kremlin,\n*crimea, *putin) might be an amateurish attempt to imitate Russian speaking cybercriminals\nto throw researchers off track and complicate attribution.\n\nNevertheless, during further analysis of the adversary infrastructure and the TTPs employed,\nas well as a set of malicious software used in conjunction with DDNS services Group-IB\nresearchers attributed the campaigns with high confidence to a previously unknown threat\nactor from Nigeria.\n\nThe post examines three threat actor's campaigns carried out in 2019 and 2020, analyzes\nthe adversary's infrastructure and TTPs and provides recommendations and mitigation\ntechniques to thwart the threat.\n\nSummer 2020 campaign\n\nThe initial list of domains that caught our attention was:\n\n- crimea-kremlin[.]duckdns.org\n\n- kremlin-afghan[.]duckdns.org\n\n- kremlin-crimea[.]duckdns.org\n\n- kremlin-turbo[.]duckdns.org\n\n\n-----\n\nThese domains were registered to the same IP address (79.134.225[.]43) on June 15, 2020.\nAccording to the Group-IB network graph, there are about 30 different malicious files\nassociated with these four domains. The decoys found suggest that the campaign targeted\nusers in Poland, Turkey, Italy, Germany, and Bulgaria.\n\nMalicious infrastructure identified by Group-IB's graph\n\nFurther analysis showed that most of the files had been uploaded to public sources from\nJune 25, 2020. The most common names were \"Potwierdzenie transakcji.xls\", \"İşlem\nmakbuzu\", \"WACKER - 000160847.xls\", and \"Potwierdzenie operacji.xls\". One of these files\n(SHA1: 95A6A416F682A9D254E76EC38ADE01CE241B3366) is a decoy document in\nPolish supposedly sent from one of the local banks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy document SHA1: 95A6A416F682A9D254E76EC38ADE01CE241B3366_\n\nInfection\n\nAfter the macros in this document are enabled, a PowerShell script is executed to extract the\nsecond-stage command from the lab.jpg file located on a remote server:\n\nExecutable PS script from a macro\n\nThe lab.jpg file contains a Base64-encoded command that, after being decoded, looks as\nfollows:\n\nDeobfuscated contents of lab jpg\n\n\n-----\n\nThis code reads the contents of the file http://officeservicecorp[.]biz/rnp.txt, which contains a\npayload.\n\nAs a result of this sequence of PowerShell scripts, the infamous NetWire RAT is loaded and\nexecuted. The tool connects to its C&C server (kremlin-crimea[.]duckdns.org) on port 3396.\n\n_NetWire RAT configuration_\n\nIf we insert the original domains into the graph in increments of 2, we will see not only these\ndomains, but also the rest of the associated infrastructure that was involved in all the\ninfection stages.\n\n\n-----\n\nGraph in increments of 2. Associated infrastructure detected by Group-IB's network graph\n\nIt is interesting to note that files that connected office-service-tech[.]info also performed\nnetwork connections to ahjuric[.]si. One of these files (SHA1\na3816c37d0fbe26a87d1cc7beff91ce5816039e7) was a decoy document in Turkish with the\nlogo of a state-owned bank in Turkey.\n\n\n-----\n\nA decoy document targeting Turkish users. SHA1:\na3816c37d0fbe26a87d1cc7beff91ce5816039e7\n\nThis document contains a malicious macro that executes a PowerShell script. The latter\nreads Code.txt from a remote server and runs a chain of obfuscated PS scripts.\n\nContents of ahjuric[.]si/code.txt\n\nContents of ahjuric[.]si/code.txt\n\nExecuting the obfuscated PS script leads to another Base64-encoded script being executed.\nThe latter will ultimately execute the payload in the form of NetWire RAT from office-servicetech[.]info/pld.txt.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Contents of office-service-tech[.]info/pld.txt_\n\nThe C&C server of this sample is crimea-kremlin.duckdns[.]org.\n\nWe also found files that make network connections simultaneously to kremlinturbo.duckdns[.]org and wshsoft[.]company. The latter domain name brings to mind the WSH\nRAT, which is based on the Houdini code. One of these files (SHA1:\nb42a3b8c6d53a28a2dc84042d95ce9ca6e09cbcf) is a RAT sample that sends requests such\nas /is-ready to the C&C server kremlin-turbo.duckdns[.]org:3397. WSHRAT is indicated as its\nUA.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Network requests of the file with SHA1: b42a3b8c6d53a28a2dc84042d95ce9ca6e09cbcf_\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this stage, it is important to note that some of the domains used in this campaign were\nregistered to the email address tetragulf@yahoo[.]com.\n\nSpring 2020 campaign\n\nWhile examining all other related infrastructure, we came across domains registered to\nasetonly@yahoo[.]com. Since early 2020, the following domains have been registered to this\nemail address:\n\n1. nitro-malwrhunterteams[.]com\n\n2. office-data-labs[.]com\n\n3. putin-malwrhunterteams[.]com\n\n4. kremlin-malwrhunterteam[.]info\n\n5. skidware-malwrhunterteams[.]com\n\n6. screw-malwrhunterteams[.]com\n\n7. screw-malwrhunterteam[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n8. office-services-labs[.]com\n9. office-cloud-reserve[.]com\n10. office-clean-index[.]com\n11. office-cleaner-indexes[.]com\n\nWe collected over 130 different malware samples from various sources associated with\nthese domains. Judging by the names and content of these samples, the spring 2020\ncampaign targeted users in Europe and CIS countries. Group-IB experts uncovered decoy\ndocuments in Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Russian and Greek.\n\nThe campaign's first files were uploaded to public sandboxes on March 23, 2020. One of\nthese files was named \"Аналіз проекту.docx\" (SHA1d8826efc7c0865c873330a25d805c95c9e64ad05) and was distributed as an attachment to\nthe email \"Електронна розсилка_ Змінене замовлення.eml\" (SHA17f1fdf605e00323c055341919173a7448e3641fb), which was uploaded to VirusTotal via a\nweb interface from Ukraine.\n\n_Contents of the email \"Електронна розсилка_ Змінене замовлення.eml\"_\n\nInfection\n\nThe document's content doesn't spark much interest and looks like a scanned invoice.\nHowever, the document exploits the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, which executes a\ncommand that loads the payload http://office-cloud-reserve[.]com/hydro.exe.\n\nExecutable PowerShell script\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload is the AgentTesla spyware . A legitimate compromised domain\n(ftp.centredebeautenellycettier[.]fr) was used as a server for data exfiltration.\n\n_Setting up an FTP connection_\n\nAnother analyzed file (SHA1- 19324fc16f99a92e737660c4737a41df044ecc54) called\n\"Байланысорталықтары.img\" was distributed as an attachment to COVID-19-themed emails\n(SHA1: 403c0f9a210f917e88d20d97392d9b1b14cbe310) in Kazakh.\n\n_Contents of the email 403c0f9a210f917e88d20d97392d9b1b14cbe310_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attachment is an .iso image. In some cases, it is named Байланыс орталықтары.img .\nThe file is mounted to the system as an image which contains one obfuscated VBS file\n(SHA1: fd274f57e59c8ae3e69e0a4eb59a06ee8fd74f91) named \"Денсаулық сақтау\nбойынша анықтамалық жəнедеректер базасы.vbs\". The file is a loader that executes an\nobfuscated PS code. After that, the file http://office-cleaner-indexes[.]com/loud.jpg is read.\n\n_Contents of the dropped file SHA1:fd274f57e59c8ae3e69e0a4eb59a06ee8fd74f91_\n\nAs a result, AgentTesla is loaded and executed, which also exfiltrates the data through\nftp.centredebeautenellycettier[.]fr\n\nAnother document (SHA1: c992e0a46185bf0b089b3c4261e4faff15a5bc15) named\n\"Συμφωνία 060520.xls\" was distributed via email in Greek. Its content looks the same as all\nothers in this campaign, but in Greek. Its NanoCore Rat payload connects to screwmalwrhunterteams[.]com.\n\n_Contents of the decoy document \"Συμφωνία 060520.xls\"_\n\n2019 campaign\n\n[Further analysis of the infrastructure related to tetragulf@yahoo[.]com revealed that in 2019](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:tetragulf@yahoo.com)\nonly four domains were registered to this email address, two of which were registered in late\nFebruary and were involved in one campaign distributing malicious documents.\n\n\n-----\n\nList of registered domains (those confirmed as malicious are underlined):\n\neast-ge[.]com\nmariotkitchens[.]com\nsommernph[.]com\nkingtexs-tvv[.]com\n\nThe first files associated with these domains were first uploaded to public sandboxes on\nJune 18, 2019.\n\n_List of malicious files associated with the 2019 campaign according to Group-IB network_\n_graph_\n\nMost of these files are RTF documents that exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, while\nothers are the executable payload. While investigating this campaign, we found emails and\ndecoys in Ukrainian, Russian, Greek, Spanish, and Czech.\n\nInfection\n\nOne of the first documents in this campaign was distributed via email under various names:\n\"CNC 0247.doc\", \"ЧПУ 0247.doc\" (SHA1: 443c079b24d65d7fd74392b90c0eac4aab67060c).\n\n\n-----\n\nContents of the email (SHA1: b6ff3e87ab7d6bd8c7abd3ee30af24b4e3709601)\n\nAccording to our graph, this document connects to http://68.235.38[.]157/ava.hta and\nkingtexs-tvv[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n_Network communication of the file SHA1: 443c079b24d65d7fd74392b90c0eac4aab67060c_\n_(according to Group-IB's network graph data)_\n\nWe found this host interesting and uncovered additional files that established network\nconnections to http://68.235.38[.]157. Some of these files, \"Estos son los documentos\nadjuntos de junio.doc\" (SHA1: 02799b41c97b6205f1999a72cef8b8991d4b8092) and \"New\nOrder.doc\" (SHA1: 25abf0f75c56516134436c1f836d9db1e770ff30), exploit vulnerability\nCVE-2017-11882. At startup, they establish a connection to http://68.235.38[.]157/oyii.hta.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Contents of http://68.235.38[.]157/oyii.hta_\n\nThis file contains a Visual Basic code, which performs a Base64-encoded PowerShell\ncommand to download payload from the public file storage system\nhttps://m.put[.]re/Qm8He5E4.exe (SHA1: 523c5e0a1c9bc6d28f08500e96319571b57e4ba7)\nand stores it to the temp directory under the name \"avantfirewall.exe\".\n\n_Executable PowerShell script_\n\nThe payload reads the content from https://paste[.]ee/r/rSrae, which results in the Async RAT\nbeing executed. The tool connects to the C&C server kizzoyi.duckdns[.]org on port 8808.\nAnother document from this campaign is named \"таблиці.doc\" (SHA11230acfd1f6f5b13a218ff8658a835997d1f0774). It was distributed via emails in Ukrainian.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the document is run, the critical vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 allows malicious code\ncontained in the wd32PrvSE.wmf OLE object to be executed without any user interaction.\n\n_OLE objects contained in SHA1:1230acfd1f6f5b13a218ff8658a835997d1f0774_\n\nAs a result of code execution from OLE objects, the Async RAT is loaded and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecommendations\n\nBelow you will find adversary techniques and defensive measures mapped against MITRE\nATT&CK and MITRE Shield, which we recommend using to prevent similar incidents.\n\nAll mitigation techniques are implemented in Group-IB products to ensure that our clients are\nprotected at all attack stages.
