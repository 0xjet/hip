Diavol is associated with\ndevelopers from the Trickbot Group, who are responsible for the Trickbot Banking Trojan,\"\nthe FBI states in a new [FBI Flash advisory.](http://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220120.pdf)\n\nSince then, the FBI has seen ransom demands ranging between $10,000 and $500,000,\nwith lower payments accepted after ransom negotiations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Warning.txt ransom note from Diavol ransomware**\nThese amounts are in stark contrast to the higher ransoms demanded by other ransomware\noperations linked to TrickBot, such as Conti and Ryuk, who have historically asked for multimillion dollar ransoms.\n\n[For example, in April, the Conti ransomware operation demanded $40 million from Florida's](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-wanted-40-million-in-florida-schools-cyberattack/)\n[Broward County School district and $14 million from chip maker Advantech.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iot-chip-maker-advantech-confirms-ransomware-attack-data-theft/)\n\nThe FBI was likely able to formally link Diavol to the TrickBot Gang after the arrest of Alla\nWitte, a Latvian woman involved in the development of ransomware for the malware gang.\n\n[Vitali Kremez, CEO of AdvIntel, who has been tracking the TrickBot operations, told](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nBleepingComputer that Witte was responsible for the development of the new TrickBotlinked ransomware.\n\n\"Alla Witte played a critical role for the TrickBot operations and based on the previous\nAdvIntel deep adversarial insight she was responsible for the development of the Diavol\nransomware and frontend/backend project meant to support TrickBot operations with the\nspecific tailored ransomware with the bot backconnectivity between TrickBot and Diavol,\"\nKremez told BleepingComputer in a conversation.\n\n\"Another name for the Diavol ransomware was called \"Enigma\" ransomware leveraged by\nthe TrickBot crew before the Diavol re-brand.\"\n\nThe FBI's advisory contains numerous indicators of compromise and mitigations for Diavol,\nmaking it an essential read for all security professionals and Windows/network\nadministrators.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that the Diavol ransomware originally created ransom notes named\n'README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt' as pointed out by the FBI advisory, but BleepingComputer\nhas seen the ransomware gang switch in November to ransom notes named 'Warning.txt.'\n\nThe FBI also urges all victims, regardless of whether they plan to pay a ransom, to promptly\nnotify law enforcement of attacks to collect fresh IOCs that they can use for investigative\npurposes and law enforcement operations.\n\nIf you are affected by a Diavol attack, it is also important to notify the FBI before paying as\nthey \"may be able to provide threat mitigation resources to those impacted by Diavol\nransomware.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[TrickBot cybercrime group linked to new Diavol ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-cybercrime-group-linked-to-new-diavol-ransomware/)\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Anchor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/anchor/)\n[BazarLoader](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bazarloader/)\n[Diavol](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/diavol/)\n[Enigma](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/enigma/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[TrickBot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trickbot/)\n[Wizard Spider](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/wizard-spider/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
