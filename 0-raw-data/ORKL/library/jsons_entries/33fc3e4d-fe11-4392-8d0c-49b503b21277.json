And\nChinese hackers show no signs of letting\nup. \"The attacks coming out of China are\nnot only continuing, they are accelerating,\"\nsays Alan Paller, director of research at\ninformation-security training group SANS\nInstitute in Washington, DC.\nSecret U.S. State Department cables,\n\n\n-----\n\nobtained by WikiLeaks and made available\nto Reuters by a third party, trace systems\nbreaches -- colorfully code-named\n\"Byzantine Hades\" by U.S. investigators -to the Chinese military. An April 2009 cable\neven pinpoints the attacks to a specific unit of\nChina's People's Liberation Army.\n\nPrivately, U.S. officials have long suspected\nthat the Chinese government and in\nparticular the military was behind the cyberattacks. What was never disclosed publicly,\nuntil now, was evidence.\nU.S. efforts to halt Byzantine Hades hacks\nare ongoing, according to four sources\nfamiliar with investigations. In the April 2009\ncable, officials in the State Department's\nCyber Threat Analysis Division noted that\nseveral Chinese-registered Web sites were\n\"involved in Byzantine Hades intrusion\nactivity in 2006.\"\nThe sites were registered in the city of\nChengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province\nin central China, according to the cable. A\nperson named Chen Xingpeng set up the\nsites using the \"precise\" postal code in\nChengdu used by the People's Liberation\nArmy Chengdu Province First Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau (TRB), an electronic\nespionage unit of the Chinese military. \"Much\nof the intrusion activity traced to Chengdu is\nsimilar in tactics, techniques and procedures\nto (Byzantine Hades) activity attributed to\nother\" electronic spying units of the People's\nLiberation Army, the cable says.\n\nReconnaissance bureaus are part of\nthe People's Liberation Army's Third\nDepartment, which oversees China's\nelectronic eavesdropping, according to an\nOctober 2009 report by the U.S.-China\nEconomic and Security Commission, a panel\ncreated by Congress to monitor potential\nnational security issues related to U.SChina relations. Staffed with linguists and\ntechnicians, the Third Department monitors\ncommunications systems in China and\nabroad. At least six Technical Reconnaissance\nBureaus, including the Chengdu unit, \"are\nlikely focused on defense or exploitation of\nforeign networks,\" the commission report\nstates.\nThe precise relationship with the Chinese\nArmy of suspected hacker Chen Xingpeng\ncould not be immediately determined by\nReuters.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\n\ngovernment reports underscore how Chinese\nand other state-sponsored and private\nhackers have overwhelmed U.S. government\ncomputer networks. In the last five years,\ncyber-intrusions reported to the U.S.\nComputer Emergency Response Team, a unit\nof the Department of Homeland Security,\nhave increased more than 650 percent, from\n5,503 incidents in fiscal 2006 to 41,776 four\nyears later, according to a March 16 report by\nthe Government Accountability Office.\n\nTHE BUSINESS OF SPYING\nThe official figures don't account\nfor intrusions into commercial computer\nnetworks, which are part of an expanding\ncyber-espionage campaign attributed to\nChina, according to current and former U.S.\nnational security officials and computersecurity experts.\n\nIn the last two years, dozens of U.S.\ncompanies in the technology, oil and gas and\nfinancial sectors have disclosed that their\ncomputer systems have been infiltrated.\n\nIn January 2010, Internet search giant\nGoogle announced it was the target of a\nsophisticated cyber-attack using malicious\ncode dubbed \"Aurora,\" which compromised\nthe Gmail accounts of human rights activists\nand succeeded in accessing Google source\ncode repositories.\nThe company, and subsequent public\nreports, blamed the attack on the Chinese\ngovernment.\nThe Google attack \"was certainly an\nescalation of Chinese network operations\nagainst the U.S.,\" says Joel Brenner, former\ncounterintelligence chief for the Office\nof the Director of National Intelligence.\n\"Thousands\" of U.S. companies were\ntargeted in the Aurora attacks, Brenner says\n-- far more than the estimated 34 companies\npublicly identified as targets so far -- a scale\nwhich Brenner says demonstrates China's\n\n\nWORRIED: Joel Brenner, former director of the\ncounterintelligence for the Office of the Director of\nNational Intelligence and author of a forthcoming book\non cyber-espionage titled “America the Vulnerable:\nNew Technology and the Next Threat to National\nSecurity,” in his office in Washington, March 22, 2011.\nREUTERS/Hyungwon Kang\n\n\"heavy-handed use of state espionage\nagainst economic targets.\"\n\nMany firms whose business revolves\naround intellectual property -- tech firms,\ndefense group companies, even Formula One\nteams -- complain that their systems are now\nunder constant attack to extract proprietary\ninformation. Several have told Reuters they\nbelieve the attacks come from China.\nSome security officials say firms doing\nbusiness directly with Chinese state-linked\ncompanies -- or which enter fields in which\nthey compete directly -- find themselves\nsuffering a wall of hacking attempts almost\nimmediately.\nThe full scope of commercial computer\n\n\nintrusions is unknown. A study released\nby computer-security firm McAfee and\ngovernment consulting company SAIC on\nMarch 28 shows that more than half of some\n1,000 companies in the United States, Britain\nand other countries decided not to investigate\na computer-security breach because of the\ncost. One in 10 companies will only report a\nsecurity breach when legally obliged to do so,\naccording to the study.\n\"Simply put, corporations cannot afford\nnegative publicity (about computer security\nbreaches),\" says Tom Kellermann, vice\npresident of security awareness at Core\nSecurity Technologies and a contributor to\nthe study.\n\nGONE PHISHING\nWhat is known is the extent to which\nChinese hackers use \"spear-phishing\" as\ntheir preferred tactic to get inside otherwise\nforbidden networks. Compromised email\naccounts are the easiest way to launch spearphish because the hackers can send the\nmessages to entire contact lists.\nThe tactic is so prevalent, and so\nsuccessful, that \"we have given up on the\nidea we can keep our networks pristine,\" says\nStewart Baker, a former senior cyber-security\nofficial at the U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity and National Security Agency. It's\nsafer, government and private experts say,\nto assume the worst -- that any network is\nvulnerable.\nTwo former national security officials\ninvolved in cyber-investigations told Reuters\nthat Chinese intelligence and military units,\nand affiliated private hacker groups, actively\nengage in \"target development\" for spearphish attacks by combing the Internet\nfor details about U.S. government and\ncommercial employees' job descriptions,\nnetworks of associates, and even the way\nthey sign their emails -- such as U.S. military\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBER WARRIORS: A map is displayed on one of the screens at the Air Force Space Command Network\nOperations & Security Center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado July 20, 2010.\nREUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\n\nFind more Reuters special reports at\nour blog The Deep End here:\n**http://link.reuters.com/heq72q**\n\n\npersonnel's use of \"V/R,\" which stands for\n\"Very Respectfully\" or \"Virtual Regards.\"\nThe spear-phish are \"the dominant attack\nvector. They work. They're getting better. It's\njust hard to stop,\" says Gregory J. Rattray,\na partner at cyber-security consulting firm\nDelta Risk and a former director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council.\nSpear-phish are used in most Byzantine\nHades intrusions, according to a review of\nState Department cables by Reuters. But\nByzantine Hades is itself categorized into at\nleast three specific parts known as \"Byzantine\nAnchor,\" \"Byzantine Candor,\" and \"Byzantine\nFoothold.\" A source close to the matter says\nthe sub-codenames refer to intrusions which\nuse common tactics and malicious code to\nextract data.\nA State Department cable made public\nby WikiLeaks last December highlights the\nseverity of the spear-phish problem. \"Since\n2002, (U.S. government) organizations have\nbeen targeted with social-engineering online\nattacks\" which succeeded in \"gaining access\nto hundreds of (U.S. government) and cleared\ndefense contractor systems,\" the cable said.\nThe emails were aimed at the U.S. Army, the\nDepartments of Defense, State and Energy,\nother government entities and commercial\ncompanies.\nOnce inside the computer networks, the\nhackers install keystroke-logging software\nand \"command-and-control\" programs\nwhich allow them to direct the malicious code\nto seek out sensitive information. The cable\nsays that at least some of the attacks in 2008\noriginated from a Shanghai-based hacker\ngroup linked to the People's Liberation\n\n\n###### The spear-phish are \"the dominant attack vector. They work.\n They're getting better. It's just hard to stop.\"\n\nArmy's Third Department, which oversees\nintelligence-gathering from electronic\ncommunications.\nBetween April and October 2008, hackers\nsuccessfully stole \"50 megabytes of email\nmessages and attached documents, as\nwell as a complete list of usernames and\npasswords from an unspecified (U.S.\ngovernment) agency,\" the cable says.\n\nInvestigators say Byzantine Hades\nintrusions are part of a particularly virulent\nform of cyber-espionage known as an\n\"advanced persistent threat.\" The malicious\ncode embedded in attachments to spearphish emails is often \"polymorphic\" -- it\nchanges form every time it runs -- and\nburrows deep into computer networks\nto avoid discovery. Hackers also conduct\n\"quality-assurance\" tests in advance of\nlaunching attacks to minimize the number\nof anti-virus programs which can detect it,\nexperts say.\nAs a result, cyber-security analysts say\nadvanced persistent threats are often only\nidentified after they penetrate computer\nnetworks and begin to send stolen data to\nthe computer responsible for managing\nthe attack. \"You have to look for the 'phone\n\n\nhome,'\" says Roger Nebel, managing director\nfor cyber-security at Defense Group Inc., a\nconsulting firm in Washington, DC.\n\nIt was evidence of malicious code phoning\nhome to a control server -- a computer that\nsupervises the actions of code inside other\ncomputers -- that provided confirmation to\nU.S. cyber-sleuths that Chinese hackers were\nbehind Byzantine Hades attacks, according\nto the April 2009 State Department cable.\nAs a case study, the cable cites a 10-month\ninvestigation by a group of computer experts\nat the University of Toronto which focused\nin part on cyber-intrusions aimed at Tibetan\ngroups, including the office of the exiled\nDalai Lama in Dharamsala, India.\n\nReferencing the Canadian research, the\ncable notes that infected computers in the\nDalai Lama's office communicated with\ncontrol servers previously used to attack\nTibetan targets during the 2008 Olympics\nin Beijing. Two Web sites linked to the attack\nalso communicated with the control server.\n\nTARGETS DETAILED\nThe same sites had also been involved in\nByzantine Hades attacks on U.S. government\ncomputers in 2006, according to \"sensitive\nreports\" cited in the cable -- likely a\neuphemistic reference to secret intelligence\nreporting.\nThe computer-snooping code that the\nintrusion unleashed was known as the\nGh0stNet Remote Access Tool (RAT). It \"can\ncapture keystrokes, take screen shots, install\nand change files, as well as record sound with\na connected microphone and video with a\nconnected webcam,\" according to the cable.\nGh0st RAT succeeded in invading at least\none State Department computer. It \"has\nbeen identified in incidents -- believed to\nbe the work of (Byzantine Hades) actors -affecting a locally employed staff member at\nthe U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Japan,\" according\nto the cable.\n\nEvidence that data was being sucked\nout of a target network by malicious code\nalso appears to have led cyber-security\ninvestigators to a specific hacker, affiliated\nwith the Chinese government, who was\nconducting cyber-espionage in the United\nStates.

The cable says that Peng was\nbelieved to be the leader of a band of Chinese\nhackers who call themselves \"Javaphile.\"\n\nPeng did not respond to three emails\nseeking comment\n\n\nThe details of alleged Chinese militarybacked intrusions of U.S. government\ncomputers are discussed in a half dozen\nState Department cables recounting intense\nglobal concern about China's aggressive use\n\n\nTESTING THE WATERS\nThe leaked State Department cables\nhave surfaced as Reuters has learned that\nthe U.S. is engaged in quiet, proxy-led talks\nwith China over cyber issues.\nChronic computer breaches have become\na major source of tension in U S relations\n\n\n-----\n\nwith China, which intensified after the major\nGoogle hack was disclosed in January 2010,\naccording to U.S. officials involved in the\ntalks. Even before the Google hack, Chinese\nofficials had recognized the problem as well.\n\nIn mid-2009, representatives of the China\nInstitutes for Contemporary International\nRelations, a nominally-independent research\ngroup affiliated with China's Ministry of\nState Security, contacted James A. Lewis, a\nformer U.S. diplomat now with the Center for\nStrategic and International Studies.\nLewis said that in his first meeting with\nhis Chinese counterparts, a representative\nof the China Institutes asked: \"Why does the\nWestern press always blame China (for cyberattacks)?\" Lewis says he replied: \"Because\nit's true.\"\nThere was no response to request for\ncomment on the talks from the Chinese\nembassy in Washington.\n\nPreliminary meetings at CSIS have\nblossomed into three formal meetings in\nWashington and Beijing over the last 14\nmonths. According to two participants,\nthe talks continue to be marked by \"a lot\nof suspicion.\" Attendees have focused on\nestablishing a common understanding of\ncyber-related military, law enforcement\nand trade issues. Cyber-espionage isn't\n\n\nbeing discussed directly, according to one\nparticipant, because \"the Chinese go rigid\"\nwhen the subject is raised.\nOne reason: for China, digital espionage\nis wrapped into larger concerns about\nhow to keep China's economy, the world's\nsecond largest, growing. \"They've identified\ninnovation as crucial to future economic\ngrowth -- but they're not sure they can do\nit,\" says Lewis. \"The easiest way to innovate\nis to plagiarize\" by stealing U.S. intellectual\nproperty, he adds.\nThere have been a few breakthroughs.\nU.S. and Chinese government officials from\nlaw enforcement, intelligence, military and\ndiplomatic agencies have attended in the\nwings of each discussion. \"The goal has been\nto get both sides on the same page,\" says\nLewis. \"We're building the groundwork for\nofficial discussions.\"\nA former senior national security official\nwho has also attended the talks says, \"Our\nreports go straight to the top policymakers\"\nin the Obama administration.\nChinese participants have sought to allay\nU.S. concerns about a Chinese cyber-attack on\nthe U.S. financial system. With China owning\nmore than $1.1 trillion in U.S. government\ndebt, Lewis says China's representatives\nacknowledged destabilization of U.S.\n\n\nmarkets would, in effect, be an attack on\nChina's economy, itself.\n\nDespite the talks, suspected Chinese cyberespionage has hardly tapered off. Documents\nreviewed by Reuters show that CSIS itself\nrecently was the target of a spear-phish\ncontaining malicious code with a suspected\nlink to China.\nOn March 1, an email sent from an address\non an unofficial U.S. Armed Forces family\nwelfare network called AFGIMail was sent\nto Andrew Schwartz, chief spokesman for\nCSIS. Attached to the message was an Excel\nspreadsheet labeled \"Titan Global Invitation\nList.\"\nAn analysis conducted for Reuters by a\ncyber-security expert who asked not to be\nidentified shows the email may have been\nsent from a compromised AFGIMail email\nserver. The Excel spreadsheet, if opened,\ninstalls malicious code which searches\nfor documents on the victim's computer.\nThe code then communicates to a Website hosting company in Orange County,\nCalifornia that has additional sites in China.\n\n(Reporting by Brian Grow in Atlanta and\nMark Hosenball in Washington; additional\nreporting by Peter Apps in London; editing\nby Jim Impoco and Claudia Parsons)\n\n\nCHINESE GUARDS: Honour guards stand in a line before an official welcoming ceremony\ninside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, February 25, 2010.
