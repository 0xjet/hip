Three DMI spokespersons did not answer phone calls from ZDNet seeking comment for this article.\n\nThe thing that appears to be clear is that they got their hands on NASA-related files, suggesting they breached DMI's NASA-related\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\no suppo t t e c a s, t e opp e ay e ope ato s posted 0 a c e es o a da eb po ta t e g oup s ope at g\n\n\ndmi-nasa.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nThe archives include everything from HR documents to project plans, as can be seen from a screenshot ZDNet took of one of the files.\nEmployee details included in these files matched public LinkedIn records.\n\n\n-----\n\ndmi forms wfh.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nFurthermore, the DopplePaymer gang also posted a list of 2,583 servers and workstations that hackers claim are part of DMI's internal\nnetwork, and which they have encrypted and are now holding for ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\ndmi machine list.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nThe purpose of releasing all these files is for extortion. The DopplePaymer ransomware crew is one of several ransomware gangs that operate\n\"leak sites\" where they publish data from hacked companies.\n\nDopplePaymer operators first share small samples like the one they shared today, and in case the victim isn't intimidated and still refuses to\npay the file decryption fee, they leak all files as revenge.\n\nSuch extortion tactics have been employed since December 2019, and today, they also saw a major change when the operators of the REvil\n[(Sodinokibi) ransomware gang added a kink in this tactic by launching an eBay-like auction site where they're selling the stolen victim data](https://www.zdnet.com/article/revil-ransomware-gang-launches-auction-site-to-sell-stolen-data/)\ninstead of giving it away for free.\n\n\n-----",
