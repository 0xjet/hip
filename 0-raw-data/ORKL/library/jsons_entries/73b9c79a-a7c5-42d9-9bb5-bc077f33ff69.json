Turkey carried out an agreement with Libya which tries to carry out an\nexpansion of its exclusive maritime economic zones ([2]).\n\nIt is relevant to clarify that an EEZ is a maritime zone prescribed by the United Nations\nConvention on the law of the sea over which a state has special rights regarding the\nexploration and exploitation of sea resources, including the production of energy through the\nwater and wind ([3]) ([17]):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Illustration 1. Expansion of Turkish EEZ_\n\nThe expansion that the Turkish government tries to carry out could increase the geopolitical\nrisk among Cypriots, Greeks and even Israeli governments. The military presence in the area\nby those States could be seen in the map shown above. The strategy of increasing Turkey’s\nEEZ would leave without an important part of the continental shelf Athens ([4]). In addition,\nCyprus is significantly affected by this EEZ’s expansion as there is an occupation of the\nCyprus’ EEZ area. Furthermore, the President Erdogan has publicly declared that his oil\nexploration projects in the coast of Cyprus will not cease. Turkey tries to stablish a zone of\nEEZ controlled by the Turkish influence which would be represented as in the following map\n([5]):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Illustration 2._\n\n_Expansion of the Turkish EEZ and location of energy resources_\n\nIn the previous map, you can see which energy exploration areas are located in Israel,\nCyprus and Egypt. Moreover, these States give diplomatic support to Cyprus and Greece\nregarding the expansion’s conflict of the Turkish EEZ.\n\n\nFurthermore, the 27 of February of 2020, Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed an agreementth\nto build up a gas pipeline to transport gas to Europe from the Leviathan gas reserves located\nin Israel. Moreover, in the near future there is the intention of joining to the pipeline the\nextractions from the Cypriot gas reserves, Aphrodite and Calypso ([6]).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Illustration 3. Mediterranean Gas_\n\n_Pipeline_\n\nTurkey has displaced several warships to the coast of Cyprus in order to carry out gas\nexploration projects. The Eastern European gas pipeline reduces the geopolitical power of\nTurkey as it tries to exclude Turkey from any participation in it. This “pipeline” has been\ncalled “EastMed” ([6]). However, during March, Turkey will put an offshore drilling vessel in\norder to continue with its oil exploration projects in the EEZ waters of Greece, Cyprus and\nthe EU in order to try to acquire in the future the role of gas supplier for the EU ([8]).\n\nInterests and influence of China in the Mediterranean area:\n\nChina, unlike the US diplomatic-military expansionism, has focused its expansionist strategy\non the diplomatic-commercial strategy. For China, one of its geo-strategically key regions,\nhas been the Port of Piraeus of Greece. The Greek government tendered for the next 35\nyears the 67% of the Port’s operations to COSCO (China Ocean Shipping Company) for\n368.5 million and 350 million of euros to be invested in the Piraeus’ port infrastructure ([9]).\n\nThe Port of Piraeus represents a potential gate of all the commercial flow that comes from\nthe OBOR sea route. In addition, during November of 2019, China and Greece signed up 16\ncooperation agreements of different matters, including trade and energy investments ([10]).\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, Cyprus signed an agreement with a consortium led by China to build up\nthe first natural gas import terminal in Cyprus. The terminal is designed to convert imported\nliquefied gas into a gaseous form to be used in energy plants ([11]). The construction is\nbeing developed by China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering, Metron, Hudong-Zhngua\nShipbuilding and Wilhelmsen Ship Management. Construction is expected to be done in\n2022.\n\nRegarding the international security, China investigates Turkey’s relation with the Uighur\ncommunity. The Uyghurs are Turkish-speaking people from the interior of Asia and mostly of\nthem have Muslim religious confession. The Uyghurs live in northwestern China, in the\nUyghur autonomous region of Xinjiang and are considered a threat to the People’s Republic\nof China as they are considered largely jihadist terrorists ([12]).\n\nTurkey is the country that has given the most international support to the Uyghur community.\nCurrently, up to 45,000 Uyghur refugees live in Turkey on a temporary visa or even with a\npermanent residence permit ([13]).\n\nTurkey’s foreign affairs policies are misaligned from those of China. The possible obstruction\nof the OBOR route to the Port of Piraeus and the collaborative policies with the Uyghur\ncommunity in the Xinjiang region of China could damage their diplomatic relations.\n\nDue to the diplomatic confrontations and conflicting interests of the two countries, China\ncould carry out cyber espionage operations against Turkish organizations and institutions\nlinked to diplomacy, defense, energy, telecommunications and foreign trade. Its main\nobjective could be to collect confidential information in order to gain advantages within the\nfuture geostrategic movements of Turkey and the rest of the actors involved in the conflicts\nover the energy resources located in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nMalicious campaign against Turkish organizations:\n\nA malicious campaign allegedly attributed to APT10 against Turkish organizations from\nvarious sectors such as telecommunications and finance has been identified by Adeo in\nJanuary of 2020 ([14]). APT10 is a group presumably attributed to the Ministry of State\nSecurity of China ([15]). In addition, it is a group that usually targets organizations from\nvarious sectors such as defense, energy, health, telecommunications, governments, military,\nshipping and IT ([16]).\n\nIt has been identified that APT10 usually carries out malicious campaigns against\norganizations that could damage the China’s State interests into the global market. On the\nother hand, it has also been detected that APT10 usually carries out malicious campaigns\nagainst organizations that support foundations which carry out aid projects with ethnic\ngroups that may be a potential threat against the Chinese national security, as the case of\nthe Uyghur community.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, in this campaign has been identified several similarities with the TTP published in\nother APT10 reports in 2019 ([14]). In this case, it was identified that this campaign began in\n2016 and the initial access was carried out with the exploitation of a public web application.\n\nSummary of the executed Kill Chain ([14]):\n\n- Initial access:\n\nThe attackers deployed the following China Chopper4, JspSpy5 webshells to obtain a\nfoothold on the victim’s network that they used to execute commands to upload files to the\ntarget machines.\n\n- Reconnaissance, execution and theft of credentials:\n\nIn the reconnaissance phase, a series of commands were launched to collect information\nfrom users, domains and shared folders. The hostile actor used legitimate tools of the\nWindows operating systems for the reconnaissance stage, such as “ipconfig.exe”,\n“whoami.exe”, “net.exe”, “ping.exe”, “powershell.exe” and ” BloodHound ”(bloodHound is not\na legitimate binary from Microsoft). The attacker used an advanced tool called “dns.exe” to\nlist all the machines that were registered in a particular domain.\n\nRegarding the execution, the hostile actor implemented “hTran” backdoor to be able to\nexfiltrate information. In previous malicious APT10 campaigns against Turkey, this\nexecutable file was seen with the name “java.exe” on compromised hosts.\n\nHostile actors loaded a malicious DLL into the memory of a legitimate binary. The final\npayload is injected into the legitimate process “svchost.exe”. It was identified that this\npayload was a PlugX variant or a CobaltStrike Beacon as a post-exploitation framework.\n\nTo carry out the theft of credentials the hostile actor used the following tools:\n“QuarksPWdump” and “Mimikatz”.\n\n- Lateral movements\n\nThrough the lateral movements they were able to compromise critical servers and gain\naccess as a domain administrator. The group used NTLM hashes to move laterally. They\nused the tools “net.exe”, “wmic.exe”, “psexec.exe”, “smbexec”, and “wmiexec”.\n\n- Persistence\n\nThe advanced group established persistence in certain servers that were of their interest and\ndeployed a remote access Trojans such as “QuasarRAT” and “PlugX”, moreover penetration\nor “pentesting” tools such as “Cobalt Strike” and “kerberos”.\n\n- C&C connections\n\n\n-----\n\nHostile actors used two different ways to keep connections with C&C servers. Once the\nvulnerability was exploited to establish itself on the public server, the group moved to the\n“terminal server”. To establish communications with the other hosts in the internal network,\nthey installed an SMB beacon on the “terminal server”, using it as a bridge between the\ninternal network and the C&C server.\n\n_Illustration 4. First C&C communication_\n\n_method_\nHowever, the group established a different method for hosts that had direct access or had a\nproxy. In this case they used the http protocol to establish the communications with the C&C.\n\n_Illustration 5. Second C&C communication_\n\n_method_\nIn the following chart, there are the TTPs developed by APT10 during this malicious\ncampaign against the Turkish organizations ([16]) ([14]):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Illustration 6. TTP used in the APT10 campaign_\nRecommendations:\n\nIt is recommendable that the organizations from the defense sector, governments, energy,\ntelecommunications and finance linked to projects that may affect the interests of China\napply the maximum prevention to this increase of malicious campaigns from APT groups\npresumably linked to China.\n\nIt is recommended to apply the IOC of the APT identified as a threat by their intelligence\nprovider LAB52 as soon as possible.\n\nIt is recommended to keep the operating systems, services and tools used in the\norganization updated with the latest security patches.\n\nIt is recommended to establish security policies (GPOs) to control accesses and actions\ncarried out in those systems and / or services that are exposed to the internet.\n\nConclusions:\n\nSince the last decade, Turkey has acquired an important influence in the energy geopolitics\nof the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The Turkish foreign policies has hindered the China’s\ninternational trade strategies. Furthermore, the diplomatic Turkish support to certain Chinese\nethnic groups that are considerate as a threat against the Chinese national security could\n\n\n-----\n\nprovoke that Turkey becomes a target of groups like APT10 which presumably are linked to\nthe Ministry of State Security of China. APT10 is a group that has a wide range of targets.\nThe organizations from sectors of interest for the government of China and the organizations\nthat have some kind of link with the commercial development of the OBOR route could be\nsusceptible to being targeted by groups such as APT10.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] [https://www.mei.edu/publications/turkeys-eastern-mediterranean-quagmire](https://www.mei.edu/publications/turkeys-eastern-mediterranean-quagmire)\n\n[2] [https://www.petroleum-economist.com/](https://www.petroleum-economist.com/)\n\n[3] https://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/10/12/greece-egypt-aim-to-strangulate-turkey-ineast-med-turkish-daily-claims/\n\n[4] https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2019/12/20/the-exclusive-economic-zone-between-libya-andturkey/\n\n[5] https://www.ozelburoistihbarat.com/kitalar-bolgeler-akdeniz-karadeniz-egemarmara/dogu-akdenizde-tartisma-harita-uydu-goruntuleri-eren-talha-altun-12708\n\n[6] Kontakos P.
