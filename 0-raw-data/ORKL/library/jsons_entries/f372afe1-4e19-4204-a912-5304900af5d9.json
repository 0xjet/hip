    "plain_text": "# Global Trickbot disruption operation shows promise\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/global-trickbot-disruption-operation-shows-promise](https://intel471.com/blog/global-trickbot-disruption-operation-shows-promise)**\n\nOct 20, 2020\n\nThe following is an update on the status of Trickbot at noon GMT, Oct. 20, 2020.\n\nOn Oct. 19, 2020, Emotet was used to distribute Trickbot. This is the most recent Trickbot\nsample Intel 471 has observed. The following is a list of control servers included as part of\nthis Trickbot sample’s configuration:\n\n\n**Control Server IP**\n**Address**\n\n\n**City** **Country** **Organization**\n\n\n131.153.22.145 Amsterdam Netherlands AS60558 PHOENIX NAP\nLLC.\n\n\n185.99.2.123 Sarajevo Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\n\n185.99.2.160 Sarajevo Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\n\n\nAS200698 Globalhost\nd.o.o.\n\nAS200698 Globalhost\nd.o.o.\n\n\n194.5.249.216 Bucharest Romania AS64398 NXTSERVERS\nSRL\n\n199.38.120.91 Georgetown United States AS35862 JCWIFI.COM\n\n199.38.121.150 Freeport United States AS35862 JCWIFI.COM\n\n199.38.123.58 Georgetown United States AS35862 JCWIFI.COM\n\n208.86.161.113 Milledgeville United States AS35862 JCWIFI.COM\n\n208.86.162.215 Coleta United States AS35862 JCWIFI.COM\n\n208.86.162.241 Thomson United States AS35862 JCWIFI.COM\n\n45.89.127.118 Berlin Germany AS30823 combahton\nGmbH\n\n45.89.127.119 Berlin Germany AS30823 combahton\nGmbH\n\n62.108.35.29 Solingen Germany AS30962 comtrance GmbH\n\n62.108.35.36 Heidelberg Germany AS30962 comtrance GmbH\n\n\n-----\n\n80.85.156.116 Ashgabat Turkmenistan AS44493 ChelyabinskSignal LLC\n\n86.104.194.102 Bucharest Romania AS48874 HOSTMAZE INC\nSRL-D\n\nOn Oct. 19, 2020, when this latest Trickbot sample was distributed, none of the above listed\ncontrol servers were able to respond to Trickbot bot requests, a state that continued at the\ntime of this report. Intel 471 believes disruption operations against Trickbot are currently\nglobal in nature and have had success against Trickbot infrastructure. Regardless, there still\nis a small number of working controllers based in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and\nKyrgyzstan that still are able to respond to Trickbot bot requests. This small number of\nworking control servers was not listed in the most recent distributed Trickbot sample.\n\n\n-----",
