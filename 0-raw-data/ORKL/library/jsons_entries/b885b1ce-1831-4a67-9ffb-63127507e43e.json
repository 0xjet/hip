An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor is responsible for\ncompromising the SolarWinds Orion software supply chain, as well as widespread abuse of\ncommonly used authentication mechanisms. This threat actor has the resources, patience,\nand expertise to gain access to and privileges over highly sensitive information if left\nunchecked. CISA urges organizations to prioritize measures to identify and address this\nthreat.\n\nPursuant to Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 41, CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have formed a Cyber\nUnified Coordination Group (UCG) to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this\nsignificant cyber incident.\n\nCISA also remains in regular contact with public and private sector stakeholders and\ninternational partners, providing technical assistance upon request, and making information\nand resources available to help those affected to recover quickly from incidents related to\nthis campaign.\n\nCISA encourages individuals and organizations to refer to the resources below for additional\ninformation on this compromise. These resources provide information to help organizations\ndetect and prevent this activity.\n\n[CISA released the CISA Hunt and Incident Response Program (CHIRP), a forensics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGYSNiNOpds)\n[collection capability outlined in Activity Alert AA21-077A and available on CISA’s CHIRP](https://us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-077a)\nGitHub repository. This capability was developed to assist network defenders with detecting\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) activity related to the SolarWinds and Active\nDirectory/M365 compromise. The initial release of CHIRP scans for signs of APT\ncompromise within an on-premises environment to detect indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n[associated with CISA Alerts AA20-352A and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a) [AA21-008A.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\n\n\n-----\n\nA [demonstration video is available on CISAs YouTube channel to help agencies and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGYSNiNOpds)\norganizations understand how to use CHIRP.\n\n## Emergency Directive and Updates\n\n[CISA Updates Supplemental Guidance on Emergency Directive 21-01](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-21-01)\n\nOn January 6, 2021, CISA released supplemental guidance v3 that requires (1)\nagencies that ran affected versions conduct forensic analysis, (2) agencies that\naccept the risk of running SolarWinds Orion comply with certain hardening\nrequirements, and (3) reporting by agency from department-level Chief\nInformation Officers (CIOs) by Tuesday, January 19, and Monday, January 25,\n2020.\n[CISA Updates Supplemental Guidance on Emergency Directive 21-01](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-21-01)\n\nOn December 30, 2020, CISA released guidance to supplement the Emergency\nDirective (ED) 21-01 and Supplemental Guidance v1 issued on December 18,\n2020. Specifically, all federal agencies operating versions of the SolarWinds\nOrion platform other than those identified as “affected versions” are required to\nuse at least SolarWinds Orion Platform version 2020.2.1HF2.\n[CISA Supplemental Guidance on Emergency Directive 21-01](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-21-01)\n\nOn December 18, 2020, CISA’s supplemental release provides additional\nguidance on the implementation of ED 21-01, to include an update on affected\nversions, guidance for agencies using third-party service providers, and additional\nclarity on required actions.\n[CISA Emergency Directive 21-01](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-21-01)\n\nOn December 13, 2020 CISA determined that this exploitation of SolarWinds\nproducts poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch\nagencies and requires emergency action. Multiple versions of SolarWinds Orion\nare currently being exploited by malicious actors. This tactic permits an attacker\nto gain access to network traffic management systems. Disconnecting affected\ndevices, as described in Required Action 2 of the ED, is the only known mitigation\nmeasure currently available.\n\n## Press Releases\n\nJoint Statement by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and\n[Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/01/05/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure)\n(ODNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)\n\nOn behalf of President Trump, the National Security Council staff has stood up a\ntask force construct known as the Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG),\ncomposed of the FBI, CISA, and ODNI with support from NSA, to coordinate the\ninvestigation and remediation of this significant cyber incident involving federal\ngovernment networks. The UCG is still working to understand the scope of the\nincident but has the following updates on its investigative and mitigation efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\nJoint Statement by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and\n[Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Office of the Director of National](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/16/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure)\nIntelligence (ODNI)\n\nThis Joint Statement announces establishment of a Cyber Unified Coordination\nGroup (UCG). Pursuant to Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 41, FBI, CISA, and\nODNI have formed a UCG to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this\nsignificant cyber incident. The UCG is intended to unify the individual efforts of\nthese agencies as they focus on their separate responsibilities.\nCISA Press Release: CISA Issues Emergency Directive to Mitigate the Compromise of\nSolarWinds Orion Network Management Products\n\nThis press release announces the CISA Emergency Directive 21-01 in response\nto the known compromise involving SolarWinds Orion products. The ED calls on\nfederal civilian agencies to review their networks for IOCs and disconnect or\npower down SolarWinds Orion Products immediately. This is the fifth Emergency\nDirective issued by CISA under the authorities granted by Congress in the\nCybersecurity Act of 2015.\n\n## Alerts and Guidance\n\nCISA, alongside the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre, FBI and NSA\n[published an advisory to provide further details of tactics, techniques and procedures](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)\n(TTPs) associated with SVR cyber actors.
