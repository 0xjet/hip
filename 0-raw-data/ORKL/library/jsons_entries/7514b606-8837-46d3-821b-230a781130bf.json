A\ncampaign spotted recently impersonates the SafeMoon cryptocurrency app and uses a fake update to lure\nDiscord users to a website that distributes a well-known remote access tool (RAT).\n\n\n-----\n\nSafeMoon is one of the latest altcoins to, well, shoot for the moon. Ever since its inception six months ago,\n[SafeMoon has been highly popular (and duly volatile), with the craze propelled by influencers and](https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1394379356487757834)\nnumerous enthusiasts on social media. The buzz hasn’t escaped the notice of scammers, as swindles\n[targeting cryptocurrency users – including fraud that namedrops celebrities to give it some extra allure –](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/04/26/4-common-ways-scammers-use-celebrities-lure-victims/)\nhave been running rampant for years.\n\n## Houston, we have a problem\n\nThe ruse exploiting SafeMoon’s sudden popularity begins with a message (Figure 1) that scammers have\n[sent to a number of users on Discord. Posing as the official SafeMoon account, the fraudsters promote a](https://discord.gg/safemoon)\nnew version of the app.\n\n_Figure 1. The message impersonating SafeMoon_\n\nIf you were to click on the URL in the message, you would land on a website (Figure 2) that is apparently\ndesigned to look the part of SafeMoon’s official site – its old version, to be exact. First reported by a Reddit\nuser in August 2021, the domain name also mimics its legitimate counterpart, except that it adds an extra\nletter at the end in the hopes that the difference will go unnoticed by most people in their haste to obtain\nthe required “update”. As of the time of writing, the malicious site is still up and running.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The fake (L) versus the legitimate (R) SafeMoon website, August 2021 (source: web.archive.org)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The official SafeMoon website, early October 2021_\n\nAll external links on the site are legitimate, except for the arguably most important one – the link that\nprompts you to download the “official” SafeMoon app from the Google Play Store. Instead of the\nSafeMoon app for Android devices, it downloads a payload that includes rather common, off-the-shelf\nWindows software that can be used both for legitimate and nefarious ends.\n\n_Figure 4. The development section of the obfuscated malicious app_\n\nUpon execution, the installer (Safemoon-App-v2.0.6.exe) will drop several files on the system, including a\nRAT called Remcos. While touted as a legitimate tool, this RAT is also being peddled for sale in\n[underground forums, which also earned it an official alert from US authorities shortly after the tool was](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-center/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/remcos)\nreleased. If used for evil ends, a RAT is often understood to stand for a “remote access trojan” instead.\n\nRemcos has since been deployed in a number of campaigns, both by cybercrime and cyberespionage\ngroups. Indeed, just a few months ago ESET researchers spotted Remcos in what they nicknamed\n[“Operation Spalax”, where threat actors took aim at a slew of organizations in Colombia.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/12/operation-spalax-targeted-malware-attacks-colombia/)\n\nAs is customary with RATs, Remcos gives the attacker a backdoor into the victim’s computer and is used\nto gather sensitive data from the victim. It is operated via a command and control (C&C) server whose IP\naddress is injected into the downloaded files. Remcos’s capabilities include theft of login credentials from\nvarious web browsers, logging keystrokes, hijacking the webcam, capturing audio from the victim’s\nmicrophone, downloading and executing additional malware on the machine … the whole nine yards,\nreally.\n\nA cursory look at the RAT’s configuration file (Figure 5) provides an idea of its extensive functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Part of the Remcos configuration file binary showing some of what the RAT is after_\n\n## Strap yourself in\n\nA few basic precautions will go a long way towards staying safe from these scams:\n\nBe wary of any out-of-the-blue communications, be it via email, social media, texts or other channels\nDon’t click on links in such messages, especially when they come from an unverified source\nBe alert to irregularities in URLs – you’re better off typing it in yourself\nUse [strong and unique passwords or passphrases and, wherever available, two-factor authentication](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/05/05/forget-about-passwords-you-need-a-passphrase/)\n(2FA)\nUse comprehensive security software\n\nWhen it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, you need to proceed with caution, and not just because\nthe market is rife with investment fraud, fake giveaways and other scams. But surely you know the drill by\nnow.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n**SHA-256 hash**\n\n\n**ESET detection**\n**name**\n\n\n035041983ADCFB47BBA63E81D2B98FA928FB7E022F51ED4A897366542D784E5B A Variant of\nMSIL/Injector.VQB\n\nThe files downloaded later as part of the Remcos “package” are detected by ESET products as\nWin32/Rescoms.B.\n\n6 Oct 2021 - 11:30AM\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
