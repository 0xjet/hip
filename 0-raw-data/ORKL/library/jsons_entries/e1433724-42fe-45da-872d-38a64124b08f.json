In late December\n2009 a new crimeware toolkit emanating from Russia—known as SpyEye V1.0—started to\nappear for sale on Russian underground forums. Retailing at $500, it is looking to take a\nchunk of the Zeus crimeware toolkit market. Symantec detects this threat as\n[Trojan.Spyeye. Since it is relatively new, we are not seeing a lot of SpyEye activity yet.](http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-020216-0135-99)\nHowever, given some time and the observed rate of development for this crimeware\ntoolkit, SpyEye could be a future contender for king of the crimeware toolkits.\n\nSpyEyeLogo.JPG\n\nThe SpyEye toolkit is similar to Zeus in a lot of ways. It contains a builder module for\ncreating the Trojan bot executable with config file and a Web control panel for command\nand control (C&C) of a bot net. Some of the advertised features online are:\n\n-  Formgrabber (Keylogger)\n\n-  Autofill credit card modules\n\n-  Daily email backup\n\n-  Encrypted config file\n\n\n-----\n\n-  Ftp protocol grabber\n\n-  Pop3 grabber\n\n-  Http basic access authorization grabber\n\n-  Zeus killer\n\nNew revisions of SpyEye, with additional features, are being released on a regular basis.\nThe latest version (V1.0.7) contains an interesting new feature called “Kill Zeus” that we\nhave yet to substantiate. SpyEye hooks the same Wininet API (Wininet.dll)\nHttpSendRequestA as used by Zeus for communications. If a compromised system\ninfected with SpyEye was also infected with Zeus, this in turn would allow SpyEye to grab\nand report on http requests sent to the Zeus C&C server.\n\nZeusCommReport.JPG\n\n### An example of Zeus C&C server report taken from underground forum\n\nThe new Kill Zeus feature is optional during the Trojan build process, but it supposedly\ngoes as far as allowing you to delete Zeus from an infected system—meaning only\nSpyEye should remain running on the compromised system. If the use of SpyEye takes\noff, it could dent Zeus bot herds and lead to retaliation from the creators of the Zeus\ncrimeware toolkit. This, in turn, could lead to another bot war such as we have seen in the\npast with Beagle, Netsky, and Mydoom.\n\nSpyEyeBuilder.JPG\n\n### An example of the SpyEye Trojan builder control panel\n\nAnother feature of SpyEye is the ability to load additional threats onto infected SpyEye\nsystems, by country, using the SpyEye control panel GUI as shown below:\n\nSpyEyeCountryPanel.JPG\n\nSymantec will continue to monitor the progression of this toolkit and update detection as\nnecessary. Remember to keep your definitions up to date to ensure you have the best\nprotection against new threats.\n\n_Special thanks to Mario Ballano Barcena for his analysis._\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
