    "plain_text": "# Treasury Sanctions Iranian Entities for Attempted Election Interference\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1158**\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\n**WASHINGTON - Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control**\n(OFAC) designated five Iranian entities for attempting to influence elections in the United\nStates. The Iranian regime has targeted the United States’ electoral process with brazen\nattempts to sow discord among the voting populace by spreading disinformation online and\nexecuting malign influence operations aimed at misleading U.S. voters. Components of the\nGovernment of Iran, disguised as news organizations or media outlets, have targeted the\nUnited States in order to subvert U.S. democratic processes.\n\n“The Iranian regime uses false narratives and other misleading content to attempt to\ninfluence U.S. elections,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “This Administration is\ncommitted to ensuring the integrity of the U.S. election system and will continue to counter\nefforts from any foreign actor that threatens our electoral processes.”\n\nTreasury designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC-Qods Force\n(IRGC-QF), and Bayan Rasaneh Gostar Institute (Bayan Gostar) pursuant to Executive\nOrder (E.O.) 13848 for having directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed, or\notherwise been complicit in foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The\nIranian Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU) and International Union of Virtual Media\n\n\n-----\n\n(IUVM) were designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for being owned or controlled by the IRGCQF. The IRGC, including the IRGC-QF, has been designated under multiple authorities since\n2007.\n\nThe Iranian regime’s disinformation efforts have targeted a global audience through a variety\nof covert media organizations. Disinformation campaigns run by the Iranian regime focus on\nsowing discord among readers via social media platforms and messaging applications, and\nfrequently involve mischaracterizing information.\n\nSince at least 2015, Bayan Gostar has served as a front company for IRGC-QF propaganda\nefforts. In the months leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Bayan Gostar\npersonnel have planned to influence the election by exploiting social issues within the United\nStates, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and denigrating U.S. political figures. As recently\nas summer 2020, Bayan Gostar was prepared to execute a series of influence operations\ndirected at the U.S. populace ahead of the presidential election.\n\nIRTVU, a propaganda arm of the IRGC-QF, and IUVM aided Bayan Gostar in efforts to reach\nU.S. audiences. In addition, IRGC-QF outlets amplified false narratives in English, and\nposted disparaging propaganda articles and other U.S.-oriented content with the intent to\nsow discord among U.S. audiences. IUVM also posted conspiracy theories and\ndisinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Treasury Department encourages the American people to confirm information received\nvia social media intelligently by going to multiple trusted sources for news and information,\nparticularly when the source or suspected source of the information is from outside the\nUnited States. More guidance specific to the U.S. 2020 election and disinformation\n[campaigns can be found here: https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol](https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of today s designations, all property and interests in property of the persons\ndesignated today subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S persons are generally\nprohibited from engaging in transactions with them. In addition, foreign financial institutions\nthat knowingly facilitate significant transactions for, or persons that provide material or certain\nother support to, the persons designated today risk exposure to sanctions that could sever\ntheir access to the U.S. financial system or block their property and interests in property\nunder U.S. jurisdiction. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or more owned by one or more\ndesignated persons are also blocked.\n\n[View identifying information on the entities designated today.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201022)\n\n###\n\nUse featured image\n\nOff\n\n\n-----",
