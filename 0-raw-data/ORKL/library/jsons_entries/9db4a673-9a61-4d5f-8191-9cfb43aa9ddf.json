FLD shared the\n[data they collected with the Citizen Lab and](https://citizenlab.ca/) [Amnesty International’s Security Lab for](https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/)\nseparate independent peer review of their initial findings. FLD’s [analysis indicated that six](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/statement-report/statement-targeting-palestinian-hrds-pegasus)\n\n\n-----\n\ndevices belonging to six Palestinian human rights defenders were hacked with Pegasus, a\n[spyware developed by the cyber-surveillance company NSO Group. Both the Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/?s=nso+group)\nand Amnesty International’s Security Lab independently confirmed these findings.\n\nOf the six individuals, three consented to be named. Of these three, two individuals are dualnationals: one French, the other American. Further, all three work at NGOs designated\n“terrorist organizations” by the Israeli government in October 2021. These designations have\nbeen widely condemned internationally, including by prominent international NGOs (including\n[Amnesty International and](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/10/israel-opt-designation-of-palestinian-civil-society-groups-as-terrorists-a-brazen-attack-on-human-rights/#Palestine) [Human Rights Watch), governmental offices and representatives](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/10/22/israel/palestine-designation-palestinian-rights-groups-terrorists)\n(such as Sweden’s Minister of International Development Cooperation and Humanitarian\nAffairs, the [High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/106325/Palestine:%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell%20met%20with%20Prime%20Minister%20Mohammad%20Shtayyeh) Ireland’s\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defence, the [French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the](https://jerusalem.consulfrance.org/ONG-palestiniennes-extrait-du-point-de-presse)\n[EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and U.S.](https://twitter.com/EamonGilmore/status/1452600646243344393) [Congressional](https://twitter.com/JamaalBowmanNY/status/1452781870622588929) [representatives), and](https://mccollum.house.gov/media/press-releases/mccollum-statement-designation-palestinian-civil-society-groups-terrorist)\nUN experts (such as the [UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27708&LangID=E) UN Special\nRapporteur for Freedom of Association). The hacking described in this report took place prior\nto this designation.\n\n## Methodology\n\nTo establish whether or not the devices had been hacked, the Citizen Lab and Amnesty\nInternational’s Security Lab each performed forensic analysis on the logs from each device.\nThe results of our analysis are listed in Table 1.\n\nOur analysis involved reviewing results shared with us by FLD, as well as analyzing logs\nextracted from the phones; these logs record names and other details about processes,\napps, or code that have run on the phone. We were able to connect specific process names\nback to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware on the basis of observing temporal correlations on\nother devices between the process names and communication with NSO Group servers.\n\nNSO Group has implicitly acknowledged that this methodology establishes signs of bona fide\nPegasus compromise. On the basis of the Citizen Lab’s technical analysis of the devices of\n_[Al Jazeera journalists, which is described here, NSO Group](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/)_ [reportedly terminated its contract](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-khashoggi-hacking-nso.html)\n[with Saudi Arabia. Additionally, NSO Group reportedly terminated its contract with the](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/06/walls-closing-in-story-behind-princess-haya-hacking-ordeal)\nEmirate of Dubai because the customer abused the spyware to hack the Emir’s ex-wife,\nPrincess Haya Bint al-Hussein, and her lawyers. In May 2021, the High Court of England and\nWales [ruled that the phones had been hacked with Pegasus on the basis of this technical](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vii-Hacking-fact-Finding-judgment-5.5.2021.pdf)\nmethodology.\n\n## Targets\n\nThe table below summarizes information regarding the targets’ identity and when the\ntargeting occurred. Note that some dates of hacking may not be particularly significant, as\nzero-click hacking can sometimes be driven by availability of exploits rather than specific\n\n\n-----\n\ntimeframes of interest. Of interest is the fact that four hacked phones exclusively used SIMs\nissued by Israeli telecoms companies with Israeli (+972) phone numbers. NSO Group has\nsaid that exported versions of Pegasus cannot be used to hack Israeli phone numbers.\n\n\n**Target** **Position**\n\n\n**Approximate**\n**Dates Phone**\n**Hacked with**\n**Pegasus** **SIM(s)**\n\n\nGhassan\nHalaika\n\nUbai\nAboudi\n\nSalah\nHammouri\n\n\nField researcher and human rights\ndefender working for Alhaq\n\nExecutive Director at Bisan Center for\nResearch and Development\n\nLawyer and field researcher at\nAddameer Prisoner Support and\nHuman Rights Association based in\nJerusalem\n\n\n(1) 2020-07-14 –\n2020-07-18\n\n(1) 2021-02-12 –\n2021-02-17\n\n(1) 2021-04-12 –\n2021-04-30\n\n\n(1) MCC 425,\nMNC 07\n(HOT Mobile –\nIL)\n\n(1) MCC 425,\nMNC 05\n(Jawwal – PS)\n\n(1) MCC 425,\nMNC 02\n(Cellcom ltd. –\nIL)\n\n\nT4 Human rights defender (1) 2021-04-12 (1) MCC 425,\nMNC 02\n(Cellcom ltd. –\nIL)\n\n\nT5 Human rights defender (1) 2021-02-10\n(2) 2021-04-03\n(3) 2021-04-12\n\n\n(1) MCC 425,\nMNC 01\n(Orange/Partner\n– IL)\n\n\nT6 Human rights defender (1) 2020-11-04 (1) MCC 425,\nMNC 05\n(Jawwal – PS)\n\n**Table 1: Results of forensic analysis conducted on the phones of Palestinians**\n**targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.**\n\nThe phone logs of Ghassan Halaika record that a binary was stored at\n_/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/smmsgingd, and that a process with the_\nname smmsgingd ran on the phone starting on 2020-07-14.

There are no legitimate iOS processes_\nwith these names. The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International’s Security Lab have linked\nboth accountpdf and logseld to Pegasus.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nThis report confirms that the devices of six Palestinian human rights defenders were hacked\nwith NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware in 2020 and 2021, as published by Front Line\nDefenders. The hacking took place prior to the Israeli government’s decision to designate a\nnumber of organizations working in the West Bank as terrorist organizations, a decision that\ngovernments and civil society organizations worldwide have strongly condemned.\n\nThe use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware against Palestinian human rights defenders\nillustrates yet another failure of the company’s [Human Rights Policy, which professes an](https://www.nsogroup.com/governance/human-rights-policy/)\n“unequivocal respect for human rights,” as well as the company’s [claim that the Israeli](https://www.nsogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ReportBooklet.pdf)\nregulatory system imposes sufficient human rights controls on the sale of NSO Group’s\ntechnology. NSO Group’s headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, are less than a hundred\nkilometers from where the hacked Palestinian organizations work: not only has this\ntechnology been exported to countries where it has facilitated human rights abuse like Saudi\nArabia and [Mexico, but it is also being deployed locally and in some cases against Israeli](https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-tech-surveillance-idUSL8N2PD6BQ)\n[numbers—something which NSO Group previously claimed was not possible.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/19/1006458/nso-spyware-controversy-pegasus-human-rights/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the face of such contradictions, it perhaps should come as no surprise that the company\nwas [recently added to the United States Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)’s Entity List,](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list)\nwith the United States Commerce Department expressly noting that NSO Group was added\nbecause the company’s technology was used to “maliciously target” activists.\n\n\n-----",
