This\n\nisn't terribly surprising considering the group's [watering hole activity against ASEAN websites](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fapt-trends-report-q3-2017%2F83162%2F) as\n\nobserved in the Fall of 2017. In another apparent prong of attack, the new campaign delivers a malicious\n\nRTF document posing as an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also\n\ncarries an executable (payload) embedded as an OLE object, the Elise backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Elise backdoor is not new malware and has been successfully diagnosed in the past by Industry\n\nresearchers (e.g. [Palo Alto Unit 42's 2015 report](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paloaltonetworks.com%2Fapps%2Fpan%2Fpublic%2FdownloadResource%3FpagePath%3D%2Fcontent%2Fpan%2Fen_US%2Fresources%2Fresearch%2Funit42-operation-lotus-blossom) ) and more recently by [Volexity](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.volexity.com%2Fblog%2F2017%2F11%2F06%2Foceanlotus-blossoms-mass-digital-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-asean-nations-the-media-human-rights-and-civil-society%2F) and [Accenture](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Ft20180127T003755Z__w__%2Fus-en%2F_acnmedia%2FPDF-46%2FAccenture-Security-Dragonfish-Threat-Analysis.pdf%23zoom%3D50) .\n\nEach of these are valuable resources to understanding the Elise malcode, infection process, and known\n\n[capabilities of the backdoor. In addition, a current ANY.RUN playback of our observed Elise infection](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.any.run%2Ftasks%2F05b68865-529e-44e4-882f-0c184b162f12) is\n\nalso available.\n\nUpon opening of the MS Word document, our embedded file exploits [CVE­2017­11882](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvedetails.com%2Fcve%2Fcve-2017-11882) to drop a\n\n[malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module, 'NavShExt.dll](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2F6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79%2Fdetection) ', which is then injected into\n\niexplore.exe to install the backdoor, begin collection, and activate command and control.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Moving through the infection process, NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit (CVE­2017­1182](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvedetails.com%2Fcve%2Fcve-2017-11882) ) in\n\naction as the Microsoft Equation Editor, 'EQNEDT32.exe', scores high for potentially malicious activity. This\n\n\nsame process was also flagged in our any.run playback.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this is happening, the malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun in the registry and then\n\nalso creates 'thumbcache_1CD60.db' at 'Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer\\' to\n\nstore harvested data.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the infection process completes, we now observe Elise network activity (e.g., exfil of victim data and C2)\n\nthrough a conveniently hidden instance of Internet Explorer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis traffic was also observed in NetWitness Packets, as the malware verifies the host IP address prior\n\n[to kicking off C2 out to 103.236.150[.]14](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.riskiq.com%2Fsearch%2F103.236.150.14), which is likely compromised infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nprotect this data via both B64 encoding and AES encryption. The actual C2 for Elise takes place over\n\n\"cookie\" code and (rarely) body content.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther infections (from the identical payload) each generated their own decoy domains to populate the host\n\nheader, but in every case actually used the same hard­coded IP address, [103.236.150[.]14](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.riskiq.com%2Fsearch%2F103.236.150.14) .\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors actually went to significant efforts to generate these seemingly random domains, likely in\n\nan attempt at obfuscating C2 traffic and avoiding domain­based detection/mitigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nBased on both previous activity and this current Lotus Blossom campaign, it is clear that we are witnessing\n\nthe continued rise of cyber tradecraft and activity from nation­states in the Southeast Asian theater.\n\nThanks to [Kent Backman,](https://community.rsa.com/people/Gl8LOTl4A2rCbPZkifuse3cHH75XbzVWfnhIYrQRH4A=) [Justin Lamarre, and](https://community.rsa.com/people/ebeaINpJCPQvueBuILnImsMW49IGrBKoVOB6f66tRCQ=) [Ahmed Sonbol for their assistance with this research.](https://community.rsa.com/people/B2QKZMrDo53ui48qarO9kYZN09ujo2snbEzRAeJQqZU=)\n\nThe following samples were used for this analysis:\n\n[Malicious RTF Dropper](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2Fd3fc69a9f2ae2c446434abbfbe1693ef0f81a5da0a7f39d27c80d85f4a49c411%2Fdetection) (SHA256): d3fc69a9f2ae2c446434abbfbe1693ef0f81a5da0a7f39d27c80d85f4a49c411\n\n[NavShExt.dll](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2F6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79%2Fdetection) (SHA256): 6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79\n\n[League of Legends banner art credit: Riot Games](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.riotgames.com%2Fen)\n\n\n**[Visibility: RSA NetWitness Suite](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog)** - **355 Views**\n\n\n-----\n\n[netwithess](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/tags#/?tags=netwithess) [apt32](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/tags#/?tags=apt32) [lotus blossom](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/tags#/?tags=lotus%20blossom) [vietnam](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/tags#/?tags=vietnam)\n\n**Categories:** [RSA NetWitness Endpoint](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/content?filterID=contentstatus[published]~category[rsa-netwitness-endpoint])\n\n\n## 0 Comments\n\n\n### Recommended Content\n\n[Manage Authentication Sources](https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-54089)\n\n[000032873 ‑ Tips for troubleshooting Advanced Workflow in RSA Archer 6.0](https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-47309)\n\n000034499 ‑ RSA Archer Advanced Workflow Service is not working and displays error: Service not\navailable.\n\n[Configure a Custom Portal Page for Web Applications](https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-54151)\n\n[Alerting Using ESA Guide](https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-42083)\n\n\n**Products & Solutions**\n[RSA® Access Manager](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/access-manager)\nRSA® Adaptive\nAuthentication\nRSA® Adaptive Auth. for\neCommerce\n[RSA® Adaptive Directory](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/adaptive-directory)\n[RSA Archer® Suite](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/archer-grc)\n[RSA BSAFE®](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/bsafe)\nRSA® Data Loss\nPrevention (DLP)\nRSA® Data Protection\nManager (DPM)\nRSA® Digital Certificate\nSolutions\n\n\n[RSA enVision®](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/envision)\nRSA® Federated\nIdentity Manager (FIM)\nRSA® FraudAction\nServices\nRSA® Identity\n[Governance &](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/governance-and-lifecycle)\nLifecycle\nRSA NetWitness®\nEndpoint\nRSA NetWitness®\nLogs & Packets\n[RSA SecurID® Suite](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/securid)\nRSA® Web Threat\nDetection\n\n\n**RSA University**\nRSA Archer® Suite\nTraining\nRSA NetWitness® Suite\nTraining\nRSA SecurID® Suite\nTraining\n\n\n**[Support](https://community.rsa.com/community/support)**\n**[My RSA](https://rsaportal.force.com/customer/home/home.jsp)**\n**[RSA Labs](https://community.rsa.com/community/labs)**\n**[RSA Ready](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/rsa-ready)**\n\n**Activity**\n**Feed**\n**About RSA**\n**Link**\n**Terms &**\n**Conditions**\n**Submit**\n**Feedback**\n\n\n[Home | Top of page | Help](https://community.rsa.com/) [© 2018 Jive Software | Powered by ](http://www.jivesoftware.com/poweredby/)\n\n\n-----",
