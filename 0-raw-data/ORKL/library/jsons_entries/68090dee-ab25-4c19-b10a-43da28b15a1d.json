The message,\nsent by a hacker group who call themselves \"Guardians of Peace\" (#GOP), warned that it\n\n\n-----\n\nwas only the beginning, and that they will continue until their request be met . Shortly after\nthe news broke out about the Sony hack, there were rampant claims of the involvement of\nNorth Korea who used a certain “wiper” malware.\n\n**[More: How did the hackers drop the \"warning\" wallpaper into Sony's office**\n**computers? Read** **_An Analysis of the “Destructive” Malware Behind FBI_**\n**_Warnings from the Security Intelligence Blog]_**\n\nLike most breach stories, we learn more about the nature of the hack as time passes, and\nthough the ongoing investigation provided us with a few solid details, most of the headlines\naround the hack have focused more on who did it rather than what was obtained. Meanwhile,\n[researchers have determined the destructive malware that launched the attack. From a](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/an-analysis-of-the-destructive-malware-behind-fbi-warnings/)\nsecurity standpoint, it's critical to record all aspects of the incident and respond urgently and\naccordingly.

As such, we advise users\nto be careful regarding the links they click and the stories they follow online, as\ncybercriminals are quick to play on people’s curiosity especially when it comes to major news\nbreakouts.\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
