    "plain_text": "# Chinese Hackers Indicted\n\n**fbi.gov/news/stories/chinese-hackers-indicted-122018**\n\nMembers of APT 10 Group Targeted Intellectual Property and Confidential Business\nInformation\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at a December 20, 2018 press conference at the\nDepartment of Justice announcing charges against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, both\nChinese nationals and members of the APT 10 hacking group, as Deputy Attorney General\nRod J. Rosenstein looks on.\n\nTwo Chinese men have been charged in a massive, years-long hacking campaign that stole\npersonal and proprietary information from companies around the world, the FBI and the\nJustice Department announced at a press conference today in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe men, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, are part of a group known as Advanced Persistent\nThreat 10, or APT 10, a hacking group associated with the Chinese government. A New\nYork grand jury indicted the pair for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, conspiracy to\ncommit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The indictment was unsealed today.\n\nAccording to the indictment, from around 2006 to 2018, APT 10 conducted extensive\nhacking campaigns, stealing information from more than 45 victim organizations, including\nAmerican companies. Hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data were secretly taken from\ncompanies in a diverse range of industries, such as health care, biotechnology, finance,\nmanufacturing, and oil and gas.\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray described the list of companies, not named in the indictment,\nas a “Who’s Who” of the global economy. Even government agencies like NASA and the\nDepartment of Energy were among the victims. The hack is part of China’s ongoing efforts\nto steal intellectual property from other countries.\n\n“Healthy competition is good for the global economy. Criminal conduct is not. Rampant theft\nis not. Cheating is not,” Wray said at the press conference.\n\nAPT 10 used “spear phishing” techniques to introduce malware onto targeted computers.\nThe hackers sent emails that appeared to be from legitimate addresses but contained\nattachments that installed a program to secretly record all keystrokes on the machine,\nincluding user names and passwords. The group also targeted managed service providers\n(MSPs), companies that remotely manage their clients’ servers and networks. MSP hacks\nallowed APT 10 members to indirectly gain access to confidential data of numerous\ncompanies who were the clients of the MSPs.\n\n## “China’s state-sponsored actors are the most active perpetrators of state-sponsored espionage against us.”\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray\n\n“When hackers gain access to MSPs, they can steal sensitive business information that\ngives competitors an unfair advantage,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein\nduring today’s announcement.\n\nAPT 10 also accessed the personal information of more than 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel.\n\nIn remarks announcing the indictments, Wray noted that FBI and Department of Defense\ninvestigators worked together to analyze hundreds of malware samples. Investigators found\nlinks between victims and APT 10. The FBI’s [Cyber Action Team, in collaboration with the](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber)\nDepartment of Homeland Security, also provided technical assistance and investigated the\nincidents.\n\nAlthough the two indicted hackers are believed to be in China, they can be arrested if they\ntravel.\n\nThis indictment is the latest in a series of charges against international hackers who target\nthe United States and its allies. In October, seven Russian government operatives were\n[charged with hacking into international anti-doping agencies. Last month, two Iranians were](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/russian-gru-officers-charged-with-hacking-100418)\n[charged with using ransomware to infiltrate critical networks in the United States and](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/iranian-ransomware-suspects-indicted-112818)\nCanada.\n\nThe cyber espionage threat from China is the most pervasive, Wray stressed.\n\n\n-----\n\nChina s goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world s leading superpower, and\nthey’re using illegal methods to get there. They’re using an expanding set of non-traditional\nand illegal methods,” Wray said. “China’s state-sponsored actors are the most active\nperpetrators of state-sponsored espionage against us.”\n\nSelect image to view/download poster.\n\n\n-----",
