Based\nupon the totality of information available and the close correlation with prior reporting, we\nassess with moderate confidence these actions leveraged the Konni malware, which has\n[previously been associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and were](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.konni)\nundertaken to establish access to the MID network for the purpose of espionage. This\nactivity cluster demonstrates the patient and persistent nature of advanced actors in waging\nmulti-phased campaigns against perceived high-value networks. After gaining access\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough stolen credentials, the actor was able to exploit trusted connections to distribute and\nload the malware, first by impersonating a government software program coinciding with new\nCovid mandates, and then through sending trojanized files from a compromised account.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn October 2021, a presumed phishing campaign targeted the Russian Federation MID with\nlinks to a series of spoofed MID portals to harvest credentials from MID personnel. The actor\nthen deployed Covid-related lures in November 2021 consisting of malicious URLs that\ndownloaded files impersonating the Department of Health and Health Service. One of the\nfiles installed a fake version of the Russian-mandated vaccination registration software and\nserved as a loader for additional malicious files. In December 2021, after successfully\ncompromising the email account of a staff member of the MID, the threat actor targeted at\nleast two other MID entities via emails from the compromised account: the Russian Embassy\nin Indonesia and a deputy minister overseeing non-proliferation and arms control, among\nother responsibilities. The emails propagated a “Happy New Year’s” message containing a\ntrojanized screensaver attachment. These activity clusters are connected in a number of\nways: First, the spoofed hostnames from the October cluster resolved to the same malicious\nIP that sent the targeted emails containing the screensaver. Second, the initially observed\nTTPs used in the November activity correlated to the December activity. Finally, the\nscreensaver from the December activity downloaded a first-stage agent which is nearly\n[identical to the agent previously reported by Malwarebytes.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2021/08/new-variant-of-konni-malware-used-in-campaign-targetting-russia/)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Overview of Konni campaign against Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID)\n\n## October 2021: Phishing for Initial Access\n\nWe assess the campaign began on or around October 19, 2021, with the initial goal of\nharvesting credentials. The Black Lotus Labs team discovered a series of spoofed\nhostnames impersonating MID portals that all resolved to the same single IP address:\n152.89.247[.]26. One hostname, portal.newint-mid.ru.carnegieinsider[.]com, had a Let’s\nEncrypt X.509 certificate that was issued on October 19, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of the Let’s Encrypt X.509 certificate for a spoofed MID portal\nhostname\n\nIn addition, we discovered two other spoofed hostnames resolving to the 152.89.247[.]26 IP\naddress during mid-October. These additional hostnames referenced email services\nfrequently used in Russia, such as Yandex and mail.ru: e.mail.ru.settings.pronto-login[.]com\nand passport.yandex.ru-settings.pronto-login[.]com.\n\nAll the spoofed hostnames that resolved to this IP address used either the domain prontologin[.]com or carnegieinsider[.]com.\n\nFor a full list of spoofed hostnames, see the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of\nthis report.\n\n## November 2021: Covid Vaccination Registration Activity\n\nBased upon file metadata, we assess that the next cluster of activity occurred on\napproximately November 7, 2021. In this timeframe, the threat actor sent out malicious URL\nlinks that, if clicked, downloaded a file that was hosted on Yandex’s cloud service.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: The malicious hyperlink to download the .zip file\n\nThe downloaded .zip file (named oloo@mid.ru.zip) impersonated the “ОТДЕЛ ЛЕЧЕБНООЗДОРОВИТЕЛЬНОГО ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЯ,” which loosely translates to the “Department of\nHealth and Health Services for the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs.” This .zip\nfile contained several benign PDFs and Word documents that asked the recipient to provide\ninformation regarding vaccination status and to sign a consent form. The timing of this\n[activity closely aligned with the passage of Russian Vaccine Passport laws that mandated](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-regions-introduce-qr-codes-entry-public-venues-covid-19-cases-hit-record-2021-10-18/)\nRussians had to receive a QR code from the government to prove vaccination in order to\naccess public places such as restaurants and bars.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: One of the files downloaded from Yandex cloud that discussed the vaccine\nmandate\n\nThe .zip file also contained an installer file called oloo@mid.ru/ПРОГРАММА ДЛЯ\nРЕГИСТРАЦИИ ПРИВИТЫХ В ФЕДЕРАЛЬНОМ РЕГИСТРЕ ВАКЦИНИРОВАННЫХ.exe\nwhich translates to “Program for Vaccination Registration in the Federal Registry.exe.” This\ninstaller impersonated a legitimate software the Russian people were directed to install in\norder to receive QR codes verifying their vaccination status. If invoked, this installer would\nalso surreptitiously run a malicious loader file that attempted to retrieve a compressed file\nfrom the threat actor hostname victory-2020.atwebpages[.]com. Unfortunately, we were not\nable to recover a copy of the first stage payload. However, the functionality for the Covid\nregistration loader is nearly identical to that of the loader used in a December 2021 activity.\n\n## December 2021: Happy New Year’s Activity\n\nOn December 20, 2021, we detected malicious emails being sent from a compromised MID\naccount, mskhlystova@mid[.]ru. When we examined the email headers, we identified they\nwere originating from the same IP address from the October phishing activity,\n152.89.247[.]26. Copies of the malicious emails and their translations are below.\n\nFigure 5: Screenshot of two malicious emails sent by the threat actor\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: English translation of the emails\n\nAs of the time of this writing, we have identified two recipients of the emails, although we\nsuspect there are more. The first was sent to the Russian Embassy in Indonesia:\nrusemb.indonesia@mid[.]ru . The second email was sent to Sergey Alexeyevich Ryabkov\nwho was, according to a cached version of the MID website at the end of December 2021,\nresponsible for “bilateral relations with North and South America, non-proliferation and arms\ncontrol, Iran’s nuclear program and Russia’s participation in the BRICS association,” an\ninternational alliance comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. [Note: The\nMID website link is no longer active.]\n\nIf the malicious email was opened, it prompted the user to download and click the attached\n.zip file titled “поздравление”, which means “Congratulations.” Upon decompression, it\nrevealed a screensaver file by the same name that, when clicked, displayed a festive holiday\nscreensaver wishing the recipient a Happy New Year while also surreptitiously running a\nlight-weight loader to retrieve a file from the C2 node at hxxp://i758769.atwebpages[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Benign Happy New Year’s screensaver that was displayed on the infected machine\n\nWhen we analyzed the network communications generated by the screensaver file, we\nnoticed an interesting evasion technique. When the loader file reached out to the threat actor\ncommand and control node to obtain the first stage payload, the actor configured the server\nto respond with a code of “401 unauthorized.” Typically, a 401 error means the user making\nthe request was not authorized to view the webpage and, in many cases, it results in the\nsession being terminated. However, in this case, the website returned a malicious payload in\nthe second part of the response. This was likely a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nFigure 8: Screenshot showing the C2 serving a 401 error code with the accompanying\npayload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 node served the requesting machine a Microsoft Cabinet File (.cab). Once the .cab\nfile was decompressed, it contained three more files: install.bat, scrnsvc.dll and scrnsvc.ini.\n\nFigure 9: Overview of the Happy New Year’s activity\n\nThese files were placed at the following location: %windir%/system32/. The install.bat file\ncreated a service called “ScreenSaver Management Service” that executed the malicious\nfiles on start. It then modified two registry keys on the infected machine.\n\nReg add “HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost” /v scrnsvc /t\nREG_MULTI_SZ /d “scrnsvc” /f > nul\n\nreg add “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\scrnsvc\\Parameters” /v ServiceDll /t\nREG_EXPAND_SZ /d “%windir%\\System32\\scrnsvc.dll” /f > nul\n\nIf the scrnsvc.dll and scrnsvc.ini files were already on the host machine, they were copied to\nthe file path %windir%\\System32. The .bat file then attempted to clean up some of the\nartifacts and launched the .dll file.\n\nThe .dll file checked the infected machine for the presence of a .dat file at the following\nlocation: %windir%/system32/scrnsvc.dat. If no such file was found, it decrypted the contents\nof scrnsvc.ini which contained the threat actor hostname (http://i758769.atwebpages[.]com).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe .dll file then downloaded a file from http://i758769.atwebpages[.]com/info.php and saved\nit as %windir%/system32/scrnsvc.dat. Once decrypted, the scrnsvc.dat revealed the location\nof the second command and control server at hostname http://h378576.atwebpages[.]com.\n\nNext, the .dll file performed some basic host-based reconnaissance on the infected machine.\nIt ran the systeminfo command from the command line of the infected machine to allow the\nthreat actor to obtain information such as: hostname, OS name, OS version, domain,\nprocessor, BIOS version, etc. The .dll file then compressed the contents of the systeminfo\ncommand as a .cab file, encrypted it and uploaded it to the second threat actor-controlled\nhostname (hxxp://h378576.atwebpages[.]com/up.php?name=COMPUTER_NAME), which\nprompted a “success!” message as the response.\n\nFigure 10: Screen shot depicting “success!” message\n\nNext, the.dll file obtained a list of all the running tasks, via tasklist, on the infected machine\nand repeated the same process of compressing, encrypting and subsequently uploading that\nfile to the threat actor C2.\n\nThe .dll file then attempted to download another payload from the second C2\nh378576.atwebpages[.]com/dn.php?name={Host name}&prefix=cc (0). It entered a loop\nwhere the agent slept and attempted to reach back out to obtain the next payload at the URL\nh378576.atwebpages[.]com/dn.php?name={Host Name}&prefix=tt. Unfortunately, we were\nunable to recover a copy of the next payload. We suspect that the threat actor only served\nthe next payload to a limited number of targeted machines based upon the contents of\nsysteminfo and tasklist information that was uploaded to the C2.\n\nBased on the observed TTPs, including the use of a light-weight loader to retrieve a .cab file\ncomprised of install.bat, the use of .dll to call an .ini file, the host-based commands and\nsimilar URL structures for the C2s, we observe strong correlation with the malware\npreviously reported as Konni.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[At Black Lotus Labs, we continue to track the use of Konni malware. While this particular](https://twitter.com/BlackLotusLabs/status/1461708689560252428?s=20)\ncampaign was highly targeted, it is vital for defenders to understand the evolving capabilities\nof advanced actors to achieve infection of coveted targets.\n\nWe advise our customers to perform full monitoring of network resources, use of multifactor\nauthentication and reemphasizing the importance of phishing awareness to employees.\nThese defensive measures that can help protect sensitive networks from this type of\nmalicious activity.\n\nBlack Lotus Labs blocked the threat actor infrastructure across the Lumen global IP network\nto protect customers and the wider internet ecosystem in the event that this actor re-uses the\ninfrastructure in future campaigns. We also added these indicators to the Black Lotus Labs\nreputation system, which feeds Lumen’s security portfolio. We will continue to follow this\nactivity to detect and disrupt similar campaigns, and we encourage other organizations to\nalert on these and similar indicators in their environments.\n\nFor additional IoCs such as file hashes associated with this campaign, please visit our\nGitHub page.\n\nIf you would like to collaborate on similar research, please contact us on\nTwitter [@BlackLotusLabs.](https://twitter.com/BlackLotusLabs)\n\nThis analysis was performed by Danny Adamitis and Steve Rudd.\n\nThis information is provided “as is” without any warranty or condition of any kind, either\nexpress or implied.
