    "plain_text": "# The Italian Connection: An analysis of exploit supply chains and digital quartermasters\n\nby\nNed Moran (ned@shadowserver.org)\nBen Koehl (benk@accessviolation.org)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Overview**\n\nOn July 5, 2015 an unknown hacker publicly announced on Twitter that he had breached the\ninternal network of Hacking Team ­ an Italian pentesting company known to purchase 0­day\nexploits and produce their own trojans. The hacker proceeded to leak archives of internal\nHacking Team tools and communications. A number of tools and previously unknown exploits\nwere discovered in the trove of data posted online.\n\nIn this paper we will focus on two exploits which at the time of discovery in the Hacking Team\narchives were unpatched. The two 0­days in question targeted Adobe Flash and were\nsubsequently labeled CVE­2015­5119 and CVE­2015­5122 . 1 2\n\nThe goal of this research is to demonstrate how quickly these exploits spread and were used by\nmultiple independent cyber espionage operators. Via the evidence presented within this paper 3\n\nwe will demonstrate that at least two different exploit kits, or generators, were constructed by an\nunknown entity and shared amongst multiple operators believed to be located in China. We\nbelieve the following is a clear example of yet another ‘digital quartermaster’ of cyber espionage\ntools.\n\n**Research Methodology**\n\nFor this research we set out to collect as many CVE­2015­5119 and CVE­2015­5122 exploits as\npossible. We excluded exploits that were delivered by popular crimeware kits such as Angler.\nWe chose to focus our efforts on exploits used in a more targeted fashion by cyber espionage\noperators.\n\nOur approach to data collection was two­fold. First, we crawled specific websites that have been\npreviously used to deliver exploits and malware in ‘strategic web compromise (SWC)’ or\n‘watering hole’ attacks . Second, we deployed a variety of Yara signatures designed to detect 4\n\nmalicious Flash files that exploited both CVE­2015­5119 and CVE­2015­5122 into repositories\nlike VirusTotal and Shadowserver. We collected a total of 52 unique samples via these 5\n\ntechniques.\n\nOnce collected, we set about designing a process to cluster our data set. For each file collected\nwe enumerated the following data points where possible:\n\n  - SWF MD5: MD5 hash of the Flash exploit file\n\n  - CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier\n\n1 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi­bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE­2015­5119​\n23 We define independent operators as actors that maintain distinct infrastructure without any technical overlaps such as ip history. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi­bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE­2015­5122​\n4 An example of a previous Strategic Web Compromise campaign can be found at ​\nhttp://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber­espionage­strategic­web­compromises­trusted­websites­serving­dangerous­results/\n5 http://www.virustotal.com/intelligence/\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Last­modified data: if we discovered the exploit in the wild we collected the last­modified\ndata of the file as a means to determine when the attacker released the exploit into the\nwild\n\n  - Referrer site (aka SWC or Watering hole): where possible we noted the referrer url\n\n  - Exploit site: where possible we noted the site where the exploit was hosted\n\n  - Creation date: if metadata was present we noted the creation date of the Flash file\n\n  - ActionScript class name: classname of ActionScript that invokes the exploit\n\n  - ActionScript hashes: the md5 hash of each ActionScript class embedded in the Flash file\n\n  - Compression: the compression algorithm used on the Flash file\n\n  - Payload location: the location of the payload (e.g. in the Flash file or on a remote server)\n\n  - Payload MD5: MD5 hash\n\n  - C2 server: the command and control server for the dropped payload\n\n  - Attribution: where possible we noted the actor responsible for deploying the exploit into\nthe wild\n\nIn this paper we are less interested in a detailed analysis of individual actors using these\nexploits. Rather our goal is to reveal relationships between groups that appear to be\nindependent based on analysis of standard technical artifacts such as dropped payload and\ncommand and control infrastructure. Where we could not definitively attribute an exploit to a\nspecific actor, we were comfortable in simply asserting that the artifacts from the exploit to\npayload chain in question did or did not overlap with other exploit to payload chains in our\ncollection.\n\nAs we clustered the Flash files in our data set we identified five distinct sets of exploits. We\nbelieve that two of these clusters of files were created by two different privately shared exploit\nkits or generators tools. These kits or generators are a graphical user interface or command line\ntool. The tool enables an operator to quickly and easy bind a payload or remote download url to\nshellcode in the flash exploit file via a handful of mouse clicks or a simple command.\n\nOur data illustrates that distinct intrusion sets or actors were using the same exploit variants\nfrom the same kits on the same day in different attacks leveraging different infrastructure. This\nfinding suggests that multiple kits or generators were shared with independent actors.\n\nThroughout the body of this paper we will describe each cluster of exploit activity that we\nobserved. We will then conclude with an overall analysis of this activity and present several\ncompeting hypotheses that can be used to explain the exploit clusters that we observed.\n\n**Cluster Analysis**\n\nThe five clusters of exploit activity that we discovered will henceforth be referred to as\nHT_Exploit cluster, flash_exploit_002 cluster, exp1_fla cluster, exp2_fla cluster and finally\nmovie_fla cluster. Each of these clusters were named for the ActionScript class used to invoke\nthe exploit code.\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Cluster 1: HT_Exploit_**\n\nShortly after the July 5, 2015 public announcement of the intrusion into the Hacking Team’s\nnetwork and subsequent release of the company’s data, the first 0­day exploit targeting Adobe\nFlash was discovered. On July 7, 2015 Adobe released a patch for the underlying vulnerability\ntargeted by the discovered exploit code. This vulnerability was labeled CVE­2015­5119. Shortly 6\n\nafter this patch was released a number of different cyber espionage operators deployed exploits\ntargeting this vulnerability.\n\nIn total we collected 13 Flash files that exploited CVE­2015­5119 and according to the file’s\nmetadata were created on July 7, 2015. Of these 13 files, as shown in Table 1, 11 files had the\nsame ActionScript class name of HT_Exploit. These 11 files were all compressed with the LZMA\nalgorithm and had the malicious payload bundled internally.\n\n**Date** **Embedded**\n**Created** **SWF MD5** **AS Class** **CVE** **Compression** **Payload**\n\n7/7/2015 dceae0d1a680bc098bae9da466e12610 HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 5392f1399a49935817669d22e5e644ea HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 da6c98d8f37290a10119fbca33eec58a HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 878d13b8ceb49cfe9ff1b063bffeb9a9 HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 079a440bee0f86d8a59ebc5c4b523a07 HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 2c6126e9f308d1be11553978e8a97621 HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 75dc1e22e16c39e3532673f75fd41b93 HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 00591821f328911380277272164d08cd HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 0b3a047d31461e20887bb1d32b4e472f HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 f46019f795bd721262dc69988d7e53bc HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n7/7/2015 79dc5ee17ab11a647d6dff51d3908bda HT_Exploit CVE­2015­5119 LZMA yes\n\n**Table 1: HT_Exploit Cluster**\n\nFurther, each of these 11 Flash files had identical ActionScript classes as shown in Table 2\nbelow:\n\n6 https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash­player/apsa15­03.html\n\n4\n\n|Date Created|SWF MD5|AS Class|CVE|Compression|Embedded Payload|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7/7/2015|dceae0d1a680bc098bae9da466e12610|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|5392f1399a49935817669d22e5e644ea|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|da6c98d8f37290a10119fbca33eec58a|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|878d13b8ceb49cfe9ff1b063bffeb9a9|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|079a440bee0f86d8a59ebc5c4b523a07|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|2c6126e9f308d1be11553978e8a97621|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|75dc1e22e16c39e3532673f75fd41b93|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|00591821f328911380277272164d08cd|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|0b3a047d31461e20887bb1d32b4e472f|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|f46019f795bd721262dc69988d7e53bc|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n|7/7/2015|79dc5ee17ab11a647d6dff51d3908bda|HT_Exploit|CVE­2015­5119|LZMA|yes|\n\n\n-----\n\n|ActionScript classname|MD5|\n|---|---|\n|§bin_bin$cdc90048eba972f1f617b202a379b8d8­1052822192§.as|b5847d4f60ecba8a09a019d8826a6a18|\n|HT_exploit.as|55bc2ac6bfcaaf9364a67cbd837aa66e|\n|MyClass.as|3652a267b318b13c99c1a817416406ee|\n|MyClass1.as|4b705980ed1b07becd76f47e007b5b3a7|\n|MyClass2.as|955de95974a6228846cea327772815fe|\n|MyUtils.as|23489ab7e77f7c69db3e2c6fd791bddb|\n|ShellWin32.as|2d34c498fa0a65a59fd724d1d5466fbc|\n\n\n**Table 2: HT_Exploit ActionScript classes**\n\nIn summary the 11 Flash exploit files listed in Table 1 share the following characteristics:\n\n  - Created on the same date of 7/7/2015\n\n  - Targeted the same vulnerability of CVE­2015­5119\n\n  - Compressed via the LZMA algorithm\n\n  - Contained an embedded payload\n\n  - Had identical ActionScript as shown in Table 2\n\n**Image 1: HT_Exploit Cluster**\n\nThe common attributes strongly suggests these Flash exploits were created by a single exploit\ngenerator.

As Table\n4 illustrates these exploits had different ActionScript class names and instead of bundling the\npayloads internally both exploits download malicious payloads from remote servers.\nAdditionally, as opposed to using LZMA compression these exploits used zlib compression.\nFurther, the supporting ActionScript classes found in these files were different than the\nActionScript classes seen above in the HT_Exploit files.\n\n**Actor** **Date Created** **SWF MD5** **AS Class** **CVE** **Compression**\n\nSofacy/APT28 8 2015­07­07 557f8d4c6f8b386c32001def807dc715 Main CVE­2015­5119 zlib\n\nUPS/APT3 9 2015­07­07 e9a57f70f739cb26dc053238b0a97425 MainClass CVE­2015­5119 zlib\n\n**Table 4: CVE­2015­5119 outliers**\n\nThe differences in the these two exploits versus the HT_Exploit samples indicates that neither\nSofacy/APT28 nor the UPS/APT3 exploit were constructed with the same HT_Exploit generator\ntool.\n\nThis finding is significant as it offers evidence that the Sofacy/APT28 actor and UPS/APT3 actor\nmaintain their own exploit supply chains or have in­house talent capable of exploit development.\nIt is not a surprise that Sofacy, a cyber espionage operator believed to be based in Russia, does\nnot share the same exploit supply chain as the actors using the HT_Exploit generator ­ many of\nwhom are believed to be based in China.\n\n8 http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/07/10/sednit­apt­group­meets­hacking­team/​\n9 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat­research/2015/07/demonstrating_hustle.html​\n\n6\n\n|Actor|Date Created|SWF MD5|AS Class|CVE|Compression|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Sofacy/APT288|2015­07­07|557f8d4c6f8b386c32001def807dc715|Main|CVE­2015­5119|zlib|\n|UPS/APT3 9|2015­07­07|e9a57f70f739cb26dc053238b0a97425|MainClass|CVE­2015­5119|zlib|\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, it is informative to gather definitive evidence that Chinese actors such as\nWekby/APT18 and UPS/APT3 do not share the same exploit supply chain. This finding\ndemonstrates that some Chinese­based operators employ differing intrusion techniques, tactics\nand procedures while also maintaining unique malware and exploit supply chains.\n\n**_Cluster 2: flash_exploit_002_**\n\nA second 0­day exploit targeting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe flash,\nCVE­2015­5122, was discovered from the Hacking Team archive and subsequently patched by\nAdobe on July 10, 2015. Within one day of the release of a patch for this vulnerability multiple 10\n\ncyber espionage operators were observed sharing an exploit generator that bound this exploit to\na payload of the operator's choice.\n\nIn total, we collected 11 Flash files that exploited CVE­2015­5122 and were created on July 11,\n2015. All 11 of these files, as shown in Table 4, had the same ActionScript class name of\nflash_exploit_002, were compressed with the LZMA algorithm, and had payloads bundled with\nthe malicious Flash file.\n\n**Date** **Embedded**\n**Created** **SWF MD5** **AS Class** **CVE** **Compression** **Payload**\n\n7/11/2015 726bd0bd6cca8d481cf6165c95528caa flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 b65076f4cb6e74429dd02fcacda0bec3 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 8a8e9bbf1ca2a926f0a5d06217eeea55 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 054d9852de6983116bd3d521e8d73296 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 15112a53fcecc4c666a82ca84a853716 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 727dd4a7aae56a8202c5aa7758ea5d46 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 e33cf5b9f3991a8ee4e71f4380dd7eb1 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 451c52652ddb28e9071078f214a327a7 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 b1238ccbb10af3e81110d3afacd98161 flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 b7d39c5833e5896b7f5849966095a4bf flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n7/11/2015 d536c4b71d131848e965c4524780a8aa flash_exploit_002 CVE­2015­5122 LZMA yes\n\n**Table 4: flash_exploit_002 cluster**\n\nFurthermore, each of these 11 Flash files had identical ActionScript classes as shown in Table\n5:\n\n10 https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash­player/apsa15­04.html\n\n7\n\n|Date Created|SWF MD5|AS Class|CVE|Compression|Embedded Payload|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7/11/2015|726bd0bd6cca8d481cf6165c95528caa|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|b65076f4cb6e74429dd02fcacda0bec3|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|8a8e9bbf1ca2a926f0a5d06217eeea55|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|054d9852de6983116bd3d521e8d73296|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|15112a53fcecc4c666a82ca84a853716|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|727dd4a7aae56a8202c5aa7758ea5d46|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|e33cf5b9f3991a8ee4e71f4380dd7eb1|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|451c52652ddb28e9071078f214a327a7|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|b1238ccbb10af3e81110d3afacd98161|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|b7d39c5833e5896b7f5849966095a4bf|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n|7/11/2015|d536c4b71d131848e965c4524780a8aa|flash_exploit_002|CVE­2015­5122|LZMA|yes|\n\n\n-----\n\n|ActionScript classname|MD5|\n|---|---|\n|bin_bin$943b2abb9578a8f4b0f6164ee413a25f648059697.as|1b127227d6228ce32b93d197756b6708|\n|flash_exploit_002.as|b45bec70393db70c3c7c6d5f643cdd64|\n|MyClass.as|785e8af0535717183f547b6d876513f0|\n|MyClass32.as|00bdfdbc00dd1faa7896926b99444e2f|\n|MyUtils.as|fa9142065d6550d729168b5977f2cf14|\n|PayloadWin32.as|7d2e309c07099aaa2cf99d4075d77975|\n|ShellWin32.as|026cb3d736b6cd7d3529e04e72d35923|\n|test.as|0a28f677465fdf76689ca2fcabc68d53|\n\n\n**Table 5: flash_exploit_002 ActionScript classes**\n\nIn summary, The 11 Flash exploit files listed in Table 4 share the following characteristics:\n\n  - Created on the same date of 7/11/2015\n\n  - Targeted the same vulnerability of CVE­2015­5122\n\n  - Compressed with the LZMA algorithm\n\n  - Contained an embedded payload\n\n  - Had identical action script as shown in Table 5\n\n**Image 2: flash_exploit_002 cluster**\n\nThese common attributes indicate that these malicious Flash files were created by a single\nexploit generator.

The first file from the flash_exploit_002 cluster\nseen in the wild was observed on July 12, 2015.

The timeline presented in Image 1 illustrates\nwhen operators deployed exploits from each of the clusters discussed above.\n\n**Image 3: Exploit Deployment Timeline**\n\nThe above timeline represents only a portion of our entire data set because we were not in all\ncases able to collect the Last­Modified date from a source in the wild. However, with the subset\nof data that we collected we can reach two conclusions.\n\nFirst, the operators known as Wekby/APT18 and APT20 quickly deployed both CVE­2015­5119\nand CVE­2015­5122 exploits. Both Wekby/APT18 and APT20 deployed CVE­2015­5119 and\nCVE­5122 exploits on 7/8/2015 and 7/14/2015 respectively. In the case of 2015­5119,\nWekby/APT18 and APT20 deployed their malicious files on the first day that the exploits were\nseen in the wild. In the case of CVE­2015­5122, both Wekby/APT18 and APT20 deployed their\nexploits only two days after other groups were seen using CVE­2015­5122 in the wild.\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that Wekby/APT18 and APT20 were not sharing either the HT_Exploit nor\nflash_exploit_002 generators. The differences in the exploits used by both of the groups\nillustrates that the operators were not sharing code or tools. The differences are seen in the\nActionScript, the compression, and location of the dropped payloads.\n\nTherefore it does not appear that the two operators collaborated, but rather both maintain their\nown independent logistic operations. The speed at which both of the groups acquired either an\nexploit generator or source code suggests that they are both well connected to existing supply\nchains or maintain their own in­house talent capable of discovering vulnerabilities and\ndeveloping exploit code.\n\nSecond, multiple operators appear to have access to their own unique exploit research and\ndevelopment supply chains or in­house talent. Groups that exhibited this characteristic include\nWekby/APT18, APT20, UPS/APT3, and DNSCalc/APT12. Each of the groups were observed\nusing unique ActionScript. In the case of APT20, other operators were observed using\nvariations of the same exp1_fla ActionScript, but in that case APT20 was the first operator\nobserved using ActionScript from the exp1_fla cluster in the wild.\n\n**Analysis of Competing Hypotheses**\n\nThe data presented indicates that independent cyber espionage operators share exploit\ngenerators or code amongst themselves. This finding supports previous research that\ndemonstrates that actors also share attack tools. 18\n\nWhile it is evident that independent operators are sharing exploit generators and code, the\nstructure of these sharing relationships is unclear. There are several explanations to describe\nhow two different exploit generators and similar code were distributed to several different\nattackers.\n\n_A Single Quartermaster_\n\nIt is possible that there is a single entity responsible for vulnerability research and exploit\ndevelopment. This organization's mission would be to discover 0­day exploits, produce\nweaponized code, and develop generators. These generators would then be shared with\nindependent cyber espionage operators for use in different campaigns.\n\nThis structure would explain the usage patterns observed with HT_Exploit and\nflash_exploit_002 generators. Multiple independent operators were observed using exploits\nderived from these generators in distinct campaigns.\n\n18 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye­www/global/en/current­threats/pdfs/rpt­malware­supply­chain.pdf\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is unlikely that several different operators would be able to produce multiple exploit files with\nidentical ActionScript without the use of a shared generator.\n\n_Formal or Informal Sharing of Tools_\n\nAnother plausible explanation for the observed sharing of exploit generators and code\ndiscussed within this paper is that one or a small number of cyber espionage operators maintain\ntheir own exploit supply chain or in­house research and development capability. As these\noperators develop tools, they either formally or informally share the fruits of their labor with other\naffiliated groups.\n\nFor example, it appears that Wekby/APT18, a more established operator, either has access to\nits own exploit supply chain or has direct access to individuals with a background in vulnerability\nresearch and exploit development. In this proposed example Wekby/APT18 could then share\nthe generator developed for their own operators with operators from other distinct groups.\n\nWhile this structure of individual exploit supply chains or access to in house talent may not fully\nexplain the patterns of sharing seen across the five clusters of CVE­2015­5119 and\nCVE­2015­5122 exploits, it is evident that this model of exploit development does exist in some\ncases. In addition to Wekby/APT18, this model was also seen with UPS/APT3’s and\nSofacy/APT28’s use of ActionScript code different than the exploits created by the HT_Exploit\ngenerator on 2015­07­07. The use of different ActionScript indicates that UPS/APT3 and\nSofacy/APT28 implemented their own versions of CVE­2015­5119, while Wekby/APT18 and\nothers used a shared generator to produce their exploits.\n\n_Formal or Informal Sharing of Code_\n\nAs opposed to the model of formal or informal sharing of tools, a model of formal or informal\nsharing of code suggests that operators individually maintain their own in­house exploit\nresearch and development capability and only share code fragments or basic knowledge\namongst themselves.\n\nIn this model fully functioning generators are not shared, but instead classes or other code\nsnippets may be shared. This model could explain the sharing patterns observed in the\nexp1_fla, exp2_fla, and movie_fla clusters of CVE­2015­5119 and CVE­2015­5122 exploits.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt is unlikely that any one hypothesis by itself can fully explain the data presented in this paper.\nThe first model of a single quartermaster can be used to explain the patterns observed in the\nHT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002 clusters, but fail to explain the patterns in the exp1_fla,\nexp2_fla, and movie_fla clusters.\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\nThe model of a single quartermaster developing and sharing generators would explain the\nidentical nature of the malicious ActionScript classes in the HT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002\nclusters. However, the small variations in the ActionScript classes seen in the exp1_fla,\nexp2_fla, and movie_fla clusters suggest that a generator was not used to produce the Flash\nexploits seen in those clusters. It is unlikely that a single generator would produce the minor\ndifferences observed in a subset of the ActionScript classes seen in the exp1_fla, exp2_fla and\nmovie_fla clusters.\n\nThe second model, where a subset of operators either acquire or build then subsequently share\ntools with other less capable actors may also explain the HT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002\nclusters but does not appear to sufficiently account for the exp1_fla, exp2_fla, and movie_fla\nclusters.\n\nThe model of a subset of operators that are capable of producing and then sharing generators\nwould explain the matching ActionScript seen in the HT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002 clusters.\nHowever, this model cannot explain the minor differences seen in the exp1_fla, exp2_fla and\nmovie_fla clusters as it is unlikely that a common generator would produce the observed\ndisparity in the ActionScript.\n\nFinally, the model where each operator maintains their own exploit supply chain or in­house\nexploit research and development capability and in turn share classes or code snippets\namongst themselves may explain the exp1_fla, exp2_fla and movie_fla clusters but does not\nadequately account for the HT_Exploit or flash_exploit_002 clusters.\n\nThis model would explain the minor variations seen in the ActionScript found in the exp1_fla,\nexp2_fla and movie_fla clusters, but it is unlikely that it could explain the uniformity in the\nActionScript seen in the HT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002 clusters.\n\n**One Quartermaster** **Shared Generators** **Shared Code**\n\n**HT_Exploit** valid explanation valid explanation invalid explanation\n\n**flash_exploit_002** valid explanation valid explanation invalid explanation\n\n**exp1_fla** invalid explanation invalid explanation valid explanation\n\n**exp2_fla** invalid explanation invalid explanation valid explanation\n\n**movie_fla** invalid explanation invalid explanation valid explanation\n\n**Table 15: Competing Hypotheses**\n\nAs a result, it is likely that a mix of these models can be used to explain the data presented in\nthis paper. Therefore, through the data presented we can conclude that independent cyber\nespionage operators maintain a complex set of either formal or informal relationships that\ngovern how these actors develop and share tools, code and tactics.\n\n17\n\n|Col1|One Quartermaster|Shared Generators|Shared Code|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|HT_Exploit|valid explanation|valid explanation|invalid explanation|\n|flash_exploit_002|valid explanation|valid explanation|invalid explanation|\n|exp1_fla|invalid explanation|invalid explanation|valid explanation|\n|exp2_fla|invalid explanation|invalid explanation|valid explanation|\n|movie_fla|invalid explanation|invalid explanation|valid explanation|\n\n\n-----",
