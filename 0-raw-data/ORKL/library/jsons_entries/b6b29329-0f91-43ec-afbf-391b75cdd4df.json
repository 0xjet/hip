Through the use of thumb drives in\ncomputers that were not connected to the Internet, a malicious software program known as\nStuxnet infected computer systems that were used to control the functioning of a nuclear power\nplant. Once inside the system, Stuxnet had the ability to degrade or destroy the software on which\nit operated. Although early reports focused on the impact on facilities in Iran, researchers\ndiscovered that the program had spread throughout multiple countries worldwide.\n\nFrom the perspective of many national security and technology observers, the emergence of the\nStuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to\nthe basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and\nexploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software\napplication such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the\npoint of inoperability or long-term damage. Should such an incident occur, recovery from the\ndamage to the computer systems programmed to monitor and manage a facility and the physical\nequipment producing goods or services could be significantly delayed. Depending on the severity\nof the attack, the interconnected nature of the affected critical infrastructure facilities, and\ngovernment preparation and response plans, entities and individuals relying on these facilities\ncould be without life sustaining or comforting services for a long period of time. The resulting\ndamage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the\ngovernment’s ability to safeguard national security interests.\n\nIranian officials have claimed that Stuxnet caused only minor damage to its nuclear program, yet\nthe potential impact of this type of malicious software could be far-reaching. The discovery of the\nStuxnet worm has raised several issues for Congress, including the effect on national security,\nwhat the government’s response should be, whether an international treaty to curb the use of\nmalicious software is necessary, and how such a treaty could be implemented. Congress may also\nconsider the government’s role in protecting critical infrastructure and whether new authorities\nmay be required for oversight.\n\nThis report will be updated as events warrant.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Contents\n\nIntroduction: The Stuxnet Computer Worm .................................................................................1\n\nThe Stuxnet Worm: Possible Developers and Future Users ..........................................................2\n\nIran: The Intended Target?...........................................................................................................3\n\nICS Vulnerabilities and Critical Infrastructure.............................................................................6\n\nNational Security Implications ....................................................................................................7\n\nIssues..........................................................................................................................................8\n\n### Appendixes\n\nAppendix.

The Stuxnet worm,[3] which was first reported in June 2010 by a security firm in Belarus,\nappears to be the first malicious software (malware) designed specifically to attack a particular\ntype of ICS: one that controls nuclear plants, whether for power or uranium enrichment. The\nmalware attacks and disrupts a Microsoft Windows-based application that is employed by a\nparticular ICS produced by the German company Siemens.[4 ]The worm can be spread through an\nair-gapped network by a removable device, such as a thumb drive, and possibly through\ncomputers connected to the Internet, and it is often capable of remaining hidden from detection. It\nis difficult to determine the geographic origin of the malware, as cyber attackers often employ\nsophisticated methods such as peer-to-peer networking or spoofing IP addresses to obviate\nattribution. Likewise, malware placed on a removable device may contain no signatures that\nwould identify its author. Some security analysts speculate that Stuxnet could have been\ndeveloped by a Siemens insider who had direct access and knowledge of the system; others\ncontend that the code’s sophistication suggests that a nation state was behind the worm’s\ndevelopment, either through proxy computer specialists or a government’s own internal\ngovernment and military capabilities.[5]\n\nTo date, numerous countries are known to have been affected by the Stuxnet worm to varying\ndegrees of disruption in their technology systems. These include Iran, Indonesia, India, Pakistan,\nGermany, China, and the United States. A lack of publicly available information on the damage\ncaused by Stuxnet in these countries makes it difficult to determine the malware’s potency.\n\n1 Information contained in this report is derived from unclassified open source material and discussions with senior\ngovernment officials and industry technology and security experts.\n\n2 Industrial control systems (ICS) assist in the management of equipment found in critical infrastructure facilities. ICSs\ninclude supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and\nProgrammable Logic Controllers (PLC). For additional information on ICS see Guide to Industrial Control Systems,\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, September 2008, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-82/\ndraft_sp800-82-fpd.pdf.\n\n3 A computer worm differs from a virus in that the latter requires user action to set in motion of set of potential harmful\nactivities whereas a worm is self-executable and will burrow its way through an operating system until it reaches its\nintended target.\n\n4 See ESET Technical Report: Stuxnet Under the Microscope, accessed at http://www.eset.com/resources/white-papers/\nStuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf.\n\n5 For more information on the technical details of Stuxnet, including its discovery, possible origin, level of\nsophistication, and breadth, see Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, and Eric Chien, W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.1,\nSymantec, accessed at http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/\nw32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Stuxnet Worm: Possible Developers and Future Users\n\nIn attempting to assess the Stuxnet worm’s potential targets and ascertain how best to identify and\nslow progress of its spread to other ICSs, numerous researchers have speculated as to the identity\nof the software code’s developer. To date, no country or group has claimed responsibility for\ndeveloping what has been termed by some as “the world’s first precision guided cybermunition.”[6]\nGiven the Stuxnet worm’s reported technical sophistication, numerous researchers and media\noutlets have speculated that a government most likely produced it. According to these accounts,\nthe developer had to be financially well-resourced, employ a variety of skill sets (including\nexpertise in multiple technology areas), have an existing foreign intelligence capability in order to\ngain access and knowledge of a foreign system, and be able to discretely test the worm in a\nlaboratory setting. Moreover, states appear to possess a motive to develop Stuxnet because, unlike\nother forms of malware, the worm is not designed to steal information, but rather to target and\ndisrupt control systems and disable operations.[7 ]Countries thought to have the expertise and\nmotivation of developing the Stuxnet worm include the United States, Israel, United Kingdom,\nRussia, China, and France.[8]\n\nIn addition to speculating on the developer’s identity, observers have formulated theories about\nthe worm’s intended purpose. For example, some argue that Stuxnet’s developer may not have\nintended the worm to spread beyond its desired target, thus bringing unwarranted attention to this\nemerging cyber capability.[9] Furthermore, it is likely the developer did not consider the unintended\nconsequence of the worm becoming widely available and subject to manipulation to make it less\nidentifiable and more potent.\n\nA terrorist organization intent on carrying out attacks on a nation’s critical infrastructure may also\nbe interested in targeting a type of ICS known as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) systems. It is widely believed that terrorist organizations do not currently posses the\ncapability or have made the necessary arrangements with technically savvy organizations to\ndevelop a Stuxnet-type worm. However, the level of attention the Stuxnet worm has received\ncreates a possible proliferation problem and what some have termed a “cyber arms race.”[10] The\nStuxnet code itself is now freely available on the Internet, as are the particular vulnerabilities it\nexploits, as well as the web addresses of unsecured SCADA systems.[11] As software developers\n\n6 Hunting an Industrial-Strength Computer Virus Around the Globe, PBS Newshour, October 1, 2010,\nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec10/computervirus_10-01.html.\n\n7 Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, and Eric Chien, W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.1, Symantec, accessed at\nhttp://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\n\n8 Theories Mount That Stuxnet Worm Sabotaged Iranian Nuke Facilities, Forbes online, September 22, 2010,\nhttp://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/09/22/theories-mount-that-stuxnet-worm-sabotaged-iranian-nukefacilities/.\n\n9 Each of the Nations mentioned as a possible developer of the Stuxnet worm have, to varying degrees, had industrial\ncontrol systems in their country affected.\n\n10 Warwick Ashford, “Stuxnet worm is prototype for cyber-weapon, say security experts,” Computer Weekly,\nSeptember 24, 2010.\n\n11 SCADA systems can be located via public search engine, says the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency\nResponse Team, InfoSecurity.com, November 3, 2010, http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/13690/scadasystems-can-be-located-via-public-search-engine-says-cert/.\n\n\n-----\n\noften revise and reformulate existing code, Stuxnet’s design revelations may make it easier for\nterrorist organizations to develop such capabilities in the future. Melissa Hathaway, former Acting\nSenior Director for Cyberspace for the National Security and Homeland Security Councils, was\nrecently quoted as saying, “Proliferation [of cyber weapons] is a real problem, and no country is\nprepared to deal with it. All of these [computer security] guys are scared to death. We have about\n90 days to fix this [new vulnerability] before some hacker begins using it.”[12]\n\nIt is also worth noting that, in the future, a non-state actor may not necessarily need to possess\nthe Stuxnet code in order to use the worm. Cybercrime organizations have been said to “rent”\nnetworks of infected computers, known as “botnets,” for use in politically motivated cyber\nattacks on government websites and computer networks. It may become possible for\norganizations to develop and either rent or sell malware such as Stuxnet or access to infected\ncomputers for malicious use against government or civilian infrastructure. In addressing concerns\nabout threats emanating from cyberspace from a variety of potential actors, Deputy Defense\nSecretary William J. Lynn III noted, “Once the province of nations, the ability to destroy via\ncyber means now also rests in the hands of small groups and individuals: from terrorist groups to\norganized crime, hackers to industrial spies to foreign intelligence services.”[13]\n\nEarly reports indicated that the intended target of Stuxnet may have been SCADA-controlled\nnuclear facilities in Iran that used the Siemens product.[14] If a country developed Stuxnet and the\ntarget was a single country’s infrastructure, the worm’s spread to multiple countries has\nimplications for the lack of precision targeting of cyber weapons, their unknown secondary and\ntertiary effects, and for the rules of engagement for responding to a cyber attack.\n\n## Iran: The Intended Target?\n\nIran has apparently suffered the most attacks by the Stuxnet worm and, as noted, may well have\nbeen its main target. A September 2010 study by Symantec argued that the “concentration of\ninfections in Iran likely indicates that this was the initial target for infections and was where\ninfections were initially seeded.”[15] As of September 25, 2010, Iran had identified “the IP\naddresses of 30,000 industrial computer systems” that had been infected by Stuxnet, according to\nMahmoud Liaii, director of the Information Technology Council of Iran’s Industries and Mines\nMinistry, who argued that the virus “is designed to transfer data about production lines from our\nindustrial plants” to locations outside of Iran.[16]\n\nIranian officials have indicated that the worm infected computers associated with the country’s\nnuclear power plant under construction near Bushehr. Dr. Mohammad Ahmadian, an Iranian\nAtomic Energy Organization official, stated in October that the worm may have been transferred\n\n12 John Markoff, “A Silent Attack, but Not a Subtle One,” The New York Times, September 26, 2010.\n\n13 Cybersecurity Poses Unprecedented Challenge to National Security, Lynn Says, U.S. Department of Defense,\nAmerican Forces Press Service, June 15, 2009, http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=54787.\n\n14 Gregg Keizer, “Iran confirms massive Stuxnet infection of industrial systems,” Computerworld, September 25, 2010.\n\n15 Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, and Eric Chien, W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Symantec Security Response, September\n2010, p. 7.\n\n16 “Iran Confirms Cyber Attack, Says Engineers ‘Rooting Out’ Problem,” Mehr News Agency, September 25, 2010. Ali\nAkbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, stated in an interview published October 8 that the\norganization “became aware” of the worm as early as July.\n\n\n-----\n\nto computers at the reactor site via “CDs and Flash memory sticks,” adding that the affected\ncomputers have since been “inspected and cleaned up.”[17] Some of those responsible for\ntransferring the worm were “foreign experts who had been frequenting industrial centres,” Iran’s\nminister of communication Reza Taqipur stated in October.[18] Iranian officials have indicated that\nthe reactor, which is not yet operational, has not been affected by Stuxnet.[19] Olga Tsyleva, presssecretary of the Atomstroyeksport, the Russian contractor for the Bushehr project, confirmed\nOctober 5, 2010, that the worm had spread to the Bushehr facility’s computers but had not caused\nany damage.[20]\n\nIn addition to Liaii’s description of Stuxnet’s purpose, reports of the Stuxnet infections in Iran\nhave, as noted, fueled speculation that the virus was part of an effort by some countries, including\nthe United States and Israel, to sabotage Tehran’s nuclear programs. In addition to the Bushehr\nreactor, Iran has constructed both a pilot and a commercial gas centrifuge-based uranium\nenrichment facility near Natanz.[ 21] Tehran continues enrichment operations at the Natanz\nfacilities, according to a November 23, 2010, report by International Atomic Energy Agency\nDirector-General Yukiya Amano.[22] Uranium enrichment can produce fuel for nuclear reactors, but\ncan also produce fissile material for use in nuclear weapons.\n\nIran’s uranium enrichment facilities seem to be a more likely target for a cyber attack than does\nthe Bushehr reactor. Mark Fitzpatrick, former acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, argued in September that such an attack would not make sense because the reactor\nis not a prime proliferation concern, the Financial Times reported.[23] Iranian officials have\nthemselves indicated that the Bushehr reactor may not have been the worm’s only target. For\nexample, an October 5 statement from Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast\nappeared to reference Iran’s uranium enrichment program.[24] Moreover, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head\nof Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, suggested September 29 that “enemies” had attempted to\ninfect nuclear facilities other than Bushehr.[25] More recently, some experts have argued that,\nbecause Stuxnet was designed to manipulate equipment used in centrifuge facilities, the worm\nmay have been developed to sabotage Iran’s enrichment plant.[26] Whether the Natanz facility\ncontains Siemens components that would be affected by the virus is unclear.

Although, as noted, some Iranian officials\nhave stated that the Bushehr reactor was not affected, some accounts suggest that the malicious\nsoftware may have slowed down or disabled operations at Iran’s enrichment facilities. For\nexample, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said of the cyber attack that unnamed\nperpetrators “were able to cause minor problems with some of our centrifuges by installing some\nsoftware in electronic parts. They did wrong. They misbehaved but fortunately, our experts\ndiscovered it.”[27] Moreover, an unnamed “senior diplomat” suggested that Stuxnet may have\ncaused Iran to shut down its commercial centrifuge facility for a few days in November 2010,\nReuters reported November 23.[28]\n\nIranian officials have attributed the Stuxnet infections to a cyber attack, with some suggesting that\nWestern countries are responsible. For example, Mahmoud Liaii characterized the worm as part\nof an “electronic war [that] has been launched against Iran.”[29] Additionally, Mehmanparast\nsuggested October 5 that the “West” is taking “steps and efforts to use every possible means to\nprevent the peaceful nuclear activities of our country.”[30] An October 20 Open Source Center\nanalysis, however, observed that Iranian officials have “largely remained vague” about Stuxnet’s\n“target, intent, and origin.”[31]\n\nThere have been previous allegations of efforts by the United States and other governments,\nincluding Israel, to sabotage Iran’s centrifuge program. The New York Times reported in January\n2009 that such efforts have included “undermin[ing] electrical systems, computer systems and\nother networks on which Iran relies,” according to unnamed senior U.S. and foreign government\nofficials.[32] One effort involved foreign intelligence services sabotaging “individual power units\nthat Iran bought in Turkey” for Tehran’s centrifuge program. “A number of centrifuges blew up,”\naccording to the Times.[33] Western governments have reportedly made other efforts to sabotage\ncentrifuge components destined for Iran, according to some non-governmental experts.[34]\nAdditionally, New York Times reporter James Risen wrote in 2006 that, according to unnamed\nU.S. officials, the United States engaged in a covert operation to provide Iran with flawed\nblueprints for a device designed to trigger a nuclear explosion.[35]\n\n27 “Wikileaks Revelations ‘Worthless’, ‘Intelligence Game’ - Iran President,” Islamic Republic of Iran News Network,\nNovember 29, 2010.\n\n28 Fredrik Dahl and Sylvia Westall, “Technical Woes Halt Some Iran Nuclear Machines – Dips,” Reuters, November\n23, 2010.\n\n29 _Mehr News Agency, September 25, 2010._\n\n30 _Islamic Republic of Iran News Network, October 5, 2010._\n\n31 “Iran—Officials Characterize Stuxnet as ‘Cyber War,’ Maintain Ambiguity About Virus,” Open Source Center,\nOctober 20, 2010.\n\n32 David E.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) categorizes 18 critical infrastructure\nsectors as “essential to the nation’s security, public health and safety, economic vitality, and way\nof life.”[37] The advent of the Stuxnet virus has raised questions on the vulnerabilities of national\ncritical infrastructure. In the absence of specific information on the full impact of Stuxnet, one\ncan speculate that all these sectors may be at risk.\n\nMany observers fear that a successful infiltration and attack could degrade or stop the operation\nof a critical infrastructure facility that delivers water, gas, or other essential utility, or affect\nmultiple facilities due to the interdependent nature of the nation’s infrastructure sectors\nresponsible for providing essential services. Sean McGurk, the Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s Acting Director of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center\nstated during a November 2010 hearing, “We have not seen this coordinated effort of information\ntechnology vulnerabilities and industrial control exploitation completely wrapped up in one\nunique package. To use a very overused term, it is a game-changer.”[38] Unclassified reports\nsuggest that the Stuxnet worm was specifically developed to seek out and exploit vulnerabilities\nin software that manages ICSs found in most critical infrastructure facilities. One type of ICS, a\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system,[39] is a computer that controls\nindustrial processes and infrastructures. SCADA systems can be accessed and managed directly at\ncomputer terminals, either from remote locations that are connected to the control system, or\nthrough the emerging trend of controlling these systems from mobile wireless devices.\n\nIn 2009, DHS conducted an experiment that revealed some of the vulnerabilities to cyber attack\ninherent in the SCADA systems that control power generators and grids. The experiment, known\nas the Aurora Project, simulated a computer-based attack on a power generator’s control system\nthat caused operations to cease.[40] The same vulnerabilities are said to exist in other critical\ninfrastructure, which, if disabled, could both cripple the economy and have physical\nconsequences; an electrical blackout for a prolonged period of time could potentially lead to loss\nof life if essential services were not restored. Yet some experts argue that the cyber threat to\ncritical infrastructure is exaggerated, regardless of the perpetrators’ capabilities.[41] For example,\n\n36 Guide to industrial control security, Department of Commerce, NIST, September 2008, http://csrc.nist.gov/\npublications/drafts/800-82/draft_sp800-82-fpd.pdf.

Cordesman and Justin G. Cordesman, Cyber-Threats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure\n(continued...)\n\n\n-----\n\nalthough the computer systems that control electricity plants could be penetrated by a\nsophisticated hacker, some infrastructure experts argue that the multitude of public and private\ncompanies and the overlapping nature of their operations creates a resiliency that would make\nlong-term and widespread damage implausible.[42] Moreover, the North American power grid is\nsegmented into four large regions, reducing the risk of a nation-wide failure. Yet due to their\ninterconnected nature, it is possible that a failure in one system could cause cascading effects\nacross an entire region. An example of this was seen in August 2003, when high-voltage power\nlines in Ohio came in contact with trees, triggering the automatic safety system to disconnect.\nSafety mechanisms of other generators then shut down and severed links between them, causing a\nblackout throughout the northeastern United States and Canada.[43]\n\nExperts offer various recommendations to address the vulnerabilities described above. Some\ninformation security experts advocate mandatory encryption of computer data in SCADAcontrolled utilities transmission and distribution systems. The Department of Energy is\nundertaking research and development efforts to modernize the electric grid with new information\ntechnology and thereby create a so-called “Smart Grid”[44] that will be more prevalent and\naccessible throughout the nation and may also be more secure. However, some security observers\nargue that creating a dependency on ubiquitous computer technologies will increase\nvulnerabilities to hacking, worms, viruses, or other cyber threats, and that a multi-layered,\nredundant network creates a higher level of protection.[45] Another option is to enhance the\nprotection of the physical aspects of the nation’s critical infrastructure, thus mitigating possible\ndamage from a Stuxnet worm type of attack and also better preparing facilities to respond to\nnatural or man-made threats.\n\n## National Security Implications\n\nWhether it is electricity, telecommunications, transportation, or other essential services, many\nfederal government activities rely on critical infrastructures that are predominately owned and\noperated by the private sector, which has an expectation of immediately accessible and fully\noperational use of these resources. Should the ICS of a critical infrastructure facility become\naffected by a Stuxnet worm or similar malicious code, disruptions could hamper the government’s\nability to provide domestic and international security, safety, and essential services for lengthy\nperiods of time. Such an occurrence could also degrade the government’s ability to pursue or\nmaintain national security goals and thereby make the nation more vulnerable to a variety of\nforeign and domestic threats or contribute to a loss of public confidence in the government.\n\n(...continued)\n_Protection: Defending the U.S. Homeland (Praeger Publishers, 2001), pp. 169-170._\n\n42 Seymour M.

However, some security experts claim that the threat of cyberwar in\ngeneral is exaggerated by security firms and government entities in an effort to procure more\nresources and control over information technology.[46] Yet these claims are not related specifically\nto Stuxnet. In October 2010, Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the European Network\nand Information Security Agency, stated, “Stuxnet is really a paradigm shift, as Stuxnet is a new\nclass and dimension of malware. Not only for its complexity and sophistication ... the fact that\nperpetrators activated such an attack tool can be considered as the ‘first strike,’ i.e. one of the first\norganized, well prepared attack against major industrial resources. This has tremendous effect on\nhow to protect national (critical infrastructure) in the future.”[47] The Stuxnet worm is unique\nbecause the software code appears to have been designed to infiltrate and attack an ICS often\nused by critical infrastructure facilities in order to cause long-term physical damage to them.\nAlthough the full extent of damage caused by Stuxnet is unknown, the potential implications of\nsuch a capability are numerous in that the worm’s ability to identify specific ICSs and wait for an\nopportune time to launch an attack could have catastrophic consequences on nations’ critical\ninfrastructures.\n\n## Issues \n\nThe possibility of this type of cyber threat to national critical infrastructure raises several\nquestions for policymakers. It is said that actions in cyberspace are conducted in milliseconds.\nWhen the consequences of retaliatory actions in cyberspace may be unknown, is an immediate\nresponse required, or a longer, more deliberative process? The lack of clear attribution further\ncomplicates the issue. If a cyber attack appeared to be launched from an unsuspecting neutral\ncountry, it may not be possible to formally engage that country in stopping an attack that is taking\nplace in milliseconds. What authorities should be in place if such an attack were deemed to\nwarrant an immediate response from the affected nation? Is an international treaty or convention\nnecessary to curb proliferation and use of cyber-based weapons? Many arms control treaties are\nbuilt upon inspection, verification, and compliance regimes. As nefarious activities in cyberspace\ndefy geographical boundaries and often attribution, how would such activities be conducted in a\ncyber arms control treaty?\n\nAnother issue raised by Stuxnet is the government’s role in protecting critical infrastructure. Is\nthe Department of Homeland Security equipped to protect national infrastructure? Would new\nauthorities be necessary in order to oversee the defense of privately owned critical infrastructure\nfacilities? What is the military’s role in defending national critical infrastructure from cyber\nattack? What role should intelligence agencies have in monitoring private infrastructure? Is the\nthreat of cyber war exaggerated in order to shift power over the internet to the military and\nintelligence agencies? Is the private sector the first line of defense in the event of a cyber attack\non critical infrastructure? Is new legislation required to standardize and regulate critical\ninfrastructure protection throughout the various sectors?\n\n46 Ryan Singel, “Cyberwar Hype Intended to Destroy the Open Internet,” Wired, March 1, 2010.\n\n47 EU Agency analysis of ‘Stuxnet’ malware: a paradigm shift in threats and Critical Information Infrastructure\nProtection, Press Release initial comment and brief, high level analysis of the recent ‘Stuxnet’ attacks, October 7, 2010,\nhttp://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-agency-analysis-of-2018stuxnet2019-malware-a-paradigm-shiftin-threats-and-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-1.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix.
