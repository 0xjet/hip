Having been in the field for so long, we have witnessed some major changes\nin the cybercrime world’s modus operandi. This report shares our insights into the Russianspeaking cybercrime world and the changes in how it operates that have happened in the\npast five years.\n\nWe overview what kind of attacks are now carried out by cybercriminals and what influenced\nthis change — including such factors as changes in vulnerability market and browser safety.\nWe also review what pushed cybercriminals to transform their operations into the now wellknown malware-as-a-service model — the use of cloud servers, the decreasing relevance of\ncustom malware and the subsequent emergence of small, agile teams. Lastly, we analyze\nthe targets that cybercriminals select these days as opposed to a few years back, the\nreasoning behind them and criminal-to-criminal services offered on the dark web.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this report is primarily focused on cybercriminals that operate on Russian territory,\ncybercriminals rarely restrict themselves to national borders — with ransomware gangs\nbeing a prime example of such cross-border activity. Moreover, trends that are visible in one\ncountry, more often than not resurface in other places and among new cybercriminal gangs.\nThis report attempts to shed light on the changes in cybercriminals’ operations that we deem\nimportant — and actionable.\n\n## Incident analysis\n\nKaspersky’s Computer Incident Investigations Department specializes in attacks by\nRussian-speaking and Russia-based cybercriminals. The services we offer include incident\nanalysis, investigation and post-incident expert support, all directed at preventing and\nmitigating the consequences of cyberattacks.\n\nBack in 2016, the primary focus of our expert was on major cybergangs that targeted\n[financial institutions, banks in particular. Big names such as Lurk, Buhtrap,](https://securelist.com/lurk-banker-trojan-exclusively-for-russia/75040/) [Metel, RTM,](https://securelist.com/apt-style-bank-robberies-increase-with-metel-gcman-and-carbanak-2-0-attacks/73638/)\nFibbit and [Carbanak boldly terrorized banks nationwide, yet eventually fell apart or ended up](https://securelist.com/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/68732/)\nbehind bars — with our help too. Others cybercriminal groups, such as Cerberus, left the\ngame and shared their source code with the world.\n\nThese days, the industries under attack are not limited to financial institutions, while major\nattacks like those we investigated back in the day thankfully are no longer possible. On top of\nthat, due to changes in legislation that limited financial institutions in hiring external services,\nthe number of cases we investigated for financial industry clients in 2020 was zero.\n\nWe investigated 200 cases for clients in Russia in 2020, and already over 300 in the first\nnine months of 2021. The industries affected included everything from IT to retail, from oil\nand gas to healthcare. This is a surprising trend, as one would expect COVID-19 and the\nmove to remote working to have prompted more computer incidents. But our visibility\nshowed otherwise.\n\n## Key trends\n\nThe cybercriminal ecosystem has always consisted of various roles. The main constants in\nthis system are the infrastructure needed for carrying out cybercriminal activity and the\ninstruments used for this activity. The roles of people in the game directly depend on the\ninfrastructure and the instruments — and these have changed. Let’s delve into some of the\nmajor shifts that have taken place in the cybersecurity sphere in the past five years and see\nhow they have transformed the way Russian-speaking cybercriminals operate.\n\n### Client-side attacks on the wane\n\n\n-----\n\nIt may be hard to imagine these days, but just five years ago to get your computer infected\nwith a Trojan was as easy as visiting a news website. In fact, a lot of malware in Russia was\ndistributed “straight from the front page” — via news platforms and other legitimate websites.\nTrue, web attacks are not a thing of the past yet, but with increasing browser security, attacks\nvia this vector have become much harder. Previously, many cybercriminals lived simply by\ndistributing exploits via legitimate websites. A whole market was built around that process —\nwith dedicated staff to make it roll.\n\nAt the time, browsers were full of vulnerabilities, offered bad user experience and were\ngenerally insecure. Many used browsers that they were accustomed to, not browsers of\nchoice, or default browsers set by organizations, such as the Internet Explorer. Attacks via\nplugins, such as Adobe Flash, Silverlight and Java, were also among the easiest and most\noften used ways to infect user devices — and now they are a thing of the past.\n\nIn 2021, browsers are much safer, with some of them updating automatically, without any\nuser participation, while browser developers continually invest in vulnerabilities assessment.\nFurthermore, with the development of numerous bug-bounty programs, it has become easier\nto sell discovered vulnerabilities to developers themselves, rather than look for a buyer on\nthe dark web. That also led to higher prices for vulnerabilities.\n\nWith safer browsers, web infections have become more challenging and, ultimately,\nunattractive to cybercriminals. As a result, targeting regular rather than corporate users with\nsuch means has become too expensive and not commercially viable.\n\n### Vulnerabilities market got a remake\n\nApplications have become more complex, their architecture better. This has radically\nchanged the way Russian-speaking cybercriminals operate.\n\nWith vulnerabilities rising in price, client-side operations have become extremely difficult and\nexpensive. Client-side infections used to rely heavily on vulnerabilities; entire teams would\nlook for them and write exploits for particular vulnerabilities — adjusted for different operating\nsystems. Most often, cybercriminals exploited 1-day vulnerabilities — they examined\ndevelopers’ patches recently rolled out and wrote exploits for vulnerabilities that were closed.\nHowever, since the software update period was (and still is) quite long, users often updated\ntheir devices with a delay, therefore leaving a window during which cybercriminals could\ninfect quite a few victims.\n\nA typical infection chain looked like this: a legitimate website was compromised — just five\nyears ago securing websites wasn’t really the done thing. It could be compromised directly or\nby hacking the account of someone with access to the website management. The attacker\nwould integrate some piece of code — it could be a window on the page, invisible to the\nuser. Then, since the target would continue to use the website, it would also load the page\ncontrolled by the attackers. Another option was to compromise a banner network — with\n\n\n-----\n\nbanners being available across myriad sites and the website management not having a vote\non what ad was displayed. It was also possible to simply buy and direct traffic to a specific\nmalicious page. Ultimately, the goal was to covertly lead the user to a page controlled by the\nattackers, with this page containing code that would exploit one of the vulnerabilities in the\nuser’s browser.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_This browser attack chain, popular in 2016, is no longer possible_**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo ensure more users were infected, cybercriminal groups developed exploit kits for specific\nuser groups and tailored exploits downloaded to victims’ devices. After running the exploit,\nthe attackers would choose a specific payload to be downloaded to the infected device. The\npayload usually resulted in remote access to the computer. Once infected, the device would\nbe assessed based on how attractive it was to the cybercriminals. After that, the attackers\nwould load a specific exploit that would assess the interest of the infected device, and then a\nspecific malware was uploaded to it (if the victim was interesting at all).\n\nWith such browser attacks being no longer viable, nor easy to execute, a whole array of\ndifferent players were no longer in demand. This included groups that specialized in\npurchasing and directing traffic to specific pages with exploits, groups that developed and\nsold exploit packs, groups that purchased access to specific devices (the latter still exist,\nalbeit they sell it to different players now).\n\nOf course, vulnerabilities in client-side software remained — just now they are not in\nbrowsers, but in various types of documents such as PDF or Word with Macros options\ntypically distributed via email. Still, this change makes attacks and the infection process\nmuch harder. Unlike with browser infections, when distributing a malicious file hidden in a\nPDF or Word, the attacker is not able to receive feedback from the victim or additional\ninformation about the device the target uses. Browsers, on the other hand, reported what\nversions of software and plugins they have automatically. This way, with attackers switching\nto distributing malicious files via phishing emails, it has become more difficult to track the\nversion of the user’s software, or how far the attack went. On top of that, safety mechanisms\nin email servers and in applications such as Word also made it harder to carry out an\ninfection — many emails containing malicious files are not intercepted before they get to the\ntarget, while users receive regular warnings inside applications about potentially dangerous\nattachments.\n\n## Cloud servers for all\n\n### Infrastructure is needed for communication and data storage.\n\nAs organizations progress in the adoption of new IT-services, so do cybercriminals who\nfollow the same trends and changes. Moving to cloud services instead of regular servers has\nfreed their hands. Before, cybercriminals would rent the servers — quite legitimately, albeit\noften not under their own names. In 2016, complaints against servers that were connected to\nsuspicious activities were easier to ignore — at the time, some organizations offered bulletproof servers that would ignore user complaints. However, as time went by, managing such\nservers has become harder and less profitable — a result of greater interest in cybercrime\non the part of local authorities.\n\n\n-----\n\nCybercriminals also used to hack into servers of organizations to use them as relay servers\nto throw investigators off the scent and make it harder to trace the main C&C center.\nSometimes cybergangs would store some information — for instance, data extracted from\nvictims— on servers they had compromised. This sort of structure with data being spread\nover various platforms required dedicated staff to manage it.\n\nThe adoption of cloud servers made life easier for cybercriminals — now, if multiple\ncomplaints resulted in the suspension of an account, moving the data to a new server was a\ntwo-minute job. It also meant that the teams no longer needed a dedicated admin to manage\nthe server — this task was outsourced to the cloud server provider.\n\n### Malware developers — no longer hiring\n\nPerhaps the scariest trend of all is how easy it has become for cybercriminals to gain access\nto new effective malware. While APT actors continue to invest large funds and resources into\ntailor-made malicious tools, cybercriminals choose the easier, less costly way, which no\nlonger includes developing their own malware or exploits.\n\nOpen-source malware is appearing on the dark web more and more often — it has become a\ntrend for established cybergangs to release their source code to the public for free, making it\nfairly easy for new players to start their cybercriminal activity. The developers of Cerberus, a\nbanking Trojan, released the source code of their malware in October 2020, while Babuk, the\ndeveloper of the infamous ransomware of the same name, had their ransomware code\nreleased early in September 2021.\n\nTo make matters worse, with the development of penetration-testing tools and services, the\ndark market saw the rise of new malicious tools. These tools are developed and used for\nlegitimate services, such as assessing clients’ security infrastructure and potential for\nsuccessful network penetration. They are meant to be sold to a carefully selected client base\nthat would only use them for legitimate purposes. Yet, inevitably, these tools eventually end\nup in the hands of cybercriminals. One of the most notable examples is cybercriminals’\nfavorite CobaltStrike, a decompiled version of which was leaked in November 2020 — and is\nnow seen in active use by both cybercriminals and APT groups. Others include Bloodhound,\nanother favorite cybercriminal tool for network mapping, Kali and Commando VM for\nspecialized distribution, Core Impact and Metaspoit Framework for exploiting vulnerabilities,\nuse of netscan.exe (softPerfect Network Scanner) on compromised computers, and\nlegitimate services for remote access, such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk and RMS/LMS. To top\nit off, cybercriminals make use of legitimate services that are meant to help system\nadministrators, such as PSexec, which allows remote execution of programs.\nUnderstandably, such tools have risen in popularity since the pandemic and the consequent\nrise in remote working.\n\n_These days, to understand what kind of tools cybercriminals use, it is enough to see what_\n_pen-testers deploy and offer on the market._\n\n\n-----\n\nEssentially, the malware development market has reached its maturity stage. Given the\nabundance of information, starting a cybercriminal operation is easier than ever before. At\nthe same time, it has become more difficult to attack companies. Protection systems do not\nstand still; awareness is growing. The pen-testing market, too, exists due to the demand for\nit, with large organizations investing in making their networks safer.\n\n## The results\n\n### Optimizing the chain — smaller teams\n\nThese structural shifts (rising vulnerabilities costs, moving to cloud servers, accessibility of\nalready developed advanced offensive tools) has led to cybergangs shrinking. Essentially,\nthe attack chain has been optimized with many roles having been outsourced, and teams\nbecoming more agile.\n\nSystem administrators that take care of physical networks are no longer needed — with\ncloud services management being an easy task. Cybercriminal gangs have also essentially\nput a stop to developing their own malicious software. If before, large cybercriminal groups\nwould invest in their own malware and therefore staff at the very least two developers to work\non different parts of the malware (for instance client and server side), now they only need an\noperator. If developers are not needed, neither are testers. The long attack chain that\nincluded exploits for different vulnerabilities has also shrunk — and so exploit writers that\nfocused on client side have been put out of business.\n\nBuying traffic for malicious sites has transformed into buying data — access to different\norganizations, account information, etc. These services, too, have been outsourced.\n\nAs a result, for a successfully running operation in 2021, a cybergang needs management,\nmalware operators, specialists in gaining network access and financial specialists that take\ncare of extracting and cashing out the stolen funds.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Then and now: a comparison of how cybercrime groups looked in 2016 vs 2021_**\n\nWe are yet to see what will happen to those cybercriminals who were jailed in 2016-2017\nand will be released into a world where their skillsets are no longer in demand. It is hard to\ntell whether they will settle for an honest path, but if not, there are no vacancies for them in\nthe current dark cybermarket.\n\n### Change of targets\n\nThe year 2016 saw banks in Russia hacked one after another. It was also a time when\nregular users had their devices infected and goods stolen. As time went by, and big gangs\nthat targeted financial institutions were ambushed, Russian-speaking cybercriminals\nswitched to other industries, attacking both large and small businesses. By 2018, however,\nthey had realized that it is far more profitable to target organizations — with ransomware,\nstealers or remote access tools for conducting financial operations from within the networks.\n\nIn 2020, we witnessed a drop in cases against financial institutions in Russia. Incidents that\nincluded banking software pretty much left the stage. There were a few reasons for this: new\nlocal financial security regulations and enhanced banking security. But, most importantly,\ncybercriminals switched to targets in the West. We cannot confirm that the operators of\nattacks against financial institutions are the same people that now operate in ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\ngangs, yet it is safe to assume that cybercriminals who had been put out of a job switched to\nnew, juicier targets. We did a separate review of the Russian-language ransomware\necosystem earlier this year, so we will not go in length about them here.\n\nWestern organizations are chosen by cybercriminals not for ideological reasons. First,\norganizations located in Europe and the US have more funds, and the potential for profit is\nhigher than in the case of infecting a Russian company. For instance, for international\ncompanies, ransom demands start from 700 thousand USD and can go up to 7 million USD.\nWhen attacking Russian organizations, the ransomware gangs start their demands from 100\nthousand. On average, ransomware operators end up getting a ransom ranging from 50 to\n100 thousand USD. Widespread use of English also makes companies more susceptible to\nattacks.\n\nAt the same time, the shift to the West does not mean that Russian companies are no longer\nbeing attacked from within the country. Criminals are still mostly limited by linguistic\nconstraints — it is much easier to prepare phishing emails and documents in their native\nlanguage. This is the only advantage of Russian-speaking hackers when attacking Russian\ncompanies. Such choice of targets, however, entails higher risks for the cybercriminals — the\nlikelihood of them being discovered and arrested is greater.\n\nIndustry-wise, cybercriminals are no longer limited to financial institutions. The advent of\nbotnets created a market of network access — companies from all types of industries are\nbroken into without particular targeting, and access to them is later sold off on the dark web.\nThe pandemic also played a role in boosting it, with companies moving much of their\ninfrastructure online and opening it up to remote workers, leading to a wider attack surface\nand more ways to hack into otherwise better-protected networks. Quite often, ransomware\noperators go for the low-hanging fruit — companies that are easiest to break into and get\nsome profit off. Another big focus is organizations and users that possess or operate\ncryptocurrency — cryptoexchanges, cryptowallets and others are among the juicy targets.\n\nSome trends and attacks are purely local and tied to the Russian language. For instance,\nsomewhat surprisingly, since 2019 vishing (voice phishing, i.e. phone scams) has enjoyed a\nrenaissance. Russia’s mature mobile banking industry coupled with IP-telephone\ntechnologies made it very easy and profitable to set up hard-to-trace call centers that scam\nregular users out of their money. As a result, the damage for regular Russian users amounts\nto about 1 billion rubles (13.8 million USD) monthly.\n\n### Services in demand\n\nThe world of dark-web marketplaces has also transformed. While, indeed, there still are a\nfew popular platforms where cybercriminals can meet and offer their services, serious\nplayers are moving more and more to the shadows. A prime example of that is ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\noperators, who have been expelled from popular dark-web platforms due to the heightened\ninterest in their activities. Now, they tend to communicate privately. The availability of secure\nmessengers also played a role, as cybercriminals connect directly, not via forums.\n\nWe no longer see vulnerabilities or exploits for sale on the dark web, as truly valuable\nvulnerabilities, such as 0-day ones, are rare and sold directly to select customers, while 1day vulnerabilities are sold to agencies that specialize in them.\n\nStill, many services remain in demand on the dark web and offers for them can still be found\nwithout much effort. Let’s go over the key services cybercriminals use:\n\n**Ready-made accounts — using online services such as clouds requires**\ncybercriminals to have emails and phone numbers, and for obvious reasons making\ntheir own is not safe enough. Prepaid SIM cards are illegal in Russia — all users must\nregister SIM cards to their ID. Therefore, emails bundled with phone numbers are\nalways in demand.\n**Access to logins — besides the regular phone+email combination, cybercriminals**\noffer stolen credentials for all types of accounts — from gaming and streaming\naccounts to banking and other services. These credentials can be used for a whole\nvariety of activities — from scams to extraction of funds.\n**Access to organizations — perhaps the most attractive type of offer. Many operators**\nspecialize solely in infecting networks en masse via botnets or through exploiting 1-day\nvulnerabilities. Having gained access to a company network, they assess the\nattractiveness of the company and sell access to other cybercriminals, who then work\non harvesting or encrypting the company’s data.\n**DDoS attacks — still in demand, albeit protection against DDoS attacks has become**\nstronger.\n**Personal data — the amount of personal data available on the dark web continues to**\ngrow and diversify. The types of data have moved from card or ID data to rarer types,\nsuch as medical information or full access to banking accounts. The price of this data\nstarts as low as 0.5 USD per item. We covered the type of data available on the dark\n[web in our previous report.](https://securelist.com/dox-steal-reveal/99577/)\n\n## Conclusion: cybersecurity and cybercrime have matured\n\nA few years back, the digital market was being tested by cybercriminals; radically new ways\nof attacking users and organizations were being developed on a regular basis. Now, in 2021,\nwe have reached the point when the cybercriminal world has matured. So has cybersecurity\n— just a few years ago organizations had little understanding of what dangers they face\nonline. Now, after waves of notorious and devastating attacks, people have become more\ncautious, and organizations recognize the potential cyberrisks and invest in mitigating them.\nHere are the main takeaways from this overview of the state of Russian-speaking\ncybercrime:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Information has become more accessible and that includes malware. Malicious**\ntools are available online in abundance — be it leaked or released source code of\ninfamous malware developed by now-gone cybergangs, or legal instruments used for\npen-testing by organizations. This accessibility benefits cybercriminals, as they no\nlonger need to invest time and resources in writing malware from scratch.\n**Cybergangs as we knew them are gone. People in cybercrime are less and less tied**\nto each other, and no longer exist in stable groups that last many years.\n**Cybergangs operate like small businesses that deliver various services. People in**\ncybercrime have become very effective at outsourcing — focusing on purchasing\naccess to hacked organizations and the right tools to exploit that access. They no\nlonger need to write malware, nor take care of physical servers.\n**Russian-speaking cybercrime has also moved across the borders. As the digital**\nworld lacks traditional borders, the limitations of potential targets are dictated by the\nlanguage cybercriminals speak; thus, the English-speaking part of the world will always\nremain appealing. It would be presumptuous to say that back in 2016 Russianspeaking cybercriminals did not attack users abroad, or that they completely ceased to\nattack their fellow nationals. Nevertheless, the clampdown by law enforcement of those\nwho attack organizations within Russia and much higher potential profit from attacks on\ninternational organizations has solidified the “do not work in RU” rule and brought\nRussian-speaking cybercriminals under the spotlight of the international arena.\n**Everyone is a target now. With so many organizations facing the Internet, the attack**\nsurface has grown immensely, and gaining access to organizations has become easier.\nCybercriminals are ready to lay their hands on pretty much any organization, as\nopposed to their past focus on financial organizations. With ransomware, every victim\ncan bring profit to a cybergang.\n**Data remains a valuable asset. The current state of personal data security paints a**\ngloomy picture. Regardless of the current, though significant, efforts made by various\ngovernments, personal data continues to end up online, and used for attacks — be it a\ntool to register a server for a cybergang or a point of access to an organization. This is\nunlikely to change in the near future.\n\nAll in all, the current state of Russian-speaking cybercrime reveals problems in cybersecurity\nof global relevance. In the “shared” cybercriminal economy, tracking specific gangs has\nbecome harder, while the gangs themselves have ceased to be well-defined entities, turning\ninto rather scattered groups of individuals with the right tools, which are easy to access.\nWhat we as cybersecurity experts can do is strive to be a step ahead — and continue to\nbuild defenses, educate people and make cybersecurity front-of-mind for everyone.\n\n[Financial malware](https://securelist.com/tag/financial-malware/)\n[Internet Banking](https://securelist.com/tag/internet-banking/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russian-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/russian-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Trojan Banker](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-banker/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Website Hacks](https://securelist.com/tag/website-hacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nRuslan Sabitov\n\nRussian-speaking cybercrime evolution: What changed from 2016 to 2021\n\nYour email address will not be published.
