One of the group’s most common attack vectors is impersonating journalists, particularly\nthose from the German “Deutsche Welle” broadcasting company and the “Jewish Journal” magazine[1].\n\nStarting July 2020, we have identified a new TTP of the group, impersonating “Deutsche Welle” and the\n“Jewish Journal\" using emails alongside WhatsApp messages as their main platform to approach the\n\ntarget and convince them to open a malicious link. To gain the victim's trust and ensure the opening\n\nof the link, the attackers use fake LinkedIn profiles as well. This is the first time we identified an attack\n\nby Charming Kitten conducted through WhatsApp and LinkedIn, including attempts to conduct phone\ncalls between the victim and the Iranian hackers. Charming Kitten chooses to impersonate Persian\nspeaking journalists, to neutralize detection through accent while having the phone call. In this report,\nwe expose for the first time the full conversation between Charming Kitten to a victim, conducted on\nWhatsApp.\n\nThe malicious link is embedded in a legitimate, compromised \"Deutsche Welle” domain. Each victim\nreceives a personalized link, tailored to their specific email account. We identified an attempt to send\n\na malicious ZIP file to the victim as well, additional to a message that was sent to the victim via a fake\nLinkedIn profile. We assess that in some cases, Charming Kitten would try to infect the victim with\nmalware instead of stealing its credentials.\n\n“Charming Kitten”, also known as APT35 or “Ajax”, is an Iranian cyberespionage group active since\n2014. Their primary targets are Iranian academia experts, human rights' activists, and journalists. In the\npast few months, it seems that Charming Kitten has expanded their target’s list, adding the Baha’i\ncommunity[2], high-ranking American civil servants and officials (including ambassadors and former\nemployees of the US State Department), and COVID-19 related organizations (such as Gilead[3] and\nWHO[4]). In the current campaign, we identified attempts to attack Israeli scholars (targeting their\n\ninstitutional email account), and US government employees.\n\nHere is a timeline of their operations involving “Deutsche Welle” and “Jewish Journal” in the past 3\n\nyears:\n\n1clearskysec.com/charmingkitten/\n2docs.google.com/document/d/1oYX3uN6KxIX_StzTH0s0yFNNoHDnV8VgmVqU5WoeErc/edit#heading=h.1mxv\nns31ypem\n3reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-gilead-iran-ex/exclusive-iran-linked-hackers-recently-targetedcoronavirus-drugmaker-gilead-sources-idUSKBN22K2EV\n4bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/hackers-target-who-by-posing-as-think-tank-broadcaster\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n3 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nClearsky alerted “Deutsche Welle” about the impersonation and the watering hole in their website. A\n“Deutsche Welle” representative confirmed that the reporter which Charming Kitten impersonated, did\nnot send any emails to the victim nor any other academic researcher in Israel in the past few weeks.\nNote that part of \"Deutsche Welle\" reporters are originally from Iran – a fact that helps Charming Kitten\nto hide the accent of their operators during a phone call.\n\nIt should be noted that this attack vector is unique to Charming Kitten, but it has not the only attack\nvector that has been used in recent months by this threat actor. More information about recent\n\ncampaigns by the group can be found in our raw threat intelligence[5] or on our blog[6].\n\n###### Deployment Vector: WhatsApp and LinkedIn\n\nIn recent months, we identify an increase in the use of WhatsApp and LinkedIn as platforms of\n\ncommunication between threat actors and victims. In the last three years, Charming Kitten has been\n\noperating their campaigns mainly by emails and SMS. These two platforms enable the attacker to\n\nreach the victim easily, spending minimum time in creating the fictitious social media profile. However,\n\nin this campaign Charming Kitten has used a reliable, well-developed LinkedIn account to support\ntheir email spear-phishing attacks.\n\nIn this campaign, we observed a willingness of the attackers to speak on the phone directly with the\n\nvictim, using WhatsApp calls, and a legitimate German phone number. This TTP is uncommon and\njeopardizes the fake identity of the attackers (unlike emails for example). However, if the attackers have\n\n5 docs.google.com/document/d/1oYX3uN6KxIX_StzTH0s0yFNNoHDnV8VgmVqU5WoeErc/\n6 clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town-2/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nsuccessfully passed the phone call obstacle, they can gain more trust from the victim, compared to an\nemail message.\n\nCharming Kitten is not the first threat actor who uses WhatsApp phone call in recent months. In\nOperation ‘Dream Job’, which we exposed in August 2020[7], the Lazarus group (North Korea) used the\n\nsame method to gain the victim's trust.\n\n7 clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n5 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attack Vector\n\n Introduction\n\nThis latest campaign of Charming Kitten uses enhanced social engineering techniques already\ndiscovered in our report “The Kittens Are Back in Town” in 2019[8]. In the 2019 scenario, the attackers\n\nhad impersonated a known journalist, almost always from “Deutsche Welle”. In 2020 Charming Kitten\n\noffers the victim to participate in an online webinar/meeting about Iran and other subjects of interest\n\nfor the target (e.g. recent discourse between Iran and the US). The Charming Kitten operators introduce\n\nthemselves as journalists and ask the victim whether they are interested in participating in the webinar.\n\nIf so, they are requested to reply in order to receive the following details:\n\n1. A full list of other participants\n\n2. Date and time for the webinar\n\n3. Details regarding the payment for attending the webinar.\n\nThis attack vector was carried out by Charming Kitten between 2018 to early 2020. Here is an example\nfor the email sent allegedly from Keyarash Navidpour, a reporter in DW, to an Israeli academia scholar[9]:\n\n8 clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/\n9 ru.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZZ1MS\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n6 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, in August 2020 we have identified a change in attack methods, which will be presented in\ndetail in the following chapter.\n\n###### Social Engineering Methods Used to Establish a Credible Communication \n\n First stage – approaching the victim by email\n\nIn most of the cases that we handled in the past several months, the targeted academia researchers\n\nhad high awareness and suspected that they are probably under an Iranian attack. Their suspicion led\n\nthem to contact us and further contact with Charming Kitten under our guidance (i.e. not opening the\n\nemails sent to them). Over the course of the past several weeks, one of the targets was lured to respond\n\nto the attackers. The subject of impersonation was an Iranian journalist that speaks fluent Farsi with a\nlocal accent.\n\nThe correspondence begun with an email sent to the target, initiating a conversation. Unlike previous\n\nattacks, the attackers did not display details regarding the alleged webinar; instead, they asked to start\n\na conversation.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to contact Israeli researchers from Haifa and Tel Aviv Universities' email\n\naddresses, hosted on a Microsoft email server (Outlook).\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n7 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nIn another case, the attacker impersonated an Israeli scholar from Tel Aviv University and invited them\nto an alleged \"Zoom\" meeting in Hebrew.\n\nAfter a short conversation with the target, the Charming Kitten attacker requests, for the first time, to\n\nmove the conversation to WhatsApp. This is not the first use of a mobile messaging service (for instance\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n8 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nphishing using SMS), but the first case where we have seen the use of WhatsApp. If the target refuses\nto move to WhatsApp, the attacker will send a message via a fake LinkedIn profile. Here’s an example\nof “Marcy Oster” – a fake profile used by the Iranians in their attack.\n\nTo convince the victim to join the alleged webinar, the attackers tried to entice the victim with\nnominating them as its main speaker, chosen from more than a hundred participants. They claimed\nthat further information about the alleged webinar will be shared after approving the invitation. The\n\nsubject of the webinar is changed by Charming Kitten from one victim to another, based on their\n\nexpertise.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n9 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Second Stage – WhatsApp and LinkedIn\n\nAfter this conversation with the target, the attacker requests that they switch to WhatsApp for further\nconversation.\n\nCharming Kitten sent multiple and repeating messages, sometimes in very short time, until the target\nresponded. The messages were sent from a German number (prefix +49) to create a sense of credibility,\n\nand the WhatsApp account bears the image of the journalist being impersonated. Unlike other groups,\n\nCharming Kitten chooses to impersonate Persian speaking journalists, to neutralize detection through\n\nthe accent.\n\nHere is the full correspondence (names redacted):\n\nMessage Content Author\n\nFirst Day\n\nHi.\nDear Dr. *******\nMay I have a minute of your time?\n\nAttacker\n\nDear Dr. *******\nI am Yalda Zarbakhch from Deutsche Welle\nAttempt at a voice call\n\nSecond Day\n\nDear Dr. *******\nAttacker\nI am Yalda Zarbakhch from Deutsche Welle\n\nThird Day\n\nDear Dr. ******* Attacker\n\nHi Yalda.

During our investigation, we addressed DW,\nwhich confirmed that the reporter never contacted the victim and that the alleged webinar is fake. The\nwebinar’s subjects were previously used by the group as lures. In May 2020, for example, the group\nimpersonated the INSS and lured victims to a webinar regarding China-related research.\n\nIf the victim is not willing to share their personal phone number, the attacker will send him a message\n\nfrom the fake LinkedIn account. This message will contain a promise that the webinar is secured by\n\nGoogle, as they sent to the victim on the tenth day:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n12 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Third Stage – Approving attending in the webinar\n\nThe malicious link was on the Deutsche Welle legitimate domain (dw[.]de). As previously reported in\n“The Kittens are Back in Town”. Each victim receives a personalized link for their own email address –\nthe word “?id=”, following by the word SSH and 3 sets of 5 letters and numbers.

Accessing the\nOutlook page displays a fictitious log-in field including a victim-specific URI:\n\nThe Clearsky impersonation from 2018 presented the same phishing page (we identify in the fake\n\nwebsite a page impersonated Jewish Journal as well). Both cases included a file named lgntopl.gif on\n\nthe domain, characterizing Outlook phishing pages.

A wrong password\nproduces an error message. The attackers will then pressure the victim to try again using their\nuniversity email.\n\nThis propagation vector is unique compared to other, common vectors by the group (such as \".site\"\nTLD phishing websites), and the WhatsApp correspondence has not been exposed until this case.\n\n11 citizenlab.ca/2015/08/iran_two_factor_phishing/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n15 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malicious file\n\nAnother example of a fake LinkedIn account is “Helen Cooper”, a senior researcher at Hudson Institute\n(a think tank and research center dedicated to the analysis of US and international economic, security,\n\nand political issues). Charming Kitten created a fake profile for the attack and deleted the account\n\nlater.\n\nAfter the initial message via the fake LinkedIn profile, Charming Kitten sent the victim two different\n\ntypes of compromise attempts from this account:\n\n1. An email message with a malicious link\n\n2. An email message with a malicious file attached\n\nUnlike the common TTPs of this threat actor, sending an attached malware is unique and was not seen\n\nin recent attacks by them. The victim deleted the file before we were able to analyze it.
