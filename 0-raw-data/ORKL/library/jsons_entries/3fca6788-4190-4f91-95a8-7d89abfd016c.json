At Mandiant, we have been\nanticipating this activity, and we are concerned that, unlike the recent defacements and\ndestructive attacks, future activity will not be restricted to Ukrainian targets or the public\nsector.\n\n## The Scope of Activity\n\nRussia and its allies will conduct cyber espionage, information operations, and disruptive\ncyber attacks during this crisis. Though cyber espionage is already a regular facet of global\nactivity, as the situation deteriorates, we are likely to see more aggressive information\noperations and disruptive cyber attacks within and outside of Ukraine.\n\nRussian cyber espionage actors such as UNC2452, Turla, and APT28, which are tied\nto the Russian intelligence services, have almost certainly already received tasking to\nprovide intelligence around the crisis. These actors already frequently target\ngovernment, military, diplomatic, and related targets worldwide for intelligence that\nbenefits Russia’s foreign policy decision making.\nRussia leverages a multitude of additional cyber espionage operators within the region,\nsuch as TEMP.Armageddon (UNC530), actors who operate out of occupied Crimea\nand Eastern Ukraine.\nInformation operations, such as those involving the creation and dissemination of\nfabricated content and social media manipulation to promote desired narratives, are\nalready happening within the context of the crisis. We continue to see pro-Russia\nactors, and those promoting narratives aligned with Russian interests, regularly\nconduct information operations against NATO allies and partners within Eastern\nEurope.\nNotably, a Ukrainian official has attributed recent defacements of Ukrainian government\n[websites to UNC1151 (an actor we have linked to Belarus), though we cannot confirm](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\nthis attribution. We have previously observed similar activity conducted by GRU-related\nactors Sandworm Team and APT28.\n\n\n-----\n\nDisruptive and destructive cyber attacks are relatively infrequent when compared to\ncyber espionage and other forms of information operations. Sandworm Team is\nRussia’s preeminent cyber attack capability, having conducted complex attacks which\ncaused electrical outages in Ukraine as well as the most expensive destructive attack\nin history: NotPetya. Another actor, who Mandiant calls TEMP.Isotope\n(UNC806/UNC2486 aka Berserk Bear, Dragonfly), has a long history of compromising\ncritical infrastructure in the United States and Europe. While we have never seen this\nactor attempt to disrupt that infrastructure, we believe these breaches are preparation\nfor a contingency when Russia is prepared to cause serious disruptions.\n\n## Information Operations\n\nInformation operations are a regular feature of Russian and Belarusian cyber activity. Such\nactors leverage a variety of tactics to achieve their aims, including but not limited to the use\nof social media campaigns involving coordinated and inauthentic activity, as well as the\ncompromise of entities in hack-and-leak operations or for use in disseminating fabricated\ncontent to promote desired narratives.\n\nBroadly speaking, information operations actors have sought to advance Russian\ninterests by exploiting existing divisions within and between adversary countries,\nundermining confidence in democratic institutions, and creating distrust within the\nNATO alliance, the European Union, and the West.\nFabricated content, such as forged documents, doctored photographs and fake\npetitions, is regularly used in operations we have attributed to influence campaigns,\n[including Ghostwriter and Secondary Infektion.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/ghostwriter-influence-campaign)\nData obtained through intrusion activity has been leaked to great effect, causing\nscandals with lasting consequences. We have observed pro-Russia actors alter or\nfalsify stolen data prior to leaking it, occasionally alongside unaltered data, to support a\ngiven operation’s intended narrative.\nInformation operations actors have used third parties, such as journalists and\n\"hacktivists,” to legitimize information and narratives and launder their content. While\nmany such parties collaborated—wittingly or unwittingly—with those actors, we have\nalso observed campaigns, such as Ghostwriter, supported by the cyber espionage\nactor UNC1151, compromise and leverage legitimate information sources. This\nincludes news or municipal government sites or social media accounts to disseminate\nmaterial.\nRussian information operations campaigns, such as those conducted by the Internet\nResearch Agency, have also created and leveraged inauthentic personas and media\noutlets to publish and promote content disseminating false narratives that serve to\nachieve their ends.\n\n## Cyber Attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nDisruptive and destructive cyber attacks take many forms, from distributed denial-of-service\nattacks to complex attacks on critical infrastructure. Like its peers, Russia leverages this\ncapability in times of crisis.\n\nSuccessful disruptions are often a matter of scale. The most effective disruptions have\nbroad effects. To achieve this, operators can focus on disrupting critical targets with\ndownstream customers and dependencies (such as the Ukrainian electric grid), or\ndirectly disrupt a multitude of targets (as in the case of NotPetya).\nAttacks against critical infrastructure and operational technology networks may take\nmore hands-on work and lead time than other methods. Actors such as TEMP.Isotope\nappear to take a proactive stance towards compromising these targets. As such,\ntargets of this nature may have been compromised well in advance of this crisis for the\npurposes of a contingency such as this. Defenders of these networks should consider\nhunting for actors such as TEMP.Isotope.\nAlternatively, destructive tools and other simpler methods could be leveraged against a\nlarge cohort of targets simultaneously. Typically, Russian actors have used strategic\nweb compromise and the software supply chain to gain access at this scale. Mass\npropagation through these methods may be early warning of impending cyber attack.\nThe perpetrators of attacks often fabricate evidence of culpability or make false\nstatements of responsibility designed to suggest that some other party is responsible\nfor the incident. They plant evidence in code and make public statements that suggest\nincidents were carried out by previously unknown nationalist elements, criminals, or\ngovernment hackers. On multiple occasions, wipers have masqueraded as\nransomware, as in the case of the most recent incident in Ukraine. Though these “false\nflags” are often paper-thin, they complicate efforts to convince the public of attribution\nand make these operations more deniable.\nRansomware is a form of cyber attack that is being used by state affiliated actors as\npart of “lock and leak” campaigns that have dubious financial motivations. Because of\nits mature criminal underground, Russia has unmatched access to this capability. The\nsecurity services have previously leveraged criminal operations for national security\npurposes and could bring them to bear in any number of ways to carry out their\nmission.\nThough destructive attacks observed thus far in this crisis appear to have focused on\ngovernment systems, civilian systems are usually targeted to greatest effect. These\nactors have had particular success targeting utilities, but also by targeting\ntransportation and logistics, finance, and media.\nCyber attacks are most often leveraged as a form of information operation, meaning\nthey are meant to manipulate perception rather than have lasting disruptive effects.\nDefenders often overestimate the technical capability necessary for these actors to\nachieve their goals and underestimate the value of technically simple operations.\n\n## Outlook\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber capabilities are a means for states to compete for political, economic, and military\nadvantage without the violence and irreversible damage that is likely to escalate to open\nconflict. While information operations and cyber attacks such as the 2016 US election\noperations and the NotPetya incident can have serious political and economic\nconsequences, Russia may favor them because they can reasonably expect that these\noperations will not lead to a major escalation in conflict.\n\nMandiant recommends that defenders take proactive steps to harden their networks against\nand has provided a guide to this process, Proactive Preparation and Hardening to Protect\n_Against Destructive Attacks, for free to the public._\n\nFree access to [Mandiant Advantage is also available for qualifying organizations.
