This su password (zyad5001) is\nuseless, as it cannot be used to log into the device.\n\n\n-----\n\nNonetheless, miscreants have discovered that there s a large amount of ZyXEL devices that\nhave shipped to users that are using admin/CentryL1nk and admin/QwestM0dem as default\nTelnet credentials.\n\nThe PoC published last month automates the process of logging into a remote ZyXEL device\nusing one of the two Telnet passwords, and then uses the hardcoded su password to gain\nroot privileges.\n\n## Mirai botnet incorporates recent ZyXEL PoC\n\nThe PoC exploit code had Mirai written all over it the moment it was published online. This is\nbecause Mirai botnets are built by scanning the Internet for devices with exposed Telnet\nports and using a list of default credentials to attempt to log into devices and install the Mirai\nDDoS malware.\n\nStarting on Wednesday, this is exactly what happened. For the past 60 hours, Li says Netlab\nhas detected a spike of scans on ports 23 and 2323, both used for Telnet authentication.\nAttackers are using the above PoC to break into exposed devices and infect them with Mirai.\n\nSuch a massive scan campaign did not go unnoticed. Independent security researcher Troy\nMursch also reported a similar uptick in Mirai activity yesterday.\n\n\n-----\n\n[879 new unique IP addresses were found in the #Mirai-like #botnet on 2017-11-22](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mirai?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThis is an all-time record for the most new unique IP address that I've seen added to\nthe botnet in one day.\n\n[A massive increase of volume from Argentina (@Telefonica) is largely the cause.](https://twitter.com/Telefonica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/c8GBUpKNgW](https://t.co/c8GBUpKNgW)\n\n[— Bad Packets Report (@bad_packets) November 23, 2017](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/933624559483346944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Most new Mirai bots are located in Argentina\n\nAs both Netlab and Mursch have pointed out, most of the infected devices are from\nArgentina, and more precisely from the network of local ISP Telefonica de Argentina.\n\nNetlab says it detected around 100,000 IPs performing these scans in the past 60 hours.\nSince Mirai-infected devices perform the IP scanning and exploitation attempt, this is an\napproximate estimation of the number of bots in this Mirai botnet that's looking for vulnerable\nZyXEL devices.\n\nNetLab says that around 65,700 of these bots were located in Argentina, a clear sign that the\nISP has shipped devices with the default creds included in the public PoC.\n\nThe good news is that Mirai bots do not have a persistence mechanism in place, meaning\nthey are removed when the router reboots. This is why Mirai botnets wildly vary in size from\nday to day, and why botnet herders need to be constantly scanning the Internet to keep their\nbot numbers up.\n\nThis is also not the first time when a Mirai botnet has exploited flaws in one particular ISP's\n[network to grow to a mammoth size. Similar incidents have happened in Germany and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/900-000-routers-knocked-offline-in-germany-amid-rumors-of-cyber-attack/) the\nUK in November and December 2016.\n\nThe hacker behind those incidents deployed faulty Mirai malware versions that eventually\n[brought down Internet services for ISP customers. Law enforcement tracked down, arrested,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-police-arrest-suspect-behind-mirai-malware-attacks-on-deutsche-telekom/)\n[charged, and sentenced the hacker, named BestBuy (also known as Popopret).](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/after-dodging-prison-in-germany-mirai-hacker-bestbuy-charged-in-the-uk/)\n\nThere are no reports that Telefonica users are suffering from Internet connectivity outages,\nmeaning users are not aware their devices are infected with the Mirai malware.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Honeypot experiment reveals what hackers want from IoT devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/honeypot-experiment-reveals-what-hackers-want-from-iot-devices/)\n\n[New EnemyBot DDoS botnet recruits routers and IoTs into its army](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-enemybot-ddos-botnet-recruits-routers-and-iots-into-its-army/)\n\n[Mirai malware now delivered using Spring4Shell exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mirai-malware-now-delivered-using-spring4shell-exploits/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Beastmode botnet boosts DDoS power with new router exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beastmode-botnet-boosts-ddos-power-with-new-router-exploits/)\n\n[Cisco urges admins to patch IOS XR zero-day exploited in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-urges-admins-to-patch-ios-xr-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a few\nmore.
