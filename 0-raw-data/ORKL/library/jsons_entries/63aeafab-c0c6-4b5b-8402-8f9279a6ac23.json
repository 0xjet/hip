This group** **have been found across eleven** **aims to gather intelligence to**\noverlaps with UAC-0063, which **countries, mostly in Central Asia,** **support Russia’s war in Ukraine**\nCERT-UA has attributed with moderate targeting government, human rights, and monitor geopolitical events\n\n\n-----\n\n_Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was August 7, 2024_\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nInsikt Group has identified an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign targeting organizations in Central\nAsia, East Asia, and Europe. This campaign is conducted by a Russia-aligned threat activity group Insikt\nGroup tracks as TAG-110, which overlaps with UAC-0063 and which the Computer Emergency\nResponse Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributes with moderate confidence to the Russian\ncyber-espionage group BlueDelta (APT28). Targeted organizations include human rights groups, private\nsecurity companies, and educational institutions. TAG-110 has been observed deploying the loader\nHATVIBE and the backdoor CHERRYSPY to conduct operations in this campaign. Initial access is\nsuspected to come from malicious email attachments or exploitation of vulnerable web-facing services\nsuch as Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS).\n\nInsikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded\nFuture's notification policy.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - TAG-110 (UAC-0063), which CERT-UA first [identified in May 2023 and attributed with moderate](https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016)\nconfidence to the Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group BlueDelta\n(APT28), is a Russia-aligned threat activity group primarily targeting organizations in Central\nAsia.\n\n  - Since July 2024, Insikt Group has identified 62 unique TAG-110 victims of custom malware\nHATVIBE and CHERRYSPY across eleven countries, with the vast majority of identified victims\nlocated in Central Asia. The targeted organizations were primarily in the government, human\nrights group, and education sectors.\n\n  - This campaign aligns with historical UAC-0063 reporting, including the use of CHERRYSPY\nbeginning in 2023 and the heavy focus on targets in Central Asia.\n\n  - Similar to other recent Russian APT campaigns affecting the region, the group is likely seeking to\nacquire intelligence to bolster Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine and gather insights into\ngeopolitical events in neighboring countries, especially as Moscow’s relations with its neighbors\nhave suffered following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n## Background\n\nTAG-110 is a threat activity group that overlaps with the publicly reported group UAC-0063, which has\n[been linked to BlueDelta (APT28) with “medium confidence” by CERT-UA. TAG-110 has carried out](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280129)\nespionage activities aligned with Russian state interests since [at least 2021. Previous reports](https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ) have\ndetailed that TAG-110 primarily targets entities in Central Asia, alongside targets located in India, Israel,\nMongolia, and Ukraine. Targeted sectors in these countries have historically been government,\n\n1 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n2 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n3 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n4 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nHATVIBE will check whether the HTTP response payload data from the C2 starts with the string\n“sd5ddf3e3fg4gfds”. If this condition is met, HATVIBE will execute everything after this string as\nVBScript.\n\nHATVIBE C2 servers use virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure on various hosting providers and\nNamecheap for domain registration.

It employs a combination of asymmetric (RSA) and symmetric (Advanced\nEncryption Standard [AES]) encryption algorithms for secure key exchange and confidential data\ntransmission. Also included in this key exchange is “USR_KAF”, a hard-coded, 24-character ID, and the\n“USR_CRC”, an SHA-256 sum of the CHERRYSPY payload. An example of the HTTP POST from\nCHERRYSPY to its C2 server can be seen in Figure 6.\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nContent-Length: 591\nHost: <C2 Host>:<C2 Port>\nUser-Agent:\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nConnection: close\n{\"USR_KAF\": \"<REDACTED>\", \"USR_CRC\": \"<REDACTED>\", \"USR_PUB\": \"<REDACTED>\"}\n\n```\n**_Figure 6: CHERRYSPY key exchange HTTP POST (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThe CHERRYSPY C2 server responds with an AES key and initialization vector (IV) used to encrypt and\ndecrypt further communication. Also included in the response is the new value for “USR_KAF”, which is\n32 characters long. An example of a successful key exchange response from a CHERRYSPY C2 server\ncan be seen in Figure 7.\n\n6 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n7 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n8 CTA-RU-2024-1121 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n|IP Address|Autonomous System Name|Autonomous System Number|\n|---|---|---|\n|212.224.86[.]69|DE-FIRSTCOLO|44066|\n|185.62.56[.]47|SNEL|62370|\n|84.32.188[.]23|CHERRYSERVERS2-AS|59642|\n|185.167.63[.]42|HOSTKEY-AS|57043|\n|46.183.219[.]228|DATACLUB|52048|\n|185.158.248[.]198|M247|9009|\n\n\n**_Table 3: CHERRYSPY C2 IP infrastructure (Source: Security Trails)_**\n\n|Domain|Registrar|Date Created|\n|---|---|---|\n|internalsecurity[.]us|Namecheap, Inc.|2023-12-22|\n|errorreporting[.]net|Namecheap, Inc.|2023-05-24|\n|lanmangraphics[.]com|Namecheap, Inc.|2023-10-05|\n|retaildemo[.]info|Namecheap, Inc.|2024-04-01|\n|tieringservice[.]com|Namecheap, Inc.|2024-02-26|\n|enrollmentdm[.]com|Namecheap, Inc.|2024-05-13|\n\n\n**_Table 4: CHERRYSPY C2 domain infrastructure (Source: SecurityTrails)_**\n\n\n## Mitigations\n\n  - Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any\nnetwork defense mechanisms in place to alert on—and upon review, consider blocking\nconnection attempts to and from—the domains and IP addresses listed in **Appendix A.**\n\n**●** Use the Snort, Suricata, and YARA rules provided in **Appendices B, C, and D to alert on network**\ncommunications linked to HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY and search for infection in your network.\n\n  - Use Process Monitor to monitor for Scheduled Tasks created via mshta.exe to detect\nHATVIBE’s attempts to establish persistence.
