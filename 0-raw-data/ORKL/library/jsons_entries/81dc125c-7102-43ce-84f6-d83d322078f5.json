It targets Spectre, a\nmajor vulnerability that was disclosed in January 2018.\n\n[According to its website, the Spectre bug is a hardware design flaw in the architectures of](https://spectreattack.com/)\nIntel, AMD, and ARM processors that allows code running inside bad apps to break the\nisolation between different applications at the CPU level and then steal sensitive data from\nother apps running on the same system.\n\nThe vulnerability, which [won a Pwnie Award in 2018 for one of the best security bug](https://pwnies.com/archive/2018/winners/)\ndiscoveries of the year, was considered a milestone moment in the evolution and history of\nthe modern CPU.\n\n[Its discovery, along with the Meltdown bug, effectively forced CPU vendors to rethink their](https://meltdownattack.com/)\napproach to designing processors, making it clear that they cannot focus on performance\nalone, to the detriment of data security.\n\n\n-----\n\nSoftware patches were released at the time, but the Meltdown and Spectre disclosures\nforced Intel to rethink its entire approach to CPU designs going forward.\n\n## Initial Spectre PoCs were all benign\n\nAt the time, the teams behind the Meltdown and Spectre bugs published their work in the\nform of research papers and some trivial proof-of-concept code to prove their attacks.\n\n[Shortly after the Meltdown and Spectre publications, experts at AV-TEST,](https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/100383867141221115206/6517535568830348546) [Fortinet, and](https://blog.fortinet.com/2018/01/30/the-exponential-growth-of-detected-malware-targeted-at-meltdown-and-spectre)\n[Minerva Labs spotted a spike in VirusTotal uploads for both CPU bugs.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/we-may-soon-see-malware-leveraging-the-meltdown-and-spectre-vulnerabilities/)\n\nWhile initially there was a fear that malware authors might be experimenting with the two\nbugs as a way to steal data from targeted systems, the exploits were classified as harmless\nvariations of the public PoC code published by the Meltdown and Spectre researchers and\n[no evidence was found of in-the-wild attacks.](https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2018/02/there-no-evidence-wild-malware-using-meltdown-or-spectre/)\n\nMeltdown and Spectre always seemed vulnerabilities where for most people and orgs\n[the cure was going to be worse than the disease. https://t.co/aPOvGD2GSF](https://t.co/aPOvGD2GSF)\n\n[— Martijn Grooten (@martijn_grooten) March 28, 2018](https://twitter.com/martijn_grooten/status/979076447456432128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nBut today, [Voisin said he discovered new Spectre exploits—one for Windows and one for](https://dustri.org/b/spectre-exploits-in-the-wild.html)\n[Linux—different from the ones before. In particular, Voisin said he found a Linux Spectre](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6461d0988c835e91eb534757a9fa3ab35afe010bec7d5406d4dfb30ea767a62c/details)\nexploit capable of dumping the contents of /etc/shadow, a Linux file that stores details on\nOS user accounts.\n\nSuch behavior is clearly malicious; however, there is no evidence that the exploit was used in\nthe wild, as it could have also been uploaded on VirusTotal by a penetration tester as well.\n\n## Exploits linked to Immunity’s CANVAS tool\n\nBut the most interesting part of Voisin’s discovery is in the last paragraph of his blog, where\nhe hints that he may have discovered who may be behind this new Spectre exploit.\n\n“Attribution is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader,” the French security researcher\nsaid in a mysterious ending.\n\nBut while Voisin did not want to name the exploit author, several people were not as shy.\nSecurity experts on both Twitter and news aggregation service HackerNews were quick to\nspot that the new Spectre exploit might be a module for CANVAS, a penetration testing tool\ndeveloped by Immunity Inc.\n\n“If you are a paid subscriber, you get extra bits [of information] from VirusTotal. One of which\n[is you can see what files are ‘parents’ of the sample,” said a HackerNews user today.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302565)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, there are a bunch of zip files that contain this file, all named Immunity Canvas\nor similar. Canvas is a pentesting tool where they publish exploits, so I guess he’s saying you\ncan attribute it to Immunity.”\n\nAn Immunity spokesperson did not return a request for comment from The Record before\nthis article’s publication to confirm that the Spectre exploits uploaded on VirusTotal last\nmonth are indeed Canvas modules.\n\nHowever, in a tweet today from Dave Aitel, the former Immunity CEO appears to confirm that\nVoisin’s discovery is indeed the CANVAS Spectre module that his former company was\ntouting back in February 2018.\n\nJust some random video that MAY or MAY NOT be interesting to you! 🙂\n[https://t.co/bc6BfMLi4P](https://t.co/bc6BfMLi4P)\n\n[— daveaitel (@daveaitel) March 1, 2021](https://twitter.com/daveaitel/status/1366419538254958598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFor those who have been asking, our SPECTRE exploit dumping /etc/shadow is now\n[available to our Canvas Early Update clients.https://t.co/CEqGfTXa2R#spectre](https://t.co/CEqGfTXa2R)\n[#meltdown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/meltdown?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/SbESP69Fo6](https://t.co/SbESP69Fo6)\n\n— Immunity Inc. (@Immunityinc) [February 1, 2018](https://twitter.com/Immunityinc/status/959155986098421760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFurthermore, shortly after this this article went live, a source in the cybersecurity community\nwho did not want to be named effectively confirmed our report by pointing The Record to a\npost on an underground hacking forum where a threat actor had published a cracked version\nof the Immunity CANVAS v7.26 pen-testing tool, along with cracked copies of White\nPhosphorus and D2, two CANVAS expansion packs that contained two different sets of\nexploits for various vulnerabilities. Among the vulnerabilities there was also an exploit for\nCVE- 2017-5715, the vulnerability ID for the Spectre bug.\n\n\n-----\n\nDmitry Smilyanets, cyber threat intelligence expert for Recorded Future, told The Record that\ncracked versions of this pen-testing toolkit have been shared in private Telegram channels\nfor months, since at least October 2020, if not earlier.\n\nThese new revelations suggest that these cracked CANVAS versions are most likely the\nsource of the CANVAS Spectre modules that were uploaded on VirusTotal on February 3.\n\nThe fact that Immunity had a fully working and fully weaponized Spectre exploit is not a\nsurprise for industry experts, as Aitel’s company was also among the first to put together a\n[fully weaponized exploit for the BlueKeep vulnerability back in 2019, which it publicly](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-company-selling-weaponized-bluekeep-exploit/)\nadvertised at the time, as a way to boast CANVAS’ superior penetration-testing features.\n\n## Last “patch now” warning!\n\nCopies of this Spectre exploit are now making the rounds in Discord and Telegram channels\nrun by security researchers, and it’s only a matter of time until they hit GitHub and become\nbroadly available to everyone, including malware authors.\n\nIf the exploit code can be weaponized as part of an actual attack still remains to be seen as\nthis is no run-of-the-mill vulnerability, but ready-made exploits that enter the public domain\nare often abused as it’s easier for threat actors to adapt code written by someone else than\nwrite their own from scratch.\n\nVoisin’s discovery is about as close the Spectre doomsday clock can tick close to midnight\nbefore attacks get underway, if they haven’t already.\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
