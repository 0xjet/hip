What would otherwise be a mundane scenario in today's world of**\n**cybercrime is spiced up by the fact that the malware-spreading campaigns have leveraged the tense current**\n**geopolitical situation in Eastern Ukraine and the use of a malware family with a rich history. The most recent**\n**campaigns are dated August 2014.**\n\n**BlackEnergy is a trojan which has undergone significant functional changes since it was first publicly analysed**\n**by Arbor Networks in 2007. It has evolved from a relatively simple DDoS trojan into a relatively sophisticated**\n**piece of modern malware with a modular architecture, making it a suitable tool for sending spam and for online**\n**bank fraud, as well as for targeted attacks. BlackEnergy version 2, which featured rootkit techniques, was**\n**documented by SecureWorks in 2010. The targeted attacks recently discovered are proof that the trojan is still**\n**alive and kicking in 2014.**\n\n**We provide a technical analysis of the BlackEnergy family, focusing on novel functionality and the differences**\n**introduced by new 'lite' variants. We describe the most notable aspects of the malware, including its techniques**\n**for bypassing UAC, defeating the signed driver requirement in Windows and a selection of BlackEnergy2 plug-**\n**ins used for parasitic file infections, network discovery and remote code execution and data collection.**\n\n**The many targets in the Ukraine and Poland have been infected through several known and unknown infection**\n**vectors. The most effective ones appear to be spear-phishing emails with subjects related to the current**\n**Ukrainian crisis combined with the exploitation of MS Office documents. CVE-2014-1761, which made the**\n**headlines earlier this year, was also used to spread BlackEnergy.**\n\n**Apart from sharing our most noteworthy findings, we aim to pose some questions that warrant further**\n**research.**\n\n**_[Click here for more details about the conference or register online.](http://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2014)_**\n\n|Blog|Bulletin|VB100|VBSpam|VBWeb|Consulting|Conference|Resources|About Us|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n**About Us**\n\n\n**VB2016 (Denver)**\n\n**VB2015 (Prague)**\n\n**VB2014 (Seattle)**\n\n**Photos**\n\n**Programme**\n\n**Slides**\n\n**Sponsors**\n\n**VB2013 (Berlin)**\n\n**VB2012 (Dallas)**\n\n**VB2011 (Barcelona)**\n\n**VB2010 (Vancouver)**\n\n**VB2009 (Geneva)**\n\n**VB2008 (Ottawa)**\n\n**VB2007 (Vienna)**\n\n\n**site search** **Go »**\n\n\n## VB Conferences\n\n\n-----\n\n**Robert Lipovsky is a malware researcher in ESET s security research laboratory in Bratislava,**\n**having been working for ESET since 2007.
