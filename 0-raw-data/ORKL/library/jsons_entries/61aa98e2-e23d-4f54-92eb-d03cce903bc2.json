    "plain_text": "# Meet Babar, a New Malware Almost Certainly Created by France\n\n**[motherboard.vice.com/read/meet-babar-a-new-malware-almost-certainly-created-by-france](https://motherboard.vice.com/read/meet-babar-a-new-malware-almost-certainly-created-by-france)**\n\nThe NSA, GCHQ, and their allies in the Five Eyes are not the only government agencies\nusing malware for surveillance. French intelligence is almost certainly hacking its targets too\n—and now security researchers believe they have proof.\n\nOn Wednesday, the researchers will reveal new details about a powerful piece of malware\nknown as \"Babar,\" which is capable of eavesdropping on online conversations held via\nSkype, MSN and Yahoo messenger, as well as logging keystrokes and monitoring which\nwebsites an infected user has visited.\n\nBabar is \"a fully blown espionage tool, built to excessively spy\" on its victims, according to\nthe research, which Motherboard reviewed in advance. The researchers are publishing two\nseparate but complementary reports that analyze samples of the malware, and all but\nconfirm that France's spying agency the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE)\nwas responsible for its creation.\n\nFrance's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment by the time of\npublication.\n\n\n-----\n\nEuropean nations are just as capable as the US and Russia to take their espionage efforts\nto cyberspace,\" Marion Marschalek, an Austrian researcher at Cyphort and author of one of\nthe reports, told Motherboard. \"France is just as active as the other big players.\"\n\n[\"Babar is a popular French children's television show.\" Photo via Der Spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35683.pdf)\n\nMarschalek analyzed the malware samples with Paul Rascagneres, a malware analyst at\nsecurity firm G DATA, and Joan Calvet, a researcher from anti-virus maker ESET.\n\nInitial hints at Babar's existence were first revealed last March, when a document leaked by\nEdward Snowden described a 2009 spying operation dubbed SNOWGLOBE. According to\n[Canadian intelligence agency Communications S ecurity Establishment (CSE), which](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-canadian-spies-infiltrated-the-internets-core-to-watch-what-you-do-online)\ndiscovered the operation, SNOWGLOBE mainly targeted Iran's nuclear program, but also hit\nvictims in European countries such as Greece and Spain.\n\nThe operation used malware the attackers named \"Babar,\" and CSE concluded with\n\"moderate certainty\" that SNOWGLOBE was a hacking operation carried out by \"a French\nintelligence agency.\" (The researchers believe this was a previous version of the Babar\nmalware they have analyzed. The precise capabilities of that old version are unclear.)\n\n[After Le Monde published the CSE do cument describing SNOWGLOBE and Babar, the](http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/03/21/quand-les-canadiens-partent-en-chasse-de-babar_4387233_3210.html)\nresearchers said they obtained a series of malware samples, or binaries, that belonged to\nthe same attackers, and are from the same \"family\" as the malware described in the\ndocument. Marschalek said that another researcher who preferred not to be named\nsuggested that copies of the malware had been uploaded to VirusTotal, an online malware\ndetection service.\n\nThough their analysis didn't uncover any new evidence implicating France, the two reports\nconfirm many of the details contained within CSE's document, according to the researchers.\n\n\"I'm sure [it was France], but proving this publicly is close to impossible,\" Marschalek told\nMotherboard via instant message. \"With binary attribution you generally have the problem,\nunlike in real crime scenes, you do not have actual evidence. There are indicators, from\nwhich conclusions can be drawn, but anything that serves as something like a digital\nfingerprint can be faked in the end.\"\n\nThe first clue is the malware's name. The CSE document identified the malware's \"internal\nname\" as Babar—which happens to be the name of an elephant from a popular series of\nFrench children's books. The sample analyzed by Marschalek and Rascagneres was named\nBabar64. Babar also communicated with the same servers as two other hacking tools,\nEvilBunny and TFC—which the researchers believe were also created by the French—and\nthose servers hosted French language websites.\n\nYet another clue is a simple typo.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the CSE document, the author of the Babar malware misspelled a string in the\ncode. Instead of writing MSIE, the author wrote MSI. That same mistake is contained in the\ncode of Babar64 and EvilBunny.\n\nPhoto via Der Spiegel\n\nPhoto via Marion Marschalek/Cyphort\n\nAll these breadcrumbs are \"unique properties\" that show that the malware analyzed by\nMarschalek, Rascagneres and Calvet is likely associated with the one described in the CSE\ndocument, according to Morgan Marquis-Boire, a former Google security researcher who's\nnow director of security for First Look Media.\n\nThese reports represent \"an important step\" in understanding the hacking capabilities of\nWestern nations that are not members of the Five Eyes. While Babar might not be as\n[sophisticated as the GCHQ malware campaign REGIN,](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/regin-powerful-government-malware) or t he newly-revealed NSA\ncampaign, it's still \"high-quality,\" Marquis-Boire told Motherboard.\n\n\"There's different strata of players in the nation-state cyber espionage arena,\" said MarquisBoire, who has reviewed the report. \"There's a lot of really, really badly written malware. Here\nthere's the quality you could expect from a nation that has a large military industrial\ncomplex.\"\n\nAccording to Marschalek, Babar is not \"very sophisticated,\" but is highly targeted and a \"very\ngood software, above the level of what kind of 'products' a malware analyst gets to see on a\ndaily basis.\"\n\nIn other words, it seems we have evidence that France is in the hacking business now, too.\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
