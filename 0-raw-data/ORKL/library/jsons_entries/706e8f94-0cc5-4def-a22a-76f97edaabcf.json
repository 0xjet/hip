This activity includes malware delivery through email and existing\ninfections.\n\nSuccessful Emotet payload execution has not been observed across customers at this time.\nThe Threat Intelligence team assesses with medium confidence current campaigns are\n[focused on re-establishing botnet infrastructure following law enforcement's action to take](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/emotet-malware-taken-down-by-global-law-enforcement-effort/)\ndown the botnet in January 2021[3]. Email delivery techniques and payload execution remain\nconsistent or similar to past Emotet infections. The eSentire Threat Intelligence team\nassesses, with medium confidence, Emotet’s email campaigns will continue.\n\n## What we’re doing about it\n\neSentire MDR for Network and Endpoint have rules in place to detect Emotet.\nIP addresses associated with Emotet have been blocked via MDR for Network.\nThreat hunting has been performed for all eSentire MDR for Endpoint customers.\neSentire security teams are tracking this threat for additional detection and prevention\nopportunities.\n\n## What you should do about it\n\n### Employ email filtering and protection measures\n\nBlock or quarantine email attachments such as EXEs, Password Protected Zip\narchives, JavaScript, Visual Basic scripts.\nImplement anti-spoofing measures such as DMARC and SPF.\nEmploy an MFA solution to reduce impact of compromised credentials.\nTrain users to identify and report suspicious emails, including from trusted contacts.\n\n### Protect endpoints against malware\n\nEnsure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.\nUse a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product to\ndetect and contain threats.\nLimit or disable macros across the organization. See UK's National Cyber\nCentre guidance on Macro Security\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional information\n\nEmotet is an information stealer malware that is also used for initial access by multiple\nthreats such as Qakbot and Trickbot. Emotet has been previously observed leading to Ryuk,\nConti, ProLock, and Egregor ransomware threats.\n\nAs of this writing, follow-on malware has not been observed in these latest campaigns.\nEmotet activity halted in early 2021, after law-enforcement acted against the Emotet threat\nand seized malicious infrastructure. Recent activity is believed to be focused on reestablishing botnet hosts.\n\n### Overview of November 15th to 17th 2021 Emotet Activity\n\n_Distribution_\n\nExisting Trickbot Infections.\nMass email delivery.\n\n_Emotet Email Content_\n\nSpoofed replies to stolen email threads (email thread hijacking).\nExcel (.xlsm) attachments.\nWord (.docm) attachments.\nPassword protected Zip archives containing malicious office documents.\nLinks to malicious office documents.\n\n_Malicious Office Documents_\n\nUse of standard lures to entice recipients to enable macros (see images below).\nSuccessful macros execution results in PowerShell commands to retrieve and execute\npayloads via rundll32.exe.\nNo secondary payloads have been observed as of time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Malicious Word Document_\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious Excel Document_\n\n\n-----\n\nA detailed breakdown of current infection scheme can be found here:\n[https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+Returns/28044/](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+Returns/28044/)\n\n## References:\n\n[1] [https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+Returns/28044/](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+Returns/28044/)\n\n[2] [https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1460302706954981385](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1460302706954981385)\n\n[3] https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerousmalware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action\n\n\n-----",
