Also known as QBot, QuackBot, or Pinkslipbot, QakBot\nis an information stealer and banking Trojan that has been captured and analyzed by\nsecurity researchers since 2007.\n\nI performed a deep analysis on this phishing campaign and the new QakBot variant using the\ncaptured email. In this analysis, you will learn how the attached HTML file leads to\ndownloading and executing the new QakBot variant, what actions it takes on the victim’s\ndevice, and how it sends the collected data from the victim’s device to its C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n**Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive information**\n\n**Severity level: Critical**\n\n## Phishing Email and the Attached HTML File\n\nFigure 1.1 shows the phishing email used by hackers to lure the recipient into opening the\nattached HTML file (ScannedDocs_1586212494.html). This phishing email has been marked\nas SPAM by Fortinet’s FortiMail.\n\nFigure 1.1 – Display of the captured phishing email\n\nThe HTML file contains a piece of javascript code that is automatically executed once it is\nopened in a web browser by the recipient. It decodes a base64 string held by a local\nvariable. It then calls a built-in function, navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob(), to save the base64\ndecoded data (a ZIP archive) to a local file named “ScannedDocs_1586212494.zip”. Figure\n1.2 shows the defined variables with the base64 string and the ZIP file name.\n\nFigure 1.2 – The javascript snippet code inside the HTML file\n\nFigure 1.3 is a screenshot of a Microsoft Edge browser opening the HTML file. As you can\nsee, the ZIP archive has been automatically saved onto the victim’s device.\n\nFigure 1.3 – The HTML file opened in the Microsoft Edge browser\n\n## Downloading and executing QakBot\n\nNext, we’ll look at what’s inside the downloaded ZIP archive. It’s a Windows shortcut file –\n“ScannedDocs_1586212494.lnk”. As you may know, a Windows shortcut file can execute\ncommands by putting them into the Target field. Figure 2.1 shows a screenshot of this\nshortcut file and its properties.\n\nFigure 2.1 – The Windows shortcut file and properties\n\nThe shortcut is disguised with a Microsoft Write icon to trick the victim into thinking it’s a safe\ntext file so they will open it. As for its properties, a group of commands in the target field will\nbe executed by “cmd.exe”. When the victim double clicks the file, the commands get\nexecuted.\n\nAccording to the commands found in Figure 2.1, it mainly runs “cURL” (Client URL) to\ndownload a file from URL 194[.]36[.]191[.]227/%random%.dat into local file\n“%ProgramData%\\Flop\\Tres.dod”. cURL is a popular Linux tool, but it has also been part of\nWindows as a default program since Windows 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded file ( Tres.dod ) is a DLL file. By my analysis, it is a sort of QakBot s loader\nprogram. In this case, “regsvr32” is in charge of executing it using the command “regsvr32\n%ProgramData%\\Flop\\Tres.dod”.\n\nFigure 2.2 – A view of the QakBot Loader Module’s Resource section\n\nThe QakBot Loader Module (Tres.dod) that runs in “regsvr32.exe” loads a binary block from\nits Resource section with the name “AAA”, as shown in Figure 2.2. It proceeds to decrypt the\nbinary block to get a fileless PE file and a piece of dynamic code that is a kind of selfdeployment function. It is then called by the Loader Module to deploy the fileless PE file,\nwhich is the core module of QakBot, inside the “regsvr32” process. After the core module of\nQakBot is deployed, the last task of the self-deployment function is to call its entry point.\nFigure 2.3 explains how the self-deployment function calls the entry point of the QakBot core\nmodule.\n\nFigure 2.3 – Self-deployment function about to call the entry point of QakBot\n\n## Process Hollowing\n\nMalware usually performs process hollowing to inject malicious code or modules into another\nprocess. It does this to evade being detected.\n\nDepending on the affected machine’s platform (32-bit or 64-bit) and installed anti-virus\nsoftware, QakBot will select a system process from a process list as the target process for\nperforming process hollowing. This list includes OneDriveSetup.exe, explorer.exe,\nmobsync.exe, msra.exe, and iexplore.exe for this variant.\n\nIn my testing environment, it picked “OneDriveSetup.exe”. QakBot then calls the API\nCreateProcessW() to start a new process using the creation flag CREATE_SUSPENDED so\nit gets suspended at start. It can then modify its memory data, like carrying the QakBot core\nmodule onto the newly-created “OneDriveSetup.exe” process by calling API\nWriteProcessMemory(). Next, it modifies the code at the entry point of the new process to\njump to the injected core module. It eventually calls the API ResumeThread() to resume the\nnew process, and QakBot is then executed in the target process.\n\nFigure 3.1 shows a process tree with all relevant processes from downloading QakBot\nLoader (“curl.exe”) to “OneDriveSetup.exe”.\n\nFigure 3.1 – Overview of the process tree for relevant processes\n\n## Anti-analysis technique\n\nBefore analyzing QakBot’s core module, let’s go through some of the anti-analysis\ntechniques that QakBot uses to prevent itself from being easily analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Constant strings are encrypted**\n\nConstant strings are useful information for researchers to analyze code. QakBot holds\nencrypted constant strings, which are only decrypted by a particular function before using.\nFigure 4.1 is an example of obtaining a constant string, \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;\nrv:77.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/77.0\", through the function at 609DD8 by string index\n0xA8.\n\nFigure 4.1 – Example of one decrypted constant string by a function\n\n**Dynamically obtaining key Windows APIs**\n\nMost Windows APIs are obtained during QakBot run-time. It is hard to guess which API is\ncalled until executing the instruction. Below is an instance of calling the API CreateThread(),\nwhere dword_61F818 is a dynamically loaded function table, whose offset +74H is the\nfunction of CreateThread().\n\nxor ecx, ecx\n\nlea eax, [ebp+var_4]\n\npush eax\n\nmov eax, dword_61F818 ; Function table of Kernel32.dll\n\npush ecx\n\npush ecx\n\npush offset thread_fun\n\npush ecx\n\npush ecx\nmov [ebp+var_4], ecx\n\n**call dword ptr [eax+74h] ; =>; CreateThread**\n\nmov dword_61F83C, eax\n\ntest eax, eax\n\n**Detecting Analysis Tools**\n\nQakBot has a thread function that checks once per second to see if any analysis tool is\nrunning on the affected machine. To do this, it predefines a process name list of some\nanalysis tools, which of course, is a decrypted constant string. Once any of them matches\none of the running processes, it will affect QakBot’s workflow (say, never connecting to a C2\nserver).\n\nHere is the predefined process name list:\n\n**frida-winjector-helper-32.exe, frida-winjector-helper-64.exe,**\n**tcpdump.exe,windump.exe, ethereal.exe, wireshark.exe, ettercap.exe;rtsniff.exe,**\n**packetcapture.exe, capturenet.exe, qak_proxy;dumpcap.exe, CFF Explorer.exe,**\n**not_rundll32.exe, ProcessHacker.exe, tcpview.exe, filemon.exe,**\n\n\n-----\n\n**procmon.exe;idaq64.exe, PETools.exe, ImportREC.exe, LordPE.exe, SysInspector.exe,**\n**proc_analyzer.exe, sysAnalyzer.exe, sniff_hit.exe, joeboxcontrol.exe,**\n**joeboxserver.exe, ResourceHacker.exe, x64dbg.exe, Fiddler.exe, sniff_hit.exe,**\n**sysAnalyzer.exe**\n\nAccording to the above process list, I determined that the analysis tools include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\n**Joe Sandbox, TcpDump, WinPcap, Wireshark, Ettercap, PacketCapture, CaptureNet,**\n**CFF Explorer, ProcessHacker, TcpView, FileMon, ProcMon, IDA pro, PETools,**\n**ImportREC, LordPE, SysInspector, SysAnalyzer, ResourceHacker, x64dbg, and**\n**Fiddler.**\n\n## QakBot’s Core Module Connects to C2 Server\n\nAs long as the QakBot core module is resumed in the target process (such as\n“OneDriveSetup.exe”), it starts using another entry function other than the one in\nregsvr32.exe.\n\nAs per QakBot tradition, it uses many threads to perform its tasks. One is to collect\ninformation about the affected device and send it to its C2 server.\n\nThe core module has two binary data blocks in its Resource section, named “102” and “103”.\nThe data of Resource “103” is an RC4 encrypted configuration. After decryption, it is the\nstring “10=obama189\\r\\n3=1655107308\\r\\n”. “obama189” is a QakBot ID of this variant, and\n“1655107308” is a Unix Epoch time.\n\nThe “102” Resource data is an RC4 encrypted C2 server list.\n“\\System32\\WindowsPowerShel1\\v1.0\\powershel1.exe” is a constant string that generates\nan Rc4 key buffer to decrypt the C2 server data.\n\nFigure 5.1 – Screenshot of partially decrypted “102” Resource\n\nThe top section of Figure 5.1 shows it was about to call the API FindResourceW with the\nResource name “102”, while the bottom section is a partial list of the decrypted binary IP and\nPort of the C2 server. There are 123 IP and Port pairs inside this variant.\n\nQakBot goes through all listed C2 servers, one by one, until a connection is established. It\nthen sends the victim registry packet (the first packet) to that C2 server to register the victim.\nThe plain text of the registry packet is:\n\n**“{\\”2\\”:\\”hrzpxm292261\\”,\\”8\\”:9,\\”1\\”:18}”**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe keys are string numbers, like 2, 8, and 1 . The value of 2 is hrzpxm292261 (the\nvictim’s ID) that was generated using hardware information, the value of key “8” specifies the\npacket type (it’s 9 for this packet), and “1”’s value is 18, which is the QakBot version.\n\nThe packet is RC4 encrypted and then encoded as a string using a base64 algorithm. All the\npackets between QakBot and the C2 server are sealed in a JSON structure.\n\nIt then sends the data to its C2 server using the HTTP Post method with URL “/t4” and the\nbase64 encoded registry data as the body and being transported over SSL protocol. Figure\n5.2 shows a screenshot of an analysis tool with the sent packet on the left and response data\non the right.\n\nFigure 5.2 – The view of the registry packet in an analysis tool\n\nIt takes the reverse path to restore the response data to plain text, which is base64 decoding\nand RC4 decryption.\n\n“{\\”8\\”:5,\\”16\\”:3257495567,\\”39\\”:\\”vLLO\\”,\\”38\\”:1}” is the plain text for this case, which will\nset or update the value of some local variables.\n\n## Sending Sensitive Data to the C2 Server\n\nQakBot collects sensitive data from the victim’s device and sends it to its C2 server. Similarly,\nthe hacker could transfer corresponding sub-modules to the QakBot client to be executed on\nthe victim’s device.\n\nQakBot leverages Windows APIs, Windows commands, and WMI Query Language (WQL) to\nobtain the information. Below are the details.\n\n**Window APIs**\n\n**API Function** **Description**\n\nGetVersionEx() Windows edition information, including build number, such\nas “10.0.1.19043.0.0.0100” for my testing system running\nWindows 10.\n\nGetComputerNameW() Computer name, like “DESKTOP-P952NC4”.\n\nGetSystemMetrics() Obtain screen size (width and height).\n\nNetGetJoinInformation() Retrieve the AD Domain, like “WORKGROUP”.\n\n\n-----\n\nLookupAccountSidW() The User name.\n\nGetSystemInfo() Processor Architecture.\n\n\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot(),\n\nProcess32FirstW(),\nProcess32NextW()\n\n\nObtain running process information.\n\n\nGetModuleFileNameW() The full path of QakBot and the full path of the target\nprocess.\n\nCreatProcessW() Execute Windows commands.\n\n**WMI Object Query**\n\n**Query String** **Description**\n\n\nSELECT * FROM\nWin32_OperatingSystem\n\n\nOS information.\n\n\nSELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct Obtain the installed AntiVirus software, like\nMicrosoft Defender or FortiClient.\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_Processor CPU processor information.\n\n\nSELECT * FROM\nWin32_ComputerSystem\n\n\nSystem environment information, like Model,\nDomain, Manufacturer, etc.\n\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_Bios Device’s BIOS information.\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_DiskDrive Hard disk information, like Partitions, Size,\nand Model.\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_PhysicalMemory Physical RAM sticks’ detailed information,\nsuch as capacity, clock speed, and channel.\n\n\n-----\n\nSELECT\nCaption,Description,Vendor,Version,\n\nInstallDate,InstallSource,PackageName\nFROM Win32_Product\n\nSELECT Caption,Description,DeviceID,\n\nManufacturer,Name,PNPDeviceID,Service,\n\nStatus\n\nFROM Win32_PnPEntity\n\n**Windows Commands**\n\n\nInstalled software information.\n\nProperties of Plug and Play devices, like\nKeyboard, Mouse, CD-ROM, Network\nadapter, and more.\n\n\n**Commands** **Description**\n\n\"ipconfig /all\" All TCP/IP network configuration values.\n\n\n\"nslookup -querytype=ALL timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%s\"\n\n\nQuery SRV records for the domain from the main\nDNS server of the victim’s device.\n\n\n\"nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\" Enumerating domain trusts.\n\n\"net share\" Shared resources and names.\n\n\"route print\" Active routes’ tables.\n\n\"netstat -nao\" Active connections in the victim’s device.\n\n\"net localgroup\" Local groups information.\n\n\"qwinsta\" Active sessions on the victim’s device.\n\n\"arp -a\" Information about ARP entries.\n\n\"net view /all\" Display all the shares on a remote computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce QakBot has collected all the information shown in the above tables, it seals the\ninformation inside a packet with packet type “8”:4. Figure 6.1 shows the JSON data of this\npacket, which was about to call the RC4 encryption function.\n\nFigure 6.1 – Plain text of packet “8”:4 with sensitive information\n\nAlthough this QakBot successfully established connections with its C2 server, I have not\nreceived any sub-modules. I’m still monitoring the communication and will update this\nanalysis if I get something interesting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAccording to this analysis, I proved that an attached HTML file is no safer than any other\nrisky files (like MS Word, MS Excel, PDF, and so on). You have to be extra cautious when\nreceiving emails with attachments.\n\nI then explained how the HTML file drops a ZIP archive through a piece of auto-execution\nJavaScript code. Later, I focused on how a disguised Windows shortcut file downloads the\nloader module of QakBot.\n\nYou also learned what the loader module does to decrypt and deploy the core module of\nQakBot in a picked target process (“OneDriveSetup.exe” for this time).\n\nAnd finally, we walked through QakBot starting threads to connect to its C2 server using an\nIP address and port pair chosen from a C2 server list that had been decrypted from its\nResource “102”, as well as what sensitive data it retrieved from the victim’s device and then\nsubmitted to its C2 server..\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web\nFiltering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows:\n\nThe phishing email was detected as \"SPAM\" by the FortiMail service.\n\nThe URL to download QakBot and its C2 servers has been rated as \"Malicious Websites\"\nby the FortiGuard Web Filtering service.\n\nThe HTML file attached to the phishing email and the downloaded QakBot Loader module\nare detected as \"JS/Agent.BLOB!tr\" and \"W32/Qbot.D!tr\" and are blocked by the\nFortiGuard Antivirus service.\n\nFortiEDR detects the involved file as malicious based on its behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to these protections, we suggest that organizations have their end users also go\n[through the FREE NSE training:](https://training.fortinet.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-institute) [NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness.
