I have been asked specifically to comment on China’s cyber espionage goals and the\nMinistry of State Security’s (MSS) role in achieving them. My testimony will examine the MSS’s\nrise in cyber espionage capabilities, timelines of important evolutions in the PRC’s intelligence\ncollection strategy, similarities and separation of roles played by both the MSS and the People’s\nLiberation Army (PLA), and the threats it poses to the United States and its allies. In particular, I\nwill use two recent US Department of Justice indictments to illustrate the history and breadth of\ncyber operations carried out by MSS contractors, and why their future ability to continue these\noperations is of grave concern. Finally, I will submit several recommendations on steps\nCongress can take to combat this threat.\n\n# Rise of the MSS-Contractor Model\n\nThis testimony will illustrate how the MSS’s model of using a combination of in-house talent and\ncyber contractors has won the CCP’s favor for engaging in economic-driven cyber espionage. A\ncombination of external factors and internal decisions made throughout the early 2000s made\nthis model preferable to the PLA’s former 3rd Department’s (3PLA) historically noisier\noperations and past mistakes. These include:\n\n  - A long-planned PLA reorganization conveniently announced at the end of 2015 at a time\nwhen Sino-US tensions over cyber espionage were at their highest\n\n  - Additional time to combine the capabilities of the 3PLA, responsible for the military’s\nsignals intelligence (SIGINT), and the 4th Department (4PLA), responsible for the PLA’s\nEW capabilities\n\n  - Successive public exposures of 3PLA units by US private sector cybersecurity firms\n\n  - Less corruption and moonlighting activities among the MSS due to an earlier disciplinary\ninvestigation period done during Xi Jinping’s first years\n\n  - Better integration among State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) & private sector\n\n  - No military commissioning (PT training, dorms, etc.) enabling easier recruitment\n\n  - MSS 13th Bureau’s (CNITSEC) integration into the vulnerability mining ecosystem,\nproviding better exploits and tooling\n\n  - Cover & domestic surveillance capabilities provided by Ministry of Public Security (MPS)\n\n  - Superior provincial recruiting of lead figures in underground hacking groups\n\n  - Ability to run domestic cyber conferences and leverage recruitment opportunities\n\n  - Plausible deniability\n\nWhat is uniquely concerning about the threat posed to the US and its allies by the MSS is the\nblind eye it turns on contract hackers engaging in criminal activity for personal profit in exchange\nfor collection of intelligence priorities, and its ability to leverage China’s excellent vulnerability\nmining ecosystem to hoard exploits for cyber operations. In addition, MSS-affiliated actors such\n\n\n-----\n\nas TURBINE PANDA/APT26 and WICKED PANDA/APT41 have engaged in increasingly\nbrazen big data collection operations (such as OPM), which has been proven to be used by the\nMSS in future targeting operations. In total, these make the MSS a unique cyber adversary that\nin many ways has surpassed the smash-and-grab PLA intrusions of the past and created a\nmuch more dangerous environment globally when considering intrusions like the recent\nMicrosoft Exchange Server/HAFNIUM exploitation, which opened attack surfaces to a more\npublic audience.\n\nThis is not to discount the capabilities of the PLA’s newer Strategic Support Force (SSF), which\nhave likely recently improved by integrating both computer network exploitation (CNE)\ncapabilities for espionage, and computer network attack (CNA) capabilities which can prepare\npotential targets for follow-on destructive attacks in a wartime scenario. However, there has\nbeen a marked increase in cyber espionage activity conducted by the MSS and its contractors\nover the past several years, suggesting its model is more favorable for conducting cyber\nespionage. To better understand the nuanced reasons for this change, one must examine the\nearly origins of cyber espionage in China.\n\n# The Turning Point for Cyber Espionage in China\n\nThough the PRC’s electronic warfare (EW) capabilities date back well before 2000, the early\n2000s saw a dramatic shift in the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) view of Computer Network\nOperations (CNO) and its usefulness as a way to bridge key technology gaps and rapidly gain\nparity with advanced adversaries like the U.S. in a variety of dual-use technologies (military and\nprivate sector) outlined in the CCP’s overlapping strategic plans that would otherwise be\nunattainable without years of research and billions spent on development. The notion that CNO\ncould be used not just as a warfighting capability, but as a modernized extension of its longrunning economic espionage campaigns would fundamentally change the PRC’s intelligence\ncollection methods over the next two decades.\n\nThis shift toward viewing CNO and “hacking” as a key component of intelligence collection was\nlikely caused by an intersection of three major factors during the same time frame:\n\n1. Throughout the late 1990’s, PLA doctrine began emphasizing information-centric\nstrategies to help the PRC win future “informatized” wars and developing asymmetric\ncapabilities to disrupt more technologically advanced opponents.\n2. From 1997-2001, a new subset of young, patriotic, and technologically savvy Chinese\ncitizens began coalescing in underground hacking communities and using international\nsite defacements as an outlet for perceived injustices against China by foreign nations.\n3. From 1998-2003 CCP officials from the PRC’s various security apparatuses began\nexperimenting with directed censorship of information on the internet as a way to\ninfluence national sentiment in projects that would become the Golden Shield Project\nand the Great Firewall (GFW).\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin several short years, the CCP recognized that the internet posed a massive threat to the\nCCP’s internal stability, but that if information and the talented youth using the internet for\nnationalistic purposes could be directed properly it would be a massive boon to establishing\ncontrol over its populace while advancing China’s strategic economic goals.\n\nDating back to 2003’s Titan Rain (a cover term for a series of Chinese intrusions into US and\nUK government systems), the PLA’s former 3rd Department (3PLA) appears to be the earliest\nand most ardent adopter of CNO for espionage purposes. However, over time the MSS’s\nsuperior tradecraft, recruiting practices, and important role in China’s thriving vulnerability\necosystem would make it the chief threat to a variety of global victims across multiple sectors.\nIts ascension post-2015 as the PRC’s lead entity for economic espionage is likely no\ncoincidence as the PLA began undergoing long-planned reforms which would transform its\ncyber warfare capabilities, which have been discussed in other panels today.\n\n# A Brief Timeline of Important Points in China’s Cyber Espionage Evolution\n\n  - 1996 - Internet is made available to Chinese homes\n\n  - 1997 - Foundation of The Green Army, China’s first patriotic hacking group\n\n  - 1998 - Chinese authorities begin experimenting with censorship and timing\n\n     - Cult of the Dead Cow releases “Back Orifice Program” and Trojan use increases\nin China\n\n     - Indonesia Riots and turn toward defacements\n\n  - 1999 - Taiwan/Belgrade Embassy Bombings and the birth of Red Hackers malicious\nintent\n\n     - Green Army goes commercial - Shanghai group becomes NSFOCUS\n\n  - 2001 - US/China hacker war over Hainan/EP3 Incident\n\n  - 2003 - Microsoft hands source code to the MSS 13th Bureau (CNITSEC), and known\ncontractors Topsec and Venustech\n\n      - Extensive hiring of patriotic hacking groups by PLA, MSS, and private firms\n\n  - 2003-2006 - Titan Rain intrusions against US and UK defense networks.\n\n  - 2005-2010 - CNE campaigns explode (ShadyRat, GhostNet, HiddenLynx, Aurora, etc.)\n\n  - 2008 - Beijing Olympics strengthens MSS standing and alliances between private sector\ncontractors\n\n  - 2008-2010 - Intrusions against Tibetan activists and other “Five Poisons” shows MSS\ninvolvement\n\n  - 2010-2012 - TURBINE PANDA actors (MSS Nanjing contractors) prep C919 campaign\n\n  - 2012 - Xi Jinping becomes CCP General Secretary and initiates anti-corruption\ncampaigns, deposing several high-ranking MSS officials\n\n  - 2013 - Mandiant releases APT1 report exposing 3PLA 2nd Bureau’s Unit 61398\noperations since 2006\n\n  - 2014 - CrowdStrike exposes PUTTER PANDA, 3PLA 12th Bureau Unit 61486\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 2015 - Xi announces PLA reorganization and creation of PLASSF\n\n     - Intrusions into US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) deemed a massive\nintelligence boon to MSS (later tied to TURBINE PANDA actors)\n\n  - 2016 - Wooyun.org, China’s main vulnerability reporting site since 2010, goes dark\n\n  - 2017 - FBI arrest of Sakula developer and MSS Officer Xu Yanjun in relation to\nTURBINE PANDA operations.

The latter would later allow the MSS’s\nChinese National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD) to have early access to key vulnerabilities\nthat now make up the exploits used in cyber operations today.\n\nThe MSS was believed to have strengthened its position regarding foreign policy decision\nmaking and intelligence under former MSS Minister Geng Huichang (耿惠昌) during the run-up\n\nto the 2008 Beijing Olympics and after handling riots in Tibet and Xinjiang, which followed\nshortly after the games.[1] The Ministry saw a budget increase and an expansion of capabilities,\n\n1 “New Foreign Policy Actors in China”, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, September 2010,\nhttp://books.sipri.org/files/PP/SIPRIPP26.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich likely included cyber divisions as beneficiaries, as evidenced by a sharp increase of cyber\ncampaigns directed against dissidents and other “Five Poisons”.[2]\n\nHowever, a series of defections, perceived intelligence failures, and several high level officials\nremoved over graft during Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaigns in 2012 provided institutional\nsetbacks to its ambitions. Geng (now the Deputy Director of the Subcommittee for Hong Kong,\nMacao, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese) was believed to have been spared by Xi due to his role\nin uncovering deposed Politburo member Zhou Yongkang’s planned military coup to oppose\n\nXi’s appointment as General Secretary. Geng’s replacement in 2015, Chen Wenqing (陈文清),\n\nserved in both the MPS and MSS before becoming the deputy director of the Central\nCommission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the watchdog responsible for many of the\ninspections and arrests that took down previous MSS officials. Chen’s prior career and\nsubsequent appointment as MSS Minister likely represented renewed trust in the MSS by Xi\nwho had already stacked loyalists into key positions among the CCP’s highest echelons. Chen\nis also believed to have taken the helm right as the PLA began its reforms and its cyber\nespionage portfolio was likely handed over to the MSS, giving him tremendous control over the\nrise in cyber intrusions into western systems carried out by the MSS and its contractors.\n\nThe MSS derives its authority from the CCP’s State Council (see Figure 2) and compounding\n\n\nlegislation in 2014, 2015, and 2017, including China’s National Intelligence Law (国家情报法)\n\n\nmade clear requirements that all Chinese citizens and companies (operating in China or\nChinese companies abroad) must collaborate with the MSS in gathering intelligence. In addition,\nall Chinese government departments are required to support its intelligence operations when\nasked. This provides the MSS with the ability to leverage universities, think tanks, foreign affairs\ndepartments, government sponsored overseas educational programs, military liaison programs,\nfriendship and student associations, etc. for operational cover as well as to use them as\nrecruitment platforms. This policy also provides the MSS access to many foreign government\nofficials, scientists, academics, and students.[3,4 ]\n\nFor further reading on the MSS’s history and key personalities I highly recommend “Chinese\nCommunist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer” by Peter Mattis and Matt Brazil. For further\nreading on China’s whole-of-society approach to espionage and examples of specific espionage\ncases I recommend “Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics” by Nicholas Eftimiades.\n\n## How the MSS Sources Technical Capabilities\n\nLike the PLA, which sourced much of its early intrusion capabilities from its burgeoning, techsavvy patriotic hacker cadres, the MSS is not thought to have had well-developed in-house\n\n2 The Five Poisons are typically categorized as perceived threats to the CCP’s rule of China and include: Uyghur\ndissidents, Tibetan dissidents, Falun Gong members, Chinese democracy movements, and advocates for Taiwanese\nindependence\n3 “Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics”, Nicholas Eftimiades, Virtruvian Press, 2020\n4 National Intelligence Law of the People’s Republic of China (Adopted at the 28th Standing Committee of the 12th\nNational People’s Congress on June 27, 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\ncyber capabilities in the early 2000s, and sought to recruit from outside sources. The PLA\ncoordinated with SOEs like the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC) and its multitude of\nsubsidiaries (Westone, for example[5]) to throw capture-the-flag competitions at top Chinese\nuniversities to recruit hacking talent early on, and by all accounts was relatively successful in\nthis approach (see Tan Dailin in the sections below). An exact timeline on the MSS recruitment\nof its cyber talent is much harder to pinpoint, but likely began around the same time as the\nPLA’s due to a growing interest in developing its own technical capabilities.\n\nThe MSS’s true secret weapon turned out to be it’s Technical Bureau/13th Bureau, which\nformed the China Information Technical Security Evaluation Center (CNITSEC/中国信息安全测评\n\n中心) in 1998. While ostensibly acting as the government arm entrusted with software and code\nreview, the intelligence agency was able to capitalize and use its access to interface with nearly\nevery single domestic cybersecurity company pursuing government contracts and know firsthand which Chinese technical researchers were discovering top-tier vulnerabilities that could be\nused in cyber intrusion operations (see Figure 3). If not already familiar with them via CNITSEC,\nthe MSS would come to work closely with many of the Chinese cybersecurity companies that\nhad begun to snap up the early generations of patriotic hackers during the 2008 Beijing\nOlympics. This included:\n\n  - NSFOCUS - the commercial branch of The Green Army, the original Chinese hacking\ncollective\n\n  - Topsec - recruited Honker Union of China founder Lin Yong (林勇/Lion)\n\n  - Venustech - hired a significant amount of former Xfocus and 0x557 members\n\n  - Qihoo 360 - employed legacy figures Yuan Renguang (袁仁广/yuange) and Pan\n\nJianfeng (潘剑锋/pjf)\n\nIn addition to having access to a pipeline of China’s early hacking talent, CNITSEC’s true value\nwould come from providing the MSS with an easy way to cherry-pick high value vulnerabilities\ndirectly from the source, which could be turned into exploits for cyber espionage campaigns.\nCNITSEC was likely doing this as early as 2003 when it was given Microsoft’s source code as\npart of a security agreement between Microsoft and the Chinese government for usage on its\n\nnetworks.[6] This was then renewed again in 2010 with Wu Shizhong (吴世忠) as CNITSEC’s\n\ndirector, who was also dual-hatted as the MSS 13[th] Bureau Director according to state\ndocuments from 2009-2013.[7,8] CNITSEC is also in charge of reviewing software for government\n\n5 https://www.intelligenceonline.com/corporate-intelligence/2020/06/24/westone-top-pla-cybersecurity-andencryption-supplier\n6 https://news.microsoft.com/2003/09/26/china-information-technology-security-certification-center-source-codereview-lab-opened/a\n7\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20220208054411/https://www.cert.org.cn:8443/publish/main/49/2012/201203301838062\n95838762/20120330183806295838762_.html\n8 https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/two-birds-one-stone-panda/\n\n\n-----\n\nuse, in compliance with the national Cybersecurity Law. In June 2017, Wang Jun, chief engineer\nof CNITSEC discussed the Microsoft-CETC joint venture and the need for suspension of\nChinese government use of Windows 10 Chinese Government Edition until it is “secure and\ncontrollable”.[9]\n\nOpen source analysis in 2017 revealed that CNITSEC and the subordinate CNNVD were likely\npurposely delaying reporting on specific vulnerabilities allowing operational windows for their\nusage in cyber operations.[10] Just a short time later, in confirmation, KRYPTONITE\nPANDA/APT40, a known contractor for MSS Hainan[11] was found to have used high-value\nvulnerability CVE-2018-0802 as a 0day exploit, a month before it was publicly reported as being\ndiscovered by Chinese firm Qihoo 360.[12]\n\nLegitimate security companies are known to receive advance notice of vulnerabilities from\nWestern firms such as Microsoft’s Active Protection Partners (MAPP) program, whereby the\nfirms are notified up to a week in advance of upcoming security updates. Several Chinese firms\nprivy to these agreements are believed to have actively abused them in the past, knowing that\nthe initial update merely patches the simple proof-of-concept exploit, leaving a window of\nopportunity often lasting several weeks for alternative exploitation methods while the vendor\ncontinues to roll out security updates to address all vectors.\n\nIt is suspected that abuse of this system may have led to a rapid proliferation of proof-ofconcept code first turned into an exploit by the HAFNIUM group in January 2021 during the\nwidespread Microsoft Exchange Server intrusions. The original HAFNIUM group was quickly\njoined by multiple APTs that had access to the exploit, with some likely having access prior to\nMicrosoft’s patch release. This hints at an internal domestic vulnerability sharing network as the\ngroups with access included both those with suspected ties to the MSS as well as PLA:\n\n  - Tick/STALKER PANDA, a group with suspected ties to the former 3PLA’s 4th Bureau\n(Unit 61419)\n\n  - LuckyMouse/EMISSARY PANDA, a group with suspected MSS Shanghai ties\n\n  - WICKED PANDA/APT41, a group with known ties to MSS Sichuan contractors\n\n  - Tonto Team/KARMA PANDA, a group with suspected ties to the former 3PLA’s\nShenyang TRB (Unit 65016)\n\nMSS operators are also known to source tools and datasets from underground marketplaces.\nThis has previously included purchasing both datasets that could be used for further intrusion\noperations or potential human intelligence (HUMINT) operations, as well as malware sales from\nknown cyber criminal vendors. This may account for the variety of tools seen in use by MSS\n\n9 https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/USCC-Webster-Written-FINALSUBMIT.pdf\n10 https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-vulnerability-influence/\n11 https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/16/apt40-is-run-by-the-hainan-department-of-the-chinese-ministry-ofstate-security/\n12 https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/two-birds-one-stone-panda/\n\n\n-----\n\noperators and explain why many of them are more advanced than tools typically seen in the\ndomestic Chinese underground marketplaces.\n\nIn an example of typical MSS operations, an intrusion into a European target saw MSS officers\npay contractors to conduct network exploitation on victim systems. Though the origin of the\ncontractors was unknown, they used tools associated with the Russian underground,\nconducting lateral movement across the victim systems before turning direct intrusion access\nover to MSS officers. The objectives of the MSS were unclear in this case, however, the access\nwould allow for easy exfiltration or potential future strategic web compromise activity.\n\n## MSS & PLA: Competition vs. Collaboration\n\nPrior evidence suggested that MSS and PLA operations were somewhat in competition for\nresources as well as for valuable collection on identified targets. Previously, it was believed\nthere was a lack of coordination between APT operations groups and there are plenty of\nexamples in private sector reporting of multiple China-backed adversaries concurrently\ncollecting the same information on the same network with different operators and tooling.\nHowever, it is likely this coordination is improving with time and greater control of the PLASSF’s\ncyber actions due to the reorganization.\n\nThere have also been observed instances of the MSS stealing potential recruits from the former\n3PLA. A candidate who had already been approached by PLA recruiters was enticed to the\nMSS due to an easier recruitment process, better pay/benefits, and more freedom as non\nenlisted, which typically meant physical training (PT) for cyber operators unused to it and living\nin military dorms. MSS recruitment strategies will be discussed further in the next section.\n\nIt appears unlikely in the current environment that MSS cyber operations would be used to prep\nthe battlefield for PLA network attacks in a wartime footing. This is largely due to the MSS’s role\nas primary foreign intelligence collector, a role it would likely default to during wartime\nscenarios, and its use of criminal contractors, which are relatively uneven in their capabilities\nand methods for conducting CNE. A more likely scenario is that the MSS’s various network\naccess via their contractors would be handed over to the PLASSF’s CNA units for follow on\nactions based on MSS recommendations about target value. This would essentially be handing\nits malware controllers over to the military to centralize its possible attack surfaces. As the\nPLASSF combines the former 3PLA’s SIGINT capabilities and the 4PLA’s EW methods, it is\nlikely already conducting intelligence vs. attack value analysis internally to inform its cyber units\non whether a target should be collected on or maintain a foothold on its network for future CNA\nuse.\n\nThe PLASSF’s 311 Base has inherited multiple separate units' prior roles in conducting\npsychological warfare operations, making it unlikely the MSS would conduct cyber operations\nfor this purpose. However, another likely scenario is that the MSS instructs its various\ncontractors to engage in patriotic hacking of lower tier targets to avoid conflicting with military\n\n\n-----\n\noperations and to cause chaos and confusion. This would be likely a fairly simple task given the\nhistory of many of its contractors and their patriotic roots.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nContractors act as both a force multiplier and alternative tradecraft for the MSS. Although open\nsource tools provide the bare essentials needed to meet their collection requirements,\ncontractors greatly augment their technical capabilities and plausible deniability. The MSS\nappears to extensively favor the use of contractors because it allows for operations to be easily\nterminated, adds an extra layer of operational security (OPSEC) between the victim and\nintelligence officers, offers a variety of technical responses to fulfill collection requirements,\ncreates plausible deniability in the event attacks are reversed, and can provide additional\ntechnical expertise that may not exist in-house.\n\nContractors are approached in a variety of ways, sometimes maintaining distance and providing\nonly direction and requirements. Other times partnerships may be formalized via CNITSEC and\ngovernment contracts. It is assessed that during the Beijing 2008 Olympics, the MSS hired\nseveral contractors under the pretext of conducting security evaluations and pentesting. These\nhackers-for-hire were based regionally and were told to use any means necessary to\ncompromise targets. It is unclear whether any of these contractors were then kept on retainer\nfor future operations after the relationship was established. However, the MSS has since been\nobserved continuing the use of contractors in multiple operations, making it more likely that\nestablished agreeable working relationships with specific contractors were formed and those\ncontractors were solicited multiple times.\n\nRecruitment also appears heavily sourced from long-standing patriotic hackers and in many\ncases blackhat cyber criminals hacking domestically for profit. New laws during the late 2000s\ngave new powers to the MPS and MSS to pursue cyber criminals domestically, and it is\nbelieved that many of these same individuals came under legal scrutiny or were arrested. It is\nsuspected several were released in exchange for rendering their skills to the state for cyber\nespionage purposes, and subsequently allowed to continue their criminal activities as long as\nthey targeted victims outside China. See the “Evolution” section below for an example of this.\n\nVarious domestic Chinese hacking conferences from 2008 onward demonstrated that there\nseemed to be an almost revolving door between China’s early patriotic hacker groups, the PLA,\nMSS affiliated entities like CNITSEC, and various private sector companies later proven to have\nworked for China’s intelligence services. Security conferences like XPwn2017, a Beijing\nconference sponsored by Baidu and legacy patriotic hacking team Xfocus, partnered with\nCNNVD, Venustech, Alibaba, Pangu Team (China’s top iOS jailbreaking team), and Knownsec\n(another security company founded by legacy Chinese hackers).[13] Its main consultants featured\n(see Figure 4):\n\n13 http://xpwn.xfocus.net/\n\n\n-----\n\n     - HUANG Xin (黄鑫) aka Glacier of Xfocus, —the author of China’s first domestic\nremote access tool (RAT) and listed as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of\nBig World (大成天下)\n\n     - ZHOU Jingping (周景平) aka Superhei of Ph4nt0m Security Team—Chief\nSecurity Officer (CSO) of Knownsec\n\n     - LIU Hongyun (刘鸿运)—Deputy Chief Engineer of CNITSEC\n\n     - ZHU Qianghang (朱钱杭) aka Pineapple of Venustech Active Defense Lab\n\n     - WEI Qiang (魏强), aka Funnywei of Xfocus who has taught cyber operations for\nthe PLA Information Engineering University\n\n     - HAO Yongle (郝永乐) of the CNNVD Operations Management Center\n\nConferences like XPwn and Tianfu Cup are known fertile recruitment grounds for the MSS and\neven the PLA as it provides ample opportunity to meet with established hacking teams, skilled\nindividual operators, and university students. There will be a separate panel following this one\nthat discusses some of the universities the MSS and PLA use as recruiting grounds.\n\nContractors are likely provided ample financial compensation for their efforts, though China\nlikely struggles from the same private sector “brain drain” effect given China’s top tech firms\nhave significantly higher salaries and freedom. However, the MSS has an advantage of being\nable to co-opt talent if they wish, especially if an individual’s cyber activities conducted during\ntheir youth fall under criminal activity.\n\nPrior to 2017, skilled vulnerability researchers at BAT and Qihoo 360 were able to double up on\nprize money by reporting it domestically and then winning competitions like Pwn2Own abroad to\nreceive prize money from western security vendors. While Chinese dominance in these\ncompetitions was notable to western researchers, it still provided top security vendors with\naccess into the kinds of vulnerabilities China was producing. The post-2017 arrangement\ndamages this process and gives even more vulnerability hoarding power to the MSS. As a\nresult, the MSS and specifically CNITSEC likely needed to increase their prices as part of the\n2017 restriction on Chinese vulnerability researchers reporting to foreign vendors before\nreporting to the MSS. In addition, it is believed that many of these security researchers or MSS\ncontractors were barred from leaving China after 2017 and the arrest of the Sakula developer\nfollowing his attendance at a US security conference.\n\nIt is unclear the exact type of “immunity” contractors that also hack for profit are given if they\nconduct operations on behalf of the MSS. Immunity is a loaded term in China, where senior t\nretired CCP officials once thought immune to purges were made low again under Xi Jinping’s\nrule to prevent outsized influence over current politics. Immunity in this case is much more likely\nto represent the MSS and MPS turning a blind eye to these criminal activities rather than\nproviding lifelong immunity. This makes the relationship between blackhat contractors and the\nMSS a tenuous one, based mostly on those criminals conducting their activities outside of China\nto prevent a conflict of interest where the MSS and MPS need to protect Chinese citizens from\ntheir own operators. This is likely why there is a rise of tactics like ransomware and cryptojacking against foreign targets from several Chinese actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Collection Priorities for PRC Intelligence & Subsequent Tasking\n\nThere are numerous fantastic resources that are publicly available and show how China’s\nmultitude of concurrent plans including the 863 & 973 Plans, Five Year Plans, Made in China\n2025 (MIC2025), Space Science & Technology in China: A Roadmap to 2050, and more, which\nall create an overlapping tapestry of key technology gaps. Some of the highlights of China’s\npriorities from recent plans include:\n\n  - **Alternative Energy - Solar, Wind Turbines, Hybrid/electric cars**\n\n  - **Biotechnology - Biomanufacturing, Biopharmaceuticals, Genetically modified**\norganisms, Infectious disease treatment, Cutting-edge vaccines and drugs\n\n  - **Defense - Aerospace & Aeronautical Systems, Armaments, Marine Systems, Radar,**\nOptics, Space infrastructure and exploration technology\n\n  - **High-end Manufacturing - Chemical Manufacturing, Advanced robotics, Aircraft**\nengines, High-performance composite materials, Integrated circuit manufacturing\nequipment and assembly technology\n\n  - **Technology - Artificial intelligence, Big data analysis, High-end computer chips,**\nNetwork equipment, Quantum computing and communications, Rare-earth materials\n\nThese technology gaps ultimately get broken down into more specific intelligence requirements\nthat the PRC’s intelligence agencies are then tasked with collecting. For collection, the MSS and\nPLA likely share common parent in the form of the State Administration of Science, Technology\n\nand Industry for National Defense (SASTIND/国家国防科技工业局). See Figure 2 for an\n\norganizational chart. Within SASTIND there are likely two departments responsible for\ndeveloping and tasking technology related intelligence requirements, and for collecting\nintelligence against those requirements.[14]\n\n  - The Comprehensive Planning Department, which tasks collection to the MSS and most\nlikely, the PLA, Joint Intelligence Bureau.\n\n  - The International Cooperation Department, which has its own independent collection\ncapability. Members of this department travel with PRC scientists to collect information\nagainst specific requirements.\n\nAfter tasking from SASTIND, it is unclear how the MSS or PLA divvy up requirements or\nwhether they compete on objectives (competition between the two has thus far only been\nobserved publicly on an operational basis).\n\nOne key factor sets PRC intelligence gathering apart, which is that it takes a whole-of-society\napproach to collection. Prior anecdotes about “grains of sand” aside, the MSS is able to\n\n14 Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics”, Nicholas Eftimiades, Virtruvian Press, 2020\n\n\n-----\n\ninfluence Chinese companies, overseas students, professors, scientists, and the overseas\nChinese diaspora to assist in intelligence gathering efforts, and has been shown to leverage all\nof them as both cover and collection agent. The PRC’s National Security Law compels\nassistance when required, and the MSS, like its domestic partner the MPS, has been known to\npressure family members residing in China to force actions of those abroad.\n\nThis is a force multiplier when combining the MSS’s ability to conduct human intelligence\n(HUMINT) and cyber operations in concert. That ability will be discussed in the “HUMINT +\nCyber” section.\n\n# Evolution: Chinese Patriotic Hacker → PLA → MSS → Private\n\nThis early evolution of how the PRC leveraged its early patriotic hacking groups to supplement\nits lack of in-house talent is best viewed through the lens of one individual who has been\n\npresent throughout this entire process: Tan Dailin (谭戴林) aka WickedRose. A September 2020\n\nUS DoJ indictment against several members of the WICKED PANDA/APT41 featured Tan and\nseveral co-conspirators who had conducted over 100 documented intrusions into global\ncompanies over the course of a decade.[15] My own research around this indictment and actor\nled me to discover the untold story of how Tan evolved from an angsty patriotic hacker at\nuniversity, to the leader of a group of contract hackers for hire for the PLA, an MSS contractor,\nand eventually a savvy cybersecurity entrepreneur (see Figure 5).\n\nTan was a central figure in the early 2000s Chengdu patriotic hacking scene and a notable\nmember of the Evil Octal Security Team. While attending Sichuan-area universities, he formed\n\nties with Zhou Jibing (赵纪斌) aka WHG, the developer of PlugX[16], a remote access tool (RAT)\n\nthat would later be favored by a majority of Chinese APT groups from 2012-2016[17]. Tan’s skills\nas a developer and intrusion operator led to him founding the Network Crack Program Hacker\n(NCPH) group out of his dorm room while at the Sichuan Institute of Science and\n\nEngineering/Sichuan University of Science and Technology (SCIT/四川理工学院). Tan and Zhao\n\nworked to develop the NCPH rootkit, which was also known as GinWui. The variant GinWui.A is\nbelieved to have been an early precursor to PlugX, which was later licensed out to multiple APT\ngroups for use in offensive campaigns against western systems. This suggests both a common\nsupply chain entity providing these tools across PLA and MSS lines, and that Zhao was likely\npaid to continue to develop and refine his malicious code into first PlugX and later the evolved\nClambling RAT over several years and cycles of development.\n\n15 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connectioncomputer\n16 https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/the-connection-between-the-plugx-chinese-gang-and-the-latestinternet-explo\n17 https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-14/materials/Haruyama/Asia-14-Haruyama-I-Know-You-Want-Me-UnpluggingPlugX.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nTan applied to graduate school at Sichuan University in 2005. It was during his time there that\nTan is believed to have been approached by the PLA, which found him via his blog and his\nattempted intrusions into Japanese systems. In September 2005, he was encouraged to\nparticipate in a Network Attack/Defense Competition where he and his team won first place.[18]\nTan was found by the Chengdu Military Militia Information Sub-Unit—a unit that likely served as\nrecruitment spotters for the former 3PLA Chengdu Military Region (MR) 1st Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau (TRB) Unit 78006, which was later implicated in the Titan Rain attacks\nagainst the U.S. government.[19]\n\nFollowing the competition in October 2005, Tan and his team of former NCPH colleagues\nparticipated in an intensive 16-hour-a-day, month-long training period with the PLA designed to\nsimulate attacks, design hacking tools, and develop training courses for network infiltration\nstrategies. It is assessed that these efforts greatly improved PLA cyber operations at the time.\n\nIn the spring of 2006, Tan continued to refine the Ginwui rootkit before dropping out of school on\n30 April 2006 to pursue state-directed intrusion operations full time. From May through\nSeptember 2006, Tan and the NCPH crew likely conducted CNE operations directed against the\nU.S. DOD on behalf of the PLA. The intrusions at the time were unprecedented and are some of\nthe first examples of the PLA (and by extension the CCP) paying the salaries of hackers for hire\nto conduct CNE against the U.S.[20]\n\nFrom the timing of Tan’s blog posts during these intrusions, it is clear the PLA provided lodging\nand salaries to several young Chinese hackers as part of this campaign. Included among those\nmentioned as “colleagues” on Tan’s posts was Blackfox, the alias of fellow indicted WICKED\nPANDA member Jiang Lizhi (see Figure 6).[21] In 2007, Jiang would go on to work for offensive\ncyber PLA contractor Yanlong Tech, a technology firm regularly targeting the gaming industry—\nwhich is assessed to be activity roughly analogous to early Winnti Group operations against\nmultiple Asian and western gaming firms. It is unclear whether Tan and Jiang had met prior to\nthis hacking “internship” with the PLA, but it is likely this served as a common thread for their\nfuture endeavors together as well as the reason Yanlong did early work for the Chengdu MR\nTRB. Tan would join Yanlong reportedly only in 2011, but Jiang stayed until 2014 when he left\nto start Chengdu 404, the other contracting entity outlined in the 2020 DoJ indictment.\nDetails from Tan’s personal blog show that he also disliked his time at Sichuan University and\nwas merely there to get his degree, much preferring his “internship” colleagues and time spent\nhacking. Tan’s own former university in Zigong listed him among accomplished students for\nwinning first place in the first national computer network offensive/defensive competition and\nearning the “first-class merit award” from the PLA Chengdu MR. Other records show he\ncompeted in the Chengdu Westone Cup and took second place in 2006. Westone is a\n\n18 https://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/042809Paller.pdf?attempt=2\n19 https://web.archive.org/web/20120822123730/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,16920632,00.html\n20 Dunham, Ken, and Jim Melnick. \"Wicked Rose\" and the NCPH Hacking Group.\nfserror.com/pdf/WickedRose_andNCPH.doc\n21 https://web.archive.org/web/20060712163357/http://www.mghacker.com:80/default.asp?cateID=1\n\n\n-----\n\nsubsidiary of the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation’s (CETC) Network\nInformation Security Company and of the CETC 30th Research Institute in Sichuan. CETC is a\nknown state-owned enterprise (SOE) and benefactor and potential driver of Chinese CNE and\nintellectual property theft; the organization has conducted classified work on behalf of the PLA\nand MSS.\n\nIn April 2009, several Chinese forums reported that Tan was arrested by the Ministry of Public\nSecurity (MPS) after he reportedly conducted Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and\nblackmailed users of other popular hacking forums such as Hackbase, the magazine\nHackerXFiles, and 3800hk. Members of these groups are believed to have turned him into the\nauthorities. He faced 7.5 years in jail, however it is unclear whether he actually served any of\nthe time.[22]\n\nGiven the DoJ indictment information that he contracted for the MSS more recently, one\npotential theory is that due to his prior military contracting service, the MSS made him a plea\ndeal to continue hack-for-hire intrusion activity in exchange for commuting his sentence. Tan is\nsuspected to have reappeared in 2011 when he worked for Yanlong Tech using the alias\n_Blackwolf, reuniting with his former associates Blackfox and EvilC0de. The firm appeared to_\nhave strong ties to the gaming community and due to prior five year plans outlining the CCP’s\ndesire to become a major global force, it is believed many of the team members used their\nexperience working with kernel-level vulnerabilities modding games to conduct intrusion\noperations and target Asian and western gaming firms to steal technology and monetize ingame currency.\n\nIt is unclear why Tan left after barely a year at Yanlong, but he wasted no time getting back to\nhis criminal roots by setting up a fake antivirus firm named Anvisoft.[23] Although the firm\npurported to offer a security product, given Tan’s concurrent activities, it is likely this was a front\ncompany for other activities and that Tan began contracting for the MSS around this time.\n\nTan’s activities after 2012 are less readily accessible despite his fame. This is potentially due to\nhis online presence being scrubbed by the MSS. Registrant data for emails tied to Tan suggest\nhe was still active as a MSS contractor and consistently registering domains from 2012 to\n2019—though none that were immediately traceable to WICKED PANDA/APT41 activity. This is\npotentially indicative of him using third parties for domain registration given his own notoriety by\nthat point.\nLegal records show that from a period from June 2010 to at least April 2020, Tan was busy\nregistering several private technology firms with various focuses, serving as a legal\nrepresentative, technology director, investor, and CEO at several firms. Tan was still in\nChengdu during this period as evidenced by both the firms he registered and also the\ntechnology patents filed under his name.\n\n22 https://web.archive.org/web/20160506182604/http://www.thedarkvisitor.com/2009/04/withered-roselaw-donecomeand-got-him/\n23 https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/11/infamous-hacker-heading-chinese-antivirus-firm/#comments\n\n\n-----\n\nTan’s path follows many famous legacy Chinese hackers who served as contractors or\neducators for various state-backed entities in the late 2000s before becoming entrepreneurs in\nChina’s burgeoning cybersecurity scene throughout the 2010s. As demonstrated in countless\nother companies claiming to do only whitehat security work on behalf of the Chinese state,\nmany of the upper echelon of China’s cybersecurity companies have close ties to the CCP and\nconduct offensive operations as well as providing defense. Some of these firms, such as\nThreatbook and Qihoo 360, have established themselves as defensive cybersecurity\norganizations, but they likely also engage in offensive intrusion activities and/or vulnerability\n\nresearch on behalf of the CCP. Former Qihoo 360 executive Tan Xiaosheng (谭晓生) served as\n\na director at one of Tan’s own firms and has been previously implicated along with Qihoo for his\nties to the MSS 13th Bureau/CNITSEC.\n\nAlso of note in these indictments against WICKED PANDA/APT41 was their collection of data\nduring their intrusion campaigns which fed into a big data repository tool Tan’s co-conspirators\ncalled SonarX. These actors were particularly skilled at extracting personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) during their intrusions and finding a way to monetize it via this platform.\nFurthermore, the case showed that not only are breaches like these collecting the data, but that\nthe data sets are being organized and used for follow-on targeting of dissidents, journalists, and\nreligious figures. This proves the MSS is likely capable of using data gleaned from other\nbreaches such as 2015’s OPM breach to create targeting packages for both future cyber and\nHUMINT operations.\n\n# MSS Use of HUMINT and Cyber Operations in Tandem\n\nAnother recent DoJ/FBI case that brilliantly shows how the MSS operates is a series of\nindictments tied to a set of cyber operators named TURBINE PANDA/APT26. This actor and its\ncampaigns stand out for several reasons:\n\n  - The case resulted in the first US arrest and extradition (in partnership with EU-based\nauthorities and allies) of a high-ranking MSS intelligence officer.\n\n  - It demonstrated the MSS’s ability to use HUMINT operations and insider threats in\ntandem with cyber espionage campaigns to great effect (See Figure 7)\n\n  - MSS’s HUMINT and cyber operators frequently communicated and even attempted to\ncover one another’s tracks, demonstrating a high degree of coordination.\n\n  - MSS cyber operators were likely made up of a mixture of in-house talent and outside\ncontractors, many of which have traceable backgrounds to various Chinese patriotic\nhacking groups.\n\n  - TURBINE PANDA’s multi-year cyber campaign systematically targeted various\naerospace firms that made up the supply chain for foreign-sourced parts for China’s\nC919 airliner.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - TURBINE PANDA operators also played a role in conducting the OPM intrusion, likely\nas part of the MSS’s big data collection efforts to map US cleared government\nemployees.\n\n  - The timescale for these operations happened in quick succession; Chinese aerospace\nfirms had barely inked joint ventures with western firms before operational prep began.\n\n  - The totality of identifying key technology gaps, cyber campaigns, HUMINT operations,\nmalware development/usage, and eventual arrests offered a rare glimpse into the full\nChinese intelligence cycle from tasking to collection, analysis, and eventually a statebacked beneficiary.\n\n  - The aftermath showed an immediate reaction from the MSS from 2017 onward, which\nbanned many security researchers from traveling to overseas conferences and codified\nCNITSEC’s ability to harvest domestic vulnerability research for use in exploits. If\nanything this likely increased the potency of MSS cyber capabilities.\n\nA major focus of the CCP in the late 2000s was a Chinese-built commercial aircraft designed to\ncompete with the duopoly of western aerospace and keep pace with China’s exponentially\ngrowing middle class and their travel needs. That aircraft would become the C919—an aircraft\nroughly half the cost of its competitors, and which completed its first maiden flight in 2017 after\nyears of delays due to design flaws. But the C919 can hardly be seen as a complete domestic\ntriumph as it is reliant on a plethora of foreign-manufactured components (see Figure 8 for an\nincomplete list). Likely in an effort to bridge those gaps, TURBINE PANDA conducted cyber\nintrusions from a period of roughly 2010 to 2015 against a variety of companies that make up\nthe C919’s supply chain.\n\nSpecifically, in December 2009, the state-owned enterprise (SOE) Commercial Aircraft\n\nCorporation of China (COMAC/中国商用飞机有限责任公司) announced it had chosen CFM\n\nInternational’s (a joint venture between U.S.-based GE Aviation and French aerospace firm\nSafran, formerly Snecma) LEAP-X engine to provide a custom variant engine, the LEAP-1C, for\nthe then-newly announced C919. The deal was reportedly signed in Beijing during a visit by\nthen-French Prime Minister François Fillon.\n\nDespite the early deal with CFM, both COMAC and fellow SOE the Aviation Industry\n\nCorporation of China (AVIC/中国 航空工业集团公司) were believed to be tasked by China’s\n\nState-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC)\nwith building an “indigenously created” turbofan engine that was comparable to the LEAP-X. In\nAugust 2016, both COMAC and AVIC became the main shareholders of the Aero Engine\n\nCorporation of China (AECC/中国航空发动机集团), which produced the CJ-1000AX engine. The\n\nCJ-1000AX bears multiple similarities to the LEAP-1C, including its dimensions and turbofan\nblades.\n\nThe AECC conducted its first test in May 2018, having overcome significant difficulties in their\nfirst mockups. Though it is difficult to assess that the CJ-1000AX is a direct copy of the LEAP-X\nwithout direct access to technical engineering specifications, it is highly likely that its makers\n\n\n-----\n\nbenefited significantly from the cyber espionage efforts of the MSS, knocking several years (and\npotentially billions of dollars) off of its development time.\n\nFrom August 2017 until October 2018, the DoJ released several separate, but related\nindictments against Sakula developer Yu Pingan[24], JSSD Intelligence Officer Xu Yanjun[25], GE\nEmployee and insider Zheng Xiaoqing[26], U.S. Army Reservist and assessor Ji Chaoqun[27], and\n10 JSSD-affiliated cyber operators in the Zhang et. al. indictment[28]. What makes these DoJ\ncases so fascinating is that, when looked at as a whole, they illustrate the broad, but\ncoordinated efforts the Jiangsu State Security Department (JSSD) in Nanjing took to collect\ninformation from its aerospace targets. In particular, the operations connected to a TURBINE\nPANDA showed both traditional human-intelligence (HUMINT) operators and its cyber operators\nworking in parallel to pilfer the secrets of several international aerospace firms and even the\ndata from OPM.\n\nIt is believed that cyber targeting of aerospace firms by TURBINE PANDA cyber operators\nbegan in January 2010, almost immediately after the LEAP-X engine was chosen for the C919.\nThe Zhang indictment describes initial preparatory action using doppelganger sites to conduct\nstrategic web compromises (SWC) in combination with DNS hijacking to compromise various\naerospace firms using two China-based APT favorite pieces of malware, PlugX and Winnti, and\nmalware assessed to be unique to the group dubbed Sakula.\n\nThe same ZHANG indictment indicates that these operations were overseen by CHAI Meng (柴\n\n萌), who likely managed the JSSD’s cyber operators as a pseudo Cyber Section Chief.\n\nReporting to CHAI was the cyber operator team lead, LIU Chunliang (刘春亮\n\n/sxpdlc1r/Fangshou), who appeared to establish and maintain much of the infrastructure used in\nthe attacks on various aerospace targets as well as organize the intrusions conducted by the\n\noperators Zhang Zhanggui (张长贵/Ieanovr/Ieaonr), Gao Hongkun (高洪 坤/Mer4en7y), Zhuang\n\nXiaowei (庄枭伟/jpxxav), Ma Zhiqi (马志琪/Le Ma), and Li Xiao (李潇/zhuan86). Many of these\n\nindividuals are assessed to have storied histories in legacy underground hacking circles within\nChina dating back to at least 2004. Notably, Liu also appeared to broker the use of Sakula from\nits developer Yu, as well as the malware IsSpace (associated with SAMURAI PANDA) from its\ndeveloper Zhuang. Liu and Yu’s conversations about Sakula would be a critical factor in tying all\nof this disparate activity together as Sakula was believed to be unique to the JSSD operators\nand could be used to tie several aerospace intrusion operations into a single, long-running\ncampaign as well as the OPM intrusions.\n\n24 https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/24/yu.pdf\n25 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1099881/download\n26 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-york-man-charged-theft-trade-secrets\n27 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1096411/download\n28 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1106491/download\n\n\n-----\n\nSimultaneously, there was a HUMINT element to the JSSD’s espionage operations against\naerospace targets. Xu Yanjun, was identified in his indictment as the Deputy Division Director of\nthe Sixth Bureau of the JSSD in charge of Insider Threats. Xu affiliated himself with two cover\norganizations—Jiangsu Science and Technology Association (JAST) and the Nanjing Science &\nTechnology Association (NAST)— when interacting with potential targets. Xu also was reported\nas frequently associating with the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronomics (NUAA), a\nsignificant national defense university controlled by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information\nTechnology (MIIT), that interfaces directly with many of China’s top defense firms and stateowned enterprises. It is likely no coincidence that NUAA is a regular collaborator with stateowned enterprises (SOEs) COMAC and AVIC, the main shareholders of AECC, which went on\nto produce the LEAP-X inspired CJ1000-AX turbine engine for the C919.\n\nOver the course of several years, Xu would recruit both an insider at LEAP-X manufacturer\n\nGeneral Electric (GE), Zheng Xiaoqing, and a Chinese-born Army reservist, Ji Chaoqun (季超\n\n群). Zheng’s background appears to have made him uniquely qualified to accurately assess\n\nturbine engine schematics, and it was clear from his indictment that he had received coaching\non which sensitive information on GE’s turbine technology to access and how to use\nsteganography in an attempt to exfiltrate the information. Ji, who entered the U.S. on an F-1\nstudent visa to study electrical engineering in Chicago, was approached by Xu (initially\nundercover as an NUAA professor) in December 2013 and eventually recruited to provide\nassessments on other high-value individuals in the aerospace industry for potential recruitment\nby the MSS. Ji’s position in the U.S. Army Reserve program known as Military Accessions Vital\nto the National Interest (MAVNI) provided a perfect cover for Ji’s assessment activities, as the\nprogram focuses on potential recruitment of foreign citizens with skills pertinent to national\ninterest and legally residing in the U.S. Had it been successful, JI would have been handing Xu\nother foreign-born recruitment candidates as they were about to enter U.S. military service on\npotentially sensitive projects.\n\n# Exposure\n\nAs the frequency of MSS operations increased and attention shifted from the PLA during its\nreorganization, a mixture of anonymous reporting from a group called IntrusionTruth, private\nsector reporting, and DoJ indictments have shed more light on the MSS’s cyber operations.\nHowever, most notably, these repeated exposures do not appear to be actively hindering\ncontinued activity from MSS contractors, which have only gotten more brazen in their recent\nactivities.\n\nBeginning in May 2017, the first public exposure of MSS-affiliated entities came from an\nanonymous group known as IntrusionTruth in the form of blogs and a twitter account dropping\n(sometimes dubiously sourced) series of posts detailing personal details of MSS cyber\ncontractors and the breadcrumbs they’d left behind during their prior intrusion efforts. Over the\ncourse of several years they would out individuals tied to groups known in the private sector as\n\n\n-----\n\nGOTHIC PANDA/APT3, STONE PANDA/APT10, AURORA PANDA/APT17, KRYPTONITE\nPANDA/APT40, and other lesser known entities. These were roughly tied to provincial and\nnational level MSS bureaus and CNITSEC offices in Guangdong, Tianjin, Jinan, and Hainan\nrespectively. Though sometimes presented haphazardly in blog posts, multiple private sector\nfirms' work including CrowdStrike, Mandiant, and RecordedFuture appeared to frequently\ncorroborate IntrusionTruth’s releases. In addition, several released DoJ indictments followed\nthese mysterious releases, further corroborating that the US government knows about many of\nthese actors and their backgrounds.\n\nI will refrain from commenting much further on IntrusionTruth as anonymity is key to their\ncontinued successful operations. The MSS has previously proven it has no issues publicly\nexecuting spies or those assisting foreign powers, and their very existence is likely perceived as\na threat to the CCP.[29] However, I do believe good work is being done here and it is breaking\ndown some of the existing barriers between private sector cyber intelligence and the federal\nsector, which ultimately leads to more future collaboration.\n\nIntegral work is currently being done by all the mentioned parties to identify these threats and\nprevent them from harming US interests. However, more work is needed to assist these efforts\nwith funding and new policies centered around collective defense, active defense/offense, and\neducation of our partners, allies, and our workforces.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nThe CCP has managed to absorb new technology and strategy the U.S. has pioneered (the\nInternet, EW usage in the Gulf War, Cult of the Dead Cow’s use of Trojans, Microsoft’s source\ncode, destructive cyberweapons, etc.) and turn it into an asymmetric advantage. In a way,\nrampant Chinese cyber espionage is a monster of our own creation, but it is one that can at\nleast be curbed through carefully considered policy adjustments.\n\nOne thing is painfully clear: the strategy of “Name & Shame” does not work, and the CCP’s\nconstantly regurgitated response asking for proof and the US complying is akin to handing\nChina a report card on their intelligence gathering capabilities. Robust, two-way policies for\nsharing of threat actor information across the private and federal sector, as well as between\ninternational intelligence partners can still be incredibly useful. But naming and shaming in\nhopes of embarrassing China into changing its behavior is not the effective deterrent or\npanacea it was perhaps naively hoped to be under rule of Xi Jinping.\n\nMy recommendations, while numerous, look to combat China’s whole-of-society approach to\ngathering intelligence with our own multi-faceted active defense approach. It draws upon\n\n29 “Chinese Communist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer”, Introduction, pg. 1, Peter Mattis and Matthew\nBrazil, Naval Institute Press 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nfrustrations myself and many other hard-working patriots in both the federal and private sector\nhave experienced when trying to combat this threat for well over a decade. This involves a\nstrategy of hardening defenses, providing meaningful consequences that impose costs to APT\ngroups, and education of our partners and domestic assets.\n\n### Harden Defense\n\n  - Invest in better software solutions and data centers to un-silo and share data between\ndomestic agencies and commercial businesses. Some collaboration is happening\nbetween CISA and information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs), but it is disparate,\nusually depends on interpersonal relationships, and data is fragmented from company to\ncompany (i.e. hard to utilize effectively for collective defense). This needs to go beyond\nCISA and should involve several government agencies and counterintelligence\nstakeholders.\n\n  - Re-examine intelligence classification methods for data sharing purposes. As\ndemonstrated in several of the aforementioned DoJ cases, much of the data concerning\nChinese intrusions are “overclassified”, which unnecessarily gate keeps relevant parties\nand hampers collective defense. Sources and methods should remain classified, but\nmost cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are predominantly discoverable\nusing open source techniques and should be treated as such. Open source centers work\nand should be more accessible to the private sector.\n\n  - Increase intelligence sharing on Chinese cyber espionage with allied international\ncountries to reduce attack surfaces and increase collective defense. The US need not\nact as gatekeepers of Chinese counterintelligence when a multitude of nations and\nindustries suffer from the same affliction. Encourage two-way sharing of Indicators of\nCompromise (IOCs) and counterintelligence reports. Improve inter-agency task forces to\nshare internationally, and educate partners on removing bureaucracy from the multitude\nof cyber departments and stakeholders that currently exist. Publicly promote united\nstances with partners against China’s cyber espionage activities and more recently\ndestructive actions (HAFNIUM).\n\n  - Establish defensive partnership programs via government and private sector\ncybersecurity firms with Asian allies (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam)\nto hunt, remove Chinese adversaries from their networks, and improve overall defensive\nposture. Frankly, this should have already started for increasingly critical technology\ncompanies such as TSMC and other partners in the semiconductor supply chain.\n\n  - Re-shape public and private policies around disclosure of hacks. As both a former FBI\nand private sector cybersecurity employee I’ve seen a breakdown between the balance\nof commercial firms trying to prevent stocks from plunging by disclosing an intrusion and\n\n\n-----\n\ncounterintelligence efforts getting the timely information they need for national security\npurposes. Incentivize reporting of intrusions via trusted commercial cybersecurity\npartners or FBI/DHS and establish meaningful consequences for firms that sweep\nintrusions under the rug or attempt to cover them up. Reporting should be mandatory for\ncommercial firms receiving government money, especially defense contracts.\n\n  - More defensive options for federal (FBI, DHS) and approved private sector entities to\nremove attack surfaces and take down (and recover copies of) malicious C2\ninfrastructure. Increased sharing between federal/private stakeholders to include hosting\nproviders and domain providers. Expand existing sharing relationships to include raw\ndata in addition to technical indicators of malicious activity.\n\n### Active Defense/Offense\n\n  - More offensive options on a sliding scale for federal (DOD/NSA, CIA) entities to impose\ncost on known APT groups. Currently, there are no actions happening (or at least\npublicly known) that have dissuaded Chinese APTs from engaging in cyber espionage.\nThe CCP has done cost/benefit analysis and concluded it is currently too beneficial to its\nstrategic plans to stop these activities or to care about being implicated. In many cases,\nthese individual actors or firms are well-known to US intelligence agencies; we should\nnot be as hesitant to let our own professionals covertly degrade their ability to conduct\nfuture operations especially when there is a body of evidence of historical criminal or\ndestructive actions. Tan Dailin/WickedRose would easily fall into this category as a two\ndecade repeat offender.\n\n  - Add Chinese universities, companies, and conferences providing support to APTs or a\nproven cyber talent pipeline for the MSS/PLA to the US Commerce Department’s Entity\nList. Consider revoking visas for professors and students from Chinese universities in\nspecial cyber and technology programs that are known to receive funding/support from\nMSS/PLA or have been implicated in prior espionage cases.\n\n  - Conduct economic action to include sanctions against known CNITSEC contractors and\nentities actively supporting Chinese cyber espionage, surveillance of minority groups,\nand vulnerability miners that fail to report to affected western companies.\n\n  - Deputize and create standards and procedures around private cybersecurity companies’\nability to assist in deception and denial techniques on behalf of their customers. Think\nless “letters of marque” and more the model set by the NSA’s Accredited Cyber Incident\nResponse Services vendors.\n\n  - Draft public policies that protect valuable domestic security researchers from external\nattacks by foreign APT groups and make targeting them a punishable offense by law.\nEstablish meaningful consequences for foreign intelligence services that seek to harm,\n\n\n-----\n\nintimidate, or disrupt the work of US domestic security researchers. The recent incident\ninvolving an anonymous researcher P4x shutting down North Korea’s internet in\nretaliation to personal attacks and a lack of government support comes to mind.[30]\n\n  - Work with international law enforcement partners to apprehend and degrade MSS\ncontractor’s overseas accomplices or seize laundered funds. This hits select entities in\ntheir wallets and makes it more difficult to for them to profit off criminal activity on the\nside of their MSS operations.\n\n### Educate\n\n  - Reform the DoJ’s “China Initiative” to include more educational resources about\nMSS/PLA recruitment techniques and the consequences of spying. Students studying\nabroad are frequent targets of these efforts, but there are little efforts made to educate\nstudents from abroad on the potential consequences. Solicit input from ChineseAmericans and trained linguists to make educational videos about PRC intelligence\nrecruitment and pressure techniques, and safe steps to report it to university authorities\nand the DoJ. Require US universities to establish safe reporting spaces free of reprisal\nor public ridicule, as there are several cases of Chinese students reporting “unpatriotic”\nactivities to the MSS while abroad, damaging trust in Chinese student associations.\nThese efforts should take maximum effort to not discriminate against Chinese students\nand professors or impede normal educational exchanges.\n\n  - Sponsor “diplomatic track” cyber competitions that promote further sharing between\nChinese and western capture-the-flag/cybersecurity groups to reestablish the hacker\nspirit of healthy competition. Anyone who’s attended DEFCON or any less commercial\ncybersecurity conference will be able to tell you that for the most talented of cyber\nresearchers, they attend to share knowledge and bend technology to their will, free of\nany patriotic loyalty. Attendees are immune from threat of arrest or prosecution, which\nencourages their best to attend these events and contribute to cross-country information\nexchanges and dialogue.\n\n  - Coordinate alternate bug bounty programs with western stakeholders (Google,\nMicrosoft, Apple, Meta) to encourage Chinese researchers to responsibly disclose\nvulnerabilities. Allow Chinese-focused payment methods (Alipay, WeChat/Weixin Pay)\nwith a holding mechanism that pays out only after a designated time period where\npatching can take place and CNITSEC’s ability to cherry-pick vulnerabilities can pass.\nThis encourages more Log4j style disclosures[31] from Chinese tech firms where PRC\nintelligence is shut out from utilizing high value 0days.\n\n30 https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-hacker-internet-outage/\n31 In 2021, an Alibaba employee first reported the now infamous Log4j vulnerability to Apache, bypassing\nCCP government policies of reporting to CNITSEC first. Why the Alibaba researcher did not report the\nvulnerability to the government first is unclear, but the company lost a government contract as a result\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Continue to improve, invest in, and boost domestic US cybersecurity talent programs to\nfill the shortage of qualified professionals. Allocate funding for hiring qualified private\nsector experts as government consultants and improving federal/private partnership\nopportunities. Relax drug testing and federal application policies for cyber positions\ngiven the rapidly changing legal landscape for marijuana and psilocybin medical use\nacross many states in the US. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller advocated this\napproach in 2010 anticipating the need to bring on more qualified cyber professionals in\nthe future, and noting how many excellent applicants were turned away based on\noutdated drug policies.\n\n# Appendix and Figures\n\n_Figure 1.
