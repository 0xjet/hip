None.\n\n3. BACKGROUND\n\na. Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) regulations are designed to provide the\ngeneral parameters for port and facility security while allowing facility owners and operators\nthe discretion to determine the details of how they will comply. The result is that the owners\nand operators are responsible for assessing vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of their\nfacilities with Coast Guard oversight and guidance. The Coast Guard currently has the\nregulatory authority to instruct facilities and Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities\nregulated under MTSA to analyze computer systems and networks for potential\nvulnerabilities within their required FSA and, if necessary, FSP.\n\nb. The maritime industry continues to increase use of cyber technology. Facility operators\nuse computers and cyber dependent technologies for communications, engineering, cargo\ncontrol, environmental control, access control, passenger and cargo screening, and many\nother purposes. Facility safety and security systems, such as security monitoring, fire\ndetection, and general alarm installations increasingly rely on computers and networks.\n\nc. Collectively these technologies enable the Marine Transportation System (MTS) to\noperate with an impressive record of efficiency and reliability. While these computer and\nnetwork systems create benefits, they are inherently vulnerable and could introduce new\nvulnerabilities, that increase the potential for risk. Exploitation, misuse, or simple failure of\ncyber systems can cause injury or death, harm the marine environment, disrupt vital trade\nactivity, and degrade the ability to respond to other emergencies.\n\nd. There are many resources, technical standards, and recommended practices available to\nthe marine industry that can help their governance of cyber risks. Facility operators should\nuse those resources to promote a culture of effective and proactive cyber risk management.\n\n4. DISCLAIMER. This guidance is not a substitute for applicable legal requirements, nor is it itself\na rule. It is not intended to nor does it impose legally binding requirements on any party. It\nrepresents the Coast Guard’s current thinking on this topic and may assist industry, mariners, the\ngeneral public, and the Coast Guard, as well as other federal and state regulators, in applying\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.\n\n5. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT AND IMPACT CONSIDERATIONS.\n\na. The development of this NVIC and the general policies contained within it have been\nthoroughly reviewed by the originating office, and are categorically excluded (CE) under\ncurrent USCG CE # 33 from further environmental analysis, in accordance with Section\n2.B.2. and Figure 2-1 of the National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures\nand Policy for Considering Environmental Impacts, COMDTINST M16475.1 (series).\nBecause this NVIC implements, without substantive change, the applicable Commandant\n\n\n-----\n\nInstruction or other federal agency regulations, procedures, manuals, and other guidance\ndocuments, Coast Guard categorical exclusion #33 is appropriate.\n\nb. This NVIC will not have any of the following: significant cumulative impacts on the\nhuman environment; substantial controversy or substantial change to existing\nenvironmental conditions; or inconsistencies with any Federal, State, or local laws or\nadministrative determinations relating to the environment. All future specific actions\nresulting from the general policies in this NVIC must be individually evaluated for\ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), DHS and Coast Guard\nNEPA policy, and compliance with all other environmental mandates.\n\n6. RECORDS MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS. This NVIC has been thoroughly\nreviewed during the directives clearance process, and it has been determined there are no further\nrecords scheduling requirements, in accordance with Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 3101 et\nseq., NARA requirements, and Information and Life Cycle Management Manual, COMDTINST\nM5212.12 (series). This policy does not create significant or substantial change to existing\nrecords management requirements.\n\n7. FORMS/REPORTS. None.\n\nP. F. Thomas\nRear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard\nAssistant Commandant for Prevention Policy\n\nEncl:  (1) Cyber Security and MTSA\n(2) Cyber Governance and Cyber Risk Management Program Implementation Guidance\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cyber Security and MTSA: 33 CFR Parts 105 and 106.**\n\nUnder current regulations in 33 CFR parts 105 and 106, facilities and outer continental\nshelf (OCS) facilities (hereinafter described as “facilities”) are required to identify and\nassess security threats, and develop a Coast Guard-approved Facility Security Plan (FSP)\nto address and mitigate those threats. The specific threats are covered by the existing\nlanguage in parts 105 and 106 in general, but the Coast Guard interprets this language to\nspecifically include threats to computer systems and attacks in the electronic (cyber)\ndomain.\n\nIn this draft document, the Coast Guard is laying out its interpretation of regulatory\nprovisions in parts 105 and 106 as applicable to electronic and cybersecurity systems.\nThis enclosure discusses the specific regulatory provisions that instruct owners/operators\nof a Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) regulated facility to address\ncyber/computer system security in the Facility Security Assessment (FSA) and, if\napplicable, provide guidance within their FSPs to address any vulnerabilities identified in\nthe Facility Security Assessment (FSA). This document intends to assist the\nowner/operator in identifying cyber systems that are related to MTSA regulatory\nfunctions, or whose failure or exploitation could cause or contribute to a Transportation\nSecurity Incident. If there are electronic or cybersecurity-related vulnerabilities\nidentified in an FSA, an owner/operator may choose to provide this information in a\nvariety of formats, such as a stand-alone cyber annex to their FSP, or by incorporating\ncybersecurity procedures alongside the physical security measures of their FSP.\n\nIn many cases, companies have established cybersecurity and risk management programs\nthat provide for strong cyber defense. For those situations, the owner/operator may\ndemonstrate that those policies meet or exceed the requirements of 33 CFR parts 105 and\n106. Owners/operators that already employ a comprehensive cybersecurity plan for their\norganization, or who wish to apply a standard security program that incorporates\ncybersecurity to multiple facilities, may wish to submit a security plan under the\nAlternative Security Program, 33 CFR 101.120.\n\nOnce this guidance is finalized, an owner/operator may demonstrate compliance with the\nregulations by including cyber risks in their FSA and including a general description of\nthe cybersecurity measures taken in the FSP, if appropriate. Owners/operators do not\nneed to indicate specific or technical controls, but should provide general documentation\non how they are addressing their cyber risks.\n\n1\n\n\nSecurity Incident.

Facility\nowner/operators should consider these guidelines in conjunction with their own risk management\npolicies to help ensure they account for cyber risks.\n\n**The NIST CSF:**\n\nSections 1 - 4 utilize the NIST CSF as the recommended foundation for development of a\ncyber risk management program. The NIST CSF establishes the following functions that is\nillustrated in Figure 1:\n\n  - **Identify – The administrative structure for cyber risk management as well as the**\nhardware, software, and other components of a system.\n\n  - **Protect – The technical, administrative, physical, and other procedures to protect systems**\nfrom failure or exploitation.\n\n  - **Detect – Procedures to monitor systems and detect when they may have become**\ncompromised.\n\n  - **Respond – The initial actions and notifications needed to limit the consequences of a**\ncyber event.\n\n  - **Recover – Follow up actions needed to restore full functionality and operations.**\n\nFigure 1:\n\n1\n\n\n– The technical, administrative, physical, and other procedures to protect systems\n\n\n-----\n\n# A. Identify and Cyber Governance\nSection A is divided into two subsections (Sections 1 and 2):\n\nSection 1 on Establishing Cyber Risk Management details methods of selecting members\nfor a Cyber Risk Management Team, provides guidance on establishing Cyber Risk\nManagement Policy, and how to implement that policy with a Cyber Risk Management\nProgram. Section 2 on Enterprise Wide Inventory and Analysis details procedures for a\nthorough enterprise-wide cyber system inventory and analysis. Organizations should\nadapt this guidance to appropriately address the size, scope, operational needs, level of\ncyber network utilization, structure, and nature of operations of their individual\nenterprise.\n\n**1.** **Establishing Cyber Risk Management: Forming a Cyber Risk Management Team**\n**(CRMT), Defining Cyber Risk Management Policy, and Establishing a Cyber Risk**\n**Management Program**\n\nCyber risk management is an ongoing process of identifying and assessing vulnerabilities,\nresponding to cyber events, and adjusting policies, programs, and procedures to minimize\npotential disruption. Effective cyber risk management should start at the senior management\nlevel. Senior management should embed a culture of cyber risk awareness into all levels of an\norganization and ensure a holistic and flexible cyber risk management regime that is in\ncontinuous operation and constantly evaluated through effective feedback mechanisms.\n\n**1.1 Define Cyber Responsibilities and Create a Cyber Risk Management Team**\n\nManagement, strategic planning, and employee engagement form the foundation of efforts to\nimprove information systems and operation systems security. Without a systematic process\nto identify gaps and launch remedial action, even the most resource-intensive efforts could\nfail to adequately secure a network. As described in the NIST CSF, the “Identify” step in the\nprocess includes identifying the organizational structure responsible for assessing risk,\nestablishing priorities, and ongoing cyber governance procedures.\n\nTo assess cyber risk, management should designate a responsible individual who will\nassemble and lead the CRMT. This individual may also be the organization’s Facility\nSecurity Officer. This person should have:\n\n    - Direct access to communicate with the highest level in the organization and with\nappropriate intermediate management levels\n\n    - Responsibility to monitor cyber risk management activities for facility operations\n\n    - Authority to ensure adequate resources to meet cyber risk management objectives\n\nA robust CRMT establishes a process to both initially develop and periodically review\npolicies and program for suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

This should apply generally to all projects (e.g. a core business process, IT,\nfacility management, etc.).\n\nA multi-disciplinary CRMT with a variety of perspectives and expertise will be best able to\nidentify safety and security critical systems, recognize the consequences, should those\nsystems fail or be exploited, and establish the most effective and efficient solutions. While\ninformation technology (IT) specialists should be part of this effort, they may not fully\nrecognize the various operational systems on a waterfront, the potential consequences, should\nthey fail, or have an operator’s perspective on potential non-technical (and lower cost)\nsolutions. In short, a team consisting only of IT professionals will only identify IT related\nthreats and IT related solutions. Ideally, a risk management team will include:\n\n- Facility operators\n\n- Port engineers\n\n- Facility Security Officers\n\n- Information technology specialists\n\n- Safety management/industrial safety experts\n\n- Emergency managers\n\nA CRMT may also include third-party experts in cyber technology, risk assessment\nmethodology, or other needed skills, or individuals serving in multiple capacities within the\nteam.\n\nSome large organizations with diverse operations may centralize their cyber risk\nmanagement policies at the corporate level. While this can be useful to ensure consistency\nacross the organization, it is crucial that corporate cyber risk management policy addresses\nfacility-specific risks.

The policy should\nbe communicated to employees and relevant external parties as needed. The CRMT is a\ncritical source of input for development of effective cyber risk policy. The policy should\ninclude clear direction regarding:\n\n- Policy administration (e.g. policy implementation, maintenance, enforcement, and\n\nrevision)\n\n3\n\n\nA CRMT may also include third-party experts in cyber technology, risk assessment\nmethodology, or other needed skills, or individuals serving in multiple capacities within the\n\nSome large organizations with diverse operations may centralize their cyber risk\n\n\nvulnerabilities and operations.\n(Source: NIST SP800-82-4.2.2)\n\n**1.2 Define Cyber Risk Management Policy**\n\n\n-----\n\n- Protection of computer systems\n\n`o` Authentication (e.g. password policies)\n\n`o` Physical access control\n\n`o` Network management\n\n`o` Configuration management\n\n`o` Privilege management\n\n`o` Education and training\n\n- Detection (e.g. intrusion detection)\n\n- Response to a cyber incident\n\n- Recovery (e.g. business continuity and disaster recovery)\n\n- The ongoing role of the CRMT\n\n(Source: NIST SP800-82-4.2.1)\n\n**1.3 Create a Cyber Risk Management Program**\n\nManagement, with the input of the CRMT, should establish a cyber risk management\nprogram to ensure that employees and contractors requiring access to the organization’s\nnetworks, receive job-relevant cyber awareness training. In order to develop a managable\nand realistic program, an organization’s cyber risk management policy should take into\naccount the organzation’s risk tolerance and available resources. Key cyber risk\nmanagement measures can also involve making potentially sensitive revisions to new and\nexisting employee, supplier, and third-party contracts to ensure cyber risk management\nresponsibilities are appropriately defined. The cyber risk management policy should include\na definition of roles and responsibilities, including those expected of all users, senior\nmanagement, privileged users, third-party stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, contractors,\ncustomers, partners), and physical and information security personnel. The CRMT lead\nshould have responsibility for the development, review and evaluation of the policy, with\napproval and oversight by senior management.\n\nOne common practice to mitigate the difficulty of managing cybersecurity within\nlarge/complex organizations is to appoint an owner for each IT/OT asset, who then becomes\nresponsible for its day-to-day protection.\n\nThe suggested cyber risk management process begins with a full inventory of cyberconnected systems (see Section 2). This inventory is then used to generate a list of systems\nwhose failure or disruption would have the most severe consequences (Section 3.1). These\nsystems should then be evaluated for exploitable vulnerabilities. Based on the evaluation of\nthe severity of vulnerability, operators can prioritize systems for mitigation. While these\nfunctions are described sequentially, facility operators should think of them as a continuous,\nrepeating process.\n\n4\n\n\nManagement, with the input of the CRMT, should establish a cyber risk management\nprogram to ensure that employees and contractors requiring access to the organization’s\nnetworks, receive job-relevant cyber awareness training.

This inventory should include an on-scene survey of\ncyber-dependent equipment, to identify any systems not on current network maps. Input\nfrom operators, security personnel, and OT engineers may prove vital at this stage.\n\nPerform inventory of facility cyber and cyber connected systems using the following\nsuggested process or equivalent:\n\n2.1.1 **Map the system. Map the entire system(s) and identify hardware, connections,**\nidentify users, and major systems. One method to do this is to deploy an automated asset\ninventory discovery tool and use it to build a preliminary inventory of systems connected\nto the organization’s public and private network or networks. Automated tools enable\ntracking, updating, and custom reporting of the inventory. This software is commonly\navailable; however, it is important that the selected version be capable of examining\nproprietary and standard OT (industrial) systems as well as IT systems. Both active tools\nthat scan through network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on\nanalyzing their traffic should be employed. Identify all ports, protocols, and services\nwith validated business needs running on each system.\n\n2.1.2 **Inventory Software. Develop a complete list of authorized software (including**\ndocumentation of software versions currently in use) that is required in the organization\nfor each type of system. Include industrial equipment, printers, servers, workstations,\nlaptops, tablets, and smart phones. This list should be monitored by file integrity\nchecking tools to validate that the authorized software has not been modified beyond\nauthorized updates. This step has the additional benefit of allowing managers to\ndetermine that licenses are up to date.\n\n2.1.3 **User Census. Develop a list of authorized users for each system to include**\nauthorized levels and methods of access. Ensure out-of-date or expired profiles are\nremoved from the system.

The tables referenced in this\nsection are located in Appendix A. In evaluating potential consequences, operators should\nnot assume that cyber events will occur in isolation, or at the best possible times. Cyber\nsystems should be evaluated for both security and safety risks, as defined below.\n\n**Cybersecurity Risks – Potential for intentional disruption, compromise, or exploitation**\nof a computer network or control system by non-authorized personnel.\n\n**Cyber Safety Risks – Potential for accidental disruption of a computer network or**\ncontrol system by an owner, operator, other actor, or as an unintended consequence of a\nmishap within a connected cyber system.\n\nDeliberate cyber attacks may occur before or in conjunction with physical attacks. Less\ntargeted, but equally significant cyber events may occur when key personnel are not\navailable, other equipment is down for repair, during natural disasters, or any time when\nmultiple risk factors will be present. It is important to not only plan for consequence\nscenarios within the realm of possibility, but to objectively consider worst case scenarios.\n\nMTSA plan holders may examine consequences by reviewing the scenarios used to develop\nthe Facility Security Plans or by examining system by system, asking, “What system failures\ncould cause the worst possible consequences?” and “What is the worst possible consequence\nof a failure or disruption of this major system?”. This will create a picture of which systems\nrequire the most rigorous examination.\n\nAs with the inventory, the most effective consequence determinations will involve input from\nthe entire CRMT. Using the inventory results along with this wide ranging personnel input\nwill help reveal cascading effects where one system failure or malfunction leads to another.\nFailure of backup and failsafe systems, either electronic or manual, should be part of the\n“worst case” examined during this process.\n\nThe use of a Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) matrix will allow operators to assess the\ntotal amount of time managers are willing to accept for a mission or business process outage\nand consider all impact implications.\n\nEvent consequences are described in Table 1 (Appendix A, page 1) and will assist in\nidentifying systems for which further analysis is warranted. Consequences range in severity\nfrom Catastrophic to Insignificant. Determining the severity of consequences will be one\nfactor that, along with the presence and severity of a vulnerability, will determine the level of\n\n7\n\n\nDeliberate cyber attacks may occur before or in conjunction with physical attacks.

It is likely to have second and third-order impacts to external stakeholders,\ncompanies, and ports.\n\n**The Table 1 consequence descriptions are provided for illustrative purposes only and**\n**do not, of themselves, determine what systems require what level of protection.**\nOperators should focus further examination on systems with Catastrophic, Major, or\nModerate event consequences (those scoring 3, 4, or 5 in Table 1) as described in Table **2**\n(Appendix A, page 1). Prioritizing systems for which disruption would have the most severe\nconsequences is recommended. Operators may choose to further evaluate systems’\nvulnerabilities with event consequences in the Minor and Insignificant categories (those\nscoring 1 or 2) with the goal of protecting business systems, reputation, efficiency, safety,\nand proprietary information. Good cyber practices and hygiene are recommended throughout\norganizations.\n\nIn addition to systems that score 3, 4, or 5 in Table 1, systems that, in whole or part, perform\na function required by an FSP, such as running cameras or monitors for a restricted area,\nshould be considered high priority, similar to those scoring 3 or above, and be rigorously\nexamined for vulnerabilities, continuing with this or an equivalent process.

Table 3 (Appendix A, page 2) will assist operators in\ndetermining which systems perform or are related to these critical security and safety\nfunctions by examining the purposes and connections of each system.\n\n**3.2 Assess Vulnerabilities**\n\nNow that critical systems and functions have been identified, examining to what other\nsystems they are connected is critical to gain thorough knowledge of vulnerabilities. This\nwill be done by examining both the connections and functions of each system. To determine\nwhich systems should be examined for vulnerabilities, refer to Table 2 which provides\nguidance based on the system’s assigned consequence score from Table 1.\n\nEach major system should be evaluated using the questionnaire in Table 3, the Connective\nVector Assessment, to determine whether failure or disruption of a seemingly innocuous\nsystem might have secondary and more severe consequences.\n\nAll “YES” responses from the Connective Vector Assessment in Table 3 should be\nevaluated for vulnerability severity in the following step using Table 4 (Appendix A, page\n3), the Cyber Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment. In some cases, where a connection\nbetween systems is deemed unnecessary, “air gapping” the critical system is advisable,\nminimizing a vulnerability. An “air gap” is a system in which computers are not connected\ndirectly to the internet, or to any computers that are connected to the internet (discussed\nfurther in Section 5).\n\nOnce an organization has identified the systems of highest consequence and eliminated all\nunnecessary connections, it should examine those systems for infrastructure vulnerabilities\nusing Table 4, the Cyber Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment. Cyber infrastructure\nvulnerabilities are flaws in a cyber system’s design, configuration, maintenance,\ncommunication and data links, or software. This vulnerability assessment should be applied\nto each major system identified by the CRMT as having a consequence score of 3 or higher\n(Table 1). “NO” answers will identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited. “YES”\nanswers indicate that the element of infrastructure has appropriate security measures in place.\nIf the answer is not clearly “YES”, or is only partially “YES”, it should be marked “NO”.\n\n**3.3 Vulnerability Severity Assessment**\n\nDetermining which systems have both an infrastructure vulnerability and a vector by which it\ncould be exploited is a key factor (along with consequence of disruption, covered in Section\n3.1) in determining risk. Use Table 5 (Appendix A, pages 3-5) to assess the severity of\nvulnerabilities and prioritize systems for mitigation. This will be done by answering the\nquestionnaire for each system with a “NO” answer from the Cyber Infrastructure\nVulnerability Assessment (Table 4). Systems with the highest TOTAL score (at the bottom\nof Table 5) should be considered the most vulnerable.\n\nRecord all vulnerabilities and consequences noted during the assessment for review by the\nCOTP.

However, adequately protecting digital information and cyber dependent system does not\nusually entail a straight-forward, sequential implementation of specific mitigation measures.\nOrganizations should implement multiple layers of safeguards across a number of different\nrealms (e.g. contracting, human resource management, education and training, network design,\nphysical security, access control, etc).\n\nPrevention and protection strategies reduce vulnerabilities and the frequency of successful\nattacks or adverse events. While high-risk systems should have more robust protection\nstrategies, this does not necessarily require sophisticated technical solutions. For example,\nphysical access control and training may be sufficient for systems where the primary\nvulnerability is an insider threat. Where risk managers choose technical solutions, they should\nalso recognize their limitations. Many systems are only capable of recognizing and blocking\nknown threats. Unfortunately, malware and associated delivery mechanisms used by malicious\nactors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and a strategy that relies exclusively on a\nperimeter defense designed to filter out known threats is not likely to be successful.\n\nOperators can also reduce risk by taking steps to minimize overall impact or consequences of a\ncyber incident. Backups, kept at a remote location, can be an excellent way of building cyber\nresilience and may be appropriate for situations where the cyber failure is disruptive, but does\nnot include immediate security, safety, or environmental impacts. However, these manual\nbackups, while functional, may now be the weakest link, significantly slowing operations.\nExercises can help identify the procedures to isolate a suspect system, purge it of malware, and\nsafely resume operations. Including a cyber aspect into an existing security, natural disaster,\nsalvage/recovery, or environmental response plan can help an organization prepare for a cyber\nincident.\n\n**4.1 Protect**\n\n**4.1.1 Cyber Risk Awareness Program. Facilities should maintain, and enforce a**\ncyber risk awareness program for employees and contractors. The awareness program\nshould ensure that new and existing employees, as well as contractors requiring access to\nthe organization’s IT/OT networks, receive job-relevant training and direction related to\nthe organization’s cyber risk management policy. This includes enhancing staff’s cyber\nrisk awareness (i.e., what can happen as a result of poor cyber practices) and cyber\npreparedness (i.e., ensuring that staff are doing all they can to improve the organization’s\ncyber integrity). The cyber risk awareness program could include guidance related to the\nfollowing:\n\n    - Internet and email use policy\n\n    - Safe use of personal devices (e.g. ensuring work done off-site on personal computers\nis as safe as possible)\n\n    - Safe use of removable media (e.g., USB keys, CD’s, external hard drives)\n\n    - Safe use and storage of company mobile devices\n\n10\n\n\nOperators can also reduce risk by taking steps to minimize overall impact or consequences of a\ncyber incident.

Define and communicate rules regarding the**\nacceptable use of cyber systems. Prior to gaining access to the organization’s cyber\nsystems, employees and external party users should be made aware of (and agree to) the\nconstraints and responsibilities associated with the use of these systems. These\nconstraints should be reflected in the organization’s cyber risk management policy.\n\nLimit administrative privileges to very few users who have both the knowledge necessary\nto administer the operating system and a business need to modify the configuration of the\nunderlying operating system. This will help limit installation of unauthorized software\nand other abuses of administrator privileges.\n\n**4.1.3 Access Control.**\nEstablish and implement a process to manage secret authentications (e.g., passwords,\ntokens, cryptographic keys, etc.). The use of Single Sign Ons (SSO) – 0Tan authentication\nprocess that permits a user to enter one name and password in order to access multiple\napplications – is one strategy for managing authentications. SSO 0Tcan reduce the amount\nof secret authentication information that users are required to protect and thus can\nincrease the effectiveness of this control (the more authentication-related information\nusers are asked to remember, the more likely they are to forget it or write it down). In\norder to protect access to critical systems, a secure password management system should:\n\n  - Enforce the use of individual user IDs and passwords to maintain accountability\n\n  - Allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation\nprocedure to allow for input errors\n\n  - Enforce a choice of quality passwords\n\n  - Force users to change their passwords at the first log-on\n\n  - Enforce regular password changes and as needed\n\n  - Maintain a record of previously used passwords and prevent re-use\n\n  - Not display passwords on the screen when being entered\n\n  - Store password files separately from application system data\n\n  - Store and transmit passwords in protected form (if passwords are transmitted in\nclear text during the log-on session over a network, they can be captured by a\nnetwork \"sniffer\" program)\n\nThe password management system should reflect that overly complicated passwords,\nwhich are changed too frequently, are at risk of being written on a piece of paper and kept\nnear the computer.

For\nbusiness-to-business relationships, access control measures could include:\n\n  - Clearly identified roles and responsibilities\n\n  - Customized warning banners\n\n  - Limit on privileges\n\n  - Logging of all critical/non-critical transactions by users\n\n  - Detailed logs of transactions\n\n  - Use of digital signatures\n\n  - Filtering of outgoing traffic to prevent spoofing\n\n  - Routing of traffic used for Internet access services through a small number of\ncontrolled security gateways\n\nThe use of firewall and access control lists for traffic through corporate systems such that\nexternal parties have access only to the functions needed should also be considered. This\nis particularly important where suppliers need to upload systems upgrades or perform\nremote servicing.\n\nFor business-to-customer service relationships, all identified security requirements should\nbe addressed before giving customers access to the organization's information or assets.\nFor example:\n\n  - Procedures to protect the organization's assets, including information and\nsoftware, and management of known vulnerabilities;\n\n  - Procedures to determine whether any compromise of the assets, e.g., loss or\nmodification of data, has occurred; and\n\n  - Restrictions on copying and disclosing information.\n\nSpecific access control measures could include:\n\n  - Use of virus checking software on the gateways to the Internet\n\n  - Scanning files and stored information for viruses, trojans and other forms of\nmalware\n\n  - Data/file integrity verification using algorithms such as hash/checksums,\ncertificates\n\n  - Routing of traffic used for Internet access services through a small number of\ncontrolled security gateways\n\n  - Limit permissions of web applications when accessing backend databases\n\n  - Network segmentation and security tiers within a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) – a\n\n17Tnetwork17T45T design where publicly accessible servers are placed on a separate,\n\n12\n\n\nThe use of firewall and access control lists for traffic through corporate systems such that\nexternal parties have access only to the functions needed should also be considered.

One method of managing the security of large networks**\nis to divide them into separate network zones (i.e., domains) or organizational units. The\nmost common approach for managing such an approach is through network segmentation\nand segregation.\n\nWhile network segregation and segmentation can involve the physical separation of\nnetworks, it generally relies on the use of firewalls and/or Virtual Local Area Networks\n(VLANs) to segment the organization’s network(s) into multiple zones with varying\nsecurity requirements. Both tools – of which there are a variety of options, each with its\nown capabilities/uses – can be layered and/or used in combination to increase network\nsecurity. Firewalls and VLANS should be configured (e.g. through access lists) to\nenforce access management rules set by the organization.\n\nMost accepted national standards recommend segregating functional systems into\nseparate network zones using such methods as air gapping. Figure 1 illustrates an “air\ngap” between business and control systems networks.\n\n**Figure 1: System Segregation, “Air Gapping”**\n\nInternet\n\nWeb Application eMail\n\nFirewall Server Servers Servers\n\nRouter\n\nBUSINESS Workstations Printers Security File\nNETWORK Update Server Server\n\n**AIR GAP**\n\nCONTROL SYSTEM Engineering\nNETWORK Workstation\n\nProgrammable Logic\nController\n\n**x x x x x x x x x x** **FI** FlowIndicator\n\nHuman Machine Interface **x x x x x x x x x x** **LI** LevelIndicator\n\nTransfer Facility Emergency\nPump Shutdown Valve\n\nMinimize connections between business and operational technology.

Employees and contractors should be aware that anti-malware\nsoftware does not remove their responsibilities within the organization’s cyber\nrisk management policy.\n\n4.1.5.2  Establish safe and secure processes to track and manage system updates\n(i.e., configuration management). Ensure procedures that provide comprehensive\nupdates to all hardware and software installations (including routers, switches,\nfirewalls and other elements of the network infrastructure) are properly managed\nand documented system-wide, thus improving the organization’s security posture.\n\n4.1.5.3  Ensure that remote access of organizational assets is approved, logged,\nand performed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. Leverage the use\nof VPNs with strong authentication systems and effective segmentation and\nsegregation to allow for secure remote access.\n\nExtra precaution should be given to remote maintenance, as this function often\nrequires access to sensitive network areas. Remote maintenance of organizational\nassets should be approved, logged, and performed in a manner that prevents\nunauthorized access.\n\n4.1.5.4  Ensure physical access control to areas where cyber assets are stored or\nused. The physical location of the IT/OT infrastructure within a site (e.g., on\nboard a waterfront facility) is important to consider, particularly with a view to\nrestricting access and maintaining physical security of the network installation\nand access to control points.\n\n14\n\n\nestablish a protective perimeter and layered defenses around critical equipment.\n\n4.1.5.1  Install, maintain, and update anti-virus/anti-malware systems across the\ncorporate network.

To protect against risks resulting from the use\nof legacy systems, where adequate security measures cannot be implemented,\norganizations should consider the following:\n\n    - Life cycle management (migrating to new systems)\n\n    - Customized support from vendors/specialists\n\nSimilarly, organizations should consider how best to handle obsolete IT/OT\nhardware, which are no longer maintained by the manufacturer (e.g., computers,\nservers, hard disks, removable media).\n\n4.1.5.8  Establish and implement controls regarding access to cyber systems from\noff-site (e.g. tele-working), or at remote sites (e.g. field office). Organizations\nallowing remote activities should issue a policy that defines the conditions and\nrestrictions of off-site activities. In addition, organizations should ensure the\nsecurity of personal computers, mobile phones, or other devices, used to access\ncyber systems (e.g. home working or travel outside the normal work location).\n\nIn addition to general security controls applicable to all devices that access an\norganization’s cyber systems, the organization should ensure that mobile devicespecific risk management considerations are also taken into account. For\nexample, consideration should be given to the following:\n\n    - User training\n\n    - Physical security of mobile devices (i.e., off-site use and protection of\ndevices)\n\n    - Relatively weaker wireless security protocols.\n\n    - Inactivity timer lock policy\n\n    - Disabling of unused wireless interfaces, services and applications to\nmitigate against unauthorized access.\n\n15\n\n\nLife cycle management (migrating to new systems)\nCustomized support from vendors/specialists\n\nSimilarly, organizations should consider how best to handle obsolete IT/OT\nhardware, which are no longer maintained by the manufacturer (e.g., computers,\n\n4.1.5.8  Establish and implement controls regarding access to cyber systems from\noff-site (e.g. tele-working), or at remote sites (e.g. field office).

Run penetration testing of the organization’s critical IT/OT\ninfrastructure, if feasible. Penetration tests of critical IT/OT infrastructure can\ndetect whether the actual cybersecurity level matches the level set forth in the\ncyber risk management policy. Penetration tests performed by external\nexperts employ attacks using both cyber and social engineering-based\nelements.\n\n4.2.5 Deploy and Update Intrusion Detection Systems. Deploy intrusion detection\nand protection systems as appropriate. Ensure the software is properly installed,\nconfigured, maintained, and updated. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)\nwork by monitoring and analyzing network traffic, then generating and\ndisseminating suspicious activity alerts in real time. Organizations may also\nchoose to incorporate Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). IPS, an extension of\nthe IDS, monitors, logs and reports on network activity and attempts to block\nmalicious traffic with the potential to compromise critical systems once detected.\nThe majority of IDS and IPS are attack Signature Based, comparing known\nthreats against observed events to identify possible incidents. Therefore, the\nvalue of the system is only as good as the attack signature database against which\nevents are analyzed. IDS may also leverage Anomaly Based Detection, which\ncompares definitions of what activity is considered normal against observed\nevents to identify significant deviations at the system level. Anomaly-based\nsystems rely on profiles representing the normal behavior of such things as users,\nhosts, network connections, or applications. Profiles are developed by monitoring\nthe characteristics of typical activity over a period of time.\n\nFinally, IDS may also use more complex Protocol Analysis, which attempts to\nidentify deviations between what are generally accepted activities at the\n_application level against observed events._\n\nGiven the differing characteristics and complexities of different IDS/IPS, at a\nminimum, the following factors should be considered when selecting intrusion\ndetection software:\n\n    - Timeliness of updates\n\n    - Effectiveness of internal distribution\n\n    - Implementation\n\n    - System impact\n\nIt is also important to note that technology alone is not sufficient to detect system\nintrusions. Organizations should ensure that the evaluation, selection, installation,\noperation, and maintenance of intrusion detection software are performed by\nqualified technical staff. For example, IDS should be configured to closely\nmonitor traffic taking place within network zones housing critical information.\nThis support should be integrated in the organization’s cyber risk management\npolicy.\n\n18\n\n\nevents are analyzed.

Response procedures are therefore necessary. An incident\nresponse plan will detail the response priorities, roles, and responsibilities of personnel,\nprocedures and communication process necessary to effectively respond to a cyber incident.\nA planned response to an incident can aid in minimizing disruption/damage, recover\ncompromised data and preserve evidence for legal action.\n\n4.3.1 Investigate Notifications. Ensure that notifications from monitoring systems\nare investigated in a timely manner. If monitoring reveals an anomaly,\norganizations should be able to quickly determine whether the cause is a security\nincident, a hardware or software problem, or an increase in client demand.\n\nTo better inform the subsequent response, investigators should be able to\nascertain:\n\n     - When did the cyber breach occur and is it ongoing?\n\n     - Where did it originate? Internally or externally?\n\n     - How and why did the cyber incident occur? For example, did a malicious\nintruder exploit a network vulnerability, or did an employee accidentally\nexercise poor cyber hygiene?\n\n     - What was compromised (e.g., intellectual property, data, network operations,\netc.)? (consider primary effects and secondary effects)\n\n**_Communication on the incident should involve pertinent internal and external_**\n**_stakeholders in accordance with legal reporting requirements._**\n\n4.3.2 Plan Thoroughly. Develop, manage, execute, and regularly exercise\ncontingency response and incident management plans. The plan should be\nconcise and accessible to those with responsibilities defined in the plans. The\npurpose and scope of each specific plan should be defined, agreed by the\norganization and top management, and understood by those who will invoke the\nplan. Reference other relevant plans or documents within the organization,\nparticularly business continuity plans, security plans, and oil/hazardous material\nincident response plans. Cyber response plans should include details regarding\nresponse-related considerations, including:\n\n      - Roles and responsibilities (e.g., who has decision-making authority, when to\ncall in external experts, as well as who to communicate with);\n\n      - Incident thresholds and activation triggers;\n\n      - Incident handling and escalation procedures (e.g. order of operations, consider\nthe following process:\n\n19\n\n\nWhen did the cyber breach occur and is it ongoing?\nWhere did it originate?

It is important that\nresponse plans be available in non-electronic formats as some types of cyber\nincidents can include the deletion of data, and/or the disabling of system\nfunctions/communication links. Exercise cyber response plans as part of MTSA\nand other existing contingency plans. It is recommended that operators hold\nthese exercises at the strategic level involving senior management, as well as at\nthe tactical level involving key operational personnel.\n\n4.3.3 **Limit Consequences. Include controls to deal with loss of computer based**\nsystems and cyber networks, such as a denial of service attack. The plan should\naddress actions necessary to minimize, if not eliminate, propagation of the\nincident.

Define and\napply procedures for the identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of\ninformation related to the cyber incidents. Consider the use of external experts\nwho are skilled in conducting interviews and retracing the behaviour of people\nwho had access to protected information. These external experts may help to\nensure no digital evidence is overlooked and can assist at any stage of a digital\nforensics investigation or litigation.

New threats and unanticipated vulnerabilities could emerge, potentially allowing\ncritical systems and functions to be compromised or disrupted. The ability to restore a\nsystem via backup data or software is an important element in cyber recovery planning.\nEffective cyber recovery processes can aid in minimizing financial loss, maintain customer\nand public confidence, and prevent future cyber incidents.\n\nTaking steps to put in place backups and alternative methods of carrying out core business\nand supporting functions allows an organization to continue operations and maintain\ncontinuity of safety and security processes despite a cyber attack. These redundancies and\nmitigation measures will prove valuable not only in the event of a cyber incident, but also\nduring the recovery phase of a non-cyber safety or security event.\n\nFacility operators should ensure that they have identified the sources of any backup data or\nsoftware needed to restore critical functions in a timely manner. Storage areas (e.g.\nlockers/closets) may need additional capabilities such as dehumidifiers or water resistant\nclosures to protect electronic equipment stored in the maritime environment.\n\n4.4.1 Back Up Information. Create, manage, and periodically test backup copies of\ninformation, software and system images per cyber risk management policy.\nProvide adequate backup facilities to ensure that all essential information and\nsoftware can be recovered following a disaster, cyber attack, or media failure.\n\n4.4.2 **Protect Back Up Storage. Ensure that backups are adequately protected via**\nphysical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are\nmoved across the network. Require the creation of multiple backups over time, so\nthat, in the event of malware infection, restoration can be from a version that is\nbelieved to predate the original infection. Consideration should be given to the\nprotection of remote backups and cloud services. Ensure that key systems have at\nleast one backup destination that is not automatic and should be initiated by an\noperator.\n\n4.4.3 **Maintain/Establish Redundancies. Ensure that redundancies are in places for**\ncritical systems. Identify safety, security, and operations requirements to identify\nand prioritize cyber systems with high availability requirements. Where the\navailability cannot be guaranteed using the existing systems architecture,\nredundant systems should be considered. Where applicable, redundant cyber\nsystems should be tested to ensure they work as intended. Train workers on\nengaging manual systems to re-establish or maintain operations. In many cases,\nnon-cyber measures and process can serve as effective redundancies and can limit\nan organization’s vulnerabilities in a high-threat cyber environment. For instance,\nin the event of a cyber incident that compromises the transfer pumps at a bulk\nliquid facility a manual float switch can be used on a bulk liquid tank to cut power\nto a fill pump to prevent overfilling the tank.

Develop, manage, execute (as appropriate), and regularly**\nexercise recovery plans for cyber incidents that compromise critical systems.\nRecovery plans (i.e. business continuity plans and disaster recovery plans) should\nbe concise and accessible to those with responsibilities defined in the plans. The\npurpose and scope of each specific plan should be defined, agreed to by the\nCRMT and senior management, and understood by those who will invoke the\nplan. Any relationship to other relevant plans or documents within the\norganization, particularly to business continuity plans, should be clearly\nreferenced and the method of obtaining and accessing these plans described. The\nfollowing is a non-exhaustive list of elements that should be contained in\norganizational recovery plans:\n\n    - the critical cyber dependent services to be recovered;\n\n    - the timelines in which they are to be recovered;\n\n    - the recovery levels needed for each critical service activity; and,\n\n    - the circumstances under which each plan can be invoked.\n\n4.4.5 Integrate Cyber Recovery into Enterprise Recovery Plan. Include cyber risk\nmanagement within the business continuity and disaster recovery management\nprocesses. Existing business continuity or resumption plans can be implemented\nto restore operations and maintain essential mission functions to supplement\nand/or restore computer networks. Cyber networks should be tested prior to\nresuming full operational capability to verify the problem is isolated and the\nnetwork is not vulnerable to a similar, or the same, threat.\n\n4.4.6 Communication.
