But when\nMalwareHunterTeam tracked down the RAT's homepage, he discovered that Darktrack's\ncreator was offering it for free, and pledging to do so forever.\n\nMalwareHunterTeam had come across Darktrack version 4.0. In the meantime, after the\nresearcher's tip-off, Softpedia has been keeping an eye out for Darktrack mentions online,\ntrying to see how this RAT evolved.\n\nAs it turns out, on the same day that MalwareHunterTeam discovered version 4.0, Luckyduck\nopened a thread on one of the largest underground hacking forums, teasing an upcoming\nversion called Darktrack Alien+ 4.1.\n\n\"The previous [4.0] version was also at least as good as the current 'best selling' RATs,\"\nMalwareHunterTeam told Softpedia. \"If the new version will be even better, and still free,\ndon't think there is any reason to buy a paid RAT.\"\n\n## Malware author doing business on the public Internet\n\nAnswering questions from other forum users, Luckyduck said that a new and improved\nversion was very close to its release. On September 4, Luckyduck uploaded a video on\nYouTube (now delisted, check udpate at the end of the article) showing Darktrack Alien+ 4.1\nduring early tests.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Darktrack RAT GUI_\nThe malware coder also runs a dedicated website for Darktrack on the public Internet. He\nalso runs a support topic, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ pages, and brazenly lists his\n[Skype ID. His YouTube channel also features many Darktrack tutorials.](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Fax-Telephony/Skype.shtml)\n\nDomain whois information returns the details of a man named Ekrem Karatas from Istanbul,\nTurkey. This may be a fake identity, so we wouldn't put too much trust into this information.\nPerforming a strict Google search for this person's Gmail address returns only results\nassociated with the Darktrack domain.\n\n## Darktrack comes with a keylogger, DDoS module, more\n\nAccording to his forum post, this free RAT is choke-full with all types of features you've\npreviously seen in commercial RATs such as Orcus or JBifrost (Adwind).\n\nHere is just a short list of advertised features. You can read the full list at the end of this\narticle. According to its forum post and official website, Darktrack comes with the ability to\nconnect to remote computers and access their filesystem, the ability to spy via webcams, log\nkeystrokes, dump passwords, and perform network stress tests (DDoS attacks).\n\nThere is also a port scanner, an interface to interact with the victim's task scheduler, a\nsystem monitoring tool, a clipboard data logger, a startup program manager, a hosts file\neditor, a Windows Registry editor, the ability to execute commands on infected PCs, and\ninteract with local processes and services.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlmost everything you find in commercial RATs is included. Maybe a good plugin system is\nwhat could be a reason for buying a commercial RAT if Darktrack does not have one,\"\nMalwareHunterTeam also added. \"But I think average skids don't care.\"\n\n**UPDATE [September 14, 2016]: Following our article and the attention the RAT received**\nfrom security researchers, Luckyduck shut down the Draktrack website and published the\nfollowing message.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Message on Darktrack website after it shut down_\n© 2001-2022 Softpedia.
