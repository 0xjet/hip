They were\nrunning on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server software used to provide\nenterprise-level email service.\n\nThrough January and February 2021, certain hacking groups exploited zero-day\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server software to access email accounts and place\nweb shells for continued access. Web shells are pieces of code or scripts that enable remote\nadministration. Other hacking groups followed suit starting in early March after the\nvulnerability and patch were publicized.\n\n\n-----\n\nMany infected system owners successfully removed the web shells from thousands of\ncomputers. Others appeared unable to do so, and hundreds of such web shells persisted\nunmitigated. This operation removed one early hacking group’s remaining web shells which\ncould have been used to maintain and escalate persistent, unauthorized access to U.S.\nnetworks. The FBI conducted the removal by issuing a command through the web shell to\nthe server, which was designed to cause the server to delete only the web shell (identified by\nits unique file path).\n\n“Today’s court-authorized removal of the malicious web shells demonstrates the\nDepartment’s commitment to disrupt hacking activity using all of our legal tools, not just\nprosecutions,” said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department’s\nNational Security Division. “Combined with the private sector’s and other government\nagencies’ efforts to date, including the release of detection tools and patches, we are\ntogether showing the strength that public-private partnership brings to our country’s\ncybersecurity. There’s no doubt that more work remains to be done, but let there also be no\ndoubt that the Department is committed to playing its integral and necessary role in such\nefforts.”\n\n“Combatting cyber threats requires partnerships with private sector and government\ncolleagues,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer B. Lowery of the Southern District of Texas.\n“This court-authorized operation to copy and remove malicious web shells from hundreds of\nvulnerable computers shows our commitment to use any viable resource to fight cyber\ncriminals. We will continue to do so in coordination with our partners and with the court to\ncombat the threat until it is alleviated, and we can further protect our citizens from these\nmalicious cyberbreaches.”\n\n“This operation is an example of the FBI’s commitment to combatting cyber threats through\nour enduring federal and private sector partnerships,” said Acting Assistant Director Tonya\nUgoretz of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “Our successful action should serve as a reminder to\nmalicious cyber actors that we will impose risk and consequences for cyber intrusions that\nthreaten the national security and public safety of the American people and our international\npartners. The FBI will continue to use all tools available to us as the lead domestic law\nenforcement and intelligence agency to hold malicious cyber actors accountable for their\nactions.”\n\nOn March 2, Microsoft announced that a hacking group used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities\nto target computers running Microsoft Exchange Server software. Various other hacking\ngroups also have used these vulnerabilities to install web shells on thousands of victim\ncomputers, including those located the United States. Because the web shells the FBI\nremoved each had a unique file path and name, they may have been more challenging for\nindividual server owners to detect and eliminate than other web shells.\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout March, Microsoft and other industry partners released detection tools, patches\nand other information to assist victim entities in identifying and mitigating this cyber incident.\nAdditionally, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a\n[Joint Advisory on Compromise of Microsoft Exchange Server on March 10. Despite these](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/10/fbi-cisa-joint-advisory-compromise-microsoft-exchange-server)\nefforts, by the end of March, hundreds of web shells remained on certain United Statesbased computers running Microsoft Exchange Server software.\n\nThis operation was successful in copying and removing those web shells. However, it did not\npatch any Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day vulnerabilities or search for or remove any\nadditional malware or hacking tools that hacking groups may have placed on victim networks\nby exploiting the web shells. The Department strongly encourages network defenders to\nreview Microsoft’s remediation guidance and the March 10 Joint Advisory for further\nguidance on detection and patching.\n\nThe FBI is attempting to provide notice of the court-authorized operation to all owners or\noperators of the computers from which it removed the hacking group’s web shells. For those\nvictims with publicly available contact information, the FBI will send an e-mail message from\nan official FBI e-mail account (@FBI.gov) notifying the victim of the search. For those victims\nwhose contact information is not publicly available, the FBI will send an e-mail message from\nthe same FBI e-mail account to providers (such as a victim’s ISP) who are believed to have\nthat contact information and ask them to provide notice to the victim.\n\nIf you believe you have a compromised computer running Microsoft Exchange Server, please\ncontact your local FBI Field Office for assistance. The FBI continues to conduct a thorough\nand methodical investigation into this cyber incident.\n\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[USAO - Texas, Southern](http://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx)\n\n\n-----",
