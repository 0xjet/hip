Data exfiltration extortion continues to be prevalent and we have\nreached an inflection point where the vast majority of ransomware attacks now include the\ntheft of corporate data. Q1 saw a reversal of average and median ransom amounts. The\naverages in Q1 were pulled up by a raft of data exfiltration attacks by one specific threat\nactor group that opportunistically leveraged a unique vulnerability (more on this below).\n\n## Average and Median Ransom Payments in Q1 2021\n\nAverage Ransom Payment\n\n$220,298\n+43% from Q4 2020\n\nMedian Ransom Payment\n\n$78,398\n+59% from Q4 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n_Average and Median Ransom Payments_\n\nThe average ransom payment increased 43% to $220,298 from $154,108 in Q4 of 2020.\nThe median payment in Q1 also increased to $78,398 from $49,450, a 58% increase.\nAverages and median were pulled higher by a small number of threat actor groups, most\nspecifically CloP, that were extremely active during Q1 and impacted large victims with very\nhigh ransom demands. As the data exfiltration tactic has proliferated, the risk / reward\ncharacteristics of paying to suppress a leak has not changed. We first noted this trend in our\n[Q3 report; victims of data exfiltration extortion have very little to gain by paying a cyber](https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report)\ncriminal, and despite the increase in demands, and higher prevalence of data theft, we are\nencouraged that a growing number of victims are not paying. Over hundreds of cases, we\nhave yet to encounter an example where paying a cyber criminal to suppress stolen data\n_helped the victim mitigate liability or avoid business / brand damage. On the contrary, paying_\ncreates a false sense of security, unintended consequences and future liabilities. Coveware’s\nposition remains unchanged and we advise victims of data exfiltration extortion to assume\nthe following:\n\nThe data will not be credibly destroyed. Victims should assume it will be traded to other\nthreat actors, sold, misplaced, or held for a second/future extortion attempt.\n\nExfiltrated data custody was held by multiple parties and not secured. Even if the threat\nactor deletes a volume of data following a payment, other parties that had access to it\nmay have made copies so that they can extort the victim in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data may be deliberately or mistakenly published before a victim can even respond\nto an extortion attempt.\n\nComplete records of what was taken may not be delivered by the threat actor, even if\nthey explicitly promise to provide such artifacts after payment.\n\n## 77% of Ransomware Attacks Involved the Threat to Leak Exfiltrated Data (+10% From Q4 2020)\n\nThe percentage of ransomware attacks that included a threat to release stolen data\nincreased from 70% in Q4, to 77% in Q1. The majority of ransomware attacks that involve\ndata exfiltration have two main goals 1) exfiltrate corporate data from the most convenient\nfile server 2) escalate privileges and deploy ransomware on as many endpoints as possible.\nMost RaaS affiliates purchase network access and use stolen data solely as additional\nleverage against the victim. This means that despite the threats, threat actors rarely take the\ntime to steal data that any other criminals or interested parties would want to purchase. The\nstolen data is just proof that the attack occurred and sometimes creates legal obligations for\nthe victim.\n\nThe CloP ransomware group took a very different strategy in their Q1 exploitation of\n[Accellion’s FTA product. Beginning in late December and continuing through much of Q1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/global-accellion-data-breaches-linked-to-clop-ransomware-gang/)\n[CloP exploited two zero day vulnerabilities that allowed for remote code execution within](https://www.accellion.com/sites/default/files/trust-center/accellion-fta-attack-mandiant-report-full.pdf)\nunpatched Accellion FTA instances. This was a highly sophisticated and targeted exploitation\nof a single software appliance, only used by a handful of enterprises. The CloP group may\nhave purchased the exploit used in the initial stages of the attack, so as to have exclusive\nuse. This behavior stands in stark contrast to how most unauthorized network access is\nbrokered through the cyber extortion supply chain to any willing purchaser post exploitation.\nMoreover, the Accellion exploit did not allow for the deployment of ransomware across the\nvictims environment, so data theft from the appliance was the sole target of CloPs campaign\nfrom the outset.\n\nUnlike most exploits used by ransomware threat actors, unpatched Accellion FTA instances\nare rare (likely less than 100 total), especially when compared to vulnerable RDP instances\nwhich number hundreds of thousands globally. CloP’s confidence that such a small number\nof targets would yield a positive financial return must have been high and, unfortunately, they\nwere correct. Dozens of CloP victims were extorted for tens of millions of dollars even though\nthe majority of the victims opted not to pay and were subsequently doxxed on the CloP leak\nsite. As of early April, the CloP/Accellion campaign seems to have run its course, and the\nCloP group has returned to using traditional network access vectors and encryption\nransomware in its attacks.\n\n## Most Common Ransomware Variants in Q1 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**Rank** **Ransomware Type** **Market Share %** **Change in Ranking from Q4 2020**\n\n1 Sodinokibi 14.2% \n2 Conti V2 10.2% +4\n\n3 Lockbit 7.5% +6\n\n4 Clop 7.1% New in Top Variants\n\n5 Egregor 5.3% -3\n\n6 Avaddon 4.4% +3\n\n7 Ryuk 4.0% -4\n\n8 Darkside 3.5% New in Top Variants\n\n9 Suncrypt 3.1% -1\n\n9 Netwalker 3.1% -5\n\n10 Phobos 2.7% -1\n\n_Top 10: Market Share of the Ransomware attacks_\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service operations ratcheted up the competition for affiliates and\ncredibility in Q1. As these groups have grown in size, so has associated operational\ncomplexity and risk. Some failures of operating a criminal enterprise at scale were observed\nduring Q1 include:\n\n[Egregor: Sunsetting operations only 4 months after taking the torch from the Maze](http://10.10.0.46/egregor-ransomware)\ngroup.\n\nNetwalker: Ceased activities following a complete law enforcement take down of\ninfrastructure and arrest of affiliate participants.\n\n[Conti: Growing pains as their outsourced chat operations complicated victim recoveries](http://10.10.0.46/conti-ransomware)\nand negotiations. Additionally, Conti has also been re-attacking prior victims and\nlaunching new attacks shortly after an initial attack was sustained. A practice at odds\nwith a RaaS organization interested in maintaining a reputation that compels victims to\npay a ransom.\n\n[Lockbit: Technical flaws in the ransomware that resulted in data loss of encryption](http://10.10.0.46/lockbit-ransomware)\nvictims. The group has also been associated with numerous re-extortion demands.\n\n[Sodinokibi: Technical flaws that resulted in victims unable to match encryption keys,](http://10.10.0.46/sodinokibi-ransomware)\nresulting in total data loss.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackKingdom: Attempted a mass exploit of exchange webshells, but flaws in their\nencryption led to permanent data loss.\n\nA new trend in Q1, several RaaS operations turned their focus to developing encryption\nmodules for Unix and Linux. We have now observed this development from Defray777,\n[Mespinoza, Babuk, Nephilim and Darkside. Sodinokibi is also making rumblings about](http://10.10.0.46/nephilim-ransomware)\nreleasing a Unix version. Victims running Unix and Linux should expect complications and\ndata loss. Early versions of any ransomware generally include bugs that the threat actors\neither don’t know about or don’t care to fix before targeting victims.\n\n## Most Common Ransomware Attack Vectors in Q1 2021\n\n_Ransomware attack vectors: RDP compromise, email phishing, software vulnerability, and_\n_others._\n\nIn Q1 compromised remote desktop protocol connections regained the top position as the\nmost common attack vector. RDP remains a frustratingly common vulnerability despite well\n[known secure remote connection best practices. Phishing emails that install credential](https://www.coveware.com/blog/dont-become-a-ransomware-target-secure-rdp)\nstealing malware, or a remote access trojan also remain a common attack vector. Like RDP,\ndefense techniques that include least privilege and two factor authentication can easily limit\nthe ability of an attacker to escalate privileges beyond the initially compromised machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Defending against the escalatory impact of a successful phishing attack requires no new](https://www.coveware.com/blog/reduce-ransomware-risk-by-90-for-free-in-one-day)\nhardware or software, just the will to implement and follow simple tools and configurations\nproperly.\n\n## Attack Vectors used by the Top Three Ransomware Variants\n\n_Top 3 Ransomware Types: Sodinokibi, Conti V2, and Lockbit._\n\nThe most common software vulnerabilities exploited during Q1 involved VPN appliances,\nsuch at [Fortinet and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-fixes-critical-vulnerabilities-in-ssl-vpn-and-web-firewall/) [Pulse Secure. Several RaaS services leveraged these VPN](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-110a)\nvulnerabilities during Q1. Again, it is likely that the actual RaaS operators and affiliates were\nNOT the party that achieved network access via these vulnerabilities, but rather specialist\nactors that harvest network credentials and are specifically trained to mass scan for\nvulnerable IP addresses. These specialists then resell network access to ransomware\naffiliates who use the access to stage the extortion phase of the attack. This deliberate\ndivision of labor sheds light on how open RaaS operations that focus on smaller victims, like\nLockbit, were able to take advantage of vulnerabilities outside of their skillset. Specialization\nand supply chain coordination also highlights the continued evolution of the cyber extortion\neconomy.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attack Vectors used by Ransomware Actors on Different Sized Victims\n\n_Attack Vector by Company Size Q1 2021_\n\nDuring Q1, the cyber extortion economic supply chain demonstrated how a vulnerability in\nwidely used VPN appliances can be identified, exploited and monetized by ransomware\naffiliates. It is rare to see software vulnerabilities directly leveraged by affiliates of RaaS\ngroups, but when specialists broadly market the results of their elicit skills then the costs of\ncarrying out an attack decline and lower the barriers to entry for new cyber criminals.\n\nThe continued evolution and specialization of the ransomware supply chain is a worrisome\ntrend. Lower overall operating costs drop the barrier to entry AND boost the profitability of\nattacks. Until the [unit economics of ransomware attacks becomes less profitable, we should](https://www.coveware.com/blog/2020/10/14/state-and-local-cybersecurity-defending-our-communities-from-cyber-threats-amid-covid-19)\nexpect the volume of attacks to continue to increase. Even more worrisome is the maturity\nand progression of the supply chain within the cyber extortion economy. The infrastructure\nthat is being created to run this economy will be difficult to unwind. The more mature the\nsupply chain is allowed to become, the harder it will be to dismantle.\n\n## Most Industries Impacted by Ransomware in Q1 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Common Industries Targeted by Ransomware in Q1 2021_\n\nThe most notable change in industries impacted by ransomware attacks in Q1 was the\nProfessional Services industry, specifically law firms. Small and medium sized law firms\ncontinue to succumb to encryption ransomware and data exfiltration extortion attacks.\nUnfortunately, the economics of many small professional service firms do not encourage or\nenable adequate cyber security.\n\nFor example, many law firms are structured as limited partnerships for tax purposes. This\nmeans the firm pays out all its profit to the partners every year. The desire to maximize\nprofits and income to the partners can marginalize the priority of investing in cybersecurity.\nAnother example is the third party vendor relationships of a small law firm. These firms\ngenerally do not work with major enterprises that would perform rigorous cyber risk\nassessments, the most basic of which would immediately surface common vulnerabilities\nand weaknesses that may result in a future ransomware attack. Rather, small firms tend to\nhave equally sized clients that do not demand vendor assessments of cyber risk.\n\nAs a result of these two examples there is minimal internal or external market pressure to\nprioritize cyber security. The volume of professional service firms that are victimized is a\nresult of these micro dynamics.\n\n## Median Size of Ransomware Attack Victims in Q1 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Median Size of Companies Targeted by Ransomware_\n\nRansomware attacks still disproportionately affect small businesses. These small companies\nrarely end up in the headlines and often don’t have the financial or technical expertise to\nproperly handle the incident OR perform the proper remediation required to prevent a repeat\nattack. Small businesses that exist below the cyber security poverty line represent the\ngreatest challenge to stemming the expansion of the cyber extortion economy.\n\n\n-----\n\nDistribution by company size (employee count)\n\n## Incident Duration and Business Interruption of a Ransomware Attack\n\nAverage Days of Downtime\n\n23\n+10% from Q4 2020\n\nIncident duration expanded slightly in Q1 to an average of 23 days. Contributing factors to\nthis increase were the average length of time it takes to adjudicate data exfiltration incidents,\nand technical challenges from corrupted data (see above discussion on flaws in certain\nransomware causing data loss). Q1 also included multiple instances of deliberate disruption\nby the threat actor during the recovery period following the initial attack. Disruptions included\nattempts to steal additional data or re-launch the ransomware. Prior to Q1 such behavior was\na rare occurrence, but the tactic appears to be gaining traction amongst certain threat\ngroups. This behavior not only exacerbates business interruption, but delays negotiation\nprogress. This behavior also undermines the victim’s confidence that the threat actor will\nassist in a successful resolution. The threat actor’s expectation that re-attacking increases\nthe pressure to pay is misguided. Re-attacks make victims less inclined to facilitate any sort\nof payment.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Disclaimer\n\n_Coveware is not responsible for any actions taken, errors or omissions (negligent or_\n_otherwise), regardless of the cause, or for the results obtained from the use of this content,_\n_or for the performance of any computer, hardware or software used or modified in_\n_conjunction with this content.
