Iran has strategic](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/seedworm-apt-iran-middle-east)\ninterests in all of those countries. And the attackers appear to be trying to smuggle key data\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom the organizations they managed to breach.\n\nIt’s a reminder that while other hacking teams associated with Tehran have gained notoriety\n[for disruptive, data-wiping attacks against Middle East organizations, the group known as](https://www.cyberscoop.com/saudi-arabia-iran-cyberattack-soleimani/)\nMuddyWater, or Seedworm, is better known for its relentless spying efforts.\n\n“These actors are extremely focused in what they’re doing,” said Vikram Thakur, technical\ndirector at Symantec, a division of semiconductor and software maker Broadcom. “They’re\nnot using zero days. They’re just looking for commonly available methods along with their\ncustom malware to get into these environments, exfiltrate whatever they want and then move\non.”\n\n[Researchers from Symantec and other security companies are investigating a new hacking](https://www.cyberscoop.com/thrip-lotus-blossom-symantec-china/)\ntool they [suspect MuddyWater has been using in the compromises. Known as PowGoop, the](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/muddywater/)\nmalicious code can install other programs capable of siphoning data off of networks.\n\n“It could be a subgroup within [MuddyWater] which has been tasked differently” from the rest\nof the group, Thakur said of the PowGoop tool.\n\nWhile Symantec said it had “medium confidence” that MuddyWater was behind PowGoop,\nthere were other signs that the group has been developing new tools.\n\n“MuddyWater has been very active in the last year, both in its prolific operations and constant\ndevelopment of tools,” said Saher Naumaan, senior threat intelligence analyst at BAE\nSystems. “One significant evolution is the group’s advancements in malware, which over the\nyears has shifted away from solely scripting-based tooling, such as PowerShell, to .NET and\nnow to custom C++ payloads, as seen with Backdoor.Mori,” added Naumaan, who closely\ntracks hackers associated with Iran.\n\nMuddyWater’s recent activity is in keeping with its reputation for prolific hacking campaigns.\nFrom September to December 2018, for example, the group compromised 131 victims in 30\norganizations all over the map, from Russia to Saudi Arabia to North America, Symantec\n[said in previous research.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/middle-east-group-goes-hacking-spree-telecoms-embassies/)\n\nMuddyWater has so far avoided the extra scrutiny that comes from public U.S. indictments. It\n[was not among the alleged Iranian hackers who were indicted last month by U.S. grand](https://www.cyberscoop.com/iran-indictment-justice-department-aerospace/)\njuries. And while security companies continue to expose MuddyWater’s tools, the group\nshows no signs of letting up.\n\n\n-----",
