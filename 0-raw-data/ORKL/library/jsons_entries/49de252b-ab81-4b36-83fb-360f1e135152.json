We assess that the threat actor’s primary focus is espionage and relates to targets\n\n\n-----\n\nin Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam. We track this activity as Aoqin\nDragon’.\n\nThe threat actor has a history of using document lures with pornographic themes to infect\nusers and makes heavy use of USB shortcut techniques to spread the malware and infect\nadditional targets. Attacks attributable to Aoqin Dragon typically drop one of two backdoors,\nMongall and a modified version of the open source Heyoka project.\n\n## Threat Actor Infection Chain\n\nThroughout our analysis of Aoqin Dragon campaigns, we observed a clear evolution in their\ninfection chain and TTPs. We divide their infection strategy into three parts.\n\n1. Using a document exploit and tricking the user into opening a weaponized Word\n\ndocument to install a backdoor.\n2. Luring users into double-clicking a fake Anti-Virus to execute malware in the victim’s\n\nhost.\n3. Forging a fake removable device to lure users into opening the wrong folder and\n\ninstalling the malware successfully on their system.\n\n### Initial Access via Exploitation of Old and Unpatched Vulnerabilities\n\n[During 2012 to 2015, Aoqin Dragon relied heavily on CVE-2012-0158 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158) [CVE-2010-3333](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3333)\n[to compromise their targets. In 2014, FireEye published a blog detailing related activity using](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html)\nlure documents themed around the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to\nconduct their attacks. Although those vulnerabilities are very old and were patched before\nbeing deployed by Aoqin Dragon, this kind of RTF-handling vulnerability decoy was very\ncommon in that period.\n\nThere are three interesting points that we discovered from these decoy documents. First,\nmost decoy content is themed around targets who are interested in APAC political affairs.\nSecond, the actors made use of lure documents themed to pornographic topics to entice the\ntargets. Third, in many cases, the documents are not specific to one country but rather the\nentirety of Southeast Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPAC Themed Lure Document\n\nPornographic-themed Lure Document\n\n### Executables Masked With Fake Icons\n\nThe threat actor developed executable files masked with document file icons such as\nWindows folders and Anti-Virus vendor icons, acting as droppers to execute a backdoor and\nconnect to the C2 server. Although executable files with fake file icons have been in use by a\n\n\n-----\n\nvariety of actors, it remains an effective tool especially for APT targets. Combined with\n“interesting” email content and a catchy file name, users can be socially engineered into\nclicking on the file.\n\nExecutable dropper with different fake security product icons\nTypically, a script containing a rar command is embedded in the executable dropper with\ndifferent fake security product icons. Based on the script contained in the executable, we can\nidentify the main target type of document formats they were trying to find, such as Microsoft\nWord documents.\n```\nrar.exe a -apC -r -ed -tk -m5 -dh -tl -hpThis0nePiece -ta20180704\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ALLUSE~1\\DRM\\Media\\B9CC6F75.ldf C:\\*.doc C:\\*.DOCX\n\n```\nMoreover, the dropper employs a worm infection strategy using a removable device to carry\nthe malware into the target’s host and facilitate a breach into the secure network\nenvironment. We also found the same dropper deploying different backdoors including the\nMongall backdoor and a modified Heyoka backdoor.\n\n### Removable Device as an Initial Vector\n\nFrom 2018 to present, this actor has also been observed using a fake removable device as\nan initial infection vector. Over time, the actor upgraded the malware to protect it from being\ndetected and removed by security products.\n\nHere’s a summary of the attack chain of recent campaigns:\n\n1. A Removable Disk shortcut file is made which contains a specific path to initiate the\n\nmalware.\n2. When a user clicks the fake device, it will execute the “Evernote Tray Application” and\n\nuse DLL hijacking to load the malicious `encrashrep.dll loader as` `explorer.exe .`\n3. After executing the loader, it will check if it is in any attached removable devices.\n4. If the loader is not in the removable disk, it will copy all the modules under\n```\n   \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\EverNoteService\\\", which includes normal\n\n```\nfiles, the backdoor loader and an encrypted backdoor payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. The malware sets the auto start function with the value EverNoteTrayUService . When\n\nthe user restarts the computer, it will execute the “Evernote Tray Application” and use\nDLL hijacking to load the malicious loader.\n6. The loader will check the file path first and decrypt the payloads. There are two\n\npayloads in this attack chain: the first payload is the spreader, which copies all\nmalicious files to removable devices; the second one is an encrypted backdoor which\ninjects itself into rundll32’s memory.\n\nNewest infection chain flow\n\nUsing USB shortcut techniques to spread the malware and infect target victims\n\n\n-----\n\nUse a shortcut file to fake removable disc icon and change Evernote application name to\nRemovableDisc.exe\nThe spreader component will try to find the removable device in the victim’s environment.\nThis malware component will copy all the malicious modules to any removable device to\nspread the malware in the target’s network environment, excluding Drive A. The threat actor\nnames this component “upan”, which we observe in the malware’s PDB strings.\n```\nC:\\Users\\john\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\upan_dll_test\\Debug\\upan.pdb\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n```\nAoqin Dragon rely heavily on the DLL hijacking technique to compromise targets and run\ntheir malware of choice. This includes their newest malware loader, Mongall backdoor, and a\nmodified Heyoka backdoor.\n\n### DLL-test.dll Loader\n\nThe `DLL-test.dll loader is notable because it is used to initiate the infection chain. When`\na victim has been compromised, `DLL-test.dll will check that the host drive is not A and`\ntest whether the drive is removable media or not. After these checks are complete, the\nloader opens the Removable Disk folder to simulate normal behavior. It then copies all\nmodules from the removable drive to the “EverNoteService” folder. The loader will set up an\nauto start for “EverNoteTrayService” as a form of persistence following reboots.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decrypting the encrypted payload, `DLL-test.dll will execute` `rundll32.exe and`\nrun specific export functions. The loader injects the decrypted payload into memory and runs\nit persistently. The payload we found in this operation included a Mongall backdoor and a\nmodified Heyoka backdoor.\n\nWe found that the code injection logic is identical to that in the book WINDOWS黑客编程技术\n详解 (Windows Hacking Programming Techniques Explained), Chapter 4, Section 3, which\ndescribes how to use memory to directly execute a DLL file. We also found the same code\non GitHub. A debug string inside the DLL-test loader provides further evidence that this is the\nsource of the code in the malware.\n```\nC:\\users\\john\\desktop\\af\\dll_test_hj3\\dll_test\\memloaddll.cpp\nC:\\users\\john\\desktop\\af\\dll_test_hj3 -不过uac 不写注册表\\dll_test\\memloaddll.cpp\nC:\\users\\john\\desktop\\af\\dll_test - upan -单独 - 老黑的版本\\dll_test\\memloaddll.cpp\n\n```\nAs stated above, the debug strings inside `DLL-test.dll loader provide interesting`\ninformation about Aoqin Dragon TTPs. The loaders contain both debug strings and\nembedded PDB strings that give us further information of this loader’s features and which\nbackdoor will be decrypted. For instance, “DLL_test loader for Mongall”, “DLL_test loader for\nMongall but can’t bypass UAC and can’t add itself to registry”, “DLL-test loader for upan\ncomponent” and “DLL-test for DnsControl”, which is a modified Heyoka backdoor.\n```\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Owner\\桌面\\DLL_test\\Release\\DLL_test.pdb\nC:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\af\\DLL_test_hj3\\Debug\\DLL_test.pdb\nC:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\af\\DLL_test - upan -单独 - 老黑的版本\\Debug\\DLL_test.pdb\nC:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\af\\DLL_test - upan -单独 - 老黑的版本\\Release\\DLL_test.pdb\nC:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\af\\DLL_test_hj3 -不过UAC 不写注册表\\Debug\\DLL_test.pdb\nD:\\2018\\DnsControl\\DNS20180108\\DLL_test\\Release\\DLL_test.pdb\n\n### Mongall Backdoor\n\n```\n[Mongall is a small backdoor going back to 2013, first described in a report by ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Advanced-Persistent-Threats.pdf)\nAccording to the report, the threat actor was trying to target the Telecommunications\nDepartment and the Vietnamese government. More recently, Aoqin Dragon has been\nreported targeting Southeast Asia with an upgraded Mongall encryption protocol and\nThemida packer.\n\nMongall backdoor has four different mutexes and different notes in each backdoors – notes\nare shown in the IOC table. Based on the notes, we can estimate malware creation time,\nintended targets, Mongall backdoor versions and related C2 domain name.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor mutex and information collection\nThe actors name this backdoor `HJ-client.dll, and the backdoor name matches the PDB`\nstrings mentioned earlier. In addition, there are some notes containing “HJ” strings inside the\nbackdoor.\n\nAlthough Mongall is not particularly feature rich, it is still an effective backdoor. It can create a\nremote shell, upload files to the victim’s machine and download files to the attacker’s C2.\nMost important of all, this backdoor embedded three C2 servers for communication. Below is\nthe Mongall backdoor function description and command code.\n\n\n-----\n\nMongall backdoor function capability\nWe discovered that the Mongall backdoor’s network transmission logic could be found on the\nChinese Software Developer Network (CSDN). Compared to the old Mongall backdoor, the\nnew version upgrades the encryption mechanism. However, new versions of Mongall still use\nGET protocol to send the information back with RC4 to encrypt or base64 to encode the\nvictim machine’s information. There is another interesting finding when we analyze Mongall\nbackdoor: the encryption or encode logic is compared to the mutex of Mongall. Here is the\ntable of mutex and transform data logic.\n\n**Mutex** **Algorithm**\n\nFlag_Running Base64 (type 3)\n\nDownload_Flag Base64 (type 3)\n\nRunning_Flag Base64 (type 3)\n\nFlag_Runnimg_2810 Modify base64 (type 2)\n\nFlag_Running_2016 Modify base64 (type 2)\n\n\n-----\n\nFlag_Running_2014RC4 RC4+base64 (type 1)\n\nFaking a C2 server allowed us to capture Mongall beacon messages and develop a Python\ndecryption script to reveal each version of the message. Alongside this report, we are\n[publicly releasing the script here. Below shows the encrypted strings and description beacon](https://github.com/SentineLabs/aoqin_dragon)\ninformation.\n\nDecrypting the embedded beacon information\n\n### Modified Heyoka Backdoor\n\nWe also observed another backdoor used by this threat actor. This backdoor is totally\n[different from Mongall, as we found it is based on the Heyoka open source project. Heyoka is](http://heyoka.sourceforge.net/)\na proof-of-concept of an exfiltration tool which uses spoofed DNS requests to create a\nbidirectional tunnel. The threat actors modified and redesigned this tool to be a custom\nbackdoor using DLL injection technique to deploy it in the victim’s environment. Simplified\nChinese characters can be found in its debug log.\n\nLeft:the modified backdoor information; Right: the Heyoka source code\n\nDebug information with simplified Chinese characters\n\n\n-----\n\nThis backdoor was named `srvdll.dll by its developers. They not only expanded its`\nfunctionality but also added two hardcoded C2s. The backdoor checks if it is run as system\nservice or not, to make sure it has sufficient privileges and to keep itself persistent. The\nmodified Heyoka backdoor is much more powerful than Mongall. Although both have shell\nability, the modified Heyoka backdoor is generally closer to a complete backdoor product.\nThe commands available in the modified Heyoka backdoor are tabulated below.\n\n**Command code** **Description**\n\n0x5 open a shell\n\n0x51 get host drive information\n\n0x3 search file function\n\n0x4 input data in an exit file\n\n0x6 create a file\n\n0x7 create a process\n\n0x9 get all process information in this host\n\n0x10 kill process\n\n0x11 create a folder\n\n0x12 delete file or folder\n\nHardcoded command and control server in modified Heyoka backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nBackdoor with the DNS tunneling connection\n\n## Attribution\n\nThroughout the analysis of Aoqin Dragon operations, we came across several artifacts\nlinking the activity to a Chinese-speaking APT group as detailed in the following sections.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n[One of Mongall’s backdoors was observed by Unit42 in 2015. They claim the president of](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/evilgrab-delivered-by-watering-hole-attack-on-president-of-myanmars-website/)\nMyanmar’s website had been used in a watering hole attack on December 24, 2014. The\nattacker injected a JavaScript file with a malicious iframe to exploit the browsers of website\nvisitors. In addition, they were also aware that another malicious script had been injected into\nthe same website in November 2014, leveraging CVE-2014-6332 to download a trojan horse\nto the target’s host.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In 2013, there was a News talk about this group and the results of a police investigation.](http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/china-hackers-target-vietnamese-state-officials-offices-3059.html)\nPolice retrieved information from the C2 server and phishing mail server operators located in\nBeijing, China. The two primary backdoors used in this operation have overlapping C2\ninfrastructure, and most of the C2 servers can be attributed to Chinese-speaking users.\n\nTwo major backdoor C2s overlap\n\nC2 attributed to Chinese-speaking users\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targeting and Motives\n\nThe targeting of Aoqin Dragon closely aligns with the Chinese government’s political\ninterests. We primarily observed Aoqin Dragon targeting government, education, and\ntelecommunication organizations in Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\nConsidering this long-term effort and continuous targeted attacks for the past few years, we\nassess the threat actor’s motives are espionage-oriented.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAoqin Dragon is an active cyberespionage group that has been operating for nearly a\ndecade. We have observed the Aoqin Dragon group evolve TTPs several times in order to\nstay under the radar. We fully expect that Aoqin Dragon will continue conducting espionage\noperations. In addition, we assess it is likely they will also continue to advance their\ntradecraft, finding new methods of evading detection and stay longer in their target network.\nSentinelLabs continues to track this activity cluster to provide insight into their evolution.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA1** **Malware Family**\n\na96caf60c50e7c589fefc62d89c27e6ac60cdf2c
