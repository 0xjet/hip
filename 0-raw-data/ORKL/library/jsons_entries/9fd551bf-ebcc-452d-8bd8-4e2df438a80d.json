One is\nto send spear phishing emails with topics of interests to the targets – for example an\ninvitation to a meeting. Another is to set up websites that impersonate news organisations\nand convince targets to download “articles”.\n\nThe third method is to ensnare their victims through conversations. As the conversations\ncontinue, the “women” offer up a “video” – laden with malware to infect the target’s system.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a more modern twist, however, we found evidence of the group using voice changing\nsoftware to enhance their operation. Below we analayse their toolset, which also includes\ntools to perform reconnaissance of targets and bulk-deliver malware to them.\n\n**The Server**\nEarlier in 2020 we reviewed a server previously identified as serving malware in targeted\nattacks. Those behind the attacks had made a misconfiguration on the server which made\ntheir attack toolset publicly available.\n\nThe attack toolset included:\n\n[Malware used for espionage against political opponents](https://twitter.com/ccxsaber/status/1191916749630783489)\nTools to identify vulnerable routers;\nA voice changing application;\nCustom tooling to use compromised email accounts to send phishing emails; and\nPhishing code for webmail logins\n\n**Background**\n\nThe wider set of activity involved in the campaign we analyse below was previously\n[described by Chinese Anti-Virus companies 360 Antivirus and](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/anatomy-of-moonLight-attack-on-the-middle-east/) [Rising. Following on from](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lUtXwWjPVMHXfR6oLnXYhQ)\nother recent reporting, we refer to the attackers as APT-C-23.\n\n[Whilst there are a number of overlapping groups and members in the region, APT-C-23 are](https://www.securityweek.com/new-backdoors-used-hamas-linked-hackers-abuse-facebook-dropbox)\n[part of a larger group known as “Molerats” and are mostly located in Palestine. They have](https://otx.alienvault.com/adversary/Molerats)\n[been reported on by the cyber-security industry as far back as 2012. Generally Molerats](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes/blob/master/2012/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf)\ntarget [political parties in Palestine and the Israeli government – but they also occasionally](https://twitter.com/ClearskySec/status/984700415055925248)\ntarget [Western Governments.

There are a number of different families of malware but most start with a self\n[extracting rar archive. The archives execute](https://app.any.run/tasks/a30ef1f4-1172-4d9f-84f3-4ad9f49bb78a/) [MSHTA/VBScript Downloaders used to install](https://twitter.com/cyber__sloth/status/1196457499206897664)\n[the commodity H-Worm backdoor. The filenames and decoy documents are mostly themed](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/now-you-see-me-h-worm-by-houdini.html)\naround Palestinian politics. We have included a sample of them in the Appendix.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file اﺟﺘﻤﺎع ﻟﺠﻨﺔ اﻻﻧﺘﺨﺎﺑﺎت – إﻗﻠﯿﻢ اﻟﺸﻤﺎل .exe (Election Commission Meeting – Northern Territory\n.exe) at http://192.119.111[.]4/xx/dv\n**Phishing Toolset**\n\nAPT-C-23 are a medium-sophistication group of attackers. They generally rely upon social\nengineering to convince targets to install their malware.\n\n[They have previously been known to impersonate women and target victims on social media](https://www.idf.il/en/articles/hamas/hamas-uses-fake-facebook-profiles-to-target-israeli-soldiers/)\nto lure them into installing malware.\n\nAn [article from February 2020 describes how they convinced soldiers in the Israel Defence](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/url-israel-idf-hamas-fake-app-phones-photo-sharing-a9337856.html)\nForces to install malware. That included using pre-recorded messages in Hebrew saying\n“Yes” and “No” – presumably as their Hebrew skills were limited.\n\n_“Over the last few months militants, who run the Gaza Strip, have attempted to woo soldiers_\n_on social media platforms including Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram._\n\n_Using fake personas of attractive Israeli women, the militants behind the profiles claimed_\n_they were immigrants with hearing difficulties to explain why they could not speak on the_\n_phone, and why they were not fluent in Hebrew._\n\n\n-----\n\n_They also used Israeli slang in their communiques, doctored photos to prevent a reverse_\n_image search online and sent generic voice messages of women’s voices saying “yes” and_\n_“no” to further bolster credibility._\n\n_As soon as the apps were downloaded it gave Hamas complete control over the phone:_\n_including transferring files to the Hamas server, allowing access to the phone’s data, SMS_\n_messages, contacts, microphone and camera to remotely take pictures, Lt Col Conricus_\n_said.”_\n\nAs well as not speaking Hebrew, it’s likely the attackers faced another problem\nimpersonating women. A number of the people thought to be behind these attacks have\npreviously been identified. All are men.\n\nThat may help to explain what we found in the folder “/up/uploads” on the public server:\n\n**Figure 3: The**\n\n[public directory on the server 192.119.111[.]4](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/ip/192.119.111.4)\nThe file “88.zip” contains photos from the instagram account of a female model (we have\nblurred the photos):\n\n\n-----\n\n[The file “00.zip” contains the installation for Morph Vox Pro, a voice changing application,](https://screamingbee.com/)\nincluding a serial key and voices pack:\n\n**Figure 4: Voice Changing**\n\napplication MorphVox Pro\nThe Serial Key is assigned to an “Ahmed [redacted]”:\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the context of both previous APT-C-23 attacks and the other contents of the folder, we\nthink the most likely explanation for MorphVox being part of their toolset is that it was used to\nproduce audio messages in a female voice to encourage targets to install their malware.\n\nOther [analysts have reported on manipulated images being used to enable misinformation in](https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/Unknown/APT-C-37/26-08-19/APT-C-37%20analysis.md)\n[the wider Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. And there have been previous reports of fraudsters](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkyqvb/deepfake-audio-impersonating-ceo-fraud-attempt)\nusing DeepFake audio impersonations. But this is the first time we’re aware of evidence,\nalbeit indirect, of attackers using voice changing software to enable espionage.\n\n**Spearphish Delivery Tool**\n\nThe server also provides information on how the attackers deliver their malware. The file\n[recon.exe is used to bulk-send malicious phishing emails to targets:](http://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/9153b0060a6edc1180988ffd95ef9768caa84734d85da23c1b38d95319a2e240)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe application provides advice on how to send the emails, such as the maximum number of\nmessages that can be sent from each mail provider.\n\nThe source code for recon.exe shows that tracking images are also included in sent emails:\n\n**Router Exploitation**\n\nAnother folder, called “zz”, included another interesting mix of tools:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file ﻃﺮﯾﻘﺔ اﻟﺒﺤﺚ.txt or “Research Method.txt” contains example commands to find\n[vulnerable routers using the](https://routersecurity.org/bugs.php) [ZoomEye internet scanning service:](https://www.zoomeye.org/)\n\nThe file PingIPs.exe is part of an attack toolset that we’ve seen previously.
