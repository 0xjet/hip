    "plain_text": "# Iranian Hackers Using New Marlin Backdoor in 'Out to Sea' Espionage Campaign\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-using-new-marlin.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-using-new-marlin.html)**\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nAn advanced persistent threat (APT) group with ties to Iran has refreshed its malware toolset to\ninclude a new backdoor dubbed Marlin as part of a long-running espionage campaign that started\nin April 2018.\n\nSlovak cybersecurity company ESET attributed the attacks — codenamed \"Out to Sea\" — to a\n[threat actor called OilRig (aka APT34), while also conclusively connecting its activities to a second](https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/researchers-uncover-new-iranian-malware.html)\n[Iranian group tracked under the name Lyceum (Hexane aka SiameseKitten).](https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/irans-lyceum-hackers-target-telecoms.html)\n\n\"Victims of the campaign include diplomatic organizations, technology companies, and medical\norganizations in Israel, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates,\" ESET noted in its T3 2021 Threat\nReport shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\n-----\n\nActive since at least 2014, the hacking group is known to strike Middle Eastern governments and a\nvariety of business verticals, including chemical, energy, financial, and telecommunications. In April\n2021, the actor targeted a Lebanese entity with an implant called SideTwist, while campaigns\npreviously attributed to Lyceum have singled out IT companies in Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and\nSaudi Arabia.\n\nThe Lyceum infection chains are also notable for the fact that they have evolved to drop multiple\nbackdoors since the campaign came to light in 2018 — beginning with DanBot and transitioning to\nShark and Milan in 2021 — with attacks detected in August 2021 leveraging a new data collection\nmalware called Marlin.\n\nThe changes don't end there. In what's a significant departure from traditional OilRig TTPs, which\nhave involved the use of DNS and HTTPS for command-and-control (C&C) communications, Marlin\nmakes use of Microsoft's OneDrive API for its C2 operations.\n\nESET, noting that initial access to the network was achieved by means of spear-phishing as well as\nremote access and administration software like ITbrain and TeamViewer, cited similarities in tools\nand tactics between OilRig's backdoors and that of Lyceum as \"too numerous and specific.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"The ToneDeaf backdoor primarily communicated with its C&C over HTTP/S but included a\nsecondary method, DNS tunneling, which does not function properly,\" the researchers said. \"Shark\nhas similar symptoms, where its primary communication method uses DNS but has a nonfunctional HTTP/S secondary option.\"\n\n[ToneDeaf, which supports collecting system information, uploading and downloading of files, and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network)\narbitrary shell command execution, is a malware family that was deployed by the APT34 actor\ntargeting a broad range of industries operating in the Middle East in July 2019.\n\nAdditionally, the findings also pointed out the overlapping use of DNS as a C&C communication\nchannel, while also employing HTTP/S as a secondary communication method and the use of\nmultiple folders in a backdoor's working directory for uploading and downloading files from the C&C\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
