A hired actor is\nconsistent with our findings on the Command and Control servers related to this\ncampaign, which included web-based control panels for multiple RATs, suggesting that\nseveral campaigns were being run at once. A hired actor may also explain the generic and\nuninspired nature of the phishing, which often took the form of an email purporting to\ncontain an invoice or a legal document with an attachment containing a blurry image.\nAn investigation by the Swiss federal police of some of the emails linked to Operation\nManul concludes that they were sent from IP addresses in India, which also suggests a\nlink to Appin.\n\nHundreds of leaked emails published on the Kazaword website also suggest possible links\nbetween this campaign and Arcanum Global Intelligence, a private intelligence company\nwith headquarters in Zurich, which was allegedly hired by the government of Kazakhstan\nto perform a surveillance and data extraction operation against a high-profile dissident.\nIt was Respublika’s​ reporting on these connections which led the government of\nKazakhstan to request an injunction in a New York court to bar the website from\npublishing the “stolen” emails.\n\n1 We chose the name Operation Manul because Manul cat is native to the steppes of Kazakhstan, and that this\ncampaign seems to be targeting members of the Kazakhstan diaspora and their associates. We also like cats.\n2 https://kazaword.wordpress.com/\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 3\n\n\n-----\n\n## Operation Manul\n\nIn 2015, EFF’s clients in the ​Respublika litigation were the targets of several spearphishing3\n\nattempts they had received via email (Fig. 1). We analyzed these emails and discovered\nthat they contained malware, which appeared to be coming from a single actor as part of\nan ongoing targeted hacking campaign which we have named “Operation Manul.” Over\nthe last year Operation Manul has repeatedly targeted our clients in the ​Respublika case\n(Irina Petrushova and Alexander Petrushov), their known associates and family members,\nand other dissidents involved in litigation with the government of Kazakhstan in\nEuropeans courts, as well as their family members, associates, and attorneys.\n\nWe were also able to observe links between Operation Manul and a malware campaign\ntargeting the family of Mukhtar Ablyazov, co-founder of the Democratic Choice of\nKazakhstan, a party opposed to the ​authoritarian rule of Kazakhstan’s President\nNursultan Nazarbayev.​ ​Ablyazov is currently fighting extradition from France, where he\nlives in exile, to Nazarbayev-allied Russia. In May 2013, Ablyazov's wife, Alma\nShalabaeva, and 6-year-old daughter, Alua Ablyazova, were taken into custody by Italian\npolice and forcibly deported despite having legal British and European residence permits.\nWithin 72 hours, they were on a private jet hired by the Kazakh embassy, and taken to\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan’s capital. Ablyazov and his supporters have characterized this move\nas a “kidnapping” and “political hostage-taking” ordered by President Nazabayev.\nSpearphishing emails and malware sent to the family and their associates during this\nperiod may have been intended to help track Alma and Alua’s movements in preparation\nfor this incident.\n\n3 https://www.eff.org/cases/kazakhstan-v-does\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 4\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 1 A spearphishing email sent to Alexander Petrushov. The title of the document “Atabayev_\n_Invoice” may refer to Bolat Atabayev, a Khazakh dissident and theater director who was also_\n_targeted in this campaign._\n\nIn an appeal filed with a Swiss court earlier this year, members of Ablyazov’s family\nallege that they have been targeted by a campaign of spearphishing emails containing\nmalware going back to 2012. The campaign against Ablyazov’s family, attorneys, and\nassociates used the same malware as we found in Operation Manul, and sometimes used\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 5\n\n\n-----\n\nthe exact same emails as the emails sent to EFF’s ​Respublika clients and their associates,\non the same dates. Additionally, analysis by GovCERT of other spearphishing emails\nsent to Ablyazov’s family and associates in 2015 concludes that the malware uses the\nkaliex.net domain and covertly installs Bandook. For this reason we believe both groups\nare targets of Operation Manul.\n\n_Fig 2. The PDF document from the spearphishing email entices the victim to download a fake_\n_update to acrobat._\n\nOperation Manul appears to primarily use two different commercially available malware\nfamilies: JRat and Bandook.\n\n#### Victims of Operation Manul\n\nSome victims of Operation Manul have expressed a desire to preserve their anonymity,\nwhich we respect. The victims we are at liberty to identify include Alexander Petrushov\nand Irina Petroshova, publishers of the independent Kazakh newspaper, ​Respublika, Peter\nSahlas, a human rights attorney, several members of Mukhtar Ablyazov’s family, Astolfo\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 6\n\n\n-----\n\nDi Amato, an Italian attorney who spearheaded anti-corruption litigation involving\nallegations of corruption by Kazakhstan, and dissident theater director Bolat Atabayev.\nSeveral victims allege that they have been physically followed, had their homes broken\ninto, and been tracked using GPS devices. Mr. Di Amato alleges that his law firm’s\nwebsite has been the victim of several DDoS attacks, which he believes are linked to his\nlitigation involving the government of Kazakhstan.\n\n#### JRat Malware Family\n\nOne of the common malware samples used over the course of Operation Manul is known\nas JRat or Jacksbot. JRat is a commercially available remote access tool (RAT), written in\nJava. JRat is currently available for purchase at jrat[.]io for the price of $40 USD. JRat4\n\nhas been continuously developed for the last four years, seemingly by a single developer\nwho goes by the name “redp0ison”. While JRat itself is closed source, many modules and\nhelpful utilities are open source and are available on github. 5\n\n**JRat Functionality**\n\n_Fig 3. JRat Controller on Windows_\n\n4 Payable only in bitcoin.\n5 https://github.com/java-rat\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 7\n\n\n-----\n\nJRat is a cross platform RAT, able to target hosts running Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD,\nand even Solaris. The RAT is highly modular—it even has an open API so that the\nattacker may write custom modules to fit their needs. JRat modules include the following\nfunctionality: keylogging, reverse proxy, password recovery, turning on the host webcam,\ndisabling webcam indicator light, listing host processes, opening a shell on the host,\nediting the host registry, and even chatting with the remote host. JRat also provides a\ncontroller application, which is written in Java. This controller application allows the\nattacker to manage all of their JRat instances and view uptime, operating system, and\nother information about all infected hosts. JRat also provides a web version of the\ncontroller, which is open source.  6\n\n_Fig 4. JRat Controller viewing host screen_\n\n_Fig 5. JRat Controller screen for an infected host_\n\n6 https://github.com/java-rat/web\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 8\n\n\n-----\n\n**Anti-Analysis**\n\nJRat contains a number of interesting features to thwart analysis by a malware\nresearcher.\n\n_Fig. 6 An example of the ZKM obfuscated JRat code._\nThe code itself is obfuscated using Zendix Klass Master (ZKM), a commercially-available7\n\nJava obfuscator. ZKM obfuscates the code by giving it generic class, method, and variable\n\n7 http://www.zelix.com/klassmaster/featuresZKMScript.html\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 9\n\n\n-----\n\nnames, it also encodes the strings by xoring them with a series of random bytes, and\nincludes extraneous code-paths. All of this is done to make the java bytecode harder to\ndecompile and analyze for the reverse engineer.\n\nThe JRat JAR file contains an encrypted config file named ​config.dat. ​The JRat\nconfig file is encrypted using AES in CBC mode. The encryption key and IV are cleverly\nhidden in the “extra” field for the zipped config.dat file. As illustrated in the example\nbelow (Fig. 7), the extra field begins at offset ​0x30 ​of the file header for a given file in\nthe compressed JAR. Within the 32 byte ​extra ​field, the first 16 bytes are the AES\ndecryption key, and the last 16 bytes store the IV.\n\n_Fig. 7 An example file header in a compressed Zip or JAR file._\n\nOnce it is decrypted, we are able to extract the plaintext configuration information\nincluding the domain of the command and control server and port number (Fig 8). JRat\nalso employs anti-virtualization features to detect and shut down if it is being run in\nVirtualBox, VMware, or other virtualization software.\n\nJRat is low cost, versatile, extensible, and feature rich. Given these facts and the diversity\nof systems that JRAT can infect it is perhaps not surprising that the attackers chose this\nparticular RAT.\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 10\n\n\n-----\n\ndelayms=­1\naddresses=axroot.com:5006,\nhiddenfile=false\nicon=­1\nmutex=false\nerror=true\ntitle=\nrunnextboot=false\ntimeout=false\ndroppath=2\ntititle=jRAT\nmelt=false\ntoms=­1\nreconsec=10\nmport=­1\nperms=­1\nid=Name5006\nper=false\nos=win mac linux\npass=7110eda4d09e062aa5e4a390b0a572ac0d2c0220\ndebugmsg=true\nmessage=\ndelay=false\nti=true\nvm=false\ntimsgfail=Disconnected from controller\nname=japs\ntimsg=Connected to control controller\nwindow=false\n\n_Fig. 8 A decrypted JRat config file_\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 11\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Bandook Malware Family\n\nThe other malware family used in this campaign is the commercially available RAT\nknown as “Bandook.” Bandook has been available since roughly 2007. This sample seems\nto have been continuously developed and improved over the course of the last couple of\nyears. Unlike JRat, Bandook is only able to target Windows computers.\n\n**Core Functionality**\n\nAll Bandook executables are similar in size. Generally, they are masqueraded with fake\nFlash Player, Office document, or PDF document icons. None of the Bandook samples we\nhave found in this campaign have been configured so as to execute an actual decoy\ndocument.\nNormally, Bandook is distributed with an initial stub. This executable would contain\nanother PE32 binary as an embedded PE resource. Bandook makes use of a common\ntechnique referred to as \"process hollowing.\" It instantiates several suspended browser\nprocesses and then replaces the loaded executable memory with the code contained in\nthe embedded resource previously mentioned.\n\nAs an example for analysis, we take the original binary with hash\nb002e8b6406fbdf3de9bfcb3493e61c8a44b331f53125e8fed9daa351\nc49fd34 and, more importantly, the embedded resource named \"O9897DDD​ \" with​\nhash\nc447fd4d6e1deb794acde683bb2176becf353c6e1b2acdfced27c4413\n711f6f0. ​\n\nInterestingly, this binary was uploaded on malwr.com in early June 2016 with the file\nname \"Form13.exe\" (which might suggest a development version). Currently, the same\nbinary doesn't seem to be available in any other malware repository to which we have\naccess. In this case, the malware did not execute after having successfully identified a\nvirtualized environment, which might suggest the upload was potentially done by the\nauthors as an attempt to verify the evasion technique.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while normally the embedded resource is obfuscated in\nbinaries distributed in the wild, this specific case is the only one we identified with the\nresource embedded in the clear.\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 12\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network Indicators and Modularity**\n\nAfter some initialization, Bandook performs an initial beacon with the general\ninformation and configuration details it previously collected. Then it expects a command\nin response from the Command & Control server. If idle, the C&C will reply with\n\"@0000​ \", and the malware will keep beaconing back the title bar of the currently active​\nwindow, until it is instructed to do something else.\n\nInterestingly, the basic payload isn't provided with the code to perform any significant\naction. If instructed to do so, Bandook will download additional DLL files which provide\nthe specifically desired functionality. This is probably meant to limit the exposure of the\ncore modules to analysts, and to vet the infection before performing a full deployment.\n\nIn this case the available DLLs can have the names:\n\ncap.dll\nextra.dll\npws.dll\ntv.dll\nAmmyy.dll\n\nWe were able to obtain the first three DLLs, which were located at the URL\nhxxp://axroot.com/plg10/.\n\nThe following is a list of overall features available in this version of Bandook:\n\n - Screen capture\n\n - Webcam recording\n\n - Audio recording\n\n - File search, creation, deletion and exfiltration\n\n - Spawn a shell\n\n - Get list of available Wireless networks\n\n - Get list of MTP devices\n\n - Monitor USB devices\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 13\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n#### Observed Links to the Government of Kazakhstan\n\nGiven the common thread tying together the targets we find it likely that this campaign\nwas carried out by—or on the behalf of—the government of Kazakhstan, or forces allied\nwith the government. The majority of the targets of the malware campaign are currently\nembroiled in legal disputes with the government of Kazakhstan in European courts or are\nthe family members or associates of people involved in these disputes. The titles of\nspearphishing emails often indicate that the targets are being singled out specifically for\ntheir interest in matters pertaining to Kazakhstan, such as “Information KZ,” “Press\ndocument KZ,” and “Kazakh NEWS of importance - Vladimir.”\n\n#### Observed Links to Arcanum Global Intelligence\n\nLeaked emails published by Kazaword allege that the government of Kazakhstan had8\n\npreviously hired a private intelligence company known as Arcanum to perform a\nsurveillance and data extraction mission (codenamed “Raptor) targeting Mr. Ablyazov\nand his family. Among the services offered by Arcanum are “Full Spectrum Cyber\nOperations” which they describe using the following language:\n\nWhen the need exists, we overlay Full Spectrum Cyber Operations on these core\ncapabilities, our principals’ experience, and special technical activities. We do this\nin order to offer a potent resource to support cyber and information operations\nplanning and execution virtually anywhere in the world.\n\nWhen our government clients come under threat, Arcanum Global’s embedded\nspecialists and capabilities support them with a full suite of response options,\nincluding (in consonance with applicable laws and regulations) an array of\ncountermeasures as well as both in-kind and asymmetric responses.\n\nWe invite you to schedule a comprehensive and completely confidential\ndiscussion of your cyber concerns and objectives with our specialists. After\n\n8 The emails themselves were hosted on Megaupload and have since been taken down as a result of litigation\nby the government of Kazakhstan, but they have been reported on extensively. You can find an extended\ndiscussion of their contents here:\n[http://www.viktor-khrapunov.com/en/publications-en/mediapart/​.](http://www.viktor-khrapunov.com/en/publications-en/mediapart/)\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 14\n\n\n-----\n\nanalyzing closely your requirements and the physical and cyber environments in\nwhich you must operate, Arcanum Global’s holistic team of technical, operational\nand management specialists will recommend specific (and potentially sensitive)\nsolutions – and then stand beside you to implement them and assure you realize\nyour goals and achieve mission success.\n\nEmails published by Kazaword and analyzed by Mediapart allege that Arcanum\nemployed ​Bernard Squarcini, head of France’s domestic intelligence agency, the\nDirection centrale du renseignement intérieur (DCRI) from 2007 to 2012, to inform the\nKazakh authorities of the progress of the legal proceedings against Ablyazov and to lobby\ncertain figures in France. Squarcini confirmed to Mediapart that the government of\nKazakhstan is a client, but Arcanum spokeswoman Yael Hartmann denied that the\ncompany was responsible for the spearphishing attempts, insisting that the company has\ncomplied with Swiss law.\n\nThere is certainly some strong evidence consistent with there being a link between\nOperation Manul and the government of Kazakhstan and between the government of\nKazakhstan and Arcanum. However, we observe no direct links between Operation\nManul and Arcanum. The technical evidence discussed below, we believe points instead\nto an Indian company: Appin.\n\n#### Observed Links To Appin\n\nWe examined the behavior of the command and control domains used by Operation\nManul as they moved from IP to IP. Using Passive Total, we observed that the C2\ndomains from Operational Manul used a total of 76 IPs from 2008-07-20 to 2016-05-11.\nWe must consider that these domains could have been used by other actors over this time\nperiod.\n\nWhile considering attribution of the actors behind Operation Manul, we investigated the\npossibility of infrastructure overlap with known actors. Gathering data from existing\nAPT reports we automated gathering of historical data from known APT domains from9\n\nthe Passive Total API and comparison with the historical data from Operational Manul\ndomains.\n\nFrom this we were able to observe overlaps between Operation Manul and an actor\nknown as Appin. Appin is an Indian company that allegedly provides offensive\n\n9 [https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes​](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes)\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 15\n\n\n-----\n\ncyber-capability on a contract basis. A 2013 report by the cybersecurity firm Norman\nShark, titled “Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure”,10\n\ndescribes multiple campaigns linked to this actor. The campaigns included attacks on\nPunjabi separatists,Norwegian telecom Telenor, and multiple other companies.\n\nAppin is an exceptionally noisy actor, which might be expected given the contract nature\nof their work. Prior research revealed 607 domains related to Appin which we were able11\n\nto link via historical passive DNS to 1345 IPs. Of these, there were direct overlaps for\ntwo of the Operational Manul domains. There were indirect overlaps (same IP, at\ndifferent times) with 110 of the Operation Hangover domains and all but two of the\ndomains associated with Operation Manul.\n\nThe domains researchwork.org and dropboxonline.com were both on 64.202.189.170 on\n2011-01-14. Additionally, the domains adobeair.net and bikefanclub.info both resided on\n50.63.202.94 from 2014-04-24 to 2014-04-25. The researchwork.org and bikefanclub.org\ndomains were attributed to Appin in the Operation Hangover report, while adobeair.net\nand dropboxonline.com were observed during the investigation of Operation Manul.\nAdditionally there was a near overlap between abobeair[.]net (one of the Operation\nManul domains) and appinsecurity[.]com (attributed to Appin in the Operation\nHangover report) both hosted at 174.120.120.151 just five days apart in August of 2010.\n\nWhat’s more, according to an appeal filed in a Swiss court on behalf of the Ablyazov\nfamily, several of the malware samples sent to Mr. Ablyazov’s son-in-law and his attorney\nand linked with this campaign were variants of the HackBack Trojan. This Trojan is in\nthe same malware family as the Trojan found on an Angolan activist’s computer at the\nOslo Freedom Forum in 2013—which was also linked to Appin by researchers at ESET\nand Norman Security . We were unable to obtain the samples mentioned in the legal12\n\ndocuments at the time of this writing.\n\nA report written by the Swiss federal police, which investigated the origin of several of\nthe spearphishing emails sent to Ablyazov’s family and associates, concluded that the\nemails were sent from IP addresses in India.\n\n[10http://enterprise-manage.norman.c.bitbit.net/resources/files/Unveiling_an_Indian_Cyberattack_Infrastructu](http://enterprise-manage.norman.c.bitbit.net/resources/files/Unveiling_an_Indian_Cyberattack_Infrastructure.pdf)\n[re.pdf](http://enterprise-manage.norman.c.bitbit.net/resources/files/Unveiling_an_Indian_Cyberattack_Infrastructure.pdf)\n11http://ver007.com/tools/APTnotes/2013/Unveiling%20an%20Indian%20Cyberattack%20Infrastructure%20-%2\n0appendixes.pdf\n12http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/06/05/operation-hangover-more-links-to-the-oslo-freedom-forum-incid\nent/\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 16\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile there are links to Appin, it’s not conclusive that Operation Manul was carried out\nby this actor. Both 50.63.202.94 and 64.202.189.170 are very busy domains. Passive Total\ntells us that 50.63.202.94 has hosted 4535 unique domains since 2012, while 64.202.189.10\nhas hosted 4213 unique domains since 2009. Additionally, while the overlap with Appin\nexists, the fact that domains used the same IP at the same time is insufficient for concrete\nattribution. The evidence is consistent with links to Appin, but remains inconclusive.\nCertainly, the sort of targeting we have seen in Operation Manul appears to be\nconsistent with other efforts targeting activists that have been associated with the same\nactor.\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 17\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 9. An illustration of the shared network infrastructure between Operation Manul and_\n_Operation Hangover. Domains highlighted in red shared servers with Operation Manul domains_\n_at the same time._\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 18\n\n\n-----\n\n## Other Possible Targets\n\n_Fig 10. Uploaded password files from other victims_\n\nWhile investigating the C2 servers associated with Operation Manul, we discovered\nseveral open directories which contained files presumably related to other operations\nbeing run by this same actor (Fig 10). Additionally, we discovered web control panels for\nseveral different commodity RATs located under directories that appeared to be\ncode-names for different operations (Fig 11). We also discovered several files which were\npresumably uploaded from other victims’ computers (Fig 12). Lastly, we discovered\nencrypted data dumps from yet more campaigns, which we were unable at the time of\nthis report.\n\nWe found many related samples of the Bandook Trojan while we were doing our\nresearch. For example,\n\n65af112ce229ad888bf4bbba1e3dba701e0e68c9caf81543bb395a8b8192ba8e contains\nreferences to Al Qaeda/ISIS material and the forged document is from an Arabic\nlanguage pack. This sample however is associated with the same C2 servers used by\nOperation Manul.\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 19\n\n\n_Fig 10. Uploaded password files from other victims_\n\nWhile investigating the C2 servers associated with Operation Manul, we discovered\nseveral open directories which contained files presumably related to other operations\nbeing run by this same actor (Fig 10).

Unfortunately we were to find samples of this RAT at the time of this report. ​\n\nThe discoveries that we made while investigating the command and control\ninfrastructure associated with this campaign suggest that these attackers are “hired guns”\nand have multiple operations against different targets going on at the same time.\n\n_Fig 11. Web based RAT control panels found on Operation Manul C2 Servers_\n\n_Fig 12. Uploaded documents from the victim of another campaign found on Operation Manul C2_\n_servers._\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 20\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOperation Manul is not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that attacks\ndon’t need to be sophisticated in order to be effective. Not a single sample that we have\nfound in this campaign has employed a 0-day vulnerability. Unlike the lawful\ninterception software that companies such as FinFisher and Hacking Team sell to\ngovernments and law enforcement, the RATs employed in this campaign are not only\ncommercially-available to anyone, they’re cheap.\n\nThe fact that these attacks are not sophisticated should not discourage other researchers\nfrom doing similar work. For activists and journalists who are being surveilled by\nauthoritarian governments, surveillance is often just the first step in a campaign of\nintimidation, threats, and even direct violence. This kind of security research has the\npotential to have a real impact on vulnerable people. We suspect that the use of malware\nby governments to spy on political dissidents, especially exiles who live outside of their\ngovernment’s direct sphere of influence is increasingly common, which presents many\nopportunities for further research.\n\nThe possible connections between the government of Kazakhstan and companies that\nprovide “hackers for hire” suggest that the problem of governments using malware to spy\non political exiles and independent journalists goes beyond the sale of lawful\ninterception software. We hope that further research will help to shed light on this\npractice and the companies that make these services available.\n\nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION EFF.ORG 21\n\n\n-----\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThere are many people without whom this work would not have been possible.
