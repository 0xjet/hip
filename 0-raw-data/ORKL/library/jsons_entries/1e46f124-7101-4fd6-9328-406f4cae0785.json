Photograph: Barbara Walton/EPA\nThe NotPetya malware that wiped computers at organisations including Maersk, Merck and\nthe Ukrainian government in June “could count as a violation of sovereignty”, according to a\nlegal researcher at a Nato-affiliated cybersecurity organisation.\n\nIf the malware outbreak was state-sponsored, the researcher says, it could open the\npossiblity of “countermeasures”. Those could come through retaliatory cyber--attacks, or\nmore conventional means such as sanctions, but they must fall short of a military use of\nforce.\n\nTomáš Minárik, a researcher at the Nato Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in\nTallinn, Estonia, made the comments after the Centre concluded that the malware outbreak,\nwhich overwhelmingly hit Ukraine but also affected more than 60 other countries, can most\nlikely be attributed to a state actor.\n\nWhile a cyber-attack can trigger an armed response from Nato, Minárik cautioned that the\ndamage caused by NotPetya was not sufficient for such an escalation. The law of armed\nconflict applies only if a cyber-attack causes damage “with consequences comparable to an\narmed attack”, during an ongoing international armed conflict, “but so far there are reports of\nneither,” he said.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, Minárik, added, as important government systems have been targeted, then in\ncase the operation is attributed to a state this could count as a violation of sovereignty.\nConsequently, this could be an internationally wrongful act, which might give the targeted\nstates several options to respond with countermeasures.”\n\nA countermeasure is any state response which would be illegal in typical circumstances, but\ncan be authorised as a reaction to an internationally wrongful act by another state. A “hack\nback” response, for instance, could be a countermeasure, but Nato CCDCOE says that such\nresponses “do not necessarily have to be conducted by cyber means”; they cannot, however,\naffect third countries, nor can they amount to a use of force.\n\nThe suspicion that NotPetya – so called because the malware is superficially similar to an\nearlier ransomware variant called Petya – may be the work of a state sponsored actor arose\nshortly after the outbreak began in late June.\n\nWhile the malware appears to be ransomware (a type of program which holds critical files\nhostage in exchange for payment), it contained several flaws that prevented it from ever\nbeing an effective moneymaker for its creators. Among other things, the payment\ninfrastructure was tied to one email address outside their control, which was promptly\nblocked by the webmail provider, preventing victims form ever receiving their decryption key\nand unlocking their files.\n\nBut the malware, which was overwhelmingly seeded to victims through a compromised\nUkrainian accounting program, did function well as a “wiper”, designed simply to render\nsystems unusable and cause economic damage. It spread rapidly inside business networks,\nusing a combination of exploits stolen from the NSA and more common weaknesses in older\nversions of Windows, ensuring that whole organisations found themselves unable to operate\nfor days on end.\n\nUnlike WannaCry, an earlier piece of ransomware also suspected of being the work of statesponsored attackers (in that case, explicitly linked to North Korea by intelligence agencies\nincluding the NSA and GCHQ), NotPetya did not contain any functionality enabling it to\nspread unconstrained across the internet, limiting the vast majority of its damage to those\norganisations directly infected by the compromised accounting software.\n\n\n-----",
