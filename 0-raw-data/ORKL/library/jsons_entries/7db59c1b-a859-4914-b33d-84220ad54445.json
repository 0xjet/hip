Then press “Start Tool”.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.\n\nEncrypted:\n\nDecrypred:\n\n[If you encounter any issues, please contact us at forensics@bitdefender.com.](mailto:forensics@bitdefender.com)\nIf you checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted files. You\ncan also find a log describing decryption process, in %temp%\\BDRemovalTool folder:\n\nTo get rid of your left encrypted files, just search for files matching the extension and\nremove them bulk. We do not encourage you to do this, unless you doubled check your files can\nbe opened safely and there is no trace of damage.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware in some cases encrypts files incorrectly so that decryption will not work properly,\nwe recommend that you back up your files before using the decryption tool if you have not already\nchecked the option \"backup files \" from decryption tool.\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nThis product may include software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the\n[OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)](http://www.openssl.org/)\n\n\n-----",
