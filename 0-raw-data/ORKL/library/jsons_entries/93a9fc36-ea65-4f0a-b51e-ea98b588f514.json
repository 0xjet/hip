    "plain_text": "# A Look Inside the Highly Profitable Sodinokibi Ransomware Business\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-look-inside-the-highly-profitable-sodinokibi-ransomware-business/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-look-inside-the-highly-profitable-sodinokibi-ransomware-business/)**\n\nIonut Ilascu\n\nBy\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nAugust 30, 2019\n09:22 AM\n0\n\nRelatively new on the ransomware scene, Sodinokibi has already made impressive profits\nfor its administrators and affiliates, some victims paying as much as $240,000, while a\nnetwork infection netted $150,000 on average.\n\nThese figures are not surprising when you look at the malware's recent activity. On August\n16, [Sodinokibi hit 22 local administrations in Texas and demanded a collective ransom of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-want-25-million-ransom-for-texas-ransomware-attacks/)\n[$2.5 million. It compromised multiple MSPs (managed service providers) spreading the](http://managed%20service%20providers%20%28msps%29/)\nmalware to their customers.\n\nThe latest victim is another MSP that offers data backup service to dental practices. The\n[ransom in this case is allegedly $5,000 per client; hundreds were impacted.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-encrypts-records-of-hundreds-of-dental-practices/)\n\n## Setting the rules of the game\n\nSince its [discovery in April, Sodinokibi (a.k.a. REvil) has become prolific and quickly gained](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-being-installed-on-exploited-weblogic-servers/)\na reputation among cybercriminals in the ransomware business and security researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn mid-May, a Sodinokibi advertiser using the forum name UNKN deposited over $100,000\non underground forums to show that they meant serious business.\n\nAdvertisements for the new file-encrypting malware started in early July on at least two\nforums. UNKN said that they were looking to expand their activity and that it was a private\noperation with \"limited number of seats\" available for experienced individuals.\n\nA screenshot of the announcement, provided to BleepingComputer by malware researcher\n[Damian shows that UNKN describes the malware as being a \"private ransomware\" flexible](https://twitter.com/Damian1338)\nenough to adapt to the RaaS business model.\n\n**Post promoting REvil or Sodinokibi RaaS**\nUNKN offered affiliates 60% of the payments at the beginning and a 10% increase after the\nfirst three transactions. The actor also made it clear that they would not be working with\nEnglish-speaking affiliates as part of this private program.\n\n## Ransom payments flooding in\n\nThe name of the ransomware is not disclosed in the forum posts but the researcher told us\nthat he saw screenshots of the malware's administrative panel showing bot IDs that look the\nsame as those for Sodinokibi.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs seen in the screenshot below, one victim paid 27.7 bitcoins, which converted to more\nthan $220,000 at the time of the transaction.\n\nAnother capture from Damian makes it clear that this particular ransomware program is\nhighly profitable with some victims paying as little as .4 bitcoins (~$4,000) while others\nshelling out 26 bitcoins or approximately $240,000 at the moment of the conversion.\n\nFor those affiliates who can infect an entire network, the REvil/Sodinokibi developers allow\na victim to purchase a decryption tool for the entire fleet of affected computers. According to\nforum post shared with BleepingComputer, these network-wide decryptors have an average\ncost of $150,000.\n\n**Forum post about average network-wide decryptor costs**\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the revenue flooding in, other malware distributors are trying to gain access to the\nprogram, but UNKN has stated yesterday that there are no available openings for affiliates\nat this time.\n\n**RaaS is closed to new members**\n\n## Serious players in the game\n\nWhen they started advertising, the threat actor already had the support of respected\nmembers of the underground ransomware community.\n\n[Yelisey Boguslavskiy, director of security research at Advanced Intelligence (AdvIntel), told](https://www.advanced-intel.com/)\nBleepingComputer that UNKN registered an account on one cybercriminal forum on July 4\nand that it is clear that they had been active outside this community.\n\nTwo high-profile community members specializing in ransomware attacks endorsed UNKN\nand also revealed that they had joined the affiliate program, indicating that they already\nknew who they were dealing with.\n\nIn the image above, forum member Lalartu discloses that they started to work with\nSodinokibi after the GandCrab operation went belly up. They praise the new RaaS\ndisclosing the move had a significant effect on earnings, which \"not only grew, it broke\nthrough the ceiling and grows further.\"\n\nBoguslavskiy told us that positive feedback for a new ransomware strain is very uncommon\non that forum. The two members are typically very critical with newcomers.\n\n\n-----\n\n[For instance, when JSWorm and NEMTY were introduced, the community reacted with](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jsworm-20-ransomware-decryptor-gets-your-files-back-for-free/)\nextreme skepticism and aggression.\"\n\nA discussion thread on Sodinokibi started in June, with most forum members showing\nskepticism about the new ransomware and its legitimacy. The thread was deleted soon after\nUNKN presented the affiliation offer.\n\n## The GandCrab connection\n\nSodinokibi was spotted when researchers saw it deployed on Oracle WebLogic servers by\nexploiting a critical deserialization vulnerability. On the same systems infected with\nSodinokibi, cybercriminals also installed GandCrab a few hours later.\n\nAt the end of April, GandCrab administrators announced that they would close shop within\n20 days. And they kept their word.\n\nThe operators behind the Sodinokibi Ransomware started looking for affiliates to distribute\ntheir software soon after the GandCrab ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) shut\ndown. Underground reactions towards the new product suggest that there may be a\n[connection with the administrators or the affiliates of the now defunct GandCrab operation.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-shutting-down-after-claiming-to-earn-2-billion/)\n\n[Some malware analysts pointed to code-level similarities between the two ransomware](https://www.tesorion.nl/aconnection-between-the-sodinokibi-and-gandcrab-ransomware-families/)\nstrains, although plenty of differences exist between the two.\n\nHowever, one similarity is that administrators of both malware families would not carry\nbusiness in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) area. This includes Russia,\nUkraine, Moldova, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,\nand Uzbekistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese breadcrumbs along with the rapid ascension of the malware seem to suggest\ninvolvement from the GandCrab crew or its affiliates. Already having connections on private\nforums, it allowed them to quickly promote Sodinokibi and be selective about their partners.\n\nThere is no clear, undeniable evidence that Sodinokibi is run by the same individuals that\nadministered GandCrab, but they obviously know the ransomware game and are into the\nmoney-making business.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[GandCrab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gandcrab/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
