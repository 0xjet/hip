In this article, we share our insights from\ninvestigating the file and other infrastructure connected to it.\n\n## First Look\n\n[The file mentioned in the tweet is named ‘Briefing on Ongoing](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1490984172797984770)\n_Projects.docx’(eeeb99f94029fd366dcde7da2a75a849833c5f5932d8f1412a89ca15b9e9ebb7)_\n[and is available on VirusTotal and on our GitHub.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/eeeb99f94029fd366dcde7da2a75a849833c5f5932d8f1412a89ca15b9e9ebb7)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document itself contains little information and appears empty aside from the address\nblock. However, a deeper inspection of the document structure reveals that the document\nloads an RTF template from `https://dgmp-paknavy.mod-`\n\n`pk[.]com/14325/1/10/2/0/0/0/m/files-5291bef6/file.rtf` which we assume\nrepresents the next stage of the attack. At the time of our analysis, this file was not available\nunder the given URL anymore, yet the domain still resolved to `185.255.17.46 .`\n\nAfter unpacking the document structure, we could locate the suspicious URL under the path\n_s. It generally refers to relations and in this case aims to download a RTF template as shown_\nin the code snippet below:\n```\n# <Relationship\nId=\"fid990\"Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/o\npaknavy.mod-pk[.]com/14325/1/10/2/0/0/0/m/files5291bef6/file.rtf\"TargetMode=\"External\"/>\n\n```\nWith the URL being dead, we went back to VirusTotal to use the graph feature. It indicates\nthat file.rtf indeed was downloaded and provides the file’s hash,. Based on this, we continue\nour analysis by looking into file.rtf.\n\n\n-----\n\nVirusTotal contact graph of ‘\n\n## file.rtf(1)\n\n[Our next step was now to analyze the .rtf file with the hash available on VirusTotal and on](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1955c6914097477d5141f720c9e8fa44b4fe189e854da298d85090cbc338b35a)\nour [GitHub.](https://github.com/DCSO/Blog_CyTec/tree/main/404_file_still_found/rtf(1)_1955c6914097477d5141f720c9e8fa44b4fe189e854da298d85090cbc338b35a)\n\nUnfortunately, the content of the RTF file seems not to be malicious as it is only one line with\nless than ten characters. The complete content of the file is shown below:\n```\n{\\rtf1 }\n\n```\nThe file itself was first uploaded to VirusTotal on 2021–11–03 and had therefore already been\nonline for quite some time. Yet it appears to be some kind of placeholder file. Checking the\n[listed relations of this file on VirusTotal clearly shows its relation to the analyzed document:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1955c6914097477d5141f720c9e8fa44b4fe189e854da298d85090cbc338b35a/relations)\n\n\n-----\n\nRelation between the file.rtf and as malicious marked domains on VirusTotal\nAll domains listed in this screenshot above follow the same path pattern which can be\ndescribed as:\n\n_<…> /0/0/0/m/files-<hex_data>/file.rtf_\n\nFrom this information, we assume that the original malicious RTF file was replaced after the\ninitial delivery with a placeholder file. This file is small in size and not rich in content, yet it is\nunique enough to lead to related attacker domains on VirusTotal since it’s not a default file.\n\nReviewing all related domains on the list revealed that the domain `dgmp-paknavy.mod-`\n\n`pk[.]com has relations to another RTF file ()` [available on VirusTotal, which potentially could](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4e3c4ea383e6ed5c00672e08adabe24fc142cd05c86830a79c15c90412a2f588)\nhave been the file.rtf before replacement.\n\n## file.rtf(2)\n\nAs mentioned above, our next step aims to analyze another RTF file we will refer to as\n_[file.rtf(2) with the hash . The file is available on VirusTotal and on our](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4e3c4ea383e6ed5c00672e08adabe24fc142cd05c86830a79c15c90412a2f588)_ [GitHub.](https://github.com/DCSO/Blog_CyTec/tree/main/404_file_still_found/rtf(2)_4e3c4ea383e6ed5c00672e08adabe24fc142cd05c86830a79c15c90412a2f588)\n\nA first look at the file is promising, as the file size is 66.21 KB and was initially submitted to\nVirusTotal on 2022–02–08. The file is indeed a valid Rich Text Format file and contains the\nthree sections listed in the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RTF file contains three sections\n\nrtfobj reveals more information\nAs soon as we extracted the first object (1.a, ) we noticed, that the hash was mentioned by\n[another researcher as part of the malicious document on Twitter, reinforcing our assumption](https://twitter.com/ayaz2hussain/status/1491340118229385216)\nof this being the original file.rtf.\n\n\n-----\n\nBeside 1.a, the RTF file contains another embedded object which will be triggered via\n_\\objupdate when the document is loaded. This indicates the next execution step after_\n‘Briefing on Ongoing Projects.docx’ has reloaded the RTF file.\n\nRaw view on embedded object triggered via \\objupdate\nThe triggered code attempts to execute the embedded Equation Editor object which has\nknown vulnerabilities. The CVEs of these vulnerabilities are CVE-2017-11882(FONT), CVE[2018-0798(MATRIX) and CVE-2018-0802(FONT) as mentioned here and](https://www.anomali.com/blog/multiple-chinese-threat-groups-exploiting-cve-2018-0798-equation-editor-vulnerability-since-late-2018) [here.](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/conference_slides/2019/VB2019-SaadRaggi.pdf)\n\nThe CVE listed for file.rtf(2) on VirusTotal is CVE-2017–11882, which indicates code\nexecution based on unchecked font name input length.\n\nTo verify this claim, we have created a 010 Editor template to parse the embedded object\n[based on the protocol description of OLE objects and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-oleds/3c695db0-943f-48a0-b134-939af3b3a4ca) [MTEF objects.

The parser now allows us to follow the\nexecution flow further by extracting the initial exploit code contained in the FONT name\nsection of the object.\n\n\n-----\n\nParsed OLE/MTEF object with overflowing FONT name containing shellcode (red)\nAfter extracting and converting the shellcode via CyberChef, it becomes clear that the exploit\n[code abuses the FONT name field.

The deserialised object will be invoked by calling the\nfunction “work” with two slightly different URLs, which we assume are used for downloading\n\n\n-----\n\nthe next stage and error reporting.\n\nThe included URLs are listed below:\n```\nNext stage:https://dgmp-paknavy.modpk[.]com/14325/1/10/3/1/1/1865884360/uAiXa3upVnbI8GnagA2EgfGUnQxzUvVIEq4r3YTr/filesf3046d06/1/Error reporting:https://dgmp-paknavy.modpk[.]com/14325/1/10/3/3/0/1865884360/uAiXa3upVnbI8GnagA2EgfGUnQxzUvVIEq4r3YTr/files984c52a9/0/data?d=<AV_PRODUCTS_ON_HOST>\n\n```\nNext, we extracted the deserialised .NET object\n[(95f99d5da860ece23154ddef0bb289797dc2bd711034ce39c1ac85b9305919cb) and](https://github.com/DCSO/Blog_CyTec/blob/main/404_file_still_found/rtf(2)_4e3c4ea383e6ed5c00672e08adabe24fc142cd05c86830a79c15c90412a2f588/extracted/deobfuscated_1_a/extracted/95f99d5da860ece23154ddef0bb289797dc2bd711034ce39c1ac85b9305919cb_dot_net.bin)\ndecompiled it with ILSpy.

If “work” is called with a local file path, the script executes the contained\nWindows shell commands, embedding it into a WshShell JavaScript object which it executes\nvia mshta.exe. If “work” is called with a URL, as seen in our sample, a file containing\nassembly commands will be downloaded. It is then decrypted with a 32 bit key prepended to\nthe specific file and executed. Notably, there’s also error reporting capabilities. The program\nreports exceptions at different positions throughout the execution of the program by\nappending an exception message to the URL before calling them.\n\n[During our analysis and validation, we found related work analyzing similar malicious](https://ebryx.com/exposing-sidewinders-arsenal-against-windows-2/)\ndocuments which correspond to our sample. The article dissects the samples by explaining it\nin depth and validates the attribution claim made in the initial tweet of our article. Based on\nthe structure and used vulnerability this file seems to be related to the Royal Road v3\n[framework as mentioned here.](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-attribution-object-using-rtf-object-dimensions-track-apt-phishing-weaponizers/)\n\nAt this point, there were no clear indicators or hashes of the next execution stage, and we\ntherefore stopped following the execution path further.\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nHere, we summarize the execution flow of the file. The malicious document will be opened\nby the victim and a RTF template file is then loaded. This RTF file contains the remote code\nexecution exploit CVE-2017–11882 which abuses a FONT name vulnerability in the Equation\nEditor triggered via an embedded Equation Editor object. The exploit executes a JavaScript\nfile, previously written to disk through the RTF template, which then executes .NET code.\nThis file downloads another stage which is no longer available online. The ability to execute\nan already existing local file is implemented in the code, but not used in this process flow.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious execution flow of the document\n\n## Placeholder files\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned before, the nearly empty file.rtf(1) we initially found wasn t very useful in terms\nof content. We assume that the original file on the server was removed to protect the\nfollowing stage by replacing it with a placeholder file. Yet, because the file is custom, it can\nbe utilized as identifier and establish a relationship between the attacks. In this case, we are\nable to link eight domains as shown below.\n\nVirusTotal indicates communication between maldocs and the placeholder file\nBased on the given relation on VirusTotal, the URLs of these eight domains all exhibit the\nsame path pattern ( <…> /0/0/0/m/files-<hex_data>/file.rtf) which supports the assumption of\na possible connection between them.
