Although all\navailable evidence indicates the attack likely failed in its overall execution, the incident stands out as the first attempted\ncyber event that contained the possibility for direct harm or loss of life. While gathering headlines for some months after\nthe incident was publicly revealed in late 2017, further reporting on the actor responsible – referred to as XENOTIME –\nappeared to dry up, leaving many unanswered questions.\n\nMatters changed in 2022 with a combination of some very broad industry reporting and the public release of a US\nDepartment of Justice indictment from 2021 identifying a specific persona behind the Triton incident. While adding some\ncontext around the group, many questions remain unanswered, not the least of which being what this entity (or its\ncomponent organizations) has been up to since 2017.\n\nThis presentation will delve deeper into the specific entity (or perhaps more plausibly, entities?) responsible for the 2017\nevent, and the implications of this association. While earlier reporting identified a specific research institution as linked to\nthe 2017 incident, an observation seemingly reinforced by the indictment, further analysis reveals that this entity likely\nserved primarily tool development, testing and research functions, leaving the actual perpetrators unidentified beyond\nloose country association. By exploring technical, targeting and geopolitical factors surrounding the events in Saudi\nArabia, as well as discussing additional activity linked to this actor between 2018 and 2022, we will gain greater\nunderstanding of just who XENOTIME might be and its implications for overall critical infrastructure cyber operations\nsince the Triton event.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nIn 2017, a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia experienced multiple, unexpected, and (initially) unexplained shutdowns\n\n[1]. Taking place in June and again in August 2017, multiple Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), also referred to as\nEmergency Shutdown Devices (ESD), inexplicably tripped, inducing disruption in the industrial environment [2].\nSubsequent investigation of the August incident revealed several interesting artifacts residing on a safety system\nworkstation, most notably a framework for surreptitiously interacting with Schneider Electric Triconex SIS devices –\nultimately given the name Triton [3].\n\nAlso referred to as TRISIS and HatMan, [4, 5] analysis indicated Triton was designed to enable an attacker to arbitrarily\n– and silently – modify a Triconex SIS, enabling potentially catastrophic, and even deadly, outcomes. Yet initial reporting\nprovided little, if any, detail as to what entity was responsible for the incident in question. Further research (as well as\nactions from the US government) linked Triton to a research institute in Russia, the State Research Center of the Russian\nFederation Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) [6, 7].\n\nAlthough undeniably linked to events in 2017, TsNIIKhM is an odd organization to engage in operations described by\nsome as ‘malware that can kill’ [8]. More significantly, aside from limited leaks and government actions, in five years no\nfurther substantial events have specifically been identified and irrefutably linked to the adversary responsible for Triton,\nreferred to in commercial reporting as XENOTIME [9]. In this paper we will review the 2017 Triton incident, discuss\nfollow-on operations associated with the group responsible, and then explore what ‘XENOTIME’ plausibly means.\nThrough this examination, we will study the differentiation between developers and actors in cyber operations, and what\nthis means for incidents where visibility is limited, and multiple parties are likely at play.\n\n**THE TRITON INCIDENT**\n\nBased on multiple public disclosures, the Triton incident targeted the Petro Rabigh joint venture petrochemical facility in\nSaudi Arabia [1]. Interestingly, the plant disruptions took place several times, resulting in facility shutdowns – but not\nsomething more catastrophic given that SIS devices were the attacker’s final targets. Based on the capability deployed (a\nmulti-part framework to quietly and arbitrarily modify safety logic in industrial environments) and the effects achieved\n(plant shutdown), a disconnect seems to exist as the latter effect could be more easily attained via other, more direct\nmeans.\n\nAs analysed previously [10], Triton likely represents an ambitious attempt to create a cyber-physical impact that\nultimately failed for reasons still not completely understood. Based upon public analysis and disclosure, XENOTIME\nthoroughly compromised the victim environment, from initial IT breach and lateral movement [11], through entry into\nthe Distributed Control System (DCS) network and finally the safety network [1, 2]. Mechanisms used to facilitate this\nvary, from custom-developed tooling unique to XENOTIME to variations of several public frameworks to achieve\npersistence [11].\n\nIrrespective of specific methodology, the intrusion appears focused on ultimately modifying environment safety logic to\nenable a physically destructive event, given the focus on safety controllers. While arbitrary modifications to the plant’s\nDCS environment could prove disruptive, safety- and engineering-based mitigations, illustrated in Figure 1, can mitigate or\neliminate worst-case scenarios for physical process impacts and destruction.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Safety and engineering controls in industrial environments._\n\nAn adversary that desires an effective physical impact would need to eliminate or otherwise disable SIS and related systems\nfor a DCS modification to propagate to the physical environment and cause an impact. Reviewing the Triton incident\nconsidering these details, the most likely scenario pursued by XENOTIME was a dual-track intrusion: compromise and\nmodification of facility SIS, to allow for subsequent modifications or disruptions in the plant’s DCS to propagate through\nthe safety layer to induce a physical impact. While engineering controls still exist beyond SIS devices, these nonetheless\nresult in potentially dangerous outcomes such as emergency venting of product or triggering relief mechanisms.\n\nOverall, Triton represents only a part of a broader, ambitious sequence of actions to produce a cyber-physical impact\nscenario. Outlined in Figure 2, XENOTIME planned and executed multiple actions across several distinct network\nsegments before reaching a point where Triton itself could be deployed.\n\n_Figure 2: Triton attack stages and actions._\n\nAnd yet, for all this complexity, the intrusion arguably failed in achieving the likely objective as described above. Rather\nthan allowing XENOTIME to modify logic on the Triconex devices, Triton instead caused these devices to trigger a plant\nshutdown. While disruptive (and expensive), this scenario pales in comparison to the much more frightening possibility of\nan incident resulting in facility damage or even potential injury or death to on-site personnel.\n\nWhile the precise reasons for Triton’s failure are unknown, public analysis indicates a potential mismatch between the\n_Triconex hardware and firmware combination used in the victim facility and the platform against which Triton was built_\n\n[12]. Another, more likely explanation is a post-exploitation action immediately after Triton execution that triggered the\ncontroller crash [12, 13], although analysis from Mandiant and others failed to identify such a payload during post-incident\ninvestigation. Irrespective of why Triton largely failed, the framework triggered an immediate disruption of plant operations\ninstead of the more nefarious action of enabling arbitrary modification to safety logic and other SIS functionality to induce\na cyber-physical impact scenario.\n\nWe therefore see something of a paradox: an adversary patient enough to conduct a prolonged, multi-stage intrusion,\ncapable of developing and deploying a malware framework with very specific (and alarming) functionality, but somehow\nincapable of correctly developing or executing this capability for the victim environment. XENOTIME presents itself as a\nconundrum – one that we will now analyse in greater detail.\n\n**IDENTIFYING AN ENTITY**\n\nApproximately one year after the public disclosure of Triton, researchers from Mandiant identified and detailed links\nbetween the intrusion and Russia-based TsNIIKhM. Specifically, several enabling tools identified in the victim environment\nwere observed in an unspecified malware testing environment linked to a persona Mandiant linked to TsNIIKhM based on\nopen-source research [6]. Additional observations, such as file metadata, correlating time of activity to standard working\nhours in Russia, and a possible username identified in observations potentially linked to a likely TsNIIKhM employee,\n\n\n-----\n\nsuggested at minimum links to a Russian entity. Overall, while a case could be made linking Triton (and potentially\nXENOTIME) to TsNIIKhM, initial evidence (where presented) appeared largely circumstantial and incomplete at this time.\n\nMatters changed significantly in 2020, when the US Department of the Treasury’s (USDT) Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC) sanctioned TsNIIKhM, specifically for its involvement in enabling the Triton event [7]. While adding the weight of\ngovernment confirmation to Mandiant’s prior analysis, the press release detailing sanctions noted responsibility ‘for building\ncustomized tools that enabled [the Triton] attack’. A savvy reader will notice the Treasury statement does not assign\nresponsibility for building Triton, or for using the malware in the victim environment, to TsNIIKhM. Instead, the USDT\nOFAC statement appears to mirror Mandiant’s findings, linking TsNIIKhM to enabling tools used during the Triton incident.\n\nFurther details emerged in March 2022, when a 2021 indictment from the US Department of Justice (DOJ), United States v.\n_Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh, was publicly disclosed [14]. This indictment specifically identified a TsNIIKhM employee,_\nGladkikh, and unidentified co-conspirators as responsible for the actual operations leading to the deployment of Triton (as\nwell as actions against an unspecified oil and gas entity in the United States, discussed in greater detail below). Again,\nresponsibility for Triton’s development is left unsaid. At this stage, TsNIIKhM’s association with Triton and subsequent\nactivities tracked as XENOTIME is well established, but specific details regarding event execution and responsibility\nremain fuzzy.\n\nLooking at the institute in question more closely, TsNIIKhM was founded in 1894 initially for development and\nmanufacture of smokeless powder for the Russian empire [15]. Since that time, the institute has diversified operations into\na variety of fields while remaining linked to Russia’s Ministry of Defence (MOD). As noted by both Mandiant and DOJ\nreporting, identified individuals linked to Triton are connected to a specific entity housed within TsNIIKhM: the Applied\nDevelopment Center (ADC). ADC’s (now offline) website notes roles in critical infrastructure protection including\nreferences to potential cyber operations [16], with DOJ emphasizing concurrent, non-public roles in offensive tool research\nand development [14]. Overall, TsNIIKhM’s operations remain oriented toward supporting Russian security, military, and\nrelated interests, with ADC appearing to be a particularly sensitive entity within the organization.\n\nTsNIIKhM presents itself as a logical entity to research, develop, and create a tool such as Triton given the organization’s\nmission as a research institution and its history supporting Russian military endeavours. Operationally, one may look at the\nentity as similar to government-funded laboratories with strong military or intelligence connections elsewhere. Yet where\nmatters become confusing are the distinctions between tool development, tool prepositioning, and final tool deployment.\nWhile TsNIIKhM appears a reasonable entity to satisfy the initial stages, having a research institute (even if under Russian\nMOD sponsorship) actually undertake the infiltration of Petro Rabigh (and other organizations) appears very odd. At first\nglance, DOJ’s indictment appears only to blame TsNIIKhM (and ADC) for deploying Triton (via Gladkikh), leaving\ndevelopment (presumably a function aligned with ADC’s mission) unmentioned and unattributed.\n\nYet specific language in the DOJ indictment leaves some room for interpretation: ‘Gladkikh and co-conspirators known and\nunknown to the Grand Jury, including TsNIIKhM and members of TsNIIKhM and ADC.’ [17]. While Gladkikh,\nspecifically called out as an employee of TsNIIKhM working in ADC, is directly identified, other involved parties remain\nunnamed – not an unprecedented action, but odd for a specific ‘name-and-shame’ action from the US government. The\nimplication here is that entities aside from Gladkikh are involved, and while operational matters may link directly to\nGladkikh, developmental efforts could reside with other, unnamed parties that reside within the same organizations.\n\nFurthermore, DOJ’s 2021 indictment uses the word ‘including’, leaving open the possibility that other entities or\norganizations beyond TsNIIKhM were involved in the Triton event and subsequent activities. Several possibilities emerge\nhere, from the Russian MOD (through various intelligence entities under Russian military intelligence, also referred to as\nthe GRU) participating in operations to other, non-military but state intelligence-linked bodies contributing to intrusions (or\ndelivering operational tasking to TsNIIKhM and ADC).\n\nAdding detail to XENOTIME’s involvement, the DOJ indictment presents a timeline of actions linked to Gladkikh and his\nco-conspirators that also is intriguing. Actions specifically attributed to the individual include:\n\n - Initial access to the Triton victim’s IT network.\n\n - Research and exfiltration of data related to Triconex SIS operations in the victim environment.\n\n - Deploying and executing the custom version of CryptCat initially flagged by Mandiant as a link to TsNIIKhM.\n\n - Pivoting into the operational technology (OT) network at Petro Rabigh via a dual-homed data historian, then migrating\nfrom this system to an engineering workstation connected to the victim’s safety network.\n\n - Two specific attempts (02 June and 04 August 2017) to install variants of Triton on Triconex devices, resulting in faults\nthen system shutdowns.\n\nNotably absent from the above list of actions are the development and testing of Triton itself. While Gladkikh appears to be\nthe primary entity responsible for the Triton intrusion, the actual development of the ‘malware that can kill’ is linked to\nsome other, unidentified entity. Before examining this mystery, a review of subsequent operations linked to XENOTIME\n– and by association, TsNIIKhM – is in order.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OPERATIONS SINCE 2017**\n\nSince the Triton event, the entity at minimum linked to, if not responsible for, the incident – referred to as XENOTIME by\n_Dragos, but also referred to as Temp.Veles by FireEye and Mandiant – has remained active. Four particular phases of_\nXENOTIME operation stand out given their focus and potential intention.\n\nFirst, shortly after the Triton event and as documented by DOJ, XENOTIME (and Gladkikh specifically) engaged in initial\nreconnaissance and access activity against a US-based oil and gas company [17]. Although resulting in no identified\ndisruption, or recognized attempt at a physically destructive event such as in the Triton incident, DOJ reporting indicates\nsignificant, focused interest in critical aspects of US oil and gas infrastructure. Based on available information, at minimum\nGladkikh, and overall XENOTIME activity, sought to preposition within US critical infrastructure in the oil and gas sector.\nWhile there are many potential reasons for doing so, such actions would be necessary precursors for enabling a future\nTriton-like scenario within the victim systems.\n\nIn parallel with the above, researchers at Mandiant revealed a second intrusion linked to XENOTIME. Reported in 2019, it\nis unclear when the intrusion took place, let alone the victim or even the industry in which the victim operates [11].\nHowever, Mandiant reporting suggested that XENOTIME-linked activity continued overall tradecraft tendencies revealed\nin the Triton incident (likely the work of Gladkikh), while adding additional capabilities and tools. Based on ‘multiple\nTriton-related incident responses carried out by FireEye Mandiant’, the group continued its use of customized publicly\navailable tools (e.g. PLINK and CryptCat). One example, linked to XENOTIME operations through several commercial\nmalware repositories, was the malicious use of Net Square’s Netexec utility [18]. This software, which appears to no longer\nbe supported, is a remote command execution tool functionally similar to the Microsoft Sysinternals PsExec utility. The\npublicly available binary essentially allows for remote access tool functionality in also implementing file transfer\nmechanisms along with process manipulation. XENOTIME appears to strongly favour the use of such tools for initial\naccess and lateral movement activity, potentially to allow XENOTIME to ‘blend in’ with benign actions, or to obfuscate\nattribution efforts.\n\nFollowing the Triton incident and the two items detailed above in this section, XENOTIME appeared to take an interesting\nturn from oil and gas targeting to researching electric utilities. Based on reporting from Dragos released in 2019,\nXENOTIME initiated reconnaissance and target development operations against US-based electric utilities no later than\nlate-2018 [19, 20]. As noted in reporting and press interviews, none of the observed activity extended to active process\ndisruption or physical destruction. But, given the nature of the Triton event, such intrusions are deeply concerning as they\nagain represent the necessary preliminaries for such an act.\n\nThe trend of ‘probing, but not exploiting’ appeared to continue when comments from Dragos in 2022 indicated continued\nXENOTIME-linked operations against liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, likely in the US [21]. Although emphasized as\ninitial access and survey operations, the identified activity would represent continued interest by XENOTIME in US critical\ninfrastructure operations, while also aligning with efforts to research but not (immediately) disrupt targeted networks.\n\nOverall, as shown in the timeline in Figure 3, XENOTIME has remained active since the Triton incident in 2017. While the\nnature of these actions largely aligned with preparatory or preliminary operations, the group’s history makes these items\ncauses for concern. Having previously deployed a capability likely designed to remove process safety from industrial\nenvironments, even consequence-free efforts such as ‘research’ and ‘access development’ carry significant risk as initial\nsteps towards future, far more concerning actions.\n\nFrustratingly, the specific motivations behind the Triton event are unknown, which limits our ability to understand just what\nXENOTIME is tasked with achieving. As a Russian-linked incident targeting an entity in Saudi Arabia, the Triton event is\nespecially confusing considering geopolitical matters. During the Triton incidents and subsequent investigation in 2017,\nRussia and Saudi Arabia engaged in significant diplomatic discussion leading to a variety of agreements and a state visit by\nSaudi royalty in October 2017 [22]. While such agreements frayed not long after [23], a state-sanctioned destructive attack\nagainst Saudi oil infrastructure during a period of intense diplomatic discussion seems incredibly odd – one reason why\nsome researchers were prompted initially to link the framework to Iran [24]. Alternatively, the intrusion may have desired a\npre-positioned capability to hold Saudi infrastructure at risk should such discussions fail. While making for interesting\ndiscussion, no actual evidence exists to confirm such a scenario, leaving us with little to pursue this possibility.\n\nGiven multiple public and private parties linking the event to Russia, we can be reasonably confident in associating\nXENOTIME to Russian entities, although based on targeting and other factors during the Triton event, links to overall\nRussian policy and strategic interests appear strange. Nonetheless, XENOTIME sought a physically disruptive event that\ncould result not only in physical damage, but also direct harm to personnel onsite. Geopolitical motivations may remain\nconfusing in this event, given a lack of tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia compared to other areas such as Ukraine\nthat have been the victims of Russian cyber aggression, but the implications are indisputable for potential impact scenarios.\n\nBy expanding its targeting post-2017 to the US, XENOTIME shows a continued willingness (if not yet ability) to cause\nhavoc and potentially even direct harm. Considering these observations, a review of XENOTIME and its relationship to\nbroader Russian-linked hacking entities is helpful to determine just who this group may be, and how TsNIIKhM may (or\nmay not) fit in with the rest of Russian-directed offensive cyber operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Timeline of XENOTIME-linked actions._\n\n**ORGANIZATIONS AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND**\n\nTsNIIKhM represents the ‘prime mover’ for Triton actions, based on analysis and reporting from multiple entities – but not\nthe only entity involved given the lack of specificity concerning development of Triton itself. Post-2017 activity becomes\nmurkier still, with primarily private entities – most notably Mandiant and Dragos – publicly identifying continuity from the\nTriton incident to follow-on actions under the XENOTIME banner, especially against US-based critical infrastructure\nentities. The very specific identification of Gladkikh and detailed accounting of specific actions taken by him (and\nunknown co-conspirators) emphasizes an operational role for TsNIIKhM and its ADC component including in non-Triton\nevents [17], yet silence from other parties on TsNIIKhM’s role in actions post-2017, despite significant warnings (and\npublic identification of cyber operations groups) surrounding Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, stands out [25].\n\nFor context, TsNIIKhM is a research institution that resides (indirectly) under Russia’s MOD, via the Federal Service for\nTechnical and Export Control of Russia [26, 27]. As such, it would appear logical for activities linked to TsNIIKhM to\nassociate with other Russian military elements such as the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Main Center for Special\nTechnologies, Field Post number 74455 – also popularly known as ‘Sandworm’ [28, 29]. Sandworm is linked to multiple\ndisruptive operations, ranging from the NotPetya wiper event to the three electric disruptive incidents in Ukraine [25, 30,\n31]. Given the group’s track record, it would appear a natural ‘fit’ for an attempted destructive operation in a petrochemical\nfacility – yet through multiple statements and actions condemning Sandworm, no entity has ever linked TsNIIKhM (or\nXENOTIME activity) to Sandworm.\n\nRussia’s MOD maintains an entire ecosystem of research institutes and related entities involved in various endeavours, and\nnone of these appear directly linked to supporting active operations such as those attributed by various parties to TsNIIKhM\nand ADC [32]. TsNIIKhM appears to exist as just one of many organizations supporting various MOD operations and\nresearch endeavours – but one notably linked to an attempted destructive cyber attack. Moreover, TsNIIKhM engaged in\nprecisely the operations one would associate with a military or espionage actor – initial access and capability execution,\nsuch as in Triton or the 2017-2018 US oil and gas entity incident – while remaining unlinked in any detailed analysis from\nwhere one would expect such an organization to be involved, in developing a capability such as Triton.\n\nFurthermore, Russia’s MOD does not retain absolute control over the output of military- or defence-focused labs, nor are\nthey the only sponsor for such activity. As revealed in additional USDT sanctions, other facilities such as the Foreign\nIntelligence Service (SVR)-linked Federal State Autonomous Scientific Establishment Scientific Research Institute\nSpecialized Security Computing Devices and Automation entity (SVA), and the public-private research entity ERA\nTechnopolis also provide critical support in cyber effects capability development to multiple Russian government entities\n\n[33]. As outlined in the Treasury sanctions, these organizations provided material support to various Russian-aligned\nentities, including GRU and SVR elements, across several campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia’s MOD and SVR are not alone either – in 2018, USDT sanctioned another state-sponsored research institute for\noperational connections with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) [34]. Specifically calling out cyber operations,\nUSDT’s OFAC statement singled out the Kvant Scientific Research Institute for supporting offensive actions. Based on the\ninstitute’s web page, Kvant specializes in a variety of computing tasks and development work, without specifically\nreferencing Russia’s FSB or other entities [35]. Unfortunately, lack of specific details prevents us from determining the\nprecise extent of Kvant’s ‘operational’ support to FSB actions, but this does hint that perhaps XENOTIME and TsNIIKhM\nmay not be as unique as initial assessments would indicate.\n\nThere thus appears to be a complex ecosystem of government-sponsored, government-aligned, and industry-linked entities\nintimately tied to enabling Russian-linked cyber operations. Such organizations span the ‘hydra’ of Russian intelligence\nservices – FSB, GRU and SVR – although overlap or links between these entities appear limited to non-existent [36]. A key\nunifier in USDT OFAC statements is a focus on supporting roles to these agencies though, as opposed to the very direct\nposition TsNIIKhM appears to be involved in through Gladkikh’s actions under ADC. Thus, something materially different\nappears considering TsNIIKhM compared to other research organizations, where the organization’s ADC division serves\nnot just as a centre of expertise but also a potential reservoir of talent for operational purposes.\n\nIn comparison, SVA, ERA Technopolis, and (potentially) Kvant appear to be more traditional capability development\norganizations. For example, leadership of the ERA Technopolis project falls under the prestigious Kurchatov Institute,\naligning it with overall Russian (military-directed) scientific pursuits [37]. This is in addition to more dual-use\norganizations such as the civilian-military Advanced Research Foundation (ARF), specializing in a combination of\ncommercial and military research objectives [38]. Along with SVA and Kvant, the groups focus on developing and\ndeploying technologies to materially improve Russian military and defence performance. Overall, Russian government (and\nmilitary) investments have substantially increased across multiple ‘bleeding edge’ technologies, including cyber but\nextending to artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, and strategic strike capabilities, which is unsurprising, except\nwhen the researchers appear to step in front of operations as Gladkikh appears to have done.\n\nPrecisely why TsNIIKhM and its ADC element would extend beyond this traditional role to active involvement thus\nrepresents a mystery. This mystery is extended to questions on what entity – MOD, GRU, or other – tasked TsNIIKhM to\nexecute Triton and follow-on XENOTIME operations. While the involvement of a quasi-government research institute in\nsignificant cyber operations is hardly new (one can look at alleged examples such as the involvement of US national\nlaboratories in Stuxnet development [39]) the involvement in direct operations is unique. A theory postulating TsNIIKhM\nresearch leading to the development of Triton itself would be easy to accept, but failing to make this attributive statement\nwhile aligning intrusion and execution activity to a TsNIIKhM employee represents an oddity.\n\n_Figure 4: Overview of Russia-linked threat actors and support institutions._\n\n**OPERATORS AND DEVELOPERS**\n\nModern, scalable cyber operations represent a complex interaction of tasks and functions. Whether described through\nmechanisms such as the ‘Cyber Kill Chain’ [40] or through references to ‘digital quartermaster’ scenarios [41, 42], cyber\n\n\n-----\n\noperations represent a division of labour between experts and professionals when conducted at any type of scale or\nsophistication. In the case of Triton and follow-on XENOTIME events, an individual like Gladkikh may be intimately\ninvolved in initial access and follow-on lateral movement activity, but to expect the same individual also to research,\ndevelop and complete a tool such as Triton in parallel seems unreasonable, if not outright ridiculous. We thus need to\ndifferentiate between actors and deployers, and developers and researchers, where tool-specific tracking (e.g. focusing on\nTriton) differentiates from intrusion analysis and subsequent actions (post-2017 XENOTIME activity) [43].\n\nXENOTIME, in this case, represents a curiosity – an entity linked to operational outcomes (breaching Petro Rabigh,\ndeploying Triton, probing various other networks) but not developmental tasks. As such, it would appear to align closer to\nentities such as Sandworm or other Russian-linked cyber activity groups. But as a research institute, it would seem more\naligned with preparatory and tool development actions, as noted in public reporting around entities such as SVA and Kvant.\nSo from a researcher’s perspective, what is going on?\n\nFor the purposes of XENOTIME, we as researchers must question our ability to adequately identify just what this entity is\nand who they are. While their involvement (when equating XENOTIME to TsNIIKhM) in the Petro Rabigh incident should\ngo without question now, following multiple researcher and government disclosures, subsequent acts begin to appear\nmurky. We must ask ourselves what distinctions exist between researchers, developers, deployers and actors. In the case of\nGladkikh, it appears there was a unification of capabilities, but follow-on events present concerns as the involvement of\nGladkikh (beyond the US oil and gas entity), TsNIIKhM, and the ADC division, remain unknown.\n\nXENOTIME, essentially, may be an item adhering to strategic interests as opposed to a single, specific entity. In this sense,\nXENOTIME becomes a placeholder for a broader, deeper campaign linked to Russian strategic interests to develop, deploy,\nand enable critical infrastructure impacts. As such, TsNIIKhM is simply a vessel for certain actions, beholden to the\ncommand and control of some other party – whether that party is the Russian MOD, or reaches all the way to Russian\nnational command authority, remains frustratingly unknown. Post-Triton actions tracked as XENOTIME may very well be\nthe actions of whatever entity tasked TsNIIKhM.\n\nFrom a threat research and analysis perspective, we as analysts must increasingly accept and incorporate this division of\nlabour – even if the precise links and lines of authority remain obscured – into our analysis. XENOTIME represents one\nelement of what is likely a much broader campaign to research, subvert, and lay the groundwork for disrupting critical\ninfrastructure in multiple environments. Perhaps tool development resides with TsNIIKhM, or maybe this institute also,\nthrough ADC, engages in operations – but overall, the organization is merely one piece in a much larger machine using\ncyber actions to execute strategic goals.\n\nAnalysts must therefore diversify their understanding and expand their horizons. XENOTIME, while a useful moniker\nand tracking item, is an artificial construct overlaid on complex inter-agency and cross-organizational actions that most –\nif not all – organizations will have limited if any visibility into. From an attribution and tracking perspective, analysts\nshould therefore accept and embrace the limitations of collection and data sourcing to understand just what is revealed to\nus, and what remains a mystery as we delve into development, tasking, and other relationships [44]. This is not to advise\nleaving such actions alone, but rather a call to understand that our insight into complex operations, with unknown\nsponsors and multiple executing intermediaries, represents a collection item well beyond the capability of all but the most\nwell-resourced government intelligence agencies. XENOTIME, therefore, is a variable – a placeholder collecting a variety\nof actions, from Gladkikh to TsNIIKhM to the ‘unnamed’ entities in DOJ indictments, and not a unitary, specific, and\nwell-defined entity in the world.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe 2017 Triton incident represents a seminal moment in cyber operations, as this is the first (known) incident where a\nthreat actor sought to undermine fundamental process safety in a cyber-physical event. As such, Triton remains a critical\ntouchpoint in threat analysis and research, even if the attack likely failed in its objectives given the recorded results.\nHowever, the entity (or entities) responsible, tracked under the moniker of XENOTIME, remained active beyond the\nincident at Petro Rabigh. XENOTIME thus emerged as a persistent, concerning threat to critical infrastructure spanning\ncontinents given the entity’s link to physically disruptive, potentially life-threatening outcomes.\n\nYet in grasping XENOTIME and understanding what this entity really ‘is’, we face a question – while direct relationship\nwith TsNIIKhM (and its ADC division) is convenient and helpful, further analysis of events reveals a far murkier picture.\nWhile certainly possible, an organization such as TsNIIKhM engaging in offensive, potentially destructive operations on its\nown accord is not merely curious, but ridiculous within the greater ecosystem of Russia-controlled cyber operations.\nInstead, TsNIIKhM represents a player in a far wider game with multiple participants engaged in potentially destructive\noperations for ends unknown.\n\nFor threat researchers and analysts, the above may appear as so much trivial detail, but a more robust understanding of how\ncomplex cyber operations are conducted indicates ‘messy’ situations like Triton and XENOTIME are likely to be the norm\nfor future events. Looking at incidents, particularly those associated with state-directed operations, as a combination of\nefforts across multiple entities reveals the truth of such events, as composites stretching from research institutes such as\nTsNIIKhM to known elements such as GRU or SVR. While Triton and XENOTIME appear to subvert some of the\n\n\n-----\n\nexpectations around these relationships, with ADC and Gladkikh engaged in very active operations, the underlying trend of\na division of labour remains.\n\nXENOTIME thus represents less a monolithic actor than a composite of multiple stakeholders acting on the behalf of a\nnational command authority to subvert critical infrastructure functionality. Triton, as worrying as the event may be, could\nbe considered a preview of future operations as the entities subsumed under the XENOTIME label expanded their efforts to\nmultiple critical infrastructure entities. By understanding these relationships (and the dependencies they engender), we as\nthreat analysts and defenders can better appreciate the level of effort involved in such operations, and the need to\ndifferentiate between the entities on the keyboard and who their ultimate masters may be.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] [Sobczak, B.
