They are\nbased out of Russia and have been operational since 2009. They are responsible for the development and\noperations of several of the most powerful malware and ransomware variants, and maintain strong\nrelationships not just with other powerful cybercriminal gangs, but also the Russian government. The U.S.\nfederal government has indicted members of their gang and has an active bounty offered for information\non their leadership. Evil Corp has been observed modifying their activities to circumvent U.S. federal\ngovernment actions to stop them.\n\n#### Impact to HPH Sector\nEvil Corp should be considered a significant threat to the U.S. health sector based on several factors.\nRansomware is one of their primary modus operandis as they have developed and maintained many\nstrains. Many ransomware operators have found the health sector to be an enticing target as, due to the\nnature of their operations, they are likely to pay some form of ransom to restor operations. Healthcare\norganizations are particularly suceptible to data theft as personal health information (PHI) is often sold on\nthe dark web to those looking to leverage it for fraudulent purposes. Foreign governments often find it to\nbe more cost effective to steal research and intelliectual property via data exfiltration cyberattacks rather\nthan invest time and money into conducting research themselves. This includes intellectual property\nrelated to the health sector. It is entirely plausable that Evil Corp could be tasked with acquiring\nintellectual property from the U.S. health sector using such means at the behest of the Russian\ngovernment.\n\n#### Overview\nEvil Corp is a cybercriminal gang that has been exceptionally aggressive and capable in their more than\ndecade of global hacking operations. According to the U.S. Treasury Department in 2019, “Evil Corp has\n[used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845)\nfinancial institutions in over 40 countries, causing more than $100 million in theft,” and also has, “caused\nmillions of dollars of damage to U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers.”\nSeventeen members of the group have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department and two key\nmembers are under indictment by the FBI. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refered to Evil Corp\nas, [“of the world’s most prolific cybercriminal organizations.”](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/us-sanctions-russian-evil-corp/index.html) Former Assistant Attorney General Brian A.\nBenczkowski characterized some of Evil Corp's actions as having, “deployed two of the most damaging\npieces of financial malware ever used and resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to victims\n[worldwide\" and being, “the perpetrators behind the world’s most egregious cyberattacks,” and having](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hacking-and-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens)\ntargeted victims across the globe in, “one of the most widespread malware campaigns we have ever\nencountered.” The State Department and FBI have a standing offer of $5 million for information leading to\nthe arrest and conviction of their leader, Maksim Yakubets, which is the largest reward for a cybercriminal\never offered.\n\nEvil Corp is known for their development and operation of Dridex (related to Cridex and Bugat), which is a\nmultifunctional malware variant capable of impacting the confidentiality and availability of protected data\nand systems directly related to business operations. This has included banking and healthcare\ninformation The Department of Homeland Security has called Dridex [“one of the most prevalent financial](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa19-339a)\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3 Threat Profile: Evil Corp\n##       August 29, 2022   TLP: White Report: 202208291500\n\n\nTrojans.” They are also known for developing and operating Zeus and several of its major variants, as well\nas a number of prevalent ransomware variants such as Doppelpaymer, Hades, Phoenixlocker and\nWastedlocker.\n\n#### Nomenclature and Associations/Affiliations\nEvil Corp is also known as UNC2165, GOLD DRAKE and Indrik Spider. Please note that these associated\nthreat group labels are presented as coassociated with a high degree of confidence, but are not 100%\nabsolute as they represent intrusion clusters analyzed by a number of different research teams and\norganizations. It is also worth noting that there are open source assessments which associate Evil Corp\nwith TA-505, however HC3 does not currently support that conclusion.\n\n#### Leadership and Key Individuals\n\n  - Maksim Yakubets is Evil Corp’s leader and is responsible for managing and supervising the group’s\noperations as well as intefacing with the Russian government. He is known to have worked directly\nwith Andrey Ghinkul in the operations of their Dridex malware program. Yakubets has also been\nresponsible for recruiting and managing Evil Corp’s money mules – individuals responsible for\nfacilitating the movement of money illicitly gained through a series of accounts which make tracing\nthese transactions a significant challenge to law enforcement. Yakubets was indicted by a federal\ngrand jury in 2019 and charged with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, and bank fraud.\n[This was related to the distribution of Bugat, a predecessor of Dridex. He was also charged in a](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6568888-US-v-YAKUBETS.html)\nseparate criminal complaint that year with conspiracy to participate in racketeering, computer fraud\nand theft. Yakubets is also known for his relationship with the Russian government. Yakubets has\nalso provided direct assistance to one of Russia's leading intelligence organizations, the FSB, who\nwere sanctioned in December of 2016. Yakubets was known to be in the process of obtaining the\nequivalent of a security clearance to formally obtain permission to access classified information in\nsupport of the Russian FSB. Yakubets has been tasked to work on projects for the Russian\ngovernment, which included the acquisition of protected data through agressive actions in\ncyberspace and conducting cyber operations on its behalf.\n\n  - [Evgeniy Bogachev is a key member of Evil Corp who is currently wanted by the FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/evgeniy-mikhailovich-bogachev) for his\n\nmanagement of several of the prolific Zeus malware variants (including Jabber Zeus and GameOver\nZeus), used to target many sectors including healthcare in order to collect and further exploit\n[sensitive data. He is the second significant member of Evil Corp to](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6568844-Indictments-Against-Yakubets-and-Turashev.html) have been indicted in 2019,\nalong with Yakubets. Bogachev is known to go by the online monikers “lucky12345” and “slavik”.\n[Similar to yakubets, Bogachev is considered one of the most wanted hackers in the world.](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/russian-hacker-spy-botnet/)\n\n  - Igor Turashev is another key memebr who is known to have served Evil Corp as an administrator,\nhas had a role in targeting and has also maintained control over the Dridex malware project.\n\n  - Denis Gusev is another key member of Evil Corp whose role has included financial facilitator and\nlogistics coordinator. Gusev operates six businesses based out of Russia including Biznes-Stolitsa,\nOOO, Optima, OOO, Treid-Invest, OOO, TSAO, OOO, Vertikal, OOO, and Yunikom, OOO.\n\n  - Other core members of the group that carry out critical activities include Dmitriy Smirnov, Artem\nYakubets, Ivan Tuchkov, Andrey Plotnitskiy, Dmitriy Slobodskoy, and Kirill Slobodskoy. These\nindividuals are involved in management of the Dridex malware program, supervising the targeting\nprocess as well as other technical, financial and logistical aspects of the group. These individuals\nwere also named in the December 2019 indictment.\n\n  - Evil Corp is known to rely heavily on money mules. Eight Moscow-based individuals who have\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3 Threat Profile: Evil Corp\n##       August 29, 2022   TLP: White Report: 202208291500\n\n\nserved as financial facilitators for Evil Corp include Aleksei Bashlikov, Ruslan Zamulko, David\nGuberman, Carlos Alvares, Georgios Manidis, Tatiana Shevchuk, Azamat Safarov, and Gulsara\nBurkhonova. These individuals are ensure the illicit movement of stolen money in such a way to\nelude tracing by law enforcement. These individuals were also named in the December 2019\nindictment.\n\n#### Motivations\nEvil Corp is primarily a cybercriminal group and as such, is financially motivated. This motivation often\nmanifests itself in the form of digital extortion, such as ransomware attacks, as well as cyberattacks that\nfacilitate sensitive information theft – financial or otherwise – which can then be sold on the dark web for\na profit. However, where Evil Corp distinguishes themselves from many other threat actors is how they blur\n[the proverbial lines between cybercriminals and state-sponsored activities. They are known to cooperate](https://www.truesec.com/hub/blog/are-the-notorious-cyber-criminals-evil-corp-actually-russian-spies)\nwith Russian intelligence agencies, including but not necessarily limited to the FSB. While this doesn’t\n[make them unique, the extent to which their activities are driven by both personal greed and a state](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf)\npolitical agenda gives them one of the widest array of potential motivations of all the major cyber threat\nactors in the world. There is speculation that Evil Corp is simply a front organization for Russian\nintellgience, but it should be noted that they have stolen large sums of money from their victims over their\nhistory of operations.\n\n#### Common Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)\nEvil Corp have oeprated a number of prominent malware and ransomware variants over their history and\nas such, the list of tactics, techniques and protecures (TTPs) they leverage is wide. They have a wide\nvariety or technical capabilities due to both their in-house capabilities as well as the relationships they\nhave with other cybercriminal groups. They often leverage the very common tactic of phishing as wll as the\nuse of legitimate security tools and living-off-the-land techniques. A list of the tactics and techniques used\nby Evil Corp mapped against the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be found [here. The company Crowdstrike](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119/)\n[has described some of their TTPs associated with “big game” targeting and BitPaymer in this report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/)\n[Mandiant has also examined some of their TTPs](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions) asssociated with Lockbit ransomware.\n\n#### Tools and Weaponization\nEvil Corp has been known to operate and maintain a number of propriatary malware variants over time\nwhich include the following:\n\n  - Dridex: Dridex malware initially developed as one of the most powerful financial trojans. It has\n\n[evolved into a very powerful, general purpose, information stealer which has dynamic command](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2020-CTI-008.pdf)\n[and control capabilities, backdoor tactics and other post-exploitation functionality](https://cyber-anubis.github.io/malware%20analysis/dridex/) including\n[dropping additional malware. Dridex was](https://malcat.fr/blog/cutting-corners-against-a-dridex-downloader/) [previously known as Bugat.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/dridex-bugat-v5-botnet-takeover-operation)\n\n  - [Zeus: Zeus is one of the oldest banking trojans, known to operate since at least 2007 (some report](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/gameover-zeus-goz)\n\nas early as 2005). Due to its source code having leaked in 2011, several variants have since been\ndeveloped which have seen its sophistication improve. Original versions of Zeus can be prevented\nby any number of signature-based detection technologies, however the code continues to be\npublicly available and new variants continue to be developed.\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3 Threat Profile: Evil Corp\n##       August 29, 2022   TLP: White Report: 202208291500\n\n\n\n- GameOver Zeus: Gameover Zeus (or GOZ) is a Zeus variant (see above) that is built specifically to\n\ndeliver ransomware as its payload. It is often spread via phishing campaigns.\n\n- JabberZeus: Also known as AquaZeus, JabberZeus is a Zeus variant that includes a instant\n\nmessenger plugin for the Jabber platform so that attackers can communicate and collaborate\nactivity during an attack. JabberZeus operates from certain infrastructure, samples of which can be\n[found here and here.](https://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2022/01/exposing-currently-active-jabber-zeus.html)\n\n- Bitpaymer: Bitpaymer, also known as Doppelpaymer and FriedEx) is a ransomware that was\n\ndeveloped by EvilCorp and has been known to be often dropped by Dridex and in operations since\n2017. It has code similarities with Dridex.\n\n- Hades: Hades is a ransomware variant that has been in operations since December 2020. Hades is\n\n[believed to be a direct successor to Wastedlocker and is believed to have been deliberately](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/)\ndeveloped by Evil Corp for the specific purposes of evading sanctions that were announced in\n[2019. It leverages TTPs that are distinct](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/hades-ransomware-operators-use-distinctive-tactics-and-infrastructure) and despite many ransomware variants operating publicly\nand seeking affiliates and initial access brokers to partner with for attacks, Hades is operated\nprivately.\n\n\n_Figure 1: Diagram depicting Evil Corp cyberattack leveraging Dridex, several other tools and Bit Paymer ransomware, courtesy of_\n_CrowdStrike._\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3 Threat Profile: Evil Corp\n##       August 29, 2022   TLP: White Report: 202208291500\n\n\n\n  - Phoenixlocker – Also known simply as Phoenix, Phoenixlocker is a ransomware variant developed\n\n[by Evil Corp in 2021 and suspected to be part of their effort to evade sanctions issued in 2019.

It’s [often used in multi-stage attacks and is associated with ransom demands ranging from](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/wastedlocker-malware-analysis/#.YfAaIRUITTY.twitter)\n$500,000 to more than $10 million.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Evil Corp have a wide set of highly-capable tools at their disposal. These are\ndeveloped and maintained in-house, but are often used in conjunction with commodity malware, living-offthe-land techniques and common security tools that were designed for legitimate and lawful security\nassessments. Common characteristics exist between Evil Corp’s in-house tools and they are depicted by\nthe Venn diagram below:\n\n_Figure 2: A Venn diagram depicting overlapping characteristics of Evil Corp’s arsenal of cyber weapons, courtesy of Sentinel Labs._\n\nEvil Corp has also been known to use other commodity malware variants as well as publicly-available tools\nin their attacks including:\n\n  - Cobalt Strike\n\n  - Covenant\n\n  - Donut\n\n  - Koadic\n\n  - Mimikatz\n\n  - Powershell Empire\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3 Threat Profile: Evil Corp\n##       August 29, 2022   TLP: White Report: 202208291500\n\n\n\n  - PowerSploit\n\n_Figure 3: A diagram depicting the relationships between Evil Corp and other major cybercriminal ecosystem actors, courtesy of_\n_Sentinel Labs._\n\n#### Relationships\nEvil Corp has strong and enduring relationships with many of the most capable and notorious\ncybercriminal gangs around the world. These malware and ransomware operators include Doppel Spider,\nWizard Spider, Mummy Spider – all suspected to have members primarily in Russia but also the\nCommonwealth of Independent States. In addition to Evil Corp’s in-house cyber weapon arsenal, they also\nby virtue of these relationships have access to prolific malware variants such as Trickbot and Emotet, as\nwell as major ransomware operations such as Ryuk. These relationships, along with Evil Corp’s in-house\ncapabilities make them one of the world’s most powerful criminal gangs. Many of these groups and\nmalware variants have all been known to target the U.S. health sector agressively.\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3 Threat Profile: Evil Corp\n##       August 29, 2022   TLP: White Report: 202208291500\n\n\n#### Targeting and Scope of Attacks\nEvil Corp does not appear to have any geographic limitations on their targeting. Like many financiallymotivated cybercriminals, they are ostensibly motivated to attack targets of opportunity. They have been\nknown to engage in big game hunting: targeting larger organizations with deeper pockets. However,\ngeorgaphically, they do have a tendency to attack targets in the United States and Europe. In terms of\nsectors, they target finance, government, healthcare, media, transportation, instance, manuafacturing,\nnon-profits, technology and education. One of their more well-known attacks against the health sector was\n[the compromise of several Scottish hospitals that are a part of the NHS Lanarkshire board](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bit-paymer-ransomware-hits-scottish-hospitals/) in 2017 with\nthe use of BitPaymer ransomware.
