Coincidentally, the Group is also the organization behind\n\nDarkSeoul Operation[4] targeting Korean financial institutions and media houses in 2013 and the\n\ncyber-attack targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)[5] in 2014. This group mainly targets\n\nsome Asian countries like Korea and the victim industries include government, entertainment &\n\nmedia houses, army, aeronautical & astronautical institutes, financial entities and instruction\n\nindustries, etc.\n\nIn the year of 2015, we also detected an APT organization targeting government entities,\n\ntransportation companies and energy industries. Through our further investigations, it hasn’t\n\nbeen found to be connected with the Lazars Group for the time being. Due to the fact that the\n\nTrojans dropped by this organization uses Onion.City[6] as their C&C and that their malware\n\ndocument names all contain dog.jpg, this organization’s APT attacks which stretched from 2013\n\nto 2015 is code-named as Operation OnionDog. The initial malicious code dated back in May,\n\n2011, followed by at least three concentrated attacks which happened in 2013, July-August in\n\n2014 and July - September in 2015, respectively. Afterwards, we identified 96 pieces of malware\n\nalong with 14 C&C domains and IP addresses.\n\n1Operation Blockbuster, https://www.operationblockbuster.com/resources/index.html\n\n2Operation Blockbuster revealed, https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/73914/operation-blockbuster-revealed/\n\n3Operation BlockBuster unveils the actors behind the Sony attacks,\n[https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/operation-blockbuster-unveils-the-actors-behind-the-so](https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/operation-blockbuster-unveils-the-actors-behind-the-sony-attacks)\nny-attacks\n\n42013 South Korea cyberattack, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack\n\n5https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation\n\n6http://onion.link\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware of OnionDog spread itself by taking full advantage of the vulnerability in Hangul \npopular office software in Korean speaking countries; in the meanwhile, it infected targets\n\nthrough USB Worms inside an isolated network. What also caught our attention is that members\n\nof this organization communicated via Onion.City so that they could visit domains in the Deep\n\nWeb without the help of Tor browser. This has created an ideal invisible cloak for the hackers in\n\nthe anonymous environment of Tor. In addition, our in-depth analysis prevails that this threat\n\nactor tried to fly false flags or mislead investigators by adopting the techniques and resources of\n\nother APT organizations that are already revealed to the world.\n\n# Chapter 2 Persistent Cyber-espionage\n\n## 1. Initial attacks\n\nSeeing from the current data we collected, malicious program spread itself mainly by either\n\ntaking advantage of the vulnerability of HWP documents or pretending to be HWP documents.\n\nAttacks in this kind of guise usually are carried out via spearfishing emails.\n\nHangul is prevalent local office software in South Korea with the file format of HWP (Hangul\n\nWord Processor)[7]. The fact that the threat actor is using HWP documents as a shield as well as\n\nadopting HWP exploit file suggests that the targeted users must be using or at least be familiar\n\nwith Hangul.\n\n### Lure documents\n\n**Sample MD5** **Content of the lure documents**\n\n**588eef80e6f2515a2e96c9d8f4d67d5a** Government information security\n\n**700e94d4e52c4c15ebed24ec07f91f33** VTS in the ports\n\n**b9164dd8260e387a061208b89df7bb6b** Training\n\n**3c983b300c533c6909a28cef7d7469ba** IT, resumes\n\n**3df1c88a4a7dae7fdf9282d2c4375433** Investigation Report on the Korean Railway\n\nAccident\n\n7http://www.hancom.com/group.eng_main.main.do\n\n\n-----\n\n**4ad5d70d79ea5b186d48a10dfdf8085d** Welfare of civil servants\n\n**5fbe59513167be2197c9f8fbf0afa7dd** Holiday system of civil servants\n\n**cbcf18e559b87afdd059cae1f03b18d1** Salary of Korean electric companies\n\n**3e9ac32a9418723c93e8de269ad63077** Check plan during summer vacation\n\n**90b36bd4d12f34d556f363d6e5f9564f** Business plan of Korean Ministry Of Land\n\nInfrastructure and Transport\n\nTable 1 Examples of the lure documents\n\nPicture 1 Lure document - Investigation Report on the Korean Railway Accident\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 2 Lure Document - Current installation situation of VTS in important ports across the\n\ncountry\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 3 Lure document - Responsive solutions against information leakage\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 4 Lure document - 2015 Security-Check Plan\n\nfor Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercise\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 5 File property of typical lure HWP document\n\n**File Property** **Details**\n\n**Sample MD5** cbcf18e559b87afdd059cae1f03b18d1\n\n**Lure document MD5** 9a4fafb0aa9f79dee2a117d237eaa931\n\n**Content** Salary of Korea Electric Power Corp\n\n**File size** 25,088\n\n**Program writer** test1234\n\n**Creation time** 13:43:54, July 23[rd], 2014\n\n**Last edit time** 8:41:30, July 24[th], 2014\n\n**Last edit** APT-WebServer\n\nTable 2 File property of typical HWP lure document\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. Attack procedures\n\nPicture 6 Attack procedures\n\nOnce the Trojan (whether guise or exploit) is installed successfully, it will check if the installation\n\ntime is within the specific attacking time (please refer to the attacking time in the table below). If\n\nthe attacking time is over, it will stop the task and delete itself; otherwise, it will send requests to\n\nControl and Command (C&C) servers. The communication method evolves over time, for example,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe malicious program in 2014 requested the same IP and then it downloaded other Trojans\n\nthough HTTP while in the 2015 malware version, all the C&C domains are consolidated into one \n“Onion.City”. More details about it will be introduced in the chapter of “Command and Control\n\nMechanisms”.\n\nAmong all the downloaded Trojans through HTTP, USB Worm is one of them. The Worm will\n\ninfect any USB that is connected to the infected device. Then it will pass back data including the\n\ncurrent time, the name of the computer, MAC address, the status of the infection\n\n(successful/failed), etc. to its C&C server.\n\nIn addition, besides the above procedures, once the HWP exploit is successfully triggered, it will\n\nalso release a backdoor.\n\n**September 8[th], 2015**\n\n\n**August 8[th], 2015**\n\n\n**July 13[th], 2015**\n\n\n**August 9[th], 2014**\n\n\n**July 31[st], 2014**\n\n\n**October 25[th], 2013**\n\n\nTable 3 Ending time of each attacks\n\n### Dropper\n\nThe types of droppers are different depending on whether to use a guise Trojan or to drop an\n\nHWP exploit file. Furthermore, based on the difference of C&C addresses, the Trojan have some\n\nvariations, namely Trojans with fixed IP, Onion.City Trojan and test Trojan which have very little in\n\ncommon on the code architecture. To be more specific, the 2014 version malware sent request to\n\na fixed IP, but in the 2015 malware, the C&C domain was changed a consolidated one called\n\nOnion.City. Another kind of Trojan was also detected in those two years. We captured malware\n\nsamples that didn’t have C&C addresses with only downloaded pictures simply named “hello” or\n\nhave the same IP “127.0.0.1”. Therefore we inferred they are the test Trojans.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we mentioned, when the dropper is installed successfully and the date matches the attacking\n\ntime, the dropper will send request to its C&C address to download other Trojans. The\n\ndownloaded Trojans are saved in the file directory %temp% following the filename pattern of\n\n“XXX_YYY.jpg”. Together with the discoveries on lure documents, we figured out that these file\n\nnames has special meanings - usually referring to a specific industry. The correspondences are as\n\nbelow:\n\n**Time** **File name** **Correspondent Industry**\n\nleepink_kosep Korea South-East Power Co, Ltd. (KOSEP)\n\njhryum12_komipo Korea Midland Power Co, Ltd. (KOMIPO)\n\n**2014**\n\nwypark_kwater Korea Water Resources Corporation\n\nlhyuny_kospo Korea South Power Co, Ltd.

In 2015, hackers cyber-attacked some transportation organizations including but not\n\nlimited to ports, VTS, subway corporation, bus company, etc., while back in 2014, the attacks\n\nwere focused on energy industry when several electric companies and water companies became\n\nthe victims.\n\n### USB Worms\n\nUSB Worm is one of the Trojans downloaded. It affects any USB that is connected to the infected\n\ndevice and then passes back the required information to the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe detailed execution flow can be found in the picture below. If it successfully connects to the\n\nInternet, it will send information to a specific server\n\n(hXXp://strj3ya55r367jqd.onion.city/main.php, port 80). The delivered information includes the\n\ncurrent time, computer name, IP, MAC address, drive, the special string’ USB 감염성공’ and\n\n‘USB 감염실패’ (meaning the infection is success or failed). If there are logs about USB, it will\n\ncreate a file named as ‘drive\\deviceId’ to record the user’s actions and send files to the specific\n\nsever.\n\nPicture 7 USB Worm execution flow (USBman.dll)\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 8 usbrun.exe execution flow\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 9 Successful/failed USB infection\n\n### ICEFOG Backdoor\n\nRegarding the connection between the backdoor and Operation OnionDog, please see Chapter 5\n\n_ICEFOG “Rebirth”: aiming at misleading or false flagging? To know more about the functionality_\n\nof the backdoor, please see the published research from Kaspersky Lab[8].\n\n## 3. Persistent monitoring & concentrated attacks\n\nPicture 10 Attack timeline\n\nExcept for the backdoor, if other malicious Trojans want to execute all the functionalities, they\n\nwill need to check whether the time on the host computer is within the effective time of the\n\nattack. Judging from the time slot between malware compile dates and ending dates, we\n\nconcluded that the average survival time of the OnionDog Trojans should be 15 days. Picture 10\n\n8 The Icefog APT: A Tale of Cloak and Three\nDaggers,https://securelist.com/blog/research/57331/the-icefog-apt-a-tale-of-cloak-and-three-daggers/\n\n\n-----\n\nshows the attack timeline over the past few years. From 2013, the OnionDog gang carried out\n\nattacks on yearly basis and each session lasted very short time. Curiously, the ending time of the\n\ncriminal campaigns are very similar, for instance, four campaigns in 2015 ended on August 8[th]\n\nwith one day earlier than two campaigns in 2014.\n\n**Ending date** **Compile date** **Survival time**\n\nSeptember 8[th], 2015 August 27[th], 2015 12\n\nAugust 8[th], 2015 August 5[th], 2015 3\n\nAugust 8[th], 2015 August 3[rd], 2015 5\n\nAugust 8[th], 2015 July 23[rd], 2015 16\n\nAugust 8[th], 2015 July 10[th], 2015 29\n\nJuly 13[th], 2015 July 10[th], 2015 3\n\nAugust 9[th], 2014 July 18[th], 2014 22\n\nAugust 9[th], 2014 July 15[th], 2014 25\n\nJuly 31[st], 2014 July 13[th], 2014 18\n\nOctober 25[th], 2013 October 10[th], 2013 15\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 11 Codes for Ending-date checking\n\n\n-----\n\n# Chapter 3 Vulnerability Analysis\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThrough our in-depth analysis, we are sure that the vulnerability of HWP is not a zero-day one\n\nbut an already revealed one that was unveiled in the APT report from nProtect[9] back in 2011.\n\nWhen Hangul Word Processor (HWP) reads documents in HWP 2.0, it uses function strcpy to\n\nprocess the front name and has no limits on the length of bits which results in buffer overflow\n\nand covers the SEH records. After triggering the memory access exception, the actors executed\n\nmalicious codes by running the shellcode in Next SEH Record with the instruction sequence of\n\n‘pop/pop/ret’.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in HWP 2010 and some earlier versions. Please see the details below:\n\n\n**Affected versions**\n\n\nHWP 2002 5.7.9.3047 and earlier version\n\nHWP 2004 6.0.5.764 and earlier version\n\nHWP 2005 6.7.10.1053 and earlier version\n\nHWP 2007 7.5.12.604 and earlier version\n\nHWP 2010 8.0.3.726 and earlier version\n\n\n**Unaffected versions**\n\n\nHWP 2002 5.7.9.3049 and later versions\n\nHWP 2004 6.0.5.765 and later versions\n\nHWP 2005 6.7.10.1055 and later versions\n\nHWP 2007 7.5.12.614 and later versions\n\n9[Warning] Detected malicious file using HWP file’s vulnerability,\nhttp://en-erteam.nprotect.com/2011/07/caution-detected-malicious-file-using.html\n\n\n-----\n\nHWP 2010 8.0.3.748 and later versions\n\nTable 5 Affected HWP versions by the vulnerability\n\nThe table here lists the exploit documents in Operation OnionDog:\n\n**MD5** **CVE number**\n\n**26b416d686ce57820e13e572e9e33cce[10]** none\n\n**de00286f6128fb92002e0c0760855566[11]** none\n\nTable 6 List of malicious HWP document\n\n## 2. Exploit mechanism\n\nHWP supports documents in formats of .hwp, .doc, .wps, .ppt and so on. .hwp format includes\n\nHWP 2.0, HWP 3.0 and HWP 5.0. HWP 2.0 is a very old version, so when HWP process HWP 2.0\n\ndocuments, it will switch the format to HWP 3.0 automatically.\n\n10https://cryptam.com/docsearch.php?md5=26b416d686ce57820e13e572e9e33cce\n\n11https://cryptam.com/docsearch.php?md5=de00286f6128fb92002e0c0760855566\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 12 File format of HWP vulnerable documents\n\nThe offset of the font structure in HWP 2.0 is 0x48E. The first two bytes in the font structure are\n\nthe number of font names. Each font name has the length of 0x28. When HWP is processing a\n\nHWP 2.0 document, function ConvertFilterFileToWorkFile in Class CHwp20ToHwp30FilterLibrary\n\nwill be called to convert the document into an HWP 3.0 document. Function Set20FontList will be\n\ncalled to process font structure.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 13 Function Set20FontList\n\nFunction Set20FontList will read 28 bytes from the HWP 2.0 document into the array arySrc[0x28],\n\nthen loop copy bytes into aryDest[0x28] until the byte equals zero. But in the computer memory,\n\narySrc is followed by aryDest. So the attacker took advantage of it. In the process, when the last\n\nbyte of arySrc is 0x3C instead of zero, the loop will not stop and continue to copy the bytes in\n\naryDest until it triggered the access exception C0000005.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 14 Memory structure of arySrc aryDest\n\nThe overwritten data includes the SEH of the function\n\nCHwp20ToHwp30FilterLibrary::ConvertFilterFileToWorkFile.\n\nPicture 15 SEH record is covered\n\nWhile copying the 00130000, it will trigger the access exception C0000005, then it will jump to\n\nthe Windows exception handling process and call SEH Handler(7FFAC1B1) with the second\n\nparameter pointing to 12E4B8.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 16 Call SEH Handler\n\nPicture 17 pop pop ret instruction sequence\n\nThis is the instruction sequence ‘pop/pop/ret in’ ntdll.7FFAC1B1. After executing the two ‘pop’,\n\nESP pointing to 12E4B8 where the initial position of malicious shellcode is that will be executed\n\nafter the ‘Retn’ instruction.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 18 The execution of shellcode\n\nIn the end, it will create a normal HWP document in temp path and launch hwp.exe in HWP 2007\n\npath, then load the document tmp.hwp and release the malicious msserver.exe. The interesting\n\nthing is that ICEFOG malware is not even released.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Chapter 4 Command and Control\n\n Mechanisms\n\nWe differentiate the versions of OnionDog by the communication methods in the operations.\n\nThrough the sample analysis, we found that there are two main types of communication\n\nmethods: one is based on fixed IP (operation in 2014) and the other one is based on Onion.City\n\n(operation in 2015). This map points out the correspondence between OnionDog samples and\n\ntheir C&C.\n\nPicture 19 Correspondence between samples malware and their C&C\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. Onion.City\n\n\n**Related Onion.City URLs**\n\n\n**hXXp://uudv6kfdmm4pdbdm.onion.city/main.php**\n\n**hXXp://strj3ya55r367jqd.onion.city/main.php**\n\n**hXXp://u6y2j2ggtyplvzfm.onion.city/index2.php**\n\n**hXXp://qp4xhrnjuzq6glwx.onion.city/index2.php**\n\n**hXXp://j2kiphmeb4m4ek66.onion.city/index2.php**\n\n**hXXp://bcn5w6eqglytlnnn.onion.city/index2.php**\n\nTable 7 Related Onion.City URLs\n\nIn 2015, the communication method within the OnionDog gang has been fully upgraded to\n\nOnion.City which is a much more high-end and covert communication method compared to the\n\nexisting APT attacks. The role of URLs related to “index2.php” is to download other malicious\n\ncodes while the URLs related to “main.php” are used to steal data from the pass-back process.\n\nOnion.City is the communication method where web search engine adopts Tor2web proxy\n\ntechnology so that users can visit domains in the Deep Web without the help of Tor browser. This\n\nhas created an ideal invisible cloak for the attackers in the anonymous environment of Tor.\n\n## 2. Fixed IP\n\nThe communication C&C in the malicious Trojans in 2014 and 2015 are all directly connected to a\n\nfixed IP which has been hard-coded in the malicious codes. Coincidentally, the geo locations of\n\nthe IP addresses are all in Korea. However, this doesn’t necessarily indicate the threat actor is in\n\nKorea because these IPs may only be some botnets or redirectors.\n\n**C&C IP** **Geo location**\n\n**218.153.172.53** Korea\n\n**218.145.131.130** Korea\n\n**222.107.13.113** Korea\n\n\n-----\n\n**221.149.32.213** Korea\n\n**221.149.223.209** Korea\n\n**220.85.160.3** Korea\n\n**112.169.154.65** Korea\n\n**121.133.8.2** Korea\n\nTable 8 Associations between the fixed IPs and their geo locations\n\n\n-----\n\n# Chapter 5 ICEFOG “Rebirth”：aimed at\n\n misleading or false flagging?\n\n## 1. Inertial thinking in relevance analysis\n\nOur analysis of Operation OnionDog is mainly based on the data from 360 Threat Intelligence\n\nCenter to uncover the associations between different resources. Our major discoveries are the\n\nguise files that pretend to be HWP files and the HWP exploit files taking advantage of HWP files’\n\nvulnerability. They both contain lure documents and OnionDog samples. But HWP exploit files\n\nhas one more malicious file type – backdoor (please see the picture below).\n\nPicture 21 Three kinds of derivatives of HWP exploit files\n\nWe scanned the malware with our own AntiVirus engine. The result shows the backdoor belongs\n\nto ICEFOG malware families. Further manual analysis verifies that result because distinct features\n\nare recognized. For example, the encrypted memory is saved in the location\n\n“%TMP%\\mstmpdata.dat”. The encrypted data will be decrypted based on XOR logical operation\n\n[with the string ‘&*^*@~^%9?i0h’. The C&C of the backdoor is www.sejonng.org. Signs like these](http://www.sejonng.org/)\n\nseems all point to the same conclusion.\n\nICEFOG was revealed by Kaspersky in 2013. HWP exploit files appeared in July, 2014. Through\n\ncomparison between the timestamp of the ICEFOG backdoor and its first show-up timein\n\nthird-party (VirusTotal) analysis (see table below), it has been proven that the compile timestamp\n\nof ICEFOD backdoor is credible. The fact that the relevant samples already existed before\n\nKaspersky’s report also directs to the conclusion that the backdoor sample belongs to ICEFOG.\n\n**MD5 samples of ICEFOG** **84f5ede1fcadd5f62420c6aae04aa75a**\n\n**ICEFOG sample compile time** 23:39:10, May 1[st], 2013\n\n**The first show-up of ICEFOG sample Virustotal** May 6[th], 2013\n\n\n-----\n\n**Publication time of the ICEFOG report by**\n\n**Kaspersky[12]**\n\n\nSeptember 25[th], 2013\n\n\n**Sample C&C of ICEFOG** www.sejonng.org\n\n**C&C exposure time on media (ICEFOG report)** September 25[th], 2013\n\nTable 9 Relevant info of ICEFOG samples in HWP exploit files\n\n**HWP exploit file 1** **HWP exploit file 2**\n\n\n**MD5** 26b416d686ce57820e13e572e9e\n\n33cce\n\n\nde00286f6128fb92002e0c07608\n\n55566\n\n\n**Malware tracker** July 25[th], 2014 August 18[th], 2014\n\n**VirusTotal** July 25[th], 2014 August 18[th], 2014\n\n\n**MD5** **that** **releases**\n\n**“OnionDog”**\n\n**Compile** **time** **of**\n\n**OnionDog**\n\n\nbb27df0608e657215bd5fabd0e0c\n\n4d1e\n\n\n869527bcbc6e95d46103589e83\n\nc37b7e\n\n\n10:36:46, July 18[th], 2014 10:36:46, July 18[th], 2014\n\n\n**ICEFOG MD5** 84f5ede1fcadd5f62420c6aae04aa\n\n75a\n\n\n84f5ede1fcadd5f62420c6aae04a\n\na75a\n\n\n**ICEFOG compile time** 23:39:10, May 1[st], 2015 23:39:10, May 1[st], 2015\n\n\n**MD5 of lure document** 9a4fafb0aa9f79dee2a117d237ea\n\na931\n\n\n843c6952e47564586a9094320f8\n\nd8c22\n\n\n**Creation time of lure**\n\n**document**\n\n\nJuly 23[rd], 2014 July 23[rd], 2014\n\nTable 10 Relevant info of HWP exploit files\n\n\nWe have testified the backdoor is from ICEFOG samples. The samples of ICEFOG and OnionDog\n\nare both released by the same HWP exploit file. With that said, according to our initial thinking,\n\nwe almost believed that the ICEFOG must be associated with OnionDog; furthermore, ICEFOG\n\neven might be the organization behind Operation OnionDog, but is that true?\n\n12 The Icefog APT: A Tale of Cloak and Three\nDaggers,https://securelist.com/blog/research/57331/the-icefog-apt-a-tale-of-cloak-and-three-daggers/\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. Truth behind the “smoke curtain”\n\nAt the very beginning, we assumed the organization behind OnionDog should be ICEFOG, but\n\nfurther investigations make us begin to doubt. The active time of OnionDog malicious files is\n\naround the month of July in 2014. Activities of other samples were active in the similar time\n\nwindows like October in 2013, July to August in 2017 and July to September in 2015. In addition,\n\nKaspersky published its report on ICEFOG at the end of September. Usually, after being exposed\n\nby security vendors, it is time when APT organization would cease their attacks and stop using\n\nrelevant C&C or backdoors. This time, the threat actor doesn’t follow the regular rule. Of course,\n\nthe possibility still exists that the attackers was exposing themselves on purpose as long as they\n\ncan reach their goal maximally. However, it makes us begin to doubt our original assumption.\n\nAccording to the attack time listed above and our experience in APT analysis, there must be other\n\nintentions to explain why the attackers used previous attack methods even though some of the\n\nbackdoors and C&C have been unveiled and detected. Regarding their real intentions, our\n\nspeculations are:\n\na. Lack of attack capabilities leave the attackers no choice but to use previous techniques\n\nand resources;\n\nb. Attackers are very confident that they can reach the same goal even if they use old\n\ntechniques and resources because they know very well about the targets;\n\nc. Their real purpose is to fly false flags on other APT organizations or to confuse and\n\nmislead security researchers.\n\nWe did some tests on HWP exploit files in virtual environment and found that actually when the\n\nHWP exploit file was triggered, it firstly opened lure documents, and then ran the OnionDog\n\nsamples. In the whole process, it didn’t release any ICEFOG samples. That is to say, if users’\n\ncomputers are attacked by HWP exploit file, only OnionDog samples will be released and run\n\nrather than ICEFOG samples. This phenomenon aroused questions to us: why the attackers\n\nimplant a backdoor which they will never use in the following attacks to the HWP exploit?\n\nWith this question in mind, we pulled out and arranged all the attacks according to chronological\n\norder to have a better view of the whole cyber-attack campaign. Besides the timestamp of\n\nICEFOG itself, Kaspersky’s reporting time and the active time of OnionDog samples, there are two\n\n\n-----\n\ntime slots that require more attention which is related to the status of C&C domain\n\n[www.sejonng.org.](http://www.sejonng.org/)\n\nPicture 22 Timeline of HWP exploit and relevant resources\n\nIn the report of ICEFOG from Kaspersky dated to September 25[th], 2013, the domain\n\nwww.sejonng.org had yet been marked as “SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab”. Later in the historical\n\ndata of WHOIS owned by DomainTools[13], we noticed the domain was already marked as\n\n“serverHold[14]” on January 1st, 2014. What’s more, from the website snapshot[15] provided by\n\nDomainTools, it shows that the domain has already been mark as “sinkhole[16]” by Kaspersky on\n\nJune 4[th], 2014 or even earlier.\n\nAdditionally, the most recent update about domain [www.sejonng.org](http://www.sejonng.org/) is that it has been taken\n\nover and sinkholed in the WHOIS record[17] of virustracker.info.\n\n13https://whois.domaintools.com/\n\n14https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/epp-status-codes-30jun11-en.pdf\n\n15https://research.domaintools.com/research/screenshot-history/sejonng.org/#0\n\n16https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole\n\n17https://whois.domaintools.com/sejonng.org\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 23 Historical page record of “www.sejonng.org” (from DomainTools)\n\nWe deduced that when attackers started to distribute HWP exploit files, the C&C domain of\n\nICEFOG backdoor has no longer belong to themselves. Combining all the factors above, we came\n\nto the conclusion that our third assumption should be the OnionDog gang’s real purpose: to fly\n\nfalse flags on other APT organizations or mislead researchers.\n\nSimilar circumstance happened in the past APT attacks in which APT organizations used fake\n\ninformation to obstruct researcher from security companies. Taking the duqu 2.0 Analysis as an\n\nexample, researchers from Kaspersky Lab also encountered the situation where the threat actor\n\n[added some fake symbols and very rare compression algorithm to direct researchers to believe](javascript:void(0);)\n\nthe malware was related to APT1 or MiniDuke.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 24 Excerpt from Kaspersky technical report about THE DUQU 2.0[18]\n\n# Chapter 6 Special clues\n\n## 1.

Some of them are carried out to damage or destroy industrial\n\ncontrol systems, for instance, Stuxnet and Black Energy; some of them are aimed at information\n\ntheft, examples include the attacks plotted by the Lazarus Group which was finally released by\n\nthe industry alliance of Kaspersky Labs, Alien Vault Labs and Nevetta. The Operation OnionDog\n\nwe introduced here is also one of the latter. Such underground cybercrime can cause a great loss\n\nas well.\n\nIn the malicious activities of Operation OnionDog, our researchers noticed that their naming\n\nnotations are almost obsessive-compulsively consolidated. Ever since the malicious codes were\n\ncreated, their PDB paths are surprisingly coherent, for instance, the path of USB Worm is\n\nAPT-USB and the one of fishing emails is APT-WebServer. When the Trojan of OnionDog is\n\nreleased successfully, it will send requests to C&C server to download other malicious programs\n\nand save them in the file folder %temp% with the file names following the same pattern\n\n“XXX_YYY.jpg” and are associated with specific attacking targets. All these signs indicate that the\n\norganization behind OnionDog is very cautious to hide their tracks and has a very rigorous system\n\nand strategic deployment.\n\nIn 2014, OnionDog used multiple fixed IPs located in Korea as their server IPs for the Trojans. This\n\n\n-----\n\ndoesn’t necessarily indicate the threat actor is in Korea because these IPs may only some botnets\n\nor redirectors. In 2015, the network communication of OnionDog has been fully upgraded to\n\nOnion.City which is a much more high-end and covert communication method compared to the\n\nexisting APT attack.\n\nThe fact that ICEFOG samples were found in the HWP exploit files reminds us that OnionDog may\n\nadopt existing techniques and resources of some unveiled APT organizations in order to fly false\n\nflags on others or mislead our researchers. More importantly, this also rings the alarm for us that\n\nwithout discrimination between the research methods or between intelligence data, any analysis\n\nfrom single-dimension intending to track the associations has the possibility to lead us to the trap\n\nset by attackers. To reach a much more objective conclusion, we need to analyze from all facets\n\nor dimensions rigorously to avoid any subjective assumption.\n\nIn addition, in the speculation of Chapter 5 ICEFOG “Rebirth”, besides building on our own\n\nintelligence information, we also reference the published research and resources of some third\n\nparty security vendors like VirusTotal, DomainTools and Kaspersky. With the cross-validation from\n\nmultiple resources, the fidelity of the data is greatly guaranteed. Previously, in the contest\n\nbetween security vendors and cybercrime or APT organizations, resources were severely out of\n\nbalance. We hope that from now on the situation will be greatly improved through the\n\ncollaboration among security vendors and corporations on APT defense.\n\n\n-----",
