In a follow-up email sent today, after the Maze gang published more than 50 GB of the company's files, the security team deflected\nour request for comment towards its communications team. When we reached out to the communications team, our email bounced, similar to\nwhat happened in June.\n\n### Xerox incident and data\n\nBut while we have somewhat of an idea of what happened with the Maze attack on LG, things are a lot murkier when it comes to Xerox.\n\n\n-----\n\ne co pa y as ot etu ed equests o co e t se t Ju e a d today\n\nIt is unclear what internal systems the Maze gang encrypted, or if files were stolen and ransomed without encryption, similar to the LG incident.\n\nBased on a cursory review of data leaked online today, it appears that the Maze gang has stolen data related to customer support operations.\nAt the time of writing, we found information related to Xerox employees; however, we have not yet found files holding data on Xerox customers\n-- although, this is a large trove of information and reviewing all of it will take time.\n\n\nxerox-leak.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n### Citrix point of entry?\n\n[In an interview with threat intelligence company Bad Packets in June, Troy Mursch, the company's co-founder, told ZDNet that both companies](https://twitter.com/bad_packets)\nran Citrix ADC servers that at one point or another were left unpatched and vulnerable online -- according to his company's internet scans.\n\n[The servers were vulnerable to the CVE-2019-19781 vulnerability which Mursch described as \"Maze's favorite vector of compromise \"](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-target-unpatched-citrix-servers-to-deploy-ransomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\no ca y, o t e sa e day t at t e a e ga g ea ed G es o ts ea po ta, t eat te ge ce S ado te ge ce to d _et_ a\nemail that another hacker was selling access to LG America's research and development (R&D) center on a hacking forum.\n\nThe asking price was between $10,000 and $13,000, according to screenshots shared with ZDNet.\n\n\nlg-rd.png\n\n\nImage: Shadow Intelligence (supplied)\n\n\n-----",
