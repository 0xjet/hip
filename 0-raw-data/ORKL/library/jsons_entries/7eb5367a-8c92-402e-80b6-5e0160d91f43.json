In December 2021, multiple botnets including Mirai and Kinsing were\n[uncovered leveraging the Log4Shell vulnerability to breach susceptible servers on the internet.](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/threatlabz-analysis-log4shell-cve-2021-44228-exploit-attempts)\n\n[Mirai, meaning \"future\" in Japanese, is the name given to a Linux malware that has continued to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware))\ntarget connected smart home devices such as IP cameras and routers and link them together into a\nnetwork of infected devices known as a botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe IoT botnet, using the herd of hijacked hardware, can be then used to commit further attacks,\nincluding large-scale phishing attacks, cryptocurrency mining, click fraud, and distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) attacks.\n\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n[To make matters worse, the leak of Mirai's source code in October 2016 has given birth to](https://thehackernews.com/2016/10/mirai-source-code-iot-botnet.html)\n[numerous variants such as Okiru, Satori, Masuta, and](https://thehackernews.com/2020/06/ddos-botnet-hacker-jailed.html) [Reaper, making it an ever-mutating threat.](https://www.radware.com/security/ddos-threats-attacks/threat-advisories-attack-reports/reaper-botnet/)\n\n\"The [Mirai] code is so influential that even some of the malware offshoots are starting to have their\n[own code versions released and co-opted by other cybercriminals,\" Intel 471 researchers said last](https://intel471.com/blog/malware-source-code-leak-history)\n[month, pointing out the upload of the BotenaGo botnet's source code on GitHub in January 2022.](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/botenago-strike-again-malware-source-code-uploaded-to-github)\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier this January, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike noted that malware hitting Linux systems\n[increased by 35% in 2021 compared to 2020, with XOR DDoS, Mirai, and](https://thehackernews.com/2020/06/cryptocurrency-docker-image.html) [Mozi malware families](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/chinese-authorities-arrest-hackers.html)\naccounting for more than 22% of Linux-targeted threats observed in the year.\n\n\"The primary purpose of these malware families is to compromise vulnerable internet-connected\ndevices, amass them into botnets, and use them to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattacks,\" the researchers [said.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/linux-targeted-malware-increased-by-35-percent-in-2021/)\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
