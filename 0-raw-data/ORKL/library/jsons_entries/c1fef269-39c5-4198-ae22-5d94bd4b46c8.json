This list is certainly\nnot complete but already gives you an overview of what’s available. I first list the\n**frameworks and then provide an overview of some of the existing cooperation**\n**mechanisms.**\n\n## Legal Frameworks\n\n### Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, ETS No 185)\n\n2001 – International\n\nThis convention, also known as the Budapest Convention is the first international treaty to\naddress Internet and computer crime. The treaty focused on harmonising laws and\nincreasing cooperation across borders so that cybercrime could be prosecuted in the\ncountries affected. The treaty had three main objectives\n\nharmonising national laws that dealt with cyber-related crime;\nsupporting the investigation of cyber-related crimes;\nincrease the international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime.\n\n[Full text can be found at coe.int.](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention)\n\n### Directive on attacks against information systems (2013/40)\n\n2013 – Europe\n\nThis directive imposes new obligations, tasks and expectations on certain key stakeholders,\nincluding CERTs/CSIRTs, LEAs, security specialists, telecommunications service providers.\nThese relate mainly to the operation of the existing 24/7 contact points (introducing a\n\n\n-----\n\nresponse deadline obligation within 8 hours), improving criminal justice/police cooperation,\nand the obligation to strengthen statistical data collection in order to support accountability\nand rational policy making.\n\nThe Directive is well known because it establishes the criminalisation of certain tools for\ncommitting offenses\n\nThis is a directive, which needs to be transposed into national law in all individual member\nstates of Europe.\n\n[Full text can be found at eur-lex.europa.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013L0040&from=EN)\n\n### Directive on processing personal data for prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences (2016/680)\n\n2016 – Europe\n\nThis directive regulates the processing of data by police and criminal justice authorities in the\nEU. The Directive requires the data collected by law enforcement authorities to be processed\nlawfully and fairly, collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. The data can also\nonly be kept in a form that allows identification of the individual for no longer than is\nnecessary. The Directive requires that the law enforcement authorities make a clear\ndistinction between the data of different categories of persons.\n\nThis is a directive, which needs to be transposed into national law in all individual member\nstates of Europe.\n\n[Full text can be found at eur-lex.europa.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0680&from=EN)\n\n### General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR (2016/679)\n\n2016 – Europe\n\nThe GDPR is the privacy data law that is designed to harmonise and update data protection\nrequirements in the European Union. The primary objectives of the GDPR are to give control\nof personal data to EU citizens and residents. GDPR also simplifies the regulatory\nenvironment for international business within the EU.\n\nContrary to a directive, a regulation does not need to be transposed into national law, it\nimmediately applies.\n\n[Full text can be found at eur-lex.europa.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN)\n\n### Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems – NIS (2016/1148)\n\n2016 – Europe\n\n\n-----\n\nThe EU s NIS Directive (Directive on security of network and information systems) is the first\npiece of EU-wide cyber security legislation. It aims to achieve a high common level of\nnetwork and information system security across the EU’s critical infrastructure. It sets a\nrange of network and information security requirements which apply to operators of essential\nservices and digital service providers (DSPs).\n\nThis is a directive, which needs to be transposed into national law in all individual member\nstates of Europe.\n\n[Full text can be found at eur-lex.europa.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN)\n\n### EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade (JOIN/2020/18)\n\n2020 – Europe\n\nThe EU Cybersecurity Strategy focusses on building the operational capacity to prevent,\ndeter and respond to cyber incidents. One of the major focal points to increase the\noperational capacity is to establish a Joint Cyber Unit (JCU) to speed up information sharing\nbetween different cybersecurity communities in the EU. It also focusses on increased\ncooperation and strengthening collective capabilities to respond to major cyberattacks.\n\n[Full text can be found at eur-lex.europa.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020JC0018&from=EN)\n\n## Cooperation Mechanisms\n\n### CSIRTs Network (CNW)\n\nThe CSIRTs Network is a network composed of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and\nCERT-EU. The European Commission participates in the network as an observer. ENISA is\ntasked to actively support the CSIRTs cooperation, provide the secretariat and active support\nfor incident coordination upon request. The CSIRTs Network provides a forum where\nmembers can cooperate, exchange information and build trust. Members will be able to\nimprove the handling of cross-border incidents and even discuss how to respond in a\ncoordinated manner to specific incidents.\n\n### European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe EUCTF is a trust based network which meets twice yearly at Europol and provides a\nforum for the heads of the EU cybercrime units and associated countries (Denmark, Iceland,\nNorway and Switzerland), together with EUROPOL, CEPOL, EUROJUST and DG HOME to\nidentify, discuss and prioritise the key challenges and actions in the fight against cybercrime.\nThe mission statement of EUCTF is to develop and promote a harmonised approach within\nthe European Union to the criminal misuse of information and communication technology\nand the fight against cybercrime.\n\n### Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT)\n\nThe Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), launched in September 2014 helps fighting\ncybercrime within and outside the EU. J-CAT’s objective is to drive intelligence-led,\ncoordinated action against key cybercrime threats and targets by facilitating the joint\nidentification, prioritisation, preparation, initiation and execution of cross-border\ninvestigations and operations by its partners. It consists of 9 EU Member States, 7 non-EU\npartner countries and Europol.\n\n### European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN)\n\nThe European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) was established in 2016 to foster\ncontacts between practitioners specialised in countering the challenges posed by\ncybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace, and to increase the\nefficiency of investigations and prosecutions. Eurojust is a key partner of the EJCN,\nespecially in situations in which the Network deals with the numerous challenges related to\nthe genuinely borderless nature of cybercrime.\n\n### 24/7 Points of Contact Network\n\nThis network was constructed under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime\n\n### Joint Cyber Unit\n\nThe JCU is part of the new EU Cybersecurity Strategy and has as goal to speed up\ninformation sharing between different cybersecurity communities in the EU.\n\n\n-----",
