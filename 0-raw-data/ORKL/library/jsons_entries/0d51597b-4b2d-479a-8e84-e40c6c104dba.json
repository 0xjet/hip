Chubb spokesperson\nJeffrey Zack said the company had “no evidence” the incident affected Chubb’s own network\nand that its network “remains fully operational.”\n\nBut the spokesperson declined to comment further or answer any of our questions, including\nif its customers were affected.\n\nBrett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft, first alerted TechCrunch to the breach\non Thursday. According to Callow, the security incident was a data-stealing ransomware\nattack launched by the Maze ransomware group. Maze not only spreads across a network,\ninfecting and encrypting every computer in its path, it also exfiltrates the data to the\nattackers’ servers where it is held for ransom. If a ransom isn’t paid, the attackers publish the\nfiles online.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December, the FBI [privately warned businesses of an increase in Maze-related](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fbi-maze-ransomware/)\nransomware incidents.\n\nCallow said the attackers behind the incident posted a listing on their website claiming to\nhave data stolen from Chubb in earlier in March. The listing included the names and email\naddresses of three senior executives, including CEO Evan Greenberg.\n\nAt the time of writing, the attackers have not yet published any of the stolen files.\n\nChubb is one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the United States, offering incident\nresponse services and covering companies from losses caused by data breaches. Target\n[last year filed a $74 million lawsuit against Chubb after the retailer claimed the insurance](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/legal-security-news/target-files-74-million-suit-against-chubb-over-breach-coverage/)\ncarrier failed to properly compensate it for the costs incurred from its 2013 data breach\ninvolving the theft of 110 million customers’ data.\n\n_Got a tip?
