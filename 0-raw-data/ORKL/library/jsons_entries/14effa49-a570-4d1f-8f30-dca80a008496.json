DEV-0196 is now tracked as\n**Carmine Tsunami.**\n\nTo learn more about this evolution, how the new taxonomy represents the origin,\nunique traits, and impact of threat actors, and a complete mapping of threat actor\n[names, read this blog: Microsoft shifts to a new threat actor naming taxonomy.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/18/microsoft-shifts-to-a-new-threat-actor-naming-taxonomy/)\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence analysts assess with high confidence that a threat group\ntracked by Microsoft as DEV-0196 is linked to an Israel-based private sector offensive actor\n(PSOA) known as QuaDream. QuaDream reportedly sells a platform they call REIGN to\ngovernments for law enforcement purposes. REIGN is a suite of exploits, malware, and\ninfrastructure designed to exfiltrate data from mobile devices.\n\nIn this blog, Microsoft analyzes DEV-0196, discusses technical details of the actor’s iOS\nmalware, which we call KingsPawn, and shares both host and network indicators of\ncompromise that can be used to aid in detection.\n\nOver the course of our investigation into DEV-0196, Microsoft collaborated with multiple\npartners. One of those partners, Citizen Lab of the University of Toronto’s Munk School,\nidentified at least five civil society victims of the DEV-0196 malware that included journalists,\n\n\n-----\n\npolitical opposition figures, and a non-government organisation (NGO) worker, in North\nAmerica, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Furthermore, Citizen\nLab was able to identify operator locations for QuaDream systems in the following countries:\nBulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Ghana, Israel, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, United Arab\n[Emirates, and Uzbekistan. Read the Citizen Lab report here.](https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/spyware-vendor-quadream-exploits-victims-customers/)\n\nMicrosoft is sharing information about DEV-0196 with our customers, industry partners, and\nthe public to improve collective knowledge of how PSOAs operate and raise awareness\nabout how PSOAs facilitate the targeting and exploitation of civil society. For more info, read\n[Standing up for democratic values and protecting stability of cyberspace.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=65590)\n\n## DEV-0196: A private-sector offensive actor based in Israel\n\nPSOAs, which Microsoft also refers to as cyber mercenaries, sell hacking tools or services\nthrough a variety of business models, including access as a service. In access as a service,\nthe actor sells full end-to-end hacking tools that can be used by the purchaser in cyber\noperations. The PSOA itself is not involved in any targeting or running of the operations.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence analysts assess with high confidence that DEV-0196 uses this\nmodel, selling exploitation services and malware to governments. It’s not directly involved in\ntargeting. Microsoft also assesses with high confidence that DEV-0196 is linked to an Israel[based private company called QuaDream. According to the Israeli Corporations Authority,](https://ica.justice.gov.il/GenericCorporarionInfo/SearchCorporation?unit=8)\nQuaDream, under the Israeli name קוודרים בע”מ, was incorporated in August 2016. The\ncompany has no website, and there is little public reporting about the company, with a few\nnotable exceptions.\n\n[QuaDream came to international attention in a 2022 Reuters report, which cited a company](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-iphone-flaw-exploited-by-second-israeli-spy-firm-sources-2022-02-03/)\nbrochure that described the REIGN platform and a list of capabilities, the report also notably\nsuggested that QuaDream used a zero-click iOS exploit that leveraged the same\nvulnerability seen in NSO Group’s ForcedEntry exploit. An earlier report by Israeli news\noutlet Haaretz, also citing a QuaDream brochure, revealed that QuaDream did not sell\nREIGN directly to customers but instead did so through a Cypriot company. Haaretz also\nreported that Saudi Arabia’s government was among QuaDream’s clients, as was the\ngovernment of Ghana. However, Haaretz could not confirm allegations made in the Ghanian\npress and [repeated in the Israeli press that QuaDream employees were among 14 Israeli](https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3852192,00.html)\ntech workers from different companies who travelled to Accra, Ghana in 2020 to meet with\nthe incumbent administration three months prior to the presidential election for the purposes\nof a special project relating to it.\n\n[QuaDream was mentioned in a December 2022 report from Meta, which reportedly took](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Threat-Report-on-the-Surveillance-for-Hire-Industry.pdf)\ndown 250 accounts associated with the company. According to the report, Meta observed\nQuaDream testing its ability to exploit iOS and Android mobile devices with the intent “to\n\n\n-----\n\nexfiltrate various types of data including messages, images, video and audio files, and\ngeolocation.”\n\n## Technical investigation: DEV-0196 malware\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence analysts assess with high confidence that the malware, which\nwe call KingsPawn, is developed by DEV-0196 and therefore strongly linked to QuaDream.\nWe assess with medium confidence that the mobile malware we associate with DEV-0196 is\npart of the system publicly discussed as REIGN.\n\nThe captured samples targeted iOS devices, specifically iOS 14, but there were indications\nthat some of the code could also be used on Android devices. Since the malware sample\ntargets iOS 14, some of the techniques used in this sample may no longer work or be\nrelevant on newer iOS versions. However, we assess it’s highly likely that DEV-0196 will\nhave updated their malware, targeting newer versions to account for this. Analysis of the\nmalware revealed that it is split into multiple components. The sections below focus on two of\nthose components: a monitor agent and the main malware agent.\n\n### Monitor agent\n\nThe monitor agent is a native Mach-O file written in Objective-C. It is responsible for reducing\nthe forensic footprint of the malware to prevent detection and hinder investigations. It has\nmultiple techniques to do this, one of which is monitoring various directories, such as\n_/private/var/db/analyticsd/ and /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter, for any_\nmalware execution artifacts or crash-related files. Once these artifacts or files are identified,\nthe monitor agent deletes them.\n\nThe monitor agent is also in charge of managing the various processes and threads\nspawned on behalf of the malware to avoid artifacts created from unexpected process\n[crashes. The agent uses the waitpid function to monitor all child processes that are](https://linux.die.net/man/2/waitpid)\nspawned, and the child process IDs are added to a tracking list. The monitor agent attempts\n[to safely shut down tracked child processes by calling sigactionwith the SIGTSTP parameter,](https://linux.die.net/man/2/sigaction)\nif sigaction returns successfully this means the child process is reachable and a SIGKILL\ncommand is sent to kill it. This avoids sending a kill command to a non-existent PID, which\ncan leave error messages and artifacts behind.\n\n### Main agent\n\nThe main agent is also a native Mach-O file. However, it is written in Go, a highly portable\nlanguage, which was likely chosen because it allows compilation across multiple platforms,\nreducing development effort.\n\nThis agent includes capabilities to:\n\n\n-----\n\nGet device information (such as iOS version and battery status)\nWi-Fi information (such as SSID and airplane mode status)\nCellular information (such as carrier, SIM card data, and phone number)\nSearch for and retrieve files\nUse the device camera in the background\nGet device location\nMonitor phone calls\nAccess the iOS keychain\nGenerate an iCloud time-based one-time password (TOTP)\n\nIt achieves some of these functionalities, for example the surreptitious camera use, by\n[leveraging two key binaries, tccd and mediaserverd, a technique described by ZecOps. The](https://blog.zecops.com/research/how-ios-malware-can-spy-on-users-silently/)\nname tccd stands for Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) Daemon, and the process\nmanages the access permissions for various peripherals such as the camera and\nmicrophone. Normally, users are met with a pop-up prompt from the tccd process, alerting\nthem that something has requested access to the camera, microphone, or other peripheral,\nand the user is required to either allow or deny it. In this compromise scenario, the agent\ninjects itself into the tccd binary, which allows the agent to spawn both new processes and\nthreads as part of the exploitation process, and also allows it to bypass any tccd prompts on\nthe device meaning the user would be unaware of camera compromise. In concert with tccd,\nthe agent also provisions itself permission to run in the background via mediaserverd. This\nbinary handles the interface that other apps interact with when utilizing the camera. For more\n[details on iOS process injection, tccd and other system components, see Jonathan Levin’s](http://newosxbook.com/src.jl?tree=listings&file=inject.c)\n[macOS and iOS internals books and](http://newosxbook.com/home.html) [blog.](http://newosxbook.com/code.html)\n\n[The techniques used in the main agent include a PMAP bypass, an](https://papers.put.as/papers/ios/2019/bluehatil-luca.pdf) Apple Mobile File\n[Integrity (AMFI) bypass, and a sandbox escape. PMAP is one of the mechanisms that works](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/AppleMobileFileIntegrity)\n[with the Page Protection Layer (PPL) to prevent unsigned code from running on iOS devices.](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/web#:~:text=Page%20Protection%20Layer%20(PPL)%20in,code%20signature%20verification%20is%20complete.)\nAMFI is a protection mechanism comprised of multiple components including a kernel\nextension, AppleFileMobileIntegrity.kext, as well as userland daemon, amfid. The [sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox)\nlimits access to system resources and user data via an entitlements system. Although PMAP,\nPPL, AMFI, and the sandbox have been hardened over the years, advanced attackers\n[attempt to circumvent these protection mechanisms in order to run unsigned code.](https://www.objc.io/issues/17-security/inside-code-signing/)\n\n[The agent also creates a secure channel for](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/689696) [XPC messaging by creating a nested app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc)\nextension called fud.appex. XPC messaging allows the agent to query various system\nbinaries for sensitive device information, such as location details. Although there is a\nlegitimate binary called fud on iOS devices that is part of the Mobile Accessory updater\nservice, fud.appex is not part of a legitimate Apple service. The agent creates the malicious\napp extension inside the folder /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/PlugIns/.\nThe primary reason for performing XPC messaging from within this application extension is\nto establish a covert channel that enables the agent to avoid being monitored. This nested\ndirectory technique means that the XPC service is registered such a way that it is only visible\n\n\n-----\n\nto the app extension itself, so any external monitoring by other applications and system\nprocesses is far more difficult. Upon unhooking and restoring tccd to its original state, the\nentire PlugIns folder is removed to further hide any artifacts of its existence.\n\nIn their [blog, Citizen Lab discusses the presence of likely malicious calendar events on](https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/spyware-vendor-quadream-exploits-victims-customers/)\ndevices compromised by DEV-0196’s malware, so another notable function of the main\nagent is that it contains specific code to remove events from the device’s calendar. The\nagent searches all calendar events from two years prior to the current time and up to the\nfurthest possible allowed future time, removing any events that are tied to a given email\naddress as the “organizer”. The agent also removes the email address from the\n_[idstatuscache.plist, which is a database containing records of the first contact of the device](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt/blob/main/docs/ios/records.md)_\nwith other iCloud accounts. This list would contain the email address that sent the malicious\ncalendar invitation, as well as a time stamp of the original interaction, such as when the invite\nwas received.\n\nThere is additional functionality within the agent to cover its tracks by removing artifacts of\nlocation monitoring from the locationd process’ records. To first query locations from\n_locationd, the agent must register a client that communicates with locationd via XPC_\nmessaging. The locationd process then stores a record of these connections in\n/private/var/root/Library/Caches/locationd/clients.plist. The malicious agent searches for\nitems in the client plist that have a suffix of subridged, and then removes them, which\nindicates that the name of their location monitoring client likely ends in that word. This is\nanother example of malicious activity attempting to masquerade as benign system\nprocesses, since subridged is the name of a legitimate Apple binary, a part of the\nSoftwareUpdateBridge Framework.\n\n## Technical investigation: DEV-0196 infrastructure\n\nMicrosoft developed unique network detections that could be used to fingerprint DEV-0196’s\ninfrastructure on the internet. The group heavily utilized domain registrars and inexpensive\ncloud hosting providers that accepted cryptocurrency as payment. They tended to only use a\nsingle domain per IP address and domains were very rarely reused across multiple IP\n[addresses. Many of the observed domains were deployed using free Let’s Encrypt SSL](https://letsencrypt.org/)\ncertificates, while others used self-signed certificates designed to blend in with normal\nKubernetes deployments.\n\nWe have included network-based indicators at the end of this post for detection purposes.\nOften, threat actors employ domains that carry country-specific TLDs or themes that align\nwith the location of intended targets. Notably, our list of DEV-0196 domains includes domains\nstrongly associated with some countries that Citizen Lab has identified as locations of\nvictims, countries where QuaDream platforms were operating, or both. To be clear, the\nidentification of victims of the malware in a country doesn’t necessarily mean that an entity in\nthat country is a DEV-0196 customer, as international targeting is common.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Prevention and detection\n\nPreventing exploitation of mobile devices by advanced actors who potentially have zero-click\nexploits is difficult. There are also significant challenges in detecting an attack on mobile\ndevices, both during and after the compromise. This section discusses some methods for\nminimizing the risk of malicious actors compromising mobile devices, and then provides\nsome indicators of compromise we associate with DEV-0196 activity.\n\nBasic [cyber hygiene is important in helping prevent mobile device compromise. Specific best](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/cyber-hygiene)\npractices include keeping the device’s software updated to the latest version, enabling\nautomatic software updates if available, using anti-malware software, and being vigilant\nabout not clicking links in any unexpected or suspicious messages.\n\nIf you believe you may be targeted by advanced attackers and use an iOS device, we\n[recommend enabling Lockdown Mode. Lockdown Mode offers enhanced security for iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212650)\ndevices by reducing the attack surface available to threat actors.\n\n### Sentinel detections\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytic to automatically match the\nmalicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI\nMap analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence\nsolution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their\nSentinel workspace. More details on the Content Hub can be found here:\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-deploy.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-deploy)\n\nIn addition, customers can access the shared indicators in a structured format via GitHub so\nthat they can be integrated into custom analytics and other queries:\n[https://github.com/microsoft/mstic/blob/master/RapidReleaseTI/Indicators.csv.](https://github.com/microsoft/mstic/blob/master/RapidReleaseTI/Indicators.csv)\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n### Host-based indicators\n\nThese host-based indicators are indicative of DEV-0196 activity; however, they shouldn’t be\nused solely as attribution since other actors may also use the same or similar TTPs.\n\nThe file existing, or process activity from,\n_/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/subridged_\n\nThe file existing, or process activity from, com.apple.avcapture\n\nThe folder /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/PlugIns/fud.appex/ existing, or\nhaving activity detected from the folder.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Network indicators\n\nBased on the results of our C2 investigation, Microsoft Threat Intelligence associate the\nfollowing domains with DEV-0196 activity. The dates the domains were first detected as likely\nin use is given, along with the last seen active date.\n\n**Domain** **First active** **Last active**\n\nfosterunch[.]com 2022-05-30
