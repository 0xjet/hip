This analysis covers the payloads deployed, the tactics used in\nthe attacks, and basic recommendations for strengthening cloud security.\n\nBy: Alfredo Oliveira, David Fiser July 27, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\nThe [misconfiguration and resulting exposure of cloud services is one of the most prevalent risks in the Linux](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/devops/21/c/misconfigurations-avoid-the-risk.html)\nthreat landscape. We previously analyzed incidents related to this security concern, such as an exposed\n[Docker API being abused by threat actors in the wild and exposed Redis instances that threat actors actively](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/d/exposed-redis-instances-abused-for-remote-code-execution-cryptocurrency-mining.html)\nsearch.\n\n[This blog post will focus on another piece of the puzzle: Apache Hadoop YARN, a part of the](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) Hadoop\nframework that is responsible for executing tasks on the cluster.\n\nIt should be noted that the exposure of these cloud services is not because they are inherently unsecure, but\nonly because of misconfiguration. Nevertheless, this is an alarming security risk as it allows remote code\n[execution (RCE) on the cluster. Unfortunately, threat actors have been actively exploiting these services for](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/blob/master/hadoop/unauthorized-yarn/exploit.py)\nyears.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Example of malicious request on an exposed YARN service\nTo examine this risk, we experimented with exposing such services in the wild. We then learned that it didn’t\ntake too long for threat actors to find the exposed service and deploy various malicious payloads. In the\nfollowing section, we will discuss the malware families targeting exposed YARN services.\n\n## Payloads deployed in the attacks: Kinsing and other cryptojacking malware\n\nAs [cryptojacking malware is known to be one of the dominant and common payloads for Linux environments, it](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/defending-systems-against-cryptocurrency-miner-malware)\nis no surprise that they were deployed in the YARN service as well. In this case, the payload belongs to a wellknown malware family — Kinsing (detected as Trojan.Linux.KINSING.AB and Trojan.SH.KINSING.G).\n\nAt the onset of the attack, the threat actors send commands to the exposed service via an HTTP POST\nrequest. As an unintended response, the YARN then creates a launch script that incorporates the attackers’\ncommands.\n\nFigure 2. Example of\n\nexecuting script produced by YARN\n[Once the Hadoop container script is executed, it downloads a remote script that deploys Kinsing malware.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/container)\n\nFigure 3. Example of a Kinsing family identifier\n\nIt also deploys a Go-compiled binary with spreading capability. This binary communicates with the remote\n[command-and-control (C&C) server, providing a backdoor to the infected system as well as deploying the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/command-and-control-server)\nknown Kinsing cryptojacking process called kdevtmpfsi.\n\nNotably, Kinsing is not the only cryptojacking malware found there. The cryptocurrency mining arena remains a\n[battlefield for resources. We found a competitor cryptojacking malware in Hadoop YARN as well. This](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/i/war-of-linux-cryptocurrency-miners-a-battle-for-resources.html)\ncompeting malware then proceeds to eradicate Kinsing from the system.\n\nFigure 4. Example of cryptojacking competition inside Hadoop YARN deployed payloads\n\n\n-----\n\n## What are the tactics used in these attacks?\n\nThreat actors aiming to exploit these misconfigured cloud services commonly employ several tactics.\n\nFirst, threat actors disable the system’s protection. As security solutions for cloud services become more\npopular in enterprises, threat actors adapt by searching for and attempting to uninstall protection software. This\nfunctionality is common in cryptojacking malware.\n\nFigure 5. Example of cloud security tools and services removal\nThreat actors also gather credentials. With the ever-increasing variety of platforms that require authentication\n[for access, the need for access tokens and so-called secrets — sensitive information such as credentials used](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/f/secure_secrets_managing_authentication_credentials.html)\nto access systems — also grow. It’s not uncommon for users who have a hard time keeping track of them to\n[save these on the machines where they are used. Sadly, this is done without any additional protection. Threat](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/f/secure_secrets_managing_authentication_credentials.html)\nactors are aware of this, and those who successfully access the systems actively seek these unshielded\ncredentials.\n\nAnd of course, they don’t stop with harvesting: they also use these credentials to gain entry into other systems\n— even non-cloud ones — to infect them. We have similarly observed this behavior in a previous research\npaper on TeamTNT. With this, it can be deduced that threat actors try to infiltrate as many systems as possible\nto maximize their gains.\n\nFigure 6. Example of maximizing the infection based on research of SSH usage on victim’s system\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be emphasized that if the private key that the threat actors used for accessing another system was\nprotected by the owner with at least a passphrase encrypting for the key, the infection of the target system will\nbe unsuccessful. This highlights the importance of employing such security precautions.\n\n[Finally, as we shared in our previous research on the Linux threat landscape, we found out that it is quite](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-look-at-linux-threats-risks-and-recommendations)\ncommon for threats to spread from one infected device to another. To do this, threat actors are using port\nscanning tools such as masscan to identify exposed and vulnerable services. Once these services are\nidentified, the threat actors try to deploy their payload.\n\nFigure 7. Example of infection attempt to exposed Redis instance\n\n## Other malware variants and environments\n\nThe list of payloads would be incomplete without mentioning the infamous Mirai botnet. A threat that is\n[commonly seen in internet of things (IoT) environments, it later evolved and also targeted other platforms such](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/internet-of-things)\nas [Hadoop YARN infected containers.](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/mirai-used-as-payload-in-hadoop/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Example of open\n\ndirectory of Mirai builds for different architectures\nSince the Hadoop YARN service can also run on Windows, threats that were crafted for this platform can also\nbe found in the cluster.\n\nFigure 9. Example of malicious power shell script\n\n## Strengthening cloud service security\n\nAs reliance on online systems continues to grow, cloud services are becoming a vital part of enterprises. Cloud\nsecurity should not be taken for granted. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Deliberately configure cloud service. Users can maximize the built-in security settings afforded by**\nthese platforms.\n**Employ the principle of least privilege. Here, users will only be granted the minimum amount of access**\nrequired for their task.\n**Adhere to the shared responsibility model. Users, and not just cloud service providers, are responsible**\nfor keeping these platforms secure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Don t store credentials in plaintext; consider using secret vaults. These store secrets in encrypted**\n[form. They can also be used to alter secrets from one place and reflect that modification to multiple](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/f/secure_secrets_managing_authentication_credentials.html)\napplications without the need for a code change.\n\n[Cloud security solutions, such as Trend Micro Cloud One™, help enterprises secure cloud services.
