This blog post might useful for security engineers, researchers, and security analysts to\ncatch up with current cybersecurity issues specifically malware threats and APT hunting as the exploit has spread in the wild\nand been mentioned by a few security researchers on Twitter. By the end of this blog post, readers will understand the\nexploitation that happened to the compromised user via a malicious document using CVE-2022-30190 aka Follina attack\ntechnique. Furthermore, security analysts can collect the given IOCs extracted from the malware to check whether your\nenvironment has been compromised or not.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[On May 27, security researchers from the Nao_sec team posted a tweet regarding an interesting malicious document that](https://twitter.com/nao_sec/status/1530196847679401984?s=20&t=MAx6uh6m30I2txgWxLmXgw)\nloads a malicious external link (HTML file) residing in the remote server which then uses the \"ms-msdt\" scheme to execute\nPowerShell code upon the malicious document opened. This unique sample and technique caught all security practitioners\nand researchers including the NetbyteSec team. Figure 0 below shows Nao_sec's Twitter post.\n\nFigure 0: Nao_sec's Twitter post\n\nOn 30 May 2022, Microsoft released the CVE identifier for the vulnerability which is CVE-2022-30190 while infosec people\non Twitter call this Zero-Day attack technique as Follina. Microsoft and infosec people have reported active exploitation of\nthis vulnerability in the wild since April 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool interface\n\nMicrosoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) is a diagnostic tool that collects information and sends it to Microsoft for analysis\nwhen users encounter certain issues. Microsoft uses this information to find solutions for the problems encountered by users.\n\"A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT in Windows is called using the URL protocol from a calling\n_application such as Microsoft Office Word. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with_\n_the privileges of the calling application.\" Microsoft said. The attacker can then take over the system, run malicious code and_\nconduct post-exploitation activities without relying on Macros anymore.\n\n## Overview of the attack\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Follina malicious document flow\n\nThe malicious document could be delivered in DOCX, DOC, or RTF format. All the format works well to exploit this MSDT\nscheme vulnerability. The attacker craft the malicious HTML and serve the URL to the remote server to be loaded by\n_document.xml.rels in the document. While RTF, the HTML URL is located under object control word and will be loaded upon_\nopening the RTF or previewing the RTF via the preview pane. After HTML is loaded, it will trigger the ms-msdt scheme and\ncontinue to execute the malicious PowerShell code. The impact of the attack might result in the user being infected with the\npost-exploitation activities and malware infection.\n\n## Impact of the attack\n\nRemote code execution and malware host/infection. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary\ncode and take control of an affected system which can cause disruption in the organization's operation, data leakage, and\nmany more.\n\n## Vulnerability Affected Products\n\nWindows Server, version 20H2 (Server Core Installation)\nWindows Server 2022 Azure Edition Core Hotpatch\nWindows Server 2022\nWindows Server 2019\nWindows Server 2016\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows Server 2012 R2\nWindows Server 2012\nWindows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 2\nWindows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 2\nWindows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1\nWindows RT 8.1\nWindows 8.1\nWindows 7\nWindows 11\nWindows 10\nWindows 10 Version 21H2\nWindows 10 Version 21H1\nWindows 10 Version 20H2\nWindows 10 Version 1809\nWindows 10 Version 1607\n\n## Proof-of-Concept\n\nResearchers have reproduced the zero-day with multiple versions of Microsoft Office and even publish their Follina malicious\ndocument generator on GitHub. Netbytesec team also was able to conduct the Proof-of-Concept of the MSDT exploit which\nallows us to execute the calc.exe program as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 3: MSDT exploit POC\n\nThe attack is very simple to reproduce and all we need is to create a dummy document with an OLE object and save it. Then\nmodify some important attributes in word/_rels/document.xml.rels and serve the HTML with the ms-msdt scheme\nat http://<attacker>/payload.html. Thus, this exploit technique might be popular from now on for malicious document\nweaponization purposes.\n\nThe figure below shows the payload.html being serve on the remote machine containing the MSDT scheme to execute our\nPowerShell code, in this case, \"calc.exe\".\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: HTML with the ms-msdt scheme\n\nFurthermore, the attack also appeared to be triggered by preview pane where all we need is to let the victims preview the\nmalicious RTF file via the preview pane and they will get pwned without even opening the file. This attack vector might be\noverlooked by victims. So, the zero-click attack for the RTF in this situation is legitimate.\n\nFigure 5: POC of the preview pane attack vector\n\nSo, basically, the other attacker might replicate the zero-day attack by:\n\n1. Unzip the first discovered sample\n2. Replace the \"Target\" attribute of oleObject type with their remote HTML. Refer to figure 6 below.\n3. Zip the file and save it as DOC, DOCX, or RTF.\n4. Create and generate the HTML and serve it on the internet.\n[5. The HTML must be at least 4096 bytes as mentioned by a security researcher on his Twitter.](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1531250993127739392?s=20&t=4NeWK7yqp1gHT5wynOQWAA)\n6. The code should contain in $() to PowerShell to execute it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Change the original URL with the new URL\n\nNote that some attackers might encode their PS code with base64 like the sample discovered by the Nao_sec team. Figure 7\nbelow shows the malicious encoded PowerShell code in the HTML file.\n\nFigure 7: Encoded Powershell code in Nao_sec shared sample\n\nAfter the Nao_sec team's tweet post blew up, a few security researchers investigated and create their Proof-of-Concept and\npublish it on their GitHub as shown in figure 8-10 below. With all this shared POC, it will be easier for an attacker to replicate\nthe attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: POC by John Hammond\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Another POC and step by step instructions\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: POC by chvancooten\n\n## Process behavior: SysMon and ProcMon perspective\n\nObserving the process behavior analysis based on SysMon and ProcMon monitoring results, we can see that the malicious\ndocument leverages the ms-msdt scheme to execute the attacker's malicious PowerShell code. Figure below shows the\n_msdt.exe program run the ms-msdt scheme to execute the malicious code under the parent process Microsoft Word's_\napplication. So, a spawned msdt.exe process under the WINWORD.EXE process should be aware.\n\nFigure 11: Winword.exe spawned msdt.exe containing the malicious msdt scheme\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the Sysmon artifacts are also valuable to us, we can see that a Process Create action was detected in the Sysmon\nshowing that a program msdt.exe were launched with the CommandLine containing the malicious msdt scheme executing\nPowerShell code (run our calc.exe program).\n\nFigure 12: Sysmon showing the process creation of msdt.exe with the malicious commandline\n\nMoreover, the actual process that calls the calc.exe is sdiagnhost.exe via Conhost.exe as the child process as shown in the\nfigure below.\n\nFigure 13: The payload (calc.exe) will be spawned as a child process of sdiagnhost.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nObserving the Sysmon log below, our payload process (calc.exe) has been created with Parent Image sdiagnhost.exe.\n\nFigure 14: sdiagnhost.exe is the parent process of our calc.exe payload\n\nIn such a way, keeping our eye on the child processes of msdt.exe and the sdiagnhost.exe would be enough to monitor this\ntype of attack.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nNetbytesec team retrieve some of the samples in the wild including the sample shared by the Nao_sec team on their Twitter\nand analyze how the exploit works and was able to reproduce the attack as mentioned in the proof-of-concept section.\n\n### Samples overview\n\nNetbytesec team analyzed some samples in the wild including the one from the Nao_sec tweet which is 05-2022_0438.doc (MD5: 52945af1def85b171870b31fa4782e52) uploaded from Belarus. This sample does not conduct using any_\ntheme as the content of the document is a plain document.\n\n[Also, reports said some samples using this Follina attack have been discovered targeting the Philippines.](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1522302380406153219?s=20&t=jICWDlt51iTRcn08KzA3fA)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: CSAFP'S_GUIDANCE_RE_NATIONAL_AND_LOCAL_ELECTION_2022_NLE.docx\n\nBack in April 2022, two samples were identified by security researchers uploaded to VirusTotal targeting Russia as the\nattacker using Russia-themed to lure victims. Figure 16 and 17 below show the Russia-themed document abusing MSDT.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: приглашение на интервью.doc (invitation for an interview.doc) sample\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: РЭТ-ЮМ-3044 от 12.04.2022.doc (RET-YUM-3044 from 04/12/2022.doc) sample\n\nBoth of the above samples share the same remote server URL which is hxxps://www[.]sputnikradio[.]net\n\nAnother detected sample in the wild was submitted to VirusTotal in April of 2022. The document looks like luring victims using\nsexual issues.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: Exposing_Sonish_Liar!!!.doc\n\nAnother sample detected by Proofpoint spotted that China advance persistent threat group exploiting Follina as shown in the\ntweet below. With such a piece of news, organizations and the blue team should be more careful and keep an eye on this\nattack in their environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: https://twitter.com/threatinsight/status/1531688214993555457\n\nOn 3rd June of 2022, another sample was raised exploiting Follina but this time, the attacker crafted the document and save\nit as an RTF file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20: Malicious RTF content regarding employment agreement (242d2fa02535599dae793e731b6db5a2)\n\n### 05-2022-0438.doc analysis\n\nMD5 hash: 52945af1def85b171870b31fa4782e52\n\nThe malicious document that uses this vulnerability contains the file \"document.xml.rels\" located in \"\\word\\_rels\" that loads\nthe malicious HTML residing in the attacker's remote server at hxxps//www[.]xmlformats[.]com as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 21: The document loads HTML upon opening the document\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther investigation of HTML will show the PowerShell code used by the attacker in abusing the ms msdt vulnerability.\n\nFigure 22: Encoded base64 PowerShell\n\nDecoding the base64 will give the readable malicious PowerShell code which is likely the malicious code performs some\nmalicious actions.\n\nFigure 23: Decoded base64 PowerShell\n\nBased on the PowerShell code in the above figure, the code basically:\n\n1. Assign cmd's full path into variable $cmd\n2. Runs the cmd.exe with a hidden window using Start-Process cmdlet\n3. Then it kills the msdt.exe program if it's running on the infected machine\n4. The code use for loops to iterate on each files and folders in %temp% folder to find a RAR file named 05-2022-0438.rar\n5. It moves the RAR file from the %temp% folder to the public user folder and saves it as 1.rar\n6. The code then checks for the MSCF file by checking the file header (TVNDRgAAAA) encoded in base64 in the 1.rar\n\nand saving it as 1.t\n7. The code will decode the 1.t (base64 encoded) file using certutil.exe program and save it as 1.c\n\n\n-----\n\n8. The code will expand the compressed file (1.c) to the current folder and execute rgb.exe residing in the 1.c\n\nThe why question for why the RAR file is being dropped to the %temp% is unknown yet. Our team also cannot able to\nretrieve the RAR file. So, further analysis for the RAR file can't be done.\n\n### 手发机房接单-渠道报价单-全网最低价.docx analysis\n\nMD5: 14aff46aaffbad783974ba819dba6e41\n\nThe second sample that Netbytesec retrieved using hxxp://coolrat[.]xyz as the remote server to serve their malicious HTML\nnamed Loading.html.\n\nFigure 24: The document loads HTML upon opening the document\n\nAnalyzing the HTML file shows that the attacker replaces the AAAA padding with dummy words.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25: malicious HTML\n\nThe attacker replicates the attack by encoding their malicious PowerShell code with base64. Figure below shows the\ndecoded version of the PowerShell.\n\nFigure 26: Decoded PS code\n\nThis time, the malicious code will download an executable residing in the C2 server and save it as temp.exe. The PowerShell\ncode then executes the temp.exe using start-process.\n\n### Employment Agreement.RTF analysis\n\nMD5: 242d2fa02535599dae793e731b6db5a2\n\nThe below picture shows the RTF contains an object referring to the malicious HTML remotely hosted\nat hxxp://45[.]76[.]53.253/1.html.\n\nFigure 27: HTML payload in the object control word\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third sample uses the classic AAAA padding in the HTML file like the famous one from Nao_sec and the payload msdt\nscheme's structure looks the same. The final payload of this sample will steal the user's system information and login data.\nThe figure below shows the malicious HTML file used for the Follina exploitation.\n\nFigure 28: HTML payload\n\nThe attacker crafting the PowerShell payload with the base64 encoding which likely needs to decode to understand the\nmalicious code. Base64 decoded version of the payload as shown below:\n\nFigure 29: decoded payload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious PowerShell code firstly will get a process name msdt that is running on the local computer using the Get_Process cmdlet and terminate the process using the Stop-Process cmdlet. Next, the malicious code download and execute_\nanother PowerShell payload from their C2 server seller-notification[.]live which is what we call fileless execution. The\nmalicious PowerShell code will run in memory without touching the disk.\nRetrieve the PowerShell script in the URL revealing the payload will try to collect the infected machine's information,\ncompress it into a ZIP file and upload the ZIP to their another C2 server at 45[.]77.156[.]179 on port 443. Figure 30 - 31\nshows the content of the Zgfbe234dg code.\n\nFigure 30: Lines 1 - 40\n\nFigure 31: lines 41 -76\n\nThe code collect login data and information from browsers such as Firefox, email applications such as Outlook, SSH client\napplications, FTP clients, and remote desktop applications. It appears also that malware collect system information by\nrunning commands such as system info, ipconfig, and many more. In the last part of the code, the malware will compress all\n\n\n-----\n\nthe collected files and data and save them as a ZIP file. The ZIP file will be uploaded to the attacker s remote server served\nat 45[.]77.156[.]179 on port 443.\n\n### Other samples analysis\n\nAll the remote servers for the available samples seem down when uploaded to the Virus Total. Thus, the Netbytesec team\nnot able to do further analysis of the HTML.\nThe list below shows the malicious remote HTML serves by each of the other samples.\n\nCSAFP'S_GUIDANCE_RE_NATIONAL_AND_LOCAL_ELECTION_2022_NLE.docx\n= hxxp://141[.]98[.]215[.]99/color.html\nприглашение на интервью.doc = hxxps://www[.]sputnikradio[.]net/radio/news/3134.html\nРЭТ-ЮМ-3044 от 12.04.2022.doc = hxxps://www[.]sputnikradio[.]net/radio/news/1134.html\nExposing_Sonish_Liar!!!.doc = hxxps://exchange[.]oufca[.]com.au/owa/auth/15.1.2375/themes/p3azx.html\n\n## Detection\n\nIn terms of detection perspective, the malicious code is loaded from the remote component in the attacker's server, thus the\ndocument does not embed any malicious code in the files which will make detection a little bit harder as the malicious code is\nin the HTML file remotely serve on the internet instead of in the document like the Macro attack.\n\nThe YARA rule below can be use to detects the malicious document.\n```\nrule Follina_msdt_maldoc_DOC_XML_Rels {\n\n  meta:\n\n    description = \"Detects for DOC and DOCX's Follina sample based on document.xml.rels file.

Run Command Prompt as Administrator.\n2. To back up the registry key, execute the command “reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt any_filename“\n3. Execute the command “reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt /f”.\n\nFigure 34: Backup and delete ms-msdt key\n\nMicrosoft also advises that \"customers with Microsoft Defender Antivirus should turn on cloud-delivered protection and\n**automatic sample submission. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and**\nstop new and unknown threats.\"\n\nAlso, people are advised to disable the preview pane in Windows Explorer to avoid such an attack regarding the preview\npane attack vector.\nCompanies and organizations should be aware of users and their employees to be careful and stay alert when opening or\n**receiving a document from an untrusted source. Identifying, detecting, and deleting malicious emails or attachments is**\nthe best thing we can do to defend against this threat until Microsoft release the official patch for this vulnerability.\n\nNetbytesec team also recommended user use Anti-Virus or any security solution to minimize and detects this type of\nattack in their environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNetbytesec team concludes that the vulnerability or Follina attack is critical as the exploit is able to execute arbitrary code\nspecifically malicious code in the perspective of security concern. The attack abuses the ms-msdt scheme to make the\nexploit work by delivering the attack vector via Microsoft Office documents format including DOC, DOCX, and RTF. Upon\nopening the malicious document, victims will completely be infected by the malicious code as the PowerShell code will be run\nin the background without the user's concern. The Follina has a zero-click attack if the attacker saves the document as RTF.\nThe zero-click attack is triggered when victims enable the preview pane in their Windows machine and preview the malicious\nRTF via the preview pane. The attack is easy to replicate and reproduce. Thus, this type of attack will be seen a lot in the\nwild after this.\n\n## Indicator of Compromie (IOCs)\n\n### Samples' MD5 hashes\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **MD5 hash**\n\nCSAFP'S_GUIDANCE_RE_NATIONAL_AND_LOCAL_ELECTION_2022_NLE.docx 8ee8fe6f0226e346e224cd72c728157c\n\nРЭТ-ЮМ-3044 от 12.04.2022.doc 6bcee92ab337c9130f27143cc7be5a55\n\nприглашение на интервью.doc f531a7c270d43656e34d578c8e71bc39\n\n05-2022-0438.doc 52945af1def85b171870b31fa4782e52\n\n手发机房接单-渠道报价单-全网最低价.docx 14aff46aaffbad783974ba819dba6e41\n\nExposing_Sonish_Liar!!!.doc 529c8f3d6d02ba996357aba535f688fc\n\nEmployment Agreement 242d2fa02535599dae793e731b6db5a2\n\n### Command and Control Server\n\n141[.]98[.]215[.]99\nwww[.]sputnikradio[.]net\nwww[.]xmlformats[.]com\ncoolrat[.]xyz\ntibet-gov[.]web[.]app\nexchange[.]oufca[.]com.[]au\n45[.]76[.]53.253\n45[.]77.156[.]179\nseller-notification[.]live\n\n## Reference and further reading\n\n1. https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e\n2. https://www.huntress.com/blog/microsoft-office-remote-code-execution-follina-msdt-bug\n3. https://gist.github.com/tothi/66290a42896a97920055e50128c9f040\n\n\n-----",
