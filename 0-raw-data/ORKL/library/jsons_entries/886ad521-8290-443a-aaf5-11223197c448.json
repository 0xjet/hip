The news site said that during the past week, the security teams at several, yet\nunnamed, Polish banks detected downloads of suspicious files and encrypted traffic going\nto uncommon IPs situated in many foreign countries.\n\nAs employees at different banks started looking into their systems, they found malware\ninstalled on numerous workstations and even some servers.\n\n## KNF website hosted malicious JavaScript file\n\nSubsequent investigations and a cooperation between different banks eventually\ndiscovered the source of the infection as being the official website of KNF, which, ironically,\nis the regulating body that keeps an eye out for the security of financial systems in Poland.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to reports, KNF s website had been compromised for well over a week, as an\nunidentified attacker had modified one of the site's JavaScript files.\n\n**KNF website (via: Zaufana Trzecia Strona)**\nVisitors accessing the KNF website would load the malicious JavaScript file as part of the\nwebsite's regular resources.\n\n## JavaScript file would lead to RAT infection\n\nThe JavaScript code worked by opening a hidden iframe and forcibly downloading a file on\nthe victim's computers. Users that discovered and executed this file would install a remote\naccess trojan (RAT) on their computers.\n\nAccording to Zaufana Trzecia Strona, this malware has a zero detection rate on VirusTotal\nand appears to be a new malware strain, never-before-seen in live attacks.\n\nKNF's staff have cleaned their site and along with the affected banks, have reported the\n[incidents to CERT.pl. They also released a statement acknowledging the website hack on](http://www.cashless.pl/wiadomosci/bezpieczenstwo/2243-knf-zrodlem-cyberinfekcji-sektora-finansowego-bankowcy-uspokajaja-pieniadze-klientow-sa-bezpieczne)\nFriday, but haven't provided other details about the attack.\n\nThe affected Polish banks said the malware that infected their computers and servers\nencrypted its outgoing traffic and they weren't able to tell what the attackers stole.\n\n## No customer funds stolen\n\nBanks reassured their clients and said they haven't detected any unauthorized transactions,\nbut only the mysterious outgoing traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Local media believes the attack is the work of a foreign intelligence agency. A more](http://www.money.pl/gospodarka/wiadomosci/artykul/atak-na-banki-hakerzy-abw-wlamania-do-bankow,220,0,2256604.html)\nbelievable theory would be that this is the work of one of the many cyber-crime syndicates\nspecialized in cyber-thefts from financial institutions.\n\nThe attacks have the signs of classic network reconnaissance operations, where hackers\ngather intelligence in order to create a map of a victim's network before launching their final\nassaults.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Popular Python and PHP libraries hijacked to steal AWS keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-python-and-php-libraries-hijacked-to-steal-aws-keys/)\n\n[Microsoft: Credit card stealers are getting much stealthier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-credit-card-stealers-are-getting-much-stealthier/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Bank](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bank/)\n[JavaScript](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/javascript/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Poland](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/poland/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
