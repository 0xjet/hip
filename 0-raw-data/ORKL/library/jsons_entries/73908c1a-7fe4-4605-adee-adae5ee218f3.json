As its history illustrates, the criminals behind Emotet malware_\nare cunning and quick to maximize its ‘potential.' From a basic banking\nTrojan to a threat distribution service, it is constantly being re-invented.\nThis ‘constant malware improvement’ isn’t showing any sign of abating.\nRecently the Spamhaus Malware Labs team have identified further\nunsettling changes in Emotet.\n\n**Emotet - what is it?**\n\nAs previously mentioned, this malware came to the fore as a basic selfpropagating banking Trojan in 2014. However, over the past 5 years\nthe creators of this malware have taken the most successful facets of\nother disruptive software and created a modular malware family that\ncan evade detection, spread like wildfire across a network and deliver\nmultiple payloads.\n\n[Only a year ago Allentown, USA, hit the news headlines after](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/allentown-struggles-with-1-million/)\nbecoming infected with Emotet. The remediation costs were reported\nto be in the region of US $1million.\n\n**Emotet - the data**\n\nIn the last two months alone, the researchers at Spamhaus Malware\nLabs have tracked approximately 47,000 Emotet infected machines\nemitting around 6,000 distinct URLs to compromised websites serving\nas infection vectors. This makes Emotet the most actively distributed\nmalware at the moment, accounting for almost 45% the total number of\nURLs used for this purpose.\n\nThere is no sign that the numbers associated with Emotet will decline\nover the forthcoming months, particularly given a recent discovery that\nwill make Emotet even more difficult to detect.\n\n**Emotet HTTP advancement**\n\n\n-----\n\nSpammer Abuse\n[of Free Google](https://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/814/spammer-abuse-of-free-google-services)\nServices\n\nSpamhaus\nBotnet Threat\nUpdate: Q22021\n\nEmotet Email\nAftermath\n\nWordpress\ncompromises:\nWhat's beyond\nthe URL?\n\nYou can't buy\ndata hygiene\n\nOlder News\nArticles:\n\nSpamhaus News\nINDEX\n\n\n**HTTP Headers Previously, Emotet built moderately primitive HTTP**\npackets. The fact they were primitive was a good thing; these HTTP\npackets didn’t follow the standard protocol for either the type of data or\nhow the data was sent. This made them easy to detect using a static\nsignature on network traffic.\n\n_Emotet HTTP packet_\nUnfortunately, these HTTP packets have become increasingly\nsophisticated: now they predominantly follow the RFC (Request for\nComments) specifications of the HTTP protocol. These additional\ndetails in Emotet's HTTP headers give the appearance of coming from\na legitimate request, e.g., a browser or other application. As a result, a\nstatic signature on network traffic won’t detect them, which is far from\nideal.\n\n_Adding HTTP headers_\n**Uniform Resource Identifier inclusion - Not only do we have the**\naddition of these extra headers (as illustrated above), but Emotet has\nalso started to include a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). In the past,\na URI was missing, but now it is randomizing between two different\nwords. The URI randomly generates from a list of hardcoded comma\nseparated words, as you can see in the example below.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Emotet’s HTTP headers have changed the\nlayer below, i.e., the custom protocol remains unchanged, as this\nimage illustrates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Protect yourself**\n\nThe creators of Emotet have been savvy, and while nothing they have\ndone is rocket science, there is clear evidence that they have a strong\ndesire to make this malware more evasive and bulletproof. Which in\nturn means that you need to have bulletproof security.\n\n\n-----",
