This source’s commentary forms_\n_the basis for the background on the genesis of Iran’s offensive cyber efforts._\n_Additional research was facilitated with Recorded Future and by leveraging third-_\n_party metadata and open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques using a variety_\n_of tools. While we address historical background and precedent in the piece, the_\n_technical analysis regarding organizations and institutes in Iran’s offensive cyber_\n_program is based on data collected from March 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nSince at least 2009, the Islamic Republic of Iran has regularly responded\nto sanctions or perceived provocations by conducting offensive cyber\ncampaigns. The Islamic Republic has historically preferred to use proxies\nor front organizations both in physical conflict — Hezbollah against Israel\n[and Yemen rebels against Saudi Arabia — and cyberattacks to achieve their](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-saudi-cyber-conflict/)\npolicy goals.\n\nCurrently, Iran faces the prospect of negative economic impact via renewed\n[sanctions. On May 8, 2018 President Trump announced that the United](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html)\n[States would not](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/donald-trump-iran-deal-announcement-decision/index.html) [renew the waivers on sanctions against Iran. The U.S will](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa/trump-has-all-but-decided-to-withdraw-from-iran-nuclear-deal-sources-idUSKBN1I331R)\ninstead impose additional economic penalties, the combination of which\n[amounts to a de facto U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/)\n[Plan of Action (JCPOA) (commonly referred to as the “Iran nuclear deal”.](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/)\n\nWe assess, based on Iran’s previous reactions to economic pressure, that\nwith President Trump’s exit from the JCPOA, Iran is likely to respond by\nlaunching cyberattacks on Western businesses within months, if not faster.\nJudging from historical patterns, the businesses likely to be at greatest risk\nare in many of the same sectors that were victimized by Iranian cyberattacks\nbetween 2012 and 2014 and include banks and financial services,\ngovernment departments, critical infrastructure providers, and oil and\nenergy.\n\n##### Key Judgments\n\n    - The Islamic Republic has abandoned its typically deliberate and\nmethodical approach to cyber operations on only two known\noccasions, in 2012 and in 2014, when a quick reactionary response\nwas required. We assess that when Iranian cyber operators\nrespond to the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA that the operations\nwill be staffed and executed by capable, but less trusted\ncontractors.\n\n    - Further, we assess that staffing these operations with less trusted\ncontractors could result in a scenario where the Islamic Republic\nhas difficulty controlling the scope and scale of the destructive\ncyberattacks once they have begun.\n\n\n-----\n\n    - Iranian cyber operations are administered via a tiered approach,\nwhere an ideologically and politically trusted group of middle\nmanagers translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber\ntasks which are then bid out to multiple contractors. This creates\na quasi-capitalistic system that pits contractors against each other\nfor influence with the Iranian government.\n\n    - The Islamic Republic operates with embedded paranoia, where\nultimately, no one can be trusted. The situation creates unique\ntrade-offs in Iran’s government-sanctioned offensive cyber\ncampaigns; individuals with demonstrated adherence to the\ngovernment’s ideology and individuals with the greatest offensive\ncyber skills are almost always mutually exclusive.\n\n    - Based on our source’s conversations with other hackers in\nIran, there are over 50 estimated contractors vying for Iranian\ngovernment-sponsored offensive cyber projects. Only the best\nindividuals or teams succeed, are paid, and remain in business.\n\n    - Insikt Group analyzed internet traffic relating to various institutes\naffiliated with the Iranian cyber ecosystem from March 1, 2018 to\nApril 30, 2018. As this is the first profiling of Iranian internet activity\nfor these institutes, we cannot determine whether the suspicious\nactivity we analyzed was in preparation of the U.S. announcement.\n\n    - According to Insikt Group’s source, to find and retain the best\noffensive cyber talent, Iranian government contractors are forced\nto mine closed-trust communities. The links between the forums\nand contractors may illustrate that the trust communities begin\nwith the Iranian security forums.\n\n##### The History of Iranian Geopolitical Response and the Nuclear Agreement Decision\n\n_Editor’s Note: Where applicable, information in this section was provided by a_\n_former Iranian hacker with direct access to the information provided.

Subsequent to\nstarting a cyber operations program in 2009, the Iranian government had an\nimmediate need to use the program in the fall of 2012 after U.S. President\n[Obama imposed severe financial sanctions on Iran, including removing Iran](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-sanctions-swift/bankings-swift-says-ready-to-block-iran-transactions-idUSTRE81G26820120217)\n[from the SWIFT money transfer system.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-sanctions-swift/bankings-swift-says-ready-to-block-iran-transactions-idUSTRE81G26820120217)\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Insikt Group’s source, the Iranian government authorized\ndenial-of-service attacks on America’s largest financial services companies\nas an immediate response to the sanctions in a campaign dubbed\n[Operation Ababil. A quick response was top priority, so time and planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ababil)\nwere forgone luxuries for the Iranian government. Instead, the Iranian\ngovernment opted for speed and the most capable actors, regardless of\ndemonstrated ideology.\n\nSimilarly, a year later in the fall of 2013, Sheldon Adelson (the CEO of Sands\n[Corporation) publicly suggested that the United States should attack Iran](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/sheldon-adelson-has-idea-lob-nuclear-bomb-iranian-desert/309657/)\n[with an atomic weapon. In February 2014, Iran launched a destructive](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/sheldon-adelson-has-idea-lob-nuclear-bomb-iranian-desert/309657/)\n[attack on the Sands Las Vegas Corporation that caused significant network](http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/27/technology/security/iran-hack-casino/index.html)\ndamage. This was the second public Iranian attack campaign on an\nAmerican business, where the response called for speed over time and\npreparation.\n\nThe Iranian attacks in 2012 and 2014 were in contrast to the relatively slow\nand methodical work of APT 33, APT 34, and APT 35, developing custom\nmalware, targeting data exfiltration from strategic intelligence targets such\n[as U.S. military contractors, Middle East energy companies, and university](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/silent-librarian-more-to-the-story-of-the-iranian-mabna-institute-indictment)\n[research networks.](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/silent-librarian-more-to-the-story-of-the-iranian-mabna-institute-indictment)\n\n_Comparing Iranian campaigns — methodical versus reactionary._\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Building a National Capability — History and Relationships Between Proxies\n\nThe Iranian Revolution replaced the Persian monarchy and transitioned the\nShah’s power to the Islamic Republic, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n[Loyalty to the resulting theocracy was defined by alignment to the Supreme](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/24/what-erdogan-and-khomeini-have-in-common-turkey-coup-iran/)\n[Leader’s moral precepts.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/24/what-erdogan-and-khomeini-have-in-common-turkey-coup-iran/)\n\nThe new leaders of Iran also established an intelligence and security\n[organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), “charged with](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/irans-revolutionary-guards)\ndefending the Islamic Republic against internal and external threats.”\nCurrently, the IRGC is Iran’s premier security organization and possesses an\narmy, navy, and air force, and manages “Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal and\nirregular warfare operations through its elite Quds Force and proxies such\nas Hezbollah.”\n\n[The IRGC has a vast domestic information security and monitoring mandate,](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/irans-revolutionary-guards)\n[as well as broad foreign mission, and has been linked to cyberattacks](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/irans-revolutionary-guards-corps-inc)\nagainst Western institutions since at least 2011.\n\nAccording to Insikt Group’s source, during the 2009 Green Revolution,\nGerdab.ir emerged as the IRGC’s domestic hacking group tasked with\ntargeting opposition news websites and individuals considered immoral\nby the regime. Iranian hackers targeting Iranian government resources\n(one example was defacing Khamanei.ir) were identified by Gerdab and\nimprisoned. Gerdab continues to act as the Iranian government’s internal\ncensor.\n\nFollowing the Green Revolution, the Iranian government considered adding\na formal offensive cyber component to its existing intelligence apparatus,\nand was forced to address a personnel problem. Iran needed a talented,\n[but politically and religiously reliable workforce. Stuxnet and scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)\n[assassinations reminded Iran of the efficacy of Mossad and CIA programs,](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/05/israel-assassination-iranian-scientists-217223)\nand according to Insikt Group’s source, fervent religious ideology was the\nonly way to demonstrate loyalty and build trust.\n\n[The emergence of the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA) as an extension of the IRGC](http://www.newsweek.com/irans-cyber-warfare-program-now-major-threat-united-states-745427)\nwas an initial attempt by the Islamic Republic at conducting internationally\nfocused operations. These operations were a departure from Gerdab’s\nfocus on maintaining domestic moral values and defending government\nrhetoric. In 2011, the IRGC’s ICA formed the foundation of the Khaybar\n[Center for Information Technology. According to a former IRGC cyber](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/01/15/Secrets-and-activities-of-Iran-s-electronic-army.html)\n[commander, the Khaybar Center was established in 2011 and has been](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/01/15/Secrets-and-activities-of-Iran-s-electronic-army.html)\nlinked to a number of attacks against the United States, Saudi Arabia, and\nTurkey.\n\nEven today, the balance between ideology and cyber skills remains\nproblematic. One example of the conflict between ideology and skill was\n[Mohammad Hussein Tajik, a former cyber commander within the IRGC.](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/12/05/Iran-creates-electronic-Brigades-for-cyber-war.html)\nAccording to Insikt Group’s source, Tajik’s father maintained a strong\nreligious background and was a veteran of Iran’s ministry of intelligence. Yet\n[Tajik was arrested and killed because the Iranian government feared that](https://web.archive.org/web/20170118050038/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/370899)\nTajik was not ideologically aligned and posed a betrayal and flight risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Following the Green Revolution, Iran’s government needed to quickly](https://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/iranreport.pdf)\nimprove its cyber capabilities, but according to Insikt Group’s source, the\ntalent was primarily young and focused on financial benefits. This motivation\nbred government mistrust, as the Islamic Republic feared that the financially\nmotivated could be bought by foreign intelligence services. Additionally,\nmany of the original Iranian hackers responsible for mass defacements\nhated authority and lacked the discipline necessary for government work.\n\nAccording to Insikt Group’s source, the government answer was a tiered\napproach, with a network of people unofficially associated with the\nIRGC and Iranian government — a type of ideologically aligned middle\nmanagement — that were loyal to the regime and demonstrated sufficient\nreligious commitment. This middle tier translated intelligence priorities into\nsegmented cyber tasks which were then bid out to multiple contractors.\nSometimes the contractors would compete with each other, sometimes\nthey would work together, but payment was only made once the objective\nwas completed. The result was (and presently remains) a quasi-capitalistic\nsystem that pitted contractors against each other for influence with the\nIranian government.\n\nIn the Islamic Republic, influence can lead to security and wealth, but it can\nalso lead to a false sense of security (no one is above being imprisoned\nand questioned at any given time). Thus, contractors must learn to play the\ngame — enough surface-level adherence to the regime’s ideology — to gain\ntemporary reprieves from suspicion long enough to be given contracted\nwork. To the Iranian government, ideology is more important than skills.\nDeep belief in the Ayatollah’s precepts and the government’s goals helps to\navoid defections and traitors.\n\n_Obfuscating Iranian government involvement in offensive campaigns._\n\n\n-----\n\nToday, based on ongoing contact between Insikt Group’s source and\nIranian hackers, it is estimated that there are over 50 organizations vying\nfor government-sponsored offensive cyber projects. Only the best teams\nsucceed, are paid, and remain in business. The government does its best to\ncompartmentalize — one job might be creating a remote code exploit (RCE)\nfor a popular software application, while another job might be using the RCE\nand establishing persistent unauthorized access. Two different contractors\n(or more) are typically required to complete the government-defined\nobjective.\n\nPublic knowledge has also established that Iranian academic institutions\n[play a contractor-like role. Specific examples include Shahid Beheshti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Beheshti_University)\n[University (SBU) and the Imam Hossein University (IHU), which have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Beheshti_University)\ncomprehensive science and technology departments attracting some of\n[the best academic talent in Iran. In fact, the SBU has a specific cyberspace](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/sitepages/home.aspx)\n[research institute dedicated to such matters, and the IHU was founded by](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/Research_Institutes/CyberspaceResearch/Pages/default.aspx)\n[the IRGC.](https://www.iranwatch.org/iranian-entities/imam-hussein-university-revolutionary-guards)\n\n[As the Mabna Institute indictments highlight, despite the lifting of sanctions](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/iranian-mabna-hackers)\nand an appetite to re-engage with the international community, Iran has\ncontinued a subversive and aggressive global cyber operations campaign.\nThis ongoing campaign, which targets universities for scientific and\ntechnological intellectual property theft, demonstrates a fundamental lack\n[of trust in the international agreements, including the Joint Comprehensive](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/)\n[Plan of Action (JCPOA).](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/)\n\n##### Relationship Between the Iranian Government, Contractors, and Security Forums\n\n[Clearsky, FireEye, Symantec, and PhishLabs have all performed significant](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Charming_Kitten_2017.pdf)\nresearch on Iranian nation-state-sponsored campaigns that provide\nhistorical insight into technical capabilities and relationships between the\nIranian government and contractors.\n\n[The work of the aforementioned security companies and recent U.S.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download)\n[Department of Justice indictments provides consistent evidence that Iranian](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download)\ngovernment-sponsored offensive campaigns are executed by contractors.\n\n[FireEye disclosed that the Nasr Institute was an APT 33 contractor in](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)\nan operation that used publicly available backdoors and remote access\ntrojans.

First,\n[FireEye referenced the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell in APT33 spear](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)\n[phishing email campaigns.

Further, Hossein Asgari, a self-proclaimed Iranian hacker,](http://hackingscripts.com/simattacker-shell/)\nmanaged the Simorgh forum and worked with his father, who was employed\nby the IRGC.\n\n_[Source: http://hackingscripts.com/simattacker-shell/](http://hackingscripts.com/simattacker-shell/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Zone-h captured website defacements committed by Hossein Asgari_\n\n_[Source: http://www.zone-h.org/mirror/id/4479919](http://www.zone-h.org/mirror/id/4479919)_\n\nAccording to Insikt Group’s source, to find and retain the best offensive\ncyber talent, Iranian government contractors are forced to mine closed-trust\ncommunities. The links between the forums and contractors may illustrate\nthat the trust communities begin with the Iranian security forums.\n\n##### Analyzing Iranian Cyber Institute Internet Traffic \n\nInsikt Group analyzed internet traffic relating to various institutes affiliated\nwith the Iranian cyber ecosystem from March 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018. Our\ngoal was to determine whether any of these institutes had forecasted Iran’s\nintentions in cyberspace leading up to the U.S. decision to withdraw from\nthe 2015 JCPOA.\n\nThis is Insikt Group’s first profiling of internet activity for Iranian cyber\ninstitutes. While we cannot assess whether this level of activity is typical\nor not, monitoring it over time to determine changes in response to\ninternational pressure could be revealing.\n\n_Cyberspace Research Institute of Iran_\n\nIran’s Cyberspace Research Institute (CSRI) is a research center affiliated\nwith the prestigious Shahid Beheshti University in Iran. The institute\ncommands a significant proportion of the university’s allocated IP space,\nwith no fewer than eight /24 IP ranges registered to the CSRI in Iran,\naccording to regional RIPE NCC records.

These exchanges involved the transfer of a large\nvolume of data between the two networks. The Spanish networks resolved\nto departments supporting the digital transformation of Spanish public\nservices and multi-disciplined universities. Direct network connectivity\nbetween the Iranian and Spanish institutions demonstrates that they either\nhave a deep academic relationship and are sharing data with one another,\nor the large transfer of data from the Spanish institutes is unwarranted.\nIt is unlikely that CSRI would have a valid business interest with Spanish\ngovernment departments, so the large volume of data transferred between\nthe two networks over such a short period of time is a conspicuous\nindicator of possibly malicious activity.\n\nThroughout April, Iran’s CSRI simultaneously demonstrated an increased\ninterest in the Philippine Department of Science & Technology (DOST).\nSimilar to the Spanish network interactions, very large data volumes were\nexchanged between the two networks, denoting strong interest.\n\nThis level of engagement and interaction, particularly in light of the\nreduction of sanctions, and the thawing of relations between Iran and\nthe West following the 2015 JCPOA, was expected between academia.\n[In fact, in 2015 and 2017, Philippine and Spanish universities agreed to](http://www.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/home/portal/index.php/quick-information-dispatch/2642-iran-ambassador-visits-pcaarrd)\nexpand scientific cooperation with Iranian institutions. However, given\nCSRI’s background, Iran’s demonstrated interest in using cyber operations\nto steal academic and intellectual property, and our evidence of ongoing\ncampaigns targeting universities for theft worldwide, we assess that this\nactivity between CSRI and these Spanish and Philippine universities may be\nmalicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nCSRI was also observed in a large number of events dispatching the Parsijoo\nbot to crawl websites of interest. According to Wikipedia, Parsijoo.ir is the\nsecond most popular search engine in Iran after Google and it uses the\nParsijoobot to crawl websites for indexing purposes. During our research,\nwe noted repeated crawls of a specialist Canadian-Iranian immigration\n[website, www.itc-canada[.]com, using Parsijoo bot from CSRI IP ranges.](http://itc-canada.com/fa/home.htm)\nThe crawls were observed throughout our data period from early March\ncontinuing right through to the end of April, suggesting a strong, persistent\ninterest in this particular site.\n\nFinally, we identified CSRI interacting with IPs registered to Ravand\nCybertech Inc. Ravand Cybertech offers, via its website ravand[.]com,\ncloud hosting solutions, among other services. Ravand Cybertech has\n[strong ties to the Iranian regime. Historically, it hosted the website of the](https://www.memri.org/reports/iranian-regime-affiliated-websites-and-their-hosts)\nconservative news agency Fars which is affiliated with the Iranian military.\nThe company’s registered IP ranges sit under AS12212 with the following\nprefixes ranged 198.55.48.0 – 198.55.61.255, 198.55.63.0 – 198.55.63.255\nand 207.176.216.0 – 207.176.219.255.\n\nRavand Cybertech hosted a number of domains used by an Iranian\nMinistry of Intelligence Services (MOIS) agent, Massoud Khodabandeh, in\n[a disinformation campaign conducted in Western media. The campaign](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/319141-americans-must-be-wary-of-irans-influence-over-us-media)\nattempted to discredit and demonize the main Iranian opposition party, the\nPeople’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran/Mojahedin-e Khalq (PMOI/MEK).\n[According to an opinion piece written for The Hill, the websites were found](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/319141-americans-must-be-wary-of-irans-influence-over-us-media)\nby the Pentagon to be created by order from Tehran. Ravand Cybertech was\n[identified as being an “Iranian state-run” company, which hosted fake news](http://iranlobby.net/campaign-of-disinformation-by-iran-regime-revealed/)\nsites aimed at disseminating Iranian propaganda to undermine the efforts\nof Iranian-American lobbyists.\n\nBased on the volume of activity observed during our research, we assess\nthe CSRI may be engaged in supporting the malicious disinformation\nactivities of Ravand Cybertech.\n\n_Imam Hossein University (Imam Hussein University)_\n\nThe Imam Hossein Comprehensive University (IHU) is an Iranian university\nbased in Tehran that is affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\n(IRGC), the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, and the\nIranian Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur research focused on the publicly noted IP ranges for the university,\nlisted below:\n\ninetnum_end country mnt-by created\n\nIR AS12880-MNT 2008-12-28T10:20:37Z\n\n78.39.164.167 IR AS12880-MNT 2015-09-05T04:48:32Z\n\n_Source: RIPE NCC database, ripe.net._\n\nDuring our research, we found that IHU was also very interested in Spanish\nhigher educational establishments and specific government departments. In\nfact, two of the same Spanish establishments exchanged high data volumes\nwith the IHU source range IPs.\n\nFurther web browsing activity from IHU ranges was noted to the website\nof a U.S.-based multinational engineering software company, Gamma\nTechnologies. The browsing activity was centered on its GT-SUITE software.\nGamma Technologies specializes in the development of simulation software\nfor a wide variety of worldwide industries, including power generation.\n\n_Mabna Institute_\n\nAs previously detailed, the Mabna Institute was publicly identified in an\n[FBI indictment as a front company engaged in hostile state-sponsored](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/iranian-mabna-hackers)\ncyberespionage on behalf of the Iranian state. Our OSINT research\nidentified a single domain, mabna-ins[.]ir, which could correspond to the\ngroup. The domain was previously hosted on an Iranian IP 5.144.130[.]23\nand since April 22, 2017, points at German VPS IP 144.76.87[.]86. This VPS\nalso hosts over 2,000 other domains, most of which are .ir domains.\n\n|netname|inetnum_start|inetnum_end|country|mnt-by|created|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|IMAMHOSSEINUNI|217.218.175.0|217.218.176.255|IR|AS12880-MNT|2008-12-28T10:20:37Z|\n|IHUO|78.39.164.160|78.39.164.167|IR|AS12880-MNT|2015-09-05T04:48:32Z|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: mabna-ins[.]ir_\n\n##### Intent, Scenarios for Retaliation, and Recommendations\n\n[According to the terms of the JCPOA, Tehran agreed to restrictions on its](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/245317.pdf)\nnuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, various\nprovisions of the accord expire at different times over the next 25 years,\n[with some expiring as soon as 2025.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-france/france-opens-door-to-strengthen-iran-nuclear-deal-for-post-2025-idUSKCN1BT1IY?il=0)\n\n[On May 8, 2018, President Trump decided not to renew the waivers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa/trump-has-all-but-decided-to-withdraw-from-iran-nuclear-deal-sources-idUSKBN1I331R)\nsuspending some U.S. sanctions against Iran and initiated a de facto U.S.\n[withdrawal from the agreement. As a result of this action, we assess that](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pompeo-begins-first-official-foreign-trip-amid-uncertainty-over-iran-deal-1524821386)\nIran will likely respond quickly by launching destructive attacks on American,\nEuropean, and rival nation (countries such as Saudi Arabia and Israel)\nbusinesses.\n\nConversely, Iran may also retaliate (exclusively or in conjunction with\ndestructive attacks) through cyber proxies in more methodical and\nsustained campaigns. Given the impact of re-applied and expanded\neconomic sanctions, it is likely that American, European, and rival nation\nbusinesses will also be targeted with more sustained destructive attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs documented above, when pursuing quick-turn cyber operations, the\nIranian regime will weigh religious and political reliability against offensive\nskills. The best operators are not always the most devout or loyal to\nthe regime and we assess that, in this case, the IRGC may forgo careful\ncontractor selection and planning in an attempt to deliver a destructive\nattack within a short period of time.\n\nFurther, our research indicates that because of the need for a quick\nresponse, the Islamic Republic may utilize contractors that are less politically\nand ideologically reliable (and trusted) and as a result, could be more\ndifficult to control. It is possible that this dynamic could limit the ability of\nthe government to control the scope and scale of these destructive attacks\nonce they are unleashed.\n\nWestern businesses should closely monitor geopolitical events initiated\nby the United States or Europe that affect Iran. As demonstrated above,\nWestern businesses are the logical victims of Iranian retaliation for\nperceived American policy transgressions; specifically businesses in\nfinancial services, government departments, critical infrastructure providers,\nand oil and energy sectors.\n\nIn addition to carefully monitoring Iranian geopolitical developments,\ntracking emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) on Ashiyane,\nspecifically, is wise for any Western commercial threat intelligence program\nto determine the efficacy of existing security controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com\n\n@RecordedFuture\n\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
