The operations have primarily targeted\naudiences in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with anti-North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) narratives, often leveraging website compromises or\nspoofed email accounts to disseminate fabricated content, including falsified\ncorrespondence from military officials.\n\n- We have dubbed this campaign “Ghostwriter,” based on its use of inauthentic\n\npersonas posing as locals, journalists, and analysts within the target countries\nto post articles and op-eds referencing the fabrications as source material to\na core set of third-party websites that publish user-generated content.\n\n- In this report we outline the key tactics, techniques, and procedures we have\n\nobserved used in the Ghostwriter campaign and summarize incidents and\npersonas that we believe are part of the larger activity set. We continue to\ninvestigate multiple other suspected Ghostwriter operations and personas\nthat are not detailed here.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Threat Activity Overview\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence has tied together several information operations\nthat we assess with moderate confidence comprise part of a broader influence\ncampaign, ongoing since at least March 2017, aligned with Russian security\ninterests. The operations have primarily targeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia,\nand Poland with narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s\n(NATO) presence in Eastern Europe, occasionally leveraging other themes such\nas anti-U.S. and COVID-19-related narratives as part of this broader anti-NATO\nagenda. We have dubbed this campaign “Ghostwriter.”\n\nMany, though not all, of the incidents we suspect to be part of the Ghostwriter\ncampaign appear to have leveraged website compromises or spoofed email\naccounts to disseminate fabricated content, including falsified news articles,\nquotes, correspondence and other documents designed to appear as coming\nfrom military officials and political figures in the target countries. This falsified\ncontent has been referenced as source material in articles and op-eds authored\nby at least 14 inauthentic personas posing as locals, journalists, and analysts\nwithin those countries. These articles and op-eds, primarily written in English,\nhave been consistently published to a core set of third-party websites that\nappear to accept user-submitted content, most notably OpEdNews.com,\nBalticWord.com, and the pro-Russian site TheDuran.com, among others, as well\nas to suspected Ghostwriter-affiliated blogs.\n\nSome of these incidents and personas have received public attention from\nresearchers, foreign news outlets, or government entities in Lithuania and\nPoland, but have not been tied to a broader activity set. Others have received\nlittle attention and remain relatively obscure. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has\nindependently discovered several Ghostwriter personas and identified additional\nincidents involving some of those personas previously exposed. We believe\nthe assets and operations discussed in this report are for the first time being\ncollectively tied together and assessed to comprise part of a larger, concerted,\nand ongoing influence campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Who is Conducting This Activity and Why?\n\n\nAt this time, we do not attribute the Ghostwriter campaign\nto a specific actor or group of actors. Instead, we refer to\nGhostwriter as an “activity set,” with various incidents tied\ntogether by overlapping behavioral characteristics and\npersonas, rather than as an actor or group in itself. Our\nmoderate confidence assessment therefore corresponds to\nthe tying of individual incidents, personas, and other assets\nto one another, and thus to the broader activity set, based\non their overlapping behavior and interactions. It appears,\nbased on the limited public information available regarding\nthe website compromises we have tied to Ghostwriter,\nthat the actors behind the campaign are relatively wellresourced, either directly possessing traditional cyber\nthreat capabilities themselves or having ready access to\noperational support from others who do. It is plausible\nthat Ghostwriter operations are conducted by overlapping\nactors or groups that are also behind other influence\ncampaigns or incidents of cyber threat activity.\n\nPromoted Ghostwriter narratives have aligned with\nRussian security interests, primarily seeking to foment\ndistrust of U.S. and NATO troops in Europe by portraying\ntheir presence as aggressive and dangerous to local\npopulations and to undermine military relations between\nNATO members. The narratives have focused heavily on\nNATO military exercises in the region, including Saber\nStrike 2018, ANAKONDA 2018, DEFENDER-Europe 20, and\nIron Wolf 2019. For example, recent Ghostwriter incidents\nhave included allegations that U.S. and NATO forces are\ncontributing to the spread of COVID-19 in Europe. Our\nanalysis of articles published this year by suspected\nGhostwriter personas on TheDuran.com, one of the thirdparty websites frequently leveraged in the campaign,\nidentified the most prevalent themes to be the impact\nof COVID-19 on U.S. and NATO forces, general attempts\nto discredit the U.S. and NATO, and strategic discussion\nfavoring Russia over other world powers. On several\noccasions, news outlets and government agencies in\n\n\nLithuania, Latvia, and Poland have issued public statements\ndeclaring content and narratives promoted as part of what\nwe identify as Ghostwriter to be untrue and have labeled\nthem to be “disinformation” or “fake news.”\n\nOn the surface, some aspects of Ghostwriter operations,\nnotably their occasional use of fabricated official\ndocuments and correspondences, bear resemblance\nto aspects of the ongoing suspected Russian influence\ncampaign referred to as “Secondary Infektion,” which was\nfirst publicly exposed by the Atlantic Council’s Digital\nForensics Research Lab[1] and which we have investigated\nand reported on extensively. However, we treat Ghostwriter\nand Secondary Infektion as two distinct activity sets given\nnotable differences in observed behaviors and tactics\nbetween the two:\n\n- Many Ghostwriter operations have leveraged\n\ncompromised websites, including legitimate news\nwebsites, to publish fabricated content, or used spoofed\nemail accounts to engage in direct outreach and\ndissemination of content to NATO itself and national\norganizations and media outlets in the target countries.\nWe have not, at this time, observed the use of traditional\ncyber threat activity in support of Secondary Infektion\noperations.\n\n- Multiple Ghostwriter operations have involved the\n\ndissemination of articles and narratives by multi-use\ninauthentic personas with developed histories, or single\nuse personas impersonating real individuals or behind\nwhich at least some effort has been made to make them\nappear authentic, on a specific set of core platforms.\nBy contrast, single-use burner accounts are almost\nexclusively used to post Secondary Infektion content\nacross a variety of blogs, forums, and self-publishing\nsites, with little effort put into making the accounts\nappear authentic.\n\n\n1 [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Operation-Secondary-Infektion_English.pdf](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Operation-Secondary-Infektion_English.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n# Operations and Tactics\n\n\nThere is no modal Ghostwriter operation, with different\ncombinations of tactics being employed and the order\nand nature of dissemination often changing from incident\nto incident (Figure 1). In general, however, the first stage\nof a Ghostwriter operation involves the creation of a\nfalsified narrative and, commonly, accompanying fabricated\n“source” documentation such as fabricated quotes\nattributed to government officials, altered images, or\nfalsified official correspondence or other documents such\nas the following:\n\n- Fabricated quotes have formed the basis of false\n\nnarratives pushed by Ghostwriter. For example, a quote\nfalsely attributed to the commander of the NATO eFP\nBattle Group was used to push a narrative that Canadian\nsoldiers stationed in Latvia had been diagnosed with\nCOVID-19, stating “Yes, 21 soldiers have tested positive\nfor the virus. We have taken the necessary security\nmeasures, but not everyone has the same immunity. All\nnecessary measures are being taken. The soldiers are\nisolated.”[2]\n\n- Fabricated documents, including falsified official\n\ncorrespondence, have been used as source material\nfor Ghostwriter narratives. For example, a fabricated\nletter presented as having been authored by NATO\nSecretary General Jens Stoltenberg was disseminated by\nGhostwriter personas to bolster a narrative suggesting\nthat NATO was planning to withdraw from Lithuania in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]\n\nAltered images have been used as evidence to support\nGhostwriter narratives. For example, one incident involved\nthe use of a photoshopped image of a Jewish cemetery\nthat was purported to have been desecrated by German\nsoldiers.[4 ]\n\n\nOne or more dissemination phases then occur, whereby\nvarying combinations and orders of tactics are used to\nspread the false narratives, including placing articles\nand any supporting fabricated documentation onto\ncompromised legitimate websites, using inauthentic\npersonas to post “news” articles and op-eds on regularly\nleveraged third-party sites that appear to accept usersubmitted content, posting articles and content to blog\npages we suspect are directly affiliated with Ghostwriter,\nand direct email dissemination of content and articles,\nincluding to legitimate media outlets and government\nofficials.\n\n- Multiple Ghostwriter operations appear to have\n\nleveraged compromised websites, predominantly those\nof news outlets, to post fabricated news articles or\ndocumentation. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has not\nindependently confirmed these compromises and is\nrelying on reporting by government entities and media\noutlets in the target countries. In some cases, only the\npurported victim entity itself has publicly claimed to\nhave been compromised. However, in many cases we also\nlocated archived copies of Ghostwriter articles posted\nto the suspected compromised sites (Table 1). Public\nreporting suggests that in at least some of these cases,\nthe fabricated articles were published using the sites’\ncontent management systems (CMS) after obtaining\nuser credentials.[5] Furthermore, it appears that rather\nthan creating new CMS entries, the actors may have\nreplaced existing legitimate articles on the sites with the\nfabrications.[6]\n\n\n[2 https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/artis-pabriks-attempts-attack-information-space-deceptive-messages-are-sign-potential](https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/artis-pabriks-attempts-attack-information-space-deceptive-messages-are-sign-potential)\n\n\n-----\n\n     - In September 2019, for example, the local\nLithuanian news site kaunas.kasvyksta.lt was\nreportedly compromised, and a false article\npublished claiming that German soldiers had\ndesecrated a Jewish Cemetery in Kaunas.[7 ]We\nindependently observed an archived version of\nthat article having been posted to the site.[8]\n\n     - One of the few non-news site compromises\ninvolved the April 2020 compromise of the\nPolish War Studies Academy website, on which\na fabricated letter presented as having been\nauthored by the Commander of the Academy\neffectively called for Polish troops to fight\nagainst “the American Occupation,” a reference\nto the NATO exercise DEFENDER-Europe 20.[9]\n\n- Inauthentic Ghostwriter personas post fabricated news\n\narticles and op-eds that push the falsified narratives and\nreference the fabricated source materials. These articles\nhave primarily been published in English on a small\ncore of sites that appear to allow for the submission of\nuser-generated content, most notably OpEdNews.com,\nBalticWord.com, and the pro-Russia site TheDuran.com,\nas well as occasionally on one of more than a dozen\nother websites and platforms we have observed used by\nGhostwriter personas. Such articles also often reference\nthe articles or materials posted on the compromised\nlegitimate sites.\n\n     - For example, an article titled “US official had\nno mercy for Polish soldiers!” authored by the\npersona “Rod Renny” and posted to TheDuran.\ncom, directly referenced a falsified interview\nposted to several reportedly compromised Polish\nmedia sites.[10]\n\n\n\n- On several occasions, Ghostwriter narratives and articles\n\nhave been directly disseminated over email, notably to\nlegitimate news organizations and government officials\nin Lithuania and Poland, as well as NATO officials. Our\nanalysis of public reporting on individual incidents\nsuggests that in the majority of cases this direct email\noutreach has been done using spoofed email addresses\npresented as coming from various individuals, including\ngovernment and military officials and journalists. For\nexample, an email presenting as coming from a staffer at\nthe Lithuanian media outlet delfi.lt was reportedly sent\nto various other media outlets in Lithuania and promoted\nthe narrative that U.S. soldiers had been involved in a\ncarjacking in that country.[11]\n\n- Articles promoting Ghostwriter narratives have also been\n\nposted to various blogs and pages on Wix, Blogspot, and\nWordpress that we suspect to be Ghostwriter-controlled.\nFor example, an article published on WordPress\npromoted a false claim that a U.S. Army officer serving in\nLithuania had contracted COVID-19 and then interacted\nwith the local population.[12 13]\n\n- In some instances, we have observed further\n\namplification of fabricated Ghostwriter articles on social\nmedia by suspected inauthentic personas, though this is\nnot a primary vector of dissemination in the campaign.\n\n\n[7  https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/12/russian-trolls-are-hammering-away-natos-presence-lithuania/161654/](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/12/russian-trolls-are-hammering-away-natos-presence-lithuania/161654/)\n[8  http://archive.is/EvGY3#selection-2335.0-2335.20](http://archive.is/EvGY3#selection-2335.0-2335.20)\n[9  https://www.gov.pl/web/sluzby-specjalne/atak-dezinformacyjny-na-polske](https://www.gov.pl/web/sluzby-specjalne/atak-dezinformacyjny-na-polske)\n[10  https://theduran.com/us-official-had-no-mercy-for-polish-soldiers/](https://theduran.com/us-official-had-no-mercy-for-polish-soldiers/)\n[11  https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/demaskuok/sukciai-platina-melaginga-naujiena-apie-vilniuje-nusikaltusius-jav-karius.d?id=83091211fi](https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/demaskuok/sukciai-platina-melaginga-naujiena-apie-vilniuje-nusikaltusius-jav-karius.d?id=83091211)\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1 and Figure 2 below summarize and provide a timeline of fourteen incidents we have tied to Ghostwriter.

1. Continued.**\n\n\n-----\n\n# Inauthentic Personas\n\n\nMultiple indicators suggest that at least\n14 suspected Ghostwriter personas have\npublished articles promoting narratives\ncorresponding with at least 15 suspected\nGhostwriter operations since 2017 (Table\n2). We have observed at least six of these\npersonas leveraged in multiple Ghostwriter\noperations. The vast majority of the\npersonas use either Baltic- or Englishsounding names, some of which are\ninconsistent with their supposed identity or\notherwise raise suspicions. Many claim to\nbe locals, journalists, or editors of the target\ncountries in biographies they have listed on\nsites to which they contribute content.\n\nWe have observed indicators of\ncoordination between some of the\npersonas. For example, multiple identified\npersonas have “upvoted” one another’s\narticles on TheDuran.com but have not\nupvoted any other content on the site. For\ninstance, “Rod Renny” upvoted articles from\nBelit Onay and “jonaskatinelis.” We have\nalso observed multiple personas publish\narticles as part of the same operation(s).\nFor instance, both Belit Onay and Rod\nRenny published falsified articles regarding\nthe alleged transportation of American\nnuclear weapons from Turkey to Poland and\nGermany. “Vilius Petkauskas” and “Jonas\nKatinelis” both published falsified articles\nalleging that NATO was withdrawing its\ntroops from Lithuania. In late April, “Vairis\nGodmanis” and Edgars Palladis published\nsimilar articles that included the same\nfabricated quote falsely attributed to a\nCanadian military officer alleging that\naround 20 Canadian soldiers in Latvia were\ndiagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n\n**Figure 1. The Rod Renny persona upvoted articles from two other suspected**\npersonas, Belit Onay and jonaskatinelis. Two of the upvoted articles pertain to\nrecent operations in which fabricated documents were disseminated through\ncompromised websites.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 2 below lists 14 of the Ghostwriter personas we have identified. As mentioned previously, we have identified\nnumerous other personas not detailed here that we believe to be Ghostwriter-related and are continuing to investigate.\n\n**Table 2.**\n\nFourteen identified Ghostwriter author personas primarily publish on a core set of “news” sites, including opednews.com, balticword.eu,\nand theduran.com\n\n**Single or Multi-** **Published** **Published** **Published**\n\n**Self-listed Bio as**\n**Persona** **Operational** **on** **on** **on**\n**listed on OpEdNews**\n\n**Use** **TheDuran?** **OpEdNews** **BalticWord**\n\nAl Peterson n/a Single-Use\n\nAntanaitis\n\nn/a Single-Use\nJustinas\n\nTheBalticWord n/a Multi-Use\n\nBelit Onay “Goodman” Multi-Use\n\nEdgars Palladis n/a Multi-Use\n\n“I was born in Lithuania.

While the operations so far have targeted audiences in\nthis limited set of countries, we caution that the same tactics employed in the\nGhostwriter campaign can be readily repurposed and used against other target\ngeographies. Given the established history of cyber threat and information\noperations tactics regularly migrating from targeting Eastern Europe to\ntargeting Western Europe and the U.S., this campaign may warrant special\nattention, especially as elections near.\n\n#### To learn more about FireEye, visit: www.FireEye.com\n\n**FireEye, Inc.** **About Mandiant Solutions**\n601 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 Mandiant Solutions brings together the world’s leading\n408.321.6300/877.FIREEYE (347.3393) threat intelligence and frontline expertise with continuous\ninfo@FireEye.com security validation to arm organizations with the tools\n\nneeded to increase security effectiveness and reduce\n©2020 FireEye, Inc.
