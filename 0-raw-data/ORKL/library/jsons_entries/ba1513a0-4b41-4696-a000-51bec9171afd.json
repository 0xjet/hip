Growth in attacks has slowed after a rapid ascent in the\n\nfirst two quarters of the year. Targeted attacks have increased, from 63 to 70\n\npercent.\n\n� Ransomware is hitting companies with increasing frequency. In Q2, ransomware\n\naccounted for 39 percent of all attacks involving malware. This figure jumped\n\nto 51 percent in Q3. In other words, more than half of malware attacks in the\n\noutgoing quarter saw use of ransomware. This is closely tied to the increasing\n\nprevalence of direct financial gain as a motivation (42% of attacks).\n\n� The number of attacks on manufacturing and industrial companies has remained\n\nhigh since the start of the year: This category come in second place across\n\nall industries as measured by total incidents. Such attacks were performed\n\nprimarily by APT groups and ransomware operators (with ransomware attacks\n\nmaking up 45%).\n\n� Healthcare institutions were once again targeted by criminals. Half of healthcare\n\nincidents related to ransomware, with which attackers cash in on patient data\n\nand make hospitals unable to function by cutting off access to information\n\nsystems, prescriptions, and exam records. Attackers are also targeting research\n\ncenters active in developing a coronavirus vaccine.\n\n� The percentage of social engineering attacks using COVID-19 as a lure fell from\n\n16 percent in Q2 to 4 percent in Q3. We believe that this is primarily due to\n\npeople gradually becoming used to the new reality and the topic of COVID-19\n\nno longer producing quite the same effect as before. Generally speaking,\n\nattackers previously would offer personal protective equipment. Now they\n\nexploit interest in a vaccine instead.\n\n� Compared to the prior quarter, hacking as an attack method on companies grew\n\nby 12 percentage points (to 30%). The likely cause is that criminals continue\n\nto search for vulnerabilities in services on the perimeter of corporate systems.\n\nDue to the pandemic and the mass transition to working from home, many\n\ncompanies have made additional services available on the perimeter for the first\n\ntime. Weak protection in many cases has given more opportunities to attackers.\n\nMoreover, the systems used to provide remote access themselves may contain\n\nknown vulnerabilities, of which we have seen active exploitation in practice.\n\n� The Emotet trojan resurfaced in July and has become a pressing threat. Over\n\n500,000 emails containing Emotet are sent on weekdays. The malware steals\n\ninformation of interest and provides internal network access to the operators\n\nof ransomware and banking trojans.\n\n\n-----\n\n[To protect from cyberattacks, we recommend following our guidelines for ensuring](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-companies-can-do-to-stay-safe/)\n\npersonal and corporate cybersecurity. Considering recent trends, a well-organized\n\nvulnerability management process becomes more than just a response to regula\ntory requirements or industry standards: it increasingly forms a key requirement\n\nfor any corporate security team. With new tools for automated collection and anal\nysis of vulnerability data, deploying such a process in real-world corporate condi\ntions has become much easier. A vulnerability management process must be com\nplemented by up-to-date security solutions including a web application firewall\n\n(WAF) plus traffic analysis and SIEM systems. To prevent delivery of malware in\n\nemails, verify attachments in a sandbox specially designed to perform behavioral\n\nanalysis in a safe environment.\n\n### Statistics\n\nIn Q3 2020, we saw a slowdown in the explosive growth in attacker activity that\n\nhad accompanied the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the year. But\n\nthe number of attacks remains persistently high and quarter-over-quarter growth\n\nin the number of incidents continues. In Q3 2020, the number of attacks grew by\n\ncomparison to both Q2 (by 2.7%) and Q3 2019 (by 54%).\n\n###### 2.7% more cyberattacks than in Q2 2020\n\n\n206\n\n\n213\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n\n_Figure 1.

Malware types (percentage of attacks involving malware)_\n\nAs before, email is the main vector used to breach internal corporate networks and\n\ndeliver malware. But we see a consistent quarterly uptick in exploitation of vulnera\nbilities on the corporate network perimeter for spreading malware. For example, as\n\n[noted by Heimdal researchers, the operators of Netwalker delivered the ransomware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/netwalker-ransomware-explained/)\n\nto victims via phishing emails until April 2020. That's when they changed approach\nes and started to exploit vulnerabilities in unpatched VPN solutions, bruteforce RDP\n\npasswords for remote access, and search for vulnerabilities in web applications.\n\nThis trend was boosted by the pandemic, since companies urgently made services\n\navailable on the perimeter that previously had been limited to the local network only.\n\nThe perimeter changed quickly and many companies failed to sufficiently secure\n\nthese services or simply did not have enough time to do so. Most companies are\n\npartially or fully remote, making inventories of externally accessible resources and\n\nan effective vulnerability management process more important than ever.\n\n\n-----\n\n6% 10% 29%\n\n\n2%\n1%\n\n3%\n31%\n\n\n63%\n\n\n8%\n\nin attacks in attacks\non organizations on individuals\n\n11% 15% 21%\n\n_Figure 8.

Main methods used_\n_for malware distribution (percentage_\n_of attacks on organizations)_\n\n\nInventive attackers are getting ever more creative about hiding their tracks to main\n[tain stealth, even against sandboxes. One such incident affected an international ar-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-for-hire-attack-architecture-firm-via-3ds-max-exploit/)\n\n[chitectural firm in August. The attackers were after information: desktop screenshots,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-for-hire-attack-architecture-firm-via-3ds-max-exploit/)\n\nuser passwords, and files with certain extensions. To reach the internal network, the\n\nhackers created a special malicious plugin (PhysXPluginMfx) for Autodesk 3ds Max.\n\n[Bitdefender researchers found an interesting property of the malware: it checks](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/365/Bitdefender-PR-Whitepaper-APTHackers-creat4740-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf)\n\nwhether Task Manager or Process Monitor is running, and if either of them is active, it\n\nremains inactive, which makes detecting the malware much more difficult.\n\nAn equally interesting incident involved old Zeppelin ransomware, which recently\n\n[returned with a new downloader. Zeppelin already has more than 60 victims to its](https://threatpost.com/zeppelin-ransomware-returns-trojan/159092/)\n\nname. It is spread via phishing emails containing attachments with the .doc exten\nsion. By opening the attachment, the user runs macros and then triggers a mecha\n[nism for installing the downloader. Researchers at Juniper Threat Labs discovered](https://blogs.juniper.net/en-us/threat-research/zeppelin-ransomware-returns-with-a-fresh-wave-of-attacks)\n\nthat Zeppelin had learned how to evade dynamic analysis in a sandbox: after the\n\ndownloader performs its work (by downloading an executable file containing the\n\nransomware), malicious activity stops for 26 seconds. The developers presumably\n\nbelieved this would be enough time for automated sandbox checks to be completed.\n\nAfter this delay, the Zeppelin ransomware is launched.\n\n_Figure 10.

One such case\n\n[is FakeSpy. This spyware was spread through phishing SMS messages, which con-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-security-this-fake-message-about-a-missed-delivery-leads-to-data-stealing-malware/)\n\ntained links supposedly from a mail or delivery service. After being downloaded to\n\na mobile device, FakeSpy began to collect contact lists and banking app credentials,\n\nmonitor SMS messages, and spread itself by sending phishing messages to all of the\n\nvictim's contacts.\n\nNotably, the share of adware doubled: in the prior quarter, it had been implicated in 8\n\n[percent of malware attacks on individuals. RainbowMix programs, which are usually](https://www.whiteops.com/blog/somewhere-over-the-rainbowmix)\n\nmade to look like a Nintendo emulator, are one example. The purpose of these pro\ngrams is to show ads supposedly from legitimate apps. Total RainbowMix downloads\n\nexceed 14 million, with up to 15 million ad impressions in a single day.\n\n### Ransomware booming\n\nThe third quarter brought a record rise in the number of ransomware attacks, which\n\naccounted for over half of all malware attacks.\n\nInstead of mass attacks, ransomware operators by and large are striking very selec\ntively as they target major companies able to provide a large payday, or else organ\n\n39%\n\n\n51%\n\nQ3\n\n\n36%\n\n\n34%\n\n\n2019 2020\n\n\nizations ill-able to afford any disruptions.

On September 7,\n\n[the group attacked K-Electric, the sole electrical supplier in the Pakistani city of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-hits-pakistans-largest-private-power-utility/)\n\nKarachi. Consequences included disruptions to online billing and other services. The\n\nattackers demanded $3.9 million for restoring access and, if not paid within seven\n\ndays, threatened to raise the amount to $7.7 million.\n\n[Maze performed a successful attack on major Vietnamese steel sheet manufactur-](https://cybleinc.com/2020/08/17/one-of-the-largest-steel-sheet-companies-in-southeast-asia-got-allegedly-breached-by-maze/)\n\ner Hoa Sen Group. They stole a range of data, including employee records, internal\n\ncorrespondence, and other sensitive files. To date, 1.64 GB of files (5% of the total\n\n[amount stolen) has been put online. The same attackers also struck SK hynix, a](https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/20/maze_crew_sk_hynix/)\n\nmajor vendor of RAM and flash memory. They exfiltrated 11 GB of information, in\ncluding confidential agreements for sale of NAND flash memory to Apple.\n\n### Healthcare: the second wave\n\nSince February 2020, COVID-19 has been a major concern in almost every country.\n\nThis is particularly true for healthcare institutions, which continue operating under\n\ncolossal burdens. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the epidemic. In the third\n\nquarter, we saw more attacks aimed at these very institutions.\n\nHalf of healthcare attacks included by ransomware, with painful consequences. In\n\n[late September, American hospital network Universal Health Services was attacked](https://ir.uhsinc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/universal-health-services-inc-reports-information-technology)\n\n[by Ryuk ransomware. Doctors could not access patient test results or prescriptions,](https://ir.uhsinc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/universal-health-services-inc-reports-information-technology)\n\n\n2019 2020\n\n\nget data from diagnostic devices, or provide patient care.

Attack methods (percentage of attacks on healthcare)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe trend of publishing stolen data continues to grow. In August, the operators of\n\n[REvil attacked Valley Health hospitals in the U.S., from which they stole all informa-](https://cybleinc.com/2020/08/27/revil-allegedly-targets-another-healthcare-organization/)\n\ntion on the internal network before encrypting it. To prove that they had obtained ac\ncess, the attackers published some of the stolen information online, including patient\n\nmedical data such as prescription lists and exam records. In September, University\n\n[Hospital New Jersey was struck by SunCrypt ransomware. A total of 240 GB of data,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-jersey-hospital-paid-ransomware-gang-670k-to-prevent-data-leak/)\n\nincluding patient records, was stolen. After 48,000 of the hospital's documents\n\nwere published on the site of the ransomware operator, the hospital contacted the\n\nattackers with a request to halt further publications. In negotiations, the ransom was\n\nreduced from $1.7 million to $670,000, which the hospital paid.\n\nSome hackers repurpose the official websites of healthcare institutions to pub\n[lish their own content. In one case, attackers exploited vulnerabilities in CMS plat-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacked-government-college-sites-push-malware-via-fake-hacking-tools/)\n\n[forms used by the sites of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and National Cancer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacked-government-college-sites-push-malware-via-fake-hacking-tools/)\n\nInstitute to post articles about how to hack accounts on popular social networks. In\n\nthe articles, they prompted paying for an alleged hacking tool; the attackers thus\n\ngained access to payment card data as well as money from purchasers.\n\n### Hunt for a vaccine\n\nClinics and hospitals are far from the only ones hit. Attackers are even targeting re\n[search centers working on a vaccine for COVID-19. This September, research centers](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-covid-19-vaccine.html)\n\n[in Spain were attacked. The attackers' main objective was to obtain information on](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-covid-19-vaccine.html)\n\ndevelopment and testing.\n\nCOVID-19 concern is abused in attacks on individuals as well. In the prior quarter,\n\nphishing messages would tend to offer personal protective equipment or more in\nformation about the virus. But now, most often, they exploit interest in a vaccine\n\n[instead. One mailing addressed to people in the United Kingdom claimed that local](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/phishing-emails-tempting-people-with-fake-coronavirus-vaccines/)\n\nvaccine efforts were going slowly and offered a supposed vaccine for sale on the\n\nsite of a Canadian pharmacy chain. Needless to say, the link went to a fraudulent site\n\noffering fakes.\n\nHowever, the number of COVID-19 phishing mailings is decreasing quickly. The per\ncentage of social engineering attacks using COVID-19 as a lure fell from 16 percent\n\nin Q2 to 4 percent in Q3.\n\n### Perimeter attacks picking up steam\n\nAttackers' preferred methods for breaching internal networks are changing. Across\n\nnearly all industries, we see increasing use of hacking instead of other methods. This\n\nis unsurprising given the mass move to working from home and rapid growth in ser\nvices available on the network perimeter at many companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nScience and\neducation\n\nHealthcare\n\nManufacturing\nand industry\n\nFinance\n\nGovernment\n\n\n13%\n\n16%\n16%\n\n6%\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\n\nQ3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 © Positive Technologies\n\n\n32%\n\n30%\n\n\n_Figure 20.

Information is drawn from our own expertise,\n\noutcomes of numerous investigations, and data from authoritative sources.\n\nIn our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to reputational\n\nrisks. The result is that even organizations that investigate incidents and analyze\n\nactivity by hacker groups are unable to perform a precise count. This research is\n\nconducted in order to draw the attention of companies and ordinary individuals\n\nwho care about the state of information security to the key motives and methods\n\nof cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the main trends in the changing cyberthreat\n\nlandscape.\n\nIn this report, each mass attack (in which attackers send out a phishing email to\n\nmany addresses, for instance) is counted as a single incident. Definitions for terms\n\n[used in this report are available in the glossary on the Positive Technologies site.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/glossary/en/a/)\n\nFor 18 years, Positive Technologies has been creating innovative solutions for information security. We develop products and ser\nvices to detect, verify, and neutralize the real-world business risks associated with corporate IT infrastructure. Our technologies\n\nare backed by years of research experience and the expertise of world-class cybersecurity experts.\n\nOver 2,000 companies in 30 countries trust us to keep them safe.\n\n[Follow us on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) and the News section at ptsecurity.com.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/positive-technologies/)\n\n\nCybersecurity threatscape 2020 Q3 A4 ENG 0003 04 DEC 22 2020\n\n\n-----",
