And, much like other areas of cybercrime, attackers\nonly refine and grow their skillset for infecting ATM systems from year-to-year. So what does\nthe ATM landscape look like as of 2020? Let’s take a look.\n\n## The world of ATM/PoS malware\n\nATM attacks aren’t new, and that’s not surprising. After all, what is one of the primary motives\ndriving cyber criminals? Money. And ATMs are cash hubs—one successful attack can net\n[you hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the past, even high-profile threat actors have made](https://securelist.com/apt-style-bank-robberies-increase-with-metel-gcman-and-carbanak-2-0-attacks/73638/)\nATMs their prime target.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, attacking ATMs is a bit different from traditional financial-related threats, like\nphishing emails or spoofed websites. That’s because ATMs operate in a unique space in the\ntech world: they’re still connected to the corporate networks but at the same time must be\naccessible to anyone that passes by. The resulting technical differences means the attack\nmethods differ from those used for traditional endpoints.\n\nATMs also share several common characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to\nattacks:\n\nTraditional software that is part of the warranty offered by the vendors → If major\nchanges occur that are not approved by the ATM vendor, including installing AV\nsoftware, then sometimes this warranty is lost.\nRegular use of outdated operating systems and the apps its runs on\nLocations chosen in a way that provide access to as many customers as possible,\nincluding those in remote regions → These isolated locations often lack any reasonable\nphysical security\n\nOld software means unpatched vulnerabilities—ones criminals can exploit—and isolated\nareas makes it easier for criminals to gain physical access to the internal ports of the\nmotherboard. This is especially typical for the old ATM machines located in many regions\nwith low resources and no budgets for ATM upgrades. When combined, ATMs become not\nonly a highly profitable target—but an easy one.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, there has been a marked increase in ATM attacks, due to a few families\nbeing particularly active. These target systems around the globe, regardless of the vendor,\nand have one of two goals: either stealing customers’ information or funneling funds directly\nfrom the bank.\n\nConsidering all of the above, we decided to delve further into what has been happening in\nthe world of ATM/PoS malware for the last few years.\n\n## ATM/PoS malware attacks: by the numbers\n\nTo gain a closer look at ATM malware worldwide, we utilized the statistics processed by\nKaspersky Security Network (KSN) over the course of the past three years globally.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Number of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware, 2017-2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/04/22111058/sl_atmmalware_01-en-atm-malw-act.png)\n\nThe results showed that the number of unique devices protected by Kaspersky that\nencountered ATM/PoS (point-of-sale) malware at least once experienced a two-digit growth\nin 2018—and this number held steady, even increasing slightly, in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Geography of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware, 2017 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/04/22111104/sl_atmmalware_02-en-users-country-2017.png)\n\n**TOP 10 countries by number of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware in**\n**2017**\n\n**Country** **Devices**\n\n1 Russian Federation 1016\n\n2 Brazil 423\n\n3 Vietnam 281\n\n4 United States 148\n\n5 India 137\n\n6 Turkey 96\n\n7 China 94\n\n8 Germany 58\n\n\n-----\n\n9 Philippines 53\n\n10 Mexico 51\n\nThe ten countries that had the greatest number of unique devices affected by ATM/POS\nmalware were relatively dispersed around the globe, with the highest number in Russia.\n[Russia has had a long history of threat actors targeting financial institutions. For example, it](https://securelist.com/tyupkin-manipulating-atm-machines-with-malware/66988/)\n[was in 2017 that Kaspersky researchers uncovered an ATM malware dubbed “ATMitch” that](https://securelist.com/atmitch-remote-administration-of-atms/77918/)\nwas gaining remote access control over ATMS at Russian banks. In addition, the relatively\nhigh rates in both Brazil and Mexico can be partially attributed to Latin and South America’s\n[longstanding history as a hotspot of ATM malware.](https://securelist.com/atm-malware-from-latin-america-to-the-world/83836/)\n\n[Geography of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware, 2018 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/04/22111111/sl_atmmalware_03-en-users-country-2018.png)\n\n**TOP 10 countries by number of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware in**\n**2018**\n\n**Country** **Devices**\n\n1 Russian Federation 1370\n\n\n-----\n\n2 Brazil 753\n\n3 Italy 537\n\n4 United States 519\n\n5 Vietnam 433\n\n6 India 408\n\n7 Thailand 369\n\n8 Germany 277\n\n9 Turkey 224\n\n10 Iran 198\n\nIn 2018, the countries with the greatest number of ATM/PoS malware incidents recorded by\nunique devices remained distributed worldwide, but the countries remained similar to 2017,\nwith the highest activity recorded in Russia and Brazil.\n\nThe overall increase in the number of devices affected can be attributed to both the\nreappearance of new ATM malware and the development of new families:\n\n**ATMJackpot first appeared in Taiwan back in 2016. It infects the banks’ internal**\nnetworks, allowing it to withdraw funds directly from the ATM. ATMJackpot was able to\nreach thousands of ATMs.\n**[WinPot was discovered at the beginning of 2018 in Eastern Europe and was designed](https://securelist.com/atm-robber-winpot/89611/)**\nto make the infected ATM automatically dispense all cash from its most valuable\ncassettes. Because of its time counter, its execution is time-dependent: if the targeted\nsystem’s time does not fall within the preset period during which the malware was\nprogrammed to work (e.g. March), WinPot silently stops operating without showing its\ninterface.\n**Ice5 originated in Latin America. Its engineering tool is written in a scripting language**\nthat allows the attackers to achieve a significant level of manipulation over the infected\nATMs. The initial infection occurs via the USB port.\n**ATMTest is a multi-stage infection in 2018. It requires console access to the ATM,**\nmeaning the attackers have to gain remote access to the bank’s networks. This\nmalware was originally coded to steal money in rubles.\n**[Peralta was an evolution of the infamous ATM malware project called Ploutus, which](https://securelist.com/atm-malware-from-latin-america-to-the-world/83836/)**\nled to losses of $64,864,864.00 across 73,258 compromised ATMs. Both Peralta and\nPloutus originated in Latin America.\n**ATMWizX was discovered in the fall of 2018 and dispenses all cash automatically,**\nstarting with the most valuable cassettes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[ATMDtruck also appeared in the fall of 2018 with indications that the first victims were](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/)**\nin India. It collects enough information from the credit cards inputted into the infected\nATM that it can actually clone them. It drops the malware “Dtrack”, which is a\nsophisticated spy tool.\n\n[Geography of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware, 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/04/22111119/sl_atmmalware_04-en-users-country-2019.png)\n\n**TOP 10 countries by number of unique devices that encountered ATM/PoS malware in**\n**2019**\n\n**Country** **Devices**\n\n1 Russian Federation 2306\n\n2 Iran 1178\n\n3 Brazil 819\n\n4 Vietnam 416\n\n5 India 353\n\n\n-----\n\n6 Germany 228\n\n7 United States 220\n\n8 Italy 197\n\n9 Turkey 149\n\n10 Mexico 114\n\nThis past year, the ten countries with the highest level of ATM/PoS malware activity remained\nthe same, with only one change: Mexico once again entered the top ten, while Thailand left.\n\nOverall, the total number of devices affected increased once again. In fact, ATM/PoS\nmalware activity reached new levels by the spring of 2019 with a string of operations:\nATMqot, ATMqotX, and ATMJaDi. ATMgot operates directly on the ATM using the dispenser\nto withdraw the maximum number of banknotes allowed; if it cannot do this, it will default to\n20 notes. This malware also possesses anti-forensic techniques that allow it to delete traces\nof the infection from the ATMs, as well as some video files, which could potentially be used\nas part of video monitoring.\n\n[ATMJadi orginated in Latin America and is capable of cashing out ATMs. Since it’s a Java-](https://securelist.com/criminals-atms-and-a-cup-of-coffee/91406/)\nbased project, it’s platform-dependent—and thus highly targeted. In order to be installed, the\nattackers must gain access to the bank’s network. This suggests the attackers first\ncompromise the bank’s infrastructure. But what’s perhaps most interesting is the false flag\nsection with strings in the Russian language.\n\nThe problem of cyberattacks is compounded by the use of outdated and unpatched systems.\nThat means that, even as new 2019 malware families were developed, the old ATM families\nfrom the previous years can still be used to launch successful attacks.\n\n## A look towards the future\n\nATM/PoS malware will only continue to evolve, and so, we will continue to monitor the\necosystem closely. We’ve already seen WinPot, first discovered in 2018, active this year in\ndifferent parts of the world.\n\nLatin America has long been known as a region of innovative cybercriminals who adopt\ntechniques other region uses. It’s not surprising then that a new trend was recently\ndiscovered in development: an ATM MaaS project whereby a group in Latin America is\nattempting to sell ATM malware developed for each major vendor on the market. Projects like\nthese provide further evidence that the world of ATM malware is still evolving, with\ncybercriminals continuously developing better attack strategies.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur research has also shown that, beyond Latin America, countries in Europe and the APAC\nregion are of particular interest to ATM attackers, as is the United States. This signifies that\nATM malware is a truly global threat. After all, ATMs are located in nearly every country and\nfew systems offer access to such massive amounts of fund.\n\nHow, then, can you protect your money? No matter how digital banking has become, ATMs\nare still an inevitable part of managing your funds. While you can’t control whether or not an\nATM machine is attacked, by conscientiously monitoring your accounts and financial\ntransactions, you can make sure suspicious activity is quickly identified and the proper\nchannels duly notified. This should help mitigate the damage caused by any attack.\n\nFor financial institutions, staying secure requires a comprehensive, multi-step approach:\n\n1. Evaluate which attack vectors are more likely to be used and generate a threat model.\n\nThis will depend, for example, on what network architecture is in place and where the\nATM is installed – a place not controlled by your organization, such as a wall on the\nstreet, or an office under video surveillance, etc.\n2. Determine which ATMs are outdated or have an OS version that’s reaching the end of\n\nits vendor support. If you cannot replace the legacy devices, pay attention to this fact in\nyour threat model and set the appropriate security solution settings, which do not affect\nthe device’s productivity.\n3. Regularly conduct security assessments or pentests of ATMs to find possible\n\ncyberattack vectors. Kaspersky’s [threat hunting service can also help you find](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-hunting)\nsophisticated cybercriminals.\n4. Regularly review the physical safety of ATMs to detect abnormal elements\n\nimplemented by attackers.\n\n1. If ATM configurations permit it, install a security solution that protects the devices from\n\ndifferent attack vectors, such as [Kaspersky Embedded Systems Security. If the device](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/embedded-systems)\nhas extremely low system specs, the Kaspersky solution would still protect it with a\nDefault Deny allowlisting scenario\n\nPoS terminals are in many aspects similar to ATMs, but still possess a number of differences\nto be mindful of—and tackled accordingly. Apart from the steps mentioned above (which\nremain applicable), the following must be taken into account:\n\n1. Often more powerful when compared to an average ATM, Windows-based PoS\n\nterminals offer greater spaces for attackers’ maneuvering and are capable of running a\nbroad range of modern malware and hacking tools. This makes implementation of\nmulti-layered protection a must.\n2. While also residing in public spaces, they generally lack ATMs’ heavy armor. Therefore,\n\nthey are more susceptible to direct attacks using unauthorized devices. This makes\nproperly configured Device Control even more valuable.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. As they are frequently involved not only in financial, but also personal, data processing,\n\nthis adds to their attractiveness for cyberattacks and also subjects them to more\nlegislation. In combination with direct attack scenarios, implementation of file integrity\nmonitoring and log inspection are mandatory, preferably in a way that allows tracking\nchanges offline.\n4. Embedded systems should be protected not only by host-based security, but also by\n\napplication of network-level security, such as Secure Web Gateways or Next-gen\nFirewalls capable of detecting and blocking unsolicited communications and other\nsystems both inside and outside of the company’s infrastructure.\n\n[ATM attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/atm-attacks/)\n[Financial malware](https://securelist.com/tag/financial-malware/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nKaspersky\n\nA look at the ATM/PoS malware landscape from 2017-2019\n\nYour email address will not be published.
