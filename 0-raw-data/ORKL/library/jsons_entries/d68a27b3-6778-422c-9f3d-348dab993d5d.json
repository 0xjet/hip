The Chinese security vendor claimed the\n[group was new, but when ZDNet reached out to Kaspersky, we were told Golden Falcon appears to be another name for DustSquad, a cyber-](https://securelist.com/octopus-infested-seas-of-central-asia/88200/)\n[espionage entity that has been active since 2017.](https://twitter.com/securitydoggo/status/933075113557323777)\n\n\n-----\n\ne o y epo t deta g ts p e ous ac g ope at o s dates bac to 0 8 e t as see us g spea p s g e a s t at ead use s to a\nmalware-laced version of Telegram.\n\nJust like the attacks documented by Qihoo this week, the 2018 attacks also focused on Kazakhstan but had used a different malware strain.\n\nQihoo's new report is primarily based on data the Chinese company obtained after it gained access to one of Golden Falcon's command and\ncontrol (C&C) server, from where they retrieved operational data about the group's activities.\n\nHere, the Chinese firm said it found data retrieved from infected victims. Collected data involved primarily office documents, taken from hacked\ncomputers.\n\nAll the stolen information was arranged in per-city folders, with each city folder containing data on each infected host. Researchers said they\nfound data from victims located in Kazakhstan 13 largest cities, and more.\n\n\ngf-kazachstan-map.png\n\n\nImage: Qihoo 360\n\n\n-----\n\ne data as e c ypted, but esea c e s sa d t ey e e ab e to dec ypt t s de, t ey a so ou d e de ce t at Go de a co as a so\nspying on foreign nationals in the country -- with Qihoo naming Chinese international students and Chinese diplomats as targets.\n\n## Expensive hacking tools\n\nFiles on the C&C server revealed what types of hacking tools this group was using. Two tools stood out. The first was a version of RCS\n(Remote Control System), a surveillance kit sold by Italian vendor HackingTeam. The second was a backdoor trojan named Harpoon (Garpun\nin the Russian language) that appears to have been developed by the group itself.\n\nIn regards to its use of RCS, what stood out was that Golden Falcon was using a new version of RCS. The RCS version number is important\nbecause, [in 2015, a hacker breached and then leaked all the HackingTeam's internal files, including the source code for RCS.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach)\n\nAt the time, the RCS version number was 9.6. According to Qihoo, the version number for the RCS instances they found in Golden Falcon's\npossession was 10.3, a newer version, meaning the group most likely bought a newer version from its distributor.\n\nBut Golden Falcon was also in the possession of another potent tool. Qihoo says the group was using a unique backdoor that hasn't been\nseen outside the group's operations and was most likely their own creation.\n\nThe Chinese vendor said it obtained a copy of this tool's manual. It is unclear if they found the manual on the group's C&C server, or if they\nobtained it from another source. The manual, however, shows a well-developed tool with a large feature-set, on par with many of today's top\nexisting backdoor trojans.\n\n\ngf-harpoon.png\n\n\nImage: Qihoo 360\nFeatures include:\n\nKeylogging\nSteal clipboard data\nTake screenshot of the active window at predetermined intervals\nList the contents of a given directory\nGet Skype login name, contact list, and chat message history\nGet Skype and Google Hangouts contacts and voice recordings\n\n\n-----\n\neco d sou d a t e c op o e, ea esd opp g\nCopy a specified file from the target computer\nAutomatically copy files from removable media\nStore all intercepted data in an encrypted data file, inside a specified directory\nSend stolen data to a specified FTP server\nRun a program or operating system command\nDownload files from a given FTP into a specific directory\nRemotely reconfigure and update components\nReceive data files from a given FTP and automatically extract the files to a specified directory\nSelf-destruct\n\nMost of the features listed above are the norm for most high-level backdoor trojans, usually encountered in nation-state level cyber-espionage.\n\n## Mobile malware\n\nBut Qihoo researchers also found additional files, such as contracts, supposedly signed by the group.\n\nIt is important to point out that cyber-espionage groups don't leave contracts sitting around on C&C servers. It is unclear if these contracts were\nfound on Golden Falcon's C&C server, or were retrieved from other sources. Qihoo didn't say.\n\nOne of these contracts appears to be for the procurement of a mobile surveillance toolkit known as Pegasus. This is a powerful mobile hacking\ntool, with Android and iOS versions, sold by NSO Group.\n\nThe contract suggests that Golden Eagle had, at least, shown interest in acquiring NSO's Android and iOS surveillance tools. It is unclear if the\ncontract was ever completed with a sale, as Qihoo didn't find any evidence of NSO's Pegasus beyond the contract.\n\n\ngf-nso.png\n\n\nImage: Qihoo 360\nEither way, Golden Eagle did have mobile hacking capabilities. This capability was provided via Android malware supplied by the\nHackingTeam.\n\n\n-----\n\nQ oo sa d t e a a e t ey a a y ed c uded odu es t eatu es a g g o aud o ea esd opp g to b o se sto y t ac g, a d\nfrom stealing IM chat logs to tracking a victim's geo-location.\n\n## Radio interception hardware\n\nA second set of contracts showed that Golden Falcon had also acquired equipment from Yurion, a Moscow-based defense contractor that's\nspecialized in radio monitoring, eavesdropping, and other communications equipment.\n\nAgain, Qihoo only shared details about the contract's existence, but could not say if the equipment was bought or used -- as such capabilities\ngo beyond the tools at the disposal of a regular security software company.\n\n\ngf-yurion.png\n\n\nImage: Qihoo 360\n\n## Tracking down members?\n\nThe Chinese cyber-security firm also said it tracked down several Golden Falcon members through details left in legal digital signatures,\nsupposedly found inside the contracts they discovered.\n\nResearchers said they tracked four Golden Falcon members and one organization.\n\nUsing data that was left uncensored in a screenshot shared by Qihoo, we were able to track one of the group's members to a LinkedIn profile\nbelonging to a Moscow area-based programmer that the Chinese firm described as \"a technical engineer\" for Golden Falcon.\n\n## No official attribution -- but plenty of theories\n\nNeither Qihoo nor Kaspersky, in its 2018 report, make any formal attribution for this group. The only detail the two shared was that this was a\nRussian-speaking APT (advanced persistent threat -- a technical term used to describe advanced, nation-state backed hacking units).\n\nDuring research for this article, ZDNet asked a few analysts for their opinions. The most common theories we heard were that this \"looks\" to be\n(1) a Russian APT, (2) a Kazakh intelligence agency spying on its citizens, (3) a Russian mercenary group doing on-demand spying for the\nKazakh government -- with the last two being the most common answer.\n\n\n-----\n\no e e, t s ou d be oted t at t ese a gu e ts a e subject e a d ot based o a y actua substa t a p oo\n\nThe use of HackingTeam surveillance software, and the inquiry into buying NSO Group mobile hacking capabilities does show that this could\nbe, indeed, an authorized law enforcement agency. However, Qihoo also pointed out that some of the targets/victims of this hacking campaign\nwere also Chinese government officials in north-west China -- meaning that if this was a Kazakh law enforcement agency, then they seriously\noverstepped their jurisdiction.\n\n_[The Qihoo Golden Falcon report is available here, in Chinese, and here, translated with Google Translate.
