These targets suggest the\ngroup is likely interested in gathering intelligence on military\ntechnology and defense. RedFoxtrot has historically employed\nmultiple open- and closed-source tooling commonly shared\nacross Chinese cyber espionage groups, including PlugX,\nPoison Ivy, Royal Road, PCShare, and IceFog. Insikt Group also\nidentified multiple links to suspected ShadowPad command\nand control (C2) infrastructure, tracked by Recorded Future\nas AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, providing evidence of [yet another](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\nChinese group with access to the custom backdoor. Notable\nRedFoxtrot victims over the past 6 months include multiple\nIndian aerospace and defense contractors; telecommunications\ncompanies in Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan; and\nseveral national and state institutions in the region. Activity over\nthis period showed a particular focus on Indian targets, which\noccurred at a time of heightened border tensions between India\nand the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\n\n_Fig re 2: Heatmap of RedFo trot acti it_ _targeting Central and So th Asia_\n\n\n##### RedFoxtrot’s Connection to PLA Unit 69010\n\nInsikt Group identified links between RedFoxtrot’s operational\ninfrastructure and PLA Unit 69010 through the online persona\nof a suspected RedFoxtrot threat actor. Due to lax operational\nsecurity measures employed by this individual, we uncovered a\nconnection to the likely physical address of the headquarters\nof PLA Unit 69010, No. 553, Wenquan East Road, Shuimogou\nDistrict, Ürümqi, Xinjiang (新疆乌鲁木齐市水磨沟区温泉东路553\n号). Insikt Group is not publicly disclosing the identity of this\nindividual; however, an extensive online presence provided\ncorroborating evidence indicating that this individual is located\nin Ürümqi, has an interest in hacking, and also has a suspected\nhistorical affiliation with the PLA’s former Communications\nCommand Academy[1] (通信指挥学院) located in Wuhan.\n\n[1 Also formerly known as the Communications Command College, the Communications](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CASI/Books/CASI_Academic_Institutions_Encyclopedia_web_final.pdf)\n[Command Academy has previously been noted for its role in training former 3PLA personnel](https://info.publicintelligence.net/USCC-ChinaCyberEspionage.pdf)\nin information and cyber warfare and military communications systems. It has now been likely\nincorporated into the College of Information and Communication at the National University of\nDefense Technology (国防科技大学信息通信学院).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### What is Unit 69010?\n\nUnit 69010 is likely the MUCD for a bureau within the PLASSF headquartered in Ürümqi, Xinjiang. Formerly known as the\nLanzhou Military Region‘s Second TRB according to [research](https://project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf)\npublished in 2011 from the Project 2049 Institute, signals\nintelligence (SIGINT) has long been considered to be within Unit\n69010’s area of responsibility. The unit also likely has multiple\nsubordinate offices primarily responsible for monitoring military\nactivity along China’s western border. An analysis of academic\noutput attributed to the unit also provides evidence that Unit\n69010 likely has a cyber mission as late as 2015 (example\npublications [2],[3]). Prior to a restructure beginning in 2015, much\nof China’s cyber espionage efforts were linked to TRBs and\nbureaus of the PLA General Staff Department’s (GSD) Third\nDepartment (3PLA). 3PLA was broadly responsible for defensive\nSIGINT, including monitoring Chinese communication networks,\nprotecting the security of Chinese domestic computer networks,\nand [conducting cyber espionage-oriented](https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/Portals/6/Documents/CDR%20Journal%20Articles/The%20Strategic%20Support%20Force_Kania_Costello.pdf) [computer network](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/transcripts/June%2009,%202016%20Hearing%20Transcript.pdf)\n[exploitation. Beginning in 2015, the capabilities and tasking of](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/transcripts/June%2009,%202016%20Hearing%20Transcript.pdf)\nthe TRBs and 3PLA were [reorganized and largely moved into](https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/Portals/6/Documents/CDR%20Journal%20Articles/The%20Strategic%20Support%20Force_Kania_Costello.pdf)\nthe newly formed SSF NSD. Evidence explored in the following\nsection indicates that Unit 69010 was likely moved under the\nSSF NSD as part of China’s military reforms.\n\nThe former Lanzhou Military Region was incorporated within\nthe new Western Theater Command of the PLA following the\n2015 restructure. The Western Theater Command is one of 5\ntheater commands of the PLA, and is almost certainly tasked\nwith monitoring India, Pakistan, and Central Asia. This orientation\ndirectly aligns with observed RedFoxtrot activity. Similarly,\nintelligence gathering on defense, military, telecommunications,\nand government targets also aligns with the expected operational\nscope of a PLA unit and fits the target profile of other PLA-linked\n\n[groups (1,2,3).](https://securelist.com/cactuspete-apt-groups-updated-bisonal-backdoor/97962/)\n\n2 Yang Ping 杨萍 and Liang Guangming 梁广明, “物联网安全问题及对策分析” [Security\nProblems and Solutions for the Internet of Things], 无线互联科技 Wireless Internet\nTechnology 6, (2013): 13.\n\n[3 Yang Ping 杨萍 and Tian Jianchun 田建春, “Wireshark网络安全风险评估关键技](http://ksuxk.cqvip.com/asset/search?key=A%3d%e7%94%b0%e5%bb%ba%e6%98%a5)\n术研究” [Research on Key Technologies of Wireshark Network Security Risk\nAssessment], 网络安全技术与应用 Network Security Technology and Application 9\n(2015): 54.\n\n\n_Figure 3: Entrance to suspected Unit 69010 compound located at No. 553 Wenquan East Road,_\n_Ürümqi (Source: Baidu Maps)_\n\n##### No. 553, Wenquan East Road\n\nPublic reporting has [indicated that Unit 69010 is](https://project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf)\nheadquartered in Ürümqi‘s Shuimogou [水磨沟] district. We\nidentified that the No. 553 Wenquan East Road address, which\nis situated within Shuimogou, has appeared on multiple Xinjiang\nprovincial court documents directly linking PLA Unit 69010 to\nthis location. Furthermore, this address is featured on 5 SSFissued tenders for a variety of equipment over the past several\nyears, indicating that Unit 69010 was likely moved to the SSF\nfollowing PLA reforms.\n\n_Figure 4: Court document linking Unit 69010 to No. 553 Wenquan East Road address [4]_\n\n_Figure 5: Recorded Future Event for SSF-issued military procurement documents for 553 Wenquan_\n_East Road address (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\nBaidu Maps shows that this address corresponds to a large\ncompound facility comprising multiple buildings and a residential\narea. As evident from satellite and street-level imagery, multiple\nsatellites are visible on the roof of the unit’s main building as well\nas the hill behind the compound, while other attributes commonly\nseen at PLA bases are also present, such as a parade area, a\nrunning track and sports fields, and a large gated entrance.\n\n_Figure 6: Aerial images of suspected Unit 69010 compound located on Wenquan East Road [5]_\n\n5 Two other properties share the same address as Unit 69010: an apartment\ncomplex across the street, which we were unable to confirm is affiliated with the\nbase, and an electronics store directly beside the base. It is very unlikely that the\nRedFoxtrot persona and related cyber espionage activity is linked to either of\nthese 2 properties and the address almost certainly refers to Unit 69010 in the\ncontext of our investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Timeline of RedFoxtrot infrastructure detection, malware detections, and NTA events in 2021 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### Mapping RedFoxtrot’s Sprawling Infrastructure\n\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA),\nadversary infrastructure detection, and other common analytical\ntechniques, we have tracked a large cluster of RedFoxtrot\ninfrastructure and associated malware samples used in active\nintrusions over the past 6 months. There are strong ties between\nthis activity and publicly reported campaigns dating back to at\nleast 2014. We identified clear and consistent hosting overlaps\nfor domains linked to the identified infrastructure cluster, as well\nas common targeting and overlapping malware use. Notably,\nwe identified the following high-level trends in the group’s\ninfrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs):\n\n  - Use of a large number of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains\n\nwhich form part of overlapping infrastructure clusters\n\n  - DDNS domains often contain hints regarding\n\ngeographical targeting or spoof specific organizations\n(for example, “inbsnl.ddns[.]info”, “adtl.mywire[.]org”, and\n“indianmail.zyns[.]com”)\n\n  - Strong preference for DigitalOcean and Choopa (Vultr)\n\nhosting providers in recent times\n\n  - Use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure, indicative\n\nof the group’s likely access to the ShadowPad backdoor\n\n\n[As previously referenced in our reporting on the China-linked](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\ngroup RedEcho, network infrastructure used in ShadowPad\ninfections is tracked by Insikt Group as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE.\n\n##### AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE and PlugX Clusters\n\nUsing Recorded Future adversary infrastructure detection\nmethods, we identified that a large proportion of the RedFoxtrot\ndomains are linked to AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE and PlugX C2\ninfrastructure. Many of these were also used as C2s for different\nmalware families, such as PCShare. Commonly, the group used\nsingle servers to host a swath of DDNS domains, which were\nmoved around in bulk over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Partial Maltego chart of RedFoxtrot PlugX and AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE Infrastructure_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Links to Historical Campaign Targeting Turkish Language Speakers\n\n4 domains linked to RedFoxtrot activity registered in mid-2019\n(kelimelerdunyasi[.]org, stratejibilimi[.]com, adobesupport[.]\nnet, and superkelimeler[.]com) were all used by the group to\nmirror a legitimate Turkish language website for learning English,\ningilizcem[.]org. In addition to consistent hosting overlaps and\nthe shared spoofing of ingilizcem[.]org, 3 out of the 4 domains\nare linked to the same privacy protection registration email\naddress, stratejibilimi.com@protectdomain[.]org. While these\nwebsites no longer resolve, open-source reporting indicates\nthat adobesupport[.]net was used to [serve the Poison Ivy](https://community.riskiq.com/article/56fa1b2f)\nSKYLINE variant masquerading as an Adobe Flash installer in\nmid-2019 (shortly after the registration of these 4 domains). We\nbelieve that these domains were likely used by RedFoxtrot to\ntarget Turkish-language speakers. Since this time, there have\nbeen consistent hosting overlaps between these 4 domains and\nmultiple additional RedFoxtrot domains. Notably, the Poison Ivy\nvariant served from adobesupport[.]net closely overlaps with\nadditional suspected RedFoxtrot activity:\n\n**Poison Ivy SKYLINE Variant** **C2 Domain**\n\nacb11d9d0652c95b16db17fda918ff5b6ee66815\n\nskylineqaz.crabdance[.]com\n\n6a30fe6276b0fa66f74c9720\n\nc1e3a5e171d0de6054f4a1aeb9a46ff176ef5ba6\n\ncoreldraw.kozow[.]com\n\n464304b2f2660a23396e91f4\n\n379af30d508cdbae7eb201041d8eb815b239e18\n\nhostmail1[.]com\n\n1dd8106145d4263753df3acd9\n\n367718fd58c658dce22c995f3e10bc3a5425814\n\ncapture.kozow[.]com\n\nddf221686e166e3129a53e897\n\nIn addition to characteristics previously highlighted\nregarding this Poison Ivy variant, there are also direct historical\nhosting overlaps between the kelimelerdunyasi[.]org domain and\nhostmail1[.]com (45.251.241[.]13) as well as hostmail1[.]com and\nskylineqaz.crabdance[.]com (206.189.153[.]132).\n\n\n##### Overlaps With Publicly Reported Activity\n\nRedFoxtrot activity overlaps with groups tracked by other\nsecurity vendors as Temp.Trident/Nomad Panda. A multitude of\ninfrastructure, targeting, and malware overlaps were discovered\nbetween RedFoxtrot activity and 2018 to 2019 campaigns\ntracked by FireEye as WATERFIGHT and SKYLINE, which targeted\n[countries in Central Asia (1,2). Additionally, elements of the](https://speakerdeck.com/ashley920/into-the-fog-the-return-of-icefog-apt)\ngroup’s historical use of the Royal Road (also known as 8.t)\nrich text format (RTF) weaponizer to deliver Icefog and Poison\n[Ivy payloads have been previously](https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain) [documented.

All TCP/UDP network traffic involving\nDDNS subdomains should be blocked and logged (using\n[DNS RPZ or similar).](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-rpz-00)\n\n  - Recorded Future Threat Intelligence, Third-Party\n\n[Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence module users can](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nmonitor real-time output from NTA and Malware Analysis\nanalytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity\ninvolving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n  - Ensure Microsoft Office and Windows software are up to\n\ndate with the latest software updates to protect against\nmalicious documents that attempt to exploit known\nvulnerabilities for code execution, such as those created\nusing the Royal Road RTF weaponizer.\n\n\n#### Outlook\n\nOur research uncovered cyber espionage activity attributed\nto RedFoxtrot, a group linked to Unit 69010 of the PLA-SSF. Of\nparticular note: from 2020 to 2021, the group heavily targeted\nIndian defense contractors, telecommunications providers,\nand government organizations at a time of heightened tension\n[between China and India. We also recently revealed a campaign](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\ntargeting critical infrastructure within India that we attributed\nto a group called RedEcho. While the RedEcho campaign posed\npre-positioning concerns within India’s electricity system,\nRedFoxtrot’s activity is more aligned with traditional PLAlinked activity in gathering military intelligence. These differing\nstrands of activity exemplify Beijing’s multi-pronged approach\nwithin cyberspace, using it as a tool for gathering intelligence\non military technology and national security issues as well as\npolitical developments and foreign relations; for monitoring\nethnic and religious minorities such as [Uyghurs,](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/) [Tibetans, and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redalpha-cyber-campaigns/)\n[Catholics, and to further goals set out within strategic policy](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations/)\n[such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-cyberespionage-operations/)\n\nRecent years have marked an apparent downturn in reported\nactivity linked to previously tracked PLA-affiliated cyber\nespionage groups in the aftermath of the 2015 restructuring,\nlikely due to old activity groups disbanding or merging to form\nnew clusters. In this period, Chinese cyber espionage efforts have\nbeen widely characterized by activity linked to the Ministry of\nState Security (MSS), China’s principal civilian foreign intelligence\nservice. The MSS has been frequently identified employing a\nprivate contractor model for cyber espionage activity, according\nto US government indictments and the anonymous Chinese\n[APT doxxing persona Intrusion Truth. However, with continued](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/)\nactivity from PLA-linked groups such as [Tonto Team,](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/summit/cds-2019/presentations/cds19-executive-s08-achievement-unlocked.pdf) [Tick,](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/20/national/chinese-military-japan-cyberattacks/)\n[Naikon, and RedFoxtrot, we believe that PLA-affiliated

Capabilities\n\nRedFoxtrot’s infrastructure is linked to an assortment of\nPlugX, Poison Ivy, Royal Road, PCShare, and IceFog samples used\nby the group. Furthermore, the use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE\ninfrastructure has historically been linked to the use of the\nShadowPad malware. 2 of these tools, IceFog and ShadowPad,\nare shared capabilities considered unique to Chinese cyber\n[espionage groups. While Royal Road, PCShare, PlugX, and Poison](https://www.anomali.com/blog/multiple-chinese-threat-groups-exploiting-cve-2018-0798-equation-editor-vulnerability-since-late-2018)\n[Ivy are available more widely, their use is also strongly linked](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations/)\nto multiple China-nexus threat activity groups. In recent times,\nRedFoxtrot has increasingly favored the use of PCShare, PlugX,\nand ShadowPad, with the group’s use of IceFog, Poison Ivy, and\nRoyal Road declining.\n\n##### PCShare RAT\n\nThe Chinese open-source remote access trojan (RAT)\n[PCShare is thought to have roots within the Chinese cybercriminal](https://securelist.com/cycldek-bridging-the-air-gap/97157/)\nunderground, with versions of the tool now freely available via\n[GitHub. In recent years, variants of PCShare have been used in](https://github.com/xdnice/PCShare)\n[suspected Chinese cyber espionage activity targeting South East](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/11/a-detailed-timeline-of-a-chinese-apt-espionage-attack-targeting-south-eastern-asian-government-institutions/)\n[Asia governments and in campaigns](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/11/a-detailed-timeline-of-a-chinese-apt-espionage-attack-targeting-south-eastern-asian-government-institutions/) [attributed to the Chinese](https://securelist.com/cycldek-bridging-the-air-gap/97157/)\ngroup Cycldek (also known as [Goblin Panda). We identified](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/5jZQwZClYTUj)\nmultiple PCShare samples communicating with infrastructure\nwithin the identified RedFoxtrot infrastructure cluster. This\nconsisted of a dropper and loader component which ultimately\ninjects the PCShare RAT payload into the legitimate rdpclip.\nexe process. We identified 3 different samples used to drop\nPCShareRAT loaders, as listed below:\n\n**File Name** **SHA256 Hash**\n\n556d34db7e60b0d25eca0d8e6b9\n\nSophos System\n\n297cd9f2174c0d2ca013c0036a06\n\nProtection Service.exe\n\n7457a2d01\n\nB668f9e213282cd1b941ab8d6dd5f\n\nosloader.exe 3dd3266011ae16c0795ca86d12a5\n\n7c095cc\n\n5802823e50e9aca0d765fa198383f\n\nsecurity_audit_\n\n74ca18859b1181cfc3f72f62667bc\n\ntemplate_final.doc\n\na67dc2\n\nThe Sophos System Protection Service.exe sample\nis signed using a digital code signing certificate\nissued to 东莞信大融合创新研究院 (SHA1 thumbprint:\n8E3991D623A7FFD86516224A0B6932785EF63F9E), which\ntranslates to Dongguan Xinda Integrated Innovation Research\n\n\nInstitute. This organization is a Chinese military-civilian open\ninnovation platform jointly established by the Dongguan Municipal\nPeople’s Government and [PLA-SSF Information Engineering](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/4WYHeeym65NX)\n[University. We were unable to identify any additional files signed](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/4WYHeeym65NX)\nby this certificate, indicating it is not in widespread use. It is\ncurrently unclear how the threat activity group gained access to\nthe code signing certificate, but it provides an additional nexus\nto a PLA-linked institution. In all cases, the dropper drops a\nPCShare loader to the following location and executes it using\nrundll32.exe:\n```\n C:\\{user}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Credentials\\\n\n Winload\\halmacpi.slt\n\n```\nIn each identified loader sample, the PCShare payload is\ninjected by the loader into the legitimate process RDPclip.exe.\nEach identified PCShare payload also shares a common mutex\n(78de65b0701f3c9238a37).\n\nOne of the identified RedFoxtrot PCShare C2 domains\n(supports.casacam[.]net) is [mentioned in a 2020 Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf)\nreport detailing a Chinese activity group targeting Southeast\nAsia government institutions that details a similar PCShare\ndropper and loader component. However, the researchers note\nthat this domain and other samples that inject into RDPclip.exe\nappear to be unrelated to the FunnyDream campaign analyzed\nwithin that report, which aligns with our findings that this is likely\nanother case of shared tooling across Chinese activity groups.\n\n##### PlugX\n\nA RedFoxtrot PlugX sample named Sys.exe (SHA256:\nc21a3a44b46e7242c0762c8ec5e8a394ddc74b747244c5b83\n678620ae141e59c) was uploaded to a malware repository\nfrom India in September 2020. Sys.exe is a self-extracting RAR\ncontaining 3 files, RasTls.exe (a legitimate Symantec executable),\nRasTls.dll (malicious DLL used in DLL hijacking), and RasTls.dll.\n[db (the PlugX payload), reflective of the ”triad” method of DLL](https://securelist.com/the-leap-of-a-cycldek-related-threat-actor/101243/)\nhijacking employed by many Chinese activity groups.\n\nUpon execution, RasTls.exe sideloads the malicious\nRasTls.dll (6cd5079a69d9a68029e37f2680f44b7ba71c2b1ee\ncf4894c2a8b293d5f768f10), which in turn decrypts\nand loads the PlugX payload from RasTls.dll.db\n(fe18adaec076ffce63da6a2a024ce99b8a55bc40a1f06e\nd556e0997ba6b6d716). Once loaded, the payload contacts the\nC2 domain miche.justdied[.]com over TCP port 80. This same\nlegitimate Symantec executable has been abused by multiple\nactivity groups to load PlugX, and has also previously been used\nby RedFoxtrot to load both IceFog and QuickHeal. The PlugX\nsamples used by RedFoxtrot all use an export function called\nMSCORE, which uses similar methods for decoding.\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|Sophos System Protection Service.exe|556d34db7e60b0d25eca0d8e6b9 297cd9f2174c0d2ca013c0036a06 7457a2d01|\n|osloader.exe|B668f9e213282cd1b941ab8d6dd5f 3dd3266011ae16c0795ca86d12a5 7c095cc|\n|security_audit_ template_final.doc|5802823e50e9aca0d765fa198383f 74ca18859b1181cfc3f72f62667bc a67dc2|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### QUICKHEAL\n\nWe also identified multiple samples related to the identified\nadversary infrastructure cluster that appear to overlap with the\n[malware variant tracked by FireEye as QUICKHEAL. All samples](https://speakerdeck.com/ashley920/into-the-fog-the-return-of-icefog-apt?slide=56)\nshare an unusual export “GetOfficeDatatal” and feature multiple\noverlaps with 2 QUICKHEAL samples reported by [FireEye in](https://speakerdeck.com/ashley920/into-the-fog-the-return-of-icefog-apt?slide=56)\nrelation to the WATERFIGHT and SKYLINE campaigns.\n\nOne of the notable code overlaps is a function that loads\nmemory addresses for SQLite and NSS functions, which are then\nused to parse, decode, and decrypt username and password\ncombinations from the victim’s Mozilla profiles. QUICKHEAL has\nalso continued to use code to check if the backdoor is running\nin a proxy, and shares a hardcoded User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0\n```\n(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.210.\n\n##### Royal Road, IceFog, and Poison Ivy\n\n```\nElements of RedFoxtrot’s use of the Royal Road RTF\nweaponizer to load the IceFog and Poison Ivy backdoors\nthroughout 2018 and 2019 have been [previously](https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain) [documented;](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\nhowever, we have not observed the group load other malware\nfamilies using Royal Road other than these 2. While wider use of\n[the Royal Road weaponizer by some Chinese groups is ongoing,](https://nao-sec.org/2021/01/royal-road-redive.html)\nits use by RedFoxtrot and several other China-linked groups has\ndropped since early 2020, likely in response to extensive public\nreporting. In addition to public reporting detailing the group’s use\nof these capabilities, further examples of RedFoxtrot’s historical\nuse of these tools to target Central Asia, Pakistan, and India\ninclude the following:\n\n  - A RedFoxtrot Royal Road sample\n\n(51e3f3a762ab6fb0c3db4819560c6b160\n7cdcd257ce375e68fdf1a17ff5c2cb5) from 2019 is\nlinked to the identified infrastructure cluster, with the\nC2 domain remaining active into late 2020. The RTF\ndocument title is “DYSL-QT_Slide_DMC_090719.doc”,\nwhich likely corresponds to the “Defence Research\nand Development Organisation (DRDO) Young Scientist\nLaboratory for Quantum Technologies” (DYSL-QT)\nlocated in Hyderabad, India. Additionally, DMC is likely\nin reference to the DRDO Management Council (DMC),\nsuggesting the group used this lure in activity targeting\nIndian defense research. The RTF document drops the\nsame Poison Ivy SKYLINE variant payload referenced\nearlier in the report (367718fd58c658dce22c995f3e10\nbc3a5425814ddf221686e166e3129a53e\n897), which is configured to communicate with the C2\ncapture.kozow[.]com.\n\n\n\n- Another RedFoxtrot domain, water.xxuz[.]com, is\n\n[linked to a historical Icefog sample (ICEFOG-P version)](https://speakerdeck.com/ashley920/into-the-fog-the-return-of-icefog-apt?slide=16)\n(SHA256: 0c596299c47ce6305e07f5\n5397fd69d49c8cab4f4b34a617bb6670dcaac9d9f2). This\nsample was likely used in the WATERFIGHT campaign.\n\n- Notably, 2 Royal Road lures used by the group in 2018\n\nand 2019 specifically reference 2 telecommunications\nproviders in Pakistan and India. We subsequently\nidentified 2021 intrusions targeting both of these\norganizations. While we cannot confirm whether\nthese previous intrusion attempts using Royal Road\nwere successful, it indicates that telecommunications\nproviders are a long term target of the group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy\n\nRecorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks\nthreat actors and their activity, focusing on state actors\nfrom China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cyber\ncriminals - individuals and groups - from Russia, CIS states,\nChina, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity\ngroups and where possible, attributing them to nation state\ngovernment, organizations, or affiliate institutions.\n\nOur coverage includes:\n\n\n**ADVERSARY**\n\n\n\n   - Government organizations and intelligence\nagencies, their associated laboratories, partners,\n\nindustry collaborators, proxy entities, and\nindividual threat actors.\n\n   - Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation\nstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,\nRedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many\nother industry established groups.\n\n   - Cybercriminal individuals and groups established\nand named by Recorded Future\n\n   - Newly emerging malware, as well as\nprolific,persistent commodity malware\n\nInsikt Group names a new threat activity group or\ncampaign when analysts have data corresponding to at\nleast three points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion\nAnalysis with at least medium confidence, derived from our\nSecurity Intelligence Graph. We can tie this to a threat actor\nonly when we can point to a handle, persona, person, or\norganization responsible. We will write about the activity as\na campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data.\nWe use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a\n\nparticular group when the public body of empirical evidence\nis clear the activity corresponds to a known group.\n\nInsikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet\nnaming convention for new nation state threat actor groups\nor campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag\ncolors, currently represented below, with more color/nation\npairings to be added as we identify and attribute new threat\nactor groups associated with new nations.\n\nFor newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt\nGroup uses a naming convention corresponding to the\nGreek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity\nconnected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate\ncountry color, and where that group may be tied to a specific\ngovernment organization, tie it to that entity specifically.\n\nInsikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming\nnewly identified malware.\n\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE** **CAPABILITY**\n\n**VICTIM**\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
