A few months later, the French National](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB94370)\n[Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) also released a short publication with several IoCs³, showing](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/ioc/CERTFR-2021-IOC-003/)\nthat the intrusion set was still active and of concern as multiple national agencies had been\ninvolved.\n\nAll of these IoCs were mainly IP addresses, and many of them seemed to be linked to\n**SOHO routers, mostly** [Pakedge routers at the time. With that observation, we investigated](https://pakedge.com/)\nmore deeply to see if we could find more infrastructure and implants used by this intrusion\nset.\n\n## A brief on the APT31 creature\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT31 (aka Zirconium or Judgment Panda) is an Advanced Persistent Threat group whose\nmission is likely to gather intelligence on behalf of the Chinese government. Similar to other\nnation-state actors, the group is focusing on data of interest to the PRC (People’s\nRepublic of China) and its strategic and geopolitical ambitions, rather than on specific\nverticals.\n\n**The Chinese adversaries are considered some of the most prolific state-sponsored**\n**cyber actors on the planet. According to Microsoft’s observations, from July 2020 to June**\n2021, China-based threat actors displayed the strongest interest in targeting critical\n[infrastructure among all the other nation-state threats⁴.](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi)\n\n_Figure 1. A timeline of the publicly reported APT31-related campaigns_\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 and in alignment with available public reports, APT31 has been active\nsince at least 2013 and its 2021 campaign targeting numerous French entities is still\nongoing.\n\n## BR|INT APT31\n\n[Download PDF version](https://info.sekoia.io/hubfs/%5BMarketing%5D%20-%20Ebook-analyse/BRINT%20APT31.pdf)\n\nEven if the public literature on this intrusion set is quite limited, APT31 is known to use —\namong others vectors — spear phishing to get a foothold in the victims’ networks. Although\n**their recent campaigns weren’t technically sophisticated, they succeeded in bypassing**\nnetwork defences by employing only legitimate websites and services to host their implants\n(GitHub) and interact with them once executed on the victims’ workstation (use of\n[DropBoxAPI)⁵. It has also been spotted targeting organizations via SQL injection attacks, as](https://www.zscaler.fr/blogs/security-research/apt-31-leverages-covid-19-vaccine-theme-and-abuses-legitimate-online)\nwell as leveraging stolen credentials to gain initial access.\n\n**APT31 and other Chinese state–backed actors have been lately the object of several**\n**European governments’ attribution statements. Back in July 2021, the UK accused the**\n[Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) of supporting the APT31 group’s activities⁶. At](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-a-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking)\nnearly the same time, the EU detected malicious cyber activities with significant effects that\n**[targeted key European industries and linked them to APT31⁷. In both cases, official](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/)**\nstatements mentioned APT31 alongside another Chinese attacker group — APT40.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, authorities suspect APT31 to be a group of contractors working directly for\n**China’s MSS, or even members of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support**\nForce, as reported by other sources.\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](http://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\n## Hunting in the APT31 infrastructure footprints\n\nAPT31 is one of the few intrusion sets known to have been seen compromising SOHO\nrouters to compose its operational infrastructure, since at least November 2019, date on\nwhich a sample of the backdoor used on compromised routers was uploaded to VirusTotal\nfor analysis (MD5: 77c73b8b1846652307862dd66ec09ebf). However, this implant can be\nmuch older as there is no compilation date associated with ELF files.\n\nThe Operational Relay Boxes (ORB) associated with this infrastructure are used as proxies\nfor frontal attacks, active and passive reconnaissance and also as command and control\nservers for several implants. Till today, we don’t know how they compromised these\n**routers. It is likely that they used a mix of known and unknown vulnerabilities to achieve**\nremote code execution in order to drop their implants and other redirector tools.\n\nWe found ways and heuristics to illuminate some parts of their infrastructure and track it over\ntime. The C2 domains used by this intrusion set have several characteristics such as:\n\nPatterns: lots of domains had technical strings such as “update”, “check”, “cloud” or\n“service” along with some IOT/router’s brands (Mikrotik, Netgear, Qnap, Nec).\n\nDNS configuration: most of them don’t resolve anything without an appropriate\nsubdomain such as “www”, “api”, “sso” etc.\n\nDNS providers: APT31 mainly uses four DNS providers: Monovm, Cloudflare, Topdns\nand most recently Hosteons, which we’ve seen used only for two domains so far.\n\nFake registrant and associated email: the name is mostly composed like a real name\n(eg. Joseph Edwards) with an associated email address using protonmail.ch, email.cz,\npost.cz or inbox.lv.\n\nThe resolution timeframe of these domains doesn’t exceed a few days, which is also\nrelevant from an analyst’s point of view.\n\nAs the domains were resolving to SOHO routers, it was also possible to track them using this\nparticularity. Indeed, it is relatively rare that a domain from these DNS providers points\n**to some domestic autonomous systems.**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, the network appliances compromised by APT31 have technical\ncharacteristics (eg. administration panels, specific certificates or banners) allowing anybody\nto recover thousands of IP addresses using them. By using passive DNS resolutions on\nthese IP addresses, it was possible to discover new C2s when an observed FQDN pointing\nto them had the previously mentioned characteristics.\n\nFinally, we discovered nearly 50 IP addresses and 34 domain names following ANSSI’s\npublication, with an overlap of one IP address resolved by the domain www.fwcheck[.]com.\nThe table below summarises the brands of network appliances that composed the C2\ninfrastructure used by APT31 until July 2021. The confidence value depends on the number\nof heuristics (explained above) that matched as well as on whether other sources already\nmentionned the C2 or not.\n\n**Brand seen on C2** **Number of C2s** **Confidence**\n\nPakedge 41 High\n\nCyberOAM 3 High\n\nNetgear VPN firewall 2 Low\n\nD-LINK 1 Low\n\nOthers 5 Low\n\nSince July 2021, we have observed a shift in their infrastructure. They left their historical\n**“Pakedge infrastructure” and moved it to new clusters composed this time of several other**\nbrands and nameservers in order to avoid infrastructure illumination by analysts.\n\nSince then, it has become more difficult to follow their tracks although we can still see\nseveral new C2s such as neccloud[.]net — resolving to 5.252.176[.]102, a server under the\nMivoCloud umbrella — or netgearcloud[.]net, resolving to a domestic IP address based in\nSweden on September 22, 2021. We link these domains to APT31 with high confidence as\nthey match most of the infrastructure heuristics established during the investigation.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that not all their Operational Relay Boxes are resolved by domains\nnames. Thenceforth, the IoCs list provided at the end of this blogpost is obviously nonexhaustive and shows only a small fraction of their operational infrastructure used for\nattacks in 2021.\n\nWebinar : How to improve the Analyst Experience with Sigma Correlation\n\nDate : May, 31st – 4:00pm\n\n**[SIGN IN](https://hubs.la/Q01bN6SD0)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Implants seen during the walk\n\nBy looking at the implants connecting to this infrastructure in open source, we have been\n**able to get several implants, that we assess were used by APT31 during their operations,**\nsuch as Cobalt Strike beacons and an ELF implant dubbed “unifi-video” (MD5:\n4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b), impersonating a well known IOT brand.\n\n_Figure 2. Links between some APT31 campaigns, indicators and malware/tools from_\n_[SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Center.](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--89f742c4-1479-4909-a348-b146bc92d28d)_\n\nAmong standard red-teaming tools, APT31 seems to be using Cobalt Strike as an n-stage\nimplant to persist inside the victim’s network. As shown in the table below, several beacons\nconnecting to the “Pakedge infrastructure” have been sent to VirusTotal packed in a PE to\nVirusTotal. It is worth noting that as they have been packed in an executable file, the\n**corresponding hash can’t be used to hunt for APT31 in your network.**\n\n**Packed beacons MD5 hashes** **Associated C2**\n\nf707759e05ab58296071ec50cc04c9fc fdexcute[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n**Packed beacons MD5 hashes** **Associated C2**\n\ndc30a177a104717d652a49887851f033 api[.]ontracting[.]com\n\n362057b23605d83130bdeac749d404f2 www[.]cypolicy[.]com\n\n0d71876ba535cde68c21aa9b3bb063d1 www[.]winservicecloud[.]com\n\nLast but not least, our Cobalt Strike trackers spotted two Cobalt Strike listeners on the\ndiscovered infrastructure:\n\n\n**Brand seen on C2**\n\n\n**Number of**\n**C2s** **Description**\n\n\nwww[.]gsncloud[.]com 68.146.18[.]127 Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 Jquery profile from\n22/03/2021 to 29/04/2021\n\napi[.]tfhjugo[.]com 83.81.73[.]23 Cobalt Strike default headers on port 443 from\n21/04/2021 to 17/05/2021\n\nUnfortunately, the configurations associated with the discovered Cobalt Strike beacons are\npretty common and prevented us from getting more discriminant indicators linked to their use\nof Cobalt Strike.\n\n[During the hunting, we found an ELF implant on VirusTotal⁸ which matched the C2 —](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e1999a3e5a611312e16bb65bb5a880dfedbab8d4d2c0a5d3ed1ed926a3f63e94/details)\nhardcoded in the sample — www[.]moperfectstore[.]com. We attribute this domain with\n**medium to high confidence to APT31 as it resolved to Pakedge and CyberOAM**\nappliances and matches some domain heuristics described above. As the domain didn’t\nhave any existence prior to 2021, we assess with medium to high confidence that the implant\nwas used by APT31.\n\nThis implant, dubbed “unifi-video” (MD5: 4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b), is a\nstatically-linked stripped 64bits ELF. Unifi-video is a well known legitimate software that\ndescribes itself as a “Centralized management system for Ubiquiti UniFi surveillance\ncameras”. It therefore echoes the compromised-appliance infrastructure used by APT31.\n\nWhen analysing the file we noticed several routines overlapping with a known minimalistic\nUnix backdoor named Rekoobe which was covered previously by a few cybersecurity\n[vendors such as Dr Web⁹ and Intezer¹⁰.](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=7754026&lng=en)\n\nHowever, several questions remain unanswered regarding the real APT31 and Rekoobe\nconnection.\n\nFirst, we don’t know at the time of writing whether Rekoobe’s source code is shared between\ndifferent threat actors or if Rekoobe has been operated by APT31 since it was first\ndiscovered in 2015. Moreover, if APT31 operated this sample of Rekoobe, there is no\n\n\n-----\n\n**indication whether this implant is used in the infrastructure or to persist in an**\n**appliance of a final victim, somewhere.**\n\nERRATUM (12/11/2021): While we initially thought that the implant\n(4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b) was linked to Rekoobe, the security researcher\n[Billy Leonard pointed out on Twitter [Billy Leonard’s tweet] that it was actually Tiny SHell](https://twitter.com/billyleonard/status/1458531997576572929)\n\n[[GitHub repo] which we definitely agree. Tiny SHell has been used by multiple threat actors](https://github.com/creaktive/tsh)\nsince several years now and it is not surprising to see APT31 using it.\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](http://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the lack of open source literature on this intrusion set, APT31 remains a prolific\n**threat for years for many occidental entities working on government and strategic**\n**issues. As of today, we don’t have a clear view of what they are looking for once they**\ncompromised the networks if it is for pre-positioning or data theft.\n\nThis blog post aimed to disclose some of their operational infrastructure and tools used this\nyear so that you can look for possible compromises in your networks.\n\nIf you are also investigating APT31, don’t hesitate to share your thoughts with us at\nthreatintel@sekoia.fr to better understand and track down their infrastructure.\n\n## External references\n\n**¹** [Bedrohung deutscher Stellen durch Cyberangriffe der Gruppierung APT31](https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/SharedDocs/publikationen/DE/2021/bfv-cyber-brief-2021-1.pdf)\n\n**²** [MVISION Insights: Potential APT31 Activity Against Political Targets,](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB94370)\n\n**³** [Campagne d’attaque du mode opératoire APT31 ciblant la France](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/ioc/CERTFR-2021-IOC-003/)\n\n⁴ [FY21 Microsoft Digital Defense Report](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi)\n\n⁵ [APT-31 Leverages COVID-19 Vaccine Theme and Abuses Legitimate Online Services](https://www.zscaler.fr/blogs/security-research/apt-31-leverages-covid-19-vaccine-theme-and-abuses-legitimate-online)\n\n⁶ [UK and allies hold Chinese state responsible for a pervasive pattern of hacking](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-a-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking)\n\n⁷ China: Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the European Union urging\n[Chinese authorities to take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from its](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/)\nterritory\n\n⁸ [Sample 4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e1999a3e5a611312e16bb65bb5a880dfedbab8d4d2c0a5d3ed1ed926a3f63e94/details)\n\n⁹ [Linux.Rekoobe.1](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=7754026&lng=en)\n\n\n-----\n\n⁰ [Linux Rekoobe Operating with New, Undetected Malware Samples](https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/linux-rekoobe-operating-with-new-undetected-malware-samples/)\n\n## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)\nNon-Application Layer Protocol (T1095)\nApplication Layer Protocol (T1071)\nProcess Injection (T1055)\nPhishing (T1566)\nCompromise Infrastructure (T1584)\nAcquire Infrastructure (T1583)\nDevelop Capabilities: Malware (T1587.001)\nObtain Capabilities: Malware (T1588.001)\n\n## IoCs\n\nThe IOCs are provided “as is”.
