    "plain_text": "# About The Pegasus Project\n\n**forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/**\n\nAn unprecedented leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected for surveillance by\nthe customers of the israeli company NSO Group shows how this technology has been\nsystematically abused for years. The Forbidden Stories consortium and Amnesty\nInternational had access to records of phone numbers selected by NSO clients in more than\n50 countries since 2016.\n\nNSO Group asserts that the product it sells to government clients – most commonly\nreferred to as Pegasus – is intended to “collect data from the mobile devices of specific\nindividuals, suspected to be involved in serious crime and terror.” Pegasus has extensive\ncapabilities: the spyware can be installed remotely on a smartphone without requiring any\naction from its owner. Once installed, it allows clients to take complete control of the\n**device, including accessing messages from encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and**\nSignal, and turning on the microphone and camera.\n\nThe Forbidden Stories consortium discovered that, contrary to what NSO Group has\nclaimed for many years, including in a recent transparency report, this spyware has been\n**widely misused. The leaked data showed that at least 180 journalists have been**\nselected as targets in countries like India, Mexico, Hungary, Morocco and France, among\n\n\n-----\n\nothers. Potential targets also include human rights defenders, academics,\n**businesspeople, lawyers, doctors, union leaders, diplomats, politicians and several**\n**heads of states.**\n\nIn a letter shared with Forbidden Stories and its partners, NSO Group contended that the\nconsortium’s reporting was based on “wrong assumptions” and “uncorroborated theories.”\nNSO Group insisted that the analysis of the data by journalists who were part of the\nPegasus Project relied on a “misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and\novert basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of\nthe customers targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products.”\n\nHLR refers to Home Location Register – a database that is essential to operating cellular\nphone networks. A person with direct knowledge of NSO’s systems, speaking on the\ncondition of anonymity, told journalists from the Pegasus Project that an HLR lookup is a\nkey step of determining certain characteristics of a phone, such as whether it is turned on or\nin a country that allows Pegasus targeting.\n\nAsked about those findings by Forbidden Stories, NSO Group denied and said “it will\ncontinue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action based on\nthe results of these investigations.”\n\nThe consortium met with victims from all over the world whose phone numbers appeared in\nthe data. The forensic analyses of their phones – conducted by Amnesty International’s\nSecurity Lab and peer-reviewed by the Canadian organization Citizen Lab – was able to\n**confirm an infection or attempted infection with NSO Group’s spyware in 85% of**\n**cases, or 37 in total. Such a rate is remarkably high given the state-of-the-art spyware is**\nsupposed to be undetectable on the device in compromises.\n\nJournalists from the Pegasus Project – more than 80 reporters from 17 media\n**organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories with the technical**\nsupport of Amnesty International’s Security Lab – sifted through these records of phone\nnumbers and were able to take a peak behind the curtain of this surveillance weapon, which\nhad never been possible to this extent before.\n\n**Among the victims were several journalists from the Pegasus Project, such as**\nSiddarth Varadarajan, an Indian investigative journalist and founder of the news site The\nWire, who was hacked in 2018 and Szabolcs Panyi, an investigative reporter for Direkt36 in\nHungary whose phone was compromised during a seven-month period in 2019.\n\nAll shared a general sense of powerlessness when informed about the cyber attacks they\nhad suffered. “We’ve been recommending each other this tool or that tool, how to keep [our\nphones] more and more secure from the eyes of the government,” Azerbaijani journalist\n\n\n-----\n\nKhadija Ismayilova said. And yesterday I realized that there is no way. Unless you lock\nyourself in [an] iron tent, there is no way that they will not interfere into your\ncommunications.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Security Lab also identified new ways through which Pegasus can\nbe installed on a phone, such as through a security flaw in iPhones that has been frequently\nused since 2019 and was still detected as recently as in July 2021. Well-informed sources\nshared concerns about countless vulnerabilities linked to Apple’s messaging service\n**iMessage, a problem they say has gotten worse over the years.**\n\nThe leaked data suggests that the spyware is used much more carelessly than advertised.\nIn the transparency report published in June 2021, the Israeli company stressed that\nPegasus was “not a mass surveillance technology” and was “used only where there [was] a\nlegitimate law enforcement or intelligence-driven reason.” Yet, more than 10,000 phone\n**numbers were selected for surveillance by NSO Group’s Moroccan client alone over**\n**a two-year period.**\n\nThe project shines a harsh light on the business of NSO Group, which, despite claiming it\nvets its clients based on their human rights track records, decided to sell its product to\nauthoritarian regimes such as Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\nInsiders disclosed the important role played by the Israeli Ministry of Defense when it\n**came to picking NSO Group’s clients. Multiple sources corroborated the fact that Israeli**\nauthorities pushed for Saudi Arabia to be added to the list of customers despite NSO\nGroup’s hesitations. The company’s lawyer denied “NSO Group takes governmental\ndirection regarding customers.”\n\nThe revelations stemming from this international collaborative investigation throw into\n**question the safeguards put in place to prevent misuse of cyber weapons like**\n**Pegasus and, more specifically, NSO Group’s commitment to creating “a better, safer**\nworld.”\n\nThe Pegasus Project media partners:\n**The Guardian, Le Monde, The Washington Post, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Die Zeit,**\n**Aristegui Noticias, Radio France, Proceso, OCCRP, Knack, Le Soir,**\n**Haaretz/TheMarker, The Wire, Daraj, Direkt36, PBS Frontline.**\n\nWith the technical support of Amnesty International’s Security Lab.\n\n## The Pegasus Project | All the articles\n\n\n-----",
