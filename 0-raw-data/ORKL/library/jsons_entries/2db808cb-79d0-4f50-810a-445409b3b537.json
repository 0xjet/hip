Executive Summary\n\nA victim called the incident response teams of Global Threat Center, reporting a seemingly\n\nnew stream of ransomware attack. Upon investigation, we determined the extension of the\n\nencrypted files was certainly new, but the malware displayed significant similarities with\n\nseveral ransomware families—a combination that made attribution an interesting and difficult\n\nriddle. The attack’s signature was a Music folder containing an arsenal of tools, which the\n\nmalware dropped and executed on each of the encrypted machines. Throughout our\n\ninvestigation, we primarily focused on the toolset utilized by the threat actor, in order to\n\nbuild an in-depth profile of the incident in hopes of making an attribution. While many of the\n\ntools used by the threat actor were not custom, we were still able to assemble a temporary\n\nportfolio of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which pointed us to potential links to\n\na few existing ransomware groups with similar TTPs. This portfolio was particularly helpful\n\nduring the negotiation process, as we were able to gain vital information, such as assessing\n\nthe reliability of the threat actor in terms of providing a working decryption tool. In fact,\n\nduring the negotiation, the attackers offered a video documenting the decryption process,\n\nwhich also revealed they used a free software from BandiCam and WinRAR, in what seems\n\nto be Arabic.\n\nThe ransomware had the extension “.ever101,” and was using the CryptoPP[8] library (an\n\ninbuilt C++ library) for encryption. It utilizes Salsa20 for encrypting file data, and RSA-2048\n\nfor encrypting file keys. We confirmed many—but not all—of the tools in the arsenal. Because\n\nthey were encrypted during the attack, we had little hope of discovering their origin. We\n\nwere able to establish that the EVER101 ransomware is almost identical to a number of\n\nransomware families, such as CURATOR and Paymen45, both of which are believed to be\n\ndeveloped by the EverBe group. Our hypothesis is that this ransomware was built through a\n\n\"Ransomware-as-a-Service\" builder, rather than being fully developed by the threat actor or\n\ngroup, whose identity and location remain unknown.\n\nDuring our investigation of the bitcoin movement related to the attack, we made an\n\ninteresting discovery of a transfer of approximately US$600, to a platform of massage\n\nproviders across major cities in the United States. This gave us a specific lead to the threat\n\nactors, and we developed potential explanations for this questionable transfer.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 2\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n###### 1.

Technical Details\n\n##### 2.1 Discovered Tools\n\nDuring our investigation of the infected machines, we came across what seemed to be a\n\ntreasure trove of information stored in the Music folder. It consisted of the ransomware\n\nbinary itself, along with several other files—some encrypted, some not—that we believe the\n\nthreat actors used to gather intelligence and propagate through the network.\n\n##### 2.2 Confirmed\n\n**xDedicLogCleaner.exe**\n\nxDedicLogCleaner[1], as the name suggests, is used to clear any logs on the system—\n\nsomething that commonly occurs during ransomware attacks. Such tools are used to remove\n\nall traces of the attacker on the machine. In this case, however, they did not wipe their\n\ntools from one of the infected machines. Instead, most of these tools were encrypted once\n\nthe ransomware was executed. The ransomware binary was still present on the machine that\n\nwasn’t wiped, a stroke of good luck that allowed us to expand our investigation.\n\n**PH64.exe**\n\nPH64.exe is a copy of the ProcessHacker[2] binary. ProcessHacker allows users to gather\n\ninformation about the system, such as running processes, services, incoming and outgoing\n\nnetwork connections, and more. It is quite unusual for it to appear in a ransomware incident.\n\nWe assume it helped the attackers gain basic information about any anti-malware software\n\nrunning on the machine—because ProcessHacker is a legitimate binary, it doesn’t trigger\n\nmonitoring software.\n\n##### 2.3 Unconfirmed\n\n**SoftPerfect Network Scanner**\n\nThis tool is considered unconfirmed because a large majority of the attacker’s tools were\n\nencrypted with the ransomware. Therefore, the file names were our only lead. In the case of\n\nthe SoftPerfect Network Scanner,[3] we discovered three encrypted files on one of the\n\nmachines that had similar names to files dropped by the scanner. Specifically:\n\nnetscan.exe\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 4\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nnetscan.xml\n\nnetscan.lic\n\nWe correlated these file names with a report[4] produced by the US-Cybersecurity and\n\nInfrastructure Security Agency, which covered the Five-Hands Ransomware, along with the\n\ntools used in this attack.\n\n**shadow.bat**\n\nOnce again, we discovered this file in an encrypted state on one of the infected machines.\n\nWhile decryption was not possible without a decryptor, we can make assumptions based on\n\nthe file name, as we found a link between this specific file name and a previous\n\nransomware infection.\n\nA write-up[5] of an unsuccessful Dharma Ransomware deployment by The DFIR Report\n\ndescribes a case in which a .BAT file named shadow.bat was deployed. It deleted the\n\nshadow files on the machine, using the following command:\n```\n        vssadmin delete shadows /all\n\n```\nWhile there is a strong likelihood the files are the same, it would be surprising, as the\n\nransomware used in our case has built-in function to destroy shadow files. This could\n\nindicate that the threat actor possessed limited knowledge of their ransomware variant, or\n\nperhaps they used the script as a \"backup\" method, in the event the ransomware function\n\nfailed.\n\n**NetworkShare_pre2.exe**\n\nThis is another unconfirmed tool, as it was also encrypted on disk. However, we were able\n\nto find a similarly named tool uploaded to an online sandbox provider, where it was\n\nexecuted and analyzed. The discovered tool was labelled as a \"NetTool\", and in researching\n\nthe file, we linked it to the same report by The DFIR Report mentioned above. In this\n\nincident, the same hash is found, linked to a binary named \"NS.exe\", which is a network\n\nenumeration and pivoting tool. This tool is definitely not custom made — it’s commonly used\n\nby threat actors to enumerate a network for shared folders and connected devices.\n\nThere were several other tools on the machine, but because they were overwritten by the\n\nransomware, and had fairly non-descriptive names, we were unable to pinpoint their exact\n\npurpose, aside from disabling Windows Defender and clearing more logs.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 5\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3. Infection Chain\n\n##### 3.1 Cobalt Strike\n\nCobalt Strike[6] is an offensive security tool developed for legitimate purposes, though it has\n\nbecome a \"go-to\" tool for ransomware operators. It provides remote access to infected\n\nmachines and allows attackers to gather comprehensive information on the system and\n\nsurrounding network, as well as execute commands, drop files, escalate privileges, exfiltrate\n\nimportant documents, and so on.\n\nIn this particular case, the Cobalt Strike beacon was hidden inside a binary masquerading\n\nas WEXTRACT.exe. The binary had a signature that matched the publisher of the original\n\nWEXTRACT.exe—Microsoft Windows—however, the certificate expired in 2015. Therefore, any\n\ncertificate checkers would simply identify the expired certificate rather than the modified\n\ncode.\n\nSnippet of heavily obfuscated code present in modified WEXTRACT.exe\n\nThis method of hiding a beacon is quite interesting: before this case, there is no\n\ndocumentation of its use. It is also not mentioned in the Cobalt Strike documentation. This\n\nperhaps indicates the presence of a public \"builder\" who implants obfuscated code into a\n\nlegitimate binary, which decodes and executes a beacon in the device’s memory, or the\n\npossibility of a custom tool developed by the ransomware actors. Either way, this knowledge\n\nwill be hugely beneficial to us in future investigations, as we will be able to leverage this\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 6\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\ntechnique to create rules for further threat intelligence gathering on the threat actors behind\n\nthis infection.\n\n##### 3.2 SystemBC\n\nSystemBC[7] is a well-known proxy malware used to route incoming and outgoing connections\n\nthrough SOCKS5, during attempts to hide communications between a malware implant and a\n\ncommand and control server. Additionally, it can be used to proxy internal connections.\n\nSystemBC is a fairly old tool, but it’s becoming increasingly popular among ransomware\n\nactors as a method of hiding Cobalt Strike beacon traffic from network traffic analyzers.\n\nConfiguration present in SystemBC\n\nThis tool, along with Cobalt Strike, was discovered in the Windows Startup folder, which is a\n\ncommon method of persistence. Upon system start-up, any programs within the folder will be\n\nimmediately executed even without user interaction. This method is fairly simple and\n\nextremely easy to detect—raising questions about the aptitude of the threat actors.\n\n##### 3.3 Ransomware Analysis\n\n###### Capabilities Overview\n\nThe Ransomware itself is fairly basic. As mentioned above, it utilizes the CryptoPP[8] library\n\n(an inbuilt C++ library) for encryption, Salsa20 for encrypting file data, and RSA-2048 for\n\nencrypting file keys. This usage of asymmetric algorithms makes decryption of the files\n\nimpossible without the attackers’ RSA-2048 private key. This private key decrypts the\n\nencrypted Salsa20 file keys, which in turn enables decryption of the file data.\n\nIt also has capabilities allowing it to connect to remote servers, and send information about\n\nthe system, such as the number of files and disks and data related to the CPU and RAM.\n\nIn this particular case, a URL was not present in the binary, meaning the malware operated\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 7\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nentirely offline. This is probably due to the fact that Cobalt Strike was already on the\n\nmachine prior to the ransomware roll-out.\n\nTemplate used for sending data to a remote server\n\nThe ransomware is not only able to send information to remote servers, it can also\n\ndownload the Tor browser to gather information from a .ONION site that is most likely\n\nhosted by the threat actors. As no URL was present in the sample, we cannot confirm all\n\nits capabilities, though it does seem the downloading functionality is used to download a\n\npublic RSA-2048 key, possibly to prevent the entry of any hardcoded public keys into the\n\nfile.\n\nInternet Accessibility inside ransomware\n\nFinally, as mentioned above, the ransomware has the ability to clear shadow files,\n\npreventing any attempts to backup. The command to execute occurs through Windows API,\n\nand is stored in an encoded state before being decoded and executed. The encoding itself\n\nwas custom developed, rather than originating from well-known algorithms, which enabled us\n\nto progress our investigation of further threats.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 8\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Algorithm Analysis\n\nBecause the ransomware uses RSA-2048 and Salsa20 to perform file encryption, a public\n\nRSA key is hardcoded into the binary, and stored in a hexadecimal encoded format—an\n\nexample of which can be seen below. This RSA key is stored as a Microsoft\n\nPUBLICKEYBLOB[9], allowing it to be imported using Windows API.\n\nRSA-2048 encryption and hexadecimal encoding of generated Salsa20 key\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 9\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike several other ransomware variants, this variant generates only a single Salsa20 key\n\non each run. This means all files on a particular system will be encrypted using the same\n\nSalsa20 key. The key is generated through several calls in the CryptoPP library, alongside\n\nthe CryptGenRandom() call. Once generated, it is immediately encrypted with the hardcoded\n\nRSA-2048 key, and then converted into a hexadecimal format—similar to the format of the\n\nstored RSA key. This newly created hexadecimal blob is then appended to all encrypted\n\nfiles, allowing the decryption tool to extract the last 512 bytes of a file, decrypt it using the\n\nattackers’ RSA private key, and gain the file’s Salsa20 key.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 10\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4. Threat Intelligence\n\n##### 4.1 Decryption Tutorial\n\n###### After requesting proof-of-concept for the decryption process, the attackers did something\n\n unexpected. They sent an mp4 file with the name “LOOK!” containing a short video\n\n (1:29 min) of how the files are decrypted. The tutorial contains a few interesting details,\n\n including the fact that they chose to use WinRaR in Arabic. Although it does not offer a\n\n specific lead, it is worth mentioning as their language is one of the few hints we have\n\n for attribution. \n\n Threat actor using WinRaR in Arabic \n\n In addition, the video was captured using a free software called BandiCam. This\n\n software was spotted on other occasions when attackers used it to record tutorials.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 11\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat Actor using BandiCam free software for video tutorial\n\n##### 4.2 Code Similarity\n\nDuring our investigation, we noticed the encoding algorithm for the command to delete\n\nshadow files did not match any well-known encoding algorithms, leading us to look into its\n\norigins. We were able to locate this algorithm in a number of files, all red-flagged as\n\nransomware. We reverse-engineered these files, and confirmed that the EVER101\n\nransomware is almost identical to a number of ransomware families, most especially\n\nCURATOR and Paymen45. Therefore, we feel confident in concluding that this particular\n\nransomware was most likely built through a \"Ransomware-as-a-Service\" builder, rather than\n\nbeing fully developed by the threat actors.\n\nLeft: Paymen45 encoding algorithm    Right: EVER101 encoding algorithm\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 12\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### 5. Decryptor Analysis\n\nOnce the decryptor was received, we focused our efforts on analyzing whether it functioned\n\nas the threat actors promised—or whether it contained anything malicious. We discovered that\n\nthe threat actors, in a surprising move, used multiple RSA public-private key pairs across\n\nthe infected machines, which we were unable to retrieve based on our investigation of the\n\none recovered sample.\n\nOverview of decryption function present in decryption tool\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 13\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decryptor itself is simply a reversed version of the ransomware. It uses the on-board\n\nRSA-2048 private key (stored in a section labelled .INFO) to decrypt any files that match a\n\nhardcoded specification (appended with the .EVER101 extension), which then decrypt the\n\nhexadecimal blob appended to the file, in order to obtain the Salsa20 file key. As Salsa20\n\nis a symmetric algorithm, the same key used for encryption is used for decryption. From\n\nthere, it will overwrite the encrypted file with the decrypted data, and move onto the next\n\nfile. Additionally, it deletes all files with the name !=READMY=!.txt, thus removing any\n\nevidence of the prior ransomware infection.\n\nHardcoded RSA Private Key inside .INFO section\n\nComparison of the received decryption tools indicated that the only change across all\n\nbinaries was the .INFO section, which contains three basic pieces of information: the RSA-\n\n2048 private key, the file extension to be identified, and the ransom note file name. This\n\nfurther indicates the likely usage of a ransomware builder by the threat actors, as this\n\ninformation could all be incorporated in the main code base, rather than being appended to\n\nthe binary—which is highly unusual.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 14\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### 6. Bitcoin Tracing\n\n###### Once the ransom was paid, we continued tracing the movement of the bitcoin, using\n\n CipherTrace, to investigate where the coins were flowing to. In general, the movement\n\n did not seem sophisticated, unlike prior cases in which several services were used to\n\n convert one currency to another. However, we did make one fascinating discovery. \n\nBitcoin Movement as shown by CipherTrace\n\nOne of the branches in the CipherTrace graph indicate that on May 18, 2020, 0.01378880\n\nBTC was transferred to a wallet (around US$590) linked to a site called RubRatings. The\n\nsite describes itself as a “platform of providers offering body rubs and sensual massages to\n\nclients in major cities across the US.” The wallet in question seems to link to a Tip Jar\n\nfunctionality available on the site, which provides a method for clients to send bitcoin to\n\nspecific individuals.\n\nCopyright\n\nPage 15\n\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nThis discovery suggests of one of two possibilities. The first is that the threat actor(s) are\n\nnew to the game, and they thought the bitcoin had been hidden successfully. As a result,\n\nthey decided to pay for services provided through the site, through the Tip Jar functionality\n\nor through direct communication with the provider. This would indicate that the attackers are\n\nUS-based, as the site only provides services to clients in American cities.\n\nThe second possibility is that the provider on the site was used as another method of\n\nobfuscating the bitcoin movement. It could be that the provider who possesses the bitcoin\n\nwallet in question was working with the threat actor(s), but more likely, it is a fake account\n\nset up to enable money transfers. The bitcoin in the wallet linked to RubRatings received\n\nthe payment around 15:48 UTC, and it left the wallet just a few minutes later, at 15:51\n\nUTC.\n\nAs of now, we cannot be sure of the processes that individual tips follow, whether the\n\nwallets are linked to the site operator and are then distributed to the provider in question, or\n\nif it was the provider who moved it out quickly.
