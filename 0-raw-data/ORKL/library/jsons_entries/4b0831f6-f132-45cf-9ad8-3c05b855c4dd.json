In a\nseparate action, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials worked together to seize\ncomputer servers central to the malicious software or “malware” known as Cryptolocker, a\nform of “ransomware” that encrypts the files on victims’ computers until they pay a ransom.\n\nDeputy Attorney General James M. Cole, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of\nthe Justice Department’s Criminal Division, FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert\nAnderson Jr., U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton of the Western District of Pennsylvania, U.S.\nAttorney Deborah R. Gilg of the District of Nebraska, and Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s (DHS) Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Phyllis Schneck made the announcement.\n\n\n-----\n\nVictims of Gameover Zeus may use the following website created by DHS s Computer\nEmergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) for assistance in removing the malware:\n[https://www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus .](https://www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus)\n\n“This operation disrupted a global botnet that had stolen millions from businesses and\nconsumers as well as a complex ransomware scheme that secretly encrypted hard drives\nand then demanded payments for giving users access to their own files and data,” said\nDeputy Attorney General Cole. “We succeeded in disabling Gameover Zeus and\nCryptolocker only because we blended innovative legal and technical tactics with traditional\nlaw enforcement tools and developed strong working relationships with private industry\nexperts and law enforcement counterparts in more than 10 countries\n\naround the world.”\n\n“These schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative, and the cyber criminals\ndid not make them easy to reach or disrupt,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. “But\nunder the leadership of the Justice Department, U.S. law enforcement, foreign partners in\nmore than 10 different countries and numerous private sector partners joined together to\ndisrupt both these schemes. Through these court-authorized operations, we have started to\nrepair the damage the cyber criminals have caused over the past few years, we are helping\nvictims regain control of their own computers, and we are protecting future potential victims\nfrom attack.”\n\n“Gameover Zeus is the most sophisticated botnet the FBI and our allies have ever attempted\nto disrupt,” said FBI Executive Assistant Director Anderson. “The efforts announced today\nare a direct result of the effective relationships we have with our partners in the private\nsector, international law enforcement, and within the U.S. government.”\n\n“The borderless, insidious nature of computer hacking and cybertheft requires us to be bold\nand imaginative,” said U.S. Attorney Hickton. “We take this action on behalf of hundreds of\nthousands of computer users who were unwittingly infected and victimized.”\n\n“The sophisticated computer malware targeting of U.S. victims by a global criminal enterprise\ndemonstrates the grave threat of cybercrime to our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Gilg. “We\nare grateful for the outstanding collaboration of our international and U.S. law enforcement\npartners in this successful investigation.”\n\n“The FBI has demonstrated great leadership in continuing to help combat cyber crime, and\nour international and private sector partners have made enormous contributions as well,”\nsaid Deputy Under Secretary Schneck. “This collective effort reflects our ‘whole-ofgovernment’ approach to cybersecurity. DHS is proud to support our partners in helping to\nidentify compromised computers, sharing that information rapidly, and developing useful\ninformation and mitigation strategies to help the owners of hacked systems.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Gameover Zeus Administrator Charged_\n\nA federal grand jury in Pittsburgh unsealed a 14-count indictment against Evgeniy\nMikhailovich Bogachev, 30, of Anapa, Russian Federation, charging him with conspiracy,\ncomputer hacking, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in connection with his\nalleged role as an administrator of the Gameover Zeus botnet. Bogachev was also charged\nby criminal complaint in Omaha with conspiracy to commit bank fraud related to his alleged\ninvolvement in the operation of a prior variant of Zeus malware known as “Jabber Zeus.”\n\nIn a separate civil injunction application filed by the United States in federal court in\nPittsburgh, Bogachev is identified as a leader of a tightly knit gang of cyber criminals based\nin Russia and Ukraine that is responsible for the development and operation of both the\nGameover Zeus and Cryptolocker schemes. An investigation led in Washington, D.C.,\nidentified the Gameover Zeus network as a common distribution mechanism for\nCryptolocker. Unsolicited emails containing an infected file purporting to be a voicemail or\nshipping confirmation are also widely used to distribute Cryptolocker. When opened, those\nattachments infect victims’ computers. Bogachev is alleged in the civil filing to be an\nadministrator of both Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker. The injunction filing further alleges\nthat Bogachev is linked to the well-known online nicknames “Slavik” and “Pollingsoon,”\namong others. The criminal complaint filed in Omaha alleges that Bogachev also used\n“Lucky12345,” a well-known online moniker previously the subject of criminal charges in\nSeptember 2012 that were unsealed in Omaha on April 11, 2014.\n\n_Disruption of Gameover Zeus Botnet_\n\nGameover Zeus, also known as “Peer-to-Peer Zeus,” is an extremely sophisticated type of\nmalware designed to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects.\nUnknown to their rightful owners, the infected computers also secretly become part of a\nglobal network of compromised computers known as a “botnet,” a powerful online tool that\ncyber criminals can use for numerous criminal purposes besides stealing confidential\ninformation from the infected machines themselves. Gameover Zeus, which first emerged\naround September 2011, is the latest version of Zeus malware that began appearing at least\nas early as 2007. Gameover Zeus’s decentralized, peer-to-peer structure differentiates it\nfrom earlier Zeus variants. Security researchers estimate that between 500,000 and 1 million\ncomputers worldwide are infected with Gameover Zeus, and that approximately 25 percent\nof the infected computers are located in the United States. The principal purpose of the\nbotnet is to capture banking credentials from infected computers. Those credentials are then\nused to initiate or re-direct wire transfers to accounts overseas that are controlled by cyber\ncriminals. The FBI estimates that Gameover Zeus is responsible for more than $100 million\nin losses.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Gameover Zeus botnet operates silently on victim computers by directing those\ncomputers to reach out to receive commands from other computers in the botnet and to\nfunnel stolen banking credentials back to the criminals who control the botnet. For this\nreason, in addition to the criminal charges announced today, the United States obtained civil\nand criminal court orders in federal court in Pittsburgh authorizing measures to redirect the\nautomated requests by victim computers for additional instructions away from the criminal\noperators to substitute servers established pursuant to court order. The order authorizes the\nFBI to obtain the Internet Protocol addresses of the victim computers reaching out to the\nsubstitute servers and to provide that information to US-CERT to distribute to other countries’\nCERTS and private industry to assist victims in removing the Gameover Zeus malware from\ntheir computers. At no point during the operation did the FBI or law enforcement access the\ncontent of any of the victims' computers or electronic communications.\n\nBesides the United States, law enforcement from the Australian Federal Police; the National\nPolice of the Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit; European Cybercrime Centre\n(EC3); Germany’s Bundeskriminalamt; France’s Police Judiciare; Italy’s Polizia Postale e\ndelle Comunicazioni; Japan’s National Police Agency; Luxembourg’s Police Grand Ducale;\nNew Zealand Police; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal\nAffairs – Division for Combating Cyber Crime; and the United Kingdom’s National Crime\nAgency participated in the operation. The Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense also participated in the investigation.\n\nInvaluable technical assistance was provided by Dell SecureWorks and CrowdStrike.\nNumerous other companies also provided assistance, including facilitating efforts by victims\nto remediate the damage to their computers inflicted by Gameover Zeus. These companies\ninclude Microsoft Corporation, Abuse.ch, Afilias, F-Secure, Level 3 Communications,\nMcAfee, Neustar, Shadowserver, Anubis Networks, Symantec, Heimdal Security, Sophos\nand Trend Micro.\n\nThe DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which\nhouses the US-CERT, plays a key role in\n\ntriaging and collaboratively responding to the threat by providing technical assistance to\ninformation system operators, disseminating timely mitigation strategies to known victims,\nand sharing actionable information to the broader community to help prevent further\ninfections.\n\n_Disruption of Cryptolocker_\n\nIn addition to the disruption operation against Gameover Zeus, the Justice Department led a\nseparate multi-national action to disrupt the malware known as Cryptolocker (sometimes\n\n\n-----\n\nwritten as CryptoLocker ), which began appearing about September 2013 and is also a\nhighly sophisticated malware that uses cryptographic key pairs to encrypt the computer files\nof its victims. Victims are forced to pay hundreds of dollars and often as much as $700 or\nmore to receive the key necessary to unlock their files. If the victim does not pay the ransom,\nit is impossible to recover their files.\n\nSecurity researchers estimate that, as of April 2014, Cryptolocker had infected more than\n234,000 computers, with approximately half of those in the United States. One estimate\nindicates that more than $27 million in ransom payments were made in just the first two\nmonths since Cryptolocker emerged.\n\nThe law enforcement actions against Cryptolocker are the result of an ongoing criminal\ninvestigation by the FBI’s Washington Field Office, in coordination with law enforcement\ncounterparts from Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and\nUkraine.\n\nCompanies such as Dell SecureWorks and Deloitte Cyber Risk Services also assisted in the\noperation against Cryptolocker, as did Carnegie Mellon University and the Georgia Institute\nof Technology (Georgia Tech). The joint effort aided the FBI in identifying and seizing\ncomputer servers acting as command and control hubs for the Cryptolocker malware.\n\nThe FBI’s Omaha and Pittsburgh Field Offices led both malware disruptions and conducted\nthe investigation of Bogachev. The prosecution in Pittsburgh is being handled by Assistant\nU.S. Attorney Shardul Desai of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the prosecution in\nOmaha by Trial Attorney William A. Hall of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Russell of the\nDistrict of Nebraska. The civil action to disrupt the Gameover Zeus botnet and Cryptolocker\nmalware is led by Trial Attorneys Ethan Arenson and David Aaron of CCIPS and Assistant\nU.S. Attorney Michael A. Comber of the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance\nthroughout the criminal and civil investigations.\n\nThe details contained in the indictment, criminal complaint and related pleadings are\n\nmerely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nAnyone claiming an interest in any of the property seized or actions enjoined pursuant to the\ncourt orders described in this release is advised to visit the following website for notice of the\n[full contents of the orders: http://www.justice.gov/opa/gameover-zeus.html .](https://www.justice.gov/opa/gameover-zeus.html)\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[Criminal Division](http://www.justice.gov/criminal/)\n\n\n-----\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n14-584\n\n\n-----",
