    "plain_text": "# REvil: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses\n\n**[digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/revil-analysis-of-competing-hypotheses/](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/revil-analysis-of-competing-hypotheses/)**\n\nJuly 28, 2021\n\nUntil the 13th of July, 2021, things appeared to be going as expected with the threat actors\nbehind REvil (AKA Sodinokibi) ransomware. Then, suddenly, the fairly public group\nvanished. With them disappeared their notorious “Happy Blog,” payment page, and other\ninfrastructure that supported their ransomware and extortion operations. That same day, their\n[primary representative was banned on the popular Russian-language forum XSS where](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/forums-are-forever-part-1-cybercrime-never-dies/)\nthey’d been a fixture since the inception of their brand of ransomware.\n\nToday, there is still a lot of speculation on the whereabouts of REvil, and many great minds\nhave some pretty informed hot takes.\n\nWas it…\n\nLaw enforcement?\nA rebrand?\nToo much notoriety?\nTake the money and run?\n\nSince there’s been no official conclusion to this story, we at Digital Shadows performed the\nancient intelligence ritual known as the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) to see\nall the perspectives around specific events and moments that may help shed light on a most\nlikely outcome.\n\n_Spoiler alert: We’re still not entirely sure. Also, this is still just, like, our opinion, man, so_\n_please take it with a grain of salt._\n\n\n-----\n\n## What is an ACH?\n\nAn analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) is typically a tabletop exercise that gathers\nintelligence analysts in a dark, smoke-filled room or a cave for hours to days at a time for a\nreasoned discussion. Much of the talk is usually based on what we’ve seen or learned over\ntime about this particular actor, which includes our observations, as well as outsiders’. With\nan ACH, it’s not about the most correct hypothesis, as all hypotheses hold the same weight;\nit’s about which one(s) you might be able to prove.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into our six “competing” hypotheses belo\n\n## Hypothesis 1: Law Enforcement Action\n\nThis scenario so far is one of the top contenders, mainly because there is so much\nconvincing evidence that points to law enforcement action:\n\n**Point: Speed of site outage**\n\nFor starters, the speed at which all of the sites went down. It’s not uncommon for actors to\nrun into technical problems, either because of Tor’s limitations or an unforeseen application\nor coding issue. The fact that everything was gone so quickly and seemingly under cover of\ndarkness seemed different.\n\nNot to mention, REvil’s sites were observed to be more stable than most, so an outage\nlasting longer than 24 hours was a little out of character for the group. When you consider\nthat “Unknown,” their forum representative, was banned on the same day, it also lends some\ncredence to the theory Typically forum bans are not to be taken lightly Bans are rarely done\n\n\n-----\n\nby request and usually occur because of some arbitration issue. The user was called out for\nbeing suspicious, or there’s a question of law enforcement having access to a forum\npersona.\n\n**Point: Increased government rhetoric**\n\nSecond, there’s a combination of public factors that also contribute to this outcome. In the\nwake of the G7 summit, there was a PR-like Russian media release where the Russian FSB\ndirector stated he was ready to work with US law enforcement in the struggle with\nransomware.\n\nCoincidentally, the Biden administration and various government agencies stepped up\nrhetoric particularly against ransomware, which would be seen more as a terrorist attack if\nperformed against critical infrastructure. There were also calls in the media to involve the\nintelligence community because of the aforementioned tougher stance on ransomware.\n\n**Point: Removal of REvil branding**\n\nFinally, in the underground itself, the actor behind Prometheus ransomware broadcast their\naffiliation with REvil until the week they went silent. The newest branding for Prometheus\nremoved any mentions of REvil, and they have historically been one of the more staunch\naffiliates with REvil.\n\nHow it started (top), and how it’s going (bottom) with\n\nPrometheus and REvil.\nREvil themselves have never been shy in the spotlight. In the aftermath of Colonial Pipeline,\nthey openly bragged about how good the business was getting, in terms of money to be\nmade, as well as the number of affiliates. They also were unconcerned about the forum bans\nand rising US pressure and rhetoric. They also removed any restrictions on targets:\nEverything was fair game. Talk like that would seem to draw more attention, which does raise\nthe possibility that maybe a law enforcement organization received their orders after\nsomeone reached the “enough” point.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Counterpoint: No claimants as of yet**\n\nWhat is working against these theories are a few possibilities. Namely, in the wake of every\nsignificant takedown in recent years, law enforcement also hasn’t been shy to take any\ncredit. In past operations, we’ve seen government banners plastered across sites when\nthey’re taken down, public indictments against operators in various courts, and press\nreleases hitting major outlets.\n\nSeveral countries outside of the usual US and Five-Eyes axis have had several significant\narrests in recent years, often announcing them as they happen or while the flash-bang\ngrenades are still cooling off on the ground. That still hasn’t happened. Though the FBI is\nnotoriously quiet about current operations, they do announce when something big happens.\nWe knew when the FBI was able to seize funds from the Colonial Incident with DarkSide.\nHowever, REvil’s wallets are still just sitting there. While this could point to a still ongoing\noperation or even a more extensive involvement from an intelligence agency,the thought is\n_something would’ve leaked somewhere by now in 2021._\n\n**Verdict: Likely, but some evidence contributes to arguments for other outcomes.**\n\n## Hypothesis 2: Technical Difficulties\n\n**Point: Technical difficulties are commonplace**\n\nThis theory presents some problems, namely, not having complete insight into the skills and\nabilities of the actual REvil operators. Also, not knowing what the entire infrastructure even\nlooks like may be problematic. It’s realistically possible that even ransomware operators have\nshadow IT, or otherwise offsite content and hardware that is separate from the known sites\nsuch as “Happy Blog,” and we may not know all of the forum personas.\n\n**Counterpoint: No historical technical issues regarding REvil**\n\nWe know that, as a general observation, their infrastructure hasn’t had much downtime\ncompared to others. Any site downtime lasting more than a day just has not been seen often,\nmuch less on all of their known public sites at the same time. Again, this lends weight to the\nlaw enforcement theory, but it could also mean a step back to rebrand or retool.\n\nWhile there is a possibility that some internal strife or maybe just better job offers elsewhere\nfor key support personnel caused everything to go down at once, the analyst in me is saying\nthat there would’ve been a reflection of that somewhere on the forums. People are generally\nterrible with secrets, so someone would’ve talked about it by now.\n\n**Verdict: Probable but difficult to prove without further insights.**\n\n## Hypothesis 3: Strife\n\n\n-----\n\n**Point: Business disagreements increase with more members and affiliates**\n\nHave you ever had coworkers or management you couldn’t stand? Or maybe just got tired of\nthe job or the company? There’s a good chance that ransomware operators go through the\nsame thing. One of the arguments we’d discussed on the technical difficulties aspect was the\npossibility of certain group members leaving to seek their fortunes elsewhere, which would\nleave the sites, infrastructure, or any development adrift. Some thoughts about this led to\nmore of the specific emotions for members and affiliates of the group. Maybe there was a socalled “old guard” who didn’t care for current business practices, or perhaps suspicions of\nlaw enforcement involvement or pressure on other members. Maybe trying to manage the\naffiliates on top of all the day-to-day work became too much.\n\n**Counterpoint: Respect and arbitration on forums**\n\nThere is evidence of strife between actors on forums, and REvil was no stranger to this.\nDigital Shadows had previously observed some public disagreements with affiliates, as well\nas accusations around mismanagement of funds. There were also some open arbitration\ncases over time, which in itself is not uncommon on forums. However, these were resolved\naround the time of REvil going dark. However, the group has had a decently long tenure and\ngenerally acted quickly to quash instability. There was also a sense of respect on the forums\nsince they did participate in forum life, which usually involves discussions about other topics\nand business outside of ransomware.\n\n**Counterpoint: The money is good**\n\nAlso, in June, there was the aforementioned interview with lots of boasts about business\ndoing well with plenty of affiliates. While there is an ethos among forum members, again, this\nfeels like something that would’ve had some reflection in forum chatter or other media two\nweeks later. People talk, and gossip is a byproduct of that communication, but nothing’s\nbeen seen yet. So either there’s an excellent NDA (nondisclosure agreement) in place, or\nnothing’s happened in this particular vein.\n\n**Counterpoint: It takes a warrant**\n\nThe problem with proving any of this requires greater insight into the inner workings of the\ngroup itself. Going that deep requires relationship-building, whether at a business or\npersonal level, and understanding the personalities of the group itself. Short of that, those\ninsights may be seen piecemeal by analyzing public statements over time; otherwise, only\nsomeone with a wiretap would be able to see what’s behind the scenes and not on the\nforums.\n\n**Verdict: Probable, but need a better understanding of the human elements at work.**\n\n## Hypothesis 4: Rebrand\n\n\n-----\n\n**Point: Rebrands are in fashion**\n\nActors typically would need to establish some credibility and reputation for a rebrand or\nretooling of sorts, so something to watch out for would be some kind of public announcement\nstating a new ransomware variant is available, and it’s from the team that brought you REvil.\nThere may be calls for new affiliates or investment into the business. Since we haven’t seen\nthat yet, this remains just a theory.\n\nGiven some of the recent talk from governments and media about REvil, there’s a possibility\nthat the newest REvil product is hiding right under our noses. Or, the heat may be too great,\nso this is also driving the need for a bit of silence on the part of REvil. Prometheus’s recent\nrebrand might indicate this was happening, but we have yet to see anything mentioned on\nRAMP, the newest forum, or any chatter from other actors. This new forum seems to\nwelcome ransomware, as we’ve already observed LockBit advertising there, so maybe this is\nwhere REvil resurfaces or behind a new variant.\n\nGiven the absence of any public law enforcement moves and a lack of any general\nstatements one way or another about any outcomes, this starts to become a very likely\nscenario. We’ve seen this repeatedly happen as significant players stepped away to change\ntheir business model, even just this year. In 2019 the group behind GandCrab went silent for\na bit, and then suddenly, Sodinokibi and REvil became the new thing in 2020.\n\nOne thing to note: an almost throwaway quote buried in the last couple of paragraphs from a\n[BBC story on Kaseya from 23 July 2021 deserves some attention here. The journalist’s](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57946117)\ncontact who claimed to have some insider knowledge of REvil stated that all of this is “part of\na new beginning.” Whether this is just a wild claim from someone to gain street credibility or\nthis is a vetted source speaking the truth, it keeps the door open to the possibility of a later\nreemergence of REvil in a different form especially considering other indicators.\n\n**Verdict: Likely, but need to observe for other indicators.**\n\n## Hypothesis 5: Vacation or Retirement\n\n**Point: Vacation is all I ever wanted**\n\nThis one’s tough to prove because without knowing group personas outside of the dark web,\nit’s hard to look for beach selfies on Instagram that could serve as the smoking gun here.\nWe’ve touched on this a few times, but Dmitri Alperovich of Crowdstrike fame floated the\nidea that new Russian safe havens in Crimea, along with the summer heat of Moscow,\ncould’ve driven operators to take some time off. There’s also a saying that “a Russian resort\nis preferable to an American prison.”\n\n**Point: Riding off into the sunset with bags of money**\n\n\n-----\n\nRetirement is definitely a route that s been done before, especially when GandCrab (the yet\nunconfirmed variant connected to REvil) decided to close up shop back in 2019. Most\nrecently, we’ve seen this to some extent with groups like Avaddon and Babuk Locker, who\nexited in various forms this year. Babuk, however, came back fairly quickly under a new\nmoniker.\n\nLooking at attacks over time, REvil was stepping up each attack in terms of ransom\namounts, to the point that the ransom for the Kaseya attack was to be a record $70 million\n[payout. Based on information from ransomwhe.re, we do know there’s at least four wallets](https://ransomwhe.re/#browse)\nwith just over $12 million in Bitcoin sitting there. Either way, not a bad pile of money to retire\non, potentially.\n\n**Counterpoint:**\n\nWhat does work against this theory was the lack of any public announcements either way.\nAlso it would likely take some time to move funds around in wallets, and in the instance of\nlaw enforcement involvement, time would likely be another factor to consider.\n\n**Counterpoint: Travel may be difficult**\n\nIf the operators are indeed operating from Russia or any of the former Soviet republics,\nbetween COVID restrictions on travel in various countries as well as the potential for landing\nin an extradition country, travel could be problematic.\n\n**Verdict: Realistically possible, but difficult to prove either way, without more**\n**information and insight.**\n\n## Hypothesis 6: The Wildcard\n\nThis area served as a drop-off point for any ideas that hadn’t been mentioned. Ideas like\nalien abduction were not off the table but were found to be too improbable and reasonably\ndifficult to prove.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The always useful “Aliens” meme,_\n\n_courtesy of knowyourmeme.com._\nWhat is a more likely scenario for the wildcard is a combination of factors from the other\nhypotheses. There were not quite enough convincing arguments to make a hypothesis the\nbest one. Some are stronger than others, primarily because of what we can prove or at least\nconsider.\n\nFor example, law enforcement might’ve infiltrated critical infrastructure or compromised\nspecific members, which means a forced reorganization of the business. Or pressure was on\namong affiliates or group members who didn’t like all of the attention, which forced a\nretirement or job search for some, while others stayed on to figure out the next course of\naction. There may have even been dreaded customer churn among affiliates, and the public\nbravado in June 2021 about the aftermath of JBS was just smoke and mirrors.\n\nWe may just be seeing a cooling-off period, a rebrand, and maybe even a reorganization,\nwhich throws law enforcement off the scent. They may even still be around but using\ndifferent, less public means to communicate, recruit, and advertise. It may end up being all of\nthese factors, a combination of them, or none at all. Either way, we haven’t necessarily\nclosed the book on this group yet. Given some pretty significant successes over the last\ncouple of years for REvil, it might be too soon to retire, but on this third iteration, maybe it’s\nonly time to change some logos for this Oceans 13 crew.\n\n**Verdict: There are several motivating factors brought up in different areas, but law**\n**enforcement action and/or rebrand are the most likely.**\n\n## Changes in the Threat Landscape\n\nThis has been a pretty remarkable year in terms of major events impacting the threat\nlandscape. We’ve seen record-breaking attacks, lots of groups entering and exiting the\nscene, and finally some attention from the very top: even heads of government are talking\nabout it; not to mention the news cycle has caught on. The fact that no one has come to a\n\n\n-----\n\ndecent conclusion yet speaks to a number of factors. If it is a rebrand, the group has\namazing operational security, and if there is some outsider knowledge about it, this is\nshowing that sometimes, there is truly honor among thieves. If it was law enforcement, the\nsilence continues to be a little unnerving.\n\nAt Digital Shadows, we continue to scour the world for information about this and other\ncampaigns to keep our clients informed. As we spoke about in our recent Q2 2021\nRansomware research, this is a problem that’s not going away, and despite one group’s\nprobable exit, there are more gaining in prominence.
