These versions are tracked under CVE-2022-23812.](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-97m3-w2cp-4xx6)\n\nOn March 8th, developer Brandon Nozaki Miller, aka RIAEvangelist released open source\n[software packages called peacenotwar and](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peacenotwar) [oneday-test on both npm and GitHub.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oneday-test)\n\nThe packages appear to have been originally created by the developer as a means of\npeaceful protest, as they mainly add a \"message of peace\" on the Desktop of any user\ninstalling the packages.\n\n\"This code serves as a non-destructive example of why controlling your node modules is\nimportant,\" explains RIAEvangelist.\n\n\"It also serves as a non-violent protest against Russia's aggression that threatens the world\nright now.\"\n\nBut, chaos unfolded when select npm versions of the famous 'node-ipc' library—also\nmaintained by RIAEvangelist, were seen launching a destructive payload to delete all data\nby overwriting files of users installing the package.\n\n[Interestingly, the malicious code, committed as early as March 7th by the dev, would read](https://archive.ph/n8oBX)\nthe system's external IP address and only delete data by overwriting files for users\n**based in Russia and Belarus.**\n\nThe code present within 'node-ipc', specifically in file \"ssl-geospec.js\" contains base64encoded strings and obfuscation tactics to mask its true purpose:\n\n**Malicious code in 'node-ipc' that runs for Russian and Belarusian**\n**users (BleepingComputer)**\n[A simplified copy of the code provided by researchers shows that for users based in Russia](https://gist.github.com/MidSpike/f7ae3457420af78a54b38a31cc0c809c)\nor Belarus, the code will rewrite the contents of all files present on a system with a heart\nemoji—effectively deleting all data on a system.\n\nAdditionally, because 'node-ipc' versions 9.2.2, 11.0.0, and those greater than\n11.0.0 bundle the peacenotwar module within themselves, affected users saw 'WITH-LOVEFROM-AMERICA.txt' files popping up on their Desktop with \"peace\" messages:\n\n\n-----\n\n**WITH-**\n\n**LOVE-FROM-AMERICA.txt file with multilingual 'peace' messages**\nResearchers at open source security firm Snyk also tracked and analyzed the malicious\nactivity:\n\n\"At this point, a very clear abuse and a critical supply chain security incident will occur for\nany system on which this npm package will be called upon, if that matches a geo-location of\neither Russia or Belarus,\" writes Liran Tal, Director of Developer Advocacy at Snyk in a blog\npost.\n\n## Vue.js users panic over supply chain attack\n\nPopular JavaScript front end framework 'Vue.js' also uses 'node-ipc' as a dependency. But\nprior to this incident, 'Vue.js' did not pin the versions of 'node-ipc' dependency to a safe\nversion and was set up to fetch the latest minor and patch versions instead, as evident from\nthe caret (^) symbol:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Versions of Vue.js CLI previously pulled latest minor and patch versions of node-ipc**\nAs such, Vue.js CLI users [made an urgent appeal to the project's maintainers to pin the](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/7054)\n['node-ipc' dependency to a safe version, after some were left startled.](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/233#issuecomment-1067905728)\n\nAnd, as observed by BleepingComputer, Vue.js isn't the only open source project to be\nimpacted by this sabotage.\n\n[Developers Lukas Mertens and Fedor are warning other project maintainers to make sure](https://github.com/search?q=vue.js+peacenotwar&type=issues)\nthey are not on a malicious 'node-ipc' version:\n\n**Lukas Mertens**\n\n**warns repo owners using malicious 'node-ipc' versions (GitHub)**\n\n\n-----\n\nSnyk researchers suspect that node-ipc versions 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 that cause blatant\ndamage to the system were taken down by npm within 24 hours of publication.\n\n[Note, however, 'node-ipc' versions 11.0.0 and above remain available on npm. And,](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mpp-xfvh-qh37)\n[these versions still contain the peacenotwar module that will create the aforementioned](http://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mpp-xfvh-qh37)\n'WITH-LOVE-FROM-AMERICA.txt' files on Desktop.\n\nAs such, if your application is built using the 'node-ipc' library, make sure to pin the\n[dependency to a safe version such as 9.2.1 (turns out 9.2.2 isn't innocent either).](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8gr3-2gjw-jj7g)\n\n## Incident upsets open source community\n\nThis marks the second major incident of protest by an open source developer this year,\n[following January's 'colors' and 'fakers' self-sabotage incident, as first reported by](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/)\nBleepingComputer.\n\nIn the case of 'colors', its developer Marak Squires drew mixed reactions from the open\nsource community because his manner of protest involved breaking thousands of\napplications by introducing infinite loops within them.\n\n[However, the move by RIAEvangelist, who maintains over 40 packages on npm, has drawn](https://www.npmjs.com/~riaevangelist)\nsharp criticism for going beyond just \"peaceful protest\" and actively deploying destructive\npayloads in a popular library without any warning to honest users.\n\nA GitHub user [called it \"a huge damage\" to the credibility of the whole open source](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/233#issuecomment-1068126507)\ncommunity.\n\n\"This behavior is beyond f**** up. Sure, war is bad, but that doesn't make this behavior (e.g.\ndeleting all files for Russia/Belarus users and creating strange file in desktop folder)\njustified. F*** you, go to hell. You've just successfully ruined the open-source community.\nYou happy now @RIAEvangelist?\" [asked another.](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/233#issuecomment-1070347150)\n\nSome called out the 'node-ipc' developer for trying to \"cover up\" his tracks by persistently\n[editing and deleting previous comments on the thread [1,](http://web.archive.org/web/20220316015553/https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/233) [2,](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/233#issuecomment-1070536227) [3].](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/7054#issuecomment-1068300730)\n\n\"Even if the deliberate and dangerous act of maintainer RIAEvangelist will be perceived by\nsome as a legitimate act of protest. How does that reflect on the maintainer’s future\nreputation and stake in the developer community?\" asks Snyk's Tal.\n\nDevelopers should exercise caution before using 'node-ipc' in their applications as there is\nno assurance that future versions of this or any library released by RIAEvangelist will be\nsafe.\n\nPinning your dependencies to a trusted version is one of the ways of protecting your\napplications against such supply chain attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[NPM flaw let attackers add anyone as maintainer to malicious packages](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/npm-flaw-let-attackers-add-anyone-as-maintainer-to-malicious-packages/)\n\n[Third npm protestware: 'event-source-polyfill' calls Russia out](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/third-npm-protestware-event-source-polyfill-calls-russia-out/)\n\n[Hacker says hijacking libraries, stealing AWS keys was ethical research](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-says-hijacking-libraries-stealing-aws-keys-was-ethical-research/)\n\n[Check your gems: RubyGems fixes unauthorized package takeover bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/check-your-gems-rubygems-fixes-unauthorized-package-takeover-bug/)\n\n[Open source 'Package Analysis' tool finds malicious npm, PyPI packages](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/open-source-package-analysis-tool-finds-malicious-npm-pypi-packages/)\n\n[Cybercrime](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[npm](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/npm/)\n[Open Source](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/open-source/)\n[Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russia/)\n[Supply Chain](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/supply-chain/)\n[Supply-Chain Attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n\n[Ax Sharma](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ax-sharma/)\n\nAx Sharma is a Security Researcher and Tech Reporter.
