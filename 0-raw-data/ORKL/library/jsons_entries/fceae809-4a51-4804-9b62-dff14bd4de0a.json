Nowhere near as\npopular as RIG EK, this exploit kit still remains a threat with exploits for Internet Explorer, Flash, and Silverlight.\n\nIn early October we detected a new landing page format for Sundown EK, which followed on some previous new\nURL patterns. The notable changes are additional obfuscation and the (ab)use of white space throughout the\nHTML landing page.\n\nFor once, the payload dropped in this case isn’t ransomware but a two stage infection starting with a downloader\nwhich retrieves a banking Trojan.\n\n## Before\n\n\n-----\n\n## After\n\n\n-----\n\n## Here are some highlights\n\nCall for IE exploit\n\nCall for Flash exploit\n\n\n-----\n\nCall for Silverlight exploit:\n\nPayload launch (via wscript):\n\n\n-----\n\n[Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit blocks the various exploits pushed by Sundown EK:](https://www.malwarebytes.com/antiexploit)\n\n## Payload overview\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial dropped payload we captured in this particular new Sundown EK instance is Smoke Loader a\ndownloader whose purpose is to retrieve additional malware. Not too long ago, we observed Smoke Loader\n[being distributed by RIG EK.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/exploits-threat-analysis/2016/07/a-look-into-some-rig-exploit-kit-campaigns/)\n\nUpon execution, Smoke Loader will download a second stage payload\nfrom https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4o3dllw65z6wemb/vamos.lek.\n\nThis particular piece of malware belongs to the Kronos banking Trojan family. It is a credential-stealer with form\ngrabbing and HTML injection capabilities.\n\nBoth of those threats are detected by [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware:](https://www.malwarebytes.com/antimalware)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[We first noticed increased activity from Sundown EK earlier this year, and not a whole lot has changed after](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/06/a-look-at-the-angler-less-exploit-kit-scene/)\nAngler went offline. Neutrino and RIG battled for the top spot while others like Magnitude and Sundown kept on\ndoing their smaller, more targeted campaigns.\n\nCollecting this Kronos payload was interesting because it is part of a trend we have observed recently of an\nincreased number in banking Trojans distributed via malvertising campaigns.\n\n_[Special thanks to @hasherezade for help in unpacking the malware payloads.](https://twitter.com/hasherezade)_\n\n## Further reading\n\n[Smoke Loader – downloader with a smokescreen still alive](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/08/smoke-loader-downloader-with-a-smokescreen-still-alive/)\n\n**IOCs:**\n\nRaw Sundown EK landing: [Link](https://malwarebytes.box.com/s/qphvfvnidx0jdqykm48lfqh0ethcamdv)\n[Partially deobfuscated landing (thanks David Ledbetter):](https://twitter.com/Ledtech3) [Link](https://malwarebytes.box.com/s/ny19iq7sgno5halixwyjsddfdljw96tj)\nURL patterns:\n\n_fhbg.futureproducts.xyz/index.php?_\n_8Fn3HGC8gA=sS28Njmi16RQG3jf2qBJ91nXhsFjqBM8rQf9zlFjJV6oksXmwLUiEzNO_\n_fhbg.futureproducts.xyz/undefined_\n_fhbg.futureproducts.xyz/45786437956439785/127.swf_\n_fhbg.futureproducts.xyz/580367589678954654986459286/489567945678456874356487356743256.swf_\n_fhbg.futureproducts.xyz/580367589678954654986459286/459643097739469743657974386794384.xap_\n_de.piclogo.xyz/43526876827345687356872456.php?id=127_\n_de.piclogo.xyz/z.php?id=127_\nSmoke Loader: e420e521f891c1a6245e377dc7a6ab70458b7c0d77ad39535cb59018a542fe15\nKronos: e420e521f891c1a6245e377dc7a6ab70458b7c0d77ad39535cb59018a542fe15\n\n\n-----",
