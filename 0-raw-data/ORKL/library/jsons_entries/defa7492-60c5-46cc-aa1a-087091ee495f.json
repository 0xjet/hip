    "plain_text": "# Russian cyberattacks\n\n**gov.pl/web/special-services/russian-cyberattacks**\n\n30.12.2022\n\nWith the ongoing war in Ukraine, in the Polish cyberspace, there are more and more\noccurrences classified as computer incidents, including attacks perpetrated by Russian\nhackers. This is a response of the Russian Federation to the Poland’s support provided to\nUkraine and an attempt to destabilise the situation in our country.\n\nSince the beginning of the Russian invasion against Ukraine Poland has been a constant\ntarget of the Kremlin’s hybrid actions, including attacks in cyberspace. Recently this hostile\nactivity has intensified. This is the consequence of our commitment to help Ukraine but also\nof the fact that Poland is strongly advocating in the international arena for providing help to\nKyiv. Through hostile operations in cyberspace Russia wants to exert pressure on Poland, as\na frontline country and a key Ukraine’s ally on the NATO eastern flank.\n\nBoth public administration domains and private companies, the media and ordinary users\nbecome the target of hacker attacks. Entities from strategic sectors, such as energy or\narmaments, are particularly at risk. Some of these hostile campaigns can be linked directly to\nthe activities of pro-Russian hacking groups.\n\nThis was the case, for example, with the recent attack on the website of the Polish\nparliament (Sejm). The CSIRT GOV team operating in the Internal Security Agency (ABW)\nidentified problems with the accessibility of the sejm.gov.pl website. Data analysis showed\nthat the website's unavailability was the result of an attack carried out by the pro-Russian\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup NoName057(16). This group on the Telegram portal has set the parliamentary website\nas one of its goals. This attack was a response to the adoption by the Sejm of the Republic\nof Poland of a resolution recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nSuch incidents in cyberspace are retaliatory actions typical of Russia, which are a response\nto steps taken by other countries, that are unfavorable and inconvenient for the Russian\nFederation. Hacker groups linked to the Kremlin use ransomware, dDos and phishing\nattacks, and the goal of hostile actions coincides with the goals of a hybrid attack:\ndestabilization, intimidation and sowing chaos.\n\nFalse structures are also used for aggressive actions, such as websites impersonating real\nwebsites. In the first days of December, the CSIRT GOV Team received information about\nthe registration of a phishing website impersonating the website in the government domain\ngov.pl. The content of the fake website suggested that the President of the Republic of\nPoland signed a decree on compensation for Polish residents, financed from European\nfunds. The \"I'd like to know\" link led through a phishing process and then redirected to a\nphishing payment card page under the guise of charging a verification fee to pay\ncompensation. Thanks to the intervention of the Internal Security Agency, the website was\nblocked. This is a typical operation aimed at sowing chaos, undermining the state, but also\ncollecting personal data and extorting money.\n\nEvery attack in cyberspace pursues complex objectives and has various implications –\nsocial, political or financial ones. More and more often cyberattacks are used in order to\nspread Russian disinformation and serve Russian special services to gather data and\nvulnerable information. The operation that is carried out using simultaneously both of these\nmethods is the „GhostWriter” campaign. It consists in attacking email addresses and\naccounts in social media of public figures in the CEE countries, mainly in Poland. The\nauthors of this campaign are trying to seize information resources for the purposes of the\nRussian disinformation. In recent months this operation has been focused on actions against\nPoland.\n\nTaking into consideration an increasing scale of threats, the Polish cyberspace is constantly\nmonitored as far as potential dangerous incidents are concerned in order to react to them as\nfast as possible. At the same time, it is important to implement measures in order to prevent\nattacks. In Poland, the Prime Minister has also introduced the third security alert CHARLIECRP which is related to the cybersecurity and responds to growing threats in cyberspace.\n\n_Government Plenipotentiary for the Security of Information Space of the Republic of Poland._\n\n\n-----",
