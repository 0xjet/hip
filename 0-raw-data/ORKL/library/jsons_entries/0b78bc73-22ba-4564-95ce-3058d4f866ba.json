This unusual level of cross-industry collaboration caps a\nsuccessful effort to dismantle ‘WireX,’ an extraordinary new crime machine comprising tens\nof thousands of hacked Android mobile devices that was used this month to launch a series\nof massive cyber attacks.\n\nExperts involved in the takedown warn that WireX marks the emergence of a new class of\nattack tools that are more challenging to defend against and thus require broader industry\ncooperation to defeat.\n\nThis graphic shows the rapid growth of the WireX botnet in the first three weeks of August 2017.\n\nNews of WireX’s emergence first surfaced August 2, 2017, when a modest collection of\nhacked Android devices was first spotted conducting some fairly small online attacks. Less\nthan two weeks later, however, the number of infected Android devices enslaved by WireX\nhad ballooned to the tens of thousands.\n\nMore worrisome was that those in control of the botnet were now wielding it to take down\nseveral large websites in the hospitality industry — pelting the targeted sites with so much\njunk traffic that the sites were no longer able to accommodate legitimate visitors.\n\nExperts tracking the attacks soon zeroed in on the malware that powers WireX:\n[Approximately 300 different mobile apps scattered across Google‘s Play store that were](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en)\nmimicking seemingly innocuous programs, including video players, ringtones or simple tools\nsuch as file managers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified approximately 300 apps associated with the issue, blocked them from the Play\nStore, and we’re in the process of removing them from all affected devices,” Google said in a\nwritten statement. “The researchers’ findings, combined with our own analysis, have enabled\nus to better protect Android users, everywhere.”\n\nPerhaps to avoid raising suspicion, the tainted Play store applications all performed their\nbasic stated functions. But those apps also bundled a small program that would launch\nquietly in the background and cause the infected mobile device to surreptitiously connect to\nan Internet server used by the malware’s creators to control the entire network of hacked\ndevices. From there, the infected mobile device would await commands from the control\nserver regarding which Websites to attack and how.\n\nA sampling of the apps from Google’s Play store that were tainted with the WireX malware.\n\nExperts involved in the takedown say it’s not clear exactly how many Android devices may\nhave been infected with WireX, in part because only a fraction of the overall infected systems\nwere able to attack a target at any given time. Devices that were powered off would not\nattack, but those that were turned on with the device’s screen locked could still carry on\nattacks in the background, they found.\n\n“I know in the cases where we pulled data out of our platform for the people being targeted\nwe saw 130,000 to 160,000 (unique Internet addresses) involved in the attack,” said Chad\n**Seaman, a senior engineer at Akamai, a company that specializes in helping firms weather**\nlarge DDoS attacks (Akamai protected KrebsOnSecurity from hundreds of attacks prior to\nthe large Mirai assault last year).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe identical press release that Akamai and other firms involved in the WireX takedown\nagreed to publish says the botnet infected a minimum of 70,000 Android systems, but\nSeaman says that figure is conservative.\n\n“Seventy thousand was a safe bet because this botnet makes it so that if you’re driving down\nthe highway and your phone is busy attacking some website, there’s a chance your device\ncould show up in the attack logs with three or four or even five different Internet addresses,”\nSeaman said in an interview with KrebsOnSecurity. “We saw attacks coming from infected\ndevices in over 100 countries. It was coming from everywhere.”\n\n**BUILDING ON MIRAI**\n\nSecurity experts from Akamai and other companies that participated in the WireX takedown\nsay the basis for their collaboration was forged in the monstrous and unprecedented\n[distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks launched last year by Mirai, a malware strain](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&x=0&y=0)\nthat seeks out poorly-secured “Internet of things” (IoT) devices such as security cameras,\ndigital video recorders and Internet routers.\n\nThe first and largest of the Mirai botnets was used in a giant attack last September that\n[knocked this Web site offline for several days. Just a few days after that — when the source](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/)\n[code that powers Mirai was published online for all the world to see and use — dozens of](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/)\ncopycat Mirai botnets emerged. Several of those botnets were used to conduct massive\nDDoS attacks against a variety of targets, leading to widespread Internet outages for many\ntop Internet destinations.\n\n**[Allison Nixon, director of security research at New York City-based security firm Flashpoint,](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/)**\nsaid the Mirai attacks were a wake-up call for the security industry and a rallying cry for more\ncollaboration.\n\n“When those really large Mirai DDoS botnets started showing up and taking down massive\npieces of Internet infrastructure, that caused massive interruptions in service for people that\nnormally don’t deal with DDoS attacks,” Nixon said. “It sparked a lot of collaboration.\nDifferent players in the industry started to take notice, and a bunch of us realized that we\nneeded to deal with this thing because if we didn’t it would just keep getting bigger and\nrampaging around.”\n\nMirai was notable not only for the unprecedented size of the attacks it could launch but also\nfor its ability to spread rapidly to new machines. But for all its sheer firepower, Mirai is not a\nparticularly sophisticated attack platform. Well, not in comparison to WireX, that is.\n\n**CLICK-FRAUD ORIGINS**\n\nAccording to the group’s research, the WireX botnet likely began its existence as a\n[distributed method for conducting “click fraud,” a pernicious form of online advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud)\nfraud that will cost publishers and businesses an estimated $16 billion this year, according to\n\n\n-----\n\n[recent estimates. Multiple antivirus tools currently detect the WireX malware as a known click](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/businesses-could-lose-164-billion-to-online-advert-fraud-in-2017.html)\nfraud malware variant.\n\nThe researchers believe that at some point the click-fraud botnet was repurposed to conduct\nDDoS attacks. While DDoS botnets powered by Android devices are extremely unusual (if\nnot unprecedented at this scale), it is the botnet’s ability to generate what appears to be\nregular Internet traffic from mobile browsers that strikes fear in the heart of experts who\nspecialize in defending companies from large-scale DDoS attacks.\n\nDDoS defenders often rely on developing custom “filters” or “signatures” that can help them\nseparate DDoS attack traffic from legitimate Web browser traffic destined for a targeted site.\nBut experts say WireX has the capability to make that process much harder.\n\nThat’s because WireX includes its own so-called “headless” Web browser that can do\neverything a real, user-driven browser can do, except without actually displaying the browser\nto the user of the infected system.\n\nAlso, Wirex can encrypt the attack traffic using SSL — the same technology that typically\nprotects the security of a browser session when an Android user visits a Web site which\nrequires the submission of sensitive data. This adds a layer of obfuscation to the attack\ntraffic, because the defender needs to decrypt incoming data packets before being able to\ntell whether the traffic inside matches a malicious attack traffic signature.\n\nTranslation: It can be far more difficult and time-consuming than usual for defenders to tell\nWireX traffic apart from clicks generated by legitimate Internet users trying to browse to a\ntargeted site.\n\n“These are pretty miserable and painful attacks to mitigate, and it was these kinds of\nadvanced functionalities that made this threat stick out like a sore thumb,” Akamai’s Seaman\nsaid.\n\n**NOWHERE TO HIDE**\n\nTraditionally, many companies that found themselves on the receiving end of a large DDoS\nattack sought to conceal this fact from the public — perhaps out of fear that customers or\nusers might conclude the attack succeeded because of some security failure on the part of\nthe victim.\n\nBut the stigma associated with being hit with a large DDoS is starting to fade, Flashpoint’s\nNixon said, if for no other reason than it is becoming far more difficult for victims to conceal\nsuch attacks from public knowledge.\n\n“Many companies, including Flashpoint, have built out different capabilities in order to see\nwhen a third party is being DDoS’d,” Nixon said. “Even though I work at a company that\ndoesn’t do DDoS mitigation, we can still get visibility when a third-party is getting attacked.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, network operators and ISPs have a strong interest in not having their networks abused\nfor DDoS, and many of them have built capabilities to know when their networks are passing\nDDoS traffic.”\n\nJust as multiple nation states now employ a variety of techniques and technologies to keep\ntabs on nation states that might conduct underground tests of highly destructive nuclear\nweapons, a great deal more organizations are now actively looking for signs of large-scale\nDDoS attacks, Seaman added.\n\n“The people operating those satellites and seismograph sensors to detect nuclear\n\n[detonations] can tell you how big it was and maybe what kind of bomb it was, but they\nprobably won’t be able to tell you right away who launched it,” he said. “It’s only when we\ntake many of these reports together in the aggregate that we can get a much better sense of\nwhat’s really going on. It’s a good example of none of us being as smart as all of us.”\n\nAccording to the WireX industry consortium, the smartest step that organizations can take\nwhen under a DDoS attack is to talk to their security vendor(s) and make it clear that they\nare open to sharing detailed metrics related to the attack.\n\n“With this information, those of us who are empowered to dismantle these schemes can\nlearn much more about them than would otherwise be possible,” the report notes. “There is\nno shame in asking for help. Not only is there no shame, but in most cases it is impossible to\nhide the fact that you are under a DDoS attack. A number of research efforts have the ability\nto detect the existence of DDoS attacks happening globally against third parties no matter\nhow much those parties want to keep the issue quiet. There are few benefits to being\nsecretive and numerous benefits to being forthcoming.”\n\nIdentical copies of the WireX report and Appendix are available at the following links:\n\n[Flashpoint](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/wirex-botnet-industry-collaboration/)\n\n[Akamai](https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/08/the-wirex-botnet-an-example-of-cross-organizational-cooperation.html)\n\n[Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-wirex-botnet/)\n\n[RiskIQ](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/wirex-botnet)\n\n\n-----",
