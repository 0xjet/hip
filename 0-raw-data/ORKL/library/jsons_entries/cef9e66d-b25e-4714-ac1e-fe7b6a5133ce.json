The researchers call it Nemty.\n\nThis is the first version of Nemty ransomware, named so after the extension it adds to the\nfiles following the encryption process.\n\n## The ransom demand\n\nLike any proper file-encrypting malware, Nemty will delete the shadow copies for the files it\nprocesses, taking away from the victim the possibility to recover versions of the data as\ncreated by the Windows operating system.\n\nVictims will see a ransom note informing that the attackers hold the decryption key and that\ndata is recoverable for a price.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn BleepingComputer's tests, the ransom demand was 0.09981 BTC, which converts to\naround $1,000 at the moment.\n\nThe payment portal is hosted on the Tor network for anonymity, and users have to upload\ntheir configuration file.\n\nBased on this, they are provided with the link to another website that comes with a chat\nfunction and more information on the demands.\n\n## Messages in the code\n\n[Security researcher Vitali Kremez took a closer look at the malware and noticed that it](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1165352844876222464)\ncomes with an unusual name for the mutex object. The author called it \"hate,\" as visible in\nthe image below.\n\n\n-----\n\nA mutually exclusive (mutex) object is a flag that allows programs to control resources by\nallowing access to them to one execution thread at a time.\n\n[Another weird thing Kremez noticed in Nemty's code is a link to this picture of Vladimir](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dn4vwaRW0AY-tUu.jpg:large)\n[Putin, with a caption saying \"I added you to the list of [insult], but only with pencil for now.\"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fag)\n\nThe list of peculiarities does not stop at this. A straight message to the antivirus industry\nwas spotted by the researcher.\n\nAt first, the reference seemed an odd thing in the code but a second look at how Nemty\nworked revealed that it was the key for decoding base64 strings and create URLs is a\nstraight message to the antivirus industry.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting thing is a verification Nemty makes to identify computers in Russia,\nBelarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Ukraine. This is not to exempt the hosts from the file\nencryption routine, though, Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\nThe \"isRU\" check in the malware code simply marks the systems as being in one of the five\ncountries and then sends to the attacker data that includes the computer name, username,\noperating system, and computer ID.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s unclear how Nemty is distributed but Kremez heard from a reliable source that the\noperators deploy it via compromised remote desktop connections.\n\nCompared to phishing email, which is currently the common distribution method, leveraging\na RDP connection puts the attacker in control as they no longer have to wait for the victim\nto take the phishing bait.\n\n[Kremez published his research notes on Nemty where he includes the list of folders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k-vitali/Malware-Misc-RE/master/2019-08-24-nemty-ransomware-notes.vk.raw)\n(anything needed for booting the OS) and the file extensions (binaries, shortcuts, and log\ndata) the malware does not touch.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Nemty Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nemty-ransomware/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
