However, since late 2015, we have witnessed an interesting change in its\ntraditional targets. From a pure criminal group perpetrating cybercrime for financial gain,\nits toolset has been expanded with malware used to conduct espionage in Eastern\nEurope and Central Asia.\n\nThroughout our tracking, we’ve seen this group deploy its main backdoor as well as\nother tools against various victims, but June 2019 was the first time we saw the Buhtrap\ngroup use a [zero-day exploit as part of a campaign. In that case, we observed Buhtrap](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/07/10/windows-zero-day-cve-2019-1132-exploit/)\nusing a local privilege escalation exploit, CVE-2019-1132, against one of its victims.\n\nThe exploit abuses a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Windows,\nspecifically a NULL pointer dereference in the win32k.sys component. Once the exploit\nwas discovered and analyzed, it was reported to the Microsoft Security Response\nCenter, who promptly fixed the vulnerability and released a [patch.](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1132)\n\nThis blog post covers the evolution of Buhtrap from a financial crime to an espionage\nmindset.\n\n## History\n\nThe timeline in Figure 1 highlights some of the most important developments in Buhtrap\nactivity.\n\n\n_Figure 1. Important events in Buhtrap timeline_\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is always difficult to attribute a campaign to a particular actor when their tools source\ncode is freely available on the web. However, as the shift in targets occurred before the\nsource code leak, we assess with high confidence that the same people behind the first\nBuhtrap malware attacks against businesses and banks are also involved in targeting\ngovernmental institutions.\n\nAlthough new tools have been added to their arsenal and updates applied to older ones,\nthe tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in the different Buhtrap campaigns\nhave not changed dramatically over all these years. They still make extensive use of\nNSIS installers as droppers and these are mainly delivered through malicious\ndocuments. Also, several of their tools are signed with valid code-signing certificates and\nabuse a known, legitimate application to side-load their malicious payloads.\n\nThe documents employed to deliver the malicious payloads often come with benign\ndecoy documents to avoid raising suspicions if the victim opens them. The analysis of\nthese decoy documents provides clues about who the targets might be. When Buhtrap\nwas targeting businesses, the decoy documents would typically be contracts or invoices.\nFigure 2 is a typical example of a generic invoice the group used in a campaign in 2014.\n\n\n_Figure 2. Decoy document used in campaigns against Russian businesses_\n\n\nWhen the group’s focus shifted to banks, the decoy documents were related to banking\nsystem regulations or advisories from FinCERT, an organization created by the Russian\ngovernment to provide help and guidance to its financial institutions (such as the\nexample in Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Decoy document used in campaigns against Russian financial institutions_\n\n\nHence, when we first saw decoy documents related to government operations, we\nimmediately started to track these new campaigns. One of the first malicious samples\nshowing such a change was noticed in December 2015. It downloaded an NSIS installer\nwhose role was to install the main Buhtrap backdoor, but the decoy document – seen in\nFigure 4 – was intriguing.\n\n\n_Figure 4. Decoy document used in campaigns against governmental organizations_\n\n\nThe URL in the text is revealing. It is very similar to the State Migration Service of\nUkraine website, dmsu.gov.ua. The text, in Ukrainian, asks employees to provide their\ncontact information, especially their email addresses. It also tries to convince them to\nclick on the malicious domain included in the text.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis was the first of many malicious samples used by the Buhtrap group to target\ngovernment institutions we encountered. Another, more recent decoy document that we\nbelieve was also distributed by the Buhtrap group is seen in Figure 5 – a document\nwhich would appeal to a very different set of people, but still government related.\n\n\n_Figure 5. Decoy documents used in campaigns against governmental organizations_\n\n\n## Analysis of the targeted campaigns leading to zero-day usage\n\nThe tools used in the espionage campaigns were very similar to those used against\nbusinesses and financial institutions. One of the first malicious samples that we analyzed\ntargeted governmental organizations was a sample with SHA-1 hash\n2F2640720CCE2F83CA2F0633330F13651384DD6A. This NSIS installer downloads the\nregular package containing the Buhtrap backdoor and displays the decoy document\nshown in Figure 4.\n\nSince then, we’ve seen several different campaigns against governmental organizations\ncoming from this group. In these, they were routinely using vulnerabilities to elevate their\nprivileges in order to install their malware. We’ve seen them exploit old vulnerabilities\nsuch as CVE-2015-2387. However, they were always known vulnerabilities. The zeroday they used recently was part of the same pattern: using it so that they could run their\nmalware with the highest privileges.\n\nThroughout the years, packages with different functionalities appeared. Recently, we\nfound two new packages that are worth describing as they deviate from the typical\ntoolset.\n\n### Legacy backdoor with a twist – E0F3557EA9F2BA4F7074CAA0D0CF3B187C4472FF\n\n\n-----\n\nThis document contains a malicious macro that, when enabled, drops an NSIS installer\nwhose task is to prepare installation of the main backdoor. However, this NSIS installer is\nvery different from the earlier versions used by this group. It is much simpler and is only\nused to set the persistence and launch two malicious modules embedded within it.\n\nThe first module, called “grabber” by its author, is a standalone password stealer. It tries\nto harvest passwords from mail clients, browsers, etc., and sends them to a C&C server.\nThis module was also detected as part of the campaign using the zero-day. This module\nuses standard Windows APIs to communicate with its C&C server.\n\n\n_Figure 6. Grabber module network capabilities_\n\n\nThe second module is something that we have come to expect from Buhtrap operators:\nan NSIS installer containing a legitimate application that will be abused to side load the\nBuhtrap main backdoor. The legitimate application that is abused in this case is AVZ, a\nfree anti-virus scanner.\n\n### Meterpreter and DNS tunneling – C17C335B7DDB5C8979444EC36AB668AE8E4E0A72\n\nThis document contains a malicious macro that, when enabled, drops an NSIS installer\nwhose task is to prepare installation of the main backdoor. Part of the installation\nprocess is to set up firewall rules to allow the malicious component to communicate with\nthe C&C server. Next is a command example the NSIS installer uses to set up these\nrules:\n\ncmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\\”Realtek HD Audio Update Utility\\”\ndir=in action=allow program=\\”<path>\\RtlUpd.exe\\” enable=yes profile=any\n\nHowever, the final payload is something that we have never seen associated with\nBuhtrap. Encrypted in its body are two payloads. The first one is a very small shellcode\ndownloader, while the second one is Metasploit’s Meterpreter. Meterpreter is a reverse\nshell that grants its operators full access to the compromised system.\n\nThe Meterpreter reverse shell actually uses DNS tunnelling to communicate with its C&C\nserver by using a module similar to what is described [here. Detecting DNS tunnelling](http://asintsov.blogspot.com/2017/12/data-exfiltration-in-metasploit.html)\ncan be difficult for defenders, since all malicious traffic is done via the DNS protocol, as\n\n\n-----\n\nopposed to the more regular TCP protocol. Below is a snippet of the initial\ncommunication of this malicious module.\n\n7812.reg0.4621.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\n7812.reg0.5173.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\n7812.reg0.5204.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\n7812.reg0.5267.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\n7812.reg0.5314.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\n7812.reg0.5361.toor.win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\n\n[…]\n\nThe C&C server domain name in this example is impersonating Microsoft. In fact, the\nattackers registered different domain names for these campaigns, most of them abusing\nMicrosoft brands in one way or another.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile we do not know why this group has suddenly shifted targets, it is a good example\nof the increasingly blurred lines between pure espionage groups and those primarily\ninvolved in crimeware activities. In this case, it is unclear if one or several members of\nthis group decided to change focus and for what reasons, but it is definitely something\nthat we are likely to see more of going forward.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n### ESET detection names\n\nVBA/TrojanDropper.Agent.ABM\nVBA/TrojanDropper.Agent.AGK\nWin32/Spy.Buhtrap.W\nWin32/Spy.Buhtrap.AK\nWin32/RiskWare.Meterpreter.G\n\n### Malware samples\n\n#### Main packages SHA-1\n\n2F2640720CCE2F83CA2F0633330F13651384DD6A\nE0F3557EA9F2BA4F7074CAA0D0CF3B187C4472FF\nC17C335B7DDB5C8979444EC36AB668AE8E4E0A72\n\n#### Grabber SHA-1\n\n9c3434ebdf29e5a4762afb610ea59714d8be2392\n\n### C&C servers\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://hdfilm-seyret[.]com/help/index.php\nhttps://redmond.corp-microsoft[.]com/help/index.php\ndns://win10.ipv6-microsoft[.]org\nhttps://services-glbdns2[.]com/FIGm6uJx0MhjJ2ImOVurJQTs0rRv5Ef2UGoSc\nhttps://secure-telemetry[.]net/wp-login.php\n\n### Certificates\n\nYUVA-TRAVEL 5e662e84b62ca6bdf6d050a1a4f5db6b28fbb7c5\n\nSET&CO LIMITED b25def9ac34f31b84062a8e8626b2f0ef589921f\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nExecution [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) User execution The user must run the executable.\n\n[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/) Execution through API Executes additional malware through\nCreateProcess.\n\n[T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) Command-Line Interface Some packages provide Meterpreter\nshell access.\n\n\nPersis‐\ntence\n\nDefense\nevasion\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\n\n[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/) Scheduled Task Some of the packages create a sched‐\nuled task to be executed periodically.\n\n[T1116](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116/) Code Signing Some of the samples are signed.\n\n[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/) Input Capture Backdoor contains a keylogger.\n\n\n[T1111](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111/) Two-Factor Authentica‐\ntion Interception\n\n\nBackdoor actively searches for a con‐\nnected smart card.\n\n\nCollection [T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115/) Clipboard Data Backdoor logs clipboard content.\n\nExfiltration [T1020](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/) Automated Exfiltration Log files are automatically exfiltrated.\n\n[T1022](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1022/) Data Encrypted Data sent to C&C is encrypted.\n\n\n[T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/) Exfiltration Over Com‐\nmand and Control\nChannel\n\n\nExfiltrated data is sent to a server.\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\n[T1043](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1043/) Commonly Used Port Communicates with a server using\nHTTPS.\n\n\n[T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Standard Application\nLayer Protocol\n\n[T1094](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1094/) Custom Command and\nControl Protocol\n\n\nHTTPS is used.\n\nMeterpreter is using DNS tunneling to\ncommunicate.\n\n\n[T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/) Remote File Copy Backdoor can download and execute\nfile from C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Jean-Ian Boutin 11 Jul 2019 - 11:30AM](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/boutin/)\n\n\n-----",
