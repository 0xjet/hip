We\nhave since observed multiple shifts in DRAGONBRIDGE tactics, and in September 2021, we\n[reported on an expansion of this campaign’s activity.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/pro-prc-influence-campaign-expands-dozens-social-media-platforms-websites-and-forums)\n\nRecently, we identified and investigated a subset of information operations activity we\nattribute to the DRAGONBRIDGE campaign across social media that targeted the Australian\nrare earths mining company, Lynas Rare Earths Ltd, with content criticizing its alleged\nenvironmental record and calling for protests of its planned construction of a rare earths\nprocessing facility in Texas. Subsequently in June, we observed additional\nDRAGONBRIDGE activity begin to target the Canadian rare earths mining company Appia\nRare Earths & Uranium Corp and the American rare earths manufacturing company USA\nRare Earth with negative messaging in response to potential or planned rare earths\nproduction activities involving those companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant has contacted Lynas, Appia, and USA Rare Earth about this activity, as well as\nsocial media platforms where this campaign promoted content. The campaign also promoted\n[content criticizing the Biden administration’s decision to invoke the Defense Production Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/31/memorandum-on-presidential-determination-pursuant-to-section-303-of-the-defense-production-act-of-1950-as-amended/)\non March 31, 2022, to expedite the domestic production of critical minerals to end U.S.\nreliance on China for its supply.\n\nWe highlight this activity as particularly notable for two reasons:\n\n_It targeted an industry of strategic significance to the PRC, including specifically three_\n_commercial entities challenging the PRC’s global market dominance in that industry._\n\nRare earth metals are a critical part of consumer and defense products such as missile\nguidance systems and aircraft engines, and China has used its supply chain\ndominance as geopolitical leverage, including by threatening a rare earths embargo to\nthe U.S. during the height of the trade war between the two countries in 2019.\n[In 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense signed an agreement with Lynas, the world’s](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2488672/dod-announces-rare-earth-element-award-to-strengthen-domestic-industrial-base/)\nlargest rare earths mining and processing company outside China, to construct the\nTexas processing facility.\nIn early June 2022, the Canadian rare earths miner Appia announced the discovery of\na new rare earths bearing zone in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Similarly, the\nAmerican rare earths supplier USA Rare Earth announced plans for a rare earths\nprocessing facility in Oklahoma in mid-June. Both statements prompted further activity\nfrom DRAGONBRIDGE in response.\nWe note that further information operations activity in a similar vein may narrowly target\nother specific industries or companies that may be relevant to the PRC’s strategic\ninterests, beyond the promotion of geopolitical narratives in line with PRC political\ninterests.\n\n_The campaign leveraged more nuanced tactics than what we typically see from pro-PRC_\n_information operations._\n\nThe campaign used inauthentic social media and forum accounts, including those\nposing as residents in Texas to feign concern over environmental and health issues\nsurrounding the plant, including via posts to a public social media group predisposed to\nbe receptive to that content.\nThese accounts also leveraged criticism of Biden’s invocation of the Defense\nProduction Act by real individuals, including U.S. politicians of both parties, to amplify\ncampaign narratives.\nWhile the activity we detail here does not appear to have been particularly effective and\nreceived only limited engagement by seemingly real individuals, the campaign’s\nmicrotargeting of specific audiences suggest the possibility of using similar means to\nmanipulate public discourse surrounding other U.S. political issues to the PRC’s\nadvantage.\n\n\n-----\n\n### DRAGONBRIDGE Accounts, Including Those Posing as Local Residents, Protested the Planned Construction of Lynas Rare Earths Processing Facility in Texas\n\nMandiant identified what we assess with high confidence to be DRAGONBRIDGE accounts\non multiple social media platforms and at least one forum, including those posing as\nconcerned residents protesting Lynas’ planned construction of a rare earths processing\nfacility in Texas (Figure 1). The accounts claimed that by placing the Lynas plant in Texas,\nthe Biden administration would expose the area to irreversible environmental damage and\nthe local population to radioactive contamination and adverse health effects such as cancer\nrisks, gene mutation, and deformities in newborns (Figure 2).\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE accounts, including those claiming to be from Texas, posted content\ncritical of Lynas to the public Facebook group “STOP LYNAS! NO to Lynas Exporting\nand Creating Another Toxic Legacy.”\nNotably, some of the Facebook posts by DRAGONBRIDGE accounts appear to have\nreceived limited engagement in the form of likes and comments by seemingly authentic\naccounts in the group.\nDRAGONBRIDGE accounts on Twitter likewise posted comments implying that they\nwere locals and Americans.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: DRAGONBRIDGE accounts on Twitter and Facebook pose as concerned residents\nto protest Lynas’ construction of a Texas facility and criticize the Biden administration’s\ndecision to expedite production of rare earth minerals\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Accounts promote narratives highlighting pollution and health risks of Lynas’ rare\nearths production\nWe observed accounts post primarily in English, with an additional lesser amount of content\nin Chinese. Additionally, we observed extremely limited messaging in Malay, and\nDRAGONBRIDGE accounts promoted photos of demonstrations against Lynas that took\nplace in Malaysia sometime between 2012 and 2019, due to controversy surrounding the\ndisposal of radioactive waste produced by its rare earths processing facility in the city of\nKuantan. We also observed accounts call for Malaysians to boycott Lynas, a further\nindication of the campaign’s interest in specifically targeting the rare earths mining company\n(Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Accounts call for Malaysians to boycott Lynas\n\n### Activity Includes Quote-Tweeting of U.S. Politicians Negatively Commenting on Biden’s Invocation of Defense Production Act, Use of Related Hashtags\n\nAccounts leveraged commentary by real individuals, such as U.S. politicians and\ncommentators, to support their arguments against Lynas, its planned processing facility in\nTexas, and the Biden administration’s decision to expedite production of critical minerals. For\nexample, accounts reposted criticism of Biden’s invocation of the Defense Production Act\nfrom individuals on both ends of the U.S. political spectrum. Others responded to posts\nregarding Lynas with additional negative messaging targeting the company.\n\n**_Hashtags Used by DRAGONBRIDGE Accounts to Promote Messaging Surrounding_**\n**_Lynas_**\n\nWe identified the use of the following hashtags by DRAGONBRIDGE accounts:\n\nIn English: #lynas, #rareearth, #minerals, #australia, #news, #rareearthminerals,\n#lynasgetout. We note that these hashtags are also used by authentic accounts.\nIn Chinese: #lynas是污染源, #孩子需要健康的水源, #请停止和莱纳斯的合作, #lynas公\n司用人当白鼠 (Translation: #lynas is a source of pollution, #children need a healthy\nwater source, #please stop cooperating with Lynas, #lynas corporation uses people as\nguinea pigs)\n\n**Accounts Begin Targeting of Additional Rare Earths Mining and Manufacturing**\n**Companies Appia, USA Rare Earth in June**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn June, additional DRAGONBRIDGE social media accounts began targeting two additional\nrare earths mining and manufacturing companies, the Canadian rare earths mining company\nAppia Rare Earths & Uranium Corp and the American rare earths supplier USA Rare Earth.\nAccounts acted in response to announcements made by the respective companies regarding\npotential or planned operations, echoing previous criticisms centering around alleged\nenvironmental and labor concerns. Notably, DRAGONBRIDGE’s targeting of additional rare\nearths mining companies underscores the campaign’s ability to monitor developments and\nrespond accordingly, as well as its investment in attempting to ensure the PRC’s market\ndominance in the industry.\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE accounts targeted Appia with negative messaging in response to\nthe company’s announcement on June 1 that it had discovered a new rare earths\nbearing zone in Saskatchewan, Canada. As with the planned Lynas facility in Texas,\naccounts professed concern for the environmental implications of Appia’s actions and\nthe health of its workers.\n\nFollowing USA Rare Earth’s announcement of a planned rare earths manufacturing facility in\nOklahoma on June 9, DRAGONBRIDGE reiterated concerns surrounding the alleged impact\nof rare earths mining and processing, highlighting similar themes on the risks involved.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Newly identified DRAGONBRIDGE accounts criticizing the Canadian rare earths\nmining company Appia following its discovery of a new rare earths bearing zone in\nSaskatchewan, Canada\n\n### Newly Identified Accounts Posted Known DRAGONBRIDGE Content, Highlighting Attribution to Campaign\n\nWe observed multiple newly identified accounts promote the same content as previously\nidentified DRAGONBRIDGE accounts both prior to and following their promotion of content\npertaining to Lynas. This includes content critical of the Chinese businessman Guo Wengui\n(Miles Kwok), former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, and Chinese virologist Dr.\nYan Limeng, as well as narratives pertaining to the origin of COVID-19 (Figure 5). For\nexample, accounts promoted a report we judged to be falsely attributed to the Milk Tea\nAlliance, a pro-democracy network consisting primarily of netizens in Asia, which put forth\nmultiple theories on the origin of COVID-19. We have previously noted both criticism of these\nspecific individuals and COVID-19 origin theories as common themes in the\nDRAGONBRIDGE campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nAs with other DRAGONBRIDGE accounts we have previously identified, the newly identified\naccounts in this activity set have shown similar indicators of inauthenticity and coordination.\nFor example, accounts used profile photos appropriated from various online sources,\nincluding stock photography, animals, and cartoons, suggesting that they sought to\nobfuscate their identities; most of the Twitter accounts were created in clusters between\nMarch and June 2022, suggesting possible batch creation of the accounts, a tactic we have\npreviously observed with this campaign. Many of the usernames consisted of Englishlanguage names followed by seemingly random numeric strings. In addition to the accounts’\nposting of identical or similar rare earths-related content, we also observed some of the\naccounts post identical or similar apolitical content, such as inspirational quotes, wellness,\ntravel, and sports content.\n\nFigure 5: Sample tweets by accounts included narratives promoted by previously identified\nDRAGONBRIDGE activity, along with narratives critical of Lynas\n\n## Outlook\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE’s targeting of the rare earths industry broadly, and Lynas, Appia, and USA\nRare Earth specifically, demonstrates an interest in industries of strategic importance to the\nPRC that we had not previously observed from the campaign. Given Chinese President Xi\nJinping’s continued emphasis on a broad, holistic understanding of PRC national security\nthat encompasses areas including information and resource security, we may see other\nglobal competitors to PRC firms in other industries targeted by such information operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the DRAGONBRIDGE campaign has in this activity set demonstrated the use of\nincrementally more sophisticated tactics, such as the microtargeting of audiences favorable\nto its messaging and the leveraging of criticism by real individuals to support its narratives\nand agenda. However, its poor execution remains a limiting factor in the campaign’s ability to\neffectively garner significant engagement. We previously reported on the campaign’s\nattempts to physically mobilize protesters in the U.S. in September 2021, and noted then that\nthe campaign was unsuccessful in doing so. DRAGONBRIDGE’s recent activity attempts to\nincite protests against the Lynas facility in Texas in particular shows a similar interest in\ninfluencing real-world activity to achieve its objectives, and a similar failure in such attempts.\n\n\n-----",
