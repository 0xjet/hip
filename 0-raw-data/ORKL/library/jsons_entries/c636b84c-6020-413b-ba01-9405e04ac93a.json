In parallel, Volexity published an article with their analysis of related attacks, attributed to an](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nactor named “Dark Halo”. FireEye did not link this activity to any known actor; instead, they gave it an unknown, temporary moniker –\n“UNC2452”.\n\nThis attack is remarkable from many points of view, including its stealthiness, precision targeting and the custom malware leveraged by\nthe attackers, named “Sunburst” by FireEye.\n\n[In a previous blog, we dissected the method used by Sunburst to communicate with its C2 server and the protocol by which victims are](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\nupgraded for further exploitation. Similarly, many other security companies published their own analysis of the Sunburst backdoor,\nvarious operational details and how to defend against this attack. Yet, besides some media articles, no solid technical papers have\nbeen published that could potentially link it to previously known activity.\n\nWhile looking at the Sunburst backdoor, we discovered several features that overlap with a previously identified backdoor known as\n[Kazuar. Kazuar is a .NET backdoor first reported by Palo Alto in 2017. Palo Alto tentatively linked Kazuar to the Turla APT group,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\nalthough no solid attribution link has been made public. Our own observations indeed confirm that Kazuar was used together with other\nTurla tools during multiple breaches in past years.\n\nA number of unusual, shared features between Sunburst and Kazuar include the victim UID generation algorithm, the sleeping\nalgorithm and the extensive usage of the FNV-1a hash.\n\nWe describe these similarities in detail below.\n\n**For a summary of this analysis and FAQs, feel free to scroll down to “Conclusions“.**\n\nWe believe it’s important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more\n**facts about Kazuar and the origin of Sunburst, the malware used in the SolarWinds breach. If we consider past experience, looking**\nback to the WannaCry attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus group. In time, more evidence\nappeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research on this topic can be crucial in\n**connecting the dots.**\n\n**More information about UNC2452, DarkHalo, Sunburst and Kazuar is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence**\n**Reporting service. Contact: intelreports[at]kaspersky.com**\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Background\n\nWhile looking at the Sunburst backdoor, we discovered several features that overlap with a previously identified backdoor known as\nKazuar. Kazuar is a .NET backdoor first [reported by Palo Alto in 2017.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\n\nThroughout the years, Kazuar has been under constant development. Its developers have been regularly improving it, switching from\none obfuscator to another, changing algorithms and updating features. We looked at all versions of Kazuar since 2015, in order to\nbetter understand its development timeline.\n\n\n-----\n\n_p_\n\nIn the following sections, we look at some of the similarities between Kazuar and Sunburst. First, we will discuss how a particular\nfeature is used in Kazuar, and then we will describe the implementation of the same feature in Sunburst.\n\n### Comparison of the sleeping algorithms\n\nBoth Kazuar and Sunburst have implemented a delay between connections to a C2 server, likely designed to make the network activity\nless obvious.\n\n**Kazuar**\n\nKazuar calculates the time it sleeps between two C2 server connections as follows: it takes two timestamps, the minimal sleeping time\nand the maximal sleeping time, and calculates the waiting period with the following formula:\n\n```\ngenerated_sleeping_time = sleeping_timemin + x (sleeping_timemax - sleeping_timemin)\n\n```\n\nwhere x is a random floating-point number ranging from 0 to 1 obtained by calling the NextDouble method, while sleeping_timemin\nand sleeping_timemax are time periods obtained from the C2 configuration which can be changed with the help of a backdoor\ncommand. As a result of the calculations, the generated time will fall in the [sleeping_timemin, sleeping_timemax] range. By default,\n**_sleeping_timemin equals two weeks and sleeping_timemax equals four weeks in most samples of Kazuar we analysed. After_**\ncalculating the sleeping time, it invokes the Sleep method in a loop.\n\nKazuar implements this algorithm in the following lines of code (class names were omitted from the code for clarity):\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n\nlong random_multiplication(Random random_0, long long_0) {\n\nreturn (long)(random_0.NextDouble() * (double)long_0);\n\n}\n\nTimeSpan get_randomized_sleeping_time(Random random_0, TimeSpan timeSpan_0, TimeSpan timeSpan_1) {\n\nif (timeSpan_0 > timeSpan_1) {\n\nTimeSpan timeSpan = timeSpan_0;\n\ntimeSpan_0 = timeSpan_1;\n\ntimeSpan_1 = timeSpan;\n\n}\n\nlong num = random_multiplication(random_0, timeSpan_1.Ticks - timeSpan_0.Ticks);\n\n// randomize the sleeping time\n\nreturn new TimeSpan(timeSpan_0.Ticks + num);\n\n}\n\nTimeSpan get_remaining_time(TimeSpan timeSpan_0, TimeSpan timeSpan_1) {\n\nif (!(timeSpan_0 > timeSpan_1)) {\n\nreturn timeSpan_0;\n\n}\n\nreturn timeSpan_1;\n\n}\n\nvoid wait_between_connections() {\n\nfor (;;) { // the sleeping loop\n\nTimeSpan[] array = get_min_and_max_sleep_time();\n\n/* the previous line retrieves sleeping_time_min and sleeping_time_max from the configuration */\n\nTimeSpan timeSpan = get_randomized_sleeping_time(this.random_number, array[0], array[1]);\n\nDateTime last_c2_connection = get_last_c2_connection();\n\nTimeSpan timeSpan2 = DateTime.Now - last_c2_connection;\n\nif (timeSpan2 >= timeSpan) {\n\nbreak;\n\n/* enough time has passed, the backdoor may connect to the C2 server */\n\n}\n\nTimeSpan timeout = get_remaining_time(timeSpan - timeSpan2, this.timespan); // this.timespan equals 1 minute\n\nThread.Sleep(timeout);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n\n**Sunburst**\n\nSunburst uses exactly the same formula to calculate sleeping time, relying on NextDouble to generate a random number. It then calls\nthe sleeping function in a loop. The only difference is that the code is somewhat less complex. Below we compare an extract of the\nsleeping algorithm found in Kazuar and the code discovered in Sunburst.\n\n**Kazuar** **Sunburst**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe listed code is used in multiple versions of the backdoor, including samples with\nMD5 150D0ADDF65B6524EB92B9762DB6F074 (2016) and\n1F70BEF5D79EFBDAC63C9935AA353955 (2019+).\n\nThe random waiting time generation algorithm and the sleeping loop.\n\n\nMD5\n2C4A910A1299CDAE2A4E55988A2F102E.\n\nThe random waiting time generation\nalgorithm and the sleeping loop.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\nlong random_multiplication(Random random_0, long long_0) {\n\nreturn (long)(random_0.NextDouble() * (double)long_0);\n\n}\n\nTimeSpan get_randomized_sleeping_time(Random random_0,\n\nTimeSpan timeSpan_0, TimeSpan timeSpan_1)\n\n{\n\nif (timeSpan_0 > timeSpan_1)\n\n{\n\nTimeSpan timeSpan = timeSpan_0;\n\ntimeSpan_0 = timeSpan_1;\n\ntimeSpan_1 = timeSpan;\n\n}\n\nlong num = random_multiplication(random_0,\n\ntimeSpan_1.Ticks - timeSpan_0.Ticks);\n\nreturn new TimeSpan(timeSpan_0.Ticks + num);\n\n}\n\nvoid wait_between_connections() {\n\nfor (;;) {\n\n...\n\nif (timeSpan2 >= timeSpan) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nTimeSpan timeout = get_remaining_time(timeSpan - timeSpan2,\n\nthis.timespan);\n\nThread.Sleep(timeout);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\nprivate static void DelayMs(double\nminMs, double maxMs)\n\n{\n\nif ((int)maxMs == 0)\n\n{\n\nminMs = 1000.0;\n\nmaxMs = 2000.0;\n\n}\n\ndouble num;\n\nfor (num = minMs + new\nRandom().NextDouble() * (maxMs minMs);\n\nnum >= 2147483647.0; num -=\n2147483647.0)\n\n{\n\nThread.Sleep(int.MaxValue);\n\n}\n\nThread.Sleep((int)num);\n\n}\n\n\nComparing the two code fragments outlined above, we see that the algorithms are similar.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that both Kazuar and Sunburst wait for quite a long time before or in-between C2 connections. By default, Kazuar\n**chooses a random sleeping time between two and four weeks, while Sunburst waits from 12 to 14 days. Sunburst, like Kazuar,**\nimplements a command which allows the operators to change the waiting time between two C2 connections.\n\nBased on the analysis of the sleeping algorithm, we conclude:\n\nKazuar and Sunburst use the same mathematical formula, relying on Random().NextDouble() to calculate the waiting time\nKazuar randomly selects a sleeping period between two and four weeks between C2 connections\nSunburst randomly selects a sleeping period between twelve and fourteen days before contacting its C2\n\n\n-----\n\nSuch long sleep periods in C2 connections are not very common for typical APT malware\nWhile Kazuar does a Thread.Sleep using a TimeSpan object, Sunburst uses an Int32 value; due to the fact that Int32.MaxValue is\nlimited to roughly 24 days of sleep, the developers “emulate” longer sleeps in a loop to get past this limitation\nIn case of both Kazuar and Sunburst, the sleeping time between two connections can be changed with the help of a command\nsent by the C2 server\n\n### The FNV-1a hashing algorithm\n\nSunburst uses the FNV-1a [hashing algorithm extensively throughout its code. This detail initially attracted our attention and we tried to](https://create.stephan-brumme.com/fnv-hash/)\nlook for other malware that uses the same algorithm. It should be pointed out that the usage of this hashing algorithm is not unique to\nKazuar and Sunburst. However, it provides an interesting starting point for finding more similarities. FNV-1a has been widely used by\nthe Kazuar .NET Backdoor since its early versions. We compare the usage of FNV-1a in Kazuar and Sunburst below.\n\n**Kazuar**\n\nThe shellcode used in Kazuar finds addresses of library functions with a variation of the FNV-1a hashing algorithm. The way of finding\nthese addresses is traditional: the shellcode traverses the export address table of a DLL, fetches the name of an API function, hashes\nit and then compares the hash with a given value.\n\n_A variation of the FNV-1a hashing algorithm in Kazuar shellcode present in 2015-autumn 2020 samples, using a 0x1000197 modified constant_\n\n_instead of the default FNV_32_PRIME 0x1000193 (MD5 150D0ADDF65B6524EB92B9762DB6F074)_\n\nThis customized FNV-1a 32-bit hashing algorithm has been present in the Kazuar shellcode since 2015. For the Kazuar binaries used\nin 2020, a modified 64-bit FNV-1a appeared in the code:\n\n**Kazuar**\n\nMD5 804785B5ED71AADF9878E7FC4BA4295C (Dec 2020).\n\nImplementation of a modified FNV-1a algorithm (64-bit version).\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n\npublic static ulong bu(string pK)\n\n{\n\nbyte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(pK);\n\nulong num = 0xCBF29CE484222325UL;\n\nulong num2 = 0x69294589840FB0E8UL;\n\nulong num3 = 0x100000001B3UL;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)\n\n{\n\nnum ^= (ulong)bytes[i];\n\nnum *= num3;\n\n}\n\nreturn num ^ num2;\n\n}\n\n\nWe observed that the 64-bit FNV-1a hash present in the 2020 Kazuar sample is also not standard. When the loop with the XOR and\nmultiplication operations finishes execution, the resulting value is XOR-ed with a constant (XOR 0x69294589840FB0E8UL). In the\noriginal implementation of the FNV-1a hash, no XOR operation is applied after the loop.\n\n**Sunburst**\n\nSunburst uses a modified, 64-bit FNV-1a hash for the purpose of string obfuscation. For example, when started, Sunburst first takes\nthe FNV-1a hash of its process name (solarwinds.businesslayerhost) and checks if it is equal to a hardcoded value\n(0xEFF8D627F39A2A9DUL). If the hashes do not coincide, the backdoor code will not be executed:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\npublic static void Initialize()\n\n{\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nif (OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.GetHash(Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName.ToLower()) ==\n0xEFF8D627F39A2A9DUL) //\"solarwinds.businesslayerhost\"\n\n{\n\n// backdoor execution code\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\n\nHashes are also used to detect security tools running on the system. During its execution Sunburst iterates through the list of\nprocesses (Process.GetProcesses()), services (from “SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\services“) and drivers (WMI, “Select * From\n_Win32_SystemDriver“), hashes their names and looks them up in arrays containing the corresponding hardcoded hashes:_\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\nprivate static bool SearchAssemblies(Process[] processes)\n\n{\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < processes.Length; i++)\n\n{\n\nulong hash = OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.GetHash(processes[i].ProcessName.ToLower());\n\nif (Array.IndexOf<ulong>(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.assemblyTimeStamps, hash) != -1)\n\n{\n\nreturn true;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn false;\n\n}\n\n\nBelow we compare the modified FNV-1a implementations of the two algorithms in Kazuar and Sunburst.\n\n**String obfuscation comparison**\n\n**Kazuar** **Sunburst**\n\n\nCode adapted from MD5 804785B5ED71AADF9878E7FC4BA4295C (Dec 2020).\nImplementation of a modified 64-bit FNV-1a algorithm (deobfuscated, with constant\nfolding applied).\n\n\nMD5\n2C4A910A1299CDAE2A4E55988A2F102E.\n\nImplementation of the modified 64-bit FNV1a algorithm.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n\npublic static ulong bu(string pK)\n\n{\n\nbyte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(pK);\n\nulong num = 0xCBF29CE484222325UL;\n\nulong num2 = 0x69294589840FB0E8UL;\n\nulong num3 = 0x100000001B3UL;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)\n\n{\n\nnum ^= (ulong)bytes[i];\n\nnum *= num3;\n\n}\n\nreturn num ^ num2;\n\n}\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n\nprivate static ulong GetHash(string\ns)\n\n{\n\nulong num =\n0xCBF29CE484222325UL;\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nforeach (byte b in\nEncoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s))\n\n{\n\nnum ^= (ulong)b;\n\nnum *= 0x100000001B3UL;\n\n}\n\n}\n\ncatch\n\n{\n\n}\n\nreturn num ^\n0x5BAC903BA7D81967UL;\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that both Kazuar and Sunburst use a modified 64 bit FNV 1a hash, which adds an extra step after the loop, XOR ing\nthe final result with a 64-bit constant.\n\nSome readers might assume that the FNV-1a hashing was inserted by the compiler because C# compilers can optimize switch\nstatements with strings into a series of if statements. In this compiler optimized code, the 32-bit FNV-1a algorithm is used to calculate\nhashes of strings:\n\n**Clean executable** **Sunburst**\n\nOptimized switch statement.

In fact, the C# compiler uses 32bit, not 64-bit hashing. The hashing algorithm added by the compiler also does not have an additional XOR operation in the end. The\ncompiler inserts the hashing method in the class, while in Sunburst the same code is implemented within the\n_OrionImprovementBusinessLayer class. The compiler-emitted FNV-1a method will have the ComputeStringHash name. In case of_\nSunburst, the name of the method is GetHash. Additionally, the compiler inserts a check which compares the hashed string with a\nhardcoded value in order to eliminate the possibility of a collision. In Sunburst, there are no such string comparisons, which suggests\nthese hash checks are not a compiler optimization.\n\nTo conclude the findings, we summarize them as follows:\n\nBoth Sunburst and Kazuar use FNV-1a hashing throughout their code\nA modified 32-bit FNV-1a hashing algorithm has been used by the Kazuar shellcode since 2015 to resolve APIs\nThis Kazuar shellcode uses a modified FNV-1a hash where its FNV_32_PRIME is 0x1000197 (instead of the default\n_FNV 32 PRIME 0x1000193)_\n\n\n-----\n\nA modified 64 bit version of the FNV 1a hashing algorithm was implemented in Kazuar versions found in 2020\nThe modified 64-bit FNV-1a hashing algorithms implemented in Kazuar (November and December 2020 variants) have one extra\nstep: after the hash is calculated, it is XORed with a hardcoded constant (0x69294589840FB0E8UL)\nSunburst also uses a modified 64-bit FNV-1a hashing algorithm, with one extra step: after the hash is calculated, it is XORed with\na hardcoded constant (0x5BAC903BA7D81967UL)\n**The 64-bit constant used in the last step of the hashing is different between Kazuar and Sunburst**\nThe aforementioned hashing algorithm is used to conceal plain strings in Sunburst\n\n### The algorithm used to generate victim identifiers\n\nAnother similarity between Kazuar and Sunburst can be found in the algorithm used to generate the unique victim identifiers, described\nbelow.\n\n**Kazuar**\n\nIn order to generate unique strings (across different victims), such as client identifiers, mutexes or file names, Kazuar uses an algorithm\nwhich accepts a string as input. To derive a unique string from the given one, the backdoor gets the MD5 hash of the string and then\nXORs it with a four-byte unique “seed” from the machine. The seed is obtained by fetching the serial number of the volume where the\noperating system is installed.\n\n**Sunburst**\n\nAn MD5+XOR algorithm can also be found in Sunburst. However, instead of the volume serial number, it uses a different set of\ninformation as the machine’s unique seed, hashes it with MD5 then it XORs the two hash halves together.

In the past, we have seen sophisticated\nattacks such as [OlympicDestroyer confusing the industry and complicating attribution. Subtle mistakes, such as the raw re-use of the](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/)\nRich header from the Lazarus samples from the Bangladesh bank heist, allowed us to demonstrate that they were indeed false flags\nand allowed us to eventually connect OlympicDestroyer with Hades, a sophisticated APT group.\n\nSupposing that Kazuar false flags were deliberately introduced into Sunburst, there are two main explanations of how this may have\nhappened:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The use of XOR operation after the main FNV 1a computation was introduced in the 2020 Kazuar variants after it had appeared\n\nin the Sunburst code. In this case, the possibility of a false flag is less likely as the authors of Sunburst couldn’t have predicted\nthe Kazuar’s developers’ actions with such high precision.\n2. A sample of Kazuar was released before Sunburst was written, containing the modified 64-bit hash function, and went unnoticed\n\nby everyone except the Sunburst developers. In this case, the Sunburst developers must have been aware of new Kazuar\nvariants. Obviously, tracing all modifications of unknown code is quite a difficult and tedious task for the following reasons:\n\nKazuar’s developers are constantly changing their code as well as the packing methods, thus making it harder to detect the\nbackdoor with YARA rules;\nKazuar samples (especially the new ones) quite rarely appear on VirusTotal.\n\nThe second argument comes with a caveat; the earliest Sunburst sample with the modified algorithm we have seen was compiled in\nFebruary 2020, while the new Kazuar was compiled in or around November 2020. In the spring and summer of 2020, “old” samples of\nKazuar were actively used, without the 64-bit modified FNV-1a hash. This means that option 1 (the extra XOR was introduced in the\n2020 Kazuar variants after it had appeared in Sunburst) is more likely.\n\n### November 2020 – a new Kazuar\n\nIn November 2020, some significant changes happened to Kazuar. On November 18, our products detected a previously unknown\nKazuar sample (MD5 9A2750B3E1A22A5B614F6189EC2D67FA). In this sample, the code was refactored, and the malware became\nmuch stealthier as most of its code no longer resembled that of the older versions. Here are the most important changes in Kazuar’s\ncode:\n\nThe infamous “Kazuar’s {0} started in process {1} [{2}] as user {3}/{4}.” string was removed from the binary and replaced with\na much subtler “Agent started inside {0}.” message, meaning that the backdoor is no longer called Kazuar in the logs. Despite\nthat, the GUID, which was present in Kazuar since 2015 and serves as the backdoor’s unique identifier, still appears in the\nrefactored version of Kazuar.\nDepending on the configuration, the malware may now protect itself from being detected by the Anti-Malware Scan Interface by\npatching the first bytes of the AmsiScanBuffer API function.\nNew spying features have been added to the backdoor. Now Kazuar is equipped with a keylogger and a password stealer which\ncan fetch browser history data, cookies, proxy server credentials and, most importantly, passwords from Internet browsers,\nFilezilla, Outlook, Git and WinSCP. It also gets vault credentials. The stealer is implemented in the form of a C2 server command.\nCommands have been completely revamped. The system information retrieval function now also hunts for UAC settings and\ninstalled hot patches and drivers. The webcam shot-taking command has been completely removed from the backdoor.\nCommands which allow the execution of WMI commands and the running of arbitrary PowerShell, VBS and JS scripts have been\nintroduced into Kazuar. The malware can now also gather forensic data (“forensic” is a name of a command present in the\nrefactored version of Kazuar). Kazuar collects information about executables that run at startup, recently launched executables\nand compatibility assistant settings. Furthermore, a command to collect saved credentials from files left from unattended\ninstallation and IIS has been introduced into the backdoor.\nThe data is now exfiltrated to the C2 server using ZIP archives instead of TAR.\nA class that implements parsing of different file formats has been added into Kazuar. It is currently not used anywhere in the\ncode. This class can throw exceptions with the “Fucking poltergeist” text. In earlier versions of Kazuar, a “Shellcode fucking\npoltergeist error” message was logged if there was a problem with shellcode.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MD5 XOR algorithm is not as widely used as before in the latest version of Kazuar. The backdoor generates most of unique\nstrings and identifiers with an algorithm which is based on the already discussed FNV-1a hash and Base62. The MD5+XOR\nalgorithm itself has been modified. Its new implementation is given below:\n\n**Kazuar (2020). The modified MD5+XOR algorithm.**\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n\npublic static string ZK(string X, string JK = null)\n\n{\n\nif (YU.fG(JK))\n\n{\n\nJK = oR.d6;\n\n}\n\nstring str = X.ToLower();\n\nstring s = \"pipename-\" + str + \"-\" + JK;\n\nbyte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s);\n\nbyte[] array = MD5.Create().ComputeHash(bytes);\n\nbyte b = 42;\n\nbyte b2 = 17;\n\nbyte b3 = 21;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)\n\n{\n\nb = (b * b2 & byte.MaxValue);\n\nb = (b + b3 & byte.MaxValue);\n\nbyte[] array2 = array;\n\nint num = i;\n\narray2[num] ^= b;\n\n}\n\nGuid guid = new Guid(array);\n\nreturn guid.ToString(\"B\").ToUpper();\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\nThe random sleeping interval generation algorithm mentioned in the main part of the report also appears to be missing from the\n[updated backdoor sample. In order to generate a random sleeping period, the malware now uses a more orthodox random](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383548/how-to-generate-pseudo-random-number-between-a-to-b-a-b-are-intin-gnu-c-just-w)\nnumber generation algorithm:\n\n**Kazuar (2020). The new random number generation algorithm. Methods were renamed for clarity.**\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\npublic static long generate_random_number_in_range(long wG, long NG)\n\n{\n\nif (wG > NG)\n\n{\n\nutility_class.swap<long>(ref wG, ref NG);\n\n}\n\nreturn Math.Abs(utility_class.get_random_int64()) % (NG - wG + 1L) + wG;\n\n}\n\n\nThe newest sample of Kazuar (MD5 024C46493F876FA9005047866BA3ECBD) was detected by our products on December 29. It\nalso contained refactored code.\n\nFor now, it’s unclear why the Kazuar developers implemented these massive code changes in November. Some possibilities include:\n\nIt’s a normal evolution of the codebase, where new features are constantly added while older ones are moved\nThe Kazuar developers wanted to avoid detection by various antivirus products or EDR solutions\nSuspecting the SolarWinds attack might be discovered, the Kazuar code was changed to resemble the Sunburst backdoor as\nlittle as possible\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThese code overlaps between Kazuar and Sunburst are interesting and represent the first potential identified link to a previously known\nmalware family.\n\nAlthough the usage of the sleeping algorithm may be too wide, the custom implementation of the FNV-1a hashes and the reuse of the\nMD5+XOR algorithm in Sunburst are definitely important clues. We should also point out that although similar, the UID calculation\nsubroutine and the FNV-1a hash usage, as well the sleep loop, are still not 100% identical.\n\nPossible explanations for these similarities include:\n\nSunburst was developed by the same group as Kazuar\nThe Sunburst developers adopted some ideas or code from Kazuar, without having a direct connection (they used Kazuar as an\ninspiration point)\nBoth groups, DarkHalo/UNC2452 and the group using Kazuar, obtained their malware from the same source\nSome of the Kazuar developers moved to another team, taking knowledge and tools with them\nThe Sunburst developers introduced these subtle links as a form of false flag, in order to shift blame to another group\n\nAt the moment, we do not know which one of these options is true. While Kazuar and Sunburst may be related, the nature of this\nrelation is still not clear. Through further analysis, it is possible that evidence confirming one or several of these points might arise. At\nthe same time, it is also possible that the Sunburst developers were really good at their opsec and didn’t make any mistakes, with this\nlink being an elaborate false flag. In any case, this overlap doesn’t change much for the defenders. Supply chain attacks are some of\nthe most sophisticated types of attacks nowadays and have been successfully used in the past by APT groups such as\nWinnti/Barium/APT41 and various cybercriminal groups.\n\nTo limit exposure to supply chain attacks, we recommend the following:\n\nIsolate network management software in separate VLANs, monitor them separately from the user networks\nLimit outgoing internet connections from servers or appliances that run third party software\nImplement regular memory dumping and analysis; checking for malicious code running in a decrypted state using a code\nsimilarity solution such as Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE)\n\n\n-----\n\nMore information about UNC2452, DarkHalo, Sunburst and Kazuar is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting\nservice. Contact: intelreports[at]kaspersky.com\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. TLDR; just tell us who’s behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack?\n\nHonestly, we don’t know. What we found so far is a couple of code similarities between Sunburst and a malware discovered in\n2017, called Kazuar. This malware was first observed around 2015 and is still being used in the wild. The most advanced Kazuar\nsample we found is from December 2020. During five years of Kazuar evolution, we observed a continuous development, in\nwhich significant features, which bear resemblance to Sunburst, were added. While these similarities between Kazuar and\nSunburst are notable, there could be a lot of reasons for their existence, including:\n\nSunburst was developed by the same group as Kazuar\nThe Sunburst developers used some ideas or code from Kazuar, without having a direct connection (they used Kazuar code\nas “inspiration”)\nBoth groups, that is, the DarkHalo/UNC2452 and the group using Kazuar obtained their malware from the same source\nOne of the Kazuar developers moved to another team, taking his knowledge and tools with them\nThe Sunburst developers introduced these subtle links as a form of a false flag, in order to shift the blame to another group\nAt the moment, we simply do not know which of these options is true. Through further analysis, it is possible that evidence\nenforcing one or several of these points might arise. To clarify – we are NOT saying that DarkHalo / UNC2452, the group\n**using Sunburst, and Kazuar or Turla are the same.**\n\n2. What are these similarities? Could these similarities be just coincidences?\n\nIn principle, none of these algorithms or implementations are unique. In particular, the things that attracted our attention were the\nobfuscation of strings through modified FNV-1a algorithms, where the hash result is XOR’ed with a 64-bit constant, the\nimplementation of the C2 connection delay, using a large (and unusual) value (Kazuar uses a random sleeping time between two\nand four weeks, while Sunburst waits from 12 to 14 days) and the calculation of the victim UID through an MD5 + XOR algorithm.\nIt should be pointed that none of these code fragments are 100% identical. Nevertheless, they are curious coincidences, to\nsay at least. One coincidence wouldn’t be that unusual, two coincidences would definitively raise an eyebrow, while three such\ncoincidences are kind of suspicious to us.\n3. What is this Kazuar malware?\n\nKazuar is a fully featured .NET backdoor, and was first [reported by our colleagues from Palo Alto Networks in 2017. The](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\nresearchers surmised at the time that it may have been used by the Turla APT group, in order to replace their Carbon platform\nand other Turla second stage backdoors. Our own observations confirm that Kazuar was used, together with other Turla tools,\n[during multiple breaches in the past few years, and is still in use. Also, Epic Turla resolves imports with another customized](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545)\nversion of the FNV-1a hash and has code similarities with Kazuar’s shellcode.\n4. So Sunburst is connected to Turla?\n\nNot necessarily, refer to question 1 for all possible explanations.\n5. The media claims APT29 is responsible for the SolarWinds hack. Are you saying that’s wrong?\n\nWe do not know who is behind the SolarWinds hack – we believe attribution is a question better left for law enforcement and\njudicial institutions. To clarify, our research has identified a number of shared code features between the Sunburst malware and\nKazuar.\n\nOur research has placed APT29 as another potential name for “The Dukes”, which appears to be an umbrella group comprising\n[multiple actors and malware families. We initially reported MiniDuke, the earliest malware in this umbrella, in 2013. In 2014, we](https://securelist.com/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/31112/)\n[reported other malware used by “The Dukes”, named CosmicDuke. In CosmicDuke, the debug path strings from the malware](https://securelist.com/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/64107/)\nseemed to indicate several build environments or groups of “users” of the “Bot Gen Studio”: “NITRO” and “Nemesis Gemina”. In\nshort, we suspect CosmicDuke was being leveraged by up to three different entities, raising the possibility it was shared across\ngroups. One of the interesting observations from our 2014 research was the usage of a webshell by one of the “Bot Gen Studio” /\n“CosmicDuke” entities that we have seen before in use by Turla. This could suggest that Turla is possibly just one of the several\nusers of the tools under the “Dukes” umbrella.\n6. How is this connected to Cozy Duke?\n\n[In 2015, we published futher research on CozyDuke, which seemed to focus on what appeared to be government organizations](https://securelist.com/the-cozyduke-apt/69731/)\nand commercial entities in the US, Germany and other countries. In 2014, their targets, as reported in the media, included the\n[White House and the US Department of State. At the time, the media also called it “the worst ever” hack. At the moment, we do](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/state-department-hack-worst-ever/)\nnot see any direct links between the 2015 CozyDuke and the SolarWinds attack.\n7. How solid are the links with Kazuar?\n\nSeveral code fragments from Sunburst and various generations of Kazuar are quite similar. We should point out that, although\nsimilar, these code blocks, such as the UID calculation subroutine and the FNV-1a hashing algorithm usage, as well the\n**sleep loop, are still not 100% identical. Together with certain development choices, these suggest that a kind of a similar**\nthought process went into the development of Kazuar and Sunburst. The Kazuar malware continued to evolve and later 2020\nvariants are even more similar, in some respect, to the Sunburst branch. Yet, we should emphasise again, they are definitely not\nidentical.\n\n\n-----\n\n8. So, are you saying Sunburst is essentially a modified Kazuar?\n\nWe are not saying Sunburst is Kazuar, or that it is the work of the Turla APT group. We spotted some interesting similarities\nbetween these two malware families and felt the world should know about them. We love to do our part, contributing our findings\nto the community discussions; others can check these similarities on their own, draw their own conclusions and find more links.\nWhat is the most important thing here is to publish interesting findings and encourage others to do more research. We will, of\ncourse, continue with our own research too.\n9. Is this the worst cyberattack in history?\n\nAttacks should always be judged from the victim’s point of view. It should also account for physical damage, if any, loss of human\nlives and so on. For now, it would appear the purpose of this attack was cyberespionage, that is, extraction of sensitive\ninformation. By comparison, other infamous attacks, such as NotPetya or WannaCry had a significantly destructive side, with\nvictim losses in the billions of dollars. Yet, for some out there, this may be more devastating than NotPetya or WannaCry; for\nothers, it pales in comparison.\n10. How did we get here?\n\nDuring the past years, we’ve observed what can be considered a “cyber arms race”. Pretty much all nation states have rushed,\nsince the early 2000s, to develop offensive military capabilities in cyberspace, with little attention to defense. The difference is\nimmediately notable when it comes to the budgets available for the purchase of offensive cyber capabilities vs the development of\ndefensive capabilities. The world needs more balance to the (cyber-)force. Without that, the existing cyber conflicts will continue\nto escalate, to the detriment of the normal internet user.\n11. Is it possible this is a false flag?\n\nIn theory, anything is possible; and we have seen examples of sophisticated false flag attacks, such as the OlympicDestroyer\nattack. For a full list of possible explanations refer to question 1.\n12. So. Now what?\n\nWe believe it’s important that other researchers around the world also investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more\nfacts about Kazuar and the origin of Sunburst, the malware used in the SolarWinds breach. If we consider past experience, for\ninstance looking back to the WannaCry attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus group. In\ntime, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research on this\n**topic can be crucial to connecting the dots.**\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**File hashes:**\n\n[E220EAE9F853193AFE77567EA05294C8 (First detected Kazuar sample, compiled in 2015)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/E220EAE9F853193AFE77567EA05294C8/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[150D0ADDF65B6524EB92B9762DB6F074 (Kazuar sample compiled in 2016)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/150D0ADDF65B6524EB92B9762DB6F074/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[54700C4CA2854858A572290BCD5501D4 (Kazuar sample compiled in 2017)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/54700C4CA2854858A572290BCD5501D4/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[053DDB3B6E38F9BDBC5FB51FDD44D3AC (Kazuar sample compiled in 2018)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/053DDB3B6E38F9BDBC5FB51FDD44D3AC/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[1F70BEF5D79EFBDAC63C9935AA353955 (Kazuar sample compiled in 2019)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/1F70BEF5D79EFBDAC63C9935AA353955/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[9A2750B3E1A22A5B614F6189EC2D67FA (Kazuar sample used in November 2020)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/9A2750B3E1A22A5B614F6189EC2D67FA/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[804785B5ED71AADF9878E7FC4BA4295C (Kazuar sample used in December 2020)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/804785B5ED71AADF9878E7FC4BA4295C/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[024C46493F876FA9005047866BA3ECBD (Most recent Kazuar sample)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/024C46493F876FA9005047866BA3ECBD/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[2C4A910A1299CDAE2A4E55988A2F102E (Sunburst sample)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/2C4A910A1299CDAE2A4E55988A2F102E/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**More information about UNC2452, DarkHalo, Sunburst and Kazuar is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence**\n**Reporting service.
