These kits were the major, initial infection methods used by hackers\nto carry out major malware campaigns or advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks.\n\nIn 2020, EKs were not considered a potential threat vector for client-side attacks because phishing attacks and other social engineering\nattacks emerged as the significant threat vector. Based on Cyble’s research, we have found that\nthe recent Spelevo EK targeted the vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash Player.\n\nIn the past, the Spelevo EK was found to be delivering payloads such as Ursnif and Qakbot. In a recent campaign in March 2021, we\nobserved the same EK delivering ZLoader payload files. The Spelevo EK campaign was seen to be targeting US users with the flash\nvulnerability. The initial findings can be attributed to Malware Traffic Analysis. The image below showcases the popular PopCash site,\ncompromised by EK and redirecting to a landing page.\n\nAfter successful redirection to the landing page, the malicious flash file is dropped on the victim machine based on client vulnerability. The\nlanding page script and flash file delivery are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution of the malicious flash file, it drops and executes the ZLoader payload on the victim’s machine. The\nimage below showcases the decompiled malicious flash file.\n\nAfter exploitation, Spelevo EK redirects the user to google.com, typically after a 60-seconds delay, and the code snippet for the same is shown\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpear phishing delivers ZLoader:\n\nZLoader also targets users through phishing campaigns with maliciously crafted MS Office attachments. As showcased in the image below, we\ndiscovered this campaign to be circulating as a compensation claim.\n\nUpon execution of the malicious macro, it downloads and executes the payload on the victim machine. The attachment also displays a\nSecurity Warning that urges the user to enable macros.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following Wireshark capture showcases the payload delivery on the victim machine.\n\nTechnical analysis of the payload:\n\nThe payload file that we have analysed is: SHA256:”9ef6c5467fd80274e6a37e2883a5e83a894cf2148ce37bf0adb1e884acbc4c0b”\n\nIt is a VC compiled malware COM DLL file with multiple exports. The following image shows the malware payload file with its export functions.\n\n\n-----\n\nZLoader has many anti-debugging, evasion techniques and does process injection. The malware uses other techniques such as custom\nencrypted network communication and Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) for command-and-control (C&C) domains etc.\n\nZLoader is notable variant of the Zeus banking malware which was identified in 2006. This banking malware typically targets users to steal\ncredentials and other sensitive financial information. Finally, with these stolen credentials threat actors can perform illicit financial\ntransactions from the victim’s banking account by logging into their devices. It has been observed that after a few months’ break, the same\nmalware campaign reappears with different Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).\n\nCyble will continue to track these new malware activities to collect advanced threat intelligence related to the campaign.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK:**\n\n\n**Initial Access** **Persistence** **Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\n\n**Defence Evasion** **Credential**\n**Access**\n\n[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/)\nInput\nCapture\n\n\n**Discovery** **Collection** **Command**\n**and**\n**Control**\n\n\nSecurity\n[Software](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/)\nDiscovery\n\n\n[Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) DLL SideLoading\n\n\nProcess\nInjection\n\n\nInput\nCapture\n\nArchive\n[Collected](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/)\nData\n\n\nEncrypted\nChannel\n\nNonApplication\nLayer\nProtocol\n\nApplication\n[Layer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/)\nProtocol\n\n\n[Driver-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/) DLL SideLoading\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n[Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001/) Process\nDiscovery\n\n\nObfuscated Files\nor Information\n\n\nSystem\n[Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\nDiscovery\n\n\n[DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.blackbot.io/techniques/T1574/002/) File and\n[Directory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\nDiscovery\n\n\nf8ba1699d9c63a2bcdb4fe48cd229074e2ab87512891d6c6adff6bd838847c11 f5493ea3f2e6b61670be5ec8fcf6951f425476db2a5fe8c18ecd07ee7\n\nfbc4ff74fc7ee03fd3c451b6f20a820cb7bea5dbef4efa19aa567f6bfae58d48\n\n\n-----\n\n9ef6c5467fd80274e6a37e2883a5e83a894cf2148ce37bf0adb1e884acbc4c0b ce9d8545eb14f98f81526457b784ada2e37057dae2d74f625e47b4e\n\nhxxp://195.123.208[.]172/44300,5396033565[.]dat/\n\n31f81d3319ad104bcd6afcc114c5d2de073af83feb5db8f187af79a09d930599\n\n**Our Recommendations:**\n\nBlock the IoCs shared above.\nWe encourage our customers to conduct investigations and implement proactive measures for identifying previous campaigns and\npreventing future ones that may target their systems.\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected devices wherever possible and\npragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.\nPeople concerned about their exposure in the Dark web can register at [AmiBreached.com to ascertain their exposure.](https://cyble.io/amibreached)\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\n**About Cyble:**\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from cybercrimes and exposure in](https://cyble.com/)\nthe darkweb.
