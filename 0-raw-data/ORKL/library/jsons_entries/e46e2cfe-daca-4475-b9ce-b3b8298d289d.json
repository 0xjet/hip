The Complete Breakdown\n\n**[crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)**\n\nAlexander Hanel January 10, 2019\n\n**WIZARD SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating the Ryuk**\n**ransomware since August 2018, targeting large organizations for a high-ransom return.**\n[This methodology, known as “big game hunting,” signals a shift in operations for WIZARD](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyber-big-game-hunting/)\n[SPIDER. This actor is a Russia-based criminal group known for the operation of the TrickBot](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/trickbot/)\nbanking malware that had focused primarily on wire fraud in the past.\n\nThe actor name GRIM SPIDER was introduced into CrowdStrike’s nomenclature in\nSeptember 2018 for the group that operates the Ryuk ransomware as a distinct sub-group of\nthe WIZARD SPIDER criminal enterprise. However, in June 2019, further evidence emerged\nthat allowed CrowdStrike to assess with high confidence that Ryuk is in fact operated as part\nof the core WIZARD SPIDER actor group.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence will now solely use the actor name WIZARD SPIDER in association\nwith TrickBot and Ryuk. The GRIM SPIDER actor name has been deprecated.\n\nSimilar to Samas and BitPaymer, Ryuk is specifically used to target enterprise\n**environments. Code comparison between versions of Ryuk and Hermes ransomware**\nindicates that Ryuk was derived from the Hermes source code and has been under steady\n[development since its release. Hermes is commodity ransomware that has been observed](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\nfor sale on forums and used by multiple threat actors. However, Ryuk is only used by\nWIZARD SPIDER and, unlike Hermes, Ryuk has only been used to target enterprise\n\n\n-----\n\nenvironments. Since Ryuk s appearance in August, the threat actors operating it have netted\n**over 705.80 BTC across 52 transactions for a total current value of $3,701,893.98 USD.**\n\n**Want the latest insights on the cyber threat landscape?**\n\n[Download the 2021 Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/)\n\n## 1. Ryuk Ransom Notes\n\nThe Ryuk ransom note is written to a file named `RyukReadMe.txt . A number of different`\nransom note templates have been observed. The body of the template is static with the\nexception of the email address and the Bitcoin (BTC) wallet address, which may change.\nThe email addresses usually contain one address at protonmail.com and another address at\ntutanota.com. The email names typically are esoteric actors and directors, but Instagram\nmodels have also been observed. Interestingly, the ransom note in Figure 3 is remarkably\nsimilar to the BitPaymer ransom notes. As of this writing, it remains unclear if WIZARD\nSPIDER is copying the TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) and ransom notes of\nBitPaymer, or whether the groups may share information with each other.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Ryuk Ransom Note Bearing Strong Resemblance to BitPaymer\n\nThe ransom email used by Ryuk appears to be unique for each compiled executable. Our\nUsing [threat intelligence, our team has observed several different email addresses, but the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/)\nsame BTC addresses across multiple Ryuk executables. On Nov. 29, 2018, WIZARD\nSPIDER changed how they communicated with their victims. As seen in the previous\nransom note version, WIZARD SPIDER included their BTC address and email addresses.\nHowever, recent variants of Ryuk no longer contain the BTC address — only the email\naddresses. The ransom note states that the victim will receive the BTC address as a reply\nfrom WIZARD SPIDER. The new ransom note can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Ryuk Ransom With BTC Address Removed\n\nEarly Ryuk binaries with the removal of the BTC address contained a PDB path of\n```\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2015\\Projects\\ConsoleApplication54new crypted try to\nclean\\x64\\Release\\ConsoleApplication54.pdb . This PDB path started appearing on\n\n```\nNov. 29, 2018. The removal of the BTC addresses occurred a day after the U.S. Department\nof Justice unsealed indictments for two individuals involved in facilitating cashouts from\n_Samas Bitcoin addresses._\n\n### Ransom Payments\n\nBased on observed transactions to known Ryuk BTC addresses, the ransom demand varies\nsignificantly. This suggests that WIZARD SPIDER (like INDRIK SPIDER with BitPaymer)\ncalculates the ransom amount based on the size and value of the victim organization. To\ndate, the lowest observed ransom was for 1.7 BTC and the highest was for 99 BTC. With 52\n\n\n-----\n\nknown transactions spread across 37 BTC addresses (as of this writing), WIZARD SPIDER\nhas made 705.80 BTC, which has a current value of $3.7 million (USD). With the recent\ndecline in BTC to USD value, it is likely GRIM SPIDER has netted more. The tables in the\nAppendix include a set of known Ryuk BTC addresses extracted from Ryuk binaries, which\nare believed to be only a subset of the Ryuk BTC addresses.\n\n## 2. How Ryuk Ransomware is Distributed\n\n[CrowdStrike® has conducted multiple incident response (IR) engagements responding to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/incident-response-ir-plan/)\nRyuk infections in which TrickBot was also identified on hosts in the victim environment.\n[CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence™® believes that the initial compromise is performed through](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\nTrickBot, which is typically distributed either via spam email or, through the use of the Emotet\n[(developed and operated by MUMMY SPIDER) geo-based download function. Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-february-mummy-spider/)\nIntelligence has been monitoring the geo-based download activity from Emotet and, during\n2018, MUMMY SPIDER has been an avid supporter of WIZARD SPIDER, predominantly\ndistributing TrickBot to Emotet victims in the U.K., the U.S., and Canada.\n\nSome of TrickBot’s modules (such as `pwgrab ) could aid in recovering the credentials`\nneeded to compromise environments — the SOCKS module in particular has been observed\n[tunneling PowerShell Empire traffic to perform reconnaissance and lateral movement.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/lateral-movement/)\nThrough CrowdStrike IR engagements, WIZARD SPIDER has been observed performing the\nfollowing events on the victim’s network, with the end goal of pushing out the Ryuk binary:\n\nAn obfuscated PowerShell script is executed and connects to a remote IP address.\nA reverse shell is downloaded and executed on the compromised host.\nPowerShell anti-logging scripts are executed on the host.\nReconnaissance of the network is conducted using standard Windows command line\ntools along with external uploaded tools.\nLateral movement throughout the network is enabled using Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP).\nService User Accounts are created.\nPowerShell Empire is downloaded and installed as a service.\nLateral movement is continued until privileges are recovered to obtain access to a\ndomain controller.\nPSEXEC is used to push out the Ryuk binary to individual hosts.\nBatch scripts are executed to terminate processes/services and remove backups,\nfollowed by the Ryuk binary.\n\n## 3. From Hermes to Ryuk: Similarities & Differences\n\n**Hermes ransomware, the predecessor to Ryuk, was first distributed in February 2017.**\nOnly one month after its release, a decryptor was written for Hermes, followed by the release\nof version 2.0 in April 2017, which fixed vulnerabilities in its cryptographic implementation.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince this release, the only way for a victim to recover files is with the private encryption key,\nwhich is obtained by paying the ransom. In late August 2017, Hermes version 2.1 was\nreleased.\n\n[Hermes was originally sold on forums for $300 USD. When purchased, the buyer received a](https://twitter.com/Damian1338B/status/1028940508117258240)\nbuild that supported two email addresses, a decryptor and a unique RSA key pair. If the\npurchaser desired more email addresses, they were required to purchase another build for\nan additional $50. The seller of Hermes ransomware appears to have stopped or limited\nadvertising on forums in 2017.\n\nEarly versions of Hermes were reportedly installed via internet-accessible RDP servers\nprotected by weak credentials. In October 2017, Hermes was deployed as a destructive\ndistraction for a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)\ncompromise at the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) in Taiwan. Hermes’ role in the\nSWIFT attack is described in more detail in the Attribution section at the end of this blog. In\nMarch 2018, Hermes was observed targeting users in South Korea via the GreenFlash\nSundown exploit kit.\n\n**In mid-August 2018, a modified version of Hermes, dubbed Ryuk, started appearing in**\n**a public malware repository. Ryuk was tailored to target enterprise environments and**\nsome of the modifications include removing anti-analysis checks. These checks include\n[querying the Process Environment Block (PEB) to see if the field is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Environment_Block) `BeingDebugged, or`\nquerying the PEB to see if the field `NtGlobalFlag has been set; checking to see if the host`\nis running VirtualBox by calling the instruction CPUID; and ensuring that the host language is\nnot Russian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian. From a process and file perspective, Hermes and\n**Ryuk target files in a similar fashion. The core differences are Ryuk’s logic that handles**\nfile access, and the use of a second, embedded public RSA key.\n\nThe following are characteristics that have not changed:\n\nEncrypts files using RSA-2048 and AES-256\nStores keys in the executable using the proprietary Microsoft SIMPLEBLOB format\nEncrypts mounted devices and remote hosts\nUses a file marker of `HERMES to mark or check if a file has been encrypted`\n\nAnother notable difference between Hermes and Ryuk is how the encryption keys are\ncreated. Hermes starts the encryption initialization by first generating an RSA public and\nprivate key pair — referred to as a “victim key.” An AES-256 key is generated and the\nvictim’s RSA private key is encrypted in AES-CBC mode. The attacker-controlled public RSA\nkey is used to encrypt the AES key (previously used to encrypt the victim’s RSA private key).\nThen, for each file encrypted, an AES key is generated, which is used to encrypt the file.\nFinally, the AES key for each file is encrypted with the victim’s RSA public key, then stored at\nthe end of the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nRyuk contains the same logic, but no longer generates the victim-specific RSA key pair.\nInstead, Ryuk has two public RSA keys embedded in the executable, and what was\npreviously the victim’s RSA private key is encrypted and embedded in the executable.\nBecause Ryuk does not generate a victim-specific RSA key pair, all hosts can be decrypted\nwith the same decryption key. This might appear to be a design flaw but is not, since Ryuk\nhas a unique key for each executable.\n\nIf a single executable is used for a single victim environment, then there are no\nrepercussions if the private keys are leaked because it will only decrypt the damage from a\nsingle Ryuk executable. Thus, it is highly likely that Ryuk pre-generates the RSA key pairs\nfor each victim. This is arguably more secure, since the victim’s system will never have\naccess to the unencrypted RSA key pair parameters without paying the ransom. This\n[approach is similar to INDRIK SPIDER’s BitPaymer ransomware, which generates a victim-](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/)\nspecific sample with a hard-coded public key.\n\n## 4. Ryuk Functionality: A Technical Analysis\n\nThere are two types of Ryuk binaries: a dropper (which is not commonly observed) and the\nRyuk executable payload. Recovery of Ryuk droppers are rare, due to the Ryuk executable\npayload deleting the dropper when executed. Upon execution, the dropper constructs an\ninstallation folder path. The folder path is created by calling `GetWindowsDirectoryW and`\nthen inserting a null byte at the fourth character of the path. This is used to create a string\nthat contains the drive letter path. If the host operating system is Windows XP or earlier, the\nstring `Documents and Settings\\Default User\\ is appended to the drive letter path. If`\nthe host is Windows Vista or newer, the string `users\\Public\\ is appended to the drive`\nletter path. For Windows XP, an example folder path would be `C:\\Documents and`\n```\nSettings\\Default User\\, and for Window Vista or higher, the path would be\n\n```\n```\nC:\\Users\\Public.\n\n```\n\nA random executable file name is then constructed. It is created by calling `_srand with a`\nseed value returned from calling `GetTickCount, then` `_rand is continuously called until`\nfive alphabetic characters are concatenated together. The extension `.exe is then`\nappended. The dropper checks whether the host is 32-bit or 64-bit by calling\n```\nIsWow64Process and writes one of two embedded payload executables corresponding to\n\n```\nthe host’s architecture. The newly written executable is then run by calling `ShellExecuteW .`\nThe Ryuk payload executable written by the dropper is the Ryuk component that contains\nthe core logic for encrypting files on the host.\n\nRyuk is under constant development. In recent months, Ryuk binaries have continued to\ndeviate further and further from the original Hermes source code, with the threat actors\nadding and removing functionality often. In November 2018, Falcon Intelligence identified\nnew functionality added to Ryuk that included an anti-analysis infinite loop, a ping-like\n\n\n-----\n\nrequest to an IP address once the encryption process was completed, and the addition of an\nappended file extension for encrypted files. Of these three new features, only the file\nextension is still present in an executable compiled on Dec. 20, 2018.\n\n### File Encryption\n\n**Compared to other** **[families of ransomware, Ryuk has very few safeguards to ensure](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/what-is-ransomware/)**\n**stability of the host by not encrypting system files. For example, many ransomware**\n**families contain extensive lists of file extensions or folder names that should not be**\n**encrypted (whitelisted), but Ryuk only whitelists three extensions: It will not encrypt**\n**files with the extensions** `exe, dll, or` `hrmlog . The last extension appears to be a`\n**debug log filename created by the original Hermes developer. It should be noted that**\n**absent from this list is** `sys (system drivers),` `ocx (OLE control extension) and other`\n**executable file types. Encrypting these files could make the host unstable. Early**\n**versions of Ryuk included the whitelisting of** `ini and` `lnk files, but these have been`\n**removed in recent builds. The following folder names are also whitelisted and not**\n**encrypted.**\n\nChrome\nMozilla\nRecycle.bin\nWindows\nMicrosoft\nAhnLab\n\nThis is only a small subset of folder names that should be whitelisted in order to ensure\nstability on the host. While doing dynamic analysis, it was not uncommon to observe Ryuk\nattempting to encrypt files related to the Windows Bootloader ( C:\\Boot ) or other critical\nfiles and folders. Due to the absence of proper whitelisting, an infected machine can become\nunstable over time and unbootable if restarted.\n\nAs mentioned in the Hermes to Ryuk section, Ryuk uses a combination of symmetric (AES)\nand asymmetric (RSA) encryption to encrypt files. Without the private key provided by\nWIZARD SPIDER, the files cannot be decrypted and are unrecoverable. A thread is created\nfor the encryption of each file and each file is encrypted with its own AES key. After the file\nhas been encrypted, a file extension of `.RYK is appended to the file. All directories will have`\na ransom note of ( RyukReadMe.txt ) written to the directory.\n\nRyuk attempts to encrypt all mounted drives and hosts that have Address Resolution\n_Protocol (ARP) entries (IP addresses) and it enumerates all mounted drives by calling_\n```\nGetLogicalDrives . For each mounted drive, Ryuk calls GetDriveTypeW to determine\n\n```\nthe drive’s type. If the drive type is not a CD-ROM, files on the drive are encrypted. To\n\n\n-----\n\nretrieve IP addresses that have ARP entries, Ryuk calls `GetIpNetTable . It iterates through`\nall entries and then tries to enumerate files and folders on the remote host and encrypt the\nfiles.\n\n### Persistence\n\nCurrent builds of Ryuk no longer contain persistence functionality. Previously, to remain\npersistent on the host, Ryuk created a registry entry under the Run key using Windows\n```\ncmd.exe shell. The following command line was used to write to the Registry Run Key\n\n```\nname `svchos to`\n```\n HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the\n\n```\nvalue being the path to the Ryuk executable.\n\n### Process Injection\n\nRyuk does not encrypt files from within its own process memory space, but injects into a\nremote process. Before injecting into a remote process, Ryuk attempts to adjust its token\nprivileges to have the `SeDebugPrivilege . It takes no action if the adjustment of the token`\nprivileges fails. Before injecting into a remote process, Ryuk also calls\n```\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot to enumerate all running processes. If a process is found that\n\n```\nis not named `csrss.exe, explorer.exe, lsaas.exe` `, or is running under` `NT`\n```\nAUTHORITY system account, Ryuk will inject itself into this single process. By ensuring that\n\n```\nthe process is not running under `NT AUTHORITY` `, the developers are assuming the`\nprocess is not running under another account and therefore can be written to. Ryuk uses a\ncombination of `VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory and` `CreateRemoteThread to`\ninject itself into the remote process.\n\n### Process/Service Termination and Anti-Recovery Commands\n\nUnlike other families of ransomware, Ryuk does not contain process/service termination and\nanti-recovery functionality embedded in the executable. In the past, Ryuk did contain these\ncapabilities, but they have been removed and are contained within two batch files.\n\nThe batch file `kill.bat` contains commands for stopping services, disabling services and\nkilling processes. The processes and services are stopped to ensure no open handles exist\nfor files that will be encrypted. The following figure is a subset of each command.\n```\nnet stop avpsus /y\nnet stop McAfeeDLPAgentService /y\nnet stop mfewc /y\nnet stop BMR Boot Service /y\nnet stop NetBackup BMR MTFTP Service /y\n…\nsc config SQLTELEMETRY start= disabled\nsc config SQLTELEMETRY$ECWDB2 start= disabled\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nsc config SQLWriter start= disabled\nsc config SstpSvc start= disabled\n…\ntaskkill /IM mspub.exe /F\ntaskkill /IM mydesktopqos.exe /F\ntaskkill /IM mydesktopservice.exe /F\n\n```\nFigure 1. Process/Services Termination `kill.bat Commands`\n\nCrowdStrike has observed another batch file, named `windows.bat, which makes file`\nrecovery more difficult on the victim’s machine. It should be noted that file names can be\narbitrarily changed by the threat actors. The contents of the batch file are shown below in\nFigure 2.\n```\nvssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c: /maxsize=unbounded\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=d: /on=d: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=d: /on=d: /maxsize=unbounded\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=e: /on=e: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=e: /on=e: /maxsize=unbounded\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=f: /on=f: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=f: /on=f: /maxsize=unbounded\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=g: /on=g: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=g: /on=g: /maxsize=unbounded\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=h: /on=h: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=h: /on=h: /maxsize=unbounded\nvssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet\ndel /s /f /q c:\\*.VHD c:\\*.bac c:\\*.bak c:\\*.wbcat c:\\*.bkf c:\\Backup*.*\nc:\\backup*.* c:\\*.set c:\\*.win c:\\*.dsk\ndel /s /f /q d:\\*.VHD d:\\*.bac d:\\*.bak d:\\*.wbcat d:\\*.bkf d:\\Backup*.*\nd:\\backup*.* d:\\*.set d:\\*.win d:\\*.dsk\ndel /s /f /q e:\\*.VHD e:\\*.bac e:\\*.bak e:\\*.wbcat e:\\*.bkf e:\\Backup*.*\ne:\\backup*.* e:\\*.set e:\\*.win e:\\*.dsk\ndel /s /f /q f:\\*.VHD f:\\*.bac f:\\*.bak f:\\*.wbcat f:\\*.bkf f:\\Backup*.*\nf:\\backup*.* f:\\*.set f:\\*.win f:\\*.dsk\ndel /s /f /q g:\\*.VHD g:\\*.bac g:\\*.bak g:\\*.wbcat g:\\*.bkf g:\\Backup*.*\ng:\\backup*.* g:\\*.set g:\\*.win g:\\*.dsk\ndel /s /f /q h:\\*.VHD h:\\*.bac h:\\*.bak h:\\*.wbcat h:\\*.bkf h:\\Backup*.*\nh:\\backup*.* h:\\*.set h:\\*.win h:\\*.dsk\ndel %0\n\n```\nFigure 2. Anti-Recovery `window.bat Commands`\n\nThese anti-forensic recovery commands are quite interesting and appear to make use of an\nundocumented feature of the `vssadmin resize command. While the first command in`\nFigure 2 above, `vssadmin` `Delete Shadows /all /quiet, is commonly used by`\n\n\n-----\n\nransomware, the command option `vssadmin` `resize shadowstorage is rarely used. In`\nsituations where shadow copies were not created by `vssadmin, but by third-party`\napplications (such as backup software), `vssadmin can display an error and not delete the`\nbackups. One such error states: “Snapshots were found, but they were outside of your\nallowed context. Try removing them with the backup application which created them.”\nThe `vssadmin resize shadowstorage command is a “hack” that relies on` `vssadmin to`\ndelete storage when the shadow copies are resized. It forces the shadow copies to be\ndeleted regardless of their context. The command works by resizing the default shadow\nvolume size from 10 percent to 401 MB (the minimum size is 300 MB). Then the shadow\nstorage is set to unbounded, which allows it to use all available disk space. The shadow\ncopies are then deleted by calling the command `vssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet`\na second time.\n\nThe final set of commands deletes files based on their extension or folder locations. The\ncommand arguments are for `del delete files in all sub-directories ( /s ) in quiet mode`\n( /q) without asking the user for confirmation and to force (/f) the deletion of a file. The file\nextensions are for Virtual Hard Disk ( .VHD ), Avantrix Backup Plus files ( .bac ), backup\ncopy ( .bak ), Windows Backup Catalog File ( .wbcat ), Windows Backup Utility File\n( .bfk ), setting files ( .set ), Windows Backup File ( .win ), Disk Images ( .dsk ) and all\nfolders that start with Backup. Note that since the del command does not securely delete a\nfile (i.e., overwrite a file before deletion), some level of file recovery may be possible using\nforensic tools. The last command of `del %0 deletes the executing` `.bat file.`\n\nThe anti-recovery commands used by Ryuk are more extensive than most ransomware\nfamilies. These commands have not been observed being used by other ransomware\nfamilies yet. This indicates that the threat actors have a thorough understanding of enterprise\nbackup software.\n\n## 5. Attribution\n\n### North Korea\n\nOpen-source reporting has claimed that the Hermes ransomware was developed by the\n[North Korean group STARDUST CHOLLIMA (activities of which have been public reported](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-april-stardust-chollima/)\nas part of the “Lazarus Group”), because Hermes was executed on a host during the SWIFT\ncompromise of FEIB in October 2017. Table 1 contains samples that are possibly attributed\nto the compromise. The two executables related to Hermes are `bitsran.exe and`\n```\nRSW7B37.tmp .\n\n```\n\n**Name** **Functionality** **Compile**\n**Time**\n\n\n**Compiler Version** **Linker**\n**Version**\n\n\n-----\n\n**msmpeng.exe** TwoPence\nimplant\n\n**splwow32.exe** TwoPence\nimplant\n\n\nMon Feb\n20\n11:09:30\n2017\n\nMon Feb\n20\n11:09:30\n2017\n\n\nVisual\nC++ 10.0\n2010 SP1\n(build\n40219)\n\nVisual\nC++ 10.0\n2010 SP1\n(build\n40219)\n\nVisual\nC++ 10.0\n2010 SP1\n(build\n40219)\n\nVisual\nC++ 10.0\n2010\n(build\n30319)\n\n_Unknown_\n\n\n**FileTokenBroker.dll** Loader Thu Jan\n05\n01:11:33\n2017\n\n**bitsran.exe** Dropper/spreader Sun Oct\n1\n09:37:31\n2017\n\n\n**RSW7B37.tmp** Hermes\nransomware\n\n\nSun Oct\n1\n05:34:07\n2017\n\n\nVisual C++ 10.0 2010\nSP1 (build 40219) &\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008\nSP1 (build 30729)\n\nVisual C++ 10.0 2010\nSP1 (build 40219) &\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008\nSP1 (build 30729)\n\nVisual C++ 10.0 2010\nSP1 (build 40219) &\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008\nSP1 (build 30729)\n\nVisual C++ 10.0 2010\nSP1 (build 40219) &\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008\nSP1 (build 30729)\n\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008\nSP1 (build 30729)\n\n\nTable 1. File Information for Binaries Used in the FEIB SWIFT Compromise\n\nThe first executable, `bitsran.exe, is a dropper, and` `RSW7B37.tmp is the Hermes`\nransomware executable. The dropper’s goal is to propagate the Hermes executable within a\nnetwork by creating scheduled tasks over SMB sessions using hard-coded credentials. The\nHermes executable then encrypts files on the host. It is interesting to note that the compiler\nand linker for Hermes is different from the other executables. All of the executables except\nfor Hermes were compiled with Visual Studio 10, with a linker of Visual Studio 10. Hermes, in\ncontrast, was compiled with Visual Studio 9, with an unknown linker.\n\nIf the time stamps are correct, the two executables ( bitsran.exe and `RSW7B37.tmp )`\nwere compiled within four hours and three minutes of each other. Due to the short time frame\nof Hermes being bundled within an executable that was hard-coded with credentials of the\nFEIB network, Falcon Intelligence assesses that STARDUST CHOLLIMA likely had access\nto the Hermes source code, or a third party compiled and built a new version for them. Unlike\nother variants of Hermes, `RSW7B37.tmp does not append the exported and encrypted AES`\nkey to the end of the file. Figure 5 is a file encrypted by Hermes with the exported AES key\nappended to the end of the file as a footer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Example Hermes Footer with Encrypted AES Key\n\nFigure 6 is the end of a file encrypted by the Hermes variant `RSW7B37.tmp used in the`\nSWIFT attack. The footer only contains the marker `HERMES but not the exported AES key.`\n\nFigure 6. Example Hermes Footer in FEIB SWIFT Attack with Encrypted AES Key Missing\n\nWithout the encrypted AES key appended to the encrypted files, even if the private key used\nfor encryption was recovered, the files could not be decrypted. Therefore, the Hermes\nexecutable used in the FEIB SWIFT attack appears never to have been used to ransom the\nmachine, but rather to destroy the victim’s data.\n\n### Criminal Actors Operating from Russia\n\nFalcon Intelligence has medium-high confidence that the WIZARD SPIDER threat actors are\noperating out of Russia. Hermes was originally advertised on `exploit[.]in . This Russian-`\nspeaking forum is a well-known marketplace for selling malware and related services to\n\n\n-----\n\ncriminal threat actors. If Hermes was indeed related to STARDUST CHOLLIMA, it would\nimply that nation-state threat actors are selling their services on Russian-speaking forums,\nwhich is unlikely.\n\nThe Russian threat actor attribution theory is also supported by an early advertisement for\nHermes, which stated that their “software did not work and will on work on RU, UA, BY” [sic].\nThis refers to functionality implemented in Hermes to check the host to ensure that it is not\nrunning on a Russian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian system. To check the host language, it\nqueries the registry key\n```\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Nls\\Language\\ and the\n\n```\nvalue `InstallLanguage . If the machine has the value 0419 (Russian), 0422 (Ukrainian) or`\n0423 (Belarusian), it call `ExitProcess to stop executing. This functionality is commonly`\nincluded by malware developers and sellers who are operating in Russia to reduce their risk\nof attracting local law enforcement’s attention and criminal prosecution.\n\nWhile supporting an incident response investigation involving Ryuk, Falcon Intelligence\nnoticed files related to the investigation being uploaded to a file-scanning website from an IP\naddress in Moscow, Russia. The file in question was a variant of `kill.bat that contained`\ncommands previously only observed executed by Ryuk calling `ShellExecute . The files`\ncould have been uploaded by a victim in Russia, but the time frame between the functionality\nbeing removed from Ryuk binaries and included in `kill.bat was very short. The most`\nlikely scenario is that threat actors were testing whether `kill.bat would be detected by`\nantivirus engines.\n\nAlso, during forensic investigation of a network compromised by WIZARD SPIDER,\nCrowdStrike Services recovered artifacts with filenames in Russian. One file was named\n```\n!!! files dlya raboty !!!.rar, which translates to “files for work.” Based on these\n\n```\nfactors, there is considerably more evidence supporting the hypothesis that the WIZARD\nSPIDER threat actors are Russian speakers and not North Korean.\n\n## How CrowdStrike Can Prevent Ryuk\n\nThe Falcon platform has the ability to detect and prevent Ryuk by taking advantage of the\nbehavioral patterns indicated by the ransomware. By turning on suspicious process blocking,\nFalcon ensures that Ryuk is killed in the very early stages of execution. In addition,\nCrowdStrike’s machine learning (ML) algorithm provides additional coverage against this\nmalware family, as illustrated below.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Known Ryuk BTC Wallet Addresses and Payments\n\n**BTC Address** **Total**\n**Received**\n\n\n**No**\n**Received**\n\n\n**Total Value**\n**(USD)**\n\n\n12vsQry1XrPjPCaH8gWzDJeYT7dhTmpcjL 55.00 3 $221,685.46\n\n1Kx9TT76PHwk8sw7Ur6PsMWyEtaogX7wWY 182.99 10 $734,601.91\n\n1FtQnqvjxEK5GJD9PthHM4MtdmkAeTeoRt 48.250 4 $188,974.93\n\n14aJo5L9PTZhv8XX6qRPncbTXecb8Qohqb 25.00 2 $113,342.70\n\n1E4fQqzCvS8wgqy5T7n1DW8JMNMaUbeFAS 0.001 1 $6.47\n\n1GXgngwDMSJZ1Vahmf6iexKVePPXsxGS6H 30.00 3 $132,654.91\n\n1Cyh35KqhhDewmXy63yp9ZMqBnAWe4oJRr 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n15LsUgfnuGc1PsHJPcfLQJEnHm2FnGAgYC 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1CbP3cgi1Bcjuz6g2Fwvk4tVhqohqAVpDQ 13.00 2 $82,917.49\n\n1Jq3WwsaPA7LXwRNYsfySsd8aojdmkFnW 35.00 1 $221,979.83\n\n129L4gRSYgVJTRCgbPDtvYPabnk2QnY9sq 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1ET85GTps8eFbgF1MvVhFVZQeNp2a6LeGw 3.325 1 $12,661.74\n\n\n-----\n\n1FRNVupsCyTjUvF36GxHZrvLaPtY6hgkTm 38.99 3 $246,893.95\n\n1CW4kTqeoedinSmZiPYH7kvn4qP3mDJQVa 24.077 2 $152,727.13\n\n13rTF3AYsf8xEdafUMT5W1E5Ab2aqPhkPi 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n17zTcgKhF8XkWvkD4Y1N8634Qw37KwYkZT 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n14dpmsn9rmdcS4dKD4GeqY2dYY6pwu4nVV 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n17v2cu8RDXhAxufQ1YKiauBq6GGAZzfnFw 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1KUbXkjDZL6HC3Er34HwJiQUAE9H81Wcsr 10.00 1 $63,358.27\n\n12UbZzhJrdDvdyv9NdCox1Zj1FAQ5onwx3 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1NMgARKzfaDExDSEsNijeT3QWbvTF7FXxS 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n19AE1YN6Jo8ognKdJQ3xeQQL1mSZyX16op 25.00 1 $164,774.21\n\n1L9fYHJJxeLMD2yyhh1cMFU2EWF5ihgAmJ 40.035 4 $259,478.16\n\n18eu6KrFgzv8yTMVvKJkRM3YBAyHLonk5G 30.00 1 $198,651.35\n\n1C8n86EEttnDjNKM9Tjm7QNVgwGBncQhDs 30.0082 2 $194,113.76\n\n12N7W9ycLhuck9Q2wT8E6BaN6XzZ4DMLau 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n162DVnddxsbXeVgdCy66RxEPADPETBGVBR 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1ChnbV4Rt7nsb5acw5YfYyvBFDj1RXcVQu 28.00 2 $175,177.98\n\n1K6MBjz79QqfLBN7XBnwxCJb8DYUmmDWAt 1.7 2 $12,455.95\n\n1EoyVz2tbGXWL1sLZuCnSX72eR7Ju6qohH 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1NQ42zc51stA4WAVkUK8uqFAjo1DbWv4Kz 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n15FC73BdkpDMUWmxo7e7gtLRtM8gQgXyb4 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n14hVKm7Ft2rxDBFTNkkRC3kGstMGp2A4hk 10.00 2 $64,990.62\n\n1CN2iQbBikFK9jM34Nb3WLx5DCenQLnbXp 15.00 1 $92,934.80\n\n1LKULheYnNtJXgQNWMo24MeLrBBCouECH7 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n15RLWdVnY5n1n7mTvU1zjg67wt86dhYqNj 50.41 3 $326,477.83\n\n1KURvApbe1yC7qYxkkkvtdZ7hrNjdp18sQ 0.00 0 $0.00\n\n1NuMXQMUxCngJ7MNQ276KdaXQgGjpjFPhK 10 1 $41,034.54\n\n\n-----\n\n### Indicators\n\nThe following table contains the hashes of recently compiled Ryuk payloads:\n\n**SHA256** **Build**\n**Time**\n**(UTC)**\n\n795db7bdad1befdd3ad942be79715f6b0c5083d859901b81657b590c9628790f 2018-1227\n01:10:12\n\n501e925e5de6c824b5eeccb3ccc5111cf6e312258c0877634935df06b9d0f8b9 2018-1221\n02:33:34\n\nfe909d18cf0fde089594689f9a69fbc6d57b69291a09f3b9df1e9b1fb724222b 2018-1221\n00:15:31\n\nThe following table contains hashes of Hermes executables that were previously analyzed:\n\n**SHA256** **Build**\n**Time**\n**(UTC)**\n\nac648d11f695cf98993fa519803fa26cd43ec32a7a8713bfa34eb618659aff77 2018-0720\n13:35:25\n\n5e2c9ec5a108af92f177cabe23451d20e592ae54bb84265d1f972fcbd4f6a409 2018-0723\n03:47:58\n\n78c6042067216a5d47f4a338dd951848b122bbcbcd3e61290b2f709543448d90 2018-071522:37:30\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_For more information on how to incorporate intelligence on dangerous threat actors into_\n_your security strategy, please visit the_ _[Falcon Intelligence product page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n\n_Read Stories from the front lines of incident response and get insights that can help_\n_inform your security strategy for 2019 in the CrowdStrike Services Cyber Intrusion_\n_Casebook 2018._\n_[Test Falcon Prevent™ next-gen antivirus for yourself with a free 15-day trial today.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n\n\n-----",
