We presented both details on their plugins and significant findings about some of their**\n\n**targets and victims. In this post, let’s examine several additional plugins more closely, targeting details**\n\n**around BE2 Siemens exploitation, and some of their unusual coding failures.**\n\n**We previously introduced an unknown set of plugins and functionality for the linux platform, six in total.**\n\n**For the windows platform, we collected 17 plugins. The last post noted the difficulty in collecting on this**\n\n**group. We finish descriptions for our set in this post.**\n\n**bs**\n\n**cert**\n\n**dstr**\n\n**fs**\n\n**grc**\n\n**jn**\n\n\n-----\n\n**prx**\n\n**ps**\n\n**rd**\n\n**scan**\n\n**sn**\n\n**ss**\n\n**tv**\n\n**upd**\n\n**usb**\n\n**vsnet**\n\n**We also collected plugins for the MIPS/ARM architectures, as noted in the previous BE2 post.**\n\n**weap**\n\n**ps**\n\n**nm**\n\n**snif**\n\n**hook**\n\n**uper**\n\n**Let’s first examine some of the newest and most surprising Windows plugins. It’s interesting that all of**\n\n**these plugins use a custom “FindByHash” function to evade detection schemes and to slow analysis…**\n\n**Name** **dstr.dll**\n\n**MD5** **8a0a9166cd1bc665d965575d32dfa972**\n\n**Type** **Win32 DLL**\n\n**Size** **26,474 bytes**\n\n**CompiledOn** **2014.06.17 08:42:43**\n\n**The most troubling plugin in the list is the “dstr” plugin. It is a Windows-only plugin. It was used to**\n\n**overwrite data by the BE2 actor, destroying data stored on hard drives by overwriting file contents.**\n\n**While its use may be intended to cover their tracks, it is heavy handed to use this type of tool to cover**\n\n**one’s tracks in a network. Most likely it is a tool of sabotage, much like the Destover wiper seen on**\n\n**Sony Pictures Entertainment’s networks. However, it’s interesting that the BE2 developers created**\n\n**wiper code different from the Destover and Shamoon wiper malware we saw in the Saudi Aramco and**\n\n**SPE attacks. Instead of re-using the commercial EldoS RawDisk drivers in their malware, the BE2**\n\n**developers wrote their own low-level disk and file destruction routines. It’s also a much more chilling**\n\n**deployment of wipers** **instead of a poorly defended media studio it was delivered to ICS**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In order to overwrite stored data on all Windows versions, the dstr plugin supports both user-mode and**\n\n**kernel-mode wiper functionality, which is somewhat surprising. The component maintains both an**\n\n**embedded win32 library and win64 driver modules for its kernel mode functionality. They are rc4**\n\n**encrypted.**\n\n**User-mode functionality**\n\n**The plugin identifies device id’s for the system’s HDD and creates a handle to the system’s physical**\n\n**drive, with “GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE” access. Several calls to DeviceIoControl collects**\n\n**data on the physical location of the volume, and the size and properties of this disk. It uses**\n\n**DeviceIoControl with the IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY control code in order to retrieve**\n\n**Bytes Per Sector value. dstr then wipes out all open handles to the disk by dismounting it with the**\n\n**FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME control code.**\n\n**This routine prepares the system for overwrite and ensures no conflicts for plugin file I/O. Then it makes**\n\n**multiple WriteFile calls to write a zeroed out buffer to disk.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The dstr plugin maintains code for unlocking and deleting the BE2 driver from disk, furthering the**\n\n**group’s goal of keeping their traces hidden from researchers. And notice the FindByHash set of calls**\n\n**above, this sfc_os call disables Windows File Protection for a minute while an application can delete or**\n\n**modify the locked file. So this plugin and its call can proceed and delete the driver.**\n\n**The plugin looks over all the services in the %system32%\\drivers folder and checks the write**\n\n**permission. If access is provided, it unlocks the file, rewrites the embedded driver under the existing**\n\n**driver name and launches it.**\n\n**Drivers and kernel mode functionality**\n\n**Decrypted 32-bit driver**\n\n**Name** **driver.sys**\n\n**MD5** **c4426555b1f04ea7f2e71cf18b0e5b6c**\n\n**Type** **Win32 driver**\n\n**Size** **5,120 bytes**\n\n**CompiledOn** **2014.06.10 13:12:22 GMT**\n\n**Decrypted 64-bit driver**\n\n**Name** **driver.sys**\n\n**MD5** **2cde6f8423e5c01da27316a9d1fe8510**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Size** **9,136 bytes**\n\n**CompiledOn** **2014.06.10 13:12:04 GMT**\n\n**The 32-bit and 64-bit drivers are identical and compiled from the same source code. These small**\n\n**Windows drivers are supposed to support FAT32 and NTFS file systems, and contain two large code**\n\n**implementation mistakes. In spite of these flaws, it is clear that the author’s goal was to parse a file**\n\n**system and then write random data across files.**\n\n**These coding fails are unique to this dstr plugin, suggesting a development team effort behind the**\n\n**plugin set code.**\n\n**Fail #1: The authors reversed the routines for FAT32 and NTFS data wiping when checking the**\n\n**presence of the “FAT32” string in the first 1024-bytes of the system drive.**\n\n**Fail #2: In the FAT32 routine the Root Directory Sector Number is calculated and is dealt as the**\n\n**absolute offset inside the file rather than next multiplying this number by the bytes per sector**\n\n**In comparison, there is no such mistake in the NTFS routine and the calculation of the MFT offset is**\n\n**implemented properly:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**logic compared to FAT32 ‘straightforward’ wiping. The plugin accomplishes checks for FILE records**\n\n**and at first skips them. Then under certain conditions it rewrites non-FILE record sectors with random**\n\n**buffer which probably corresponds to some file contents and proceeds looping. Then it ends up**\n\n**rewriting the first sectors of MFT and MFT mirror.**\n\n**Name** **grc.dll**\n\n**MD5** **ee735c244a22b4308ea5d36afee026ab**\n\n**Type** **Win32 DLL**\n\n**Size** **15,873 bytes**\n\n**CompiledOn** **2013.09.25 07:19:31**\n\n**This plugin creates a backup communications channel to yet another legitimate service. Most likely this**\n\n**backup channel is used to cloak outbound communications on monitored networks. We have seen APT**\n\n**using everything from Twitter to Google Docs to hide communications in plain sight, and this time the**\n\n**abused service is Google Plus.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This plugin implements the standard Windows HTTP services to interact with Google Plus over https,**\n\n**seeking to find a png file.**\n\n**The plugin is provided with a specific Google Plus id to connect with, and uses the OLE stream**\n\n**Windows structured storage API along with the GDI+ bitmap functions to handle and parse this png file.**\n\n**This png file content is actually encrypted data containing the new BE configuration file just as it was**\n\n**obtained using ‘normal’ C&C communication. It is encrypted with RC4, just like the embedded dstr**\n\n**drivers. But unlike to the ‘typical’ RC4 BE decryption scheme that uses RC4 once, here it uses RC4**\n\n**three times: once with hardcoded key found in the grc binary, the second time using the key extracted**\n\n**from the previous decrypted result, and the third time using the ‘id’ machine’s identifier that is normally**\n\n**served as the encryption key during the C&C communication.**\n\n**Name** **usb.dll**\n\n**MD5** **0d4de21a2140f0ca3670e406c4a3b6a9**\n\n**Type** **Win32 DLL**\n\n**Size** **34,816 bytes**\n\n**CompiledOn** **2014.03.21 07:02:48**\n\n**The usb plugin collects all available information on connected USB drives, and writes out all of these**\n\n**details to a text file, packs it, provides to the main BlackEnergy code, which communicates to a c2.**\n\n**It uses multiple api calls to collect information on multiple types of connected usb storage devices. It**\n\n**enumerates all usb storage devices connected to the system and retrieves data from all, including**\n\n**SCSI mass storage devices. And, most interestingly, it may be the first implementation of BadUSB-**\n\n**related techniques in APT re-purposed COTS malware that we have seen in the wild.**\n\n**Th** **d** **i** **i d** **i** **di** **tl** **d** **d th** **t** **t** **f SCSI** **d** **Th** **fi** **t**\n\n\n-----\n\n**the failed call ( SendSCSICommand return false message).**\n\n**The second type of SCSI command remains mysterious. It uses undefined opcode 0xf0 and there is no**\n\n**direct evidence of its purpose as it is stated to be vendor specific. This mysterious opcode is**\n\n**referenced around the same time frame of the plugin development in BadUSB offensive research**\n\n**[http://algorithmics.bu.edu/twiki/bin/view/EC521/SectionA1/Group5FinalReport. Here, it is noticed in the](http://algorithmics.bu.edu/twiki/bin/view/EC521/SectionA1/Group5FinalReport)**\n\n**USB traffic generated by an SMI controller tool. To be specific, there are two calls with the opcode 0xf0**\n\n**in the code, each passed its own parameters. One of the parameters, 0x2A, is mentioned in the paper**\n\n**to return the string containing the firmware version, NAND flash ID, and controller part number. But this**\n\n**returned information is not logged anywhere.**\n\n**Also the code loops to retrieve detailed physical data about every attached storage device:**\n\n**number of cylinders**\n\n**media type (floppy, fixed hard drive, removable media, etc)**\n\n**number of tracks per cylinder**\n\n**sectors per track**\n\n**number of bytes per sector**\n\n**physical disk size in bytes**\n\n**Device Instance ID**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name** **bs.dll**\n\n**MD5** **4747376b00a5dd2a787ba4e926f901f4**\n\n**Type** **Win32 DLL**\n\n**Size** **210,432 bytes**\n\n**CompiledOn** **2014.07.29 00:40:53**\n\n**The bios plugin gathers low level host system information:**\n\n**BIOS**\n\n**motherboard**\n\n**processor**\n\n**OS**\n\n**It uses several techniques to gather this information:**\n\n**WMI**\n\n**CPUID**\n\n**win32 api**\n\n**As a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) client application, it initializes COM and connects**\n\n**to the \\\\root\\cimv2 namespace to use the IWbemServices pointer and make WMI requests. The code**\n\n**executes wql queries (“wql” is “sql for wmi”, a subset of sql) to gather victim host details, like the query**\n\n**“SELECT Description, Manufacturer, Name, ProcessorId FROM Win32_Processor”. Here are several**\n\n**queries from the BlackEnergy2 plugin code:**\n\n**SELECT Description, Manufacturer, Name, ProcessorId FROM Win32_Processor**\n\n**SELECT Product, Manufacturer, Version FROM Win32_BaseBoard**\n\n**SELECT Name, OSArchitecture, Version, BuildNumber FROM Win32_OperatingSystem**\n\n**SELECT SerialNumber, Description, Manufacturer, SMBIOSBIOSVersion FROM Win32_BIOS**\n\n**These wql calls provide the attacker with the data like the lines below:**\n\n**D** **i ti** **I t l64 F** **il 6 M d l 60 St** **i** **3**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710MQ CPU @ 2.50GHz**\n\n**ProcessorId=1FEAFBCF000116A9**\n\n**Product=7MPXM1**\n\n**Manufacturer=AsusTek**\n\n**Version=??**\n\n**Name=Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro**\n\n**OSArchitecture=64-bit**\n\n**Version=6.3.9600**\n\n**BuildNumber=9600**\n\n**SerialNumber=7DTLG45**\n\n**Description=A12**\n\n**Manufacturer=AsusTek**\n\n**SMBIOSBIOSVersion=A12**\n\n**This selectivity is fairly usual. And the plugin does not modify its own behavior based the collected**\n\n**values. What can we infer about the selection of only these values, as they are only being collected and**\n\n**sent back to the attackers? Here are some possibilities:**\n\n**the attackers want to evade sandbox and honeypot/decoy environments, and use this collected**\n\n**data to id the host system.**\n\n**the attackers have prior knowledge of the environment they are attempting to penetrate, down to**\n\n**the equipment make. Or, they have an idea of the types of hardware they would expect or want to**\n\n**see. In ICS and SCADA environments, these details could be very valuable for an attacker setting**\n\n**up shop. These details could aid in establishing persistence, evaluating true resource capacity and**\n\n**capabilities, tracking down the source of the equipment, or aiding further lateral movement**\n\n**the attackers know nothing about the network they are penetrating. They are collecting this**\n\n**information to better understand where this plugin really is running in the victim environment and**\n\n**planning their next moves**\n\n**When using standard win32 api, the application implements calls to retrieve information on system**\n\n**locales. Oddly, there is special handling for one nordic locale in this particular plugin, “Norwegian-**\n\n**Nynorsk”.**\n\n**The CPU data collection functionality first calls the Intel cpuid instruction directly. It also directly handles**\n\n**multi-cpu systems and each of their feature sets. This SMP support is hard coded into the plugin.**\n\n**Targeting details for BE2 actor events are interesting. When focusing on research sites and energy**\n\n**engineering facilities, the group remotely exploited Siemens’ Simatic WinCC systems. In these events,**\n\n**the attackers attempted to force the ccprojectmgr.exe process to download and execute a specific**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Target A:**\n\n**The first exploit attempt ksn recorded was March 2014. The attackers returned with a second failed**\n\n**attempt to exploit that same research system on April 2014, approximately 30 days, 2 hours later.**\n\n**Target B:**\n\n**The BE2 actor then attacked a new target system in May 2014 and failed, and returned with an exploit**\n\n**attempt on that same system in July 2014.**\n\n**So it looks like there may be a timing cycle to their visits, but the volumes here are too low to be**\n\n**significant.**\n\n**In all four of these attempts on two different targets, the attackers tried to download their payload from**\n\n**hxxp://94.185.85(dot)122/favicon.ico. The payload changed slightly from March 2014 to the very end of**\n\n**July 2014, presenting the following md5(s). All of these droppers are BE2 malware, modify an existing**\n\n**kernel driver service like “ACPIEC” and start it to load the BE2 kernel module. Note that the attackers**\n\n**planned on re-using the same c2 for the first target, but changed the callback c2 for the second target.**\n\n**None of these components are signed:**\n\n**fda6f18cf72e479570e8205b0103a0d3 → drops df84ff928709401c8ad44f322ec91392, driver, debug**\n\n**string:”xxxxxxxx.pdb”.
