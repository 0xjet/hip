This blog will explain the\ntechnical details and share information about how this new ransomware family is working. There are some variants of the Clop ransomware\nbut in this report, we will focus on the main version and highlight part of those variations. The main goal of Clop is to encrypt all files in an\nenterprise and request a payment to receive a decryptor to decrypt all the affected files. To achieve this, we observed some new techniques\nbeing used by the author that we have not seen before. Clearly over the last few months we have seen more innovative techniques appearing\nin ransomware.\n\n## Clop Overview\n\nThe Clop ransomware is usually packed to hide its inner workings. The sample we analyzed was also signed with the following certificate in\nthe first version (now revoked):\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 1. Packer signed to avoid av programs and mislead the user\n\nSigning a malicious binary, in this case ransomware, may trick security solutions to trust the binary and let it pass. Although this initial\ncertificate was revoked in a few days, another version appeared soon after with another certificate:\n\nFIGURE 2. New certificate in new version\n\n[This sample was discovered by MalwareHunterTeam (https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam) on the 26 February, 2019.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n\nWe discovered the following Clop ransomware samples which were signed with a certificate:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malware is prepared to avoid running under certain conditions, for example in the first version it requests to be installed as a service; if\nthat will not succeed, it will terminate itself.\n\nThe malware’s first action is to compare the keyboard of the victim computer using the function “GetKeyboardLayout” against the hardcoded\nvalues.\n\nThis function returns the user keyboard input layout at the moment the malware calls the function.\n\nThe malware checks that the layout is bigger than the value 0x0437 (Georgian), makes some calculations with the Russian language (0x0419)\nand with the Azerbaijan language (0x082C). This function will return 1 or 0, 1 if it belongs to Russia or another CIS country, or 0 in every other\ncase.\n\nFIGURE 3. Checking the keyboard layout\n\nIf the function returns 0, it will go to the normal flow of the malware, otherwise it will get the device context of the entire screen with the function\n“GetDC”. Another condition will come from the function “GetTextCharset” that returns the font used in the system if it does not have the value\n0xCC (RUSSIAN_CHARSET). If it is the charset used, the malware will delete itself from the disk and terminate itself with “TerminateProcess”\nbut if it is not this charset, it will continue in the normal flow This double check circumvents users with a multisystem language, i.e. they have\nthe Russian language installed but not active in the machine to avoid this type of malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nGU C ec t e te t c a set a d co pa e t uss a c a set\n\nThe code that is supposed to delete the ransomware from the disk contains an error. It will call directly to the prompt of the system without\nwaiting for the malware to finish. This means that the execution of the command will be correct but, as the malware is still running, it will not\ndelete it from the disk. This happens because the author did not use a “timeout” command.\n\nFIGURE 5. Deletion of the malware itself\n\nThe next action of the malware is to create a new thread that will start all processes. With the handle of this thread, it will wait for an infinite\namount of time to finish with the “WaitForSingleObject” function and later return to the winMain function and exit.\n\nThis thread’s first action is to create a file called “Favorite” in the same folder as the malware. Later, it will check the last error with\n“GetLastError” and, if the last error was 0, it will wait with the function “Sleep” for 5 seconds.\n\nLater the thread will make a dummy call to the function “EraseTape” with a handle of 0, perhaps to disturb the emulators because the handle is\nput at 0 in a hardcoded opcode, and later a call to the function “DefineDosDeviceA” with an invalid name that returns another error. These\noperations will make a loop for 666000 times.\n\nFIGURE 6. Loop to disturb the analysis\n\nThe next action is to search for some processes with these names:\n\nSBAMTray.exe (Vipre antivirus product)\nSBPIMSvc.exe (Sunbelt AntiMalware antivirus product)\nSBAMSvc.exe (GFI AntiMalware antivirus product)\nVipreAAPSvc.exe (Vipre antivirus product)\nWRSA.exe (WebRoot antivirus product)\n\nIf some of these processes are discovered, the malware will wait 5 seconds using “Sleep” and later another 5 seconds. After those “sleep”, the\nmalware will continue with their normal flow. If these processes are not detected, it will access to their own resources and extract it with the\nname “OFFNESTOP1”. That resource is encrypted but has inside a “.bat” file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 7. Access to the first resource crypted\n\nThe decryption is a simple XOR operation with bytes from this string:\n\n“Po39NHfwik237690t34nkjhgbClopfdewquitr362DSRdqpnmbvzjkhgFD231ed76tgfvFAHGVSDqhjwgdyucvsbCdigr1326dvsaghjvehjGJHGHVdbas”.\n\nThe next action is to write this batch file in the same folder where the malware stays with the function “CreateFileA”. The file created has the\nname “clearsystems-11-11.bat”. Later will launch it with “ShellExecuteA”, wait for 5 seconds to finish and delete the file with the function\n“DeleteFileA”.\n\nIt is clear that the authors are not experienced programmers because they are using a .bat file for the next actions:\n\nDelete the shadow volumes with vssadmin (“vssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet”).\nResize the shadow storage for all units starting from C to H units’ letters (hardcoded letters) to avoid the shadow volumes being made\nagain.\nUsing bcedit program to disable the recovery options in the boot of the machine and set to ignore any failure in the boot warning the user.\n\nAll these actions could have been performed in the malware code itself, without the need of an external file that can be detected and removed.\n\nFIGURE 8. The BAT file to disable the shadow volumes and more security\n\nThe next action is to create a mutex with the name hardcoded “Fany—Fany—6-6-6” and later make a call to the function\n“WaitForSingleObject” and check the result with 0. If the value is 0 it means that the mutex was created for this instance of the malware but if it\ngets another value, it means that the mutex was made from another instance or vaccine and, in this case, it will finish the execution of the\nmalware.\n\nAfter this, it will make 2 threads, one of them to search for processes and the another one to crypt files in the network shares that it has access\nto.\n\nThe first thread enumerates all processes of the system and creates the name of the process in upper case and calculates a hash with the\nname and compares it with a big list of hashes. This hash algorithm is a custom algorithm. It is typical in malware that tries to hide what\nprocesses they are looking for. If it finds one of them it will terminate it with “TerminateProcess” function after opening with the rights to make\nthis action with “OpenProcess” function.\n\nThe malware contains 61 hard-coded hashes of programs such as “STEAM.EXE”, database programs, office programs and others.\n\nBelow, the first 38 hashes with the associated process names. These 38 processes are the most usual processes to close as we have\nobserved with other ransomwares families such as GandCrab, Cerber, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis thread runs in an infinite loop with a wait using the function “Sleep” per iteration of 30 minutes.\n\nFIGURE 9. Thread to kill critical processes to unlock files\n\nThe second thread created has the task of enumerating all network shares and crypts files in them if the malware has access to them.\n\nFor executing this task, it uses the typical API functions of the module “MPR.DLL”:\n\n\n-----\n\netOpe u\nWNetEnumResourceW\nWNetCloseEnum\n\nThis thread starts creating a reserve of memory with “GlobalAlloc” function to keep the information of the “MPR” functions.\n\nFor each network share that the malware discovers, it will prepare to enumerate more shares and crypt files.\n\nFor each folder discovered, it will enter it and search for more subfolders and files. The first step is to check the name of the folder/file found\nagainst a hardcoded list of hashes with the same algorithm used to detect the processes to close.\n\nBelow are the results of 12 of the 27 hashes with the correct names:\n\nIf it passes, it will check that the file is not a folder, and in this case compare the name with a list of hardcoded names and extensions that are\nin plain text rather than in hash format:\n\nClopReadMe.txt\nntldr\nNTDLR\nboot.ini\nBOOT.INI\nntuser.ini\nNTUSER.INI\nAUTOEXEC.BAT\nautoexec.bat\n.Clop\nNTDETECT.COM\nntdetect.com\n.dll\n.DLL\n.exe\n.EXE\n.sys\n.SYS\n.ocx\n.OCX\n.LNK\n.lnk\ndesktop.ini\nautorun.inf\nntuser.dat\niconcache.db\nbootsect.bak\nntuser.dat.log\nthumbs.db\nDESKTOP.INI\nAUTORUN.INF\nNTUSER.DAT\nICONCACHE.DB\nBOOTSECT.BAK\nNTUSER.DATA.LOG\n\n\n-----\n\nU S\n\nThis check is done with a custom function that checks character per character against all the list. It is the reason for having the same names in\nboth upper and lower case, instead of using the function “lstrcmpiA,” for example, to avoid some hook in this function preventing the file from\nbeing affected. The check of the extension at the same time is to make the process of crypto quicker. Of course, the malware checks that the\nfile does not have the name of the ransom note and the extension that it will put in the crypted file. Those blacklisted extensions will help the\nsystem avoid crashing during the encryption compared with other ransomware families.\n\nFIGURE 10. Check of file names and extensions\n\nThis behavior is normal in ransomware but the previous check against hardcoded hashes based on the file/folder name is weird because later,\nas we can see in the above picture, the next check is against plain text strings.\n\nIf it passes this check, the malware will make a new thread with a struct prepared with a hardcoded key block, the name of the file, and the\npath where the file exists. In this thread the first action is to remove the error mode with “SetErrorMode” to 1 to avoid an error dialog being\nshown to the user if it crashes. Later, it will prepare the path to the file from the struct passed as argument to the thread and change the\nattributes of the file to ARCHIVE with the function “SetFileAttributesW”, however the malware does not check if it can make this action with\nsuccess or not.\n\nLater it will generate a random AES key and crypt each byte of the file with this key, next it will put the mark “Clop^_” at the end of the file, after\nthe mark it will put the key used to crypt the file ciphered with the master RSA key that has hardcoded the malware to protect it against third\nparty free decryptors.\n\nThe malware can use 2 different public RSA keys: one exported using the crypto api in a public blob or using the embedded in base64 in the\nmalware. The malware will only use the second one if it cannot create the crypto context or has some problem with the crypto api functions.\n\nThe malware does not have support for Windows XP in its use with the crypto functions, because the CSP used in Windows XP has another\nname, but if run in another operating system starting with Windows Vista, it can change the name in the debugger to acquire the context later\nand will generate a RSA public blob.\n\nAnother difference with other ransomware families is that Clop will only cipher the disk that is a physical attached/embedded disk (type 3,\nFIXED or removable (type 2)). The malware ignores the REMOTE type (4)).\n\nAnyways, the shares can be affected using the “MPR.DLL” functions without any problem.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 11. Filemark in the crypted file and key used ciphered\n\nAfter encrypting, the file will try to open in the same folder the ransom note and, if it exists, it will continue without overwriting it to save time,\nbut if the ransom note does not exist it will access one resource in the malware called “OFFNESTOP”. This resource is crypted with the same\nXOR operation as the first resource: the .bat file, after decrypting, will write the ransom note in the folder of the file.\n\nFIGURE 12. Creation of the ransom note from a crypted resource\n\nHere is a sample of the ransom note of the first version of this malware:\n\n\n-----\n\nGU 3 a p e o a so ote o t e st e s o o t e a a e\n\nAfter this, Clop will continue with the next file with the same process however, the check of the name based with the hash is avoided now.\n\n## Second Version of the Malware\n\nThe second version found by the end of February has some changes if it is compared with the first one. The hash of this version is:\n“ed7db8c2256b2d5f36b3d9c349a6ed0b”.\n\nThe first change is some changes in the strings in plain text of the code to make the execution in the “EraseTape” call and “FindAtomW” call\nmore slowly. Now the names are for the tape: “” and the atom “”.\n\nThe second change is the name of the resources crypted in the binary, the first resource that is a second batch file to delete the shadow\nvolumes and remove the protections in the boot of the machine as the previous one has another name: “RC_HTML1”.\n\nFIGURE 14. New resource name for the batch file\n\nHowever, the algorithm to decrypt this resource is the same, except that they changed the big string that acts as a key for the bytes. Now the\nstring is: “JLKHFVIjewhyur3ikjfldskfkl23j3iuhdnfklqhrjjio2ljkeosfjh7823763647823hrfuweg56t7r6t73824y78Clop”. It is important to remember\nthat this string remains in plain text in the binary but, as it has changed, it cannot be used for a Yara rule. The same counts for the name of the\nresources and also for the hash of the resource because the bat changes per line in some cases and in another as it will have more code to\nstop services of products of security and databases.\n\nThe contents of the new BAT file are:\n\n@echo off\nvssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet\n\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c:

The code\nlargely remains the same but changing the strings can make it more difficult to detect and/or classify it correctly.\n\n\n-----\n\no e ta about t e c a ges o so e sa p es to see o p o c t e a so a e C op s\n\nSample 0403db9fcb37bd8ceec0afd6c3754314 has a compile date of 12 February, 2019 and has the following changes if compared with other\nsamples:\n\nThe file created has the name “you_offer.txt”.\nThe name of the device in the fake call to “EraseTape” and “DefineDosDeviceA” functions is “..1”.\nAn atom searched for nothing has the name of “$$$$”.\nThe mutex name is “MoneyP#666”.\nThe resources crypted with the ransom note and the bat file are called “SIXSIX1” for the batch file and the another one for the ransom\nnote “SIXSIX”.\nThe name of the batch file is “clearsystems-10-1.bat”.\nThe key for the XOR operation to decrypt the ransom note and the batch file is:\n\n“Clopfdwsjkjr23LKhuifdhwui73826ygGKUJFHGdwsieflkdsj324765tZPKQWLjwNVBFHewiuhryui32JKG”\n\nThe batch file is different to the other versions, in this case not changing the boot config of the target victim.\n\nFIGURE 16. Another version of the batch file\n\n[The email addresses to contact are: icarsole@protonmail.com and](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:icarsole@protonmail.com) [unlock@eaqltech.su .](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:unlock@eaqltech.su)\nAs a curiosity, this ransom note has a line that another does not have: “Every day of delay will cost you additional +0.5 BTC” (about\n1500-1700 $).\n\nThe 3ea56f82b66b26dc66ee5382d2b6f05d sample has the following points of difference:\n\nThe name of the file created is “popup.txt”.\nThe DefineDosDeviceA name is “1234567890”\nThe mutex is “CLOP#666”.\nThe date of compiled this sample is 7 of February.\nThe name of the bat file is “resort0-0-0-1-1-0-bat”.\nThis sample does not have support for Windows XP because a API that does not exist in Windows XP.\nThe Atom string is “27”.\n\nSample 846f93fcb65c9e01d99b867fea384edc, has these differences:\n\nThe name of the file created is “HotGIrls”.\nThe DosDevice name is “GVSDFDS”.\nAtom name: KLHJGWSEUiokgvs.\nBatch file name “clearnetworksdns-11-22-33.bat”.\n[The email address to contact: unlock@eqaltech.su,](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:unlock@eqaltech.su) [unlock@royalmail.su and](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:unlock@royalmail.su) [lestschelager@protonmail.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:lestschelager@protonmail.com)\nThe ransom note does not have the previous string of increasing the price, but the maximum number of files that can be decrypted is 7\ninstead of 6..\n\nAs the reader can understand, Clop changes very quickly in strings and name of resources to make it more complex to detect the malware.\n\nWe also observed that the .BAT files were not present in earlier Clop ransomware versions.\n\n## Global Spread\n\nBased on the versions of Clop we discovered we detected telemetry hits in the following countries:\n\n\n-----\n\nSwitzerland\nGreat Britain\nBelgium\nUnited States\nThe Netherlands\nCroatia\nPorto Rico\nGermany\nTurkey\nRussia\nDenmark\nMexico\nCanada\nDominican Republic\n\n## Vaccine\n\nThe function to check a file or a folder name using the custom hash algorithm can be a problem for the malware execution due if one of them is\nfound in execution, the malware will avoid it. If this happens with a folder, all the files inside that folder will be skipped as well.\n\nAs the algorithm and the hash is based on 32bits and only in upper case characters, it is very easy to create a collision as we know the target\nhashes and the algorithm\n\nIt cannot be used as vaccine on itself, but it can be useful to protect against the malware if the most critical files are inside of a collision folder\nname.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 17. Collision of hashes\n\nIn the screenshot “BOOT” is a correct name for the hash, but the others are collisions.\n\nThis malware has a lot of changes per version that avoid making a normal vaccine using mutex, etc.\n\n## The Odd One in the Family\n\nThat not all ransomware is created equally, especially goes for Clop. Earlier in this blog we have highlighted some interesting choices the\ndevelopers made when it came to detecting language settings, processes and the use of batch files to delete the shadow volume copies. We\nfound in the analysis some unique functions compared with other ransomware families.\n\nHowever, Clop does embrace some of the procedures we have seen with other ransomware families by not listing the ransom amount or\nmentioning a bitcoin address.\n\nVictims must communicate via email instead of with a central command and control server hosting decryption keys. In the newer versions of\nClop, victims are required to state their company name and site in the email communications. We are not absolutely sure why this is, but it\nmight be an effort to improve victim tracking.\n\nLooking at the Clop ransom note, it shares TTPs with other ransomware families; e.g. it mimics the Ryuk ransomware and contains similarities\nwith BitPaymer, however the code and functions are quite different between them.\n\n## Coverage\n\nCustomers of McAfee gateway and endpoint products are protected against this version.\n\nGenericRXHA-RK!3FE02FDD2439\nGenericRXHA-RK!160FD326A825\nTrojan-Ransom\nRansom-Clop!73FBFBB0FB34\nRansom-Clop!0403DB9FCB37\nRansom-Clop!227A9F493134\nRansom-Clop!A93B3DAA9460\nGenericRXHA-RK!35792C550176\nGenericRXHA-RK!738314AA6E07\nRDN/Generic.dx\nbub\nBAT/Ransom-Clob\nBAT/Ransom-Blob\n\n\n-----\n\nc ee S custo e s ca c eate e pe t u es to p e e t batc co a d e ecut o by t e a so a e e e a p es a e g e be o o\nreference.\n\nThe following expert rule can be used to prevent the malware from deleting the shadow volumes with vssadmin (“vssadmin Delete Shadows\n/all /quiet”).\n\nWhen the expert rule is applied at the endpoint, deletion of shadow volume fails with the following error message:\n\nThe malware also tries to stop McAfee services using command “net stop McShield /y”. The following expert rule can be used to prevent the\nmalware from stopping McAfee Services:\n\nWhen the expert rule is applied at the endpoint, the attempt to stop McAfee service using net command fails with the following error message:\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe samples use the following MITRE ATT&CK™ techniques:\n\nExecution through API (Batch file for example).\nApplication processes discovery with some procedures as the hashes of the name, and directly for the name of the process.\nFile and directory discovery: to search files to encrypt.\nEncrypt files.\nProcess discovery: enumerating all processes on the endpoint to kill some special ones.\n\n\n-----\n\nC eate es\nCreate mutants.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClop ransomware shows some characteristics that enterprises are its intended targets instead of end consumers. The authors displayed some\ncreative technical solutions, to detect the victim’s language settings and installed programs. On the other hand, we also noticed some weird\ndecisions when it came to coding certain functionalities in the ransomware. Unfortunately, it is not the first time that criminals will make money\nwith badly programmed malware.\n\nClop is constantly evolving and even though we do not know what new changes will be implemented in the future, McAfee ATR will keep a\nclose watch.\n\n## IOCs\n\n9d59ee5fc7898493b855b0673d11c886882c5c1d\nf4492b2df9176514a41067140749a54a1cfc3c49\n2950a3fcdd4e52e2b9469a33eee1012ef58e72b6\n37a62c93ba0971ed7f77f5842d8c9b8a4475866c\na71c9c0ca01a163ea6c0b1544d0833b57a0adcb4\n21bdec0a974ae0f811e056ce8c7e237fd7c220c1\n0a7ab8cc60b04e66be11eb41672991482b9c0656\nec2a3e9e9e472488b7540227448c1794ee7a5be6\ne473e5b82ce65cb58fde4956ae529453eb0ec24f\n3c8e60ce5ff0cb21be39d1176d1056f9ef9438fa\nd613f01ed5cb636feeb5d6b6843cb1686b7b7980\nc41749901740d032b8cff0e397f6c3e26d05df76\ne38bca5d39d1cfbfbcac23949700fe24a6aa5d89\n09b4c74c0cf18533c8c5022e059b4ce289066830\n37269b8d4115f0bdef96483b1de4593b95119b93\n4d885d757d00e8abf8c4993bc49886d12c250c44\nbc59ff12f71e9c8234c5e335d48f308207f6accfad3e953f447e7de1504e57af\n31829479fa5b094ca3cfd0222e61295fff4821b778e5a7bd228b0c31f8a3cc44\n35b0b54d13f50571239732421818c682fbe83075a4a961b20a7570610348aecc\ne48900dc697582db4655569bb844602ced3ad2b10b507223912048f1f3039ac6\n00e815ade8f3ad89a7726da8edd168df13f96ccb6c3daaf995aa9428bfb9ecf1\n408af0af7419f67d396f754f01d4757ea89355ad19f71942f8d44c0d5515eec8\n0d19f60423cb2128555e831dc340152f9588c99f3e47d64f0bb4206a6213d579\n7ada1228c791de703e2a51b1498bc955f14433f65d33342753fdb81bb35e5886\n8e1bbe4cedeb7c334fe780ab3fb589fe30ed976153618ac3402a5edff1b17d64\nd0cde86d47219e9c56b717f55dcdb01b0566344c13aa671613598cab427345b9\ncff818453138dcd8238f87b33a84e1bc1d560dea80c8d2412e1eb3f7242b27da\n929b7bf174638ff8cb158f4e00bc41ed69f1d2afd41ea3c9ee3b0c7dacdfa238\n102010727c6fbcd9da02d04ede1a8521ba2355d32da849226e96ef052c080b56\n7e91ff12d3f26982473c38a3ae99bfaf0b2966e85046ebed09709b6af797ef66\ne19d8919f4cb6c1ef8c7f3929d41e8a1a780132cb10f8b80698c8498028d16eb\n3ee9b22827cb259f3d69ab974c632cefde71c61b4a9505cec06823076a2f898e\nb207ce32398e8816ed44ea079904dc36\n73efd5dc218db4d8c36546d9c9efe91c\n36fe53674c67310af572daedf6e8deed\n96caf3bcd58d41d23d1a4e27f2165ae3\n7c90d8aed3efb9f8c661b1ab0a6f5986\n\n[Alexandre Mundo](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/alexandre-mundo/)\nAlexandre Mundo, Senior Malware Analyst is part of Mcafee's Advanced Threat Research team.
