There’s no\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business operation.\n\n\"The information security defense mechanism was activated in no time while conducting a\ndetailed investigation to ensure containment and recovery of data are in process and a small\nrange of services impacted by the attacks were brought back to normal.\n\n\"Consequently, we upgraded the level of cybersecurity by reviewing and enhancing current\ninfrastructure for information security and protection.\"\n\nAn Apple spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by\nBleepingComputer earlier today.\n\n_Update: Added statement from Quanta._\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n\n-----",
