Further research indicates that the \"Digital Plagiarist\" campaign has been active since at least July 2016, and possibly earlier, with\nvery rapid turn around times between the provisioning of attack/C2 infrastructure and execution of the actual attacks.\n\nBased on our observations, we believe the TelePort Crew threat actor has performed considerable research on their targets, including mapping out\nbusiness/customer relationships between the targets as well as understanding other geographic and target \"trust\" specific attributes often seen in cases of\n[watering hole attacks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack)\n\nOverview of Attack Methodology and TTP's\n\nDomain Registration\n\nThe TelePort Crew would start off by registering domain names, which closely resemble those of legitimate web sites. These web sites would be designed to\neither mimic the group's intended target, or a third party trusted by the intended target. The majority of these domain registrations appear to use a single\nregistrar, \"PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com\", and in some cases the Threat Actor would recycle the same Registrant Information. We also noted a\nnumber of specific differentiators when it comes to comparing the Registrant Information and the types of malicious websites that were used.\n\nThe following table summarizes some of the more interesting domains we have seen the TelePort Crew threat actor register as part of the \"Digital Plagiarist\"\ncampaign. While some of these domains are used for malware delivery, others are used for email domain spoofing, and C2 communications. A full list of\n(disclosable) domains suspected to be associated with the TelePort Crew's \"Digital Plagiarist\" campaign is provided in the Indicators of Compromise section:\n\nDomain Creation Registrant Registrar Org Mimicked Org Domain Mimicked Industry\nDate Country\n\nmicrofocus-official[.]com 2016- Andrey PDR Ltd.

While in the majority of cases the TelePort Pro software would \"flawlessly\" mirror the web sites, if the web page contains links to external pages which\nare outside the scope of the TelePort site mirroring configuration, the software will rewrite some of the links in the mirrored HTML files as follows:\n\nTraces of TelePort Ultra seen on irisworidwide[.]com domain:\n\n<li><a href=\"javascript:if(confirm(%27https://twitter.com/irisworldwide \\n\\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a\ndomain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address. \\n\\nDo you want to open it from the server?\n%27))window.location=%27https://twitter.com/irisworldwide%27\" tppabs=\"https://twitter.com/irisworldwide\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"icon-twitter.png\"\ntppabs=\"http://www.iris-worldwide.com/media/1239/icon-twitter.png\" alt=\"Twitter\"></a></li>\n\nTraces of TelePort Pro seen on prsnewwire[.]com domain:\n\n<a href=\"javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.omniture.com/ \\n\\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path\noutside the boundaries set for its Starting Address \\n\\nDo you want to open it from the server?\n\n\n-----\n\ny p p\n\nThe malware document \"order.docx\" is a stage 1 binary which, when opened by the end user, will download a stage 2 binary through the embedded macros in\n\n[the malicious Office document. TrustWave recently did a great write up entitled \"New Carbanak / Anunak Attack Methodology \", which provides additional details](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-Attack-Methodology/)\nregarding the malware used in that campaign, as well as an overview of C2 communications and actor TTPs. Based on correlation of TTP's and infrastructure,\nwe are fairly confident that the TelePort Crew is closely affiliated with, or is in fact the Carbanak Threat Actor. We also believe the \"Digital Plagiarist\" campaign is\nassociated with, or an evolution of, the campaign described in the recent TrustWave report.\n\nOnce the domains were properly mirrored and outfitted with malware, the TelePort Crew would craft spearphishing emails to their targets in order to lure them to\n[download and open malicious Office documents hosted on one of the above domains.

While all of the above listed domains\nare still active, only a few are still serving up mirrored content. When we started investigating this threat actor a few months ago, we were able to observe that\nalmost all of the above listed domains were, at one time, serving up mirrored page content.\n\nBased on all elements of our research, we believe the TelePort Crew threat actor will remove malicious and non-malicious content once successful execution of\nthe malware on the target has been achieved. At the same time, our analysis leads us to suggest that the TelePort Crew may also delete or rename malicious\ncontent when the Threat Actor believes their operation has been compromised.\n\nTargeted Industry / Organizations Interrelations\n\nAs we started investigating the Teleport Crew threat actor and the \"Digital Plagiarist\" campaign, it became apparent fairly quickly that the group has spent a\nconsiderable effort in understanding and mapping out affinities and business/customer relationships between their targets and the domains they would register.\n\nA good example of that is the relationship between Sizzler Family Restaurants (TelePort Crew registered \"sizzier[.]com\") and Task Retail Technology\n(TelePort Crew registered \"taskretaiitechnology[.]com\"):\n\nSizzler Family Restaurants is a restaurant chain operating in the United States and abroad (including Australia).\n\n[Task Retail Technology is a software development company based in Australia, who develop the](http://www.taskretailtechnology.com/software) xchangexec Enterprise Point-of-Sale (POS)\nsoftware.\n\n[The Task Retail Technology web site lists Sizzler as one of their customers.](http://www.taskretailtechnology.com/our-work/sizzler)\n\nAnother, yet less obvious example, is that of the \"relationship\" between Perrigo (TelePort Crew registered \"perrigointernational[.]com\") and Syngenta\n(TelePort Crew registered \"syngenta-usa[.]com\"):\n\nPerrigo is a US based Pharmaceutical Company.\nSyngenta is a Swiss Agribusiness/BioTech firm, with offices in the United States.\n\nBased on multiple news reports [[1]](http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/why-are-investors-piling-into-these-four-stocks-383983/) [[2]](http://www.law360.com/articles/726066/deals-rumor-mill-postal-savings-bank-t-mobile-syngenta) [[3]](https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/commercial-real-estate/ma-53792#3) [[4], both firms have seen similar investor profiles and were also both linked to Merger & Acquisition](https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/commercial-real-estate/ma-53792#7)\nactivity over the past year.\n\nIn a potentially more sinister, and entirely speculative twist, there may be a relationship between TrustWave and iris Worldwide Marketing (TelePort Crew\nregistered \"iris-woridwide[.]com\"):\n\niris Worldwide is marketing company responsible for marketing of some of the world's biggest brands.\n\nTrustWave is a security company who recently published [an article regarding the Carbanak / Anunak Threat Actor and their new Attack](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-Attack-Methodology/)\nMethodology.\n\nApparently, iris Worlwide was responsible for a [marketing campaign around TrustWave's Global Security Report.](http://www.iris-worldwide.com/work/trustwave-global-security-report/)\n\nAttribution\n\nThe tr1adx team initially started tracking this Threat Actor under the codename \"TelePort Crew\" as a result of some of their TTP's. As we were delving deeper\ninto the group's activities, we were seeing increasing overlap with TTP's and infrastructure associated with the Carbanak / Anunak threat actor, which was\n\nfi d d t ith th i f ti i th T tW ti l titl d \"N C b k / A k Att k M th d l \" bli h d i N b\n\n\n-----\n\ntr1adx s investigation, as well as the TrustWave investigation, point to a single IP address where the registered domains were hosted (192.99.14.211)\n\ntr1adx's investigation revealed that two domains we had been tracking (dhl-service-au[.]com and prsnewwire[.]com) were registered by a Registrant\nName purporting to be \"Remin Vladmiri\". The same individual also registered \"park-travels[.]com\", which has been associated with the Carbanak/Anunak\nthreat actor.\n\nThe malware used in the \"Digital Plagiarist\" campaign appears to closely resemble that attributed to the Carbanak/Anunak threat actor, in terms of\nmalware delivery, malware URL path, and behavior.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe tr1adx team believes it is important to note that while we have seen this threat actor register domains similar in nature to domains belonging to legitimate\norganizations, we are in no way suggesting that these legitimate organizations or its customers were a direct target for the TelePort Crew threat actor. We do\nbelieve the group has leveraged the reputation and legitimacy of these organizations to give more credit to the \"Digital Plagiarist\" campaign, in turn potentially\nyielding a higher rate of success for compromising the group's victims.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): Domains (25+) - Summary Table**\n\nmicrofocus-official[.]com iris-woridwide[.]com google3-ssl[.]com\n\nperrigointernational[.]com strideindustrialusa[.]com google4-ssl[.]com\n\nornuafood[.]com waldorfs-astoria[.]com ssl-googles4[.]com\n\nesb-energy-int[.]com atlantis-bahamas[.]com google2-ssl[.]com\n\nfda-gov[.]com sizzier[.]com google5-ssl[.]com\n\ntreasury-government[.]com taskretaiitechnology[.]com ssl-googlesr5[.]com\n\nbentley-systems-ltd[.]com dhl-service-au[.]com bols-googls[.]com\n\nzynga-ltd[.]com prsnewwire[.]com\n\nsyngenta-usa[.]com google-ssls[.]com\n\nai0ha[.]com google-stel[.]com\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP Addresses - Summary Table**\n\n192.99.14.211\n\n31.41.41.41\n\n144.76.61.231\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): File Hashes - Summary Table**\n\norder.docx\n\nMD5: 950afc52444e3b23a4923ab07c1e7d87\n\nSHA1: 1827a7daa98c127af11318eebe23ec367f9146c9\n\norder.docx\n\nMD5: ae8404ad422e92b1be7561c418c35fb7\n\nSHA1: 400f02249ba29a19ad261373e6ff3488646e95fb\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) [Downloadable Files]:**\n\nIf a log search for any of these Indicators of Compromise returns positive hits, we recommend you initiate appropriate cyber investigative processes\nimmediately and engage Law Enforcement where appropriate.\n\n|microfocus-official[.]com perrigointernational[.]com ornuafood[.]com esb-energy-int[.]com fda-gov[.]com treasury-government[.]com bentley-systems-ltd[.]com zynga-ltd[.]com syngenta-usa[.]com ai0ha[.]com|iris-woridwide[.]com strideindustrialusa[.]com waldorfs-astoria[.]com atlantis-bahamas[.]com sizzier[.]com taskretaiitechnology[.]com dhl-service-au[.]com prsnewwire[.]com google-ssls[.]com google-stel[.]com|google3-ssl[.]com google4-ssl[.]com ssl-googles4[.]com google2-ssl[.]com google5-ssl[.]com ssl-googlesr5[.]com bols-googls[.]com|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|192.99.14.211 31.41.41.41 144.76.61.231|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----",
