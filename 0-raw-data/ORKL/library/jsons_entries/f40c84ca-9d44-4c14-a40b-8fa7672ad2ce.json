The file is designed so that default Windows\nsettings do not display its .exe extension, Secureworks said.\n\nSecureworks also explained that the executable file displays a decoy document written in\nEnglish, though the filename itself is in Russian. The document appears to be legitimate\nand contains data pertaining to asylum applications and migratory pressure in the three\ncountries that border Belarus — Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. The content also includes\ncommentary on European Union sanctions against Belarus for its role in the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhen executed, the file downloads three additional files from a staging server. One of them\nis a legitimate signed file from Global Graphics Software, a UK-based firm. The file uses\nDLL search-order hijacking to import an updated version of PlugX, a remote-access Trojan\n(RAT) that has been previously associated with Bronze President.\n\n\"DLL search-order hijacking has been around for years,\" says Mike McLellan, director of\nintelligence at Secureworks. \"It's a well-known technique by threat actors in which they\nmaliciously use a legitimate executable file, often from a well-known vendor, together with a\nmalicious library file (DLL), to load and execute an encrypted malware payload.\"\n\nThreat actors use the technique because it ensures that the malicious payload file on a\ncompromised system is never sitting around on disk in a manner that scanners and antimalware can detect.\n\n\"This technique has been a staple of several China-nexus threat groups for many years,\"\nMcLellan says.\n\nAs part of the attack chain, the threat actors have also included a ping command that adds\na significant delay before executing the legitimate signed file, Secureworks said — a\ngeneric evasion technique to introduce a time lag while files are downloaded to the victim.\n\nThe staging server that Secureworks observed the threat actor using in the current\n[campaign hosts a domain that Proofpoint earlier this year linked to a PlugX campaign](http://proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\nagainst diplomatic entities in Europe. The security vendor determined that campaign to be\n\n\n-----\n\nmotivated by matters related to the war in Ukraine as well. The same domain has also been\nlinked to Bronze President attacks in 2020 that Secureworks observed against the Vatican.\n\n**A New Set of Victims for Bronze Panda**\n\nBronze President is a threat group that has been active since at least 2018, according to\nthe researchers. Secureworks and others have assessed the group as being China-based\nand likely sponsored by — or operating with the knowledge of — the Chinese government.\n[The group has been associated with numerous attacks on nongovernmental organizations](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos)\nand others, mostly in Asia but to some extent in other countries. Last year, for example,\nresearchers from McAfee spotted the threat actor conducting a major cyber espionage\noperation targeting telecommunication companies in the US, Asia, and Europe.\n\nThe latest campaign represents a departure from the usual for the group, since it targets\nRussian entities, according to McLellan: \"This is substantially different to what we have\nseen over the past two years where Bronze President has been about 90% focused on\nMyanmar and Vietnam. We believe they still have a mission in the Asia region, but this has\nbeen a bit of a departure for them.\"\n\n[Attacks/BreachesAdvanced Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches)\n\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly-discovered vulnerabilities, data breach\ninformation, and emerging trends.
