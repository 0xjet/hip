Several\nhouse bills have been introduced to study or enable this, such as the “Study on Cyber-Attack\nResponse Options Act” and “Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act”.\n\n## What is hacking back?\n\nHacking back is an umbrella term for various proposed exceptions to the Computer Fraud\nand Abuse Act (CFAA), which is the United States’ main law against computer hacking.\nThese exceptions would allow security experts to engage in retaliatory hacking against\ncriminal actors, for purposes such as attribution or disruption.\n\nWhilst the Active Cyber Defense Certainty (ACDC) Act is highly specific, the more general\ndiscussion extends far beyond its’ bounds. Opinions range from allowing limited intrusions\nwithin a pre-approved scope, to an all-out free-for-all with no prior approval or oversight.\nMore recently, there have been several opinion pieces calling for “cyber letters of marque”\nallowing security professionals to engage in privateering.\n\nThe main provisions of the ACDC act enable defenders to engage in hacking against\nattacker-controlled infrastructure for the following purposes:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Attribution of attackers\n2. Disrupting attacks against the victim’s network\n3. Recovering or destroying stolen victim data\n4. Learning about attacker behavior for purposes of building better defenses\n\nAt the core of all these beliefs is that by leveling the playing field, defenders could better\nrespond to intrusions and deter attacks.\n\n## Prominent Issues with active cyber defense\n\n Prosecution\n\nThe ACDC Act uses the language “as a defense to prosecution”, which implies it does not\nprevent charging or prosecution, but simply acts as a potential defense at trial. This would be\nsimilar to how self-defense may not stop you being arrested and charged, only potentially\navoid conviction.\n\nStatistically only about 5% of federal cases even make it to trial. Cybercrime cases often\nspend years in the pretrial phase and can cost upwards of one million dollars in legal fees.\nFurthermore, prosecutors offer significantly lower punishments for defendants who plead\nguilty. It’s often better for defendants to accept a certainty, rather than leave their fate in the\nhands of 12 random citizens. The combination of time, cost, risk, and emotional burden leads\nto many innocent defendants pleading guilty to avoid trial.\n\nThe ACDC act also specifically states that it is not a defense to civil action, which could lead\nto a whole host of problems. For example, victims prevented from paying ransomware\nransoms due to ACDC enabled disruptions could sue disruptors to recover losses. Damages\ncould also be sought by ISPs hosting attacker infrastructure, other active defenders, or even\nthreat actors themselves.\n\nGiven the global nature of the internet, bills such as the ACDC act would also offer no\nprotection against international law. If active defenders intrude into foreign systems, or US\nsystems owned by foreign companies, they may still find themselves in hot water.\n\nWhilst many large companies can afford to bankroll legal defenses and shield employees\nfrom direct prosecution, small firms, contractors, and individuals would not be so lucky.\nOverall the act offers flimsy protections, and would simply be handing more powers to large\ncorporations who can afford lengthy court proceedings.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nWhilst risk of prosecution may be mitigated by the ACDC act’s requirement of advanced\napproval from the Department of Justice (DOJ), this gives rise to a major conflict of interest.\n\n\n-----\n\nLaw enforcement s goal is to gather intelligence with the intention of arresting perpetrators,\nwhich means monitoring attackers as quietly as possible. Law enforcement operations can\ntake many months or years to complete and whilst they may be of little help to victims in the\nshort term, the arrest of key players can prevent many further attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, uncoordinated active defense is a much shorter sighted goal. Many\ndefenders will be looking to disrupt individual attacks against their clients at the expense of\nlong-term intelligence gathering. Whilst disruption can be good, it also forces attackers to\nevolve and adapt, making further monitoring and disruption more difficult.\n\nAny disruption against attacker systems is certain to alert the attackers to a breach. Even\npassive intelligence collection for identification purposes is not guaranteed to go unnoticed.\nThe more intrusions into an attacker system, the more likely attackers are to notice. With no\nway of coordinating and synchronizing access across private industry and government at\nscale, the risk of discovery is extremely high.\n\nIt will likely be in law enforcement’s best interest to simply deny all active defense requests,\nas they pose a direct threat to their primary mission. The suggested notification process\nwould not be enough to mitigate such risks, and anything short of direct oversight is doomed\nto fail.\n\n## Perverse Incentives & deconfliction\n\nBills such as the ACDC act would create a lucrative new market, allowing security testing\ncompanies to offer services acting as cyber-mercenaries on behalf of attack victims. Whilst\nmany hacking skills translate well to active cyber defense, they do not provide the whole\npicture.\n\nActive cyber defense introduces new variables such as the need for deconfliction to avoid\ndamaging operations other than one’s own. Active defenders would need to tread carefully to\nalso avoid disrupting both domestic and foreign military or intelligence operations. The\nsensitive nature of such operations means that without strong ties to the military and\nintelligence community, this will be nigh-impossible. Furthermore, a combination of varying\nobjectives and financial incentive may mean there is little desire to even attempt deconfliction\nfrom the perspective of private industry.\n\nSome considerations when accessing attacker-controlled infrastructure are:\n\n1. Am I at risk of polluting or destroying logs, making it harder for others to discern actual\n\nattackers from friendly intruders?\n2. Is this infrastructure attacker owned? Am I sure it’s not a compromised system, an IP\n\naddress that has since changed hands, a proxy, false flag, or currently under the\ncontrol of law enforcement?\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Could my activities result in negative changes in attacker behavior, such as increased\n\naggression in order to recuperate losses?\n4. Am I at risk of doing something that could lead to discovery, burning access for\n\neveryone or resulting in attacker retaliation?\n5. Am I even likely to gain anything novel and objectively beneficial from this intrusion?\n6. Is it likely that nobody is already quietly doing what I intend to do (attributing attacks,\n\nalerting victims, improving security guidance based on attacker behavior, disrupting\nintrusions)?\n\nThings get extremely messy when you have potentially hundreds of defenders all trying to\nmake these same determinations, based on their varying insight and goals, with little to no\ncoordination between each other. It will fast become a scenario of far too many cooks.\n\n## It already exists\n\nWhilst not anyone can just pick up a laptop and start throwing hands at the nearest threat\nactor, active defense is already commonplace. Law enforcement already possess abilities to\ngrant legal protections to private individuals or companies assisting with operations.\n\nBotnet takedowns, like the recent action against Emotet, are just one example of private\nindustry engaging in active defense.\n\nThe Emotet takedown was a highly coordinated operation involving individual researchers,\nprivate companies, and law enforcement agencies spanning nine countries. The operation\nwas spearheaded by law enforcement to avoid duplicate or conflicting operations, but leaned\nheavily on the capabilities of private industry. The synergy between private sector and\ngovernment allowed for a multifaceted approach, causing maximum impact. The action\ninvolved a complete takeover of the botnet, shutting down distribution channels and actor\ninfrastructure, as well as simultaneous law enforcement raids aimed at hindering future\nreconstruction.\n\nDespite years of planning, and being one of the largest public/private sector operations ever\nconducted, the Emotet takedown resulted in only ten months of downtime. Now, a ten month\noutage is no small feat. The operation was a huge success and likely averted billions of\ndollars in damage. But, this goes to show that even the most well planned and well-executed\noperation can only do so much. We need to focus on strong conventional defenses to\ncomplement existing active defense, rather than create a digital wild west of cyber\nmercenaries. The last thing we need is large coordinated operations being disrupted by\nhandfuls of poorly thought out attacks, which serve as only a minor nuisance to threat actors.\n\n## Is it necessary for private industry to engage in active defense?\n\n\n-----\n\nPerhaps most telling is the fact that not a single person I spoke to in law enforcement,\nmilitary, intelligence, or cyber threat intelligence thought such legislation was a good idea.\nMuch of the support came from other parts of the industry where hacking prowess is\ncommon, but experience dealing with real world threat actors is extremely rare.\n\nIt’s my belief that much of the push for active cyber defense was born out of a growing\nfrustration with the constantly increasing volume and severity of cyberattacks. Many believe\nthat enough isn’t being done to combat them, but why is that? And does active cyber\ndefense solve this problem?\n\n## The immunity window\n\nCurrently there exists a major blind spot in the government’s ability to respond to\ncyberattacks. Law enforcement deal with cybercrime within their jurisdiction, meanwhile the\nmilitary and intelligence community target hostile state actors and other national security\nthreats. But what happens when a threat actor falls into neither category?\n\nThe immunity window exists when a threat actor is shielded from law enforcement by their\nhome nation; however, they do not meet the threshold for classification as either a state actor\nor a national security threat. This is the sweet spot in which many ransomware actors\noperate.\n\nRansomware actors residing in countries unfriendly toward the US may find themselves\nimmune to prosecution, so long as they do not target their home nation or its allies. Whilst\nransomware actors who pose a clear and present threat to public safety may find themselves\nin the crosshairs of Cyber Command Et. al., until then they are essentially free to operate\nwith impunity.\n\nAllowing private industry to engage in active cyber defense admittedly could close this\nwindow, albeit at a great cost. Such activities would jeopardize operations against threat\nactors already within reach of the US government, cancelling out any potential benefit. Active\ncyber defense may also be seen as an act of aggression by the host nations, leading to\nescalation and the potential of state backed retaliation against US private industry.\n\n## Future discussion\n\nAn ideal solution should aim to close the immunity window without detriment to law\nenforcement, military, or intelligence operations, and ideally without drastically increasing the\nreach of such agencies. Whilst active cyber defense by private industry should not be a\nsolution in and of itself, there may be some situations in which it could be of use as a last\nresort; however, this should only be done under direct governmental oversight.\n\nFor now, I leave this open as I work on a follow up piece. Congratulations are in order if you\nmade it this far.\n\n\n-----",
