Additional research has\nbeen done by multiple security professionals since then, to better understand the logic used\nby the malware and to filter out false positives. These sources are referenced throughout this\npost.\n\nUPDATE 2020-12-19 23:20 UTC: updated results table\n\nUPDATE 2020-12-21 15:37 UTC: updated section on C2 infrastructure based on current\nfindings\n\n[UPDATE 2020-12-22 17:04 UTC: added link to Invoke-SunburstDecoder](https://github.com/Truesec/sunburst-decoder)\n\nUPDATE 2020-12-22 22:48 UTC: added section: Disabling security services and avoiding\ndetection\n\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE 2020-12-23 17:33 UTC: updated results table\nUPDATE 2021-01-26 13:00 UTC: clarified some of the statements about targeted\norganizations, as they are only assumptions.\n\n_This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that had the SUNBURST_\n_backdoor installed, as well as which of these organizations have indications of having_\n_proceeded to the second stage of the attack, where further internal compromise might have_\n_taken place._\n\n## Summary\n\nThe recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyber attack that is one of the most severe in\nhistory.\n\nA supply chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to\npotentially 18,000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.\n\nThe infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe\nthe threat actor systems to request instructions.\n\nTruesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to\ndetermine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor might have explicitly\nselected for further activities, where it is possible that further internal compromise took place.\nThese assumptions are based on historical network data (passive DNS) and the logic within\nthe malware when handling certain responses.\n\nWhile this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the\ntype of organizations that were potentially the real targets of the attack.\n\nSome names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (Cisco GGSG), us.deloitte.co (Deloitte),\nnswhealth.net (NSW Ministry of Health in Australia), banccentral.com (service supplier of\nIT and security for banks), and many others.\n\nThe impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach\nwill most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted\nparts of the intelligence community.\n\n## Introduction\n\nA supply chain attack leveraged SolarWinds to deliver malicious software updates to their\ncustomers (approximately 18.000 potentially affected customers according to SolarWinds).\nThe update installed a sophisticated backdoor giving the threat actor the ability to access\nselected targets and proceed with further activities inside the compromised organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is believed that the attack was carried out by a nation-state actor, likely APT29 a.k.a. Cozy\nBear, i.e. Russian Intelligence.\n\n[FireEye and Microsoft initially published reports[1][2] describing some of the inner workings](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n[of the backdoor. A second, more detailed, post was later published by FireEye[15]. The](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/sunburst-additional-technical-details.html)\nbackdoor is remarkably sophisticated and is worth a long technical description, while only\nsome of its functionalities and characteristics are described in this article.\n\nTruesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the backdoor as well as historical network data to\nidentify patterns revealing possible victims.\n\nDue to the nature of the attack, a large number of organizations around the world have been\naffected by the backdoor, while likely only a smaller number were specifically selected and\ntargeted by the threat actor to conduct additional internal compromise (phase 2).\n\n## Technical Background\n\nThe threat actor was able to inject a backdoor in the Solarwinds Orion software by modifying\nthe source code of an existing plugin, which was then signed by Solarwinds and published\nas part of an update available on the SolarWinds website. SolarWinds published an\n[advisory[3] specifying the versions affected.](https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory)\n\nThe malicious update has been available for several months and there are indications of\nbreaches as early as March 2020. One of the identified malicious updates was hosted at the\nfollowing URL:\n```\nhxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220\nCore-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp\n\n```\nThe update package was properly digitally-signed, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 - Malicious\n\nSolarwinds Orion update containing SUNBURST backdoor\nThe backdoor code was made part of the following digitally-signed Orion component:\n```\nSolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll\n\n```\nThis DLL is also signed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 - Malicious\n\nSolarwinds Orion DLL containing SUNBURST backdoor\nThe backdoor implements sophisticated functionality to communicate with the threat actor\ninfrastructure and applies logic to determine what actions should be taken.\n\nAs a large number of Orion servers around the world have been infected with the backdoor,\nthe threat actor had to have a way to determine which organization was contacting the attack\ninfrastructure to be able to select the real target of this attack. This logic is partially explained\n[below. For details see the FireEye article [15].](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/sunburst-additional-technical-details.html)\n\nThe hacked servers that received the Solarwinds backdoor periodically probe the threat actor\ninfrastructure with a DNS query like the following:\n```\n<DGA_value>.appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nwhere <DGA_value> is computed with a DomainName Generation Algorithm and contains\nan encoded version of the internal Active Directory name of the infected server. The threat\nactor server decodes the information in the DNS requests and uses the internal domain\nname of the organization to determine what instructions to send back.\n\nTruesec reversed the backdoor and identified a set of IP address ranges that, when received\nas part of the DNS response, will determine the actions taken by the backdoor code. Part of\nthis code is illustrated in the figure below.\n\nFigure 3 – Reversed SUNBURST backdoor showing IP ranges used to determine next\nactions\nThe AddressFamily field determines what the backdoor should do next, which can be\nroughly summarized as follows:\n\n**Atm or ImpLink : Terminate (killswitch).**\n\n**Ipx : Go to initial state and keep polling.**\n\n**NetBios: Start or continue second stage. Can initialize an HTTP backdoor channel used to**\ncollect additional information and deploy a second stage malware (specified by the threat\nactor at the time of instructions, and therefore specific to the target).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can therefore assume that if the initial probe was answered with an address of type\n**NetBios, the threat actor had configured the backdoor to move to the second stage, which is**\nwhere additional malware can be deployed to possibly perform additional internal\ncompromise.\n\nGiven the number of affected organizations, it is still likely that a large number of victims with\nindications of stage 2, as described here, were later filtered out by the threat actor (not\ndeemed worthy of further attack).\n\n## Identifying Internal Names of Victims\n\nThe DomainName Generation Algorithm described earlier, used to create a DNS query\ncontaining an encoded value of the internal domain name of the compromised organization,\ncan be reversed.\n\n[RedDrip Team published a report[4] and a script[5] to decode the DGA part of the DNS](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/v-ekPFtVNZG1W7vWjcuVug)\nrequests, therefore allowing to retrieve the cleartext value of the internal domain name of the\nhacked server that made the request.\n\nFor example, if a compromised server makes the following request to the threat actor server:\n```\nciepcqqog816s6urtt6t0kf60ceo6e20.appsync-api.us-east-2.avsvmcloud[.]com\n\n```\nThis can be decoded to obtain the following internal name of the victim:\n```\nggsg-us.cisco\n\n```\nThis means that having records of performed DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com will reveal\nthe internal names of the compromised organizations.\n\nThe SUNBURST backdoor uses the following three parameters to create a \"Host Id\" used in\nthe DNS requests:\n\nMAC address of the network interface\nInternal domain name that the machine is joined to\nMachine Guid from\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid**\n\nSince the DGA values from DNS requests can be decoded, if you have a DNS request and\nyou want to see if it was generated from a certain machine, you only need to know MAC\naddress, internal domain name, and machine Guid.\n\nThis can be extremely helpful during investigations to determine if a machine had a\ncommunicating SUNBURST backdoor on it. We wrote a PowerShell script that can be used\n[for this, based on the great work by Erik Hjelmvik, Netresec.](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2020-12&post=Reassembling-Victim-Domain-Fragments-from-SUNBURST-DNS)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Identifying Threat Actor Instructions\n\nThe next step was to obtain historical records of DNS requests, including the response.\n[We obtained some of the available historical data[6].](https://github.com/bambenek/research/tree/main/sunburst)\n\nThe sample data contains 1528 DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com and their responses.\n\nWhen filtered for requests matching the DGA algorithm syntax, we have requests with dates\nranging from early April to December 2020.\n\nThis is an example of such request and response:\n```\ndate : 2020-04-19 08:24:26\nlast_seen : 2020-04-19 08:24:27\nqtype : 1\ndomain : avsvmcloud.com\nqname : q8bps26mocuq6re4dutru70ct2w.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud.com\nvalue_ip : 8.18.144.138\ntype : ip\n_key : 0e8ab64d5f5aff04fea862f4f72fcf1d04c3d377\nvalue : 8.18.144.138\n\n```\nFrom this data we can determine that on April 19, a request was made that decodes to theth\ninternal name pageaz.gov, and received as response 8.18.144.138, which according to the\nbackdoor logic explained earlier maps to address type NetBios, meaning that the threat\nactor might have deployed an HTTP backdoor in this environment.\n\n## Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nBy analyzing the IP addresses returned when instructing infected servers to establish an\nHTTP backdoor, we can identify the following blocks.\n\n**IP block** **Registered Organization (WHOIS information)**\n\n184.72.0.0 / 255.254.0.0 Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n71.152.53.0 / 255.255.255.0 Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n8.18.144.0 / 255.255.254.0 Amazon Inc.\n\n87.238.80.0 / 255.255.248.0 Amazon Data Services Ireland DUB3 Datacentre\n\n18.130.0.0 / 255.255.0.0 Amazon Technologies Inc.\n\n99.79.0.0 / 255.255.0.0 Amazon Data Services Canada\n\n199.201.117.0 / 255.255.255.0 Traiana, Inc\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1 – List of IP blocks used when instructing systems to establish an HTTP backdoor,\nmapped to WHOIS information\nThese IP blocks are not used to establish the HTTP connection. Instead, if a CNAME record\nis contained in the response, that is the address used as C2 address for the new HTTP\nchannel. FireEye listed the CNAME responses that they have observed as part of their\n[indicators of compromise[9]. These are also reported below for convenience:](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/indicator_release/Indicator_Release_NBIs.csv)\n```\nfreescanonline[.]com\ndeftsecurity[.]com\nfreescanonline[.]com\nthedoccloud[.]com\n\n```\nWe initially thought that the A records in the blocks above were the C2 addresses, which\nwould also make sense as almost all are part of the Amazon infrastructure and threat actors\noften use cloud providers to host their attack infrastructure. This would have also meant that\nthe block belonging to Traiana, Inc could potentially be under the control of the threat actor.\n\nTruesec Threat Intelligence observed a large number of DNS responses from the threat actor\nserver providing different IP addresses in the range 199.201.117.0/24 for the next stage.\n\nAt this point in time, it does not seem that these IP blocks were under the control of the\nthreat actor, but were instead deliberately used as part of the logic within the backdoor.\n\n## Putting the Pieces Together\n\nWe have decoded the DGA parts of the requests to identify internal domain names of\ncompromised organizations, correlated that with the responses received from the threat actor\nserver, and mapped them with the hardcoded list of IP ranges in the backdoor code.\n\nThis gives us a (partial) list of breached organizations, and which ones had the SUNBURST\nbackdoor configured for the second stage of the attack where further internal compromise\nmight have taken place.\n\nNote that some of the names are truncated. Further analysis is ongoing to determine if this\ncan be improved.\n\nThe results are summarized at the bottom of this post. This list contains the decoded values\nof internal domain names. We can therefore only assume that they belong to an\norganization based on the name of the domains and publicly available information.\n\nSome of the internal names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (Cisco GGSG), us.deloitte.co\n(Deloitte), nswhealth.net (NSW Ministry of Health in Australia), banccentral.com (service\nsupplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.\n\n## Disabling Security Services and Avoiding Detection\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor keeps an eye on a number of processes, services, and device drivers. It\n[simply avoids running if any of the following 137 processes are detected on the system.](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/IISResetMe/d61a2263c617959eda2682e94f8df8b1/raw/ebc9e675c961c2c3f5b8dbb3c2ee1c83f6181731/dealbreakers.txt)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\napimonitor x64\napimonitor-x86\nautopsy64\nautopsy\nautoruns64\nautoruns\nautorunsc64\nautorunsc\nbinaryninja\nblacklight\ncutter\nde4dot\ndebugview\ndiskmon\ndnsd\ndnspy\ndotpeek32\ndotpeek64\ndumpcap\nexeinfope\nfakedns\nfakenet\nffdec\nfiddler\nfileinsight\nfloss\ngdb\nhiew32\nidaq64\nidaq\nidr\nildasm\nilspy\njd-gui\nlordpe\nofficemalscanner\nollydbg\npdfstreamdumper\npe-bear\npebrowse64\npeid\npe-sieve32\npe-sieve64\npestudio\npeview\npexplorer\nppee\nppee\nprocdump64\nprocdump\nprocesshacker\nprocexp64\nprocexp\nprocmon\nprodiscoverbasic\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\npy2exedecompiler\nr2agent\nrabin2\nradare2\nramcapture64\nramcapture\nreflector\nregmon\nresourcehacker\nretdec-ar-extractor\nretdec-bin2llvmir\nretdec-bin2pat\nretdec-config\nretdec-fileinfo\nretdec-getsig\nretdec-idr2pat\nretdec-llvmir2hll\nretdec-macho-extractor\nretdec-pat2yara\nretdec-stacofin\nretdec-unpacker\nretdec-yarac\nrundotnetdll\nsbiesvc\nscdbg\nscylla_x64\nscylla_x86\nshellcode_launcher\nsolarwindsdiagnostics\nsysmon64\nsysmon\ntcpdump\ntcpvcon\ntcpview\nvboxservice\nwin32_remote\nwin64_remotex64\nwindbg\nwindump\nwinhex64\nwinhex\nwinobj\nwireshark\nx32dbg\nx64dbg\nxwforensics64\nxwforensics\nredcloak\navgsvc\navgui\navgsvca\navgidsagent\navgsvcx\navgwdsvcx\navgadminclientservice\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nafwserv\navastui\navastsvc\naswidsagent\naswidsagenta\naswengsrv\navastavwrapper\nbccavsvc\npsanhost\npsuaservice\npsuamain\navp\navpui\nksde\nksdeui\ntanium\ntaniumclient\ntaniumdetectengine\ntaniumendpointindex\ntaniumtracecli\ntaniumtracewebsocketclient64\n\n```\nThe second check is a list of 8 services matched by process names. The backdoor searches\nfor the services and keeps track of the status of the services. Additionally, it changes the\nsecurity descriptor of the service registry key and the start parameter. The service is never\nstopped by the backdoor and it looks like it simply waits until the machine restarts for the\nservice to change state. The state of the services is recorded and stored in the DLL config\nfile using the parameter RetryWatcherPostpone\n\nThe [list of services is the following:](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/IISResetMe/d61a2263c617959eda2682e94f8df8b1/raw/ebc9e675c961c2c3f5b8dbb3c2ee1c83f6181731/maleable-detectors.txt)\n```\nmsmpeng\nmssense\ncavp\ncb\ncsfalconservice\ncsfalconcontainer\nxagt\nxagtnotif\nekrn\neguiproxy\negui\nfsgk32st\nfswebuid\nfsgk32\nfsma32\nfssm32\nfnrb32\nfsaua\nfsorsp\nfsav32\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor avoids tampering with the start parameter of the WinDefend service and\nonly changes the service key security descriptor.\n\n[The third check is performed to detect 17 specific device drivers. This check behaves the](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/IISResetMe/d61a2263c617959eda2682e94f8df8b1/raw/ebc9e675c961c2c3f5b8dbb3c2ee1c83f6181731/dealbreaking-drivers.txt)\nsame way as the check for processes and will make sure that the backdoor aborts if any of\nthe following drivers are detected.\n```\ncybkerneltracker.sys\natrsdfw.sys\neaw.sys\nrvsavd.sys\ndgdmk.sys\nsentinelmonitor.sys\nhexisfsmonitor.sys\ngroundling32.sys\ngroundling64.sys\nsafe-agent.sys\ncrexecprev.sys\npsepfilter.sys\ncve.sys\nbrfilter.sys\nbrcow_x_x_x_x.sys\nlragentmf.sys\nlibwamf.sys\n\n```\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the detection of any of the specified processes\nor device drivers will always alter the execution path of the backdoor and discontinue the\n**execution. While the detection of the listed services will only alter the execution path if a**\nchange in the status was detected.\n\n**Note that for services running as protected services, changing the service registry start**\nparameter is not possible while the service is running. This applies to services related to any\nantimalware with ELAM capabilities like the Windows Defender.\n\nThe Backdoor does not try to avoid the listed antivirus, antimalware, and EDR service. For\nunknown reasons, it tries to keep track of the status of these services.\n\n## Impact of the Attack\n\nThe target organizations, the threat actor sophistication, and the amount of time between the\ninitial breach and the discovery strongly indicates an impact of gigantic proportions.\n\nIt is highly likely that a massive amount of highly confidential information belonging to\ngovernment organizations, medical institutions, cybersecurity, the financial industry, etc. has\nbeen leaked. It is also highly likely that software and systems have been compromised and\nthat the modus operandi of the SolarWinds breach can be repeated in future campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore information will be disclosed during the upcoming months but the full extent of this\nbreach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to\ntrusted parts of the intelligence community.\n\n## Results of the Analysis\n\n\n**Decoded Internal Name** **Possible Organization**\n\n**(may be inaccurate)***\n\n\n**Observed**\n\n**Message**\n\n\n**First**\n**Seen**\n\n\nf.gnam 2nd stage 202004-04\n\ncorp.stratusnet Stratus Networks 2nd stage 202004-17\n\npageaz.gov City of Page 2nd stage 202004-19\n\ntx.org 2nd stage 202004-19\n\nnewdirections.kc 2nd stage 202004-21\n\nchristieclinic.com Christie Clinic Telehealth 2nd stage 202004-22\n\nosb.local 2nd stage 202004-28\n\nMOC.local 2nd stage 202004-30\n\nehtuh- 2nd stage 202005-01\n\n\nresprod.com Res Group (Renewable energy\ncompany)\n\n\n2nd stage 202005-06\n\n\nbarrie.ca City of Barrie 2nd stage 202005-13\n\n\nte.nz TE Connectivity (Sensor\nmanufacturer)\n\nfisherbartoninc.com The Fisher Barton Group (Blade\nManufacturer)\n\n\n2nd stage 202005-13\n\n2nd stage 202005-15\n\n\nsdch.local South Davis Community Hospital 2nd stage 202005-18\n\n\n-----\n\ninternal.jtl.c 2nd stage 202005-19\n\nmnh.rg-law.ac.il College of Law and Business, Israel 2nd stage 202005-26\n\nRPM.loca 2nd stage 202005-28\n\nCIRCU 2nd stage 202005-30\n\nmagnoliaisd.loc Magnolia Independent School District 2nd stage 202006-01\n\nfidelitycomm.lo Fidelity Communications (ISP) 2nd stage 202006-02\n\nfidelitycomm.local 2nd stage 202006-02\n\ncorp.stingraydi Stingray (Media and entertainment) 2nd stage 202006-03\n\nkeyano.local Keyano College 2nd stage 202006-03\n\nfriendshipstatebank.com 2nd stage 202006-06\n\nghsmain1.ggh.g 2nd stage 202006-09\n\nieb.go.id 2nd stage 202006-12\n\nnswhealth.net NSW Health 2nd stage 202006-12\n\ncity.kingston.on.ca City of Kingston, Ontario, Canada 2nd stage 202006-15\n\nservitia.intern 2nd stage 202006-16\n\nCONSOLID 2nd stage 202006-17\n\n\ncorp.ptci.com Pioneer Telephone Scholarship\nRecipients\n\n\n2nd stage 202006-19\n\n\n-----\n\nironform.com Ironform (metal fabrication) 2nd stage 202006-19\n\ndigitalsense.co Digital Sense (Cloud Services) 2nd stage 202006-24\n\nggsg-us.cisco Cisco GGSG 2nd stage 202006-24\n\nCentralY 2nd stage 202006-24\n\nsignaturebank.l Signature Bank 2nd stage 202006-25\n\nsignaturebank.local 2nd stage 202006-25\n\nAerial.l 2nd stage 202006-26\n\nmountsinai.hosp Mount Sinai Hospital 2nd stage 202007-02\n\npqcorp.com PQ Corporation 2nd stage 202007-02\n\nmountsinai.hospital Mount Sinai Hospital, New York 2nd stage 202007-02\n\nbanccentral.com BancCentral Financial Services Corp. 2nd stage 202007-03\n\nfhc.local 2nd stage 202007-06\n\nisi 2nd stage 202007-06\n\ngxw 2nd stage 202007-07\n\n\nkcpl.com Kansas City Power and Light\nCompany\n\n\n2nd stage 202007-07\n\n\nlufkintexas.net Lufkin (City in Texas) 2nd stage 202007-07\n\nsm-group.local SM Group (Distribution) 2nd stage 202007-07\n\n\n-----\n\ncys.local CYS Group (Marketing analytics) 2nd stage 202007-10\n\nescap.org 2nd stage 202007-10\n\nftsillapachecasi 2nd stage 202007-10\n\noslerhc.org William Osler Health System 2nd stage 202007-11\n\nwrbaustralia.ad W.
