They stated:\n“Conti cyberthreat actors remain active and Conti ransomware attacks against U.S. and\ninternational organizations have risen to more than 1,000. Notable attack vectors include\nTrickbot and Cobalt Strike.”\n\neSentire’s Threat Response Unit security research team (TRU) has been tracking the\n[movements of the Conti gang for over two years. TRU issued a new report on the](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/conti-ransomware-gang-claims-50-new-victims-including-oil-terminal-operator-sea-invest) Conti\nGang on March 7, 2022, two days prior to the CISA alert, where it warned its customers and\ncritical infrastructure organizations that the Conti gang was continuing to launch attacks\nagainst oil terminals, pharmaceutical companies, food manufacturers, IT services providers,\netc. Conti declared its allegiance to Russia immediately following Russia’s invasion into\nUkraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Conti’s Name and Shame Site indicating allegiance to Russia._\n\nTRU is publishing a new set of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which are currently being\nused by a Conti affiliate, and eSentire is encouraging security defenders to also use these to\ndetect any possible Conti activity in their networks. These IOCs all link back to the Cobalt\nStrike infrastructure.\n\nEvery week for the past three years, the public has heard countless news reports of\nbusinesses and public entities being compromised by ransomware. However, in these\nincidents, it is usually the ransomware groups behind the attacks that grab the headlines.\nTRU contends that it is not just the ransomware gangs that are causing the scourge, it is also\nthose cybercriminals who are supplying the malware, the infrastructure and the tools. For\nsome time, what appears to be their favorite weapon is Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike has\nrepeatedly enabled ransomware threat actors to disrupt critical healthcare services,\nmunicipalities, educational institutions, energy companies, and international meat suppliers.\n\n[For the past year and half, Cobalt Strike (a threat emulation software used for adversary](https://www.helpsystems.com/product-lines/cobalt-strike)\nsimulations and Red Teams) has been observed being used by the top ransomware gangs\nand financial cybercrime groups. Cobalt Strike is an organized, methodical and multifunctional software that is being used, unfortunately, in conjunction with ransomware to\ndisrupt critical systems. It is readily delivered by numerous initial access vectors and\nprovides a variety of tools that help threat actors navigate around defenses.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Burning a Conti Affiliate s Cobalt Strike Infrastructure\n\nTRU has been tracking the operations of an active Conti ransomware affiliate since August\n2021. During TRU’s research, it discovered that cybersecurity company BreakPoint Labs\n(BPL) had also been studying the same Conti affiliate. Therefore, eSentire and BreakPoint\nLabs began sharing their findings with one another and uncovered some important details\nrelating to this affiliate, its infrastructure management methods, and its use of Cobalt Strike. It\n[is also important to note that the main Conti operators have recently brought the Trickbot](https://www.securityweek.com/conti-ransomware-acquires-trickbot-it-thrives-amid-crackdowns)\nauthors, Wizard Spider, into their operation. Members of the Trickbot gang are long time\npartners of Conti,and they have recently developed BazarLoader which downloads\nadditional malware onto a victim’s computer.\n\nInterestingly, TRU observed this affiliate’s Cobalt Strike infrastructure being leveraged in two\nsubsequent ransomware attempts on Valentine’s Day of 2022, just as the tensions between\nRussia and Ukraine were escalating.\n\nThe speed and efficacy of both the intrusion actions and the infrastructure management\nindicate automated, at-scale deployment of customized Cobalt Strike configurations and its\nassociated initial access vectors. Customization choices include legitimate certificates, nonstandard CS ports, and malleable Command and Control (C2). In this report, we will examine\nassociated ransomware operations, including operations that rely on:\n\nSonicWall exploits\nShathak (TA551) and TR (TA577) malware distribution operations\nBazarLoader and IcedID malware\nThe Cobalt Strike intrusion framework\nFiveHands/HelloKitty/DeathKitty ransomware and Conti ransomware\n\nTRU observed sophisticated intrusions conducted from the infrastructure, which are detailed\nbelow, followed by an exploration of the features of the infrastructure. Finally, a list of\nindicators comprising the vast Cobalt Strike deployment are provided.\n\n## Cobalt Strike at Scale\n\nFollowing a series of leaks of the Cobalt Strike Intrusion Suite starting in 2020, the tool\nquickly rose to prominence in ransomware intrusions. Throughout 2021, eSentire’s TRU\nobserved that – with few exceptions – hands-on- intrusions invariably relied on Cobalt Strike\n[(Figure 2). The trend continues into 2022 alongside yet another leak of Cobalt Strike’s latest](https://mobile.twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1478761363489046529)\nversion. With each successive leak of the tool, threat actors gain additional features that help\n[them to evade security and manage intrusions at scale.](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/user-exploitation-at-scale/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Cobalt Strike observed by TRU in incidents (blue trace) and timing of Cobalt Strike_\n_source code leaks to the public (vertical black lines)_\n\n## Why has Cobalt Strike become so popular for ransomware campaigns?\n\nRansomware intrusions are full-scale organizational intrusions that require actions such as\n[discovery,](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) [lateral tool transfer and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570/) [privilege escalation (Figure 3). Not only can Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)\n[do all of that, it can also change up its disguises using malleable C2 and an artifact kit to](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/)\nevade network and endpoint security. Threat actors need only deliver Cobalt Strike’s Beacon\n– a highly configurable backdoor that allows attackers to quietly and remotely control\n[endpoints and inject other attacker tools – as a payload of their chosen initial access vector,](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)\nand Beacon will point back to an attacker – controlled Team Server, where attackers can log\non and intrusions can be orchestrated. Due to Cobalt Strike’s relative simplicity, it enables\nlower-tiered threat actors to act in supporting roles to ransomware operations, allowing for\nransomware gangs to scale out their operations and increase efficiencies.\n\nIn short, the tool puts most of the features you’d find in other malware in one place. MITRE\n[describes the tool as follows: “Cobalt Strike’s interactive post-exploit capabilities cover the](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\nfull range of ATT&CK tactics, all executed within a single, integrated system.” Cobalt Strike\nhas been in use and continuously updated with new functionality for at least the past ten\nyears. It is an “adversarial simulation software,” the developers (have continuously added\n[evasive features, observed in the wild, to its pen testing capabilities). Cobalt Strike also has](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/)\n[a public community that openly shares aggressor scripts, which allow various plugins and](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/AggressorScripts)\n[integrations to be written for Cobalt Strike, and Beacon profiles, which define various](https://github.com/xx0hcd/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/template.profile)\ncommunication protocols for C2. Thus, for many backdoors and RATs available on the\nunderground market, Cobalt Strike is capable of the same functionality, plus more.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: In the simplified kill chain model, Cobalt Strike can directly perform most intrusion_\n_actions allowing the operation to efficiently achieve their objectives_\n\n## Ransomware Operations Utilizing the Cobalt Strike Infrastructure\n\nTRU observed at least two cybercrime operations utilizing the same Cobalt Strike\ninfrastructure, during 2021 and into 2022, and both operations are leveraging SonicWall\n[exploits to deploy a Go variant of the FiveHands/HelloKitty/DeathKitty ransomware family](https://breakpoint-labs.com/blog/cobalt-strike-and-ransomware-tracking-an-effective-ransomware-campaign/)\nand they are also employing initial access brokers, associated with the Conti Ransomware\noperation. Earlier in the year, SonicWall exploits being used in FiveHands ransomware\n[campaigns (Figure 4), were associated with FiveHands affiliate UNC2447. A 2021 report by](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2447-sombrat-and-fivehands-ransomware-sophisticated-financial-threat)\nMandiant notes the group had previously deployed RagnarLocker. Symantec has since\n[associated UNC2447 with recent campaigns deploying Yanluowang Ransomware.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/yanluowang-ransomware-attacks-continue)\n\n_Figure 4: A campaign utilizing SonicWall exploits leveraged the tracked Cobalt Strike_\n_infrastructure to deliver a Golang variant of the FiveHands Ransomware_\n\nMore recently, the same Cobalt Strike infrastructure was observed being leveraged in Conti\nransomware deployments via Shathak (aka TA551) for initial access (Figure 5). Shathak is a\nthreat group known for launching phishing campaigns that typically utilize malicious\ndocuments, and these often lead to backdoors, such as IcedID. TRU has seen some overlap\n\n\n-----\n\nin these campaigns with the TR botnet (aka TA577), which delivers payloads via malicious\n[documents and which tends to use the same toolset as the Shathak malicious phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware)\ncampaigns.\n\n_Figure 5: An operation by the Shathak Group (akaTA551) leveraged BazarLoader through_\n_malicious emails. BazarLoader allowed the operation to pivot to the tracked Cobalt Strike_\n_infrastructure for Conti deployment._\n\n## Syndicate Infrastructure\n\nManagement of the Cobalt Strike infrastructure appears to be highly automated, potentially\n[relying on automated name server generation via reseller API. Legitimate and trusted](https://manage.resellerclub.com/kb/node/601)\ncertificates are deployed to the infrastructure within minutes of domain name creation.\n[Domain names used for Cobalt Strike Command and Control (C2) reflect a common naming](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/)\nscheme, typically two to three words or acronyms that reflect common information\ntechnology and known brands. The infrastructure rotates through a consistent range of open\nports and registrar choices (Figure 6). TRU’s analysis of the Conti chat leaks provides some\ninsight on infrastructure management within the Conti team, but it’s not clear how entwined\nthe domains tracked here are with this core Conti group. However, the primary candidates\n[from the leaked chats would be Carter’s infrastructure through which Bentley’s builds](https://github.com/hversu/conti_leaks/blob/main/carters_infra)\nintegrate the different tools and malware involved (such as BazarLoader, Cobalt Strike and\nthe ransomware itself). An excerpt of the domain names, IP addresses and email addresses\nbeing used by this Conti affiliate are enclosed below. It appears that this Cobalt Strike\ninfrastructure management group has also relied on a variety of ProtonMail email addresses\nto register some of their domains:\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f899949d8099969c9d8aa79f978b909d8eb8888a978c979695999194d69b9795)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e4d6158586156514d4a5b4c7e4e4c514a5150535f5752105d5153)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80e2e1f2f4efeceeedc0f0f2eff4efeeede1e9ecaee3efed)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a091b161b17130e3a0a08150e1514171b131654191517)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1f797e7d6d766c40727a717a717b7a6c5f6f6d706b7071727e7673317c7072)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#432b2c30372631240333312c372c2d2e222a2f6d202c2e)\n\n\n-----\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#32455d4059565d575c57457242405d465d5c5f535b5e1c515d5f)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#13677b7a607a60727f707c7b7c7f5363617c677c7d7e727a7f3d707c7e)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cedfef8f9fed3ebfee5eeedf9ffe7ede5f8e9ccfcfee3f8e3e2e1ede5e0a2efe3e1)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89e8e5ecf1d6e4e8eee6e4ecede6efefc9f9fbe6fde6e7e4e8e0e5a7eae6e4)\n\n## Excerpt of the Cobalt Strike C2 Domain Names and IP Addresses Utilized by a Conti Affiliate\n\nfirmwareupdater[.]com\n\naspdotnetpro[.]com\n\nfortinetdirect[.]com\n\nintergroupservices[.]com\n\nthumbsupdating[.]com\n\nestudiopay[.]com\n\nappnewrelease[.]com\n\ngpupdatemanager[.]com\n\nflashpointdatabase[.]com\n\nwirelesswebaccess[.]com\n\nwebdatabasesystem[.]com\n\n46[.]21[.]153[.]52\n\n23[.]227[.]196[.]236\n\n146[.]70[.]44[.]201\n\n198[.]252[.]99[.]99\n\n172[.]96[.]186[.]51\n\n23[.]227[.]202[.]142\n\n23[.]227[.]198[.]235\n\n46[.]21[.]153[.]48\n\n23[.]227[.]198[.]211\n\n23[.]227[.]196[.]58\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Ports and Registrars observed at time of domain creation_\n\n## Sophisticated Intrusions\n\nCombined, TRU and BPL observed the Cobalt Strike infrastructure being leveraged to attack\nseven different U.S. companies between 2021 and 2022. The victims include companies in\nthe financial, environmental, legal and charitable sectors.\n\nIn July 2021, the threat actors behind the Cobalt Strike operation compromised four different\nfinancial organizations via one technology provider, which each of the victims were using to\nmanage their IT environments. Since the technology provider deployed SonicWall as a VPN\nsolution for its customers, the financial organizations were rendered vulnerable to the\npreviously mentioned exploits. In these cases, the threat actors were able to delete cloudstored backups prior to ransomware deployment. Luckily, the financial companies had other,\nmore recent backups, to restore from – a good lesson to follow. The ransomware was later\n[determined to be the late Go Version of Feral Spider and shared similarities to previous](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-ransomware-variant-uses-golang-packer/)\nFiveHands and HelloKitty variants.\n\nMore recently, on Valentine’s Day 2022, amidst escalating tensions between Russia and\nUkraine, the TRU intercepted an attack leveraging the Cobalt Strike infrastructure in which\nthe threat actors were trying to breach a children’s charity and, hours later, they attempted to\nbreach a legal firm. However, one attack stands out as a demonstration of the power and\ncapability of the Cobalt Strike Intrusion Suite, should it land in the wrong hands: the\n**ShadowBeacon Incident.**\n\n## The Cobalt Strike ShadowBeacon Incident\n\n\n-----\n\nThe TRU observed the first Cobalt Strike Beacon early in the morning during the summer of\n2021. The Beacon instance presented an immediate mystery – it pointed to an internal\ndevice. The infected host was isolated and an investigation into the source of the signal was\nopened; another Beacon appeared. Again, a host was isolated. The Beacons were being\n[deployed from the domain controllers via PsExec, a legitimate administrator tool used for](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029/)\nremotely executing binaries. This time; however, the internal IP was different. Sensing an\nactive hands-on intrusion, TRU began manually deleting the Beacon instances just as\neSentire’s incident handlers were finding an answer to the shifting Command and Control\n[channel. The intruders were using Forty North’s C2Concealer. The Beacons were](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/C2concealer) SMB\nBeacons, which utilize the organization’s internal SMB traffic for its C2. That meant that the\ncloaked internal device likely had an HTTP Beacon–through which it was funneling the traffic\nfrom SMB Beacons to the exterior Cobalt Strike C2 Server. The more common Beacon\nutilizes standard internet protocols.\n\nTo gain further intelligence around the mysterious internal device required a review of the\nWindows logs. Given that the customer wasn’t ingesting their log signals into eSentire’s Atlas\n[XDR platform, a manual request for logs was initiated, introducing a delay to the](https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/esentire-atlas-xdr-investigator)\ninvestigation. With domain control and a cloaked machine, the attacker continued to deploy\nSMB beacons, struggling to maintain a foothold as incident handlers continued to shut down\nBeacon instances. But after receiving and manually reviewing the Windows logs, TRU\ndiscovered the intersection of the SMB traffic and patient zero.\n\n### Crafty Threat Actors Bring Their Own Virtual Machine\n\nThe Windows logs revealed that the threat actor had been able to register their own virtual\nmachine on the victim organization’s network, using it as a pivot to their actual, exterior C2.\nWith the source of the infection no longer hiding in the VPN pool, the attacker was kicked out\nand the recovery process started. No ransomware was observed.\n\n## Cobalt Strike Infrastructure-Campaign Links\n\n### Conti Playbook and Intrusion Tools Used in the ShadowBeacon Incident\n\nThe recent [leak of a Conti message board provides a thorough set of tools and practices](https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks/status/1498578979925774336)\nused by Conti.
