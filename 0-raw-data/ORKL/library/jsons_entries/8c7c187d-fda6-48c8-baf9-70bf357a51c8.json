Based on the threat situation, which we have updated once again this year, we have taken a more detailed look at a  topic that is currently of particular concern to the security community within Swisscom, to our partners and customers, but also internationally: APTs.\n\n\nAdvanced persistent threats (APTs) involve attackers\nwith a large amount of resources attacking a clearly\ndefined target to obtain specific information or\ncause lasting damage. To explain the relevance of this\nadversary type we have compared APTs to other threat\nactors such as cyber criminals, terrorists and hacktivists.\nWhat sets APTs apart from other actors?\n\nWhereas criminals take the path of least resistance to\ngenerate as much profit as possible, both terrorists\nand hacktivists use attacks for publicity but have few\nresources and little know-how, APTs proceed much more\nsubtly. The target is selected carefully and monitored\nover months or even years. Seemingly boundless\nresources are used to build up know-how and develop\nsuitable tools. In addition, great care is taken to maintain\nthe outmost secrecy, during and after the attack so\nthat neither the attacker nor the target can be discovered\ntoo soon.\n\n\nThe report describes attackers’ motivations and their\nresources. Based on data collected and evaluated by\nSwisscom, it shows which methods and tools attackers use most frequently. We will also highlight which\ncountermeasures are particularly effective and which\ncountermeasures offer the best detection capabilities.\n\nWe are very pleased that we were able to win Costin Raiu\nfrom Kaspersky’s GReAT for an introductory interview.\nCostin is a world-renowned expert in the field of APTs\nwho was happy to share his knowledge with us.\n\nThis report is a joint work between different departments within Swisscom.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### Threats arise out of the constant development of new technologies and their application and spread across society.\n\nPotential threats must be detected at an early stage and documented systematically. To illustrate the threat\nsituation and its evolution, we use the familiar radar to which we have already referred in previous publications\nof of Swisscom’s Cyber Security Report.\n\n###### Dominant Players\n\n**Observation**\n\n###### Environment/Social Technology Dynamics\n\n\nAll IP\n\n\nPolitical Influence\n\n\n###### Proliferation\n\n_Threat Radar_\n\n\nDigitalisation\n\n\n###### Physical Organisation\n\n\nDigital\n\n\n###### Cyber goes Physical\n\nToday   Trend\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Methodology\n\nThe threat radar is broken down into seven segments\nthat differentiate between the various threat domains.\nThe threats belonging to each of these segments will\nbe assigned to one of four concentric rings. These rings\nindicate a threat’s actuality and thus also our estimation\nof probability in assessing such threats. The closer the\nthreat is to the centre of the circle, the more relevant is\nthe threat and more important is it, to take appropriate\ncountermeasures.\n\n\n\n- **Main topics: Threats that are detected still rarely and**\nare countered with a normal deployment of resources.\nOften, defined processes already exist to efficiently\ndefend against these threats.\n\n- **Early detection: Threats that have not yet been carried**\nout or whose impact is currently very small. Projects\nhave been launched with the goal of addressing the\ngrowing significance of these threats at an early stage.\n\n\nWe refer to the rings as:\n\n- **Urgent issues: Threats that are being executed wide**\nspread and are binding large amounts of resources.\n\n\n\n- **Observation: Threats that may occur in the next years.**\nNo concrete measures have been defined for handling\nthese threats.\n\nMoreover, the individual threats indicated by the aforementioned points show a trend which may be of increasing, decreasing or stable criticality. The length of the\ntrend beam indicates how swiftly the threat’s criticality\nis expected to change.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Threats\n\nThe following is a brief description of the\nseven segments of the threat radar.\n\n\n**Dominant**\n**Players**\n\n\n**Technology**\n**Dynamics**\n\n\nThis segment covers threats arising through dependencies on dominant manufacturers,\nservices or protocols.\n\nUrgent issues _Infrastructure Integrity: Key components of critical infrastructure may_\nhave had vulnerabilities built into them, whether through negligence or\nmaliciously, which endanger the security of the system.\n\nMain topics _Destabilising Centralisation: Strong centralisation in the structure_\nof the Internet leads to cluster risks. The breakdown of one service,\ne.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS), can have a global impact.\n\nThis term covers threats arising from the fast pace of technological innovation, which both\ncreates new threats itself and also offers attackers new avenues for attack.\n\nMain topics _Targeted Attacks: Targeted and complex attacks designed to reach a_\nspecific goal. This threat type is explained in greater detail in later sections\nof this report.\n_All IP: The nationwide rollout of All IP also increases the risks associated_\nwith VoIP technology.\n_5G Security: 5G is still a young technology and its launch will not only offer_\nmany new opportunities but will also open the door to unknown threats.\n_Ransomware: Large amounts of critical data are encrypted and only_\n(possibly) decrypted in exchange for the payment of a ransom.\n\nEarly detection _Automation & Scaling: Greater automation of technical operations will_\nmean that the repercussions of successful attacks and misconfigurations\nwill be greater.\n_Increased Complexity: The complexity of systems, especially across_\ntechnological and corporate borders, is on the rise. This increases risk\nexposure and hampers troubleshooting.\n_Quantum Computing: Quantum computers can render existing crypto-_\ngraphic methods useless because they can crack them in no time.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cyber goes**\n**Physical**\n\n\nThis term covers attacks on infrastructure conducted from cyberspace, which will\nincreasingly cause damage in the physical world.\n\nMain topics _IoT Devices: Devices with weak protection could be compromised or_\nsabotaged. This could restrict their own functions, including their\navailability or data integrity.\n_SCADA: There are many technical control systems for critical infrastruc-_\nture, which are poorly protected and not well maintained.\n\n\n**Organisation**\n\n\nOrganisational threats arise through changes in the organisation or exploit weaknesses in\nan organisation.\n\nMain topics _Infrastructure Misconfiguration: Exploitation of misconfigured infra-_\nstructure components and vulnerabilities that are identified too late and\npatched late.\n_Workplace Diversity: Aside from the many opportunities that new working_\nmodels bring, an uncontrolled use of such models, e.g. “bring your own\ndevice” (BYOD) or the increased use of remote workplaces, exposes\ncompanies to greater risks.\n_Insider Threats: Partners or colleagues manipulate, misuse or sell_\ninformation, either through negligence or for malicious intent.\n_Decentralised Development: Classic pure development departments_\ndisappear. Application development merges with the operations\ndepartments and move closer to the business units. Release cycles are\ngetting shorter.\n\n\n**Physical**\n\n\nThreats that arise from the physical environment that are generally more focused on\nphysical targets.\n\nMain topics _Device Theft: The theft of devices – especially critical infrastructure_\ncomponents and, increasingly, IoT Devices – may result in a loss of data or\nimpair service availability.\n_Drones and Robots: Reconnaissance and attacks over longer distances will_\nbecome easier and cheaper.\n\n\nObservation _3D Printing: Improvements in the quality of 3D printers will make it_\ncheaper and easier to create e.g. keys and other physical devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Proliferation**\n\n\n**Environmental/**\n**Social**\n\n\nThreats that benefit from ever easier and cheaper access to IT media and know-how\nare known as proliferation threats, because this creates new potential ways of attack:\nIt also increases the availability of tools that can be used for attacks.\n\nMain topics _Subscriber Compromisation: Malware attacks mobile users’ private data or_\nis used to attack telecommunication or IT infrastructure.\n\nEarly recognition _IoT-Based DDoS: Strong growth in the number of IoT Devices coupled with_\nlow-level protection creates more “takeover candidates” for botnets.\n_Digitalisation: The growing interaction between the virtual and real world_\nas also private and corporate environments create new ways of attacks.\n\nThis covers threats that arise out of socio-political change or which are either facilitated or\nbecome more valuable to attackers.\n\nUrgent issue _Security job market: Great difficulties of meeting the demand for security_\nprofessionals mean that not enough expertise is available to counter the\nincreasingly complex and intelligent attacks.\n\nMain topics _Digital Identity: Trusted personal digital identities may be misused or_\nstolen, e.g. to conclude contracts under the names of others.\n\nEarly detection _AI/Analytics: More data and better analytical models provided by AI can_\nbe misused to influence people’s behaviour. Decisions are increasingly left\nto autonomous systems.\n_Political Influence: Political trends can influence technological or economic_\ndecisions, e.g. in the selection of technology suppliers. This can create\nnew risks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nThe threat situation remains complex. Attackers are\nprofiting from the increasing value of virtual assets,\nwhich thus further motivates them to launch a targeted attack. In addition, technological innovations and\nthe convergence of the physical and virtual worlds are\ncreating new opportunities for attacks. However, it also\nshows that no specific threat is developing, but rather\nthat threats are subject to fluctuations and trends.\n\n\nCompared to last year’s picture, we can say that\nthe threat situation has remained stable. Although\nsome threats, such as Infrastructure Misconfiguration\nand Workplace Diversity, have declined this year,\nmost still exist and are changing only minimally.\n\nFor both declining threats, we attribute the “relief” not\nto falling interest by potential attackers, but rather to\nthe increased maturity of the affected infrastructures.\nWorkplace diversity, for example, is actively being\nmanaged at more and more companies, mobile device\nmanagement (MDM) tools are being used and directives\nfor the use of “bring your own device” (BYOD) are\nbeing developed and implemented.\n\n\nThreats via SCADA (industrial control) systems and\n_IoT (Internet of Things) Devices remain in the main focus,_\nbut we do not see any short-term changes. IoT penetration is not yet high enough to further exacerbate the\nthreat situation.\n\nDrones, on the other hand, are currently becoming more\nwidespread, with the associated negative consequences,\nsome of which have also been reported in the media.\nFor this reason, we currently see a strong trend towards\na worsening threat situation.\n\n\n#### The threat situation remains  complex. Attackers are profiting from the increasing value of  virtual assets, which thus further motivates them to launch a  targeted attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were given the opportunity to ask Costin Raiu six questions about APTs and to benefit from\nhis experiences and observations as an expert on the subject.\n\n###### 1. Costin Raiu, what are the primary characteristics that make up an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\n\n\nIn our opinion, this is what makes a malware or attack advanced:\n\n- the usage of a zero-day exploit as seen with Sofacy, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm\nor FancyBear. This is probably a champion among all when it comes to the number of\ndiscovered zero-days.\n\n- a highly complex, modular platform to carry out various functions such as Regin and\nProjectSauron.\n\n- The usage of sophisticated techniques for infection, persistence or exfiltration.\nFor instance, RedOctober used a very clever persistence mechanism in the form of\nan Office and Adobe Reader plugin, which has the ability to execute code hidden in\nspecially constructed documents; this also includes various bootkit techniques.\n\n\nOther characteristics are Slow replication, coupled with network level persistence, Infection of\n_pro-level network hardware such as core routers and supply chain attacks._\n\nGood examples of how those attacks have been performed are Duqu2, SYNful Knock or\nShadowpad and CCleaner compromise.\n\n\nThis list is non-conclusive. Other examples are attacks on hardware features, infection of\nthe BIOS, destructive attacks against hardware with Stuxnet as a prominent example or\nmulti-platform malware.\n\n###### 2. What are the most significant changes in APT activity that you are observing and what areas are primarily affected by these changes?\n\n\nWe are tracking over 100 APT groups and operations at the moment. We started tracking\nAPT groups on a regular basis in 2010, after the story of Stuxnet, and when it became clear\nthis was a trend, we decided to continue. Since we reached knowledge about 100 APT groups\nand operations in 2015, around the same time we launched our private APT reporting service.\n\nWe also observe more and more APT groups engaging in fileless attacks. This makes it more\ndifficult to detect infections, as no malicious files can be found in the system. Additionally,\nwe are seeing an increasing number of groups adopting public tools such as Empire Powershell, Metasploit, Cobalt Strike or Mimikatz. It makes it difficult to distinguish between them.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. What was the most interesting APT that you have analysed?\n\nProbably Duqu2. First of all, we thought Duqu2 was special because it was used to target\nKaspersky Lab. The idea of an APT targeting a security company is a pretty bold one, because\nit’s impossible to assume the intrusion will not be detected. Secondly, Duqu2 was rather\nspecial in the sense it was a memory-only threat, which, while running, existed only in the\nmemory of several computer systems, without artifacts on disks. This complicated its\ndetection a lot. Finally, the usage of a zero day in Windows to bypass Kaspersky products\nseemed quite interesting and resulted in several product improvements to detect such\nbehavior in the future.\n\n\n###### 4. What are typical mistakes organisations do in order to be prepared for an APT attack and how they respond to an APT?\n\nMost organisations focus on preventing an external attacker from getting access to internal\nresources, but few take measures to detect an attacker once he/she has access to the internal network. As I know from our research, attackers spend most of their time with lateral\nmovement and exfiltration. So the organisations should focus on this phases. Also, lack to\nimplement the Australian DSD TOP35[1] mitigation measures against APTs.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 5. What are the typical mistakes attackers do during their operations? Where do you see organisations getting an advantage over their  adversaries?\n\nOften, we recognise Opsec mistakes such as VPN fails, forgotten PDB paths in binaries or\ncompilation timestamps.\n\n###### 6. What are the most important capabilities to have to be prepared  for APT large-scale intrusions?\n\nFor companies, it is essential to have access to private threat intelligence, having a fully\noperational Security Operation Center, implementing network filtering and a detection of\nlateral movement and exfiltration mechanism. Also, organisations should know and\ndeeply understand how attackers work. For example, which tools they use and how they\noperate during the attack phases. Most of them use Mimikatz, Powershell and Webshells.\n\n\n###### About Costin Raiu\n\nCostin Raiu specialises in the analysis of advanced\npersistent threats (APTs) and complex malware\nattacks. He leads the Global Research and Analysis\nTeam (GReAT) at Kaspersky, which investigated\nthe Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame and EquationGroup\noperations, among others. Costin has more than\n19 years’ experience in antivirus technology and\nsecurity research. He is a member of the Virus\nBulletin Technical Advisory Board, a member of\nthe Computer AntiVirus Researchers’ Organisation\n(CARO) and a reporter for the Wildlist Organisation\nInternational. Prior to joining Kaspersky Lab, Costin\nworked for GeCad as chief researcher and was a\ndata security expert for the RAV antivirus development group.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### Depending on the threat actor,  the mission or strategic goal  of an attack will have completely  different intentions, and threat  actors have a wide range of  ways to put them into practice.\n\n\nThe media often report that companies have been\ninfected with a specific type of malware or that a specific type of malware has been used to steal a company’s\ndata. To understand targeted attacks, we must be\naware that it is not the malware that is carrying out\nthe attacks, but that businesses are being attacked by\npeople. These are often referred to in the cyber community as threat actors or cyber operators and are the\nmain component behind such attacks. The threat actors\nbehind targeted attacks do not carry out these attacks\nindiscriminately, but have a strategic goal, a wide variety\nof motivations and diversified approaches, which serve\nas additional components of a targeted attack and are\ndetected as it progresses.\n\n\n##### The Threat Actor Landscape\n\nDepending on the threat actor, the mission or strategic\ngoal of an attack will have completely different intentions, and threat actors have a wide range of ways to put\nthem into practice. For better orientation and to assess\nthe potential and motivation of different threat actors,\nwe divide them into the following groups:\n\n**Targeted attacks by advanced persistent threats**\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs) constitute the top\ntier of cyber threat actors. Targeted attacks by an APT\nare conducted based on a mission that aims to gain a\nstrategic advantage in order to achieve political ends or\npositively influence technology developments. In this\ncontext, an APT is assumed to be a government or an\nentity that acts on a government’s behalf. The special\nfeature of an APT is that the attacks associated with\nit are considered “state-sponsored,” which explicitly\nmeans that the threat actors are condoned by the state\nand thus represent “legal” (or at least state-protected)\nhackers. State legality, difficult traceability and relatively\nrisk-free implementation have led more and more states\nto expand their cyber capabilities and APT attacks.[2]\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to such “legal” APTs, there is another\nfringe group that can be seen as pioneers of states/\ngovernments that have not yet developed the capabilities to carry out advanced attacks such as those of an\nAPT themselves. At the latest since the hacking team\nrevelations of hacktivist Phineas Phisher, it has become\nclear that this fringe group pursues clear financial and\nstrategic goals.[3]\n\n**Targeted attacks by cybercriminals**\n\n\nCybercriminals are primarily opportunistic and use all of\ntheir available capabilities (e.g. a published exploitation\nof a Microsoft Office vulnerability) against a wide range\nof targets. Whenever they receive a capability, they use\nit against many opportunistic targets to profit from as\nmany attacks as possible. In addition to opportunistic\nattacks, there are also targeted and well-organised cyber\ncriminal attacks that aim at stealing large amounts of\ndata or other assets from a defined target through a\nsingle attack and turn this into money. For this attack,\nthe actors typically need to spend a significant amount\nof time inside of the target network. Such organised\ncriminals are often just as technically skilled as many\nAPTs. However, the decisive difference lies in the threat\nactors’ strategic objectives.\n\n\n**Targeted attacks by terrorists**\n\nWhereas fear is widespread among the general public\nthat terrorists will attack critical systems, not a single\ncase has been reported thus far in which terrorists have\npursued and achieved their strategic goals through\ntargeted cyberattacks. In fact, the Cambridge Centre for\nRisk Studies knows of no non-state terrorist group that\nhas developed the ability to carry out advanced, targeted\ncyberattacks which could cause physical damage.[4] At the\nsame time, the 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment by\nthe US intelligence community concludes that terrorists\nprimarily use cyberspace for media purposes.[5]\n\n\nHacktivists typically carry out targeted attacks for\npolitical motives as a form of protest. They congregate\nglobally in groups of like-minded individuals in order to\ncoordinate and carry out attacks. Alternatively, they may\ncarry out attacks on their own. The skills of hacktivists\nvary greatly. The aim is to reach the chosen strategic goal\nas quickly as possible and attract a lot of media attention. So far, it has been noted that these threat actors\nprimarily perform smash-and-grab operations in order to\npublicise their success as quickly as possible.\n\n\nWe still assume that cyber terrorism remains a threat\nand will play a greater role in the future.\n\n**Targeted attacks by hacktivists**\n\n\n3 https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/how-hacking-team-got-hacked-phineas-phisher/\n\n4 https //www jbs cam ac uk/fileadmin/user upload/research/centres/risk/downloads/180620 slides evan pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Targeting \n\nThe targets of targeted attacks are not chosen\nrandomly, but based on the specific relationship\nbetween the target and the adversary.\n\n**Targets of Interest**\n\nThe more a target satisfies the needs of an adversary the\nmore it becomes a Target of Interest (TOI). The primary\naspects describing a TOI are the unique ability to satisfy\nthe need of the adversary, the required effort and cost\nassociated with conducting the attack, as well as the\nrisks it may pose to the attackers.\n\n\n**Targets of Opportunity**\n\nA Target of Opportunity (TOO) is of secondary importance. Such targets meet a threat actor’s subordinate\nneeds and might be attacked as a bridge to the actual\nTarget of Interest. However, it is also possible that the\ntarget was compromised because it was vulnerable\nto a particular exploit at a specific moment in time.\nThe Target of Opportunity can also become the Target\nof Interest if the threat actors later discover that the\nvictim is of higher value than initially concluded.\n\n\n#### The more a target satisfies the needs of an adversary the more it becomes a Target of Interest (TOI).\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThere are many ways to describe a cyberattack. We have\nchosen the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is based\non data from attacks that have been observed in real\nworld intrusions. ATT&CK is similar to the cyber kill chain[7]\nmethod for describing cyberattacks[8]. Whereas the cyber\nkill chain provides more of a helicopter perspective, the\nATT&CK framework details the activities of more than\n80 threat actors (groups). ATT&CK primarily contains the\nactivities of advanced persistent threats in the different\nattack phases, described on the basis of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)[9] of these threat actors.\n\n**In January 2019, ATT&CK included**\n\n## 80 11\n\n**threat actors** **attack phases**\n**(groups)** **(tactics)**\n\nThe following sections describe what we believe are\nthe most important high-level findings from the\nATT&CK framework, with a clear focus on Advanced\nPersistent Threats.\n\n\nOur analysis of the data was carried out over a period\nof several weeks via ATT&CK Enterprise[10] (hereinafter\nreferred to as “ATT&CK”), the last access being in January\n2019. ATT&CK is continuously extended and updated.\nHowever, the data gathered by the framework and\nthe experiences of Costin Raiu’s GReAT team enable us\nto do very precise evaluations in terms of quality\nand quantity.\n\n## 224 328\n\n**techniques** **software**\n\n\n7 https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html\n\n8 https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/mitre-attack-design-and-philosophy\n\n9 https //apps dtic mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1004650 pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Attack Phases\n\nATT&CK considers tactics to be the different stages of\nan attack that a threat actor works through to achieve\nhis strategic goal. In this context, we also speak of\ntactical goals. ATT&CK defines the following tactics:\n\n\n**Initial Access**\n\n\nThe initial access phase is the starting point for all the subsequent phases of an attack. It includes\nthe initial contact with the attack target and compromising the so-called “patient zero.”\n\nPersistence points within the target network ensure ongoing access to the compromised network. The more important the target is to the adversary, the more effort is put into persistence\npoints for long-time access to the network.\n\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\n**Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\n\nThe escalation of privileges is often needed to install malware or persistence points. Increased\nprivileges are sometimes also required to be able to spread to other systems or gain access to the\nstrategic goals (e.g. data).\n\nExploration within the target network is required to locate systems, users and data relevant\nto the mission.\n\n\n**Discovery**\n\n\n**Lateral**\n**Movement**\n\n\nThis refers to moving across a network to the relevant data for the mission. This is often\naccompanied by the execution phase and the installation of further persistence points.\n\nThe relevant data is collected.\n\n\n**Collection**\n\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n\nThis is the final phase required to successfully complete the mission and involves\nexfiltrating the relevant data.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following phases run in parallel to these phases,\ndepending on the successful achievement of the\nobjectives of the respective phases:\n\n\n**Execution**\n\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\n\n**Credential Access**\n\n\nThe execution of malicious code on a local or remote system primarily takes place in the initial\naccess and lateral movement phases. The next phase cannot be reached without execution\nof code controlled by the attacker. Execution is thus one of the most important prerequisites for\nthe further development of the attack and for spreading across the target network.\n\nBypassing defense and detection mechanisms, e.g. by turning off the firewall at the endpoint or\ndeleting log data, is one of the tactical goals that threat actors use in every other phase of their\nmission to either conceal their presence or bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nValid credentials play a key role for attackers. Firstly, it enables access to systems with legitimate\ncredentials and lateral movement within the target network. Secondly, it grants access to the\ndata that the attackers want. Furthermore, reusing credentials enables attackers to conduct an\nattack using few resources because no exploits have to be written, acquired or employed in any\nother way.\n\nThe command & control channel is the attacker’s means of communication to keep the\ncompromised target infrastructure under his control. If the attacker loses this channel, the attack\nis literally stopped. As such attackers often establish multiple command & control channels to\nensure access.\n\n\n**Command &**\n**Control**\n\n\nThe following illustration shows the connections:\n\n**Initial** **Privilege** **Lateral** **Mission**\n**Persistence** **Discovery** **Collection** **Exfiltration**\n**Access** **Escalation** **Movement** **complete**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Threat Actors’ Techniques\n\nIn order to reach or complete a specific phase, the threat\nactors in the ATT&CK framework[11] use a wide variety\nof techniques. Each phase can contain several techniques\n\n\nand each technique can be used within more than one phase.\nATT&CK contains 224 of these techniques, which are found\nin the various phases as follows:\n\n**59**\n\n\nDefense Evasion\n\nPersistence\n\n\n**56**\n\n\nExecution\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n\n**28**\n\n\n**31**\n\n\nCommand & Control\n\nCredential Access\n\n\n**21**\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n**20**\n\n**19**\n\n\nLateral Movement\n\nCollection\n\n\n**13**\n\n\n**17**\n\n\nInitial Access\n\nExfiltration\n\n\n**9**\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n\n**10**\n\n\nThe bar chart provides important insight into the modus\noperandi of threat actors and clearly shows the phases in\nwhich they posses the most capabilities. Looking at the\nphases in terms of the number of techniques present,\nthe analysis shows that threat actors have access to a\nvery broad range of approaches for outsmarting defense\nmechanisms in the different phases of the attack\nthrough defense evasion, and just as many approaches\navailable to guarantee them long-term access in the\npersistence phase.\n\n\nExtract from the interview with Costin Raiu,\nwhich also clarifies this statement:\n\n\n**What are the most important**\n**capabilities to have to be prepared for**\n**APT large-scale intrusions?**\n\nOrganisations should know and\ndeeply understand how attackers work.\n\n\nFor example, which tools they use\n(most of them use Mimikatz, Powershell,\nWebshells) and how they operate\nduring the attack phases.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Most-used techniques by threat actor**\nAn evaluation of the APT groups and their techniques\nshows a clear trend towards file-less attacks. This was\nalso confirmed by Costin Raiu.\n\nThe following illustration shows the ten most\nfrequently used techniques across the 80 threat actors\nwithin ATT&CK:\n\nScripting\n\nPowerShell\n\nCredential Dumping\n\nUser Execution\n\nObfuscated Files or Information\n\nSpearphishing Attachment\n\nRemote File Copy\n\nCommand-Line Interface\n\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\nStandard Application Layer Protocol\n\n\n**What are the most significant changes**\n**in APT activity that you are observing**\n**and what areas are primarily affected by**\n**these changes?**\n\nWe observe more and more APT groups\nengaging in fileless attacks.\n\nThis makes it more difficult to detect\ninfections, as no malicious files can be\nfound in the system.\n\n\n**23**\n\n\n**33**\n\n\n**30**\n\n\n**29**\n\n\n**28**\n\n\n**26**\n\n\n**25**\n\n**25**\n\n**25**\n\n**25**\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\n\n-----\n\nThe top ten approaches can be summarised under two themes: “Living off the land” and “Proven methods still work”.\n\n\n**Living off the land**\n\n**Proven methods**\n**still work**\n\n\nMore and more APT groups are relying on scripting languages that are now integrated as\nstandard in Windows operating systems, such as PowerShell and command-line interfaces,\nto execute their malicious code without being detected by application whitelisting solutions\nor leaving significant traces on the system.\n\nRegistry run keys and entries in the Windows start-up folder remain the most popular\npersistence mechanism technique among threat actors.\n\nNot all threat actors have the resources to develop zero-day exploits. Most of them continue\nto rely on spear phishing attachments and user execution to dupe users into executing\nmalicious code.\n\nAPT threat actors use simple ways to achieve their goals. Through Credential Dumping\nadversaries obtain valid credentials and use them to move laterally inside of the target\nnetwork and ensure long-term access.\n\n\nTo disguise their code, attackers still rely on Encodings and Encryptions and do use common\nprotocols like HTTP or DNS to blend into normal traffic where the majority is using remote\nfile copy methods to transfer their malicious software.\n\n##### Threat Actors’ Software\n\n\nSoftware implements techniques required by threat actors to successfully run through a specific tactic. For this,\nthey use a wide variety of software categories that represent either a tool, utility or malware within ATT&CK.[12]\n\n\n-----\n\n**Most-used software by threat actor type**\nAn analysis of the APT groups and the software they\nuse shows that off-the-shelf tools and software already\nprovided by the operating system are used most\nfrequently. This observation matches Costin Raiu’s\nexperience.\n\nThe following illustration shows the ten most frequently\nused software types across the 80 threat actors within\nATT&CK:\n\nMimikatz\n\nPsExec\n\nNet\n\nPoisonIvy\n\n\n**What are the most significant**\n**changes in APT activity that you**\n**are observing and what areas**\n**are primarily affected by these**\n**changes?**\n\nWe are seeing more and more\ngroups adopting public tools such\nas Empire Powershell, Metasploit,\nCobalt Strike, Mimikatz, making\nit difficult to distinguish between\nthem.\n\n\n**22**\n\n\n**16**\n\n**16**\n\n\n**10**\n\n\nSysteminfo\n\nTasklist\n\nipconfig\n\nCobalt Strike\n\ncmd\n\nReg\n\nnetstat\n\nPlugX\n\n\n**8**\n\n**8**\n\n**7**\n\n**7**\n\n**7**\n\n**7**\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n\n**9**\n\n**9**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Countermeasures and  their Effects\n\nCountermeasures against targeted attacks build on\nstandard protection based on preventive measures such\nas applying current patches, implementing two-factor\nauthentication, connection to the internet only through\na proxy etc. These measures are sometimes sufficient to\nredirect the interest of non-state threat actors towards\nother targets.\n\n\nWe must therefore base our countermeasures on threat\nactors’ capabilities and techniques, which often ends\nin a head-to-head race and, given the many approaches\navailable, this appears extremely complex at first glance.\n\nHowever, on closer inspection, it’s clear that most\ntechniques and the employed software can be identified\nusing detection methods that track system activity.\n\n\nIn the previous sections, we looked at the basic aspects\nof threat actors, which are reflected in their intent\n(strategic goals), opportunity (attack surface) and capa­\nbility (techniques). These aspects must be taken into\naccount when developing appropriate, effective counter­\nmeasures. Probably the most effective defence would\nbe to eliminate the strategic goal (intent). Governments\nor companies that do not store data are not targeted by\ngovernmental threat actors who are engaging in espionage and want to benefit from stolen data. However,\nthis defence can only be employed rarely. If we look at\nthe available attack surface, it has increased rather than\ndecreased in size in recent years. Increasing digitalisation,\nthe storage of data in the cloud and everything-connected, always-on or IoT Devices are presenting an exorbitantly large attack surface for companies, society and\nindividuals.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Detection Methods with the most Coverage\n\nOur analysis shows that a majority of the procedures of\nthreat actors can be detected by monitoring process\nand file operations. These detection methods are the\nmost effective ones, to detect the attack patterns used\nwithin targeted attacks. This, too, tallies with what\nCostin Raiu said.\n\nThe following illustration of the top ten detection\nmethods underlines this once again:\n\nProcess Monitoring\n\nFile monitoring\n\nProcess command-line parameters\n\n\n**86**\n\n**82**\n\n\n**What are typical mistakes**\n**organisations do in order to be**\n**prepared for an APT attack and**\n**how they respond to an APT?**\n\nMost organisations focus on\npreventing an external attacker from\ngetting access to internal resources,\nbut few take measures to detect\nan attacker once he/she has access\nto the internal network.\n\n\n**149**\n\n\nAPI monitoring\n\nProcess use of network\n\nWindows Registry\n\nPacket capture\n\nAuthentication logs\n\nNetflow/Enclave netflow\n\nBinary file metadata\n\n\n**23**\n\n**17**\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n\n\n**36**\n\n**34**\n\n**34**\n\n**31**\n\n**28**\n\n\n-----\n\nDetection methods for process activities identify the majority of the existing procedures of threat actors.\nUser and network activity provide further context.\n\n\n**System activity**\n\n**User and network**\n**activity**\n\n\nThe execution of code controlled by threat actors is a prerequisite for achieving their\nstrategic goals. Monitoring processes, files and changes in the Windows registry is the\nmost effective detection method for tracing a threat actor’s intrusion pattern. Even though\nthis form of detection brings the greatest added value, very high data volumes and\nefforts for tuning are to be expected. Processes, network connections, file and registry\noperations must be fully understood.\n\nIn addition to monitoring system activity, network data and user authentication logs\nprovide additional insight into the adversaries intrusion pattern.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nTargeted attacks are becoming increasingly likely and\nthe currently available technological measures are often\ninsufficient for keeping pace with the abilities of professional cyber threat actors. For these reasons, Swisscom\nrelies on a risk-based security model that requires a high\nlevel of security awareness within the organisation by\nemployee training and involves the community in the security culture, e.g. through the Bug Bounty Programme[13],\nand fundamental preventive security measures e.g.\nwhitelisting and the patching of applications and\nrestricting of network traffic and e-mail attachments.\nPrevention is one important aspect, however this might\nultimately fail when faced by highly motivated threat actors. It is therefore necessary to be proactive, understand\nthreat actors’ tactics, techniques and procedures and incorporate any gained insight into the detection process.\nWe recommend simulating a targeted attack through\nred teaming exercises, conducting threat hunting and\nengage in sharing groups.\n\n\n##### Red teaming\n\nBecause attackers are always one step ahead, we\nhave become attackers ourselves. In 2015, Swisscom\ndecided to break new ground by becoming the first\nSwiss company to establish an official red team. The red\nteam consists of a small group of Swisscom employees\nwho carry out realistic attacks against Swisscom infrastructure and services. These are so called ethical\nhackers, i.e. hackers with good intentions who conduct\ntargeted attacks against Swisscom, though NOT\nagainst client applications or client data.\n\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\n- To identify vulnerabilities and their impact before\nothers do;\n\n- To test the blue team and thus help the company\ndevelop countermeasures and improve processes;\n\n- To learn from incidents at other companies and test\nwhether they could occur also at Swisscom.\n\n\n#### Targeted attacks are becoming  increasingly likely and the currently available technological measures  are often insufficient for keeping pace with the abilities of professional cyber threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Threat hunting\n\nThreat hunting aims to detect previously undetected\nthreats. It is not a replacement for a functioning Security\nOperations Center (SOC), but uses partly automated,\nand even manual methods for detecting attack behaviour and patterns that could not be detected by\nexisting security mechanisms. This approach supplies\nnew detection methods, for example. Swisscom CSIRT\nregularly conducts threat-hunting sessions to identify\nthreats within the Swisscom network. As part of this,\nthe ATT&CK Framework often serves as a reference to\nunderstand the tactics and techniques of the different\nthreat actors. In this context, CSIRT regularly publishes\nnew detection methods for SIGMA[14] and YARA[15] and\nmakes them accessible to the community. SIGMA is a\ngeneric and open signature format with which relevant\ndetection log data can be described once and which can\nbe used for a variety of SIEM and log systems. SIGMA\nis one of the few tools that can describe attacks with\nATT&CK tactics and techniques and makes detection directly useful for others. YARA enables you to create your\nown signatures and detection methods that can then be\nused for both files and memory scans. Swisscom CSIRT\nregularly creates YARA rules for attacker toolsets and\nshares these with public communities such as Florian\nRoth’s[16] signature base and other closed communities.\n\n14 https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/\n\n15 https://yara readthedocs org\n\n\nAs mentioned in the previous sections, we must accept\nthat attacks are carried out by people and not by\nsystems. Thererfore also people are needed to react to\nthem. Swisscom operates multiple Security Operations\nCenter (SOC) to be able to investigate possible activity by attackers in a systematic way. Swisscom CSIRT\nanalysts become active as soon as activity is detected\nwhich points to more targeted attacks on Swisscom’s IT\ninfrastructure.\n\n##### Sharing groups and  communities\n\nIn addition to sharing detected attacks based on SIGMA\nand YARA, Swisscom CSIRT and its staff are active members of many trust groups for operational cooperation\nin the daily work of CSIRTs, SOCs and threat intelligence\nteams. These trust groups are designed to bring together\npeople with similar problems in their everyday work\nand to simplify the exchange between them. Swisscom\nregularly provides these sharing groups and communities with information on current observations, risks and\nindicators of malware and attacks.\n\n**Comprehensive corporate protection thanks to**\n**early detection of and professional intervention in**\n**cybersecurity attacks – available as a service**\n\nToday, vast volumes of corporate and personal infor­\nmation are available on various data sources (networks,\napplications, end devices, social media, the cloud, darknet, etc.). As networking and digitalisation continue\nto grow, so has the complexity of the threats. Timely\ndetection of security-related incidents is essential.\n\nProfessional threat detection & response requires\nspecific processes, tools, many years’ experience and\nhighly specialised employees. It is therefore almost\nimpossible for individual companies to understand the\nconstantly changing cybersecurity attacks and react\naccordingly. Support is thus required from experienced\npartners. Swisscom has been successfully protecting its\nnetwork infrastructure, customer and product data as\nwell as itself against cyber threats for years. It uses this\n\n\n-----\n\nexperience to minimise cyber risks in collaboration with\nits customers. Good data visualisation facilitates the\nearly detection of potential security incidents. Timely\nanalysis and appropriate reaction to a security incident\nimproves the security level and the use of resources\nwithin the company.\n\nOur Threat Detection & Response service enables corporate customers to choose between four service variants\ndepending on how much cybersecurity support they\nwould like from Swisscom. Here is a short overview:\n\n\n**Security Analytics as a Service: A dashboard provides**\nthe customer with an overview of potential security\nincidents from defined log data of the company.\n\n**Security Operation Center (SOC) as a Service: In addition**\nto security analytics, customers receive analyses and\nconcrete recommendations for action as well as direct\naccess to specialists at Swisscom’s SOC. We have been\nproviding SOC services to Swiss companies both at home\nand abroad for more than ten years. Our SOC analysts\ncan interpret security events and incidents competently\nand quickly.\n\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nIn most cases, targeted attacks – especially those by\nAPTs with strategic governmental goals – cannot be\nprevented. The increasingly digitised world is attracting\nmore and more threat actors into cyberspace. We must\ntherefore accept the growing likelihood that we will\nbecome a target of interest or at least a target of opportunity at some point in time. Threat actors have a variety\nof approaches at their disposal in the different phases\nof an attack, for which they are increasingly employing\noff-the-shelf tools and living-off-the-land methods.\nAlthough APTs belong to the top tier of cyber threat\nactors, they do not develop zero-day exploits for\nevery operation. Rather, they use tried and tested\nmethods in which people remain an attractive target\nin order to bypass security mechanisms and activate\nmalicious code.\n\n\n**Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) as**\n**a Service: Swisscom experts can be called on to analyse**\nand tackle critical security incidents and lead the security\nincident management process. These experienced\nexperts help customers preserve evidence and communicate with their customers and partners.\n\n**Threat Intelligence as a Service: Customers are informed**\nproactively about the appearance of sensitive business\nand personal information of their company in public and\nclosed networks (e.g. the darknet).[17]\n\n\nIt is often claimed that attackers only need to succeed\nonce to get into a system. Our analysis shows that we\ncan make the opposite argument; namely that if we\ndevelop our detection measures in such a way that the\napproaches of threat actors can be detected, they\nneed make only one mistake in order to be recognised.\nFocussing on detecting execution – the execution phase\n– is a promising approach here. However, with APTs in\nparticular, the complete intrusion pattern should be\nunderstood before the attack is stopped.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
