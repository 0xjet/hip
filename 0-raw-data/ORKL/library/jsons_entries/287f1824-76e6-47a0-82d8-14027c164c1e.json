This blog will not rehash\nanalysis of the Lazarus malware sample or Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) as that has\nbeen previously covered in the X-Force blog post. This blog will focus on highlighting the\nopportunities for detection of the FudModule within the Lazarus sample analyzed by X-Force,\nas well as highlight a strategy of using telemetry stream health as a mode of detecting\nmalware designed to impair defenses through ETW tampering.\n\n## One Ring 0 To Rule Them All\n\nThe Lazarus FudModule begins with the installation of a Dell driver that is vulnerable to CVE2021-21551 which allows the malware to elevate privileges to a level where DKOM attacks\nare possible. This type of attack is referred to as a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD)\nattack. In a BYOVD attack, an attacker installs a driver that is vulnerable to an exploit that\nenables the attacker to cross the boundary from administrative access to ring 0 or kernel\n\n-----\n\nmode access. Ring 0 access enables the attacker to bypass or disable security technology\nand evade detection by security professionals by operating deeper within the operating\nsystem.\n\n## Can’t Hit What You Can’t See\n\nAs detailed in the X-Force blog, after obtaining kernel mode privileges the FudModule begins\ntargeting kernel structures to impair telemetry sources on the host by targeting Event Tracing\nfor Windows (ETW) registration handles. ETW registration handles are used to retrieve\nconfiguration information for a specific provider, the handle can test whether a provider is\nenabled for specific keywords or information levels. Additionally, ETW registration handles\nare used to call event tracing and logging functions for a specific provider. The FudModule\nleverages the nt!EtwRegister function to enumerate entries associated with the RegHandle\nparameter and then updates the value with NULL effectively disabling all system ETW\nproviders for all consuming applications, including those providers used by some antivirus\nand endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.\n\n## Dynamic Detection Opportunity Through Monitoring ETW Data Stream Health\n\nWhile the FudModule’s capability to tamper with ETW registration handles does enable it to\ncreate and operate within a blind spot for security tooling, this is not the first piece of\nmalware X-Force has encountered that tampers with data streams to avoid detection. To\nhandle these types of detection challenges, X-Force has developed a detection method\nfocused on identification of malicious activity by testing data stream health.\n\n_The following section will demonstrate a proof-of-concept ETW data stream monitor like X-_\n_Force’s using PowerShell and Symon so organizations can start considering a similar_\n_detection capability._\n\nThe FudModule’s attack against ETW registration handles may disable ETW monitoring\nproviders, but X-Force was not able to uncover evidence that the malware prevents new\nETW registration handles from being created and used. Defenders can leverage this\nopportunity to register a new ETW session to an existing security-related ETW provider,\ncreate test data, and compare the telemetry between the new ETW session and the existing\nETW session. Organizations can implement a similar strategy to detect when there is a\ndiscrepancy between the telemetry registered in the data source and raise an alarm\nregarding security-related ETW data stream health when a discrepancy is observed.\n\nWhen Microsoft deployed PatchGuard in the early 2000s, it limited the ability for security\nvendors to hook the kernel directly to detect malware executing on a system. Since the\nintroduction of PatchGuard, vendors have leveraged Kernel callback functions to monitor\n\n\n-----\n\nactivities on a system. For a comprehensive list of Kernel callback functions here, see the\n[Kernel CallbackFunctions list created by CodeMachine here.](https://codemachine.com/articles/kernel_callback_functions.html)\n\nThe most common Kernel callback functions leveraged by security vendors are:\n\nPsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine\nCmRegisterCallbackEx\nPsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine\nObRegisterCallbacks\nPsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine\n\nFor the purposes of this blog, we will be focusing on PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine\nwhich is a callback routine to monitor process creation activities performed by APIs like\nCreateProcess(), CreateProcessAsUser(), CreateProcessWithToken(), and\nCreateProcessWithLogon().\n\nSecurity products often leverage PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine as a mechanism to be\nnotified when a user spawns a new process via the CreateProcessW() function in\nkernel32.dll. With the introduction of kernel-mode drivers for modern security products, they\nare now able to intercept and inject into resulting process creation events by hooking ntdll.dll\nto perform inspections of the process activity.\n\nTo simulate the resulting blind spots from the FudModule, X-Force will disrupt the data\nstreams enabling Sysmon to monitor process creation events via\nPsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine without stopping the Sysmon ETW Trace Session or\nremoving the ETW Provider.\n\n_Sysmon Operating Normally_\n\n\n-----\n\nTo simulate the BYOVD attack, X-Force leveraged PsExec to assume privileges of NT\nAuthority\\SYSTEM and modified the Sysmon ETW Trace configuration so that while the\nSystem ETW Trace Session is running, no data will be written to the Event Log.\n\n_Sysmon After Trace Session Tampering_\n\nAt this point, the Sysmon service is running, the ETW Trace is running, and the Sysmon\nETW provider is available, but no process creation events are being written to the Event Log\neffectively simulating the behavior of the FudModule for a single ETW data source on an\ninfected system.\n\nAs previously stated, the FudModule does not appear to remove providers or continually null\nvalue ETW registration handles, so Defenders now have an opportunity to test ETW data\nstream health and be alerted when security telemetry is not operating as expected either\nthrough corruption or malicious activity. Fortunately, Microsoft makes this process easy with\na default ETW provider called Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process which handles the\nexecution of all threads in a process and directly interacts with the\nPsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine routine.\n\nWithin the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process provider, various data sources are available\nincluding new process creation, process thread, image loads, and CPU priority. Using the\nlogman utility, defenders can easily create a new ETW Trace Session to collect new process\ncreation events.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Creating a New ETW Trace for Process Creation Events_\n\nThe following PowerShell is a proof-of-concept replicating the core capabilities of X-Force’s\ntelemetry stream health tests for threat detection. In this script, a new ETW Trace session is\ncreated and subscribed to Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process\nWINEVENT_KEYWORD_PROCESS events. The script then creates test data using the\ncurrent timestamp as a unique identifier and checks whether the test data was located within\nthe newly created ETW Trace session and Sysmon. When the test data is not found in the\nSysmon log, an alert is written to the Application Event Log which can be alerted upon for\ndefenders.\n\n_ETW Data Health Test Script_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Create Alert When Telemetry Health Test Fails_\n\n_The following sections will detail static detection opportunities for the Lazarus FudModule_\n_based on the analysis of the malware sample._\n\n## Static Detection Opportunities Within File Activity\n\nTo initiate the BYOVD attack, the FudModule loads an embedded version of the Dell\ndbutil_2_3.system driver, which contains an insufficient access control vulnerability (CVE2021-21551) enabling the malware to escalate privileges. The FudModule extracts the driver\nfiles to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\ under a name randomly chosen from the following list:\n\ncirclassmgr.sys\ndmvscmgr.sys\nhidirmgr.sys\nisapnpmgr.sys\nmspqmmgr.sys\numpassmgr.sys\n\nX-Force was unable to locate any legitimate driver installations associated with the filenames\nused by the FudModule so defenders may be able to detect the malicious driver installation\nthrough monitoring file activity where the filenames listed above are written to\n%windr%\\system32\\drivers.\n\n## Static Detection Opportunities Within Event Log Data\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main functionality of the FudModule is directed towards the Windows kernel space\nhowever when first loaded, the malware is operating within user mode meaning it cannot\ninteract with kernel memory directly. To overcome this privilege issue, the FudModule\nexecutes the BYOVD attack leveraging the previously mentioned Dell driver. The Dell driver\nis installed as a kernel mode driver which combined with the CVE-2-1-2155 vulnerability\nenables the malware to the ability to escalate privileges to allow for writing to kernel memory.\n\nIn Microsoft Windows, when a kernel mode driver is installed a System Event Log Event ID\n7045 is generated. System event log 7045 entries contain the name of the driver, the full\npath to the driver file, and the type of driver that was installed (either kernel or user mode).\nDefenders can detect the installation of the vulnerable driver as part of the FudModule by\ncollecting Windows Event System Log entries where the Service Type is set to “kernel mode\ndriver” and the Service File Name contains one of the following filenames:\n\ncirclassmgr.sys\ndmvscmgr.sys\nhidirmgr.sys\nisapnpmgr.sys\nmspqmmgr.sys\numpassmgr.sys\n\n## Static Detection Opportunities Within Setup API Log Data\n\nThe following detection opportunity is not specific to the FudModule. Throughout the\nresearch performed by X-Force on malicious use of the Dell DBUtil driver, X-Force identified\nadditional malware and tools that leverage the Dell DBUtil BYOVD attack and identified the\nfollowing detection point.\n\nWhen the Dell Client Platform DBUtil driver is installed, the Microsoft Windows Plug and Play\nDevices module initiates the driver installation process. This process is captured within the\nSetupAPI log file located in %windir%\\inf\\setupapi.dev.log. The SetupAPI log was introduced\nin Windows Vista and contains information about device and driver installations including the\ninitiating process, driver paths, and troubleshooting data.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of legitimate and malicious installations of the Dell DBUtil driver indicated that\nregardless of the implementation, the Device Install in the SetupAPI log will register the\ndevice as “ROOT\\DBUtilDrv2”. Within the SetupAPI log file, defenders may be able to detect\nmalicious installation of the DBUtil driver by collecting and parsing the SetupAPI log file for\n“ROOT\\DBUtilDrv2” where the associated command and INF path do not match with the\nlegitimate Dell Driver Install data shown below.\n\n_Legitimate DBUtil Install SetupAPI Data_\n\n_Malicious DBUtil Install SetupAPI Data_\n\n## Static Detection Opportunity Through IOCs\n\nFudModule.dll File Hash:\n97C78020EEDFCD5611872AD7C57F812B069529E96107B9A33B4DA7BC967BF38F\n\nDbutil_2_3.sys File Hash:\n0296E2CE999E67C76352613A718E11516FE1B0EFC3FFDB8918FC999DD76A73A5\n\n[John Dwyer](https://securityintelligence.com/author/john-dwyer/)\nHead of Research, IBM Security X-Force\n\nJohn (@TactiKoolSec) is the Head of Research for the IBM Security X-Force where he leads\nresearch efforts to understand and model adversary operations, devel...\n\nPOPULAR\n\n\n-----\n\n[Intelligence & Analytics February 21, 2023](https://securityintelligence.com/category/topics/security-intelligence-analytics/)\n\n## Backdoor Deployment and Ransomware: Top Threats Identified in X- Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023\n\n4 min read - Discover how threat actors are waging attacks and how to proactively protect\nyour organization with top findings from the 2023 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
