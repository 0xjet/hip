In the campaign, we discovered a file containing the SnailResin malware.\n\nBoth SlugResin and SnailResin were attributed by Microsoft to a subgroup of charming kitten\n(also known as APT35 and Smoke Sandstorm[1]). Our investigation revealed that the malware is\ndownloaded from a domain that impersonates a job recruiting website (recurring theme for the\n\nadversary), through which the recruiter's LinkedIn profile is revealed. The adversary appears to\nbe using the same profile as in previous attacks.\n\nMalware files were detected as Kimsuky/Lazarus APT groups by antivirus engines in a few cases\n\ninstead of Charming Kitten.\n\nWe found significant similarities between the North Korean Lazarus APT Group and Charming\nKitten attacks. There are several similarities between these two threat actors, including the use\nof the \"Dream Job\" luring campaign, the attack technique, and the use of several malware files\n\nto deploy malware through DLL Side Loading attacks.\n\nThe following conclusions can be drawn as a result:\n\n- Charming Kitten impersonated the North Korean campaign to conceal their activities.\n\n1 [security.microsoft.com/intel-explorer/articles/39a136d2?tid=ba71bfaa-87f8-4029-af04-f4eb1aa171f2](http://security.microsoft.com/intel-explorer/articles/39a136d2?tid=ba71bfaa-87f8-4029-af04-f4eb1aa171f2)\n\nCopyright © 2024, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”). All Rights Reserved.\nTLP Cl l k 2 | P\n\n\n-----\n\n- North Korea shared with Iran their attack methods and tools, hence similarity in attack\n\nscenario and detection.\n\nIran's \"Dream Job\" campaign has been active since at least September 2023, constantly\nchanging its infrastructure and malware. Mandiant published an article in February 2024 about\n\"suspected Iranian espionage activity targeting the Middle East aerospace, aviation, and defense\nindustries, especially in Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as possibly Turkey,\nIndia, and Albania.[2]\n\nLinkedIn profiles of the \"recruiters\" identified in the current campaign are \"newer versions\" of\nthose previously reported by Mandiant.\n\nOne profile we discovered was associated with a fake company called \"Careers 2 Find\" which\npreviously worked for \"1st Employer\", a fake recruiting website highlighted by Mandiant in\nFebruary.\n\nTA455, also known as Smoke Sandstorm, BOHRIUM and Yellow Dev13, is a subgroup of Iranian\n\nthreat actor Charming Kitten (APT35). TA455 targets organizations in Israel using double attack\nscenarios (two scenarios in one attack, one malicious and one for camouflage), DLL search order\n\nhijacking and masquerading as recruiters for companies, to target company employees with\nspear-phishing.\n\nCharming Kitten also known as APT35, is an Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group active\nin targeting various sectors for many years, especially focusing on governmental and military\n\nsectors. Charming Kitten frequently uses multi-stage infection chains designed to steal sensitive\ndata and facilitate remote access for further exploitation.\n\nIn recent campaigns, Charming Kitten has leveraged social engineering tactics, primarily\n\nthrough phishing, to lure victims. This group is reportedly leveraging high-level obfuscation and\n\ncustom malicious code to evade detection while delivering these payloads. Their methods align\n\nclosely with command-and-control operations, which allow them to manage and exfiltrate data\nfrom compromised networks effectively. Charming Kitten’s focus in 2024 has intensified in\nEastern Europe and Israel, likely influenced by the ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding\n\nIran’s alliances and interests, particularly against entities perceived as oppositional to Iranian\ngeopolitical aims.\n\n2 [cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east/](http://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east/)\n\nCopyright © 2024, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”). All Rights Reserved.\nTLP Cl l k 3 | P\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group’s technical sophistication is moderate to high, using both established RATs and\ncomplex, custom-built malware.\n\nThe group's infrastructure and campaign characteristics bear resemblance to previous Iranian\nstate-backed campaigns but have adapted to bypass current security measures, with significant\n\nuse of evasive techniques to ensure persistence within targeted networks. This ongoing threat\nhas led cybersecurity firms to increase monitoring and mitigation efforts, specifically in sectors\n\nmost affected by Charming Kitten's activities, such as governmental, military, and critical\n\ninfrastructure organizations.\n\n## Techniques Employed by TA455 for Evading Detection \n\n1. Impersonating Other Threat Actors: TA455 intentionally attempts to mislead investigators by\n\nmimicking the tactics and tools of other threat actors, specifically the North Korean Lazarus\ngroup. This includes utilizing similar \"Dream Job\" lures, attack techniques, and even malware\n\nfiles that overlap with those used by Lazarus in DLL side-loading attacks. This deliberate\n\nmisattribution aims to create confusion and hinder accurate attribution efforts.\n\n2. Leveraging Legitimate Services: To conceal their infrastructure and C2 communications,\n\nTA455 hides within the traffic of legitimate online services like Cloudflare, GitHub and\n\nMicrosoft Azure cloud. Using Cloudflare for their malicious domains like \"careers2find[.]com\"\nhelps to mask the true server location and ownership, making it harder to track their\noperations. Similarly, they exploit GitHub to host encoded C2 server information, retrieving it\n\nthrough seemingly innocuous accounts like \"msdnedgesupport\". This blending with\nlegitimate traffic allows them to maintain a low profile and avoid raising red flags for security\n\nsystems.\n\n3. Multi-Stage Infection Process: TA455 uses a carefully designed multi-stage infection process\n\nto increase their chances of success while minimizing detection. The initial spearphishing\n\nemails likely contain malicious attachments disguised as job-related documents, which are\nfurther concealed within ZIP files containing a mix of legitimate and malicious files. This\n\nlayered approach aims to bypass security scans and trick victims into executing the\nmalware. Once executed, the malware performs various actions in stages, like checking the\n\nvictim's IP address and retrieving C2 server information from compromised GitHub\naccounts, making it harder to detect and analyze the full scope of the attack.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”). All Rights Reserved.\nTLP Cl l k | P\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Exploiting Trust and Professional Networks: By leveraging LinkedIn, a platform inherently\n\nbuilt on trust and professional connections, TA455 seeks to gain credibility and avoid raising\n\nsuspicion. Their use of fake recruiter profiles associated with fabricated companies further\nstrengthens the deception and makes it more likely for victims to engage with their\n\nmalicious links and attachments. This exploitation of a trusted platform allows them to\nbypass traditional security measures that might flag suspicious emails or websites.\n\n5. Constant Evolution of Infrastructure and Malware: TA455 continuously modifies its\n\ninfrastructure and malware, making it harder for security researchers and tools to keep up.\nTheir constant adaptation, evidenced by changing domains, IP addresses, and malware\n\nvariants, forces defenders to constantly update their defenses and makes it challenging to\nestablish consistent detection patterns.\n\n6. Low Antivirus Detection Rates: The malicious ZIP file used in the campaign was only flagged\n\nas malicious by five antivirus engines, with a primary misattribution to the North Korean\n\nKimsuky group. This low detection rate highlights their ability to craft malware that evades\ntraditional signature-based detection methods. This could be achieved through various\n\ntechniques like obfuscation, encryption, or the use of one-day exploits.\n\n7. High-Level Obfuscation and Custom Code: TA455's use of advanced obfuscation techniques\n\nand custom-built malware, designed specifically to evade detection. By employing\n\nsophisticated methods to conceal their malicious code, they can bypass security tools that\nrely on identifying known malware signatures or behaviors. This demonstrates a moderate\nto high level of technical sophistication and a commitment to staying ahead of security\n\ndefenses\n\n8. Target Specificity: The \"Dream Job\" campaign consistently targets the aerospace, aviation,\n\nand defense industries. This suggests a strategic interest in acquiring sensitive information\nand potentially disrupting operations within these critical sectors. The focus on these\n\nindustries aligns with Iran's geopolitical interests and its history of cyber espionage activities\ntargeting entities perceived as adversaries.\n\n9. Persistence and Evolution: the Iranian \"Dream Job\" campaign has been active since at least\n\nSeptember 2023, indicating a persistent effort by TA455. The constant changes in\ninfrastructure and malware demonstrate their adaptability and commitment to staying\n\nahead of security measures. This highlights the need for ongoing vigilance and proactive\ndefense strategies.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”).
