It is a common trope in\ncybersecurity that professionals first became interested in the field through an encounter\nwhile playing games. Speaking personally, I first became enthralled with hacking in 2008 by\n[matching against some modders using hacked weapons while playing Halo 3 (my favourite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3)\ngame of all time).\n\nThis blog aims to highlight why monitoring the video game industry is important for cyber\nthreat intelligence analysts hunting down the latest threats. Video games and hacking are\nvery intertwined. Many hackers start out by creating cheats for games, and have to play the\ngames to begin with to learn how to hack them.\n\nThere are also several notable incidents whereby hacking in video games escalated to\nbecome critical issues for the software development industry and enterprise security realms.\nThis includes zero-day exploits, stolen code-signing certificates, rootkit development, and\nsupply-chain attacks, as well as ransomware and intellectual property theft.\n\n**The Video Game Cheating Industry**\n\n\n-----\n\nCheating in video games is as old as the industry itself. However, nowadays cheating is a\nmassive multi-billion dollar underground economy. What was once only done by a small\ngroup of hackers has evolved into massive criminal enterprises, selling Cheats-as-aService.\n\n[In March 2021, the BBC reported that Chinese police worked with Tencent to disrupt one of](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56579449)\nthe largest video-game-cheating operations ever. The perpetrators designed and sold cheats\nfor popular games, such as Overwatch and Call of Duty. Approximately $76m (£55m) in\nrevenue was made by the criminal business, which charged a subscription fee to\nclients. Subscription prices for users began at around $10 a day, and up to $200 a month.\n\n[In June 2021, security researcher Karsten Hahn uncovered a new rootkit signed by](https://twitter.com/struppigel/status/1405483373280235520)\nMicrosoft. Later, Microsoft published a blog investigating a threat actor distributing a\n[malicious signed driver, dubbed the Netfilter rootkit, within gaming environments. The](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/06/25/investigating-and-mitigating-malicious-drivers/)\noperation was able to trick Microsoft into signing their code by submitting drivers for\ncertification through the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program. The implications here\nwere massive, however, the malicious actor’s activity was limited to the gaming sector\nspecifically in China. Microsoft also said they believed the aim of the driver was to gain an\nadvantage in games and possibly exploit other players by compromising their accounts\nthrough common tools like keyloggers.\n\nThe type of malicious software (malware) like the Netfilter rootkit is common in the gaming\nindustry as to be able to defeat anti-cheat systems you often have to be running at a level\nlower than the Windows operating system (OS), at the kernel-mode level.\n\n**Hackers in Games**\n\n[One of the most critical events in recent gaming history was Log4Shell, a vulnerability also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell)\nknown as CVE-2021-44228 with a CVSS score of 10.0. That was first uncovered by the\nAlibaba Security team and disclosed on 9 December 2021 and was exploited immediately\nafterwards by a range of threats, including botnets, ransomware, and advanced persistent\nthreat (APT) groups - but it all started in Minecraft. At the time of this writing, even five\n[months since it was initially disclosed, thousands of applications remain vulnerable to](https://threatpost.com/java-apps-vulnerable-log4shell/179397/)\nLog4Shell.\n\nLog4Shell was a zero-day exploit in the ubiquitous Apache Log4j logging library that if\nexploited successfully could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the targeted device.\nLog4Shell is also trivial to exploit. It can be done so by pasting \"${jndi:ldap://<URL to\npayload>}\" into an input field and waiting for Log4j to fetch the remote payload and execute\nit, opening a backdoor on the affected system.\n\n[Using Log4Shell, hackers quickly began exploiting the popular video game, Minecraft. When](https://www.polygon.com/22832081/minecraft-java-microsoft-security-risk)\na user pasted the string into a message they could compromise the entire Minecraft server\n[and other players' systems. This soon became known as the \"worst week in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z22O5uEsF6U)\n\n\n-----\n\nhistory . As soon as players began to see this message pop up on their screens panic\nensued.\n\nAs they began to realize the cause of this was the Log4Shell exploit others joined in and\nbegan to leverage it malicious attacks in Minecraft, and in other games such as Dark Souls\n3. This included exploiting Log4Shell to compromise other players' accounts and stealing or\ndestroying their in-game items, which can take months or years to acquire and can be worth\nhundreds or thousands of real dollars.\n\n_Figure 1. Log4Shell exploited in Minecraft_\n**Historical Cybersecurity Incidents In The Gaming industry**\n\nVideo game developers and publishers receive many of the same threats that organizations\nsuch as banks or governments may receive. To empathize the severity of the threat,\nMicrosoft has an entire division and security operations center (SOC) dedicated to protecting\nthe Xbox Live Network and development.\n\n**A variety of notable cybersecurity incidents that affected major household names are**\n**as follows:**\n\nIn 2003, Half Life 2's source was stolen after the email of Valve's co-founder Gabe\nNewell was compromised and the entire Half Life 2 source tree was downloaded from\nhis computer\nIn October 2014, four people were charged in the US and one in Australia for their\n[alleged involvement in a hacking ring known as Xbox Underground that stole source](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29440209)\ncode and intellectual property from a variety of games companies and Microsoft\nIn October 2016, two teenage members of Lizard Squad and PoodleCorp were\n[arrested for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Pokémon](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/10/13/lizard-squad-poodlecorp-members-arrested-in-ddos-for-hire-bust/)\nGO servers and ruining gamers’ Christmas with a DDoS against the servers that power\nPlayStation and Xbox consoles\n\n\n-----\n\nIn March 2019, Dr. Web researchers discovered 39% of all existing Counter-Strike 1.6\n[game servers were being used by malicious actors in attempts to infect players with the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/39-percent-of-all-counter-strike-16-servers-used-to-infect-players/)\nBelonard Trojan botnet by exploiting game client vulnerabilities\nIn April 2020, the source code of Valve's Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: Global\n[Offensive games was re-leaked on the Internet for anyone to download after already](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/valve-reassures-gamers-after-cs-go-and-team-fortress-2-leaks/)\nbeing leaked in 2018\n[Also in April 2020, 160,000 Nintendo customer accounts getting hijacked via credential](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nintendo-says-160000-users-impacted-in-recent-account-hacks/)\n[stuffing, which led to Nintendo disconnecting NNID legacy login system from main](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2020/0424.html)\nNintendo profiles\n[In December 2021, security researchers disclosed that they found several sets](https://vpnoverview.com/news/sega-europe-security-report/)\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) keys in an exposed affected S3 bucket, with which it was\npossible scripts run and upload files to domains of SEGA Europe\n\n**The Game Industry Is Targeted By Organized Cybercriminals**\n\nLike any software development company, many large games companies will have corporate\nnetworks that can be targeted by cybercriminals and advanced persistent threat (APT)\ngroups for extortion or intellectual property theft. There have been a number of high-profile\nand painful ransomware attacks against household names. Chinese-speaking APT groups\nhave also targeted games companies for a variety of reasons, including intellectual property\ntheft and important artefacts such as code-signing certificates. These incidents are a lot\nmore serious than account hijacking or cheating, they verge into the corporate espionage\nand organized cybercrime realms.\n\n**Crytek and Ubisoft**\n\n[In October 2020, video game developer Crytek was victim to an Egregor ransomware attack,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/)\nwhich subsequently also reportedly affected Ubisoft. In addition to encrypting devices on\nCrytek's network, the Egregor operators stole unencrypted files from the company and\nleaked a 380MB archive on its darknet leak site containing data from WarFace and Crytek's\ncancelled Arena of Fate MOBA game. The Egregor operators also managed to allegedly\nsteal data pertaining to Ubisoft's Watch Dogs: Legion game (which is ironically all about\n[hacking). On 28 October, Egregor posted a 500GB archive containing assets from the game.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1321446201619816448?s=20&t=1J2FFvY6OFwjdJwFRFqAVw)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2.

Both Egregor and\nMaze, as well as Sekhmet, were attributed to the same group of organized cybercriminals\n[tracked altogether as the TwistedSpider cryptonym by CrowdStrike. For Egregor, initial](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/twisted-spider/)\naccess was gained through the use of the QakBot banking Trojan, the targeting of unpatched\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) appliances, and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services.

In November\n[2020, the company announced it was hit by a crippling ransomware attack. The attack was](https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e201104.html)\norchestrated by the [RagnarLocker group (aka VikingSpider), a Russian-speaking organized](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/capcom-hit-by-ragnar-locker-ransomware-1tb-allegedly-stolen/)\n[cybercriminal group. The threat group's previous victims include Energias de Portugal,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarlocker-ransomware-hits-edp-energy-giant-asks-for-10m/) CMA\nCGM, and [Campari. In each case, the group demanded between $10-$15 million in ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/campari-hit-by-ragnar-locker-ransomware-15-million-demanded/)\nfor the decryption keys and to prevent stolen data from being published on the group's data\nleak blog hosted on the darknet.\n\nThe RagnarLocker threat actors claimed in the ransom note (see Figure 2) they stole up to\n1TB of sensitive data from Capcom's corporate networks in Japan, the US, and Canada.\nThis included intellectual property, employee personal data, sensitive emails, and nondisclosure agreements. The group also threatened to leak and/or sell the stolen data if the\nransom is not paid. Further, enclosed in the ransom note are screenshots of stolen files as\nwell as including a list of Active Directory Users and Computers for the Capcom Windows\n[domain. Security researcher Pancak3 also told BleepingComputer that RagnarLocker](https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz)\nclaimed to have encrypted up to 2,000 devices on Capcom's networks and are demanding\n$11 million in Bitcoins for a decryptor.\n\n_Figure 3. RagnarLocker ransom note and leak site targeting Capcom_\n[In January 2021, Capcom made a statement on the breach and disclosed that it suspected](https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e210112.html)\nthe data of up to 390,000 people was likely stolen. Capcom says the exposed data could be\na mix of names, addresses, phone numbers, HR information, and email addresses. In April\n[2021, Capcom released a final statement on the November 2020 RagnarLocker ransomware](https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e210413.html)\nincident. The company says it had recovered from the attack, around six months since the\nincident started. Capcom's final assessment regarding the data breach is that only 15,649\nindividuals were impacted who were notified of their exposure. Stolen information also did\nnot include payment card details, only corporate and personally identifiable data. Digital\nforensics experts also identified that the Ragnar Locker operators gained initial access to\nCapcom’s internal network by exploiting a vulnerability in an unpatched VPN device located\n\n\n-----\n\nat the company s North American subsidiary in California. From there, the adversary pivoted\nto devices in offices in the US and Japan and executed the ransomware on 1 November\n2020, causing email and file servers to be taken offline.\n\n**CD PROJEKT RED**\n\nOn 9 February 2021, creators of the popular Witcher game series and Cyberpunk 2077, CD\n[Projekt Red (CDPR), announced it was the victim of a ransomware attack by a threat group](https://www.facebook.com/CDPROJEKTRED/posts/3694017150714458)\nusing a variant Emsisoft's [Fabian Wosar identified as HelloKitty (aka DeathKitty). The threat](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1359167108727332868?s=20&t=7N3G5FnppjnhUu-g6giBeA)\ngroup responsible also claimed in the ransom note (see Figure 3) to have stolen the source\ncode from several of CDPR's games.\n\n[The next day, on 10 February, vx-underground tweeted that CDPR's data had been leaked](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1359473460448231425?s=20&t=fM8_RYh2m5XNwFp-bDS7XA)\nto an infamous Russian-speaking cybercrime forum known as Exploit[.]in. VICE Motherboard\n[journalists obtained a copy of the data on a low level hacking and data trading forum and](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpapp/hackers-release-cdpr-data-gwent)\ndownloaded it for verification purposes. The data included assets from CDPR's Witcher spin\noff game, Gwent. The cybercriminals responsible then posted about an auction of the data\nfor \"1kk$\" (which reportedly equals $1 million in underground Russian cybercriminal slang).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. HelloKitty ransom note and data leak targeting CD Projekt Red_\n[From the start, CDPR did not submit to the cybercriminal's demands. CDPR's statement at](https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660)\nthe time said \"We will not give in to the demands nor negotiate with the actor, being aware\nthat this may eventually lead to the release of the compromised data.\" The company added\nthat the hackers had \"successfully encrypted some devices\" on CDPR's network, but that the\ncompany had backups and begun restoring the data.\n\n**Electronic Arts**\n\n[In June 2021, Electronic Arts (EA) fell victim to a sophisticated social engineering attack that](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5xpx/hackers-steal-data-electronic-arts-ea-fifa-source-code)\nled to the theft of up to 780GB of proprietary source code from the FIFA franchise and its\nFrostbite game engine. The hacker and their associates are part of a group, which later\ndubbed itself LAPSUS$, would go on to wreak havoc at top companies such as Microsoft,\nNvidia, Vodafone, and Okta, as well as Ubisoft according to its Telegram channel.\n\n\n-----\n\nEA confirmed to VICE Motherboard that it had suffered a data breach and that the\ninformation listed by the hackers was the data that was stolen. The disturbing breach at EA\nwas indicative of things to come. The LAPSUS$ group used a combination of social\nengineering, cybercrime underground markets selling stolen credentials and cookies, SIM\nswapping, and some uncomplex techniques to compromise Windows systems.\n\n[A leaked incident response report disclosed showed that once a LAPSUS$ member gained](https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1508527487655067660)\naccess to a compromised Windows system via RDP, they would use Microsoft Bing to\ndownload hacking tools and exploits, such as ProcessHacker and Mimikatz, from Github to\nturn off the victim's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) protection and dump\ncredentials from the system's memory and then copied to Pastebin.\n\n_Figure 5. Threat actors connected to LAPSUS$ advertise stolen EA source code_\n\nWhat made LAPSUS$ so interesting is that their unique set of skills proved to be highly\neffective against companies with some of the best enterprise security defences in the world.\nThese teenage hackers began by targeting a games company and went on to hit a company\nlike Okta, which is used by hundreds of not only the Fortune 500, but also governments\nworldwide. The motivation of LAPSUS$ appeared to be for financial gains, however, as the\nhacks got more brazen it seemingly became a quest for notoriety and infamy. The group had\na Telegram channel with up to 47,000 subscribers and would brag about each hack on\nit. Ultimately, on 24 March 2022, British police arrested seven suspects between the ages of\n16 and 21 reportedly part of the gang.\n\nThe story did not end there though. On 30 March, LAPSUS$ posted details about another\n[breach against a software consultancy giant Globant, where the group had stolen 70GB of](https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1509004391751245829)\ndata, including customer source code. Further, on 22 April, KrebsOnSecurity obtained a copy\nof the [private chat messages between members of the LAPSUS$ cybercrime group. The](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/leaked-chats-show-lapsus-stole-t-mobile-source-code/)\nleaked chats revealed that LAPSUS$ also breached T-Mobile (Deutsch Telekom) multiple\ntimes in March 2022, stealing source code for a range of company projects.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother disturbing revelation to come out of the LAPSUS$ campaign was the group s use of\nfake [emergency data requests. This is where these cybercriminals could successfully use a](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/)\nhacked police or government department email account to request emergency access to\npersonal subscriber information from internet service providers, phone companies and social\nmedia firms via the pretext that the request does not require a warrant because somebody's\nlife is at risk. The companies would often comply due to it being an emergency and coming\nfrom a legitimate but compromised government or police email address.\n\n**APTs Hacking Games Companies For Espionage And Profit**\n\n[Since at least 2009, a sophisticated Chinese hacking group known as Winnti has targeted](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)\n[the gaming industry.

It was later revealed that the malware landed on the players' systems\nas part of a regular update from the game's official update server. Making it one of the first of\nseveral software supply-chain attacks orchestrated by this threat group. APT41 would go on\n[to orchestrate the infamous CCleaner supply-chain attack years later in September 2017.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/avast-distributes-malware.html)\n\nKaspersky researchers uncovered that the digital signature used to sign the original Winnti\nmalware was stolen from another video game vendor known as KOG, based in South Korea.\nThe researchers then found that between 2011 and 2013, the Winnti group had used at least\n18 stolen code-signing certificates in its campaigns all belonging to video games companies\nfrom South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, China, and the US.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. APT41 indicted by the Department of Justice in September 2020_\nHacking video games companies by a sophisticated state-sponsored adversary seemed\nunusual. This was due to the fact that during the same timeframe Chinese APTs had\ntargeted Google, Adobe, and the New York Times. Many security experts were curious why\nChinese intelligence agencies were heavily investing resources into hacking games\ncompanies.\n\n**Potential Winnti objectives for targeting the gaming industry:**\n\n**Objective 1 - Online games could be exploited to accumulate in-game currency, which**\ncould be resold for real currency\n**Objective 2 - Source code theft could be used to find exploits in the software to**\nsupport Objective 1\n**Objective 3 - Having zero-day exploits in any software is advantageous for an**\nintelligence agency as it grants the ability to target other organizations and individuals\n**Objective 4 - Stealing personal customer data**\n**Objective 5 - Stealing software inventions and innovations to support other industries,**\nsuch as military combat simulators\n**Objective 6 - Stealing intellectual property to reproduce in their own domestic gaming**\nindustry\n**Objective 7 - Repurposing resources like code-signing certificates and email accounts**\nfor other cyber-espionage campaigns\n\n[Additionally, in March 2019 and April 2020, security researchers from ESET and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\n[QuoIntelligence, respectively, disclosed further campaigns linked to the Winnti group against](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/04/winnti-group-insights-from-the-past/)\nthe video games industry. Indicating that these adversaries continue to spy on games\ncompanies, primarily in Asia, up to 10 years later since the campaign began.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In March 2021, ESET also disclosed another campaign reminiscent of previous Winnti](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)\nattacks but did not formally attribute it to the APT group. The researchers uncovered a\nsoftware supply-chain attack against emulation software, NoxPlayer, to install surveillance\nmalware on the computers of online gamers. The maker of NoxPlayer, BigNox, says the\nsoftware has 150 million users in 150 countries. The infrastructure of BigNox, was reportedly\ncompromised by an adversary to push a malicious update. And, in some cases, additional\npayloads were downloaded by the BigNox updater from attacker-controlled servers.\n\n**So What?**\n\nHopefully this blog highlights the fact that it is particularly important to monitor the cyber\nthreat landscape of the gaming industry. There have been several occasions where a cyber\nincident began in the gaming sector and eventually worked its way to the software industry,\nand thus all other sectors are affected by it. The Log4Shell event, several software supplychain attacks, digital certificate theft campaigns, and intellectual property theft campaigns,\namong others. Although these incidents may have started in the gaming industry it eventually\naffected top companies, such as Microsoft.\n\nIn my experience, hackers have often started out by hacking their favourite game. They\neither reverse engineer it themselves, learn from others, or encounter other hackers online.\nThis then leads to cheating and/or selling cheats and techniques, and potentially zero-day\nexploit development. Although some of these larger cheating shops may possess the ability\nto discover a zero-day vulnerability or develop a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit to support\ntheir cheats, there are much larger ramifications affecting the entire enterprise IT ecosystem.\n\n**Key reasons to monitor the gaming industry cyber threat landscape:**\n\nFrom a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) perspective, it can be useful to monitor hacking\nactivities in the gaming communities as it can sometimes lead to corporate enterprise\nsecurity\nAlso from a CTI perspective, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that affect\nvideo game companies will affect the software industry, and thus all other sectors\nFrom a detection engineering perspective, monitoring the cheating industry for the\nlatest rootkit developments and bypassing anti-cheat systems is important to identify\nthe latest techniques leveraged in the wild for bypassing defences\nFrom a software development perspective, it would also be useful to monitor the\ndevelopment of bypasses for copyright protection and anti-piracy protections of games\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nGames companies that have appeared on Have I Been Pwned?\n\n\n-----\n\n[Sony PSN in 2011,](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Sony) [Dungeons & Dragons Online in 2013, LOTR Online in](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#DDO)\n[2013, Warframe in 2014, Epic Games in 2016, SubaGames in 2016, Evony in](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Warframe)\n[2016, Unreal Engine forum in 2016, CD Projekt Red in 2017, BlankMediaGames](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#UnrealEngine)\nin 2018, [Mortal Online in 2018, Armor Games in 2019, IDC Games in 2021](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#MortalOnline)\nDarknet Diaries Episodes on Hacking Online Video Games for Fun\n\nPart I - [https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/7/](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/7/)\nPart II - [https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/8/](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/8/)\nDarknet Diaries Episodes on Xbox Underground\nDarknet Diaries Episode on the Vide Game Cheating Industry\n\n[https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/115/](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/115/)\n\n## Lessons from the Conti Leaks\n\n How Do You Run A Cybercrime Gang?\n\n Ransomware Decryption Intelligence\n\n\n-----",
