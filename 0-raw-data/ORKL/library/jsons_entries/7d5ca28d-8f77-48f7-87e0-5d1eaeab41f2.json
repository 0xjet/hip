For this investigation, our analysts were provided with administrative\naccess to one of the affected servers, located in a hotel based in Pyeongchang county,\nSouth Korea. In addition, we collected all available evidence from various private and public\nsources and worked with several companies to investigate the command and control (C&C)\ninfrastructure associated with the attackers.\n\nDuring this investigation, one thing stood out – the attackers had pretty good operational\nsecurity and made almost no mistakes. Some of our colleagues from other companies\npointed out similarities with Chinese APT groups and Lazarus. Yet, something about these\npotential connections didn’t quite add up. This made us look deeper for more clues.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers behind OlympicDestroyer employed several tricks to make it look similar to the\nmalicious samples attributed to the Lazarus group. The main module of OlympicDestroyer\ncarries five additional binaries in its resources, named 101 to 105 respectively. It is already\nknown that resources 102 and 103, with the internal names ‘kiwi86.dll’ and ‘kiwi64.dll’ share\nconsiderable amounts of code with other known malware families only because they are built\non top of the Mimikatz open-source tool. Resource 105, however is much more interesting in\nterms of attribution.\n\n[Resource 105 is the ‘wiper‘ component of OlympicDestroyer. This binary launches a](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/wiper/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ndestructive attack on the victim’s network; it removes shadow copy backups, traverses the\nshared folders on the networks and wipes files. Anyone familiar with the wipers attributed to\nthe Lazarus group will find strong similarities in the file deletion routines:\n\n_File deletion routines._\n\n_To the left 3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf (OlympicDestroyer), on the right_\n\n_1d0e79feb6d7ed23eb1bf7f257ce4fee (BlueNoroff by Lazarus)._\n\nBoth functions do essentially the same thing: they delete the file by wiping it with zeroes,\nusing a 4096 bytes memory block. The minor difference here is that the original Bluenoroff\nroutine doesn’t just return after wiping the file, but also renames it to a new random name\nand then deletes it. So, the similar code may be considered as no more than a weak link.\n\nA much more interesting discovery appeared when we started looking for various kinds of\nmetadata of the PE file. It turned out that that the wiper component of OlympicDestroyer\ncontained the exact ‘Rich’ header that appeared previously in Bluenoroff samples.\n\n\n-----\n\n_MZ DOS and Rich headers of both files (3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf – OlympicDestroyer,_\n\n_5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0ef5b3cfe – BlueNoroff) are exactly the same._\n\nThis provided us with an interesting clue: if files from both the OlympicDestroyer and\nBluenoroff families shared the same Rich header it meant that they were built using the\nsame environment and, having already found some similarities in the code, this could have\nmeant that there is a real link between them. To test this theory, we needed to investigate the\ncontents of the Rich header.\n\nThe Rich header is an undocumented structure that appears in most of the PE files\ngenerated with the ‘LINK.EXE’ tool by Microsoft. Effectively, any binary built using the\nstandard Microsoft Visual Studio toolset contains this header. There is no official\ndocumentation describing this structure, but there is enough public information that can be\nfound on the internet, and there is also the LINK.EXE itself that can be reverse engineered.\nSo, what is a Rich header?\n\nA Rich header is a structure that is written right after the MZ DOS header. It consists of pairs\nof 4-byte integers. It starts with the magic value, ‘DanS’ and ends with a ‘Rich’ followed by a\nchecksum. And it is also encrypted using a simple XOR operation using the checksum as the\nkey. The data between the magic values encodes the ‘bill of materials’ that were collected by\nthe linker to produce the binary\n\n\n-----\n\nOffset First value Second value Description\n\n00 44 61 6E 53 (“DanS”) 00 00 00 00 Beginning of the header\n\n08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Empty record\n\n10 Tool id, build version Number of items Bill of materials record #1\n\n…\n\n… 52 69 63 68 “Rich” Checksum / XOR key End of the header\n\nThe first value of each record is a tool identifier: the unique number of the tool (‘C++\ncompiler’, ‘C compiler’, ‘resource compiler’, ‘MASM’, etc.), a Visual Studio specific, and the\nlowest 16 bits of the build number of the tool. The second value is a little-endian integer that\nis a number of items that were produced by the tool. For example, if the application consists\nof three source C++ files, there will be a record with a tool id corresponding to the C++\ncompiler, and the item count will be exactly ‘3’.\n\nThe Rich header in OlympicDestroyer’s wiper component can be decoded as follows:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\nRaw data     Type     Count   Produced by\n\n========================================================\n\n000C 1C7B 00000001  oldnames     1  12 build 7291\n\n000A 1F6F 0000000B  cobj       11  VC 6 (build 8047)\n\n000E 1C83 00000005  masm613      5  MASM 6 (build 7299)\n\n0004 1F6F 00000004  stdlibdll     4  VC 6 (build 8047)\n\n005D 0FC3 00000007  sdk/imp      7  VC 2003 (build 4035)\n\n0001 0000 0000004D  imports     77  imports (build 0)\n\n000B 2636 00000003  c++obj      3  VC 6 (build 9782)\n\n\nIt is a typical example of a header for a binary created with Visual Studio 6. The ‘masm613’\nitems were most likely taken from the standard runtime library, while the items marked as ‘VC\n2003’ correspond to libraries imported from a newer Windows SDK – the code uses some\nWindows API functions that were missing at the time VC 6 was released. So, basically it\nlooks like a C++ application having three source code files and using a slightly newer SDK to\nlink the Windows APIs. The description perfectly matches the contents of the Bluenoroff\nsample that has the same Rich header (i.e. 5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0ef5b3cfe).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe get very different results when trying to check the validity of the Rich header s entries\nagainst the actual contents of OlympicDestroyer wiper’s component. Even a quick visual\ninspection of the file shows something very unusual for a file created with Visual Studio 6:\nreferences to ‘mscoree.dll’ that did not exist at the time.\n\n_References to “mscoree.dll” and error messages typical for the MSVC libraries_\n\nAfter some experimentation and careful comparison of binaries generated by different\nversions of Visual Studio, we can name the actual version of Studio that was used: it is\nVisual Studio 2010 (MSVC 10). Our best proof is the code of the ___tmainCRTStartup\nfunction that is only produced with the runtime library of MSVC 10 (DLL runtime) using\ndefault optimizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Beginning of the disassembly of the ___tmainCRTStartup function of the OlympicDestroyer’s wiper_\n\n_component, 3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf_\n\nIt is not possible that the binary was produced with a standard linker and was built using the\nMSVC 2010 runtime, having the 2010’s startup code invoking the WinMain function and at\nthe same time did not have any Rich records referring to VC/VC++ 2010. At the same time, it\ncould not have the same number of Rich records for the VC6 code that is missing from the\nbinary!\n\nA binary produced with Visual Studio 2010 and built from the same code (decompiled),\nhaving the same startup code and almost identical to the wiper’s sample will have a Rich\nheader that is totally different:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\nRaw data     Type     Count   Produced by\n\n================================================================\n\n009E 9D1B 00000008  masm10      8  VC 2010 (build 40219)\n\n0093 7809 0000000B  sdk/imp     11  VC 2008 (build 30729)\n\n0001 0000 00000063  imports     99  imports (build 0)\n\n00AA 9D1B 0000003A  cobj       58  VC 2010 (build 40219)\n\n00AB 9D1B 0000000E  c++obj      14  VC 2010 (build 40219)\n\n009D 9D1B 00000001  linker      1  157 build 40219\n\n\nThe only reasonable conclusion that can be made is that the Rich header in the wiper was\ndeliberately copied from the Bluenoroff samples; it is a fake and has no connection with the\ncontents of the binary. It is not possible to completely understand the motives of this action,\nbut we know for sure that the creators of OlympicDestroyer intentionally modified their\nproduct to resemble the Bluenoroff samples produced by the Lazarus group.\n\n## The forgotten sample\n\nDuring the course of our investigation, we came across a sample that further consolidates\nthe theory of the Rich header false flag from Lazarus.\n\nThe sample, 64aa21201bfd88d521fe90d44c7b5dba was uploaded to a multi-scanner service\nfrom France on 2018-02-09 13:46:23, as ‘olymp.exe’. This is a version of the wiper malware\ndescribed above, with several important changes:\n\nThe 60 minutes delay before shutdown was removed\nCompilation timestamp is 2018-02-09 10:42:19\nThe Rich header appears legit\n\nThe removal of the 60 minutes’ delay indicates the attackers were probably in a rush and\ndidn’t want to wait before shutting down the systems. Also, if true, the compilation timestamp\n**2018-02-09 10:42:19 puts it right after the attack on the Pyeonchang hotels, which took**\nplace at around 9:00 a.m. GMT. This suggests the attackers compiled this ‘special’ sample\nafter the wiping attack against the hotels and, likely as a result of their hurry, forgot to fake\nthe Rich header.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe existence of the fake Rich header from Lazarus samples in the new OlympicDestroyer\nsamples indicates an intricate false flag operation designed to attribute this attack to the\nLazarus group. The attackers’ knowledge of the Rich header is complemented by their\ngamble that a security researcher would discover it and use it for attribution. Although we\ndiscovered this overlap on February 13, it seemed too good to be true. On the contrary, itth\nfelt like a false flag from the beginning, which is why we refrained from making any\nconnections with previous operations or threat actors. This newly published research\nconsolidates the theory that blaming the Lazarus group for the attack was parts of the\nattackers’ strategy.\n\nWe would like to ask other researchers around the world to join us in investigating\n**these false flags and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of**\nOlympicDestroyer.\n\nIf you would like to read more about Rich header, we can recommend a nice presentation on\nthis from George Webster and Julian Kirsch or Technical University of Munich:\nhttps://infocon.hackingand.coffee/Hacktivity/Hacktivity%202016/Presentations/George_Websterand-Julian-Kirsch.pdf.\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf – wiper with the fake Lazarus Rich header\n64aa21201bfd88d521fe90d44c7b5dba – wiper the original Rich header and no delay before\nshutdown\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Olympic Destroyer](https://securelist.com/tag/olympic-destroyer/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Wiper](https://securelist.com/tag/wiper/)\n[Worm](https://securelist.com/tag/worm/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nThe devil’s in the Rich header\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.
