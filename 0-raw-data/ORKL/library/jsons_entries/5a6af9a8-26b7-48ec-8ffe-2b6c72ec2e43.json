It was\n[first detected on October 2017. Its attributed to the Lazurus APT group it](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/lazarus_group)\nhas high connections to Ryuk Ransomware and its believed that they are\nwritten by the same author. Among most Ransomwares, it's common that\nit encrypts the files using AES and Encrypts the AES Random Key using\nRSA, in the upcoming parts we will include some more insights into it.\n\n## In Depth-Reversing:\n\n. HERMES Drops A Copy From its Self under Name \"svchosta.exe\" in the\nTemp Folder\n\nAnd it executes using this command\n\n## Inhibit System Recovery:\n\n. Similarly like most ransomwares it deletes shadow copies to acheive this\nit drops a batch file similar to the Ryuk one, which strengthens it's\nsimilarity to Ryuk\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd it executes using this command\n\n## Unpacking and API Resolving:\n\nHERMES allocates a section in memory for the unpacked PE file, this\n[technique can be defined as Self Injection . This image explains it very well](https://liveoverflow.com/unpacking-buhtrap-malware-basics-of-self-injection-packers-ft-oalabs-2/)\n& quick, credits goes to OALabs for the fantastic explanation\n\nWhat we need to do is to fire up the debugger and put 2 break points on:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[+] VirtualAlloc\n[+] VirtualProtect\n\n```\nWhile setting a breakpoint on VirtualAlloc(), make sure to press execute\ntill return, the return value of VirtualAlloc() is stored in EAX so Right click\non it and follow in dump\n\nNow Press F9 Again\n\nYay! A Nice PE File. Now Just follow in memory map and dump the file :)\n\nWhile opening the file in PE Studio on imports, but sadly there are just 5\nimports :(, so there must be a function that should resolve those imports.\n\nNow let's Fire Up IDA. Go to the imports Click \"X\" on LoadLibraryA to see\nwhere its called.\n\n\n-----\n\nGo for the First One..\n\nAnd Bingo We Found it :)\n\n\n-----\n\nSo It looks like its passing the API to a decryption or deobfsucation\nfunction. Now Just take this Address and and set a Break Point on it. when\nu break on it click execute till return. U may found sth! ECX holds our API.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo Now Right Click on ECX and Follow in Dump U must find all the APIs\n\nNow we have 3 choices first one is to dump the file using scylla, second is\nto rename the imports manually and third is to write a script. will leave it\nas an excercise for u ;)\n\n## Mutex Creation:\n\nHERMES Creates a Mutex with the name \"tech\". As U Can See the APIs\nrelated to mutex's are dynamiclly resolved.\n\nU may ask what is a mutex and why does the malware uses it ?. So let me\nexplain. First What is a Mutex is an object that allows mutliple threads to\nshare the same resource but in order. as shown in the figure:\n\n\n-----\n\ncomplicated right ? so let me explain why we need mutexes, when u have\ntwo threads sharing the same resource say if the Thread \"A\" Reads From\nthis Resource and Thread \"B\" Writes to this resource this resource maybe\nanything like a file for example. This Behavior is Called \"Race Condition\"\nthis must not happens because if Thread \"B\" Writes to the File for ex\nThread \"A\" will get corrupted data. So we need a Mechanism to scheduale\nthis behavior and that's what a mutex is a mutex aquires a lock for the\nThread this says oh ok now Thread \"A\" for ex u have the ability to read or\nwrite to the file or any other operation and Thread \"B\" Cannot Do any\noperation on that file before Thread \"A\" Releases This Lock or Mutex and\nIt will be given to Thread \"B\". ok but u may also ask so also how all of this\nstory relates to malware. ok malware uses mutexes for mutiple things one\nof them is not infecting the host twice.\n\n## Language Checks:\n\nHERMES Checks for the System language. Every language on this planet\nhas a code this code is just a number for example 0409 is the code for\nenglish. The code of the system language can be found under the a registry\nkey:\n```\n[+]\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Nls\\Lang\n\n```\nAs u can see the third value is the system language code. now lets see how\nit utlizes this feature.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt opens the Registry key I mentioned above and then it queries the value\nof InstallLanguage and Compares it with three values:\n```\n [+] 0419 --> Russian\n [+] 0422 --> Ukrainian\n [+] 0423 --> Belarusian\n\n```\nAnd if it matches it exits the process (malware) using ExitProcess.\n\n\n-----\n\nU may ask why this is important well this might be important in targetted\nattacks so it looks like it didn't want to target those countries. so luckily\nthese three countires won't get infected ;). Read this for more info Malware\nTrying to Avoid Some Contries\n\n## Percistance:\n\nHERMES Achieves Percistance by Dropping the \"start.bat\" batchfile in the\nstartup folder to start the malware every time the computer starts why ??\ndoesn't it encrypt the files and everything is fine ? ok but what if it missed a\nfile or if u have new files\n\nIt Drops this batch file in the StartUp Folder. The StartUp Folder in it the\nprograms that are executed automaticly every time the user logs in or when\nthe computer starts.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd U Simply Can Disable this File or simply delete it from the start folder.\n\nIf U tried restarting the VM u will see the command being executed but it\ndidn't\n\n## Encryption:\n\nHERMES Encrypts The Files using AES-256 Algorithm and Encrypts the\nAES Random Key with RSA, And It utlizes the Windows CryptAPI.\n\n## It uses:\n```\n[+] CryptEncrypt \n[+] CryptGenKey \n[+] CryptExportKey \n[+] CryptImportKey\n[+] CryptAcquireContextW\n\n```\n. It Drops two Files used for Encryption \"PUBLIC\" and\n\"UNIQUE_ID_DONT_REMOVE\".\n\nThe First one is a Public RSA Blob. These Blobs are used to store RSA\nPublic Keys.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd the second one is the private key which means its for the attacker only\nand its encrypted. Take alook at the first 8 bytes from offset 0 to 7 actually\nthese bytes has great meaning the 0x7 means that its a private key blob,\n0x2 is the blob version and 0xA400 is the algorithm so this will tell that its\nRSA or any other algorithm for our case its RSA.\n\nHERMES Uses \"HERMES\" Marker at the end of the file to identify if the\nfile is encrypted or not\n\n\n-----\n\nby CodeAnalysis it uses ReadFile and Checks for the marker as shown here\n\nIt Generates a AES-256 Key\n\n\n-----\n\nHERMES Encrypts the File in chunks it reads the files and Encrypts it\n1000000 bytes each\n\nHERMES Does Some Drive Checking using GetLogicalDrives() and\nGetDriveType()\n\n\n-----\n\nIt First Gets the Drives on the Systems and Then Calls to GetDriveType If\nReturn value of it is 5 means its (CD-ROM) it skips it.\n\nIt Also Skips Some Folders\n\n## IOC's:\n\n Hashes:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n [+] MD5:254caeddba73aa4d1bb425c5274176d2 (Packed) \n [+] SHA1:728711076a9e04b5e1e0010045e477d3515356b5\n [+]\nSHA256:a5a0964b1308fdb0aeb8bd5b2a0f306c99997c7c076d66eb3ebcdd68405b1d\n [+] MD5:4f99ef502992d9ef9be6dc4ff27b1e95 (Unpacked)\n\n## Dropped Files:\n [+] svchosta.exe (main payload) \n [+] UNIQUE_ID_DONT_REMOVE (Private RSA Key) \n [+] PUBLIC (Public RSA Key)\n [+] windows.bat (deletes shadow copies)\n [+] start.bat (starts the malware everytime the computer starts)\n [+] DECRYPT_INFORMATION.html (Ransomware Note) \n\n TTP's:\n\n```\n[[+] Command-Line Interface T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)\n\n[[+] Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder T1060](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060)\n\n[[+] Data Encrypted for Impact T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)\n\n[[+] Execution through API T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)\n\n[[+] Modify Registry T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)\n\n[[+] File Permissions Modification T1222](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222)\n\n[[+] Inhibit System Recovery T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490)\n\n[[+] Query Registry T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012)\n\n## Emails:\n```\n [+] primary email: pretty040782@gmail.com\n [+] reserve email: pretty040782@keemail.me\n\n Skipped Folders:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n[+] Windows\n[+] AhnLab\n[+] Chrome\n[+] Microsoft\n[+] Mozilla\n[+] $Recycle.Bin\n[+] WINDOWS \n\n## Ransomware Note:\n\n References:\n\n```\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/03/hermesransomware-distributed-to-south-koreans-via-recent-flash-zero-day/\n\n[https://app.any.run/tasks/29fd99e4-7087-45bc-8105-2746d44a46d9](https://app.any.run/tasks/29fd99e4-7087-45bc-8105-2746d44a46d9)\n\nhttps://analyze.intezer.com/analyses/4c6a208b-d5b6-4954-b1449254d7dfc5ac\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthvahlAYFY&t=225s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthvahlAYFY&t=225s)\n\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2009/01/15/malware-trying-to-avoidsome-countries/\n\n[https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/appendix/OSLangCodes.htm](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/appendix/OSLangCodes.htm)\n\nhttps://www.sans.org/blog/looking-at-mutex-objects-for-malwarediscovery-indicators-of-compromise/\n\n## GoodBye!\n\n\n-----\n\nSo That s It Hope u Enjoy and Thanks for AXIAL For Letting me in the\nteam we will be making more inshallah don't forget to follow\n[me astro and @AXI4L](https://twitter.com/0xastr0)\n\n### Deep Dive Into SectopRat\n\n Intro to Malware Traffic Analysis\n\n\n-----",
