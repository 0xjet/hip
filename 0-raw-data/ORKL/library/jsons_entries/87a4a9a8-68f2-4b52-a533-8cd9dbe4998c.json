Coupled with increased\nreliance on online activities during the COVID-19\npandemic, it poses a formidable challenge to security\nworldwide. What exacerbates the situation is the ‘gap’\nin law enforcement cyber capabilities within and across\nregions. This gap is a key enabler for criminal\nopportunities, networks and infrastructure.\n\nIn recognition of this challenge, INTERPOL is supporting\nits 194 member countries in enhancing their law\nenforcement capabilities and capacity to combat\ncybercrime. INTERPOL offers a number of tools,\nplatforms and operational support, with a view to connecting police and creating a safer world. In\nparticular, INTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime Programme has been pivotal in leading the global law\nenforcement response against cybercrime.\n\nPartnership has been at the heart of these efforts. Collaboration with the various actors in the global\ncybersecurity ecosystem is crucial. Their diverse views, expertise and datasets can help shape\neffective policies and operational responses to cybercrime. Partnership also allows us to pool our\nwisdom so we can be resilient and agile in times of uncertainty.\n\nLeveraging this partnership framework, INTERPOL takes a regional approach to operational\ncoordination in combating cybercrime. Although cybercrime is a global challenge, every region\nresponds differently. By understanding how the threats are evolving and what kind of harm they are\ncausing in each region, we can defeat them more effectively.\n\nWith this in mind, INTERPOL has drawn up this African Cyberthreat Assessment Report for member\ncountries in Africa. The aim is to accurately assess the threat landscape so as to be able to provide\ntailored support. The report was produced under the aegis of the African Joint Operation against\nCybercrime (AFJOC) with support from the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and\nDevelopment Office.\n\nLooking ahead, the newly-created African Cybercrime Operations Desk under the AFJOC project will\ndrive intelligence-led, coordinated actions against cybercrime and its perpetrators in African\nmember countries based on this threat assessment. To effectively support the region, INTERPOL also\nworks closely with key regional organizations such as the African Union and Afripol to maximize\ncoordination and implementation efforts in order to boost regional capabilities and capacity in the\nfight against cybercrime.\n\nI trust that this report will help close the gaps within Africa and beyond, and contribute to the\neffectiveness of the global law enforcement response. We thank the member countries in Africa and\nour partners for their strong commitment in this endeavour.\n\n**Stephen Kavanagh**\n**Executive Director of Police Services**\n**INTERPOL**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### FOREWORD\n\nThe African continent has huge potential in terms of information\nand communication technologies, especially because of the\nyouth of its population. Indeed, about 60% of the African\npopulation in 2020 is under 25 years old. This factor is driving\nstrong growth in the use of new technologies.\n\nHowever, we are also witnessing an upsurge in activities related\nto Cybercrime, especially in this COVID-19 pandemic period. The\nloss of jobs related to this pandemic and the low economic\ngrowth recorded has opened up opportunities for criminal\norganizations. Hence the special attention that the African Union\nCommission is paying to the fight against all forms of organized\ncrime: money laundering, transnational crime and cybercrime.\n\nIn terms of Internet coverage capacity and bandwidth speed, Africa remains under-served, especially\nin rural areas, yet it has the fastest-growing telephone and Internet networks in the world. On this\nyoung continent, every economic challenge generates an innovative solution that may sometimes,\nunfortunately, be at the limit of what the law allows. For example, the low rate of banking facilities\nfor African populations has led to the creation of new financial services such as mobile banking, but\nalso to the resurgence of new forms of scam linked to these new technologies.\n\nOur strategy to fight cybercrime is based on three pillars:\n\n          - Raising awareness in the populations\n\n          - The reinforcement of policy, treaty and common legislation to fight cybercriminals\n\n          - The establishment of technologies on a national scale to reinforce cyber-defence\n\nIn collaboration with INTERPOL, AFRIPOL has initiated training for national police officers in\nprotection against DNS (Domain Name Service) attacks. Also, a strategy of public-private\nrapprochement has been initiated in order to sign partnerships with Internet leaders and crypto-\ncurrency providers.\n\nThe Internet has abolished borders. A cyber-attack launched in Africa may have a direct or indirect\nimpact on any citizen anywhere in the world. This fight is a long-term one and it is by being united\nthat we will succeed in effectively defeating cybercrime in Africa and the world.\n\n**Tarek A.

INTERPOL’s Support Programme\nfor the African Union (ISPA) also contributed to this report, with the support of the German Federal\nForeign Office. The report benefited from the data and expertise of INTERPOL’s private partners,\nnamely Group-IB, Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report provides INTERPOL’s insights into key cyberthreats that are affecting the African region. It\nalso presents in-depth analysis on the impact of these threats as well as examples of INTERPOL’s\noperational support in combating cybercrime and the regional cybercrime strategy for Africa. Based\non input from the member countries in Africa and data drawn from INTERPOL’s private partners, the\nmost prominent threats were identified as below.\n\n      - **Online Scams – For African member countries, the highest-reported and most pressing**\n\ncyberthreat across the region was identified as online scamming. This threat seeks to target\nand take advantage of victims’ fears, insecurities, and vulnerabilities through phishing, mass\nmailing and social engineering. Member countries have reported a sharp increase in the\nnumber of online banking scams, including instances of banking and credit card fraud.\n      - **Digital Extortion – This threat is also identified as one of the most prominent cyberthreats**\n\nwithin the region. Digital extortion seeks to target individuals with either allegations of sexually\ncompromising images or through direct blackmail campaigns. While such threats are not new\non the threat landscape, the move towards a digital society – particularly within the African\nregion – has created new attack vectors for criminals to both obfuscate their identity and\ntarget new victims.\n      - **Business Email Compromise – Alongside online scams, Business Email Compromise (BEC) was**\n\nidentified as a significant concern and threat to the region. Businesses and organizations that\nrely heavily on wire transfer transactions are vulnerable to this threat in Africa. The COVID-19\npandemic has contributed to the increase in this type of cybercrime.\n      - **Ransomware – The threat of ransomware is expanding across the African continent. Allegedly,**\n\nmore than 61% of companies in this region were affected by ransomware in 2020 alone.[1] These\nattacks targeted some African countries’ critical infrastructure, including healthcare and\nmaritime sectors.[2]\n      - **Botnets – Botnets are networks of compromised machines used as a tool to automate large-**\n\nscale campaigns such as DDoS attacks, phishing, malware distribution, etc. The number of\nbotnet victim detections in Africa was around 50,000, with a monthly average detection of\n3,900. In Africa, there have been numerous high-profile instances of such DDoS attacks on\ncritical infrastructure within the past five years.\n\nRecognizing the need for a change in the approach to cybercrime within Africa as a region that is\nembracing digital transformation, the report concludes with INTERPOL’s regional cybercrime strategy\nto support member countries in Africa. The strategy encompasses the four strategic objectives below:\n\n      - **Enhancing cybercrime intelligence for effective responses to cybercrime;**\n      - **Strengthening cooperation for joint operations against cybercrime;**\n      - **Developing regional capacity and capabilities to combat cybercrime;**\n      - **Promoting good cyber hygiene for a safer cyberspace.**\n\nINTERPOL stands ready to support African member countries in fulfilling these objectives and further\ndeveloping a joint operational framework to improve coordinated actions against cybercrime in Africa.\nCollective efforts in sharing intelligence and formulating a joint operational framework will boost\nregional capabilities and capacity in the fight against cybercrime.\n\n1 Lumu, 2020 Ransomware Flashcard, Available at: [https://lumu.io/resources/2020-ransomware-flashcard/]\n2 Institute for security Studies, Africa can’t risk a major maritime cyber-attack.

INTRODUCTION\n\nAfrica has more than 500 million Internet users, placing the region ahead of other regions such as\nNorth America, South America, and the Middle East.[3] This volume of users relative to population\nequates to about 38%, which implies the number is expected to grow in the coming years, given the\naccelerated digitalization. The leading countries are Kenya with 83% of its population being online,\nNigeria with 60% and South Africa with 56%.[3] Mobile banking in particular is noted to be used widely\nwithin these three countries, contributing to Africa’s active role in digital financial services.[4] It poses a\nsignificant future threat, with\nthe rise in malicious apps on\nmobile devices exploiting\nincreasing vulnerabilities.\n\nDespite the high demand for\nonline mobile banking, the\ndigital divide remains a\nchallenge, especially as the\nmember countries in Africa move forward to incorporate digital infrastructure into the foundations of\ntheir society, including government, banking, business and critical infrastructure. This transformation\nhighlights the urgent need to ensure cybersecurity parameters and standards meet the demands and\nfuture needs of this community, including financial inclusion.[5]\n\nHowever, the absence of these standards is pervasive in Africa. 90% of African businesses are operating\nwithout the necessary cybersecurity protocols in place.[6] Without these protocols, threat actors are\nable to exploit increasing vulnerabilities as they continue to invent new cyberattack vectors. This leads\nto significant financial loss. In 2016, cybercrime has cost the Kenyan economy about 36 million USD,\nthe South African economy 573 million USD and the Nigerian economy 500 million USD.[7] A research\nstudy from Deloitte indicated the financial loss for financial institutions in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda,\nTanzania, and Zambia since 2011 to be more than 245 million USD.\n\n###### “More than 90% of African businesses are operating without\n the necessary cyber security protocols in place.”\n\nSource: CGTN\n\nIn the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the cybercrime ecosystem,[8] with a persisting\ndigital divide and increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities across the region.

This was most prominently seen in South Africa and Botswana. For instance, South Africa’s\nLife Healthcare Group, responsible for managing 66 health facilities, was hit by a serious and sustained\ncyberattack.[9]\n\nIndeed, the growing rate of digital\ntransformation within the African region\nis facilitating the emergence of new\nattack vectors and opportunities for\ncybercriminals. In recognition of the\nmagnitude of the problem caused by\ncyberthreats in Africa, the next section\nprovides in-depth analysis on the\ncybercrime threat landscape in Africa.\n\nResearch from a Kenyan IT cybersecurity\ncompany, Serianu, highlighted that\ncybercrime reduced GDP within Africa by\nmore than 10%, at a cost of an estimated\n4.12 billion USD in 2021.[10] INTERPOL’s\npartner, Trend Micro, recorded millions\nof threat detections in Africa from\nJanuary 2020 to February 2021:\n\n      - Email: 679 million detections\n\nFigure 1. Overall detection of cyber threats in Africa\n\n      - Files: 8.2 million detections\n\nusing Trend Micro sensors (Source: Trend Micro)\n\n      - Web: 14.3 million detections\n\nMore specifically, South Africa had 230 million threat detections in total, while Kenya had 72 million\nand Morocco 71 million. In South Africa, 219 million detections were related to email threats.\nSouth Africa also had the highest targeted ransomware and BEC attempts.\n\nThe exploitation of these vulnerabilities within South Africa was further highlighted by Accenture, who\nidentified that South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide, at a cost of\nR2.2 billion a year.[11] The scale of this cyber criminality is further evidenced when we consider that the\ncountry has seen a 100% increase in mobile banking application fraud and is estimated to suffer\n577 malware attacks an hour.[12] Such malware attacks are one of the emerging threats.\n\nWith the diversified and evolving attack vectors and the targeted approach against frontline response\norganizations, global supply chains and critical infrastructure, there has never been a more crucial time\nto both chart a way forward and ensure that efforts are focused on improving security and safety in\ncyberspace for all African member countries.\n\n9 Cybercrime Magazine, Cybercrime To Cost The World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025, Morgan, S.,\n\n13 November 2020.

INTERPOL has also received relevant data from its private partners including Group-IB,\nKaspersky, Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro. The collected information has been combined with\ninternal detections and analysis by INTERPOL Cybercrime Directorate, and an open-source review of\ninformation, data and assessments relevant to this region. This multi-stakeholder approach has\nformulated a comprehensive assessment of the cyberthreat landscape within the region.\n\nThe creation of the AFJOC project in March 2021 was a catalyst for developing this report in terms of\noutreach and coordination with INTERPOL’s African member countries. Based on the assessment\nresult, the AFJOC project will develop an operational framework within the region to provide a\nframework for consideration by member countries when developing governance policies, roles and\nresponsibilities, procedures, communications and capacity development. In delivering this,\ncollaboration with the key regional organizations is crucial, such as The African Union and Afripol. The\nISPA project underpins these relationships, collaborations and potential synergies.

KEY CYBERTHREATS IN AFRICA\n\n 2.1 Online Scams\n\n What are\n\nOnline scams encompass various types of fraud in cyberspace.\n\n### online They range from, inter alia, phishing, credit card theft,\n\nidentity theft, advance payment fraud, card-not-present\n\n### scams?\n\n(CNP) fraud and cryptocurrency scams. They typically seek to\nexploit victims’ fears, insecurities or vulnerabilities while using\nnumerous tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) online.\nComplex organized crime groups often run bespoke sophisticated\nmalware tools to make illicit financial gains from unsuspecting victims.\n\nThe most common type of online scam is phishing. It can be facilitated by emails, SMS, phone calls or\na phishing kit.[13] For banking and credit card fraud, threat actors exploit the\nvulnerabilities of unpatched banking systems or individuals, using\nsocial engineering tactics to obtain credit card information or\naccess to online banking information. According to\nKaspersky, phishing emails may leverage\nscenarios such as delivery, postal, financial and\nHR services, convincing victims to open\nmalicious attachments or click on malicious\nlinks.[14]\n\nOnline scammers also set up malicious\ndomains to facilitate fraudulent\nactivities. They may make use of mass\nphishing tools or kits. Online\nscamming is a cost-effective strategy\nadopted by threat actors, as there\nare minimal technical\nrequirements and low start-up\ncosts.\n\n13 A phishing kit is a tool purchased by one threat actor from another to allow for mass facilitation of phishing\n\ncampaigns.\n14 Kaspersky, The year of social distancing or social engineering?

Available at: [https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-\nreleases/2020_the-year-of-social-distancing-or-social-engineering]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Situation in Africa\n\nAccording to African member countries, the most prevalent and pressing cyberthreat is online scams.\nIn particular, banking and credit card fraud is recognized as a serious threat in Africa. It involves the\ntheft of personal data and banking details which are then used by a threat actor to either purchase\ngoods, siphon funds or sell on markets. Coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the\ncybercrime landscape, Africa saw a sustained increase in the volume of cyberattacks,[15] including the\n238% rise in cyberattacks on online banking platforms in 2020.[16]\n\nAt the same time, threat actors in Africa are deploying Trojan information stealers such as Agent Tesla,\nLokibot, Fareit and others to commit online scams. Many cybercriminals offer toolkits as a service and\ntraining available online has contributed to the continuous operations and development of\ncybercriminals.\n\n**Phishing,**\n\nConsidering the **Others, 10%**\n\n**1.89%**\n\n**Adware, 4%**\n\nbroader online\nscam situation\n\n**CnC Server, 3%**\n\nacross the African\nregion, data\nreceived from **Malware**\nTrend Micro **Accomplice,**\nindicates that 27% **Online Scams,** **54%**\n\n**27%**\n\nof its web threat\ndetection in Africa\nrelated to online\nscams in May 2021,\nas shown in Figure\n2 below.\n\nFigure 2. Top Web Threat Detection in Africa in May 2021 only (Source: Trend Micro)\n\nThe South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) evidenced that “gross fraud losses on\nSouth African issued cards increased by 20.5% from 2018 to 2019” with CNP fraud and banking\nmalware attacks, behind only Russia.[17] Yet this number fails to take into account the influx of COVID-19\nrelated phishing attempts and the financial, emotional and mental impact they have on victims. Stolen\ndata from carding scams is auctioned off to the highest bidder or sold within underground forums –\nmeaning unsuspecting victims of credit card fraud in the African region may have their credit card\ninformation misused globally following the breach.\n\n15 INTERPOL, INTERPOL report shows alarming rate of cyberattacks during COVID-19, 4 August 2020. Available\n\nat: [https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-\ncyberattacks-during-COVID-19]\n16 Institute for security Studies, Africa can’t risk a major maritime cyberattack, Reva, D., 28 October 2020.\n\nAvailable at: [https://issAfrica.org/iss-today/Africa-cant-risk-a-major-maritime-cyberattack]\n17 Accenture, Insight Into The Cyber Threat landscape in South Africa, 2020. Available at:\n\n[https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-125/Accenture-Insight-Into-The-Threat-Landscape-Of-South-\nAfrica-V5.pdf]\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the KnowBe4 African Report 2019[18] with over 800 respondents across South Africa,\nKenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, Morocco, Mauritius and Botswana, phishing was one of the top cyber\nthreats faced by the African region. 28.14% of respondents reported that they had previously clicked\non a phishing email, 27.71% had previously fallen for a scam, and 19% had forwarded a spam or hoax\nemail. INTERPOL’s private partner Kaspersky detected that South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, Rwanda\nand Ethiopia had about 2 million phishing attempts in 2020 alone.[19]\n\nAnother growing concern for African member countries is cryptocurrency scams, in which threat actors\nseek to defraud victims of their cryptocurrency. An ISS report has highlighted two examples of\ncryptocurrency investment scams in South Africa.[20] These examples involved, firstly, a Ponzi scheme\nwhere thousands of investors were allegedly scammed out of 588 million USD in Bitcoin by the\ncompany Mirror Trading International in 2020. The second case was where the two founders of the\ntrading company Africrypt allegedly absconded with 3.6 billion USD from investors in April 2021.\n\nSouth Africa was therefore one of the top ten countries globally where threat actors received the\nhighest volume of cryptocurrency from illicit addresses. In addition to investment scams, a growing\nthreat in the cryptocurrency space is that of wallet phishing, where threat actors utilize false or\nmisleading advertisements, imposter domains, fake wallet or decentralized finance platforms to obtain\na victim’s cryptocurrency wallet private keys, thus enabling them to steal funds from the victim’s\naccounts.\n\n18 Knowbe4, African Cybersecurity Research Report, 2019.

It involves\n### digital threat actors coercing individuals with either false claims or\n\nproof of stolen personal data or files, for which the victim is\nthen asked to pay in exchange for recovering the data or not\n\n### extortion?\n\nleaking it online. More specifically, sextortion threat actors utilize\nphishing and blackmail across multiple platforms to get money from\ntheir victims, with claims that they have obtained compromising sexual\nimages or the sexual browsing history of their victim.\n\nINTERPOL’s analysis identified the most common modus operandi for digital extortion as being where\nthreat actors rent Virtual Private Servers (VPS) with a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service to\nlaunch bulk extortion emails. Within these digital extortion emails, threat actors often claim to have\ncompromised the security of the victims’ computers, files or history.\n\nCyber blackmail can also be combined with social engineering techniques that seek to research their\nvictims and take advantage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that victims leave online in social\nmedia posts, or from previous data breaches that have been released on either open or dark Web\nforums, as threat actors use increasingly sophisticated techniques to create personalized extortion\nmessages for each victim.\n\nSimilarly, the modus operandi for sextortion can also involve false claims about access to individuals’\nwebcams or browsing history, and then be followed up with demands for payment in crypto to prevent\nthis information being leaked to close friends or publicly. While such claims are often mass-produced,\nsextortion activities have also\nbeen detected in apps, where\nthreat actors will trick\nunsuspecting victims, who are\nusually male, to pre-record or send\nvideos of themselves performing\nsex acts to what they believe are\nfemales, with the threat actors\nthen threatening to release the\nfootage unless the victim pays a\nfinancial sum.[21]\n\n(Graphic Source: Financial Post)\n\n21 Trend Micro and INTERPOL, Cybercrime in West Africa; Poised for an Underground Market, 2017.

Cybercriminals\n\n### Business typically compromise or spoof a legitimate email account to send\n\nfraudulent emails requesting transfer of funds or sensitive\n\n### Email\n\ndata while posing as the legitimate owner of the email\n\n### Compromise? account.\n\nCybercriminals usually target high-level executives working in finance\nor involved with wire transfer payments. They compromise the\ncorporate email accounts of such employees via methods such as\nkeylogging or phishing attacks, or simply spoof their emails to appear as though\nit is sent from the target’s legitimate email account. Fraudulent emails are then sent from these email\naccounts with an established level of trust to other employees or related individuals, asking them to\ntransfer funds or data to a specific bank account. The three types of BEC scam are illustrated in the\ndiagrams below, developed by Trend Micro.\n\n**Bogus Invoice Scheme**\n_The Bogus Invoice Scheme usually involves a business that has an established_\n_relationship with a supplier. The fraudster asks for invoice payment monies to be wired_\n_to an alternative, fraudulent account via a spoofed email, telephone, or fax message._\n\n**CEO Fraud**\n_In CEO Fraud, the fraudsters identify themselves as high-level executives (CFO, CEO,_\n_CTO, etc.), lawyers, or other types of legal representative, and purport to be handling_\n_confidential or time-sensitive matters and initiate a wire transfer to an account they_\n_control. In some cases, the fraudulent request for wire transfer is sent directly to the_\n_financial institution with instructions to urgently send funds to a bank. This scam is also_\n_known as “CEO Fraud”, “Business Executive Scam”, “Masquerading”, and “Financial_\n_Industry Wire Fraud”._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Account Compromise**\n_In Account Compromise cases, an employee’s email account is hacked and then used_\n_to make requests for invoice payments to fraudster-controlled bank accounts._\n_Messages are sent to multiple vendors identified from the employee’s contact list. The_\n_business may not become aware of the scheme until their vendors follow up to check_\n_the status of the invoice payment._\n\nTo assist individuals and organizations further in avoiding BEC, the FBI has also published a list of red\nflags and tips for recognizing and preventing such BEC attempts (see Table 1).\n\nBe sceptical of last-minute changes to\n\nUnexplained urgency\n\nwiring instructions or recipient account\ninformation.\n\nVerify any changes of information via\nthe contact on file—do not contact the\n\nLast-minute changes to wire\n\nvendor through the number provided\n\ninstructions or recipient account\n\nin the email.\n\ninformation\n\nEnsure the URL in emails is associated\n\nLast-minute changes to established\n\nwith the business it claims to be from.\n\ncommunication platforms or email\naccount addresses\n\nBe alert to hyperlinks that may contain\n\nLast-minute changes to established\n\nmisspellings of the actual domain\n\ncommunication platforms or email\n\nname.\n\naccount addresses\n\nVerify the email address used to send\n\nCommunications only in email and\n\nemails, especially when using a mobile\n\nrefusal to communicate via\n\nor handheld device, by ensuring the\n\ntelephone or online voice or video\n\nsender’s email address appears to\n\nplatforms\n\nmatch who it is coming from.\n\nBe wary of last-minute changes to\n\nRequests for advanced payment of\n\nwiring instructions or recipient account\n\nservices when not previously\n\ninformation.\n\nrequired\n\nTable 1: Red flags and best practice and tips for avoiding BEC scams (Source: FBI)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Situation in Africa\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, the proportion of BEC attempts on victims in Africa from 2020 to April 2021\nwas less than 1% of global BEC attempts. The top BEC attempts are in English-speaking countries such\nas the United States, Australia and the UK. As BEC cybercriminals usually target larger corporations\nwhich will potentially lead to bigger pay-outs, the likely reason for the lower proportion of BEC\nattempts in Africa is the relatively smaller concentration of large businesses and corporations there.\n\nHowever, there are several offshore companies based in Africa, and the COVID-19 pandemic situation\ncontributed to the increase in this type of cybercrime. Their employees rely heavily on wire transfer\ntransactions, opening up more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit. Within Africa, it was mainly\ndetected in countries like South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritius, Nigeria and Kenya (see Figure 4).\n\n#### BEC Attempts\n\n**Gabon** **Central African**\n\n**1%** **Republic**\n\n**Kenya** **1%BEC Attempts**\n\n**Nigeria** **9%**\n\n**South Africa**\n\n**11%**\n\n**34%**\n\n**Mauritius**\n\n**12%**\n\n**Morocco**\n\n**12%** **Tunisia**\n\n**20%**\n\nSouth Africa Tunisia Morocco Mauritius Nigeria Kenya Gabon Central African Republic\n\nFigure 4. BEC Attempts in Africa (Source: Trend Micro)\n\nThis figure is likely to rise, given the strong potential and positive economic projections for the African\nregion. In addition, 2020 statistics showed that African countries dominated the ranking of countries\nwith the highest GDP growth worldwide.[22] Although COVID-19 slowed GDP growth significantly, the\neconomic fundamentals are still in place and demonstrate the possibility that BEC actors might\nincreasingly target the region in the hope of higher pay-outs in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2020 report from Agari’s Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID) stressed that a majority (60%)\nof BEC actors globally were located in Africa, across 11 countries in the region. The report also found\nthat “83% percent of African attackers, as well as 50% of global BEC actors, hailed from Nigeria”.[23]\n\n22 Statista.

BEC Actor Distribution within Africa (Source: Agari)\n\nIn response to the detected high concentration of BEC actors within the Nigerian region, INTERPOL,\nalongside its private partner Group-IB and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF), launched the successful\n“Operation Falcon”, which severely disrupted a prolific BEC group and led to three arrests. This\nproactive law enforcement action was also followed up with the arrest of another prominent group of\nNigerian BEC actors in March 2021 after an investigation by the Nigerian Economic and Financial\nCrimes Commission.[24]\n\nIn September 2019, a month-long operation entitled “rewired”, led by the FBI, disrupted and\ndismantled BEC schemes. It resulted in 281 arrests in Nigeria, Turkey, Ghana, France, Italy, Japan,\nKenya, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States. It also successfully seized nearly\n3.7 million USD and\nrecovered about 118 million\nUSD in fraudulent wire\ntransfers.[25] This operation\nwas another example that\ndemonstrated the\nimportance of international\npolice cooperation to\neffectively fight against\ntransitional BEC schemes.\n\n24 Recorded Future, Suspected BEC gang arrested in Nigeria amid internet fraud crackdown efforts, 2021.\n\nAvailable at: [https://therecord.media/suspected-bec-gang-arrested-in-nigeria-amid-internet-fraud-\ncrackdown-efforts/]\n25 FBI, Worldwide Sweep Targets Business Email Compromise, 10 September 2019.

The\n\n###### What is a\n\nbot network can be used to send spam, launch Distributed\n\n### botnet? Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and may be rented out to\n\nother cybercriminals. Botnets can also be an entry point for\nransomware attacks. Any machine that can connect to the Internet\ncan be compromised and turned into a device in a botnet, such as\ncomputers, mobile devices, internet infrastructure hardware such as\nnetwork routers, and increasingly, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices such as\nsmart home devices.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, there are three stages to building a botnet:[26]\n\n**PREP & EXPOSE** **The victim device is** **ACTIVATE**\n\n###### infected with malware that can take control of it\n\n The hacker exploits a Hackers mobilize all vulnerability to expose the infected devices to\n victim device to malware INFECT carry out attacks\n\nUpon activation, hackers send commands and control the botnet from a main server, known as the\nCommand & Control (C&C) server. Older C&C models use a centralized C&C server where all commands\nare sent from. However, since this reduces the anonymity of the hackers, as their C&C servers can be\ntraced, newer C&C models now use a decentralized peer-to-peer model where the hackers can send\nand spread commands to the entire botnet via any of the bots, thus concealing their identity.\n\n26 Kaspersky, What is a Botnet? Available at: [https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/botnet-\n\nattacks]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. An overview of a botnet attack (Source: Kaspersky)\n\n###### Situation in Africa\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, the victims of botnets in Africa average 3,900 detections monthly, with\nroughly 50,000 detections in total. Several threat actors in Africa are deploying spam run campaigns\nwith enclosed Trojan stealers such as Emotet, Lokibot, Agent Tesla, Fareit, etc. Surprisingly, Namibia\n[had the highest detections of Emotet, although it subsided after global efforts to disrupt the Emotet](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/the-emotet-shutdown-explained/)\n[botnet early this year. Other top malware detections are backdoor web shells and Dorkbot that is able](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/the-emotet-shutdown-explained/)\nto spread via removable drives, e-mail and social media.\n\nCybercriminals are recruiting new members by training and introducing several cybercrime toolkits.\nThis has been one of the reasons for the expansion of DDoS operations of this type with cybercrime as\na service available through the open and dark Web environments. The expansion of online\ncommunication platforms has provided a learning environment for cybercriminals to develop and\nenhance their skills, learn and exchange information on cybercrime toolkits, and even share their\nlessons learnt, stolen data and successful exploits with other individuals.\n\nThere have been many high-profile instances of such DDoS attacks on critical infrastructure in Africa\nin the past five years. For example, the 2016 Mirai botnet DDoS attack on Liberia crippled the internet\ninfrastructure of the entire country, with attacks of over 500 gigabytes-per-second (Gbps), then among\nthe largest DDoS attacks ever.[27] More recently, in September 2019, a large South African Internet\nService Provider (ISP) was also the victim of a DDoS attack which brought it down for an entire day.[28]\n\nSimilarly, in October 2019 and 2020, South African banks also experienced a sustained wave of DDoS\nattacks, though no significant damage was reported. Although there have been no significant recent\ncyber incidents arising from DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks remain a concerning threat that organizations\nin Africa will need to guard against.\n\n27 ZDNET, 'Carpet-bombing' DDoS attack takes down South African ISP for an entire day.

Ransomware\n\n###### What is\n\nactors subsequently demand a ransom, usually in\n\n### Ransomware? cryptocurrency for anonymity, in exchange for decrypting\n\nthe data. It should be noted that the deployment of\nransomware code onto an organization’s network follows a\nlegitimate (trusted insider) or illegitimate breach of that network,\nexploration of the network by cybercriminals, and the theft of\norganizational information and data. The deployment of ransomware is\ngenerally the final phase of a successful hack or penetration on that organization.\n\nWith TTPs becoming ever more sophisticated, the facilitation of ransomware attacks by organized\ncrime groups has expanded to include double and triple extortions – where the initial ransomware\nattack is compounded by the theft of sensitive company data, ransom demands from victims with the\nthreat of publicly shaming them through the release of stolen information and the re-exploitation of\npreviously-exposed vulnerabilities within organizations to leave them facing a never-ending cycle of\nransomware attacks.\n\nCapable of bringing governments, business and supply chains to a grinding halt, the impact of\nransomware attacks also has a reputational impact on victims alongside the economic impact, with\nthe latter evidenced in research from INTERPOL’s private partner, Palo Alto Networks, showing that\nthe average ransomware payment has accelerated to more than 300,000 USD.[29]\n\nThis impact is further compounded when we consider the growing adoption of the TTP by organized\ncrime groups which results in key files and backups being deleted, adding to the estimated average\ndowntime of 21 days for each ransomware attack[30]. With research suggesting a ransomware attack\noccurs every 11\nseconds, and given the\npreviously-highlighted\ncyber vulnerabilities\nwithin the African\nregion, the need for\nboth a thorough\nunderstanding of the\nransomware situation\nwithin Africa and\nimplementation of the\nprevent and protect\nprinciples has never\nbeen more urgent.\n\n29 Palo Alto Networks, Extortion Payments Hit New Records as Ransomware Crisis Intensifies, Baylor, Brown\n\nand Martineau, August 2021.

One example is the notorious ransomware Nefilim, where it affects\nbanking and government sectors.\n\n31 Checkpoint, The New Ransomware Threat: Triple Extortion, 2020.

Targeted ransomware in Africa, unique detections and selected families (Source: Trend Micro)\n\nAccording to Figure 6 above, South Africa was the country most heavily affected by targeted\nransomware in the first quarter of 2021, with a variety of families such as Crysis, Nefilim, Ryuk, Clop,\nand Conti ransomware. Subsequently, Egypt was the next hardest-hit country with a similar profile of\ntargeted ransomware detection. Tunisia was the third most affected country, targeted mainly with\nEgregor (before its shutdown in February 2021), Ryuk, and Sekhmet ransomware.\n\nFigure 7. Industries affected by ransomware in Africa from January 1 to April 2021 (Source: Trend Micro)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe industries most affected in Africa are the government and food-and-beverage sectors, according\nto Trend Micro (see Figure 7). It has been observed that the reason the Wannacry ransomware is so\nprevalent in the government sector is that many machines have not been patched for the vulnerability\nin the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is a known target of Wannacry ransomware.\n\nMeanwhile, there is also a variety of old ransomware families like Cerber, Gandcrab, Locky, Cryptesla\nthat target the government, food-and-beverage, and manufacturing sectors. However, one notable\nexception is the newer and notorious Nefilim ransomware, discovered in March 2020,[33] which is\ntargeting the banking industry in the Africa Region.\n\nSince ransomware actors are profit-driven, the problem will persist globally as long as victim\norganizations are willing or forced to pay ransoms. According to the Brookings Institution in March\n2021, cyber threats in Africa are exacerbated by vulnerabilities in public cybersecurity strategies and\nthe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.[34]\n\n## “Cybercriminals are developing and boosting their attacks at an alarming pace, exploiting the fear and uncertainty caused by the unstable social and economic situation created by COVID-19.”\n\n###### Jürgen Stock, INTERPOL Secretary General \n\n33 Trend Micro, An Analysis of the Nefilim Ransomware.

It is believed to have cost the organization more than a month\nin downtime in the midst of the pandemic.\n\n        - There were the twin attacks in October 2020, where firstly key social services in Johannesburg,\nincluding bill payments, social advice and the emergency services network were impacted and\nshut down following a data breach and then deployment of ransomware. Analysis of the\nattack identified not only the exploitation of a vulnerability, but also that after employing\nlateral movement techniques the threat actors deliberately deployed their ransomware to\ncoincide with the “end of the month” payment cycle – in an effort to further coerce South\nAfrican authorities to pay the cryptocurrency ransom.[33]\n\n        - In Kenya, an attack targeted the markets and interconnected cyber systems, with INTERPOL\nwarning that the threat of supply chain attacks may well define the cyber threat landscape\nover the coming decade. High-profile attacks on supply chains, with the compromise of the\nKaseya IT service by the ransomware group REVIL[34] are particularly affecting customers in\nKenya.\n\n        - There was a DDoS attack on South African banks – again timed to hit and disable services at\nthe “end of the month” payment cycle. This was launched against several major banks across\nSouth Africa – with a ransom again demanded in cryptocurrency. While the reported damage\nfrom this attack was minimal and caused only disruption to services, the conjunction of this\nattack with the simultaneous ransomware attack in Johannesburg emphasizes the scale,\nimpact and seriousness of the threat to critical infrastructure across the African region.\n\n        - The State-owned Transnet organization in South Africa faced an unprecedented cyberattack\nin July 2021, which resulted in severe disruption to its services.[35] The Institute for Security\nStudies (ISS) highlighted that “first time the integrity of South Africa’s critical maritime\ninfrastructure has been severely disrupted” with an attack on the port able to delay or shut\ndown a critical trade route and disrupt vital trade services in the middle of a global pandemic.\nThe attack is believed to have suspended the automated and online container-handling facility\nin both Cape Town and Durban – with the Durban port being the busiest port in sub-Saharan\nAfrica and a maritime hub for the movement of essential goods between other African\ncountries, including Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nFigure 8. The major publicly documented critical Incidents in Africa 2020-2021\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. OPERATIONAL SUCCESS\n\nUnder its mandate of reducing the global impact of cybercrime and protecting communities for a safer\nworld, the INTERPOL Cybercrime Directorate delivers policing capabilities to all member countries\nthrough the Global Cybercrime Programme. The Global Cybercrime Programme has three core pillars,\nnamely: (i) Cybercrime Threat Response, (ii) Cyber Strategy and Capabilities Development, and\n(iii) Cybercrime Operations.\n\nThe Cybercrime Threat Response pillar identifies, triages and coordinates a global response to\ncyberthreats in a targeted and focused manner, leveraging private partners’ expertise and cybercrime\ndata. It focuses on intelligence development of identified threats to design disruption-and-prevention\nstrategies that mitigate high-risk and high-impact cyberthreats. It also aims to provide quality advice\nand guidance on the current threat landscape, as well as operational support through the provision of\nactionable intelligence.\n\nThe Cyber Strategy and Capabilities Development pillar supports member countries by developing\ncyber skills, knowledge and technical capabilities that are customized to their needs, in line with\nINTERPOL standards. In collaboration with its stakeholders, the team plans, develops and delivers\ncyber capability and capacity-building projects and programmes, as well as tools and platforms, to\nenhance member countries’ ability to tackle cybercrime globally.\n\nThe Cybercrime Operations pillar leads and coordinates transnational operational activities with\nmember countries in tackling cyberthreats that cause significant harm on a national, regional and\nglobal scale. In close cooperation with member countries, the public-private sector and national\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT) communities, it conducts operational activities targeting\nhigh-impact cybercrime through the ‘Regional Cybercrime Operations Desk’ approach.\n\nIn May 2021, INTERPOL launched a new Regional Cybercrime Operations Desk to boost the capacity of\n49 African countries to fight cybercrime under the framework of the AFJOC project. This African\nCybercrime Operations Desk will help shape a regional strategy to drive intelligence-led coordinated\nactions against cybercriminals and support joint operations. The two operations highlighted below\nhave provided timely and effective operational support to member countries in Africa.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.2 Operation Lyrebird\n\nIn July 2021, an alleged prolific cybercriminal was apprehended in Morocco following a joint two-year\ninvestigation by INTERPOL, the Moroccan police and Group-IB. Acting under the pseudonym ‘Dr Hex’,\nthe suspect is believed to have targeted thousands of unsuspecting victims over several years through\nglobal phishing, fraud and carding activities involving credit card fraud.\n\nHe is also accused of defacing numerous websites by modifying their appearance and content, and\ntargeting French-speaking communications companies, multiple banks and multinational companies\nwith malware campaigns. The suspect is also alleged to have helped develop carding and phishing kits,\nwhich were then sold to other individuals through online forums to allow them to facilitate similar\nmalicious campaigns against victims.\n\nThese were then used to impersonate online banking facilities, allowing the suspect and others to steal\nsensitive information and defraud trusting individuals for financial gain, with the losses of individuals\nand companies published online in order to advertise these malicious services.\n\nUnder Operation Lyrebird, INTERPOL’s Cybercrime Directorate worked closely with Group-IB and with\nthe Moroccan Police via the INTERPOL National Central Bureau in Rabat to eventually locate and\napprehend the individual, who remains under investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.3 Operation Falcon\n\nUnder ‘Operation Falcon’, three suspects were arrested in Lagos in November 2020 following a joint\nINTERPOL, Group-IB and Nigerian Police Force cybercrime investigation. The Nigerian nationals are\nbelieved to be members of a wider organized crime group responsible for distributing malware,\ncarrying out phishing campaigns and extensive BEC scams.\n\nThe suspects are alleged to have developed phishing links, domains, and mass-mailing campaigns in\nwhich they impersonated representatives of organizations. They then used these campaigns to\ndisseminate 26 malware programs, spyware and remote access tools, including Agent Tesla, Loki,\nAzorult, Spartan and the Nanocore and Remcos Remote Access Trojans. These programs were used to\ninfiltrate and monitor the systems of victim organizations and individuals, before launching scams and\nsyphoning funds.\n\nAccording to Group-IB, the prolific gang is believed to have compromised government and private\nsector companies in more than 150 countries since 2017. The year-long investigation saw INTERPOL’s\nCybercrime Directorate and Financial Crime units work closely with Group-IB to identify and locate\nthreats and, ultimately, assist the Nigerian Police Force via the INTERPOL National Central Bureau in\nAbuja, in taking swift action.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4. INTERPOL’S REGIONAL CYBERCRIME STRATEGY FOR AFRICA\n\nINTERPOL provides a regional cybercrime strategy for Africa which underpins the operational\nframework of the African Cybercrime Operations Desk. In support of the activities of this Desk, the\nstrategy encompasses four strategic objectives, outlined below.\n\n###### Strategic Objective 2: \n Strategic Objective 1: Strengthening cooperation for joint Enhancing cybercrime intelligence operations against cybercrime  for effective responses to cybercrime\n\n Strategic Objective 3:\n Strategic Objective 4:\n Developing regional capabilities\n Promoting good cyber hygiene and\n and capacity to combat\n resilience for a safer cyberspace\n cybercrime effectively\n\n\n-----\n\nThe African Cybercrime Operations Desk under the AFJOC project will address cybercrime in support\nof the African region through the following strategic pillars:\n\n      - **[Objective 1] Enhancing cybercrime intelligence for effective responses to cybercrime**\n\nWithin the partnership framework of Gateway, INTERPOL will collaborate with private entities\nto request and receive up-to-date information related to cybercrime threats, trends and risks\nin the African region. By processing and analysing information using external tools and those\ndeveloped in-house, INTERPOL will deepen its understanding of the cybercrime threat\nlandscape, generating timely and accurate cyber intelligence and threat responses for African\nmember countries.\n\n      - **[Objective 2] Strengthening cooperation for joint operations against cybercrime**\n\nIn close cooperation with member countries, private partners and national Computer\nEmergency Response Team (CERT) communities, INTERPOL will strengthen cooperation and\nincrease joint operations targeting high-impact cybercrime through the African Cybercrime\nOperations Desk.\n\n      - **[Objective 3] Developing regional capacity and capabilities to combat cybercrime**\n\nIn collaboration with its stakeholders, INTERPOL will plan, develop and deliver cyber capability and\ncapacity-building projects and programmes to enhance member countries’ ability to tackle\ncybercrime in Africa. As part of this effort, it will maximize the use of tools and platforms\nincluding the Cybercrime Knowledge Exchange, Cybercrime Collaborative Platform –\nOperations, and Cyber Fusion Platform.\n\n      - **[Objective 4] Promoting good cyber hygiene for a safer cyberspace**\n\nINTERPOL will run a global awareness campaign with the aim of raising public awareness of the\nkey cyberthreats and promoting good cyber hygiene for individuals and businesses in Africa.\nThis campaign will also support regional law enforcement mitigation and prevention efforts\ntargeting the top cyberthreats, for better operational outcomes.\n\nThe African Cybercrime Operations Desk acts as a conduit between law enforcement communities in\nAfrica and the private sector to achieve these objectives and further develop the operational\nframework to improve coordinated actions against cybercrime in Africa.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CONCLUSION\n\nThis African Cyberthreat Assessment Report 2021 has detailed the context and analysis of the\ncybercrime threat landscape in Africa, focusing on the top five threats. These threats are affecting\nother regions equally, confirming the borderless nature of cybercrime. The unique challenge for Africa\nappears to be the critical absence of cybersecurity protocol, cyber resilience as well as mitigation and\nprevention measures for individuals and businesses. As a region that is embracing digital\ntransformation, Africa needs to invest extensively in improving the safety and security of cyberspace.\n\nThe report also underlined how INTERPOL is supporting its member countries in addressing\ncyberthreats by coordinating cybercrime operations that have led to successful identification and\napprehension of threat actors in collaboration with its private partners. The result of this assessment\nmay encourage member countries to prioritize and allocate resources to address cybercrime, in order\nto increase such operational activities and achieve better outcomes.\n\nGiven the fast-evolving and transnational nature of cybercrime, it is evident that cybercrime can only\nbe tackled effectively through a coordinated and rapid response. Intelligence gathering and sharing is\na vital component in achieving an effective law enforcement response. INTERPOL is equipped with the\nintelligence capability hosted within its Cybercrime Threat Response team and through the\nestablishment of the African Cybercrime Operations Desk.\n\nIn this context, member countries should leverage and maximize the use of police-level cooperation\nthrough INTERPOL’s channels, platforms and capabilities for a timely and effective response. Collective\nefforts in sharing intelligence and formulating a joint operational framework will boost the regional\ncapabilities and capacity in the fight against cybercrime. With this in mind, this report also suggested\na regional cybercrime strategy for Africa which will serve as a basis for the joint operational framework\nto be developed for Africa.\n\nLooking ahead, law enforcement must be a trusted partner, as data sharing is key – including between\nnational police forces, and with the public and private sectors. At a time when the international\ncommunity is under exceptional pressure, bolstering our common security requires us to move\ntowards more collaboration. Together with our member countries and partners, INTERPOL will\ncontinue to reduce the impact of cybercrime and protect communities for a safer world.\n\n\n-----\n\n**INTERPOL Contributors**\n\nWookyung Jung, Policy Analyst, Cybercrime Directorate\n\nRichard Lim, Project Manager, African Joint Operation against Cybercrime\n\nEmmanuel Kabera, Cybercrime Intelligence Officer, African Joint Operation against Cybercrime\n\nMohammed Isah, Cybercrime Operations Officer, African Joint Operation against Cybercrime\n\nShane Cross, Acting Head Cybercrime Intelligence Unit, Cybercrime Threat Response\n\nJoyce Sin, Cybercrime Intelligence Officer, Cybercrime Threat Response\n\nPeter Stanier, Cybercrime Intelligence Officer, Cybercrime Threat Response\n\nAgnese Carlini, Cybercrime Intelligence Officer, Cybercrime Threat Response\n\nDean Watkinson, Cyber Specialized Officer, INTERPOL Support Programme for the African Union\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
