Since late 2019, our team has\ndisrupted financially motivated phishing campaigns targeting YouTubers with Cookie Theft\nmalware.\n\nThe actors behind this campaign, which we attribute to a group of hackers recruited in a\nRussian-speaking forum, lure their target with fake collaboration opportunities (typically a\ndemo for anti-virus software, VPN, music players, photo editing or online games), hijack their\nchannel, then either sell it to the highest bidder or use it to broadcast cryptocurrency scams.\n\nIn collaboration with YouTube, Gmail, Trust & Safety, CyberCrime Investigation Group and\nSafe Browsing teams, our protections have decreased the volume of related phishing emails\non Gmail by 99.6% since May 2021. We blocked 1.6M messages to targets, displayed ~62K\nSafe Browsing phishing page warnings, blocked 2.4K files, and successfully restored ~4K\naccounts. With increased detection efforts, we’ve observed attackers shifting away from\nGmail to other email providers (mostly email.cz, seznam.cz, post.cz and aol.com). Moreover,\nto protect our users, we have referred the below activity to the FBI for further investigation.\n\nIn this blog, we share examples of the specific tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nused to lure victims, as well as some guidance on how users can further protect themselves.\n\n## Tactics, techniques and procedures\n\nCookie Theft, also known as “pass-the-cookie attack,” is a session hijacking technique that\nenables access to user accounts with session cookies stored in the browser. While the\n[technique has been around for decades, its resurgence as a top security risk could be due to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking)\na wider adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) making it difficult to conduct abuse, and\nshifting attacker focus to social engineering tactics.\n\n## Social engineering YouTubers with advertisement offer\n\nMany YouTube creators provide an email address on their channel for business\nopportunities. In this case, the attackers sent forged business emails impersonating an\nexisting company requesting a video advertisement collaboration.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample phishing email message\n\nThe phishing typically started with a customized email introducing the company and its\nproducts. Once the target agreed to the deal, a malware landing page disguised as a\nsoftware download URL was sent via email or a PDF on Google Drive, and in a few cases,\nGoogle documents containing the phishing links. Around 15,000 actor accounts were\nidentified, most of which were created for this campaign specifically.\n\n## Fake software landing pages and social media accounts\n\nThe attackers registered various domains associated with forged companies and built\nmultiple websites for malware delivery. To date, we’ve identified at least 1,011 domains\ncreated solely for this purpose. Some of the websites impersonated legitimate software sites,\nsuch as Luminar, Cisco VPN, games on Steam, and some were generated using online\ntemplates. During the pandemic, we also uncovered attackers posing as news providers with\na “Covid19 news software.”\n\nLure message and landing pages for the forged covid news software.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn one case, we observed a fake social media page copying content from an existing\nsoftware company. The following screenshot is an example of a fake page where the original\nURL is replaced with one leading to a cookie theft malware download.\n\nOriginal (left) and fake (right) instagram accounts\n\nBecause Google actively detects and disrupts phishing links sent via Gmail, the actors were\nobserved driving targets to messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram or Discord.\n\n## Delivering cookie theft malware\n\nOnce the target runs the fake software, a cookie stealing malware executes, taking browser\ncookies from the victim’s machine and uploading them to the actor's command & control\nservers. Although this type of malware can be configured to be persistent on the victim's\nmachine, these actors are running all malware in non-persistent mode as a smash-and-grab\ntechnique. This is because if the malicious file is not detected when executed, there are less\nartifacts on an infected host and therefore security products fail to notify the user of a past\ncompromise.\n\nWe have observed that actors use various types of malware based on personal preference,\nmost of which are easily available on Github. Some commodity malware used included\nRedLine, Vidar, Predator The Thief, Nexus stealer, Azorult, Raccoon, Grand Stealer, Vikro\nStealer, Masad (Google’s naming), and Kantal (Google’s naming) which shares code\n[similarity with Vidar. Open source malware like Sorano and](https://github.com/Alexuiop1337/SoranoStealer) [AdamantiumThief were also](https://github.com/LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief)\nobserved. Related hashes are listed in the Technical Details section, at the end of this report.\n\nMost of the observed malware was capable of stealing both user passwords and cookies.\nSome of the samples employed several anti-sandboxing techniques including enlarged files,\nencrypted archive and download IP cloaking. A few were observed displaying a fake error\nmessage requiring user click-through to continue execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFake error window require user click through\n\n## Cryptocurrency scams and channel selling\n\nA large number of hijacked channels were rebranded for cryptocurrency scam livestreaming. The channel name, profile picture and content were all replaced with\ncryptocurrency branding to impersonate large tech or cryptocurrency exchange firms. The\nattacker live-streamed videos promising cryptocurrency giveaways in exchange for an initial\ncontribution.\n\nOn account-trading markets, hijacked channels ranged from $3 USD to $4,000 USD\ndepending on the number of subscribers.\n\n## Hack-for-Hire attackers\n\nThese campaigns were carried out by a number of hack-for-hire actors recruited on Russianspeaking forums via the following job description, offering two types of work:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis recruitment model explains the highly customized social engineering, as well as the\nvaried malware types given each actor's choice of preferred malware.\n\n## Protecting our users from attacks\n\nWe are continuously improving our detection methods and investing in new tools and\nfeatures that automatically identify and stop threats like this one. Some of these\nimprovements include:\n\nAdditional heuristic rules to detect and block phishing & social engineering emails,\ncookie theft hijacking and crypto-scam livestreams.\n[Safe Browsing is further detecting and blocking malware landing pages and](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\ndownloads.\nYouTube has hardened channel transfer workflows, detected and auto-recovered over\n99% of hijacked channels.\nAccount Security has hardened authentication workflows to block and notify the user\non potential sensitive actions.\n\n\n-----\n\nSensitive action blocked in account\n\nIt is also important that users remain aware of these types of threats and take appropriate\naction to further protect themselves. Our recommendations:\n\n**Take Safe Browsing warnings seriously. To avoid malware triggering antivirus**\ndetections, threat actors social engineer users into turning off or ignoring warnings.\n**Before running software, perform virus scanning using an antivirus or online virus**\n[scanning tool like VirusTotal to verify file legitimacy.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search)\n**[Enable the “Enhanced Safe Browsing Protection” mode in your Chrome browser,](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/05/enhanced-safe-browsing-protection-now.html)**\na feature that increases warnings on potentially suspicious web pages & files.\n**Be aware of encrypted archives which are often bypassing antivirus detection scans,**\nincreasing the risk of running malicious files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Protect your account with** **[2-Step-verification (multi-factor authentication) which](https://safety.google/authentication/)**\nprovides an extra layer of security to your account in case your password is stolen.\nStarting November 1, monetizing YouTube creators [must turn on 2-Step Verification on](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9701986#zippy=%2Cavoid-suspicious-requests)\nthe Google Account used for their YouTube channel to access YouTube Studio or\nYouTube Studio Content Manager.\n\n[Additional resources: Avoid & Report Phishing Emails.](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8253?hl=en#zippy=%2Creport-a-phishing-email)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Related Malware hashes:**\n\nRedLine (commodity)\n\n501fe2509581d43288664f0d2825a6a47102cd614f676bf39f0f80ab2fd43f2c\nc8b42437ffd8cfbbe568013eaaa707c212a2628232c01d809a3cf864fe24afa8\nVidar (commodity)\n\n9afc029ac5aa525e6fdcedf1e93a64980751eeeae3cf073fcbd1d223ab5c96d6\nKantal (share code similarity with Vidar)\n\nF59534e6d9e0559d99d2b3a630672a514dbd105b0d6fc9447d573ebd0053caba\n(zip archive)\nEdea528804e505d202351eda0c186d7c200c854c41049d7b06d1971591142358\n(unpacked sample)\nPredator The Thief (commodity)\n\n0d8cfa02515d504ca34273d8cfbe9d1d0f223e5d2cece00533c48a990fd8ce72 (zip\narchive)\n[Sorano (open source)](https://github.com/Alexuiop1337/SoranoStealer)\n\nc7c8466a66187f78d953c64cbbd2be916328085aa3c5e48fde6767bc9890516b\nNexus stealer (commodity)\n\ned8b2af133b4144bef2b89dbec1526bf80cc06fe053ece1fa873f6bd1e99f0be\nefc88a933a8baa6e7521c8d0cf78c52b0e3feb22985de3d35316a8b00c5073b3\nAzorult (commodity)\n\n8cafd480ac2a6018a4e716a4f9fd1254c4e93501a84ee1731ed7b98b67ab15dd\nRaccoon (commodity)\n\n85066962ba1e8a0a8d6989fffe38ff564a6cf6f8a07782b3fbc0dcb19d2497cb\nGrand Stealer (commodity)\n\n6359d5fa7437164b300abc69c8366f9481cb91b7558d68c9e3b0c2a535ddc243\nVikro Stealer (commodity)\n\n04deb8d8aee87b24c7ba0db55610bb12f7d8ec1e75765650e5b2b4f933b18f6d\nMasad (commodity)\n\n6235573d8d178341dbfbead7c18a2f419808dc8c7c302ac61e4f9645d024ed85\n[AdamantiumThief (open source)](https://github.com/LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief)\n\nDb45bb99c44a96118bc5673a7ad65dc2a451ea70d4066715006107f65d906715\n\n**Top Phishing Domains:**\n\n\n-----\n\npro-swapper[.]com\ndownloadnature[.]space\ndownloadnature[.]com\nfast-redirect[.]host\nbragi-studio[.]com\nplplme[.]site\nfenzor[.]com\nuniverse-photo[.]com\nrainway-gaming[.]com\nawaken1337[.]xyz\npixelka[.]fun\nvortex-cloudgaming[.]com\nvontex[.]tech\nuser52406.majorcore[.]space\nvoneditor[.]tech\nspaceditor[.]space\nroudar[.]com\npeoplep[.]site\nanypon[.]online\nzeneditor[.]tech\nyourworld[.]site\nplayerupbo[.]xyz\ndizzify[.]me\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
