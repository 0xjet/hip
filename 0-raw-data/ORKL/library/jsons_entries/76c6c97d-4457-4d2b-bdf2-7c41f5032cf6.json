We have watched this global market grow in both complexity and fervency. We’ve seen the cyberattack landscape becoming increasingly sophisticated as cybercriminals continue—and even escalate—their activity in times of crisis. New levels of supply chain and ransomware attacks were a powerful reminder that we must all work together, and in new ways, to protect the cybersecurity of the planet.\n\n\nWe see transparency and information sharing\n\nas essential to the protection of the ecosystem.\n\nKnowledge brings power, and to that end, security\n\nprofessionals need diverse and timely insights into\n\nthe threats they are defending against.\n\nMicrosoft serves billions of customers globally,\n\nallowing us to aggregate security data from a broad\n\nand diverse spectrum of companies, organizations,\n\nand consumers. Informed by over 24 trillion\n\nsecurity signals per day, our unique position helps\n\nus generate a high-fidelity picture of the current\n\nstate of cybersecurity, including indicators that help\n\nus predict what attackers will do next. Our goal in\n\ncreating the Microsoft Digital Defense Report is to\n\nbring together integrated data and insights from\n\nmore teams, across more areas of Microsoft than\n\never before. We will share what we’re seeing to help\n\nthe global community strengthen the defense of the\n\ndigital ecosystem, and we will include actionable\n\n\nlearnings that companies, governments, and\n\nconsumers can use to further secure individuals and\n\nenvironments.\n\nThe Microsoft Digital Defense Report draws on\n\ninsights, data, and signals from across Microsoft,\n\nincluding the cloud, endpoints, and the intelligent\n\nedge.[ Note 1 ] Thousands of Microsoft security experts\n\nacross 77 countries interpret and contribute to the\n\ninsights gained from our advanced engineering\n\nand threat signals. Our security experts include\n\nanalysts, researchers, responders, engineers, and\n\ndata scientists. We also share lessons learned from\n\ncustomers transitioning to a hybrid workforce and\n\nfrontline stories from our incident responders. Of\n\ncourse, there is malign activity we do not see, some\n\nof which is reported on by others in the industry.\n\nWhile the defender community at Microsoft works\n\nhard to identify threats and keep our customers\n\ninformed, the bad actors are skilled and relentless.\n\n\nBy continually sharing insights we and others in the\n\nindustry derive from the work we do, we hope to\n\nempower everyone to defend the online ecosystem\n\nmore effectively.\n\nMicrosoft has made significant and ongoing\n\ninvestments to increase and improve the knowledge\n\nwe derive from our threat signals. These investments\n\ndeliver the highly synthesized and integrated\n\ninsights that we share here. Our goal in aggregating\n\nthese learnings is to help organizations understand\n\nthe ways in which cybercriminals are continually\n\nshifting their modes of attack—and determine the\n\nbest ways to combat those attacks. We write and\n\nshare this report in the spirit of empowering the\n\nglobal community to benefit from the insights,\n\nobservations, and transparency generated by our\n\nunique mission and vantage point.\n\n\n###### THE MICROSOFT\n\n DIGITAL DEFENSE\n\n REPORT DRAWS ON\n\n INSIGHTS, DATA,\n\n AND SIGNALS\n\n FROM ACROSS\n\n MICROSOFT,\n\n INCLUDING\n\n THE CLOUD,\n\n ENDPOINTS, AND\n\n THE INTELLIGENT\n\n EDGE.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Microsoft security signals\n\n Volume and diversity of signals processed by Microsoft\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Our 2021 focus areas\n\n\n###### Nation state threats\n\nThis chapter provides an update on what we’re\n\nseeing in nation state adversarial activity, including\n\nreports on seven activity groups we have not\n\npreviously mentioned publicly. We provide an\n\nanalysis of the evolving threats in this watershed\n\nyear with an increased focus on on-premises servers\n\nand the exposure of widespread supply chain\n\nvulnerabilities. We conclude with a discussion about\n\nprivate sector offensive actors and our guidance for\n\ncomprehensive protections.\n\n\n###### Supply chain, IoT, and OT security\n\nThe highly publicized events of the last year have\n\nmade clear that securing and managing risks\n\nassociated with supplier ecosystems is critically\n\nimportant. This chapter covers some current\n\nchallenges in doing so in the supplier ecosystem\n\nand presents how Microsoft thinks about end-to\nend supply chain security in nine investment areas.\n\nThen we turn our discussion to what we’re seeing\n\nin the Internet of Things (IoT) and operational\n\ntechnology (OT) threat landscape, with guidance on\n\nthe properties of highly secured devices. We include\n\nspecialized use cases of IoT and present some new\n\nresearch informing IoT policy considerations.\n\n\n2021 brought powerful reminders that to protect\n\nthe future we must understand the threats of the\n\npresent. This requires that we continually share data\n\nand insights in new ways. Certain types of attacks\n\nhave escalated as cybercriminals change tactics,\n\nleveraging current events to take advantage of\n\nvulnerable targets and advance their activity through\n\nnew channels. Change brings opportunity—for both\n\nattackers and defenders—and this report will focus\n\non the threats that are most novel and relevant to\n\nthe community as we look to the months ahead.\n\nLooking at the threat landscape, along with data\n\nand signals from cross-company teams, five top\nlevel areas emerged as most critical to bring into the\n\nsharpest focus in this report: the state of cybercrime;\n\nnation state threats; supplier ecosystems, Internet\n\nof Things (IoT), and operational technology (OT)\n\nsecurity; the hybrid workforce; and disinformation.\n\nTo provide the greatest benefit, we also extract our\n\nrecommendations and actionable learnings, and\n\npresent them throughout the report and in our\n\nconcluding chapter.\n\n\n###### The state of cybercrime\n\nIn this chapter, we discuss new developments in\n\nthe cybercrime economy and the growing market\n\nfor cybercrime services. We provide updates and\n\nanalysis of what we are seeing in ransomware and\n\nextortion, phishing and other malicious email,\n\nmalware, and the use of domains by cybercriminals,\n\npresenting recommendations for mitigating risk\n\nin each area. Finally, we share what we’re seeing in\n\nadversarial machine learning and what we are doing\n\nto stay ahead of cybercriminals in this area.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Hybrid workforce security\n\nThis chapter is about our greatest asset, our people.\n\nAs we have moved to a hybrid workforce over\n\nthe past year, we’ve seen developments in the\n\nthreat landscape which point to the importance\n\nof adopting a Zero Trust approach. We include\n\nthreat signals and other data across the six pillars\n\nof Zero Trust—identities, endpoints, applications,\n\nnetwork, infrastructure, and data—and provide\n\nguidance based on what we’re seeing. We conclude\n\nwith discussions about insider threats in hybrid\n\nwork environments, and an empathy imperative\n\nfor managing the new and significant challenges\n\nencountered by today’s workforce.\n\n\n###### Disinformation\n\nThis chapter addresses the unprecedented\n\ndisinformation campaigns and related cyber\n\noperations by state and non-state actors,\n\nimpacting public awareness and knowledge as\n\nwell as enterprise operations. We look at some\n\nparallels in cybersecurity and discuss mitigation\n\nthrough media literacy. We include a discussion on\n\ndisinformation as an enterprise disruptor, providing\n\na four-point plan for enterprise executives. The\n\nchapter concludes with an in-depth exploration of\n\npolitical campaign security and election integrity,\n\ntwo areas that have been targeted by disinformation\n\ncampaigns.\n\n\n###### Actionable insights\n\nWe open this year’s concluding chapter with a\n\ndiscussion of five paradigm shifts that will center the\n\nevolution of work around the inclusivity of people\n\nand data. The chapter concludes with a distilled look\n\nat the key learnings from all the previous chapters\n\nof this report: to minimize impact of attacks we\n\nmust truly practice good cyber hygiene, implement\n\narchitectures that support the principles of Zero\n\nTrust, and ensure cyber risk management is built into\n\nthe business.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHAPTER 2\n\n## The state of cybercrime\n\n###### Introduction\n\n The cybercrime economy and services\n\n Ransomware and extortion\n\n Phishing and other malicious email\n\n Malware\n\n Malicious domains\n\n Adversarial machine learning\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCTION:\n##### The growing threat of cybercrime\n\n###### AMY HOGAN-BURNEY, GENERAL MANAGER, DIGITAL CRIMES UNIT\n\n Cybercrime, whether nation state sponsored or permitted, is a threat to national security. Cybercriminals are targeting and attacking all sectors of critical infrastructure, including healthcare and public health, information technology (IT), financial services, and energy sectors. Ransomware attacks are increasingly successful, crippling governments and businesses, and the profits from these attacks are soaring.\n\n The cybercrime supply chain, often created by criminal syndicates, continues to mature allowing anyone to buy the services needed to conduct malicious activity for financial gain or other nefarious purpose. Sophisticated cybercriminals are also still working for governments conducting espionage and training in the new battlefield.\n\n\nIt is not hopeless, and there are two positive trends\n\nwe have seen recently. First, more governments\n\nand companies are coming forward when they are\n\nvictims. This transparency helps in several ways. It\n\nhas made clear to governments around the world\n\nthat cybercrime is a threat to security. Victim stories\n\nhumanize and make clear the consequences of these\n\nattacks, drawing attention to the problem and allowing\n\nincreased engagement from incident responders and\n\nlaw enforcement. Second, now that governments\n\naround the world recognize that cybercrime is a threat\n\nto national security, they have made combatting it a\n\npriority. Governments around the world are passing\n\nnew laws regarding reporting, creating cross\ngovernment task forces, allocating resources, and\n\nseeking out private sector assistance.\n\n\n##### The cybercrime economy and services\n\nThrough our investigations of online organized crime\n\nnetworks, frontline investigations of customer attacks,\n\nsecurity and attack research, nation state threat\n\ntracking, and security tool development, we continue\n\nto see the cybercrime supply chain consolidate and\n\nmature. It used to be that cybercriminals had to\n\ndevelop all the technology for their attacks. Today,\n\nthey rely on a mature supply chain, where specialists\n\ncreate cybercrime kits and services that other actors\n\nbuy and incorporate into their campaigns. With the\n\n\nspecialized services has surfaced, and threat actors\n\nare increasing automation to drive down their costs\n\n###### THREAT ACTOR\n\nand increase scale. For example, we are seeing an\n\nincreasing offer of backconnect proxies (proxies that **CAN PURCHASE**\n\nrotate between mobile, residential, and datacenter\n\nsystems) in addition to Remote Desktop Protocol **A RANGE OF**\n\n(RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), virtual private network **SERVICES TO**\n\n(VPN), virtual private server (VPS), web shells, cPanels\n\n(webhosting management dashboard), and other\n\n###### CONDUCT THEIR\n\nanonymization systems.\n\n###### ATTACKS WITH\n\nOther examples include selling compromised\n\ncredentials that may have been obtained from **ONE CLICK.**\n\nphishing, scraping botnet logs or other credential\n\nharvesting techniques, imposter domain names,\n\nphishing-as-a-service, customized lead generation\n\n\n###### WITH NO\n\n TECHNICAL\n\n KNOWLEDGE OF\n\n HOW TO CONDUCT\n\n A CYBERCRIME ATTACK, AN\n\n AMATEUR THREAT ACTOR\n\n CAN PURCHASE\n\n A RANGE OF\n\n SERVICES TO\n\n CONDUCT THEIR\n\n ATTACKS WITH\n\n ONE CLICK.\n\n\n-----\n\nloads (malicious software used to update malware\n\non an infected computer), denial of service (DoS),\n\nand more. As an illustration, in some marketplaces,\n\ncompromised credentials are offered by different\n\nsellers for $1.00 USD to $50.00 USD, depending on\n\na variety of variables including the perceived value\n\nof the enterprise target. The number of sites offering\n\nservices has significantly increased in the past 12\n\nmonths as well as volume of credentials and variety\n\nof phishing kits.\n\nAmong the services available to even amateur threat\n\nactors are the cryptocurrency escrow services (to\n\nensure services are rendered as offered) that we\n\noften see in commodity ransomware campaigns\n\nwhere affiliate models have become firmly\n\nestablished. Nontechnical cybercriminals sign up with\n\na ransomware affiliate where for 30% of the revenue,\n\nthe affiliate network will supply the ransomware,\n\nrecovery services, and payment services. The attacker\n\nthen buys “loads” from a market and pushes the\n\nransomware to the loads they purchased. They then\n\nsit back and collect their revenue.\n\n\nAt times there are geographic groups of actors\n\nwho may offer certain services, but most of these\n\ncybercrime markets are global in nature. A buyer\n\nin Brazil can obtain phishing kits from a seller in\n\nPakistan, domains from the United States, victim\n\nleads from Nigeria, and proxies from Romania.\n\nThese prices have remained fairly steady over the\n\npast several years, but like any other market they\n\nvary according to changes in supply, demand, and\n\nexternalities such as politics.\n\n**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**\n\n**• Identity and password/phishing attacks are**\n\ncheap, and on the rise. Why would an attacker\n\nbreak in when they can log in?\n\n**• Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks**\n\n**are cheap for unprotected sites—about $300**\n\nUSD/month.\n\n**• Ransomware kits are one of the many types of**\n\nattack kits designed to enable low-skill attackers\n\nto perform more sophisticated attacks.\n\n\n###### Average prices of cybercrime services for sale\n\n\n###### Organizations now face an industrialized attacker economy with skill specialization and trading of illicit commodities. As seen in this snapshot of average prices, many commodities that can be purchased in Not all attacks work. It’s critical that we keep the dark markets are very inexpensive, making attacks cheaper and easier to conduct (which also drives up attack volume). improving our defenses to increase the failure rate of attacks and the associated cost to attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Ransomware and extortion\n###### Ransomware basics and taxonomy\n\nRansomware and extortion is a high-profit, low-cost\n\nbusiness which has a debilitating impact on targeted\n\norganizations, national security, economic security,\n\nand public health and safety. What started as simple\n\nsingle-PC ransomware has grown to include a\n\nvariety of extortion techniques enabled by human\n\nintelligence and is affecting the networks of all types\n\nof organizations across the globe.\n\nThis combination of real-time intelligence and\n\nbroader criminal tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\n###### Ransomware taxonomy\n\n\n(TTPs) has maximized the impact of these attacks\n\nand driven the profits from these attacks to levels\n\nthat were hard to imagine a few years ago. To put\n\nit in perspective, the publicly reported profits from\n\nransomware and extortion attacks gives these\n\nattackers a budget that would likely rival the budgets\n\n_of nation state attack organizations (without even_\n\ncounting the profits from attacks that never made\n\nthe headlines).\n\nTo counter ransomware, a global collaborative\n\neffort between the private sector, law enforcement,\n\nand government is necessary to reduce the\n\nprofitability of this crime, make it more difficult to\n\nenter the ransomware market, and supply victims\n\nwith effective tools for efficient prevention and\n\nremediation. Microsoft is a contributor to the\n\nRansomware Task Force report, a comprehensive\n\n\nframework designed for taking action in combatting\n\nransomware.[ Note 2 ] Microsoft has also published a\n\nproject plan with links to technical guidance to\n\nhelp organizations better prepare for and respond\n\nto these attacks and is contributing to a National\n\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\n\npublication containing a cybersecurity framework\n\nprofile for ransomware risk management.[ Note 3 ]\n\nA ransomware and extortion attack involves a\n\nthreat actor deploying malware that encrypts\n\nand exfiltrates data and then holds that data\n\nfor a ransom, often demanding payment in\n\ncryptocurrency. Rather than just encrypting a victim’s\n\nfiles and requesting a ransom in exchange for the\n\ndecryption key, the attackers also exfiltrate sensitive\n\ndata before deploying the ransomware. This\n\npractice prevents victims from disengaging from\n\n\nnegotiations and raises the victim’s reputational\n\ncosts of not paying the ransom as the attackers likely\n\nwill not only leave the victim’s data encrypted but\n\nalso leak sensitive information.\n\nA series of criminal activities occur long before the\n\nransomware is ultimately deployed across computer\n\nsystems in an organization. As a result, we created a\n\ntaxonomy that focuses on the relationship between\n\nentities within the ransomware ecosystem because\n\nany entity may play a different role at any given\n\ntime.\n\nRansomware attacks have evolved into human\noperated ransomware, also known as “big game\n\nransomware.”\n\n|Primary role|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Develops|Writes the malware|\n|Deploys|Sends phishing emails, deploys ransomware|\n|Provides access|Malware that loads other malware, or a group that sells access as a service|\n|Manages/operates|Leadership of a group (such as MAZE cartel membership) and/or function that provides coordination (such as managing or operating a central extortion leak site)|\n|Publicly reported connection|A publicly reported connection exists|\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, as shown in the image at right, a threat\n\nactor may develop and deploy malware that gives\n\none threat actor access to a certain category of\n\nvictims, whereas a different threat actor may merely\n\ndeploy malware.\n\n###### Post-breach response\n\nJust as the criminal enterprise that deploys\n\nransomware typically involves several stakeholders\n\neach with a particular responsibility, the response to\n\nransomware also involves several key stakeholders.\n\nIf a victim of a ransomware attack has cyber\n\ninsurance, that carrier will employ certain service\n\nproviders, including an incident response firm, a\n\nlaw firm, and an organization specializing in ransom\n\nnegotiation. Even if a victim does not have a cyber\n\ninsurance policy, these stakeholders are common to\n\nfinding a resolution to the ransom.\n\nOnce a ransomware gang locks a victims’ network,\n\nexfiltrates data, and holds the network and\n\ndata for ransom, an incident response team will\n\ninvestigate the root cause of the breach and drive\n\nremediation efforts depending on the victim’s level\n\nof preparedness prior to the attack. If the victim has\n\nsufficient backups of its data or data has not been\n\nstolen, often the incident response team will work\n\nto remove the threat actor from the victim’s system,\n\nrestore business operations, and apply future\n\nmitigation measures. The incident response team\n\n\nwill often provide the victim a report which includes\n\nroot cause, criminal actor movement inside the\n\nvictim network, data exposure and exfiltration, and\n\nremediation recommendations.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction of the victim, the\n\nvictim could be subject to data breach notification\n\nrequirements. A law firm will often assess the\n\nexposure of the victim’s liability and assist the\n\nvictim with meeting its regulatory obligations.\n\nImportantly, the law firm will interface with relevant\n\nlaw enforcement, where appropriate. Finally, if a\n\nvictim is unable to return to business operations,\n\nan organization specializing in negotiating with\n\nransomware criminal syndicates will work to obtain\n\nthe decryption key on behalf of the victim.\n\n\n###### Sample analysis of roles and relationships between entities within the ransomware ecosystem\n\n Ransomware syndicates and affiliates are all working together toward these interconnected threats. Rather than one individual behind a ransomware attack, there are multiple groups of individuals, similar to a shared business model.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Stakeholders and roles involved in post-breach response\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Criminal economics: A changing business model\n\nThe business model for ransomware has effectively\n\nevolved into an intelligence operation; criminal\n\nactors perform research on their target victim to\n\nidentify an optimal ransom demand. Once a criminal\n\nactor infiltrates a network, they may exfiltrate and\n\nstudy financial documents and insurance policies.\n\nThey may also understand the penalties associated\n\nwith local breach laws. The actors will then extort\n\nmoney from their victims, to not only unlock their\n\nsystems, but also to prevent disclosure of the\n\nvictim’s exfiltrated data to the public. After they’ve\n\ncollected and analyzed this intelligence, the criminal\n\nactor will identify an “appropriate” ransom amount.\n\nThe negotiation chat, at right, with a public school\n\ndistrict to extort cash in exchange for a decryption\n\nkey to unlock the Conti ransomware deployed on\n\nits network demonstrates the research performed\n\nby the criminal in advance of the negotiation.\n\nHere, the criminal actor explains “we examined all\n\nfinancial documents, bank statements for the last\n\nyear, insurance. And came to the conclusion that\n\nyou are exaggerating about poor financial condition\n\n[sic]. We also calculated your possible losses from\n\nlawsuits from both your staff and your students for\n\nthe leakage of their personal data. These fines will\n\nexceed $30 million. We are not talking about the\n\nloss of reputation, which in our opinion costs more.”\n\n\n###### Ransomware negotiation chat\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are few barriers of entry into this criminal\n\nenterprise. A cybercriminal does not need\n\nspecialized code development skills to profit from\n\nthis crime. The ransomware enterprise has evolved\n\ninto ransomware as a service driven by human\n\nintelligence and research. It is no longer solely the\n\nprovince of malware developers; rather, the business\n\nstructure is modular. Malware developers are\n\nrecruiting hackers with access to networks promising\n\na “cut” of the profit. Criminals can purchase malware\n\nand access to specific networks and target specific\n\nindustries. This is effectively a crime syndicate where\n\neach member is paid for a particular expertise.\n\nIn the example shown below, following the crypto\n\nflows, we can see where a criminal enterprise split its\n\nbitcoin “earnings” such that approximately 15% of\n\nthe earnings flowed to the developer/manager and\n\n75% of the earnings flowed to the attacker.\n\n###### Transaction hashes and wallet addresses\n\n_Victim ransom wallet is shown on the far left. The funds split to two different wallets on the far right._\n\n_Text intentionally blurred for publication_\n\n\nRegardless of where ransomware is deployed,\n\ntypically the threat actors will demand payment via\n\ncryptocurrency through crypto wallets. Although\n\nthe underlying blockchain technology facilitates\n\ntransparent cryptocurrency flows, the owners of\n\nwallets remain pseudonymous. Nonetheless, they\n\nstill need to find on- and off-ramps into the crypto\n\necosystem. At its core, the criminal actor needs\n\nto append the blockchain with a transaction and\n\nultimately find a way to cash out. There are several\n\nstakeholders within the cryptocurrency ecosystem\n\nthat facilitate ransom-related transactions and\n\npayments. These intermediaries often exist in\n\njurisdictions with governments that are historically\n\nunwilling to cooperate with the United States\n\nand others. It’s these intermediaries that facilitate\n\nthe flow of ill-gotten earnings from ransomware.\n\nThe private sector through civil litigation, and\n\nthe government through prosecution, regulatory\n\nenforcement, and international collaboration, can\n\ntake coordinated action against intermediaries to\n\ndisrupt the payment process.\n\n\n**SIDEBAR: TO PAY, OR NOT TO PAY?**\n\nIn the aftermath of a ransomware attack, companies\n\nare often completely offline—their security systems\n\ntampered with, their backup systems deleted, their\n\ndata encrypted, and their users unable to log in.\n\nWhen operations are offline and losses pile up, it\n\nis important to remember that paying the ransom\n\ndemands does not guarantee the restoration of\n\noperations, nor does paying prevent future attacks.\n\nIn addition, we have in effect, the classic “Tragedy\n\nof the Commons”[ Note 4]— while it may make sense for\n\nindividual victims to pay for their own individual\n\nbenefit (restore critical business operations), the\n\npayment also contributes to the growth of this\n\ndamaging model for everyone. Ransom payments\n\ncan keep the cycle turning, as described below:\n\n - The business model of extortionists gets\n\nreinforced, which also attracts more bad actors\n\ninto the monetization strategy. Substantial\n\nrevenue is supplied to the actors who then use\n\npart of it for research and development (R&D)\n\n\nto improve their tooling and ability to buy\n\nbreach access to potential victim organizations.\n\nSome ransomware teams have significant\n\namounts of funds for R&D and for buying high\nend 0-days. For example, some ransomware\n\nteams have budget to spend up to $1 million\n\nUSD, or more, per 0-day. While some high-end\n\nransomware teams buy 0-days, others focus\n\non traditional ways to gain remote access into\n\nvictims’ networks.\n\n- The ransomware tools become more automated\n\nand effective, allowing the bad actors to\n\nscale and accelerate their attacks—with more\n\nsophistication and less effort.\n\n\n###### Transaction hashes and wallet addresses\n\n\n-----\n\nImportant details to be aware of when making the\n\ndecision whether to pay ransoms:\n\n - On average, organizations that paid the ransom\n\ngot back only 65% of their data, with 29%\n\ngetting back no more than half their data.[ Note 5 ]\n\n - Ransom decryptors are buggy and regularly fail\n\nto decrypt the largest, most critical data files\n\n(files 4 GB+ in size).\n\n - Decrypting data files is a slow and labor\nintensive process, most customers decrypt only\n\ntheir most critical of data files and restore the\n\nrest from backup.\n\n - Restoring data does not undo any tampering\n\nperformed by the attackers.\n\n - Restoring data does not secure systems to\n\nprevent future attacks.\n\n - Organizations must understand the legality of\n\nmaking payments in their country. Governments\n\nacross the globe are instituting ransomware\n\npayment reporting requirements, may have\n\npenalties for payments that are made to\n\nsanctioned parties, and are considering laws\n\nthat could make ransom payments illegal.\n\n\n###### Paying a ransom fuels the ransomware syndicates\n\n Paying a ransom gives the criminals more resources to expand their operations, helping them become more organized and specialized. With more funding available, the groups can improve their tools and code, enabling ransomware to spread through networks undetected by antivirus software.\n\n\n**EXAMPLE: CONTI RANSOMWARE**\n\nThe Conti ransomware first appeared around July 2020 adopting the double extortion business model. In this\n\ndouble extortion model, a victim is first extorted for ransom and for the possible publishing of their stolen\n\ndata. Conti is also a ransomware as a service (RaaS), which is a subscription-based service allowing affiliates\n\nof the service ready access to ransomware-building tools and builds. Affiliates of the service agree to ransom\n\npercentage payouts between the ransomware developer and threat actor who performed the exploitation. Conti\n\nusually gains access to the victim network via other threats like Trickbot, IcedID, or Zloader. Once inside the\n\nvictim network, Conti has a configurable reconnaissance module where it can scan internal networks looking\n\nfor network shares and other high-value targets. Once deployed, Conti begins to encrypt user-modifiable data\n\nand databases based on targeted file extension lists. Upon completion of the encryption, a ransom note is left in\n\nevery file directory with instructions for the user on how to contact the ransomware actors:\n\n###### Ransom note\n\n\n-----\n\nThe user must now upload the ransom note text file to the recovery site listed in the ransom note. The note\n\nserves as proof of encryption and victim identification for the ransomware actors.\n\n###### Ransom recovery site\n\n Conti News site\n\n\nAfter the ransom note is uploaded and verified and a chat session is initiated.\n\n###### Chat session following ransom note upload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe negotiation phase starts with the threat actor, as they prove they can decrypt any files provided by the\n\nvictim. After a final ransom price is negotiated, the ransomware actor provides a Bitcoin wallet address for\n\nthe victim to send payment. Conti ransomware actors maintain recovery and news sites on regular top-level\n\ndomains (as on the open web) as well as on the dark web or Tor (also known as The Onion Router).\n\nAs part of the double extortion business model, the actors behind Conti maintain a news site, which serves as\n\nthe publishing site to prove that if the ransom is not paid, the victim’s private information will be posted publicly\n\nand could be sold on the black market. The Conti News site currently lists hundreds of victims with various\n\nsamples of their private data.\n\nConti victims are located mostly in the United States and Europe and include public schools, healthcare\n\nproviders, manufacturing companies, US city governments, and even public utility providers.\n\n###### What we’re seeing in ransomware data and signals\n\n**DEFENDER SIGNALS**\n\n###### Ransomware encounter rate (machine count): Enterprise customers Ransomware encounter rate (machine count): All customers\n\n These charts show the overall increase in ransomware encounters, with notable surge to consumer and commercial encounters in late 2019,[ Note 6 ] when RaaS started to grow, and in early 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[ Note 7 ]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware machine counts by country (July 2020-June 2021) DART DATA\n\nWhile the Colonial Pipeline ransom attack of May 2021 drew considerable public attention, our Detection\n\nand Response Team (DART) ransomware engagement data shows that the three most targeted sectors were\n\nconsumer, financial, and manufacturing.

There is a massive growth trajectory for ransomware and extortion.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nThe stakes have changed. There is a massive growth trajectory for ransomware and extortion. To help protect\n\nyour organization from ransomware, we recommend that organizations:\n\n###### Deploy ransomware protection\n\n**_Prepare a recovery plan by making it harder to access and disrupt systems, which minimizes the monetary_**\n\nincentives for ransomware attackers and makes it easier to recover from an attack without paying the ransom.\n\n**_Limit the scope of damage by forcing the attackers to work harder to gain access to multiple business-critical_**\n\nsystems. Establish least-privilege access and adopt Zero Trust principles. These steps make it harder for an\n\nattacker who gets in to a network to travel across the network to find valuable data to lock up. Also, encrypt\n\ndata at rest, and practice good backup-and-restore hygiene. This way, even if data is stolen it will be encrypted\n\nand not very useful to the attackers. In the unfortunate event that the attacker does encrypt your data, you will\n\nhave a good backup to restore from and use to maintain business continuity.\n\n**_Make it harder to get in by following basic cybersecurity hygiene steps that make it more difficult for attackers_**\n\nto gain access to the network. The most important of these steps is the use of multifactor authentication (MFA),\n\nwhich is important to raising friction for entry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey.\n\nOther steps, such as keeping up to date on patching and correct configuration, can be taken to identify and\n\nclose off vulnerable entry points.\n\n\nUse the phases as a starting plan for what to do first, next, and later to get the most impactful elements first.\n\nThese recommendations have been prioritized using the Zero Trust principle of assume breach, which focuses\n\non minimizing business risk by assuming the attackers can successfully gain access to your environment through\n\none or more methods.\n\nMicrosoft supports the guidance presented in the Ransomware Playbook by the Cyber Readiness Institute.[ Note 8 ]\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[3 steps to prevent and recover from ransomware Microsoft Security blog |](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/07/3-steps-to-prevent-and-recover-from-ransomware/)_ _(9/7/2021)_\n\n_[Rapidly protect against ransomware and extortion Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/protect-against-ransomware)_ _(8/24/2021)_\n\n_[Azure Sentinel Fusion Detection for Ransomware (microsoft.com) (8/9/2021)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/what-s-new-fusion-detection-for-ransomware/ba-p/2621373)_\n\n_[The growing threat of ransomware - Microsoft On the Issues (7/20/2021)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/20/the-growing-threat-of-ransomware/)_\n\n_[Human-operated ransomware Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/human-operated-ransomware)_ _(5/27/2021)_\n\n_[Ransom mafia analysis of the world's first ransomware cartel pdf (analyst1.com) (4/7/2021)](https://analyst1.com/file-assets/RANSOM-MAFIA-ANALYSIS-OF-THE-WORLD%E2%80%99S-FIRST-RANSOMWARE-CARTEL.pdf)_\n\n_[Ransomware Playbook - Cyber Readiness Institute](https://cyberreadinessinstitute.org/resource/ransomware-playbook/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Phishing and other malicious email\n\n###### Threat to identity\n\nIn 2020, the FBI IC3 Report[ Note 9 ] identified phishing\n\nas the top crime type for victim complaints. The\n\nnumber of reports doubled compared to the\n\nprevious year. Phishing poses a significant threat\n\nto both businesses and individuals, and credential\n\nphishing was leveraged in many of the most\n\ndamaging attacks last year.\n\n\nFrom our investigations on online organized crime\n\nnetworks involved in business email compromise\n\n(BEC), we noted broad diversification of how\n\ncredentials are obtained, verified, and later used\n\nthat may explain the increased threat. Threat actors\n\nare increasing their automation and purchasing\n\ntools to increase the value of their criminal\n\nactivities. Credentials belonging to unsuspecting\n\nvictims could be obtained from phishing websites\n\nthat impersonate a myriad of online services,\n\nautomatically scraping and parsing logs belonging\n\nto infected devices that record the keys typed on\n\nkeyboards to guessing where credentials from one\n\nbreached online service were reused on another.\n\nFor each credential, there are services that enrich\n\nthe information on the identity with additional\n\ndetails on the person’s identity that includes\n\nname, company they work for, roles, seniority in\n\ncompany, and industry associated to the company.\n\nWith this information, the identity could be used\n\nin BEC attacks, to send unsolicited messages\n\n(spam), to gather sensitive information, or to host\n\nphishing websites in related online accounts. Even\n\nwhen one attack occurs, accounts may be resold\n\nafter automated systems verify that they remain\n\ncompromised.\n\n\nIdentity is further threatened by impersonation\n\nas may be seen in BEC attacks where one party to\n\na financial transaction is impersonated to divert\n\npayments to an unauthorized recipient. Our\n\ninvestigations identified that threat actors would\n\nmonitor financially inclined messages to find an\n\nidentity to impersonate and thereafter register\n\nhomoglyph/imposter domains to resemble the email\n\nof the person being impersonated. In this case, the\n\nperson whose credentials were stolen would cause\n\nanother person to become a victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Emails determined as phish\n\n Top 10 verticals affected by phishing (Defender detections, June 2021)\n\n\n###### What we’re seeing \n\n**Types of malicious emails**\n\nWhether their goal is to phish credentials, redirect\n\na wire transfer to their own bank account, or\n\ndownload malware onto a machine, attackers are\n\nmost likely to utilize email as their initial entry\n\nvector for a campaign. While a lot of focus is given\n\nto credential phishing, malicious emails are used in\n\nmultiple types of cyber incidents. Microsoft security\n\nresearchers observe the following three most\n\ncommon types of malicious emails:\n\n**PHISHING**\n\nPhishing is the most common type of malicious\n\nemail observed in our threat signals. These emails\n\nare designed to trick an individual into sharing\n\nsensitive information, such as usernames and\n\npasswords, with an attacker. To do this, attackers\n\nwill craft emails using a variety of themes, such\n\nas productivity tools, password resets, or other\n\nnotifications with a sense of urgency to lure a user\n\nto click on a link.\n\nThe phishing webpages used in these attacks may\n\nutilize malicious domains, such as those purchased\n\nand operated by the attacker, or compromised\n\ndomains, where the attacker abuses a vulnerability\n\nin a legitimate website to host malicious content.\n\nThe phishing sites frequently copy well-known,\n\nlegitimate login pages, such as Office 365 or Google,\n\nto trick users into inputting their credentials. Once\n\nthe user inputs their credentials they will often\n\n\nbe redirected to a legitimate final site—such as\n\nthe real Office 365 login page—leaving the user\n\nunaware that actors have obtained their credentials.\n\nMeanwhile, the entered credentials are stored or\n\nsent to the attacker for later abuse or sale.\n\nAttackers also use consent phishing to send users\n\nlinks that, if clicked, will grant the attacker access\n\nand permissions to applications, such as via OAuth\n\n2.0 authorization protocol. In these instances, users\n\nmay unwittingly grant the attackers permissions to\n\napplications that enable them to access a wealth of\n\nsensitive information.\n\nThe number of phishing emails observed in\n\nMicrosoft Exchange global mail flow increased\n\nduring the period from June 2020 through June\n\n2021. We saw a pronounced surge in November\n\npotentially related to holiday-themed phishing, and\n\na subsequent decrease over the US winter holidays,\n\npotentially indicating that attackers send fewer\n\nmessages when many people are not working.\n\nWhile all industries receive phishing emails, some\n\nverticals within those industries tend to receive more\n\nphishing campaigns than others. The verticals most\n\naffected by phishing may change month to month\n\ndepending on several factors, including attacker\n\nobjectives, availability of leaked email addresses,\n\nor current events regarding specific sectors and\n\nindustries.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware emails per week\n\n There has been an overall downward trend in the number of emails containing malware.\n\n Top 15 Defender detections (June 2021)\n\n Spyware designed to steal credentials was the most common type of malware observed through email delivery and was detected three times as often as the next highest detection.\n\n\n**MALWARE DELIVERY**\n\nMalware delivery is another example of how threat\n\nactors utilize emails for their objectives. A variety\n\nof malware variants, such as Agent Tesla, IcedID,\n\nTrickbot, and Qakbot, use email as a primary method\n\nof distribution. These emails will use either links or\n\nattachments to deliver malware and many times use\n\ntechniques that overlap with phishing emails. For\n\nexample, both malware delivery email and phishing\n\nemail may use links that direct to a CAPTCHA test to\n\nevade detection from security technologies.\n\nSince malware does not rely on user interaction in\n\nthe same way phishing does, attackers can design\n\ntheir delivery to be less noticeable to the user. For\n\nexample, when using attachments as a delivery\n\nmethod, attackers may use a decoy document\n\nwith macros that, when enabled by the recipient,\n\ndownload the malware in the background without\n\nthe user’s knowledge. In these cases, the user may\n\nthink that the document is broken or isn’t intended\n\nfor them and may be completely unaware that\n\nmalicious software is running on their machine.\n\nOne of the most common methods of malware\n\ndelivery observed in the past year was through\n\npassword-protected archive files. These emails\n\ncontain archive files, such as ZIP attachments\n\nthat are password protected, to prevent security\n\ntechnologies from detonating and analyzing\n\nthem. However, the passwords for these files are\n\noften included in the body of the email to enable\n\n\nthe recipient to open the files and download the\n\nmalware. By using these archive files to house the\n\nmalicious document—frequently an Excel or Word\n\ndocument—the attackers can use a unique archive\n\nfile for every recipient, making it more difficult for\n\ndefenders to fully scope a campaign.\n\nInterestingly, between July 2020 and June 2021\n\nwe observed an overall downward trend in the\n\nnumber of emails containing malware, indicating\n\nthat attackers may be using other means of entry.\n\nIn addition, a few notable malware takedowns—\n\nnamely, Trickbot and Emotet—may have contributed\n\nto this overall decline. A large spike in October is\n\nassociated with the distribution of those malware\n\nvariants, and the rapid decrease following the spike\n\naligns to when the Trickbot malware was taken down\n\nby Microsoft.\n\nThe malware that attackers distribute via email\n\nchanges regularly for a variety of reasons, including\n\nmalware takedowns and attacker objectives. As\n\nshown in the chart on Defender detections for\n\nJune 2021, the most prolific malware observed by\n\nMicrosoft was Agent Tesla, which is a credential\nstealing spyware. The second most observed\n\nmalware, Tisifi, which identifies social engineering\n\nlures, was seen only one third as much as Agent\n\nTesla. EncDoc and CVE-2017-11882 as the third\n\nand fifth top detections indicate that attackers still\n\nfavor malicious documents as a common method\n\nof delivering a variety of threats. The fourth top\n\n\n-----\n\ndetection, HTML/Phish, includes only phishing\n\nemails that use an HTML attachment. These types of\n\nphishing frequently take the form of fake voicemail\n\nphishing messages.\n\n**BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE**\n\nWhile not the most prolific type of malicious email\n\nin terms of quantity, BEC has proven to be the\n\nmost financially impactful type of cybercrime.[ Note 10 ] BEC\n\noccurs when an attacker pretends to be a legitimate\n\nbusiness account—utilizing either a compromised\n\nemail address, a lookalike domain they have\n\nregistered, or a free email service such as Hotmail or\n\nGmail—and sends emails designed to trick recipients\n\ninto taking some financial action, handing over\n\nsensitive information, or providing assets, such as\n\ngift cards, to the attacker.\n\nThe most common type of BEC observed by\n\nMicrosoft in the past year was gift card scams. In\n\nthese scams, attackers will usually create a multitude\n\nof free email accounts, changing the display name\n\ndepending on the target, though attackers have\n\nalso registered their own domains for these attacks\n\nor have created target-specific free email accounts.\n\nThey will then pretend to be someone the recipient\n\nworks with (usually their boss or an executive at\n\ntheir company) and ask them to purchase gift cards\n\n(often with company funds). Frequently, these emails\n\nsuggest that the sender wants them for a family\n\n\nmember’s birthday gift or for employees as rewards.\n\nThe recipient is typically asked to send the digital\n\ngift cards to the attacker once purchased, but we\n\nhave also seen attackers asking the user to buy\n\nphysical gift cards and send a photo of the code on\n\nthe back of the card, enabling the attacker to resell\n\nthem online or trade them for cryptocurrency.\n\nA much more sophisticated and financially damaging\n\ntype of BEC is wire transfer fraud. In this type of\n\nBEC, actors will insert themselves into expected\n\nfinancial transactions and ask the recipient to adjust\n\nthe bank account information on an outgoing wire\n\ntransfer. The actors will masquerade as the intended\n\nrecipient of the funds, so this does not seem out of\n\nthe ordinary to the victim. Once the victim wires the\n\nmoney to the new account, it is withdrawn by the\n\nactors and may be difficult to retrieve. Companies\n\ncan help to avoid this type of scam by ensuring that\n\nfinancial policies require verification for changing\n\naccounts. Finance employees should verify via a\n\nmeans other than email—such as from a known,\n\ntrusted phone number with the recipient—before\n\nmaking account number changes that originate\n\nfrom emails. Additionally, utilizing impersonation\n\nprotections features in email security products can\n\nhelp prevent attackers from successfully conducting\n\nthis type of scam.\n\n\n**Detecting web-based phishing**\n\nIn the past year, web-based phishing attacks\n\nhave continued to become more sophisticated.\n\nPhishing kits used by web-based phishing attacks\n\ntypically use images, context-based content, and\n\nother advanced techniques to avoid detection.\n\nOur machine learning (ML) models and network\n\nheuristics must continuously evolve to maintain\n\neffective protection. The language used by attackers\n\nhas also improved significantly; past user guidance\n\nto look for poor spelling and grammar is now\n\nless effective, particularly against targeted, more\n\nadvanced attacks. Modern kits are sufficiently\n\nsophisticated to masquerade as legitimate content\n\nin their use of spelling, grammar, and imagery.\n\nPhishers are increasingly leveraging legitimate\n\ninfrastructure, but this pattern still accounts for a\n\nminority of detected phishing attacks. Microsoft\n\nSmartScreen detected more than a million unique\n\ndomains used in web-based phishing attacks in\n\nthe last year, of which compromised domains\n\nrepresented just over 5%. This 5% of domains\n\ntypically host phishing attacks on legitimate websites\n\nwithout disrupting any legitimate traffic so that their\n\nattack remains hidden for as long as possible.\n\n\nDomains created specifically for attacks tend\n\nto be active for shorter periods, and with fewer\n\nmalicious URLs, than attacks that abuse legitimate\n\ninfrastructure. Over the last year, Microsoft\n\nSmartScreen has seen an increase in attacks that\n\nbegin and end within as little as an hour or two.\n\n###### Malicious email techniques \n\nAttackers have adapted over time to make their\n\nemails more likely to evade detections and\n\nprotections by utilizing aspects of legitimate\n\nbusiness emails. Defenders need to protect the\n\ncompany but also have a duty to maintain the flow\n\nof business—and attackers rely on this fact to get\n\ntheir foot in the door. In the last year, Microsoft\n\nsecurity researchers have observed attackers using\n\nnumerous techniques across multiple malicious\n\nemail campaigns to make emails appear more\n\nlegitimate to both end users and protection\n\ntechnologies.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Some common techniques observed over the past year:**\n\n**COMPROMISED SENDERS > COMPROMISED SERVICES**\n\nFor years, attackers have used compromised senders to perpetuate phishing email chains, as they use the\n\nvictim’s email account to send additional phishing emails. While this is still extremely prevalent, many companies\n\nhave begun utilizing MFA, which reduces the effectiveness of this method. Attackers therefore are adjusting\n\ntheir methods to begin compromising entire email services, such as when NOBELIUM gained access to an email\n\nmarketing solution that enabled the attacker to send as multiple, legitimate addresses.[ Note 11 ]\n\n###### Phishing email using compromised service on behalf of legitimate companies\n\n\n**ABUSE OF LEGITIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE**\n\nDefenders have often told their end users to verify aspects within an email were legitimate before interacting\n\nwith that email, such as the sender and any links within the email. This advice is still valuable, but sometimes\n\nthe links and senders can look legitimate but contain malicious content. Attackers are shifting to abusing\n\nlegitimate infrastructure to mask the malicious content in their emails. For sender addresses, attackers may\n\nregister trial tenants for services such as Office 365, which make their email appear much more legitimate.\n\nAdditionally, attackers are using ways to mask the malicious domain in an email, either by using open redirects\n\nfrom legitimate domains or by abusing legitimate hosting platforms such as Google Drive or OneDrive. In these\n\ncases, it may be tricky for users to know when an email is legitimate or malicious.\n\n###### Legitimate infrastructure abuse\n\n Attackers abuse legitimate contact forms on websites to send emails, and legitimate Google sites to host malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FAKE REPLIES**\n\nIn addition to users being instructed to verify aspects of the email, such as the sender or links before interacting\n\nwith them, users have also been instructed not to interact with emails they are not expecting to receive. This is\n\nstill extremely valuable advice, but attackers are aware of this as well and have shifted their strategies to find\n\nways to convince recipients that they are expecting the email. One way that they do this is by crafting fake reply\n\nemails. In these cases, the attacker will take the contents of a previous email from a compromised mailbox, or\n\nwill craft an entirely new email, and include it in the body of the email in a way that appears that the new email\n\nis a reply. Users who have jobs that require them to email dozens of people per day may not remember each\n\nemail they have sent. Seeing a fake reply may convince them that they are expecting the email and cause them\n\nto interact with malicious links or attachments. Utilizing email security features that can notify a user when\n\nan email is being sent from a user they have not interacted with before can help mitigate this technique. This\n\ntechnique is a favorite of malware variants such as Emotet and IcedID and is also frequently used in BEC emails.\n\n###### Fake reply email\n\n Gift card scam BEC email using fake reply to trick the user into thinking they were expecting this email.\n\n\n**DEFENSE EVASION**\n\nWhile attackers are focusing their techniques on convincing the recipient to interact with an email, they are also\n\naware that all that effort will be worthless if the email is never delivered to the victim. Because of this, threat\n\nactors are developing new means of defense evasion in email. It used to be enough for an attacker to include\n\na password-protected archive file to evade detection, but most security technologies can now input passwords\n\nincluded in the email to detonate them and identify malicious content. Attackers have shifted to including\n\nCAPTCHAs and legitimate login screens for services such as Microsoft or Google that prevent detection\n\ntechnologies from reaching the malicious content.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The digital journey of stolen credentials\n\n\n###### Where do your stolen credentials go after they are entered into a fake web page?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Secret phishers: The hidden economy of sophisticated phish kits\n\nIt is a long-held perception among research and\n\nbusiness communities that victim credentials are\n\ndelivered to the individual (or group) operating\n\nphishing campaigns. Researchers within the\n\nsecurity community[ Note 12 ] have begun to identify more\n\nsophisticated kits in which not only are victim\n\ncredentials sent to the phishers running a phishing\n\ncampaign, but they are also likely going back\n\nto the kit’s originating author or a sophisticated\n\nintermediary who has modified the kit with a hidden\n\ncollection account before redistributing the kit. The\n\nMicrosoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has seen several\n\nvariations of this technique.\n\n\nThis stratification of the cybercrime world is an\n\nincreased threat to business infrastructure as\n\nphish kit authors are more technically skilled than\n\nthe phishers and have a much broader reach by\n\norders of magnitude. The anonymity of the dark\n\nweb enables this technique. Phishing has generally\n\nbeen known to be a scheme in which a phisher\n\n(or group of phishers) buys a kit on a dark web\n\nmarket, obtains infrastructure components such as\n\na server, a domain to host the imitation site, and an\n\nemail account or other endpoint to receive victim\n\ninformation. Once the infrastructure is assembled,\n\nthey essentially just “stick their poles in the water”—\n\nthe entire process is designed to be as easy as\n\npossible by the authors and distributers of kits.\n\nAlthough it is important not to overgeneralize, these\n\n\nplug-and-play phishers have largely been viewed\n\nas lower-level coders compared to the much more\n\nsophisticated phish kit author and mastermind of\n\nthe overall operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Phish kits and credential harvesting\n\n\n-----\n\n### What’s in Microsoft’s phishing defense toolbox? How we approach employee awareness\n\n###### In 2020, the industry saw a surge of phishing campaigns that has remained steady throughout 2021. Internally at Microsoft, we saw an increase in overall number of phishing emails, a downward trend in emails containing malware, and a rise in voice phishing (or vishing).\n\nFortunately, we were prepared with an effective foundation of protective controls to reduce the number of\n\nsuccessful phishing attempts, and acknowledging the evolving threat landscape, we had expanded our controls\n\nto cover other vectors that could be exploited (beyond email, such as Forms and Teams).\n\n###### What’s in our toolbox\n\nThere is not a silver bullet fix for phishing; it must be solved through a multipronged approach. We focus on four\n\nprimary elements: Protective controls, User awareness, Reporting and insights, and Detect and respond.\n\n\n###### Trends at Microsoft, 2020-2021\n\n\n###### With these methods, we have seen a 50% year-over-year reduction in susceptibility.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo matter how many protective controls we have in place, mitigation remains a crucial element to combating\n\nthe phish that make it through our defenses as threat actors increase their level of sophistication. Our security\n\noperations center is equipped with Microsoft Defender for Office 365’s tools and automation to quickly detect,\n\ninvestigate, and effectively remediate malicious emails. For us, the automated incident response features have\n\nbeen key in enabling our team to move quickly because minutes matter.\n\n###### Training followed by simulations, reinforcement, and targeted simulations\n\n Despite the increased sophistication of phish, susceptibility of employees has decreased, attributed to increased frequency of simulations and training.\n\n\nBeyond detection and protection, it is imperative that we cultivate a security-conscious culture, equip our\n\nemployees (our last line of defense) with skills to identify a phish, and provide a simple reporting mechanism\n\nthat is a consistent experience across all platforms. Employee reporting is vital, but closing the feedback loop by\n\nvalidating the report is just as important.\n\n\n###### Beyond detection and protection, it is imperative that we cultivate a security-conscious culture.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur approach to employee phishing awareness includes annual foundational training, simulated exercises, and\n\npositive reinforcement. Simulations leveraging Microsoft Defender for Office 365’s Attack Simulator and Training\n\nare built on incidents insights to ensure we are exposing our employees to phish that are realistic to the level\n\nof sophistication we may see in our environment. Employees who repeatedly fall susceptible to simulations are\n\nphished on a more frequent basis to increase their opportunity to learn through experience and preventative\n\nguidance. We also run targeted campaigns focused on high-risk groups such as new employees, executives, and\n\n###### Employee phishing awareness\n\n\ntheir support staff. The findings from our simulated exercises are also leveraged to identify opportunities within\n\nthe product to aid employees in identifying phish (such as safety tips).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Automatically triage phish submissions in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/automatically-triage-phish-submissions-in-microsoft-defender-for/ba-p/2733752)_ _(9/9/2021)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Summary of recommendations about malicious emails\n\n\n1. Use MFA to lessen the impact of credentials\n\nbeing phished by attackers.\n\n2. Develop robust user education processes that\n\nuse positive reinforcement to teach users how\n\nto identify potentially malicious emails. Create\n\nprocesses wherein users can report suspicious\n\nemails and can receive feedback on whether\n\nthe email they submitted was indeed malicious.\n\nFocus extra training on groups that may be\n\nmore heavily targeted, such as executives,\n\nexecutive assistants, and finance employees.\n\nShare real-world phishing examples that your\n\ncompany has received with your end users so\n\nthat they understand the threat and know what\n\nto expect.\n\n3. Surface external emails to recipients by\n\nappending a tag to the subject line of any\n\nemail that originates from an email address\n\noutside of your organization.\n\n4. Enable features that allow users to spot\n\nemails coming from senders they have not\n\ncommunicated with in the past.\n\n5. Review mail flow rules to ensure that broad\n\nrules are not inadvertently allowing malicious\n\nemails to be delivered.\n\n\n6. Create and enforce finance policies that require\n\nemployees to verify any account information\n\nchanges, including wire transfer information,\n\nwith the account holder.\n\n7.

Despite the wide range of\n\noutcomes such as ransom, data loss, credential\n\ntheft, and espionage, most pieces of malware rely\n\non similar strategies for establishing themselves in a\n\nnetwork. Windows PowerShell launched by malicious\n\nprocesses with suspicious commands or encoded\n\nvalues was the most common behavior Microsoft\n\nobserved from malware in recent months. The next\n\nmost common were attempts by malware to rename\n\npayloads to mimic system processes or replace them\n\nentirely, and using malware to collect data such as\n\ncredentials from browser caches.\n\n\nOther noteworthy behaviors and protection\n\nopportunities for security operation centers are the\n\nuse of specific reconnaissance commands, processes\n\nbeing added to startup folders, scheduled task or\n\nregistry alterations, and malicious process execution\n\nby abuse of Office documents. These behaviors\n\nstand out due to widespread use among all malware\n\nregardless of sophistication, though Microsoft has\n\nalso observed more specific tactics that are more\n\ndifficult for enterprises to mitigate.\n\n**_Fileless malware and evasive behavior_**\n\n“Fileless” malware is malware that derives most of\n\nits components from system processes or legitimate\n\ntools already on a device, which can make it harder\n\nto remove and detect, since more than a single file\n\nneeds to be removed. Persistence strategies can\n\ninclude registry, scheduled task, and startup folder\n\npersistence to remove the necessity for malware to\n\nremain a static item in the filesystem. Free or easily\n\navailable remote access trojans (RATs), banking\n\ntrojans, and offensive toolkits like Cobalt Strike are\n\nroutinely utilizing process injection and in-memory\n\nexecution. These are methods of abusing stolen\n\nadministrative privileges to move malicious code\n\ninto running benign processes rather than in static\n\nfiles, to circumvent easy removal. To combat these\n\nkinds of behaviors it is imperative that security\n\nteams within organizations review their incident\n\nresponse and malware removal processes to include\n\nsufficient forensics to ensure common malware\n\npersistence mechanisms have been fully remediated\n\n\n###### Alert counts by activity (May-June 2021)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Legitimate service abuse in network_**\n\n**_communications_**\n\nAnother tactic used in many malware campaigns\n\nthis past year utilized legitimate sites in almost\n\nevery stage of malware: delivery, reconnaissance,\n\ncommand and control, exfiltration, malicious\n\nadvertising, and cryptocurrency mining. Cloud\n\nservices such as Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive,\n\nAdobe Spark, Dropbox, and others are still very\n\npopular for use as initial delivery of malware, while\n\ncontent “pasting” sites such as Pastebin.com,\n\nArchive.org, and Stikked.ch are increasingly popular\n\nfor covert use in multi-part and fileless malware.\n\nIn the last case, the code used in the malware is\n\npulled directly from the pasting site and executed\n\nimmediately into memory, bypassing the need to\n\ndownload malware as a single file.\n\n**Larger trends in malware propagation and**\n\n**behavior**\n\n**BOTNET RENOVATIONS**\n\nBotnet as a term has been evolving as well.\n\nHistorically it was used to refer to a network of\n\ncomputers completing tasks for an operator.\n\nHowever, now most malware families could\n\npotentially be classified as having botnet\n\ncomponents or behaviors.\n\nAs historically prevalent malware botnet\n\ninfrastructures such as Trickbot and Emotet were\n\ndisrupted, other malware families have replaced\n\nthem. In their place, older botnets as well as a new\n\n\n###### Emotet encounters\n\n In January 2021, law enforcement performed a takedown, which led to the demise of the Emotet family of malware and a dramatic subsequent decrease in Emotet encounters.[ Note 14]\n\n\noptimization strategies and by utilizing existing\n\ninfections to install browser extensions to modify\n\nsearch results and to surface illicit material attacker\n\ncontent.\n\nThis was the case in 2020 with the Adrozek[ Note 16 ]\n\nmalware, a browser extension used where infected\n\ndevices would use browser extensions to replace\n\nlegitimate search results with links to malware\n\nimpersonating Microsoft products and other\n\nlegitimate software. The operators of Gootkit, a\n\nmalware infection that can led to ransomware,\n\nused a slightly different technique to abuse search\n\nengines by purchasing advertising in 2020 to uplift\n\nthe links to compromised sites hosting the malware.\n\nOther information-stealing malware, such as Jupyter\n\nor SolarMarker, used yet another method to appear\n\nin search results by using documents hosted\n\non services such as AWS, Google, and Strikingly\n\ncontent delivery network to lead users searching\n\nfor common terms via search results to PDF pages\n\nthat would ultimately establish persistence on their\n\ndevice.\n\nInformation stealing, data exfiltration, and other\n\nareas of malware delivery can increasingly leverage\n\nbrowser modifications and search results to achieve\n\ntheir ends. This continues to solidify a class of\n\nmalware leveraging the browser for delivery and\n\nexploit across both consumer and enterprise sectors.\n\n\nclass of evasive malware began delivering more\n\nsevere secondary components at faster speeds.\n\nIn January 2021, law enforcement performed a\n\ntakedown, which led to the demise of the Emotet\n\nfamily of malware and a dramatic subsequent\n\ndecrease in Emotet encounters. Botnets such as\n\nPhorpiex[ Note 15 ] gradually increased in number of infected\n\nbase hosts and delivered numerous ransomware and\n\nsecondary malware components to further monetize\n\nits behavior, including the Avaddon ransomware.\n\nBotnets such as Lemon Duck, Purple Fox, and\n\nSysrv-Hello, surged this past year, incorporating\n\nnew programming languages, new infrastructure,\n\n\nand new infection methods as well. Lemon Duck, as\n\nwith most emerging botnets, uses over 10 distinct\n\nmethods of infection across Windows and Linux\n\nenvironments. Newer botnets are also quick to begin\n\nusing new vulnerabilities to infect servers. Despite\n\nthis, most methods still rely on unpatched edge\n\napplications, lateral movement via connected drives,\n\nand weak credentials on available services.\n\n**SEO AND MALICIOUS ADVERTISING**\n\nSearch engine results and advertising are also an\n\nincreasingly effective means of delivering malware to\n\nend users, both via abusing legitimate search engine\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Browser search results manipulation\n\n Comparison of search results pages on an unaffected machine and one with Adrozek running.\n\n\nto gather data from and monetize the networks\n\nthat they have access to. In addition, the volume\n\nof network traffic plus the usual noise of constant\n\ninternet attacks means that targeted traffic aimed\n\nat a web server can blend right in, making detection\n\nof web shells a lot more difficult and requiring\n\nadvanced behavior-based detections.\n\nIn February 2020, we reported a steady increase\n\nin the use of web shells in attacks worldwide. The\n\nlatest Microsoft 365 Defender data shows that this\n\ntrend not only continued, but it also accelerated;\n\nin every month from August 2020 to January 2021,\n\nwe registered an average of 140,000 encounters of\n\nthese threats on servers, which was almost double\n\nthe 77,000 monthly average.\n\nThroughout 2021 we saw an even bigger increase,\n\nwith an average of 180,000 encounters per month.\n\nIn March 2021, we saw a huge spike in web shell\n\nencounters, which we attributed to the HAFNIUM\n\nnation state activity group targeting Exchange\n\nservers with 0-day exploits.\n\nIn March and April of 2021, as exploit code became\n\navailable for web-facing on-premises Exchange\n\nservers, we saw a large spike in web shell detection\n\nrates. This was due to multiple threat actors using\n\na “compromise first, monetize later” approach that\n\ntakes advantage of customer patching delays. Actors\n\njump on opportunities as soon they arise.\n\n\n**MALWARE TOOLS**\n\nMalware has evolved to take advantage of tools\n\nthat are available and, in some cases, are not\n\ninherently malicious. One prime example has\n\nbeen the use of Cobalt Strike, a commercial\n\npenetration testing tool. While Cobalt Strike is a\n\npenetration testing, it has been used more and\n\nmore frequently in various attacks, ranging from\n\nnation state to human-operated ransomware, to\n\n\nperform system and network discovery actions and\n\nmove laterally through a network. Cobalt Strike is\n\nspecifically designed to evade traditional detection\n\nmethodologies and offers the operator a range\n\nof options for performing obfuscation of their\n\nattack commands. These obfuscation techniques\n\nthemselves can however become a signal, and\n\nidentifying Cobalt Strike has become more essential\n\nthan ever as the cybercriminal economy leads to\n\n\nmalware that plants Cobalt Strike quickly, handing\n\noff to ransomware operators.\n\n**WEB SHELLS DEEP DIVE**\n\nWeb shells remain popular with advanced\n\npersistent threat (APT) actors of all types, including\n\nNOBELIUM[ Note 17 ] and HAFNIUM[ Note 18 ] nation state activity\n\ngroups. As DART and the Microsoft 365 Defender\n\nResearch Team reported in both 2020[ Note 19 ] and 2021,[ Note 20 ]\n\nweb shell usage continues to climb among nation\n\nstate groups and criminal organizations. Web\n\nshell is a piece of malicious code, often written in\n\ntypical web development programming languages\n\n(such as ASP, PHP, or JSP), that attackers implant\n\non web servers to provide remote access and code\n\nexecution to server functions. Web shells allow\n\nadversaries to execute commands and steal data\n\nfrom a web server or use the server as a launch pad\n\nfor further attacks against the affected organization.\n\nThe escalating prevalence of web shells may be\n\nattributed to how simple and effective they can\n\nbe for attackers. Once installed on a server, web\n\nshells serve as one of the most effective means of\n\npersistence in an enterprise. We frequently see cases\n\nwhere web shells are used solely as a persistence\n\nmechanism. Web shells guarantee that a backdoor\n\nexists in a compromised network, because an\n\nattacker leaves a malicious implant after establishing\n\nan initial foothold on a server. If left undetected,\n\nweb shells provide a way for attackers to continue\n\n\n-----\n\nTo minimize risk, organizations should accelerate their deployment of security updates, especially for internet\nfacing systems. To minimize risk, organizations should accelerate their deployment of security updates,\n\nespecially for internet-facing systems.\n\n###### Web shell encounters, Defender signals (September 2020-June 2021)\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[HAFNIUM targeting Exchange Servers with 0-day exploits Microsoft Security Blog |](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)_ _(3/2/2021)_\n\n_[Web shell attacks continue to rise - Microsoft Security (2/11/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/)_\n\n_[Ghost in the shell: Investigating web shell attacks - Microsoft Security (2/4/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/02/04/ghost-in-the-shell-investigating-web-shell-attacks/)_\n\n\n###### Summary of recommendations for malware prevention\n\n1. Install security updates on all applications and operating systems promptly.\n\n2. Enable real-time protection through an antimalware solution, such as Microsoft Defender.\n\n3. Mitigate large attack vectors such as macro abuse, exposed edge services, insecure default configurations,\n\nlegacy authentication, unsigned script types, and suspicious executions from certain file types delivered\n\nthrough email. Microsoft offers some of these larger mitigations through the use of attack surface\n\nreduction rules[ Note 21 ] to prevent malware infection. Azure Active Directory users may also leverage security\n\ndefaults[ Note 22 ] to establish baseline authentication security for cloud environments.\n\n4. Enable Endpoint Detection and Response functionality to analyze and respond to threats based on\n\nindividual behaviors and techniques proactively.\n\n5. Enable domain and IP-based protections on hosts as well as at network gateways, if possible, to ensure\n\ninfrastructure-based coverage is complete.\n\n6. Turn on potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) protection. Many antimalware solutions may label\n\ninitial access threats such as adware, torrent downloaders, RATs, and Remote Management Services\n\n(RMS) as PUA. Occasionally, these types of software may be disabled by default to prevent impact to an\n\nenvironment.\n\n7. Determine where highly privileged accounts are logging on and exposing credentials. Monitor and\n\ninvestigate logon events for logon type attributes. Highly privileged accounts should not be present on\n\nworkstations.\n\n8. Practice the principle of least privilege and maintain credential hygiene. Avoid the use of domain-wide,\n\nadmin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of RATs\n\nand other unwanted applications.\n\n9. Educate users about malware threats, such as RATs, that can propagate through email as well as through\n\nweb downloads and search engines.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Use attack surface reduction rules to prevent malware infection Microsoft Docs|](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide)_ _(6/23/2021)_\n\n_[Turn on network protection Microsoft Docs|](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection?view=o365-worldwide)_ _(6/14/2021)_\n\n_[Block potentially unwanted applications with Microsoft Defender Antivirus Microsoft Docs|](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)_ _(6/02/2021)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Malicious domains\n\nAny domain used in the pursuit of cybercrime can\n\nbe considered malicious. Malicious domains can\n\nbe legitimate sites which have been compromised\n\nto enable criminals to host malicious content on\n\nsubdomains, or they can be entirely fraudulent\n\ninfrastructure set up for the commission of a crime.\n\nCybercriminals use malicious domains for three\n\nprimary functions: information transmission, location\n\nobfuscation, and building resiliency against those\n\nseeking to interfere with their criminal activities.\n\nDomains are used for data exfiltration, controlling\n\nransomware communication, hosting phishing\n\npages, and providing control to malware. They\n\nare also used as email domains to create visually\n\nidentical imposter email aliases for deception.\n\nFraudulent domains can use trademarks to deceive\n\ncustomers or provide a platform for fraud, such as\n\nfraudulent technical support sites.\n\n\n###### Domain proliferation and threat mitigation\n\nThe number of domains available on the internet\n\nhas mushroomed over the past several years. This\n\nincludes country code top-level domains (cTLDs)\n\nsuch as .uk, .ca, and .cn; generic top-level domains\n\n(gTLDs) such as .com, .net, and org; and over 1,200\n\nnew gTLDs that were introduced into the Domain\n\nName System (DNS) in 2013. Due to the sheer\n\nnumber of top-level domains, and the growing\n\necosystem of domain name registries, domain\n\nregistrars, and domain registration service providers,\n\nmitigating cyber threats from malicious domains\n\nhas been further complicated. Uniformity in cyber\n\nthreat mitigation across the ecosystem is critical.\n\nThere is movement in this direction as evidenced\n\nby recent language incorporated into the Internet\n\nCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\n\n(ICANN) agreements with registries, which includes\n\nterms of use that define and prohibit illegal activity,\n\nand a requirement for registries to develop their\n\nown anti-abuse policy and monitor and address\n\nabusive activity.\n\n\n###### How domains are being used for malware \n\nA malicious domain is often used as a destination\n\nto which malware victims are directed. In this way,\n\nthe domain both initiates the establishment of a\n\ncommunications channel with the victim and reveals\n\nthe infected victim’s location. Knowing a victim’s\n\nlocation is important as cybercriminals use a myriad\n\nof methods to disseminate their malware but are\n\nunable to anticipate where it will ultimately be\n\nsuccessfully downloaded. Therefore, cybercriminals\n\nengineer their malware to “phone home” to a\n\nmalicious domain. Newly infected computers\n\nimmediately reach out to such domains, effectively\n\n“announcing” their location via IP addresses. There\n\nare two primary ways domains are used for these\n\npurposes in malware:\n\n**Domains aid in obfuscating and hiding the**\n\n**cybercriminals’ location and identity**\n\nDomains directly added to malware (or “hard\ncoded” domains) and incorporated into the\n\ncommunications infrastructure can effectively hide\n\nthe cybercriminal’s true location. The cybercriminal\n\nsets up a domain as a proxy, or “stepping-stone,”\n\nwhich redirects the communications with a victim\n\nto another domain or IP. This process can consist\n\nof multiple “hops” spanning domains associated\n\nwith top-level domains from around the world. It is\n\ncommon for cybercriminals to use fictitious names,\n\nemails, and addresses and pay for the domains with\n\nl di d bl di i l\n\n\n**Domains can be a mechanism to build resiliency**\n\n**into the infrastructure**\n\nCybercriminals are now routinely adding domain\n\ngenerating algorithms (DGAs) to their malware,\n\nproviding a fallback mechanism for when hard\ncoded malicious domains are seized by law\n\nenforcement, for example. To utilize DGAs, malicious\n\nsoftware includes code to generate lists of domains\n\nbuilt using random characters or strings that change\n\nbased on the day, time, and year. For example,\n\non Friday, June 4, 2022, the DGA might generate\n\nthree domains, such as ahu3rrfsirraqrty.com,\n\nhyrssgu5oqr4cetc.com, and wkcclsoqqpcaty.com,\n\nand the malware would attempt to contact those\n\ndomains in that order. The use of DGAs increases\n\nthe cost and complexity of disrupting cybercriminal\n\ncommunications infrastructure, requiring disruptors\n\nto monitor hundreds of thousands of potentially\n\nmalicious domains, whereas the cybercriminal needs\n\nonly one of them.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Disrupting malicious domain infrastructure \n\n**Disrupting domains on Microsoft-hosted services**\n\nCybercriminals are now increasingly abusing\n\nMicrosoft and third-party clouds as well as the\n\nservices information workers and consumers use for\n\nday-to-day collaboration (such as email). Microsoft\n\ntakes numerous steps to reduce cloud hosting\n\nabuse. We proactively detect abuse of the Microsoft\n\ncloud at the hosting source and neutralize it before\n\nattacks start or scale; we act on detections in our\n\nservices (as in Office 365 email) and route this\n\nknowledge to internal services that can neutralize\n\nthe threat; we act on customer and third-party\n\nreports; and we notify third-party industry partners\n\nof abuse on their cloud, detected by using our\n\nsecurity services, so they can act to neutralize it\n\nat their hosting source. In the three-month period\n\nbetween May and July 2021, we disabled roughly\n\n15,850 phishing sites hosted on Azure. We closely\n\nmonitor abuse and evaluate new ways to detect and\n\nneutralize hosting of malicious sites\n\n\n**Disrupting third-party-hosted domains through**\n\n**legal action**\n\nGiven that cybercriminals are increasingly deploying\n\nprivate technical infrastructure, including malicious\n\ndomains, to carry out a wide range of cybercrime,\n\nit is incumbent on organizations and individuals\n\nto establish the necessary legal and technical\n\ncapabilities to disrupt this infrastructure through\n\nlegal actions.\n\nIn recent years, the private sector has used a variety\n\nof legal theories to pursue disruption through\n\ncivil actions in federal court. Criminal statutes\n\ndirected at hacking and unlawful access frequently\n\nprovide a civil cause of action to target malicious\n\ninfrastructure. In particular, the Computer Fraud and\n\nAbuse Act (CFAA), the Wiretap Act, and the Stored\n\nCommunications Act are frequently asserted legal\n\ntheories. Very frequently trademark theories under\n\nthe Lanham Act[ Note 23 ] are asserted as cybercriminals\n\nleverage trusted brands to deceive victims. In many\n\ncases, infringing domains provide the critical part of\n\nmalicious technical infrastructure and often include\n\nwholesale counterfeit reproduction of legitimate\n\ncontent to confuse victims and advance criminal\n\nschemes.\n\n\n###### The next big threat: “Forever” (blockchain) domains  \n\nBlockchain domains are an emerging threat outside\n\nof regulation. Over the last two years, the adaptation\n\nof blockchain technology has skyrocketed across\n\nmany business verticals. Real-life applications of\n\nblockchain technology range from supply chain\n\nmanagement, identity management, real estate\n\ncontracts, and domain infrastructure. In recent\n\nyears, we have observed blockchain domains\n\nintegrated into cybercriminal infrastructure and\n\noperations. We first observed this on a large scale\n\nwhen investigating the Necurs botnet that reigned\n\nterror worldwide for years with its ability to send\n\nmalicious spam, often with ransomware payloads.\n\nNecurs contained a robust backup system, which\n\nincorporated a DGA. In one of its DGA versions,\n\nNecurs produced 2,048 new domains from 43\n\ndifferent TLDs approximately every 30 days,\n\nincluding the blockchain domain TLD “.bit.”\n\n\nPursuing the appropriate remedy is an essential\n\ncomponent of an effectively disruptive legal action.\n\nA well-crafted injunction that relies on the broad\n\nequitable authority of federal courts enables\n\nplaintiffs to obtain flexible court orders permitting\n\nthem to exercise control over the cybercrime\n\ninfrastructure. To obtain such relief, plaintiffs\n\nfrequently invoke statutes that support seizure of\n\nphysical devices, computers, and servers used for\n\ncriminal purposes. Malicious domains engaged in\n\ncriminal activity can also be subject to seizure under\n\nvarious federal statutes and equitable theories. In\n\nseveral civil cases, federal courts have granted this\n\nsort of injunction for violations of the CFAA, the\n\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act, the Lanham\n\nAct, and common law claims. These legal claims\n\nalso support court orders that direct transfer or\n\ndisablement of domains and/or IP addresses. In this\n\nscenario, courts grant the transfer or disablement\n\nof malicious infrastructure to a private plaintiff’s\n\ncontrol, and away from the control of defendants,\n\nwhich effectively disrupts the technical capability of\n\ncybercriminals to launch attacks and inflict harm.\n\n\n###### Blockchain domains are an emerging threat outside of regulation.\n\n\n###### FPO\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike traditional domains that are purchased\n\nthrough internet registrars operating through\n\nthe ICANN-regulated DNS system, blockchain\n\ndomains are not governed by any centralized body,\n\nlimiting the opportunity for abuse reporting and\n\nenforcement disruptions.\n\nTraditionally, blockchain domain purchases are\n\nmade through a crypto wallet with cryptocurrency\n\nfrom a blockchain DNS provider. Crypto wallets\n\nutilize asymmetric encryption, which involves both a\n\nprivate and public key for the blockchain transaction.\n\nAfter the transaction has been executed, the domain\n\nname, domain IP, and transaction hash are recorded\n\ninto the blockchain. Moving forward, the only entity\n\nthat can make changes to the IP recorded on the\n\nblockchain is the person with the wallet and private\n\nkey who made the initial transaction to purchase the\n\ndomain.\n\n\nBlockchain domains work differently and pose\n\nchallenges from both a utilization and disruption\n\nstandpoint. Blockchain domains function either\n\nthrough software/browser plug-in or proxy\n\nresolution services. The challenge for cybercriminals\n\nwith respect to blockchain domains is getting the\n\nmost updated IP address from the blockchain to the\n\ncomputer trying to resolve the blockchain domain to\n\nan IP address. Because blockchain domains operate\n\noutside the normal DNS channels, malware authors\n\nmust include additional resolution instructions\n\nfor infected victims. These instructions are usually\n\nhard-coded into the malware and point the infected\n\nsystem to a blockchain proxy resolution service IP.\n\nOver the years, there have been several projects\n\non the internet to operate free unregulated DNS\n\nand support the resolution of blockchain domains.\n\nMost recently, the OpenNic project, which operates\n\nunder the mission statement of “DNS neutrality and\n\nprovide uncensored DNS access,” took on the task\n\nof resolving “.bit” crypto domains. Several years into\n\nthe project, because of reported widespread abuse\n\nof “.bit” domains, the OpenNic project decided to\n\nstop resolving “.bit” domains.[ Note 24]\n\n\n**Big threats using blockchain domains**\n\nThe threat landscape of criminal infrastructure\n\nis constantly shifting to avoid detection and\n\ndisruption. Within the past year, some of the bigger\n\nthreat actors on the internet have started utilizing\n\nblockchain domains as part of their infrastructure.\n\nTrickbot, the notorious banking trojan which has\n\nevolved its business model into providing access\n\nto high-value targets in the ransomware space,\n\nstarted using “.bazar” domains provided by\n\nEmercoin blockchain DNS. The more recent threat,\n\nBazarloader, which has connections to Trickbot,\n\nstarted deploying a unique version of its DGA\n\nthat uses “.bazar” domains. This trend of threats\n\nleveraging blockchain domains as infrastructure\n\nwith the means to create an undisputable criminal\n\nnetwork should be taken seriously.\n\n\nInvestigating blockchain domains provides a unique\n\nchallenge because there is no central WHOIS\n\nregistration database tracking who registered the\n\ndomain and when. Fortunately, some blockchain\n\nDNS providers like Emercoin have provided access\n\nto a block explorer tool,[ Note 25 ] which enables a search for\n\ndomain names, transaction hashes, and other values\n\nthat might be stored in the blockchain. The Emercoin\n\nblockchain is pseudo-anonymous but can reveal\n\nsome interesting information about a blockchain\n\ndomain, such as IP addresses and transaction dates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Countering blockchain domains might not be as**\n\n**difficult as you think**\n\nThe weakness in blockchain domains is the need\n\nfor third-party proxy services or browser plug-ins\n\nto resolve blockchain domains to an IP. Disabling or\n\nblocking the blockchain proxy resolution services\n\nand disabling browser plug-ins will disable the\n\nability for blockchain domain resolution. Many threat\n\nintelligence vendors provide malicious URL feeds,\n\nwhich sometimes include blockchain resolution\n\nproxies or the blockchain domain itself.\n\n\n###### Blockchain domains have become a preferred choice for cybercrime infrastructure \n\n\n-----\n\n##### Adversarial machine learning\n\nMachine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI)\n\ntechnique that can be used in numerous applications,\n\nincluding cybersecurity. In responsible ML innovation,\n\ndata scientists and developers build, train, and\n\ndeploy ML models to understand, protect, and\n\ncontrol data and processes to build trusted solutions.\n\nHowever, adversaries can attack these ML-driven\n\nsystems. The methods underpinning the production\n\nML systems are systematically vulnerable to a new\n\nclass of vulnerabilities across the ML supply chain\n\ncollectively known as “adversarial ML.” Adversaries\n\ncan exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate AI\n\nsystems and alter their behavior to serve a malicious\n\nend goal.\n\n\n###### The adversarial ML threat matrix \n\nMicrosoft worked with MITRE to create the\n\nAdversarial ML Threat Matrix because we believe the\n\nfirst step in empowering security teams to defend\n\nagainst attacks on ML systems is to have a framework\n\nthat systematically organizes the techniques\n\nemployed by malicious adversaries in subverting\n\nML systems. We hope that the security community\n\ncan use the tabulated tactics and techniques to\n\nbolster their monitoring strategies around their\n\norganizations’ mission-critical ML systems.\n\n**1. Primary audience is security analysts:**\n\nWe think that securing ML systems is an\n\ninfosec problem. The goal of the Adversarial\n\nML Threat Matrix is to position attacks on\n\nML systems in a framework where security\n\nanalysts can orient themselves in these new\n\nand upcoming threats. The matrix is structured\n\nlike the ATT&CK framework, owing to its\n\nwide adoption among the security analyst\n\ncommunity. This way, security analysts have a\n\nfamiliar framework to learn about threats to\n\nML systems, which are inherently different from\n\ntraditional attacks on corporate networks.\n\n\n**2. Grounded in real attacks on ML systems:**\n\nWe seeded this framework with a curated set\n\nof vulnerabilities and adversary behaviors\n\nthat Microsoft and MITRE vetted to be\n\neffective against production ML systems,\n\nenabling security analysts to focus on realistic\n\nthreats. We also incorporated learnings from\n\nMicrosoft’s vast experience in this space into\n\nthe framework. For instance, we found that\n\nmodel stealing is not the end goal of the\n\nattacker but in fact leads to more insidious\n\nmodel evasion. We also found that when\n\nattacking an ML system, attackers use a\n\ncombination of traditional techniques like\n\nphishing and lateral movement alongside\n\nadversarial ML techniques.\n\n\n###### Intentional failure modes in ML\n\nMicrosoft has incorporated AI- and ML-specific\n\nsecurity practices into its Security Development\n\nLifecycle (SDL) to protect Microsoft products and\n\nservices against these attacks. In addition to threat\n\ndetection and mitigation development work and\n\nautomation, we have published guidance on steps\n\ncustomers can take to build defense in depth into\n\ntheir own AI and ML systems.\n\nThe centerpiece of the materials we’ve published is\n\ncalled Failure Modes in Machine Learning,[ Note 26 ] which\n\nlays out the terminology we developed jointly with\n\nthe Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at\n\nHarvard University. It includes vocabulary that can\n\nbe used to describe intentional failures caused by\n\nan adversary attempting to alter results or steal an\n\nalgorithm, as well as vocabulary for unintentional\n\nfailures such as a system that produces results that\n\nmight be unsafe.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacks on ML models\n\n|Attack|Description|Example|\n|---|---|---|\n|Evasion attack|Attacker modifies the query in a way that causes a model misclassification.|Self-driving cars By manipulating a stop sign, or the environment observed by the car’s image recognition system, the adversary causes a model misclassification. In this way, a self-driving car could be made to ignore the stop sign.|\n|Poisoning attack|Attacker contaminates the training phase of ML systems to get intended result. The attacker wants to misclassify specific examples to cause specific actions to be taken or omitted.|Critical infrastructure systems By submitting antivirus software as malware, an adversary can force its misclassification as malicious thereby eliminating the use of the antivirus software on client systems. This could leave critical infrastructure systems open to attack.|\n|Membership Inference|Attacker can infer if a given data record was part of the model’s training dataset or not.|Healthcare information An adversary could look at a model trained on a body of data consisting of people with a specific surgical procedure. By knowing that a particular individual’s data was in the training set, an adversary would then know the individual had the surgical procedure. This privacy violation could then be leveraged publicly.|\n|Model Stealing|Attacker is able to recover the model through carefully crafted queries.|Finance algorithms Through model queries, an adversary could reconstruct the potential outputs of the ML model. This could be used to adversely affect proprietary algorithms designed for high frequency stock trading in a particular market.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacker evasions \n\nAn evasion attack is an exploratory attack against\n\nan ML model to cause an integrity violation. From\n\na system’s security perspective, it is instructive to\n\nconsider black-box evasion attacks, in which an\n\nattacker may have no specific knowledge of the\n\ninner workings of the ML model but instead effects\n\nchange by submitting inputs and observing the\n\ncorresponding system output. This threat model\n\nis common to many AI systems hosted as a cloud\n\nservice or on a consumer device, for example, and is\n\na concern for models in finance, healthcare, defense,\n\nfraud, and security.\n\n\nSophisticated black-box evasion attacks against\n\nML models have been demonstrated repeatedly\n\nby white-hat researchers by using algorithms that\n\niteratively determine what input will cause an\n\nintegrity violation. Today, however, threat actors in\n\nthe wild may also attempt evasion of ML systems\n\nin some domains, but usually do so through\n\nmanual rather than algorithmic means and do not\n\nnecessarily focus exclusively on ML as the evasion\n\ntarget. For example, content moderation filters are\n\nbypassed by mischievous or economically motivated\n\nusers by obscuring payload content in creative\n\nways. Security products that include antimalware or\n\nantiphishing models are evaded by adversaries using\n\nseveral obfuscation techniques. That these target\n\nsystems rely on ML is not necessarily a consideration\n\nin these practical manual evasion attacks.\n\nWhether or not an adversary is present in your\n\nbusiness domain, the risk of adversaries evading\n\nan ML model exists in every domain. An ML model\n\nis an imperfect summary of a dataset, and as\n\nsuch, models have intrinsic failure modes even\n\nwhen trained on an ideal dataset. It is generally\n\nunderstood that the feasibility of evasion is a\n\nproperty of all ML models, rather than a failure\n\nmode to which only a few are susceptible to. These\n\nintegrity violations may rarely be encountered\n\nduring nominal use of the ML model but can be\n\nreadily discovered by an adversary who is explicitly\n\noptimizing for the worst-case conditions necessary\n\nto cause them.\n\n\n###### ML model/data poisoning\n\nWe are seeing a trend shift in adversarial ML\n\nsecurity research. While in past years there was a\n\nfocus on highly visible model evasion attacks where\n\nthe fragility of some ML models could be easily\n\ndemonstrated, the focus of security researchers\n\nis broadening to include less noticeable attacks.\n\nFor example, in data poisoning attacks, the target\n\nis the training data that the ML models are built\n\nfrom. As new data is aggregated and incorporated\n\ninto a dataset for training, it becomes increasingly\n\nimportant to validate that new training data has not\n\nbeen compromised. We have evidence of customer\n\nML model compromise resulting from adversarial\n\ncontamination of training data which, when left\n\nundetected, becomes an equally trusted part of\n\nexisting training datasets. Without automation\n\nmeasuring for statistical drift in growing datasets,\n\nthese types of attacks largely go undetected until an\n\nML model has a critical failure.\n\n\nAs we’ve seen with security research into past\n\nvulnerabilities,[ Note 27 ] a pronounced uptick in research\n\npublications is soon followed by active exploitation.\n\nIn anticipation of such a shift to focus on data\n\npoisoning attacks, Microsoft continues to focus\n\non designing threat detections and mitigations\n\nto protect ML models and their datasets against\n\nthese threats. Mitigations in this space can also be\n\nbeneficial to detecting non-malicious training data\n\ndrift, giving data scientists greater insight into the\n\nquality of their data over time and highlighting\n\nanomalies for investigation.\n\n\n###### The risk of adversaries evading an ML model exists in every domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What we’re doing to stay ahead of the curve\n\nPerforming security assessments of production\n\nAI systems is not easy. Microsoft surveyed 28\n\norganizations,[ Note 28 ] spanning Fortune 500 companies,\n\ngovernments, non-profits, and small and medium\nsized businesses, to understand the current\n\nprocesses in place to secure AI systems. We found\n\nthat 25 out of 28 businesses indicated they don’t\n\nhave the right tools in place to secure their AI\n\nsystems and that security professionals are looking\n\nfor specific guidance in this space.\n\nTo address the growing needs of adversarial ML,\n\nMicrosoft released Counterfit, an open-source\n\ntool to help assess risk by allowing users to attack\n\ntheir own AI/ML. This tool was developed out of\n\nour own need to assess Microsoft’s AI systems for\n\nvulnerabilities and proactively secure AI services,\n\nin accordance with our responsible AI principles[ Note 29 ]\n\nand Responsible AI Strategy in Engineering (RAISE)\n\ninitiative. Counterfit started as a corpus of attack\n\nscripts written specifically to target individual AI\n\nmodels and then grew into a generic automation\n\ntool to attack multiple AI systems at scale. Today, we\n\nroutinely use Counterfit as part of our AI red team\n\noperations.\n\n\nBased on learnings from internal and external\n\nengagements, Counterfit is designed to be flexible in\n\nthree key ways:\n\n**1. Environment agnostic: It can help assess AI**\n\nmodels hosted in any cloud environment, on\npremises, or on the edge.\n\n**2. Model agnostic: The tool abstracts the**\n\ninternal workings of AI models so that security\n\nprofessionals can focus on security assessment.\n\n**3. Strives to be data agnostic: It works on AI**\n\nmodels using text, images, or tabular input,\n\nand we continue to add data types.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Our approach to responsible AI at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5)_\n\n_[GitHub – Azure/counterfit: a CLI that provides a](https://github.com/Azure/counterfit)_\n\n_[generic automation layer for assessing the security of](https://github.com/Azure/counterfit)_\n\n_[ML models](https://github.com/Azure/counterfit)_\n\n_[AI security risk assessment using Counterfit Microsoft |](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/03/ai-security-risk-assessment-using-counterfit/)_\n\n_[Security Blog (5/3/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/03/ai-security-risk-assessment-using-counterfit/)_\n\n_[Adversarial Machine Learning – Industry Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05646.pdf)_\n\n_(3/19/2021)_\n\n\n###### AI risk management\n\n Security is one part of a larger emphasis in a burgeoning market called “AI risk management” and includes “model operations”— ensuring that your AI system is reliable, accurate and available. It also includes “responsible AI” with fairness, ethics, transparency and all the legal ramifications of having AI systems behave responsibly. This “security” element also deserves attention and is an important piece in rounding out a risk management posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Standards for addressing security of AI systems  \n\nThe prevalent use of AI and ML across industry\n\nsectors, an emerging regulatory landscape, and\n\nwidespread mistrust or misunderstanding in the use\n\nof these technologies has led to an increased need\n\nfor standards to define good practice and provide\n\nguidance to improve trust and market adoption.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization\n\n(ISO) and the International Electrotechnical\n\nCommission (IEC) are developing AI standards,\n\nincluding defining key terminology and concepts\n\nfor AI and ML, risk management, governance\n\nimplications, data quality, and various topics related\n\nto trustworthiness. Also under development is a\n\ncertifiable management system standard for AI,\n\nwhich will guide organizations to adopt a risk-based\n\napproach to responsibly use and develop AI systems\n\nas well as to demonstrate accountability and their\n\nduty of care toward stakeholders.\n\n\nAI and ML are increasingly integrated into all\n\ntypes of systems, including critical and safety\n\ninfrastructure, resulting in new security threats\n\nunique to the use of AI systems and highly\n\nundesirable consequences of attacks. Such\n\nconsequences can include the detrimental\n\nperformance of a chatbot, denial of essential\n\nservices, theft of intellectual property, or even\n\nphysical danger to humans. In some instances,\n\nsecurity attacks on AI systems have already caused\n\nsignificant issues.\n\n\nAI security cannot be considered in isolation of\n\nexisting risk-based security, privacy, and governance\n\nfoundations, which can address many of the\n\nthreats that arise using AI systems. For example,\n\nusing standards such as those for an information\n\nsecurity management system (ISO/IEC 27001) and\n\na privacy information management system (ISO/\n\nIEC 27701) can help an organization to implement\n\nprocesses and controls to address security and\n\nprivacy risks associated with its objectives and\n\nactivities, including security threats to AI systems.\n\nIn addition to these existing practices, this evolved\n\nthreat landscape will require new guidance, good\n\npractices, and organizational and technical measures\n\nto help organizations protect their AI systems.\n\nEffective security measures are a vital component\n\nof responsible development and deployment of AI\n\nsystems. Microsoft is engaged in new standards\n\nwork that has been initiated to provide guidance for\n\naddressing security threats and failures in AI and ML.\n\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Responsible AI principles from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1:primaryr6)_\n\n_[Threat Modeling AI/ML Systems and Dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/threat-modeling-aiml)_\n\n_[– Security documentation Microsoft Docs, |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/threat-modeling-aiml)_\n\n_(11/11/2019)_\n\n_[AI/ML Pivots to the Security Development Lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/bug-bar-aiml)_\n\n_[Bug Bar – Security documentation Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/bug-bar-aiml)_\n\n_(11/11/2019)_\n\n_[Failure Modes in Machine Learning – Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning)_\n\n_[documentation Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning)_ _(11/11/2019)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHAPTER 3\n\n## Nation state threats\n\n###### Introduction\n\n Tracking nation state threats\n\n What we're seeing\n\n Analysis of nation state activity this year\n\n Private sector offensive actors\n\n Comprehensive protections required\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCTION:\n##### Attackers increase use of deception to pursue national objectives\n\n###### JOHN LAMBERT, DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER AND VICE PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT THREAT INTELLIGENCE CENTER\n\n The last year has been marked by significant historic geopolitical events and unforeseen challenges that have changed the way organizations approach daily operations. During this time, nation state actors have largely maintained their operations at a consistent pace while creating new tactics and techniques to evade detection and increase the scale of their attacks. \n\n\nMajor cybersecurity events, like the SolarWinds\n\nattacks by NOBELIUM and on-premises Exchange\n\nServer attacks by HAFNIUM, and attacks by multiple\n\nother actors have focused our collective attention on\n\nsecuring our supply chains. Nation state actors and\n\nmany cybercrime operations have focused efforts on\n\nexposing security vulnerabilities among their suppliers\n\nor discovering unpatched systems that organizations\n\nrelied on for continuity of business during this unusual\n\nyear. These recent events have demonstrated the\n\nincreasing importance in maintaining current security\n\nupdates in all deployed systems as the most effective\n\nway to protect against rapidly evolving threats.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center\n\n(MSTIC) and the Digital Security Unit (DSU) have\n\nobserved that most nation state actors continue\n\nto focus operations and attacks on government\n\nagencies, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs),\n\n\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and think\n\ntanks for traditional espionage or surveillance\n\nobjectives. The victims of attacks often have\n\ninformation relevant to an adversary government’s\n\nintelligence needs, which is why so many government\n\nagencies and think tanks are attacked. However, private\n\nindustry’s role in supporting remote workers, increased\n\nhealthcare services, COVID-19 vaccine research, and\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine distribution have also made them\n\nmore common targets for these sophisticated actors\n\nseeking information for their government’s national\n\nsecurity or intelligence purposes. Our increased\n\nreliance on the global telecommunications backbone\n\nand virtual private network (VPN)/virtual private server\n\n(VPS) infrastructure for remote workers gave malicious\n\nactors new vectors to gain access to targeted private\n\nnetworks that were scrambling to support new ways of\n\ndoing business.\n\n\nThese sophisticated attackers continue to focus\n\non effective techniques that help them maintain\n\nstealth and access. We have seen continuing attacks\n\non traditional security hygiene elements as well as\n\nfocus on developing and refining new, breakthrough\n\nattacks targeting the supplier ecosystem in order\n\nto attack downstream customers. Well-established\n\nspear phishing and password spray campaigns\n\nby nation state actors continue to be successful\n\nagainst organizations that have not yet implemented\n\nmultifactor authentication (MFA) or other protections\n\nagainst this common tactic. However, as more\n\norganizations invest in securing their accounts, the\n\nsuccess rate of these techniques will decline, and\n\ndetection of the attacks will increase. In response,\n\nnation state actors appear to be increasing the scale\n\nand volume of these attacks to evade detection\n\nand improve the likelihood of success across\n\nmultiple targets. This volume-oriented approach to\n\n\n###### NATION\n\n STATE ACTORS\n\n APPEAR TO BE\n\n INCREASING\n\n THE SCALE\n\n AND VOLUME\n\n OF ATTACKS\n\n TO EVADE\n\n DETECTION.\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromising credentials will continue to be a\n\nuseful technique if poorly secured accounts are\n\navailable as targets. Attacks against unpatched\n\nthird-party software or on-premises infrastructure\n\nwill likely become more pervasive and become more\n\neasily exploited by nation state and cybercrime\n\nactors. Postponing installation of security updates\n\nor incomplete knowledge of deployed systems and\n\ntheir patch state will leave organizations vulnerable\n\nto sudden large-scale attacks as they scramble\n\nto identify affected assets and catch up to a fully\n\npatched state. Running networks with unsupported\n\nsoftware, or software that is no longer updated,\n\nincreases risk exponentially. Organizations must\n\nmaintain comprehensive asset inventory, patch state\n\nawareness, and thorough backup and containment\n\nplans to be resilient against sophisticated attacks.\n\nAdversaries will continue to evolve new techniques\n\nto target and compromise corporate resources\n\nrequiring a comprehensive “assume breach”\n\nmentality that extends beyond basic hygiene needs\n\nand MFA and into a holistic set of Zero Trust security\n\nprinciples. Applying a Zero Trust security model[ Note 32 ] will\n\nbecome increasingly critical in protecting corporate\n\nidentities, devices, applications, data, networks, and\n\ninfrastructure against sophisticated threats.\n\nLooking forward, we know that adversarial\n\ngovernments will continue with their intelligence\n\ncollection objectives, as well as explore the political\n\nboundaries of acceptable behavior in cyberspace. As\n\na result, we expect nation state actors to continue\n\n\nrefining their techniques by leveraging new exploits\n\nagainst security weaknesses and unpatched systems\n\nof common supply chain vendors in order to gain\n\naccess to and collect information from downstream\n\ncustomers. Spear phishing and password spray\n\nattacks show no sign of slowing as the common\n\nmethod for reconnaissance and infiltration,\n\nincreasing the importance of implementing end-to\nend MFA across accounts. The information Microsoft\n\nprovides in this chapter captures much of the activity\n\nwe have seen targeting our customers globally in\n\nthe past year and captures the trends we anticipate\n\nnation state actors will continue to use in the next\n\nyear. We recommend you use this information as a\n\nguide to understanding the tactics and techniques\n\nthat these sophisticated actors may use to target\n\nyour organizations so you can more effectively\n\nimplement proactive defense.\n\n##### Tracking nation state threats\n\nMicrosoft tracks nation state activities to protect\n\nour customers and our platforms and services.\n\nWe use a variety of metrics and sophisticated\n\ndata integration techniques to better understand\n\ntargeting, motivations, and customer impact. MSTIC\n\nfocuses on nation state actor activities because\n\nthese tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\n\noften have significant impact on our customers and\n\n\nare often unique, prompting deeper analysis and\n\ncreation of customized detections. Understanding\n\nthese TTPs also helps Microsoft better understand\n\ndownstream actors such as cybercriminals and\n\nsmaller nation states who often copy or reuse these\n\nmethods. DSU focuses on the victims identified\n\nby MSTIC, connecting the victims of the attack to\n\npolitical objectives and stated intelligence goals\n\nof governments to help Microsoft provide fuller\n\ncontext to the world about why these nation state\n\nattacks occur.\n\nWe focus on nation state activities regardless of\n\nplatform, targeted victim, or geographical region,\n\nand we maintain visibility and active threat hunting\n\nworldwide to write better detections for our\n\ncustomers. We also analyze why nation state actors\n\nare pursuing particular victims, sectors, or regions.\n\nPutting it all together, the information presented\n\nhere provides a snapshot of our defensive efforts\n\non behalf of our affected customers. It is important\n\nto note that even if a particular industry sector\n\nor geographic region is not represented in the\n\nfollowing information, nation state activity spans\n\nnearly every industry sector and geographic region.\n\nIn other words, protections against these tactics are\n\ncritical for every organization and individual. Our\n\nintelligence is impacted by the degree to which our\n\nproducts and platforms are utilized in a particular\n\ngeography or sector.\n\n\n###### Nation state notifications\n\nWhen a customer, whether it’s an organization\n\nor individual account holder, is targeted or\n\ncompromised by nation state activities that\n\nMicrosoft tracks, we deliver a nation state\n\nnotification (NSN) to the customer. Over the past\n\nthree years, Microsoft has delivered over 20,500\n\nNSNs. The charts and graphs in this chapter are\n\nderived from Microsoft’s NSN process.\n\n###### Countering nation state activity\n\nNation state actors are generally well-resourced\n\nand capable adversaries. As noted above, they are\n\noften pursuing intelligence collection against targets\n\nof interest to their governments. Our relentless\n\npursuit of these adversaries and our continuous\n\ndevelopment of new capabilities to detect and deter\n\nmalicious activity supports our commitment to\n\ncustomer protection. We are constantly improving\n\nour capability to understand nation state actors\n\nand their victims to help bring better context and\n\nunderstanding to our customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Our approach\n\nMicrosoft uses a five-pronged approach to disrupt\n\nnation state actors—providing direct customer\n\nnotifications, leveraging technology to detect and\n\ndefend, taking technical action against malicious\n\noperations, pursuing legal action, and participating\n\nin public policy discourse—and each one plays an\n\nimportant role in our commitment to protecting our\n\ncustomers and the ecosystem at large.\n\n**_1. Empowering customers_**\n\nMicrosoft leverages its NSN process to inform\n\ncustomers of targeting or compromise from\n\nnation state actors we track, providing actionable\n\ninformation for customers to rapidly respond and\n\nprotect themselves. Microsoft also provides alerts\n\nto industry sectors and customer segments to help\n\nraise awareness of malicious activity and guidance\n\non how to respond.\n\n\n**_2. Leveraging technology_**\n\nMicrosoft’s cumulative knowledge of the global\n\nthreat landscape enables our products and services\n\nto constantly create and update new security\n\nproduct detections, helping to protect and defend\n\nagainst nation state activities at scale. These\n\ncollective defenses represent the most effective\n\nmethod to counter nation state threats, as they\n\nare informed by the extensive threat intelligence\n\nresources built into each product and enabled by\n\nworld-class engineering.\n\n**_3. Taking technical action against malicious_**\n\n**_operations_**\n\nFrom time to time, Microsoft will have sufficient\n\ninformation to warrant a one-time deletion or\n\nshutdown of infrastructure or assets associated with\n\na nation state attacker. By taking proactive action\n\nagainst malicious infrastructure, the actor loses\n\nvisibility, capability, and access across a range of\n\nassets previously under their control, forcing them\n\nto rebuild.\n\n\n**_4. Digital Crimes Unit_**\n\nOne of Microsoft’s unique resources in the fight\n\nagainst nation state actors is the Digital Crimes\n\nUnit (DCU). Using litigation to seize domains and\n\nassets used by nation state actors against Microsoft\n\ncustomers, the DCU has been instrumental in\n\nshutting down those attack vectors. These cases\n\nhave led to the takedown of hundreds of domains\n\nand the protection of thousands of customers, and\n\nMicrosoft remains one of the only companies willing\n\nto pursue legal action against nation state actors\n\nin order to seize infrastructure and disrupt attacks.\n\nLessons learned from the cases are shared with\n\nMicrosoft engineering teams to help improve our\n\noperational and technical disruption capabilities.\n\n**_5. Informing public discourse and policy_**\n\nMicrosoft uses its voice to raise awareness about\n\nnation state activities, highlighting the context and\n\nimpacts of the incidents and sharing context about\n\nattacks and why they matter to the world. This helps\n\ndrive a broad discussion about what can be done\n\nto combat malicious nation state activities across\n\ngovernment entities, NGOs, enterprises, academia,\n\nand the public. Talking publicly about nation state\n\nattacks is an important part of deterrence.\n\n\n###### Guide to the nation state actors discussed in this report\n\nThroughout this chapter, we cite examples of nation\n\nstate actors to provide a deeper view into attack\n\ntargets, techniques, and analysis of motivations.\n\nMicrosoft identifies nation state activities by\n\nchemical element names, just some of which are\n\nshown in the following table together with the\n\ncountries of origin from which the actors operate.\n\nThis small sample of the total nation state actors\n\ntracked by Microsoft represents those that were\n\nmost active in the last year and made most effective\n\nuse of the tactics detailed in this chapter.\n\nMicrosoft also tracks and investigates many\n\nmalicious activities that are either new or unknown\n\nin origin to develop a full understanding of the\n\ntactics, techniques, and objectives.\n\n\n###### When we take proactive action against malicious infrastructure, the actor loses visibility, capability, and access across a range of assets previously under their control, forcing them to rebuild.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Sample of nation state actors and their activities\n\n\n-----\n\n##### What we're seeing\n\n###### Nation state targets\n\nIn the 2020 Microsoft Digital Defense Report,\n\nwe identified common aims (espionage,\n\ndisruption/destruction) and common techniques\n\n(reconnaissance, credential harvesting, malware,\n\nand virtual private network (VPN) exploits) prevalent\n\namong major nation state cyber actors. These\n\naims and techniques were as prevalent this year\n\nas the year before. Tried-and-true methods such\n\nas large-scale spear-phishing campaigns were\n\nstill valuable tools in the kits of hackers. However,\n\nattackers worldwide, either affiliated directly with\n\ngovernments or with more loose connections, are\n\ncontinuing to perform research against targets in\n\norder to be more convincing in an attack, develop\n\nnew techniques that have not been seen before,\n\nor even mimic criminal behavior in an attempt to\n\nobfuscate intent and objective. Microsoft responds\n\nby also working to improve our ability to keep up\n\nwith the changes.\n\n**Espionage more prevalent than destructive**\n\n**attacks**\n\nThe two main goals of nation state actors have not\n\nchanged either. In the last year, espionage, and\n\nmore specifically, intelligence collection, has been\n\na far more common goal than destructive attacks.\n\n\nIran has been the only nation state actor willing\n\nto regularly engage in destructive attacks, mostly\n\nagainst Israel. These cyberattacks happened within\n\na political environment in which both countries\n\nwere trading blows just short of military strikes,\n\nincluding attacks on one another’s cargo ships.\n\nWith tensions already so high, the decision to use\n\ncyber for destructive attacks was less of a strategic\n\nleap for Iran than it would have been for North\n\nKorea, Russia, or China. While nations other than\n\nIran mostly refrained from destructive attacks, they\n\ndid continue to compromise victims that would be\n\nprime candidates for destructive attacks if tensions\n\nincreased to the point where governments made\n\nstrategic decisions to escalate cyber warfare.\n\nThe “Most targeted sectors” chart in this chapter\n\nsection shows that nearly 80% of those targeted\n\nwere either in government, NGOs, or think tanks.\n\nThink tanks often serve as policy incubators and\n\nimplementers, with strong ties to current and former\n\ngovernment officials and programs. Threat actors\n\ncan and do exploit the connections between the\n\nmore traditional NGO community and government\n\norganizations to position themselves to gain insights\n\ninto national policy plans and intentions. As noted,\n\nit’s the think tanks with ideas relevant to current or\n\nfuture government policy or political objectives that\n\nput these organizations into the line of sight for\n\nintelligence operations. When traditional NGOs have\n\nsimilar information, we also see them as an objective\n\nfor nation state actors.\n\n\nNation state actors from North Korea added a\n\nthird motive to their cyberattacks: monetary gain.\n\nNorth Korea targets companies in cryptocurrency\n\ntrade or related research, likely seeking either to\n\nsteal cryptocurrency or intellectual property. North\n\nKorea’s economy is never strong, but the COVID-19\n\npandemic coming after years of UN sanctions has\n\npushed it to its worst state in a generation, forcing\n\nNorth Korea to seek to find money by any means\n\nnecessary. Although Iranian nation state actors\n\nfrequently used ransomware attacks, Microsoft\n\nassesses that the ransomware was used more for\n\ncovering the tracks of the attackers than for profit.\n\n**Targeting of IT companies is the big story of last**\n\n**year**\n\nA more revolutionary change, one common among\n\nall of the Big Four nation state cyber programs, has\n\nbeen the decision to target IT service providers\n\nin order to more successfully exploit victims\n\ndownstream who receive services from those\n\nIT providers. The most glaring examples of the\n\nuse of this kind of strategy from the last year are\n\nthe Russian SolarWinds attacks and the Chinese\n\nexploitation of a vulnerability in on-premises\n\nMicrosoft Exchange servers. These attacks are both\n\ncovered in detail in the sections on Russia and\n\nChina.\n\n\nAlthough SolarWinds and the Exchange vulnerability\n\nwere the two main cybersecurity stories of the\n\nyear, Iran and North Korea also used similar tactics\n\nof targeting IT providers to find creative ways to\n\nexploit their real targets. For example, North Korean\n\nactor ZINC created online personas of apparent\n\ncybersecurity experts, including websites and social\n\nmedia pages, and used these personas to approach\n\nexperts in cybersecurity vulnerabilities in an attempt\n\nto get the researchers they corresponded with to\n\nopen content that would have downloaded exploits\n\nonto their machines. While this was not a direct\n\nattack on an IT company like SolarWinds, it did\n\nrepresent an attempt to indirectly find avenues to\n\ncompromise North Korea’s actual targets by going\n\nthrough the experts responsible for finding ways to\n\nprotect them.\n\nFor more information on supply chain security, see\n\nthe Supply chain, IoT, and OT security chapter of this\n\nreport.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Most targeted countries (July 2020-June 2021)\n\nOrganizations in the United States remained the target of most of the\n\nobserved activity this year. We also noted targeting increases consistent\n\nwith increasing geopolitical tensions between nations. Russia-based\n\nNOBELIUM raised the number of Ukrainian customers impacted from\n\nsix last fiscal year to more than 1,200 this year by heavily targeting\n\nUkrainian government interests involved in rallying support against a\n\nbuild-up of Russian troops along Ukraine’s border. This year marked\n\na near quadrupling in targeting of Israeli entities, a result exclusively\n\nof Iranian actors, who focused on Israel as tensions sharply escalated\n\nbetween the adversaries.\n\n\n###### Most targeted sectors (July 2020-June 2021)\n\nEvery threat actor we tracked this year targeted entities within the\n\ngovernment sector. NOBELIUM, NICKEL, THALLIUM, and PHOSPHORUS\n\nwere the most active against this sector from the Big Four threat\n\ncountries. Government sector targeting largely focused on ministries\n\nof foreign affairs and other global government entities involved in\n\ninternational affairs. (This chart excludes consumer accounts and depicts\n\nonly enterprise targets’ corresponding sectors.)\n\n\n###### Consumer versus enterprise targets (July 2020-June 2021)\n\nIt is likely that threat actors thought consumer email accounts could\n\nbe an easier way to gain access to targeted networks during the\n\nglobal move to remote work. Separate from enterprise targets and the\n\nindustries they represented, consumer accounts received the second\n\nhighest number of notifications this year. THALLIUM and PHOSPHORUS\n\ninvested heavily in spear-phishing campaigns targeting these accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nof displaying Russia’s interest in conducting operation for access and\n\nintelligence collection versus targeting a critical infrastructure for\n\npotential disruption operations.\n\n\n**Critical infrastructure versus noncritical infrastructure targets**\n\nFrom July 2020 to June 2021, critical infrastructures were not the focal\n\npoint according to the NSN information that was tracked. China-based\n\n\nthreat actors displayed the most interest and Russia-based threat actors\n\naccounted for the least in targeting entities in the critical infrastructure\n\nsector. Russian NOBELIUM’s cyber operations are a perfect example\n\n\n###### Targeting critical versus noncritical infrastructures (PPD-21)(July 2020–June 2021)\n\n Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructures China’s targeting of critical infrastructures Iran’s targeting of critical infrastructures\n\n North Korea’s targeting of critical infrastructures Combination of China, Iran, North Korea,  and Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructures\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compromised versus targeted success rate**\n\nSuccess rates varied widely from threat group to threat group. Some\n\ngroups, like North Korean THALLIUM, had a low success rate, because\n\nthey used strategies like large-scale spear-phishing campaigns that\n\nrely more on using a wide net than a surgical strike. Password sprays\n\nare another example of a tactic with a low success rate, but where the\n\nattackers understand the success rate will be low. Other groups use very\n\nfocused attacks that succeed much more often. HAFNIUM, for example,\n\nsucceeded in 43% of its attacks. NICKEL succeeded at an astonishing\n\nrate of over 90%. The figures below represent an average of different\n\ntactics that are designed to succeed at different rates. The first quarter\n\nwas extremely high, not necessarily because actors were more successful\n\nthat quarter, but because Microsoft noted less activity stemming from\n\nlow-success-rate attacks.\n\n###### Compromise rate (July 2020-June 2021)\n\n\n###### Activity origins\n\nThe following section depicts the frequency of attacks by country of\n\norigin, measured in the number of NSNs generated from attacks by\n\neach actor. Russia-based threat activity dominated this year, driven\n\nby NOBELIUM’s large-scale targeting. North Korea–based actors also\n\nemployed a strategy of ubiquitous targeting that earned North Korea\n\nthe second highest percentage of notifications.\n\n**Country of activity origin**\n\nNOBELIUM, and its aggressive targeting of IT service providers and\n\nWestern government institutions, catapulted Russia to the top spot for\n\ncountries where attacks originated this year. That group was responsible\n\nfor 92% of the notifications to customers about Russia-based threat\n\nactivity. The outsized proportion of attacks coming from North Korea is\n\na result of the strategy taken by threat actors THALLIUM and CERIUM.\n\nThese groups rely on large quantities of attacks. While these attacks\n\nhave a low percentage of success, because of the high number of\n\nattempts, the groups still manage to successfully infect some victims.\n\n###### Attacks by country of origin (July 2020-June 2021)\n\n\n**Most active nation state activity groups**\n\nLike the “compromised versus targeted” section above, the data in this\n\nsection is heavily affected by the tactics chosen by the attackers. If one\n\ngroup attempts a password spray attack on a hundred targets and\n\nsuccessfully compromises one, while another group surgically focuses\n\non only one victim that it compromises, they have both had the same\n\nnumber of successes. However, the first group will appear as the more\n\n“active” group, because it has attacked a hundred targets. The top three\n\ngroups in this list all make use of high-fail-rate tactics. NOBELIUM, in\n\naddition to high-success-rate-focused attacks, also makes frequent use\n\nof low-success password sprays, while THALLIUM and PHOSPHORUS\n\nsend spear-phishing emails to large groups. This chart, then, does not\n\nnecessarily equate to the most dangerous groups, although it does say\n\nsomething about their relative levels of persistence and ubiquity.\n\n###### Most active nation state activity groups (July 2020-June 2021)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attack vectors used by nation state malicious actors\n\n Nation states are advanced enough to do reconnaissance on their victims and select the attack method that best suits each goal or intended outcome.\n\n\n**Nation state attacker tools**\n\nThe tools used by nation states to compromise\n\nvictim networks are most frequently the same\n\ntools used by other malicious actors. To achieve\n\ntheir objectives, nation state actors may create\n\nor leverage bespoke malware, construct novel\n\npassword spray infrastructure, or craft unique\n\nphishing or social engineering campaigns. However,\n\nactors like GADOLINIUM are also increasingly\n\nturning to use open-source tools[ Note 33 ] or common\n\nmalware to impact a supply chain, attempt a man\nin-the-middle attack, or launch a denial-of-service\n\nattack. These methods allow malicious actors to\n\nobfuscate their actions by hiding in plain sight.\n\nIncreased use of open-source tools provides some\n\nadvantages for security professionals responsible\n\nfor detecting and defending against these attacks.\n\nIncreasingly, the same security and computer\n\nhygiene routines that protect from ordinary threats\n\nalso help protect from nation states. Training\n\nemployees to be skeptical can go a long way to\n\nstopping spear-phishing attacks and thwarting the\n\ncommon methods that Microsoft sees in the early\n\nstages of a compromise.\n\n\nIt is often the case that nation state actors develop\n\nand refine new attack techniques and that criminals\n\nadopt and further refine them over time. Microsoft\n\nexpects tools designed to target and compromise IT\n\nsupply chains to enter the mainstream and become\n\nmore common, making concepts like Zero Trust\n\narchitecture a priority from software development\n\nthrough deployment and updating. Well-funded\n\nnation state actors will continue to create unique\n\ntools to achieve their objectives, but just like any\n\nother streamlined organization, are just as likely\n\nto use common tools where they can to improve\n\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Protecting customers from a private-sector offensive](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/)_\n\n_[actor using 0-day exploits and DevilsTongue malware](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/)_\n\n_[| Microsoft Security Blog (7/15/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Analysis of nation state activity  this year \n\nEvolving nation state cybersecurity threats have\n\nproduced a watershed year with an increased\n\nfocus on on-premises servers and the exposure of\n\nwidespread supply chain vulnerabilities, most acutely\n\n\nin software. The scope, sophistication, and success\n\nof HAFNIUM’s 0-day exploits for on-premises\n\nExchange servers in early 2021 and NOBELIUM’s\n\ncompromise of SolarWinds’ network management\n\nsoftware in late 2020 caught the world’s attention,\n\nalthough the nation state threat extended beyond\n\nthose immediate incidents. For one, Russia-based\n\nNOBELIUM and China-based HAFNIUM’s targeting\n\nof on-premises resources and dumping credentials\n\nin those operations would have allowed them the\n\nopportunity to seize credentials to access and pivot\n\nto cloud-based resources. Russia-linked STRONTIUM\n\n\nalso developed target-specific capabilities for\n\non-premises infrastructure of foreign and defense\nrelated entities in Europe, marking a shift from the\n\npredominant cloud-first, cloud-only operations the\n\ngroup was known for in 2019 and 2020. Multiple\n\nIranian actors also likely conducted supply chain\n\noperations, including one in early 2020 that likely\n\nsought intelligence from government agencies\n\nindirectly through IT and engineering services\n\ncompanies that support US defense and intelligence\n\nagencies.\n\n###### Russia\n\n\n###### Russia\n\nOver the past year, Russia-based activity groups have\n\nsolidified their position as acute threats to the global\n\ndigital ecosystem by demonstrating adaptability,\n\npersistence, a willingness to exploit trusted technical\n\nrelationships, and a facility with anonymization and\n\nopen-source tools that make them increasingly\n\ndifficult to detect and attribute. They have also\n\nshown a high tolerance for collateral damage, which\n\nleaves anyone with connections to targets of interest\n\nvulnerable to opportunistic targeting.\n\n\n**Activity**\n**Group Name**\n\n\n**Other**\n**names**\n\n\n**Country**\n**of origin**\n\n\n**Industries**\n**targeted**\n\n\n**STRONTIUM** APT28, Fancy Bear Russia Government, diplomatic and defense entities, think tanks, NGOs, higher\neducation, defense contractors, IT software and services\n\n**NOBELIUM** UNC2452 Russia Government, diplomatic and defense entities, IT software and services,\ntelecommunication, think tanks, NGOs, defense contractors\n\n**BROMINE** Energetic Bear Russia Government, energy, civil aviation, defense industrial base\n\n\n###### Russia\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NOBELIUM targets by industries/verticals (December 2020-Jan 2021)\n\n NOBELIUM targets by industries/verticals (January-June 2021)\n\n NOBELIUM: Variable target picture reflects diversity of tactics.\n\n\nIn summer and fall 2020, STRONTIUM deployed an\n\nautomated password spray/brute forcing tool that\n\nran through more than a thousand anonymized Tor\n\nIPs,[ Note 38 ] making it large scale and hard to detect and\n\nattribute. The tool was deployed multiple times\n\nagainst more than 40 political organizations and\n\nadvocacy groups based in the United States and the\n\nUK in the run-up to, and immediately after, the US\n\npresidential election.\n\n**Achieving higher rates of compromise and**\n\n**targeting more government organizations**\n\nOver the past year, Russia-based groups have\n\nimproved their rates of successful compromise and\n\nincreasingly set their sights on government targets, a\n\nconfluence of trends that could portend more high\nimpact compromises in the year ahead. Year-on-year\n\ncomparisons of NSN data depict a marked increase\n\nin successful compromises, from 21% successful\n\nbetween July 2019 and June 2020 to 32% since July\n\n2020. The percentage of government organizations\n\namong Russian targets exploded from roughly 3%\n\nlast period to 53% since July 2020.\n\nRussian threat actors will follow targets wherever\n\nthey are, be it in the cloud or on-premises. This past\n\nyear, STRONTIUM pivoted to more on-premises\n\ntargeting, developing target-specific capabilities\n\nagainst on-premises infrastructure of foreign policy\n\nand defense-related entities in Europe. This strategy\n\nwas a change from the predominant cloud-first,\n\n\n**Abusing supply chain and other trusted technical**\n\n**relationships**\n\nRussia-based NOBELIUM proved how insidious\n\nand devastating software supply chain attacks can\n\nbe with its compromise of the SolarWinds Orion\n\nsoftware update. Although the group limited follow\non exploitation to roughly 100 organizations, its\n\nmalicious backdoor malware was pushed to roughly\n\n18,000 entities worldwide, leaving those impacted\n\ncustomers vulnerable to further attack.\n\nNOBELIUM’s operational techniques were much\n\nmore diverse than just the malicious backdoor\n\nand ranged from password spray and phishing to\n\ncompromise of third-party providers to facilitate\n\nfuture attacks. The actor targeted cloud solution\n\nproviders (CSPs) and leveraged the backdoor to steal\n\na Mimecast private key. NOBELIUM went on to target\n\ndownstream customers by masquerading as those\n\nCSPs and as the legitimate Mimecast app.[ Note 34 ] In May,\n\nthe group compromised a US government agency’s\n\naccount at a popular email marketing service,\n\ncloaking malicious components behind the service’s\n\nlegitimate URL to send a phishing email to more\n\nthan 150 diplomatic, international development, and\n\nnonprofit organizations mostly in the United States\n\nand across Europe.[ Note 35 ]\n\nComparing the distribution of NOBELIUM victims\n\nidentified in the first few months after discovery\n\n\nof the SolarWinds compromise and the targeting\n\npicture of NOBELIUM’s activity through June 2021\n\nhighlights the tactical shifts and multi-vectored\n\napproach the threat group employs to gain access to\n\ndesired systems. The first chart depicts victims that\n\nwere subject to high-touch threat actor exploitation\n\nthat in some cases leveraged the supply chain\n\nbackdoor access. The second chart reflects the mass\n\nspear-phishing and password spray campaigns the\n\nactor used against targeted organizations in the first\n\nhalf of 2021. We can see NOBELIUM consistently\n\ntargeted the government, NGO, IT services, and\n\nprofessional services sectors (included in “Other”\n\nin the latter chart), but the volume of compromise\n\nattempts fluctuated in line with the tactical changes.\n\n**Using a range of techniques to evade detection**\n\n**and attribution**\n\nRussian actors demonstrated varying degrees of\n\nadaptability and security consciousness that helped\n\nthem evade attribution and network defenses.\n\nNOBELIUM showed a deep knowledge of common\n\nsoftware tools, network security systems, and cloud\n\ntechnologies, as well as remediation methods\n\nincident response teams use, and they changed their\n\noperations accordingly to maintain persistence.[ Note 36 ]\n\nResponder surveillance was a tactic employed by\n\nanother Russian threat group, YTTRIUM, in the\n\npast.[ Note 37 ]\n\n\n-----\n\ncloud-only operations the group was known for\n\nthroughout 2019 and into 2020.\n\nFor the first time since August 2018, government\n\norganizations were the most targeted sector for\n\nRussian threat actors Microsoft tracks, followed by\n\nthink tanks. The government organizations were\n\nlargely involved in foreign policy and national\n\nsecurity or defense, although threat actor BROMINE\n\nconcentrated its efforts against US state, county,\n\nand city governments, as well as aviation and\n\n\nand UK—were on the “unfriendly countries” lists.\n\nMicrosoft’s observations of Russian threat activity\n\nthis past year suggest that intelligence collection\n\nwas a primary motivation, as we saw data exfiltration\n\nbut little evidence of disruptive or destructive activity\n\nfrom the groups we track. Gaining information on\n\nthe policy plans and intentions of those perceived\n\nas adversaries would be standard intelligence\n\nrequirements for the Russian government agencies\n\nto whom the US government attributes much of this\n\nactivity.[ Note 42 ]\n\n\nport authorities. The healthcare industry was the\n\nthird most targeted sector this period, fueled by\n\nSTRONTIUM’s credential harvesting attempts against\n\norganizations developing and testing COVID-19\n\nvaccines and treatments[ Note 40 ] in the United States,\n\nAustralia, Canada, Israel, India, and Japan through\n\nsummer 2020.\n\n**Seeking intelligence on the United States and**\n\n**Europe**\n\nRussian threat actors attempted to access accounts\n\n\nat organizations on almost every continent this\n\nperiod, but they predominantly focused on\n\norganizations based in the United States, followed\n\nby Ukraine, UK, and NATO allies and member states\n\nacross Europe. On May 14, the Russian government\n\nofficially named the United States and Czechia\n\n“unfriendly” countries, while Poland, Lithuania,\n\nLatvia, Estonia, UK, Canada, Ukraine, and Australia\n\nappeared on a preliminary list leaked in April.[ Note 41 ]\n\nThe top three countries most impacted by Russian\n\ncyber activity this past year—United States, Ukraine,\n\n\n###### What lessons might NOBELIUM have learned from the SolarWinds incident?\n\n 1. The US Government is still not sure where the red lines are for cyber operations.\n\n As a sign of the ongoing debate within US and European policy communities about whether\n\n and how to respond to the SolarWinds breach, in March a former senior adviser to Britain’s\n\n Government Communications Headquarters cautioned the Biden administration not to react\n\n too harshly to Russia’s “surgical” espionage campaign.[ Note 39 ] Russian threat actors have exploited\n\n this policy ambiguity for years and could continue to do so for years to come.\n\n 2. The private sector is critical to the defense of US government networks.\n\n Microsoft and FireEye were the public face of incident response during the SolarWinds\n\n attack. In the future, NOBELIUM and other groups could move early to handicap high\n profile cybersecurity teams, anticipating that doing so will slow the time to identification and\n\n remediation of intrusions against high-value targets.\n\n|Information accessed|Operational aim|\n|---|---|\n|• Sanctions policy • Defense/intelligence policy • Russia policy • COVID-19 information|Espionage to gain policy insights|\n|• Cyber incident response; threat hunting techniques • Assessments of Russian threat actors • Red Team tools • Detection signatures • Source code|Intelligence collection to improve countermeasures|\n|• CSP accounts • Software certificates • Source code|Intelligence collection to support operational planning|\n\n\n###### Examples of the types of information NOBELIUM operators may have acquired, based on the victim accounts they accessed, and the operational aims that likely drove the intrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### China\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft observed Chinese\n\nnation state threat actors target the US political\n\nlandscape for insight into policy shifts and target\n\ngovernment entities that enact foreign policies\n\nin Europe and Latin American countries likely for\n\nintelligence collection. To accomplish their mission,\n\nseveral China-based threat actors exploited a range\n\nof previously unidentified vulnerabilities for different\n\nservices and network components.\n\n\nThe following charts illustrate activity by China\nbased threat groups in July 2020–June 2021\n\nbased on NSNs issued to customers. These charts\n\nrepresent only a portion of the threat actors’\n\nactivities observed.\n\n**HAFNIUM and the Exchange vulnerabilities**\n\nIn early March 2021, Microsoft blogged about\n\nHAFNIUM for the first time related to the detection\n\nof multiple 0-day exploits being used to attack on\npremises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.[ Note 43 ]\n\n\nHAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state sponsored\n\nand operating out of China, based on observed\n\nvictimology, tactics, and procedures, primarily\n\ntargets entities in the United States across a number\n\nof industry sectors, including infectious disease\n\nresearchers, law firms, higher education institutions,\n\ndefense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs.\n\nHAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by\n\nexploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers\n\nand has used legitimate open-source frameworks,\n\nlike Covenant, for command and control. Once\n\n###### China\n\n\nthey’ve gained access to a victim network,\n\nHAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing\n\nsites like MEGA. In campaigns unrelated to these\n\nvulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM\n\ninteracting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they\n\nare often unsuccessful in compromising customer\n\naccounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the\n\nadversary identify more details about their targets’\n\nenvironments. HAFNIUM operates primarily from\n\nleased virtual private servers in the United States.\n\n\n**Activity**\n**Group Name**\n\n\n**Other**\n**names**\n\n\n**Industries**\n**targeted**\n\n\n**Country**\n**of origin**\n\n\n**MANGANESE** APT5, Keyhole Panda China Communications infrastructure, defense industrial base, software/technology\n\n**ZIRCONIUM** APT31 China Government agencies and services, diplomatic organizations, economic\norganizations\n\n**HAFNIUM** – – – China Higher education, defense industrial base, think tanks, NGOs, law firms,\nmedical research\n\n**NICKEL** APT15, Vixen Panda China Government agencies and services, diplomatic organizations\n\n**CHROMIUM** ControlX China Energy, communications infrastructure, education, government agencies and\nservices\n\n**GADOLINIUM** APT40 China Maritime, healthcare, higher education, regional government organizations\n\n\n###### China\n\n\n-----\n\n###### China: Top five targeted industries/sectors (July 2020-June 2021)\n\n The most prevalent targets of China-based threat activity were government entities worldwide. The targeting of three countries’ government entities accounted for half of the NSNs issued and 23 countries accounted for the remaining half.\n\n\n###### China: Target attempts vs successful compromise (July 2020-June 2021)\n\n Chinese nation state threat actors were successful in compromising victims 44% of the time. However, because they are an advance persistent threat, if they are tasked to target an entity for intelligence collection, they will find another vulnerability to leverage to gain access.\n\n\n###### HAFNIUM: Top targeted industries/verticals\n\n**(Prior to the increase in Exchange Server exploitation)**\n\n\nHAFNIUM used these vulnerabilities to access on\npremises Exchange servers, which enabled access to\n\nemail accounts and allowed installation of additional\n\nmalware to facilitate long-term access to victim\n\nenvironments. MSTIC attributes this campaign with\n\nhigh confidence to HAFNIUM. The vulnerabilities\n\nexploited were CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857,\n\nCVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065.\n\nThe attacks included three steps. First, HAFNIUM\n\nwould gain access to an Exchange Server either\n\nwith stolen passwords or by exploiting the\n\naforementioned vulnerabilities to gain initial\n\n\naccess. Second, they deployed web shells on the\n\ncompromised server. Web shells potentially allow\n\nattackers to steal data and perform additional\n\nmalicious actions that lead to further compromise.\n\nThird, they used that remote access, which was\n\ntypically run from the US-based private servers\n\nto exfiltrate data from an organization’s network.\n\nMicrosoft assesses HAFNIUM was associated with\n\nthe initial activity with the 0-day exploits; however,\n\nafter the vulnerability announcement, several nation\n\nstate actors and criminal groups maneuvered\n\nquickly to take advantage of the vulnerabilities for\n\ntheir own gain.\n\n|CVE|Description|\n|---|---|\n|CVE-2021-26855|Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange, which allowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.|\n|CVE-2021-26857|An insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service.|\n|CVE-2021-26858|A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange.|\n|CVE-2021-27065|A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange.|\n\n\n-----\n\nOn July 19, 2021, the US government with its allies\n\nand partners took a stance against the Chinese\n\ngovernment and issued a statement that China’s\n\nmalicious cyber operation poses a major threat\n\nto the United States and its allies’ economic and\n\nnational security.[ Note 44 ] Although slim on the technical\n\ndetails, the same statement attributed HAFNIUM\n\nwith a high level of confidence to cyber actors\n\naffiliated with China’s civilian intelligence agency, the\n\nMinistry of State Security. These actors compromised\n\ntens of thousands of computers and networks\n\nworldwide in a massive cyber espionage campaign\n\nthat mostly impacted private sector victims.\n\n**More 0-days and other exploitation of**\n\n**vulnerabilities**\n\nIn July, SolarWinds released a security advisory\n\nfor CVE-2021-35211, crediting Microsoft with the\n\nnotification.[ Note 45 ] Microsoft detected the 0-day remote\n\ncode execution exploit being used to exploit the\n\nSolarWinds Serv-U FTP software at entities in the\n\nUS Defense Industrial Base Sector and software\n\ncompanies. This activity is attributed to a group\n\noperating out of China, based on observed\n\nvictimology, tactics, and procedures.\n\n\nIn April 2021, FireEye released a blog and credited\n\nMSTIC for their contribution in identifying a Pulse\n\nSecure VPN 0-day exploit that was leveraged by\n\nChinese nation state threat actors.[ Note 46 ] Microsoft\n\nassociates some of the activity with MANGANESE\n\nand NICKEL. The Department of Homeland Security\n\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n\n(CISA) released an alert on the same 0-day activity\n\nindicating that it affected US government agencies,\n\ncritical infrastructure entities, and other private\n\nsector organizations likely beginning in June 2020.[ Note 47 ]\n\nCISA stated that after the successful exploitation,\n\nthe threat actor used their access to place web shells\n\non the Pulse Connect Secure appliance for further\n\naccess and persistence.\n\nIn addition to MANGANESE, MSTIC has observed\n\nZIRCONIUM and two other threat actors who\n\nexploited small office or home office routers\n\nworldwide. These threat actors are likely\n\ncompromising routers to use as infrastructure\n\nfor their computer network operations. These\n\ncompromised routers are likely in the same\n\ngeographical area as their intended target to\n\nobscure scrutiny against the associated activity.\n\n\n**A worldwide intelligence collection operation**\n\nAfter the September 2020 Microsoft blog on\n\nmultiple nation state threat actors targeting\n\ninformation on US elections, ZIRCONIUM did\n\nnot stop their collection operations.[ Note 48 ] As the US\n\npresidential election day approached, ZIRCONIUM\n\ncontinued to employ web-bugged emails, targeting\n\nindividuals with access to knowledge of potential\n\nshifts in US policy. On July 19, 2021, the United\n\nKingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre released\n\na statement that attributed APT31, which is roughly\n\ntracked as ZIRCONIUM by Microsoft, to the Ministry\n\nof State Security—China’s civilian intelligence\n\nagency.[ Note 49 ]\n\nChinese nation state cyber operations did not\n\noverlook their neighbors. Since July 2020, activity\n\ntied to CHROMIUM targeted entities in India,\n\nMalaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Thailand and\n\nthe sensitive social, economic, and political\n\nissues surrounding Hong Kong and Taiwan. From\n\nMicrosoft’s perspective, CHROMIUM activity was\n\nmost active against universities in Hong Kong\n\nand Taiwan, followed by government entities and\n\ntelecommunication providers in the other countries.\n\nIn addition to targeting neighboring countries,\n\nthere has been a steady drumbeat of intelligence\n\n\ncollection against Latin American countries and\n\nin Europe. Besides leveraging exploits for VPN\n\ndevices in their cyber operations, NICKEL’s activity\n\nalso targeted government foreign ministries\n\nthroughout Central and South American countries\n\nand some European countries. As China’s influence\n\ncontinues to shift in the region and with countries\n\nthat are partners in their Belt and Road Initiative,\n\nwe assess that Chinese threat actors will continue\n\nto target entities to gain insight into investments,\n\nnegotiations, and influence.\n\n\n_[Note 44 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-i](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Iran\n\nIran continued its streak of destructive cyberattacks\n\nagainst regional adversaries while taking a “wait\nand-see” approach with the United States amid the\n\nprospects for sanctions relief from nuclear talks after\n\nUS elections.\n\n\n**Focused on Israel with new attack tools amid**\n\n**broader escalation**\n\nAs a covert war between Iran and Israel escalated,\n\nIranian offensive cyber actors increased their\n\nattention to Israel and brought with them Iran’s\n\nnewest tool of choice—ransomware. Iran also\n\nconducted ransomware attacks against at least\n\none Gulf State adversary.[ Note 50 ] While it remains unclear\n\nwhether Iranian actors are using ransomware for\n\nfinancial gain, in at least one case they used it as a\n\ncover for a destructive attack by deploying wiper\n\nmalware on a company’s network while demanding\n\na ransom.[ Note 51 ]\n\n\n**A wait-and-see approach toward the United**\n\n**States likely serves two purposes**\n\nDespite Tehran’s less aggressive approach toward\n\nthe United States, relative to its regional adversaries,\n\nUS entities remained Iranian threat actors’ top target,\n\ncomprising nearly half of the NSNs we delivered to\n\ncloud-service customers. Iranian cyber operations\n\ntoward US targets consisted of a two-pronged\n\napproach: acquiring strategic intelligence likely to\n\ngain insights into US policy views and planning and\n\nacquiring a foothold on networks likely to provide\n\nTehran with contingency options in case the United\n\nStates failed to provide sufficient sanctions relief.\n\n\nMicrosoft detected an increased focus from a\n\ngrowing number of Iranian groups targeting Israeli\n\nentities since November, and with that focus came\n\na string of ransomware attacks. An Iran-linked\n\nthreat actor that we track as RUBIDIUM probably\n\nconducted the Pay2Key and N3tw0rm ransomware\n\ncampaigns that almost exclusively targeted Israel in\n\nlate 2020 and early 2021, respectively. One common\n\nelement of RUBIDIUM’s ransomware campaigns was\n\nits targeting of Israeli logistics companies involved in\n\nmaritime transportation.

They targeted fewer than 25 senior\n\npersonnel at medical research organizations, as\n\ndetailed by Proofpoint,[ Note 53 ] but the vast majority of the\n\n100-plus targets we detected were nuclear policy\n\nor conflict resolutions experts—in line with the\n\ntheme of the phishing emails—in the United States,\n\nUnited Kingdom, France, and Russia. PHOSPHORUS\n\nhoned its targeting on this community as nuclear\n\ntalks began in Vienna in April, including targeting\n\ndiplomat participants.\n\n\nPreviously in 2020, PHOSPHORUS masqueraded as\n\nconference organizers to high-profile international\n\nconferences, as we detailed in this blog.[ Note 54 ] At\n\nMicrosoft, we detected PHOSPHORUS sending\n\nspoofed email invitations with links to credential\n\nharvesting sites to more than 100 policy experts\n\nwho were prospective attendees, several of whom\n\nthey compromised. The group’s credential phishing\n\ncampaign likely sought to acquire intelligence to\n\nbetter position itself in international engagement.\n\nSince April 2021, select Iranian actors also targeted\n\nUS agriculture and media companies that are\n\nunlikely intelligence targets for Tehran.[ Note 55 ] These\n\nsame operators employed ransomware on other\n\ncompanies, suggesting a potential aim to gain a\n\nfoothold for contingency plans in case nuclear talks\n\nfail to meet Tehran’s expectations.\n\nIn some cases, the Iranian targeting of US entities\n\nthat we have detected could be focused on\n\nintelligence collection, contingency planning, or\n\nboth. Early this year, CURIUM conducted a spear\nphishing campaign targeting companies that provide\n\nIT and engineering services for US defense and\n\nintelligence agencies, probably as a part of a supply\n\nchain operation to gain access to their customers.\n\n\n###### Iran: Most targeted countries (July 2020–June 2021)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Flow of a typical PHOSPHORUS compromise from spear phish\n\n\n###### Conferences, conventions, and trade shows are widely known throughout industry and the US government as a hotbed of intelligence collection activities, both by domestic competitive intelligence and foreign adversaries. Individuals have been known to collect information thrown out in the trash, record presentations, attempt to steal products, and solicit sensitive information from employees. Though these events were widely paused due to pandemic restrictions, major conventions are coming back to calendars.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### North Korea\n\nIn the last year, North Korean threat actors have\n\nbeen extremely active relative to the country’s\n\nsize and resources, compared to the other major\n\nattacking states. For example, in the last three\n\nmonths of 2020, just over half the NSNs Microsoft\n\nissued were for North Korean state actors, in spite\n\nof North Korea being the smallest of the four most\n\nprolific nation state actors Microsoft tracks.\n\n\n**Feeding a vast appetite for intelligence**\n\nThe vast majority of the North Korean targeting\n\nMicrosoft noted was directed at consumer account\n\ntargets. For the most part, these targets were\n\nprobably selected based on the likelihood they could\n\nhelp North Korea obtain non-publicly available\n\ndiplomatic or geopolitical intelligence. North\n\nKorean groups THALLIUM and ZINC continued to\n\ncreate much of the targeting Microsoft observed,\n\nbut they were joined by other groups, such as\n\nOSMIUM and CERIUM. Together, these groups\n\nfocused on diplomatic officials, academics, and\n\nthink tank members from around the world. Most\n\n\nof those targeted were in three countries: South\n\nKorea, the United States, and Japan. However, North\n\nKorean actors also targeted academics and think\n\ntank officials in Europe and even China and Russia,\n\ncountries generally seen as friendly to North Korea.\n\nThe focus on diplomatic or geopolitical intelligence\n\nlikely was driven by Pyongyang’s anxiety for\n\ninformation in a volatile international situation.\n\nDiplomatic targeting was particularly heavy during\n\nand directly after the US election. North Korea’s\n\nstrong interest in intelligence collection probably\n\nhad several key questions it sought to answer: Will\n\n###### North Korea\n\n\nthe international community continue to strictly\n\nenforce sanctions on North Korea? How does\n\nCOVID-19 change international dynamics?

As MSTIC reported\n\nin concert with Google in January,[ Note 57 ] ZINC targeted\n\nsecurity researchers with a fairly sophisticated social\n\nengineering campaign. The campaign included\n\nspending months setting up fake profiles that\n\nlooked like real security companies and researchers,\n\nwith websites and social media platforms to support\n\nthese personas. This targeting sought long-term\n\neffects beyond the immediate attack. It also\n\nshowed that North Korea is more than capable of\n\nunderstanding the Western security landscape well\n\nenough to blend into it.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Vietnam\n\nVietnamese threat group BISMUTH utilized cryptocurrency miners to target private sector and government\n\ninstitutions in France and Vietnam. Because cryptocurrency miners tend to be seen as lower-priority threats by\n\nsecurity systems, BISMUTH was able to take advantage of the smaller alert profile caused by their malware to slip\n\ninto systems unnoticed.\n\n\nAs MSTIC reported in November 2020,[ Note 58 ] BISMUTH carefully planned attacks, conducting reconnaissance before\n\ncreating uniquely crafted spear-phishing emails for each individual. Sometimes, BISMUTH actors, similar to\n\nPHOSPHORUS operators, would correspond with targets to build rapport before sending the email containing\n\na malicious attachment. Once it compromised networks, BISMUTH sought to achieve continuous monitoring.

These private\n\ncompanies may not be nation state actors, but their\n\nbusiness model presents a dangerous and rapidly\n\ngrowing challenge for organizations, companies,\n\nand individual consumers. These tools also threaten\n\nmany global human rights efforts, as they have been\n\nobserved targeting and surveilling dissidents, human\n\nrights defenders, journalists, civil society advocates,\n\nand other private citizens.\n\nIn December 2020, Microsoft’s efforts to protect\n\nour customers from the threats presented by this\n\ntechnology led us to file an amicus brief in support\n\nof WhatsApp’s case against Israel-based NSO\n\nGroup Technologies (NSO Group) along with Cisco,\n\nGitHub, Google, LinkedIn, VMware, and Internet\n\nAssociation.[ Note 59 ] The brief encouraged the court to\n\nreject NSO Group’s position that it is not responsible\n\nfor the use of its surveillance and espionage\n\nproducts by governments. Microsoft also worked\n\nwith Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto’s Munk\n\nSchool, to disable malware being used by an Israel\n\nTherefore, defense-in-depth strategies against\n\nnation state adversaries should include educating\n\nemployees on how to avoid being targeted\n\nthemselves.

To\n\nlimit the damage of data exfiltration, information\n\nrights management can be applied to files. Building\n\nprotective controls across your managed identities,\n\ndevices, applications, data, infrastructure, and\n\nnetworks will raise the threshold for attackers,\n\nimproving your organization’s ability to detect\n\nanomalous activity in the environment.\n\n\nbased PSOA that Microsoft calls SOURGUM, and\n\nthat Citizen Lab identified as Candiru.[ Note 60 ] SOURGUM\n\ncreated malware and 0-day exploits (fixed in CVE\n2021-31979[ Note 61 ] and CVE-2021-33771[ Note 62]) as a part of a\n\nhacking-as-a-service package sold to government\n\nagencies and other malicious actors. The malware\n\nwas used to target more than 100 victims around\n\nthe world including politicians, human rights\n\nactivists, journalists, academics, embassy workers,\n\nand political dissidents. To limit these attacks,\n\nMicrosoft has created and built protections into our\n\nproducts against this unique malware, which we\n\ncall DevilsTongue.[ Note 63 ] By examining how SOURGUM’s\n\ncustomers were delivering DevilsTongue to victim\n\ncomputers, we saw they were doing so through a\n\nchain of exploits that impacted popular browsers\n\nand our Windows operating system. We published\n\ndetails of the malware and 0-day exploits so that\n\nthe world can better understand SOURGUM’s\n\nactivity and address and mitigate the threat.

Microsoft will continue\n\nto identify, track, and protect our customers and\n\nglobal digital ecosystem from the indiscriminate\n\nattacks caused by PSOA technology and pursue\n\nother methods to disrupt this growing threat to our\n\ncustomers.\n\n\n##### Comprehensive protections required \n\nNation state actors have demonstrated that they\n\nwill go to great lengths to accomplish a mission\n\nto collect information or intelligence. The skill and\n\npersistence of malicious nation state actors increase\n\nthe difficulty of detecting and protecting against\n\nadvanced threats. Their impact can be wide ranging\n\nand highly damaging. These adversaries are well\nfunded, employ techniques of tremendous breadth\n\nand sophistication, and are motivated by objectives\n\nof national significance—which may lead to their\n\ncompromising networks for unexpected purposes.\n\nMore than other adversaries, nation state attackers\n\ntarget individuals specifically for access to their\n\nconnections, communications, and information. At\n\nthe conclusion of an operation, they will assess what\n\nwent well and what did not and refine tactics and\n\ntechniques for more successful future missions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHAPTER 4\n\n## Supply chain, IoT, and OT security\n\n###### Introduction\n\n Challenges in managing risk associated with the supplier ecosystem\n\n How Microsoft thinks about supply chain\n\n IoT and OT threat landscape\n\n The 7 properties of highly secured devices\n\n Applying a Zero Trust approach to IoT solutions\n\n IoT at the intersection of cybersecurity and sustainability\n\n IoT security policy considerations\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCTION:\n##### Innovation-driven opportunity in an exponentially larger attack landscape\n\n###### MICHAL BRAVERMAN-BLUMENSTYK, CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, CLOUD AND AI SECURITY\n\n In the past year, we have observed an abundance of incidents driving both physical and digital disruption of operations for many organizations. These incidents preyed at times on the physical realm, such as disruption of production lines and energy substations, and in other cases, they were conducted entirely in the digital realm, such as via a ransomware campaign.\n\n\nLooking at the attack surfaces that were exploited\n\nprovides an additional perspective: from legacy\n\noperational technology (OT) equipment to brand\n\nnew Internet of Things (IoT) devices; from seemingly\n\nordinary cloud-migration projects to 5G IoT-related\n\nendeavors; and from physical supply chain to digital\n\nsupply chain. All of these are playing an increasing role\n\nas fertile attack surfaces. These are all topics we will\n\nelaborate on in this chapter.\n\n###### Supply chain integrity\n\nSupply chains, both physical and digital, have an\n\nexplicit reliance on trust, and adversaries have taken\n\nnotice. Over the last decade, successful organizations\n\nhave been able to meet the demands of scale,\n\nefficiency, and speed by building expansive, and often\n\ncomplex, ecosystems to deliver value to stakeholders.\n\nSecurity adversaries today view these systems as\n\n\ntargets for exploitation, as witnessed recently in\n\nthe highly visible and impactful SolarWinds and\n\nKaseya attacks. While threats and attacks continue to\n\nintensify, supply chain complexity increases the costs\n\nof defending and the likelihood that an exposure can\n\nproduce a significant return for an adversary.\n\n###### IoT Security\n\nIoT security is a geometrically expanding frontier with\n\ninnovation-driven opportunity and an exponentially\n\nlarger attack landscape. The adoption of IoT and the\n\nhuge acceleration in remote services, both at home\n\nand in the workplace since the onset of the COVID-19\n\npandemic, increases the likelihood of risk materializing.\n\nThis is a trend that will continue as technologies like\n\n5G and innovative IoT applications become more\n\nubiquitous.\n\n\n###### OT Security\n\nOT devices, such as industrial control, hospital\n\nmonitoring, or water management systems, represent\n\nthe public infrastructure that many societies have\n\ncome to depend on for decades. Many are lagging\n\nin adopting and leveraging modern security\n\nstandards. As evidenced by recent attacks on water,\n\ntransportation, and energy utilities, disruption in these\n\nareas have profound and broad impact\n\nThe chapter includes discussions about how\n\norganizations can understand and improve their IoT,\n\nOT, and supply chain security posture. We share in\n\nthese discussions our data-driven perspectives related\n\nto the IoT and OT threat landscape, research findings\n\nby the Azure Defender for IoT team, global initiatives\n\nsuch as the Global Cyber Alliance, and more.\n\n\n###### THE ADOPTION\n\n OF IOT AND\n\n THE HUGE\n\n ACCELERATION\n\n IN REMOTE\n\n SERVICES, BOTH\n\n AT HOME AND IN\n\n THE WORKPLACE,\n\n INCREASES THE\n\n LIKELIHOOD\n\n OF RISK\n\n MATERIALIZING.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Challenges in managing risk\n associated with the supplier ecosystem\n\nAs outsourcing for applications, infrastructure, devices, and human capital expands, the adoption of tools to\n\nmonitor multiple tiers of suppliers for quality, security, integrity, and resilience risks is also growing, and the\n\nplethora of frameworks and approaches that organizations are leveraging today continues to grow in tandem.\n\nAdditional complexity emerges when frameworks are applied inconsistently within an organization and across\n\nsuppliers, or if multiple frameworks are in play.\n\nWhen it comes to risk assessment and management, siloes can create additional problems. Different teams\n\nhave different priorities, which can lead to completely different risk appetites, priorities, practices, and cultures.\n\nThis inconsistency can be inefficient and create a duplication of effort, gaps in risk analysis, and an inability to\n\neffectively share risk information across the organization.\n\n\n**An always-on, automated, integrated approach**\n\n**is needed, but current processes aren’t well-suited**\n\nto evolve:\n\n - Supplier assessment and review processes often\n\ninclude just a questionnaire.\n\n - Once a supplier is onboarded, there is only a\n\npoint-in-time annual review cycle.\n\n - Often, different teams within the same company\n\nhave different processes and functions and no\n\nclear way to share information across teams.\n\nThis can make it difficult to create a holistic and\n\nautomated view of organizational risk.\n\n\n###### Siloed environments pose challenges to risk assessment and management\n\n\n###### What we’re hearing\n\nRecently, the Microsoft M365 Security, Compliance, and Management team hosted an event to discuss\n\nthe challenges and strategic needs of CxOs (CISOs, CIOs, VPs/Heads of IT and Governance, and\n\nothers) and their organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their security and risk management\n\nexperiences. ​These are some of the takeaways:\n\n**1. The selection and management of suppliers is shaped by a host of factors leading to lack of**\n\n**clarity and low trust, as many struggle to know their environment.**\n\nOrganizations must balance protecting themselves from human liability, issues inherent with hybrid\n\nwork, shadow IT (unknown or unmanaged apps, services, and infrastructure developed and managed\n\noutside standard policies), diversity of their digital estate, and evolving threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nAdding complexity, there are usually several parties weighing in on vendor/supplier selection. Security\n\nis just one of the factors considered and often not a top priority, even though it is an area that needs\n\nimmediate attention. Organizations end up with long lists of suppliers that must be managed (some\n\nof them unknown), often with a limited look into their security practices and posture. Add to this that\n\nworking within the confines of a supplier contract often limits the assessments. As a result, it is difficult\n\nto have desired visibility and trust in suppliers.\n\n**2. Proactive management of a supplier ecosystem is ideal, but difficult. Designated critical**\n\n**suppliers require focus due to the potential risk they pose.**\n\nOrganizations are often forced into a split approach to supplier management—proactive, when\n\npossible, but typically more reactive. Reactive approaches are a result of limited resources and projects\n\nscoped without security as a consideration. To ensure their protection is as comprehensive as possible,\n\norganizations keep critical suppliers (those critical to an organization’s mission) on a shorter leash, with\n\nless flexibility and more oversight.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. Leaders are devoting more resources to supplier security, but recent breaches demonstrated**\n\n**that traditional models couldn’t guarantee safety.**\n\nIT teams are appreciative of the influx of budget and resources following the SolarWinds and Colonial\n\nPipeline breaches. That appreciation comes with an equal amount of trepidation. Those breaches\n\ndemonstrated that the very strategies they are implementing likely would not protect them from a\n\nsimilar attack, and continuous assessments and push for remediation across tiers of suppliers are\n\nnecessary.\n\n**4. Greater visibility and unique solutions are top requests to managing suppliers.**\n\nWithin the four key pillars of digital estates—identities, applications, infrastructure, and devices—\n\nsuppliers’ personnel are a top concern. Across that risk hierarchy, organizations are looking for\n\nsuppliers to provide:\n\n - Greater visibility into security and who ultimately has access to the organization’s data.\n\n - Customized solutions demonstrating a working knowledge of the industry and the company\nspecific needs.\n\n\n##### How Microsoft thinks about supply chain\n\nThe end-to-end supply chain and supplier\n\necosystem is complex and opaque, extending\n\nfrom development to build, chips to firmware,\n\ndrivers, operating system, third-party applications,\n\nmanufacturing/factory, and all the way to secure\n\nupdates. Governments and critical infrastructure\n\nproviders are looking for a new level of assurance for\n\nsupply chain security and continuity. It’s important\n\nthat a repeatable process will continue to scale as\n\norganizations continue to innovate. Supply chain\n\nsecurity rigor is foundational to how an organization\n\nshould work and is expected by partners and\n\ncustomers who interact with an organization’s\n\nproducts and services.\n\n\n###### Nine secure supply chain focus areas\n\nOutlined below is a framework to efficiently evaluate\n\nyour supply chain ecosystem with considerations\n\nfor how you might approach protecting it. We\n\ngroup our investments into nine secure supply chain\n\nworkstreams to methodically evaluate and mitigate\n\nrisk of exposure in each area.\n\n**_1. First-party engineering systems for hardware_**\n\n**_and software_**\n\nMassive software development companies aren’t\n\nthe only ones doing engineering work. Even small\n\nIT shops that may make minimal development\n\ninvestments and organizations building on top of\n\nexisting infrastructure have teams writing code.\n\n\n###### Zero Trust security model for supplier ecosystem risk\n\nFor supplier risk management, having customized solutions and greater visibility into who ultimately has access\n\nto an organization’s data across domains are top priorities. While there are many places to begin your Zero\n\nTrust journey, from a supplier ecosystem and risk management standpoint, instituting multifactor authentication\n\n(MFA) should be a priority.\n\nFor more information on Zero Trust strategy, see the Hybrid workforce security chapter of this report.\n\n\n###### Nine areas of investment for a secure end-to-end supply chain\n\n\n-----\n\nTo produce secure software or hardware,\n\norganizations must ensure that the first-party\n\nengineering system is secured from the various\n\nthreat vectors that could be exploited by attackers.\n\n**Developer environment:** The developer\n\nenvironment encompasses the tools and\n\nplatforms that developers author code on, such\n\nas operating systems, code editors, research\n\ntools (for example, browsers and associated\n\nwebsites), local build tools, and other general\n\ncode authoring tools. The primary target is\n\ndeveloper identity, and solutions must be put\n\nin place to mitigate this risk.\n\n**Source code: The risk of malicious code can**\n\narise when developers take source code and\n\nbinaries from a variety of sources, including\n\nfrom internal sources, open-source software\n\n(OSS), or from another organization. Each\n\nsource needs to have a level of trust ensured\n\nand known to have appropriately secure\n\nsupply chain checks. In most reported OSS\nas-malware cases, the malware is designed\n\nto steal developer credentials and build\n\nenvironment variables, exfiltrating them to a\n\nremote attacker-controlled server.\n\n\n**Build: Without appropriate protections, the**\n\nbuild pipeline presents product compromise\n\nrisks that can be highly effective and difficult\n\nto trace. While source control will usually have\n\nsome form of change management, without\n\nappropriate controls in place in a build system,\n\nit can be difficult to identify what might have\n\nbeen injected during the build process.\n\n**Release: Ensuring you are releasing what you**\n\nintended is the end goal of a secure software\n\nsupply chain. Enumerating inputs and verifying\n\nthe final product takes a comprehensive\n\nunderstanding of complex systems and is an\n\nessential final step in ensuring an organization\n\nknows what it is releasing.\n\n**_2. Firmware and driver security_**\n\nFirmware and drivers are the foundation of most\n\nhardware devices. If hacked and embedded with\n\nmalware, they pose a huge risk to the hardware\n\ndevice and the organization that depends on it,\n\npotentially creating unauthorized access, making it\n\ninoperable or even unbootable. Organizations need\n\nto ensure that all firmware and drivers installed on\n\nservers or end-user equipment follow the required\n\nsecurity requirements and have the necessary\n\ndocumentation to prove their compliance.\n\n\n**LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING IN**\n\n**CONTINUOUS SECURITY MONITORING**\n\n**OF SUPPLIERS**\n\nMicrosoft leverages machine learning (ML) to scan\n\nactive supplier contracts. This model is trained to\n\nrecognize commonly negotiated security clauses\n\nand determine whether or not they meet the intent\n\nof the original requirement.

Security validations and assurances_**\n\nThe active nature of the adversaries requires\n\ncontinuous evaluation of the security posture of the\n\nend-to-end supply chain to identify and prioritize\n\nsecurity investments. A mix of internal audits,\n\nlessons learned from recent events, and penetration\n\ntesting provides assurance that the right controls\n\nare in place to detect, prevent, and/or mitigate\n\nthese attacks. The findings from these engagements\n\nhelp identify the next set of requirements to\n\nbe addressed.\n\n**_8. Trust chain governance and resilience_**\n\nCustomers trust their supplier organizations protect\n\nthem as they use their products and services. First\nparty trust chains provide identity, integrity, and\n\nnon-repudiation for the organization’s platform,\n\nproducts, and services. The main elements of trust\n\nchains are public key infrastructure, cryptographic\n\nalgorithms, hardware, and the supporting teams and\n\nfacilities. Effective governance of third-party trust\n\nchains is critical.\n\n\n**_9. Monitoring and detections_**\n\nEach of the supply chain focus areas above require\n\nmonitoring, detection, and follow-up actions when\n\nquestionable activity is identified. Increasingly\n\nmonitoring, detection, and initial response are\n\nautomated in today’s hyper-scaled cloud operations.\n\nThese actions cover common cases but can also be\n\nadaptable to deal with new or unimagined scenarios.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Firmware security - Azure Security Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/firmware)_\n\n_(6/24/2021)_\n\n_[Microsoft Open Source Software Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource?activetab=security+analysis%3aprimaryr3)_\n\n_[Datacenter security overview - Microsoft Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-security)_\n\n_[Assurance Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-security)_ _(8/23/2021)_\n\n_[Physical security of Azure datacenters - Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/physical-security)_\n\n\n###### US Executive Order and supply chain security\n\nIssued on May 12, 2021, the Executive Order\n\n(EO) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity\n\n(EO 14028) outlines significant new steps for US\n\nfederal agencies and their technology providers\n\nto strengthen IT modernization, improve incident\n\nresponse, and enhance software supply chain\n\nsecurity.[ Note 66 ] Section 4 focuses on software supply\n\nchain security, enumerating areas of requirements\n\nto be developed for both software providers and\n\nfederal agency users of software.

IoT is more than\n\nconnected devices—it’s about the information\n\nthose devices collect and the powerful, immediate\n\ninsights that can be garnered from that information.\n\nAccordingly, IoT and other embedded and OTs have\n\nbecome critical business, operational, and security\n\ntopics. More than ever, IoT and OT security is finding\n\nits way into corporate boardrooms and state and\n\nfederal legislature discussions as a high-priority\n\nissue, in part due to the increasing frequency and\n\nseverity of attacks in the past year. This proliferation\n\nof attacks has also driven increased awareness\n\nof the extent to which cyberattacks in the digital\n\nrealm can impact the physical realm: the Colonial\n\nPipeline cyberattack directly led to shutdown of the\n\nlargest conduit for gasoline in the United States. The\n\ncompromise of the Oldsmar water\n\n\nplant [ Note 71 ] led to a hazardous situation, in which\n\ncyber actors obtained unauthorized access and\n\nused the SCADA system’s software to increase the\n\nconcentration of sodium hydroxide—a caustic\n\nchemical—in the water. The hack of a security\n\ncamera provider[ Note 72 ] exposed sensitive footage from\n\nhospitals, police departments, and a plethora of\n\nother companies.\n\nAll these developments underscore the need for\n\norganizations to secure their IoT and OT footprints.\n\nOrganizations are interconnected more than ever,\n\nresulting in increased exposure of legacy OT devices\n\nand environments, including those that have existed\n\nin relative isolation. On the other hand, the newest\n\nIoT devices (such as smart TVs and smart sensors)\n\nreside in both OT and IT environments. Putting all\n\nof this together, with the added context of privacy\n\nconcerns and regulatory compliance, stresses the\n\nneed for a holistic approach that enables seamless\n\nsecurity and governance across all OT and IoT\n\ndevices.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[SCADA Hacking: The Most Important SCADA/ICS](https://www.hackers-arise.com/post/scada-hacking-the-most-important-scada-ics-attacks-in-history)_\n\n_[Attacks in History (hackers-arise.com) (4/12/2021)](https://www.hackers-arise.com/post/scada-hacking-the-most-important-scada-ics-attacks-in-history)_\n\n\n###### Evolving cyberthreats\n\nEnterprises are having to contend with evolving\n\ncyberthreats and novel malware.

Upon discovery of a\n\nvulnerability, the findings are shared with relevant\n\nvendors through a responsible disclosure process\n\nled by the Microsoft Security Response Center and\n\nthe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS),\n\nenabling these vendors to investigate and patch\n\nthe vulnerability.\n\nIn April 2021, we uncovered a series of critical\n\nmemory allocation vulnerabilities in IoT and OT\n\ndevices that adversaries could exploit to bypass\n\nsecurity controls to execute malicious code or cause\n\na system crash. The group of vulnerabilities was\n\ndubbed BadAlloc. These remote code execution\n\nvulnerabilities affected a wide range of industries\n\nand verticals, from consumer and medical IoT, to\n\nindustrial IoT, OT, and industrial control systems.\n\nThey covered more than 25 common vulnerabilities\n\nand exposures (CVEs). In the context of IT\n\nenvironments, an exploitation of such a vulnerability\n\ncan result in a loss of confidentiality. In the context\n\nof OT environments, it can be used to trigger a\n\ndisruption of operations.\n\nThe vulnerabilities stem from using vulnerable\n\nmemory functions, such as malloc, calloc, realloc,\n\n\nmemalign, valloc, pvalloc, and others. Our research\n\nshowed that memory allocation implementations\n\nwritten throughout the years as part of IoT devices\n\nand embedded software have not incorporated\n\nproper input validations. Without these input\n\nvalidations, an attacker could exploit the memory\n\nallocation function to perform a heap overflow,\n\nresulting in execution of malicious code on a\n\ntarget device.\n\nThe memory allocation vulnerabilities can be\n\ninvoked by calling the memory allocation function,\n\nsuch as malloc(VALUE), with the VALUE parameter\n\nderived dynamically from external input and being\n\nlarge enough to trigger an integer overflow or\n\nwraparound. The concept is as follows: When\n\nsending this value, the returned outcome is a\n\nfreshly allocated memory buffer. While the size\n\nof the allocated memory remains small due to\n\nthe wraparound, the payload associated with the\n\nmemory allocation exceeds the actual allocated\n\nbuffer, resulting in a heap overflow. This heap\n\noverflow enables an attacker to execute malicious\n\ncode on the target device.\n\nBadAlloc is a case that illustrates the extensive\n\nimpact these vulnerabilities can have because the\n\nrisk exists in IoT and OT devices across all major\n\nindustries. This example highlights one of the\n\nbiggest challenges in mitigating IT, IoT, and OT risks:\n\nthey share attack surfaces, and attackers look at the\n\nentire ecosystem.\n\n\nto ensure that modern digital environments are\n\nnot held back by threats from legacy technology\n\nconnected to OT systems. Mitigation requires an\n\nintegrated approach that spans the entire enterprise.\n\nOrganizations should look for opportunities to\n\nharden, patch, or segment systems to reduce the\n\nattack surface.\n\n\n###### The following is an example of BadAlloc:\n\nThe protection of IoT and OT devices from\n\nexposure to IT risks becomes more important as\n\nthey converge. Too often these risks are addressed\n\nin isolation with a rigidly siloed approach. To be\n\nsuccessful in countering attacks, risks should be\n\ndealt with holistically while also accommodating\n\ndomain expertise in each area. It is also critical\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BadAlloc impact matrix\n\n BadAlloc is an example of an IoT/OT family of vulnerabilities that poses a risk across all industries. The extent and nature of the risk depends on the specific context of usage of the device. BadAlloc shouldn’t be treated as only an OT or IT issue; instead, organizations should take a holistic approach to mitigating the risk.\n\n\n**Mitigating IoT and OT vulnerabilities such**\n\n**as BadAlloc**\n\nWe recommend the following mitigation strategies\n\nfor organizations with IoT and OT devices:\n\n**Patch, patch, patch. Follow vendor instructions for**\n\napplying patches to affected products.\n\n**If you can’t patch, monitor. Since most legacy**\n\nIoT and OT devices don’t support agents, use an\n\nIoT/OT-aware network detection and response\n\n(NDR) solution[ Note 79 ] and a SIEM/SOAR solution[ Note 80 ] to\n\nauto-discover and continuously monitor devices\n\nfor anomalous or unauthorized behaviors, such\n\nas communication with unfamiliar local or remote\n\nhosts. These elements are essential in implementing\n\na Zero Trust strategy for IoT/OT.\n\n**Reduce the attack surface. Eliminate unnecessary**\n\ninternet connections to OT control systems and\n\nimplement virtual private network (VPN) access\n\nwith MFA when remote access is required. The\n\nUS DHS warns that VPN devices may also have\n\nvulnerabilities and should be updated to the most\n\ncurrent version available.\n\n\n**Segment. Network segmentation is important for**\n\nZero Trust because it limits the attacker’s ability\n\nto move laterally and compromise assets after\n\ninitial intrusion.

In many cases, these highly\n\nsecured devices apply additional security measures,\n\nbut in all cases each of the seven properties is\n\npresent. Collectively, these seven properties provide\n\na baseline foundation of security throughout\n\ndevice silicon, software architecture and OS, cloud\n\ncommunications, and cloud services. The complexity\n\nof maintaining all seven properties could be a barrier\n\nfor some organizations, despite the exceptional\n\ncost that often results from a fallout of incomplete\n\ndevice security.\n\n|Hardware root of trust|Device identity and integrity are protected by hardware.

These requirements include\n\nexplicitly verifying users, having visibility into the\n\ndevices they’re bringing on to the network, and\n\nbeing able to make dynamic access decisions by\n\nusing real-time risk detections. Meeting these\n\nrequirements helps to limit the potential blast radius\n\nof users gaining unauthorized access to IoT services\n\nand data in the cloud or on-premises. Otherwise,\n\nyou could face both mass information disclosure\n\n(such as leaked production data of a factory) and\n\npotential elevation of privilege for command and\n\ncontrol of cyber-physical systems (such as stopping\n\na factory production line).\n\n\nAfter basic security requirements are met, you\n\ncan shift your focus to the specific Zero Trust\n\nrequirements for IoT solutions:\n\n**Strong identity to authenticate devices**\n\nRegister devices, issue renewable credentials,\n\nemploy passwordless authentication, and use a\n\nhardware root of trust to ensure you can trust its\n\nidentity before making decisions.\n\n**Least privilege access to mitigate blast radius**\n\nImplement device and workload access control to\n\nlimit any potential blast radius from authenticated\n\nidentities that may have been compromised or\n\nrunning unapproved workloads.\n\n**Device health to gate access or flag devices**\n\n**for remediation**\n\nCheck security configuration, assess for\n\nvulnerabilities and insecure passwords, and monitor\n\nfor active threats and anomalous behavioral alerts\n\nto build ongoing risk profiles.\n\n\n**Continual updates to keep devices healthy**\n\nUtilize a centralized configuration and compliance\n\nmanagement solution and a robust update\n\nmechanism to ensure devices are up to date and in\n\na healthy state.\n\n**Security monitoring and response to detect and**\n\n**respond to emerging threats**\n\nEmploy proactive monitoring to rapidly identify\n\nunauthorized or compromised devices.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Azure Defender for IoT Microsoft Azure|](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-defender-for-iot/)_\n\n\n_[Azure Sentinel – Cloud-native SIEM Solution](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/azure-sentinel/)_\n\n_[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/azure-sentinel/)_\n\n_[https://aka.ms/7properties](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/Seven-Properties-of-Highly-Secured-Devices-2nd-Edition-R1.pdf)_\n\n\n_|_\n\n\n_[Nineteen cybersecurity best practices used to](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/best-practices-for-implementing-seven-properties-in-azure-sphere/Best%20practices%20for%20implementing%20seven%20properties%20in%20Azure%20Sphere_June2020update.pdf)_\n\n_[implement the seven properties of highly secured](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/best-practices-for-implementing-seven-properties-in-azure-sphere/Best%20practices%20for%20implementing%20seven%20properties%20in%20Azure%20Sphere_June2020update.pdf)_\n\n_[devices in Azure Sphere (microsoft.com) (July 2020)](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/best-practices-for-implementing-seven-properties-in-azure-sphere/Best%20practices%20for%20implementing%20seven%20properties%20in%20Azure%20Sphere_June2020update.pdf)_\n\n_[Zero Trust Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/zero-trust-cybersecurity-for-the-internet-of-things/)_\n\n_(4/30/2021)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### IOT at the intersection of cybersecurity and sustainability\n\nOrganizations generally deploy IoT to improve the\n\nbottom line: better quality, higher productivity/\n\nless downtime, production optimization, and\n\nreducing operating costs and/or increasing output\n\nnonlinearly. Improving the business in these ways\n\nalso reduces waste: less resource use for the same\n\nor greater output, higher uptime, reduction in scrap,\n\nand so on. While IoT investment specifically for\n\nsustainability is less common, sustainability as an\n\ninitiative is no longer regarded as a zero-sum effort\n\nin conflict with business value.\n\nAs organizations face increasing pressure to improve\n\ntheir environmental footprint—from shareholder\n\ncalls and new government regulations—\n\n\nsustainability will become a primary driver for\n\noperational deployment of IoT. To make significant\n\nimprovements to their environmental footprint,\n\norganizations must assess and monitor their\n\nbehavior and then use automated or remote\ncontrol methods to optimize it.\n\nThe challenge is figuring out how to measure,\n\nmonitor, and automate these systems securely.\n\nThese systems might contain sensitive data, connect\n\nto business systems across your organization,\n\nand increasingly impact the physical operation of\n\nyour enterprise. Attacks like the aforementioned\n\nTriton[ Note 82 ] or Crash Override[ Note 83 ] that specifically target\n\nOT systems demonstrate that these systems\n\nare attractive targets for nation states and\n\ncybercriminals, and they have the potential to both\n\ndisrupt business operations and potentially create\n\nenvironmental damage.\n\nIt is essential to assess the security of OT systems\n\nwith the same rigor and comprehensiveness as\n\nIT systems. As we have observed, attackers will\n\nchoose the “soft targets” as a point of ingress. Spear\n\nphishing or similar attacks allow access to IT systems\n\n\nthat can then provide a pathway for attackers to\n\nreach OT systems, and the reverse is also possible.\n\nIn one example, attackers used an aquarium\n\nsystem to access a casino’s high-roller databases,[ Note 84 ]\n\ndemonstrating that any device with connectivity can\n\npresent a motivated attacker with an opening.\n\nWhile many organizations are evolving their IT\n\nsecurity approach (moving away from a perimeter\nbased security model to a Zero Trust model), IoT\n\nis often overlooked and lagging. For example,\n\norganizations know to encrypt sensitive data from\n\napplications, but many have not considered that\n\ntheir control systems rely on the Modbus protocol,\n\nwhich by design lacks any authentication and sends\n\ndata in the open. While PCs are routinely required\n\nto have updated certificates, IoT devices are often\n\ndeployed with factory default passwords.\n\nCompromises in these OT systems may disrupt\n\noperations, but attackers are also focusing on how\n\nIoT and OT interact. Industrial control systems are\n\noften updated or retrofitted with remote capabilities,\n\nintroducing new attack vectors that allow virtual\n\nattacks to cause harm in physical scenarios. Earlier\n\nthis year, a water treatment plant in Florida fell\n\nvictim to an attacker that remotely accessed critical\n\nsystems and attempted to alter the amount of\n\nchemicals in the water supply.[ Note 85 ]\n\n\nMoreover, it is critical to understand the security\n\nposture of supply systems that are not on the\n\norganization’s IT/OT network, but nonetheless affect\n\noperations. Just as an organization looks to improve\n\nefficiency and sustainability, its suppliers do too.\n\nThese supply systems may be connected outside\n\nof the network (such as cellular) to measure and\n\nmonitor the device operation, reduce truck rolls,\n\nand deliver more uptime. Compromises in externally\n\nmanaged infrastructure components can directly\n\nimpact downstream businesses. For example, turning\n\noff the chillers in a building could halt operations\n\nand spoil inventory, air quality sensors may not alert\n\nworkers to unsafe conditions, and so on.\n\nWhile IoT can and will enable better environmental\n\npractices, it is essential that all connected systems—\n\nwhich may be in place for a decade or longer—are\n\ndesigned, evaluated, and operated securely. As the\n\nworld adapts to the new priorities that emerged\n\nduring the pandemic, companies are looking to\n\naddress the growing sustainability challenges ahead.\n\nSecured IoT will play a critical role in enabling\n\nbusinesses to both sustainably use and protect vital\n\nresources and utilities today and into the future.\n\n\n###### It is essential to assess the security of OT systems with the same rigor and comprehensiveness as IT systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### IoT adoption for sustainability\n\n##### IoT security policy considerations\n\nPolicymakers around the world are acknowledging\n\nthe profound implications of IoT security for privacy,\n\nsafety, critical infrastructure protection, and digital\n\ntransformation in general. Approaches to IoT\n\nsecurity policy range from voluntary programs to\n\nmandatory security requirements. The range of IoT\n\ndevice types, growing number of devices, and the\n\nvolume of interactions between devices, the physical\n\nworld, and the internet make developing effective\n\n\n###### Those adopting IoT for sustainability are more likely to be in the implementation phase of their AI strategy than those adopting IoT for other reasons.[ Note 86 ]\n\nand appropriately tailored cybersecurity policy a\n\ncomplex task. To tackle the IoT threat landscape,\n\nthe global community of IoT manufacturers and\n\ncybersecurity experts has developed sets of\n\nbest practice standards for IoT device cybersecurity.\n\nThese standards have demonstrated effectiveness\n\nagainst common attacks, and industry and\n\npolicymakers alike can leverage them for\n\nimmediate improvements to the global state of\n\nIoT device security for consumer, enterprise, and\n\ngovernment users.\n\n###### Minimum security baselines\n\nStandards for minimum IoT security baselines\n\nprovide a promising start to improving global\n\n\ncybersecurity health. These standards are intended\n\nto provide guidance for manufacturers, developers,\n\nand users to identify and adopt best practices for\n\ndevice security. Prominent examples of international\n\nstandards include the European Telecommunications\n\nStandards Institute (ETSI) standard for consumer\n\nIoT security released in June 2020, ETSI EN 303 645.\n\nThe ETSI standard is now a public set of resources\n\nthat governments and companies around the world\n\ncan use to enhance the security of IoT devices,\n\nand it includes both governance and technical\n\nrecommendations. It was created through a\n\nrigorous and collaborative multistakeholder process\n\ninvolving experts from industry, government,\n\nand academia. Similarly, after an iterative public\n\nconsultation process, in May 2020, NIST released\n\nNISTIR 8259A, which details a baseline set of device\n\ncapabilities necessary for common cybersecurity\n\ncontrols. The International Organization for\n\nStandardization (ISO) and the International\n\nElectrotechnical Commission (IEC) are also\n\ndeveloping a minimum-security baseline.\n\nPolicy can help manufacturers adopt international\n\nstandards in a consistent way to improve security\n\nacross a range of consumer products and\n\npromote an advanced state of security in critical\n\napplications. In the United States, policy initiatives\n\nbased on standards include the IoT Cybersecurity\n\nImprovement Act of 2020,[ Note 87 ] which references NISTIR\n\n8259A for managing risks associated with US federal\n\n\nagency use of IoT devices, and EO 14028, which\n\nproposes a consumer IoT device labeling program\n\nthat may also reference NISTIR 8259A as well as\n\ncompatibility with ETSI or ISO standards. Other\n\nexamples include the proposed mandatory security\n\nrequirements for consumer smart devices in the\n\nUK,[ Note 88 ] and the voluntary device labeling schemes\n\nin Singapore and Finland, all based on ETSI EN\n\n303 645. In leveraging international standards and\n\nwidely used best practices, policymakers can also\n\nhelp to ensure that mandatory requirements are\n\nconsistent and mutually recognized across regions\n\nto avoid fragmentation that would work against IoT\n\ninnovation, interoperability, and security.\n\n###### Global Cyber Alliance project: How policy and standards improve IoT security\n\nStandards, laws, and proposed requirements for\n\nminimum IoT device security baselines share many\n\ncommonly recommended or required controls.\n\nThe first three provisions of the ETSI standard for\n\nconsumer IoT security, ETSI EN 303 645, are the most\n\nhighly recommended by ETSI and make appearances\n\nin several national-level policies. These include:\n\n1. No default passwords\n\n2. Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy\n\n3. Keep software updated\n\n\n-----\n\nState laws in California and Oregon both prohibit\n\ndefault passwords for IoT devices. Similarly,\n\nrecommendations or requirements for updated\n\nsoftware and use of secure communications\n\nprotocols like HTTPS also frequently appear in\n\nstandards and policies around the globe.\n\nMicrosoft supported a research study conducted by\n\nthe Global Cyber Alliance (GCA)[ Note 89 ] to demonstrate\n\nthe effectiveness of commonly recommended\n\ncontrols in preventing attacks. The analysis can be\n\n###### GCA honeyfarm attacker traffic by protocol\n\n\nused to help policymakers and industry leaders\n\nunderstand the benefit of best practice approaches\n\nto IoT device security, and as proof points for\n\nmanufacturers to adopt standards and comply\n\nwith policy.\n\nUsing home-grown honeypot technology, GCA\n\ncreated an enticingly accessible target for would-be\n\nattackers to learn as much as possible about the\n\nexistence, source, and prevalence of attacks. GCA\n\noperated a large honey farm of several hundred\n\n\nemulated IoT devices distributed worldwide to\n\nprovide real, at-scale, long-term attack data to\n\nunderstand trends and changes in IoT attack\n\nmethodologies.\n\nThe research tested three controls commonly\n\nreferenced in IoT security standards and policy:\n\n - Secured access control (“no default passwords”)\n\n - Device capability to update software and\n\nrecommendation to keep software updated\n\n - Data in transit is protected\n\n\n**SUMMARY OF GCA CONCLUSIONS**\n\nGCA’s analysis of real attack data shows that default\n\npasswords factory-set by device manufacturers and\n\nnever changed by users, along with weak passwords\n\nset by users, together represent the most exploited\n\nsecurity vulnerability for IoT devices. Policy and\n\nregulatory frameworks can help drive adoption and\n\nharmonize implementation of the requirements in\n\nIoT device security standards such as NISTIR 8259,\n\nETSI EN 303 645, and ISO/IEC 27402 to promote\n\nsecured access control best practices and address\n\nthis risk.\n\n\n###### Roughly equal attacker traffic scanning for open ports through which to launch attacks.\n\n\n###### GCA honeyfarm attacks with activity (commands and downloads) by protocol\n\n Telnet is the clear protocol of choice for exploitation in attacks launched on IoT devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we look at attacks against these two ports, we see things are anything but static. Different actors come\n\nand go, in many cases repurposing bots with leaked source code such as MIRAI. Often these attacks replicate\n\nexisting ways of working, but we have started to see more advanced use cases where bots are leveraging new\n\nexploits.[ Note 90 ] It is worth noting that many of these attacks continue to use poor passwords as a basis for lateral\n\nmovement between infected hosts.\n\nMicrosoft’s sensor network gives us raw data on these types of attacks and the passwords in use. We looked at\n\nover 280,000 attacks and analyzed the password data we collected. Perhaps unsurprisingly we saw that 96% of\n\nattacks used a password with fewer than 10 characters, 92% had fewer than 8, and slightly more shockingly, 72%\n\nof all attacks required only trying a password of 6 characters or less. Within these password attempts, only 2%\n\nincluded a special character and 72% didn’t even contain a number.\n\nThe attacks we are seeing in the wild line up with the GCA data and other reports. Default passwords, which are\n\ngenerally a single short English word, make it trivial for an attacker to access an organization’s infrastructure. If\n\nsecure identity management with an organization’s IoT devices is not an option, longer passwords—especially\n\nthose with special characters—are strongly advised.\n\n###### Attacks against Telnet and SSH ports\n\n\nThe research also showed widespread prevalence\n\nof attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities in\n\nthe software stacks of IoT devices. This finding\n\noffers support for the effectiveness of keeping\n\nsoftware updated and using secure communications\n\nprotocols to prevent attempts to compromise\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nThe prevalence of attack attempts observed on\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities in IoT device software also\n\nsupports the notion that commonly recommended\n\nnontechnical controls would reduce the likelihood\n\nof attack success. In particular, requirements for\n\nmanufacturers to implement a vulnerability disclosure\n\nand management policy and to disclose the security\n\nsupport status of their products would provide\n\nvaluable information to consumers.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Global Cyber Alliance: IoT Policy and Attack Report](https://www.globalcyberalliance.org/reports_publications/iot-policy-and-attack-report/)_\n\n\n###### Microsoft data and threat signals support these findings\n\nThe GCA project findings align well to what Microsoft\n\nsees across its IoT sensor network. Generic HTTP\n\nscanning and scraping forms the bulk of requests we\n\nreceive, followed by Secure Shell (SSH) and Telnet,\n\nrespectively. Both protocols are frequently seen\n\nacross IoT/OT devices, with Telnet in particular being\n\na favorite of botnets like MIRAI and others based on\n\nit. The two protocols are also commonly associated\n\nwith brute force password attacks, and when taken\n\ntogether become the most prevalent type of attack\n\nwe see against IoT/OT devices.\n\n###### Distribution of attacks against popular IoT/OT protocols (July 2020-June 2021)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Passwords seen in 45 days of sensor signals\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHAPTER 5\n\n## Hybrid workforce security\n\n###### Introduction\n\n A Zero Trust approach for securing hybrid work\n\n Identities\n\n Devices/Endpoints\n\n Applications\n\n Network\n\n Infrastructure\n\n Data\n\n People\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCTION:\n##### The basics matter\n\n###### BRET ARSENAULT, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER\n\n This past year continued to challenge us in profound ways. While most industries made the shift to remote work due to the pandemic, it created new attack surfaces for cybercriminals to take advantage of, such as home devices being used for business purposes. In the first half of 2021, there were three significant assaults: NOBELIUM (the SolarWinds supply chain attack), HAFNIUM (an on-premises Exchange server attack), and Colonial Pipeline (a ransomware attack).\n\n\nMany lessons can be learned. First, a continuing\n\nthreat vector is email compromise. In fact, phishing is\n\nresponsible for almost 70% of data breaches.[ Note 91 ] Second,\n\ncybercriminals are using malware that is posed as a\n\nlegitimate software update to target unsuspecting\n\nemployees. Third, ransomware attackers have raised\n\nthe stakes to focus not only on double or triple\n\nextortion tactics in terms of a payout but are also\n\noffering ransomware as a service (RaaS), which uses\n\na partner network to carry out an attack, making it\n\ntough to determine who the real bad actor is. Finally,\n\nadversaries are targeting on-premises systems,\n\nreinforcing the need for organizations to move\n\ninfrastructure to the cloud where security is more\n\ndifficult to penetrate.[ Note 92 ]\n\nWhile these incidents taught us tough lessons, a key\n\ntakeaway is that the basics matter. A primary way\n\ncriminals get in is through an unlocked door.\n\n\nIf compromised organizations had applied basic\n\nsecurity hygiene like patching, applying updates, or\n\nturning on multifactor authentication (MFA), they\n\nmay have been spared or less impacted. In fact, it\n\nis shocking that less than 20% of our customers are\n\nusing strong authentication such as MFA[ Note 93 ] (which\n\nis free to our customers and can be turned on by\n\ndefault). Organizations that do not apply or maintain\n\nthese basic hygiene practices will face much greater\n\nexposure to attacks.\n\nAlong with the security basics, Microsoft relies on\n\nan approach called Zero Trust,[ Note 94 ] which assumes the\n\nnetwork has been breached. Zero Trust means we\n\ndon’t assume any identity or device on our network\n\nis secure—we continually verify it. Zero Trust helps\n\nus strike a balance in making sure employees can be\n\nproductive, secure, and healthy beyond the corporate\n\nnetwork from home, the office, or anywhere in-between.\n\n\n###### Recommendations for getting started with Zero Trust:\n\n**• Identities are validated and secured with MFA**\n\n**everywhere. Using MFA helps eliminate the need**\n\nfor passwords. The added use of biometrics (such\n\nas retina eye scans or fingerprints) also ensures\n\nstrong authentication of a user’s identity.\n\n**• Devices are managed and validated as healthy.**\n\nAs a condition of access to any company resource,\n\nall device types and operating systems should be\n\nrequired to meet a minimum healthy device state\n\nbefore being validated.\n\n - Monitoring and threat signals are pervasive.\n\nMake sure to collect all available logs, data, and\n\nsignals to understand the current security state,\n\nwhich will help you identify gaps in coverage,\n\ndiscover anomalies, and drive a better employee\n\nexperience.\n\n\n###### ORGANIZATIONS\n\n THAT DO NOT\n\n APPLY OR\n\n MAINTAIN\n\n THESE BASIC\n\n HYGIENE PRACTICES\n\n WILL FACE MUCH\n\n GREATER EXPOSURE\n\n TO ATTACKS.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur goal with this report is to share insights from\n\nour own internal teams who are doing this work\n\neach day, to help educate and empower others to\n\nimprove their cyber defense techniques to protect\n\ntheir employees, their companies, and our online\n\necosystem.\n\nAnd remember, you can’t secure future work if you\n\ndon’t secure your past work.\n\n###### Moving toward a hybrid workforce at Microsoft\n\nNo one knows how or when the COVID-19\n\npandemic will end, but at some point, COVID-19\n\nwill no longer place a significant burden on\n\nour communities and will present itself more\n\nlike an endemic virus such as influenza. Local\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n\nhealth situations and local government guidance\n\ndetermines how many employees we allow at a\n\nworksite and what services are made available. Once\n\na location fully reopens, we return to somewhat\n\nnormal operations with services that were provided\n\npre-pandemic. As Microsoft offices globally invite\n\nmore employees back to the worksite, we are\n\ngradually seeing an increase in the number of\n\nemployees badging-in (scanning their badges for\n\nbuilding entry) each week. We expect this number\n\nwill continue to rise as more locations fully reopen.\n\nHowever, we do not expect these numbers to reach\n\npre-pandemic levels of attendance. Our flexible\n\nwork approach means that we expect to see most\n\nemployees spending at least some time each week\n\nworking remotely, even in locations where COVID-19\n\nis no longer a significant burden.\n\n\n###### Global pre-COVID onsite work and the rapid move to remote work, followed by gradual return\n\n Global weekly unique badge scans (January – August 2021)\n\n\n_[Securing a new world of hybrid work: What to know and what to do - Microsoft Security (5/12/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/12/securing-a-new-world-of-hybrid-work-what-to-know-and-what-to-do/)_\n\n_[Work Trend Index: Microsoft’s latest research on the ways we work.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work)_\n\n_[The Next Great Disruption Is Hybrid Work—Are We Ready?

Security\n\narchitectures that rely on network firewalls and\n\nvirtual private networks (VPNs) to isolate and\n\nrestrict access to corporate technology resources\n\nand services are no longer sufficient for a workforce\n\nthat regularly requires access to applications and\n\nresources that exist beyond traditional corporate\n\nnetwork boundaries. The shift to the internet\n\nas the network of choice and the continuously\n\nevolving threats led Microsoft to adopt a Zero Trust\n\nsecurity model. Zero Trust has become a priority of\n\nenterprise security leaders around the world.\n\nWe are facing a moment of reckoning as the world\n\nwitnesses a rise in increasingly sophisticated and\n\nexpansive cybersecurity attacks. This reality—\n\ncoupled with work entering its next great disruption,\n\nthe move to hybrid environments—has ushered in\n\n\nan urgent opportunity for all companies around\n\nthe world to adopt a Zero Trust approach and\n\nassume all activity, even by trusted users, could be\n\nan attempted breach. Signals across the industry\n\nhighlight that every company needs to create a\n\nculture of security and modernize their approach to\n\nensure they are protected.\n\n###### Zero Trust principles\n\nZero Trust eliminates the inherent trust that is\n\nassumed inside the traditional corporate network.\n\nAn effective Zero Trust architecture is designed to\n\nreduce risk at every opportunity across the digital\n\nestate. In practice, this means that every transaction\n\nbetween systems must be validated and proven\n\ntrustworthy before the transaction can occur. For an\n\neffective Zero Trust strategy, we recommend these\n\nguiding principles:\n\n**Verify explicitly**\n\nAlways authenticate and authorize based on all\n\navailable data points, including user identity,\n\nlocation, device health, service or workload, data\n\nclassification, and anomalies.\n\n**Use least privilege access**\n\nLimit user access with just-in-time and just-enough\naccess (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive polices and data\n\nprotection to help secure both data and productivity.\n\n\n**Assume breach**\n\nMinimize blast radius and segment access. Verify\n\nend-to-end encryption and use analytics to get\n\nvisibility, manage insider risk, drive threat detection,\n\nand improve defenses.\n\n###### An integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy\n\nZero Trust controls and technologies are deployed\n\nacross six foundational technology pillars. Each\n\npillar is a source of signal, a control plane for\n\nenforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.\n\nIn a Zero Trust architecture, they are interconnected\n\nby automated enforcement of security policy,\n\ncorrelation of signal and security automation, and\n\norchestration.\n\n###### Zero Trust across the digital estate\n\n\n**_1. Identities_**\n\nIdentities can represent people, services, or IoT\n\ndevices. When an identity attempts to access\n\na resource, verify that identity with strong\n\nauthentication, and ensure access is compliant and\n\ntypical for that identity. Follow least privilege access\n\nprinciples.\n\n**_2. Endpoints_**\n\nOnce an identity has been granted access to a\n\nresource, data can flow to a variety of different\n\nendpoints—from IoT devices to smartphones, BYOD\n\nto partner-managed devices, and on-premises\n\nworkloads to cloud-hosted servers. This diversity\n\ncreates a massive attack surface area. Monitor and\n\nenforce device health and compliance for secure\n\naccess.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Hybrid workplace intent\n\n The shift to a hybrid workplace is driving broader adoption of Zero Trust strategy. 81% of enterprise organizations have begun the move toward a hybrid workplace, with 31% already fully adopted.\n\n\n**_3. Applications_**\n\nApplications and application programming\n\ninterfaces (APIs) provide the interface by which data\n\nis consumed. They may be legacy on-premises,\n\nworkloads moved to the cloud, or modern software\n\nas a service (SaaS) applications. Apply controls and\n\ntechnologies to discover shadow or unsanctioned IT,\n\nensure appropriate in-app permissions, gate access\n\nbased on real-time analytics, monitor for abnormal\n\nbehavior, control user actions, and validate secure\n\nconfiguration options.\n\n**_4. Network_**\n\nAll data is ultimately accessed over network\n\ninfrastructure. Networking controls can provide\n\ncritical controls to enhance visibility and help\n\nprevent attackers from moving laterally across\n\nthe network. Segment networks (and do deeper\n\nin-network micro-segmentation) and deploy real\ntime threat protection, end-to-end encryption,\n\nmonitoring, and analytics.\n\n\n_[The critical role of Zero Trust in securing our world](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/06/30/the-critical-role-of-zero-trust-in-securing-our-world/?culture=en-us&country=US)_\n\n_[Microsoft Security Blog (6/30/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/06/30/the-critical-role-of-zero-trust-in-securing-our-world/?culture=en-us&country=US)_\n\n\n**_5. Infrastructure_**\n\nInfrastructure—whether on-premises servers, cloud\nbased virtual machines (VMs), containers, or micro\nservices—represents a critical threat vector. Assess\n\nfor version, configuration, and JIT access to harden\n\ndefense. Use logging and monitoring to detect\n\nattacks and anomalies, and automatically block and\n\nflag risky behavior and take protective actions.\n\n**_6. Data_**\n\nUltimately, security teams are protecting data. Data\n\nshould remain protected throughout its lifecycle\n\neven if it leaves the devices, apps, infrastructure,\n\nand networks the organization controls.

Most organizations approach Zero Trust\n\nas an end-to-end strategy to be completed over\n\ntime. Eventually, they seek to adopt this strategy\n\nacross all security risk areas to ensure even more\n\nprotection against threats.\n\n\n_|_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Current zero trust implementation – security risk areas\n\n There is no one-size-fits-all approach to Zero Trust implementation, giving permission to start anywhere.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Zero Trust Adoption Report (7/27/2021)](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWGWha)_\n\n_[Resources for accelerating your Zero Trust journey - Microsoft Security (5/24/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/24/resources-for-accelerating-your-zero-trust-journey/)_\n\n_[Zero Trust Security Model and Framework Microsoft Security|](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust)_\n\n\n##### Identities\n\nIn Azure Active Directory we observe 50 million\n\npassword attacks daily, yet only 20% of users\n\nand 30% of global admins are using strong\n\nauthentications such as MFA.[ Note 96 ] Password-based\n\nattacks remain the main source of Identity\n\ncompromise. However, other types of attacks are\n\nemerging, including consent phishing and attacks\n\non nonhuman identities.\n\n###### Password-based attacks\n\nAzure AD is the front door to all Microsoft cloud\n\nservices. Our sign-in service sees 90 billion\n\nauthentication requests per day, which gives us\n\ngreat visibility on identity attacks happening\n\nacross all our clouds. Password-based attacks on\n\nuser identities are still the most prevalent vector\n\nof identity compromise. While password spray\n\nand credential stuffing used to be the largest\n\nvectors of identity compromise, in the last year,\n\nwe observed a significant change of tactics by the\n\nbad-actor ecosystem. In the last few years, but most\n\nnotably during the pandemic, Microsoft and our\n\ncustomers have invested significantly in reducing\n\nthe attack surface for bad actors to compromise\n\nAzure AD–backed accounts. The enhancement of\n\nsecurity posture (security defaults, MFA adoption,\n\npassword protection, legacy authentication block),\n\n\nas well as our investments in detection (malicious\n\nIP address, password spray detection), have caused\n\na reduction in password brute-force attacks that\n\nuse legacy authentication protocols, such as IMAP\n\nor SMTP. The volume of attacks that we attribute to\n\nbreach replay and password spray have decreased\n\nsignificantly, while at the same time we are seeing\n\na large increase in attacks attributed to phishing\n\nor other more sophisticated techniques, such as\n\ncredential harvesting with malware. The data shows\n\nthat bad actors have adapted their tactics to keep\n\ncompromising accounts.\n\nAlthough blocking legacy authentication and\n\nenabling MFA are still the most important defenses\n\nfor any organization, phishing protection is\n\nbecoming more relevant than ever. Even with\n\nMFA enabled, users can still have their credentials\n\nphished by real-time man-in-the-middle phishing\n\ntools that replicate the sign-in page and replay\n\nthe MFA prompt to collect the one-time password\n\nsent to the user. To protect from this type of attack,\n\ncustomers can adopt Fido2-based credentials (based\n\non a public key cryptographic key pair), such as\n\nsecurity keys or Windows Hello for Business.[ Note 97 ]\n\n\n###### Identity is more important than ever.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Monthly compromised users by attack category (June 2020 – June 2021) Rise in phishing emails using OAuth request URLs\n\n\n###### Geo-distribution of IP addresses issuing Emerging trends in attacks password brute-force attacks in July 2021\n\n**_OAuth consent phishing_**\n\nIn typical phishing, an attacker looking to steal\n\ncredentials will craft a convincing email, host a\n\nfake landing page, and expect the user to fall for\n\nthe lure. On a successful phishing attempt, the\n\nuser credentials are passed on to the attacker.\n\nConsent phishing is a bit different. This method\n\nattempts to trick users into granting permissions\n\nto a malicious attacker-owned application and uses\n\nthe obtained access tokens to retrieve the users’\n\naccount data. This is a very sophisticated attack as\n\n\nthe access tokens do not require knowledge of a\n\nuser’s password, and the user’s password is never\n\nshared with the attacker. Most importantly, as this is\n\nnot a credential based attack, strong authentication\n\nrequirements such as MFA do not prevent attacks\n\nthat use this technique.\n\nIn the last six months, the monthly average of\n\nphishing emails using OAuth URLs has almost\n\ndoubled. These phishing emails target a variety of\n\nlegitimate cloud services such as Microsoft, Google,\n\nand Facebook. We are seeing an upward trend in the\n\nnumber of unique emails with OAuth phishing links.\n\n\nMicrosoft recommends limiting user consent to\n\nallow user consent only to apps from verified\n\npublishers.\n\nMicrosoft has deployed several defenses to counter\n\nthis trend, including specific machine-learning\nbased detections to identify, isolate, and disable\n\nmalicious applications. Strategies that can help\n\nprevent such attacks include granular user consent\n\npolicies, blocking consent-phishing emails, anomaly\n\ndetection, and user awareness training.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe challenge of credentials in code is not a new\n\none. While most major vendors including Azure\n\nDevOps and GitHub offer safeguards to flag such\n\ncredentials for removal, the practice persists. Those\n\ncredentials provide attackers a direct path into\n\nan organization’s environment while flying under\n\nthe radar in the Azure AD Audit logs. Microsoft\n\nrecommends that customers audit their engineering\n\nartifacts, including code repositories for credentials.\n\n###### Adoption of security posture\n\n**_Strong authentication adoption_**\n\nFor identities, verifying explicitly means ensuring\n\nthe identities are using strong authentication when\n\naccessing resources. Microsoft research shows that\n\nrequiring strong authentication can protect against\n\n99.9% of the identity attacks because the majority\n\nof the attacks are related to passwords. While\n\naugmenting passwords can help defend against\n\nthose attacks, eliminating passwords altogether\n\nwith passwordless authentication methods can\n\nprovide the most usable and secure authentication\n\nexperience.\n\nAs companies have been adapting their security\n\nposture for remote work and a hybrid workforce,\n\nwe have seen over 220% increase in strong\n\n\nAs a result of these countermeasures, there was\n\nan 89% increase in disabled apps from January to\n\nJune 2021 compared to July to December 2020.\n\nUpon detailed investigation, we saw that the major\n\nmalicious vectors have shifted from a multi-tenant\n\nphishing attack to an abusive type of attack.\n\n\nFor more information on phishing trends and\n\nmitigation, see the State of cybercrime chapter of\n\nthis report.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Microsoft delivers comprehensive solution to battle](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/14/microsoft-delivers-comprehensive-solution-to-battle-rise-in-consent-phishing-emails/?web_view=true)_\n\n_[rise in consent phishing emails Microsoft Security |](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/14/microsoft-delivers-comprehensive-solution-to-battle-rise-in-consent-phishing-emails/?web_view=true)_\n\n_[Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/14/microsoft-delivers-comprehensive-solution-to-battle-rise-in-consent-phishing-emails/?web_view=true)_ _(7/14/2021)_\n\n\n**_Attacks on nonhuman accounts_**\n\nWe saw a significant uptick in the volume of\n\nattacks against applications and service principal\n\nidentities.[ Note 98 ] Unlike users, these identities are often\n\nmore vulnerable because organizations do not\n\nconsistently apply many of the typical safeguards\n\nsuch as strong authentication, rigorous lifecycle\n\nmanagement, and security monitoring to this\n\ncategory of accounts. As a result, we have seen\n\nattackers exploiting application identities that\n\nalready have a privileged role or are scoped to a\n\nwide set of permissions. Unlike the typical “Initial\n\nAccess -> Privilege Escalation” attack chain,\n\nthis attack vector gains initial access through a\n\ncompromised user or a leaked application credential.\n\nWe have seen attackers who gain initial access\n\nthrough a compromised user use their elevated\n\nprivilege to conduct reconnaissance to identify\n\napplications with existing permissions, add a new set\n\nof application credentials if needed, and even assign\n\nprivileged roles to the application. As a result, the\n\napplication behaves normally in the environment\n\nwhile still operating as a tool for the attacker.\n\nCustomers should conduct a review of application\n\nroles and permissions to conform to the principle\n\nof least privilege and monitor their Azure AD Audit\n\n\nlogs for unfamiliar activity on applications and\n\nauthentication usage in the last 18 months.\n###### Hackers don’t break in, service principals. they log in.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Strong authentication usage in Azure AD\n\nMicrosoft enables security defaults for all new customers to ensure that everyone has at least a basic level of\n\nprotection, including controls like MFA for administrators.[ Note 99 ]\n\n###### Tenants with security defaults enabled\n\n\n**_Growth in Zero Trust access policy usage_**\n\nAzure AD Conditional Access is a security policy engine for verifying explicitly and granting least privilege\n\naccess. In the last year, the number of conditional access policies deployed has more than doubled, as\n\norganizations revamped their security postures to account for a remote workforce.\n\nWhen a user accesses an application, administrators can use conditional access to configure which additional\n\nrequirements are enforced to grant access. As organizations embrace Zero Trust security principles, we have\n\nseen greater adoption in managed device and managed app requirements in addition to MFA.\n\n###### Most frequently required access controls in Azure AD (July 2020 – June 2021)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Legacy protocols: A preferred entry point for adversaries_**\n\nOne of the leading sources of compromise in organizations is authentication from legacy protocols, such\n\nas IMAP, SMTP, POP, and MAPI. These protocols do not support MFA, so they are preferred entry points for\n\nadversaries. In fact, 99% of password spray and 97% of credential stuffing attacks use legacy authentication,\n\naccording to authentication data from Azure AD. Data from Azure AD reveals that the compromise rate for\n\nauthentications using IMAP clients is 22 times higher than the compromise rate for authentications from\n\na browser.\n\n###### Account compromise rate by authentication protocol (July 2020 – June 2021)\n\n\nFortunately, end users and admins have begun making progress toward using modern authentication in\n\ntheir organizations.\n\nThe hybrid world is largely “perimeterless,” so wrapping protections around identity and devices is critical. As\n\npart of Zero Trust, we also think the future is passwordless,[ Note 100 ] and we will start to see that transition this year.\n\n###### Percentage of legacy authentication among monthly active users of Azure Active Directory\n\n Over the past year, we have seen the percent of users with legacy authentication clients decrease over 30% to nearly 10% of users in Azure AD.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Devices/Endpoints\n\n###### What we’re seeing \n\nMostly driven by necessity as the world shifted to a remote or hybrid work model, users are working from\n\nanywhere, from any device, more than any time in history, and attackers are quickly adjusting their tactics to\n\ntake advantage of this change. Enterprises are left weighing the benefits of enabling BYOD (allowing their end\n\nusers to access corporate resources that traditionally required VPN or on-premises access) against the increased\n\nrisk of the same users unintentionally installing ransomware or other malware while performing non-work\nrelated functions on their personal devices. By enabling BYOD using a Zero Trust model, enterprises can reduce\n\nprovisioning costs and avoid additional hardware purchases for work-from-home use, but they need to be able\n\nto protect their corporate assets on these devices, while still allowing the users to perform non-work functions\n\non these same devices.\n\n###### Mobile device management (Intune data)\n\n Sharp rise in mobile device management growth as workers moved from office to BYOD and home PCs\n\n\n###### Recommendations for mitigating BYOD risk\n\nTo mitigate the increased risks of any BYOD model, it’s important to ensure constant verification of specified\n\nsecurity standards as well as validation of the identity of the device and user to gate control of critical company\n\nresources. For example, you can block access to a personal device that has been jailbroken (modified to remove\n\nrestrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operator) to ensure that enterprise applications are not exposed to\n\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\nFor more information on securing devices, see the Supply chain, IoT, and OT security chapter of this report.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Protect Data and Devices with Intune Microsoft Docs|](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/)_\n\n_[Device compliance policies in Microsoft Intune - Azure Microsoft Docs|](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)_ _(4/29/2021)_\n\n_[What is Conditional Access in Azure Active Directory?

They were\n\nbuilt around legacy authentication mechanisms,\n\nkeeping them grounded within corporate networks.\n\nThese traditional architectures built for legacy apps\n\nwere designed for lateral connectivity rather than\n\nmicro segmentation. They violate the fundamental\n\nprinciple of least privilege access and are more\n\nvulnerable to lateral movement across the network\n\nby an adversary, which in turn could expose\n\n\nconfidential data.

All data is\n\nultimately accessed over network infrastructure.\n\n\nCustomers are using network segmentation for\n\norganizing workloads and deploying firewalls for\n\nsecuring traffic across subnets, VNETs, to on\npremises, and to the internet. Customers are using\n\nfirewalls to control and enhance visibility into all the\n\nnetwork flows.\n\n###### Web application firewall\n\nWeb application firewalls (WAFs) have evolved from\n\nan initial focus on injection-type attacks, such as\n\nSQL injection and cross-site scripting, to include\n\nattacks from malicious bots and API abuses. When\n\ncombined with distributed denial of service (DDoS)\n\nprotection, WAF forms an integral part of defense\nin-depth strategy for protecting web and API assets.\n\nWAF over the past year has upwards of 25 billion\n\nrules triggered on a per-week basis. Approximately\n\n4% to 5% of incoming traffic on average is deemed\n\nmalicious and is blocked either at the network edge\n\nor at the regional data center depending on where\n\nWAF is configured.\n\n\n###### Most common network attack types \n\nAzure Firewall blocks millions of attempted\n\nexploits daily. Our signals show that attackers\n\nmost commonly used malware, phishing, web\n\napplications, and mobile malware in their attempts\n\nat network attacks during July 2021. Also in\n\nJuly, there was a significant uptick in the use of\n\ncoinminers, a type of malware that uses the network\n\nto mine cryptocurrency.\n\nThe protocols leveraged most often in attacks were\n\nHTTP, TCP, and DNS, as they are open to the internet.\n\n###### Top 10 network threats (July 2021)\n\n\n###### Top 5 most common protocols used in network exploit attempts (July 2021)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Attack vectors, applications, and regions_**\n\n**_involved_**\n\nMore than 35% of the attack volume targeted\n\nHTTPS and 10% targeted HTTP. UDP attacks\n\nrepresented 43% of the overall attack vectors, with\n\namplification attacks accounting for 11% of attacks.\n\nBesides DNS and NTP reflection attacks, there has\n\nbeen a surge in remote desktop protocol (RDP) and\n\ndatagram transport layer security (DTLS) reflection\n\nattacks.\n\n###### DDoS attack type (July 2020 – June 2021)\n\n\n###### DDoS attacks\n\nIn our 2020 DDoS retrospective,[ Note 101 ] we highlighted\n\nshifts in the very active cyberthreat landscape. With\n\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in internet\n\ntraffic, DDoS attacks on internet-facing endpoints\n\nramped up significantly. We continue to see similar\n\ntrends in the first half of 2021 as well. The trend is\n\ncharacterized by large TCP attacks, mainly SYN, SYN\n\nACK, and ACK floods and user datagram protocol\n\n(UDP) reflection attacks. Online gaming and the\n\ngaming vertical continues to be a very attractive\n\ntarget of DDoS attacks. The majority of attacks on\n\nthe gaming vertical have been mutations of MIRAI\n\nbotnets and low-volume UDP protocol attacks.\n\n###### DDoS attack mitigations\n\n\nThere is also an uptick in DDoS attacks against IPv6\n\nthis year. This is an indication that as more IPv6 is\n\nadopted in the enterprise networks, the risk of DDoS\n\nattacks on IPv6 will continue to increase.\n\n**_Daily attacks and volume_**\n\nCompared to the latter part of 2020, the average\n\ndaily number of attack mitigations in the first half\n\nof 2021 increased by 25% while the average attack\n\nbandwidth per-public IP increased by 30%. Azure\n\nDDoS Protection mitigated 1,200 to 1,400 unique\n\nDDoS attacks every day in the first half of 2021. As\n\nof July 2021, the average attack size in 2021 (325\n\nGbps) was 25% larger than in 2020 (250 Gbps).\n\n\n**_Attack duration_**\n\nMicrosoft’s DDoS Protection team continues to see\n\nthat most attacks are of short duration, with 75.35%\n\nbeing 30 minutes or less and 87.60% being one hour\n\nor less.

UDP\n\nFragment attacks averaged 1145 bytes per packet\n\nwhile TCP invalid syn averaged 512 bytes. TCP attack\n\nvectors such as SYN ACK, TCP Zero Seq, FIN-ACK\n\nand RST Floods averaged below 100 bytes per packet.\n\nEurope, Asia, and the United States remain the most\n\nattacked regions because of the concentration of\n\nfinancial services and gaming industries in these\n\nregions.

(Loads are freshly infected devices\n\nwhich are sold to third parties, who install their\n\nmalware on the device.) Attackers have found\n\nmore effective strategies to monetize loads that\n\nare delivering more value than they would get\n\nusing them for DDoS attacks. These include\n\n###### Average price of DDoS attack services\n\n\nbuying loads to conduct ransomware, spyware,\n\nadware, and banking theft monetization\n\nstrategies.\n\n - Some antivirus products use outbound DDoS\n\nattacks to detect malware. Therefore, the\n\nlifecycle of the bots used in DDoS attacks is\n\nshorter than it used to be, requiring the DDoS\n\nservice to continuously buy new loads to\n\nmaintain their capabilities.\n\n - Improved DDoS mitigation strategies make it\n\nmore complex to perform quality attacks.\n\nIt has become more common for actors that want\n\nto conduct DDoS attacks to rely on these DDoS\n\nservices to conduct them. As a result, many attackers\n\nno longer have the skills or infrastructure to conduct\n\ntheir own DDoS attacks. In other words, costs are\n\nrising due to lack of alternatives.\n\n\nStarting in late June, the advertised cost of DDoS\n\nservices decreased back toward the equilibrium that\n\nwas observed until November 2020. This shift was\n\nlikely caused by two factors. First, there was a recent\n\nincrease in the supply of fresh loads available for\n\npurchase from the DDoS services. Second, there was\n\na decrease in ads for premium DDoS services. The\n\nmargins for DDoS services were being squeezed by\n\nincreased costs and lack of demand for high-priced\n\nDDoS services, leading some of the premium DDoS\n\nservices to move from a “publicly available service”\n\nin the cybercriminal forums to more private services\n\nthat don’t advertise.\n\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Sharing how Microsoft now secures its network with a](https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/blog/zero-trust-networking-at-microsoft-hinges-on-communication-collaboration-and-expert-knowledge/)_\n\n_[Zero Trust model - Inside Track Blog (4/22/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/blog/zero-trust-networking-at-microsoft-hinges-on-communication-collaboration-and-expert-knowledge/)_\n\n_[Zero Trust networking: Sharing lessons for leaders](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/zero-trust-networking-sharing-lessons-for-leaders)_\n\n_[(microsoft.com) (1/5/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/zero-trust-networking-sharing-lessons-for-leaders)_\n\n_[Lessons learned in engineering Zero Trust networking](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/lessons-learned-in-engineering-zero-trust-networking)_\n\n_[(microsoft.com) (1/5/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/lessons-learned-in-engineering-zero-trust-networking)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure represents a critical threat vector.\n\nIT and applications infrastructure, whether on\npremises, in the cloud, or multi-cloud, is defined as\n\nall the hardware (physical, virtual, containerized),\n\nsoftware (open source, first- and third-party,\n\nplatform as a service (PaaS), SaaS, functions, and\n\nAPIs), micro-services, networking infrastructure,\n\nand facilities that are required to develop, test,\n\ndeliver, monitor, control, or support IT services\n\nand applications. It is an area where Microsoft\n\nhas invested tremendous resources to develop a\n\ncomprehensive set of capabilities to secure future\n\ncloud and on-premises infrastructure.\n\n###### Collaboration with MITRE on an ATT&CK-style matrix\n\nThe flexibility and scalability of containers encourage\n\nmany developers to move their workloads to\n\nKubernetes, an open-source system for automating\n\ndeployment, scaling, and managing containerized\n\napplications. While Kubernetes has many\n\nadvantages, it also brings new security challenges\n\n\nthat should be considered. Therefore, it is crucial\n\nto understand the various security risks that exist\n\nin containerized environments, and specifically in\n\nKubernetes.\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base\n\nof known tactics and techniques that are involved\n\nin cyberattacks. Started with coverage for Windows\n\nand Linux, the matrices of MITRE ATT&CK cover\n\nthe various stages that are involved in cyberattacks\n\n(tactics) and elaborate the known methods in each\n\none of them (techniques). Those matrices help\n\norganizations understand the attack surface in their\n\nenvironments and make sure they have adequate\n\ndetections and mitigations to the various risks.\n\nWhen the Azure Security Center team began\n\nmapping the security landscape of Kubernetes, they\n\nnoticed that although the attack techniques are\n\ndifferent than those targeting Linux or Windows, the\n\ntactics are similar. For example, a translation from\n\nOS to container clusters would be “initial access to\n\nthe computer,” which becomes “initial access to the\n\ncluster.” So, the team created the first Kubernetes\n\nattack matrix: an ATT&CK-like matrix comprising\n\nthe major techniques that are relevant to container\n\norchestration security.\n\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[The evolution of a matrix: How ATT&CK for](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/21/the-evolution-of-a-matrix-how-attck-for-containers-was-built/)_\n\n_[Containers was built Microsoft Security Blog |](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/21/the-evolution-of-a-matrix-how-attck-for-containers-was-built/)_\n\n_(7/21/2021)_\n\n_[Threat matrix for Kubernetes (microsoft.com)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/02/attack-matrix-kubernetes/)_\n\n_(5/10/2021)_\n\n_[Secure containerized environments with updated](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/)_\n\n_[threat matrix for Kubernetes Microsoft Security Blog |](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/)_\n\n_(3/23/2021)_\n\n_[Crypto-Mining Attacks Targeting Kubernetes Clusters](https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/crypto-mining-attacks-targeting.html)_\n\n_[via Kubeflow Instances (6/9/2021)](https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/crypto-mining-attacks-targeting.html)_\n\n_[Update: Help Shape ATT&CK for Containers](https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/update-help-shape-att-ck-for-containers-bfcd24515df5)_\n\n_[(2/18/2021)](https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/update-help-shape-att-ck-for-containers-bfcd24515df5)_\n\n\n###### Threat matrix for cloud storage\n\nAs the move to the cloud enables a more secure\n\nhybrid workforce, organizations are also increasing\n\ntheir dependency on cloud storage services.

In a rapid data growth\n\nenvironment, it is not difficult to envision that data\n\ngovernance will increasingly have an impact on data\n\nsecurity.\n\nThere is a lot to be learned and reused from recent\n\nprivacy initiatives. Successful organizations with\n\nmature privacy processes have inherently had to\n\ncombine data governance and security to minimize\n\n\n###### Cumulative impact of unified data governance and security on sensitive data risk\n\n Data governance can maximize the business value of data while helping minimize the security and\n\n\ntheir privacy data footprint and surface of attack to\n\nachieve sustainable compliance. These security and\n\ncompliance benefits can also be achieved by using\n\nsimilar approaches with other sensitive or regulated\n\ndatasets.\n\nReducing the risk associated with data is not only\n\nabout pruning old data and securing it where it\n\nresides now. It is also about reevaluating how the\n\norganization conducts business with sensitive data\n\ngoing forward to ensure proper storage, access,\n\nflow, and lifecycle so that this sensitive data does\n\nnot persist or propagate uncontrollably.\n\nOver time, this means reengineering high-risk\n\nbusiness processes and adhering to data governance\n\n\nand security principles as organization evolve their\n\napplications and infrastructures or take on new\n\nbusiness ventures.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n_[Azure Purview for Unified Data Governance  |](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/purview/)_\n\n_[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/purview/)_\n\n\n_[Information Protection and Governance  |](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/compliance/information-protection)_\n\n_[Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/compliance/information-protection)_\n\n_[Microsoft Information Protection in Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection?view=o365-worldwide)_\n\n_[365 - Microsoft 365 Compliance Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection?view=o365-worldwide)_\n\n_(8/26/2021)_\n\n_[Microsoft Information Protection and Microsoft Azure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-information-protection-and-microsoft-azure-purview/ba-p/1957481)_\n\n_[Purview: Better Together - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-information-protection-and-microsoft-azure-purview/ba-p/1957481)_\n\n_(12/7/2020)_\n\n\n###### Information rights management use (July 2020 – June 2021)\n\n Dip in the chart correlates to decreased usage during major holidays\n\n\n-----\n\n##### People\n\nHelping people adapt to new ways of working\n\nis key to any successful transformation. While\n\norganizations are empowering people to work\n\nsecurely when, where, and how they want, we have\n\nfound the most successful are the ones who are also\n\nempathetic to the end-user experience.\n\nThe previous sections of this chapter have presented\n\na view of the threat landscape across the six\n\nfoundational pillars of Zero Trust, with key steps\n\nwe recommend taking to protect them. However,\n\nit is imperative to remember that every step we\n\ntake to implement Zero Trust strategies impacts the\n\npeople within the organization—and that successful\n\nimplementation depends as much on them as it\n\ndoes on the systems and tools we put in place. How\n\ncompanies engage with their workforces around\n\nremote work and security matters. We conclude\n\nthe chapter with a discussion about people, the\n\nhuman element of any enterprise, and ultimately our\n\ngreatest asset.\n\n\n###### Some guidance about insider risk in the hybrid workplace\n\nAs described in this report’s sections on Zero Trust, it\n\nis possible to give employees seamless information\n\naccess while mitigating the risk of inadvertent leaks.\n\nRegarding more malicious insider threats, using a\n\nframework of common factors and patterns typically\n\nseen helps to enable proactive detection. Microsoft’s\n\nInsider Risk program has adapted numerous\n\n###### Insider threat attack path[ Note 105 ]\n\n\npreventative and detective controls that decrease\n\nrisk through all stages of the insider threat attack\n\npath. In general, we should assume that the threat of\n\nloss to the organization or its stakeholders increases\n\nas an attack progresses down the path. Preventative\n\ncontrols such as awareness trainings that instruct the\n\norganization where to report insider threat concerns,\n\nor controls designed to limit risky behavior (such as\n\nlimiting the ability for those leaving the organization\n\n\nto share files) are both initiatives that Microsoft has\n\nundertaken to mitigate risk. As organizations work\n\ntoward increasingly advanced capabilities in the\n\npreventative control space, appropriate stakeholders\n\nfrom across the organization should always be\n\nconsulted. For example, before implementing any\n\npreventative controls, verify with the business that\n\nprotections still enable employees and contractors\n\nto perform their legitimate business activities.\n\n\n###### Insider threat attacks share several common factors and patterns, which can be described in a critical-path approach. Identifying indicators across phases of the critical path can help to enable more proactive detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Insider Risk program leverages a variety of\n\nartificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)\n\nand signature- or rule-based detections, including\n\nthose from our Insider Risk Management solution,\n\nto accomplish detection goals. While AI and ML are\n\nincredible tools that help to decrease some of the\n\nnoise associated with traditional rule-based alerts, it\n\nis critical that the organization has the appropriate\n\npeople with the “tribal knowledge” of business\nacceptable behavior in the correct roles to create\n\ntrustworthy AI and ML models. This human input\n\ntakes standard supervised or unsupervised ML a\n\nstep further in predicting which alerts are the most\n\nactionable for incident response teams. Lack of this\n\nknowledge can create a pool of noisy alerts with\n\nlimited investigative value.\n\n\n###### Key considerations for insider threat detections\n\n|AI and ML are not always the answer|Rules and signature-based detections are better suited for some use cases|\n|---|---|\n|Data is key|An effective AI or ML solution requires understanding and acquiring the data to develop, train, and enrich the solution, as well as track performance metrics|\n|You still need people|Human review of alerts and identification of tuning opportunities is critical – continue to “shift left”|\n|Cybersecurity talent pool is evolving|While security experts are still important, data scientists also bring valuable skills to the table|\n\n\n###### AI and ML are not always the answer\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The empathy imperative\n\nFlexible work is here to stay and with that comes\n\nseveral challenges and stressors. Teams have\n\nbecome more siloed this year, and digital exhaustion\n\nis a real and unsustainable threat. One in five global\n\nsurvey respondents say their employer doesn’t care\n\nabout their work-life balance.[ Note 106 ] Fifty-four percent\n\nfeel overworked. Thirty-nine percent feel exhausted.\n\nAnd trillions of productivity signals from Microsoft\n\n365 quantify the precise digital exhaustion workers\n\nare feeling.\n\n**A positive corporate culture mitigates risk**\n\nA recent study out of CyLab, Carnegie Mellon\n\nUniversity’s Security and Privacy Institute, found\n\nthat negative deterrence actions like employee\n\nconstraints, monitoring, and punishment don’t work\n\nto reduce insider risk.[ Note 107 ] What does work: putting\n\nemployee engagement, connection, and well-being\n\nfront and center.\n\n\nTo support the well-being of your people, it’s\n\nimportant to create channels and mechanisms to\n\nlisten to their concerns, providing an opportunity\n\nto give and receive feedback and embrace\n\ncollaboration. Taking a holistic, purpose-built\n\napproach that can pull signals together into a\n\ncohesive view across an organization provides a\n\nbetter understanding of the relevant trends in the\n\norganization and better risk reduction. For this\n\nreason, organizations are turning to ML to uncover\n\nhidden signs of workplace risk such as inappropriate\n\ncommunications, threatening behavior, or actions\n\nthat would negatively impact employees and the\n\nbusiness. By identifying patterns and violations,\n\ntechnology can flag risk while intervention is still\n\npossible, while continuing our commitment to end\nuser privacy.\n\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[To Thrive in Hybrid Work, Support Flexibility in Work](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/support-flexibility-in-work-styles)_\n\n_[Styles (microsoft.com) (9/9/2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/support-flexibility-in-work-styles)_\n\n_[Insider risk: Protect company data with insider](https://qz.com/2012393/insider-risk-management-starts-with-insider-goodwill/)_\n\n_[goodwill — Quartz (qz.com) (June 2021)](https://qz.com/2012393/insider-risk-management-starts-with-insider-goodwill/)_\n\n_[Data security: Eliminating insider risk in the hybrid](https://qz.com/1994450/heading-off-insider-risk-in-the-hybrid-workplace/)_\n\n_[workplace — Quartz (qz.com)](https://qz.com/1994450/heading-off-insider-risk-in-the-hybrid-workplace/)_\n\n_[Learn about insider risk management - Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management?view=o365-worldwide)_\n\n_[Compliance Microsoft Docs |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management?view=o365-worldwide)_ _(3/17/2021)_\n\n_[Reducing Code of Conduct and Regulatory](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/reducing-code-of-conduct-and-regulatory-compliance-violation/ba-p/2344661)_\n\n_[Compliance Violation Risks - Microsoft Tech](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/reducing-code-of-conduct-and-regulatory-compliance-violation/ba-p/2344661)_\n\n_[Community (5/12/2021)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/reducing-code-of-conduct-and-regulatory-compliance-violation/ba-p/2344661)_\n\n_[Fostering safe communication at work - The](https://www.washingtonpost.com/brand-studio/wp/2020/11/17/feature/fostering-safe-communication-at-work/)_\n\n_[Washington Post (11/17/2020)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/brand-studio/wp/2020/11/17/feature/fostering-safe-communication-at-work/)_\n\n_[Microsoft Customer Story-Avanade uses a light](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1348793491281744061-avanade-partner-professional-services-insider-risk-management)_\n\n_[touch—and Microsoft Insider Risk Management—](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1348793491281744061-avanade-partner-professional-services-insider-risk-management)_\n\n_[to lessen insider risk](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1348793491281744061-avanade-partner-professional-services-insider-risk-management)_ _(3/24/2021)_\n\n\n###### Assume positive intent; mistakes happen.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHAPTER 6\n\n## Disinformation\n\n###### Introduction\n\n Disinformation as an emerging threat\n\n Mitigation through media literacy\n\n Disinformation as an enterprise disruptor\n\n Campaign security and election integrity\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCTION:\n##### Critical attention required on the increasing sophistication and scope of disinformation\n\n###### ERIC HORVITZ, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER\n\n Disinformation refers to the deliberate use of false information with the intention of influencing public opinion. Efforts to fabricate falsehoods for the purposes of manipulating the masses have a long history. However, new forms of disinformation have come to the fore over the last decade, enabled by advances in computing methods and infrastructure that have transformed the power, scope, and efficiency of disinformation campaigns.\n\n Widely used consumer platforms and services, such as social media, creator platforms, search engines, and messaging services, now provide state and non-state actors with powerful channels for distributing disinformation. Beyond channels, these services provide malevolent actors with ready-made tools to experiment, monitor, iterate, and optimize the impact of disinformation campaigns.\n\n\nCommercial online platforms have been harnessed by\n\nthese actors as engines of disinformation to power\n\nmessaging programs aimed at political influence,\n\npolarization, and chaos. Disinformation strategies are\n\ngrowing in sophistication, including the concerted use of\n\nmultiple services[ Note 108 ] to reinforce messages across platforms.\n\nOn a second front, advances in machine learning (ML)\n\nand graphics have led to widely available tools for\n\nfabricating high-fidelity audiovisual content, referred\n\nto as synthetic media and deepfakes. For decades,\n\nphotos and comments by political leaders have been\n\n\nmanipulated or taken out of context in disinformation\n\nefforts, often with dramatic effects. However, technologies\n\nfor generating deepfakes are providing malevolent actors\n\nwith powerful, general palettes for fabricating behaviors\n\nand events. These methods are injecting new powers of\n\npersuasion into disinformation campaigns.\n\nIn a third area of concern, artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nmethods can be used by state and non-state actors to\n\nformulate and drive powerful psychological operations\n\nthat leverage insights and data about human\n\ncognition. ML and reasoning can be used to profile\n\n\nindividuals and groups and to generate personalized\n\nprograms of disinformation aimed at influencing\n\nbeliefs, opinions, and actions.\n\nThe repurposing of consumer computing\n\ninfrastructure, use of tools for generating synthetic\n\nmedia, and harnessing AI to guide psychological\n\noperations are troubling separately and in synergy.\n\nTogether, they are supercharging disinformation,\n\nwith grave implications for the health and vibrancy of\n\ndemocracies that depend critically on educated and\n\naware citizenries.\n\n\n###### THESE \n\n METHODS \n\n ARE INJECTING\n\n NEW POWERS OF\n\n PERSUASION INTO\n\n DISINFORMATION\n\n CAMPAIGNS.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat might we do in the face of these\n\ndevelopments?\n\nWe need to critically attend to the increasing\n\nsophistication and scope of disinformation—and to\n\nengage on multiple fronts. First and foremost, we\n\nneed to invest deeply in modern media literacy, to\n\neducate people about how to understand, expect,\n\nand recognize disinformation and misinformation.\n\nWork on media literacy extends beyond education\n\nand includes efforts to provide new kinds of tools\n\nthat can help people to critique the source and\n\nveracity of news and information. Second, we need\n\nto support high-quality journalism, including trusted\n\nnews organizations. It is essential to have committed\n\nreporters on the ground to see, hear, and report with\n\nclarity on events and incidents. In addition, we need\n\nto assure the health and vibrancy of local journalism.\n\nOn the technical front, there is promise in applying\n\nAI pattern recognition technologies to detect patterns\n\nof communications and content that reveal an intent\n\nto deceive. Such work includes efforts to identify\n\naudiovisual and text-based media as fabricated. On\n\nanother front, efforts in networking technologies\n\n\ncan be aimed at identifying primary locations\n\nand organizational sources of disinformation.\n\nFinally, there are promising developments with\n\ntechnologies that employ a set of methods, including\n\ncryptography, security, and database technologies in\n\nproduction tools and pipelines that serve to certify\n\nthe origin and history of edits to online media\n\ncontent, referred to as the provenance[ Note 109 ] of the\n\ncontent. Exciting progress with media provenance\n\nand authenticity is being nourished by strong cross\norganization collaborations.\n\nWe are facing unprecedented disinformation\n\ncampaigns and related cyber operations by state\n\nand non-state actors. These campaigns target public\n\nawareness and knowledge with disinformation, while\n\nothers target enterprise operations and confidence.\n\nIt is important to stay aware of developments and\n\nto come together to address the challenges with\n\nawareness, technologies, and policies. Addressing\n\nthe new and evolving challenges will take ongoing\n\ninvestments, innovation, and activity on multiple\n\nfronts. This important chapter reviews some\n\nof these challenges and provides insights on\n\ndirections forward.\n\n\n##### Disinformation as an emerging\n threat\n\nDisinformation has been a steadily evolving method\n\nof information warfare, most recognized in the\n\nUnited States after the 2016 election, but well\nknown globally since the Cold War. This approach\n\nis high-stakes and effective for creating social\n\ndiscord, increasing polarization, and in some cases,\n\ninfluencing the outcome of elections. Nation state\n\nactors with geopolitical aspirations, proponents\n\nof radical ideologies, violent extremists, and\n\neconomically motivated enterprises can manipulate\n\nonline narratives with easy and unprecedented reach\n\nand scale, creating significant societal impact.\n\n###### Mapping the problem\n\n\nThe general motive to spread disinformation is\n\nto damage the reputation of an entity, mislead\n\nconsumers about the information, or influence\n\nthe outcome of a proscribed event. It is one of the\n\ngreatest threats to democracy, open debate, and\n\nfree and modern society.\n\nCommodity cloud computing, open-source research,\n\nAI tools and algorithms, and the speed and scale of\n\nsocial media have created a perfect storm for the\n\nrise of disinformation and malicious synthetic media\n\npopularly dubbed deepfakes.[ Note 110 ] AI techniques to\n\ncreate hyper-realistic digital falsification, also known\n\nas deepfakes, include manipulated audio, video,\n\nimages, and text, which will seriously challenge\n\nour ability to discern truth from falsehood. In this\n\nreport, we use the term “deepfake” as AI-generated\n\nmanipulated media used for malicious purposes.\n\n\n_[Note 109 A promising step forward on disinformation – Microsoft On the Issues Note 110 Despite its popular usage, this term technically refers to a specific type of](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/22/deepfakes-disinformation-c2pa-origin-cai/)_\n\n_ML (a process by which exposure to large and diverse amounts of data allows a computer to improve its own performance) that uses layered neural_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the attention economy, websites and platforms\n\nearn revenue from the time users spend on\n\nthem. This advertisement-based business model\n\nincentivizes recommendation engines and curated\n\ntimelines with clickbait headlines and scandalous\n\nnews, opinions, and falsehoods. The timeline\n\ncuration algorithms give rise to creating echo\n\nchambers, filter bubbles, and unintentional tribalism.\n\nBecause of echo chambers and filter bubbles,\n\nusers predominantly see the content that matches\n\ntheir beliefs, biases, and desires, reinforcing their\n\nconfirmation bias and filtering out opposing\n\nviewpoints. Nefarious actors misuse the attention\n\neconomy and take advantage of the advertisement\n\nbusiness model to manipulate social media\n\nnarratives to create divisions and sow discord.\n\n###### “Filter bubbles” and “echo chamber”\n\n\n###### Parallels in cybersecurity\n\nCyberattacks compromise the confidentiality,\n\nintegrity, and availability of digital systems. The\n\ndifference between a disinformation attack and\n\na cyberattack is the target; disinformation is also\n\nan attack and compromise of our cognitive being.\n\nWhile cyberattacks are exploits of computer\n\ninfrastructure to create disruption, disinformation\n\nexploits human infrastructure (our inherent\n\ncognitive biases, logical fallacies, and psychological\n\nvulnerabilities), and the attack compromises logical,\n\nanalytical, and critical thinking.\n\nWe can therefore think of the threat posed by\n\ndisinformation and computational propaganda\n\nas cognitive hacking. A cognitive hack attempts\n\nto change the target audience’s thoughts and\n\nactions using disinformation to manipulate the way\n\nthey perceive reality. Nefarious actors accomplish\n\ncognitive hacks utilizing various techniques,\n\nincluding manipulating, mis-contextualizing, or\n\nmisappropriating information. Ultimately, these\n\nhacks can create social discord, exacerbate\n\n\npolarization, influence election outcomes, disrupt\n\ndemocratic principles, enable financial fraud, and\n\nthreaten life and property.\n\nBoth disinformation and cyberattacks are used by an\n\nadversary to achieve disruption. A well-coordinated\n\ndisinformation campaign can fill the broadcast\n\nand social channels with false information and\n\nnoise, creating narratives that play with emotions\n\nand drown out the true narrative. This maneuver\n\nis similar to a distributed denial of service (DDoS)\n\nattack that floods the target services and networks\n\nwith superfluous requests to connect and overload\n\nthe system to prevent legitimate requests from\n\nbeing fulfilled. Disinformation can also be used\n\nfor social engineering threats on a mass scale. Like\n\nphishing attacks to compromise IT systems for\n\ndata extraction, disinformation campaigns play on\n\nemotions, giving cybercriminals another feasible\n\nmethod for scams. Deepfake videos and audio\n\ncan trick employees into releasing or sharing login\n\ncredentials, which can then be used to gain access\n\nto an enterprise’s network.\n\n\n###### Deepfakes\n\nDeepfakes are photos, videos, or audio files\n\nmanipulated by AI in hard-to-detect ways. The\n\nweaponization of deepfakes can have a massive\n\nimpact on an economy and national security.\n\nBy eroding public trust in the media, deepfakes\n\nundermine the credibility of journalism. As this\n\ncredibility is eroded, deepfakes also give rise to the\n\n“Liar’s Dividend” phenomenon. In an environment\n\nwhere it is unclear what is real and what is fake, it\n\nbecomes easier to discount any inconvenient or\n\nunpopular truth as fake. As an example, deepfakes\n\ncould enable a public figure to claim that their real\n\nactions are just a fake.\n\nThe proliferation of deepfake technology can directly\n\nharm individuals. Deepfake pornography has been\n\nused to objectify and victimize people without\n\nconsent, especially women or those who identify\n\nas women. This revenge pornography is now a\n\nsignificant problem: over 96% of deepfake videos\n\n\n###### In the attention economy, users are increasingly exposed only to information that matches their preferences (blue areas in the graphic). Filter bubbles represent algorithms that choose content based on the user’s previous search histories and other online activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nare nonconsensual pornography.[ Note 111 ] A person’s\n\nreputation can be damaged beyond repair by a\n\nsingle deepfake video posted to social media.\n\nCriminals can and will take advantage of AI and\n\ndeepfakes to increase the effectiveness of scams\n\nand other nefarious activities. We have seen recent\n\nexamples of business[ Note 112 ] and romance[ Note 113 ] fraud using\n\naudio deepfakes. Even after effectively debunking\n\nthe deepfake, the damage remains. Deepfakes\n\nalso present direct threats to society. Nefarious\n\nnation state actors work around the clock to spread\n\ndisinformation campaigns, which increasingly\n\ninclude deepfakes, to create ideological conflicts in\n\ndemocracies around the world. They have effectively\n\nused disinformation and empowered domestic\n\nactors to disrupt elections and undermine efforts\n\nto contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology\n\ninnovations like replacing video codecs with deep\n\nneural networks are making it easier to create\n\ndeepfakes in live video calls.\n\nMicrosoft Research, in coordination with Microsoft’s\n\nResponsible AI team and the Microsoft AI, Ethics\n\nand Effects in Engineering and Research (AETHER)\n\nCommittee, continues to develop technology\n\nfor training and testing deepfake detection\n\ntechnologies.\n\n\n##### Mitigation through media literacy\n\nPew Center Research indicates that people are\n\nincreasingly concerned about their ability to\n\ndiscern false information and sift through the\n\nvolume of information they encounter in their daily\n\nlives.[ Note 114 ]Media literacy is one of the most effective\n\ntools available to improve individual resilience to\n\ndisinformation. From helping people understand\n\nminor editorial corrections, to preventing fake news\n\nfrom gaining traction, and reducing the likelihood\n\nthat foreign influences undermine an election, media\n\nliteracy inoculates individuals by helping them think\n\ncritically about information they encounter.\n\nEven a short intervention with media literacy\n\neducation has been shown to make a significant\n\ndifference in understanding disinformation,\n\nidentifying the motivations and context, and\n\nreducing belief in inauthentic content.[ Note 115 ] News\n\nmedia organizations, technology companies,\n\n\nuniversities, and social media companies have all\n\nstarted to implement media literacy efforts, which\n\ninclude resources such as labeling, contextualizing,\n\nproviding further reading or resources, and even\n\ngamified tools like online quizzes.\n\nImproving media literacy is vital to addressing\n\ndisinformation. Interventions should be contextualized\n\nand tailored to the audience, starting from a young age\n\nwith curriculum for responsible digital citizenship\n\nincorporated into standard civics education. Some\n\nUS states, most notably Florida and Ohio, have\n\nalready started piloting and developing media\n\nliteracy curriculum in classrooms.[ Note 116 ] In Finland, when\n\nthe country was targeted with foreign influence\n\noperations and disinformation campaigns by Russia\n\n###### Approaches to countering disinformation\n\n\nin 2014, the government introduced multi-platform\n\ninformation literacy and strong critical thinking as a\n\ncore component of a national curriculum.[ Note 117 ]\n\nMedia literacy curriculum should help individuals\n\nunderstand information they encounter, evaluate\n\nthe plausibility, verify the source and search for\n\nother reputable sources on the topic, and interpret\n\ncontext. In today’s online world with essentially\n\nlimitless information available, these skills may\n\nnot be intuitive, but are certainly ones that can be\n\nlearned and sharpened over time. Further, media\n\nliteracy education does not need to be confined to\n\nthe classroom: these skills are universally relevant,\n\nespecially for digital nonnatives, or anyone who\n\nregularly consumes news and information online.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft has and continues to develop media\n\nliteracy resources to help consumers discern\n\ninformation. Ahead of the US 2020 elections, we\n\nreleased two online quizzes, “Spot the Deepfake”[ Note 118 ]\n\nand “Know My News,”[ Note 119 ] aimed at raising\n\nawareness about synthetic media technology and\n\nunderstanding news sources. It also released a\n\n“VaxFacts Quiz”[ Note 120 ] to heighten awareness around\n\nCOVID-19 misinformation as vaccines were\n\nbecoming more widely available. Microsoft has\n\nalso developed a hybrid threat training curriculum\n\nthat highlights how threat actors are increasingly\n\nusing cybersecurity and disinformation attacks in\n\ntandem to accomplish their goals. These training\n\nmodules have been customized for the political\n\ncommunity, including political campaigns, parties,\n\nand government entities, as well as for journalists\n\nand human rights organizations.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[An update on our effort to help preserve and protect](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/06/16/microsoft-journalism-initiative-pilots-update/)_\n\n_[journalism – Microsoft On the Issues (6/16/2021)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/06/16/microsoft-journalism-initiative-pilots-update/)_\n\n\n##### Disinformation\n as an enterprise disruptor\n\nDisinformation traverses a social diffusion chain\n\ncomprised of both intentional and unsuspecting\n\nagents. Intentional actors include hackers,\n\ndisruptors, and other agents that generate or\n\npropagate disinformation. These agents could\n\ninclude nation states targeting a society, industry,\n\nor social arena. They could also include agents\n\nengaged in corporate counter-espionage activities\n\nor anti-competitive disruption. Unintentional agents\n\nmight include personnel, vendors and suppliers,\n\nother partners and stakeholders, customers, and\n\neven competitors that continue the propagation\n\nof disinformation, often not realizing what they\n\nare doing. They concurrently become victims and\n\nunsuspecting agents of disinformation. Through\n\nthese agents and other means of information\n\ndissemination, a parallel and concurrent wave of\n\ndisinformation traverses or envelops the enterprise.\n\nThis wave can be simple and anticipated, like\n\nthe rise of a tide, or it can have the effect of an\n\nunpredictable tsunami about to weigh down on\n\nan unsuspecting coastal village. In this case, the\n\ncoastal village would be the enterprise information\n\n\ncommunity. Like its disruptive effect on social\n\ndiscourse, such disinformation carries with it the\n\npotential to disrupt corporate decision making,\n\ncreate commercial confusion and discord, and sow\n\ndoubts in the minds of employees, customers, and\n\nmarkets. The following three areas cover some of\n\nthe more common considerations that enterprises\n\ncould prioritize to ensure preparedness to mitigate\n\nthe disruptive effect of disinformation.\n\n**1. Parallel to its effect through social media,**\n\n**disinformation has made its way into**\n\n**enterprise workflows that are dependent**\n\n**on data collection, aggregation, and**\n\n**distribution practices. These workflows and**\n\ndata practices may be automated or manual\n\nin nature, and even more advanced practices,\n\nsuch as those leveraging AI capabilities, are\n\nprone to breach. Sophisticated AI algorithms\n\ncan be fooled, or their underlying models\n\noverwhelmed by excess disinformation and\n\nother types of information attacks, leading\n\nto erroneous or anomalous insights and\n\noutcomes. In general, automated practices\n\nface the threat of breach and corruption in\n\nthe absence of adequate detection, timely\n\nnotification, isolation and eviction, and defense\n\nin depth. In contrast, manual practices, such\n\nas copy/paste, swivel chair (entering data into\n\none system and then entering the same data\n\n\ninto another system), screen-scraping, and\n\naggregation of public information through\n\nhuman evaluation and automated means, are also\n\nprone to disruption, corruption, or nuanced\n\nmodification. To address this growing threat,\n\nenterprise decision makers should evaluate\n\nwhich of the enterprise’s critical information\n\ngathering and distribution processes could\n\nbenefit from more resilient practices. Which\n\ninflection points, or points where information\n\nis interchanged or interpreted, need more\n\nrigor, controls, or other forms of checks and\n\nbalances? Based on this analysis, controls and\n\neven out-of-band crosschecks and validations\n\nshould be introduced to mitigate the threat of\n\npolluted or mischaracterized information that could\n\npotentially corrupt the data stream and subsequent\n\ninsights that are derived from the data.\n\n**2. Signals and data within the enterprise**\n\n**could be compromised through security**\n\n**vulnerabilities or attacks and infused**\n\n**with disinformation. Instrumentation and**\n\nthreat signals for performance of enterprise\n\nresilience are often seen as having secondary\n\nimportance and are therefore not given the\n\nlevel of scrutiny that core or primary services or\n\napplications receive. Data and signal collection\n\nare sometimes relegated to supporting\n\napplications and systems that are bolted on as\n\n\n-----\n\nadjunct environments. Attackers and disruptors\n\nknow this and strike where they believe\n\nweaknesses could exist. Their primary areas of\n\nreconnaissance include operational security\n\nand control systems alongside discovery\n\nof code and configuration vulnerabilities,\n\nespecially within secondary or supporting\n\nsystems. Successful attacks could disrupt\n\nthreat signals, or infuse misleading data, if\n\nthey are able to bypass intrusion detection.\n\nEnterprise decision makers should reevaluate\n\nthe scope and security of their protected\n\nassets and associated instrumentation and\n\nsignals and ensure that intrusion detection\n\nperimeters around core or critical assets have\n\nbeen set to encompass these areas as well.\n\nThis review includes evaluation of controls\n\nthat measure the effectiveness of network\n\nsegmentation, validate adherence to data\n\nand signal classification schema, inbound\n\nand outbound traffic features and patterns,\n\nclassification of data and dependencies, and\n\ninstrumentation that ensures data integrity\n\nas it traverses across systems, at rest and in\n\nbackups. Instrumentation and signals that\n\nevaluate and indicate the performance of\n\ncritical systems should be cataloged and put\n\nthrough a security and operational review\n\nfor vulnerabilities and possible causes of\n\ncompromise and injection of disinformation.\n\n\n**3. Situational intelligence could be supplanted**\n\n**with disinformation or nuanced in ways to**\n\n**generate bias or create doubt in the minds**\n\n**of decision makers or front-line personnel.**\n\nSituational intelligence includes threat\n\nintelligence, crisis intelligence, disaster data,\n\nand other types of information that helps to\n\nincrease an enterprise’s understanding of\n\nan operating or competitive environment.\n\nOne of the key strategies of disruptors is\n\nto supplant situational intelligence with\n\ndisinformation. This strategy is often deployed\n\nin environments that are considered out-of\nband or beyond the control and reach of the\n\nenterprise, including social and other media\n\nplatforms, public sites and portals, and other\n\ntypes of campaigns that could target the\n\nenterprise or its complex and myriad supply\n\nchains. Disruptors sometimes generate so\n\nmuch out-of-band disinformation that it\n\noverwhelms facts and otherwise accurate\n\ndata. Their disruption tactics go beyond\n\nthe enterprise and its direct information,\n\nextending often to suppliers and third-party\n\naffiliates. Their goal is to introduce doubt in\n\nthe minds of decision makers and/or front-line\n\npersonnel. Disinformation that could disrupt\n\nsuppliers, logistics, deliveries, orders, and\n\nfulfillment poses threats to the supply chain and\n\nconfidence in product and resource availability.\n\n\nThe impact of diminished confidence could\n\ndrive higher pricing and impact production\n\ncosts. Doubt in the enterprise’s ability to\n\nmaintain a grip on prices, supplies, and\n\nsuppliers could exacerbate disruption and\n\nforce accelerated timelines or induce imprecise\n\nor incorrect decisions. Alternatively, it could\n\nintroduce latency or doubt in decisions, such\n\nas recovery, failover, or fallback. Disruptors\n\ncould also try to diminish front-line confidence\n\nin leadership by corroding confidence or by\n\npresenting false or inaccurate information\n\nand leading or trailing indicators. Enterprises\n\nthat are dependent on external sources of\n\nintelligence for critical functions need to be\n\nvigilant about information they ingest or\n\nconsume. Information gatherers and decision\n\nmakers need to validate sources and have\n\nmeans of cross-checking intelligence. Rating\n\nsystems and schema should be used, and the\n\nveracity and provenance of the intelligence\n\nneeds to be confirmed independently.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recommendations: Four-point plan for enterprise executives\n\nAs enterprises develop and mature their capabilities\n\nto respond to information disruption and\n\ndisinformation, there are new imperatives that are\n\nemerging in the areas of security controls, threat\n\nclassification, and analysis. To support and enhance\n\nthe enterprise’s ability to improve its response,\n\nprioritize mitigations to address the highest risks,\n\nand to make investments that propel or accelerate\n\nits corporate objectives, the following practices\n\ncould be leveraged as a starting point to develop\n\nsustainable mitigations and improvements to\n\ncounter the effects of information disruption and\n\ndisinformation.\n\n**1. Catalog enterprise exposures to disruption,**\n\n**manipulation, and disinformation.**\n\nEnterprises should begin with the arduous task of\n\ncataloging or keeping track of disinformation attacks\n\non their information systems and data. This catalog\n\nwould be an addition to the catalog of threats and\n\nattacks that are part of enterprise security controls.\n\n - Include a classification of information\n\nmanipulation and disinformation with clear\n\nindicators of targeted outcomes and impact of\n\nthe attacks.\n\n - Note the sources of the attacks or information\n\nleading to their origins and motivation, if\n\nknown.\n\n\n\n - Categorize and record the content that was\n\nmanipulated or introduced so that patterns can\n\nbe determined or detected.\n\n - Determine the means of propagation and\n\ndiffusion through the enterprise.\n\n - Identify characteristics of actors and agents to\n\nthe best ability that is available at the time.\n\n - Conduct candid and objective identification of\n\ncorporate functions, processes, and systems\n\nthat consumed or were impacted by the\n\ndisinformation.\n\nThe net impact of the disruption or information\n\ninfiltration must be evaluated and eventually\n\nincluded in considerations of corporate liability.\n\n**2. Assess the impact of manipulation or**\n\n**disinformation.**\n\nAn emerging area for enterprise management and\n\nhuman resources is to conduct impact analyses of\n\ndisruption and disinformation. Managers and human\n\nresource departments should study the behavior\n\nof enterprise employees, partners, and customers\n\nas they reacted to disruption or interacted with\n\ndisinformation. Security and data science teams\n\nshould run A/B tests on AI and trained algorithms to\n\nensure they have not been corrupted or their models\n\ntampered with. Finance teams and economists could\n\nlook at the costs of disruption, including opportunity\n\ncost, and the liabilities associated with impact of\n\nmarket confidence, revenue, growth, and operational\n\ncost increases associated with disinformation.\n\n\n**3. Quantify the consequences of disruption.**\n\nBy examining dependency maps of data flow,\n\nanalysis, and the points at which humans and\n\nsystems were impacted, enterprise leadership\n\ncan estimate or calculate the consequences and\n\ncollateral damage caused by disinformation and\n\ndisruption. The goal of such an examination is to\n\nquantify the blast radius of any potential disruption\n\nand assess its severity on enterprise operations,\n\nfunctions, and reputation. The likelihood and\n\nimpact of such disruption should be used to inform\n\ninvestment in mitigations and controls and help\n\nprioritize safeguards that need to be implemented\n\nto give the enterprise the most appropriate\n\ndefense against the impacts of disruption and\n\ndisinformation.\n\n**4. Assess privacy implications of disruption.**\n\nDisinformation and information disruption\n\ncampaigns sometimes attack or threaten customer\n\nand other protected data, which can have significant\n\nprivacy implications for enterprises. Primary sources\n\nor stores of such data are difficult targets as they are\n\nkept deep inside the defensive network of controls,\n\nintrusion detection, and layers of authentication and\n\nauthorization. Modern enterprise controls include\n\nZero Trust approaches and tightly controlled or\n\nrestricted access to data that is subject to privacy\n\nregulations, controls, and guidelines. Sovereign\n\nrules and obligations might also apply. It is under\n\nsuch constraints and restrictions that enterprises\n\nare expected to provide data resiliency, including\n\n\nhot and cold backups, or active-active models of\n\nredundancy or concurrency. Information disruptors\n\nand attackers aggressively search for backup\n\nfacilities, dormant data stores, or unattended data\n\nand data services that are slated to be deprecated.\n\nWhen they find a weakness in security controls,\n\nnot only do they threaten breach of data but their\n\nactions can also trigger potentially impactful privacy\n\nincidents. Enterprise privacy and security teams must\n\ntake a closer look at controls, including security\n\nmeasures, encryption at rest and in transit, of\n\nprimary data sources and any backups or alternate\n\ndata stores. Gaps in these environments and\n\ncontrols must be reported to enterprise leadership\n\nand prioritized to be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Campaign security and election integrity\n\nThreats to democratic processes from cyber-enabled\n\ninterference are a critical concern. Microsoft has\n\nshut down dozens of websites widely attributed to\n\nnation state actors that have been used to target\n\nelected officials and candidates, democracy-promotion\n\norganizations, activists, and the press. We’ve also seen\n\nattempts by nation states to target and exploit key\n\nbuilding blocks of democratic systems, including voting\n\nsystems and political campaigns. We also endured the\n\ncalculated manipulation of social media platforms in\n\nefforts to sow misinformation and disinformation.\n\nThe Defending Democracy Program at Microsoft\n\nwas created to advance technology, increase cyber\n\nresilience, and engage with government, campaigns,\n\nand democratic stakeholders to address threats\n\nto democratic processes from cyber-enabled\n\ninterference. In partnership with the rest of the\n\nMicrosoft Security community, the Defending\n\nDemocracy team has helped protect two major US\n\nelections and dozens of national elections around\n\nthe globe. This unique and important issue space\n\nraises an interesting set of cybersecurity insights,\n\nchallenges, and solutions that we must address to\n\nensure that our democratic institutions remain secure.\n\n\n###### Unique cybersecurity challenges in political campaign security\n\nThe structure and lifecycle of political campaigns\n\npresent unique cybersecurity challenges. Campaign\n\norganizations comprised of a mixture of staff,\n\nvolunteers, and consultants are often created and\n\nexpanded rapidly once an individual declares their\n\ncandidacy. As a result, team members are often asked\n\nto use their own personal devices, including cell\n\nphones or laptops, throughout the campaign. Further,\n\nwith constrained budgets and limited IT expertise,\n\ndecisions about which email and file sharing provider\n\nto use are more likely tied to personal preference\n\nthan extensive security and risk evaluations. With\n\npeople regularly joining and leaving a campaign and\n\nutilizing a variety of personal devices to conduct\n\ncampaign business, it becomes difficult to manage\n\nand enforce strong cybersecurity practices.\n\nThese realities expose political campaigns to\n\nsignificant cybersecurity threats, compounded further\n\nby the asymmetric advantage that malicious actors\n\nmaintain in terms of sophistication, resources, and\n\ncapacity. Political campaigns are high-value, high\nvisibility targets, but may have as few as one person\n\ndedicated to cybersecurity for the organization.\n\nIt is critically important that we in the security\n\ncommunity continue to raise awareness of\n\ncybersecurity issues and best practices within\n\n\npolitical campaigns. This can be as simple as\n\nestablishing strong communication channels\n\nbetween campaign staff and the private sector to\n\nensure they have a point of contact if issues arise.\n\nIt is also imperative for candidates to establish a\n\nculture of cybersecurity within their campaigns, not\n\njust among the IT staff but inclusive of everyone\n\nwho interacts with the campaign. Relatively easy\n\nactions such as turning on multifactor authentication\n\n(MFA), utilizing a password manager for strong\n\nunique passwords, and using secure communication\n\nchannels for campaign communications make a\n\ntremendous difference in improving the resilience of\n\nthe entire organization.\n\nMicrosoft has developed a service to address the\n\nchallenges associated with campaign staff using\n\npersonal devices and accounts for campaign\n\nbusiness. Microsoft AccountGuard[ Note 121 ] is a security\n\nservice that unifies threat detection and notification\n\nacross all accounts, and is available at no cost to\n\ncampaigns utilizing Microsoft 365 products. When\n\na campaign enrolls in AccountGuard, they can also\n\nextend coverage to anyone who interacts with\n\nthe campaign, including staff, volunteers, interns,\n\nconsultants, and more. The service then provides\n\nnotification and remediation guidance in the event\n\nof a nation state threat or compromise on campaign\nrelated accounts. The service currently protects over\n\n40,000 accounts for political customers, including\n\npolitical campaigns, political parties, technology\n\nvendors, and elections departments.\n\n\nHeading into the US 2020 Presidential election cycle,\n\nthe AccountGuard program also offered enhanced\n\nidentity protection features and resiliency reviews\n\nto customers involved in the election. Organizations\n\nthat took advantage of these resources saw an\n\naverage increase of 18% to their Microsoft Secure\n\nScore. In addition to political customers, the service\n\nis available to other high-risk groups including\n\nhuman rights organizations, journalists and media\n\norganizations, and healthcare organizations.\n\n###### AccountGuard distribution\n\n AccountGuard is currently available in 32 democracies around the world.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Expanding AccountGuard protections for high-risk](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/09/accountguard-expansion-high-risk-defending-democracy/)_\n\n_[customers in 31 democracies – Microsoft On the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/09/accountguard-expansion-high-risk-defending-democracy/)_\n\n_[Issues (3/9/2021)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/09/accountguard-expansion-high-risk-defending-democracy/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threats to election infrastructure\n\nAs the Microsoft security community partners across\n\nthe public and private sectors to secure election\n\ninfrastructure, the differences between how cloud\n\nand on-premises systems are used in elections\n\nbecomes clear, as well as the various types of\n\nelection technologies that must be secured. We form\n\nour threat models around three main categories of\n\nsystems, each with unique security considerations\n\nand risk profiles.\n\nGlobally, voting systems are statutorily required to\n\nbe always disconnected from the internet and are\n\neffectively “air gapped” systems. Though this poses\n\ncertain challenges for maintenance and updating\n\ndevices, it acts as an extremely effective mitigation\n\n\nagainst remote threat actors. Though some form of\n\nconnected or online voting systems are starting to rise\n\nin popularity, they remain in the minority of systems.\n\n**Securing election systems**\n\n**UPDATES AND PATCHING**\n\nThe primary recommendations for elections\n\nofficials and private vendors who support elections\n\nIT is to have a comprehensive strategy to patch\n\nsystems regularly and keep software up to date,\n\nand to use MFA. This is particularly relevant to\n\nany internet-connected systems, such as election\n\nsupport technologies and back-office IT systems.\n\nDuring the lead-up to the 2020 US election cycle,\n\nthe ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472[ Note 122]) was\n\nannounced, less than three months before the\n\n\nelection. This event served as a good reminder that\n\nvulnerabilities can be announced at inopportune\n\nmoments, and the security of an environment relies\n\non the ability to apply patches rapidly. Customers\n\nwho were using cloud infrastructure were secured\n\nagainst this vulnerability significantly faster—often\n\nautomatically and immediately—than those running\n\non-premises servers that needed to be patched.\n\n**SHARED SERVICES**\n\nUnlike a private sector company that is typically in\n\ncharge of their entire IT estate, local governments\n\ntend to share IT systems with their state, regional,\n\nand national-level counterparts. Although this can\n\nbe cost effective and beneficial from a management\n\nperspective, it spreads out the risk of cyber intrusion\n\nfrom an unrelated government organization into an\n\nelections department. For example, if a research lab\n\nat a state-run university were compromised, because\n\nof shared IT systems attackers could move laterally\n\nto attack a county election’s voter information\n\nportal. Furthermore, responsibility for maintenance\n\nand security is often split between private service\n\nproviders and local governments. Sharing services\n\nhighlights the need for network segmentation\n\nwherever possible to limit the impact of a cyber\n\nincident that either starts within or could migrate to\n\nan elections organization.\n\n\n###### There are many connected components of an election beyond just casting a ballot at the polls—from data integrity concerns, to disinformation, to protecting election officials’ online identities.\n\n While many of these things may be invisible to the average voter, each offers a potential pathway for an adversary to attack the integrity of an election.\n\n|Voting systems|• Vote casting systems (electronic ballot marking devices, “voting machines”) • Vote tabulation devices (paper ballot scanners)|\n|---|---|\n|Connected election support systems|• Voter registration databases • Election-night results reporting sites • ePollbooks (voter check-in tablets) • Information portals • Not regulated, connected to the internet, shared ownership Highest risk|\n|Election back- office IT|• Voter information portals • Day-to-day workstations and server infrastructure • Email and files|\n\n\n-----\n\n**SMALL TEAMS AND SMALL BUDGETS**\n\nIn some countries, including the United States,\n\nelections are not managed federally; each\n\nmunicipality is responsible for running and\n\nmanaging its own elections infrastructure. The\n\nasymmetric threat of advanced adversaries\n\ntargeting local-level elections offices that are time\n\nand resource constrained is of real concern. As\n\ndiscussed earlier in this report, advanced persistent\n\nthreat actors have IT knowledge and monetary\n\nresources that exceed the annual budgets of local\n\nmunicipalities. Therefore, steps must be taken by\n\nboth the private and public sector to concentrate\n\ncybersecurity talent and resources in a way that\n\nhelps to offset and balance that asymmetry.\n\nTo help elections organizations address these\n\nconcerns, the Defending Democracy team focuses\n\nheavily on securing and supporting customers using\n\ncloud services to support their elections, in both the\n\nprivate and public sectors. Our goal is to use the\n\ncybersecurity expertise at Microsoft to offset the\n\nasymmetric threats faced by local elections or small\n\nelections vendors.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Keeping your vote safe and secure: A story from inside](https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/06/22/keeping-your-vote-safe-and-secure-a-story-from-inside-the-2020-election/)_\n\n_[the 2020 election – On the Issues (microsoft.com)](https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/06/22/keeping-your-vote-safe-and-secure-a-story-from-inside-the-2020-election/)_\n\n_[Protecting political campaigns from hacking –](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/05/06/protecting-political-campaigns-from-hacking/)_\n\n_[Microsoft On the Issues (5/06/2019)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/05/06/protecting-political-campaigns-from-hacking/)_\n\n\n###### Election integrity\n\nTo address growing concerns in voter trust among\n\nelection systems, and to help drive forward\n\nprinciples of software independence, election\n\nauditability, and security and cryptography,\n\nMicrosoft has developed and launched a project\n\ncalled ElectionGuard. Microsoft ElectionGuard\n\nis a free open-source software development kit\n\ndesigned to make voting systems more secure,\n\nauditable, verifiable, and efficient. This is done by\n\nimplementing principles of end-to-end verifiability\n\nand answers the question: How can I trust the\n\n_accuracy of an election outcome if I worry that the_\n\n_software, hardware, transmission infrastructure, or_\n\n_personnel responsible for conducting the election_\n\n_could be untrustworthy?_\n\nUnlike banking software or other high-security\n\nindustries, secret ballot elections require that an\n\nindividual’s data (votes) must be a secret to all\n\nparties, and there can be no direct tie between\n\na person’s identity and their vote, other than the\n\nacknowledgment that a voter has cast a ballot.\n\nElectionGuard implements these end-to-end\n\nverifiable features:\n\n - Enables every individual to verify that their\n\nvote is included in the final election tally,\n\nwith a unique verification code.\n\n - Ensures that no one specific individual’s vote\n\ncan be revealed.\n\n\n\n - Cryptography guarantees that no votes can\n\nbe changed after being cast without being\n\ndetectable.\n\n - Ensures that no one specific individual’s vote\n\ncan be revealed.\n\n - Provides assurances that the system is recording\n\nvotes properly and not “changing votes.”\n\n - Allows interested third-party watchdog\n\norganizations to verify that the tally was\n\nsummed properly, and that the system\n\noperated without errors.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[LinkedIn post: What is ElectionGuard?

The\n\nmain objective of any countermeasure is to mitigate\n\nthe negative societal impact of disinformation.\n\nSpecifically, when it comes to malicious synthetic\n\nmedia, the approach must be twofold: (1) to reduce\n\nthe exposure to malicious deepfakes, and (2) to\n\nminimize the damage it can inflict.\n\nMedia literacy efforts can be enhanced to cultivate\n\na discerning public. Deepfakes will have a limited\n\nadverse impact if media consumers use logical\n\nthinking and common sense to differentiate\n\nbetween fiction and reality. Deepfakes have such\n\na potentially devastating impact because many\n\nindividuals assume that a video, a photograph, or\n\nan audio is real if it aligns with their preconceptions\n\nand biases. Alternatively, often people believe it’s\n\nfabricated if it contradicts their beliefs.\n\nWe need meaningful regulations and appropriate\n\nlaws to govern disinformation and deepfakes so\n\nthat, at the very least, the perpetrators are held\n\naccountable. Without legislation and legal remedies,\n\npeople are vulnerable to disinformation campaigns\n\nand deepfake revenge pornography, fraud, and\n\nother harms. Of course, legislation must take a\n\nbalanced approach toward freedom of expression\n\nand speech\n\n\n###### We’re not saying ElectionGuard makes it impossible to hack voting machines; we’re saying ElectionGuard makes it pointless to hack voting machines.\n\n\nshould not exist in a vacuum, and independent\n\nsecurity researchers should be able to validate\n\nthe integrity of the software. To that end, we\n\nhave implemented a bug bounty program where\n\nMicrosoft will award the security community for\n\nfinding vulnerabilities in the ElectionGuard software.\n\nSince launching in October 2019, the program has\n\nawarded tens of thousands of dollars in bounties to\n\nresearchers across multiple continents. In this way,\n\nsecurity issues were discovered and responsibly\n\nreported by the community, all patches were\n\nissued within 90 days of reporting, and potentially\n\nvulnerable code was never used by voters in\n\nproduction election systems. Public trust in elections\n\nis, in part, dependent on the independent auditability\n\nof the systems and processes that support our\n\nelections.

Through these interactions, we’ve learned a lot about the role that cybersecurity plays in helping organizations maintain business continuity as we adapt to a hybrid work world. As a result, we anticipate five cybersecurity paradigm shifts that will support the evolution of work in a way that centers on the inclusivity of people and data.\n\n\n**1. The rise of digital empathy**\n\nWhen we consider building security into the\n\nproductivity experience, there can be a tendency\n\nto focus on security from purely a technology\n\nperspective. However, during times of constant\n\ndisruption and change, when people are\n\nsusceptible to increased stress reactions, the\n\nimportance of digital empathy comes into\n\ngreater focus. Digital empathy involves thinking\n\nabout the ways in which people behave and\n\nengage with technology. In this way, sociology\n\nand humanities considerations are essential to\n\nthe evolution of technology and cybersecurity.\n\nEmpathy isn’t just for in-person interactions.\n\nBy applying empathy to digital solutions, we\n\ncan make these solutions more inclusive. In\n\ncybersecurity, that means building tools that\n\naccommodate more diversity with respect to\n\n\npeople and their ever-changing circumstances,\n\ntheir diverse perspectives, and varied abilities.\n\nFor example, rather than requiring people to\n\ndo unnatural things to engage with security,\n\nwhich can also increase their likelihood of\n\ngetting distracted when busy, factoring in\n\ndigital empathy leads to inclusion of security\n\nprofessionals with a broader range of abilities,\n\nskill sets, and perspectives—for greater diversity\n\nand effectiveness of cybersecurity solutions.\n\nIt also means developing technology that can\n\nforgive mistakes.\n\nDigital empathy will be critical to how we\n\nmove forward as an industry. Whether it’s an\n\norganization—or an individual—our ability to be\n\nempathetic will help us to understand and adapt\n\nduring times of constant change.\n\n\n**2. The Zero Trust journey is becoming**\n\n**increasingly important**\n\nZero Trust is an “assume breach” security\n\nposture[ Note 124 ] that treats each step across the\n\nnetwork and each request for access to resources\n\nas a unique risk to be evaluated and verified. This\n\nmodel starts with strong identity authentication\n\neverywhere. Multifactor authentication (MFA)—\n\nwhich we know prevents 99% of credential\n\ntheft[ Note 125]—and other intelligent authentication\n\nmethods[ Note 126 ] make accessing apps easier and more\n\nsecure than traditional passwords.\n\nAs we look past the pandemic to a time when\n\nworkforces and budgets rebound, Zero Trust\n\nwill become the biggest area of investment for\n\ncybersecurity. This means that right now, every\n\none of us is on a Zero Trust journey—whether\n\nwe know it or not.\n\n\n###### WE KNOW A\n\n COMPREHENSIVE\n\n APPROACH TO\n\n OPERATIONAL\n\n RESILIENCE MUST INCLUDE CYBER\n\n RESILIENCE.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Summary of report learnings\n\nWhat became clear as we compiled this report is\n\nhow much technology is now baked into everything\n\nwe do. We can’t afford to treat technology and cyber\n\nrisk as something separate and contained that IT\n\nand security teams are left to manage on their own.\n\nThe examples in this report show that criminals will\n\nseek to exploit whatever technology we develop\n\nand introduce; the challenge is in understanding\n\nwhat form that will take. Because we can’t always\n\npredict how technology will be exploited, we need\n\nto assume that anything we create or use will be\n\na potential target and prepare ourselves to be as\n\nresilient as possible.\n\nThe key actionable learning from all the elements\n\nof this report is that to minimize impact of attacks\n\nwe must truly practice good cyber hygiene,\n\nimplement architectures that support the principles\n\nof Zero Trust, and ensure cyber risk management is\n\nintegrated into every aspect of the business.\n\nThe following section summarizes some of the key\n\nlearnings reinforced by the findings and insights in\n\nthe report.\n\n\n**3. Diversity of data matters**\n\nMicrosoft tracks more than 24 trillion daily\n\nsignals from a diverse set of products, services,\n\nand feeds around the globe. We were able\n\nto identify new COVID-19-themed threats—\n\nsometimes in a fraction of a second—before\n\nthey reached customers. This is just one\n\nexample of how the power and scale of the\n\ncloud has a clear advantage when it comes to\n\ncombating threats.\n\nAs one example, in the last year, the diversity of\n\ndata also allowed us to understand COVID-19\nthemed attacks in a broader context. Microsoft\n\ncyber defenders determined that adversaries\n\nwere primarily adding new pandemic-themed\n\nlures to familiar malware.[ Note 127 ]\n\n**4. The resiliency of a business is tied to its**\n\n**cyber resilience**\n\nCyberattacks are increasing in frequency\n\nand sophistication and are deliberately\n\ntargeting core business systems to maximize\n\nthe impact of the attack or likelihood of a\n\nransomware payout. With this context, we\n\nknow a comprehensive approach to operational\n\nresilience must include cyber resilience.[ Note 128 ] At\n\nMicrosoft, we benefit from a strategy that\n\nfocuses on four basic threat scenarios: Planful\n\nevents such as weather incidents, unplanned\n\n\nevents such as earthquakes, legal events such\n\nas cyberattacks, and pandemics like COVID-19.\n\nCloud technology helps organizations develop\n\na comprehensive cyber-resilience strategy\n\nand makes preparing for a wide range of\n\ncontingencies less complicated due to its\n\nscalability.\n\n**5. A greater focus on integrated security**\n\nThe first half of 2021 brought into stark reality\n\nthe agility and callousness of our adversaries.\n\nTo uncover shifting attacker techniques\n\nand stop them before they do real damage,\n\norganizations must be able to see across their\n\napps, endpoints, network, and users. Facing a\n\nnew economic reality, organizations will also be\n\ndriven to reduce costs by adopting more of the\n\nsecurity capabilities built into their cloud and\n\nproductivity platforms of choice. To maximize\n\nthe effectiveness of security organizations,\n\ntools must be fully integrated to improve\n\nefficacy and provide end-to-end visibility.\n\nWhile digital acceleration will continue to influence\n\nthe paradigm shifts that shape our industry, one\n\nthing remains the same; security technology is\n\nfundamentally about improving productivity and\n\ncollaboration through secure and inclusive user\n\nexperiences.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The cybersecurity bell curve:\n\n Basic security hygiene still protects against 98% of attacks\n\n\n###### Enable multifactor authentication\n\nMake it harder for bad actors to utilize\n\nstolen or phished credentials by\n\nenabling multifactor authentication.\n\nAlways authenticate and authorize\n\nbased on all available data points,\n\nincluding user identity, location, device\n\nhealth, service or workload, data\n\nclassification, and anomalies.\n\n\n###### The cybersecurity bell curve:\n\n Basic security hygiene still protects against 98% of attacks\n\n\n###### Apply least privilege access\n\nPrevent attackers from spreading\n\nacross the network by applying least\n\nprivilege access principles, which limits\n\nuser access with just-in-time and just\nenough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based\n\nadaptive polices, and data protection to\n\nhelp secure both data and productivity.\n\n\n###### Keep up to date\n\nMitigate the risk of software vulnerabilities\n\nby ensuring your organization’s devices,\n\ninfrastructure, and applications are kept\n\nup to date and correctly configured.\n\nEndpoint management solutions allow\n\npolicies to be pushed to machines\n\nfor correct configuration and ensure\n\nsystems are running the latest versions.\n\n\n###### Utilize antimalware\n\nStop malware attacks from executing\n\nby installing and enabling antimalware\n\nsolutions on endpoints and devices.\n\nUtilize cloud-connected antimalware\n\nservices for the most current and\n\naccurate detection capabilities.\n\n\n###### Protect data\n\nKnow where your sensitive data is\n\nstored and who has access. Implement\n\ninformation protection best practices\n\nsuch as applying sensitivity labels and\n\ndata loss prevention policies. If a breach\n\ndoes occur, it’s critical that security\n\nteams know where the most sensitive\n\ndata is stored and accessed.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cyber hygiene\n\nTaking basic security precautions can help\n\nyour organization prepare for and mitigate the\n\noverwhelming majority of modern cyber threats\n\nand helps to prepare for the evolution of threats\n\nas technology advances. The “cybersecurity bell\n\ncurve” shows the activities that will have the biggest\n\nimpact on reducing threats. Some of those actions,\n\nthe impact they have, and recommendations for\n\nimplementing them are described here.\n\n**Enable multifactor authentication**\n\nThis continues to be the top recommendation as it\n\nwas last year. MFA can stop credential-based attacks\n\ndead in their tracks. Without access to the additional\n\nfactor, the attacker can’t access the account or\n\nprotected resource. The introduction of passwordless\n\ntechnology and architectures makes this easier for\n\nemployees and customers to use and also provides\n\nmore security than traditional text (SMS) or voice\n\napproaches. MFA should be enabled on all accounts\n\nthat support it, in a way that it is easy for all users\n\nto use it. It’s also important to ensure that people\n\nunderstand that they should not approve an MFA\n\nrequest unless they were trying to log in or access a\n\nsystem—many people automatically click to approve\n\nany pop-up that they receive. Digital empathy can\n\nbe useful in understanding this behavior and helping\n\nto nudge people toward less risky decisions.\n\n\n**Apply least privilege access and secure the most**\n\n**sensitive and privileged credentials**\n\nWhen attackers breach an organization, they look\n\nfor privileged credentials to provide them with\n\naccess to sensitive information and systems. In\n\naddition to using MFA to protect login to an identity\n\nand ensuring that they have least privilege to access\n\nsystems, the credentials that support that identity\n\nand provide access must be secured. Among other\n\nthings, this will help to minimize the impact and\n\nbreadth of pass-the-hash-style attacks in the event\n\nthat malicious code is already running on a local\n\nmachine or network. This includes securing hardware\n\nsuch as with a trusted platform module or hardware\n\nsecurity module or using cloud authentication\n\nservices that provide credential protection.\n\nSeparate accounts should be used for privileged\n\naccess versus general internet and email access.\n\nDedicated hardened workstations should be used\n\nfor privileged accounts and to perform privileged\n\ntasks to prevent the chances of infection through\n\ngeneral internet activity and email. Using JIT/JEA\n\nsystems ensure they will only get exactly the rights\n\nneeded to perform a task and only for as long as\n\nneeded to undertake it. This should be combined\n\nwith risk-based adaptive policies that deny access to\n\nresources when there is any doubt over the hygiene\n\nof the account or device.\n\n\n**Secure and manage devices (keep up to date)**\n\nAn essential part of good cyber hygiene is\n\nensuring that devices are kept up to date and\n\nconfigured correctly. Use endpoint management\n\nsoftware to enforce policies that ensure the correct\n\nconfiguration settings are deployed and that\n\nsystems are running the latest software. Wherever\n\npossible, take an evergreen approach to ensure all\n\ndevices are constantly running the latest version\n\nof software. This includes ensuring a means of\n\nupdating every piece of software or application so\n\nthat there are no dependencies that prevent you\n\nfrom implementing the latest updates and patches.\n\nFor those devices missing critical patches, restrict\n\nthem from accessing sensitive resources.\n\nThe same approach should be taken for cloud\n\nservices, using cloud security posture management\n\nto ensure that systems are configured correctly.\n\nKeeping software and systems up to date can be\n\neasier in the cloud where update domains enable\n\nmigration to updated infrastructure for testing with\n\nthe option to roll back easily if issues occur.\n\nFor systems, such as OT, where updating software is\n\nnot as easy, a strong inventory of systems is needed\n\nto understand which equipment exists, and how\n\nvulnerable it may be to certain attacks. Incorporate\n\nadd-on modules or replace hardware to ensure it\n\nachieves all seven properties of secured devices.\n\n\nIn systems where this is not possible, the\n\nenvironment should then be protected from other\n\nsystems and monitored to detect any unexpected\n\ntraffic or attempts to compromise the systems.\n\n**Use antimalware and workload protection tools**\n\nAntimalware and detection and response technologies\n\nshould be deployed across the ecosystem to prevent\n\nattacks and provide warning of any anomalies\n\nor threats that may be attempting to breach the\n\nenvironment. This includes OT and IoT environments.\n\nFor cloud systems, workload protection should be\n\ndeployed across all systems from virtual machines\n\nand containers to machine learning (ML) algorithms,\n\ndatabases, and applications.\n\n**Protect data**\n\nGood cyber hygiene as outlined in the previous\n\nfour steps can protect data, but it is also important\n\nthat organizations know which sensitive data they\n\nhave, and ensure that they have appropriate steps in\n\nplace to protect it. In fact, there is often a regulatory\n\nrequirement to do so. The General Data Protection\n\nRegulation (GDPR), for example, requires a risk\nbased approach to protecting the data of residents\n\nof the European Economic Area (EEA). To take a\n\nrisk-based approach it is important to know your\n\ndata—to understand what is sensitive and what may\n\nbe subject to regulatory requirements. While there\n\nhave been standards for data governance and data\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Integrate cybersecurity into business decision making\n\nNow that technology is an essential element of\n\nbusiness operations—a process that has only been\n\naccelerated over the last 18 months—cybersecurity\n\nmust be a factor in overall business decision\n\nmaking and not just something that is left to the\n\ntechnology department.\n\n###### Treat cyber as a business risk\n\nCybersecurity should no longer be viewed as a\n\nspecialized risk that falls only within the purview\n\nof the IT department. Technology expertise sits\n\nin the IT department, just as expertise in financial\n\nrisk management generally resides in the finance\n\ndepartment, but ultimate responsibility and\n\n###### Cybersecurity’s role in digital transformation\n\n\nprotection for over 30 years, many organizations\n\nhave struggled to implement them. As we move\n\ninto a world where we increasingly collaborate and\n\nshare data, it’s important to ensure we understand\n\nwhat data we have, classify it accurately, and apply\n\nsensitivity labels as appropriate. This practice will\n\nenable us to use information protection and data\n\nloss prevention technologies to protect data with\n\nmore confidence.\n\nIn the event of a breach, these practices can also\n\nhelp security teams to know where the most sensitive\n\ndata is and whether it was exposed to attackers.\n\n###### Adopt Zero Trust principles\n\nThis report has highlighted the sophistication and\n\ncomplexity of many of the attacks we are seeing and\n\nwhy it is increasingly difficult to prepare to counter\n\nthese attacks. Zero Trust is important to reduce the\n\nexposure of sensitive data by limiting the inherent\n\ntrust within an organization that an attacker would\n\nexploit—especially when people are connecting\n\nfrom everywhere and will not necessarily be coming\n\nfrom a “trusted” location. This is why adopting a\n\nZero Trust approach is now a top priority for most\n\norganizations. In a world where it’s harder to predict\n\nor prevent the attacker, it’s important to assume they\n\nwill get in and limit their exposure.\n\n\n###### Isolate legacy systems\n\nNot every system is capable of running the tools to\n\nenable Zero Trust. For example, many operational\n\ntechnology (OT) systems have long technology\n\nlifecycles and may run operating systems and\n\nsoftware that can’t be updated.\n\nNetwork segmentation should be used to restrict\n\naccess to these systems. This can help to ensure\n\nthat operational technology is not exposed to the\n\nrisks from hybrid working, and that IoT devices and\n\nsensors have access and connections only to the\n\nsmart ecosystems they support.\n\nThis means that rather than trying to run the\n\nmodern and legacy alongside each other, we can\n\nisolate these systems from exposure to the risks\n\nthat come from a modern connected infrastructure\n\nand avoid having that legacy technology hold back\n\nmodern architectures. It also allows monitoring of\n\nthe environment that hosts operational technology\n\nand Internet of Things (IoT) devices to be highly\n\nfocused on detecting and responding to unusual\n\nactivity in an environment where it may not be\n\npossible to install software on the system.\n\n\naccountability for the risks lie within the business\n\nfunction. As the chapters in this report illustrate,\n\naddressing the threats that we face require a mix of\n\ntechnology, policy, and people expertise—as does\n\nall business decision making.\n\nEvery leader in the organization should consider\n\nhow they enable employees and customers to have\n\na better digital experience, while also considering\n\nwhat’s needed to mitigate the associated risks. This\n\nincludes consulting the cybersecurity team on how\n\nto manage the risks that arise as they undergo\n\ndigital transformation. As this report shows, there\n\nare inherent risks in all the new technologies and\n\nbusiness practices we adopt, and those risks must\n\nfactor into any decisions about technology, policy, or\n\nbusiness practices.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Use digital empathy in implementing security controls\n\nAs we connect more and more systems together,\n\nsecurity can become more complex, but we need\n\nto ensure that we value diversity of skills, areas of\n\nexpertise, work and learning style, and background,\n\namong other things. Do not expect or require\n\neveryone to be technology experts, in the traditional\n\nsense of the term, in order to engage with the\n\nsecurity of these systems.\n\nWhen you implement security controls, apply\n\ndigital empathy to ensure that the controls you are\n\nproviding consider the environment in which those\n\nusing the system are working and allow them to\n\neasily engage with the environment. For example:\n\n**Invest in user training that educates and informs.**\n\nImplement security training that helps employees\n\nunderstand the risks they face and the best way they\n\ncan help to protect the organization. This training\n\nshould be ongoing and designed in a way that\n\nincreases engagement. User training is not just a\n\ncompliance activity but an essential part of the early\n\ndetection and response to an attack. Ensure that the\n\ntraining you provide explains risks in the context of\n\nthe employees’ work, and provide the context and\n\n\ntools they need to understand appropriate behavior,\n\nrecognize attacks, and report unusual activity. A\n\nculture of enablement, trust, and engagement will\n\nsignificantly improve reporting and provide earlier\n\nwarning of attacks.\n\n**Build security into productivity.**\n\nWhen you implement security controls, think about\n\nthe impact on the experience of those using it,\n\nwhether employees or customers. What is their\n\nbackground, expertise, and cultural experience?\n\nAny controls you put in place should consider\n\nthe experience of those who do not have a\n\nbackground in technology. Is it intuitive, can it be\n\nunderstood, and does it fit into their workflow as\n\nnaturally as possible? Too much friction without\n\nan understanding of why a control is in place can\n\nlead people to circumvent technology or ignore\n\nprocesses to get things done.\n\nIf, in addition to training people, we ensure that\n\nsecurity fits into their working practices rather than\n\nthose of a technology or cybersecurity professional,\n\nwe increase the chance of their understanding the\n\nrisks and taking the appropriate actions. Where\n\npossible, cybersecurity should be invisible to the\n\nuser except where it can help nudge them to take\n\nappropriate actions to manage risk.\n\n\nSecurity decision makers should truly embrace a\n\nrisk management mindset as they consider how the\n\nsteps they take can protect the organization, while\n\nalso helping achieve operational goals.\n\n###### Resilience includes cybersecurity\n\nIn the connected world we live in today we need\n\nto consider resilience as a key success factor in\n\neverything we do. Digital transformation is bringing\n\nincreasing complexity to our security solutions\n\nincluding greater collaboration with third parties and\n\nthe expectation that systems will be available 24x7.\n\nThe platforms we are building to support businesses\n\nneed to be fully resilient against attacks.\n\nCybersecurity and resilience should be considered\n\ntogether. Operational resilience planning should\n\ninclude understanding the cybersecurity threats to\n\nthe system and making appropriate investment to\n\nensure continued success.\n\nIt is crucial to implement strong backup and\n\nrecovery solutions, but it is equally important that\n\norganizations plan for how operational decisions will\n\nbe made in the event of a cyberattack and practice\n\ntheir crisis management and response as well as\n\ntheir technical response to incidents.\n\n\n###### Build a third-party risk program\n\nPartners, suppliers, and contractors interact with\n\ndata and applications connected to our corporate\n\nenvironment all the time. Attackers are increasingly\n\ntargeting third-party providers to gain access to\n\ntheir systems and networks with a view to gaining\n\naccess to their customers.\n\nEnsure that the organization has a strong supply\n\nchain assurance process, built on an understanding\n\nof your suppliers’ exposure to cyberattacks, how\n\nthey configure their systems to be secure, and what\n\nsteps they take to protect any information you share\n\nwith them. Ensure that you are managing your third\nparty risk through robust service-level agreements,\n\nattestations, and shared assessments like SSAE 18\n\nSOC 1 and SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and ISO 20001.\n\nThird-party access to systems should also follow\n\nthe Zero Trust principles you apply to your own\n\norganization to limit exposure to attacks originating\n\nfrom a compromise of their systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nAs technology becomes more integral to our society,\n\nattackers are increasingly seeking to exploit this\n\ncultural shift. From cybercriminals to nation state\n\ngroups, these are sophisticated and well-researched\n\norganizations with the resources, investments, and\n\nresearch to deploy complex and well-informed attacks\n\nagainst an organization. They are professional\n\nenterprises with their own sophisticated supply chains\n\nand their own well-researched, well-engineered lures\n\nthat seek to exploit the way your organization works.\n\nAs we increasingly do more of our work online, so do\n\ncriminals and nation state attackers. You must take\n\nthis realization into consideration as you plan digital\n\nactivities. For any new venture, consider the threat\n\nalongside the opportunity, and think about how you\n\ncan manage risk for your entire organization.\n\nThis kind of thinking will require fundamental\n\nchanges in the way we operate. We must consider\n\nrisk as a whole and across the organization, rather\n\nthan within siloes or individual viewpoints. We must\n\nlook at where we need to change the way we work,\n\nand where we need to do the things we are already\n\ndoing—but better.\n\n\n\n- **Zero Trust is an architectural principle.**\n\nThe threats we have seen underline the\n\nimportance of Zero Trust in designing and\n\nmanaging the risk in an organization. The last\n\nyear has emphasized why there should be no\n\nsuch thing as a trusted application, trusted user,\n\nor trusted device with unrestricted access. The\n\nrisk and context of every connection needs\n\nto be considered before allowing access to\n\nresources. Zero Trust is not a technology but an\n\napproach to managing risk. When implemented\n\nproperly, it can enable us to unlock the\n\npotential of modern technology while limiting\n\nour exposure in a hyperconnected world.\n\n\nA number of key themes arise throughout the\n\ndifferent sections of this report that we encourage\n\nyou to consider as you think about improving your\n\nsecurity posture:\n\n  - **Do the basics well.**\n\nA running theme throughout many of the\n\nchapters is that, although attackers are\n\nbecoming more sophisticated, good cyber\n\nhygiene and implementation of basic security\n\nmeasures is often the best way to disrupt,\n\nprevent, and detect their attacks.\n\n  - **Take a holistic view.**\n\nToo often the way we organize security and risk\n\nis driven by our own organizational structure\n\nand siloes. Attackers will look for vulnerabilities\n\nacross these siloes, so we need to consider risk\n\nand the best approach to mitigating risk at an\n\norganizational level. This may require some\n\nstandardization or translation of approaches\n\nacross the different teams in an organization.\n\nIt also underlines the importance of standards\n\nas we seek to harmonize between companies,\n\nwhich is increasingly important to managing\n\nsupply chain risk.\n\n\n\n- **Any element can be used as an attack vector.**\n\nAttackers will look for the weakest link across\n\nan organization’s ecosystem, so we must\n\nmanage it holistically. The weakest link may be\n\na connected freezer or building management\n\nsystem that is used to gain access to the\n\ncorporate network, or it may be a user or device\n\nthat is compromised via a phishing email in\n\nan attempt to gain access to the operational\n\ntechnology running a factory or production\n\nplant. We need to consider and manage the\n\norganization’s entire attack surface.\n\n- **Think about people.**\n\nPeople engage with technology and can be\n\nused as a way of gaining access to the digital\n\nenvironment. Think about how to engage with\n\nthem in a way that will help them to understand\n\nthe risks they face. Understanding, engaging,\n\nand educating people will allow them to\n\nbecome a key line of defense against modern\n\nthreats, whether that is misinformation seeking\n\nto influence peoples’ decisions and undermine\n\ndemocracy or phishing emails seeking to gain\n\naccess to and compromise an organization’s\n\ndigital assets.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Contributing teams at Microsoft\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Contributing teams at Microsoft\n\n###### The insights in this report, as well as the actionable learnings above, have been provided by a diverse group of security-focused individuals, working across dozens of different teams at Microsoft.
