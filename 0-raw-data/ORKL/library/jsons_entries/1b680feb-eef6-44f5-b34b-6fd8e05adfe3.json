This blog post might useful for security engineers,\nresearchers, and security analysts to catch up with current cybersecurity issues specifically\nmalware threats and APT hunting. By the end of this blog post, readers will understand the\ninner working of this recent malware attack that happened to the compromised user via a\nmalicious RTF document. Furthermore, security analysts can collect the given IOCs\nextracted from the malware to check whether your environment has been compromised or\nnot.\n\n## Introduction\n\nOn 30 March 2022, the Netbytesec team come across a tweet from Shadow Chaser Group\n(@ShadowChasing1) which is well known as one of the groups focused on APT hunt and\nanalysis. The researcher from the Shadow Chaser Group claimed that they found an\ninteresting RTF sample which Netbytesec team believes the samples are linked to Malaysia\nas the name and content of the RTF samples containing Cyber Security Malaysia's acronym\nname, CyberGuru logo, and Malaysia Ministry of Communications and Multimedia's emblem.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Shadow Chaser Group's tweet about the RTF sample\n\nNetbytesec team collected all the IOCs from Twitter's thread of the tweet and retrieve the\nsamples from VirusTotal for our further analysis.\n\n## Indicator of Compromises\n\n### MD5 Hashes\n\n1.

All collected\nRTF samples used remote template injection techniques to abuse the template function of\nRTF to load malicious template documents containing malicious VBA code from a remote\nserver. The malicious macro in the template then will load another Word document from the\nserver that contains two PE files object which will be used by the macro to drop malicious\nEXE and DLL which does the C2 connection capability to the attacker server resulting in the\ncompromise of a victim machine. The infected machine will consistently load the executable\nduring startup as the malware will create a persistent mechanism via registry once the\nexecutable is executed for the first time. This behavior will ensure the connection to the C2\nserver whenever the victim starts their machine from a shutdown state.\n\nFigure: Flow of Malware\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nIn this technical analysis, the Netbytesec team was able to retrieve those samples that were\nbeing uploaded to VirusTotal and Any.Run. Netbytesec team then conduct RTF analysis,\nmalicious macro analysis and reverse engineering on the samples.\n\n\n-----\n\n### RTF analysis\n\nThe Netbytesec team started the analysis by opening the RTF to observe the behavior of the\nRTF sample. Upon opening one of the RTF samples, Microsoft Word will try to fetch a\ntemplate as the Word's ribbon shows that the software tries to open a remote template from\na URL \"https://mckeaguee[.]com\". The figure below shows the document trying to retrieve a\nremote template from the internet.\n\nFigure 5: Word try to load template injection\n\nObserving this behavior, the Netbytesec team assumes that the malware author uses RTF\ntemplate injection as we have researched this technique last year which can be referred\n[here for an explanation of this new emerging technique.](https://notes.netbytesec.com/2021/06/rtf-template-injection.html)\n\nBelow the figure, our analyst grep keyword \"template\" from all the RTF samples to display\nthe template injection URLs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Using grep command to find template injection location\n\nHence, we confirmed that this RTF implements the RTF template injection technique on the\nsamples.\n\n### Malicious macro and malicious Inline shape\n\nAfter the RTF load the remote template, the document will automatically execute the\nmalicious macro code embedded inside which led to the execution of an executable named\n\"GoogleDesktop.exe\". In the figure below, we put comments to explain what the line of codes\ndoes.\n\nFigure 7: Malicious macro code\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, the code will determine the temp file path into variable ckal that will be used to save an\nEXE file and a DLL file. In line 13, we can see that the macro will retrieve a document from\nURL https://mckeaguee.com/training and replace the document with the currently opened\ndocument.\n\nAfter doing that, at line 21, the embedded macro gets the EXE file (inline shape) contained in\nthe newly replaced document and checks whether the AlternativeText contains strings \".ex\"\nto identify the existence of the file. It then copies the file into the temp folder with the filename\nthat the malware author put in AltBox of the inline shape. The same goes for line 28 for the\nDLL copy activity.\n\nAt the last line of the malicious code, the macro will execute the EXE file which led to the\nDLL loading of the GoogleServices.DLL which does the malicious behavior.\n\nIn the figure below, we can see that the malware author put the Inline shape object above the\nemblem.\n\nFigure 8: Inline Shape object\n\n\n-----\n\n### Inside the GoogleDesktop.exe\n\nInspecting the import functions of the executable reveals that the application will call\n_GoogleServices_1 function from GoogleServices.dll._\n\nFigure 9: Imports functions\n\nIf we look down at the address 0x4010D9, the malware invokes the malicious function\n_GoogleServices_1 to start the infection._\n\nFigure 10: GoogleDesktop.exe invokes the malicious function\n\nIn the next few sections, we will focus on DLL functionality where most of the malicious\nbehavior is done by the DLL.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malicious DLL export functions\n\nNetbytesec team first determines the DLL's export to dig down the interesting and malicious\nfunctions that reside in the PE file.\n\nFigure 11: The DLL containing an export\n\nIn the GoogleServices_1 export, it contains two sub-function which are malicious_function\nwhich was renamed by our analyst, and the ExitProcess function. Note that our analyst has\nrebased the program in the IDA Pro to follow their x32dbg offset. The address might differ\nfrom yours.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: GoogleServices_1 function\n\nIn the \"malicious_function\" function (0x74881CB0), the function basically will create a\nregistry key, decode the WinAPI function name in runtime and then connect to their\ncommand and control server.\n\n### Resolve Windows API function names\n\nThe malware author uses a function routine that our analyst renamed\n\"wrap_function_resolve_runtime\" to resolve a lot of Windows API functions name during\nruntime. For example, the figure below shows the function \"wrap_function_resolve_runtime\"\n(0x736F1BD4) was used to resolve the \"LoadLibraryA\" name before the malware called\n_LoadLibraryA (0x736F1BF0) function to load wininet.dll during the runtime._\n\nFigure 13: Resolving WinAPI function names\n\n\n-----\n\nIf we track down the reference call of this \"wrap_function_resolve_runtime\" function, the\nmalware makes a lot of calls for this function to resolve several Windows API function name.\n\nFigure 14: Cross references of function \"wrap_function_resolve_runtime\"\n\nDigging down to see the inner code of the function will give us hints that the malware author\nuses PEB structure to get all the loaded module lists, their base address, and exported\nfunction addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Decompiled version of \"wrap_function_resolve_runtime\" function\n\nIn this method, malware can simply get all the loaded module lists, their base address, and\nexported function addresses by using PEB information. The malware will be able to parse\nPEB information to read the image base of required modules, calculate the export addresses\nand make the call to the address instead of calling GetProcAddress and LoadLibrary to get\nthe address of a Windows API. As a result, malware can remain stealthier at some level\nbecause suspicious functions like GetProcAddress are not being called.\n\n### Create registry as persistent mechanism\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the _malicious_function (0x74881CB0) function, the malware first will call a sub-function_\nthat will do a creation of registry key for the persistent mechanism as you can see at address\n0x74881BFB in the figure below.\n\nFigure 16: Function create_registry being call\n\nDrilling down the function, the malware first will open the corresponding Registry key which is\n\"Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" using RegOpenKeyExA by calling the\n_EAX value at address 0x748813A1 shown in figure below._\n\nFigure 17: Registry key being open using RegOpenKeyExA\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the malware will get the current module file name which is GoogleDesktop.exe to be\nuse to set the value in the next function call.\n\nFigure 18: GetModuleFileName being use to retrieve GoogleDesktop.exe path\n\nAfter, retrieve the GoogleDesktop.exe path, the malware will generate a string \"Google\n_Notification\" that intend to be used as the Registry name in the mentioned Registry._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: The sample generate a string to be use as Registry name\n\nFinally, using the RegSetValueExW function, the malware will set the value of\nthe CurrentVersion\\Run registry to perform the persistent mechanism in the victim's machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: The malware will set the value according to its parameter of\n\nRegSetValueExW\n\nIf we check the victim's CurrentVersion\\Run registry, supposedly we can find the registry\nname \"Google notification\" like in the figure below.\n\nFigure 20: Creation of Google Notification registry key\n\n### Decrypt domain name and user-agent strings\n\nBefore creating and setting up a Command and control connection, the malware first will take\na chunk of encrypted data stored in the executable and decrypt it with XOR key 0x9D to\ngenerate the C2 domain name and user-agent string.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21: Buffer containing encrypted data\n\nIf we observe the memory dump of the destination of decrypted data, we can see the clear\ntext of the decrypted domain name and user-agent string that will be used for the C2\nconnection in the next phase.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22: Decrypted data\n\n### Generate URL path\n\nThe malware also will generate random strings to be used as the URL path when making a\nconnection with the attacker's C2 server. The figure below shows the function that will return\nand save the random string that is to be appended to the URL as the URL path.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23: Function routine use to create random string for URL path\n\nThe loop will generate arbitrary characters as the random string.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Command and Control connection\n\nUpon decrypting the domain name and generating random characters for the URL path, the\nmalware will then invoke a function that will be used to create the C2 connection at the end\nof the function \"malicious_function\".\n\nFigure 24: C2 Connection function being call\n\nAs we see in the first activity of the \"malicious_function\" function, the function previously\nused LoadLibraryA to load the WinInet library. The lifecycle for the WinInet to be used as a\nC2 connection is pretty simple.\n\nAs shown in the figure below, it will start to initialize the library by calling InternetOpenA with\nthe decrypted user agent string \"Mozilla/5.0\" user-agent as lpszAgent parameter.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25: InternetOpenA being call\n\nUsing the decrypted domain name as parameter lpszServerName of InternetConnectA, the\nmalware initiates the connection by opening an HTTP session for the given site where the\n_ESI value contains InternetOpenA handle._\n\nFigure 26: InternetConnectA\n\nAfter that, the sample builds an HTTP request handle with the HttpOpenRequestA function\nalong with HttpSendRequestA to send the HTTP Request shown in figure 27 and figure 28.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27: HttpOpenRequestA\n\nFigure 28: HttpSendRequestA\n\nLastly, the sample will pass the handle to InternetReadFile to read the actual data which\nprobably means that the specimen is reading the response of the GET request to the URL\ndomain mclartyc[.]com.\n\nIn our case here, the domain mclartyc[.]com has been resolved to the loopback address\n127.0.0.1 by the attacker. Hence, deep analysis on behavior of the C2 interaction with\ncompromised machine cannot be done.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29: Attacker's DNS resolved to 127.0.0.1\n\nBased on VirusTotal, the resolved IP address of the domain would be 139.177.184.80.\n\nFigure 30: mclartyc[.]com IP Address\n\nBy the end of the malicious function, the program will call the sleep function before it loops to\nthe previous generate URL path strings function and create a C2 connection back.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 31: Call sleep function\n\n### Malicious DLL summary\n\nThe DLL's main activities are as follows:\n\n1. Resolve a lot of function names during runtime\n2. Create registry name \"Google notification\" with the value of GoogleDesktop's path\n3. Decrypt C2 domain and user-agent strings\n4. Generate random URL path strings\n5. Create connection to C2 server (Domain already resolved to 127.0.0.1)\n6. Sleep\n7. Repeat step 4\n\n### Overall behavior scenario\n\n1. Victim open RTF document\n2. RTF load remote template from hxxps://mckeaguee[.]com/\n3. Microsoft Word .doc (template) file contains malicious macro loaded\n4. Macro executed\n5. Retrieve another doc file contains malicious inline shape (EXE and DLL)\n6. EXE and DLL dropped\n7. EXE execute and DLL will be load\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNetbytesec team believes the samples are linked to Malaysia as the name and content of the\nRTF samples containing Cyber Security Malaysia's acronym name, CyberGuru logo, and\nMalaysia Ministry of Communications and Multimedia's emblem. The sample also can be\nspeculated that the malware was crafted by our own local Malaysian threat actor or might be\nfrom an outsider or it might come from red team operator out there. The attacker takes\nadvantage of the RTF template ability to leverage RTF remote template injection to load\nmalicious templates in the runtime. Even though the potentially dropped DLL has a unique\nway to resolve a lot of Windows API functions names during the runtime, the malicious\n\n\n-----\n\nsoftware have simple malicious behavior and characteristics towards its victim which creates\na persistent mechanism registry and connects to the C2 server.\n\n\n-----",
