What it does, how it works to compromise macOS devices, where it comes\nfrom and what administrators can do to protect their Apple fleet.\n\n**By Ferdous Saljooki and Jaron Bradley**\n\nJamf Threat Labs has discovered a macOS malware family that communicates with\ncommand and control (C2) servers to download and execute various payloads. We track and\nprotect against this malware family under the name ‘RustBucket’ and suspect it to be\nattributed to a North Korean, state-sponsored threat actor. The APT group called BlueNoroff\nis thought to act as a sub-group to the well-known Lazarus Group and is believed to be\n[behind this attack. This attribution is due to the similarities noted in a Kaspersky blog entry](https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/)\ndocumenting an attack on the Windows side. These similarities include malicious tooling on\nmacOS that closely aligns with the workflow and social engineering patterns of those\nemployed in the campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage-One\n\nThe stage-one malware (0be69bb9836b2a266bfd9a8b93bb412b6e4ce1be) was discovered\nwhile performing normal hunting routines for compiled AppleScript applications that\ncontained various suspicious commands. Among our results, we identified a suspicious\nAppleScript file titled main.scpt contained within an unsigned application named Internal PDF\nViewer.app. It should be noted that we have no reason to believe this application is allowed\nto execute without the user manually overriding Gatekeeper.\n\nThe directory structure for the stage-one dropper is shown below. As with all compiled\nAppleScript applications, the primary app code is within the main.scpt file, located within\nthe /Contents/Resources/Scripts/ directory.\n\nAlthough the AppleScript was compiled, we were able to extract its contents by loading it into\nthe macOS Script Editor application. When launched, the dropper executes the code seen\nbelow:\n\nThe stage-one simply executes various do shell script commands to download the stagetwo from the C2 using curl. The malware writes and extracts the contents of the zip file to\nthe /Users/Shared/ directory and executes the stage-two application also named Internal\n```\nPDF Viewer.app. By breaking up the malware into several components or stages, the\n\n```\nmalware author makes analysis more difficult, especially if the C2 goes offline. This is a\nclever but common technique used by malware authors to thwart analysis.\n\nAt the time of our analysis, both the stage-one and stage-two components of this malware\nwere undetected on VirusTotal\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage-Two\n\nAlthough the stage-two (ca59874172660e6180af2815c3a42c85169aa0b2) application name\nand icons look very similar to stage-one, the directory structures are different and there is no\nuse of AppleScript in the latter. The application version, size and bundle identifier —\n```\ncom.apple.pdfViewer — are also notably different, masquerading as a legitimate Apple\n\n```\nbundle identifier. This application is signed with an ad-hoc signature as well.\n\nThe application layout is that of a much more traditional app and is written in Objective-C.\n\nWhen the Internal PDF Viewer application is launched, the user is presented with a PDF\nviewing application where they can select and open PDF documents. The application,\nalthough basic, does actually operate as a functional PDF viewer. A task that isn’t overly\ndifficult using Apple’s well-built PDFKit Framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution, the application does not perform any malicious actions yet. In order for the\nmalware to take the next step and communicate with the attacker, the correct PDF must be\nloaded. We were able to track down a malicious PDF\n(7e69cb4f9c37fad13de85e91b5a05a816d14f490) we believe to be tied to this campaign, as\nit meets all the criteria in order to trigger malicious behaviors.\n\nFor example, when the malicious PDF is double-clicked from within Finder the user will see\nthe following:\n\nThis minimal message informs the user that they must open the PDF using the necessary\napplication in order to see the full details.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen opened within the malicious PDF viewer, the user will see a document (9 pages in\ntotal) that shows a venture capital firm that is interested in investing in different tech startups.\nFrom what we can tell, the PDF was created by taking the website of a small but legitimate\nventure capital firm and putting it into PDF format.\n\nIt should be noted here that earlier, the stage-one dropper reached out to\ncloud[.]dnx[.]capital, thus keeping on theme with the disguise of a venture capital firm.\n\nThis PDF viewer technique used by the attacker is a clever one. At this point, in order to\nperform analysis, not only do we need the stage-two malware but we also require the correct\nPDF file that operates as a key in order to execute the malicious code within the application.\n\n## So, how is the malware displaying a different PDF than the one loaded by the user?\n\nTo answer this, we take a closer look into some of the functions within the app. Most notably,\nwe see one titled viewPDFas part of the PEPWindow class. This function seeks to a specific\noffset within the loaded PDF to check for a specific blob of data. If the expected data is\npresent, a function called _encrypt_data is invoked, which, ironically runs code to decrypt\nthe blob and produce a new PDF. It does this using a hardcoded 100-byte XOR key which\ncan be found in the __CONSTdata of the executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis newly decrypted PDF is then displayed to the user in the application, providing the\nillusion that this app was truly necessary in order to view the full details of the PDF.\n\nSince the embedded PDF file is loaded directly into the viewer, it is never written to the disk.\nUsing a disassembler — such as Hopper — we can extract it by placing a breakpoint on the\nreturn in the encrypt_data function.\n\nIf analyzing the ARM executable (as opposed to the Intel executable), we can print the $x0\nregister which gives us all the bytes of the decrypted blob. Saving these bytes into a file will\nalso reveal the inner PDF file.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage-Two Communication\n\nSo far we’ve decoded the PDF file that is embedded within the original PDF file, but as we\nstated earlier, this is the point where the malware will also phone home to the attacker. Much\nlike the inner PDF document, the attacker’s C2 is also XOR encoded within the original PDF.\nThis is why we see the encrypt_data function run a second time. The following bytes are\npassed to it which can be found towards the bottom of the original PDF document.\n\nThis time when the encrypt_data function runs using the same hardcoded XOR key as\nbefore, it returns the following:\n\nAfter the embedded PDF has been displayed to the user and the URL has been deobfuscated, the malware then calls a function titled _downAndExecute and makes a POST\nrequest to a C2 server to presumably retrieve and execute a stage-three payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the _downAndExecute function shown below, we can see the various parameters being set\nin order to initiate an HTTPrequest.\n\nThe malware also creates a new thread and sleeps before making the POST request again in\na loop until an HTTP 200 response is returned.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of our analysis, the server was not responding with the necessary\nmessage.\n\nWe have however managed to discover a new URL on the same domain that is hosting a\nMach-O executable that we believe to be the new location of the final payload.\n\nIf the stage-two dropper succeeds in downloading the stage-three payload, we can view the\nnext actions within the downAndExecute_block_invoke.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe aforementioned image shows the following steps taking place if the C2 responds:\n\n1. The malware creates a temporary directory and writes the received file to that\n\ntemporary directory. The name of that malicious file will be the current mach timestamp\n(the number of seconds since midnight January 1st, 2001). An example file path would\nlook like this:\n```\n   <strong>/</strong>var/folders/g6/w3s4hg8n57sgfjl4xgrhjs_w0000gn/T/7035176\n   04263\n\n```\n2. Executable permissions are assigned to the new file.\n3. The program arguments are set and the file is executed. The set argument is that of\n\nthe attacker C2 decoded from this stage two payload. The stage-three will go on to use\nthis value.\n\n## Stage-Three\n\nThe stage-three payload (182760cbe11fa0316abfb8b7b00b63f83159f5aa) is an ad-hoc\nsigned trojan written in Rust and weighing in at a sizable 11.2MB. It’s a universal binary that\nholds both ARM and x86 architectures. Upon initial execution, it performs a handful of\nsystem recon commands.\n\nOne of the earliest used modules is titled webT::getinfo. Within this module is the ability to\nlook at the basic info about the system, process listing, current time and whether or not it’s\nrunning within a VM. The functions are named accordingly.\n\n\n-----\n\nRunning this malware results in communication to the URL provided as the first argument\npassed at execution time. The WebT::send_request function is responsible for sending the\ninitial message to the C2 server. When placing a breakpoint on it, we can step over it\nresulting in a call to the server.\n\nThis payload allows the attacker to carry out further objectives on the system, but perhaps a\ndeep dive on stage-three is best saved for another blog post.\n\n## At a High Level\n\nWe dove fairly deeply into some of the different actions of this malware. At a higher level, the\nworkflow looks like the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Connections to BlueNoroff\n\nThere are a few signs that this malware is tied to BlueNoroff. First and foremost is the\ndomain used in the stage-one dropper: cloud[.]dnx[.]capital. This domain was reported as\n[being used by the attackers in a writeup done by Proofpoint. In the previously mentioned](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta444-apt-startup-aimed-at-your-funds)\nKaspersky blog, it was reported that the attackers had created numerous fake domains\nimpersonating venture capital firms and banks in a campaign Kaspersky titled\n‘SnatchCrypto’. This aligns with the social engineering schemes discovered in the PDF\ndocument. The Windows malware also used the “decoy document” approach which clearly\nworked well for the attacker. The earliest submission of the “Internal PDF Viewer” we could\nfind on VirusTotal was uploaded in January 2023 and we’ve observed the attackers\ncontinuing to host it.\n\nWhile many different PDF payloads exist that work on Windows, so far only one PDF has\nbeen discovered that will result in a call to the attacker on macOS. We do suspect more than\njust this one PDF exists. It’s worth noting that the XOR key found within the malware can\nalso be found within a variety of malicious PDF files. However, when loaded into the Viewer\napplication, these files do not result in a properly decoded URL. We suspect a different\nvariant of the malicious viewer (or perhaps a different platform) is capable of loading the\nXOR key from within the PDF instead of the attackers hardcoding it in the malicious app.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware used here shows that as macOS grows in market share, attackers realize that\na number of victims will be immune if their tooling is not updated to include the Apple\necosystem. Lazarus group, which has strong ties to BlueNoroff, has a long history of\nattacking macOS and it’s likely we’ll see more APT groups start doing the same.\n\nJamf Protect defends against the malicious components of this malware and blocks the\nmalicious domains.
