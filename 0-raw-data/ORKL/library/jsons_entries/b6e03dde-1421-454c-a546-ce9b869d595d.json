    "plain_text": "# Doctor Web anticipates increase in number of banking Trojan attacks on Android users\n\n**news.drweb.com/show/**\n\nDoctor Web\n\n[Back to news](https://news.drweb.com/list/?p=0&lng=en&c=5)\n\n**January 20, 2017**\n\n**Modern Android banking Trojans are created by virus writers and sold for serious**\n**sums as commercial products via underground Internet platforms. However, the**\n**source code of one such malicious application was recently made public on a hacker**\n**forum, along with instructions on how to use it. Doctor Web security researchers**\n**believe that this may lead to a significant increase in the number of attacks involving**\n**Android banking Trojans.**\n\nThe virus writers published the source code of the new malicious application just one month\nago, but Doctor Web security researchers have already detected an Android Banker that has\nbeen created using the information published by the cybercriminals. This Trojan, dubbed\n**[Android.BankBot.149.origin, is distributed under the guise of benign programs. When a](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)**\n[smartphone or tablet user installs and runs Android.BankBot.149.origin, the banker](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)\nprompts the user to grant it administrative privileges to hinder its removal from the system.\nAfter that it hides itself from the user by removing its shortcut from the home screen.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen **[Android.BankBot.149.origin connects to the command and control (C&C) server and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)**\nawaits instructions. The Trojan can execute the following actions:\n\nsend SMS messages;\nintercept SMS messages;\nrequest administrator privileges;\nsend USSD requests;\nobtain all contact list phone numbers;\nsend SMS messages containing the text specified in a command to all contact list\nnumbers;\ntrack device geolocation via GPS satellites;\nrequest additional permission on devices using the most recent Android versions to\nsend SMS messages, make calls, and access the contact list and GPS receiver;\nreceive an executable file containing a list of attacked banking applications;\nshow phishing dialogs.\n\n[Like many other Android bankers, Android.BankBot.149.origin steals confidential user](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)\ninformation by tracking the launch of online banking applications and payment system\nsoftware. One sample examined by Doctor Web security researchers controls over three\n[dozen such programs. Once Android.BankBot.149.origin detects that any of the](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)\naforementioned applications have been launched, it loads the relevant phishing input form to\naccess user bank account login and password information and displays it on top of the\nattacked application.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Trojan not only steals mobile banking login credentials but also bank card information\nbelonging to the owner of the compromised device. For this purpose,\n**[Android.BankBot.149.origin tracks the launch of such popular applications as Facebook,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)**\nViber, Youtube, WhatsApp, Uber, Snapchat, WeChat, imo, Instagram, Twitter, and Play Store\nand displays a phishing dialog resembling the one used to make purchases on Google Play.\n\nWhen an SMS message arrives, the Trojan turns off all sounds and vibrations, sends the\nmessage content to the cybercriminals, and attempts to delete the original messages from\nthe list of incoming SMS. As a result, a user could miss not only bank notifications about the\nunplanned transactions but also other incoming messages.\n\n**[Android.BankBot.149.origin uploads all the stolen data on the C&C server, and it becomes](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)**\navailable on the administration panel. This helps cybercriminals to not only obtain the\ninformation they are interested in but also control the malicious application.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn general, the possibilities of this Trojan are quite standard for modern Android bankers.\nHowever, as cybercriminals created it with publicly available information, one can anticipate\nthat many Trojans similar to it will appear. Dr.Web for Android successfully detects\n**[Android.BankBot.149.origin; therefore, this malicious program poses no threat to our](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.BankBot.149.origin&lng=en)**\nusers.\n\n[More about this Trojan](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=14895561&lng=en)\n\n### Protect your Android device with Dr.Web now\n\n[Buy online](https://estore.drweb.com/home/?lng=en) [Buy on Google Play](http://f2.drweb.com/lr/?to=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.drweb.pro) [Free download](https://support.drweb.com/free_mobile/?lng=en)\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
