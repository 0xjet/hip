The\nmalware targeted government institutions in the Middle East and global government organizations associated with geopolitics in the\nregion.\n\nTA402 is a Middle Eastern advanced persistent threat (APT) group that often targets entities in Israel and Palestine, in addition to\nother regions in the Middle East. In campaigns identified throughout 2021, TA402 leveraged Middle Eastern geopolitical themes\nincluding ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip. The custom malware implant identified by Proofpoint enables the threat actor to\nconduct reconnaissance on the target host and exfiltrate data. TA402 leveraged multiple mechanisms to avoid automated threat\nanalysis including geofencing based on IP addresses, only targeting computers with Arabic language packs installed, and\npassword-protected archive files to distribute malware.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nFollowing a busy 2020 for TA402, Proofpoint researchers identified new and highly targeted email threat campaigns impacting\ngovernment organizations in the Middle East and entities with diplomatic relationships in the region.\n\nBased on Proofpoint visibility, the campaigns occurred on a weekly basis throughout early 2021 before abruptly stopping in March\nfor a two-month hiatus. TA402, also known as Molerats and GazaHackerTeam, resumed email threat campaigns in early June\n2021 with continued use of malware Proofpoint dubbed LastConn. Researchers assess with high confidence LastConn is an\n[updated version of SharpStage malware first reported by](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf) [Cybereason in December 2020.](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf%C2%A0)\n\nThe temporary disruption to email threat operations in March 2021 is interesting and may be due to current tensions in the Middle\n[East region including ongoing violence in the Gaza Strip between Israeli and Palestinian militants or the observation of Ramadan in](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-jerusalem-tensions-sparked-heaviest-israel-gaza-fighting-years-2021-05-12/)\nApril through early May 2021, one of the most important religious holidays for Muslims. However, Proofpoint cannot confirm either\nhypothesis with high confidence.\n\n**TA402 Background & Attribution**\n\n[TA402 has been active since at least 2011 and is believed to be operating out of the Middle East. The group’s targeting](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/gaza-hackers-team/%20) [includes but](https://cyber-peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf)\n[is not limited to targets in](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html) [Israel and](https://cyber-peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf%20) [Palestine. [3,4] TA402 is known to target multiple industry verticals such as technology,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html)\ntelecommunications, financial institutions, academic institutions, military installations, media outlets, and government offices. The\nprimary motivation of this group is to collect sensitive information and documents from high values targets to gather\nintelligence. Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence based on lure topics, targeting, and historic campaigns the activity likely\nsupports military or Palestinian state objectives.\n\n**Attack Paths**\n\nTA402 used spear-phishing emails containing either malicious links or attachments in the recently observed campaigns.\n\nIn June campaigns, TA402 leveraged a PDF attachment with one or multiple geofenced URLs leading to password-protected\narchives that contained the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: TA402 attack chain leveraging PDF attachments_\n\nThe email and the PDF are typically both written in Arabic, and the lure is usually based on a geopolitical topic impacting the Middle\nEast, especially the Gaza conflict. Proofpoint observed lure themes including “A delegation from Hamas meets with the Syrian\nregime” and “Hamas member list”. The password of the RAR file can be found inside the text of the PDF. Extracting the archive\nreveals a custom TA402 implant. In recent campaigns, the archive dropped LastConn malware. Other observed malware distributed\nby this attack path include SharpStage, Loda, and MiraiEye RAT.\n\n_Figure 2: Example PDF from 02 June 2021 campaign. The filename is “hamas - syria.pdf” with the content purporting to be details_\n_regarding a delegation of Hamas militants meeting with Syrian regime representatives. (SHA256:_\n_557c60ae9c613164fda3189720eaf78fe60b6bd8191f4d208ca3bbbdceffee36)_\n\nThe PDF link drops the following files.\n\nDownloaded RAR:\n\n\n-----\n\nHamas Syria.rar|0db46fea5a0be8624069f978f115e4270833df29ed776c712182327a758fd639\n\nExe file inside RAR:\n\nإﺟﺘﻤﺎع وﻓﺪ ﻣﻦ ﺣﻤﺎس ﻣﻊ اﻟﻨﻈﺎم اﻟﺴﻮري.exe|f55e2050733576fa16452e2589a187f4bf202ca3b54b1497ba2c006e8d3bdd45\n\nTranslation: “A delegation from Hamas meets with the Syrian regime”\n\nA payload is not immediately downloaded. Proofpoint researchers were unable to determine the exact mechanisms for initiating\nlinks to the hosted malware, but the PDF may only direct the victim to the files if the source IP address belongs to the targeted\ncountries in the Middle East. If the source IP address does not align with the target group, the URL may redirect the recipient to a\nbenign decoy website, typically an Arabic language news website.\n\n_Figure 3: Example Benign Decoy Redirect from 02 June 2021 PDF campaign_\n\nThe password protection of the malicious archive and the geofenced delivery method are two easy anti-detection mechanisms\nthreat actors can use to bypass automatic analysis products.\n\n[Another initial access vector inside TA402’s 2021 arsenal observed in February is the use of Google Apps Script URLs directly](https://developers.google.com/apps-script)\ninside the spear-phishing email. Google Apps Script is a development platform based on JavaScript that allows both the creation of\nstandalone web apps and powerful extensions to various elements of the Google Apps software-as-a-service ecosystem.\nProofpoint [has previously observed multiple threat actors leveraging this method of malware distribution via URLs.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/new-google-apps-script-vulnerability-extends-url-based-threats-saas-platforms)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: TA402 attack chain leveraging Google Apps Script URLs_\n\nIn the identified TA402 campaign, the script also redirects to a password protected archive or to a benign decoy website based\non the geofencing mechanism. Some Google App Script URLs Proofpoint observed in this campaign also require a legitimate login\nto a Google account before they can be accessed.\n\nExample URL from 16 February 2021 URL campaign:\n\nhxxps://script[.]google[.]com/macros/s/AKfycbxhRyJqO682mzT4C3-aNwSULjNPuHvhqpGYElJedUBPfaG60fZSOEQ/exec\n\n_Figure 5: Example benign decoy redirect from 16 February 2021 URL campaign_\n\nExtracting the archive leads to a custom TA402 implant, in this case LastConn.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Example Successful Download of RAR archive from 16 February 2021 URL campaign_\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nTA402 has been using a malware that Proofpoint tracks as LastConn in recent email-based campaigns. It is an updated version or\n[new variant of the malware that Cybereason calls “SharpStage” and analyzed in December 2020.](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf)\n\nLastConn malware is specifically targeted at computers with an Arabic language pack installed to ensure it only infects specific\ntargets. It uses Dropbox for all command and control (C2) capabilities and infrastructure. Proofpoint researchers\nassess LastConn is very actively developed and maintained malware. It features multiple capabilities that attempt to prevent both\nautomated and manual malware analysis.\n\n**Samples**\n\nFor this malware analysis Proofpoint researchers analyzed the following two samples:\n\n[SHA256: 6d65804ca8f71e21b18de08176a53d8f203bc23629dd822ef3c0da217f95f119](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/6d65804ca8f71e21b18de08176a53d8f203bc23629dd822ef3c0da217f95f119/)\n\nCompile time: 2021-02-16 06:55:44\n\nUsed in an email-based campaign on 16 February 2021\n\nand\n\n[SHA256: f55e2050733576fa16452e2589a187f4bf202ca3b54b1497ba2c006e8d3bdd45](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/f55e2050733576fa16452e2589a187f4bf202ca3b54b1497ba2c006e8d3bdd45/)\n\nCompile time: 2021-05-27 04:58:05\n\nUsed in email-based campaigns in June 2021\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe name “LastConn” is based on a file “LastConn.txt” that is maintained on the malware’s Dropbox account and used to document\nwhen the malware was active:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Origin of “LastConn” name_\n\n**Anti-Analysis**\n\nBoth samples use third-party .NET code obfuscators. The sample in February used an unknown obfuscator that\nthe [de4dot deobfuscator was unable to deobfuscate.](https://github.com/de4dot/de4dot)\n\nBased on a string, the sample in June used an obfuscator called “Eziriz's .NET Reactor”. It added obfuscations such as:\n\nObfuscated names\n\nJunk code\n\nControl flow obfuscation\n\nDate check – e.g., not runnable 14 days after 2021-06-16\n\nEncrypted strings – see below\n\nWhile de4dot could not fully deobfuscate this one either, it was able to clean up some of the obfuscations.\n\nStrings in the malware and its included components were stored encrypted inside a .NET resource. A 32-byte key was stored as a\nstack string with multiple character replacements and is used with an unknown decryption algorithm. Once the resource is\ndecrypted strings are referenced by an index. We have included a list of decrypted strings and their index values on our Proofpoint\nThreat Research GitHub.\n\nIn addition to the code obfuscator anti-analysis mechanisms, the LastConn malware requires mouse clicks and an Arabic\nlanguage pack to be installed on the victim’s computer before it will continue executing its malicious functionality:\n\n_Figure 8: Arabic language check_\n\n**Configuration**\n\nLastConn’s configuration is stored as an unnamed encrypted PE resource:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Encrypted configuration_\n\nIt can be decrypted by:\n\nSplitting on “#” and finding the piece with data\n\nReversing the data, but keeping any trailing “=”s\n\nBase64 decoding\n\nSplitting on “@”\n\nThe configuration for the February sample looks like:\n\ntxt_Totime=25\n\ntxt_Ftime=20\n\ntxt_FristTimeConn=20\n\ntxt_PathDir=C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\n\ntxt_PassRar=YOV76B95S6\n\ntxt_Mutex=95DTUJMONY4LMDLYZZBQFSSGG\n\ntxt_KeyPath=SOFTWARE\\MicroFile\n\ntxt_LastConn=LastConn.txt\n\ntxt_ShellCode=ShellCode.txt\n\ntxt_ListFile=ListFile.txt\n\ntxt_isdownload=isdownload.txt\n\ntxt_FileToDown=FileToDown.txt\n\ntxt_TokenRunOne=2AQ...\n\ntxt_FileName=Local\n\ntxt_MyToken=2AQ...\n\ntxt_FileOpen=hamas.docx\n\ntxt_Setting=Setting\n\nThe configuration for the June sample looks like:\n\ntxt_Totime=60\n\n\n-----\n\ntxt_Ftime 50\n\ntxt_FristTimeConn=45\n\ntxt_PathDir=C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\n\ntxt_PassRar=1D1VQB4G8Q\n\ntxt_Mutex=NVQAGGMV22CY37LNUO9T5CZVS\n\ntxt_KeyPath=SOFTWARE\\Box\n\ntxt_LastConn=LastConn.txt\n\ntxt_ShellCode=ShellCode.txt\n\ntxt_ListFile=ListFile.txt\n\ntxt_isdownload=isdownload.txt\n\ntxt_FileToDown=FileToDown.txt\n\ntxt_TokenRunOne=O1P...\n\ntxt_FileName=Viewfile\n\ntxt_MyToken=O1P...\n\ntxt_FileOpen=news.doc\n\ntxt_Setting=Setting\n\n“txt_TokenRunOne” and “txt_MyToken” are Dropbox authentication tokens and have been redacted in this report. The malware\ntrims the first three characters off the token before using them.\n\nMost of these config options will be discussed below, but the ones that are not include:\n\ntxt_Totime, txt_Ftime, and txt_FristTimeConn – used to control timing of the malware\n\ntxt_Mutex – used as a mutex name\n\ntxt_KeyPath – used as a registry subkey to track some malware status\n\ntxt_isdownload – a status/debug file that is maintained on the malware’s Dropbox\n\n**Functionality**\n\nThe first time LastConn runs, a “RunFileOnes” function is executed. This function uses the legitimate Dropbox API and\nthe “txt_TokenRunOne” authentication token to download the “txt_FileOpen” file to “txt_PathDir”. This file is\nthen opened, and Proofpoint researchers believe it is used to display a decoy document. The February decoy document was\nnamed “hamas.docx” and looked like:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Example of LastConn decoy document_\n\nThe decoy document for the June campaigns, “news.doc”, was not available at the time of research.\n\nAfter the decoy document functionality, a “StartFolder” function is executed. Using the Dropbox API and the “txt_MyToken”\nauthentication token a working directory is created on the malware’s Dropbox named “<computer_name><username>”. An\nempty “txt_FileToDown” file is then uploaded to the working directory. Proofpoint researchers believe this empty file is used to signal\nthat the malware has been initialized and is ready to execute commands.\n\nThe final broad function is called “GetUpload” and is used to do several things. First, it maintains the “txt_LastConn” malware\nactivity log mentioned in the “Naming” section above.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond, it downloads the txt_Setting file which contains a third Dropbox authentication token used for command handling. If this\nfile cannot be downloaded, a new “txt_MyToken” is fetched from Pastebin sites and the download is tried again. At the time of\nresearch, the content of the configured Pastebin URLs were unavailable:\n\nhxxps://pastebin\\.com/raw/q81XevX2\n\nhxxps://justpaste\\.it/ONE_ME_OR18\n\nThird, it downloads the legitimate RAR utility file Rar.exe and “txt_FileName”.rar file. The RAR archive is decompressed using the\ndownloaded RAR utility and “txt_PassRar” password. The June campaign’s “Viewfile.rar” contained:\n\nViewfile.exe - a copy of the LastConn malware\n\nSHA256: f55e2050733576fa16452e2589a187f4bf202ca3b54b1497ba2c006e8d3bdd45\n\nViewfileQA.exe - a program that sets up registry “Shell Folders” and “User Shell Folders” persistence for LastConn\n\n[SHA256: 0f36088ed9f5ffd4b42d35789113e99d8839edc52e554dbee0969bcad0200cfb](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/0f36088ed9f5ffd4b42d35789113e99d8839edc52e554dbee0969bcad0200cfb/)\n\nFourth and final capability is command handling. The “txt_FileToDown” file is downloaded from Dropbox using the authentication\ntoken received in the “txt_Setting” file. If there are any commands to execute, this file will contain newline delimited “<command>=\n<command arguments>” entries. Commands include:\n\nDFileDrop – download and execute file hosted on the malware’s Dropbox\n\nDFromUrl – download and execute file hosted at a URL\n\nCmd – execute cmd.exe command and send results back to the malware’s Dropbox via the “txt_ShellCode” file\n\nPowershell – similar to “Cmd”, but for Powershell\n\nWMIC - similar to “Cmd”, but for WMIC\n\nListFile – get specified file listing and send results back to the malware’s Dropbox via the “txt_ListFile” file\n\nUploadFiles – create folder on the malware’s Dropbox and upload specified files to it\n\nScreenshot – take a screenshot and upload to the malware’s Dropbox\n\nGetIP – get IP address via hxxps://api.ipify\\.org and upload to the malware’s Dropbox\n\nOnce a command is executed, its entry is removed from the “txt_FileToDown” file and the file is re-uploaded to the\nmalware’s Dropbox.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTA402 is a highly effective and capable threat actor that remains a serious threat, especially to entities operating in and working\nwith government or other geopolitical entities in the Middle East. Researchers anticipate TA402 will remain very active, based on its\nreturn to weekly threat activity as of June 2021. It is likely TA402 continue its targeting largely focused on the Middle East\nregion. Proofpoint assesses TA402 will continue to develop and modify customized malware implants and include features to evade\ndetection and automated analysis.\n\nTo defend against exploitation, Proofpoint recommends recipients pay close attention when downloading and opening password\nprotected archives, and only open them from trusted sources. Proofpoint’s Threat Research team developed Emerging Threat rules\nto detect post infection network traffic.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nf55e2050733576fa16452e2589a187f4bf202ca3b54b1497ba2c006e8d3bdd45 SHA256 “إﺟﺘﻤﺎع وﻓﺪ ﻣﻦ ﺣﻤﺎس ﻣﻊ اﻟﻨﻈﺎم اﻟﺴﻮري.exe”\n\n                                          - LastConn sample June 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n0db46fea5a0be8624069f978f115e4270833df29ed776c712182327a758fd639 SHA256 “Hamas-Syria.rar” - Password protected\nRAR archive containing LastConn exe\nJune 2021\n\nhxxp[:]//192[.]210[.]151[.]43/CVDWwr42525[.]php URL URL that leads to “HamasSyria.rar” June 2021\n\n557c60ae9c613164fda3189720eaf78fe60b6bd8191f4d208ca3bbbdceffee36 SHA256 “hamas - syria.pdf” - PDF as seen in\nemail June 2021\n\n\n0f36088ed9f5ffd4b42d35789113e99d8839edc52e554dbee0969bcad0200cfb\n\n1cf18ce4becf2244fb715aa52eb4d56b569a95f2a1e7a835d217a20a2757a2d8\n\n\nSHA256\n\n\nSHA256 “Hammas.exe”\n\n      - LastConn sample 16th February 2021\n\n\nSets up persistence\nfor LastConn sample June 2021\n\n\n6d65804ca8f71e21b18de08176a53d8f203bc23629dd822ef3c0da217f95f119 SHA256 “Hammas.exe”\n\n                                            - LastConn dropper 16th February 2021\n\ncd60488acc0cc596c0de63eb0a7bca4ada4748fc4e76a86ca0fab42f15050347 SHA256 “Hammas.rar” - Password protected\nRAR archive containing\n“Hamas.exe” 16th February 2021\n\n\nhxxps://script[.]google[.]com/macros/s/AKfycbxhRyJqO682mzT4C3aNwSULjNPuHvhqpGYElJedUBPfaG60fZSOEQ/exec\n\n**ET Signatures**\n\n2848195 - ETPRO MALWARE Molerats LastConn Dropbox Activity\n\n\nURL URL that leads to\n“Hammas.rar” 16th ebruary 2021\n\n\n-----",
