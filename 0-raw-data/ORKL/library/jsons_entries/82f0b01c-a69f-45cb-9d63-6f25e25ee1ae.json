    "plain_text": "# Swiss Army Knife Phishing\n\n**blog.group-ib.com/phishing-vietnam-banks**\n\n09.06.2022\n\nGroup-IB identifies massive campaign capable of targeting clients of major Vietnamese\nbanks\n\n\n-----\n\nYaroslav Kargalev\n\nDeputy Head of CERT-GIB\n\n\n-----\n\nIvan Lebedev\n\nHead of CERT-GIB's Anti-phishing and global cooperation unit\n\nGroup-IB’s Asia-Pacific [Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB), tasked with](https://www.group-ib.com/cert.html)\nmonitoring phishing violations across the world, has spotted an unprecedented mass-scale\nphishing campaign impersonating Vietnamese financial institutions and targeting their clients.\n\nAccording to CERT-GIB, the websites involved in the campaign mimic 27 popular financial\ninstitutions. Cybercriminals aim to steal money and banking customers’ personal and\npayment details, such as name, address, national identity card number, phone number,\nDOB, and occupation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign was launched back in 2019 with the first domain having been registered in\nMay 2019. Since the start of the fraudulent operations, Group-IB has identified 240\n**interconnected domains. All 240 domains were taken down following CERT-GIB and other**\nlocal authorities’ efforts.\n\n_[Cybercriminals’ phishing infrastructure. Source: Group-IB Network Graph Analysis Tool](https://www.group-ib.com/ti/graph.html)_\n\nHowever, the operation remains active up until now: the latest phishing domain, that is part of\nthe cybercriminals’ infrastructure, was activated on June 1, 2022. New domains come and\ngo regularly. They do not live long by design to complicate detection and takedown. Group-IB\ncontinues to cooperate with domain registrars and other authorities to take down new\ndomains identified to contain further financial loss for banking customers and to protect\nbanks from reputation damage.\n\nCERT-GIB was able to retrieve the number of visitors to 44 out of 240 websites identified,\nwhere web counters were installed. Just since the beginning of 2021, at least 7,800 potential\nvictims visited these 44 phishing resources. The overall number of visitors and affected users\nis unknown but is believed to be significantly higher, taking into account the scale, duration of\nthe fraudulent operations and the degree of sophistication in the methods used by the\ncybercriminals. The campaign is directed at major financial institutions of Vietnam with every\nphishing website, it uses an OTP hijacking scheme, and their communications tactics are\nhighly customized and targeted.\n\nUpon detection of the phishing campaign, CERT-GIB immediately notified Vietnam’s national\ncomputer emergency response team VNCERT. Group-IB team also continues its outreach\nacross the banks that the scammers impersonate.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key characteristics of the phishing campaign:**\n\n**Targets several major financial institution of Vietnam and its customers with every**\n**phishing website.**\n\n**Two main objectives of the campaign: control of users online banking transactions;**\n**gather PII data (name, address, national identity card details, phone number, DOB, and**\n**occupation)**\n\n**To trick the victims into phishing websites cybercriminals distribute customized**\n**messages/emails disguised as legitimate banks to apply for loans, quick cash, or to**\n**claim gift vouchers from famous ecommerce brands.**\n\n**Cybercriminals use OTP hijacking techniques that allow them to bypass verification.**\n\n**These phishing websites contain the logos of 27 highly reputed banks and financial**\n**institutes in the form of a single page or as a drop down option where victims can pick**\n**their registered bank.**\n\n**This campaign has not been seen in public targeting financial institutions in other**\n**countries apart from Vietnam.**\n\n## Victim journey\n\nCybercriminals behind this campaign leverage rogue SMS, Telegram and What’s App\nmessages, and even comments on Facebook pages of legitimate Vietnamese financial\nservice companies to drive traffic to their phishing resources.\n\nSuch comments, observed by CERT-GIB, included the link which takes the victims to the\nphishing site. One of the tactics used by the operators of the campaign is the usage of\nshortened URLs where an average user would be unable to differentiate the legitimacy of the\n\n\n-----\n\nURL.\n\nUpon clicking on the link, the victims will be forwarded to a fake web page which is identical\nto the bank mobile login page where they are prompted to enter their credentials.\n\nAutomated machine translation form Vietnamese to English\n\nOther channels that cybercriminals tap into are SMS and What’s App. They send out rogue\nmessages purporting to come from legitimate banks or ecommerce companies. The\nfraudulent What’s App message below informs the recipient about the possibility to receive\nabout 200 million VNĐ. To claim the award, the victim is prompted to click on the link to fill\nthe banking account details.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: scamvn.com\n\nAnother SMS, obtained by CERT-GIB informs the victim that they have been awarded a gift\nand need to login to their banking portal to receive it. The message says that the offer is set\nto expire soon. By doing so the scammers create a sense of urgency.\n\n\n-----\n\nAutomated machine translation form Vietnamese to English\n\nUpon clicking on such links, the victims are forwarded to a fake web page featuring the logos\nof Vietnamese leading banks.\n\n_The legitimate companies’ logos have been blurred to minimize further reputational damage_\n_for the organizations affected with the campaign_\n\nOnce the victim chooses its bank from the list, they are redirected to another phishing page\ndisguised as a legitimate banking portal.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the username and password are filled, the victims are once again redirected to a fake\nweb page where a One Time Password (OTP) is requested. At the same time the fraudsters\nuse already stolen credentials to login into the victim's real account. After the victim receives\nan OTP from their bank (requested by fraudsters) and submits it via a fake authentication\npage, the cybercriminals gain full access to the victim’s bank account.\n\nAfter the “log in”, the victim is shown a message that says that the transaction is still\nprocessing.\n\nHaving this information allows cybercriminals to steal funds from victims' accounts. With this\ndata they can also initiate unauthorized illicit transactions. Additionally, scammers harvest a\nvast amount of personal data. Such data is traded actively in the cybercriminal underground\nand can be purchased by other threat actors for further targeted follow-up attacks on the\nvictims.\n\nGroup-IB has observed offers to sell Vietnamese citizens’ information harvested as a result\nof phishing campaigns on underground markets. While it is unknown whether the information\nis authentic and is sourced directly from this phishing campaign or not, CERT-GIB’s analysts\nhave seen first-hand instances of offers to sell data about holders of bank accounts in\nVietnam.\n\nCERT-GIB is closely monitoring the campaign and its infrastructure for the appearance of\nnew phishing. Group-IB team continues to work with registrars, hosting providers, and\ncompetent organizations in Vietnam to action phishing domains in a timely manner to to\ncontain further financial loss for banking users and to protect banks from reputation damage.\n**Recommendations**\n\n**For users**\n\nThe communications that create a sense of urgency and intimidation are always red\nflags.\n\nUsers should pay attention to the URL in the browser. They should also be wary of\nmalfunctioning websites and long chains of redirection. Users should also avoid\npurchasing from unauthorized resellers and clicking on links in fraudulent discount\narticles. It’s important to confirm the credibility of the resource. It takes some time to\nfind the company’s official website, look for reviews, and call customer support but it’s\nworth it.\n\nEnabling 2FA where possible is a must. Changing passwords from time to time is also\na good habit.\n\n\n-----\n\n**For companies**\n\nCybercriminals exploit the lack of decent monitoring and blocking efforts to create fake\nsites that misuse legitimate brand names. Companies need to be swift in taking actions\nagainst such complex threats. Detection at early stages is the key to minimizing the\ndigital risks to the affected brands and to safeguarding the potential victims. Mapping\nand attributing newly registered domains can help to reveal patterns to improve the\nquality and scope of detection. Effective monitoring and blockage should involve an\nautomated machine-learning digital risk protection system fuelled by regular updates to\nits knowledge base about cybercriminals' infrastructure, tactics, tools.\n\n## Identify and mitigate digital risks to your brand\n\nwith Group-IB Digital Risk Protection\n\nRequest Demo\n\n\n-----",
