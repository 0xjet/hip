FireEye, like all security vendors, fighting for a\ngood cause. We support FireEye and we think that their response so far very mature and\ntransparent sharing countermeasures to detect the use of their stolen tools.\n\nWe know that in such a situation and in a limited time, it is not easy to build all possible\ncountermeasures. So we are also doing our best to support the community, sharing analysis,\nand additional countermeasures to help organizations to validate and improve their security\nposture for the possible use of the leaked Red Team tools against them.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nIn this article, we analyzed 60 tools stolen from FireEye Red Team’s arsenal to understand\nthe impact of this breach. We found that:\n\n43% of the stolen tools are publicly available tools that are using known attack\ntechniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n40% of tools are developed in-house by FireEye. These tools also utilize known\nadversary techniques.\n17% of the stolen tools cannot be identified since FireEye did not share adequate\ndetails about these tools. According to their names, we believe that most of these\nunknown tools are also slightly modified versions of publicly available tools.\n\nFireEye also announced that exploits of 16 vulnerabilities were also stolen. But there is no\nroom for a big concern regarding these vulnerabilities and their exploits since they are\nalready well-known.\n\nAt first, this breach remained the stolen NSA hacking tools published in the Shadow Brokers\nleak. A couple of high severity 0-day exploits were released in the NSA breach. These 0-day\nexploits caused severe security incidents worldwide, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nHowever, stolen tools and exploits in the FireEye breach utilizes known attack techniques.\nOur analysis shows that this breach will not have high impact on organizations.\n\nStill, countermeasures should be taken against the stolen tools since they are frequently\nused by threat actors. In our new blog post, \"It is Time to Take Action - How to Defend\nAgainst FireEye’s Red Team Tools\", we shared our comprehensive Blue Team\nrecommendations, our detection contents as SIGMA and vendor-specific queries, and also\nvendor-based prevention signatures related to defending against FireEye Red Team tools.\n\n**Stolen Red Team Tools**\n\nFireEye has not shared details about what the stolen red team tools do. The Red and Blue\nTeam analysts of Picus Labs analyzed the compromised tools to reveal the functionalities\nand possible impacts of these tools.\n\nWe categorized these tools into four sets:\n\n1. Tools Based on Open Source Projects: These red team tools are slightly modified\n\nversions of open-source tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Tools Based on Built-in Windows Binaries: These tools use built-in Windows\n\nbinaries known as LOLBINs (Living Off The Land Binaries) [1].\n3. Tools Developed In-house for Fireeye’s Red Team: These tools are specially\n\ndeveloped for the use of FireEye’s Red Team.\n4. Tools Without Adequate Data to Analyze: There is not enough data to analyze these\n\ntools. The Yara rules published by FireEye for the following tools are specific to\nProjectGuid of the tool.\n\nThe below chart shows the distribution of stolen red team tools according to the above\ncategories.\n\n## Stolen Exploits\n\nIn addition to the red team tools, there are also exploit payloads affected by the incident.\nLeaked payloads exploit the following list of vulnerabilities. According to FireEye's report,\nleaked payloads do not include a 0-day exploit.\n\n\n**CVE**\n**Number**\n\nCVE-20141812\n\nCVE-20160167\n\nCVE-201711774\n\n\n**Vulnerability Type** **Affected Product** **CVSS** **Picus**\n**ThreatID**\n\nPrivilege Escalation Windows 9.0\n\nPrivilege Escalation Microsoft Windows 7.8\n\nRemote Code Execution Microsoft Outlook 7.8\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE-201813379\n\nCVE-201815961\n\nCVE-20190604\n\nCVE-20190708\n\nCVE-201911510\n\nCVE-201911580\n\nCVE-201919781\n\nCVE-20193398\n\nCVE-20198394\n\nCVE-20200688\n\nCVE-20201472\n\nCVE-20188581\n\nCVE-202010189\n\nCVE-20141812\n\n\nPre-auth Arbitrary File Read Fortigate SSL VPN 9.8 545960\n\nRemote Code Execution Adobe ColdFusion 9.8\n\nRemote Code Execution Microsoft Sharepoint 9.8 365560\n\n836508\n\nRemote Code Execution Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 9.8 689860\n\nPre-auth Arbitrary File Read Pulse Secure SSL VPN 10.0 575541\n\nRemote Code Execution Atlassian Crowd 9.8\n\n\nRemote Code Execution Citrix Application Delivery Controller and\nCitrix Gateway\n\n\n9.8 311195\n\n321318\n\n\nAuthenticated Remote Code\nExecution\n\nPre-auth Arbitrary File\nUpload\n\n\nConfluence 8.8 541281\n\nZoHo ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus 6.5\n\n\nRemote Code Execution Microsoft Exchange 8.8 765961\n\nPrivilege Escalation Microsoft Active Directory 10.0 318083\n\n474540\n\nPrivilege Escalation Microsoft Exchange Server 7.4\n\nRemote Code Execution ZoHo ManageEngine Desktop Central 9.8 752616\n\nPrivilege Escalation Windows 9.0\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE-20160167\n\nCVE-201711774\n\nCVE-201815961\n\nCVE-201911580\n\nCVE-20198394\n\nCVE-20188581\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation Microsoft Windows 7.8 875573\n\nRemote Code Execution Microsoft Outlook 7.8 468843\n\nRemote Code Execution Adobe ColdFusion 9.8 764471\n\nRemote Code Execution Atlassian Crowd 9.8\n\n\nPre-auth Arbitrary File\nUpload\n\n\nZoHo ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus 6.5\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation Microsoft Exchange Server 7.4\n\n\nBelow chart shows the distribution of the vulnerabilities according to the vulnerability type:\n\n## Usual Suspects\n\nFireEye frequently engages with Russian threat actors being a cybersecurity company\nfighting with APT groups and nation-state threat actors. According to the Washington Post,\nAPT29 (also known as YTTRIUM, The Dukes, Cozy Bear, and CozyDuke) [2] carried out the\nFireEye breach [3]. However, there is no evidence to prove that.\n\n## Update (December 14, 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\nIT company SolarWinds announced on Sunday that the SolarWinds Orion network\nmonitoring product has been tampered by a state-sponsored threat actor via embedding\nbackdoor code into a legitimate SolarWinds library [31]. This leads to the attacker having\nremote access into the victim’s environment and a foothold in the network, which can be\nused by the attacker to obtain privileged credentials. Today, SolarWinds breach is connected\nto the FireEye breach, and suspicions on Russia increased [32].\n\n## Blue Team Recommendations\n\nPicus Labs’ Blue Team prepared a list of recommendations for preventing and detecting the\nstolen tools and exploits.\n\n1. Mitigating Vulnerabilities\n\nAssess your systems against vulnerabilities listed in the above section using\nvulnerability scanning and monitoring tools. If there are any gaps you haven't patched\nyet, you must fix them, and you should check if they have been abused in your\nsystems.\n\n2. Compromise Assessment\n\nYou can conduct compromise assessments on your systems by using released Yara\nrules by FireEye [4]. To utilize Yara rules, you can use an open-source Yara scanning\ntool or enterprise product and distribute it to the endpoints on your systems, then add\nthe rules and get the results. Moreover, you can use IoCs included in Yara rules and\nsearch them in your SIEM environment.\n\n3. Utilize IOCs\n\nTo prevent and detect future related threats, you can add IOCs given in this report to\nyour security products, such as EDR, EPP, and SIEM. However, keep in mind that\nthese IoCs can easily be changed by adversaries.\n\n4. Utilize Snort Rules\n\nMost network security products support Snort rules. You can add released Snort rules\nto your security devices[4]. If you are already using Snort, you can check the current\nrules are up to date.\n\n5. Update Your Security Products\n\nSecurity vendors are releasing new signatures and rule sets that include\ncountermeasures against stolen tools. Update your security products and their rule and\nsignature sets.\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Hunting with OpenIOC\n\nFireEye released some countermeasures in the OpenIoC format. You can add these\nrules to your security devices by developing detection and hunting rules using IoC\neditors.\n\nFore more detailed recommendations and our detection contents as SIGMA and vendorspecific (ArcSight, Carbon Black, QRadar, and Splunk) queries, and also vendor-based\n(CheckPoint, Cisco, Citrix, Fortinet, F5, McAfee, ModSecurity, Palo Alto Networks, Snort,\nTrend Micro) prevention signatures read our new blog post, \"It is Time to Take Action - How\nto Defend Against FireEye’s Red Team Tools\".\n\n## Picus in Action\n\nThe Picus Threat Library includes most of the stolen tools, and the Picus Mitigation Library\ncontains actionable mitigation recommendations and detection rules. Picus Labs’ Red Team\nand Blue Teams are working on missed tools and adding them and their techniques to our\nlibraries.\n\nSo, our users have already assessed their cyber defense against most of the stolen red team\ntools and their attack techniques. And, they fixed the identified gaps using actionable\nrecommendations provided by Picus platform.\n\n## Detailed Analysis of the Tools\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Tools Based on Open Source Projects:\n\nThese red team tools are slightly modified versions of open-source tools.\n\n### 1.1 ADPassHunt\n\nIt is a credential stealer tool that hunts Active Directory credentials. There are two\nremarkable strings in the YARA rule [5] of this tool: Get-GPPPasswords and GetGPPAutologons. Get-GPPPassword is a PowerShell script that retrieves the plaintext\npassword and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences\n(GPP) [6]. Get-GPPAutologons is another PowerShell script that retrieves passwords\nfrom Autologon entries that are pushed through GPP. These scripts are used as\nfunctions in the PowerSploit, which is an offensive security framework combining\n[PowerShell modules and scripts [7].

A beacon is a CobaltStrike\npayload used by adversaries for several goals, such as persistence, execution,\nprivilege escalation, credential dumping, lateral movement, and Command and Control\n(C2) communication over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB, and TCP protocols [8]. According\nto countermeasures published by FireEye, the Beacon tool uses HTTP, HTTPS, and\nDNS beacons. The Beacon tool utilizes built-in Windows binaries, such as msbuild.exe,\nMicrosoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe, and regsvr32.exe to execute arbitrary payloads, and\nsearchindexer.exe for process injection to evade defenses. It renames these binaries to\n[avoid name-based detection rules by masquerading.
