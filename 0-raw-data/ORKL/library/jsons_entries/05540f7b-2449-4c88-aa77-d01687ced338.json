But this\nyear, the malvertising campaigns dropped WastedLocker and showed technical evolution.\n\nFor instance, they started using signed binaries and various second-stage payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore recently, the attackers exploited the [ZeroLogon (CVE-2020-1472) critical vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zerologon/)\nto gain admin access to the network. This occurred via the SocGholish JavaScript\n[framework, found earlier this year on dozens of hacked newspaper sites owned by the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dozens-of-us-news-sites-hacked-in-wastedlocker-ransomware-attacks/)\nsame company.\n\nPlanting the malicious fake ads that lure unsuspecting users into clicking it to install an\nupdate was possible by poisoning search engine results or through malicious online\nadvertisements.\n\nIn at least one attack Microsoft detected, the crooks purchased a search engine ad that\ncaused top results for Teams software to point to a domain under their control.\n\nClicking on the link downloaded a payload that executed a PowerShell script to retrieve\nmore malicious content. It also installed a legitimate copy of Microsoft Teams on the system\nto keep victims unaware of the attack.\n\nMicrosoft says that in many cases the initial payload was Predator the Thief infostealer,\nwhich sends the attacker sensitive information like credentials, browser, and payment data.\nOther malware distributed this way includes Bladabindi (NJRat) backdoor, and ZLoader\nstealer.\n\nThe malware also downloaded other payloads, with Cobalt Strike beacons being among\nthem, thus allowing the attacker to discover how they could move laterally across the\nnetwork.\n\nsource: Microsoft\nIn several of the observed attacks, the last stage was detonating file-encrypting malware on\nthe network computers.\n\nMicrosoft is warning that the same patterns seen in the FakeUpdates campaigns using\nTeams updates as lure were observed in at least six others, suggesting the same actor\nbehind them. In some variations of the same theme, the attacker used the IP Logger URL\nshortening service.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigation advice\n\nMicrosoft recommends using web browsers that can filter and block malicious websites\n(scam, phishing, malware and exploit hosts) along with using strong, random passwords for\nlocal administrators.\n\nLimiting admin privileges to essential users and avoiding domain-wide service accounts that\nhave the same permissions as an administrator are also on the list of measures that would\nreduce the impact of an attack.\n\nTo minimize the attack surface, Microsoft recommends blocking executable files that do not\nmeet specific criteria such as prevalence and age or are outside a regularly maintained\ntrusted list.\n\nBlocking JavaScript and VBScript code from downloading executable content also adds to\nthe defenses of the environment.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Fake Windows 10 updates infect you with Magniber ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-windows-10-updates-infect-you-with-magniber-ransomware/)\n\n[Microsoft finds severe bugs in Android apps from large mobile providers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-finds-severe-bugs-in-android-apps-from-large-mobile-providers/)\n\n[Microsoft to force better security defaults for all Azure AD tenants](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-force-better-security-defaults-for-all-azure-ad-tenants/)\n\n[Cobalt Strike](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cobalt-strike/)\n[Malvertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malvertising/)\n[Microsoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[Microsoft Teams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-teams/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
