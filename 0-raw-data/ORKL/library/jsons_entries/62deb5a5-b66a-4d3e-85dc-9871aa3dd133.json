In recent days, SentinelOne has seen a further variant in the same campaign\nusing lures for open positions at rival exchange Crypto.com. In this post, we review the\ndetails of this ongoing campaign and publish the latest indicators of compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Coinbase Campaign Turns to Crypto.com\n\nNorth-Korean linked APT threat actor Lazarus has been using lures for attractive job offers in\na number of campaigns since at least 2020, including targeting aerospace and defense\ncontractors in a campaign dubbed ‘Operation Dream Job’.\n\nWhile those campaigns distributed Windows malware, macOS malware has been discovered\nusing a similar tactic. Decoy PDF documents advertising positions on crypto exchange\n[platform Coinbase were discovered by our friends at ESET back in August 2022, with](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1559553324998955010?s=20&t=Rtojc63KUJ-L8L3daoNqDQ)\nindications that the campaign dated back at least a year. Last week, SentinelOne observed\nvariants of the malware using new lures for vacancies at Crypto.com.\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document advertising positions on crypto.com\n\n## First Stage and Persistence\n\n[Although it is not clear at this stage how the malware is being distributed, earlier reports](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/17/operation-interception-aerospace-military-companies-cyberspies/)\nsuggested that threat actors were attracting victims via targeted messaging on LinkedIn.\n\nThe first stage [dropper is a Mach-O binary that is a similar template to the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fb1e0719a35635aa882fe5545d154f2d4349277e6a9ff89a29f1af229e29b034)\n```\nsafarifontsagent binary used in the Coinbase variant. The first stage creates a folder in\n\n```\nthe user’s Library called “WifiPreference” and drops a persistence agent at\n```\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wifianalyticsagent.plist, targeting an executable in\n\n```\nthe WifiPreferences folder called `wifianalyticsagent .`\n\n\n-----\n\nPersistence agent com.wifianalyticsagent\nThe LaunchAgent uses the same label as in the Coinbase variant, namely `iTunes_trush,`\nbut changes the target executable location and the agent file name. Analysis of the binary\nshows that these details are simply hardcoded in the `startDaemon() function at compile`\ntime, and as such there are likely to be further variants extant or forthcoming.\n\nThe startDaemon() function hardcodes the persistence agent details\nThe WifiPreference folder contains several other items, including the decoy document,\nCrypto.com_Job_Opportunities_2022_confidential.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PDF is a 26 page dump of all vacancies at Crypto.com. Consistent with observations in\nthe earlier campaign, this PDF is created with MS Word 2016, PDF version 1.5. The\ndocument author is listed as “UChan”.\n\nThe PDF decoy was created with MS Word 2016\nThe first stage malware opens the PDF decoy document and wipes the Terminal’s current\nsavedState.\n```\nopen\n'/Users/tritium/Library/WifiPreference/Crypto.com_Job_Opportunities_2022_confidential.\n &&\n\nrm -rf '/Users/tritium/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState'\n\n\n```\nThe second stage in the Crypto.com variant is a bare-bones application bundle named\n“WifiAnalyticsServ.app”; this mirrors the same architecture seen in the Coinbase variant,\nwhich used a second stage called “FinderFontsUpdater.app”. The application uses the\nbundle identifier `finder.fonts.extractor and has been in existence since at least 2021.`\n\nThe main purpose of the second-stage is to extract and execute the third-stage binary,\n```\nwifianalyticsagent . This functions as a downloader from a C2 server. The Coinbase\n\n```\nvariant used the domain `concrecapital[.]com . In the Crypto.com sample, this has`\nchanged to `market.contradecapital[.]com .`\n\n\n-----\n\nHardcoded C2 in the third-stage downloader\nThe payload is written to the WifiPreference folder as `WifiCloudWidget . Unfortunately,`\ndue to the C2 being offline when we analysed the sample, we were unable to retrieve the\n```\nWifiCloudWidget payload.\n\n```\nThe threat actors have made no effort to encrypt or obfuscate any of the binaries, possibly\nindicating short-term campaigns and/or little fear of detection by their targets. The binaries\nare all universal Mach-Os capable of running on either Intel or M1 Apple silicon machines\n[and signed with an ad hoc signature, meaning that they will pass Apple’s Gatekeeper checks](https://assets.sentinelone.com/macos-security/enterprise-mac-security)\ndespite not being associated with a recognized developer identity.\n\nThe wifianalyticsagent sample passes Gatekeeper with an ‘ad hoc’ signature\n\n## Staying Protected Against Lazarus Malware\n\nSentinelOne customers are protected against the malware variants used in this campaign.\nFor those not currently protected by SentinelOne, security teams and administrators are\nurged to review the indicators of compromise at the end of this post.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Lazarus (aka Nukesped) threat actor continues to target individuals involved in\ncryptocurrency exchanges. This has been a long-running theme going as far back as the\n[AppleJeus campaigns that began in 2018. Operation In(ter)ception appears to be extending](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/four-distinct-families-of-lazarus-malware-target-apples-macos-platform/)\nthe targets from users of crypto exchange platforms to their employees in what may be a\ncombined effort to conduct both espionage and cryptocurrency theft.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA 1** **Name/Description**\n\na57684cc460d4fc202b8a33870630414b3bbfafc 1st Stage, `xxx`\n\n65b7091af6279cf0e426a7b9bdc4591679420380 Crypto.com_Job_Opportunities_2022_\n\nconfidential.pdf\n\n1f0f9020f72aa5a38a89ffd6cd000ed8a2b49edc 2nd Stage, `WifiAnalyticsServ`\n\n1b32f332e7fc91252181f0626da05ae989095d71 3rd stage, `wifianalyticsagent`\n\n**Communications**\n\n```\nmarket.contradecapital[.]com\n\n```\n\n**Persistence**\n\n```\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wifianalyticsagent.plist\n\n```\n\n**File paths**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n /Library/WifiPreference/WifiAnalyticsServ.app\n\n~/Library/WifiPreference/WifiCloudWidget\n\n~/Library/WifiPreference/wifianalyticsagent\n\n~/Library/WifiPreference/Crypto.com_Job_Opportunities_2022_\n\nconfidential.pdf\n\n```\n**Labels and Bundle Identifiers**\n\n```\niTunes_trush\n\n```\n\n-----",
