By far the largest\nsponsor of these attacks is the Chinese state. This is not a new problem; it is espionage with a\ndifferent methodology.\n\nThese attacks are far from random or indiscriminate. These attacks are designed to steal\ninformation that will fulfil a clear set of requirements set by the Chinese state and furnish\nthem with political, commercial and security/intelligence information. These requirements\nare carefully and clearly identified, shared with a number of government departments and\nconstantly updated. There is evidence of worldwide targeting but only a minority of attacks\nare identified and fewer still made public.\n\nThis is a structured program and the main protagonists in China are widely believed to be\nthe Third Department of the People’s Liberation Army. Even using conservative estimates it is\nlikely that the program employs thousands of military personnel. While the military program\nmay be the most developed and sophisticated, it is likely that other parts of the Chinese\nstate and even the private sector may also be carrying out similar attacks.\n\nThere are clues to the companies and types of data most at risk. In particular the Five Year\nPlan[1] and the National Outline for Medium and Long Term S&T Development[2] give detail on\nthe areas in which China intends to excel and identifies specific technology which the\nChinese want to develop or otherwise acquire. Electronics, telecoms, manufacturing,\nextraction, energy, biotech, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, space and defence are sectors\nat the highest risk, alongside companies and services such as law and accountancy firms\nthat support them and hold their data.\n\nThe likely recipients of stolen commercial data are the 117 Chinese State Owned Enterprises\nthat dominate the economy. These companies are closely linked to the state and the\nCommunist Party which has power over strategy, senior management and even wages.\nCompanies with SOE competitors should be especially concerned about data security.\n\nTwo factors make western governments and companies more vulnerable to Chinese\ntargeted cyber attacks. Firstly, there is reluctance for governments and companies to\naccuse China directly or take any form of action for fear of either being isolated politically\nor being blocked from a lucrative developing market. Secondly, a long term reliance on\ntraditional security products such as anti-virus, coupled with a lack of education about the\nthreat, leaves businesses vulnerable to attack and unprepared for any investigations that\nare required in the aftermath of a compromise.\n\nContext has extensive experience of detecting and investigating targeted attacks and\nworking with clients to help protect their data.\n\n[1 Chinese Government Official Web Portal website](http://english.gov.cn/special/115y_index.htm)\n\n2 China International Science and Technology Cooperation website\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere have been many media reports in recent years about cyber attacks on governments\nand a variety of private sector companies. The rather ambiguous term ‘Advanced Persistent\nThreat’[3] (‘APT’) is widely used to describe any attack that appears to have compromised\ncomputers in these companies or organisations, regardless of the source or purpose of the\nattack. We prefer simply to call them ‘targeted attacks’ and leave marketing terms to one\nside. This paper is not concerned with the technical aspects of targeted attacks, it seeks\ninstead to inform readers about the full scope and nature of these attacks, the reasons why\nthey are launched and the people and policies behind their design and execution.\n\nMany reports of attacks inevitably end by asking ‘who did it?’ But the answer is rarely\nstraightforward. Western Governments usually allege the attacks come from ‘Asia’ or the\n‘Far East’, rather than risk offending the Chinese government. Large corporations are\nsimilarly vague in their descriptions of these events, for fear of harming lucrative business\narrangements. Security ‘experts’ always caution that IP addresses can be used as hop\npoints through which attackers disguise their true origins, so perhaps this could be a case of\nother countries trying to make it look as if China was the source. While this is true, if\nsomething looks, walks and quacks like a duck, it is almost always a duck.\n\nWe will not be so coy. This paper will look directly at the most prolific sponsor of computer\nnetwork exploitation attacks: China. We know other countries have implemented similar\nprograms for attacking computer networks and have seen many examples of these in our\nwork over the last few years, but our focus here is China.\n\nWe will examine various aspects of these attacks, including the nature of the information\ntargeted and the types of organisations threatened. We will consider the effort involved in\nplanning, executing and managing these attacks; and assess the information products they\ngenerate, in order to understand the scale of human involvement and the government\npolicies that sponsor information theft via targeted attacks. With all this in mind we will then\npostulate on where the stolen information goes and how it may be used.\n\n3 Advanced Persistent Threat has recently become a catch all term for targeted attacks\nagainst computer networks and is often used to describe the malware. In fact, the term was\nfirst coined by the United States Air Force in 2006, specifically to refer to China – without\nactually saying China. ‘Advanced’ because the attackers could use a variety of attacks to\nget access to a network and could raise their game to use zero day vulnerabilities if\nnecessary; ‘Persistent’ because the attacks would not stop until the attacker had achieved\ntheir objectives; and ‘Threat’ because this attack was not automated like a botnet, but was\nconducted by humans who adapt and evolve their methods to evade defences.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## Categorising Attacks\n\nMany commentators have divided the targets of attacks into four categories: political,\neconomic, technical and military. This works as a general model, but focuses on the target\nof the attack as a whole rather than considering the type of information the attacker seeks\nto steal. If a criminal gang unleashes a phishing attack aimed at harvesting banking\ncredentials and it is the employees of a butchers shop and a bakery that fall victim to it, that\ndoes not mean the attack was targeting bread and meat.\n\nBearing this in mind, we divide target areas into the following categories: \n\nPolitical. The information targeted will inform the state on the political positions of\nother governments on a range of issues, including economics, trade and human\nrights. Typical targets are government departments, embassies, trade bodies, NGOs,\nand international political groups such as the UN, G20, World Bank and IMF. \n\nCommercial. The information targeted will be of value to the private sector within\nthat country (even if the lines between private and public sectors are blurred). It may\ninclude IPR, product designs, negotiating positions for sales discussions, mergers and\nacquisitions information and strategic plans (particularly in relation to the attacking\ncountry). \n\nIntelligence. The information targeted here will be used to safeguard internal security\nby the attacker country (this may entail intimidation or close monitoring of minority or\nopposition groups or individuals) and to enable analysis of the military technology,\ncapabilities and intentions of other countries.\n\nThere are a number of major problems that need to be overcome when seeking a\ncomplete understanding of the scale and purpose of attacks. Many will never be detected,\nthose that are may not always be reported; and the vast majority are not investigated by\nprofessionals with a good understanding of these types of attack. Dealing with the technical\naspects of the compromise alone is not enough: the victim needs to know why they were\nbeing attacked, by whom, what data was stolen and where it may go.\n\nWhile government agencies, such as the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure[4]\n(CPNI) in the UK and the FBI5 in the US, are working successfully with larger organisations to\nidentify potential threats, reduce the risk of successful attacks and in some cases to identify\nand investigate specific compromises, this assistance is not available to every company. It is\nnot generally available to those that need it the most – companies that innovate and excel\nin niche areas and supply technology or products that other companies make use of in\nlarger projects. These companies live and die by the success of their research and\ndevelopment, but often lack the budgetary resources or expertise required to adequately\nprotect their networks from this type of threat.\n\nEven when compromises are investigated by companies that understand the attackers and\ntheir motives, it is often not felt to be in the interests of either party to publish the findings of\nthose investigations, or to share the results with the affected company’s competitors, who\n\n4 [http://www.cpni.gov.uk](http://www.cpni.gov.uk/)\n\n5 [http://www.fbi.gov/](http://www.fbi.gov/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nmay be suffering from similar attacks. There is also a widespread lack of understanding of\ntargeted attacks among IT staff, a lack of dedicated IT security personnel and, sometimes as\na consequence of IT functions being outsourced, an over-reliance on traditional security\nproducts such as anti-virus and firewalls – both of which are ineffective against even lower\nend targeted attacks. The pressure exerted on IT staff from the business is primarily\nconcerned with service uptime and availability rather than security; and budgets for even\nroutine security operations such as penetration testing are under constant pressure. It is a\nsad fact that, for many businesses, money for IT security only becomes available once a\nserious problem has been identified, by which time it is often too late.\n\nOne more common problem in private sector companies is that some managers take the\nattitude that they would prefer not to know about security problems. Information\nTechnology departments may worry that commissioning a detection exercise to find\ncompromised hosts in their environment, could reveal a series of attacks and the theft of\ndata, which might not be good for their career prospects. Higher up the management\nchain, board members may even choose not to spend money on security on the grounds\nthat this will affect profitability and perhaps the size of their salaries or bonuses. They may\ninstead prefer to postpone any major spending on security until they absolutely have to.\n\n### Why Cyber?\n\nClearly, the Chinese government is keen to understand the political decisions taken by other\ncountries and the activities of opposition groups within China, so it is hardly surprising that it\norchestrates the compromise of computers via emailed Trojan attachments or links to\ncompromised websites on a large scale. This is nothing new; just traditional espionage with a\nnew methodology.\n\nUntil recently China, like most other developed countries, would have hand-picked\nintelligence officers from universities and the military, trained them in the arts of developing\nrelationships, recruiting agents and how to covertly gather information to pass back to\nBeijing. They would have been deployed to embassies overseas or under a business cover.\n\nThe arrival of the Internet did not sound the death knell for human spying, it simply offered\nan attractive alternative. Moving espionage operations into the virtual world brings some\nadvantages. Firstly, it does not require anyone to be sent overseas. This is an important\nchange for the governments of communist countries, naturally suspicious of the long term\nintentions of even their most trusted officials. It means there is less need to invest in lengthy\ntraining processes. Instead, hacking operations can be broken down into simple tasks and\npartly automated to minimise the need for operators with advanced technical skills.\nConducting these operations is cheap and carries a lesser risk than human espionage: even\nif the target is fairly certain as to the origin of an attack, the sponsoring government can\nclaim to be a victim of mistaken identity or of a western conspiracy.\n\nBut the key benefit of this type of espionage is that any piece of information stored\nanywhere in the world on a computer or a network connected to the Internet is only a few\nclicks away from being stolen. There are even attacks that are designed to jump to\ncomputers not connected to the Internet. If the prize is great enough and the attacker is\ndetermined enough, there is always a way.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n How Cyber?\n\nThis paper is not concerned with ‘how’ the attacks happen, which is a subject for a white\npaper in its own right. Typically however, the attackers target the desktops and laptops of\nthe victim’s organisation and send emails with an attachment containing an exploit, (often\nan Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office document) that is targeted at one person. Once the\nvictim opens the attachment the exploit executes, typically downloading and automatically\ninstalling a Trojan, which the attacker can then use to access the victim’s system. The\nattackers also utilise website vulnerabilities which exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers such\nas Internet Explorer or Firefox to download malicious code onto a machine when a user\nclicks on a link in an email. Once the attacker has this foothold on the network, they\ntypically look to download and use further hacking tools to escalate privileges to gain\nadministrative access to key internal servers such as Domain Controllers or File Servers. Once\nachieved, the attackers typically use another remote desktop or laptop on the network to\ncollate the data stolen and exfilitrate it to their remote servers.\n\nIn the case that a network is fully patched and constitutes a hard target, the attackers can\nrespond and raise their game substantially. This could include exploiting a zero day\nvulnerability[6] or employing other means of installing an implant, such as using physical\naccess to introduce an attack or even attacking a supply chain.\n\n### The Targets\n\nDespite opening up greatly over the last 15 years, China is still very much run by the\nCommunist Party. The Party has control over and involvement in every area of daily life, but\ndespite the internal focus, China is careful to keep an eye on the outside world and how the\ncountry’s institutions and companies are perceived by foreign governments. An\nunderstanding of other countries’ political positions on key issues that affect China is key to\nforward planning, especially for an economy built on cheap exports.\n\nThe governments in which the Chinese state is most interested fall into three groups: its\nnearest neighbours: Japan, Taiwan, the disputed (semi-autonomous) Tibet, Mongolia and\nthe Muslim ‘Stans’ to the west; other powerful states with international influence such as the\nUS, Russia, the UK, Germany, France and India; and finally states with strong economic links\nto China including Brazil, Iran, Australia, parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nWhilst China will not be interested in the entire spectrum of government affairs in each of\nthese countries, there will be some interest in some parts of all these governments’ activities.\nGathering information on this scale is a massive task: monitoring relevant issues, identifying\nindividuals with access to that information and crafting attacks in the appropriate form and\nlanguage.\n\nThe other constant preoccupation of the Chinese government is the maintenance of\ninternal and external security. The enemies of the internal state are referred to as the ‘Five\nPoisons’: the separatist Uighurs (a mainly Muslim group in Northeast China), Tibetan\nseparatists, pro-democracy supporters, supporters of an independent Taiwan and followers\nof the religious group Falun Gong. Keeping tabs on these groups and on their known\nsupporters at home and overseas is another huge task. The Ministry of State Security monitors\n\n6 A zero day vulnerability is one which is not publicly known and for which no patch exists.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nthe communications between individuals and groups, a task made considerably easier\nthrough the deployment of Trojans to compromise computer equipment. As a minimum,\nsecurity services would usually seek to steal email account login and password details in\norder to be able to log in remotely and read emails. Google has confirmed this activity was\ntaking place on the Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents.[7]\n\nChina wants a clear picture of other countries’ military activities in order to inform its own\ntactical and strategic decisions. Human penetrations of foreign military organisations are\nextremely difficult and carry significant risks, so relatively passive email attacks are an\nexcellent substitute activity, where no single incident can be seen as an act of aggression\nmeriting a military response. It remains to be seen whether thousands of attacks conducted\nover a long period of time will come to be regarded as having been a provocative act\nwarranting a military response.\n\nWhile China has been publicly – albeit mostly not directly – accused of carrying out attacks\nagainst governments, military organisations and military contractors numerous times, there\nare also plenty of examples of private sector organisations being targeted. Several stand\nout from the last few years: the ‘Aurora[8]’ attacks that hit Google, Adobe, Juniper, Northrup\nGrumman and others; the McAfee-dubbed ‘Night Dragon[9]’ attacks that struck companies\naround the world in the energy sector; and the ‘Shady RAT[10]’ attacks that affected the steel\nindustry, heavy engineering, construction and communications companies and others.\n\nInterestingly, despite reporting on the intrusions, McAfee does not highlight the fact that antivirus software did little to stop the attacks in the first place. In all likelihood all these various\n‘operations’ formed part of the same attack, with different groups or military units carrying\nout operations sponsored by the Chinese state. One attack that was clearly carefully\nplanned, and equally linked to the others, was that conducted against RSA[11], whereby\nattackers stole information which allowed them to replicate the SecurID tokens used by\ncompanies to authenticate individuals logging onto their networks from remote locations.\n\nArmed with those stolen credentials, an attacker would be able to log in to company\nnetworks as if a real user. The full extent of this breach has not been publicly disclosed,\nthough we do know that Lockheed Martin was attacked and we can speculate that other\ndefence contractors were also targeted. As full details of what was stolen have never been\nput into the public domain, we can only guess at the targeted information. Google claimed\nIntellectual Property had been stolen, though no further details were given. But these\ncompanies were all targeted for a reason. Data was identified that would somehow be of\nuse to China. We will look at who laid out the requirements for this data next.\n\n7 [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html)\n\n[8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora)\n\n[9 http://www.mcafee.com/ca/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-](http://www.mcafee.com/ca/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf)\n[night-dragon.pdf](http://www.mcafee.com/ca/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf)\n\n[10 http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf)\n\n11 [http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=3872](http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=3872)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## The Requirements \n\nWe should never think of Chinese cyber attacks as\nuncoordinated, random or indiscriminate. They target\ncompanies, governments or individuals because a specific\nrequirement has been identified. Context has studied a\nnumber of Chinese government policies, documents and\nstated aspirations, as well as Chinese commercial structures,\nwhich may show why targets may have been picked; and\nmay also help companies to gauge whether their business\nshould consider itself to be at risk of being targeted by a\nChinese attacker.\n\nThe key documents are the Five Year Plan and the National\nOutline for Medium and Long Term S&T Development. We\nwill also theorise around the (unwritten) intelligence\nrequirements. We will then later investigate China’s state-owned enterprises as potential\ngenerators of requests for material to be stolen via targeted attacks; and as consumers of\nstolen data.\n\nThe Five Year Plan is a series of development initiatives, both social and economic, that set\nhigh level goals for where the Communist Party would like to see the country in five years’\ntime. The latest Plan was finalised in October 2010 and applies to the period 2011 – 2015. It\ncontains goals for urbanisation rates and targets for economic growth; details the foreign\nindustries that will be invited to do business in China, the scale of proposed construction\nprojects and areas of the country/economy where further development should be\nencouraged. These high level goals filter down to all government departments at national,\nregional and local level, where individual initiatives are managed. But the plan also hints at\nthe areas where China feels it needs to concentrate its efforts, or where it needs to catch up\nwith other countries elsewhere in the world.\n\nHowever, targeted attacks are ‘state sponsored’, which means that it is not the government\nthat conducts the attack, but departments of the state or affiliated groups. When the\ngovernment decides that, for example, it requires intelligence relating to US military\noperations in Afghanistan, different parts of the state intelligence apparatus will respond to\nthis requirement, each bringing different skill sets to bear on the problem of finding the\nrequired information. For example, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has departments with\naccess to satellite photography, which could provide information on troop movements.\nAnother department may have access to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), which intercepts\ncommunications. Chinese diplomats in the country will speak with their Afghan counterparts\nabout the situation, while intelligence officers, perhaps in diplomatic or even non-official\nroles, are able to exploit human agents with access to useful reporting. To complement all of\nthese sources, cyber attacks can be used against a variety of targets such as the Pentagon,\nmilitary forces in theatre, the US embassy, defence contractors and representatives of the\nUN and NATO. As cyber proves its worth (if it hasn’t already) other parts of the government\nwill seek to develop their own cyber capability to add to their existing capabilities, not\nwishing to be outshone by competing departments.\n\nOne of the points on the Five Year Plan for instance is ‘More efficient development of\nnuclear power under the precondition of ensured safety’, which could suggest that any\ninformation gathering attacks against the nuclear energy industry (as opposed to sabotage\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nor Stuxnet[12] style attacks) could be carried out with the express intention of supporting this\npart of the Plan.\n\nThe attacks could be directed against nuclear plants themselves in an attempt to obtain\noperating information; construction companies, to steal building plans (which may also be\nof value to the military in case of war); regulatory bodies for rules, policies and procedures;\nand any of the hundreds of companies that build parts for the plant or develop technology\nused in the nuclear process.\n\nIn terms of who could be carrying out the attacks, we have to consider not only the military\n(the Third Department of the PLA has the remit for cyber operations, though other areas are\nlikely to have some capability too), but also nuclear construction companies, the\ngovernment department with a remit for the energy industry, or any of the hacking groups\nthat are closely affiliated to the state. Different campaigns may even be competing to steal\nthe same information with the rewards going to the attackers who get it first.\n\nThe Plan also advocates the development of high-end manufacturing, hi-tech industry,\nmodern agriculture, high-speed rail and hydropower. The Plan does not explain in any detail\nhow this development will be achieved, although in some cases it does specify that certain\nareas will be prioritised for direct foreign investment. In these cases, foreign firms are invited\nto partner with local firms to complete a project and engage in ‘technology transfer’. This\nmeans (officially) that the Chinese company will learn skills from the foreign company and\ndevelop their own capabilities in the area. Unofficially, it generally ends up with the foreign\ncompany having its IP and technology stolen and then finding that it no longer has an\ninvitation to do business in the country.\n\nOne good example of technology transfer can be seen in the area of high speed railways.\nOriginally, trains were purchased from Kawasaki, Siemens and Bombardier and these\nmanufacturers helped create the first high speed lines which opened in 2007. Soon\nafterwards China started to build its own high speed trains, modelled on those imported, but\nwith reconfigured components. There is an ongoing legal case brought by Kawasaki and\nother Japanese companies relating to Chinese companies attempting to patent Kawasaki\ntechnology associated with high speed rail[13]. The current Chinese patent laws specify that\nthe owner of a patent registered in China must be Chinese and that the Chinese holder will\nalso be favoured over any foreign claim for the same technology.\n\nIn July 2011 two high speed trains collided near Wenzhou, killing (according to state media)\n40 people. There were concerns that the trains contained stolen foreign technology and it\nhas been suggested that this is why the wreckage was buried even before the rescue\noperation had been completed. It has also been suggested in certain quarters that burying\nthe wreckage stopped any investigation by the manufacturers into what went wrong (and\nwhether or not there was stolen technology present). This action attracted widespread\ncriticism of the government, even from some sources within China.\n\n12 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11388018](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11388018)\n\n13 [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704814204575507353221141616.html](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704814204575507353221141616.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## Boosting Domestic Enterprise\n\nIf the Five Year Plan is short on detail, the National Outline for Medium and Long Term S&T\nDevelopment is not. This policy essentially sets out the requirement for ‘Indigenous\nInnovation’, the areas where China should not rely on western technology, but should\ndevelop a home-grown alternative. The strong desire for domestic products stems from two\nissues. Firstly a suspicion that foreign technology could be used covertly in ways for which it\nwas not originally intended it would be used (for the benefit of the attacking country).\nSecondly because in order to sustain high growth rates and satisfy domestic consumption it\nis better if China manufactures products of equal capability and sells them to its own market\nthan it is to import goods at high prices. The plan for Indigenous Innovation drills down into\neach of the areas where China wants to develop a capability in some detail, even setting\nout priorities. The list of eleven areas comprises: \n\n**Energy. Oil and gas exploration, distribution and power grids, low cost renewable**\nenergy, coal liquefaction, industrial energy efficiency \n\n**Water and Mineral Resources. Distribution, conservation, desalination, zoning and**\ndevelopment of resources \n\n**Environment. Pollutant control and recycling, restoration of vulnerable ecosystems,**\nmaritime ecosystem protection, environmental change \n\n**Agriculture. Genetic resource development, disease prevention, use of agro-forest**\nbiomass, multifunctional farming equipment, modern dairy industry \n\n**Manufacturing Industry. Basic/generic parts/components, digital intelligent design,**\nrecycling iron and steel, marine engineering technology, engineering processes for\nthe defence industry \n\n**Transportation. Construction and maintenance technology, high speed rail, energy**\nefficient cars, traffic control systems, alternative fuel based cars \n\n**Modern Service Industry. Next generation Internet technology, high performance**\ncomputers, digital media content platforms, HD displays \n\n**Population / Health. Treatment of diseases, medical processes **\n\n**Urbanisation. Green buildings, architectural energy efficiencies **\n\n**Public Security. Security warning systems, bio-safety measures **\n\n**Defence. [Classified]**\n\nIn addition to these areas, which already contain a lot of areas that targeted western\ncompanies operate in, there is a further list of 16 ‘Major Special Projects’. These projects are\nintended to add to the overall strength of China. Previous examples of such projects include\nthe development of the hydrogen bomb, launching satellites, manned space flights and\nhybrid rice. They are intended also to be a source of national pride. If one can see the\npotential for cyber attack to enhance many of the areas outlined above, the list below\ngives even more scope for the targeted theft of data from companies and governments\naround the world: \n\nCore electronic components, high-end general use chips and basic software\nproducts \n\nLarge-scale integrated circuit manufacturing equipment and techniques\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nNew generation broadband wireless mobile communication networks \n\nAdvanced numeric-controlled machinery and basic manufacturing technology \n\nLarge-scale oil and gas exploration \n\nLarge advanced nuclear reactors \n\nWater pollution control and treatment \n\nBreeding new varieties of genetically modified organisms \n\nPharmaceutical innovation and development \n\nControl and treatment of AIDS, hepatitis, and other major diseases \n\nLarge aircraft \n\nHigh-definition earth observation system \n\nManned spaceflight and lunar probe programs \n\nClassified military projects (x3)\n\nIf we take the Major Special Projects as a Chinese technology wish list, we can assume there\nare two different methods that could be used to achieve these goals. The first involves\nfunding research programmes in universities and companies, educating people over the\nlong term and encouraging a culture of research, development and innovation and an\nacceptance that achievements in some areas will fall short of expectation.\n\nThe second way of viewing the challenge is that much of this technology already exists in\nthe rest of the world, is already proven and is (relatively) easy to obtain. Far easier to steal\nthe work of others, re-engineer it, improve it if practicable and necessary and be seen to be\ncontributing to the progression of the Chinese state; and to do so may also be personally\nrewarding for members of the Party. Failure to achieve these goals would almost certainly\nbe seen as unacceptable.\n\n### At Risk\n\nThe companies that generate the target information are not the only ones at risk. We can\nalso assume that the companies that support these areas – lawyers, sub-contractors,\noutsourced suppliers and any government departments with links to these firms, would also\nbe attacked as part of an effort to find supporting information.\n\nSo long as the product is intended for domestic consumption only, in many cases there are\nminimal problems for the company targeted to have to face. Many firms would be unwilling\nor unable to sell their products into China anyway – either because of a lack of global\ndistribution networks, or because of export restrictions, in the case of sensitive military\ntechnologies, so the sale of an identical, stolen product would not directly harm their\nbusiness.\n\nFor example, a company that makes hi-tech export controlled widgets for the US military is\nunlikely to be able to sell its product in China to the Chinese military. In any case, the\nChinese military would probably prefer to buy a Chinese product. If the widget designs are\nstolen and a Chinese company makes the exact same widget, protected by a Chinese\npatent, the end product could be sold to the PLA. While the original manufacturer may\nrightly be concerned by this, the company would not suffer financially. Until, that is, the\nproduct made by the Chinese firm is offered for sale around the world at a much cheaper\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nprice than that for which the original product is sold, because the Chinese firm has not\nneeded to fund R&D. At this point, buyers who simply want a widget that works will buy the\ncheaper one.\n\nThe National Outline document goes on to specify ‘Frontier Technologies’: areas such as\nbiotech, IT, advanced materials and manufacturing technologies, energy and marine\ntechnology, lasers and (again) aerospace, all areas in which the West has traditionally\nexcelled and China has lagged behind.\n\nThe other key area that could lead to a requirement for cyber attacks is China’s\nintelligence-gathering operation. This area is primarily controlled by the Party rather than the\nintelligence services themselves. Requirements in this area are likely to incorporate generic\ntasks to infiltrate and disrupt the activities of the Five Poisons (see above), to gather military\nsecrets from overseas and highlight politically useful information. That could be, for example,\nintelligence on economic policies of the Eurozone countries regarding China, NATO plans\nfor Afghanistan, international efforts to negotiate with North Korea or reports into human\nrights abuses.\n\nThe intelligence services will use all of their sources – HUMINT, SIGINT and cyber – to address\nthese requirements. As the list is never published we can only guess at what it contains, but\none may speculate that if intensive investigations focused on the detection of cyber attacks\nagainst the Five Poisons (the GhostNet[14] report was an excellent start), it is likely that the\nsame malware and infrastructure would be revealed to have been deployed.\n\n14 [http://www.scribd.com/doc/13731776/Tracking-GhostNet-Investigating-a-Cyber-](http://www.scribd.com/doc/13731776/Tracking-GhostNet-Investigating-a-Cyber-Espionage-Network)\n[Espionage-Network](http://www.scribd.com/doc/13731776/Tracking-GhostNet-Investigating-a-Cyber-Espionage-Network)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## How Does it Happen?\n\nIf we consider only the Chinese cyber attacks that have been reported we are only looking\nat the tip of the iceberg. First, we tend only to see reports of British or American firms being\nattacked, and we know that only a tiny minority of incidents are reported, because firms are\neither unaware they have been attacked or are afraid that publicising an incident will\ndamage their brand, their company value or their personal careers. It is also likely that there\nis a huge number of small to medium sized enterprises around the world that have no idea\nthat their crown jewels have been stolen.\n\nGovernments are unlikely to admit having lost data or to accuse China directly, for fear of\nrisking negative political and economic consequences. Individual victims living in China will\nbe unable to complain at the intrusion to their privacy, while those outside China may have\nlittle recourse to any organisation which would take their claims seriously.\n\nTo map out the process and try to think about the scale of the attacks we must start with a\nclassic diagram of the intelligence cycle.\n\n### Setting Requirements\n\nAs we have already seen, China has no issue in identifying requirements. These lie across the\nindustrial, social and economic spectrum and represent the results of a mammoth effort to\nidentify weaknesses and areas for further development. Given that the requirements are\nlargely focussed around technical, economic and commercial development rather than\nsocial development it is fair to expect that this exercise was not conducted by government\nalone, but must have been supplemented by private sector (so far as there is one).\nHowever, the setting of requirements covers many more areas than just cyber, so it would\nnot be correct to regard this effort as having been conducted simply to support electronic\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n**Planning and Direction**\n\nThis is where things get a little bit complicated. Planning and direction activities take place\non multiple levels – at a Party level, regional level, local level, within every key government\ndepartment, inside every company with a stake in fulfilling the requirements; and especially\nwithin the military, who evidence suggests are behind the bulk of targeted attacks.\n\n**Collection**\n\nThis area covers the whole process of target\nidentification, malware development, crafting the\nattacks, designing the social engineering, initiating\nattacks, controlling implants, escalating privileges on\nthe victim network, uploading further tools to maintain\nand develop access, finding and exfiltrating data of\ninterest, and cleaning up traces of the attack to hinder\ninvestigations.\n\nIt also requires infrastructure (owned or stolen) to be\nconstructed to support the attack, IP addresses or\ndomain names updated into the implants, training of\noperators, language skills, management and some\nform of quality control process to enable some visibility\nover how well attacks are progressing.\n\nWhile much of the attack process can be automated\nor simplified so it can be delegated to less technically\nadept operators, the scale of the attack is such that\nmany skilled hackers will be needed in an advisory capacity, to conduct manual elements\nof the attack, to maintain a development program and, in some cases, to share details of\nthe latest attack vectors and vulnerabilities with those tasked with cyber defence to protect\nChinese systems from similar attacks. There will also almost certainly be an administration\nprocess that logs attacks and targets, collates information on target systems, feeds data into\nsome form of risk assessment and ensures that all ongoing attacks are focussed on the\nattainment of a specific requirement. This is no small operation.\n\n**Processing and Exploitation**\n\nIf 1,000 attacks are successful and all result in large amounts of data being stolen from\ncompromised systems, that data needs to be put into a readable format (and decrypted if\nnecessary), made searchable, stored in a database and translated into Chinese – and all\nthese operations have to be carried out in bulk and in real time or something close to it, to\nallow that information to be used as quickly and effectively as possible. Of course, the\nactual number of active compromises at any one time is likely to be many magnitudes\nhigher than 1,000!\n\n**Analysis and Production**\n\nThe first problem with analysing bulk amounts of data translated from other languages is\nthat machine translation is often of low quality, particularly for data such as emails written\nusing more colloquial terms. The second issue is that a large proportion of the stolen\ndocuments is likely to be of a highly technical nature: If you steal documents from a widget\nmaker then you need at least a basic knowledge of widgets to be able to understand the\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\npotential value of a document and how best to exploit it. If there is a lot of widget data you\nwill need a lot of widget specialists or risk the data being out of date by the time it is\nanalysed. And just because someone understands widgets doesn’t mean that they\nunderstand gizmos, so another team will be required to look at that data – and so on. These\nanalysts will provide feedback to operators, perhaps saying ‘get more’, or ‘this is no good,\nget something else’. They may also provide search terms for documents. All this analysis will\nthen need to be written up into reports which should try to protect the source of the\ninformation.\n\n**Dissemination**\n\nIf the information is to be useful the reporting process has to be fast, in order to get useful\ninformation to the right people. Dissemination of intelligence reports to security and\nintelligence officers should be straightforward as all people in the process will have\nclearances. But we can assume (although there are no guarantees) that this information is\nhighly classified and dissemination is carefully controlled, which makes disseminating it to\ngovernment officials a little more difficult, especially if those officials are based outside\nBeijing, because encrypted links or maybe a network of trusted couriers will be required to\ntransport the reports.\n\nThe most difficult task will be delivering reports on commercial or technical development to\nthe right people. The most trusted individuals will be at the top of organisations, probably as\na result of their loyalty to the Party, but these are not necessarily the people able to\nunderstand, interpret and exploit the information contained within the report. So the report\nor elements of it must be passed downwards to those who do understand it. This means a\nsignificant increase in the number of people who are aware, which represents a significant\nrisk. The Party must also decide to which companies it will pass information – if five\ncompanies all produce widgets do you give the information on next generation widgets to\none of them, or all of them? We will look at one way the Party addresses this issue below.\n\nGetting the dissemination right should in turn generate more requirements and help to\ncreate a more refined requirement to feed back into the process and drive the next data\nacquisition cycle.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## The Scale of the Operation\n\nMost authorities attribute responsibility for cyber attacks and intelligence gathering to the\nThird Department of the PLA (3PLA) and accept that the Second Department (2PLA) may\nalso have a role to play. Accurate figures for the size of these Departments are not publicly\navailable, but the more success the attackers have, the more funding they are likely to get\nfor further attacks. Other branches of the military may then see the possibility for increased\nfunding and political glory by competing in the same space. One very thorough report by\nProject 2049[15], a group who analyse the Asian security landscape among other topics,\ndetails the Third Department of the PLA and outlines their broader activities and structure.\nTheir role is primarily SIGINT aimed at intercepting radio, telecoms and email\ncommunications and reporting the content as intelligence. The report contains a figure\n(though they make clear this is estimated) of 130,000 people being part of the 3PLA. The\n2PLA is concerned with Human Intelligence (HUMINT) as well as SIGINT to support its military\nintelligence mission.\n\nSo trying to work out how many people are involved in this process is only ever going to be\nbased on educated guesswork. If we look simply at the effort in the 3PLA, put aside all other\ngroups for now and take the figure of 130,000 as true, there is a very large pool of available\npersonnel who are able to support cyber operations. However, as we have stated above,\nthe 3PLA has a remit broader than simply cyber and other areas are far more established.\n\nNumbers working in the requirements capture and planning area are probably in the low\nhundreds. Trying to gauge the size of the collection effort is difficult and requires a large\nmargin of error. But it is fair to assume that several hundred people could do the target\ndevelopment work; around a hundred dedicated specialists could work on malware\ndevelopment (with the Chinese hacking community providing new tools at regular\nintervals); perhaps one or two thousand low level operators (the ‘B’ team) supported by\nanother few hundred with more advanced skills (the ‘A’ team) who look after the most\nsensitive intrusions; an infrastructure team of a few dozen; and an operational security team\nof a few dozen more.\n\nThen come the processing and analysis experts: potentially a pool of several thousand\nspecialists able to read and write in a wide variety of languages; hundreds if not thousands\nof specialists in all of the fields of information being stolen – politics, economics, engineering,\nIT, science, etc; hundreds of report writers; dozens of people processing data; and dozens\nmore administering the whole process.\n\nIf these very rough figures are anywhere close to reality, at least 7,000 people are directly\ninvolved in hacking foreign computer networks for the Chinese military and processing the\noutput of those attacks. Potentially many thousands more see the reporting and are aware\nof the sorts of results generated by these operations.\n\n[15http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf](http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## Profiting from the Product\n\nSo who is most likely to profit from the information being gathered through these attacks?\nThe political, economic and intelligence reporting has a clear audience, but deciding who\nthe commercial intelligence should be passed to presents a more taxing problem. Which\ncompanies receive this kind of assistance? The answer may lie in the particular brand of\ncapitalism which China\npractices.\n\nChina is no longer the\nplanned economy it once\nwas and some Chinese\ncompanies are now among\nthe largest in the world. But\nthis is not capitalism as we\nknow it and these companies\nare far from being truly\n‘private’. All the largest\ncompanies in China are State\nOwned Enterprises (SOEs) in\nwhich the state is the largest\n(or only) shareholder. The\nstate can and does change company board members at will and members of the armed\nforces are routinely brought into senior management roles. But in addition to simply\nappointing the heads of companies, the Party also has a final say over the strategic\ndirection of each company, business planning processes and the size of salaries paid to\nemployees. After all, if companies are seen to be profiting unfairly at the expense of the\nworkers that could lead to political unrest.\n\nThere are currently 117 companies classed as SOEs and under the control of the Stateowned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the primary shareholder\nin these companies. To give some idea of the scale of SOEs, they now comprise 80% of the\nvalue of China’s stock market. Yet in the last 10 years, the number of SOEs has almost halved\nas SASAC has pushed through mergers of companies with similar strengths to consolidate\nthe overall power of these companies in various sectors and make them more competitive\noutside China. SASAC works alongside the Communist Party’s Organisation Department,\nwhich acts as a human resources department and makes certain that those running these\nbusinesses care every bit as much (if not more) about pleasing Party bosses as they do\nabout their success in business.\n\nIn addition to the Party’s input to the strategies pursued by these companies, the state is also\ninstrumental in guiding them to financial success by other means. Most significantly it\narranges cheap lines of credit, allowing companies to borrow money for expansion; and\nprovides a ready-made market for the company – the Party has the ability to block\ncompetitors from any industry or to introduce policies which make competitors more\nexpensive. The state can also provide considerable human resources if a particular\ncompany or industry needs to increase production suddenly: large pools of labour in China\nwork for the state rather than companies and so form a mobile and flexible workforce. But if\nat the end of the day the products or services a company offers are outdated or of poor\nquality, that company will fail. The Party has a vested interest in every SOE performing well\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nand becoming a national or global champion in its sector, so it may be willing to extend\nhelp through the leveraging of intelligence sources. Note the list of companies and sectors\nin Appendix A: it is clear that the companies on the list all have interests in areas which will\nsupport the Five Year Plan and Indigenous Innovation.\n\n### Hypothetical Case Study: Aircraft Construction\n\nOne good example of how the Party could use its intelligence collection methods to benefit\nan SOE is seen in the case of COMAC[16], the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\nCOMAC is currently trying to build a large aircraft to compete with the likes of Boeing and\nAirbus. In an excellent in-depth paper on Indigenous Innovation[17], the US Chamber of\nCommerce and strategic consulting firm ACPO Worldwide[18] detail the desire of China to\nbuild an aircraft since the crash (and subsequent re-engineering) of a Pakistan Airlines\nBoeing 707 in 1971. The re-engineered plane named the Yun-10 was a complete failure as\nChina did not at that time possess all the necessary technology required to make it a\nsuccess.\n\nWith a rise in the use of air transport within China, domestic carriers are being forced to buy\nforeign aircraft at enormous cost, whereas a home-grown aircraft could be sold much more\ncheaply. The COMAC C919[19] is designed to rival the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 and\nplanned to be operating by 2015, and to encourage foreign companies to share their\ntechnology, China has promised access to the market. Companies including Parker\nAerospace, General Electric, Honeywell and Goodrich have all signed up. Whether they\nbenefit from this move in the long term, or are instead encouraged to leave once they have\nbeen bled dry of useful information, remains to be seen. But for all the help they are getting,\nChinese engineers are not yet able to access the technology developed by Boeing and\nAirbus, or by large aeroplane engine suppliers such as Rolls Royce.\n\nWe know therefore that there is intent to build a domestic airliner and that previously reengineering has been attempted. Technology transfer is ongoing at the moment, but how\n(hypothetically) could computer network exploitation attacks help China achieve its goal?\n\nIt is hard to imagine that a project of that size would not be given some assistance by the\ngovernment, given that there is national pride at stake. If intelligence or military resources\ncould be directed against Boeing and Airbus networks there would be some very quick wins.\nNot only could design documents and technical information be stolen en masse and\nwithout the need to actually deal with the company, but there could be some weak links in\nthe supply chains of these companies which would help an attacker to penetrate their\nnetworks.\n\nFirst, smaller suppliers would provide an easy target from where attacks could be launched\ndirectly, spoofing emails with Trojans to improve the chance of recipients opening them.\nSecond, both companies have facilities in China, presumably with network connectivity\nwhich may provide a direct route into the main network. There are also Chinese citizens\nworking for the two target organisations who could be tasked to download something\nnefarious or plug in a USB drive to help their country.\n\n16 [http://english.comac.cc/](http://english.comac.cc/)\n\n17 [http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/reports/100728chinareport_0.pdf](http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/reports/100728chinareport_0.pdf)\n\n18 [http://www.apcoworldwide.com/](http://www.apcoworldwide.com/)\n\n19 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comac_C919](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comac_C919)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\nFinally all large organisations share large amounts of their data with third parties such as law\nfirms and consultants; companies that may not protect their networks as effectively as the\ntarget company. These ‘data aggregators’ can present a major vulnerability in the security\nof sensitive data.\n\nThe end goal of the project is to sell the aircraft worldwide and to undercut the established\nsuppliers. COMAC could achieve this by using lines of credit at favourable rates from the\nChinese banks that would help to make deals cheaper for airlines purchasing aircraft. But\nwhat really helps these companies undercut foreign rivals is that they have not needed to\nspend huge amounts of money on R&D to get the plane off the ground in the first place.\n\nIf designs for the body of the aircraft could be stolen along with aerodynamic information it\nwould cut development time by years; and by billions of dollars. If stolen engine designs\nwere also used that would cut costs further still. Even if the companies from whom this\ntechnology had been stolen were able to see that it had been stolen, they would only be\nable to take limited action in response; and to do so could put at risk their continued ability\nto operate or sell in China.\n\nThe list of SOEs in “Appendix A” is dominated by transport companies (rail, aerospace and\nshipping), energy (petrochemical, nuclear, power generation/distribution, hydro), telecoms\n(mobile, infrastructure), manufacturing, extraction/metals (coal, iron, steel, minerals,\naluminium) and trading companies. If a company has been targeted by Chinese state\nsponsored cyber espionage, we believe that any information stolen probably ends up in\none of these SOEs. While China is able to manipulate market conditions in various ways to\nhelp SOEs prosper, nothing would contribute more to their growth and success than a supply\nof inside information about the activities of their competitors and customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis situation has not developed overnight. These attacks have been going on for years:\nmany reports detail intrusions going back to 2003 and earlier. It is quite possible that the\ntargets of early attacks were merely foreign governments and dissidents and that the range\nof targets only broadened with the opening of the Chinese economy and an increased\ndemand for intelligence to support business growth and projects of national importance.\nThe more success the attackers had, the more that demand grew. While China continues to\ncarry out cyber attacks on companies throughout the rest of the world and these attacks\ncontinue either unnoticed or unpunished, there is no incentive for China to stop. The more\nthat stolen data is exploited for the benefit of companies and the government, the greater\nthe incentive to continue with these operations.\n\nGovernments and large companies do not appear to be making much headway in solving\nthis problem. For large corporations in the West, where there is a tendency to focus more on\nthe short term and on personal achievement rather than the long term advancement of the\nstate, the potential riches which trade with China offers are so large that turning a blind eye\nto data theft may seem a reasonable price to pay. Governments dare not risk isolation from\nChina for economic and political reasons. Norway has recently been shut out of Chinese\nrelations after awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to a jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo[20]. Its\ntrade links with China are minimal, so it can afford to do this, but few other countries would\nfeel able to do the same. A combination of this reluctance to act, chronic under-investment\nin IT and a lack of user education about how to spot the warning signs of a potential attack\nmeans companies and organisations are extremely vulnerable.\n\nIn order to start rectifying the problem there is a need in the first instance to understand the\nproblem. There needs to be an acceptance that this problem is not going to go away, that\nthis is a business risk not at IT issue. Doing business with China carries extra risk in terms of data\nsecurity and traditional security products are unable to defend your data against this type\nof attack. Investigation of compromises needs to be thorough and conducted by people\nfamiliar with this problem and not simply the technical aspects of it. Above all sensitive data\nmust be segregated – it is not possible to defend everything.\n\nThe reason targeted attacks pose such a dangerous threat is that these are not viruses\nwhich simply spread and act according to a set of defined rules in the software. There are\nhuman beings directing these attacks in a much more active way. They have been given\nspecific duties and will not stop what they are doing until someone tells them to do so.\n\nIf your data is of interest today, it will still be of interest tomorrow. If you have been attacked\nonce and somehow managed to stop it, you have only stopped one instance of the attack,\nnot the attack as a whole. The malware used simply provides a foothold in the network, an\ninitial point of access through which other tools can be uploaded to allow attackers access\nover the longer term, to navigate through the network until they find the data of interest to\nthem. If one technique doesn’t work, they will adapt their methods and raise their game\nuntil they have success.\n\nIt may be that one day western governments will decide that ‘if you can’t beat them, join\nthem’ and develop similar capabilities to be used against foreign governments and\n\n20 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11505164](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11505164)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\ncompanies. We can only speculate as to how China might react to the large-scale\ntargeting of its own companies and institutions. As for now, we have limited evidence of\nlarge companies failing as a direct result of the attacks, though there seems to be\nconsensus that Chinese intrusions at least contributed to the downfall of one time telecoms\ngiant Nortel[21]. We do not yet know how many others may follow.\n\n21 [http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/15/nortel-hacking-shields-as-it-](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/15/nortel-hacking-shields-as-it-happens.html)\n[happens.html](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/15/nortel-hacking-shields-as-it-happens.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n### p p /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stolen Data\n\n## About Context\n\nContext Information Security is an independent security consultancy specialising in both\ntechnical security and information assurance services.\n\nThe company was founded in 1998.
