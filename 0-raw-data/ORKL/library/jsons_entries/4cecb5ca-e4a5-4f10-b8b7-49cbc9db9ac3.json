In the case of Wannacry, Google’s Neel Mehta was able to identify a code fragment which became the\nmost important clue in the story, and was later confirmed by further evidence, showing Wannacry as a pet project of\nthe Lazarus group.\n\nTo date, nobody has been able to find any significant code sharing between ExPetr/Petya and older malware. Given\nour love for unsolved mysteries, we jumped right on it.\n\n## Analyzing the Similarities\n\nAt the beginning of the ExPetr outbreak, one of our team members pointed to the fact that the specific list of\nextensions used by ExPetr is very similar to the one used by BlackEnergy’s KillDisk ransomware from 2015 and\n[2016 (Anton Cherepanov from ESET made the same observation on Twitter).](https://twitter.com/cherepanov74/status/879789032401719296)\n\n[The BlackEnergy APT](https://securelist.com/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/73440/) is a sophisticated threat actor that is known to have used at least one zero day, coupled with\ndestructive tools, and code geared towards attacking ICS systems. They are widely confirmed as the entity behind\nthe Ukraine power grid attack from 2015 as well as a chain of other destructive attacks that plagued that country\nover the past years.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about the BlackEnergy APT, be sure to check our previous blogs on the topic:\n\nGoing back to the hunt for similarities, here’s how the targeted extensions lists looks in ExPetr and a version of a\nwiper used by the BE APT group in 2015:\n\nExPetr 2015 BlackEnergy wiper sample\n\n\n3ds, .7z, .accdb, .ai, .asp, .aspx,\n.avhd, .back, .bak, .c, .cfg, .conf,\n.cpp, .cs, .ctl, .dbf, .disk, .djvu, .doc,\n.docx, .dwg, .eml, .fdb, .gz, .h, .hdd,\n.kdbx, .mail, .mdb, .msg, .nrg, .ora,\n.ost, .ova, .ovf, .pdf, .php, .pmf, .ppt,\n.pptx, .pst, .pvi, .py, .pyc, .rar, .rtf,\n.sln, .sql, .tar, .vbox, .vbs, .vcb, .vdi,\n.vfd, .vmc, .vmdk, .vmsd, .vmx,\n.vsdx, .vsv, .work, .xls\n\n\n.3ds, .7z, .accdb, .accdc, .ai, .asp, .aspx, .avhd, .back, .bak, .bin, .bkf, .cer,\n.cfg, .conf, .crl, .crt, .csr, .csv, .dat, .db3, .db4, .dbc, .dbf, .dbx, .djvu, .doc,\n.docx, .dr, .dwg, .dxf, .edb, .eml, .fdb, .gdb, .git, .gz, .hdd, .ib, .ibz, .io, .jar,\n.jpeg, .jpg, .jrs, .js, .kdbx, .key, .mail, .max, .mdb, .mdbx, .mdf, .mkv, .mlk,\n.mp3, .msi, .my, .myd, .nsn, .oda, .ost, .ovf, .p7b, .p7c, .p7r, .pd, .pdf,\n.pem, .pfx, .php, .pio, .piz, .png, .ppt, .pptx, .ps, .ps1, .pst, .pvi, .pvk, .py,\n.pyc, .rar, .rb, .rtf, .sdb, .sdf, .sh, .sl3, .spc, .sql, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .tar, .tiff,\n.vbk, .vbm, .vbox, .vcb, .vdi, .vfd, .vhd, .vhdx, .vmc, .vmdk, .vmem, .vmfx,\n.vmsd, .vmx, .vmxf, .vsd, .vsdx, .vsv, .wav, .wdb, .xls, .xlsx, .xvd, .zip\n\n\nObviously, the lists are similar in composition and formatting, but not identical. Moreover, older versions of the BE\ndestructive module have even longer lists. Here’s a snippet of an extensions list from a 2015 BE sample that is even\nlonger:\n\n\n-----\n\nNevertheless, the lists were similar in the sense of being stored in the same dot-separated formats. Although this\nindicated a possible link, we wondered if we could find more similarities, especially in the code of older variants of\nBlackEnergy and ExPetr.\n\nWe continued to chase that hunch during the frenetic early analysis phase and shared this gut feeling of a similarity\nbetween ExPetr and BlackEnergy with our friends at Palo Alto Networks. Together, we tried to build a list of features\nthat we could use to make a YARA rule to detect both ExPetr and BlackEnergy wipers.\n\nDuring the analysis, we focused on the similar extensions list and the code responsible for parsing the file system for\nencryption or wiping. Here’s the code responsible for checking the extensions to target in the current version of\nExPetr:\n\nThis works by going through the target file system in a recursive way, then checking if the extension for each file is\nincluded in the dot-separated list. Unfortunately for our theory, the way this is implemented in older BlackEnergy\nvariants is quite different; the code is more generic and the list of extensions to target is initialized at the beginning,\nand passed down to the recursive disk listing function.\n\n\n-----\n\ninteresting strings that we put together into a cohesive rule to single out both BlackEnergy KillDisk components and\nExPetr samples. The main example of this generic code is the inlined wcscmp function merged by the compiler’s\noptimization, meant to check if the filename is the current folder, which is named “.”. Of course, this code is pretty\n**generic and can appear in other programs that recursively list files. It’s inclusion alongside a similar extension list**\nmakes it of particular interest to us –but remains a low confidence indicator.\n\nLooking further, we identified some other candidate strings which, although not unique, when combined together\nallow us to fingerprint the binaries from our case in a more precise way. These include:\n\nexe /r /f\n\nComSpec\n\nInitiateSystemShutdown\n\nWhen put together with the wcscmp inlined code that checks on the filename, we get the following YARA rule:\n\nC++\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n\nrule blackenergy_and_petya_similarities {\n\nstrings:\n\n//shutdown.exe /r /f\n\n$bytes00 = { 73 00 68 00 75 00 74 00 64 00 6f 00 77 00 6e 00 2e 00 65 00 78 00 65 00 }\n\n//ComSpec\n\n$bytes01 = { 43 00 6f 00 6d 00 53 00 70 00 65 00 63 00 }\n\n//InitiateSystemShutdown\n\n$bytes02 = { 49 6e 69 74 69 61 74 65 53 79 73 74 65 6d 53 68 75 74 64 6f 77 6e 45 78 57}\n\n//68A4430110           push     0100143A4 ;’ntdll.dll’\n\n//FF151CD10010          call     GetModuleHandleA\n\n//3BC7              cmp     eax,edi\n\n//7420              jz     …\n\n$bytes03 = { 68 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 ff 15 ?? ?? ?? ?0 3b c7 74 ?? }\n\n// “/c”\n\n$bytes04 = { 2f 00 63 00 }\n\n\n-----\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n\n$hex_string = { b9 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 8d 44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 11 75 1e 66\n\n85 d2 74 15 66 8b 50 02 66 3b 51 02 75 0f 83 c0 04 83 c1 04 66 85 d2 75\n\nde 33 c0 eb 05 1b c0 83 d8 ff 85 c0 0f 84 ?? 0? 00 00 b9 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 8d\n\n44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 11 75 1e 66 85 d2 74 15 66 8b 50 02 66 3b 51 02\n\n75 0f 83 c0 04 83 c1 04 66 85 d2 75 de 33 c0 eb 05 1b c0 83 d8 ff 85 c0\n\n0f 84 ?? 0? 00 00 }\n\ncondition:\n\n((uint16(0) == 0x5A4D)) and (filesize < 5000000) and\n\n(all of them)\n\n}\n\n\nWhen run on our extensive (read: very big) malware collection, the YARA rule above fires on BlackEnergy and\n**ExPetr samples only. Unsurprisingly, when used alone, each string can generate false positives or catch other**\nunrelated malware. However, when combined together in this fashion, they become very precise . The\ntechnique of grouping generic or popular strings together into unique combinations is one of the most effective\nmethods for writing powerful Yara rules.\n\nOf course, this should not be considered a sign of a definitive link, but it does point to certain code design\nsimilarities between these malware families.\n\nThis low confidence but persistent hunch is what motivates us to ask **other researchers around the world to join**\n**us in investigating these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of ExPetr/Petya.**\nLooking back at other high profile cases, such as the Bangladesh Bank Heist or Wannacry, there were few facts\n[linking them to the Lazarus group. In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.ro/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\ntogether with high confidence. Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots, or, disproving these theories.\n\nWe’d like to think of this ongoing research as an opportunity for an open invitation to the larger security community\nto help nail down (or disprove) the link between BlackEnergy and ExPetr/Petya. Our colleagues at ESET have\npublished their own excellent analysis suggesting a possible link between ExPetr/Petya and TeleBots\n(BlackEnergy). Be sure to check out their analysis. And as mentioned before, a special thanks to our friends at Palo\nAlto for their contributions on clustering BlackEnergy samples.\n\n### Hashes\n\n**ExPetr:**\n\n027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745\n\n**BE:**\n\n\n-----\n\nF52869474834be5a6b5df7f8f0c46cbc7e9b22fa5cb30bee0f363ec6eb056b95\n\n368d5c536832b843c6de2513baf7b11bcafea1647c65df7b6f2648840fa50f75\n\nA6a167e214acd34b4084237ba7f6476d2e999849281aa5b1b3f92138c7d91c7a\n\nEdbc90c217eebabb7a9b618163716f430098202e904ddc16ce9db994c6509310\n\nF9f3374d89baf1878854f1700c8d5a2e5cf40de36071d97c6b9ff6b55d837fca\n\n\n-----",
