Now, with Black Friday around the corner, scam shops\nare looking to cash in on alluring discounts targeting online shoppers.\n\ne-Commerce scam shops operate as follows: the fraudsters create an online shop to\nadvertise and sell their goods, collect customers’ payment card data and personally\nidentifiable information (PII) as they unknowingly purchase faulty, counterfeit, or\nnonexistent products, and then sell that customer data on dark web marketplaces.\n\nUS and European banks have experienced a spike in e-commerce fraud linked to\nChina-based sites registered to the Chinese Registrar ename[.]net. Almost 200 of the\nnearly 600 scam sites identified by Gemini were linked to the Chinese acquiring bank\nJilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Co., Ltd.\n\nGemini Advisory has identified one group of China-based e-commerce fraudsters\ncontributing to this spike that operates hundreds of scam sites and has exposed tens of\nthousands of US and international payment card records and individuals’ PII over the\n[past six months. The full list is available upon request.](http://10.10.0.46/##section-contact-us)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Background\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, fraudsters have looked for ways to turn the tragedy to\ntheir advantage through e-commerce scams, SBA loan and stimulus fraud, and COVID-19\nrelated malware. e-Commerce fraudsters selling fake medical products, for example,\nappeared almost immediately after the pandemic began while hackers circulated interactive\nCOVID-19 tracking maps infected with malware. As the pandemic progressed, cybercriminals\nexploited the US government’s efforts to help struggling businesses and citizens by\nfraudulently procuring SBA loans and stimulus checks. Likewise, e-commerce fraudsters,\nrecognizing the profits gained from selling fake medical products, leveraged the public’s\nreduced willingness to shop at brick-and-mortar stores to expand into the sale of popular\nretail merchandise, such as clothing, shoes, handbags, kitchenware, toys, and recreational\ngoods.\n\nMore recently, Gemini learned that both US and European banks were experiencing a spike\nin e-commerce fraud linked to China-based sites registered to the Chinese Registrar\nename[.]net. Based on the common link and an analysis of the sites’ past activity, Gemini\nanalysts assess with moderate confidence that these China-based domains were not infected\nthrough Magecart attacks, but were actually malicious sites themselves that stole payment\ncard data from unwitting shoppers and then sold that data across various dark web\nmarketplaces.\n\n[Now, with major stores already signaling they will be closed on Black Friday, these scam](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/holidays/2020/10/20/black-friday-holiday-shopping-walmart-home-depot-lowes-plans/3682512001/)\nshops appear poised to take advantage of millions of shoppers expecting bargains but forced\nto turn to online shopping. Many of the scam shops pay for ads on Google and Facebook that\naim to catch shoppers’ eyes with claims of wild discounts and everything must go, going-outof-business sales. Though online shoppers may be wary of deals that appear too-good-to-betrue under normal circumstances, Black Friday gives scam shops the chance to push\nadvertising into overdrive and target online shoppers while their guard is down.\n\n## How Large-Scale e-Commerce Scam Shops Operate\n\nGemini Advisory has identified one group of China-based e-commerce fraudsters contributing\nto the spike identified by US and European banks. The group operates hundreds of scam\nsites and has exposed tens of thousands of US and international payment card records and\nindividuals’ personally identifiable information (PII) over the past six months. A list of 50 of\nthese sites can be found in Appendix A, while the full list of these nearly 600 sites is available\n[upon request. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the group reveal how similar](http://10.10.0.46/##section-contact-us)\ngroups operate and provide insights into how they can be identified.\n\nThe underlying premise of these e-commerce scams is simple: the fraudsters create an\nonline shop to advertise and sell their goods, steal customers’ payment card data and PII,\nand then sell the data on dark web marketplaces. As a result, e-commerce scams have\ngarnered particular interest from fraudsters as they allow them to earn a double profit: first\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom selling counterfeit, faulty, or nonexistent products to customers, and second from selling\nstolen payment card data and PII to cybercriminals. In the context of the criminal group\nidentified by Gemini, analysts determined the group likely recorded profits upwards of\n$500,000 in the past six months just from the sale of the stolen payment card data and PII on\nthe dark web. However, the total criminal profits are likely significantly larger based on their\nillicit sale of faulty, counterfeit, or nonexistent goods.\n\nThe China-based e-commerce fraud groups, including the group identified by Gemini, follow\nthe same pattern except they operate on a large scale with hundreds of sites. Once they have\ntheir sites up and running, some of these groups work to expand their sites’ exposure by\nbuilding a parallel presence on Facebook.\n\n**Network of Scam Sites**\n\ne-Commerce fraud groups attempt to ensnare as many victims as possible by creating a large\nnumber of scam sites offering different products for specific customers. Each site is typically\nlinked to a unique merchant name and merchant identification number (MID) to further\nobscure the link between them. Registering a new MID, however, is a complex process that\nrequires either a direct partnership with an acquiring bank or a relationship with a third-party\nmerchant company that works with a dedicated acquiring bank. Both of these organizations\nare responsible for processing credit or debit card payments on behalf of the merchant.\nGemini determined that nearly 200 of the scam sites from the identified group were linked to\nthe Chinese acquiring bank Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Co., Ltd. It is unclear,\nhowever, whether these sites’ relationship with the bank was direct or managed through a\nthird-party merchant company.\n\nFor the average customer, there is no visible link between the different sites within the\nnetwork as each appears to be a distinct, legitimate shop. The sites use Google Ads and\nsocial media advertisement campaigns to attract customers with offers for products at a\ndiscount below market deals. The sites’ advertisements almost always indicate that the deals\nare part of a limited-time sale to pressure potential customers into making a purchase. Gemini\nwitnessed other, unrelated scam sites claim they are going out of business due to the COVID19 pandemic and thus offering products at a steep discount to negate customers’ suspicion\nthat the deals may be too good to be true.\n\nGemini analysts suspect that e-commerce fraud groups are moving away from the more\npopular and more secure e-commerce platform Shopify and towards OpenCart because\nOpenCart is open source. This move allows fraudsters to avoid Shopify’s documented\npractice of monitoring for fraud and remediating fraudulent transactions. The group identified\nby Gemini, for example, used OpenCart as its e-commerce platform and relied on Cloudflare\nto hide its IP addresses for all of its sites. This cookie-cutter approach was likely taken to\nfacilitate the rapid deployment of a large number of scam sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe identified group also resorted to recycling nearly identical text for the About Us sections\nacross the hundreds of sites while using the same seven templates with slight variations in\nhow they presented menus, navigation links, and other information.\n\nImage 1: The seven website templates used by the scam merchants.\n[In a similar manner, the group applied an overlapping set of Google Analytics Tracking and](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/)\n[Facebook Pixel IDs across the scam sites. Google Analytics codes use tracking IDs with an](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/742478679120153?id=1205376682832142)\nalphanumeric string to allow an Analytics account to identify where to send data. The\n\n\n-----\n\nFacebook Pixel codes are used to report conversions, build audiences, and gain insight about\na site’s users.\n\nWhile the e-commerce fraud group sped up deployment by replicating processes across the\nscam sites, these similarities also gave Gemini analysts some of the indicators they needed\nto connect the scam sites to the criminal group. The formulaic templates and text, for\nexample, raised suspicion while the overlapping Google Analytics Tracking and Facebook\nPixel IDs created links between otherwise disparate sites.\n\n**Multi-Platform Presence**\n\nLike any good business, e-commerce fraudsters know that the key to success is strong\nmarketing. To this end, groups look to build a presence across multiple platforms to build their\nsites’ exposure and attract more customers. The group identified by Gemini, for example, has\nbeen recently making forays onto Facebook by launching pages that advertise products and\ninclude a link to the corresponding scam site. In keeping with the practice of recycling\ncontent, the scam sites and corresponding Facebook pages contained identical About Us\nsections. Of note, Gemini analysts observed a lag time between when the scam sites were\nlaunched and the creation of each site’s corresponding Facebook page, which may indicate\nthat this is a new tactic being deployed by the identified group.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 2: One of the scam merchant s Facebook pages created on September 27, 2020.\n\n**Sale of Customer Payment Card Data and PII**\n\nBeyond often selling counterfeit, low-quality, or nonexistent products, e-commerce scammers\nsteal the card payment data and PII of customers and then sell this data on the dark web\nmarketplaces. The group identified by Gemini, for example, stole customers’ payment card\ndata, cardholder and billing information, and additional PII, such as the phone number.\nCybercriminals purchase this type of payment card data to perform a range of fraudulent\nactivities and could potentially combine the information with the full phone number to conduct\ntailored phishing attacks.\n\nIt is also important to note that these e-commerce scam sites are distinct from sites infected\n[by Magecart attacks, a rising category of e-commerce fraud previously reported on by](https://geminiadvisory.io/keeper-magecart-group-infects-570-sites/)\nGemini. For e-commerce scam sites, the fraudster has created the site and then intentionally\ninjected a malicious script into that site; the script skims customers’ payment card data and\nPII. For Magecart attacks, a cybercriminal injects malicious script into an external ecommerce site without the owner of the site being aware.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic has driven more customers to purchase products online and\ngovernments to implement stimulus programs, fraudsters have capitalized on the opportunity\nby ramping up and complexifying their forms of fraud. Now, with Black Friday, holiday\nshopping, and a tight economy added to the mix, scam shops are eyeing a unique opportunity\nto concentrate advertising toward a large demographic of shoppers in search of discounts but\nless accustomed to the dangers of online shopping.\n\nMore broadly, the spike in fraud linked to China-based sites witnessed by US and European\nbanks and identified by Gemini represents one only instance of cybercriminals adapting\noperations to the unusual, changing circumstances driven by the pandemic. Gemini analysts,\nfor example, are already witnessing cybercriminals increase their interest in travel services\nfraud as governments begin to roll back travel restrictions. Ultimately though, due to the scale\nand evolving nature of the e-commerce scam sites, Gemini analysts assess with a high\ndegree of confidence that the criminal group behind the sites will likely continue to steal and\nsell payment card data and PII on dark web marketplaces.\n\n## Appendix A\n\nList of 50 scam domains identified by Gemini Advisory.
