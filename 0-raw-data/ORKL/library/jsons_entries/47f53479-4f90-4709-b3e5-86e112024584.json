Besides\n208 providing telephony services, cellular devices store and process personal information, provide\n209 enterprise connectivity, and act as the primary portal to the internet for many individuals.\n210 Phones, tablets, laptops, wearables, cellular modems in vehicles, and other industry specific\n211 equipment all have the ability to access cellular networks. The cellular infrastructure of the\n212 United States is transitioning from older 2[nd] Generation (2G) and 3[rd] Generation (3G) cellular\n213 technologies to newer 4[th] Generation (4G) technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE).\n214 LTE is now the dominant air interface technology across the United States and is seeing rapid\n215 adoption in countries across the globe.\n\n216 **1.1** **Purpose and Scope**\n\n217 The purpose of this document is to provide information to organizations regarding the security\n218 capabilities of cellular networks based on LTE technology. LTE networks are rarely deployed in\n219 a standalone fashion and instead are integrated alongside the previous generations of cellular\n220 systems - however they are out of scope for the technology overview of this document. Because\n221 2G and 3G networks are deployed alongside LTE networks, these older cellular systems are\n222 discussed within the threats and mitigations section of this document.\n\n223 The document is primarily scoped to analyzing the security of the systems traditionally owned\n224 and/or operated by a wireless provider, but also includes organizations writing firmware to\n225 operate the System on a Chip (SoC) inside of a mobile device that communicates with cellular\n226 infrastructure. The wireless providers, also known as mobile network operators (MNOs), operate\n227 the cellular LTE air interface, backhaul, core network, and portions of a user’s mobile device,\n228 including the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) hardware token and the Universal\n229 Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) software application. All of these entities will be fully\n230 described within this document.\n\n231\n\n232 The mobile device hardware, mobile operating system security (e.g., Android, Blackberry, iOS,\n233 Windows Phone), and 3rd party mobile applications are generally out of the scope of this\n234 document unless otherwise noted. This document does not analyze non-3GPP networks (e.g.,\n235 WiFi, WiMAX, 3GPP2), forthcoming 3GPP features such as device to device cellular\n236 communications and cellular internet of things (IoT), and the over-the-air (OTA) management\n237 updates to cellular platforms. Finally, the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a modern platform\n\n238 for delivering services such as Voice over LTE (VoLTE), is not included within this document.\n\n239 **1.2** **Document Structure**\n\n240 The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections:\n\n241 - Section 2 provides an overview of LTE standards and technology,\n\n242 - Section 3 details the security architecture of LTE,\n\n243 - Section 4 identifies threats to LTE networks,\n\n244 - Section 5 recommends mitigations and other methods of enhancing LTE security, and\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\n245 - Section 6 contains conclusions and future research.\n\n246 The document also contains appendices with supporting material:\n\n247 - Appendix A defines selected acronyms and abbreviations used in this publication, and\n\n248 - Appendix B contains a list of references used in the development of this document.\n\n249 **1.3** **Document Conventions**\n\n250 This document primarily uses LTE/Evolved Packet System (EPS) terminology. Therefore, those\n251 already familiar with cellular concepts from non-LTE systems and terminology may need to\n252 consult the appendix containing Acronyms and Acronyms for clarification.\n\n253 - The terms \"cell\" and \"cellular\" are used interchangeably.\n\n254 - The term \"base station\" is used as a standards agnostic term of referring to a cellular\n255 tower communicating with a mobile device, and is often used when discussing the\n256 interaction between 2G, 3G, and 4G systems. Each set of standards uses a specific term\n257 for base station, and LTE employs the term evolved Node B, which is shortened to\n258 eNodeB or eNB. eNodeB is generally used in this document, but when standards are\n259 quoted or specific cryptographic keys referenced, the term eNB may be used.\n\n260 - The term \"mobile device\" is used as a standards agnostic term of referring to the User\n261 Equipment (UE) (e.g., cellphone, tablet, cellular dongle).\n\n262 - The LTE standards heavily use the term Evolved Packet System (EPS) which is used\n263 interchangeably with \"LTE\" within this document.\n\n264 - The LTE standards heavily use the term Evolved Packet Core (EPC), which is used\n265 interchangeably with the term “core”.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n266 **2** **Overview of LTE Technology**\n\n267 A cellular network is a wireless network with a distributed coverage area made up of cellular\n268 sites housing radio equipment. A cellular site is often owned and operated by a wireless\n269 telecommunications company, internet service provider, or possibly government entity. The\n270 wireless telecommunications company, or mobile network operator (MNO), providing service to\n271 end users may own the cellular site, or pay for access to the cellular infrastructure - as is the case\n272 with mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). MNOs distribute cellular radio equipment\n273 throughout a large geographic region, and connect them back to a core network they typically\n274 own and operate. In areas receiving poor cellular service, such as inside a building, MNOs may\n275 provide a signal booster or small-scale base station directly to the end user to operate.\n\n276 Before LTE, cellular systems were modeled after the traditional wireline telephony system in\n277 that a dedicated circuit was provided to a user making a telephone call, ensuring a minimal\n278 guarantee of service. In comparison to circuit switched cellular networks of the past, LTE\n279 networks utilize packet switching. An LTE network provides consistent Internet Protocol (IP)\n280 connectivity between an end user's mobile device and IP services on the data network, while\n281 maintaining connectivity when moving from tower to tower (e.g., mobility).\n\n282 LTE is a mobile broadband communication standard defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership\n283 Project (3GPP), a worldwide standards development organization. Implementations of LTE\n284 networks are being deployed across the globe and installations continue to increase as the\n285 demand for high-speed mobile networks is constantly rising. Within TS 22.278 [9], 3GPP\n286 defines number of high-level goals for LTE systems to meet, including:\n\n287 - Provide increased data speeds with decreased latency,\n\n288 - Build upon the security foundations of previous cellular systems,\n\n289 - Support interoperability between current and next generation cellular systems and other\n\n290 data networks,\n\n291 - Improve system performance while maintaining current quality of service, and\n\n292 - Maintain interoperability with legacy systems.\n\n293 The following sections explain the fundamental concepts of LTE technology and architecture,\n294 network protocols, and the evolution of the 3GPP security.\n\n295 **2.1** **Evolution of 3GPP Standards**\n\n296 Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a 2G circuit switched cellular technology.\n297 Although GSM was not initially defined by 3GPP, 3GPP took control of the standard to\n298 maintain, enhance, and use it as a foundation to make future developments. 3GPP's first\n299 extension of GSM was the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), referred to as a 2.5G\n300 technology. GPRS was the first method of sending non-voice data over a cellular network, and\n301 was quickly followed by the Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), sometimes\n302 referred to as a 2.75G technology.\n\n303 The first voice standard defined by 3GPP was the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System\n304 (UMTS), which is a 3G circuit switched technology. Soon after the development of UMTS,\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n305 3GPP packet switched technologies were evolved into multiple variants collectively referred to\n306 as High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), which is arguably considered 3.5G, although certain\n307 mobile devices will display an HSPA connection as 4G. HSPA was created to increase data\n308 throughput on both the downlink and uplink connections.\n\n309 LTE needs to support a growing demand for higher data rates and quality of service. It also needs\n310 to be able to quickly support new advances in technology, and LTE’s packet switched foundation\n311 will make it easier to upgrade/update the technology as well as lower the complexity of the\n312 overall network. To meet these goals, LTE was introduced via 3GPP Release 8, which was\n313 frozen on December 11, 2008. All subsequent releases of LTE have built upon this baseline.\n314 3GPP defines a series of specifications dedicated to the technological requirements for LTE,\n315 known as the 36 series. 3GPP also defines a series of specifications for security, known as the 33\n316 series. Each 3GPP series is comprised of Technical Report (TR) and Technical Specification\n317 (TS) documents. For a new feature there are typically multiple approaches and possible solutions\n318 investigated within a TR. Once a single solution for the feature is agreed upon, it is standardized\n319 within a TS. This document is based on 3GPP Release 12, which was frozen on March 13, 2015\n320 [1].\n\n321 **2.2** **LTE Concepts**\n\n322 The following section describes important high level concepts and components of LTE networks\n323 that are used and discussed throughout the course of this document. One of the fundamental\n324 concepts to understand is the overall network architecture: mobile devices (UEs) connect to base\n325 stations (eNodeBs) via radio signals, and the base stations transmit and receive IP packets to and\n326 from the core network. The core ntework has a large number of entry and exit points, including\n327 the internet and connections to other cellular networks. Figure 1 illustrates these high-level\n328 concepts.\n\n329\n\n330 **Figure 1 - High-level Cellular Network**\n\n331 In contrast to earlier cellular network technologies that use a hybrid of circuit-switched\n332 technology for voice and packet-switched technology for data, LTE solely uses packet switched,\n333 IP-based technology. In the LTE architecture, voice traffic traverses the network over the data\n334 connection using protocols, such as VoLTE, which is similar to Voice Over IP (VoIP). VoLTE is\n335 being deployed with widespread adoption by MNOs in the US. MNOs may revert back to legacy\n336 circuit switched cellular networks to handle voice calls and short message service (SMS)\n337 messages by using a mechanism known as circuit switched fallback (CSFB).\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n338 **2.2.1 Mobile Devices**\n\n339 Mobile devices are the primary endpoint in cellular networks, interacting with base stations via\n340 radio signals to send and receive information. A mobile device is composed of two distinct\n341 systems: the general purpose mobile OS (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows Phone) that users interact\n342 with and the telephony subsystem used to access the cellular network. The telephony subsystem\n343 contains a distinct application processor referred to as the baseband processor, which has its own\n344 operating system used to interact with the cellular network, often developed by the cellular SoC\n345 manufacturer.\n\n346 LTE standards refer to a mobile device as the User Equipment (UE), which refers to both the\n347 terminal with the mobile operating system, baseband processor, and LTE radio, and the\n348 removable hardware token housing security-critical information used to obtain network access.\n349 This removable hardware token is colloquially referred to as the SIM card, but LTE standards\n350 use the term Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). The UICC, which is essentially a\n351 smartcard, runs a Java application known as the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM).\n352 The USIM interfaces with the cellular radio and subsequently the mobile network. The UICC\n353 contains secret cryptographic keys that are shared with the MNO before it is provisioned to a\n354 user.\n\n355 There are two distinct identifiers used in cellular networks: The International Mobile Subscriber\n356 Identity (IMSI) and the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI). The IMSI is the long357 term identity that the carrier uses to identify a subscriber. The IMEI is used to identify a specific\n358 mobile device to the network and is stored on a mobile device’s internal flash memory, although\n359 the IMEI may also be stored on the UICC.\n\n360 - **User equipment (UE): Cellular device (cell phone, tablet, LTE modem, etc) includes the**\n361 following:\n\n362 `o` **Mobile Equipment (ME): The mobile terminal without the hardware token.**\n\n363 `o` **UICC: A smart card that stores personal information, cryptographic keys, and is**\n364 responsible for running java applications that enable network access. This smart\n365 card is inserted into the ME.\n\n366 `o` **International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI): Terminal identity used to**\n367 identify the mobile device to the cellular network.\n\n368 `o` **International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI): User identity used to identify**\n369 a subscriber to the cellular network.\n\n370 In addition to the IMEI and IMSI, other identities exist in LTE, including the Globally Unique\n371 Temporary Identity (GUTI) and the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI). The GUTI\n372 can identify a UE to a network without having to send the long-term identity (i.e., IMSI). The\n373 security implications of clear-text transmission of the IMSI will be discussed in later sections.\n374 Different identities are used for various reasons, including limiting the exposure of a permanent\n375 identity, to minimize tracking of a device as it accesses multiple services on the network.\n\n376 **2.2.2 E-UTRAN**\n\n377 The Radio Access Network (RAN) has evolved over time into the Evolved Universal Terrestrial\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n378 Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN). UEs connect to the E-UTRAN to send data to the core\n379 network. The E-UTRAN is a mesh network composed of base stations. A base station, or\n380 Evolved Node B, modulates and demodulates radio signals to communicate with UEs. eNodeBs\n381 then act as a relay point to create and send IP packets to and from the core network. Cellular\n382 networks are designed to pass connectivity from one radio access device in the E-UTRAN to the\n383 next as the connected UE changes location. This seamless handoff ability allows devices to have\n384 a constant connection with minimal interruptions providing the mobility benefit of cellular\n385 networks. eNodeBs use the X2 interface to communicate with each other, primarily transmiting\n386 control signaling to allow for LTE network communication enabling UE mobility. During this\n387 handover the serving eNodeB must transfer all UE context, cellular paramaters and other\n388 information about the UE, to the receiving eNodeB.\n\n389 LTE uses a concept of named interfaces to easily identify the communication link between two\n390 endpoints. A named interface in LTE terminology, such as the X2 interface, refers to the logical\n391 link between two endpoints, and in this example two eNodeBs. Named interfaces in LTE are\n392 responsible for sending and receiving specified messages and data. These can be physically\n393 implemented in a variety of ways and multiple named interfaces can share the same physical\n394 connection. This physical connection can be a variety of network technologies such as fiber,\n395 Ethernet, microwave, satellite link etc.\n\n396\n\n397 **Figure 2 - E-UTRAN**\n\n398 Base stations come in a variety of form factors, different than a typical base station comprised of\n399 a physical cell tower and radio equipment. Small cells have a smaller form factor, transmit at\n400 lower power levels, capable of extending network coverage, and ultimately increase the capacity\n401 of the network.\n\n402 - **Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN): All of the**\n403 components providing wireless mobility.\n\n404 `o` **Evolved Node B (eNodeB or eNB): An evolved Node B, colloquially referred to**\n405 as a base station.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n406 `o` **Small Cell: Low powered base station with less range and less capacity than a**\n407 typical eNodeB, for instance Home eNodeBs (HeNB), Donor eNodeBs (DeNB),\n408 and Relay Nodes (RN).\n\n409 **2.2.3 Evolved Packet Core**\n\n410 The evolved packet core (EPC), illustrated in Figure 3, is the routing and computing brain of the\n411 LTE network. UEs receive control signals through base stations originating from the Mobility\n412 Management Entity (MME). The MME performs a large number of functions including\n413 managing and storing UE contexts, creating temporary identifiers, paging, controlling\n414 authentication functions, and selecting the Serving Gateway (S-GW) and Packet Data Network\n415 Gateway (P-GW), respectively. No user traffic is sent through the MME. The S-GW anchors the\n416 UEs for intra-eNodeB handoffs and routes information between the P-GW and the E-UTRAN.\n417 The P-GW is the default router for the UE, making transfers between 3GPP and non-3GPP\n418 services, allocating IP addresses to UEs, and providing access to the PDN.\n\n419 - **Evolved Packet Core (EPC): Routing and computing brain of the LTE network.**\n\n420 `o` **Mobility Management Entity (MME): Primary network signaling node that**\n421 does not interact with user traffic.

This graphic can serve as reference to visualize the interconnected\n448 fundamental LTE network components and may depict concepts not yet discussed. The solid\n449 lines in the diagram depict user plane traffic, while the dashed lines depict control plane traffic.\n\n\n450\n\n\n**Figure 3 - LTE Network Architecture**\n\n\n451 **2.2.4 LTE Network Topologies**\n\n452 An LTE network minimally consists of a UE, a group of cellular towers and nodes (E-UTRAN),\n453 and the core network (EPC) controlled by the MNO. The E-UTRAN is connected to the EPC via\n454 a network link known as the backhaul, from a security perspective it is important to note the E455 UTRAN and EPC are most likely in completely different geographic locations. Thus, the\n456 interfaces that link them may or may not be contained totally within the MNO’s private domain.\n457 This section will explore various operational network topologies such as fixed and deployable\n458 LTE networks.\n\n459 A fixed LTE network is a typical implementation of a cellular network utilizing multiple cell\n460 sites to provide a wide spread coverage area to a large geographic area. In this type of\n461 architecture, the core network components are generally in separate locations. The cell sites that\n462 house the eNodeBs connect to the EPC through the backhaul. The backhaul connection can be\n463 provided by a multitude of technologies (e.g., microwave, satellite, fiber, etc). An MNO would\n464 typically deploy this type of network architecture. Although LTE networks require the same\n465 functional components in order to operate effectively, the quantity and placement of these\n466 components is completely dependent on the MNO’s network design. It is possible the network\n467 operator incorporates multiple EPC components that serve critical functions as well as load\n468 balances these components to provide increased availability.\n\n469 An example of a fixed LTE network is a large region being provided network coverage with the\n470 use of many spread out cell sites housing eNodeBs all connecting back into one or multiple\n471 EPCs. Multiple eNodeBs are interconnected through the X2 interface, which is responsible for\n472 session handover from one eNodeB to next as the UE travels. Ultimately the components of the\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n473 E-UTRAN are interconnected and communicate to the EPCs through the backhaul or S1\n474 interface. There may be many to many relationships between the E-UTRANs and the EPCs to\n475 provide high availability and reliability.\n\n476 A deployable LTE network is a compact network able to be deployed in areas where no LTE\n477 coverage exists, or where coverage has been interrupted. The deployable network can be mobile\n478 and packaged in different form factors (e.g., mounted on a vehicle, trailer, backpack). These\n479 types of LTE architectures can be used to create a self-contained network or be connected to an\n480 existing LTE, or other, network. The hardware used in a deployable network is generally more\n481 compact and capable of handling only a fraction of the throughput and capacity of a fixed LTE\n482 network.\n\n483 A Cell on Wheels, or COW, is an example of a commercially available deployable LTE network.\n484 These COWs are environments that include all elements of an LTE network and are mounted on\n485 trailers or in some cases packaged onto vehicles. COWs often still need to be connected back to\n486 the core network. These types of deployable can be used to provide additional capacity to an\n487 existing network where there is an increased demand, for example a large sporting event. These\n488 can also be used where network coverage is not available, such as a natural disaster site, in order\n489 to provide first responders a means of communication. These LTE networks are commercially\n490 available and can be purchased from network equipment providers.\n\n491 **2.3** **LTE Network Protocols**\n\n492 The following protocols are used for communication over the air interface (the radio link\n493 between the UE and the eNodeB). This protocol suite is referred to as the air interface protocol\n494 stack, which is generally divided into three layers. Logically, these protocols set the foundation\n495 for all TCP/IP traffic operating above it. These protocols are:\n\n496 - Radio Resource Control (RRC) operating at layer 3;\n\n497 - Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) operating at layer 2;\n\n498 - Radio Link Control (RLC) operating at layer 2;\n\n499 - Medium Access Control (MAC) operating at layer 2; and\n\n500 - Physical Access (PHY) operating at layer 1.\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\n501\n\n502 **Figure 4 - LTE Protocol Stack**\n\n503 Each protocol within the air interface cellular stack performs a series of functions and operates\n504 on one of two logical planes: the user plane or the control plane. The user plane is the logical\n505 plane responsible for carrying user data being sent over the network (e.g., voice communication,\n506 SMS, application traffic) while the control plane is responsible for carrying all of the signaling\n507 communication needed for the UE to be connected. To make the technology evolution paths\n508 somewhat independent, the 3GPP specifications partition the cellular protocols into two strata;\n509 the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) and the Access Stratum (AS). The AS is all communication\n510 between the UE and eNodeB occurring via the RF channel. The NAS consists of all non-radio\n511 signaling traffic between UE and MME. All of a user's TCP/IP and other application traffic are\n512 transmitted via the user plane. The control plane, which is required to setup, maintain, and\n513 terminate the air interface connection between the UE and the MME, hosts the RRC protocol.\n514 The PDCP, RLC, MAC, and PHY layers form the foundation of the air interface and are part of\n515 both user and control planes. The aforementioned control and user planes operate on top of these\n516 protocols.\n\n517\n\n518 The RRC performs a variety of control tasks such as broadcasting system information,\n519 establishing a connection with the eNodeB, paging, performing authentication, bearer\n520 establishment, and transferring Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages. The PDCP performs\n521 header compression, packet reordering, retransmission, and access stratum security (including\n522 integrity and confidentiality protections). As stated in TS 33.401, all cryptographic protection,\n523 both confidentiality and integrity, is mandated to occur at the PDCP layer [5]. The RLC readies\n524 packets to be transferred over the air interface and transfers data to the MAC layer. It also\n525 performs packet reordering and retransmission operations. The MAC performs multiplexing,\n526 channel scheduling, Quality of Service (QoS) activities, and creates a logical mapping of data to\n527 the PHY layer. The PHY layer provides error management, signal processing, and modulates\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n528 data onto and off of the air interface.\n\n529 The interfaces between the components within the E-UTRAN and the EPC have their own\n530 communication protocols, not listed here.\n\n531 **2.4** **LTE Bearers**\n\n532 In LTE networks, connections must be established between endpoints before user traffic can be\n533 communicated, and these connections are called bearers. A bearer is a connection between two\n534 endpoints that contains specific information about the traffic class, bit rate, delivery order,\n535 reliability, priority, and quality of service for its connection. A bearer may span multiple\n536 interfaces. It is important to note that there are two main types of bearers: signaling radio bearers\n537 and transport bearers. Signaling radio bearers are established on the control plane in order to\n538 allow signaling communication between the UE and eNodeB, and the eNodeB and MME.\n539 Transport bearers are established along the path of the user plane in order to allow transmission\n540 of user data to its desired endpoint.\n\n541 There are three signaling radio bearers that must be established which are solely used for the\n542 purpose of transmitting RRC and NAS messages [30]:\n\n543 - **Signaling Radio Bearer 0 (SRB0): SRB0 is responsible for establishing the RRC**\n544 connection between the UE and eNodeB.\n\n545 - **Signaling Radio Bearer 1 (SRB1): SRB1 is responsible for the exchange of security**\n546 information, measurement reports, fallback parameters, and handover information.\n\n547 - **Signaling Radio Bearer 2 (SRB2): SRB2 is responsible for the transferring of**\n548 measurement information as well as NAS messages. SRB2 is always configured after the\n549 establishment of SRB1 and security activation.\n\n550 Once the SRBs are set up, the UE is connected to the core network through a specific eNodeB,\n551 and is ready to transmit and receive user data. Throughout the LTE network there are multiple\n552 connection points (UE to eNodeB, eNodeB to S-GW, etc.) that user traffic must traverse. In\n553 order for user traffic to be allowed to traverse the LTE network multiple bearers must be\n554 established. For a UE to have full network connectivity the following bearers must be established\n555 in this order [29]:\n\n556 - **Data Radio Bearer (DRB): Established between the UE and eNodeB on the Uu**\n557 interface. It allows direct user data communication between the UE and eNodeB.\n\n558 - **S1 Bearer: Established between the eNodeB and the appropriate S-GW on the S1-U**\n559 interface.\n\n560 - **E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearer (E-RAB): This is a combination of the DRB and S1**\n561 Bearer and creates a connection between the UE and S-GW.\n\n562 - **S5/S8 Bearer: Established between S-GW and the appropriate P-GW for the user data**\n563 plane.\n\n564 - **EPS Bearer: This is a combination of the E-RAB and the S5/S8 Bearer and provides**\n565 user plane connectivity from the UE to the appropriate P-GW.\n\n566 - **External Bearer: Established between the P-GW and a resource external to the EPC that**\n567 the UE needs to access, such as connectivity to the internet.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\n568 - **End-to-End Service: This is a combination of the EPS Bearer and the External Bearer**\n569 and allows user plane access from a UE to the appropriate resource that is external to the\n570 EPC.\n\n571 Throughout the UE attach process, bearers are established on an as needed basis.\n\n572 **2.5** **UE Attach**\n\n573 Before a UE can join an LTE network and access voice and data services, it must go through a\n574 procedure to identify itself to the LTE network. This process is known as the Initial Attach\n575 _Procedure and_ handles the communication of identifiable information from the UE to the LTE\n576 EPC to ensure that the UE can access the network. If the process is successful, then the UE is\n577 provided default connectivity, with any charging rules that are applicable and enforced by the\n578 LTE network. The attach process is defined by TS 23.401 and is illustrated in Figure 5 below 579 _General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for E-UTRAN access [2]._\n\n580 The Initial Attach procedure begins with an attach request from the UE to the MME via the\n581 eNodeB. This request includes the IMSI, tracking information, cryptographic parameters, NAS\n582 sequencing number, and other information about the UE. The ATTACH REQUEST is sent as a\n583 NAS message. The eNodeB then forwards the ATTACH REQUEST along with information\n584 about the cell to which the UE is connected on to the MME. For each PDN that the UE connects\n585 to, a default EPS bearer is established to enable the always-on IP connectivity for the users and\n586 the UE during Network Attachment.\n\n587 If there are specific Policy and Charging Control rules in the PCRF for a subscriber or device for\n588 the default EPS bearer, they can be predefined in the P-GW and turned on in the attachment by\n589 the P-GW itself. During attachment, one or more Dedicated Bearer Establishment procedures\n590 may be launched to establish dedicated EPS bearer(s) for the specific UE. Also during the attach\n591 procedure, IP address allocation may be requested by the UE. The MME obtains the IMEI from\n592 the UE and checks it with an EIR (Equipment Identity Register), which may verify that this UE’s\n593 IMEI is not blacklisted. The MME then passes the IMEI software version to the HSS and P-GW.\n594 Once a UE has gone through the initial attach procedure it is assigned a GUTI by the MME. The\n595 GUTI is stored in both the UE and the MME and should be used when possible instead of the\n596 IMSI for future attach procedures for the specific UE.\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\n597\n\n598 **Figure 5 - Initial Attach**\n\n599\n\n600 Once the attach procedure is successfully completed, the UE authenticates via the Authentication\n601 and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol defined in section 3.3.\n\n602\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n603 **3** **LTE Security Architecture**\n\n604 This section describes the authentication, cryptographic protection mechanisms, hardware\n605 protection mechanisms, and network protections LTE provides in further detail. A high level\n606 discussion of LTE security goals is provided within [9] and an understanding of 3GPP’s rationale\n607 for making certain security decisions and assumptions is recorded within [7]. The majority of\n608 technical security requirements are available within the primary LTE security specification –\n609 3GPP TS 33.401 – EPS Security Architecture [5].\n\n610 **3.1** **Cryptographic Overview**\n\n611 In older 2G cellular systems, the cryptographic algorithms used to secure the air interface and\n612 perform subscriber authentication functions were not publicly disclosed. The GSM algorithm\n613 families pertinent to our discussion are A3, A5, and A8. A3 provides subscriber authentication,\n614 A5 provides air interface confidentiality, and A8 is related to A3, in that it provides subscriber\n615 authentication functions, but within the SIM card. UMTS introduced the first publicly disclosed\n616 cryptographic algorithms used in commercial cellular systems. The terms UEA (UMTS\n617 Encryption Algorithm) and UIA (UMTS Integrity Algorithm) are used within UMTS as broad\n618 categories. UEA1 is a 128-bit block cipher called KASUMI, which is related to the Japanese\n619 cipher MISTY. UIA1 is a message authentication code (MAC), also based on KASUMI. UEA2\n620 is a stream cipher related to SNOW 3G, and UIA2 computes a MAC based on the same\n621 algorithm [27]. LTE builds upon the lessons learned from deploying the 2G and 3G\n622 cryptographic algorithms.\n\n623 LTE introduced a new set of cryptographic algorithms and a significantly different key structure\n624 than that of GSM and UMTS. There are 3 sets of cryptographic algorithms for both\n625 confidentiality and integrity termed EPS Encryption Algorithms (EEA) and EPS Integrity\n626 Algorithms (EIA). EEA1 and EIA1 are based on SNOW 3G, very similar to algorithms used in\n627 UMTS. EEA2 and EIA2 are based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with EEA2\n628 defined by AES in CTR mode (e.g., stream cipher) and EIA2 defined by AES-CMAC (Cipher629 based MAC). EEA3 and EIA3 are both based on a Chinese cipher ZUC [5].\n\n630 Many keys in LTE are 256-bits long, but in some current implementations only the 128 least\n631 significant bits are used. The specification has allowed for a system-wide upgrade from 128-bit\n632 to 256-bit keys.[1] In LTE, the control and user planes may use different algorithms and key sizes.\n633 This diagram depicts the various keys alongside their use for an appropriate protocol.\n\n1 3GPP 33.401 Section 6.1 a [7]\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n634\n\n635 **Figure 6 - Keys Protecting the Network Stack**\n\n636 The following table depicts various LTE key sizes and the other keys in the key hierarchy from\n637 which they are derived [5].[ 2]\n\n638 **Table 1 - Cryptographic Key Information Summary**\n\n**Key** **Name** **Length** **Derived in Part From**\nK Master Key 128 N/A: Pre-shared root\nkey\n\nIK Integrity Key 128 K\n\nCK Cipher Key 128 K\n\nKASME MME Base Key 256 CK, IK\n\nNH Next Hop 256 KASME\n\nKeNB* eNB Handover Key 256 KASME, KeNB\n\nKeNB eNB Base Key 256 KASME, NH\n\nKNASint NAS Integrity Key 128 KASME\n\nKNASenc NAS Confidentiality Key 128 KASME\n\n2 3GGP TS 33.401 Figure 6.2-2\n\n15\n\n|Key|Name|Length|Derived in Part From|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|K|Master Key|128|N/A: Pre-shared root key|\n|IK|Integrity Key|128|K|\n|CK|Cipher Key|128|K|\n|K ASME|MME Base Key|256|CK, IK|\n|NH|Next Hop|256|K ASME|\n|K eNB*|eNB Handover Key|256|K , K ASME eNB|\n|K eNB|eNB Base Key|256|K NH ASME,|\n|K NASint|NAS Integrity Key|128|K ASME|\n|K NASenc|NAS Confidentiality Key|128|K ASME|\n\n\n-----\n\n|RRC enc|RRC Confidentiality Key|128|K NH eNB,|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|RRC int|RRC Integrity Key|128|K NH eNB,|\n|UPenc|UP Confidentiality Key|128|K NH eNB,|\n\n\n639\n\n640 **3.2** **Hardware Security**\n\n641 The UICC is the next-generation Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card used in modern mobile\n642 devices and is the foundation of the LTE security architecture. The UICC hosts the Universal\n643 Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application that performs the full range of security critical\n644 operations required of LTE cellular networks, such as authentication and other cryptographic\n645 functions. The UICC is a tamper resistant removable storage device that users can leverage to\n646 move their cellular service from one cellular device to another, while also providing the\n647 capability of storing contacts and other user data. The UICC houses a processor, ROM, RAM, is\n648 network aware, and is capable of running small Java applications used for a variety of functions\n649 ranging from maintenance, updates, and even video games. The UICC can also potentially be\n650 used for identity services and Near Field Communication (NFC).\n\n651 From a security perspective, one of the most important functions of the UICC is cryptographic\n652 key and credential storage. In LTE, UICCs are provisioned with a long-term, pre-shared\n653 cryptographic key referred to as K. This key is stored within the tamper resistant UICC and also\n654 within the core network (in the HSS) and is never to leave either of those locations [15]. All\n655 other keys in LTE’s cryptographic structure are derived from K, with the session master key\n656 referred to as KASME. Security functions such as cryptographic operations and subscriber\n657 authentication are performed by the UICC in conjunction with the HSS and MME, the UICC\n658 also plays a role in storing LTE security contexts. Security contexts contain cryptographic keys,\n659 UE security capabilities, and other security parameters generated during an attach that can be\n660 reused during future system accesses. The UICC also stores the IMSI and IMEI, which are both\n661 used to support the use of identities. Some modern mobile equipment operating systems\n662 implement the USIM PIN specified by 3GPP TS 121.111 [31]. This allows a PIN to be\n663 configured on a UICC. Since UICCs can be removed from one mobile device and inserted into\n664 another to provide service, the UICC PIN can prevent someone from stealing another user’s\n665 UICC and obtaining unauthorized network access that they are not paying for.\n\n666 **3.3** **UE Authentication**\n\n667 The primary LTE authentication mechanism mobile handsets used to authenticate to an LTE\n668 network is known as the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol. The use of AKA\n669 in LTE is required by 3GPP TS 33.401 [5]. The AKA protocol cryptographically proves that the\n670 UICC and MNO have knowledge of the secret key K. From a security perspective, this\n671 effectively authenticates the UICC to the network, but not the user or mobile device. An AKA\n672 protocol run is depicted and further described below:\n\n673\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\n674\n\n675 **Figure 7 - Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol**\n\n676\n\n677 The AKA procedure occurs as part of the UE attach process, described in Section 0, and provides\n678 mutual authentication between the UICC and the LTE network.\n\n679 AKA is begun by a UE providing its identifier to the appropriate MME (item 1 above). This\n680 identifier may be permanent, as is the case with the IMSI, or may be temporary. Examples of\n681 temporary identifiers include the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) and Globally\n682 Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI). After the identifier is provided to the core network, the\n683 MME provides the identifier, alongside additional cryptographic parameters and the serving\n684 network ID, to the HSS/AuC (item 2 above) these values then are used to generate an\n685 authentication vector (AUTN). To compute an AUTN, the HSS/AuC needs to use a random\n686 nonce (RAND), the secret key K, and a Sequence Number (SQN) as inputs to a cryptographic\n687 function. This function produces two cryptographic parameters used in the derivation of future\n688 cryptographic keys, alongside the expected result (XRES) and authentication token (AUTN)\n689 (item 3 above). This authentication vector is passed back to the MME for storage (item 4 above).\n690 In addition, the MME provides the AUTN and RAND to the UE, which is then passed to the\n691 USIM application (item 5 above). The USIM sends AUTN, RAND, the secret key K, and its\n692 SQN through the same cryptographic function used by the HSS/AuC (item 6 above). The result\n693 is labeled as RES, which is sent back to the MME (item 7 above). If the XRES value is equal to\n694 the RES value, authentication is successful and the UE is granted access to the network (item 8\n695 above).\n\n696 **3.4** **Air Interface Security**\n\n697 The UE and the eNodeB communicate using a Radio Frequency (RF) connection commonly\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n698 referred to as the air interface, which is referred to as the Uu interface. Both endpoints modulate\n699 IP packets into an RF signal that is communicated over the air interface; these devices then\n700 demodulate the RF signal into IP packets understandable by both the UE and EPC. The eNodeB\n701 routes these packets through the EPC while the UE uses the IP packets to perform some function.\n702 These radio waves are sent from a UE’s antenna over the air until they reach the antenna of the\n703 eNodeB, this over the air communication is not necessarily private, meaning anything within the\n704 wave path can intercept these radio raves. The figure below illustrates where in the network this\n705 is occurring.\n\n706\n\n707 **Figure 8 - Highlighting the Air Interface**\n\n708 3GPP’s technical specification 33.401 directs that both the NAS and RRC control plane\n709 messages must be integrity protected. 3GPP TS 33.401 5.1.4.1 requires that “Integrity protection,\n\n710 and replay protection, shall be provided to NAS and RRC-signalling.” It is specified that user\n711 plane packets traveling on the Uu interface are not integrity protected. Specifically, 3GPP TS\n712 33.401 5.1.4.1 states “User plane packets between the eNodeB and the UE shall not be integrity\n\n713 protected on the Uu interface.”\n\n714\n\n715 Both control plane and user plane packets communicating between the UE and eNodeB on the\n716 Uu can be confidentiality protected but this is left as optional. This statement is based on a\n717 requirement located in 3GPP TS 33.401 5.1.4.1: “User plane confidentiality protection shall be\n718 done at PDCP layer and is an operator option”. Air interface confidentiality provides a higher\n719 level of assurance that messages being sent over the air cannot be deciphered by an external\n720 entity. LTE specifies a ciphering indicator feature in 3GPP TS 22.101 [6]; this feature is\n721 designed to give the user visibility into the status of the access network encryption.\n722 Unfortunately, this feature is not widely implemented in modern mobile phone operating\n723 systems. Figure 9 and Figure 10 help to illustrate where on the network integrity and encryption\n724 are provided by LTE.\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\n725\n\n726 **Figure 9 - Integrity Protection Requirements**\n\n727\n\n728\n\n729 **Figure 10 - Confidentiality Protection Requirements**\n\n730\n\n731 An exact order is not specified for when the LTE network must negotiate security parameters for\n732 a given connection. The TS 24.301 [10] permits the following 7 messages to be sent without\n733 security protection:\n\n734 - IDENTITY REQUEST (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);\n\n735 - AUTHENTICATION REQUEST;\n\n736 - AUTHENTICATION REJECT;\n\n737 - ATTACH REJECT;\n\n738 - DETACH ACCEPT (For non switch off);\n\n739 - TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT;\n\n740 - SERVICE REJECT.\n\n741\n\n742 Depending on network implementation these messages may be sent in a varying order. When a\n743 message that requires protection needs to be sent the network must establish security parameters\n744 and agree on algorithms. This establishment is initiated by the sending of the Security Mode\n745 Command (SMC). The SMC dictates that the UE and serving network must initiate a\n746 cryptographic algorithm negotiation in order to select appropriate algorithms for: RRC ciphering\n\n19\n\n\n-----\n\n747 and integrity protection on the Uu interface, user plane cyphering on the Uu interface, and NAS\n748 cyphering and NAS integrity protection between UE and MME. It is important to note that the\n749 network selects the algorithm based upon security capabilities of the UE and a configured list of\n750 available security capabilities on the serving network.\n\n751\n\n752 Separate Access Stratum (AS) and Non Access Stratum (NAS) level SMC procedures are\n753 required to configure security on each applicable portion of the protocol stack. The AS SMC is\n754 used for configuring RRC and user plane level protections, while the NAS SMC is used for\n755 configuring NAS level protections.\n\n756\n\n757 Once an AKA run has occurred, and the NAS and optionally the AS SMCs are sent, a security\n758 context is generated. A security context is a collection of session keys and parameters used to\n759 protect either the NAS or AS. Long term information such as K, or other identifiers like the\n760 IMEI and IMSI are not stored within a security context. Typically, only the keys from KASME and\n761 downward within the key hierarchy are stored. When a UE deregisters from an eNodeB, the\n762 previous security context can be reused, avoiding a superfluous AKA run, which may add\n763 network congestion and require additional computing power on behalf of the core network.\n\n764\n\n765 **3.5** **E-UTRAN Security**\n\n766 The radio access network and associated interfaces make up the E-UTRAN portion of the LTE\n767 network, and which is the midway between a handset and an MNO’s core network. Handover is\n768 one of the most important functions of a cellular network, allowing the user the ability to be\n769 moving, such as traveling on a highway, and maintain call connection. Base stations will often\n770 need to communicate between themselves to enable this “mobility”, and they do so via the X2\n771 interface. 3GPP specifies multiple security mechanisms to ensure a secure handoff of call related\n772 information.\n\n773 Two types of handovers exist: X2 handover and S1 handover. During an S1 handover the MME\n774 is aware that a handover is going to occur before it happens. Within an X2 handover, the MME is\n775 unaware and the transition occurs purely between eNodeBs via the X2 interface. There are\n776 unique security considerations for both methods of handover. With an S1 handover, the MME\n777 can refresh the cryptographic parameters used to protect the air interface before the connection is\n778 severed. With an X2 handover, fresh keying material can only be provided after the handover for\n779 use in the next handover.\n\n780 When handover occurs, new keys are generated, partly separating the new session from the\n781 previous one, although a new master session key (i.e., KASME) is not generated. The KeNB is used,\n782 alongside other cryptographic parameters and the cell ID of the new eNodeB, to generate KeNB*,\n\n783 which is used to protect the new session after handover occurs. It is of note that the source base\n784 station and MME control key derivation and the new eNodeB is not meant have knowledge of\n785 the keys used in the original eNodeB session.\n\n786 **3.6** **Backhaul Security**\n\n787 3GPP has specified optional capabilities to provide confidentiality protection to various LTE\n\n20\n\n\n-----\n\n788 network interfaces. Section 3.4 discuses optional confidentiality protection provided between\n789 UEs and eNodeBs on the Uu interface as well as communication between eNodeBs on the X2\n790 interface. According to the LTE technical specifications 33.401, confidentiality protection is also\n791 optional between eNodeBs and the Evolved Packet Core S1 interface. 3GPP specifies that the\n792 use of IPsec in accordance with 3GPP TS 33.2103 NDS/IP should be implemented to provide\n793 confidentiality on the S1 interface but the specification goes on to note that if the S1 interface is\n794 trusted or physically protected, confidentiality protection is an operator option. Trusted or\n795 physically protected is not further defined within the 3GPP specification.\n\n796 The endpoints the S1 interface connects are very often many miles apart, meaning all data being\n797 sent over the LTE network is traveling any number of miles from a cell tower location to the\n798 facility where the EPC is located. The physical means to provide this backhaul connection can\n799 vary, some technologies include; Microwave, Satellite, Ethernet, Underground Fiber, etc.\n800 Physically protecting the S1 interface requires the MNO to have security controls in place at\n801 every location through which this connection is routed. It is very likely the cellular MNO does\n802 not own or operate the physical connection used to backhaul LTE network traffic, making it\n803 difficult for the MNO to ensure the S1 interface is physically protected. The network operator\n804 may depend on other network security measures (e.g., MPLS VPN, layer 2 VPN) to protect the\n805 traffic traversing the S1 interface and ensure this interface is trusted.\n\n806\n\n807 **Figure 11 - Protecting the S1 Interface**\n\n808 An all IP-based system introduces certain security concerns that are not applicable to older\n809 cellular networks. Prior to LTE if an adversary wanted to intercept traffic on a cellular network,\n810 specialized hardware was required. With LTE the transport mechanism between the eNodeB and\n811 the EPC is all IP, all that is required to intercept traffic is basic networking experience, computer,\n\n3 3GPP TS 33.210 V12.2.0 (2012-12) 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System\nAspects; 3G security; Network Domain Security (NDS); IP network layer security (Release 12) [3]\n\n21\n\n\n-----\n\n812 network cable, and access to a switch port. If confidentiality is not provided on the S1 interface\n813 all traffic being intercepted is sent in clear text.\n\n814 3GPP TS 33.210 specifies, “For native IP-based protocols security shall be provided at the\n815 network layer. The security protocols to be used at these network layer are the IETF defined\n816 IPsec security protocols as specified in RFC-4301 and in RFC-2401”.[4] This 3GPP document\n817 introduces the notion of Security Domains and using Security Gateways (SEG) or firewalls at the\n818 edge of these domains in order to provide security. Security domains are “networks that are\n819 managed by a single administrative authority” [3]. These are an important delineation of LTE\n820 networks, however, they are ambiguously defined which can lead to different interpretations and\n821 documentation for security domains. An example of this could be that all of the EPC components\n822 and communication hosted in the same datacenter, with physical security controls provided by\n823 the MNO. It could also mean that an MNO defines all components of the core as a single\n824 security domain because the same administrative group manages them, even though they are\n825 spread geographically throughout the country. Confidentiality is provided by initiating an IPsec\n826 tunnel at the eNodeBs for traffic traveling over the (potentially not physically secure) S1\n827 interface and terminating the tunnel at the security gateway placed at the edge of the Security\n828 Domain where the EPC is hosted.\n\n829\n\n830 **Figure 12 - Sample Illustration of Security Gateways**\n\n831 The use of IPsec on the S1 interface will require endpoints terminating the IPsec tunnel to be\n832 provisioned with pre-shared keys or digital certificates. The use of a scalable system such as\n833 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is likely to be utilized for a commercial LTE network. The\n834 security parameters used to establish the encrypted connection can be dynamically negotiated\n835 using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) based on policies configured at the endpoints. Both\n836 endpoints of the IPsec tunnel (eNodeB & SEG) contain digital certificates or pre-shared keys,\n837 provisioned either manually or dynamically from the PKI system. If digital certificates are not\n838 pre-provisioned a Certificate Authority (CA) can be used to issue digital certificates and will\n\n4 Citations from this quote were omitted to avoid citation collisions from the source document and this document\n\n22\n\n\n-----\n\n839 need to be accessible to endpoints on the LTE network. For more information regarding Public\n840 Key Technology reference NIST SP 800-32 [26].\n\n841 **3.7** **Core Network Security**\n\n842 As previously mentioned, 3GPP has specified optional security capabilities for various\n843 connections within LTE networks. However, even though 3GPP has noted in its standards that\n844 since LTE has introduced an all IP-based network, there needs to be more focus on security of\n845 the EPC than there was in 2G/3G there is no specific security guidance tailored for the EPC [3].\n846 Although, traditional IP network security guidelines and operational procedures may be\n847 beneficial. Since the core network handles the majority of control plane signaling, security needs\n848 to be a primary consideration.\n\n849 As specified in TS 33.210, the LTE network must be logically and physically divided into\n850 different security domains. If any components of the core are in different security domains then\n851 traffic between them is required to be routed through an SEG using IPsec for encryption and\n852 integrity protection [3]. Due to the ambiguities associated with defining a security domain, an\n853 operator’s core network may be considered one security domain. This implies a lack of security\n854 on standard communication between core LTE network components. If this is the case, then all\n855 of the signaling and user traffic being transmitted in the core would be transmitted in the clear,\n856 without confidentiality protection. However, if different pieces of the core are defined to exist in\n857 distinct security domains, then traffic must be encrypted using IPsec between them. To ensure\n858 that user and control data is protected in the appropriate places in the core network, careful\n859 consideration should be given to how security domains are defined for a network. Confidentiality\n\n860 protection may be implemented between different components of the core to ensure that the user\n\n861 and signalling traffic is protected.\n\n862 Currently, 3GPP is working on standards for Security Assurance Methodology (SECAM) for\n863 3GPP nodes. The main document, TR 33.805, \"studies methodologies for specifying network\n\n864 product security assurance and hardening requirements, with associated test cases when feasible,\n\n865 of 3GPP network products\" [8]. There are plans to have accompanying documents to TR 33.805\n\n866 that will have specific security considerations for each component of the core. 3GPP will first\n\n867 create the Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS) for the MME as a trial. Once the initial\n\n868 SCAS is completed for the MME, the 3GPP SA3 working group will continue work on SCAS\n\n869 for the other network product classes. The MME SCAS, TR 33.806, is currently still in draft and\n\n870 addresses the security assurance specification for the MME. 3GPP is partnering with GSMA\n\n871 Network Equipment Security Assurance Group (NESAG) to establish an accreditation process\n\n872 and resolution process to evaluate products against the requirements defined in the SCAS.\n\n873 Core network security does not have any rigorous security specifications or requirements in the\n\n874 3GPP standards. Future development of SCAS may require specific security controls to be\n\n875 implemented within the individual core components.\n\n23\n\n\n-----\n\n876 **4** **Threats to LTE Networks**\n\n877 This section explores general classes of threats to LTE networks grouped by related threat\n878 categories. It is of note that the 3GPP SA3 Working Group explored threats to LTE networks and\n879 authored a document listing many of threats addressed in this section [7]. Threat analyses\n880 external to 3GPP have been performed, such as [16], [17], and [18], and were used as input to\n881 this analysis. Many of the threats listed below have been identified via academic research, while\n882 others may be documented and reported real-world attacks that have occurred in deployed\n883 cellular systems.\n\n884 While some of these threats may have an impact on network availability and resiliency, others\n885 are limited user data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, most of the threats mentioned\n886 here would only affect a limited portion of the network. With increased availability of low cost\n887 LTE hardware and software [21] many threats listed below can be implemented with a low level\n888 of complexity [19] [25].\n\n889 **4.1** **General Cybersecurity Threats**\n\n890 LTE infrastructure components (e.g., eNodeB, MME, S-GW) may run atop of commodity\n891 hardware, firmware, and software, making it susceptible to publically known software flaws\n892 pervasive in general purpose operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD and other *nix variants) or other\n893 software applications. This implies that these systems need to be properly configured and\n894 regularly patched to remediate known vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the National\n895 Vulnerability Database [28]. The following subsections will address malware threats to specific\n896 network components and the management of an LTE network.\n\n897 **4.1.1 Malware Attacks on UE’s**\n\n898 Malicious code infecting a mobile device's operating system, other firmware, and installed\n899 applications could prevent a UE from accessing a cellular network. Malware could directly\n900 attack the baseband OS and its associated firmware. Attacking the baseband OS could change\n901 important configuration files for accessing the network or prevent important routines from\n902 running, such as those interpreting the signaling from a base station. Either of these would cause\n903 a denial of service.\n\n904 **4.1.2 Malware Attacks on Base Station Infrastructure**\n\n905 Malware installed on a mobile device, or infecting a mobile device's operating system and other\n906 firmware, could be part of a botnet launching an attack against a carrier’s radio network\n907 infrastructure. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack could be launched via a continuous\n908 stream of attach requests, or requests for high bandwidth information and services, is one manner\n909 of causing this attack. An unintentional DDoS attack on a carrier’s radio infrastructure has been\n910 seen to occur via a mobile application making a large number of update requests [11]. Malware\n911 can also compromise base station operating systems causing unexpected and undesirable\n912 equipment behavior.\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\n913 **4.1.3 Malware Attacks on Core Infrastructure**\n\n914 Malware infecting components a carrier’s core network infrastructure would have the potential to\n915 log network activity, modify the configuration of critical communications gateways, and sniff\n916 user traffic (e.g., call traffic, SMS/MMS) depending on which components are infected. These\n917 types of attacks have been previously observed in GSM networks [22], but as of this time there is\n918 no known example of this attack within backend LTE infrastructure.\n\n919 **4.1.4 Unauthorized OAM Network Access**\n\n920 Operational and Access Management (OAM) networks are a vital part of an operational cellular\n921 network, providing remote access into geographically spread out components of the network.\n922 These OAM network interfaces provide quick access to network components, allowing MNOs to\n923 manage and tune networks from one central location. Poor design and lack of hardening of these\n924 management networks and interfaces create a serious security risk to the networks operational\n925 stability. Unauthorized access to management interfaces can potentially allow malicious and\n926 unintentional misconfigurations of critical network systems.\n\n927 **4.2** **Rogue Base Stations**\n\n928 Rogue base stations are unlicensed base stations that are not owned and operated by an authentic\n929 MNO. They broadcast a cellular network masquerading as a legitimate carrier network. The\n930 necessary hardware to construct these devices can be inexpensively obtained using commercial\n931 off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. The software required to operate a 2G (GSM) base station is\n932 open source and freely available [20], and can be configured to operate as a rogue base station.\n\n933\n\n934 **Figure 13 - Example Rogue Base Station**\n\n935 Rogue base stations exploit the fact that mobile handsets will attach to whichever base station is\n936 broadcasting as its preferred carrier network and is transmitting at the highest power level.\n937 Therefore, when a rogue base station is physically proximate to a mobile handset while\n938 transmitting at very high power levels, the handset may attempt to connect to the malicious\n939 network [23]. At the time of this writing, a large majority of rogue base stations broadcast a 2G\n940 GSM cellular network. Unfortunately, the security protections offered by GSM lack mutual\n941 authentication between the handset and cellular network, and strong cryptographic algorithms\n942 with keys of sufficient length. Additionally, there is no requirement mandating that the 2G GSM\n943 air interface is encrypted.\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\n944 **4.2.1 Device and Identity Tracking**\n\n945 As previously stated, both the IMSI (UICC) and IMEI (handset) act as unique identifiers. Both of\n946 these identifiers can be indicators of who owns a mobile handset and where a device is\n947 physically located. It is commonplace today for individuals to constantly keep their mobile\n948 devices physically near them, and if a rogue base station is used to intercept traffic in an area,\n949 such as where you reside, the operator of the rogue network may be able to identify whether a\n950 specific individual is, or is not, residing within a specific location. This poses a threat to privacy\n951 because an eavesdropper can determine if the subscriber is in a given location. Data needed for\n952 geolocation is available via signaling channels, and is sent over the air interface during handset\n953 attach and authentication.\n\n954 **4.2.2 Downgrade Attacks**\n\n955 Using a rogue base station broadcasting at a high power level, an attacker can force a user to\n956 downgrade to either GSM or UMTS. As of the time of this writing, there are no significant,\n957 publically known weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms used to protect the confidentiality\n958 and integrity of the UMTS air interface. Unfortunately, significant weaknesses exist for the 2G\n959 GSM cryptographic algorithms used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the air\n960 interface. Examples of broken 2G cryptographic algorithms are A5/1 and A5/2 [15]. Depending\n961 on the algorithm negotiated while attaching to the rogue base station, the air interface\n962 cryptographic algorithms chosen to protect the air interface may be cryptographically broken,\n963 leading to a loss of call and data confidentiality.\n\n964\n\n965 **Figure 14 – Simplified Downgrade Attack**\n\n966 While GSM is out of scope for this document, real world deployments utilize GSM networks to\n967 connect with LTE networks, which bring this into scope.\n\n968 **4.2.3 Preventing Emergency Phone Calls**\n\n969 Attackers using a rogue base station could prevent mobile devices physically close to the rogue\n970 base station from accessing emergency services. This occurs when the rogue station fails to\n971 forward user traffic onward to the MNO. If this attack occurs during an emergency situation, it\n972 could prevent victims from receiving assistance from public safety services and first responders.\n973 This attack may be detectable, since the UE believes it has cellular service but is unable to make\n974 calls or send/receive data. This attack takes advantage of another vector that comes into play\n\n26\n\n\n-----\n\n975 while making emergency phone calls when the preferred network is not available. When making\n976 an emergency phone call the UE might attach and attempt to send the call through a rouge base\n977 station, even if the base station is not masquerading as a legitimate network. There is a risk that\n978 the rogue base station will not forward the emergency call appropriately.\n\n979 **4.2.4 Unauthenticated REJECT Messages**\n\n980 As stated in section 3.4, during the UE attach procedure certain messages can be sent before\n981 security parameters are negotiated. One of these unauthenticated messages is the ATTACH\n982 REJECT message, which prevents a UE from completing the attach procedure. A rogue base\n983 station coercing a UE to participate in a UE attach procedure can send this unauthenticated\n984 ATTACH REJECT message. In response to receiving this message, a UE will no longer attempt\n985 to attach to this, or other LTE networks. Since the ATTACH REJECT message is sent even\n986 before the UE can authenticate the network, it is unable to distinguish the rogue base station\n987 from a real one. This can cause a DOS that may persist until a hard reboot of the UE is\n988 performed. Certain baseband implementations will not automatically try to reconnect if this\n989 ATTACH REJECT message is received [25].\n\n990 Similarly, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message can be sent by a rogue base\n991 station in the same manner, and may have the same effect as the ATTACH REJECT message.\n\n992 **4.3** **Air Interface Eavesdropping**\n\n993 A complex eavesdropping attack is possible if the operator does not encrypt user plane LTE\n994 traffic on the Uu interface. Attackers would need to have the proper equipment to capture and\n995 store the radio communication between UE and eNodeB. In addition, the attackers would need\n996 software to identify the specific LTE frequencies and timeslots a UE is using to communicate so\n997 they can demodulate the captured traffic into IP packets.\n\n998 **4.4** **Attacks Via Compromised Femtocell**\n\n999 Femtocells offer a user the ability to have a small base station located within their house or other\n1000 area. These small base stations can assist with poor reception to an eNodeB, which may cause\n1001 slow, intermittent, or no access back to the core network. UEs attach to these devices like a\n1002 typical eNodeB, but these devices often connect back to the MNO’s core via a user’s home\n1003 internet connection through their Internet Service Provider (ISP). Femtocells have been\n1004 standardized in LTE since release 8, and are referred to as H(e)NodeBs, HeNodeBs, or HeNBs.\n1005 HeNBs are mandated to have an IPsec connection back to an HeNB gateway (HeNB-GW) to\n1006 protect traffic flowing into and out of a MNO’s core network [4].\n\n1007 If the HeNBs is within the physical possession of an attacker, this provides unlimited time to\n1008 identify a flaw on the HeNB. A compromised HeNBs can be used in a manner similar to a rogue\n1009 base station, but it also has access to the cryptographic keys used to protect the cellular\n1010 connection. They will provide attackers access to clear text traffic before it is sent back to the\n1011 core network. Common methods of attack exploit implementation flaws in the host OS and\n1012 drivers [14].\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\n1013 **4.5** **Radio Jamming Attacks**\n\n1014 Jamming attacks are a method of interrupting access to cellular networks by exploiting the radio\n1015 frequency channel being used to transmit and receive information. Specifically, this attack occurs\n1016 by decreasing the signal to noise ratio by transmitting static and/or noise at high power levels\n1017 across a given frequency band. This classification of attack can be accomplished in a variety of\n1018 ways requiring a varying level of skill and access to specialized equipment. Jamming that targets\n1019 specific channels in the LTE spectrum and is timed specifically to avoid detection is often\n1020 referred to as smart jamming. Broadcasting noise on a large swath of RF frequencies is referred\n1021 to as dumb jamming.\n\n1022 **4.5.1 Jamming UE Radio Interface**\n\n1023 A low cost, high complexity attack has been proposed to prevent the transmission of UE\n1024 signaling to an eNodeB. Research from Virginia Tech [12] and other institutions [13] suggests\n1025 that, due to the relatively small amount of LTE control signaling used by the LTE air interface\n1026 protocols, this attack is possible. Further research is required to ascertain the level of complexity,\n1027 severity, and probability of this attack succeeding.\n\n1028 **4.5.2 Jamming eNodeB Radio Interface**\n\n1029 Base stations may have physical (e.g., fiber optic) or wireless (e.g., microwave) links to other\n1030 base stations. These links are often used to perform call handoff operations. As mentioned in\n1031 section 4.5.1, it may be possible to jam the wireless connections eNodeBs use to communicate\n1032 with each other. Although theoretical, the same type of smart jamming attacks that are used\n1033 against the UE could be modified to target communicating eNodeBs, which would prevent the\n1034 transmission of eNodeB to eNodeB RF communication.\n\n1035 The 3GPP SA3 Working Group, the group that defines LTE security standards, states that this\n1036 attack “…can be made with special hardware and countermeasures for these are not feasible to\n\n1037 implement. However, jamming attacks may be detected and reported” [7]. This indicates that\n\n1038 these types of jamming attacks are outside of the LTE threat model.\n\n1039 **4.6** **Backhaul and Core Eavesdropping**\n\n1040 The backhaul connection handles data communication between the LTE core and eNodeBs (cell\n1041 sites). In section 3.6 this document explores backhaul security and optional standards based\n1042 features to provide confidentiality on this critical interface. If the LTE network is not utilizing\n1043 confidentiality protection on the backhaul interface the communication being sent to and\n1044 received from cell sites is vulnerable to eavesdropping. It would be trivial to intercept\n1045 communication if a malicious actor had access to network equipment terminating the S1\n1046 interface.\n\n1047 **4.7** **Physical Attacks on Network Infrastructure**\n\n1048 The cell site is the physical location containing all of the equipment necessary to run and operate\n1049 an eNodeB. Although these sites sometimes are enclosed by a fence and protected by a physical\n1050 security system, it is possible for these defenses to be circumvented. A denial of service attack is\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\n1051 possible if the equipment used to run the eNodeB is taken offline or somehow destroyed. For\n1052 instance, copper theft is very common, which would result in a denial of serice. More subtle\n1053 attacks that are much more difficult to detect are also possible if an attacker can obtain gain\n1054 control of the systems running the eNodeB.\n\n1055 **4.8** **Attacks Against K**\n\n1056 Cryptographic keys enable LTE to provide many of the strong security features built into the\n1057 system. As discussed in section 3.1, there are many different keys used to protect different layers\n1058 of LTE communication. All of these keys are derived from a secret pre shared key referred to as\n1059 ‘K’. This key resides in two places: one is the USIM running on the UICC and the other is within\n1060 the carrier’s HSS/AuC. Depending on how K is provisioned to the UICC it may be possible for a\n1061 malicious actor to gain access to this secret key responsible for all of LTE’s cryptographic\n1062 functions. If an actor gains access to K they have the potential to both impersonate a subscriber\n1063 on the network and the ability to decrypt communication from the subscriber for whom K was\n1064 provisioned.\n\n1065 **4.9** **Stealing Service**\n\n1066 UICC cards are small cards that are removable from mobile devices by design. Service from an\n1067 MNO is tied to a user’s UICC. This means it is possible for a UICC to be stolen from one mobile\n1068 device, and placed into another with the goal of stealing service, including voice and data.\n1069 Another means of stealing service is if an insider with access to the HSS or PCRF grants\n1070 unapproved access to the network. For example, this could be an employee who activates UICCs\n1071 unbeknownst to the MNO and sells them for personal profit.\n\n29\n\n\n-----\n\n1072 **5** **Mitigations**\n\n1073 This section identifies mitigations to the threats identified in the previous section. It is of note\n1074 that there is not a one to one mapping for the threats listed in Section 4 and the mitigations listed\n1075 within Section 5, as there are unaddressed threats within this analysis. Each mitigation addresses\n1076 at least one threat listed in Section 4. It is of note that the 3GPP SA3 working group has explored\n1077 and authored a document detailing mitigations to many LTE threats listed in the previous section\n1078 [7].\n\n1079 Ensuring that many of the following mitigations are implemented in cellular networks is out of\n1080 the realm of possibility for everyday users, with the ability to enable change to be in the hands of\n1081 MNOs, mobile operating system developers, and hardware manufacturers. MNOs can work to\n1082 implement many of the mitigation techniques described in this section, however challenges may\n1083 exist where hardware, firmware, and software do not support these countermeasures. It is\n1084 important to work with the ecosystem in order to research, develop, and implement these security\n1085 features in commercial cellular equipment.\n\n1086 If these mitigations are important to a user, they may need to request these security protections\n1087 from the appropriate party. Many of the listed mitigations may simply be modifying certain\n1088 configurations of already implemented features, something that would be feasible in the near\n1089 term. Others would require software updates to mobile operating systems, and/or baseband\n1090 processors, or modifications to 3GPP standards, which will take much more time to implement.\n\n1091 **5.1** **Cybersecurity Industry Recommended Practices**\n\n1092 LTE infrastructure components (e.g., eNodeB, MME, S-GW) rely on purpose built systems to\n1093 perform their network functions. The core software these systems run on is often a general\n1094 purpose operating system. It is important that computer security recommended practices,\n1095 including network, physical, and personnel security, be applied to these components in the same\n1096 way they are applied to general information technology systems throughout industry today.\n1097 Protection mechanisms such as patch management, configuration management, identity and\n1098 access management, malware detection, and intrusion detection and prevention systems can be\n1099 carefully planned and implemented throughout the MNO’s LTE infrastructure. These processes\n1100 and protection mechanisms can be tailored to best support and protect the specialized LTE\n1101 system.\n1102 _Addresses the following threats: 4.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4_\n\n1103 **5.2** **Enabling Confidentiality on the Air Interface**\n\n1104 Although integrity protection of NAS and RRC is mandatory, air interface encryption is left as\n1105 an operator option in LTE systems [5]. Enabling cryptographic protection of the user plane over\n1106 the Uu interface via the UPenc key can prevent passive eavesdropping attacks. It is possible that\n1107 implementing confidentiality protection on the air interface can introduce significant latency into\n1108 cellular networks, and it may also significantly impact a UE’s battery. Further testing, pilot\n1109 programs, capable hardware in conjunction with a phase approach can be followed to provide\n1110 confidentiality protection.\n1111 _Addresses the following threats: 4.3_\n\n30\n\n\n-----\n\n1112 **5.3** **Use of the Ciphering Indicator**\n\n1113 As discussed in 4.2, the authentication procedure for the 2G GSM system does not perform\n1114 mutual authentication between the mobile device and the base station. This allows for the\n1115 possibility of a non-LTE rogue base station to perform a downgrade attack on a UE with an\n1116 active LTE connection. This GSM connection may not be confidentiality protected. Current\n1117 mobile devices do not provide the option for a user to know if their UE’s connection is encrypted\n1118 to the eNodeB. 3GPP provides a mechanism to alert a user to an unencrypted connection,\n1119 referred to as the ciphering indicator.\n\n1120 The ciphering indicator is defined in 3GPP TS 22.101, which defines this indicator as a feature to\n1121 inform the user as to the status of the user plane confidentiality protection. This feature could be\n1122 implemented as a user interface notification appearing on the user’s mobile device and dose not\n1123 provide functionality to prevent a call from being made. It is possible for the MNO to disable this\n1124 feature with a setting in the USIM. 3GPP specifies the default behavior of the UE shall be to\n1125 obey the setting configured in the USIM. However, it is possible for the UE to provide a user\n1126 interface option to ignore the USIM setting and provide the user an indication of the status of the\n1127 user plane confidentiality protection. “Ciphering itself is unaffected by this feature, and the user\n1128 can choose how to proceed” [6].\n\n1129 This indicator would be beneficial to informed users wishing to know if their over the air cellular\n1130 connection is encrypted or not. This may require new software from either the mobile\n1131 operating system vendor (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft) or the baseband manufacturer (e.g.,\n1132 Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung).\n1133 _Addresses the following threats: 4.3_\n\n1134 **5.4** **User-Defined Option for Connecting to LTE Networks**\n\n1135 Rogue base stations often exploit the lack of mutual authentication that exists in GSM. Current\n1136 mobile devices do not provide average users the option to ensure that a user's mobile device only\n1137 connects to a 4G LTE network, a specific MNO’s (or MVNO’s) network, or a specific physical\n1138 cellular site. If users could ensure that their mobile device is connected only to a 4G LTE\n1139 network, mutual authentication is achieved between their UE and eNodeB via the LTE AKA\n1140 protocol, and an active rogue base station attack downgrading the connection to GSM should not\n1141 be possible.\n\n1142 It is of note that a preferred network technology listing exists on many UEs, and depending on\n1143 the platform, similar options may exist in testing modes, it is unclear if this option would prevent\n1144 a UE that is under attack from connecting to a rogue base station. The current functionality is not\n1145 intended to be a security feature but could provide vital defense against rogue base stations. The\n1146 user-defined option is not widely deployed in UEs, and would likely require software updates\n1147 from the mobile operating system vendor (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft) and/or the baseband\n1148 manufacturer (e.g., Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung). This option would be beneficial to informed\n1149 users wishing to only connect to LTE networks.\n1150 _Addresses the following threats: 4.2.1, 4.2.2. 4.2.3_\n\n31\n\n\n-----\n\n1151 **5.5** **Ensure Confidentiality Protection of S1 Interface**\n\n1152 Both physical and logical security can be used to secure the backhaul connection of an LTE\n1153 network. Placing devices in physically secure location is an important step in securing the\n1154 backhaul connection and protecting it from malicious actors. Cryptographically securing the IP\n1155 traffic traversing the backhaul connection is seen as equally important and provides a higher\n1156 level of assurance and is possible via NDS/IP. Implementing confidentiality protection on the S1\n1157 interface may introduce latency into cellular backhaul connections, and further research is\n1158 required to understand if this latency would noticeably degrade service and traffic throughput.\n1159 _Addresses the following threats: 4.6_\n\n1160 **5.6** **Encrypt Exposed Interfaces Between Core Network Components**\n\n1161 To the extent that it does not significantly affect availability of network resources, the interfaces\n1162 between core network nodes can be confidentiality protected in some way, possibly via the\n1163 mechanisms defined in 3GPP TS 33.210. For instance, traffic between an S-GW and P-GW\n1164 should be encrypted. In the near future, many of the network components may be either\n1165 collocated on the same server as distinct applications or virtualized via Network Functions\n1166 Virtualization (NFV).[5] NFV will enable workloads running on the same physical hardware to be\n1167 logically separated, allowing communication between components to happen in software. This\n1168 would continue to separate each function’s processes but could possibly eliminate an exposed\n1169 physical interface. 3GPP and ETSI will provide forthcoming guidance for protecting these\n1170 interfaces.\n1171 _Addresses the following threats: 4.6_\n\n1172 **5.7** **Use of SIM/USIM PIN Code**\n\n1173 As previously noted, some modern mobile equipment operating systems implement the USIM\n1174 PIN specified by 3GPP TS 121.111 [31]. This enables local user authentication to the USIM via\n1175 PIN configured on a UICC. Enabling the UICC PIN can prevent someone from stealing another\n1176 subscriber’s UICC and obtaining unauthorized network access. An individual stealing the UICC\n1177 and placing it into another device would be required to enter a PIN before they could continue\n1178 any further. Many UICCs lock after 10 incorrect attempts and the user’s MNO would be required\n1179 to provide an unlocking code to make the USIM usable again. The SIM/USIM PIN may degrade\n1180 the user experience by adding additional authentication and slowing down the UE boot process.\n1181 _Addresses the following threats: 4.9_\n\n1182 **5.8** **Use of Temporary Identities**\n\n1183 A subscriber’s permanent identity, the IMSI, is one of the first parameters sent to an eNodeB\n1184 when a UE attaches to the LTE network. IMSIs are sometimes sent in clear text over the air\n1185 interface, and this may be unavoidable in certain scenarios. 3GPP defines multiple temporary\n1186 identities that MNOs can leverage to avoid sending these sensitive identifiers over the air\n1187 interface, such as the GUTI in LTE. When the GUTI is in use, user tracking should become more\n\n5 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\n1188 difficult. GUTIs need to be implemented in a manner so they are periodically refreshed via the\n1189 _NAS GUTI Reallocation Command to ensure that it is a truly temporary identifier [19]._\n1190 _Addresses the following threats: 4.2.1_\n\n1191 **5.9** **3[rd] Party Over-the-Top Solutions**\n\n1192 If an MNO is not encrypting a user’s traffic, or if a passive eavesdropping attack occurs, using a\n1193 3[rd] party over the top service can provide strong authentication, integrity and confidentiality\n1194 protection for user data. This mitigation would effectively use an MNO’s network as a “dumb\n1195 pipe”, and a user would use an application running on the general-purpose mobile operating\n1196 system to provide video, audio, or some other communication service. Additionally, 3[rd] party\n1197 over-the-top solutions can act as a defense in depth measure, choosing not to rely soley on their\n1198 MNO to provide confidentiality protection.\n1199 _Addresses the following threats: 4.2.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8_\n\n1200 **5.10 Unauthenticated Reject Message Behavior**\n\n1201 In the presence of illegitimate messages with the ability to deny network access, a possible\n1202 mitigation is for the UE to continue to search for other available networks while ignoring the\n1203 network denying service. The baseband firmware could be tested to understand the behavior\n1204 these systems exhibit when in the presence of unauthenticated reject messages. Additional\n1205 research and development is needed to ensure that baseband processors are exhibiting behavior\n1206 that does not cause unintentional DoS when receiving an illegitimate reject message.\n1207 _Addresses the following threats: 4.2.4_\n\n33\n\n\n-----\n\n1208 **6** **Conclusions**\n\n1209 When compared to previous cellular networks, the security capabilities provided by LTE are\n1210 markedly more robust. The additions of mutual authentication between the cellular network and\n1211 the UE, alongside the use of publically reviewed cryptographic algorithms with sufficiently large\n1212 key sizes are positive steps forward in improving the security of cellular networks. The enhanced\n1213 key separation introduced into the LTE cryptographic key hierarchy and the mandatory integrity\n1214 protection also help to raise the bar.\n\n1215 Yet LTE systems are rarely deployed in a standalone fashion - they coexist with previous cellular\n1216 infrastructure already in place. Older cellular systems continue to be utilized throughout many\n1217 different industries today, satisfying a variety of use cases. With this in mind, it’s easy to see\n1218 why LTE networks are often deployed in tandem with GSM and UMTS networks. This multi1219 generational deployment of cellular networks may lead to an overall decrease in cellular security.\n1220 A primary example of this is the requirement for the baseband firmware to remain backward\n1221 compatible, supporting legacy security configurations.\n\n1222 The interconnection of these technologies introduces additional complexity into an already\n1223 complicated system that is distributed over an immense geographic area, that is continental in\n1224 scale. Cellular networks traditionally use separate networks to communicate call signaling\n1225 information. Specifically, the SS7 network has been in use for decades and has its own unique\n1226 set of security challenges that is separate from the cellular network technology. An LTE-specific\n1227 version of Diameter was specified by 3GPP to, in part, resolve the challenges associated with the\n1228 use of SS7, although it is not widely deployed. It’s important for MNOs and all interested parties\n1229 to perform their own security analysis of this technology in order to understand how to\n1230 appropriately mitigate the risks introduced by these signaling technologies. This security analysis\n1231 should include how any partnering MNO also mitigates these risks in their own network, since a\n1232 weakness in one MNO’s network adversely affects the security of those its connected to.\n\n1233 LTE’s sole use of IP technology is a major differentiator from previous cellular networks. LTE\n1234 does not use circuit switching, instead opting to move to a purely packet switched system. IP is a\n1235 commoditized technology that is already understood by Information Technology practitioners,\n1236 which presents both challenges and opportunities. Attackers may be able to leverage existing\n1237 tools for exploiting IP-based networks to attack the LTE core and other associated cellular\n1238 infrastructure within an MNO’s network. Conversely, this may allow already existing IP-based\n1239 defensive technology to be immediately applied to LTE networks. Hopefully, the application of\n1240 these technologies will offer novel ways to increase system security.\n\n1241 The following list highlights areas of the LTE security architecture that either lack the\n1242 appropriate controls or have unaddressed threats:\n\n1243 - **Default Confidentiality Protection for User Traffic: The LTE standards do not provide**\n1244 confidentiality protection for user traffic as the default system configuration. Enabling\n1245 user traffic encryption by default, except for certain scenarios such as emergency calls,\n1246 would provide out of the box security to end users.\n\n34\n\n\n-----\n\n1247 - **Prohibiting user traffic integrity: Although the LTE standards require integrity**\n1248 protection for critical signaling traffic, integrity protection for user traffic is explicitly\n1249 prohibited, as stated in section 3.4.\n\n1250 - **Lack of protection against jamming attacks: This is an active area of research, and**\n1251 mitigations have been proposed, although it is unclear if these mitigations have been\n1252 appropriately vetted and considered for inclusion into the LTE standard.\n\n1253 - **OAM Networks: Vulnerabilities potentially exist on the OAM network depending on**\n1254 how it is architected and managed.\n\n1255\n\n1256 While this document is focused on the fundamentals of LTE and its security architecture, many\n1257 concepts were considered out of the scope of our analysis. Some of these concepts are services\n1258 that build on top of the LTE architecture, while others come from specific implementations and\n1259 uses of an LTE network. It is important that the security implications introduced by these\n1260 concepts listed below are well understood, and require further research:\n\n1261 - Security analysis of IMS,\n\n1262 - Security analysis of VoLTE,\n\n1263 - Protection against jamming attacks,\n\n1264 - Enabling UE network interrogation,\n\n1265 - LTE for public safety use, and\n\n1266 - Security implications of Over the Air (OTA) updates.\n\n1267 This document identified threats to LTE networks, and described potential mitigations to these\n1268 issues. Exploring and enabling the mitigations included within this document will be a\n1269 coordinated effort between mobile OS vendors, baseband firmware developers, standards\n1270 organizations, mobile network operators, and end users. Developing solutions to the problems\n1271 identified here, and continuing to perform relevant research is an important task since LTE is the\n1272 nation’s dominant cellular communications technology.\n\n35\n\n\n-----\n\n1273 **Appendix A—Acronyms and Acronyms**\n\n1274 Selected acronyms and abbreviations used in this paper are defined below.\n\n1275 **2G** 2[nd] Generation\n1276 **3G**
