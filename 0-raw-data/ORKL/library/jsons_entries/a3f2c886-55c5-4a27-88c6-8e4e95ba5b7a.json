Since then, the broader activity set has rapidly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O87AYlIPSyI)\nexpanded in size and scope and received widespread public attention following Twitter’s\n[takedown of related accounts in August 2019. Numerous other researchers have](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong)\npublished investigations into various aspects of this activity set, including Google’s Threat\n[Analysis Group, Graphika, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Stanford Internet](https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/graphika_report_spamouflage.pdf)\n[Observatory and the Hoover Institution, and the Centre for Information Resilience.](https://www.info-res.org/post/revealed-coordinated-attempt-to-push-pro-china-anti-western-narratives-on-social-media)\n\nSince we began tracking the campaign in mid-2019, we have observed multiple shifts in\nits tactics, many of which have been reported on publicly elsewhere, including the use of\nartificially generated photos for account profile pictures and the promotion of a wide\nvariety of narrative themes related to current events, including multiple narratives related\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, narratives critical of Chinese dissident Guo Wengui and his\nassociates, and narratives related to domestic U.S. political issues. However, other\nevolutions in the network’s activity do not appear to have been reported widely, and our\naim with this blog post is to provide early warning of two significant developments that\nwe believe are important to monitor despite the limited impact of the network so far:\n\n**The scope of activity, in terms of languages and platforms used, is far**\n**broader than previously understood. Most reporting has highlighted English**\nand Chinese-language activity occurring on the social media giants Facebook,\nTwitter, and YouTube. However, we have now observed this pro-PRC activity taking\nplace on 30 social media platforms and over 40 additional websites and niche\nforums, and in additional languages including Russian, German, Spanish, Korean,\nand Japanese. While some platforms have hosted hundreds or thousands of\naccounts in the network, other platforms have hosted a smaller number.\nCollectively, these observations suggest the actors behind this campaign have\nsignificantly expanded their online footprint and appear to be attempting to\nestablish a presence on as many platforms as possible to reach a variety of global\naudiences.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Accounts in the network have actively sought to physically mobilize**\n**protestors in the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, though we**\n**have seen no indication that these attempts motivated any real-world**\n**activity. While previous public reporting has highlighted limited instances of**\norganic engagement with the network on Twitter and we have continued to track\nsimilar instances of organic engagement on both social media and niche online\nforums, this direct call for physical mobilization is a significant development\ncompared to prior activity, potentially indicative of an emerging intent to motivate\nreal-world activity outside of China’s territories. While this attempt did not appear\nto achieve any success, we believe it is critical that observers continue to monitor for\nsuch attempts in case greater degrees of organic engagement are later realized by\nthe network.\n\n**Activity Expands to Dozens of Social Media Platforms, Websites, and Forums in at**\n**Least Seven Languages**\n\nSimilar to previously reported activity that has spanned Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube,\nwe have observed coordination between suspected accounts in the network across 30\nsocial media platforms and over 40 other websites and online forums. These accounts\nhave posted similar, and in many cases identical messaging and engaged in the\ncoordinated sharing, commenting on, and liking of text, image, and video content. For\nexample:\n\nWe have observed thousands of identical text posts, images, and videos promoted\nby accounts on Vimeo, Vkontakte, TikTok, and a number of other platforms\nclaiming that Chinese dissident Guo Wengui, former White House Chief Strategist\nSteve Bannon, and Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan are “liars” in response to Dr.\nYan’s Claim that the coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab (Figure 1). Videos\nfeatured characteristics typical of those promoted by the network historically,\nincluding Chinese and automated English-language voiceovers.\nIn some instances, accounts on one platform have directly provided their\ncorresponding social media handles on other platforms in their bios. For example,\nwe have observed accounts on LiveJournal posting in Russian, English, and German\nprovide handles for corresponding Twitter accounts that all posted in English\n(Figure 2). Different accounts across different platforms have also appropriated the\nsame profile photos, including photos of models and stock photography (Figure 3).\nWe also observed instances of forum posts linking to other accounts in the network\n(Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Vimeo account (left) shares identical video as TikTok account (right)\n\nFigure 2: LiveJournal account (left) linking to Twitter account (right); accounts use\nidentical profile photo and display name\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Tumblr account (top) uses same profile photo as LiveJournal account (bottom)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: A forum post links to a Twitter account in the network\n\nWe have observed extensive promotion of Russian, German, Spanish, Korean, and\nJapanese-language content on U.S. and non-U.S.-based platforms, in addition to the\ntypical English and Chinese-language activity that has been widely reported on. This\nrepresents a significant development in our collective understanding of this pro-PRC\nactivity set. For example:\n\nWe observed Russian-language posts on LiveJournal claim that U.S. Ft. Detrick was\nthe source of the coronavirus and that China was “not the source” of the virus, a\nlong-promoted and extensively reported narrative of this activity set that has also\nbeen promoted by Chinese state-run media outlets since early 2020 (Figure 5).\nAdditionally, we have observed Russian-language posts on both LiveJournal and\nVKontakte by accounts we have tied to the network cite unconfirmed studies to\nclaim COVID-19 may have appeared in the U.S. as early as December 2019.\nWe have observed several instances of multiple inauthentic VKontakte accounts\nreposting Russian translations of posts by what appear to be authentic Englishlanguage Twitter accounts belonging to individuals who claim to have contracted\nCOVID-19 in late 2019 in the U.S. and other locations outside China (Figure 6). We\nalso observed a small number of Russian-language posts by VKontakte accounts in\nthe network state that Taiwan and Hong Kong are Chinese territories.\nWe observed German and Spanish-language content on LiveJournal and the\nArgentine social media site Taringa that also attempted to cast doubt about the\norigins of COVID-19. Posts in German on LiveJournal cited unconfirmed studies to\nclaim that COVID-19 may have appeared in the U.S. before January 2020, while\nposts in Spanish on Taringa claimed that U.S. Ft. Detrick was the source of COVID19 and linked to third-party articles that claimed that the virus appeared in the U.S.\nand Europe before China (Figures 7 and 8).\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, some of the Russian and German-language posts we observed contained\nrecurring grammatical errors, a limited indication that they may have been\nauthored by non-native speakers of those languages. For example, we observed\nRussian-language LiveJournal posts by accounts purportedly operated by female\nbloggers use a masculine-tense verb for the phrase \"Я увидел\" (Translation: \"I\nsaw\"), which should read \"увидела\" if written by a female Russian speaker (Figure\n9).\n\nFigure 5: LiveJournal accounts promote identical text in Russian claiming that \"U.S. Ft.\nDetrick was the source of COVID-19\" and that \"China is not the source of the virus\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Inauthentic VKontakte accounts (top) repost in Russian a post from what\nappears to be an authentic English-language Twitter account (bottom)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: LiveJournal accounts post identical text in German claiming that COVID-19\nmay have appeared in the U.S. before Jan. 19, 2020\n\nFigure 8: Spanish-language Taringa accounts post articles and text to cast doubt about\nthe origin of COVID-19\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: LiveJournal accounts post identical, grammatically incorrect messages in\nRussian implying that American netizens believed they were infected with COVID-19 in\nlate 2019 and early 2020\n\n**Attempts to Physically Mobilize Protestors in the U.S.**\n\nIn April 2021, thousands of posts in languages including English, Japanese, and Korean,\nimages, and videos were posted across multiple platforms by accounts we assess to be\npart of this broader activity set that called on Asian Americans to protest racial injustices\nin the U.S. (Figure 10). The accounts specifically called on Asian Americans to protest on\nApril 24 in New York City and “fight back” against the purported “rumors” caused by Dr.\nLi-Meng Yan, Guo Wengui, and Steve Bannon, and in some instances provided an\naddress that they claimed Guo lived at.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Twitter account calls for physical protests in Japanese (left), Korean (middle),\nand English (right) (Note: We have censored the address listed by the accounts)\n\nSubsequently, we observed posts by accounts in the network portray the advocated April\n24 New York City protest as a success, claiming that Asian Americans, other minority\ngroups, and Caucasian protestors attended (Figure 11). Other posts claimed that these\nprotesters were met by Guo Wengui’s “supporters”, who “violently assault[ed]” them. As\npart of this claim of success, we observed a manipulated image in which the face of Dr.\nYan was superimposed onto a sign held by a purported protestor and shared across nearly\nall the social media platforms and forums that we have seen leveraged as part of this\nbroader activity set. We identified the image to be a manipulation of a picture taken at a\nrally against racial discrimination that took place in Jamestown, NY, on or around April\n23, 2021 (Figure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: A Medium account (left) and an Underlined account (right) post identical text\nclaiming Asian Americans protested racial violence in the U.S. The sign being held in the\npicture on the left has been photoshopped\n\nFigure 12: Photoshopped image of Dr. Yan's face on a sign (left), shared across nearly all\nplatforms (original photo on the right)\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite these claims, we have not observed any evidence to suggest that these calls were\nsuccessful in mobilizing protestors on April 24. However, it does provide early warning\nthat the actors behind the activity may be starting to explore, in however limited a\nfashion, more direct means of influencing the domestic affairs of the U.S. We believe it is\nimportant to call attention to such attempts and for observers to continue to monitor for\nsuch attempts in future.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur aim with this blog post is to provide early warning of two significant developments\nthat we believe are important to monitor for despite the limited impact of this pro-PRC\ncampaign thus far. First, the activity is taking place not just on the big three social media\ngiants, but on at least 30 social media platforms and dozens of additional websites and\nforums, and in languages including not just English and Chinese, but also German,\nRussian, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese. This suggests that the actors behind the\ncampaign have significantly expanded their online footprint and appear to be attempting\nto establish a presence on as many platforms as possible to reach a variety of global\naudiences. Second, the attempt to physically mobilize protesters in the U.S. provides early\nwarning that the actors responsible may be starting to explore more direct means of\ninfluence and may be indicative of an emerging intent to motivate real-world activity\noutside of China’s territories.\n\n[Next Post](https://www.fireeye.com/content/fireeye-www/en_US/blog/threat-research/2021/09/proxyshell-exploiting-microsoft-exchange-servers.html)\n\n\n-----",
