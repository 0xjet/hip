To achieve this, attackers are also leveraging CVE-2021-28799 to deliver the new eCh0raix](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28799)\nransomware variant to QNAP devices. While eCh0raix is known ransomware that has historically targeted QNAP and Synology NAS devices\nin separate campaigns, this new variant is the first time we’ve seen it combining functionality to target both QNAP and Synology NAS devices,\ndemonstrating that some ransomware developers are continuing to invest in optimizing the tools used to target devices common in the small\noffice and home office (SOHO).\n\nWe’re regularly seeing attacks with the eCh0raix ransomware variant, which has been active in the wild for nearly a year. As recently as June,\n[victims have reported paying a modest ransom.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/617854/ech0raix-ransomware-qnapcryptsynology-nas-encrypt-support-topic/page-59#entry5209302)\n\nWe’re releasing our findings about this new variant of eCh0raix to raise awareness of the ongoing threats to the SOHO and small business\nsectors. Coverage of the ransomware crisis tends to focus on threats to large enterprises and government agencies, which are facing\nincreasingly aggressive and disruptive ransomware attacks. However, the SOHO and small business sectors can contain a large attack\nsurface for threat actors – for example, some 250,000 QNAP and Synology NAS devices are exposed to the public internet, according to data\nfrom the Cortex Xpanse platform.\n\nSOHO users are attractive to ransomware operators looking to attack bigger targets because attackers can potentially use SOHO NAS\ndevices as a stepping stone in supply chain attacks on large enterprises that can generate huge ransoms.\n\nAdditionally, SOHO users typically do not employ dedicated IT or security professionals, which makes them less prepared to block\nransomware attacks than larger organizations.\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for protecting home offices from ransomware attacks:\n\n\n-----\n\nUpdate de ce a e to eep attac s o t s atu e at bay eta s about updat g Q S de ces aga st C 0 8 99 ca\nbe found on the QNAP website.\nCreate complex login passwords to make brute-forcing more difficult for attackers.\nLimit connections to SOHO connected devices from only a hard-coded list of recognized IPs to prevent network attacks that are used to\ndeliver ransomware to devices.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against eCh0raix and CVE-2021-28799 with Next-Generation Firewalls with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) [Threat Prevention,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\n[WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [Advanced URL Filtering security subscriptions; Cortex Xpanse and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering) [AutoFocus.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\n\n## CVE-2021-28799: Exploit in the Wild\n\n[On April 22, QNAP released a security advisory to disclose a vulnerability within their Hybrid Backup Sync (HBS 3) software. This software](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-advisory/QSA-21-13)\nprovides backup, restoration and synchronization functions between local, remote and cloud storage spaces. The vulnerability has been\nconfirmed as an improper authorization vulnerability. Once exploited, it allows remote attackers to log in to the devices. CVE-2021-28799 is\nassigned to this vulnerability.\n\nOn June 21, we caught an attack targeting QNAP HBS3 with an exploit of CVE-2021-28799. While this vulnerability has been exploited to\n[deliver QLocker in the past, this is the first instance we know of in which it is being exploited to deliver eCh0raix (also known as QNAPCrypt)](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-advisory/qsa-21-12)\nransomware. The payload of the malicious request is shown in Figure 1. The attack tried to utilize a hard-coded session ID\n\"jisoosocoolhbsmgnt\" to bypass authentication and execute a command on the device, aiming to fetch malware from the remote server\n64[.]42[.]152[.]46 and run it on the victim device. The payload is still live at the time of this writing.\n\nFigure 1. CVE\n2021-28799 exploit.\nWhile eCh0raix has historically targeted QNAP devices, further analysis of the payload led to the discovery that this is a new variant of the\nransomware that also targets Synology devices, thereby increasing its attack surface.\n\n## Timeline of the New eCh0raix Ransomware Variant\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, details on the eCh0raix ransomware samples targeting these Synology devices were unknown until now.\n[Instances of Synology devices infected by eCh0raix have been reported from as far back as 2019, but the only](https://www.synology-forum.nl/firmware-algemeen/ech0raix-ransomware/) [previous research connecting](https://www.anomali.com/blog/threat-actors-utilizing-ech0raix-ransomware-change-nas-targeting)\nthe Synology attacks to eCh0raix actors is based on decryptors that were found.\n\nThe first sample we saw of this new ransomware variant combining functionality to target both QNAP and Synology devices is from September\n2020. It’s possible that is when the combined variant was authored. Before then, the attackers likely had separate codebases for campaigns\ntargeting devices from each of the vendors. This is also confirmed by the use of rct_cryptor_universal as the project name in the new variant,\ngoing by the compilation paths present in GoLang binaries (/home/dev/GoglandProjects/src/rct_cryptor_universal). Prior samples of eCh0raix\nuse the project name qnap_crypt_worker.\n\nWe observed other eCh0raix samples between June and September 2020 using the rct_cryptor_universal project name, but the first full-blown\nsample with two separate code flows, based on a syno flag (explained below), is from September 2020.\n\nGoing by posts from victims in forums, it appears the eCh0raix ransomware is quite active. The attackers have found success extorting ransom\n[out of victims, an example of which can be seen on BleepingComputer.com, where the ransom was paid as recently as June 16, 2021.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/617854/ech0raix-ransomware-qnapcryptsynology-nas-encrypt-support-topic/?p=5209302)\n\nQuerying [Cortex Xpanse for NAS devices gives us a rough estimate of the number of devices from each vendor connected to the internet (i.e.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xpanse)\nthe attack surface for this ransomware). Xpanse tells us there are approximately 240,000 internet-connected QNAP NAS devices. In contrast,\nXpanse found approximately 3,500 Synology NAS devices – a much smaller number. This tells us the additional target doesn’t significantly\nincrease the ransomware’s attack surface.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe new variant accepts an additional syno flag as an input parameter. The two accepted flags are explained below in Table 1.\n\n\n**Flag**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Description** **Significance**\n\n\n-----\n\ns start path A string value that determines the path on the targeted device where the ransomware encrypts files. The default\nvalue is “/”. The exploit we observed in the wild specified this value as “/share/” (see Figure 1). This value is also\nignored if the syno flag is set, in which case the start path value is a hardcoded list of paths.\n\nsyno is syno? This is a Boolean value accepted by this new variant. By default, it is not set, but if explicitly set using the syno input\nparameter, a hardcoded path is used for encrypting files. The hardcoded path used is /volume[X] (where X takes on\nvalues from 0 to 9). This essentially means that the ransomware tries to encrypt the first 10 numbered volumes on\nthe device. This aligns with the name of the flag syno since Synology NAS devices specifically store their data under\nvolumes.\n\n_Table 1. Input arguments supported by the new variant._\n\n**CheckIsRunning: After launch, the ransomware first checks whether another instance of the process is already running. This is done by**\nchecking for a [SampleName].pid file in the temporary directory on the system. The temporary directory location is determined either by the\nvalue of the TMPDIR environment variable, or /tmp is used if the environment variable is not set. If found, the ransomware tries to read an\ninteger value from this file and kill the corresponding process ID on the system. If it fails to kill the existing process, it prints a message:\n“Program is running. Exiting…” and exits. If no existing running process is found, or the ransomware succeeds at killing a previously running\nprocess, it initializes the .pid file in the temporary directory with the value of its own process ID.\n\n**checkReadmeExists: Next, the binary checks for the presence of a ransom note file. In the original variant, this file was named**\nREADME_FOR_DECRYPT.txt. However, this new variant uses the filename README_FOR_DECRYPT.txtt (with the extra trailing ‘t’). Perhaps\n[the typo is an easy way for the attackers to distinguish between campaigns. This thread in the QNAP user forum starting March 21, 2021,](https://forum.qnap.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=160274)\nshows this new variant has been active and contains victims’ accounts from instances of successful infection.\n\nIf this file already exists on the device, the binary exits.\n\n**getInfo: If a preexisting ransom note file is not found and program execution continues, the ransomware attempts to connect to a Tor URL via**\na hard-coded SOCKS proxy – see Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) below. This URL serves as the command and control (C2) server and\nreturns a JSON object containing:\n\nThe AES key used to encrypt files on the system.\nThe ransom note.\nA Bitcoin address that is included in the ransom note.\n\nWe managed to find one of the C2 URLs still live, which returned a response with the JSON object described above, as seen in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. C2\n\nresponse.\nAn interesting thing to note is that the new variant uses a different URL format for communicating with the C2 using an API key, instead of\nusing Campaign ID numbers as the previous variant did (see Table 3 for variant comparison).\n\nIf the sample fails to connect to the C2 or receive a meaningful response, it exits with the rather amusing log message, “AES public key not\nset!” (AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, thus the concept of public or private keys is moot in this case.)\n\n**main: Following all these steps, the ransomware iterates through the list of files at a path determined by the flag values (syno and s) explained**\nin Table 1. Any files in this path containing the following strings are ignored:\n\n/proc /boot/ /sys/\n\n/run/ /dev/ /etc/\n\n/home/httpd /mnt/ext/opt .system/thumbnail\n\n.system/opt .config .qpkg\n\n/usr/syno /tmp /volume1/@appstore/PhotoStation\n\n.@analytic qnapSystem.php README_FOR_DECRYPT.txtt\n\n.@backup_config .antivirus .ldapdb\n\n.@backup_qbox .appDB .locks\n\n.@backup_qfiling .idmap .log\n\n.@qmariadb .php_session_sys .qbox\n\n\n-----\n\ne e c ypt o a go t used s t e sa e as t at used by t e o g a a a t ( S C ), a d t e sa e e te s o ( e c ypt) s appe ded to\nencrypted files, with the eCh0raix string used as a marker in the files to verify successful decryption by decryptors. However, this new variant\ndoesn’t generate the AES key locally, but rather receives it directly from the C2.\n\nThe new variant also implements encryption in two stages based on file extensions. The ransomware first iterates through files with the\nfollowing 42 extensions and encrypts them:\n\n.arw, .c, .c++, .cfg, .cpp, .cs, .csv, .cxx, .doc, .docb, .docm, .docx, .go, .h, .hwp, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .pdf, .pl, .png, .psd, .py, .rtf, .svg, .tif, .tile, .txt,\n.wallet, .xla, .xlam, .xll, .xlm, .xls, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlw, .xps\n\n[We hypothesize that this is a higher-priority subset of extensions focusing on data that would be of value to the average user. Thus, it is more](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/617854/ech0raix-ransomware-qnapcryptsynology-nas-encrypt-support-topic/?p=5200448)\nlikely for the ransom to be paid to recover this data. These extensions are likely encrypted first to prioritize valuable data in case the\nransomware fails to complete its encryption process.\n\nAfter the encryption of files with the first set of extensions, files matching a longer list of 530 unique file extensions are encrypted. These are\nincluded in the appendix. We noticed the .docx extension is included on both lists, so those files would get encrypted twice.\n\nThe original variant targeted a total of 563 unique extensions, all encrypted as part of the same routine (also included in the appendix).\n\n**New Variant** **Old Variant**\n\n\n**Input Flags** -s : start path\n-syno : is syno?\n\n\n-s : start path\n\n\n**Project Name** rct_cryptor_universal qnap_crypt_worker\n\n**Ransom Note Filename** README_FOR_DECRYPT.txtt README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt\n\n**C2 Communication Format** https://[TOR-Domain]/api/GetAvailKeysByApiKey/[key] http://[TORDomain]/api/GetAvailKeysByCampId/[number]\n\n\n**Encryption Method** Encryption is carried out in two steps, focusing on a short\nlist of higher priority extensions first.\nAES Encryption Key received from C2\n\n42+530 unique file extensions targeted.\n\n\nEncryption carried out in one go.\nAES Encryption Key generated locally\n\n563 unique file extensions targeted.\n\n\n**Saves ransomware PID in a**\n**temporary directory?**\n\n**Kills certain running**\n**processes?**\n\n_Table 3. Variant comparison._\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nYes No\n\nNo Yes\n\n\nThe discussion of this new variant of eCh0raix ransomware provides an example of the ongoing threats to the SOHO and small business\nsectors. These sectors represent a large attack surface for threat actors – for example, some 250,000 QNAP and Synology NAS devices are\nexposed to the public internet, according to data from the Cortex Xpanse platform.\n\nSOHO users are attractive to ransomware operators looking to attack bigger targets because attackers can potentially use SOHO NAS\ndevices as a stepping stone in supply chain attacks on large enterprises that can generate huge ransoms.\n\nAdditionally, SOHO users typically do not employ dedicated IT or security professionals, which makes them less prepared to block\nransomware attacks than larger organizations.\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for protecting home offices from ransomware attacks:\n\nUpdate device firmware to keep attacks of this nature at bay. Details about [updating QNAP NAS devices against CVE-2021-28799 can](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/security-advisory/qsa-21-13)\nbe found on the QNAP website.\nCreate complex login passwords to make brute-forcing more difficult for attackers.\nLimit connections to SOHO connected devices from only a hard-coded list of recognized IPs to prevent network attacks that are used to\ndeliver ransomware to devices.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from eCh0raix ransomware and CVE-2021-28799 by the following products and services:\n\n\n-----\n\ne t Ge e at o e a s t a eat e e t o secu ty
