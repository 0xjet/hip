Our research has uncovered several factors determining a](https://www.digitalshadows.com/dark-web-monitoring/)\nplatform’s chances of success, including market share, USP, security, and convenience.\n[We’ve mainly focused our attention and threat intelligence articles on the rise and fall of](https://www.digitalshadows.com/threat-intelligence/)\nseveral English-language marketplaces. Still, we thought the Russian-language scene also\ndeserved some of our attention. In this blog, we’ll dive into why there’s traditionally been a\nfocus on forums over marketplaces in the Russian-language cybercriminal underground and\ntake a look at some active and defunct platforms that have made an impact on the scene.\n\n## Why a focus on forums in the Russian-language cybercriminal scene?\n\nThreat intelligence looking at Russian-speaking threat actors tends to focus on cybercriminal\nforums, and for a good reason, Russian-language forums are characterized by their\nremarkable longevity. Unlike the many English-language forums that pop up for a few\nmonths before disappearing under suspicious circumstances, big names like Exploit and\nXSS have been around—in one incarnation or another—for decades now.\n\nExploit and XSS’s popularity shows no sign of waning:\n\nMembership numbers and thread counts are consistently increasing.\nThe sites’ commercial sections are a hive of activity.\nThe forum communities are engaged in the future of the platforms.\n\nThey’re even starting to gain global media attention due to the presence of representatives of\nseveral well-known ransomware groups.\n\nFor those Russian-speaking threat actors looking to transact on a platform using a different\nformat, the options are much more limited, especially if they’re interested in digital goods\nrather than the narcotics that most marketplaces sell. Many once-prominent automated\nvending card sites (AVCs) focusing on carding, such as Rescator, have fizzled out. Several\nautomated platforms selling other wares, such as the RDP shop xDedic, are no longer\nactive.\n\n## Notable Russian-language marketplaces\n\n**MarketMS (Now Defunct)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most significant disruption of the Russian-language marketplace scene in recent years—\nand a great example of the struggle Russian-language platforms face trying to break into this\n[arena—was MarketMS.](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/market-ms-heir-to-the-alphabay-and-hansa-throne/)\n\nCurrent and former members of the forum team at Exploit established MarketMS in a prealpha working stage in January 2015. Its founders included Exploit’s former administrator\n(who now runs XSS). MarketMS tried to differentiate itself from the drugs-focused\n[marketplaces by focusing on digital goods such as databases,](https://www.digitalshadows.com/data-leakage-detection/) [compromised accounts,](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/prevent-account-takeover-with-exposed-credentials-solutions-guide/)\n[malware, exploits, and counterfeit documents. The website described itself as an “automated](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/how-cybercriminals-can-leverage-your-vaccination-card-selfie/)\nsafe trading platform” and promoted its high-security levels, simple interface, and escrowguaranteed trading to distinguish itself from competitors. Despite its unique offering,\nexcluding illicit substances to the benefit of technical goods and services, and its founders’\nimpressive pedigree, MarketMS closed down operations in December 2019 citing “a lack of\nfinancial profits.” Yet another example of a failed marketplace, but somewhat of a surprise,\nespecially considering its due diligence to evade law enforcement and instill trust in its user\nbase. MarketMS’s failure highlights how difficult it is for Russian-language marketplaces to\nattract enough custom to survive.\n\n**HYDRA**\n\nLaunched in 2015, the site is notable for its large user base and evading takedown by law\nenforcement agencies.\n\nHydra is likely successful due to three factors:\n\n1. FSU-based drop locations\n2. A diversified offering of goods/services\n3. User-friendliness and discipline\n\nFSU-based drop locations—Hydra’s vendors’ use of secret drop locations around Russia\nand other former Soviet Union (FSU) nations to which they dispatch their products. This\nmeans buyers can only collect purchases if they are based in—or willing to travel specifically\nto—one of these countries. Drops are not unique to HYDRA; they are commonplace across\nmarketplaces serving many language communities. But the method does make it much\nharder for Western law enforcement agencies to successfully carry out tracking operations, a\nscourge that has led to the downfall of many an English-language marketplace.\n\nAnother potential determinant in HYDRA’s profitability, which ran to USD 1.2 billion between\nJune 2019 and July 2020 according to the Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis, might\nbe the diversity of items offered for sale. Although HYDRA is most well-known for its\nmainstay of narcotics, many vendors sell digital goods and services, leading to a vibrant and\nmixed cybercriminal scene on the site. At first glance, HYDRA’s digital goods sections may\nappear unimpressive when compared to the sheer volume of drugs-based content. There are\n\n\n-----\n\nonly four dedicated subsections: hacking, databases, information extraction, and other. But\nlooks can be deceptive. Listings offering items such as fake passports, SIM cards, counterfeit\ncash, VPN subscriptions, and cashing out services can all be found within these sections.\n\nHYDRA is no cybercrime boutique; the lack of malware for sale may be disappointing for a\nsophisticated hacker. But it might be the case that the absence of specialist hacking content\non HYDRA is intentional. After all, HYDRA made a name for itself by conquering the drug\ntrade market, not attracting hackers. Focusing on digital goods other than malware may\nprovide reasonable cover from the security services, ensuring that the site lies just beneath\nthe threshold that might attract unwanted attention from law enforcement agencies’\ncybercrime departments.\n\n_Figure 1. Hydra’s review system for users_\nHYDRA’s digital goods sections reflect considerable supply and demand, feature steady\nprices, and offer ease of access. The majority of digital goods on HYDRA cost less than RUB\n10,000 (USD 134). Goods in this price range include stolen accounts and digital wallets;\ninformation extracted from stolen documents, IDs, and databases; as well as document\nforgery services. These aren’t necessarily one-time transactions either: One listing can be\ndistributed to multiple buyers, especially if a service is being offered.\n\nLastly, while the volume and diversity of goods on HYDRA are significant, the platform’s\nuser-friendliness and functionality likely contribute to its smooth operation. Reviews are\nsimple on HYDRA, allowing a potential customer to make a quick, well-informed purchase\ndecision. There is a starred rating system, an important feedback metric for evaluating a\nseller’s reputation. While this is not out of the ordinary for a cybercriminal marketplace,\nHYDRA implements the system seamlessly, ensuring would-be buyers gain instant insight\ninto vendors’ legitimacy.\n\nHYDRA operates and enforces a notably strict set of rules, including a ban on the sale of\nfentanyl, weapons, assassination services, viruses, and pornography. We have repeatedly\nobserved that users on Russian-language forums are much more likely to obey regulations\nthan those on English-language counterparts, which tend to be characterized by a lack of\ndiscipline. This replication of common Russian-language forum conformity on a rarer\nRussian-language marketplace might also contribute to HYDRA’s longevity.\n\n**RAMP (Now Defunct)**\n\n\n-----\n\nAt its height, RAMP was competing with the English-language marketplace AlphaBay to\nbecome Silk Road’s successor after the latter fell victim to a law enforcement operation (see\nFigure 2). RAMP was profitable, had considerable market share, and didn’t appear to be the\ntarget of Western law enforcement agencies.\n\nYet RAMP appears to have felt threatened by emerging competition in the form of HYDRA\nand attempted a hostile takeover, mobilizing hackers to launch DDoS attacks against\nHYDRA. HYDRA responded to RAMP’s attack in kind with its own flurry of botnet and DDoS\nattacks, at which point RAMP began to unravel. RAMP’s constant shutdowns cost the\nmarketplace tons of money and led to internal spats. The shutdowns also likely led to much\nof RAMP’s once-loyal customer base carrying out a mass exodus to HYDRA.\n\n_Figure 2. Darknet markets by share of total market size from 2015-2020 (Source:Filtermag)_\n**MEGA**\n\nEstablished in 2015, MEGA is another Russian-language marketplace catering exclusively to\n[Russian-speaking users. DNStats claims that the isolation and smaller market share that](https://dnstats.net/list-of-darknet-markets/)\nresults from this lack of English-language content may lead to cheaper prices than on other\ndark web marketplaces, depending on the product.\n\nAlthough replete with illicit substances, MEGA offers a sizeable inventory of digital goods\nsuch as databases, carding data, counterfeit-related products, and ready-to-use hacking\nsoftware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Digital goods for sale on MEGA_\n**BlackMart**\n\nFounded in 2017, BlackMart started as a Russian-language cybercriminal marketplace with a\nfocus on the narcotics trade, but also managed a sizeable digital goods inventory. Vendors\noften advertised their shops on BlackMart’s associated forum, RuTOR. However, BlackMart’s\ntenure as a Russian-language narcotics hub was short-lived when the platform abandoned\nnarcotics and shifted focus to carding, document forgery, money transfers, counterfeit\nmoney, and sales of various electronics. Moreover, the marketplace’s adaptation to an\nEnglish-language format reflected limitations in the Russian-language marketplace scene\nand a need to reach a global audience. Since reinventing itself, the marketplace advertises\ninternational shipping and sees moderate levels of activity.\n\n**Tochka (Now Defunct)**\n\nThe multi-language marketplace Tochka/Point previously began operations in 2015 selling a\nvariety of physical and digital goods and services. The marketplace’s diversified offerings\nacross eight different languages reflected an international approach. Although it focused on\nnarcotics, stolen data, malware, credit cards, bank accounts, and social engineering tutorials\nwere all available for sale. The reason for Tochka’s disappearance isn’t entirely clear, but it’s\nevident that it left many disgruntled customers in its wake who accused Tochka of committing\nan exit scam. It lasted only four years, finally going offline in November 2019.\n\n**WayAway**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter its founding in 2009, WayAway was a staple Russian-language forum with marketplacelike features and even served as a gateway to other Russian-language platforms.\n\nIn fact, HYDRA’s creation can be attributed to a partnership that was formed between\nWayAway and Legal RC, another Russian-language forum, in order to compete with RAMP.\nHYDRA is listed as a WayAway Partner on the forum’s footer along with links to the\nmarketplace, and it appears that most of WayAway’s user base has moved on to greener\npastures at HYDRA. WayAway now serves as a relic for one of the oldest Russian-language\ndarknet forums and sees intermittent levels of activity, often with users returning just for\nnostalgic purposes.\n\n**RuTOR**\n\nRuTOR is another excellent example of a Russian-language forum with marketplace-like\nfeatures. RuTOR has an entire marketplace embedded within its forum where users\nexchange hacking services, SIM cards, forged documents, weapons, and other cybercriminal\nservices.\n\nThe forum’s association with BlackMart likely attracts users to the site looking for additional\nofferings and a sense of community. With more than 120,000 registered members, RuTOR\nmarkets itself as the “main black market forum.” However, its inflows are nowhere near that\nof HYDRA’s, and it lacks a centralized checkout function and rating system. Instead, users\nare forced to default to targeted advertisements, hoping to attract buyers that will reach out\nby commenting on a thread or through private messenger.\n\n## Concluding thoughts on Russian-language marketplaces\n\nDespite similarities in functionality and content, Russian-language marketplaces are different\nfrom their English-language counterparts in many ways. English-language marketplaces\nabound, towering over Russian-language marketplaces at least in quantity. There is plenty of\ncompetition on the English-language side, which can be attributed to geographical diversity,\nwith English as a lingua franca serving multiple buyer geographies. But for the Russianspeaking cybercriminal scene, HYDRA continues to reign supreme over the rest of its\ncompetition.\n\nDigital Shadows will be watching closely over the coming months and years to see how the\nRussian-language marketplace scene develops – whether HYDRA can retain its crown or\nwhether another upstart like MarketMS will come along to try and shake things up.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about monitoring the dark web for potential leaked databases,\ncompromised accounts, exploits, target attacks and more get a free copy of ourDark Web\n_Monitoring Solutions Guidehere.
