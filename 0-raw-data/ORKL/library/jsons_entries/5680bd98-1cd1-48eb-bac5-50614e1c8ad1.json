The threat actors offer Android-based and PC-based versions of\nRAT, along with HVNC module and exploit builder to weaponize Microsoft Office and\nAdobe PDF documents to deliver malicious code.\n\nThe tool has been released for sale on January 26th this year initially as a compact HVNC\nimplant allowing to set up a silent remote connection to the victim’s computer, and later\ntransformed into a full-scale commercial RAT with a rich feature-set. Escanor has built a\ncredible reputation in Dark Web, and attracted over 28,000 subscribers on the Telegram\nchannel. In the past, the actor with the exact same moniker released ‘cracked’ versions of\nother Dark Web tools, including Venom RAT, and Pandora HVNC which were likely used to\nenrich further functionality of Escanor.\n\nThe mobile version of Escanor (also known as “Esca RAT”) is actively used by\ncybercriminals to attack online-banking customers by interception of OTP codes. The tool\ncan be used to collect GPS coordinates of the victim, monitor keystrokes, activate hidden\ncameras, and browse files on the remote mobile devices to steal data.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Fraudsters monitor the location of the victim, and leverage Esca RAT to steal credentials\nto online-banking platforms and perform unauthorized access to compromised account\nfrom the same device and IP – in such case fraud prevention teams are not able to detect\nit and react timely” – said Ali Saifeldin, a malware analyst with Resecurity, Inc. who\ninvestigated several recent online-banking theft cases.\n\nMost samples detected recently were delivered using Escanor Exploit Builder. The actors\nare using decoy documents imitating invoices and notifications from popular onlineservices.\n\n[Notably, the domain name 'escanor[.]live' has been previously identified in connection to](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2020/12/16/mapping-out-aridviper-infrastructure-using-augurys-malware-addon/)\nAridViper (APT-C-23 / GnatSpy) infrastructure. APT-C-23 as a group was active within the\nMiddle Eastern region, known to particularly target Israeli military assets. After the report\nwas released by Qihoo 360, the Escanor RAT actor released a video detailing how the tool\nshould be used to bypass AV detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe majority of victims infected by Escanor have been identified in the U.S., Canada, UAE,\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Mexico, and Singapore with some infections\nin South-East Asia.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n - Mapping out AridViper Infrastructure Using Recon’s Malware Module\n\nhttps://team-cymru.com/blog/2020/12/16/mapping-out-aridviper-infrastructure-usingaugurys-malware-addon/\n\n## Newsletter\n\nKeep up to date with the latest cybersecurity news and developments.\n\nBy subscribing, I understand and agree that my personal data will be collected and\n[processed according to the Privacy and](https://resecurity.com/privacy-policy) [Cookies Policy](https://resecurity.com/cookies-policy)\n\n## Cloud Architecture\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
