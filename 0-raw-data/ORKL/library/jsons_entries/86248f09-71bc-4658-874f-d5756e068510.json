This assessment is\nbased upon open- and closed-source information pertaining to prior targeting of foreign\ngovernments, journalists, dissidents and private sector organizations operating across\nnumerous industries with significant business interests in Vietnam, with these entities\nincluding countries in Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Laos and Cambodia (e.g.\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]).\n\n\n-----\n\nPOND LOACH appears to be well funded, as evidenced by its developed variety of custom\nbackdoors to target Windows and Mac operating systems, as previously noted by security\nresearchers at Palo Alto Networks and ESET. One of these custom backdoors that2 3\niDefense has continued to track is known as BadCake. This backdoor is commonly dropped\nby either an SFX or an exploit document (e.g. Microsoft Corp. Word or PDF file).\n\nSome of this backdoor’s observed capabilities include:\n\nArbitrary file, process and registration creation\nFingerprinting the local machine\nRunning arbitrary shellcode\n\nOnce dropped, it is usually divided into multiple components in order to be side-loaded, in a\nfashion similar to other remote access tools including PlugX and NetTraveler. Several4 5\nexamples of BadCake abusing legitimate, signed executables to carry out DLL side-loading\ntechniques include the following:\n\nSymantec file rastlsc.exe to import the rastls.dll malware file\nMcAfee file mcoemcpy.exe to import the McUtil.dll malware file\n\n**POND LOACH tactics and techniques**\n\n\niDefense analysts have used the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map the observed POND6\nLOACH tactics and techniques shown below:\n\nInitial Access\n\n**Drive-by Compromise: Watering hole attacks via use of malicious JavaScript to**\nprofile websites\n**Spear Phishing Attachment: Spear phishing e-mails containing malicious**\ndocuments (RTF, Word, Excel) with embedded executable content\n**Valid Accounts: Use of legitimate local admin account credentials**\nExecution\n\n**PowerShell: Use of PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders for execution**\n**Regsvr32: Creates a scheduled task that uses regsvr32.exe to execute a COM**\nscriptlet that dynamically downloads a backdoor and injects it into memory\n**Scheduled Task: Use of scheduled tasks to persist on victim systems, including**\nBadCake creating a scheduled task to execute the executable that sideloads the\nDLL at a set time or interval each day.\n**Signed Script Proxy Execution: Use of PubPrn.vbs within execution scripts to**\nexecute malware, possibly bypassing defenses\n**User Execution: Attempts to lure users to execute a malicious dropper contained**\nwithin spear-phishing attachments\nPersistence\n\n**New Service: Creates a Windows service to establish persistence**\n**Web Shell: Use of Web shells to maintain access to victim websites**\n\n\n-----\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n**Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: Use of CVE-2016-7255 vulnerability to**\nescalate privileges\nDefense Evasion\n\n**Binary Padding: Inclusion of garbage code to mislead anti-malware software**\nand researchers\n**DLL Side-Loading: Use of genuinely signed executables from Symantec**\nCorporation and McAfee, LLC to load malicious DLL files, such as with BadCake,\nwhen the Symantec executable (rastlsc.exe) is used to load a malicious DLL file\n(rastls.dll) from the same directory\n**Indicator Removal on Host: Clears select event log entries**\n**Masquerading: Use of hidden or non-printing characters to help masquerade**\nfilenames on a system, such as appending a Unicode no-break space character\nto a legitimate service name\n**Obfuscated Files or Information: Use of Invoke-Obfuscation framework to**\nobfuscate actor’s PowerShell; also performs other forms of code obfuscation\n**Timestomp: Use of a scheduled task named “Scheduled Defrags” with a**\nbackdated task creation timestamp of June 2, 2016\nCredential Access\n\n**Credential Dumping: Use of Mimikatz to dump stolen system and user**\ncredentials\nDiscovery\n\n**System Information Discovery: Collects the victim operating system version**\nand computer name\n**System Owner/User Discovery: Collects the victim's username**\nLateral Movement\n\n**Application Deployment Software: Compromises McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator**\n(ePO) to move laterally by distributing malware as a software deployment task\n**Remote File Copy: Adds JavaScript to victim websites to download additional**\nframeworks that profile and compromise website visitors\nCollection\n\n**Automated Collection: Ability to fingerprint the local machine**\nExfiltration\n\n**Exfiltration over Command-and-Control (C2) Channel: Use of domain**\ngeneration algorithm (DGA) to create subdomains for C2 servers that are\nhardcoded into the malware\n\n\n-----\n\nC2\n\n**Commonly Used Port: Use of port 80 for C2 communications**\n**Uncommonly Used Port: Use of port 25123 for C2 communications**\n**Standard Application Layer Protocol: Use of HTTP protocol for C2**\ncommunications; use of JavaScript that communicates over HTTP or HTTPS to\nattacker-controlled domains to download additional frameworks\n**Custom C2 Protocol: Use of a custom TCP protocol, with which the adversary is**\nable to filter who receives the real C2 address by ensuring each sample\ngenerates a unique domain name system (DNS) request based on profile data\nextracted from the host; use of Cobalt Strike malleable C2 functionality to blend in\nwith network traffic\n\n**Looking forward**\n\nIn recent years, POND LOACH actors have continued to use TTPs such as strategic website\ncompromise (SWC) and spear-phishing attacks to deliver custom website profiling tools and\nmalware backdoors. The likely objective for this group appears to be infiltrating the digital\nassets of foreign public- and private-sector organizations with significant interests in Vietnam\nto steal intellectual property and confidential business information that may benefit\nVietnamese state entities. iDefense analysts believe that this group will continue to be active\ninto next year and that it will re-tool its arsenal as needed to avoid network defense\nmechanisms.\n\n**[Download the full article [PDF].](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/Blogs/Documents/1/Accenture-POND-LOACH-Actors-Continue-Development-BADCAKE-Malware-12-2019.pdf#zoom=50)**\n\nIf you have any questions about POND LOACH or would like to know more about the\nverticals this group has previously targeted or more about its custom malware arsenal,\nplease reach out to the Accenture Security Cyber Defense Services team\nat [idefense@accenture.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:idefense@accenture.com)\n\nAccenture Security\n\nAccenture Security is a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including\nadvanced cyber defense, applied cybersecurity solutions and managed security operations.\nWe bring security innovation, coupled with global scale and a worldwide delivery capability\nthrough our network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
