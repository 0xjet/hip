Marc-Etienne is a malware researcher at ESET.\n\n[Following the recognition at](https://www.virusbtn.com/blog/2014/09_26.xml) [Virus Bulletin 2014 of ESET’s research on Operation Windigo, I](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/30/bootkits-windigo-virus-bulletin/)\ntook the opportunity to ask Marc-Etienne Léveillé – who worked directly on the Operation\nWindigo report a few questions. Marc-Etienne is a malware researcher at ESET. He is\ninterested in reverse engineering Linux and OS X malware. He is passionate about making\nlinks between different malware to have an overall view of how they are interconnected.\n\n**Quite some time has passed since you last spoke about the large Linux crimeware**\n**operation dubbed Operation Windigo. Has there been anything happening lately**\n**worth of mention?**\n\nWe are still monitoring the Windigo gang. Unfortunately, we have not observed a decrease\nin their malicious activities since the publication of the report in March 2014. We still\nmeasure and block the same amount of traffic being redirected from Cdorked websites.\nMoreover, the various pieces of malware have been updated to evade our indicators of\ncompromise (IoC).\n\n**What is the biggest challenge posed by threats like these to system administrators?**\n\nWe have been notifying a lot of infected parties and I would say that the lack of Linux\nforensic knowledge is the main problem for sysadmins. Windigo uses a lot of tricks to stay\nunder the radar. Since it doesn’t interrupt the affected server’s legitimate activity, such a\nserver could be infected for a very long time before the administrator notices the infection.\nSome sysadmins may stay in denial and refused to believe their server is infected.\n\n**What does the ESET research team do to raise the awareness of the issue?**\n\nWe are trying to reach out to the security community to help sites with Internet-facing\nservers protect themselves against the Windigo threat, and against other general purpose\nLinux malware overall. An effective way to do so is to get the opportunity to speak directly to\nsystem administrators and security researchers who are front-line defenders against such\n[threats. That’s why we were so happy to present on the topic at DerbyCon and, in](https://www.derbycon.com/schedule/)\n[collaboration with Yandex, at Virus Bulletin.](https://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2014/abstracts/SidorovBureau.xml)\n\nIn the near future we will be presenting at the following conferences:\n\n[LinuxCon Europe, October 15, Düsseldorf, Germanyth](http://lccoelce14.sched.org/event/12a045299c41443c53ea9eeea8f46dd2#.VDKYGildX1s)\n[SecTor, October 22nd, Toronto, Canada](http://sector.ca/Program/Sessions/Session-Details/hunting-malware-on-linux-production-servers-the-windigo-backstory-24556)\n[CSAW:Threads, November 13-14, New York, USAth](https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/threads-talks/)\n[conf.au, January 16, Auckland, New Zealandth](http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30181/view_talk?day=friday)\n\n\n-----\n\nIf your readers would like to know more about Operation Windigo or Linux malware reverseengineering, forensics and incident response please come and talk to us.\n\n**What kind of changes were introduced in the recent versions of the Linux/Ebury**\n**malware?**\n\nThe authors of the Ebury malware react quite quickly to our publications. Within a month,\nwe’ve seen a new version of the malware evading our indicators of compromise. Here are a\nfew of the most noticeable changes:\n\nThe version number has jumped to 1.5.1 (which is the latest version number that\nwe’ve seen). We also saw version 1.4.1 for the first time in April 2014. At the time we\nreleased the Operation Windigo report in March, the latest version observed had been\n1.3.5.\nEbury no longer uses shared memory for storing stolen credentials and maintaining\ninter-process communication. Instead, a new process is started and injected with the\nEbury payload with LD_PRELOAD. Stolen credentials are kept in this new process\naddress space. Inter Process Communication (IPC) with OpenSSH is initiated over a\n[UNIX domain socket.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket)\nThe domain name generator algorithm (DGA) used as a backup to exfiltrate\ncredentials has changed. This backup is used when it has not been configured by the\noperator.\nVersion 1.5 no longer infects the so file directly. The Ebury payload is located in a new\nfile in the library directory with the filename libns2.so. The system’s original\nlibkeyutils.so is then patched to link to this new malicious library instead of libc.so.6.\nThe Ebury code will then be loaded and hook OpenSSH.\n\nUsing this new information gleaned from our monitoring, CERT-Bund has updated its page\nwith the Ebury IOCs.\n\n**In addition to the “Good job, ESET!” from the malware authors, your team has won**\n**the first Virus Bulletin Péter Szőr award for your report on Operation Windigo. How**\n**does that make you feel?**\n\nThere were a lot of excellent papers on malware research this year and I would like to give\ncredit and respect to the other nominees and to all the researchers who have published\ngreat work in the last years.\n\nIn addition to [what was said before, I would like to acknowledge that most of the co-authors](http://www.eset.com/int/about/press/articles/article/eset-researchers-win-peter-szor-award-for-windigo-paper-at-virus-bulletin-conference/)\nand researchers involved in the Operation Windigo paper are newcomers to the anti-virus\nindustry. For us, receiving an award like this is much appreciated recognition from our peers\nand gives us confidence that we are heading in the right direction.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecognition of ESET’s work by malware authors\n\nOur first priority is to protect our customers against all threats, including new and emerging\nones. As a researcher, it is great to be able to focus deeply on a specific threat like this one.\nThanks to ESET’s belief in proper research, we were able to really do a deep investigation\nand protect our customers at the same time. We are really pleased it was so well received\nby the press, our customers and Virus Bulletin.\n\n**Thanks Marc-Etienne for your time.**\n\n15 Oct 2014 - 12:00PM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
