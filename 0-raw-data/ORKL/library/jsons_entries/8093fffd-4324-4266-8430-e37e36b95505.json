    "plain_text": "**Impact of Alleged Russian Cyber Attacks**\n\n_By William C. Ashmore[*]_\n\nDuring a two week period in April and May of 2007 Estonia was the\nvictim of a sustained massive cyber attack on its information infrastructure.\nWhile the cyber attack was not the first nor was it the largest, it was the\nfirst cyber attack that was directed at the national security of a country.\n(Davis, 2009)\n\nThe significance of a cyber attack on a small country can be difficult to\nmeasure for a casual observer. Estonia is a small country that can be seen\nas a model for the future. Estonians have developed and used internet\ntechnology for voting, education, security and banking (ninety-five percent\nof banking operations are done electronically) (Collier, 2007). It is not\nuncommon to see a sign for free Wi-Fi internet access at a pub, restaurant\nor on public transportation.[1]\n\nImagine going to an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), while on a\nbusiness trip, to get money for meals and lodging and the system is down.\nRestaurants and hotels are unable to process your credit card. You try to\nsend a message to your bank, your work, and your family but the computer\nservers are all down. The government is unable to communicate with the\npublic and its different departments. News agencies are having difficulties\npublishing information. The aftermath of a cyber attack can impact anyone\nthat uses the internet, whether it is an individual, business, or government\nthat has been affected. By investigating the attack, how it happened, and\nEstonia’s reaction, states can decide whether their internet defences and\nstrategies are adequate.[2]\n\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia have implications for both its allies and\nadversaries. This article is not meant to establish a complete strategy for\ncyber defence but to create a better understanding of how a cyber attack\ncan have far reaching consequences beyond the immediate aftermath of a\ntargeted infrastructure. What are the implications for Estonia? Is the\nframework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nappropriate for cyber defence? Is an attack against one really an attack\n\n- Willi C A h i M j i U S A\n\n\n-----\n\nagainst all? Does the Organization for Security and Co-operation in\nEurope (OSCE) have the ability to react to cyber attacks? Lastly, does the\nRussian Federation have a coherent cyber strategy that it is willing to use\nand what have been the consequences for Russia?\n\nAny country that uses the internet as part of its infrastructure needs to be\naware of the vulnerabilities and consequences of a cyber attack on their\nsystem. A coherent strategy must include internet defences that are set-up\nin conjunction with technical defences. Currently, legal definitions for\ncyber crimes do not exist in all countries. The international community\nmust examine treaties and update them to better define assistance and\ncommon defence in the event of a cyber attack. Russians have shown the\nability and the desire to use cyber warfare. Cyber strategy by, in defence of,\nor against Russia affects more than computer networks. Although, attacks\nthat originate in China, Japan or the United States may have similar\nimplications they are outside of the scope of this article.\n\nInternet attacks occur on a daily basis throughout the world. How nations\nprepare themselves for an internet attack will determine the impact of a\ncyber attack on their infrastructure. The aim of this article is to achieve a\ngreater understanding of the possible Russian cyber strategy and to\nunderstand the counter measures that can be used to prevent or mitigate\ncyber attacks. This awareness could possibly prevent a tactical defeat\nduring conflict when a cyber attack targeting command and control and\ncommunications infrastructure is blocked.\n\n**1. The media accounts**\n\nInternet trade magazines and mass media reports were used to gather\nevidence on the events surrounding the cyber attack on Estonia. Internet\nsources were a major source of information on the subject of cyber\nsecurity because of the amount of information that is new and has not yet\nbeen published in books. Several Estonian government officials have\nspoken on the issue of cyber attacks at great lengths. Estonian government\ndocuments were also used to analyze the Estonian response to the cyber\nattack. Media accounts along with documents from the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were used to analyze the aftermath of the\nEstonian cyber attack on organizations and other states. Analysis of\nRussian involvement was conducted using western documents.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to understand the reasons behind the Estonian cyber attack this\narticle will explore the social tensions and the cyber attack itself. The\nimpact that the attack had on the different actors will also be noted. The\nreality of the attacks indicates some important implications for Estonia and\nother former Soviet satellites to work with NATO to develop a coherent\ncyber strategy. Russia’s cyber strategy also has considerable significance for\nthe United States. This article will conclude with a summary of possible\ncountermeasures to a cyber attack.\n\n**2. Cyber attack on Estonia**\n\nThe social tensions between Estonians and Estonia’s Russian minority are\nkey to understanding why there was a cyber attack. Estonia is made up of\n1.3 million people where 25.6 percent of the population is Russian (Central\nIntelligence Agency, 2008). In 1918, the Estonians gained their\nindependence from Russia, and in 1940 they were forced into the Soviet\nUnion. From 1940 until they regained their independence in 1991 Estonia\nviewed Russia’s presence as an illegal occupation. Mass deportations were\nmade, people were summarily executed, and the population was resettled\nby ethnic Russians. Russians on the other hand view the Estonians as\nungrateful because they were saved by Russians from the Nazi German\nfascists. Today there exists significant animosity between the Russians and\nthe Estonians that permeate personal relationships and political\ninteractions within the country and between the two nations. (Vesilind,\n2008)[3]\n\nThe actual events that occurred in Estonia centred on the Soviet Bronze\nSoldier monument. The Bronze Soldier monument is a World War II\nSoviet War memorial which memorialized the graves of Soviet Soldiers\nwho died during World War II. However, over time ethnic Russians had\nused the memorial as a rallying site for demonstrations and other forms of\nprotest against the Estonian government. This led to a decision by the\nEstonian government to move the monument to an area that was less\npublic. (Davis, 2009)\n\nThe decision to move the statue led to actual riots in the capital city of\nTallinn on April 27th, 2007. The demonstrations degraded into criminal\nactivities involving looting and the destruction of private and public\nproperty. Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested, most of whom were\n\n\n-----\n\nethnic Russians. The civil unrest was contained, order was restored to the\nstreets by the Estonian government, and most of the physical damage was\nrepaired by the next morning. (Davis, 2009)\n\nDuring this period of civil unrest computers in the Estonian government\nand the Estonian national media were hacked into with significant affect.\nSome of the attacks on the system were vandalism of sites and some were\ndistributed denial of service attacks (a cyber attack that disrupts internet\nservice so that a user cannot access a given computer service). The attacks\nstarted small with a major attack culminating on the Estonian internet\nsystem on May 9th, 2007. This date coincidentally corresponded to the day\nthe Russians celebrate their victory over the Germans in World War II.\nDuring this time a Russian youth-group conducted protests against the\nEstonian ambassador to Russia and against the Estonian Embassy in\nMoscow. The protests against the ambassador and the embassy did not\nend until the ambassador left the country as part of a deal that was\nnegotiated by Germany. The Russian government even suspended\npassenger rail services between Tallinn and St. Petersburg. The riots, the\nprotests, the stopping of rail service, and the cyber attacks led to an\nincreasingly tense relationship between Estonia and Russia. (Davis, 2009;\nKampmark, 2003: 288-293)\n\nThe Estonians were able to respond to the cyber attacks in a very\nproficient manner, as they were able to coordinate responses that only\ncaused relatively short term outages instead of any permanent damage to\ntheir IT infrastructure. The Estonian government was able to employ its\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT) which coordinated IT\nresponses among government and civilian specialists. However, due to the\nambiguous nature of the internet and the use of fake internet protocol (IP)\naddresses the Estonian’s were unable to conclusively prove who initiated\nthe cyber attacks. (Collier, 2007)\n\nThe cyber attacks themselves were not very sophisticated as the attackers\nused techniques that had been in existence for several years. The focus of\nthe cyber attack was to completely shut down the IT structure of Estonia.\nThe cyber attackers used botnet attacks to perform a distributed denial of\nservice rendering systems that use the internet useless. Botnets are hijacked\ncomputers that send out mass amounts of information which overwhelm\nan internet server. The increase in internet traffic will cause a server to\nexceed its bandwidth capabilities and cause it to shut down. The botnets\n\n\n-----\n\ncan be installed well in advance of a planned cyber attack, and they can be\nplaced in any computer anywhere in the world. If the computer user has\nnot installed appropriate protective software on their computer they will\nnot even know that they have been hijacked and that they are participating\nin a cyber attack. The botnet attacks on the Estonian IT structure ended as\nabruptly as they began leading Estonian officials to conclude that the\nattack was a planned and coordinated. (Davis, 2009)\n\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia illustrates the vulnerability of IT structures\nthat rely on the internet. The use of technology can improve personal,\nbusiness, and government interactions but it is still vulnerable to attacks\nand interruptions. The next section of this article will concentrate on the\nimplications for Estonia in the aftermath of the cyber attacks.\n\n**3. Implications for Estonia**\n\nAfter the cyber attacks in 2007, there were several implications for Estonia\nas the country recovered from the cyber wake-up call. Some implications\nhad an immediate impact on the people and the government of Estonia,\nwhile others were more long term and required a deliberate strategy. The\nimmediate implication for Estonia was the loss of services for government,\ncommunication, and banking. What emerged from the attack was Estonia’s\nability to counter and minimize the effects of the attack. There was no\npermanent damage to the information technology (IT) structure and\nfinancial losses were minimal, but the significance was frightening. (Collier,\n2007)\n\nOne of the long term implications is the continued strain on Estonia’s\nrelationship with Russia. Members of the Estonian government and\noutside observers believe that the attacks originated in Russia, but that fact\nremains unproven. The finger pointing between Estonia and Russia began\nimmediately after the attacks and continues today. Dmitry Peskov, Deputy\nPress Secretary for the Russian President said, “Russia can no way be\ninvolved in cyber terrorism and all claims to the contrary are an absolute\nlie” (The Baltic Times, 2007a). Andrus Ansip, the Estonian Prime Minister,\nand others have accused the Russian government because of the\nidentification of Russian internet protocol (IP) addresses used in the attack.\nTo date, Russian involvement has never been proven, but the implications\nand belief that they were involved continues to influence and affect the\nrelationship between Russia and Estonia. (The Baltic Times, 2007b)\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the attacks and recovery, Estonia has been heralded as a leader in\ntechnological security. According to Alexander Ntok, head of Corporate\nStrategy at the International Telecommunication Union, “it was\nimaginative responses that allowed Estonia to emerge from the spring\ncyber attack relatively unscathed” (Collier, 2007). As a result Estonia has\ncapitalized on the internet security market. They are called upon to assist\nduring attacks and to speak to different business and IT groups on internet\nsecurity issues. Estonian government leaders have spoken to allies, regional\norganizations and international organizations to improve IT security and\ncooperation. (Ibid.)\n\nWhen Georgia’s IT infrastructure was attacked in August 2008 specialists\nfrom Estonia’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) travelled to\nGeorgia and assisted response efforts to counter the attacks (DPA, 2008).\nThis example demonstrates how Estonia has established itself as a major\nplayer in an emerging field, as they are too small to make a large impact on\nthe international scene through the use of economic or military power.\nEstonia has been able to establish itself as a major player in Europe and\namong NATO members as an expert in cyber security and cyber war.\nTheir expertise has allowed them to lobby for increased IT awareness and\nfor increased cooperation to defeat or deter future cyber attacks.\n(Nikiforov, 2008)\n\nIn 2003 Estonia proposed a cyber excellence centre in Tallinn even before\nit became a member of NATO. In light of Estonia’s expertise in IT the\nNATO Cyber Defence Centre was approved. In May 2008 the centre\nopened in Tallinn with Estonia providing the leadership and personnel to\nman the centre. Estonia emerged as a leader within NATO and leads the\neffort to protect the IT structure of NATO. (Socor, 2008)\n\nThe continuous threat of cyber attacks against its IT structure, and the\ndedication of public officials to improve IT security resulted in a\ncomprehensive national cyber security strategy. This strategy, developed by\nthe Ministry of Defence, was adopted by the Estonian government in May\nof 2008, just over a year after the attack on its IT systems. The main\nmeasures of its strategy included IT security measures that strengthened\ntheir defensive posture, as well as developed their expertise and awareness\nin the IT field. Estonia now looks to strengthen the international legal\nframework to ensure that the IT system is protected by laws, and that\n\n\n-----\n\nviolators of the law will be prosecuted. Estonia has also taken the charge\nof increasing international co-operation not just to protect their systems\nbut to protect the global cyber system. (Estonian Ministry of Defence,\n2008)\n\n**4. Cyber concerns for former Soviet satellites**\n\nWhat do the countries of Estonia, Georgia, Lithuania and Kyrgyzstan have\nin common? They are all former Soviet satellites and have all been allegedly\ncyber attacked by Russia.\n\n**4.1. Georgian cyber attack**\n\nOn July 20th, 2008 the website of the Georgian president came under a\ndenial of service cyber attack. The attack shut the website down for 24\nhours and was a precursor to a larger cyber attack that would come less\nthan a month later (Melikishvili, 2008/2009). On August 8th, 2008 a\ncoordinated distributed denial of service attack was made against the\nGeorgian government websites at the same time that Russian forces were\nengaged in combat with Georgian forces. As the ground attacks increased\nso did the cyber attacks. This was the first time that a cyber attack was\ndone in conjunction with armed conflict. (Ibid)\n\nThe cyber war between Georgia and Russia focused on shaping public\nopinion on the internet. Georgian and Russian supporters used a variety of\ncyber techniques including distributed denial of service attacks and the\ncreation of fake web sites to control how their version of the “truth” was\ndelivered to the public. (Thomas, 2009:55-59)\n\nGeorgia’s IT infrastructure was not very advanced so the disruption of\nservice was not as complicated as it was in Estonia. Banking, media and\ngovernment websites were blocked disrupting the flow of information\nthroughout Georgia and to the outside world. The websites of the Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs and the National Bank were vandalized by adding\npictures of the Georgian President and Adolf Hitler (Melikishvili,\n2008/2009). The cyber attacks against Georgia were different from the\ncyber attacks on Estonia, as these attacks included distributed denial of\nservices using botnets, but they also included SQL injection attacks that are\nharder to identify than a botnet attack because they require less computers\nthan a botnet attack. The SQL injection attack shows a greater expertise in\n\n\n-----\n\nthe ability to conduct a cyber attack than the cyber attacks on Estonia’s IT\ninfrastructure. (Secure Works Press Release, 2008)\n\nGeorgia received considerable assistance in countering the cyber attacks\nand in communicating internally and internationally. _Google provided_\ndomain space to protect the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nand _Civil.ge, a Georgian Daily online news service. A private American_\ninternet service provider (the head of the company is an ethnic Georgian)\nassisted the Georgian government by hosting the Georgian President’s\nwebsite. The President of Poland also assisted the Georgian government\nby placing official press releases on his website. Estonia even sent two\ninformation security specialists from its Computer Emergency Response\nTeam to assist Georgia in countering the cyber attacks. According to\noutside investigators there is no direct proof of any Russian government\ninvolvement in the cyber attacks. But what is undeniable is that even\nwithout proven Russian government involvement it remains clear that the\nRussian government benefited from the cyber attacks. (Melikishvili,\n2008/2009)\n\n**4.2. Lithuanian cyber attack**\n\nLithuania faced its own attacks in June 2008 three days after it passed a law\noutlawing the use of Soviet and communist symbols; over 300 websites\nwere attacked. Some were denial of service attacks while other sites were\nvandalized with the Soviet hammer and sickle. Prior to the attacks and the\npassage of the law, Russian and Lithuanian ties had deteriorated because of\nRussia’s refusal to compensate Lithuanian victims of Soviet labour camps,\nand Russia’s leveraging of energy resources for political gain. Lithuania also\nblocked talks on an EU-Russia partnership. The animosities between the\ntwo countries have provided observers with a clear motive that the attacks\nwere by the Russians. The reason for the cyber attacks against Lithuania\nwas similar to the cyber attacks against Estonia, both attacks were in\nresponse to a government action that was unpopular to the Russian\npeople. (McLaughlin, 2008)\n\n**4.3. Kyrgyzstan cyber attack**\n\nThe latest country that has come under a cyber attack from computers in\nRussia is Kyrgyzstan. On January 18th, 2009 Kyrgyzstan’s two main\ninternet servers came under a denial of service attacks shutting down\n\n\n-----\n\nwebsites and email within the country. The originators of the attacks were\ntraced back to Russia (Rhoads, 2009). The attacks occurred on the same\nday that the Russian government was pressuring Kyrgyzstan to stop U.S.\naccess to the airbase at Bishkek at Manas. The airbase is a key logistics\ncentre that supports the U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan. According to Don\nJackson, a senior security researcher at SecureWorks[4], the distributed denial\nof service attacks are believed to be directed towards any opposition that is\nnot in favour of the closure of the airbase. While it is unproven whether\nthe government was behind the attacks the implication is that cyber attacks\nwill be used against any opposition to the Russian government (Bradbury,\n2009).\n\nThe cyber attacks on Georgia, Lithuania and Kyrgyzstan have two\ncharacteristics in common. The first characteristic is that the cyber attacks\nwere initiated because of opposition to the Russian government and\nsecondly that there is no proof that the Russian government was involved\nin the cyber attacks. Regardless of who is initiating the attack it is clear that\nopposition to the Russian government could result in a cyber attack which\ncould disrupt critical government infrastructure.\n\n**5. Compelling realities for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization**\n\nCyber defence is a critical issue for NATO. U.S. General James Mattis,\nNATO’s Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation, articulates the\nimportance of cyber defence for NATO by stating, “We cannot say that\nwe are not going to defend the Web that everybody needs” (Tanner &\nPeach, 2008). Nations that are party to the North Atlantic Treaty agree on\nArticle 5 “that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or\nNorth America shall be considered an attack against them all…” (The\nNorth Atlantic Treaty, 1949). Does a cyber attack fit the requirement of an\narmed attack? A senior NATO official asked, “If a member state’s\ncommunications centre is attacked with a missile, you call it an act of war.\nSo what do you call it if the same installation is disabled with a cyberattack?” (The Economist, 2007). However, the current political reality is\nthat they are not the same. Prior to the cyber attacks on Estonia, NATO’s\ncyber strategy was focused on NATO’s ability to protect its own IT\ninfrastructure. Now, the current reality is, is that the NATO’s strategy\nmust focus on assisting allies as they protect their own IT infrastructure\nduring an attack (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undated a).\n\n\n-----\n\nMembers of NATO have taken several steps in defining a cyber strategy\nand implementing a cyber defence. As early as 2002, at the Prague Summit,\ncyber defence appeared on NATO’s agenda. At the Prague Summit\nNATO leaders agreed to the implementation of a NATO Cyber Defence\nProgram. The program consisted of a NATO Computer Incident\nResponse Capability and for NATO to use the latest cyber defence\nmeasures (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undated a). In the spring of\n2006 cyber defence was made a priority for NATO during the Riga\nSummit. The issue of cyber security gained even more attention when\nEstonia, a NATO member, was cyber attacked in 2007 (EU News, Policy\nPositions & EU Actors online, 2008).\n\nNATO conducted a thorough assessment of its IT structure and how it\nwould defend itself against a cyber attack. This assessment led to an\nOctober 2007 report on cyber defence that was issued to the Allied\nDefence Ministers. The report recommended measures to improve\nprotection against cyber attacks (North Atlantic Treaty Organization,\nundated a). What followed was a cyber defence policy in early 2008 and the\ncreation of a NATO Centre of Excellence for cyber defence in May 2008\n(North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 2008a). In April 2008, during the\nBucharest Summit, cyber defence was part of the summit declaration. The\ndeclaration emphasizes the need to protect key information systems, the\nsharing of best practices, and for Allied nations to provide assistance to\ncounter a cyber attack (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 2008b).\n\nEven though not all NATO nations are part of the Cyber Defence Centre\nthe centre works to enhance the cyber defence capabilities of all NATO\nmembers. The centre itself is not even funded by NATO but by the\nnations that participate in the running of the centre of excellence. The\ncentre has been charged with doctrine and concept development,\nawareness and training, research, development, analysis, and lessons\nlearned. The experts at the centre also serve as cyber defence consultants\nfor NATO members North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undated b).\n\nThe compelling reality for NATO is that cyber warfare has affected\nmember nations and continuous to be a realistic threat for the organization\nand for its members. NATO members are continuing to develop ways to\ncounter future threats by sharing best practice information, information on\ntechnical cyber defences, and by agreeing to assist member nations in\ncountering a cyber attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**6. Multilateral initiatives**\n\nOnly a few international treaties on cyber security exist making\ninternational cooperation to prevent cyber attacks extremely difficult. Even\nfinding and then holding accountable a person that commits a cyber crime\nis almost impossible without some international cooperation (Organization\nfor Security and Co-Operation in Europe, 2008). In the aftermath of the\ncyber attacks on Estonia the European Union commissioned a study to\nexamine the issues concerning cyber security facing members of the\nEuropean Union. This section will examine the European Union study and\nother multinational initiatives that have an impact on the cyber security of\nformer Soviet satellites and Russia. (Cornish, 2009)\n\n**6.1. Convention on Cybercrime**\n\nThe Council of Europe has established a treaty on cyber crime that entered\ninto force[5] in 2004. Twenty-two Council of Europe member nations, along\nwith the United States, have ratified the treaty agreeing to international\ncooperation concerning cybercrime issues. The Russian Federation has not\nagreed to the treaty making it difficult for states to resolve issues with\nRussia concerning cyber crimes in an international forum (Council of\nEurope, undated a). This treaty is still significant because it is the first\ninternational treaty on crimes committed on the internet (Council of\nEurope, undated b).\n\nThe main goal of the convention, as stated in the preamble, is to protect\nnations against cybercrime, by adopting laws and regulations, and fostering\nco-operation internationally. The states that become a party to the\nConvention on Cybercrime agree to adopt laws that create criminal\npenalties for committing crimes on the internet. The convention outlines\nseveral areas that states have agreed to make criminal statutes on issues\nsuch as illegal access of computer systems, system and data interference,\nand other computer related fraud. Nations that are party to the convention\nalso agree to cooperate with investigations, to provide mutual assistance\nconcerning cyber crimes, and to pursue the collection of evidence. The\nextradition of alleged cybercriminals is also agreed to by parties to the\ntreaty. Disagreements between states that have ratified the treaty include\ndirect negotiations, settlement in front of the European Committee on\nCrime Problems (CDPC), a tribunal for arbitration or adjudication in front\n\n\n-----\n\nof the International Court of Justice. The Convention on Cybercrime gave\na framework for cooperation among member states for the prosecution of\ncyber criminals by removing safe havens for the cyber criminals. (Council\nof Europe, 2001)\n\nHowever, Russia does agree to the convention and it protects citizens who\nengage in cyber misconduct by preventing their extradition out of Russia.\nFailing to sign the convention agreement also prevents Russia from having\nany legal standing to prosecute trans-national cyber criminals who attack\nRussia’s IT infrastructure.\n\n**6.2. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe**\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has a\ntradition of promoting the security and stability of Europe. This tradition\nof promoting security and stability since 2004 has included cyber security.\nThe OSCE’s initial focus on cyber security concerned the use of the\ninternet for recruiting, fundraising, and communication by terrorist\norganizations. In 2006 the OSCE’s efforts began to focus on protecting\nvital information infrastructures against cyber attacks. Debate in the OSCE\nhas not led to great change but has been a forum for further cooperation\nin cyber security in Europe. In June 2008, the Estonian Defence Minister,\nJaak Aaviksoo, in an address to members of the OSCE, said there is “an\nimmense amount of work to be done [concerning cyber security].”\nMinister Aaviksoo used the forum of the OSCE to use his nation’s\nexperience in defending against cyber crime to increase international\ncooperation in Europe. This statement by the Estonian Defence Minister\nsums up OSCE’s efforts concerning cyber defence, they are still in the\ntalking phase and have at least recognized the importance of cyber defence\n(Cornish, 2009:20-21). The OSCE will continue to be a forum to publicize\ngrievances for European nations that have had their IT infrastructures\nattacked by Russian hackers. European nations will judge Russia on its\ncooperation with the OSCE in finding and prosecuting individuals who\nengage in cyber attacks.\n\n**6.3. The European Union**\n\nEstonia continues to lobby for improved international cooperation in\ncyber security as it calls on the European Union (EU) to pass legislation\nconcerning crimes committed on the internet. While addressing the\n\n\n-----\n\nEuropean Parliament, Toomas Hendrik, the Estonian President, called\nupon the EU to pass legislation that make cyber attacks against public and\nprivate web sites a criminal act (Jones, 2008). The EU has several initiatives\ninvolving different agencies but lacks an overall cyber security strategy. The\nEuropean Commission has the Information Society and Media Directorate\nGeneral, the European Network and Information Security Agency\n(ENISA), and the Contact Network of Spam Authorities that deal with\ndifferent aspects of cyber security. The Information Society and Media\nDirectorate has a program to improve the content of the internet by\nprotecting people from child pornography, racism, and other harmful\nonline content. The ENISA is an agency that was created in 2004 to raise\nawareness of cyber security issues and to promote best practices by\nmember nations with the EU. The Contact Network of SPAM authorities\nis an initiative to counter SPAM and share information on best practices\nbetween EU member nations. (Cornish, 2009:24-27)\n\nThe European Parliament has established several standing committees\nconcerned with cyber security issues. The Committee on Industry,\nResearch, and Technology (ITRE) is concerned with establishing\ninformation technology networks within the EU. The Committee on Civil\nLiberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) is responsible of the\nprotection of personal information on the internet for members of the\nEU. The Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible for the Security and\nSecurity policies of the EU which includes internet security policies.\n(Cornish, 2009:26)\n\nThe European Police Office (EUROPOL) is an agency of the Police and\nJudicial Co-operation (PJC) that has more of a direct role in EU cyber\nsecurity in the context of combating terrorism, organized crime, and\nfinancial crime (Cornish, 2009:25). Although cyber security is addressed by\nthe EU there is no organization within the EU to ensure that there are no\ncontradictions in cyber security policy among all of the various EU\nagencies, commissions, and co-operations. The European Parliament\ncommissioned a study on cyber security published February 2009 that\nexamined security challenges concerning the internet for the EU. The\nstudy recommended that clear roles should be defined for cyber security\nresponses with the many EU organizations, including the establishment of\nthe post of cyber security coordinator and the establishment of a common\noperating vision for cyber security in order to achieve operational\nconsistency across the EU (Cornish, 2009:31). The EU and Russia work\n\n\n-----\n\ntogether on different challenges including drug and human trafficking,\norganized crime, and counter-terrorism. Russia is also the EU’s third\nlargest trading partner (European Commission, 2009). The EU’s cyber\nsecurity organizations can offer a framework for increased cooperation to\ndefeat cyber attacks that originate from or are directed at Russia.\n\n**6.4. The United Nations**\n\nThe main purpose of the United Nations (UN) is to maintain international\npeace and security among the different nations of the world (United\nNations, 1945). The focus for cyber security for the UN, through the UN\nSecurity Council, has been on countering terrorism. Debates among the\nUN General Assembly started in 2002 highlighted the growing dependence\non IT use. Out of discussions came a warning that law enforcement\nactivities would not be sufficient but that more efforts in cyber security\nneed to be made on prevention. (Cornish, 2009:17)\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the main\norganization that is responsible for cyber security within the UN\nframework. The ITU’s goal is to enhance cyber security in order for\nindividuals, businesses and nations to have confidence in the use of\ncyberspace. The ITU uses its Global Cyber Security Agenda, which began\nin 2007, to promote its goals of increased cyber security. The ITU has not\nbeen an agency for the enforcement of legislation and international\nagreements concerning cyber security but has focused on assisting in\nbuilding nation’s capabilities for cyber security (Cornish, 2009:17-18).\nFormer Soviet satellites can cooperate with the ITU to improve their cyber\ndefences against cyber criminals from Russia or any other nation. The UN\nwill continue to be a forum for Russia to voice grievances or defend\nthemselves against world opinion in matters involving international peace\nand security including cyber security.\n\n**6.5. Relevance of multilateral initiatives**\n\nAlthough the Russian government cooperates with Europe and other\nnations on a variety of economic and security issues, individuals,\norganizations, and governments are able to exploit the weaknesses of the\ninternational system in order to use the internet for criminal activities\nwithout fear of any major reprisals. Significant effort has been made\ntowards cyber security since the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007, but much\n\n\n-----\n\nmore needs to be done among national and international organizations to\nensure genuine cyber security. The framework for increasing cyber security\nexists, but it will take the cooperation of many nations, including Russia, to\nmake a difference in cyber security.\n\n**7. Implications for the United States**\n\nThe cyber attack on Estonia should be considered a significant wake-up\ncall for the United States. Even though the attacks had no direct impact on\nthe U.S., Estonia is a NATO ally and the attack clearly showed aggressive\nintent seeking advantage. When the attacks occurred the U.S. sent experts\nto assist and help Estonia with its cyber defences. Jaak Aaviksoo, the\nEstonian Defence Minister, was told by U.S. officials that Estonia coped\nbetter than the U.S. is likely could in responding to a cyber attack. The\nEstonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was able to\nconcentrate on protecting vital sites by coordinating government and\npublic efforts. They were also able to create diversions which caused\nhackers to attack sites which were already disabled or not very important.\n(Collier, 2007)\n\nThe cyber attack on Estonia demonstrated the importance of legal\nobligations for the U.S. in rendering support to its allies during a cyber\nattack (Gee, 2008). The cyber attack also showed the vulnerability of an IT\nsystem, raising the question, if it could happen to Estonia could another\ntrans-national cyber attack of this magnitude happen in the U.S. (Griggs,\n2008)? The convention on cybercrime, which the U.S. is a party to,\noutlines principles for providing mutual assistance regarding cybercrime\n(Council of Europe, 2001). The convention does not mention cyber\nattacks or cyber war but treats such activities as crimes (Korns &\nKastenberg, 2008/2009). Because only 23 countries have agreed to this\ntreaty, its force in the international community is limited (Gee, 2008).\n\nSeveral members of NATO are participating in the Cyber Defence Centre\nof Excellence that was established in Estonia, but the U.S. only agreed to\nthe creation of the cyber defence centre as an observer. The cyber defence\ncentre is working on issues of cyber security that affect NATO along with\nthe U.S (The Associated Press, 2008). What will the U.S.’s response be if a\ncyber attack destroys infrastructure and kills citizens in an allied country,\nand then that ally declares war because of the attack? The plausibility of\nsuch an attack was demonstrated in 2007 when scientists from the Idaho\n\n\n-----\n\nNational Laboratory demonstrated how a cyber attack could cause a power\nplant to overload its system, begin to smoke, and then break down which\ncaused physical damage to equipment. Currently, both international law\nand NATO’s framework lack coherent responses that are legal in the event\nof such an attack. The cyber attackers could limit options for the U.S.\nunder such a scenario by routing their cyber attack through countries\nwhich do not have laws or agreements to cooperate with the U.S. The\ncyber attacker could remain completely anonymous if the country where\nthe attack was routed through refused to hand over information identifying\nthe cyber attackers. (Gee, 2008)\n\nCyber attacks on the U.S. government IT infrastructure are not new. In\nMarch 1998 a cyber attack was launched against computer systems of the\nU.S. government, private universities and research labs computer systems\nthat lasted for over three years. Government investigators named the\nattacks “Moonlight Maze.” The cyber attacks targeted gaining access to\nsensitive but unclassified information (Abreu, 2001). John Adams, a\nNational Security Agency (NSA) consultant says that government\ninvestigators have identified seven internet addresses involved in the cyber\nattacks that originated in Russia. Dion Stempfley, a former Pentagon\ncomputer analyst, believes that the U.S. prove that the Russian Federation\ngovernment is sponsoring the attacks but there is evidence that they are\nallowing or otherwise permitting the cyber attacks. The cyber attacks\nwhich resulted in the theft of technical defence information were serious\nenough that the U.S. State Department issued a formal complaint to the\nRussian Federation. (Loeb, 2001)\n\nIn _Global Trends 2025, a study conducted by the National Intelligence_\nCouncil, states over the next two decades non-military aspects of warfare,\nincluding cyber, will be prominent (National Intelligence Council, 2008).\nAccording to Secure Works, a cyber security company, in 2008 over 20\nmillion attacks originated from computers within the United States (Secure\nWorks Press Release, 2008). In 2008 the U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity created the National Cybersecurity Centre to counter these threats\n(Griggs, 2008). The threats to the U.S. infrastructure and technology are\nmoving at a much faster pace than the creation of government structures\nto counter the threat.\n\nEven a casual observer can see that there is a cyber threat to the U.S., but\nhow is that connected to any Russian involvement in cyber attacks? There\n\n\n-----\n\nare three recent examples of how cyber attacks, that may have allegedly\noriginated in Russia, that demonstrate danger for U.S. and Russian\nrelations. These examples show how attacks against an IT structure were\nused as cyber pressure to influence nations or organizations.\n\nThe first example is when Radio Free Europe’s internet sites in April 2008\nin Eastern Europe were shut down because of a denial of service attack.\nThe attack lasted two days and coincided with the planned coverage of the\nanniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The attacks effectively shut\ndown the websites which stopped the flow of information from Radio\nFree Europe, a U.S. sponsored program (America.gov, 2008).\n\nAnother example is the malware (malware is a term used to identify illegal\ncomputer access including computer viruses) attack on U.S. Department of\nDefence computer systems in November 2008. According to _WMD_\n_Insights[6] the computer attacks are thought to have originated from Russia._\nThe attacks seemed to target military computer systems and affected the\nU.S. central command along with computers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The\nattacks led to a ban on the use of external computer flash drives on\nmilitary computers throughout the world. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)\n\nThe latest example of an attack that may have originated in Russia is the\nJanuary 2009 denial of service attack that was directed at the government\nwebsites of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. One theory on why the attack was\nstarted was because of Kyrgyzstan’s support of the U.S. in its war on terror\nin Afghanistan. This shows the significance of a cyber attack not directed\nagainst the U.S. but against one of its allies. (Rhoads, 2009)\n\nOne senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in\nWashington, D.C. believes there is no adversary that can defeat the U.S. in\ncyber space. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\ncommented that the U.S. government is able to protect itself from cyber\nattacks, but the U.S. IT system is not completely impenetrable. The\ndirector of a non-profit research institute, the United States Cyber\nConsequences Unit, stated that because the U.S. controls so much internet\nbandwidth that most of the people that want to harm the U.S. lack the\ncapabilities to shut down U.S. servers. (Griggs, 2008)\n\nThe U.S. faces a wide variety of challenges in protecting its own IT\nstructure along with facing the reality of the challenges of its allies’ cyber\n\n\n-----\n\ndefences. In the future the U.S. may face cyber attacks that could cause the\ndeaths of its or its allies’ citizens due to the effects of a cyber attack on an\nelectrical system. The U.S.’s bilateral agreements with countries that hold a\nstrategic U.S. interest could be affected by the use of a cyber attack to\ninfluence leaders. The cyber threats to the U.S. are real and continued\nattention by the leaders must focus on this threat.\n\n**8. The weakest link – the computer user**\n\nAs you read this article you could be an accomplice to a cyber criminal\nwithout even knowing that your computer is conducting a worldwide\ndistributed denial of service attack. The actions or lack of action of\ncomputer users have contributed to the ability of hackers in Russia and\nelsewhere to conduct their attacks in relative anonymity.[7] The internet has\nvulnerabilities and the individual computer user contributes to the\nvulnerabilities of private and government IT systems.\n\nIn 1997 the National Security Agency (NSA) conducted an exercise to find\nout how vulnerable government IT systems were to external cyber attacks.\nThey named the exercise “Eligible Receiver.” Thirty-five IT specialists\nwere given the mission to hack into government systems. They could use\nany software programs that were available on the internet and they were\nonly given a few limitations. The IT specialists couldn’t use any classified\nhacking software that belonged to the NSA and they could not violate U.S.\nlaw. The IT specialists were also confined to U.S. government computer\nsystems. (Verton, 2003:32-33)\n\nWhat they discovered was how easy it was to hack into government\nsystems, into both classified and unclassified networks. With the free\nsoftware that they downloaded from the internet, the NSA specialists were\nable to conduct distributed denial of service attacks, delete or modify\nsensitive information and shut down or reformat systems. Along with the\nsoftware they used, personal contact methods were also used to gain access\ninto the systems. The NSA computer specialists would use telephone calls\nor emails to gain passwords or entry into a system by posing as a\nsupervisor or technician. The IT specialists were surprised at how easily\ngovernment and military members delivered their passwords without\nquestion. Even though the exercise was conducted in 1997, and may seem\ndated, it gives us a great example of how a dedicated effort can disrupt any\nIT system. (Verton, 2003:32-33)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted earlier, external flash drives were banned from use with military\ncomputer systems. Authorized users unknowingly passed intrusive\nmalware files from computer to computer infecting IT systems throughout\nthe U.S. Central Command. The ban on flash drives complicated the\nsharing of information throughout the theatre. The malware file was even\nfound on a classified network. This is one more example of how an\nindividual can spread malicious software infecting multiple computer\nsystems because of a lack of computer security protocols. (Melikishvili,\n2008/2009)\n\nOne vulnerability that is associated with computer users is that some\npeople who become hackers are former employees with a grievance against\ntheir former employer. Such people may be motivated by a personal\ngrudge against the U.S. government because they were fired or lost their\njob due to a reorganization or downsizing. Their actions as hackers are\nusually malicious in nature as such people steal or corrupt data, deface\nwebsites, or shut down systems. (Conway, 2007:82)\n\nEven more dangerous than an angry former employee is a case of cyber\nespionage. This is where an individual who is motivated by money or\nideology sells highly sensitive IT security information. One such case\ninvolves Herman Simm and his wife, Heete Simm, from Estonia\n(Melikishvili, 2008/2009). Mr. Simm was arrested in September 2008 for\nallegedly passing highly classified information on cyber security and missile\ndefence to members of the Russian foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Mr.\nSimm was the head of the State Secret Protection Office where he was\nresponsible for protecting Estonia’s classified information. Mrs. Simm was\na lawyer who was previously employed at the Estonian national police\nheadquarters. Mr. Simm had access to classified information concerning\nNATO and allies of Estonia including the operational information of the\nNATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre based in Tallinn. If the\nEstonian government had access to a secret so did Mr. Simm. The amount\nof classified information that was compromised is unknown, but may be\nquite large. Mr. Simms allegedly became a Russian spy in the mid-1990’s\nand was paid millions of dollars from the Russian Government. Regardless\nof how secure a country’s IT structure is, it is still vulnerable because some\npeople will compromise sensitive cyber security information for personal\ngain. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)\n\n\n-----\n\nAlong with the vulnerabilities already mentioned there are always problems\nwith software products. Some software is easy for hackers to take\nadvantage of because of security deficiencies. Computers may be infected\nbefore the user or software company has identified the problem. Then it\nwill take time for the software company to produce a security patch. It will\ntake even more time to get the patch to the computer program user and\nfor the security patch to be installed. During this time the infected\ncomputer program may have already infected other computers in a system\nor throughout the internet. (Wilson, 2006:15-16)\n\nA major vulnerability for any IT system is the computer user. Whether the\ncomputer user is a military member, a government employee, or just a\ncomputer user sitting in front of his computer at home, their practices can\ncause serious damage to a computer system. Normal computer users\nreceive little or no training in the best security practices. (Wilson, 2006:14)\n\nThe cost of poor security practices can be high. Along with the loss of data\nor the disruption of service there is also the physical cost associated with\nmalware and viruses. For example, in 2007 the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) uncovered a botnet campaign that caused losses of\nover 20 million dollars (Cornish, 2009:9). One of the botnet hackers that\nwas caught by the FBI and sentenced to prison used botnets to steal\npeoples’ identities and bank account information. After gaining access to\npersonal information and passwords he made on-line purchases and\ntransferred money from the bank accounts. Another cyber attacker used a\nphishing scheme where he collected information through infected emails\n(Wired Staff, 2009). This section highlighted how the computer user has\nmade IT structures even more vulnerable and the Simm affair\ndemonstrates how cyber espionage adds to that vulnerability. If countries\nlike the U.S. and Estonia that have highly developed IT infrastructure can\nbe attacked, it is not hard to imagine the vulnerabilities less developed\nformer Soviet satellites have in their IT development phase.\n\n**9. The Russian Federation**\n\nIn this article study several cyber attacks have been attributed to Russia.\nRegardless of whether the government of Russia is responsible for the\nattacks, or merely sanctioned them, for many the perception remains that\nRussia was behind the cyber attacks. I will examine Russia’s use of cyber\nwarfare against former Soviet satellite states. (Davis, 2009)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Russian government views itself as the victim in the case of the cyber\nattacks on Estonia in 2007. According to sources in the Kremlin the\nwebsite of the President of Russia came under a cyber attack. This was\nsupposedly the largest attack the Russians have faced and it appeared that\nthe servers used to originate the attack were located in the Baltic States.\nThe Deputy Press Secretary of the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov,\ncountered accusations from Estonia with the fact that Russian government\nwebsites are under attack every day from all over the world. (The Baltic\nTimes, 2007a)\n\nEven as cyber attacks occurred against Georgia, Russians said that they\nwere also the victims of cyber attacks. Russia Today[8], a major media source\nin Russia, was shut down because of a denial of service attacks directed\ntowards its websites. IT security specialists that work for _Russia Today_\nbelieve that the denial of service attacks originated from Tbilisi, the capital\nof Georgia. (Watson, 2008)\n\nIn the aftermath of the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, and other\nattacks mentioned in this article, the Russian response was to deny any\ninvolvement in any cyber attack. When confronted with evidence that\nsome of the attacks originated from Russian government computers\nmembers of the Russian government countered with the fact that\ncomputers from all over the world were hijacked and used to attack\ndifferent computer systems. (The Baltic Times, 2007a)\n\nAnother fact that Russian officials are quick to point out is that the only\nperson arrested for the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia was an Estonian.\nDmitri Galushkevich, a 20 year old ethnic Russian, who was convicted for\nthe cyber attacks. Some members of the Estonian government have issued\nstatements doubting the involvement of the Russian government in the\ncyber attacks. (Greenberg, 2008)\n\nWith the finger pointing that ensues after a cyber attack it is still unclear\nwho was behind the attacks. The actions of cyber activist groups, or\nhactivists, will be examined in the case of the cyber attacks on Estonia and\nGeorgia. Hactivists are individuals that use cyber attacks to take a patriotic\nor political stand on a political or international issue. (Melikishvili,\n2008/2009)\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the protests in Estonia, increased chatter and postings on how to\nconduct and participate in denial of service attacks were found on Russian\ninternet chat sites (Melikishvili, 2008/2009). Along with the denial of\nservice attacks, some of the Estonian government websites were hacked in\norder to deface the site. The sayings on the websites were very pro Russian\nand very anti Estonian. Joshua Davis in Wired Magazine supports the view\nthat the reason behind the attacks was nothing more than Russian pride.\n(Davis, 2009)\n\nIn March of 2009 a member of a Russian pro-Kremlin youth group,\nKonstantin Goloskokov, publicly took responsibility for creating the 2007\ncyber attacks on Estonia. Goloskokov is a leader of the youth movement\n_Nashi that has routinely conducted cyber attacks and intimidation_\ncampaigns on behalf of the Russian government. The government of the\nRussian Federation is able to maintain separation from the youth group\nbecause it does not directly fund their activities. The youth groups are\nfunded by pro-government business owners who are trying to gain favour\nfrom the Russian government (Shachtman, 2009). Goloskokov believes\nthat his actions were not illegal but were, “an act of civil disobedience\norganized within the confines of virtual space” (Buranov, Vodo &\nYegikyan, 2009). The cultural aspects or belief that actions in the cyber\nworld are beyond the law is a consequence for the Russian government\nand how cyber attacks affect their international relationships.\n\nAn assistant to Sergei Markov, a member of Russia’s State Duma lower\nhouse, has also admitted to using his own initiative to conduct cyber\nattacks against Estonia (Baltic News Service, 2009). Rein Lang, the\nEstonian Justice Minister, is contemplating issuing a European arrest\nwarrant for individuals who have admitted to taking part in the attack. The\nidea for the warrant is not to send law enforcement officials into Russia,\nbut to have the alleged perpetrators arrested whenever they leave the\ncountry (Baltic News Service, 2009). Aleksandr Gostev, director of the\nKaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, explains that hackers\nwho participate in a distributed denial of service attack violate the Russian\nCriminal Code (Article 274, _Violation of the Rules Governing the Use of_\n_Computers, Computer Systems, or Networks Thereof) and can be imprisoned for_\nfour years for violating the code. But he also states that the article is rarely\nused (Buranov, Vodo & Yegikyan, 2009). The examples of Russian citizens\nadmitting to participating in the Estonian cyber attacks are grounds for\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian citizens to be arrested in other parts of Europe if Russia fails to\nuphold its own laws.\n\nSimilar actions occurred in the Georgian cyber attacks. Messages were\nposted on Russian hacker forums on how to participate in shutting down\nGeorgian websites. The website StopGeorgia.ru was also established as a\nprivate forum to coordinate the denial of service attacks. Jeff Carr, a\nnetwork security expert and cyber analyst, established an all volunteer\ngroup to investigate the cyber attacks. Throughout the course of the\ninvestigation, which they named Project Grey Goose, no evidence was found\nto implicate the Russian government. This was just another example of a\nhactivist movement which had the collective power to conduct a cyber\nattack against a government. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)\n\nThe _Project Grey Goose investigation has looked at hactivists and how they_\ncan independently conduct cyber attacks. It also focused on a criminal\ngang known as the Russian Business Network (R.B.N.). The R.B.N. is based\nin St. Petersburg and engages in criminal cyber activities. According to\nDon Jackson, the director of threat intelligence at Secure Works, some of\nthe cyber attacks used against Georgian websites originated from\ncomputers under the control of the R.B.N. As is the case with any cyber\nattacks it is very difficult to establish who is completely responsible or if\nthere is any Russian government sanctioned involvement. (Markoff, 2008a)\n\nThis article has already noted that there are other groups involved with\ncyber attacks against former Soviet satellites. The evidence of Russian\ngovernment involvement will now be investigated (Davis, 2009). Indeed,\nsome statements made by Russian government officials suggest Russian\ngovernment involvement in cyber attacks. Prior to the cyber attacks in\nEstonia the Russian government protested the movement of the Russian\nmemorial, the Bronze Soldier, to the Estonian government. The Russian\ngovernment warned how disastrous the move would be to Estonia. What\nfollowed were the protests and the cyber attacks. (Davis, 2009)\n\nThe head of the Russian Army Centre for Military Forecast, Colonel\nAnatoly Tsyganok, made comments to the Russian news outlet, _Gazeta,_\nabout the cyber attacks on Estonia. He believes that there was nothing\nwrong with the attacks because there are no international agreements\nestablished. Colonel Tsyganok also believes that NATO couldn’t do\n\n\n-----\n\nanything to stop the attacks, and that they were highly successful.\n(prygi.blogspot.com[9], 2008)\n\nThe most telling example of Russian government involvement in cyber\nwarfare was with Herman Simm selling IT secrets to the Russian Foreign\nIntelligence Service that was discussed earlier in this article. This examples\nshows that the government of the Russian Federation is actively seeking\ninformation on cyber defences and is willing to pay large sums of money\n(Mr. Simm is accused of selling cyber security secrets for millions of\ndollars) to receive information on cyber security. (Melikishvili, 2008/2009)\n\nThere are also cases where cyber attacks were used against people who are\nin opposition to the Russian government. One such example is with Gary\nKasparov, Russian opposition party leader, had his website shut down for\ntwo weeks due to denial of service attacks during the Russian presidential\ncampaign. John Palfrey, a researcher at Harvard Law School, believes that\nseveral organizations in Russia who plan to protest, or act in opposition to\nthe Russian government, are subjected to cyber attacks in an attempt to\ncontrol the information that is getting to the public. (Greenberg, 2008)\n\nAnother example of Russian government complicity is the lack of\nassistance or interest in tracking down those responsible for the cyber\nattacks against governments of former Soviet satellites (Davis, 2009). The\nevidence of government involvement remains circumstantial, but certain\nfacts are clear concerning cyber security and former Soviet satellites. If\nthere is opposition to Russian Federation policy than that country that is in\nopposition is likely to be subject to a cyber attack and it has been shown\nthat the Russian Federation actively collects information on other\ncountries cyber defences.\n\n**10. The future of Russian cyber warfare**\n\nThe perception exists among different nations (some of those nations have\nbeen discussed earlier in this study) that the government of the Russian\nFederation has been involved in cyber attacks. This section will examine\nfuture trends concerning the use of cyber attacks by, or sanctioned by, the\nRussian Federation government. The cyber attacks against Estonia and\nGeorgia have forced Russia to evaluate its future cyber strategy. In\nexamining the Russian focus on improving its cyber strategy some\n\n\n-----\n\nconclusions can be drawn about the future of Russian cyber warfare.\n(Panarin, 2008)\n\nAs with many countries that have an advanced IT system, a sub-culture of\nhacking has developed. Even though the state sponsored university in St.\nPetersburg produces computer programmers that are highly regarded it is\nbelieved that most of the hackers are young and not educated at the\nuniversity level. The reason behind the growth of Russian computer\nhackers is the prestige and monetary reward that hacking garners in a\ngrowing IT infrastructure. (Varoli, 2000)\n\nThe criminal organization, R.B.N., has been able to conduct its cyber\nactivities with little interference from the Russian Federation government.\nThe R.B.N. is very difficult to track on the internet as they are able to\nlocate their activities from several different locations. The group has been\ninvolved in several different types of criminal cyber activities such as the\nuse of malware, identity theft, and child pornography. Without any\nconcerted effort to stop the R.B.N., and their ability to operate anywhere,\nR.B.N. is an organization that is positioned in Russian cyber activities now\nand in the future. (Markoff, 2008a)\n\nOne example of latitude and scope created by Russian indifference, a\ngroup identified by a computer security firm as a Russian gang conducted a\nbotnet based computer operation operating in Wisconsin. The Russian\ngang was controlling as many as 100000 computers in an effort to steal\npasswords and information. As soon as the system was shut down the\nRussian gang moved its host computer system to a site in the Ukraine. This\nshows how resilient these gangs are when they can relocate their operating\nsystems to countries that are out of reach of law enforcement of the\ncountry that they are targeting. (Markoff, 2008b)\n\nThe Russian responses to the recent cyber attacks are a guide to how they\nwill react in the future. Valery Yashenko, vice director of the Institute of\nInformation Security Issues at Lomonosov Moscow State University,\nadvises the Russian government on the issues of cyber terrorism.\nYashenko believes that there should be greater international cooperation\nconcerning cyber security but does not think that the cyber attack on\nEstonia was of any real consequence. Yashenko indicates that the Russian\nFederation government is only concerned with cyber security matters that\naffect his own government. (Davis, 2009)\n\n\n-----\n\nNot surprisingly, the Russian Federal Security Service (F.S.B.) is believed\nto employ its own hackers (Varoli, 2000). The manner of recruiting is a\nlittle different than normal ways of looking for employees. When an IT\nspecialist or hacker is caught committing a cyber crime they may receive an\noffer to work for the F.S.B., or face criminal charges. According to a\nRussian computer security specialist hackers that were working for the\nF.S.B. attacked pro-Chechen web sites. According to the same computer\nsecurity specialist the F.S.B. hackers have hacked into opposition\nnewspapers in order to control information about the Russian Federation\ngovernment and its leaders. The recruitment of hackers for offensive cyber\nattacks vice cyber defences is an indication of the future Russian\nFederation government cyber strategy. (Varoli, 2000)\n\nThe Russian Federation government has shown the capability for law\nenforcement in cyber space. Laws exist in Russia that make crimes\ncommitted on the internet punishable under the law. Russia has even\nestablished a computer crime unit, which it called Department “K,” which\noperates under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation\n(MVD). Department “K” is responsible for the detection, prevention,\nsuppression, and solving crimes involving information technology. In\n2008, Department “K” was able to identify 158 computer crimes and shut\ndown seven illegal internet operations. The MVD is currently conducting\nProject “Clean Network” aimed a combating illegal uses of the internet\n(Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, undated). It\nremains to be seen whether the efforts of Department “K” will have any\nnegative impact on the R.B.N. or the cyber gangs that support the Russian\ngovernment.\n\nThe Russian Federation Public Chamber[10] organized a discussion on\nRussian information warfare in September 2008 and _Just Russia[11]_ political\nparty hosted an international conference on information warfare in\nOctober 2008. The conclusions of the meeting were that Russia has grossly\nunderestimated the role of information warfare and failed to ‘champion’\ntheir goals and interests in the world media. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nDr. Igor Panarin, the Dean of the Faculty of International Relations of the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs Diplomatic Academy in Moscow, used the\ninformation warfare discussions to make several recommendations to the\nRussian government concerning information and cyber warfare. Dr.\n\n\n-----\n\nPanarin proposes that Russia develop specialized management and\nanalytical structures to counter information threats. Dr. Panarin proposes a\nsystem that has eight key components. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nThe first component is the creation of a Council for Public Diplomacy that\nwill develop a single point of view for both the Russian government and\nRussian businesses. Government and business leaders are to be included\non the council in order to ensure that all activities concerning foreign\npolitical media are coordinated. The second component is to create an\nadvisor to the President of Russia for Information and Propaganda\nActivities in order to coordinate the foreign political information activities\nof the administration of the President, the government, different\nministries, and the Russian Security Council. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nThe third and fourth components are to create state holding companies,\none for foreign media affairs and one for the internet. The holding\ncompanies would be combined between business and government to see\nthat Russian political positions were broadcast to the world. The\ninformation would not just be focused towards ethnic Russians but would\nbe focused globally towards economic partners, future partners,\nadversaries, and overall world opinion. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nThe fifth component would be the creation of an information crisis action\ncentre in order to ensure that Russia maintains the initiative when\ndelivering the state message to the world. The information crisis action\ncentre would be responsible for developing talking points and themes that\nwould support the government in any crisis. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nThe sixth component would create an information countermeasures\nsystem that would counter enemy information operations. The information\ncountermeasures system would include assets from business and the\ngovernment. The seventh component focuses on a system on\nnongovernmental organizations that would operate throughout the world.\n(Panarin, 2008)\n\nThe final component would consist of a system for training information\nwarfare specialists. This system would use existing educational institutions\nand academies to train specialists that would be able to operate at the\ndiplomatic, management, or individual level. The training system would\n\n\n-----\n\nalso include the creation of an Information Special Forces that are highly\ntrained to for conducting information operations in a crisis. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nAlong with the creation of the information warfare system Dr. Panarin\nbelieves that financing for information warfare needs to be increased by\nboth the Russian government and by Russian businesses. The increased\nattention on information warfare is designed to increase Russia’s image\nthroughout the world and ensure that Russia is prepared for future conflict\nin the cyber and information arenas. (Panarin, 2008)\n\nStatements by Russian government officials have been very similar to Dr.\nPanarin’s position which makes the future of cyber warfare in Russia\noffensively poised. Colonel Aleksandr Drobyshevskiy, head of the Russian\nFederation Ministry of Defence Directorate for Press Service and\nInformation, stated that Georgia won the information war during the\nconflict in South Ossetia and there is a need for the development of\ninformation and telecommunications technologies within the Ministry of\nDefence. Colonel Drobyshevskiy further advocates the creation of an\ninformation warfare system. (Svobodnaya Pressa, 2009)\n\nAnother clue to the future of Russian cyber warfare is the development of\na new information warfare defensive strategy by the Russian Armed Forces\nGeneral Staff. Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Deputy Chief of the\nGeneral Staff, stated that leading world powers will be able to conduct fullscale information warfare and that Russia must be prepared (Usov, 2009).\nGeneral Nogovitsyn believes that Russia will be involved in a large-scale\ninformation war within two to three years that will be fought in the cyber\nworld (Litovkin, 2009).\n\nThe existence of hackers that support the Russian government and\ninformation specialists within the Russian government have created an\nasset that will be used during future cyber conflicts. The Russian\ngovernment’s emphasis on developing cyber strategies will enable Russia to\nbe prepared for future cyber conflict.\n\n**11. Countermeasures**\n\nWe need to examine what can be done to counter cyber crimes and protect\na nation’s IT structure. Cyber countermeasures can be taken at the\ninternational level, followed by cyber defences at the national level, and\n\n\n-----\n\nending with actions that an individual computer user can make to improve\ncyber defence.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the organization\nwithin the UN that is responsible for the international oversight of the\nworld’s telephone system, is developing a system for oversight of the\ninternet. The ITU is working towards a convention against cybercrime that\nwill provide international cooperation on issues concerning internet\ncommunications (Schrank, 2007). Members of the international\ncommunity will need to work together in order to track and prosecute\ncyber criminals that operate outside of the country that is being attacked.\nNations will also have to work together to share technical data to maintain\ncyber defences to keep up with the newest and ever changing cyber\nattacks. Hackers routinely share information on new techniques that can\npenetrate IT defence structures. Nations need to do the same to protect\ntheir own IT infrastructure, the same IT structure that affects the entire\nglobe (Lipson, 2002:47-48).\n\nIndividual countries can improve their cyber defences within their own\nboundaries which would also improve the cyber security of the\ninternational IT system. Countries can make laws making cyber crimes\nillegal with punishments and programs that will deter potential cyber\ncriminals. Governments can create a system that increases co-operation\nbetween the government, businesses, and academic institutions in order to\nimprove their cyber defences. This co-operation could lead to an IT\ninfrastructure that is resilient and able to withstand and recover from a\ncyber attack with little or no permanent damage to a country’s IT structure.\n(Schrank, 2007)\n\nIn 8[th] section the computer user was identified as the weakest link in an IT\nsystem. Some individual countermeasures are easy to accomplish for any\ncomputer user. Actions like keeping antivirus and anti-spyware software up\nto date along with updating your web browser and operating system can\ngreatly enhance your own computer security. Even following safe\ncomputer practices of not opening unknown attachments on emails that\nmay carry viruses or malware are very instrumental in making the cyber\nenvironment more secure (Secure Works Press Release, 2008). The U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) has tips for computer users\nposted on their website to increase internet security. The main points of\nthe DHS website are to promote personal responsibility for increasing\n\n\n-----\n\ncyber security and to promote best practices for safe computer usage. The\nbest practices that DHS advertises are to make cyber security a habit by\nfollowing three core practices. The three core practices are to “install antivirus and anti-spyware programs and keep them up to date, install a\nfirewall and keep it properly configured, and to regularly install updates on\nyour computer’s operating system” (Homeland Security, 2008). Computer\nusers are the first line of defence in cyber security and their actions can\nhelp protect the cyber infrastructure that is used by all.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe international system is lacking in its ability to effectively manage issues\nof cyber security. The Russian Federation is perceived by the international\ncommunity as a country that engages in or supports groups that are\ninvolved in cyber crime. International and regional organizations along\nwith countries that interact with the Russian Federation have to deal with a\nreality that they may be the target of a cyber attack if they are in opposition\nto the government of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe issue of cyber security is ongoing. As more of the former Soviet\nsatellites become more developed with an advanced IT structure they will\nhave to face the realities of cyber attacks. Regardless of whether the\ngovernment of the Russia Federation has been involved in any cyber\nattacks, or will be in the future, the reality remains that nations, groups, or\nindividuals that are in opposition to Russia may face a cyber attack. The\ncyber attacks will be used to influence public opinion or to influence\ngovernment leaders through the use of cyber pressure. Future conflicts\nthat involve the use of force will also see cyber attacks in conjunction with\ncombat operations. Currently international agreements and laws are\ninadequate which allows cyber attackers to take advantage of the lack of\nsuch laws and can conduct acts of civil disobedience on the internet.\n\nThe conflict in Georgia has been a motivator for military reform which\nincludes reform in the cyber arena. The Russian government and the\nRussian military will continue to develop systems to improve both their\noffensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Russia will continue to capitalize\non their diaspora present throughout the world to support their political\npositions but will have to realize that some of that diaspora will be in\nopposition to them and provide private support to organizations and\nnations that have received cyber attacks. Russia’s active collection of cyber\n\n\n-----\n\ndefence secrets will also be a combat multiplier for them in future conflicts\neither alone in the cyber world or as part of a ground conflict.\n\nOrganizations and nations will be best served by creating a resilient\ndefence in depth while educating users and managers of IT systems in best\npractices to counter the threat of a cyber attack. This defence in depth\nincludes technical responses to counter the threats while ensuring that their\nIT systems are resilient and become effective after an attack. President\nBush remarked in 2001 that, “It’s time to work together to address the new\nsecurity threats that we all face. And those threats are not simply missiles\nor weapons of mass destruction in the hands of untrustworthy countries.\nCyber-terrorism is a threat, and we need to work on that together”\n(Verton, 2003:248).\n\n**References:**\n\nAaviksoo, Jaak, 2007 (Nov. 28[th]).
