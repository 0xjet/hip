But\nthis is becoming less and less true, as evidenced by a new strain of malware encountered\nby the Check Point malware research team. This new malware – dubbed OSX/Dok —\naffects all versions of OSX, has 0 detections on VirusTotal (as of the writing of these words),\nis signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple), and is the first major\nscale malware to target OSX users via a coordinated email phishing campaign.\n\nOnce OSX/Dok infection is complete, the attackers gain complete access to all victim\ncommunication, including communication encrypted by SSL. This is done by redirecting\nvictim traffic through a malicious proxy server.\n\nThe malware mostly targets European users. For instance, one phishing message was\nobserved to target a user in Germany by baiting the user with a message regarding\nsupposed inconsistencies in their tax returns (see image, and translation, below).\n\n\n-----\n\n____\n\n**Update – May-4-2017**\n\nOur ongoing investigation of the OSX/DOK campaign have led us to detect several new\nvariants of this malware.\n\nFollowing Apple’s revocation of the previous developer ID, it seems the attackers have\nquickly adapted and are now using a new Apple developer ID.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese new variants also contain an extra obfuscated layer using UPX in an attempt to avoid\nsecurity products detection.\n\nApple has been notified about these new developments, and the new developer ID has now\nbeen revoked.\n\nCheck Point customers remain protected against these threats with the following detections:\n\nTrojan.OSX.DOK\nTrojan.OSX.DOK-Domain\nMac OSX/Dok Unauthorized Remote Access\n\nIOCs:\n\n3f0130cfd7bf61b8e8226dd4775319c7376a08ec019f9df12875e9ea55992e94\ncd93142f1e0bac1d73235515bc127f5f9634eafde0bea2d6c294bf3549d612b7\n4252e482c9801463e6f684c71f70cb64a17ae74957ed8986f2401c653acae1d7\n\n____\n\n**Technical details:**\n\nThe malware bundle is contained in a .zip archive named Dokument.zip. It was signed on\nApril 21th 2017 by a “Seven Muller” and the bundle name is Truesteer.AppStore.\n\nUpon execution, the malware will copy itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder, and will then\nproceed to execute itself from the new location by running the shell commands below:\n\nThen, the malware will pop-up a fabricated message claiming that “the package is\ndamaged” and therefore cannot execute:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a loginItem named “AppStore” exists, the malware will delete it, and instead add itself as a\nloginItem, which will persist in the system and execute automatically every time the system\nreboots, until it finishes to install its payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious application will then create a window on top of all other windows. This new\nwindow contains a message, claiming a security issue has been identified in the operating\nsystem that an update is available, and that to proceed with the update, the user has to\nenter a password as shown in the picture below. The malware checks the system\nlocalization, and supports messages in both German and English.\n\nThe victim is barred from accessing any windows or using their machine in any way until\nthey relent, enter the password and allow the malware to finish installing. Once they do, the\nmalware gains administrator privileges on the victim’s machine.\n\nUsing those privileges, the malware will then install brew, a package manager for OS X,\nwhich will be used to install additional tools – TOR and SOCAT\n\n**Tor, the latter is a low-level command-line utility that allows connection to the dark web.**\n\nThe malware will then give the current user admin privileges immediately on demand\nwithout prompting for a password. This is done so that the malware won’t provoke constant\nadmin password prompts when abusing its admin privileges with the sudo command. This\nis done by adding the following line to /etc/sudoers:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then changes the victim system s network settings such that all outgoing\nconnections will pass through a proxy, which is dynamically obtained from a Proxy\nAutoConfiguration (PAC) file sitting in a malicious server. The script that makes this\nconfiguration changes can be seen below:\n\nThen resulting change can be seen in the Network Settings:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware will then proceed to install a new root certificate in the victim system, which\nallows the attacker to intercept the victim’s traffic using a Man in The Middle (MiTM) attack.\nBy abusing the victim’s new-found trust in this bogus certificate, the attacker can\nimpersonate any website, and the victim will be none the wiser. The new certificate is\ninstalled using the following command:\n\nThe newly-installed certificate can be seen in the two images below.\n\nThe malware will also install 2 `LaunchAgents that will start with system boot, and have`\nthe following names:\n\n\n-----\n\nThese `LaunchAgents will redirect requests to 127.0.0.1 through the dark web address`\n“paoyu7gub72lykuk.onion“. This is necessary for the previous PAC configuration to work\n(note that the original configuration looks for the PAC file on the local host 127.0.0.1).\n\nThese `LaunchAgents consist of the following BASH commands:`\n\nAs a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user’s web\nbrowser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings. The user traffic is\nthen redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-theMiddle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf. The attacker is\nfree to read the victim’s traffic and tamper with it in any way they please.\n\nWhen done, the malware will delete itself.\n\nAll is left to say: beware of Trojans bearing gifts, especially if they ask for your root\npassword.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOCs**\n\nSample hash –\n7819ae7d72fa045baa77e9c8e063a69df439146b27f9c3bb10aef52dcc77c145\n\n4131d4737fe8dfe66d407bfd0a0df18a4a77b89347471cc012da8efc93c661a5\n```\nLaunchAgent :\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Check Point Protections**\n\nTrojan.OSX.DOK\n\nDOK\n\n\n-----",
