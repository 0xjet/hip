It features a straightforward set of commands that allows for near complete control of a machine.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe use of this software on any device that is not your own is highly discouraged. You need\nto obtain explicit permission from the owner if you intend to use Lilith in an alien environment,\nany illicit installation will likely be prosecuted by the jurisdiction the (ab)use occurs in.\n\n## Youtube\n\n Features\n\n\n[licenselicense MITMIT](https://github.com/werkamsus/Lilith/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n\n-----\n\nRemote Command Execution via\n\nCMD\nPowershell\n**Any other console app**\nKeylogger (new) [16.09.2017]\nExecute predefined Scripts (new) [16.09.2017]\nExtreme Modularity (see this)\nBroadcast Commands to all Clients (new) [15.09.2017]\nMultiple Connections\nAuto-Install\nStartup Persistence\nSelf-Erases\nDNS Resolving\nLow Latency & Bandwith use\nError-Handler with logs\n\n## Modularity\n\nThe modularity and expandability of this RAT are what it's been built on. That's how it\nmanages to stay very compact, light-weight and fast. You can download other utilities like\npassword recovery or keylogging tools via Powershell scripts (link to some useful scripts will\nfollow soon) and then execute them as if they were running on your own machine.\nAfterwards you're able to upload the results (also with a ps script) or evaluate them on the\nspot (via the `type command) in cmd.`\n\n## Commands\n\n**Command** **Syntax** **Comment**\n\nconnect `connect <clientID> ( connect 0 )` Connects to a Client\n\nexitSession `exitSession` Exits current session\n\n\nswitchSession `switchSession <clientID>`\n( switchSession 2 )\n\n\nSwitches to another\nClient\n\n\nbroadcast `broadcast` Broadcasts your\ncommands to all clients\n\nkeydump `keydump` Dumps Keylog File\n\nscript `script <scriptname>` Executes a predefined\n`<scriptparameter> ( script keydump` Script\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Syntax** **Comment**\n\nlistClients `listClients` Displays the number of\nclients connected\n\n\nremoteControl `remoteControl <C:\\program.exe> OR`\n```\n         remoteControl cmd\n\n```\n\nMore Info\n\n\nremoteControl `remoteControl` Exits remoteControl if\nalready in remoteControl\n\nrestart `restart` Restarts the Client\n\nkill `kill` Quits the Client\n\n## General Description\n\nAt the core of this RAT lies it's unique ability to remotely execute commands via CMD,\nPowershell and almost all console-based applications. It has the capabilities to automatically\ninstall on startup and clean up behind itself. It also features an error-handler that logs any\nissues. As of now, it is not 100% stable. Under 'normal' conditions it runs smoothly and\nwithout any disturbances, but severe irregularities in input (i.e. messing around with it a lot)\nmay cause crashes. This will be resolved in the near future.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Requirements\n\nNone!\nSupported Operating Systems (32/64-bit)\n\nWindows XP SP3\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Vista\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows 7\nWindows Server 2012\nWindows 8/8.1\nWindows 10\n\n## To-Do\n\n More Info on Commands\n\n remoteControl\n\nShortcuts are: `cmd,` `pws,` `pws32 which stand for Command Prompt, Powershell and`\nPowershell 32-Bit respectively. You can use these instead of a full path to the executable.\nExample: `remoteControl pws will remote-control`\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe .\n\n```\n\n-----",
