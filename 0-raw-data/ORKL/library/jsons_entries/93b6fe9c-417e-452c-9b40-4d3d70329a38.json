Our main specialization is\nransomware attacks,\" - SunCrypt ransomware operators.\n\nAfter further questions, they eventually told us that they \"share revenue from the successful\noperation,\" but did not provide any details about what Maze provided to earn that revenue\nshare.\n\nBased on their statement that they were brought in because Maze can't handle all of the\npotential attacks, Maze may provide compromised network access to cartel members in\nexchange for a revenue share.\n\nFrom a ransomware sample seen by BleepingComputer, it looks like cartel members get\nmore for their money.\n\n## Maze shares its resources with cartel members\n\n[Yesterday, GrujaRS was finally able to find a sample of the SunCrypt ransomware so we](https://twitter.com/GrujaRS/status/1298307647830216709?s=20)\ncan get a better glimpse into how the ransomware works.\n\nThe SunCrypt Ransomware sample is installed via a heavily obfuscated PowerShell script,\nshown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Obfuscated PowerShell script**\nWhen the ransomware is executed, it will connect to the URL http://91.218.114[.]31 and\ntransmit information about the attack and its victim.\n\nThe use of this IP address provides another big clue as to what services the Maze threat\nactors provide their cartel members.\n\nFor months, Maze has been hosting a data leak site and launching attacks from known\npublic IP addresses. Yet in all this time, their services remain intact and have not been\ntaken down by law enforcement.\n\nThe 91.218.114.31 address is one of the addresses that the Maze operation uses as part of\nits campaign. Even more similar, Maze infections also transmit information to this IP\naddress during an attack.\n\nThis shared IP address means one of the two things; Maze is sharing their infrastructure or\nwhite-labeling their ransomware technology to other groups.\n\nThis sharing of resources would also explain why they would earn a revenue share for each\nransom payment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Update 8/31/2020: The Maze threat actors have told BleepingComputer that they are not_\naffiliated with the SunCrypt ransomware operators.\n\n\"We do not have any connections with SunCrypt, it is a lie.\"\n\n\"We do not know why SunCrypt does it, but we believe it is a PR strategy, to send links to\ncompanies in chat that they are working with us as a pressure,\" Maze told\nBleepingComputer.\n\nAdvanced Intel's Vitali Kremez has told BleepingComputer that in addition to connecting to\nhttp://91.218.114[.]31, the SunCrypt ransomware will also connect to http://91.218.114[.]30.\n\nBoth of these IP addresses are on the same address space.\n\nAs previously stated, 91.218.114[.]31 has been used by Maze in the past.\n\nSunCrypt is no longer responding to our queries with follow up questions.\n\n## The SunCrypt Ransomware\n\nThe SunCrypt ransomware itself is still being analyzed, but we can provide a basic overview\nof the ransomware.\n\nThe ransomware is currently being distributed as a DLL that, when executed, will encrypt a\ncomputer's files.\n\nWhen encrypting files, it will append a hexadecimal hash to the end of each file name. It is\nnot known what this hash represents.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SunCrypt encrypted files**\nIn every folder a ransom note named YOUR_FILES_ARE_ENCRYPTED.HTML is created\nthat contains information on what happened to a victim's files and a link to the Tor payment\nsite.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SunCrypt ransom note**\nThe Tor link enclosed in a ransom note is hardcoded into the ransomware executable. This\nmeans that every victim encrypted by a particular SunCrypt executable will have the same\nTor payment site link.\n\nThe Tor payment site does not have automated features and simply contains a chat screen\nwhere a victim can negotiate a ransom with the SunCrypt threat actors.\n\nFurthermore, every ransom note contains a link to the SunCrypt data leak site that the\nthreat actors warn will be used to publish the victim's data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SunCrypt data leak site**\nAt this time, there are approximately five victims listed on the SunCrypt data leak site.\n\n[Other ransomware operations that run data leak sites or have stolen unencrypted files to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\nextort their victims include Ako, Avaddon, Clop, Conti, CryLock, DoppelPaymer, Maze,\nMountLocker, Nemty, Nephilim, Netwalker, Pysa/Mespinoza, Ragnar Locker, REvil,\nSekhmet, Snatch, and Snake.\n\nSunCrypt is currently being analyzed for weaknesses, and it is not known if it is possible to\nrecover files for free.\n\n**Update 8/31/20: The Maze operators deny having any affiliation with SunCrypt.**\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[SunCrypt ransomware is still alive and kicking in 2022](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suncrypt-ransomware-is-still-alive-and-kicking-in-2022/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cartel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cartel/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Data Leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-leak/)\n[Maze](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/maze/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[SunCrypt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/suncrypt/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
