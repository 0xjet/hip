This](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\nmulti-wave attacks focused on obtaining data of specific, high-value targets and resulted in a\ncomplete takeover of the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key Points\n\nEarlier this year, Cybereason identified an advanced, persistent attack targeting\ntelecommunications providers that has been underway for years, soon after deploying\ninto the environment.\nCybereason spotted the attack and later supported the telecommunications provider\nthrough four more waves of the advanced persistent attack over the course of 6\nmonths.\nBased on the data available to us, Operation Soft Cell has been active since at least\n2012, though some evidence suggests even earlier activity by the threat actor against\ntelecommunications providers.\nThe attack was aiming to obtain CDR records of a large telecommunications provider.\nThe threat actor was attempting to steal all data stored in the active directory,\ncompromising every single username and password in the organization, along with\nother personally identifiable information, billing data, call detail records, credentials,\nemail servers, geo-location of users, and more.\nThe tools and TTPs used are commonly associated with Chinese threat actors\nDuring the persistent attack the attackers worked in waves- abandoning one thread\n\n\n-----\n\nof attack when it was detected and stopped, only to return months later with new\ntools and techniques.\n\n## Security Recommendations\n\nAdd an additional security layer for web servers. For example, use WAF (Web\nApplication FW) to prevent trivial attacks on Internet-facing web servers.\nExpose as few systems or ports to the Internet as possible. Make sure that all web\nservers and web services that are exposed are patched.\nUse an EDR tool to give visibility and immediate response capabilities when high\nseverity incidents are detected.\nProactively hunt in your environment for sensitive assets periodically.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n_Watch our CEO Lior Div's keynote on the operation._\n\n[In 2018, 30% of the telecommunications providers reported sensitive customer information](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/report-telecommunications-industry-woefully-unprepared-for-cyber-attacks)\nwas stolen due to an attack. These telecommunications providers have been expanding in\nsize, to the point where In the past thirteen years, mobile cellular phone subscribers have\n[quadrupled in size and sit at 8 billion subscribers today . Due to their wide availability and](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx)\nthe fundamental service they bring, telecommunications providers have become critical\ninfrastructure for the majority of world powers.\n\nMuch like telecommunication providers, many other critical infrastructure organizations\n[provide a valuable targets for nation state threat actors, due to their high impact. In studies,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samcurry/2019/04/16/cyber-sights-on-critical-infrastructure/#3649ad487729)\n[nearly a quarter of critical infrastructure organizations reported they had been hit by nation](https://static.tenable.com/marketing/research-reports/PonemonReport-Cybersecurity_in_Operational_Technology.pdf)\nstate attacks and 60% said disruptive cyber attacks are among the threats they are most\nworried about.\n\nThreat actors, especially those at the level of nation state, are seeking opportunities to\n[attack these organizations, conducting elaborate, advanced operations to gain leverage,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-kpn/dutch-emergency-services-hit-by-major-telecoms-outage-idUSKCN1TP1V8)\n[seize strategic assets, and collect information](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-navy-is-struggling-to-fend-off-chinese-hackers-officials-say-11544783401) . When successful, these attacks often have\nhuge implications.\n\nLast year, we identified a threat actor that has been operating in telecommunications\n[provider environments for at least two years. We performed a post-incident review of the](https://www.cybereason.com/resources/post-incident-review)\nattacks and were able to identify changes in the attack patterns along with new activity\nevery quarter.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor mainly sought to obtain CDR data (call logs, cell tower locations, etc.)\nbelonging to specific individuals from various countries. This type of targeted cyber\nespionage is usually the work of nation state threat actors.\n\nWe’ve concluded with a high level of certainty that the threat actor is affiliated with China\nand is likely state sponsored. The tools and techniques used throughout these attacks are\n[consistent with several Chinese threat actors, such as APT10, a threat actor believed to](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\noperate on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).\n\n_The threat actor changed activity every quarter._\n\nThe attack began with a web shell running on a vulnerable, publicly-facing server, from\nwhich the attackers gathered information about the network and propagated across the\nnetwork. The threat actor attempted to compromise critical assets, such as database\nservers, billing servers, and the active directory. As malicious activity was detected and\nremediated against, the threat actor stopped the attack.\n\nThe second wave of the attack hit several months later with similar infiltration attempts,\nalong with a modified version of the web shell and reconnaissance activities. A game of cat\nand mouse between the threat actor and the defenders began, as they ceased and\nresumed their attack 2 more times in the span of a 4 month period.\n\n## Anatomy of the Attack\n\n\n-----\n\n### Initial Compromise: the Modified China Chopper Web Shell\n\nThe initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an IIS\nserver, coming out of the w3wp.exe process. An investigation of the web shell, later classified\n[as a modified version of the China Chopper web shell, uncovered several attack phases and](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\nTTPs. The threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands,\nsteal credentials, and deploy other tools.\n\n_Malicious web shell activity as observed in the Cybereason solution._\n\n_Commands executed via a modified version of the China Chopper web shell._\n\nChina Chopper is a web shell first discovered in 2012 that is commonly used by malicious\nChinese actors. It is used to remotely control web servers, and has been used in many\n[attacks against Australian web hosting providers. The web shell parameters in this attack](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australian-web-hosts-hit-with-a-manic-menagerie-of-malware/)\nmatch to the China Chopper parameters, as described in FireEye’s analysis of China\nChopper. This tool has been used by several Chinese-affiliated threat actors, such as APT 27\nand APT 40. It is important to note that this tool is widely available and can be used by other\nthreat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Reconnaissance and Credential Stealing\n\nThe threat actor launched a series of reconnaissance commands to try to obtain and\nenumerate information about the compromised machine, network architecture, users, and\nactive directory enumeration.\n\n_Example 1: Reconnaissance Commands_\n\n_Example 2: Reconnaissance Commands_\n\n#### Modified “nbtscan”\n\n[One of the reconnaissance commands was to run a modified nbtscan tool (\"NetBIOS](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\n[nameserver scanner\") to identify available NetBIOS name servers locally or over the](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\n[network. Nbtscan has been used by APT10 in Operation Cloud Hopper to search for](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-annex-b-final.pdf)\nservices of interest across the IT estate and footprint endpoints of interest. It is also capable\nof identifying system information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_NetBIOS Scanner execution as seen in the Cybereason solution._\n\n_NetBIOS scanner is set to scan an internal IP range._\n\n#### Modified Mimikatz\n\nFollowing the reconnaissance phase, the threat actor attempted to dump credentials stored\non the compromised machines. The most common credential stealing tool used by the\n[threat actor was a modified mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes. This version of mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\ndid not require any command line arguments, most likely in an attempt to avoid detection\nbased on command-line auditing. The dumped hashes were used to authenticate to other\nmachines via pass the hash. We renamed this sample to maybemimi.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Modified Mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes._\n\nReverse engineering shows the similarity between maybemimi.exe and mimikatz.\n\n_[Mimikatz code from GitHub.](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)_\n\n_maybemimi strings._\n\n#### Dumping the SAM Hive from the Registry\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to obtain credentials, the threat actor used another technique that can be seen in\n[the below screenshots. They dumped specific hives from the Windows Registry, such as the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/sysinfo/registry-hives)\nSAM hive, which contains password hashes.\n\n_Reg.exe is being spawned from a shell_\n_process._\n\n_Command-line arguments indicate SAM hive dumping._\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nOnce the threat actor mapped the network and obtained credentials (through net use), they\nbegan to move laterally. They were able to compromise critical assets including production\nservers and database servers, and they even managed to gain full control of the Domain\n[Controller. The threat actor relied on WMI and PsExec to move laterally and install their](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\ntools across multiple assets.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how the threat actor moved laterally from the first\n[machine, compromised by the modified version of the China Chopper web shell, to other](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\nmachines inside the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n_/c cd /d \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\ecp\\auth\\\"&wmic_\n_/node:[REDACTED] /user:\"[REDACTED]\" /password:\"[REDACTED]\" process call create a.bat&echo_\n\n_[S]&cd&echo [E]_\n\n_WMI command used by the threat actor to move laterally._\n\n### Maintaining a Long-term Foothold and Stealing Data\n\nThe threat actor abused the stolen credentials to create rogue, high-privileged domain user\naccounts which they then used to take malicious action. By creating these accounts, they\nensured they would maintain access between different waves of the attack. Once the threat\nactor regains their foothold, they already have access to a high-privileged domain user\naccount. This significantly reduces the “noise” of having to use credential dumpers\nrepeatedly, which helped them evade detection.\n\n#### PoisonIvy\n\nA second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets\n[was through the deployment of the PoisonIvy RAT (PIVY). This infamous RAT has been](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0012/)\n[associated with many different Chinese threat actors, including APT10, APT1, and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0006/)\n[DragonOK. It is a powerful, multi-featured RAT that lets a threat actor take total control over](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0017/)\na machine. Among its most notable features are:\n\nRegistry Editor\nScreenshot Grabber\nCredential Stealer\nInteractive Shell\nFile Manager with Upload and Download Support\nProcess Monitor\nKeylogging and Various other Surveillance Features\n\n\n-----\n\n_The control panel for PoisonIvy._\n\n_[Courtesy of Sam Bowne - samsclass.info](https://samsclass.info/)_\n\nWe assume the threat actor used PoisonIvy for keylogging and other surveillance features,\nas they had that functionality available to them as shown in the screenshot above.\n\n[The strain of PIVY in this attack used a DLL side-loading technique to stealthily load itself into](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073/)\nmemory. To accomplish this, it exploited a trusted and signed application. The PIVY payload\nwas dropped along with the trusted and signed Samsung tool (RunHelp.exe) in the following\nmanner:\n\n[1. A nullsoft installer package (NSIS) was created with a legitimate, signed Samsung tool](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page)\n\nin it.\n2. Once executed, the installer script within the NSIS package extracted the Samsung\n\ntool and added a fake DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll),\nwhich is required by the application.\n3. The DLL contains a PIVY stager, which is then loaded by the Samsung tool.\n4. After the fake DLL was loaded by the Samsung tool, it decrypted a blob payload in the\n\nsame folder, which contains the actual PIVY payload.\n5. It was able to achieve persistence by creating a rogue scheduled task.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Post-persistence execution of PIVY, side-loaded into a legitimate Samsung application._\n\nPIVY’s use of DLL side-loading to abuse Samsung tools is not new, and has been reported\n[previously by Palo Alto. In 2016 it was used to attack pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)\nmost probably by Chinese threat actors.\n\n⚠️ **Note: Our team has reached out to and advised the targeted organizations on**\n**active containment actions.**\n\n#### Secondary Web Shells\n\nIn later stages of the attack, the threat actor deployed two other custom-built web shells.\nFrom these web shells, they launched reconnaissance commands, stole data, and dropped\n[additional tools including portqry.exe, renamed cmd.exe, winrar, and the notorious hTran.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/310099/description-of-the-portqry-exe-command-line-utility)\n\n_Reconnaissance and lateral movement commands launched from the secondary web shell._\n\n### Data Exfiltration\n\nThe threat actor exfiltrated stolen data using multiple different channels including web\nshells and hTran.\n\n#### Compressing the Stolen Data\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data, the threat actor used [winrar to](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)\ncompress and password-protect it. The winrar binaries and compressed data were found\n[mostly in the Recycle Bin folder, a TTP that was previously observed in APT10-related](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/)\nattacks, as well as others. This threat actor is known to stage the data in multi-part archives\nbefore exfiltration.\n\nThe threat actor used the following commands to compress the data.\n\nrar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -[password] [REDACTED].rar [REDACTED].temp\nrar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -[password] [REDACTED].rar [REDACTED].csv\nrar a -r -[password] [REDACTED].rar sam system ntds.dit\n\n_Compressed stolen data exfiltrated via web shell._\n\nThe contents of the compressed data was crucial in understanding the threat actor’s\nmotivation for the attack, as well as what type of information they were after.\n\n#### hTran\n\nIn order to exfiltrate data from a network segment not connected to the Internet, the threat\n[actor deployed a modified version of hTran. This ‘connection bouncer’ tool lets the threat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040/)\n[actor redirect ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate C2 server](https://github.com/HiwinCN/HTran)\ntraffic. There have been numerous reports of hTran being used by different Chinese threat\n[actors, including: APT3, APT27 and DragonOK.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022/)\n\nThe threat actor made some modifications to [the original source code of hTran. Many](https://github.com/HiwinCN/HTran)\nstrings, including the debug messages, were intentionally changed and obfuscated in an\nattempt to evade detection and thwart efforts to identify the malware by antivirus and\nresearchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obfuscated debug messages._\n\nSince the original source code for hTran is publicly available, we were able to compare the\ndebug output to the original source code to show that it has indeed been modified.\n\n_Identifying modifications in a disassembly of the modified hTran._\n\n\n-----\n\nprintf is being called (dubbed by us as “looks_like_printf”) with output “C e.”. By looking at\nthe original source code, we were able to identify that this is supposed to be “Connect\nerror”.\n\n_A section of the source code for hTran._\n\n## Understanding the Motive\n\nWhen you think of large breaches to big organizations, the first thing that comes to mind is\nusually payment data. An organization that provides services to a large customer base has a\nlot of credit card data, bank account information, and more personal data on its systems.\nThese attacks are usually conducted by a cybercrime group looking to make money.\n\nIn contrast, when a nation state threat actor is attacking a big organization, the end goal is\ntypically not financial, but rather intellectual property or sensitive information about their\nclients.\n\nOne of the most valuable pieces of data that telecommunications providers hold is Call\nDetail Records (CDRs). CDRs are a large subset of metadata that contains all details about\ncalls, including:\n\nSource, Destination, and Duration of a Call\nDevice Details\nPhysical Location\nDevice Vendor and Version\n\nFor a nation state threat actor, obtaining access to this data gives them intimate knowledge\nof any individuals they wish to target on that network. It lets them answer questions like:\n\nWho are the individuals talking to?\nWhich devices are the individuals using?\nWhere are the individuals traveling?\n\nHaving this information becomes particularly valuable when nation-state threat actors are\ntargeting foreign intelligence agents, politicians, opposition candidates in an election, or\neven law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example 1: CDR Data_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example 2: CDR Data_\n\nExample 3: CDR Data\n\nBeyond targeting individual users, this attack is also alarming because of the threat posed\nby the control of a telecommunications provider. Telecommunications has become critical\ninfrastructure for the majority of world powers. A threat actor with total access to a\ntelecommunications provider, as is the case here, can attack however they want passively\nand also actively work to sabotage the network.\n\nThis attack has widespread implications, not just for individuals, but also for organizations\nand countries alike. The use of specific tools and the choice to hide ongoing operations for\nyears points to a nation state threat actor, most likely China. This is another form of cyber\nwarfare being used to establish a foothold and gather information undercover until they are\nready to strike.\n\nWant to learn about post-incident review?\n\n## Threat Intel Research\n\nThe following sections detail the methodology and work process used to piece together the\nvarious stages and components of the attack. This work enabled us to not only reconstruct\nthese attacks, but also to find additional artifacts and information regarding the threat actor\nand its operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Methodology\n\n#### Step 1: Creating and Maintaining an IOC Inventory\n\nThe first step in this process was to create a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) observed throughout the different stages of the attack. This list included various\nindicators, such as file hashes, domains, IP addresses, file names, and registry/service\nnames. In addition to this, our reverse engineers were able to extract further IOCs from the\ncollected samples, which have also been added to the list.\n\nThe list of IOCs was periodically updated and fed back into our threat intel engine as more\nwere discovered.\n\n#### Step 2: Hunting for Known Evil\n\nEquipped with an ever-growing list of known IOCs, our team set out to hunt for “low-hanging\nfruit” across multiple environments. This step was done by using both internal sources, such\nas the Cybereason solution, as well as hunting for indicators in the wild.\n\nThe hunt for “known evil” yielded interesting results that helped uncover additional\ncompromised assets as well as more parts of the attack infrastructure.\n\n#### Step 3: Threat Actor’s Arsenal\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting steps involved identifying and analyzing the tools the\nthreat actor used throughout the attack. The combination of the preference of tools,\nsequence of use, and specifically how they are used during the attack says a lot about a\nthreat actor, especially when it comes to attribution.\n\nOne of the more notable aspects was how the threat actor used mostly known tools that\nwere customized for this specific attack. Each tool was customized differently, and included\nre-writing the code, stripping debug symbols, string obfuscation, and embedding the\nvictim’s specific information within the tools’ configuration.\n\nHowever, the threat actor also used tools we were not able to attribute to any known tool.\nThese tools were used in the later stages of the attack, once the operation was already\ndiscovered. This was most likely to decrease the risk of exposure or attribution.\n\nFinally, the payloads were almost never repeated. The threat actor made sure that each\npayload had a unique hash, and some payloads were packed using different types of\npackers, both known and custom.\n\nThe main tools these attacks had in common are:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. **Web Shells**\n\n[A modified version of the China Chopper web shell was used for initial](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\ncompromise.\nCustom-built web shells were used for later phases of the attack.\n2. **Reconnaissance Tools**\n\n[A modified version of Nbtscan was used to identify available NetBIOS name](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\nservers locally or over the network.\nMultiple Windows built-in tools were used for various tasks, including whoami,\n[net.exe, ipconfig, netstat, portqry, and more.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039/)\n[WMI and PowerShell commands were used for various tasks.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n3. **RAT**\n\n[PoisonIvy was used to maintain access across the compromised assets.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0012/)\n[PlugX was used in some of the instances that we're aware of.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\n4. **Credential Dumpers**\n\n[A modified version of Mimikatz was used to dump credentials stored on the](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\ncompromised machines.\nA PowerShell-based Mimikatz was also used to dump credentials stored on the\ncompromised machines.\n5. **Lateral movement**\n\n[WMI was used for lateral movement.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n[PsExec was also used for lateral movement.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029/)\n6. **Connection Proxy**\n\n[A modified version of hTran was used to exfiltrate stolen data.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040/)\n7. **Compression tool**\n\n[Winrar was used to compress and password-protect stolen data.](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)\n\n#### Step 4: Creating a TTP-based Behavioral Profile\n\n[One of the key components of threat hunting is to create a TTP-based behavioral profile of](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/how-to-generate-a-hypothesis-for-a-threat-hunt-techniques)\nthe threat actor in question. Malware payloads and operational infrastructure can be quickly\nchanged or replaced over time, and as such, the task of tracking a threat actor can become\nquite difficult.\n\nFor that reason, it is crucial to profile the threat actor and study its behavior, the tools it\nuses, and its techniques. These behavioral-based TTPs are less likely to change drastically,\nand are\\ key factors of any threat hunt or attribution efforts.\n\n[The Cybereason solution is compatible with the MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/mitre-attck-evaluation-results), which made it\neasy to keep track of the observed TTPs and correlate the data with known threat actors.\n\nThe following chart reflects the behavioral profile of the threat actor based on the most\nfrequently observed techniques used throughout these attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Breakdown_\n\n**Initial Access** **Execution** **Persistence** **Privilege** **Defense** **Credential**\n**Escalation** **Evasion** **Access**\n\nExploit Public- Command-line [Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1100/) Valid DLL-side Credential\nFacing interface Accounts Loading Dumping\nApplication\n\nWindows Create [Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1100/) Indicator\n[Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/) Account [Removal from](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1066/)\nInstrumentation Tools\n\n[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/) Obfuscated\n[Files or](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)\nInformation\n\n[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/)\n\n**Discovery** **Lateral** **Collection** **Command** **Exfiltration** **Impact**\n**Movement** **and**\n\n**Control**\n\nSystem Network Data From Remote Data\n[Configuration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/) Local File Copy Compressed\nDiscovery System\n\nRemote System Pass the Data Connection Exfiltration Over\nDiscovery Hash Staged Proxy [Command and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\nControl Channel\n\n[Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/) [Remote File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/) [Input](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/)\nCopy Capture\n\n[Permission Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/)\nDiscovery\n\n#### Step 5: Mapping out the Infrastructure and Operational Activity\n\n_Reconstructing the Infrastructure_\n\nIn order to make sense of all the data, we fed it into multiple threat intelligence sources,\nincluding our own and third parties.\n\n⚠️ **Note: Since we cannot share any IOCs, we will refer to file hashes, hostnames, IP**\n**addresses and other IOCs as generic placeholders.**\n\n|Initial Access|Execution|Persistence|Privilege Escalation|Defense Evasion|Credential Access|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Exploit Public- Facing Application|Command-line interface|Web Shell|Valid Accounts|DLL-side Loading|Credential Dumping|\n||Windows Management Instrumentation|Create Account|Web Shell|Indicator Removal from Tools||\n||PowerShell|||Obfuscated Files or Information||\n|||||Masquerading||\n\n|Discovery|Lateral Movement|Collection|Command and Control|Exfiltration|Impact|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|System Network Configuration Discovery|Data From Local System|Remote File Copy|Data Compressed|||\n|Remote System Discovery|Pass the Hash|Data Staged|Connection Proxy|Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel||\n|Account Discovery|Remote File Copy|Input Capture||||\n|Permission Groups Discovery||||||\n\n\n-----\n\nHostname1 is the hostname that was used for the C2 server targeting the\ntelecommunications providers.\n\n_Hostname1 connected to multiple tools._\n\nIn analyzing the files, it is clear they are all contacting the same host _hostname1. hostname1_\nwas the C2 server that the malware and web shells connected to.\n\nOnce we determined the hashes in the scope of the attack were only connecting to\n_hostname1, which is a dynamic DNS hostname, we looked to see if we could find more_\ninformation about the C2 server.\n\nA simple WHOIS query revealed that the IP address was registered to a colocation hosting\n**company in Asia, though there was no other publicly available information about this IP**\naddress.\n\nBy querying all of our threat intel resources about this IP address, we discovered that it was\nassociated with multiple dynamic DNS hostnames.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Multiple dynamic DNS hostnames._\n\nWe were unable to find indications of connections to Dynamic.DNS2 and Dynamic.DNS3.\nHowever, they were registered and associated with IP.Address1.\n\nFor the other dynamic DNS hosts, we leveraged various threat intel repositories and crafted\nqueries that searched for executables with these IP addresses and hostnames in their string\ntable. One of the queries returned a few DLLs with identical names to the DLL we had\ninitially investigated. However, the hashes were different. After obtaining the found DLLs, we\npatched them back into the NSIS installer and detonated the samples in our testing\nenvironment. Dynamic analysis of the newly obtained DLLs revealed a new set of domains\nand IP addresses that were completely different. These domains were actually related to\ndifferent telecommunications providers.\n\n⚠️ **Note: Cybereason immediately reached out to those telecommunications providers**\n**and provided them all of the necessary information to handle the incident internally.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Strings from the dumped memory section of the injected shellcode. We can see many details_\n_about the attack including domains and C2 server IP addresses._\n\n_Shellcode being unpacked and injected into a remote process. The redacted segments contain the_\n_name of the customer, C2 IP addresses, and domains._\n\n_Infrastructure Operational Security_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_The threat actor’s infrastructure._\n\nThe threat actor had a specific pattern of behavior that allowed us to understand their\nmodus operandi: they used one server with the same IP address for multiple operations.\nThis server is a key component in their ‘non-attributable’ infrastructure.\n\nThe threat actor separated operations by using different hostnames per operation, though\nthey are hosted on the same server and IP address. The domains and server registration\ninformation pointed to three main countries: China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\n\nThis is cheap and efficient for the threat actor, but is almost transparent for a seasoned\nresearcher with access to the right threat intelligence tools. There are previous reports of\nthreat actors including APT10 and APT1 using dynamic DNS.\n\nMonitoring this infrastructure gave us information about if and when the threat actor was\nstarting new waves of the attack or additional attacks on other providers.\n\nWhen researching C2 servers, it is important to watch for:\n\nAssociation with domains, especially if they are dynamic DNS domains.\nFile hashes that are associated with the IP address or the domain of the C2 server.\n\nStatic information and metadata from associated samples that could be used to\nbroaden the search after additional information is gathered.\n\nThis demonstrates the importance of proper operational security and a separation between\ntools and operations for threat actors.\n\n### Step 6: Rounding Up Immediate/Potential Suspects\n\n[Attribution is a fickle and delicate art. In most cases, it is very difficult to achieve 100%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samcurry/2019/04/23/attribution-know-thy-place-blurred-cyber-lines/)\ncertainty when attributing an attack to a specific threat actor. It can be tempting to attribute\nan attack to a certain threat actor whenever certain tools-of-the-trade, IP addresses, strings,\nor “indicative” techniques are observed.\n\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind that the aforementioned data points are often\nprone to manipulation and reuse across different threat actors. Further, they are not\nimpervious to psychological warfare, as in, trying to “pin” an operation on a different threat\nactor to avoid proper attribution.\n\nIn order to increase the certainty level when attributing to a specific threat actor, we took\nthe following aspects of the attacks into consideration:\n\nIndicators of Compromise\nTTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures)\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actor's tools\nMotive behind the attacks\nRegional and industry considerations\n\nCarefully examining each of the different aspects plays an important role in avoiding\nmisattribution. This model offers a more balanced interpretation of the data that is based\non a myriad of components. By performing a contextualized review of the data, you are able\nto yield a more wholesome result with greater certainty.\n\nWhen it comes to attributing Operation Soft Cell, we are unable to achieve 100% certainty\nwith regard to the identity of the threat actor. However, based on our interpretation of the\ndata, we conclude with a high level of certainty that:\n\nThe threat actor behind Operation Soft Cell is likely state-sponsored.\nThe threat actor is affiliated with China.\n\nAfter following the above attribution model and carefully reviewing the data, we are able to\nnarrow down the suspect list to three known APT groups, all of which are known to be\nlinked to China- APT10, APT27, and DragonOK.\n\nHaving found multiple similarities to previous attacks, it is our estimation that the threat\n[actor behind these attacks is likely linked to APT10, or at the very least, to a threat actor that](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\nshares tools, techniques, motive and infrastructural preferences with those of APT10.\n\nWhile we cannot completely rule out a “copy-cat” scenario, where another threat actor might\nmasquerade as APT10 to thwart attribution efforts, we find this option to be less likely in\nlight of our analysis of the data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog, we have described an ongoing global attack against telecommunications\nproviders that has been active since at least 2017. The threat actor managed to infiltrate\ninto the deepest segments of the providers’ network, including some isolated from the\ninternet, as well as compromise critical assets. Our investigation showed that these attacks\nwere targeted, and that the threat actor sought to steal communications data of specific\nindividuals in various countries.\n\nThroughout this investigation, we have uncovered the infrastructure that facilitated the\nmalicious operations taken by this threat actor. The data exfiltrated by this threat actor, in\nconjunction with the TTPs and tools used, allowed us to determine with a very high\n**probability that the threat actor behind these malicious operations is backed by a nation**\n\n\n-----\n\nstate, and is affiliated with China. Our contextualized interpretation of the data suggests\nthat the threat actor is likely APT10, or at the very least, a threat actor that shares, or wishes\nto emulate its methods by using the same tools, techniques, and motives.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that even though the attacks targeted specific individuals, any\nentity that possesses the power to take over the networks of telecommunications providers\ncan potentially leverage its unlawful access and control of the network to shut down or\ndisrupt an entire cellular network as part of a larger cyber warfare operation.\n\nDue to multiple and various limitations, we cannot disclose all the information we have\ngathered on the attack in this report. Our team will continue to monitor and track the threat\nactor’s activity in order to identify more tools and compromised organizations.\n\nAsk the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar.\n\n**Closing Notes: This research, which is still ongoing, has been a huge effort for the entire**\n**Cybereason Nocturnus team. Special thanks goes to Niv Yona, Noa Pinkas, Josh**\n**Trombley, Jakes Jansen, and every single member of the Nocturnus team for the**\ncountless hours and effort that were put into this research. We will continue to monitor and\nupdate our blog with more information once available and as our investigation progresses.\n\n\n-----",
