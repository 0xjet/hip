As a result of a configuration flaw of the malware's command\n\nand control (C2) server, some server directories were externally accessible. The\n\nfollowing new samples were found on the server:\n\n� ShadowPad\n\n� A previously unknown Python backdoor\n\n� Utility for progressing the attack\n\n� Encrypted xDII backdoor\n\nShadowPad is used by Winnti (APT41, BARIUM, AXIOM), a group that has been active\n\nsince at least 2012. This state-sponsored group originates from China.[2] The key\n\ninterests of the group are espionage and financial gain. Their core toolkit consists\n\nof malware of their own making. Winnti uses complex attack methods, including\n\nsupply chain and watering hole attacks. The group knows exactly who their victims\n\nare. They develop attacks very carefully and deploy their primary tools only after\n\ndetailed reconnaissance of the infected system. The group attacks countries all\n\nover the world: Russia, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Mongolia,\n\nBelarus, India, and Brazil. The group tends to attack the following industries:\n\n� Gaming\n\n� Software development\n\n� Aerospace\n\n� Energy\n\n� Pharmaceuticals\n\n� Finance\n\n� Telecom\n\n� Construction\n\n� Education\n\nThe first attack with ShadowPad was recorded in 2017.[3] This backdoor has been\n\noften used in supply chain attacks such as the CCleaner[4] and ASUS[5] hacks. ESET\n\nreleased its most recent report about Winnti activities involving ShadowPad in\n\nJanuary 2020.[6] We didn't find any connection with the current infrastructure.\n\nHowever, during research we found that the new ShadowPad infrastructure had\n\ncommonalities with infrastructures of other groups, which may mean that Winnti\n\nwas involved in other attacks with previously unknown organizers and perpetrators.\n\nThis report contains a detailed analysis of the new network infrastructure related\n\nto ShadowPad, new samples of malware from the Winnti group, and also analysis\n\nof ties to other attacks possibly associated with the group.\n\n_[1. twitter.com/Vishnyak0v/status/1239908264831311872](https://twitter.com/Vishnyak0v/status/1239908264831311872)_\n\n_[2. securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/ )_\n\n_[3. securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/ )_\n\n_[4. blog.avast.com/update-ccleaner-attackers-entered-via-teamviewer](https://blog.avast.com/update-ccleaner-attackers-entered-via-teamviewer )_\n\n_[5. securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/ )_\n\n_[6. welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. Network infrastructure\n\n### 1.1. Detecting ShadowPad\n\nInitially, when the xDll backdoor was analyzed (see Section 2.2), it could not be clearly tied to any\n\nAPT group. The sample had a very interesting C2 server, www.g00gle_jp.dynamic-dns[.]net, which\n\npotentially could indicate attacks against Japan. When we studied the network infrastructure and\n\nsearched for similar samples, we found several domains with similar names.\n\n_Figure 1. Network infrastructure of the Winnti group at the initial stage of analysis_\n\nThe domain names give reason to suspect that attacks\n\nalso target South Korea, Mongolia, Russia, and the\n\nUnited States. When we studied the infrastructure\n\nfurther, we found several simple downloaders\n\nunfamiliar to us (see Section 2.1). They contact related\n\nC2 servers, and in the response should receive a XOR\nencrypted payload with key 0x37. The downloader\n\nwe found was named SkinnyD (Skinny Downloader)\n\nfor its small size and bare-bones functionality. The\n\nURL structure and some lines in SkinnyD make it very\n\nsimilar to the xDll backdoor.\n\nAt first, we could not obtain the payload for SkinnyD,\n\n\nbecause all C2 servers were inactive. But after a\n\nwhile, we found new samples of the xDII backdoor.\n\nWhen we analyzed one of the samples, we found\n\nsome public directories on its С2 server. The file\n\ncalled x.jpg is an xDll backdoor encrypted with XOR\n\nwith key 0x37. This suggests that xDll is a payload\n\nfor SkinnyD.\n\n\n_Figure 2. Structure of public directories_\n_on the discovered C2 server_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most interesting thing on the server is the\n\ncontents of the \"cache\" directory.\n\n_Figure 3. Contents of the \"cache\" directory_\n\n_Figure 4. Example of lines from the log (for detailed description of_\n_parameter values, see xDII analysis)_\n\n\nIt contains data about the victims and\n\nthe malware downloaded to infected\n\ncomputers. The name of the victim file\n\ncontains an MD5 hash of the MAC address\n\nfor the infected computer sent by xDll; the\n\nfile contents include the time of the last\n\nconnection to the C2 server. Based on the\n\nchanges in the second part of the name of\n\nthe malware file, server time might seem\n\nto be indicated in nanoseconds. But that\n\ncannot be true, since that would take us\n\nback all the way to March 1990. Ultimately,\n\nwe don't know why this time period was\n\nselected.\n\nIn the malware files, we found ShadowPad, a\n\npreviously unknown Python backdoor, and\n\nutilities for progressing the attack. Detailed\n\nanalysis of the malware and utilities is\n\nprovided in Section 2.\n\nAt certain intervals, the attackers request\n\ninformation from infected computers via\n\nthe xDII backdoor. This information is saved\n\nto the file list.gif.\n\nWe should note that in the xDII samples we\n\nhave, the Domain field contains the name\n\nof the domain where the infected computer\n\nis located. However, in the log that field for\n\nalmost all computers contains the SID of\n\nthe user whose name was used to launch\n\nxDII. That may be an error in the code of\n\na certain xDII version, because this value\n\ndoes not provide any useful information to\n\nthe attackers.\n\nGoing deeper into the network\n\ninfrastructure, we found that many servers\n\nhave the same chain of SSL certificates with\n\nthe following parameters:\n\n� Root: C=CN, ST=myprovince, L=mycity,\n\nO=myorganization, OU=mygroup,\n\nCN=myCA, SHA1=0a71519f5549b21510\n\n410cdf4a85701489676ddb\n\n� Base: C=CN, ST=myprovince, L=mycity,\n\nO=myorganization, OU=mygroup,\n\nCN=myServer, SHA1=2d2d79c478e92a7\n\nde25e661ff1a68de0833b9d9b\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Parameters of the SSL certificate_\n\nWe have encountered this certificate in several publications about ShadowPad attacks.\n\nThe first one is an investigation of the 2017 attack on CCleaner. Avast has provided details[7] regarding the\n\nattack. A screenshot, included there, shows the same certificate.\n\nThe second is a talk by FireEye researchers at Code Blue 2019 about cyberattacks against Japanese\n\ntargets.[8] In one of the attacks, the researchers found the use of POISONPLUG (the name for ShadowPad\n\nused by FireEye). Analysis of the infrastructure revealed the same certificate on ShadowPad C2 servers.\n\n_Figure 6. Slide from the FireEye presentation_\n\n_[7. blog.avast.com/update-ccleaner-attackers-entered-via-teamviewer](https://blog.avast.com/update-ccleaner-attackers-entered-via-teamviewer )_\n\n_[8. slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/cb19-cyber-threat-landscape-in-japan-revealing-threat-in-the-shadow-by-chi-en-shen-ashley-oleg-](https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/cb19-cyber-threat-landscape-in-japan-revealing-threat-in-the-shadow-by-chi-en-shen-ashley-oleg-bondarenko)_\n_[bondarenko](https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/cb19-cyber-threat-landscape-in-japan-revealing-threat-in-the-shadow-by-chi-en-shen-ashley-oleg-bondarenko)_\n\n\n-----\n\nSearching for servers with this certificate helped us not only detect new ShadowPad samples and C2\n\nservers, but also find connections to other attacks previously not attributed to Winnti (see Section 1.2).\n\nAs a result, we found over 150 IP addresses with this certificate, or addresses where it had been installed\n\npreviously. Of these, 24 addresses were active at the time of writing of this article. There were also 147\n\ndomains related to those addresses. For the domains, we found Winnti malware.\n\nDuring our research, the group's domains relocated from one IP address to another many times, which\n\nis indicative of active attack operations.\n\nHowever, the motive for using the same SSL certificate on almost all ShadowPad C2 servers was not\n\nclear. This may be the result of having the same system image installed on the C2 servers, or else simple\n\noverconfidence.\n\nWe saw the same thing with certificates when researching the activity of the TaskMasters[9] group. At\n\nsome point, the attackers started installing self-signed certificates with identical metadata on their\n\nservers, which ultimately helped us in finding their infrastructure.\n\nThe following figure shows distribution of detected IP addresses by location:\n\n4.4%\n\n2.4% 47.6%\n\n3.4%\n\n\n3.8%\n\n18.3% 20.2%\n\n\nHong Kong\n\nU.S.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nMalaysia\n\nSingapore\n\nChina\n\nOthers\n\n_Russia 1.9%_\n_United Kingdom 1%_\n_Netherlands 0.5%_\n_Lithuania 0.5%_\n_Germany 0.5%_\n\n_Figure 7. Geolocation of C2 servers_\n\n\nAbout half of the group's servers are located in Hong Kong. The IP addresses are distributed between\n\n45 unique providers. More than half of the servers are concentrated on the IP addresses of six providers,\n\nfive of which are in Asia (Hong Kong, China, and South Korea).\n\n_[9. ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/operation-taskmasters-2019/](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/operation-taskmasters-2019/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1.2. Links to other groups\n\n#### 1.2.1. TA459\n\nIn 2017, Proofpoint issued a report about attacks against targets in Russia and Belarus using ZeroT and\n\nPlugX.[10] The report mentions the domain yandax[.]net, which was indirectly related to the infrastructure\n\nused in that attack. The domain was on the same IP address as one of the PlugX servers. WHOIS data\n\nof that domain looks as follows:\n\n_Figure 8. Registrant lookup for the domain yandax[.]net_\n\nIn the past few years, the email address dophfg@yahoo[.]com has been used to register several more\n\ndomains.\n\n_Figure 9. Domains with similar WHOIS data_\n\n_[10. proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/APT-targets-russia-belarus-zerot-plugx](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/APT-targets-russia-belarus-zerot-plugx)_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn our study of ShadowPad infrastructure, we came across active servers linked to two domains from\n\nthe group: www.ertufg[.]com and www.ncdle[.]net. Those servers also had the SSL certificate typical\n\nof ShadowPad. In addition, we found ShadowPad samples connecting to those domains. One of the\n\nsamples had a rather old compilation date, July 2017. However, this time is probably not accurate,\n\nbecause the C2 server for it was registered in August 2018. It can also disguise itself as a Bluetooth Stack\n\ncomponent for Windows by Toshiba named TosBtKbd.dll.\n\n_Figure 10. Structure of domains related to ShadowPad_\n\nHere we can make another inference. The domain yandax[.]net initially had a different email address in\n\nits WHOIS data: fjknge@yahoo[.]com. The same address was also used to register one of the NetTraveler\n\nC2 servers, namely, riaru[.]net. That domain was used for attacks targeting the CIS and Europe. These\n\nattacks have been described by Proofpoint researchers.[11] It is also possible that the infrastructure\n\nwas used by some other group to disguise its activities. However, the scope, targeted countries, and\n\nindustries all overlap with those of the Winnti group. The connections are indirect and individual in\n\nnature, but still provide reason to believe that all these attacks were carried out by the same group.\n\n_[11. proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/nettraveler-apt-targets-russian-european-interests](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/nettraveler-apt-targets-russian-european-interests)_\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 1.2.2. Bisonal\n\nOn one of the IP addresses on ShadowPad infrastructure, we found domains used in Bisonal RAT attacks\n\nin 2015–2020.\n\n_Figure 11. ShadowPad and Bisonal domains sharing an IP address_\n\nIn addition, we found a Bisonal sample with a direct relationship to the new ShadowPad infrastructure.\n\n_Figure 12. Bisonal and ShadowPad infrastructure_\n\nWe came across a presentation[12] made at JSAC 2020 by Hajime Takai, a Japanese researcher with NTT\n\nSecurity. The researcher details an attack on Japanese systems, in which the chain included xDII for\n\ndownloading Bisonal to the infected computer.\n\n_[12. jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_3_takai_jp.pdf](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_3_takai_jp.pdf)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Slide from Hajime Takai's research_\n\nTakai links the attack to the Bitter Biscuit campaign described by Unit 42.[13] Bisonal was used in that\n\nattack, too. The attack tools found by Takai are almost completely identical to the ones we found on the\n\nShadowPad server. Even some hash sums are identical (see Section 2).\n\nResearchers believe[14] that the Bisonal attacks were performed by Tonto Team. The group concentrates\n\nits efforts on three countries: Russia, South Korea, and Japan. Its targets include governmental entities,\n\nmilitaries, finance, and industry. All these fall within the area of interests of the Winnti group. And with\n\nthe new details about Bisonal used together with xDII, plus overlapping network infrastructures, it\n\nstands to reason that the Winnti group is behind the Bisonal attacks.\n\n### 1.3. Victims\n\nAccording to the server data, more than 50 computers had been infected. We could not establish the\n\nexact location and industry for every infected computer. However, if we match the time of the latest\n\nconnection of the infected computer to the server and the time we received the file with this timestamp,\n\nwe can make a map of the timezones.\n\n_Figure 14. Map with victims' timezones_\n\n_[13. unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-bisonal-malware-used-attacks-russia-south-korea/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-bisonal-malware-used-attacks-russia-south-korea/ )_\n\n_[14. blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/bisonal-10-years-of-play.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/bisonal-10-years-of-play.html)_\n\n\n-----\n\nMost countries located in the timezones marked on the map are within the area of interest of Winnti.\n\nWe were able to identify some of the compromised organizations, including:\n\n� A university in the U.S.\n\n� An audit firm in the Netherlands\n\n� Two construction companies (one in Russia, the other in China)\n\n� Five software developers (one in Germany, four in Russia)\n\nAll victims, both identified and unidentified, were notified by the national CERTs.\n\nWe have no details about those attacks. However, since ShadowPad was used in supply chain attacks via\n\nsoftware developers, and knowing that at least two software developers have been compromised, we\n\nare dealing with either a new distribution attempt or an attack that is already in progress.\n\n### 1.4. Activity\n\nActivity on the server (such as collection of information from the victims and appearance of new utilities)\n\nusually took place outside of the business hours in the victims' timezones. For some, it was evening; for\n\nothers, early morning. This tactic is typical of Winnti. The group did the same when they compromised\n\nCCleaner, as Avast reported.\n\n## 2. Analysis of malware and tools\n\nJudging by the data we collected, the delivery process in the current campaign looks as follows:\n\n##### Phishing ShadowPad\n\n xDII Bisonal\n\n Python SkinnyD backdoor\n\n Unknown vector Utils\n\n_Figure 15. Payload delivery diagram_\n\nThe compilation time of the malware samples we found corresponds to business hours in UTC+8\n\ntimezone (where China and Hong Kong are located).\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n5\n2\n\n\n23:00\n\n22:00\n\n21:00\n\n20:00\n\n19:00\n\n18:00\n\n17:00\n\n16:00\n\n15:00\n\n14:00\n\n13:00\n\n12:00\n\n11:00\n\n10:00\n\n9:00\n\n8:00\n\n7:00\n\n6:00\n\n5:00\n\n4:00\n\n3:00\n\n2:00\n\n1:00\n\n0:00\n\n\n5\n2\n\n\n23:00\n\n22:00\n\n21:00\n\n20:00\n\n19:00\n\n18:00\n\n17:00\n\n16:00\n\n15:00\n\n14:00\n\n13:00\n\n12:00\n\n11:00\n\n10:00\n\n9:00\n\n8:00\n\n7:00\n\n6:00\n\n5:00\n\n4:00\n\n3:00\n\n2:00\n\n1:00\n\n0:00\n\n\n_Figure 16. Malware compilation time in UTC+0_ _Figure 17. Malware compilation time in UTC+8_\n\n### 2.1. Analyzing SkinnyD\n\nSkinnyD (Skinny Downloader) is a simple downloader: it contains several C2 addresses and goes through\n\nthem one by one.\n\nThe next stage is downloaded with a GET request to the С2 server via a special URL address generated\n\naccording to a format string hard-coded in the malware code.\n\n_Figure 18. URL format string_\n\nThe malware checks the data received from the C2 as follows:\n\n� The data size must be more than 0x2800 bytes.\n\n� The data must begin with the bytes \"4D 5A\" (MZ).\n\nThe downloaded binary file is decrypted with XOR and loaded with PE reflective loading. After the\n\nbinary file loads, control transfers to the exported symbol MyCode.\n\nThe malware gains persistence via the key Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript.[15]\n\n_[15. attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19. Persistence code_\n\nIn the SkinnyD samples we studied, we found an interesting artifact linking it to xDII. This was the string\n\n\"3853ed273b89687\". Since the string is not used by the downloader, perhaps it's a builder artifact.\n\n### 2.2. Analyzing xDII\n\n#### 2.2.1. Dropper\n\nThe dropper is an executable file written in C and compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio. Its compilation\n\ndate (February 11, 2020, 9:54:40 AM) looks plausible.\n\n_Figure 20. General information about the dropper_\n\nIt contains a payload in the form of the xDII backdoor in the data section.\n\n_Figure 21. Another executable file in the dropper_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dropper extracts 59,392 bytes of data and attempts to write this to one of two paths:\n\n� %windir%\\Device.exe\n\n� %windir%\\system32\\browseui.dll\n\nNext, it copies itself to the directory %windir%\\DeviceServe.exe and creates a service named VService,\n\nthereby ensuring auto-launch as a service.\n\n_Figure 22. Installing the service_\n\nWhen the service runs, it creates a separate thread for running the payload.\n\n_Figure 23. Running the payload_\n\nWe should note that there is no option to launch a different payload variant in the form of a DLL library\n\n(browseui.dll).\n\n#### 2.2.2. xDll backdoor\n\nThe backdoor is a file written in C++ and compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio using the MFC library. It also\n\nhas a plausible compilation date of February 10, 2020, 6:14:37 PM.\n\n_Figure 24. General information about the payload_\n\n\n-----\n\nIt creates a separate thread in which all actions take place.\n\nIt starts by scouting the system and collects the following information:\n\n� Computer name\n\n� IP address\n\n� OEM code page\n\n� MAC address (used later on to calculate the MD5 hash sum for C2 interactions)\n\n_Figure 25. Obtaining MAC address_\n\n� OS version\n\n_Figure 26. Obtaining OS version_\n\n\n-----\n\n� The preset identifier \"sssss\" (probably characteristic of this particular version of the backdoor)\n\n� Whether the user is an admin\n\n_Figure 27. Checking privileges_\n\n� Whether it is in a virtual environment\n\n_Figure 28. Checking the environment_\n\n� Domain and username\n\n_Figure 29. Obtaining domain and username_\n\n\n-----\n\n� CPU\n\n_Figure 30. Obtaining CPU information_\n\n� RAM\n\n_Figure 31. Obtaining information about RAM_\n\n� System language\n\n_Figure 32. Obtaining information about the system language_\n\nNext, the backdoor decrypts C2 server addresses. In this case, there are two, but they are identical:\n\nwww.oseupdate.dns-dns[.]com. The backdoor body contains a third address (127.0.0.1), which is\n\nreplaced with the decrypted one.\n\n_Figure 33. Decrypting C2 address_\n\nWhen the C2 server address is obtained, a GET request will be sent, with its format as follows:\n\nhxxp://{host}:{port}/{uri}?type=1&hash={md5}&time={current_time}. Request parameters are:\n\n� host (C2 address)\n\n� port (port 80)\n\n\n-----\n\n� uri (string \"news.php\")\n\n� md5 (hash sum of the MAC address, which is probably the victim's identifier)\n\n� current_time (current system time)\n\nHere's how it all looks:\n\n_Figure 34. Sample request to the server_\n\nNote that the request uses a preset value for the HTTP User-Agent header:\n\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.2) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.122\n\nSafari/534.30\n\n\n_Figure 35. Embedded User-Agent_\n\nThe expected server response is the character \"1\". If that response is received, a POST request is sent\n\nwith basic system information in JSON format:\n\n� Hash sum of the MAC address\n\n� Computer name\n\n� IP address\n\n� OS version\n\n� Domain name\n\n� Preset identifier \"sssss\"\n\n� OEM code page\n\nExample request:\n\n_Figure 36. Sending system information_\n\nWe should note that the JSON format used is incorrect. In addition, the value of the In_IP field is missing.\n\nPerhaps it was expected that both the internal and external IP addresses would be determined. But logic\n\nfor determining the external address was not yet implemented in this variant of xDII. Another tell-tale\n\ndetail is the value (\"post_info\") of the Referer HTTP header. In addition, a different value is selected for\n\nthe User-Agent HTTP header:\n\n\n-----\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR\n\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\n\nNext comes the loop for processing C2 commands. For that purpose, the backdoor sends a GET request\n\nin a format matching the one described earlier. The only difference is that \"type\" parameter value is now\n\n\"2\" instead of \"1\":\n\nhxxp://{host}:{port}/{uri}?type=2&hash={md5}&time={current_time}\n\nThe expected server response is a lowercase Latin letter (from a to z). The following table shows\n\ncommands and the corresponding actions:\n\n**Command** **Action**\n\nc Collect and send information about connected volumes\n\nd Collect and send contents of directory\n\ne Receive a file from the server, save it to the system, and report success\n\nf Run the indicated ShellExecuteA and report success\n\ng Delete the indicated file with ShellExecuteA and report success\n\nh Upload the indicated file to the server\n\nj Collect and send a list of system processes\n\nk End the indicated process and report success\n\nl Execute the command with cmd.exe and send the output\n\nm Continue communicating with cmd.exe and run further commands\n\nn Collect and send a list of system services\n\no Send all information collected during reconnaissance\n\nq Same as d\n\nu Start all communication with C2 again\n\nSuccessful execution of some commands requires additional data. For instance, downloading a file from\n\nthe server (the \"e\" command) requires indicating the file name. In this case, the server provides that\n\nname after a comma. For instance, \"e,dangerous_file.txt\".\n\nThis is what a request and the response look like:\n\n_Figure 37. An example of a command for downloading a file_\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the file is requested and its content is returned:\n\n_Figure 38. File content sent to the server_\n\nThen a report indicating successful download is sent.\n\n_Figure 39. Report on successful file download_\n\nNotice again the idiosyncratic value of the \"Referer: upfile\" field, the type of transmitted data (image/\n\npjpeg), and the name of the transmitted file: {md5}.gif (using the hash sum of the MAC address).\n\nWhen the command for collecting the directory listing (the \"d\" command) is processed, the delineator\n\nis not a comma. Instead, the path to the catalog is expected to start from the second character, for\n\ninstance: \"d|C:\\Users\".\n\n_Figure 40. Directory listing_\n\nThe data is transmitted in JSON format, and this time the format is correct.\n\nThe following example shows sending information obtained from system analysis (the \"o\" command).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 41. Sending system information_\n\nThe data is submitted in JSON format again, but with fewer keys.\n\nThe JSON string templates are specified in the backdoor; the string itself is formed by concatenation,\n\nwithout using any special libraries.\n\nHowever, in some cases, when a brief report is sufficient, the information may be transmitted in plaintext.\n\n_Figure 42. Result of command for code execution_\n\n### 2.3. ShadowPad\n\nAs mentioned, we found some public directories on one of the xDll servers, and one of those directories\n\ncontained ShadowPad. We found no significant differences from earlier versions, therefore the following\n\nis only a brief analysis of the new version.\n\n#### 2.3.1. ShadowPad loader and obfuscation\n\nThe first stage is decryption of the shell code responsible for installing the backdoor on the system. The\n\nshellcode is decrypted with an XOR-like algorithm, which modifies the encryption key at each iteration\n\nwith arithmetic operations with certain constants.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 43. Main module decryption cycle_\n\nAfter decryption, control transfers to the loader, which features a characteristic type of obfuscation.\n\n_Figure 44. Obfuscation used in the loader_\n\nWe already saw this type of obfuscation in previous versions of ShadowPad. Certain bytes are inserted\n\nin various sections of the code pre-marked with two opposite conditional jumps pointing to the same\n\naddress. To do away with this obfuscation, the indicated bytes must be replaced (with the \"nop\" opcode,\n\nfor instance).\n\nAfter the addresses of the API functions are received and the required code is placed in memory, control\n\npasses to the backdoor installation stage.\n\n#### 2.3.2. ShadowPad modules\n\nLike the previous versions, this backdoor\n\nhas a modular architecture. By default, the\n\nbackdoor includes the following modules:\n\n_Figure 45. Calling the functions for decryption and_\n_decompression of the modules built into the backdoor_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Module**\n**ID** **Compilation time**\n**name**\n\nRoot 5E6909BA GMT: Wednesday, 11 March 2020, 15:54:34\n\nPlugins 5E69097C GMT: Wednesday, 11 March 2020, 15:53:32\n\nOnline 5E690988 GMT: Wednesday, 11 March 2020, 15:53:44\n\nConfig 5E690982 GMT: Wednesday, 11 March 2020, 15:53:38\n\nInstall 5E69099F GMT: Wednesday, 11 March 2020, 15:54:07\n\nDNS 5E690909 GMT: Wednesday, 11 March 2020, 15:51:37\n\nThe identifiers of these modules remain unchanged from version to version; they, too, are installed and\n\nrun in a separate thread via the registry. Module compilation times can be found in the auxiliary header\n\nthat comes before the shellcode.\n\n_Figure 46. Location of the compilation time in the shellcode header_\n\nA typical feature of any copy of ShadowPad\n\nis encryption of the strings in each module.\n\nThe encryption algorithm is similar to the\n\none used for backdoor decryption. The\n\nonly difference is in the constants used for\n\nkey modification.\n\nThe method of calling some API functions\n\nin ShadowPad modules is somewhat\n\ninteresting. Some copies of the malware\n\ncalculate the function address for each\n\ntime a function is called, as shown in Figure\n\n47. In addition, addresses of the functions\n\nto be called can be obtained via a special\n\nstructure. Loading addresses for libraries\n\nare obtained based on the values of the\n\nstructure members, to which the offsets of\n\nthe required API functions are then added.\n\n_Figure 47. String decryption code in ShadowPad_\n\n_Figure 48. Example of obfuscation of calling an API function_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 49. De-obfuscated calls (illustrated by Install module)_\n\nFor persistence, the backdoor copies itself to C:\\ProgramData\\ALGS\\ under the name Algs.exe and\n\ncreates a service with the same name.\n\n_Figure 50. Service created for gaining persistence_\n\nThe malware proceeds to launch a new svchost.exe process, which it injects with its own code and then\n\ngives control.\n\n_Figure 51. Code for creating process and injecting into it_\n\n#### 2.3.3. ShadowPad configuration\n\nIn all samples of the backdoor, the configuration is encrypted. The Config module is responsible for\n\noperations with it.\n\nConfiguration is a sequence of encrypted strings, in which each string follows the previous one without\n\nany zero padding or alignment. The configuration is encrypted by the same algorithm as the strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 52. Decrypted malware configuration_\n\n#### 2.3.4. Network protocol\n\nThe format of the packets used in all\n\nShadowPad versions has remained\n\nunchanged.[16] For the packets sent to the\n\nserver, the packet body and the packet\n\nheader are generated separately. After\n\nthey are concatenated (without any\n\npadding), the packet is covered with an\n\nencryption algorithm with logic close to\n\nthat of the algorithms used for decrypting\n\nthe main module and the strings inside the\n\nbackdoor. Figure 53 shows the algorithm.\n\n_Figure 53. Packet encryption code used_\n_in exchanges with the C2 server_\n\nThe structure of encrypted packets received from the C2 server is fairly simple (as illustrated by the Init\n\npacket).\n\n_Figure 54. Structure of ShadowPad packets_\n\n### 2.4. Python backdoor\n\nThis backdoor we found on the server was in py2exe format. The backdoor is written in Python 2.7 and\n\ncontains configuration variables in the beginning.\n\n_[16. media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/08/07172148/ShadowPad_technical_description_PDF.pdf](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/08/07172148/ShadowPad_technical_description_PDF.pdf)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThree commands can be executed\n\nremotely:\n\n� CMDCMD: execute via cmd.exe\n\n� UPFILECMD: upload the file\n\nto the server\n\n� DOWNFILECMD: download\n\nthe file from the server\n\nThe ONLINECMD command is executed\n\nby the backdoor right after launch. This\n\nis a command for collecting system\n\ninformation and sending it to the server.\n\n_Figure 56. Commands for collecting system information_\n\n\n_Figure 55. Backdoor configuration_\n\n\nThe backdoor has a function for gaining persistence via the registry:\n\n\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\" /v\n\n\"startup\" /d \"c:/Windows/system32/idles.exe\n\n\nAfter gaining persistence and collecting system information, the malware packs the data and uploads it\n\nto the C2 server. Interaction with the server is via TCP sockets:\n\n\nsocket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n\nCertain values are added in before the data is sent; then the data is compressed with ZLIB and encoded\n\nin Base64.\n\n_Figure 57. Data packing algorithm_\n\nIn the code in Figure 55:\n\n� Flag is the value initialized when the backdoor starts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 58. Initializing the \"flag\" parameter_\n\n� Key is the value from configuration changes.\n\n� Cmd is an executed config command.\n\n� Data is the collected data.\n\n� After the data is prepared, its length and the delimiter indicated in the config are added to the\n\nbeginning, and then the data is sent to the server.\n\n_Figure 59. Forming the final data packet_\n\n_Figure 60. Example of formed data_\n\nAfter the initial system data is sent, the backdoor goes into a loop as it awaits a command from the\n\nserver.\n\n_Figure 61. Main loop_\n\n### 2.5. Utilities\n\nAmong our finds on the server were utilities for lateral movement. Most of those are open-source ones\n\navailable on GitHub. They were initially written in Python but converted to PE. The server had the\n\nfollowing utilities:\n\n� Utilities[17] to check for and exploit vulnerability MS17-010\n\n� LaZagne[18] for gathering passwords\n\n� get_lsass[19] for dumping passwords on x64 systems\n\n_[17. github.com/worawit/MS17-010/blob/master/checker.py](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/blob/master/checker.py)_\n\n_[18. github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)_\n\n_[19. github.com/3gstudent/Homework-of-C-Language/blob/master/sekurlsa-wdigest.cpp](https://github.com/3gstudent/Homework-of-C-Language/blob/master/sekurlsa-wdigest.cpp)_\n\n\n-----\n\n� NBTScan\n\n� DomainInfo for collecting domain information\n\nThe hackers tweaked the functionality of the MS17-010 utility by adding the ability to check an entire\n\nsubnet.\n\n_Figure 62. Modified utility for checking for MS17-010_\n\nNetwork scanning is performed out of sequence, which may throw defenders off the scent. In addition,\n\nthe scan will skip addresses with 1 and 2 in the final octets, because such addresses very rarely belong\n\nto user computers.\n\nAnother utility of note on the server collects information about the domain of the target computer. The\n\ninformation includes the following:\n\n� Computer name\n\n� Names of computer users, divided into groups\n\n� Domain name\n\n� Name of the current user's group\n\n� Names of the groups on the domain\n\n� Names of users in each group\n\nAll this information is collected in a legitimate way via the API functions of library Netapi32.dll and saved\n\nto the utility directory in XML format.\n\nInterestingly enough, the utility was compiled in 2014 with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and has the PDB\n\n\"e:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\DomainInfo\\Release\\Domain05.pdb\".\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe have analyzed the infrastructure of the Winnti group and conclude that it has been active since early\n\n2019. Currently this infrastructure is growing, which means Winnti is active. According to our information,\n\nthe group has already compromised over 50 computers, and some of those may serve as a staging\n\nground for subsequent, more serious attacks. The group has added new malware to its arsenal, such\n\nas SkinnyD, xDll, and a Python backdoor. We found important connections between the current Winnti\n\ninfrastructure and other large attacks in which the group may have been directly involved.\n\nThe observed spike in the group's activity may be related to the coronavirus pandemic. Many companies\n\nhave switched employees to working from home and, as shown by our data, 80 percent of employees\n\nuse their personal computers for work. The result is that many employees are currently not protected by\n\ncorporate security tools and security policies. This makes them an easy target.\n\n**MD5** **SHA-1** **SHA-256**\n\n##### SkinnyD\n\nec2377cbd3065b4d75 cdd78ccd274705f6c94b6640 1d59968304f26651526a27dabd2780006ebd\n1a791a22bd302c c968e90972597865
