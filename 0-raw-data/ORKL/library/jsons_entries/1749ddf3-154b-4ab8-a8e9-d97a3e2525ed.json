Those elements allowed the Service des technologies et des systèmes\nd’information de la sécurité intérieure ST(SI)², part of the Gendarmerie nationale, to create\nthat software.\"\n\n[While pyLocky has not seen a wide distribution, the post by the French Ministry of Interior](https://www.cybermalveillance.gouv.fr/nos-articles/outil-dechiffrement-rancongiciel-ransomware-pylocky-v1-2/)\nstates it is more active in Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\nPyLocky is very active in Europe and there are already many victims in France, both within\nthe professional environment (SMEs, large businesses, associations, etc.) as well as at\nhome.\"\n\n## Getting the pyLocky Decryptor\n\nThe pyLocky decryptor will decrypt files encrypted by version 1 and 2 of the ransomware.\nSupported encrypted file extensions for version 1 are .lockedfile or .lockymap and version\n2 is .locky.\n\nFor those who were encrypted, you can download the pyLocky Decryptor from the following\nlink.\n\npyLocky Decryptor\n\n[Download Now](https://www.cybermalveillance.gouv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PyLocky_Decryptor_V1_V2.zip)\n[To use this decryptor, victims will need to have the Java Runtime installed. Once installed,](https://www.java.com/en/download/)\nvictims can double-click on the PyLocky_Decryptor_V1_V2.jar file to launch the decryptor.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstructions on how to use the decryptor are included in the downloaded zip file or can be\n[read online.](https://www.cybermalveillance.gouv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pylocky_Decryption_Tutorial.pdf)\n\n## Possible Command & Control server takeover\n\nThe pyLocker Ransomware utilizes Command & Control servers on the Tor network. These\nTor servers are provided in the ransom notes created on a victim's computer as shown\nbelow.\n\n**pyLocky Ransom Note**\n[Based on analysis by Michael Gillespie, the decryptor contains 2 hard coded private RSA](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nkeys.\n\nThis could mean that French law enforcement or security researchers were able to gain\naccess to a command and control server and retrieve the master private encryption keys for\nversions 1 and 2 of the ransomware.\n\nIt would also indicate that this is not a flaw in the encryption algorithm used by the\nransomware.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryptor/)\n[pyLocky](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/pylocky/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
