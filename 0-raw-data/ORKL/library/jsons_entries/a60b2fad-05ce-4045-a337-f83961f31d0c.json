    "plain_text": "# Taking off the Blackshades\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2014/05/taking-off-the-blackshades/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2014/05/taking-off-the-blackshades/)**\n\nAdam Kujawa May 30, 2014\n\n[About two years ago, I wrote a series of blog posts that covered a particular Remote Access](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/?s=Blackshades)\nTrojan (RAT) known as Blackshades. The posts covered how Blackshades was used against\nSyrian rebels, how the co-creator was arrested and a detailed analysis of the RAT\nfunctionality.\n\nWell if you haven’t heard, they are back in the news again, this time because of a massive\nglobal effort by law enforcement to take down the RAT once and for all.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast Monday, a mass arrest took place against not only the creators and distributors of\nBlackshades but also the customers. More than 90 people were arrested globally for being\nsomehow involved with Blackshades in the largest offensive move against RATs ever done\nby global law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Can you ever get rid of RATs?\n\nSo what does this mean for the current and potential victims of Blackshades and RAT\ntechnology?\n\nFortunately, the interest in Blackshades has decreased due to an array of different issues\nwith the product. Customers are no longer trusting of the tool, not only because of the arrests\nbut also because of bugged versions discovered that opened a backdoor onto the attackers\nsystem, essentially turning a bad guy into just another victim.\n\n“For Newcomers I can tell, don’t touch RAT’s like Blackshades, because they are backdoored and\n\noutdated…”\n\nUnfortunately, when one tool or bad guy gets busted in the cyber-crime community, it doesn’t\nstop the crime but merely modifies its execution.\n\nAlready, criminals who were considering using Blackshades have sought out different tools\nthat are a bit less popular in the hopes that they can still achieve their malicious goal without\nthe greater risk of being busted by the FBI.\n\nThe appeal of Blackshades was that it was often updated and had been used so greatly that\nits popularity brought droves of potential customers to its door.\n\n## The Freemium Model\n\nBlackshades was usually sold for $40 a pop, for the most updated version. This amount also\ncame with customer support and access to new updates for the software.\n\nHowever, paying wasn’t the only option. In my previous blog posts about Blackshades,\nnamely ‘You Dirty Rat Part 2″ I obtained a free (cracked) version of Blackshades for testing\npurposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackshades Server Binary Builder\n\nThe software was an older version that was currently available so it meant that some of the\nmore advanced features were not available.\n\nIn addition, while many ‘free’ versions of Blackshades usually come bundled with a backdoor\nor additional malware to infect the criminals, this one was completely clean.\n\nJust a sample of the kind of junk I got infected with looking for a legitimate version of Blackshades\n\n\n-----\n\nI didn t get my hands on a free version by simply asking around my cyber criminal buddies,\nor being part of some underground forum, all I had to do was search around online a little bit\nuntil I found one. Something that even a kid could do.\n\nAn advertisement for a cracked version of Blackshades on a overworld hacker forum\n\n## The Real Danger\n\nSo if you are wondering if an outdated version of Blackshades is even a threat, the answer is\nabsolutely. Though its necessary to talk about the real threat associated with any malware,\nthat is the delivery method and crypters.\n\nSo, delivery method refers to how the malware actually gets on the system. The easy\nmethods are things like a mass phishing email that makes you download and execute some\nprogram, not many people fall for that.\n\nThen of course there is the act of social engineering via bot or manually using things like\nSkype or Facebook to trick someone into trusting the criminal and then getting them to install\nthe malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third threat is drive-by exploits.\n\nWe have seen many types of malware distributed by drive-by exploits, all this attack requires\nis that a victim visit a certain website that exploits an application through the browser,\nsomething like Java or Flash. Usually this is a huge concern if the victim has failed to update\nthose applications with security patches.\n\nNext up are crypters, which are basically just applications that apply a custom algorithm to\nthe malware binary, mixing up the code and making it difficult to detect using traditional\npassive scan methods.\n\nThis means that if an old version of Blackshades was encrypted with a modern crypter tool, it\ncould potentially bypass an antivirus scan and even email filters that check for malware\n(Thanks Gmail!)\n\nCrypters are the real underground market commodity and since they are usually created by\nindividuals and maybe even small teams then sold to bot herders.\n\nIt is unlikely that we will see a mass arrest toward the entire crypter industry. They are also\nusually sold for far more than the malware itself, in fact Blackshades had a built-in crypter\nmarketplace that it included in it’s control panel, to make it easy for the bad guys to find a\ncrypter and apply it to their malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nCrypter marketplace — built into Blackshades interface\n\nLucky for us, most [antivirus and anti-malware software includes active protection will detect](https://www.malwarebytes.com/antivirus)\nthe operations of the malware after it has “decrypted” itself, which all malware must do\nbefore it can actually run on the system.\n\nIn addition, a scan with a security product AFTER the malware has been installed will most\nlikely remove it from your system, no problem.\n\n## Proactive Protection\n\nSo what can you do to protect yourself from RATs? Well common security practices are\nalways recommended, but specifically with this type of threat:\n\nInstall security software, be it a free or paid version of something like Malwarebytes\nAnti-Malware, Kaspersky AV or whatever you want, as long as it stays updated and can\ndetect the most common RATs.\nPut a piece of opaque tape over your webcam OR unplug your webcam (if possible)\nKeep your microphone muted when not using it. You can do this through the operating\nsystem in many cases.\nA common trick used by bad guys controlling a RAT is to paste the contents of\nwhatever is currently loaded in the systems copy cache. It’s important that whenever\nyou copy something sensitive, like a password, you copy something less important\nwhen you are done.\nLog off of social media when you are done using it, a RAT can take control of your\nbrowser that includes a valid and open instance of a social media site, allowing them to\npost on your behalf.\nBe suspicious of everything, if your mouse moves on it’s own or if your cursor suddenly\ntypes something that you don’t remember typing or if a window closes or opens on it’s\nown, maybe it’s a good time to run a deep scan.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Is It Over?\n\nLike I mentioned before, the threats that RATs pose will never be over, at least not for a\nwhile. We will see an evolution of their ability based on the market needs and the\ncapabilities of hardware and software, you can expect that much of a change.\n\nAs far as Blackshades being done with, it’s possible that a lack of interest due to the high\nprofile of this malware might drive away a large portion of the market, in which case\nBlackshades won’t be updated and it’s functionality will become obsolete.\n\nIt will only be a matter of time though until we see the next big RAT malware making its way\nfrom underground forums to user systems, we certainly know there are plenty of them that\ncan take the throne.\n\n\n-----\n\nA listing of different RATs being advertised on hacker forums\n\n## The Bright Side\n\nWhile RATs are incredibly dangerous, the bright side is that they are very inefficient.\n\nThe largest customer group for Remote Access Trojans are individuals or small groups who\njust want to use it to mess with people or steal valuable and sensitive information (images\nincluded). Even still, the time and effort it takes to launch an attack using a RAT and\n\n\n-----\n\nobtaining anything juicy against a stranger is usually greater than most cyber criminals have\nthe patience for.\n\nThe bottom line is that while RATs are a danger and you should keep an eye out for the\npossibility of one running on your system, we can all be even more afraid of things like\nRansomware and Banker Trojans that have been skillfully created for the purpose of efficient\nuser destruction.\n\n[Thanks for reading and safe surfing! @kujman5000](https://twitter.com/Kujman5000)\n\n\n-----",
