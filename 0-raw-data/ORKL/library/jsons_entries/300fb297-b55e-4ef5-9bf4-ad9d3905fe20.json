We first caught it on October 25, 2017, at that time, DDG used version\nnumber 2020 and 2021, and we noticed that the botnet has two internally reserved domain\nnames that had not been registered. So we went ahead and registered the two domain\nnames so we were able to measure the infections, (4,391 infected IPs) The original blog is\n[here.](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ddg-a-mining-botnet-aiming-at-database-server/)\n\nSome botnet goes away after we release the analysis report, such as http81 (persirai), but\nthe DDG stays.\n\nThree months after the release of our first DDG report, in May 2018, DDG got some major\nupdates. Version 3010 and 3011 appeared, we also witnessed the authors effort to polish the\n3011 so he can get the mining part work.\n\nOn June 12, we captured that DDG.Mining.Botnet released yet another new version 3012\nwith yet another c2 address. For all the technical details, please check our detailed DDG\nblog [here.](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ddg-mining-botnet-jin-qi-huo-dong-fen-xi/)\n\n**List of DDG Updates**\n\nThe following figures describe some high level overview and comparison between different\nDDG versions.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the figure we can see:\n\n**Version Update: Starting from October 2017, DDG has released three major version of**\n201x, 202x, and 301x, and six minor-versions.\n**C2 IP address: Four major C2 IPs have bee used.**\n**Module structure: Three major modules, propagate, keep-live, and mining**\n**Infection method: Brute force attacks on the SSH server and unauthorized access by**\nthe Redis server (2017-10 to date). In versions 201x and 202x, the Struts2 and\nOrientDB database servers were also targeted for infection.\n**Wallet Address: Three wallet addresses. And the file name of the mining program**\nnormally the same as the last 5 to 6 strings of the wallet address.\n**Redundancy: The author always keeps two versions of the botnet running at the same**\ntime to provide fault tolerance. After the 301x version, the author also started to use\nmultiple mine pools for redundancy. Such as mining pool hk02.supportxmr.com,\npool.supportxmr.com, xmr-asia1.nanopool.org, xmr-us-west1.nanopool.org, and mining\npool proxy 47.52.57.128,165.225.157.157\n\nIn addition:\n\n**Profit: According to our incomplete statistics, DDG's wallet addresses have received at**\nleast 7,425 Monroe coins just from Monero.crypto-pool.fr.\n\n\n-----\n\n**HUB: DDG uses a group of hacked servers to provide download service to infected**\nhosts. Each DDG version update refreshes this HUB_IP list. See the IoC section at the\nend of this article for infected IPs.\n\nFor Sinkhole, we sinkholed two unregistered domain names for DDG version 2020. Although\nthe DDG 2021 version were quickly released and removed these two domain names, we\nwere still able to get an accurate number of the infections. At that time, we recorded a total of\n4,391 victim IP addresses. The main victims were China (73%) and the United States (11%):\n\n**IoC**\n\nDDG C2 List\n```\n218.248.40.228  India/IN  National Capital Territory of Delhi/New Delhi \n202.181.169.98  Hong Kong/HK  Central and Western District/Central \n165.225.157.157  United States/US  Nevada/Las Vegas \n69.64.32.12  United States/US  Missouri/St Louis \n\n```\nIP_HUB list\n\n\n-----",
