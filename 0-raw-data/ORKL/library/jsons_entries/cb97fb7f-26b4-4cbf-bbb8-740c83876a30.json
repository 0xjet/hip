Visibility of these real-world incidents provided\n\n Secureworks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers with insight into emerging threats and\n\n developing trends that organizations can use to guide risk management decision-making,\n\n inform best practice, and prioritize resource allocation.\n\n The motivation and context for incident response (IR) engagements vary. For example, an\n\n organization's decision to use IR services could be influenced by the organization's internal\n\n resources, media reporting, or the organization entering a sensitive operational period. \n\n As a result, observed threat types may not reflect the broader threat landscape. Despite these\n\n limitations, data from IR engagements reveals how threat actors breach networks, how this\n\n activity impacts affected organizations, and how the incidents could have been prevented.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key Points:\n\nPost-intrusion ransomware continued to represent a significant threat to organizations due\nto the high impact these attacks can cause. However, business email compromise (BEC)\nattacks overtook post-intrusion ransomware to become the most common type of financially\nmotivated activity observed during Secureworks IR engagements in 2022.\n\nVulnerabilities in internet-facing systems remained a common initial access vector (IAV).\nHowever, the percentage of engagements where phishing was the IAV increased from 13% in\n2021 to 33% in 2022, likely due to an increase in BEC attacks.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) and cloud-based hosting have changed the attack surface,\nprompting threat actors to find creative ways to circumvent the security controls to achieve\ntheir objectives.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Observed Trends\n\nCybercrime continued to represent the greatest threat to Secureworks customers, with 79% of incidents\n\nattributed to financially motivated cybercriminals. By comparison, hostile government-sponsored activity was\n\nobserved in approximately 9% of Secureworks IR engagements. The remaining incidents were due to deliberate or\n\naccidental actions by organizations’ employees. The proportion of financially motivated intrusions was lower than\n\nprevious years, down from 85% in 2021 and 92% in 2020 (see Figure 1). This shift may be due in part to Russia's\n\n[invasion of Ukraine; it is possible that Ukrainian and Russian cybercriminals diverted their attention to hacktivist](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/ukraine-crisis-faqs)\n\noperations targeting organizations that supported the opposing country.\n\nFinancially motivated criminal Government-sponsored threat group Insider\n\n\n**FIGURE 1. Breakdown of threat actor types observed in Secureworks IR engagements from 2019 through 2022. (Source: Secureworks)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe financially motivated incidents in 2022 involved threats such as ransomware, BEC, and cryptojacking. Cybercriminal activity\nis opportunistic and is driven by threat actors’ ability to maximize the profits that can be generated by unauthorized access to\n\ncompromised networks. For that reason, extortion-based attacks such as ransomware continued to dominate.\n\n##### Initial access vectors\n\nIn 2022, exploitation of vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices and phishing were the most common IAVs observed in\nSecureworks IR engagements. They each accounted for approximately one-third of the incidents where the IAV could be\ndetermined (see Figure 2).\n\n###### REMOVABLE DRIVE-BY MEDIA 2% DOWNLOAD 2%\n\n PRE-EXISTING MALWARE INFECTION 2%\n THIRD PARTY 3%\n\n\n###### BRUTE FORCE 6%\n\n STOLEN CREDENTIALS 9%\n\n INSIDER 9%\n\n PHISHING 33%\n\n\n###### PASSWORD SPRAYING 1%\n\n VULNERABILITIES IN INTERNET-FACING DEVICES 33%\n\n\n**FIGURE 2.

This increase is largely due to the total number of observed BEC incidents more\n\nthan doubling between 2021 and 2022, as phishing was identified as the IAV in 85% of the 2022 BEC incidents. In most\n\ncases, the threat actors sent phishing emails to thousands of recipients that sometimes spanned multiple organizations.\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n2020 2021 2022\n\n\nPhishing\n\n\nCredentials Vulnerabilities in Internet-Facing Devices Third Party\n\n\n**FIGURE 3. Observed IAVs from 2020 to 2022. Credential abuse encompasses stolen credentials, brute-force attacks, and password spraying.**\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAs of this publication, BEC poses the largest monetary threat to organizations. In 2022, the U.S. Federal Bureau of\n\n[Investigation (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported an increase of 65% in identified global exposed](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220504)\n\nlosses from BEC attacks between July 2019 and December 2021. While the payouts appear to be increasing, the\n\ntechnical aspects of BEC schemes remain relatively simple. News of the potential profits and low barrier to entry likely\n\ninspired other groups with little to no technical capabilities to begin conducting BEC attacks.\n\nThe proportion of Secureworks IR engagements involving the exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing devices dropped\n\nslightly in 2022 but was still significantly higher than in 2020. Secureworks observed both financially motivated and\n\ngovernment-sponsored threat actors using this IAV. In many incidents, the threat actors leveraged publicly available\n\ninformation rather than identifying the vulnerabilities and developing exploit code themselves. Specifically, they\n\nweaponized proof-of-concept exploit code that security researchers published after the vulnerabilities were publicly\n\ndisclosed and could then conduct bulk scanning to identify and opportunistically exploit vulnerable devices. Sometimes\n\ndevices remain vulnerable for years before they are exploited. In 2022, CTU™ researchers continued to observe high\n[profile vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, and Log4Shell exploited in third-party software despite patches](https://www.govinfosecurity.com/microsoft-exchange-server-flaw-causes-spike-in-attacks-a-16236)\n\nbeing available since 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### China: Keeping vulnerability discoveries in the family\n\nAmong China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia — the China-based vulnerability researchers historically\nmost active countries conducting cyberespionage dominated global contests to exploit previously\nimpacting Secureworks customers — China stands unknown vulnerabilities.

In addition to the potential\n\nimpact on cybercrime from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are several other possible explanations for this\n\nseeming decrease in ransomware activity:\n\n###### • Ransomware groups seek to maximize their revenue and simultaneously avoid high-impact, high-profile\n\nintrusions that attract the attention of government and law enforcement agencies. The U.S. government’s\n\n[response in 2021 to high-profile attacks against Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya inflicted significant](https://www.zdnet.com/article/colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-shuts-down-pipeline-that-supplies-45-of-east-coasts-fuel/)\n\ncosts on the ransomware groups responsible. Law enforcement agencies around the world pursued these\n\nransomware groups as well as others, in some cases arresting individuals linked to malicious activity.\n\nTo avoid a similar fate, some ransomware groups proactively shuttered existing schemes and rebranded.\n\n###### • It is possible that ransomware groups are targeting lower-profile organizations that may not enlist external\n\n[incident response resources during an intrusion. This targeting could explain why third-party reporting shows](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-ransomware-revenue-down-as-victims-refuse-to-pay/)\n\nan overall reduction in ransomware payments in 2022. These organizations likely pay a lower ransom, if any.\n\n###### • Organizations could be implementing EDR solutions that identify ransomware precursor activity. \n\nThese solutions thwart follow-on ransomware deployment by detecting the Cobalt Strike adversarial\n\nframework and other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) common to many ransomware groups.\n\nHowever, predictions of the imminent demise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations failed to come true\n\nin 2022. The number of victims listed on ransomware leak sites monitored by CTU researchers did not significantly\n\ndecrease from 2021 to 2022, although there were monthly fluctuations (see Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n**FIGURE 4. Victims added to ransomware leak sites in 2021 and 2022. (Source: Secureworks)**\n\nCTU analysis of trends in the name-and-shame ransomware landscape revealed RaaS operations that continued\n\n[to impact a large number of victims. The financially motivated GOLD MYSTIC threat group published 920 victim](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-mystic)\n\nnames to its LockBit leak site in 2022, representing nearly 33% of the total number of victims posted across\n\nall ransomware leak sites during the year. In September alone, 228 LockBit victims were added. The increased\n\n[activity could be linked to an alleged GOLD MYSTIC representative’s claims that LockBit 3.0 included improved](https://www.redhotcyber.com/en/post/rhc-interviews-lockbit-3-0-the-main-thing-is-not-to-start-a-nuclear-war/)\n\nfeatures and an expanded infrastructure.\n\nOther prolific ransomware operations included ALPHV (also known as BlackCat), Conti, and Black Basta. In\n\nNovember, Secureworks investigated multiple intrusions where Qakbot malware led to Black Basta deployment.\n\n[The GOLD REBELLION threat group that operates Black Basta posted the first victim to its leak site in April. In the](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-rebellion)\n\nanalyzed incidents, data exfiltration and ransomware deployment occurred within 24 hours of initial access. CTU\n\nresearchers recommend that organizations review the TTPs from these incidents and verify that their security\n\ncontrols will mitigate these threats. In particular, network defenders should implement controls to detect and\n\nblock Qakbot.\n\n##### MFA not a ‘fire and forget’ security control\n\nMulti-factor authentication is one of the most effective ways to mitigate credential-based attacks and reduce the\n\nlikelihood of a network compromise. An increase in the number of organizations implementing MFA could be why\n\nSecureworks incident responders observed a decline in stolen credentials as an IAV in 2022. However, as more\n\n[organizations adopt MFA, threat actors are discovering innovative ways to bypass it or to focus their attention on](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/how-to-prevent-multi-factor-authentication-bypass)\n\nother IAVs.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2022, Secureworks IR engagements revealed BEC\n\nactors attempting to bypass MFA using various techniques.\n\nBEC actors have successfully bypassed MFA by sending\n\nauthentication requests that the victim approves without\n\nverifying. In MFA fatigue attacks, which may be increasing\n\n[in popularity, a threat actor repeatedly attempts to log in to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mfa-fatigue-hackers-new-favorite-tactic-in-high-profile-breaches/)\n\nthe same account using stolen credentials. This behavior\n\nsends multiple MFA push requests to the account owner’s\n\nmobile device, and the influx can lead to the account owner\n\napproving the authentication request.\n\nIn one incident, a threat actor obtained an organization’s\n\nOffice 365 usernames and passwords via phishing. The\n\nthreat actor then gained access to some accounts after\n\nsubjecting users to an MFA fatigue attack. The organization\n\ndetected this activity and quickly remediated the intrusion.\n\nThis incident highlights the importance of monitoring\n\naccess to key corporate resources even when fundamental\n\nsecurity controls such as MFA are in place. One way to\n\nmitigate the risk of MFA fatigue attacks is to implement MFA\n\nnotifications that require the user to enter a code rather\n\nthan choosing 'confirm' or 'approve.' Fortunately, many of\n\nthese attacks fail because the user appropriately denies the\n\nrequest or reports the incident to their organization.\n\nWhile this incident involved corporate devices, the\n\n[harvesting of corporate data from personal devices](https://securitybrief.asia/story/secureworks-ctu-identifies-increase-in-stolen-credential-sales)\n\nusing infostealers is a growing threat to organizations.\n\nPersonal devices often have weaker security controls than\n\ncorporate-owned devices and may contain corporate\n\ncredentials that could be used in MFA fatigue attacks or\n\nprovide an IAV into the corporate network. Threat actors\n\nhave also demonstrated MFA interception capabilities such\n\nas phishing campaigns that prompt a user to visit a website\n\nmasquerading as a legitimate corporate site and enter their\n\ncredentials and the second-factor code from their device.\n\n[Network defenders should consider implementing phishing-](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n\n[resistant MFA such as physical tokens to prevent this type](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n\nof attack.\n\n\n##### Threat actors updating tradecraft for cloud technologies\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift toward\n\nmanaged cloud-based solutions for many organizations.\n\nThese solutions were often implemented in haste and\n\nwithout full consideration of the security implications.\n\nOrganizations can benefit from the security controls offered\n\nby these cloud providers, but those controls need to be\n\nimplemented correctly. Secureworks incident responders\n\noften investigate intrusions where fundamental security\n\ncontrols were absent or misconfigured. Even when security\n\ncontrols are in place, cloud environments may still present\n\n[vulnerabilities that threat actors could leverage to gain a](https://www.secureworks.com/research/azure-active-directory-flaw-allowed-saml-persistence)\n\nfoothold.\n\nAs organizations transition to cloud-based services, threat\n\nactors are forced to develop new tradecraft to achieve\n\ntheir post-intrusion objectives. Secureworks incident\n\nresponders discovered a likely Chinese cyberespionage\n\ngroup pivoting from a compromised on-premises network\n\nto the organization’s Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant\n\nwhen the two systems were synchronizing accounts.\n\nThe threat actor gained initial access to the on-premises\n\nnetwork by exploiting the ProxyShell vulnerabilities on an\n\ninternet-facing Microsoft Exchange server. After accessing\n\n[the Azure AD tenant, the threat actor registered a single-](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps)\n\n[tenant application with Exchange Web Services (EWS) API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps)\n\npermissions that enabled them to access the organization’s\n\nmailboxes from Exchange Online.\n\nRegardless of whether an organization’s environment is\n\non-premises, cloud-based, or a hybrid solution, it is only\n\nas strong as its weakest link. This example reinforces the\n\nfundamental need for network defenders to mitigate risks\n\nbased on this changing attack surface. CTU researchers\n\nrecommend that network defenders understand what\n\ndata their logs are collecting from cloud environments\n\nand how the data is retained. Appropriate logging, ideally\n\nin a centralized and managed logging platform, provides\n\nvisibility into user activity in a cloud environment and across\n\nthe organization’s estate. Log data can reveal unusual\n\nactivity and provide insight into the scope and impact of an\n\nintrusion, which is essential for effective remediation.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Recommendations \n\n###### Following IR engagements, Secureworks provides granular recommendations about security\n\n controls that would have minimized the impact of the incident, advising the customers to\n\n prioritize these controls to avoid reoccurrence. Security controls that are often lacking in\n\n compromised environments include comprehensive deployment of an EDR solution; centralized\n\n log retention and analysis across host, network and cloud resources; and reputation-based web\n\n filtering and network detection for suspicious domains and IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion \n\n###### CTU researchers track threats and behaviors observed during IR engagements to develop\n\n an understanding of the nature and evolution of various threats. Through countermeasure\n\n development, periodic trend analysis, and ad-hoc tactical reporting on activity observed during\n\n IR engagements, CTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders continuously provide\n\n protection, insight, and guidance derived from real-world incidents to Secureworks customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### About Secureworks Incident Response\n\nThe Secureworks incident response team provides a wide range of expertise, cyber threat intelligence, and\n\npurpose-built technologies to help organizations prepare for and respond to cyber incidents successfully.\n\nSecureworks can assist organizations with onsite (subject to applicable pandemic travel restrictions) or\n\nremote Incident Commanders in support of an incident response.
