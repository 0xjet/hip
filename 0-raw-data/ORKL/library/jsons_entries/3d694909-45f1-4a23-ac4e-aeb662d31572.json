    "plain_text": "# The Price Cybercriminals Charge for Stolen Data\n\n**[trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/the-price-cybercriminals-charge-for-stolen-data](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/the-price-cybercriminals-charge-for-stolen-data)**\n\nLoading...\n\nBlogs & Stories\n\n## SpiderLabs Blog\n\nAttracting more than a half-million annual readers, this is the security community's go-to\ndestination for technical breakdowns of the latest threats, critical vulnerability disclosures\nand cutting-edge research.\n\nFor the price of a Starbuck’s Caramel Frappuccino Grande and a cheese Danish, about $8,\na cybercriminal can obtain all the information needed to max out a person’s stolen credit\ncard and possibly steal their identity.\n\nThis is just one example dredged from the Dark Web by the elite Trustwave SpiderLabs\nteam while it was conducting research for an exhaustive study into what cybercriminals\ncharge for stolen records.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe team found repositories of financial and identity records along with VPN and remote\ndesktop access credentials in various Darknet markets and uncovered a complicated\npricing structure that sees threat actors pricing their information in the same manner as any\nseller on a legitimate retail site. Prices vary depending upon the country from which the\ninformation was stolen and the quality and depth of the content associated with the\ncredential.\n\nSo, why are these records sold instead of used by the thieves? The answer is simple\nexpediency. Criminals opt to sell credit card and driver’s license information wholesale\ninstead to quickly cash out and to avoid the time and trouble required to use the assets.\n\nGenerally, threat actors’ activity is divided into business fields, someone is digging,\nattacking, and others are selling data or extracting user information and using it to obtain\nmoney. If the hacker or group does not know how to use the stolen information – they sell it.\nSpiderLabs found that in most cases, what is being sold on a forum was previously sold or\nused by a hacker. So, a buyer may not get first-hand hacked data.\n\nAnd these threat actors do cash out. For example, the FBI’s 2021 Internet Crime Report\nstated credit card fraud in the U.S. resulted in $172,998,385 in losses, and this only takes\ninto account reported incidents.\n\n### What’s For Sale on the Dark Web?\n\nThe better question is – what is not for sale on the Dark Web, but let’s focus on financial,\nidentification and access data.\n\nHere is a quick list of the items SpiderLabs found:\n\nCredit cards\nBank account information\nAccess to organizations through their VPNs and other means\nSocial Security numbers\nPassports\nDriver’s licenses\nAnd the ability to create the supporting documentation to prove these credentials\nbelong to the purchaser.\n\n\n**Item name** **Price**\n**range**\n**in**\n**USA**\n\n\n**Price**\n**range**\n**in EU**\n\n\n**Price**\n**range**\n**Asia**\n\n\n**Comments**\n\n\n-----\n\nCloned Cards and Fullz $50 $1500\nper\nitem\n\n\nsame same The price depends on how much\ncredit would be provided for the\ncard.\n\n\nCommon Credit Card,\nwith Fullz\n\n\n$8 $70\n\n\n$25 $70\n\n\n$50 $90\n\n\nThis is a price for one card, in most\ncases it comes with full info\n\n\nCC Track 1&2 $30 $140\n\nBank account access $100\n                   $3000\n\nStealer Logs selling $1 $100\n\n\n$50 $100\n\n\n$50 $120\n\n\nPrice depends on CC class:\nClassic\n\nGold\n\nPlatinum\n\nBusiness\n\nSignature\n\nPurchase\n\nCorporate\n\nWorld\n\n\nThe logs from stealer could contain\ntrash but could have your bank\nsession.

Depends on how many\ntimes info was extracted from logs,\ntarget.\n\n\nID, Passport, Driver’s\nlicense\n\n\n$1 $50\n\n\n$1 $50\n\n\n$1 $50\n\n\nThe quality or uniqueness of the\ndocument has high role here\n\n\nSelfie with your\ndocuments in hands\n\n\n$2 $10\n\n\n$2 $10\n\n\n$2 $10\n\n\nThe price could be higher if any\nspecific photo with the documents\nshould be taken\n\n\nEach item is subdivided by the type of card being offered. For example, a common credit\ncard with “Fullz” can cost between $8 and $70. Fullz means that for the posted price the\nbuyer is also given additional information on the victim. This can include name, address,\n\n\n-----\n\nSocial Security number, driver s license, bank account credentials, and medical records, all\nwrapped up in one package and all of which enables the buyer to better utilize the stolen\ncredential.\n\nTrustwave SpiderLabs found three “classes” of credit card for sale. Cloned cards with fullz,\ncommon credit card with fullz and different classes of credit cards, such as gold, platinum,\nbusiness, etc.\n\nCloned cards range in price from $50 to $1,500 with the cost depending upon the credit limit\nassigned to the card. The higher the limit, the pricier the card. Common cards, as previously\nnoted, run from $8 and $70, per card and generally comes with fullz. The price for the final\ntype varies slightly between regions, $30 to $140 in the U.S. and slightly less in the EU and\nAsia.\n\nHi guys! Call me Redseller94 Update 2022 LIST CREDIT CARD AND GIFT CARD\n\n***** CREDIT CARD USA (Best Seller) UNITED KINGDOM (Best Seller) AUSTRALIA\nCANADA FRANCE GERMANY CHILE TAIWAN SPAIN JAPAN ITALY BRAZIL\n\n***** GIFT CARD AMAZON (Best Seller) ITUNES (Best Seller) BESTBUY STARBUCK\nEBAY XBOX (Best Seller) WALMART TARGET\n\n***** DEAD FULLZ INFORMATION US/UK FULLZ RANDOM BANK US/UK FULLZ WITH\nALL BANK (CHASE, HSBC, BARCLAYS, etc…) VALID PASSPORT – DRIVER'S\nLICENSE – NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER – SSN – DOB UPDATED NEW YORK,\nCOLORADO, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, RHODE ISLAND, ILLINOIS (DRIVER'S LICENSE,\nSSN, DOB)\n\n***** DUMPS WITH PIN + CLONE CARD\n\n### Selling Fraudulent Supporting Documentation\n\nOne class of documentation for sale in these marketplaces shows how much thought\ncriminal actors will go to make their stolen data valuable.\n\nSome sites will create false documentation to help a buyer prove to a bank or financial\ninstitution that they are in fact the true owner of the credentials they purchased.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The advertisements for these credit cards are brazen and full of details._\n\nThe common verification flow has the person who bought the stolen bank needing to\nconfirm identity to the bank. So, the actor, to prove his identity, must provide a photo with\nhimself holding an ID, like a passport or driver’s license, along with the bank account\ninformation.\n\nTo provide such picture for verification, malicious attackers utilize the services of\nDrawer/Artist who can be found on a Dark Web market. The Dark Web artist creates the\nrequired ID using the photo a drop person. The drop person – is someone who will\nphysically go to the bank to get the money or use the document as proof for an online\nwithdrawal.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this form of identification is not the norm in many countries, it can work at a bank with\nlow security standards.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_This artist group developed used high-end tools to create a quality finished product. The_\n_artists can even add the required holograms and mimick watermarks on the identification_\n_documents._\n\n_Fake documents. With this approach, even modern verification video calls could be easily_\n_passed by introducing such printed IDs._\n\n### Bank Accounts\n\nBank account pricing, $100 to $3,000 per account, is directly tied to the amount of money\nthat can be accessed. The higher the amount that can be stolen, the more expensive the\npurchase. Additionally, the price correlates to how easy it is to access the bank account as\nsome banks might not be easier for a criminal to fool.\n\nThe seller usually mentions the balance on that account along with the victim’s physical\naddress. This can be done to hint at the target’s potential level of wealth, a toney address in\nLos Angeles or New York City might garner more interest from a buyer.\n\n\n-----\n\nTypically, those buying a bank account gain online access, the account and routing number,\nany debit card and PIN information available, the owner’s name and signature, phone\nnumber and billing address. The owner’s IP address along with the operating system used\nto access the account might also be included.\n\nWhile this information is generally used to digitally access an account, the criminal could go\nto the financial institution and use this information to simply withdraw the money in person.\nStealing the money in this manner is one way to defeat any multifactor authentication that\nmight protect the account, but it also opens up the possibility of the individual being caught\nand arrested.\n\n### Buying Virtual Private Network Credentials\n\nVPN access credentials were the most expensive records SpiderLabs found being\nadvertised. This is logical considering what a threat actor can do once inside an\norganization. Everything from stealing money, corporate espionage, IP theft, seeding\nmalware and planting ransomware are all on the table once access is gained.\n\nOur researchers found one ad asking $5,000 for access to a corporate network, while\nanother was priced at $2,500 for VPN credentials purportedly to a Korean company with an\nestimated $7 billion in revenue.\n\nAds for VPN access can offer a great deal of detail to help persuade a buyer. Sometimes\nthey mention the businesses industry but the price for the access is generally determined\nby the company’s revenue, as can be seen in this list of examples from the XSS forum.\nNote that the word ‘jealousy’ in the document is a bad translation for ‘revenue.’\n\n\n-----\n\n**_“Financial business, Taiwan. 627m of revenue. Palo Alto. 1500$_**\n\n**_Big business headquarters, manufacturing, finance, south korea. 7 billion jealous._**\n**_Pulse. 2500$_**\n\n**_Working with insurance, Argentina. 171m revenue.

There is Canada, bis on 20m. It's ok too. They are $200_**\n**_each.”_**\n\n_VPN access advertisements._\n\nFor this price, the seller provides administrator access to a server on the network. The\nability to access other machines on the network depends on local permissions and the way\nthe network is configured in that organization.\n\nIf a company has a solid cybersecurity defense in place even this level of access might not\nbe enough to do severe damage. The ability to use that access for malicious purposes will\nbe limited in environments that are fairly restricting, use network segmentation, and check\nfor anomalies etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nINFOGRAPHIC\n\n**How Much Is Your Identity Worth on the Dark Web?**\n\nThe dark web is the digital equivalent of the black market, and there's no limit to the\nsensitive, personal information available for purchase in the dark underworld of hackers.\n\n[Download Now](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/library/documents/how-much-is-your-identity-worth-on-the-dark-web/)\n\n\n-----",
