One of the primary means of\n\ndistributing malware is through using illegally \"cracked\" software, [1 ]which purports to be\n\ninnocuous third party software, that can be modified to surreptitiously install malware on a user's\n\ndevice, such as a computer. Users download such cracked software and install on their\n\ncomputers, thus infecting their computer with malware.\n\n2. CryptBot is a kind of malware that is commonly spread through the distribution of\n\ncracked software, as described above. The Defendants are engaged in the distribution of\n\nCryptBot malware designed to steal sensitive information from victims' computers, through\n\n1 \"Cracked software\" refers to software that has been modified without authorization from its owner, typically to\nundermine technical protection measures designed to prevent copying. The term \"cracked software\" in this\nComplaint refers to all maliciously modified software, including freely available software that is distributed by its\ndeveloper without technical protection measures.\n\n\n-----\n\nwebsites that distribute “cracked” software (“Malware Distribution Enterprise”). Defendants’\n\ncriminal scheme is perpetrated via a pay-per-install (“PPI”) network known as “360installer,”\n\nwhich fosters the creation of websites that offer illegally modified software (“Cracked Software\n\nSites”).[2] These websites offer software infected with CryptBot malware, such as maliciously\n\nmodified versions of Google Chrome and Google Earth Pro, and also cracked third party\n\nsoftware. The Malware Distribution Enterprise operated by Defendants in this case is one of the\n\nprimary means of spreading the CryptBot malware to new victims.\n\n3. CryptBot is malware often referred to as an “infostealer” because it is designed to\n\nsteal user information from victims’ computers such as social media account logins, website\n\nlogins, browser cookies, credit cards, and cryptocurrency wallets. Such information is uploaded\n\nto the CryptBot botnet command-and-control (“C2”) server, and then sold for use in malicious\n\ncomputer hacking campaigns with serious consequences for victims.[3]\n\n4. CryptBot is designed to target the users of certain Internet browsers including\n\nGoogle Chrome. Once executed, the CryptBot malware checks the infected computer for an\n\ninstallation of Google Chrome, and then attempts to locate, collect, and extract user credentials\n\nsaved to Google Chrome.\n\n5. Google brings this action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act (“RICO”), Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), Lanham Act, and New\n\nYork state common law against Defendants’ criminal enterprise to disrupt the Malware\n\nDistribution Enterprise and the CryptBot botnet, to prevent it from causing further harm to users,\n\nand to recover damages for the harm Google has already endured.\n\n2 Appendix A lists the domains associated with the Cracked Software Sites.\n3 Appendix B lists the domains associated with the CryptBot botnet’s command-and-control infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PARTIES**\n\n**Plaintiff**\n\n6. Plaintiff Google LLC (“Google”) is a Delaware limited liability company with its\n\nprincipal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.\n\n7. Google is a leading technology company that offers a wide variety of services to\n\norganize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Google strives to\n\nprovide its users worldwide with safe and secure platforms.\n\n8. Google operates numerous products, platforms, and services, three of which are\n\nrelevant here: (1) Google Chrome is Google’s free-to-use internet browsing application; (2)\n\nChrome Extensions are applications that can embed certain functionality into the Google Chrome\n\nbrowser; and (3) Google Earth Pro is a free-to-use tool that renders a three-dimensional\n\nrepresentation of Earth based on satellite imagery. Google owns and uses multiple trademarks in\n\ninterstate commerce in connection with Google Earth Pro and Google Chrome, including\n\nGOOGLE, GOOGLE EARTH PRO, the Google Earth Design ( ), GOOGLE CHROME,\n\nCHROME and the Chrome Design ( ) (collectively the “Google Marks”), among others.\n\n9. Google owns the following U.S. trademark registrations (among many others) for\n\nthe Google Marks for use in connection with computer services and operating and browsing\n\nsoftware, all of which are valid and subsisting on the Principal Register of the U.S. Patent and\n\nTrademark Office:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mark** **Reg. No.** **Reg Date** **First Use in U.S. Commerce**\n\n|GOOGLE 2,806,075 Jan. 20, 2004 Sept. 1, 1997 (Classes 38, 42)|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|4,035,756 Oct. 4, 2011 Sept. 1, 2008 (Classes 9, 42)||||\n|5,380,809 Jan. 16, 2018 Mar. 29, 2011 (Class 9)||||\n|GOOGLE CHROME 5,448,706 Apr. 17, 2018 Sept. 2, 2008 (Classes 9, 42)||||\n|CHROME 5,355,294 Dec. 12, 2017 Sept. 2, 2008 (Classes 9, 42) Dec. 7, 2010 (Class 35)||||\n||5,536,709|Aug. 7, 2018|Apr. 18, 2017 (Classes 9, 39, 42)|\n\n\n-----\n\n10. Pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1057(b), Google’s\n\nregistrations for the Google Marks constitute prima facie evidence of their validity and of\n\nGoogle’s exclusive right to use the marks in connection with the identified goods and services.\n\n11. Google has expended substantial time, money, and other resources in developing,\n\nadvertising, and promoting the Google Marks. The Google Marks have been the subject of\n\nsubstantial and continuous marketing and promotion by Google since as early as 1997.\n\n12. The Google Marks are distinctive and identify goods and services as originating\n\nfrom, endorsed by, or otherwise affiliated with Google.\n\n**Defendants**\n\n13. The defendants listed in paragraphs 14 through 17 are individuals who have\n\nconspired to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. They each have participated in the\n\noperation or management of the Malware Distribution Enterprise and have engaged in criminal\n\nacts causing harm to Google and countless others.\n\n14. Defendant Zubair Saeed is an individual who resides in Pakistan.\n\n15. Defendant Raheel Arshad is an individual who resides in Pakistan.\n\n16. Defendant Mohammad Rasheed Siddiqui is an individual who resides in Pakistan\n\n(Defendants Zubair Saeed, Raheel Arshad, and Mohammad Rasheed Siddiqui, collectively,\n\nreferred to as the “Malware Distribution Defendants”).\n\n17. Plaintiff does not know the true names and capacities of the operators of the\n\nCryptBot botnet (the “CryptBot Defendants”), and therefore sues these defendants by the\n\nfictitious names Does 1 through 15. Each of the Doe Defendants is responsible in some manner\n\nfor the conduct alleged, having agreed to become part of the Malware Distribution Enterprise in\n\nan effort to distribute CryptBot malware that forms the larger botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**\n\n18. This Court has federal question jurisdiction over Google’s claims under RICO,\n\nthe CFAA, and the Lanham Act. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law\n\nclaim under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. The state law claims asserted herein are intimately related to the\n\nRICO, CFAA, and Lanham Act claims, are built on the same factual predicates, and are part of\n\nthe same controversy.\n\n19. Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this district, and the exercise of\n\njurisdiction over Defendants is proper pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964 and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 301 and\n\n302 (McKinney 2022). Defendants have transacted business and engaged in tortious conduct in\n\nthe United States and in New York that gives rise in part to Google’s claims. Defendants have\n\nalso engaged in intentional, wrongful, illegal, and/or tortious acts, the effects of which\n\nDefendants knew and intended would be felt in the United States and New York. Defendants\n\nhave intentionally distributed maliciously modified software, leveraging infrastructure hosted in\n\nNew York, caused malware to be installed on victims’ machines in this district, in New York,\n\nand throughout the United States; have intentionally directed victims’ machines in this district, in\n\nNew York, and throughout the United States to participate in intentional, wrongful, illegal,\n\nand/or tortious acts. Defendants were aware of the effects in the United States and New York of\n\nthose acts; the activities of their co-conspirators and agents were to the benefit of Defendants;\n\nand their co-conspirators and agents were working at the direction, under the control, at the\n\nrequest, and/or on behalf of Defendants in committing those acts.\n\n20. Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c) because\n\nDefendants are not residents of the United States and may be sued in any judicial district. Venue\n\nis also proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and 18 U.S.C. § 1965 because a\n\nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Google’s claims occurred in this judicial\n\n\n-----\n\ndistrict, because part of the property that is the subject of Google’s claims is situated in this\n\njudicial district, because a substantial part of the harm caused by Defendants has occurred in this\n\njudicial district, and because Defendants transact their affairs in this judicial district. Defendants\n\navail themselves of the privilege of conducting business in New York, and utilize\n\ninstrumentalities located in this judicial district to carry out acts alleged herein.\n\n21. Defendants have affirmatively directed actions at New York and the Southern\n\nDistrict of New York by targeting their activities, including theft of funds and information, at\n\nindividual computer users located in the Southern District of New York. Defendants have\n\ndistributed maliciously modified software to and directed harmful computer code at the\n\ncomputers of individual users located in New York and the Southern District of New York.\n\n**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**\n**_Pay-Per-Install Networks_**\n\n22. “Pay-Per-Install” or “PPI” refers to a service designed to generate and direct\n\nInternet traffic so that users download and then install a particular file. PPI services offer the\n\nability to attract users to download a particular file or link provided by a customer. That\n\ncustomer is usually a developer seeking to find users to download and install a particular file.\n\nThe developer pays the PPI service for each user installation. A PPI service will often have a\n\nnetwork of different domain names and websites to generate and maintain a user base to whom\n\nthey target download links. Accordingly, a single PPI service may be associated with hundreds\n\nof seemingly unrelated websites.\n\n23. The ultimate value of a PPI service relies upon the developer’s ability to convert\n\ninstallations into revenue, since the developer has to pay the PPI service. When a developer\n\nwants to use a PPI service to promote the distribution of its software, the goal is to generate a\n\nprofit. In other words, a developer hires a PPI because it has devised a way to make money off\n\n\n-----\n\nthe cracked software installation. In some cases, the value of paying a fee to the PPI is tied the\n\ndeveloper’s ability to convert users from the free, demonstration (“demo”) version of the\n\nsoftware to the paid version. This is not the case when it comes to cracked software (since the\n\nentire point of cracked software is that it is “free”), which has a different revenue model. For\n\n“cracked” software distributed with PPIs, a developer’s revenue model is typically stealing\n\ninformation from the users that click the promoted installation files.\n\n24. For PPIs that advertise the free distribution of cracked software, the websites that\n\nare created to host the installation links typically advertise that they are cracked versions of\n\notherwise legitimate software. These websites are created by the PPI’s affiliates. PPI affiliates\n\ncreate or manage the websites the PPIs use to promote a developer’s installation links. On\n\ninformation and belief, malicious hackers use cracked software as a vehicle to distribute malware\n\nbecause users downloading such software are less likely to make a formal complaint or to\n\nexercise good cyber hygiene.\n\n25. Cracked software PPIs, which already operate outside of the law by distributing\n\ncracked software in violation of intellectual property laws, are aware that their sites are\n\nassociated with the distribution of malware and often use a wide collection of seemingly\n\nunrelated domain names and website addresses in order to obfuscate their illicit conduct.\n\n**_Distribution of “Cracked” Software as a Means for Spreading Malware_**\n\n26. Cracked software is typically downloaded by users looking for free versions of\n\npaid products, but malware is also often distributed in maliciously modified versions of software\n\nprograms that developers, including Google, make freely available to users. In some instances,\n\nthe cracked software retains all or most of the legitimate software’s functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n27. PPI networks that focus on the distribution of malware are aware that their paying\n\ndeveloper customers pay them from the proceeds of malicious computer hacking.[4] PPI networks\n\ndistribute their customers’ installation links through “affiliate” webpage developers. PPI\n\nnetworks pay their affiliates a fee for every installation their webpage generates.[5] PPIs pay this\n\nfee from their customers’ payment of the PPI service for the installations. PPIs have a network of\n\ndifferent affiliate websites they can use to promote their developers’ customer software.\n\n28. When a user downloads software, whether legitimate or maliciously modified,\n\nthey typically have to run an executable file that will either install the software from the\n\ndownloaded file itself or run an installer application that pulls in relevant install files from the\n\nInternet. Because users expect to run an executable file to install software, users typically do not\n\nrealize that the installer is installing malware, in addition to the desired software. And a user’s\n\nsubsequent attempt to uninstall the maliciously modified software would not remove any\n\nmalware deployed from the initial installation.\n\n29. When PPI networks are identified as sharing maliciously modified software, they\n\nare often the subject of complaints by the legitimate software developers who demand removal\n\nof the offending material. PPI networks that ignore these demands (and continue to advertise\n\ntheir services) have a reputation as providers who are willing to distribute digital contraband\n\nincluding malicious software. In such instances, and upon information and belief, the PPI\n\nnetworks and their customers are aware that the software they distribute is not provided or\n\nsanctioned by its legitimate owners, and that the customer responsible for that maliciously\n\n4 This Complaint recognizes that “hacking” is a term that can describe both malicious and non-malicious conduct\nand specifies that it is referring to malicious “hacking” that represents the unauthorized access of a computer system\nfor purposes of fraud or other malicious conduct.\n5 For example, the 360installer website discussed below advertises that it pays $2 per installation.\n\n\n-----\n\nmodified product must monetize installations in order to pay the PPI network’s per-installation\n\nfees.\n\n**_The CryptBot Botnet_**\n\n30. A “bot” (short for “robot”) is a computer or device that is infected by malware\n\nand that can be tasked to conduct specific activities. A “botnet” is a network of internet\nconnected devices (bots), each of which are infected by malware. The botnet is controlled by\n\n“command-and-control” (“C2”) servers, which can instruct the devices comprising the botnet to\n\nperform any number of disruptive or even criminal tasks. The C2 servers typically are controlled\n\nremotely by individual operators, referred to as “bot controllers.” While a botnet may operate\n\nthrough various pieces and iterations of malware used to access and control computers without\n\nauthorization, the term itself describes the resulting network of computers that can be controlled\n\nby a malicious actor or actors for one or more malicious purposes.\n\n31. A botnet can leverage its infected computers in many different ways, and different\n\nbotnets may have different foci. The CryptBot botnet specifically focuses on the theft of user\n\ninformation related to authentication, such as credentials, certain computer and browser\n\nidentifying information, cryptocurrency account information, and other personal information\n\nabout a computer’s user.\n\n32. CryptBot was initially identified in 2019, but made a resurgence in early 2022.\n\nWhile CryptBot has been known to be distributed through the use of phishing emails, the most\n\nrecent open source intelligence from various security analysts notes that one of CryptBot’s\n\nprimary distribution methods is through websites—such as the Cracked Software Sites—that\n\noffer links to cracked software.[6]\n\n6 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revamped-cryptbot-malware-spread-by-pirated-software-sites/\n\n\n-----\n\n33. CryptBot is coded, operated, and managed by the CryptBot Defendants. CryptBot\n\nleverages multiple distribution methods, but focuses heavily on distribution through cracked\n\nsoftware sites generally.\n\n34. CryptBot is designed to automatically identify and steal sensitive information\n\nfrom the computers it infects and then send the stolen data to C2 servers to be harvested and\n\neventually transferred or sold to hackers to use in connection with data breach campaigns.\n\nMalicious hackers who target large computer networks will usually incorporate the use of stolen\n\naccount credentials throughout the course of their hacking campaign. These can be used to gain\n\nan initial foothold into an organization’s network, or to help a threat actor move laterally within a\n\nbreached network once they are inside.\n\n35. CryptBot is designed to target the users of a number of specific Internet browsers,\n\nincluding Google Chrome. Once executed, the CryptBot malware checks the infected machine\n\nfor installation of Google Chrome, and then attempts to locate, collect, and extract user\n\ncredentials saved to Google Chrome. Additionally, CryptBot is coded to take screenshots and\n\nsteal data stored by users in Chrome Extensions. The CryptBot Defendants recently released an\n\nupdate to the CryptBot malware specifically designed to overcome certain limitations in its\n\nability to steal information associated with the latest version of Chrome, showing that the\n\nbotnet’s creators have and continue to specifically adapt the malware to target Google Chrome\n\nand its users.\n\n36. Today’s malicious hacker has online access to a myriad of tools and services to\n\nsupport their nefarious conduct. Typically, a malicious threat actor hacking an organization’s\n\nnetwork may use a large number of stolen credentials that are purchased from an online illicit\n\nmarketplace (“Stolen Credential Vendors”).\n\n\n-----\n\n37. Upon information and belief, credentials stolen by the CryptBot malware are\n\nprimarily monetized through the trafficking of such stolen credentials and other sensitive\n\ninformation (such as social security numbers and credit card information) through Stolen\n\nCredential Vendors.\n\n**_The Cracked Software Sites_**\n\n38. The Malware Distribution Enterprise leverages the “360installer” PPI service that\n\nmaintains approximately 161 active domains, each of which is associated with the Cracked\n\nSoftware Sites as part of its distribution network.\n\n39. The Malware Distribution Defendants work together to maintain and support the\n\nCracked Software Sites, which distribute cracked software in order to attract users to their\n\ncustomers’ (the CryptBot Defendants’) download links in return for payment from the CryptBot\n\nDefendants as set forth below.\n\n40. Specifically, the Malware Distribution Defendants operate the PPI business\n\nknown as 360installer as well as its associated bulletproof hosting service, “Offshoric.” As a part\n\nof their service model, the Malware Distribution Defendants incentivize the creation of cracked\n\nsoftware sites by paying their affiliates a fee for every installation that results from a download\n\nfrom that affiliate’s site. See Declaration of David J. Youssef (“FTI Decl.”) ¶¶ 6-12, 16-24.\n\nAccording to the Malware Distribution Defendants’ 360installer.com website, affiliates are paid\n\n$2 per installation. Id. ¶ 17.\n\n41. In order to pay this fee and also turn a profit, the Malware Distribution\n\nDefendants work with the CryptBot Defendants, who monetize the installations through the theft\n\nand eventual sale of sensitive, stolen information. This criminal activity funds 1) the sustaining\n\noperation of the Malware Distribution Defendants’ PPI service and its Cracked Software Sites;\n\n2) the promotion of the PPI service’s affiliates; and 3) creation of additional websites for\n\n\n-----\n\nmaliciously modified software, creating more opportunities for the CryptBot Defendants to\n\nspread CryptBot. Id. ¶¶ 57-59.\n\n42. The Malware Distribution Defendants and the CryptBot Defendants share and\n\njointly pursue the same goal: profit from the distribution of CryptBot malware through cracked\n\nsoftware installation files seeded with malware. The Malware Distribution Defendants maintain\n\nthe Cracked Software Sites, which use the allure of free and popular software, to sustain an\n\ninfrastructure that directs Internet traffic to download CryptBot, infecting more computers.\n\n43. Websites such as the Cracked Software Sites are subject to being taken down by\n\nlegal authorities or private parties pursuant to law enforcement activity, legal process, or cease\n\nand desist letters related to violations of intellectual property rights. Accordingly, many such\n\nwebsites are hosted by what are known in the hacking community as “bulletproof” hosters.\n\n“Bulletproof” hosters are web hosting services that turn a blind eye to illegal content and will\n\nignore or evade legitimate complaints or legal process to remove or take down the offending\n\ncontent.\n\n44. The Cracked Software Sites are hosted by a number of different web hosting\n\nproviders, but a majority of these sites are hosted by OffShoric, a “bulletproof” web hosting\n\nservice owned and operated by the Malware Distribution Enterprise. Id. ¶¶ 11, 16, 54.\n\n45. The “About Us” page on OffShoric’s website lists Defendants Saeed and Siddiqui\n\nas “Founders” of OffShoric, and has links under the “Trusted Clients” section to a number of\n\nCracked Software Sites that blatantly advertise cracked software.\n\n**_The Malware Distribution Enterprise Distributes Cracked Google Software and CryptBot_**\n\n46. The Malware Distribution Enterprise offers maliciously modified versions of\n\nGoogle software to its users.\n\n\n-----\n\n47. In a number of instances, the Malware Distribution Enterprise follows their usual\n\nmodel of soliciting affiliates to create webpages advertising cracked versions of software that\n\notherwise requires a licensing fee but ultimately delivers malware. In other instances, and in\n\nparticular with Google products that are otherwise free to users such as Google Earth Pro and\n\nGoogle Chrome, the Malware Distribution Enterprise uses installer packages bearing Google\n\ntrademarks to deliver malware. Analysis of these software packages reveals that they redirect\n\nusers to a series of hacker-related infrastructure that assess certain aspects of the computer (e.g.,\n\nits operating system and browser versions) to identify whether affiliate malware would be\n\neffective on the relevant machine. If so, malware is installed on the machine.\n\n48. Paragraphs 49 through 51 provide some examples of the Cracked Software Sites\n\nused by the Malware Distribution Enterprise to distribute CryptBot.\n\n49. “Mazterize.net” is a Cracked Software Site.\n\na. Below is a screen capture from Mazterize.net:\n\n\n-----\n\nb. “Mazterize.com” is a related site, using the “.com” top-level domain. Below is\n\na screen capture from “Mazterize.com”:\n\n50. “SadeemAPK” is a Cracked Software Site with the domain name sadeemapk.com.\n\nBelow is a screen capture from SadeemAPK.\n\n\n-----\n\n51. “CracksFiles” is a Cracked Software Site with the domain name cracksfiles.com.\n\nBelow is a screen capture of CracksFiles from February 2023. As recently as March 1, 2023, the\n\nlinks on the CracksFiles page have been removed.\n\n52. The Malware Distribution Enterprise is a major distribution arm for CryptBot. Of\n\nthe 161 domains associated with the Cracked Software Sites that were active on March 3, 2023\n\n(the “Active Domains”), approximately 90 are associated with the delivery of malware, and\n\napproximately 29 are confirmed to be associated with CryptBot. Additionally, the Cracked\n\nSoftware Sites include an additional 14 inactive domains that have historically been used by the\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware Distribution Enterprise to distribute CryptBot. All of the Cracked Software Sites listed\n\nin paragraphs 49 through 51 have been associated with the distribution of CryptBot malware.\n\n53. While a significant portion of the Active Domains were associated with CryptBot\n\nat the time of testing,[7] the domains associated with both the Cracked Software Sites and\n\nCryptBot C2 infrastructure change dynamically. CryptBot is known to be generally distributed\n\nthrough “phishing emails and cracked software,”[8] and has been described as “one of the most\n\nactively-changing malware with distribution pages constantly being distributed.”[9] Accordingly,\n\nat any given point in time, only a portion of the Cracked Software Sites are likely to include\n\ninstallation files that lead to the distribution of CryptBot. This allows both the Malware\n\nDistribution Defendants and the CryptBot Defendants to more effectively keep their distribution\n\npages online. As set forth above, CryptBot targets Google users’ information and Google\n\nproducts once it is installed on a machine, and CryptBot has been updated specifically in order to\n\nmake it more effective against later versions of Google software.\n\n**_Harm to Google, its Users, and the Public_**\n\n54. The Malware Distribution Enterprise harms Google, its users, and the public in\n\ntwo distinct, but related ways.\n\n55. First, the Malware Distribution Enterprise relies on attracting users that are\n\nwilling to click on links that the Cracked Software Sites promote. In doing so the Malware\n\nDistribution Enterprise harms the legitimate owners of such software, including Google (in the\n\ncase of Google Chrome and Google Earth Pro).\n\n7 See FTI Decl. - 39.\n8 https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/cryptbot-infostealer-malware-analysis/\n9 https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/31802/\n\n\n-----\n\n56. Monetization of the Cracked Software Sites by the Malware Distribution\n\nEnterprise ultimately relies on the malicious theft (and sale) of sensitive information, including\n\nuser credentials, to monetize both the operation of the CryptBot botnet as well as the Cracked\n\nSoftware Sites. As alleged in paragraph 34, although CryptBot is designed to steal information\n\nassociated with many different browsers and applications, it also specifically targets Google\n\nChrome users. Accordingly, the distribution of CryptBot harms not only Google Chrome users,\n\nbut tarnishes the product’s reputation as a secure browsing platform.\n\n57. The owners of infected devices are harmed in numerous ways, including through\n\nthe unauthorized access and criminal misuse of their device or information stolen from the same.\n\n58. Beyond Google and Google users, the continued proliferation of malware via the\n\nCracked Software Sites harms the Internet as a whole. Based on an assessment of web traffic\n\nassociated with the Cracked Software Sites connected to the distribution of CryptBot, these sites\n\nalone have led to approximately 672,220 CryptBot infections a year. FTI Decl. ¶ 63. Each\n\ninfection can lead to the theft of user information that is leveraged in malicious hacking.\n\n**CLAIMS FOR RELIEF**\n\n**CLAIM 1**\n**Violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §**\n**1962(c)–(d) as to all Defendants**\n\n59.

The Defendants are a group of persons associated together in fact for the common\n\npurpose of carrying out an ongoing criminal enterprise, as described in the foregoing paragraphs\n\nof this Complaint; namely, the Malware Distribution Enterprise, which distributes malware\n\nthrough the distribution of illegally cracked software via the Cracked Software Sites.\n\n**_Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Predicate Acts_**\n\n64. At all relevant times, the Defendants conducted or participated, directly or\n\nindirectly, in the conduct, management, or operation of the Malware Distribution Enterprise\n\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) and in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), with such conduct and activities affecting interstate and foreign\n\ncommerce.\n\n65. Defendants have directly or indirectly engaged in an unlawful pattern of\n\nracketeering activity involving thousands of RICO predicate offenses, including violations of the\n\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)), incorporated as a RICO predicate\n\nact under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(G) and 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B); wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §\n\n1343); identity fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1028); and access device fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1029).\n\n66. Google was injured in its business and property by reason of the Defendants’\n\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), as described herein. These injuries are a direct, proximate, and\n\nreasonably foreseeable result of these violations, and Google will continue to be harmed.\n\n67. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Google is entitled to recover treble damages plus\n\ncosts and attorneys’ fees from the Defendants.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants_**\n\n68. RICO provides, in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(G), that any act indictable under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B) constitutes a RICO predicate act. Among the acts that are indictable\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B) are violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)—a provision of\n\nthe CFAA—if such violation results in damage as defined in §1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(VI).\n\n69. The Defendants have violated and continue to violate the CFAA, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1030(a)(5)(A), resulting in damage as defined in Section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(VI), by knowingly\n\ncausing the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such\n\nconduct, intentionally causing damage without authorization to a protected computer.[10]\n\n70. As noted above in paragraph 58, the Cracked Software Sites connected to the\n\ndistribution of CryptBot have led to approximately 672,220 CryptBot infections a year. Each\n\ninstallation of a malicious installer package leading to the installation of CryptBot amounts to\n\nmultiple transmissions of code intended to cause damage without authorization to a protected\n\ncomputer.\n\n**_Wire Fraud Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants_**\n\n71. The Defendants, with intent to defraud and obtain money or property by means of\n\nfalse or fraudulent pretenses, commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 by transmitting\n\nor causing to be transmitted, by means of wire communication in interstate or foreign commerce,\n\nwritings, signs, and signals for the purpose of executing fraudulent schemes. Defendants have\n\nviolated and continue to violate the wire fraud statute.\n\n72. The Malware Distribution Enterprise commits wire fraud, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1343, each time that it tricks the owner of a device into unknowingly downloading\n\n10 A “protected computer” includes any computer “used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or\ncommunication.” 18 U.S.C § 1030 (e)(2).\n\n\n-----\n\nand installing CryptBot malware on the owner’s device through fraud, misrepresentation, and\n\ndeception, as alleged in paragraphs 38-45.\n\n73. As described in paragraphs 47 and 49, the Malware Distribution Enterprise\n\nleverages installer packages for Google Earth Pro and Google Chrome to install malware on\n\nunsuspecting users’ machines.\n\n74. Google has suffered injury to its business or property as a result of these\n\nfraudulent schemes.\n\n**_Identity Fraud Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants_**\n\n75. The Defendants, in furtherance of the Malware Distribution Enterprise, commit\n\nidentity fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7) by knowingly transferring, possessing, and\n\nusing, without lawful authority, means of identification of their victims with the intent to\n\ncommit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, unlawful activity in violation of state and federal\n\nlaw and affecting interstate commerce.\n\n76. Specifically, as alleged in paragraphs 34-37, the CryptBot Defendants target and\n\nsteal, among other things, users credentials, in order to traffic in such credentials for profit.\n\nAdditionally, as alleged in paragraphs 32-42, the CryptBot Defendants’ theft of such credentials\n\nis aided and abetted by the Malware Distribution Defendants, who help distribute the CryptBot\n\nmalware used to exfiltrate such sensitive information from victim users.\n\n77. Google has suffered injury to its business or property as a result of these actions.\n\n**_Access Device Fraud Predicate Offenses as to all Defendants_**\n\n78. The Defendants, knowingly and with intent to defraud, and in furtherance of the\n\nMalware Distribution Enterprise, committed and continue to commit access device fraud in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1029(a)(2)-(3), by trafficking in or using unauthorized access\n\ndevices in the form of stolen passwords, credentials, and other account information in order to\n\n\n-----\n\nobtain anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during a one-year period, and/or possessing\n\nfifteen or more unauthorized access devices, and affecting interstate or foreign commerce. As\n\npreviously mentioned, FTI estimates that the Malware Distribution Enterprise is associated with\n\napproximately 672,220 infections annually, and each infection is likely to lead to the theft of\n\nsensitive information.[11] 360installer pays $2 per installation, so with over hundreds of thousands\n\nof infections, the affiliate payments alone are believed to be well in excess of $1,000 annually.\n\nThose affiliate payments are only a portion of the value of the stolen information. Accordingly,\n\nand upon information and belief, the stolen information at issue here exceeds $1,000 per year.\n\n79. Specifically, as alleged in paragraph 34-37, the CryptBot Defendants target and\n\nsteal “access devices” in the form of stolen credentials from Google Chrome users to traffic these\n\ncredentials for profit. Additionally, the CryptBot Defendants’ theft of such credentials is aided\n\nand abetted by the Malware Distribution Defendants, who help distribute the CryptBot malware\n\nused to exfiltrate such sensitive information from victim users.\n\n80. Google has suffered injury to its business or property as a result of these actions,\n\nwhich the Malware Distribution Enterprise uses to carry out its schemes.\n\n**_Conspiracy to Violate RICO as to all Defendants_**\n\n81. Google incorporates by reference each and every foregoing paragraph of the\n\nComplaint as if set forth in full.\n\n82. Defendants have not undertaken the practices described herein in isolation, but\n\nrather as part of a common scheme. In violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), each Defendant\n\nunlawfully, knowingly, and willfully agreed and conspired together with others to violate 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1962(c) as described above, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).\n\n11 This is extrapolated from a three-month period beginning December 1, 2022 to February 28, 2023, in which\n168,055 computers were infected.\n\n\n-----\n\n83. The Defendants knew that they were engaged in a conspiracy to commit multiple\n\npredicate offenses, and they knew that the predicate offenses were part of such racketeering\n\nactivity, and their participation and agreement was necessary to allow the commission of this\n\npattern of racketeering activity. This conduct constitutes a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1962(c), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).\n\n84. The Malware Distribution Defendants and CryptBot Defendants agreed to\n\nparticipate in, directly or indirectly, the conduct, management, or operation of the Malware\n\nDistribution Enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1962(c). Each Defendant knew about and agreed to facilitate the Malware Distribution\n\nEnterprise’s schemes. The purpose of the conspiracy was to commit a pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity in the conduct of the affairs of the Malware Distribution Enterprise, including the acts of\n\nracketeering set forth above, specifically, violation of the CFAA, wire fraud, identity fraud, and\n\naccess device fraud.\n\n85. Google has been and continues to be directly injured by Defendants’ conduct.\n\nDefendants’ conduct undermined the security and reputation of Google’s products and services.\n\n86. Google seeks injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages in an\n\namount to be proven at trial.\n\n87. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Google has suffered and continues to\n\nsuffer irreparable harm for which there is not adequate remedy at law, and which will continue\n\nunless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.\n\n**CLAIM 2**\n**Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 as to all Defendants**\n\n88. Google incorporates by reference each and every foregoing paragraph of the\n\nComplaint as if set forth in full.\n\n\n-----\n\n89. As alleged in paragraphs 34-37, Defendants knowingly and with intent to defraud,\n\ntrafficked and continue to continue to traffic in passwords and/or similar information through\n\nwhich computers may be accessed without authorization. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(6)(A).\n\n90. Defendants’ conduct involved and affected, and continue to involve and affect,\n\ninterstate and/or foreign communications and commerce, including involving protected\n\ncomputers located inside the United States as well as protected computers located outside the\n\nUnited States that are used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or\n\ncommunication of the United States.\n\n91. Defendants’ conduct has caused damage to Google, including by impairing the\n\nintegrity of products being offered to its users.\n\n92. Defendants’ conduct has caused a loss to Google during a one-year period\n\naggregating at least $5,000.\n\n93. Google seeks injunctive relief and compensatory damages under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1030(g) in an amount to be proven at trial.\n\n94. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Google has suffered and continues to\n\nsuffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and which will continue\n\nunless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.\n\n**CLAIM 3**\n**Trademark Infringement and Counterfeiting in Violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §**\n**1114 as to all Defendants**\n\n95. Google incorporates by reference each and every foregoing paragraph of the\n\nComplaint as if set forth in full.\n\n96. Defendants use reproductions, counterfeits, copies, or colorable imitations of the\n\nGoogle Marks in interstate commerce in connection with the Malware Distribution Enterprise.\n\n97. Google has not licensed or authorized Defendants to use the Google Marks.\n\n\n-----\n\n98. Defendants’ unauthorized use of the Google Marks is likely to cause confusion\n\nand mistake among consumers as to the source, origin, or sponsorship of the maliciously\n\nmodified Google software made available through the Malware Distribution Enterprise.\n\n99. Defendants’ unauthorized use of the Google Marks is also likely to cause\n\nconfusion and mistake among consumers as to the source, origin, or sponsorship of CryptBot\n\nitself, if and when affected users are alerted to the malware on their computers.\n\n100. Defendants unauthorized use or imitation of the Google Marks is a knowing,\n\nwillful, and intentional violation of Google’s rights.\n\n101. Defendants’ activities constitute willful trademark infringement and\n\ncounterfeiting in violation of Sections 32 and 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114 and\n\n1117.\n\n102. Defendants’ infringement diminishes the value of the Google Marks and damages\n\nGoogle’s goodwill and business reputation.\n\n103. The injuries sustained by Google have been the direct and proximate result of\n\nDefendants’ wrongful reproduction, counterfeiting, and use of the Google Marks.\n\n104. By reason of the foregoing, Google is entitled to recover actual damages or\n\nDefendants’ profits, including treble damages pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1117(b), statutory\n\ndamages pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1117(c), as well as costs, attorneys’ fees under the Lanham Act.\n\n105. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Google has also suffered irreparable\n\nharm for which no adequate remedy at law exists, which will continue unless Defendants’\n\nactivities are not restrained.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CLAIM 4**\n**False Designation of Origin in Violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), as to all**\n\n**Defendants**\n\n106. Google incorporates by reference each and every foregoing paragraph of the\n\nComplaint as if set forth in full.\n\n107. Google owns and uses the Google Marks in connection with its offering of\n\nsoftware, among other things.\n\n108. Defendants use reproductions, counterfeits, copies, or colorable imitations of the\n\nGoogle Marks in interstate commerce in connection with the Malware Distribution Enterprise.\n\n109. Google has not licensed or authorized Defendants to use the Google Marks.\n\n110. Defendants’ unauthorized use of the Google Marks is likely to cause confusion\n\nand mistake, as well as to deceive consumers, as to the origin, sponsorship, or affiliation of the\n\ncracked software and CryptBot.\n\n111. Defendants unauthorized use or imitation of the Google Marks is a knowing,\n\nwillful, and intentional violation of Google’s rights.\n\n112. Defendant’s use of the Google Marks constitutes false designation of origin in\n\nviolation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).\n\n113. Defendants’ infringement diminishes the value of the Google Marks and damages\n\nGoogle’s goodwill and business reputation.\n\n114. The injuries sustained by Google have been the direct and proximate result of\n\nDefendants’ use of the Google Marks, including counterfeits of the same, in order to falsely\n\nrepresent the origin and sponsorship of the maliciously modified software and CryptBot.\n\n115. Google is entitled to recover actual damages or Defendants’ profits, including\n\ntreble damages pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1117(b), as well as costs, attorneys’ fees, and other\n\nstatutory damages under the Lanham Act.\n\n\n-----\n\n116. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Google has also suffered irreparable\n\nharm for which no adequate remedy at law exists, which will continue unless Defendants’\n\nactivities are not restrained.\n\n**CLAIM 5**\n**Tortious Interference with Business Relationship as to all Defendants**\n\n117. Google incorporates by reference each and every foregoing paragraph of the\n\nComplaint as if set forth in full.\n\n118. Defendants knew or should have known that Google had an actual and continuing\n\nbusiness relationship with numerous users who interact with Google’s systems and use its\n\nproducts.\n\n119. In violation of the common law of New York, Defendants intentionally and\n\nmaliciously interfered with Google’s business relationships with its users by distributing\n\nmaliciously modified versions of Google software and targeting Google Chrome and Google\n\nEarth Pro users for the installation of malicious software. Defendants’ actions were dishonest,\n\nunfair, and improper.\n\n120. Defendants’ improper actions were the proximate cause of harm to Google and\n\nresulted in injury to Google’s relationship with its users.\n\n121. Google seeks injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages in an\n\namount to be proven at trial.\n\n122. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Google has suffered and continues to\n\nsuffer irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law exists, and which will continue\n\nunless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.\n\n**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**\n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs prays for judgment as set forth below:\n\n\n-----\n\nA.
