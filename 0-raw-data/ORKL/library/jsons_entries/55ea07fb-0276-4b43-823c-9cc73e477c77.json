These maldocs ultimately led to the delivery of Cobalt Strike beacons on\ninfected endpoints.\nWe have observed the same threat actor using the Cobalt Strike beacon and implants\nfrom the Manjusaka framework.\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nCisco Talos has discovered a relatively new attack framework called \"Manjusaka\" (which can\nbe translated to \"cow flower\" from the Simplified Chinese writing) by their authors, being\nused in the wild.\n\n[As defenders, it is important to keep track of offensive frameworks such as Cobalt Strike and](https://talos-intelligence-site.s3.amazonaws.com/production/document_files/files/000/095/031/original/Talos_Cobalt_Strike.pdf)\nSliver so that enterprises can effectively defend against attacks employing these tools.\nAlthough we haven't observed widespread usage of this framework in the wild, it has the\npotential to be adopted by threat actors all over the world. This disclosure from Talos intends\nto provide early notification of the usage of Manjusaka. We also detail the framework's\ncapabilities and the campaign that led to the discovery of this attack framework in the wild.\n\nThe research started with a malicious Microsoft Word document (maldoc) that contained a\nCobalt Strike (CS) beacon. The lure on this document mentioned a COVID-19 outbreak in\nGolmud City, one of the largest cities in the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous\nPrefecture, Qinghai Province. During the investigation, Cisco Talos found no direct link\nbetween the campaign and the framework developers, aside from the usage of the\nframework (which is freely available on GitHub). However, we could not find any data that\ncould support victimology definition. This is justifiable considering there's a low number of\nvictims, indicating the early stages of the campaign, further supported by the maldoc\nmetadata that indicates it was created in the second half of June 2022.\n\nWhile investigating the maldoc infection chain, we found an implant used to instrument\nManjusaka infections, contacting the same IP address as the CS beacon. This implant is\nwritten in the Rust programming language and we found samples for Windows and Linux\noperating systems. The Windows implant included test samples, which had non-internetroutable IP addresses as command and control (C2). Talos also discovered the Manjusaka\nC2 executable — a fully functional C2 ELF binary written in GoLang with a User Interface in\nSimplified Chinese — on GitHub. While analyzing the C2, we generated implants by\nspecifying our configurations. The developer advertises it has an adversary implant\n[framework similar to Cobalt Strike or](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/) [Sliver.](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver)\n\nThe developers have provided a design diagram of the Manjusaka framework illustrating the\ncommunications between the various components. A lot of these components haven't been\nimplemented in the C2 binary available for free. Therefore, it is likely that either:\n\nThe framework is actively under development with these capabilities coming soon OR\nThe developer intends to or is already providing these capabilities via a service/tool to\npurchase - and the C2 available for free is just a demo copy for evaluation.\n\n\n-----\n\nManjusaka design diagram.\n\n## Manjusaka attack framework\n\nThe malware implant is a RAT family called \"Manjusaka.\" The C2 is an ELF binary written in\nGoLang, while the implants are written in the Rust programming language, consisting of a\nvariety of capabilities that can be used to control the infected endpoint, including executing\narbitrary commands. We discovered EXE and ELF versions of the implant. Both sets of\nsamples catering to these platforms consist of almost the same set of RAT functionalities and\ncommunication mechanisms.\n\n### Communications\n\nThe sample makes HTTP requests to a fixed address\nhttp[:]//39[.]104[.]90[.]45/global/favicon.png that contains a fixed session cookie defined by\nthe sample rather than by the server. The session cookie in the HTTP requests is base64\n\n\n-----\n\nencoded and contains a compressed copy of binary data representing a combination of\nrandom bytes and system preliminary information used to fingerprint and register the infected\nendpoint with the C2. The image below shows the information used to generate such a\nsession cookie.\n\nThe information on the cookie is arranged as described in the table below before it is\ncompressed and encoded into base64.\n\nThe communication follows a regular pattern of communication, the implant will make a\nrequest to an URL which in this case is '/global/favicon.png', as seen in the image below.\n\nEven though the request is an HTTP GET, it sends two bytes that are 0x191a as data. The\nreply is always the same, consisting of five bytes 0x1a1a6e0429. This is the C2 standard\nreply, which does not correspond to any kind of action on the implant.\n\nIf the session cookie is not provided, the server will reply with a 302 code redirecting to\nhttp[:]//micsoft[.]com which is also redirected, this time with a 301, to\nhttp[:]//wwwmicsoft[.]com. At the time of publishing, the redirection seems like a trick to\n\n\n-----\n\ndistract researchers. Talos could not find any direct correlation between the domains and the\nauthors and/or operators of this C2.\n\n### Implant capabilities\n\nThe implant consists of a multitude of remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities that include\nsome standard functionality and a dedicated file management module.\n\nSwitch cases for handling various requests received by the C2.\n\n**Commands serviced by the RAT**\n\nThe implant can perform the following functions on the infected endpoint based on the\nrequest and accompanying data received from the C2 server:\n\nExecute arbitrary commands: The implant can run arbitrary commands on the system\nusing \"cmd.exe /c\".\n\n\n-----\n\nGet file information for a specified file: Creation and last write times, size, volume serial\nnumber and file index.\n\nGet information about the current network connections (TCP and UDP) established on\nthe system, including Local network addresses, remote addresses and owning Process\nIDs (PIDs).\n\nCollect browser credentials: Specifically for Chromium-based browsers using the\nquery: SELECT signon_realm, username_value, password_value FROM logins ;\nBrowsers targeted: Google Chrome, Chrome Beta, Microsoft Edge, 360 (Qihoo), QQ\nBrowser (Tencent), Opera, Brave and Vivaldi.\n\nCollect Wi-Fi SSID information, including passwords using the command: netsh wlan\nshow profile <WIFI_NAME> key=clear\n\n\n-----\n\n[Obtain Premiumsoft Navicat credentials: Navicat is a graphical database management](https://www.navicat.com/)\nutility that can connect to a variety of DB types such as MySQL, Mongo, Oracle,\nSQLite, PostgreSQL, etc. The implant enumerates through the installed software's\nregistry keys for each configured DB server and obtains the values representing the\nPort, UserName, Password (Pwd).\n\n\n-----\n\nTake screenshots of the current desktop.\n\nObtain comprehensive system information from the endpoint, including:\n\nSystem memory global information.\nProcessor power information.\nCurrent and critical temperature readings from WMI using \"SELECT * FROM\nMSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature\"\nInformation on the network interfaces connected to the system: Names\nProcess and System times: User time, exit time, creation time, kernel time.\nProcess module names.\nDisk and drive information: Volume serial number, name, root path name and disk\nfree space.\nNetwork account names, local groups.\nWindows build and major version numbers.\n\nActivate the file management module to carry out file-related activities.\n\n**File Management Capabilities**\n\nThe file management capabilities of the implant include:\n\nFile enumeration: List files in a specified location on disk. This is essentially the \"ls\"\ncommand.\nCreate directories on the file system.\n\n\n-----\n\nGet and set the current working directory.\nObtain the full path of a file.\nDelete files and remove directories on disk.\nMove files between two locations. Copy the file to a new location and delete the old\ncopy.\n\nCopy file operation done and part of the move.\n\nRead and write data to and from the file.\n\n### ELF variant\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ELF variant consists of pretty much the same set of functionalities as its Windows\ncounterpart. However, two key functionalities missing in the ELF variant are the ability to\ncollect credentials from Chromium-based browsers and harvest Wi-Fi login credentials.\n\nJust like the Windows version, the ELF variant also collects a variety of system-specific\ninformation from the endpoint:\n\nGlobal system information such as page size, clock tick count, current time, hostname,\nversion, release, machine ID, etc.\nSystem memory information from /proc/meminfo including cached memory size, free\nand total memory, swap memory sizes and Slab memory sizes.\nSystem uptime from /proc/uptime: System uptime and idle time of cores.\nOS identification information from /proc/os-release and lsb-release.\nKernel activity information from /proc/stat.\nCPU information from /proc/cpuinfo and\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq\nTemperature information from /sys/class/hwmon and\n/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp\nNetwork interfaces information and statistics from /sys/class/net.\nDevice mount and file system information. SCSI device information.\nAccount information from /etc/passwd and group lists of users.\n\nBoth versions contain functionally equivalent file management modules that are used\nexclusively for managing files and directories on the infected system.\n\nEXE vs ELF versions of the implant containing functionally equivalent file management\nmodules.\n\n### Command and control server\n\nDuring the course of our investigation, we discovered a copy of the C2 server binary for\nManjusaka hosted on GitHub at hxxps://github[.]com/YDHCUI/manjusaka.\n\nIt can monitor and administer an infected endpoint and can generate corresponding payloads\nfor Windows and Linux. The payloads generated are the Rust implants described earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The C2 server and admin panel are primarily built on the Gin Web Framework which is used](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)\nto administer and issue commands to the Rust-based implants/stagers.\n\nC2 server implant generation prompt.\n\nAfter filling in the several options, the operator presses the \"generate\" button. This fires a\nGET request to the C2 following the format below.\n\nhttp://<C2_IP_ADDRESS>:<Port>/agent?c=<C2_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>&t=\n<EXTENDED_URL_for_C2>&k=<ENCRYPTION_KEY>&w=true\n\nThe C2 server will then generate a configured Rust-based implant for the operator. The C2\nuses [packr to store the unconfigured Rust-based implant within the C2 binary consisting of a](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr)\nsingle packaged C2 binary that generates implants without any external dependencies.\n\nThe C2 will open a \"box\" — i.e., a virtual folder within the GoLang-based C2 binary — that\nconsists of a dummy Rust implant at location \"plugins/npc.exe\". This executable is a pre-built\nversion of the Rust implant that is then hot-patched by the C2 server based on the C2\ninformation entered by the operator via the Web UI.\n\nThe skeleton Rust implant contains placeholders for the C2 IP/domain and the extended\nURLs in the form of repeated special characters \"$\" and \"*\" respectively, 0x21 repetitions.\n\nE.g. The place holder for the C2 IP/Domain in the dummy implant is (hex):\n\n\n-----\n\n24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24\n24 24 24 24\n\nwhich is then replaced by the C2 with an IP address such as:\n\n33 39 2E 31 30 34 2E 39 30 2E 34 35 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24\n24 24 24 24\n\nThe hot-patched binary is then served to the operator to download in response to the HTTP\nGET request from earlier.\n\n## The campaign: Infection chain\n\nWe've also discovered a related campaign that consisted of a distribution of a maldoc to\ntargets leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons on the infected systems.\n\nThe infection chain involves the use of a maldoc masquerading as a report and advisory on\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in Golmud City, one of the largest cities in the Haixi Mongol and\nTibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province — specifically citing a case of COVID-19\nand the subsequent contact tracing of individuals.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaldoc lure masquerading as a report on a COVID-19 case in Golmud City.\n\n### Maldoc analysis\n\nThe maldoc contains a VBA macro that executes rundll32.exe and injects Metasploit\nshellcode (Stage 1) into the process to download and execute the next stage (Stage 2) in\nmemory.\n\nThe Stage 1 shellcode reached out to 39[.]104[.]90[.]45/2WYz.\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 1 shellcode downloading the next stage (Stage 2) from a remote location.\n\n### Stage 2 analysis\n\nThe next stage payload downloaded from the remote location is yet another shellcode that\nconsists of:\n\nXOR-encoded executable: Cobalt Strike.\nShellcode for decoding and reflectively loading the Cobalt Strike beacon into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode for decoding Stage 3 (Cobalt Strike beacon) in memory and executing it from the\nbeginning of the MZ.\n\n### Stage 3: Cobalt Strike beacon\n\nThe Cobalt Strike beacon decoded by the previous stage is then executed from the\nbeginning of the MZ file. The beacon can reflectively load itself into the memory of the\ncurrent process.\n\n\n-----\n\nBeacon calculating and calling into the address of the DLL export enables it to reflectively\nload into the current process.\n\nThe beacon's config is XOR encoded with the 0x4D single byte key. The configuration is:\n\nBeaconType -           HTTPS\n\nPort -              443\n\nSleepTime -            60000\n\nMaxGetSize -           1048576\n\nJitter -             0\n\nMaxDNS -             Not Found\n\nPublicKey ```\nb'0\\x81\\x9f0\\r\\x06\\t*\\x86H\\x86\\xf7\\r\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x05\\x00\\x03\\x81\\x8d\\x000\\x81\\x89\\x02\\\n\n```\nC2Server -          39[.]104[.]90[.]45,/IE9CompatViewList.xml\n\nUserAgent -            Not Found\n\nHttpPostUri -           /submit.php\n\nHttpGet_Metadata -        Not Found\n\nHttpPost_Metadata -        Not Found\n\nSpawnTo - b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\nPipeName -            Not Found\n\nDNS_Idle -            Not Found\n\nDNS_Sleep -            Not Found\n\nSSH_Host -            Not Found\n\nSSH_Port -            Not Found\n\n\n-----\n\nSSH_Username -          Not Found\nSSH_Password_Plaintext -     Not Found\n\nSSH_Password_Pubkey -       Not Found\n\nHttpGet_Verb -          GET\n\nHttpPost_Verb -          POST\n\nHttpPostChunk -          0\n\nSpawnto_x86 -           %windir%\\syswow64\\rundll32.exe\n\nSpawnto_x64 -           %windir%\\sysnative\\rundll32.exe\n\nCryptoScheme -          0\n\nProxy_Config -          Not Found\n\nProxy_User -           Not Found\n\nProxy_Password -         Not Found\n\nProxy_Behavior -         Use IE settings\n\nWatermark -            999999\n\nbStageCleanup -          False\n\nbCFGCaution -           False\n\nKillDate -            0\n\nbProcInject_StartRWX -      True\n\nbProcInject_UseRWX -       True\n\nbProcInject_MinAllocSize -    0\n\nProcInject_PrependAppend_x86 -  Empty\n\nProcInject_PrependAppend_x64 -  Empty\n\nProcInject_Execute -       CreateThread\n\nSetThreadContext\n\nCreateRemoteThread\n\nRtlCreateUserThread\n\nProcInject_AllocationMethod -   VirtualAllocEx\n\nbUsesCookies -          True\n\n## Attribution\n\nBefore even thinking about the attribution, it's important to distinguish between the developer\nof the malware and the campaign operators. The C2 binary is fully functional (although\nlimited in features), self contained and publicly available, which means that anyone could\nhave downloaded it and used it in the campaign we discovered.\n\nAs such, we have decided to list the data points that could be interpreted as a possible\nindicator and encourage the community to perform the analysis and add other data points\nthat might contribute to the attribution, either for the campaign or for the developers behind\nthe framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor this campaign, there isn t much to lead to formal attribution with any confidence, besides\nthe fact that the maldoc refers to a COVID-19 outbreak in Golmud City, offering a detailed\ntimeline of the outbreak.\n\nFor the developer of Manjusaka, we have several indicators:\n\nThe Rust-based implant does not use the standard crates.io library repository for the\ndependency resolving. Instead, it was manually configured by the developers to use\nthe mirror located at ustc[.]edu[.]cn, which stands for the University Science and\nTechnology of China.\n\nThe C2 menus and options are all written in Simplified Chinese.\n\nOur OSINT suggests that the author of this framework is located in the GuangDong\nregion of China.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe availability of the Manjusaka offensive framework is an indication of the popularity of\nwidely available offensive technologies with both crimeware and APT operators. This new\nattack framework contains all the features that one would expect from an implant, however, it\nis written in the most modern and portable programming languages. The developer of the\nframework can easily integrate new target platforms like MacOSX or more exotic flavors of\nLinux as the ones running on embedded devices. The fact that the developer made a fully\nfunctional version of the C2 available increases the chances of wider adoption of this\nframework by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations must be diligent against such easily available tools and frameworks that can\nbe misused by a variety of threat actors. In-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis\napproach can deliver the best results in the prevention. However, this should always be\ncomplemented by a good incident response plan which has been not only tested with\ntabletop exercises and reviewed and improved every time it's put to the test on real\nengagements.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
