The Operation Arid Viper is run by\nArab-speaking hackers that sought to extract sensitive documents by sending phishing\nemails. The [phishing campaigns targeted government office, infrastructure providers, a](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33313/cyber-crime/phishing-campaign-icloud-users.html)\nmilitary organization and academic institutions in Israel and Kuwait\n\nThe particularity of the Operation Arid Viper is represented by the tactic adopted by the\nattackers to lure victims. The malicious emails sent by hackers include a malware packaged\nwith a short pornographic video.\n\n_[“This month, actors of Operation Arid Viper and members of the Yanbian Gang jumped on](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33709/cyber-crime/yanbian-gang-mobile-banking.html)_\n_the sexually explicit content bandwagon, using them in separate attacks that target_\n_respective victims in Israel and Kuwait, and South Korea. Operation Arid Viper attacked five_\n_Israeli-based organizations in the government, transport, infrastructure, military, and_\n_academic industries, and one organization in Kuwait using spear-phishing emails that_\n_[dropped a pornographic video on a victim’s computer ” reported Trend Micro in a blog post](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/sexually-explicit-material-used-as-lures-in-cyber-attacks?linkId=12425812)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers exploit the fact that targeted individuals who might be receiving pornographic\nvideo at work and so would hesitate to report the incident, this circumstance allow the\nmalware to remain undetected.\n\n_“These victims’ failure to act on the threat could have then allowed the main malware to_\n_remain undiscovered.” states Trend Micro. “It targeted professionals who might be receiving_\n_very inappropriate content at work and so would hesitate to report the incident.“_\n\nThe malware used by Arid Viper once infected the victims’ PC searched for Microsoft Office\nfiles and text files. It reported the located files to the command and control server, which then\ndecided which files to exfiltrate from the machine.\n\nUnfortunately, researchers at Trend Micro reported that the command and control servers\nused by Arid Viper were “closely locked down, providing a very little hint that could aid our\ninvestigation.”\n\nThe researchers have found a few similarities between the Arid Viper campaign and\nthe Advtravel, including the control infrastructure and the attack kill chain.\n\nThe infection Chains for both Operation Arid Viper and Advtravel started with spear-phishing\nemails that came with a .RAR file attachment that automatically extracts an .SCR file that\ndrops two files when executed.\n\nThe Advtravel campaign infected more than 500 systems, the majority of them located in\nEgypt. The hackers were focused on grabbing screen images from victims’ computers, in an\nattempt to identify victims. Anyway, the experts at Trend Micro consider the operators behind\nthe Advtravel campaign much less skilled than Arid Viper.\n\n_“This could be a sign that they are looking for incriminating or compromising images for_\n_blackmail purposes,” Trend Micro reports. “As such, the attackers may be less-skilled_\n_hackers who are not after financial gain nor hacking for espionage purposes.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_“The first file is a pornographic video clip, which serves as a social engineering bait while the_\n_second file is the actual malware connecting to the C&C servers. Once the second-stage_\n_malware is in the system, it sets itself to autorun each time the systems reboot, even posing_\n_as an Internet communication software. “_\n\nThe researchers are spending a great effort in the investigation of the Arid Viper gang, in\nparticular on the way they organized the command and control infrastructure, they suspect a\nlink with possible threat actors to the Gaza Strip. They suggest the existence of a supraorganization behind both campaigns despite they presented different complexity of TTPs.\n\n_“Although the malware involved in operation Advtravel is different from that of Operation Arid_\n_Viper, both operations still have a few similarities, such as sharing the same server and_\n_having the domains used in Advtravel registered with the same emails as the Operation Arid_\n_Viper. Notably, the same server and site registration details suggest the existence of a supra-_\n_organization, a forum or an influential sponsor could be providing various hacking groups_\n_with the means to pursue their ends.”_\n\nLet me suggest you to read the report from Trend Micro titled “OPERATION ARID VIPER –\n_Bypassing the Iron Dome”_\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[(Security Affairs – Arid Viper, Advtravel )](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)**\n\n[AdvtravelAPTArid Vipercyber espionageHackingIsraelphishingsex](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/advtravel)\n\nShare On\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
