Straightaway the indications were that\nUroburos was not designed to target everyday users. Following the cyber attack on the\nBelgian Foreign Ministry, information has now been published concerning the affliction of a\ngovernment institution.\n\nOn Saturday Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders stated that \"information and\ndocuments on the crisis in Ukraine\" had been smuggled out of the government institution's\n[networks, reported Die Welt and other news media. At this time neither the origin nor the](http://www.welt.de/newsticker/news2/article127850537/Hacker-Angriff-auf-belgisches-Aussenministerium.html)\nnature of the attack had been clarified by official sources. However, Belgian financial\n[newspaper De Tijd named Moscow as the source of the attack shortly after, and](http://www.tijd.be/nieuws/politiek_economie_belgie/Moskou_hackt_Belgische_staat.9499843-3136.art) Le Soir was\nalso connecting it with Russia.\n\n## Today: infection by Uroburos rootkit confirmed\n\n\"The effort put in by the developers and contracting authorities behind Uroburos is only\njustifiable if the targets are worthwhile, i.e. for spying on major enterprises, national\ninstitutions, news services and similar targets,\" said G DATA experts in their [initial blog article](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2014/02/23968-uroburos-highly-complex-espionage-software-with-russian-roots)\non the subject.\n\n[Belgian daily newspaper De Standaard considers the source for their article today to be](http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140512_01103164)\ntrustworthy. It confirmed that the government institution had been infected with the spyware\nUroburos, which is also called \"Snake\" in some cases. Experts at the military intelligence\nservice are currently working on counter-measures and cleaning up the network, it said.\n[French newspaper Le Soir also reported the Uroburos attack on the Belgian government in](http://www.lesoir.be/542786/article/actualite/belgique/2014-05-13/logiciel-russe-snake-frappe-affaires-etrangeres)\ntoday's edition. The Belgian intelligence service is named as the source of the information.\n\n## Is this just the tip of the iceberg?\n\nEven though the level of detail of the information that has been publicly disclosed on this\ncyber attack is low, and may well remain so, there is nevertheless little doubt that the\nUroburos software has caused significant damage. The G DATA experts expect that the\n\n\n-----\n\nrecent development in Belgium is just the tip of the iceberg, all the more so since Le Soir\nreported last Saturday that other European countries had found the same problem.\n\n[Malware](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/malware)\n[Vulnerabilities](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/vuelnerabilities)\n[CyberCrime](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/cybercrime)\n\n\n-----",
