This is because disrupting or modifying a control process to cause a\npredictable effect is often quite difficult and can require a lot of time and resources. However,\nMandiant Threat Intelligence has observed simpler attacks, where actors with varying levels\nof skill and resources use common IT tools and techniques to gain access to and interact\nwith exposed OT systems.\n\nThe activity is typically not sophisticated and is normally not targeted against specific\norganizations. Rather, the compromises appear to be driven by threat actors who are\nmotivated to achieve ideological, egotistical, or financial objectives by taking advantage of an\nample supply of internet-connected OT systems. As the actors are not interested in causing\nspecific physical outcomes, they target whatever is available on the internet.\n\nMandiant has observed an increase in compromises of internet-accessible OT assets over\nthe past several years. In this blog post we discuss previously undisclosed compromises and\nplace them in context alongside publicly known incidents. Although none of these incidents\nhave appeared to significantly impact the physical world, their increasing frequency and\nrelative severity calls for analysis on their possible risks and implications.\n\nVisit our website to learn more about Mandiant’s OT security practice or contact us directly to\n[request Mandiant services or](https://www.fireeye.com/services/) [threat intelligence.](http://10.10.0.46/advantage/threat-intelligence)\n\n**Compromises of Internet-Exposed OT Are Increasing in Frequency**\n\nWhile Mandiant has monitored threat actors claiming to share or sell access to internetexposed OT systems since at least 2012, we have seen a significant increase in the\nfrequency and relative severity of incidents in the past few years. The most common activity\nwe observe involves actors trying to make money off exposed OT systems, but we also see\nactors simply sharing knowledge and expertise. More recently, we have observed more low\nsophistication threat activity leveraging broadly known tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs), and commodity tools to access, interact with, or gather information from internet\nexposed assets—something we had seen very little of in the past.\n\nThis low sophistication threat activity has impacted a variety of targets across different\nindustries, ranging from solar energy panels and water control systems, to building\nautomation systems (BAS) and home security systems in academic and private residences.\nWhile some critical infrastructure targets are very sensitive in nature, other targets present\nvery little risk.\n\nThe following timeline presents a selection of some public and previously undisclosed OT\ncompromises Mandiant observed between 2020 and early 2021. We note that, although it is\npossible many of these incidents involved process interaction, high confidence validation is\nnot feasible as most often the evidence is provided by the actor itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nSelection of notable low sophistication OT compromises: January 2020 to April 2021\n\n\nFigure 1: Selection of notable low sophistication OT compromises: January 2020 to April\n2021\n\n**Low Sophistication OT Threat Activity Can Take Many Forms**\n\nA consistent characteristic we observe among low sophisticated compromises is that actors\nmost often exploit unsecure remote access services, such as virtual network computing\n(VNC) connections, to remotely access the compromised control systems. Graphical user\ninterfaces (GUI), such as human machine interfaces (HMI), become the low-hanging fruit of\nprocess-oriented OT attacks as they provide a user-friendly representation of complex\nindustrial processes, which enables actors to modify control variables without prior\nknowledge of a process. In many cases, the actors showed evidence of compromised control\nprocesses via images of GUIs, IP addresses, system timestamps, and videos.\n\n_Low Sophistication Threat Actors Access HMIs and Manipulate Control Processes_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn March 2020, we analyzed a series of screenshots shared by a threat actor who claimed to\ncompromise dozens of control systems across North America, Western and Central Europe,\nand East Asia. Based on the timestamps from the images, the actor appeared to gain\nunauthorized access to these assets over a five-day period. The actor also shared a lowquality cell phone video showing their explicit interaction with a Dutch-language temperature\ncontrol system.\n\nWhile much of this type of activity appears opportunistic in nature, some may also be driven\nby political motivations. For example, we have seen hacktivist groups that frequently use\nanti-Israel/pro-Palestine rhetoric in social media posts share images indicating that they had\ncompromised OT assets in Israel, including a solar energy asset and the webserver of a\ndatalogger used for different applications such as mining exploration and dam surveillance\n(Figure 2).\n\n\nScreenshots of compromised web-interfaces supporting OT\n\n\nFigure 2: Screenshots of compromised web-interfaces supporting OT\n\n\n-----\n\nSome threat actors appear particularly eager to demonstrate their interaction with\ncompromised control systems. One threat actor shared multiple screen recordings making\narbitrary set point changes to compromised HMIs via remote connections from their own\ndesktop. While we suspect many of the victims compromised by this threat actor were smalland medium-sized businesses, on one occasion the group appeared to have successfully\naccessed the BAS of a hotel in Australia belonging to a major international hotel chain\n(Figure 3).\n\n\nScreenshots showing a possible compromise of a hotel BAS\n\n\nFigure 3: Screenshots showing a possible compromise of a hotel BAS\n_Some Amateur Actors Show Limited OT Expertise_\n\nSome of the actors we track made comments that indicated they had either a limited\nunderstanding of the OT assets they compromised or that they were simply attempting to\ngain notoriety. For example, one threat actor shared a screenshot of a purportedly\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised German-language rail control system. We conducted a reverse image search\nof the screenshot and identified the asset as the web interface for an ECoS 50210 command\nstation designed for model train sets (Figure 4).\n\n\n“Rail control system” that was really a web-interface for a model train set\n\n\nFigure 4: “Rail control system” that was really a web-interface for a model train set\nAnother group made a similar gaffe when they claimed to retaliate for an explosion at a\nmissile facility in Iran by compromising an Israeli “gas system.” A video of their operation\nshowed that they had actually compromised a kitchen ventilation system installed at a\nrestaurant in Ramat Hasharon, Israel (Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\nGas system that was really a kitchen ventilation system\n\n\nFigure 5: “Gas system” that was really a kitchen ventilation system\n_Low Sophistication OT Threat Activity is Supported by Hacktivist Tutorials_\n\nIn a few instances, actors operating as part of hacktivist collectives created and shared\ntutorials that instructed their affiliates and sympathetic parties on how to identify and\ncompromise internet-accessible OT assets. The tutorials typically described simple\nmethodologies, such as using VNC utilities to connect to IP addresses identified in Shodan\nor Censys searches for port 5900. These methods appear to have been used in some of the\nincidents we described, as some of the shared screenshots of compromised OT systems\nalso showed the actor’s web browser tabs displaying similar Shodan queries and remote\naccess tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nHacktivist tutorial describing how to access the HMI of an industrial gas and liquid\nburner\n\nFigure 6: Hacktivist tutorial describing how to access the HMI of an industrial gas and liquid\nburner\n\n**Low Sophistication OT Compromises Pose A Growing Risk**\n\nEach of the low sophistication incidents we observe is unique and poses a different level of\nrisk, which we normally determine by examining the actor’s previous work and reputation, the\ntarget’s industry, and the nature of the compromised process, among other things. While low\nsophistication incidents do not appear to commonly impact physical environments, they\nremain concerning for the following reasons.\n\nEach incident provides threat actors with opportunities to learn more about OT, such as\nthe underlying technology, physical processes, and operations. These opportunities\ncan increase an adversary's ability and enhance their tradecraft.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven low-sophistication intrusions into OT environments carry the risk of disruption to\nphysical processes, mainly in the case of industries or organizations with less mature\nsecurity practices. As the number of intrusions increase, so does the risk of process\ndisruption.\nThe publicity of these incidents normalizes cyber operations against OT and may\nencourage other threat actors to increasingly target or impact these systems. This is\nconsistent with the increase in OT activity by more resourced financially-motivated\ngroups and ransomware operators.\n\n**Security Best Practices and Situational Awareness Help Prevent Low Sophistication**\n**Compromises**\n\nDefense against low sophistication compromises is best addressed by implementing security\nbest practices and gaining situational awareness about the threat exposure of assets and\ndata. Implementing security controls to defend against this activity is also the foundation for\nmature security programs that seek to prevent and identify complex OT threats before they\nintroduce a risk to the safety of people and infrastructure.\n\nWhenever feasible, remove OT assets from public-facing networks. If remote access is\nrequired, deploy access controls and monitor traffic for unusual activity to minimize\nunintended interaction and safeguard asset information.\nApply common network-hardening techniques to remotely accessible and edge\ndevices, such as disabling unused services, changing default credentials, reviewing\nasset configurations, and creating whitelists for access.\nDetermine if relevant assets are discoverable using online scanners such as Shodan\nand Censys. Leverage support from knowledgeable security researchers to identify\nexposed assets and leaked information. Mandiant Threat Intelligence offers\nsubscription content, custom analysis, and black box assessments that help\norganizations identify internet-exposed assets and information.\nMaintain situational awareness on threat actors’ interest in cyber physical systems and\n[the development of OT exploits, with particular interest in attention driven to your](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/monitoring-ics-cyber-operation-tools-and-software-exploit-modules)\norganization, third party providers, or original equipment manufacturers (OEM).\nConfigure HMIs and other control system assets to enforce acceptable input ranges\nand prohibit hazardous variable states. Similar to web application security, automation\nprogrammers should treat all operator input as potentially malicious and gain security\nassurances by validating that the operator input is within acceptable thresholds.\n\nVisit our website to learn more about Mandiant’s OT security practice or contact us directly to\n[request Mandiant services or](https://www.fireeye.com/services/) [threat intelligence.](http://10.10.0.46/advantage/threat-intelligence)\n\n\n-----",
