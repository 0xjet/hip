Many researchers -](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/743345104333606912)\nincluding us - were unable to identify the malware so we decided to dig a bit further.\n\nIn this post, we will share our findings about this malware: its targets, technical analysis, the\nrelated attacks and the threat actor behind it.\n\n## Targets\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the first things we wanted to know is if this malware has a specific target–thanks to\n[researcher @benkow_ some open directories on the malware C&C were discovered. One of](https://twitter.com/benkow_)\nthe open directories contained logs of victim IPs and computer names:\n\nWhile there are not that many IP victims logged on this particular C&C, a look-up on ipintel.io\nshowed a concentration of victims from Germany and Austria:\n\nIncidentally, a quick dump of the malware code reveals the string “my_de” and “my_botnet”\nwhere the “de” in the first string may refer to Germany’s country code:\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to this and the results of our analysis below, we tagged this malware DELoader\n(detected as W32/DELoader.A!tr).\n\n## DELoader Analysis\n\nIn a nutshell, DELoader’s primary purpose is to load additional malware on the system. It\ndoes this by initially creating a suspended explorer.exe process:\n\nIt then proceeds to decrypt an embedded DLL from its body and inject it into explorer.exe:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe injected DLL then attempts to download a file from the link\nhxxp://remembermetoday4.asia/00/b.bin:\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon the time of analysis, the malware C&C was already sinkholed. Code-wise, the malware\nexpects to download a portable executable (PE) file as it validates the MZ header of the\ndownloaded file. If valid, this PE file is then copied to a newly allocated memory:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then searches for instance of a running explorer.exe process where it then injects the\ndownloaded file using CreateRemoteThread API:\n\n\n-----\n\nDELoader’s routine doesn’t tell much about its intentions since its payload simply installs an\nadditional PE file. This PE file could be any malware, or simply an updated copy of itself.\n\nEither way, it leads us to the next question – what is the motive behind DELoader?\n\n## Related Attacks\n\nThe registrant information of the malware C&C, resdomactivationa.asia, leads us to the\nnext clue:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe registrant details list someone named Aleksandr Sirofimov from Russia. Of course, we\ncertainly don’t know if Aleksandr is a real person, a stolen identity, an alias for a group, or the\n‘nom de guerre’ of an individual cybercriminal. However, the important thing is that these\nsame registrant details have been frequently used in the past to register malicious domains.\n\nBelow is an overview of some of the related attacks we were able to correlate using the\nemail address sir777alex@outlook.com:\n\nFrom the above graph we can extract the infection chain for DELoader, which is delivered\nthrough malicious JavaScript downloaders:\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the JavaScript downloaders come from ZIP files with “invoice” themes, it is more or\nless sent to victims as an attachment to malicious emails.\n\nFurthermore, the above correlation enabled us to identify that the actor (or actors), using the\nname “Aleksandr,” registered malicious domains as early as the 3 quarter of 2015, whilerd\nDELoader first surfaced by at least February of 2016.\n\nOne of the malicious tools “Aleksandr” used is a Zeus variation – an infamous banking\n[Trojan whose source code was leaked five years ago. Here is a graph of some of the related](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-zeus-source-code-leaked-now-what/)\nZeus variants out of the many Zeus C&C domains “Aleksandr” registered:\n\n\n-----\n\n[An online search of the domain goodvin77787.in leads us to this blog. The blog talks about](https://rebsnippets.blogspot.com.br/2015/11/dhl-themed-zeus-campaign-is-using.html)\na DHL-themed Zeus campaign targeting German-speaking users where all the related Zeus\nC&Cs were registered using “Aleksandr’s” details.\n\nSo we now know that person or persons behind “Aleksandr” have been (or are still) involved\nin a malicious campaign for stealing banking credentials. True to the nature of DELoader, the\nprevious campaign also targeted German-speaking users.\n\n## Are German-Speaking Users \"Aleksandr’s\" Only Target?\n\nAnother domain the individual or group known as “Aleksandr” registered is bestbrowser**2015.biz. This domain was used as a C&C server for Android Marcher variants – an**\nAndroid banking Trojan sold on Russian underground forums:\n\nInterestingly, these trojans were configured to steal credentials from Australian banks. Below\nis a code snippet from one of the Android Marcher samples:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is worth noting that these Marcher variants surfaced around the same time Aleksandr\nwas running Zeus campaigns in the 3 and 4 quarter of 2015. This suggests that he wasrd th\nrunning his malicious regional campaigns simultaneously.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile DELoader is a relatively new malware, the findings in this research demonstrate that\nthe threat actor behind it has actually been around for quite some time, and has left a\nsubstantial amount of fingerprints over the Internet.\n\nHistorical information shows that the individual or group using the name “Aleksandr” have\nbeen involved in bank information theft not only of German-speaking users, but have also\ntargeted Australian users. It is possible that DELoader may be used to aid in similar\npurposes in the future.\n\nWe are unable to confirm the legitimacy of “Aleksandr’s” registrant details, or if he (or they) is\nworking with a group. We may, however, have an idea on where “Aleksandr” is located.\n\nEarlier, we showed that the geolocations of DELoader victims were concentrated in Germany\nand Austria. You might have also noticed that one of the IPs deviated from that area – it\nresolved to Kiev,Ukraine:\n\nThis is odd since German is not a common language in Ukraine. So we theorized that this\nanomalous event may be due to someone testing the DELoader.\n\nTo test our theory, we looked up the IP in the C&C logs to find more information. Can you\nfind the interesting string in the IP’s computer name below?\n\n\n-----\n\nHigh five if you found “ALEXANDR”.\n\n-= FortiGuard Lion Team =\n_IOCs_\n\n_DELoader SHA-256 hashes (all detected as W32/DELoader.A!tr):_\n\n_72faed0bc66afe1f42bd7e75b7ea26e0596effac65f67c0ac367a84ec4858891_\n_5d759710686db2c5b81c7125aacf70e252de61ab360d95e46cee8a9011c5693f_\n_c16281c83378a597cbc4b01410f997e45b89c5d06efada8000ff79c3a24d63ca_\n_171693ab13668c6004a1e08b83c9877a55f150aaa6d8a624c3f8ffc712b22f0b_\n_5afee15a022fcdb12cc791dd02db0ec6beb2e9152b312b2251f2b8ecfe62e03c_\n_103c6f425cfcd5eb935136f8c4ce51b9556974545bc6b7947039405164d46b0d_\n_cec73c7b54c290b297a713e0eb07c7c2d822cc67ed61b9981256464273d63892_\n\n_Domains registered by sir777alex@outlook.com:_\n\n_yberprojects22017.info_\n_masterhost8981.asia_\n_nov15mailmarketing.in_\n_auspostresponse22.asia_\n_goodwinn8.asia_\n_mastehost12312.asia_\n_masterhost1333.asia_\n_marketingmas.in.net_\n_remembermetoday4.asia_\n_startupproject33676.asia_\n_bestbrowser-2015.biz_\n_marketing5050.asia_\n_marketingking878.asia_\n_yidckntbrmhuuhmq.com_\n_resdomactivationa.asia_\n_ukcompanymarketing.asia_\n_goodvin77787.in_\n_jajajakala8212.asia_\n_masterhost122133.asia_\n_masterj.in_\n_lalalababla.asia_\n_responder201922.asia_\n\n\n-----\n\n_cyberprojects2727.info_\n_super-sexy-girl2015.net_\n_jxsraxhlccokkrob.com_\n_mastehost88832.asia_\n_masterlin888.pw_\n_mamba777.in_\n_copolsox.us_\n_10cyberprojects2016.asia_\n_startupproject336.asia_\n_masterhost122133.asia_\n\n## Related Posts\n\nCopyright © 2022 Fortinet, Inc.
