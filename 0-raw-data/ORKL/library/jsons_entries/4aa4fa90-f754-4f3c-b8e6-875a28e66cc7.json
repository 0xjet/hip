Organizations should implement\nthese guidelines as appropriate to their unique\nenvironments, in accordance with their specific security\nneeds, and in compliance with applicable regulations. MSP\ncustomers should verify that the contractual arrangements with their provider include cybersecurity\nmeasures in line with their particular security requirements.\nThe guidance provided in this advisory is specifically tailored for both MSPs and their customers and\nis the result of a collaborative effort from the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSCUK), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS),\nthe New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the United States' Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) with contributions from industry members of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when\ninformation carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and\nprocedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed\nwithout restriction. For more information on the Traffic Light Protocol, see cisa.gov/tlp/.\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-131A\n\n(JCDC). Organizations should read this advisory in conjunction with NCSC-UK guidance on actions to\ntake when the cyber threat is heightened , CCCS guidance on Cyber Security Considerations for\nConsumers of Managed Services, and CISA guidance provided on the Shields Up and Shields Up\nTechnical Guidance webpages.\n\nManaged Service Providers\nThis advisory defines MSPs as entities that deliver, operate, or manage ICT services and functions\nfor their customers via a contractual arrangement, such as a service level agreement. In addition to\noffering their own services, an MSP may offer services in conjunction with those of other providers.\nOfferings may include platform, software, and IT infrastructure services; business process and\nsupport functions; and cybersecurity services. MSPs typically manage these services and functions in\ntheir customer's network environment—either on the customer's premises or hosted in the MSP's\ndata center. Note: this advisory does not address guidance on cloud service providers (CSPs)—\nproviders who handle the ICT needs of their customers via cloud services such as Software-as-aService, Platform-as-a-Service, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service; however, MSPs may offer these\nservices as well. (See Appendix for additional definitions.)\nMSPs provide services that usually require both trusted network connectivity and privileged access to\nand from customer systems. Many organizations—ranging from large critical infrastructure\norganizations to small- and mid-sized businesses—use MSPs to manage ICT systems, store data, or\nsupport sensitive processes. Many organizations make use of MSPs to scale and support network\nenvironments and processes without expanding their internal staff or having to develop the\ncapabilities internally.\n\nThreat Actors Targeting MSP Access to Customer Networks\nWhether the customer's network environment is on premises or externally hosted, threat actors can\nuse a vulnerable MSP as an initial access vector to multiple victim networks, with globally cascading\neffects. The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities expect\nmalicious cyber actors—including state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups—to step\nup their targeting of MSPs in their efforts to exploit provider-customer network trust relationships. For\nexample, threat actors successfully compromising an MSP could enable follow-on activity—such as\nransomware and cyber espionage—against the MSP as well as across the MSP's customer base.\nThe UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities have previously\nissued general guidance for MSPs and their customers.[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8] This advisory provides\nspecific guidance to enable transparent, well-informed discussions between MSPs and their\ncustomers that center on securing sensitive information and data. These discussions should result in\na re-evaluation of security processes and contractual commitments to accommodate customer risk\ntolerance. A shared commitment to security will reduce risk for both MSPs and their customers, as\nwell as the global ICT community.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nMSPs and their Customers\nThe UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities recommend MSPs\nand their customers implement the baseline security measures and operational controls listed in this\nPage 2 of 3 | Product ID: AA22-131A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-131A\n\nsection. Additionally, customers should ensure their contractual arrangements specify that their MSP\nimplements these measures and controls.\n\nPrevent initial compromise.\n\nIn their efforts to compromise MSPs, malicious cyber actors exploit vulnerable devices and internetfacing services, conduct brute force attacks, and use phishing techniques. MSPs and their customers\nshould ensure they are mitigating these attack methods. Useful mitigation resources on initial\ncompromise attack methods are listed below:\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nImprove security of vulnerable devices.\no Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions (CISA, NSA)\no Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Services (NCSC-UK)\nProtect internet-facing services.\no Protecting internet-facing services on public service Critical National Infrastructure\n(CNI) (NCSC-UK)\no Strategies for protecting web application systems against credential stuffing attacks\n(CCCS)\nDefend against brute force and password spraying.\no Microsoft update on brute force and password spraying activity (NCSC-UK)\no Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise\nand Cloud Environments (NSA, CISA, FBI, NCSC-UK)\nDefend against phishing.\no Phishing attacks: defending your organisation (NCSC-UK)\no Spotting malicious email messages (CCCS)\n\nEnable/improve monitoring and logging processes.\n\nIt can be months before incidents are detected, so UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S.\ncybersecurity authorities recommend all organizations store their most important logs for at least six\nmonths. Whether through a comprehensive security information and event management (SIEM)\nsolution or discrete logging tools, implement and maintain a segregated logging regime to detect\nthreats to networks. Organizations can refer to the following NCSC-UK guidance on the appropriate\ndata to collect for security purposes and when to use it: What exactly should we be logging?.\nAdditionally, all organizations—whether through contractual arrangements with an MSP or on their\nown—should implement endpoint detection and network defense monitoring capabilities in addition to\nusing application allowlisting/denylisting.\n•\n\n•\n\nMSPs should log the delivery infrastructure activities used to provide services to the customer.\nMSPs should also log both internal and customer network activity, as appropriate and\ncontractually agreed upon.\nCustomers should enable effective monitoring and logging of their systems. If customers\nchoose to engage an MSP to perform monitoring and logging, they should ensure that their\ncontractual arrangements require their MSP to:\no Implement comprehensive security event management that enables appropriate\nmonitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems;\no Provide visibility—as specified in the contractual arrangement—to customers of\nlogging activities, including provider's presence, activities, and connections to the\n\nPage 3 of 4 | Product ID: AA22-131A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-131A\n\no\n\ncustomer networks (Note: customers should ensure that MSP accounts are properly\nmonitored and audited.); and\nNotify customer of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on\nthe provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks, and send these to a security\noperations center (SOC) for analysis and triage.\n\nEnforce multifactor authentication (MFA).\n\nOrganizations should secure remote access applications and enforce MFA where possible to harden\nthe infrastructure that enables access to networks and systems.[9],[10] Note: Russian statesponsored APT actors have recently demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA protocols;\norganizations should review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment\nscenarios.[11]\n•\n\n•\n\nMSPs should recommend the adoption of MFA across all customer services and products.\nNote: MSPs should also implement MFA on all accounts that have access to customer\nenvironments and should treat those accounts as privileged.\nCustomers should ensure that their contractual arrangements mandate the use of MFA on\nthe services and products they receive. Contracts should also require MFA to be enforced on\nall MSP accounts used to access customer environments.\n\nManage internal architecture risks and segregate internal networks.\n\nOrganizations should understand their environment and segregate their networks. Identify, group, and\nisolate critical business systems and apply appropriate network security controls to them to reduce\nthe impact of a compromise across the organization.[12],[13]\n•\n\nMSPs should review and verify all connections between internal systems, customer systems,\nand other networks. Segregate customer data sets (and services, where applicable) from each\nother—as well as from internal company networks—to limit the impact of a single vector of\nattack. Do not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.\n\n• Customers should review and verify all connections between internal systems, MSP systems,\nand other networks. Ensure management of identity providers and trusts between the different\nenvironments. Use a dedicated virtual private network (VPN) or alternative secure access\nmethod, to connect to MSP infrastructure and limit all network traffic to and from the MSP to\nthat dedicated secure connection. Verify that the networks used for trust relationships with\nMSPs are suitably segregated from the rest of their networks. Ensure contractual agreements\nspecify that MSPs will not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.\n\nApply the principle of least privilege.\n\nOrganizations should apply the principle of least privilege throughout their network environment and\nimmediate update privileges upon changes in administrative roles. Use a tiering model for\nadministrative accounts so that these accounts do not have any unnecessary access or privileges.\nOnly use accounts with full privileges across an enterprise when strictly necessary and consider the\nuse of time-based privileges to further restrict their use. Identify high-risk devices, services and users\nto minimize their accesses.[14]\n•\n\nMSPs should apply this principle to both internal and customer environments, avoiding default\nadministrative privileges.\n\nPage 4 of 5 | Product ID: AA22-131A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-131A\n\n•\n\nCustomers should ensure that their MSP applies this principle to both provider and customer\nnetwork environments. Note: customers with contractual arrangements that provide them with\nadministration of MSP accounts within their environment should ensure that the MSP\naccounts only have access to the services/resources being managed by the MSP.\n\nDeprecate obsolete accounts and infrastructure.\n\nBoth MSPs and customers should periodically review their internet attack surface and take steps to\nlimit it, such as disabling user accounts when personnel transition.[15] (Note: although sharing\naccounts is not recommended, should an organization require this, passwords to shared account\nshould be reset when personnel transition.) Organizations should also audit their network\ninfrastructure—paying particular attention to those on the MSP-customer boundary—to identify and\ndisable unused systems and services. Port scanning tools and automated system inventories can\nassist organizations in confirming the roles and responsibilities of systems.\n•\n\nCustomers should be sure to disable MSP accounts that are no longer managing\ninfrastructure. Note: disabling MSP accounts can be overlooked when a contract terminates.\n\nApply updates.\n\nOrganizations should update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware.\nPrioritize applying security updates to software containing known exploited vulnerabilities. Note:\norganizations should prioritize patching vulnerabilities included in CISA’s catalogue of known\nexploited vulnerabilities (KEV) as opposed to only those with high Common Vulnerability Scoring\nSystem (CVSS) scores that have not been exploited and may never be exploited.[16],[17],[18],[19]\n•\n•\n\nMSPs should implement updates on internal networks as quickly as possible.\nCustomers should ensure that they understand their MSP's policy on software updates and\nrequest that comprehensive and timely updates are delivered as an ongoing service.\n\nBackup systems and data.\n\nOrganizations should regularly update and test backups—including “gold images” of critical systems\nin the event these need to be rebuilt (Note: organizations should base the frequency of backups on\ntheir recovery point objective [20]). Store backups separately and isolate them from network\nconnections that could enable the spread of ransomware; many ransomware variants attempt to find\nand encrypt/delete accessible backups. Isolating backups enables restoration of systems/data to their\nprevious state should they be encrypted with ransomware. Note: best practices include storing\nbackups separately, such as on external media.[21],[22],[23]\n•\n\n•\n\nMSPs should regularly backup internal data as well as customer data (where contractually\nappropriate) and maintain offline backups encrypted with separate, offline encryption keys.\nProviders should encourage customers to create secure, offsite backups and exercise\nrecovery capabilities.\nCustomers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include backup services that\nmeet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Specifically, customers should\nrequire their MSP to implement a backup solution that automatically and continuously backs\nup critical data and system configurations and store backups in an easily retrievable location,\ne.g., a cloud-based solution or a location that is air-gapped from the organizational network.\n\nPage 5 of 6 | Product ID: AA22-131A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-131A\n\nDevelop and exercise incident response and recovery plans.\n\nIncident response and recovery plans should include roles and responsibilities for all organizational\nstakeholders, including executives, technical leads, and procurement officers. Organizations should\nmaintain up-to-date hard copies of plans to ensure responders can access them should the network\nbe inaccessible (e.g., due to a ransomware attack).[24]\n•\n•\n\nMSPs should develop and regularly exercise internal incident response and recovery plans\nand encourage customers to do the same.\nCustomers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include incident response and\nrecovery plans that meet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Customers\nshould ensure these plans are tested at regular intervals.\n\nUnderstand and proactively manage supply chain risk.\n\nAll organizations should proactively manage ICT supply chain risk across security, legal, and\nprocurement groups, using risk assessments to identify and prioritize the allocation of\nresources.[25],[26]\n•\n•\n\nMSPs should understand their own supply chain risk and manage the cascading risks it poses\nto customers.\nCustomers should understand the supply chain risk associated with their MSP, including risk\nassociated with third-party vendors or subcontractors. Customers should also set clear\nnetwork security expectations with their MSPs and understand the access their MSP has to\ntheir network and the data it houses. Each customer should ensure their contractual\narrangements meet their specific security requirements and that their contract specifies\nwhether the MSP or the customer owns specific responsibilities, such as hardening, detection,\nand incident response.[27]\n\nPromote transparency.\n\nBoth MSPs and their customers will benefit from contractual arrangements that clearly define\nresponsibilities.\n•\n\n•\n\nMSPs, when negotiating the terms of a contract with their customer, should provide clear\nexplanations of the services the customer is purchasing, services the customer is not\npurchasing, and all contingencies for incident response and recovery.\nCustomers should ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the security services\ntheir MSP is providing via the contractual arrangement and address any security\nrequirements that fall outside the scope of the contract. Note: contracts should detail how and\nwhen MSPs notify the customer of an incident affecting the customer's environment.\n\nManage account authentication and authorization.\n\nAll organizations should adhere to best practices for password and permission management.\n[28],[29],[30] Organizations should review logs for unexplained failed authentication attempts—failed\nauthentication attempts directly following an account password change could indicate that the account\nhad been compromised. Note: network defenders can proactively search for such \"intrusion canaries\"\nby reviewing logs after performing password changes—using off-network communications to inform\nusers of the changes—across all sensitive accounts.

Grant access and\nadministrative permissions on a need-to-know basis, using the principle of least privilege.\nVerify, via audits, that MSP accounts are being used for appropriate purposes and activities,\nand that these accounts are disabled when not actively being used.\n\nPURPOSE\nThis advisory was developed by UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity\nauthorities in furtherance their respective cybersecurity missions, including their responsibilities to\ndevelop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities would like to\nacknowledge Secureworks for their contributions to this CSA.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

The term MSP traditionally\nwas applied to infrastructure or device-centric types of services but has expanded to\ninclude any continuous, regular management, maintenance and support.\nThe United Kingdom's Department of Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) recently published\nthe following definition of MSP, which includes examples:\nManaged Service Provider - A supplier that delivers a portfolio of IT services to business\ncustomers via ongoing support and active administration, all of which are typically\nunderpinned by a Service Level Agreement. A Managed Service Provider may provide\ntheir own Managed Services or offer their own services in conjunction with other IT\nproviders’ services. The Managed Services might include:\n•\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nCloud computing services (resale of cloud services, or an inhouse public and private cloud services, built and provided by the\nManaged Service Providers)\nWorkplace services\nManaged Network\nConsulting\nSecurity services\nOutsourcing\nService Integration and Management\nSoftware Resale\nSoftware Engineering\nAnalytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery services\n\nThe Managed Services might be delivered from customer premises, from customer data\ncentres, from Managed Service Providers’ own data centres or from 3rd party facilities\n(co-location facilities, public cloud data centres or network Points of Presence (PoPs)).\n\nPage 10 of 10 | Product ID: AA22-131A\n\nTLP:WHITE",
