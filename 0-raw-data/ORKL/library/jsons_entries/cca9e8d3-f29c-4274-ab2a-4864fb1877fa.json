The unknown party, calling itself “Shadow Brokers” leaked information about stolen information from NSA a number of times. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers on the details.\n\n In the Fifth leak of the group, which was named \"Lost in Translation\", some very interesting modules were included, some of them referred to as “Territorial Dispute”. A common understanding is that the leak contains information stolen from U.S. agency NSA, hence we will reflect the source as NSA, although we have no proofs on that, but we make no further marks on the possible attribution problem on it. \n\n The leak is not a single set of tools, as parts are replicated over at least two different toolsets in the leaked material. However, the goal is clear. These tools are set to be used by operators to scan attacked computers (hacked targets of NSA) to check if the target has already been hacked by an outsider adversary (nation state backed targeted attack actor). In case of external attack detected, the operator is called to make special attention (in some related cases wording is “please pull back” or ask for supervisor’s advice.)\n\n The size of the leak is huge, and there are tens of different tools and modules among them, most of them to infect computers, retrieve data, and similar. But some tools are designed to get a general knowledge about the infected computers, particularly about software, security software and malware installed on it.\n\n While there are some other parts in the leak where the attackers (the NSA) are looking for signs of traditional cyber-crime software (malware) attacks, the Territorial Dispute part of the leak seems the most interesting. We believe they have the same goal: avoid duel between parties and minimalize the risk of detection of the attack of the governmental organization. Our work, however, focuses on APT detection information - that can help to understand what NSA knows about APT attacks from external governmental targeted attack operators.\n\n#### 1. Details\n\n###### The tools, and scripts that the NSA used to detect other third parties (governmental actors) on the target computers are very simple tools. They check for the existence of specific files, windows registry entries, and other signs that could show the existence of external attacker (targeted, state backed actors) presence on the actual computers. These checks are considered in the term of the security community as IoC, Indicator of Compromise.\n\n 4\n\n\n-----\n\n###### For an APT attack we can generally define IoCs in the number of tens or hundreds, but NSA tools generally contained only very few IoCs, around 1-5, which is strange. Why do they trust information from such closed set of indicators and not broaden it with multiple checks? In general, if we find a piece of malware and want to hunt for similar ones, we try to define 5-10 or even more different specific features, signatures to detect similar attacks. Then it can be set, that the search tool should only mark something important if 6 of 10 signs are found in the sample. The same could stand for an infected computer: One single registry key or existence of a single file named something common like “ipfilter.dll” might not be a good idea to make a detection based on it. But still, as we mentioned, the detection IoCs are very limited in number.\n\n One trivial answer is that while they had probably more information, and ideas for detection, they utilized the process in a way to give as little information as possible to the operators. The operators of the leaked tools can check the source code and hence they can examine the IoCs inside. So, operators have a chance to find clues about the attacks. But once an operator could pinpoint that SIG8 is an attack against the nuclear program of Iran, who and how should inform him to keep it secret? It is a good idea to avoid such findings by limitation of the available information, and reduce IoCs in the tool to as few as possible. Still, it is a question why Stuxnet was enlisted as external attack (if the SIGs refer only targeted attacks by external parties), if possibly NSA also contributed to it? It is possible that Stuxnet attack was so hidden, that only very few at NSA knew about that and they really mis-attributed their own attack thinking belonging to external parties, hence it is part of the list, which list consists of attacks from external parties.\n\n The naming convention for the findings also reflect this fact. All these detections are referred to as SIGX, where X stands for 1 to 45. Operators should not know about operation names, they should handle the situation according to the plan.\n\n As mentioned already, the “detection engine”, the IoC scanning tools are very simplistic, they are looking for only a very few number of indicators, and it is not impossible, that they detect some infections of external adversaries, but they cannot detect others. It is a very strange decision, but maybe within the organization they already made a risk analysis and it showed that there is a risk that external party could stole, use, or leak this information. The attackers maybe though it was a good idea to limit the presence of IoCs in their tools to lower this risk.\n\n### IoC, scanner, public information\n\n###### From the leak, we can extract the IoC information, the indicators of compromise, or in normal wording the things they are looking for. But Territorial Dispute module looks for targeted APT attacks, and there is a lot of public information uncovered about targeted attacks. The module\n\n 5\n\n\n-----\n\n###### contains detection for the samples we really well know, as BME CrySyS Lab uncovered the Duqu attack, worked on MiniDuke, TeamSpy, Duqu2 or others.\n\n As there is a public set of information about APT attacks uncovered by security professionals with a limited scope, and there must be a stack of information about the same attacks and more at the intelligence community.\n\n This leak can uncovers some of the gap between the knowledge of public (through publications of the security community, mainly by the contribution of AV companies, and research labs like us at BME CrySyS), and other organizations and can shed light on the amount of difference of knowledge among these parties. Some 20 years before it was known how many math experts were hired by NSA and by later it was understood that NSA is at least 10 years beyond current public crypto research results. However, how much NSA (and others) are beyond gathering information on APT attacks was not uncovered yet. This leak helps us to shed light on the timeline how NSA found traces to attackers and how public information was available on the same attacks.\n\n Please note, this leak was available to all kind of stakeholders on the internet for almost a year, hence this publication will not add new information for most of the governmental parties, and hence we believe it does not influence of any nation state’s security or safety. However, common understanding of the situation at the public level is essential to avoid confusion and to help public to make democratic decisions on procedures of the governmental institutions. In contrast, one could expect, that based on the information in the leak, previously unknown APT attacks could have been already uncovered, and it is not impossible that even some still working 0-days could have been identified by professionals based on the leak. Also, it is a question if that was a good idea not to distribute information about discovered APTs by the government agency to help avoid further attacks.\n\n Of course, sharing information about ongoing attacks could be debated. First of all, sharing information might influence the attacker to change strategy and tools and hence agencies cannot continue to closely observe their activity. Also, too many revealing could have speed up other governments to build up capabilities to handle attacks similar to those that NSA is capable to do. Finally, analysis of pros and cons of the sharing might have been resulted positive for hiding information, as that should be a default decision for such entities.\n\n### Work method\n\n###### The goal of our work is to boost interest on this topic and help other researchers to work on the results. This means, we are unable to check those thousands of traces that the 45 IoCs of the original leaks produces. We tried to make one step after the initial information and share by this document to initiate research to widen results.\n 6\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • For some known APT attacks, the findings can extend knowledge, e.g. by adding new known kernel driver names to Stuxnet attacks\n\n • For some, only very little information was available publicly yet, but based on the IoCs malware samples, more could be uncovered and public knowledge about these could be extended, although it is very unlikely that information about the victims will be uncovered\n\n • For some attacks, additional IoCs can start up uncovering the attack, as before of that traces were unavailable and hence APT research finished up in very short reports stating “XY used this attack as targeted attack, from now on we refer to this under the name of W” like reports.\n\n • On some IoCs, we never had public knowledge about the classification of a targeted (APT) attack. Based on the current results, some attacks, samples, or even hundreds of samples will get to be identified as part of some APT attacks that were previously unknown or partially unknown.\n\n Initially we tried to collect information from traditional open-source OPSEC sources, like google search. We also tried to collect information by Yara rules applied to our malware repository, which consists of at least 150 TB of known malicious binaries.\n\n Of course, information from one source is a basis to find more information bases on the results of the previous; hence we continued to track traces. However, the set of information is just too wide so we definitely don’t clam the “extensive research” or “full research” tag, our part of the story is to make “initial research”.\n\n In the rest of the document, we mainly publish links, short information strips, and hashes. This all means, we publish possibly next steps, reasoning on the origin of the attack, and all kind of additional information that can help others to go forward. We don’t think we can or could have made the best document based of the available facts, so we appreciate if anybody would work on this and extend the common knowledge by their results.\n\n Hence, we are happy to help others to publish their extensions on our work.\n\n The current document plans to share information to professionals. Hence, in addition to the public information (in multiple types), hashes of samples are included in the results. The hashes might be partially usable, we do not have a clear vision if the samples found are really connected to the attacks.\n\n The tools\n\n The tools related to “Territorial Dispute” and other APT related information can be found in the following files and directories of the Shadow Brokers leak: \n\n 7\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The windows\\Resources\\TeDi\\PyScripts\\ contains multiple files. Three of them are utility scripts, while the most interesting python program is sigs.py, which contains very simple ‘signatures’ (named SIG1-SIG45), which link to known and unknown APT campaigns from the recent years. The individual subroutines in this file are find_01 to find_45.\n\n For example, find_08 relates to the Stuxnet attack, as demonstration, the subroutine is very simple and short:\n\n A piece of code resolves the abbreviation, ‘TeDi’ to Territorial Dispute:\n\n tedilog = getLogger('TERRITORIALDISPUTE')\n\n                      windows/Resources/TeDi/PyScripts/utils.py#9\n\n In addition to the TeDi scanners, some other files also contain important information related to targeted attacks. \n\n 8\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Another directory windows\\Resources\\Ep\\Scripts\\malfind contains individual tools for scanning for signs of APT attacks and extracting information:\n\n 9\n\n\n-----\n\n###### For example, we identified that SIG25 is most likely the APT attack known as “Dark Hotel”. The related scanning tool is a very simple script:\n\n As we can see, this script looks for the existence of an actual file “winver32.exe” in the very specific $docsandsettings\\\\$subkey\\\\Application Data\\\\winver32.exe path. Interestingly, using google search to find connection between winver32.exe and Dark Hotel does not currently show up any information about the connection, so this link might be a new finding based on the leaked information.\n\n The related “get” information gathering scripts are also interesting. For example, related to Stuxnet (SIG8) the script contains the following file names:\n\n 10\n\n\n-----\n\n###### If one of the files found on the target, the operator might decide to get a copy of the file. (Note the “DropboxAPI” call, most likely this is the channel for the file transfer). Related code:\n\n 11\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Another tool for scanning uses an external file with definitions to find related SIGs: windows/Resources/Ep/Scripts/ifthen/gwdef_other_peeps.txt contains mostly the same detection rules but in a different format. A sample screen on the tool:\n\n The file DriverList.db (windows\\Resources\\Ops\\Databases\\DriverList.db), contains a list of drivers related to APT attacks and also a list of Antivirus product drivers, hardware drivers and some interesting ones, e.g.: information on U.S./NSA related attack tools with remarks/commands for operators. A similar file in text format can also be found at windows\\Resources\\Ops\\Data\\drv_list.txt and a copy of it at windows\\Resources\\Ep\\drv_list.txt.\n\n The driver list most likely contains known windows kernel drivers, and remarks reveal the connection with some APT attacks. For example, it seems that “biosfix” and “bitcheck” might be related to SIG25 APT attack. From the indicators, we think SIG25 is the APT attack known as “Dark Hotel”.\n\n There are remarks for own tools:\n\n \"mscnsp\",\"*** FORMALRITE/UNITEDRAKE ***\"\n\n 12\n\n\n-----\n\n###### \"mscoreep\",\"*** FOGGYBOTTOM/UNITEDRAKE ***\"\n\n and other interesting remarks:\n\n \"msfcvr32\",\"*** DANGEROUS MALWARE - SEEK HELP ASAP ***\"\n\n \"msrsfler\",\"*** UNKNOWN - PLEASE PULL BACK ***\"\n\n \"wmiapvrr\", \"*** FRIENDLY TOOL - SEEK HELP ASAP ***\"\n\n \"bsdnfs\", \"*** SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY ***\"\n\n More similar remarks can be found in the end of this document.\n\n\n###### 13\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.

The database contains around 150 TB malware samples. After finishing the scan process some 290 000 malware samples were collected. Many of them are evidently false positives, e.g. the string adobe.dll can be found in many thousands of samples.\n\n The yara rules we used were based on the IoCs. However, as malware samples won’t contain whole path, we had to transform the IoCs into some strings that have a chance to be found in malicious binaries.\n\n We tried to clean up those items that seemed to be very likely false positives. At the end we have a collection of 5162 possibly related samples.
