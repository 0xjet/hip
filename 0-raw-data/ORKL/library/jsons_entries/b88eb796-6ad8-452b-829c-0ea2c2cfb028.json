The novel malware named\nRecordBreaker is currently active in the information stealer market and hacker forums,\nenabling threat actors to take advantage of upgraded password-stealing functionality and\nenhanced malware capabilities.\n\n## Detect Raccoon Stealer 2.0\n\n\n-----\n\nEver-growing attack volumes require ultra-responsiveness from cyber defenders and\naccelerated speed to stay ahead of attackers.

Although malware operators state that all the stolen details are encrypted,\nSekoia researchers haven’t observed this type of functionality.\n\nNotably, the novel Raccoon version transfers data each time it collects a new piece of\ninformation.
