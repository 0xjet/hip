    "plain_text": "# The Manufacturing Threat Landscape in 2020\n\n**[crowdstrike.com/blog/adversaries-targeting-the-manufacturing-industry/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/adversaries-targeting-the-manufacturing-industry/)**\n\nFalcon OverWatch Team July 14, 2020\n\nSince January 2020, the CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ managed threat hunting team\nhas observed an escalation in hands-on-keyboard activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nfundamentally shifted the way businesses are working, and adversaries are taking full\nadvantage of businesses that fail to adapt their security postures in response.\n\nIn just the first six months of 2020, OverWatch has tracked more intrusions than were seen\nthroughout all of 2019. The top industries impacted have been manufacturing, technology,\n[finance, telecommunications and healthcare. This blog is part of a series from the Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-threat-hunting-uncovers-covid-19-healthcare-attacks/)\nOverWatch team, and each will be a deep dive into the types of targeted intrusions being\nobserved in these industries.\n\n## Increases in Intrusion Numbers and Sophistication\n\nIn the manufacturing industry in particular, it is notable that an escalation in activity has\noccurred both in terms of the quantity and sophistication of these intrusions. The number of\ntargeted intrusions against the manufacturing industry in just the first half of 2020 was more\nthan triple what was observed by OverWatch throughout 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother feature of the manufacturing threat landscape is that it is one of only a handful of\nindustries that OverWatch routinely sees targeted by both state-sponsored and eCrime\nadversaries.The often-critical nature of manufacturing operations and the valuable data that\nmany manufacturing businesses hold make them an enticing target for adversary groups\nseeking to extract value and further their strategic objectives. CrowdStrike Intelligence has\nidentified 10 distinct adversary groups — encompassing both state-sponsored and eCrime\nactors — known to intentionally target the manufacturing industry. And there are many other\nopportunistic adversaries that could also reasonably be expected to target the industry\nshould the chance arise.\n\n## Big Game Hunting on the Rise\n\nAmong the intrusions uncovered this year, Overwatch has recently observed a statesponsored actor employing novel techniques to deploy tooling within a victim environment. It\n[is also clear that eCrime actors are continuing to adapt and evolve big game hunting (BGH)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)\nactivities. Notably, the first half of 2020 has seen more BGH adversary groups adopt data\nexfiltration techniques and threaten data leaks to reinforce ransom demands. Further, new\nBGH campaigns have emerged employing ransomware capable of killing industrial control\nsystem processes (among a range of other processes).\n\nExamples of current adversary activity targeting the manufacturing industry are explored\nbelow. Now more than ever, there is a clear impetus for defenders in the manufacturing\nindustry to be prepared to respond to a diverse range of adversary tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs). OverWatch expects to see this escalation of activity targeting the\nmanufacturing industry persist throughout the remainder of 2020.\n\n## Suspected State-Sponsored Adversary Deploys Malicious Tooling via an Enterprise Application\n\nOverWatch’s discovery of an intrusion using ShadowPad malware against a manufacturing\ncompany in the North America region reveals that adversaries likely working on behalf of the\nChinese state are actively exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities to target the\nmanufacturing industry. Interestingly, this case study demonstrates the adversary’s capability\nto quickly operationalize newly identified vulnerabilities, giving them the potential to pursue\ntheir mission objectives at scale.\n\nIn the intrusion, uncovered earlier this year, a suspected state-sponsored adversary gained\naccess to the victim’s network by exploiting a public-facing application on the initial host.\nOverWatch discovered this activity shortly after it began due to a rapid succession of unusual\nhost activities.\n\nThe combination of process-hollowing, registry changes and an interactive command shell\nbeing executed quickly captured the attention of threat hunters. Instead of attempting to\nmove from one host to the next manually the adversary deployed tooling using an enterprise\n\n\n-----\n\napplication capable of updating its client software. Using the compromised server, they\ncopied a malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) file named `dbghelp.dll into place for`\ndistribution to client systems. The DLL was then executed on the client systems by the\nenterprise application leveraging DLL search-order hijacking.\n\nOnce the initial DLL was executed — triggered by either a user login or a host restart — it\ndeployed two files to the operating system temporary directory `C:\\Windows\\temp . The first`\nwas an embedded copy of `consent.exe, a valid Windows executable, which was written to`\ndisk using a similar name to the affected enterprise application, and the second was a\nmalicious ShadowPad DLL. The ShadowPad DLL masquerades as a legitimate Windows file\nby using the name `secur32.dll .`\n\n```\nC:\\Windows\\temp\\[REDACTED]Update.exe\n\n```\n```\nC:\\Windows\\temp\\secur32.dll\n\n```\n\nThe initial DLL then executed [REDACTED]Update.exe, which then loaded `secure32.dll`\nthrough search-order hijacking. `[REDACTED]Update.exe made another copy of`\n```\nconsent.exe and secur32.dll to a different directory on the host. Once these files are\n\n```\nin place, they are executed, and the second malicious DLL is again loaded using searchorder hijacking.\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Gateway\\Algs.exe\n\n```\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Gateway\\secur32.dll\n\n```\n```\nAlgs.exe then uses process injection to hide its malicious code under svchost.exe and\ndwm.exe . The first attempt to execute by injecting the malicious code into svchost.exe\n\n```\nwas blocked by the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor. The attacker then attempted execution®\nunder `dwm.exe . At this point,` `dwm.exe began to communicate with adversary`\ninfrastructure masquerading as the vendor of the enterprise application. `Algs.exe was`\nalso installed using the Windows Registry to execute when a user logs in.\n\n```\nKEY: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n```\n```\nNAME: LayerGatewayService\n\n```\n```\nVAL: C:\\ProgramData\\Gateway\\Algs.exe\n\n```\n\nThe adversary used the backdoors on several client hosts to create a new service to\nestablish persistence and prepare the system for credential harvesting attacks. They first\nqueried the `Algs.exe process to ensure it was running, then made a renamed copy of`\n```\nAppLaunch.exe and a third malicious DLL to another directory on the host.\n\n```\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Bluetooth\\BluetoothSvc.exe\n\n```\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Bluetooth\\mscoree.dll\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nA service was then installed on the host using a seemingly benign name. The third DLL was\nloaded by `BluetoothSvc.exe and also began communicating with adversary`\ninfrastructure.\n\nWith their backdoor services in place, the adversary added a Windows Registry key to\nenable in-memory credential caching.\n```\nreg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest /v\nUseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f\n\n```\nAt this point the adversary’s session with the host ended, presumably to wait for credentials\nto be stored in memory for later collection.\n\n### Alerting the Victim\n\nWithin an hour of initial execution, OverWatch had notified the victim of the known\ncompromised hosts. Overwatch quickly widened its search and was able to alert the victim to\nseveral other hosts compromised by the adversary in the same time period. Because the\nadversary leveraged legitimate operating system executables and authorized enterprise\napplications, they decreased their chances of discovery by traditional security monitoring.\n\nFurther, the three malicious files used in this intrusion were named to masquerade legitimate\nDLL names or at least appear benign without further analysis. OverWatch was able to\ndiscover the adversary thanks to advanced hunting capability, informed by in-depth\nknowledge of the tactics and techniques used by attackers. This enabled the victim\norganization to quickly and comprehensively contain the affected hosts and remediate the\nintrusion.\n\nSubsequent analysis by CrowdStrike Intelligence indicated that the DLL files were either\ndroppers or payloads for the ShadowPad malware. Infrastructure from command-and-control\n(C2) domains used by the ShadowPad malware overlapped with Bisonal malware activity in\na campaign that is currently attributed to KARMA PANDA with low confidence.\n\n### Adversary Capabilities and Motivations\n\nThis adversary exhibited several interesting techniques that provide clues to their capabilities\nand motivations:\n\nFirst, the compromise of a vulnerability in an enterprise application to automate the\ndeployment and execution of their toolset, combined with the deliberate methods used\nto execute their payloads, paints a picture of a meticulously planned intrusion. This is\nfurther supported by the absence of superfluous arguments or typographical errors in\nthe actor’s interactive commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond, the adversary s deliberate and patient approach to credential harvesting\nstands in stark contrast to noisier smash-and-grab attacks that go after low-hanging\nfruit. The Windows Registry changes to `WDigest node prepared the system to store`\nthe credentials unencrypted in system memory to be harvested over time. This\nadversary behavior is indicative of more complex motivations, perhaps the intention to\nreturn in subsequent attacks to steal intellectual property or disrupt the victim’s\noperations.\n\n## eCrime Adversaries Continue to Evolve Their Tactics\n\nIt is not just state-sponsored adversaries that manufacturing defenders need to be alert to.\nThe growth of BGH activities in recent years has been well documented by CrowdStrike.\n[These targeted, criminally motivated, enterprise-wide ransomware attacks have proliferated,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/what-is-ransomware/)\nand adversaries are constantly evolving their TTPs to extract maximum value from their\nvictims. For eCrime adversaries, the manufacturing industry is an attractive BGH target, with\na perceived high ability and incentive to pay.\n\nEKANS (aka Snake) ransomware has emerged as a unique new threat to the manufacturing\nindustry due to its reported ability to kill a wide range of processes, including those related to\nSCADA systems, industrial control systems, virtual machines, remote management tools and\nnetwork management software, to enable encryption of files related to those systems.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence first reported on EKANS in January 2020. While the adversaries\noperating EKANS appear to be targeting organizations opportunistically, the manufacturing\nindustry — alongside the automotive, engineering, financial and healthcare industries — is\nknown to have been hit by this new threat.\n\nData extortion has proven to be another trend that the manufacturing industry needs to\nwatch. CrowdStrike’s [2020 Global Threat Report revealed that toward the end of 2019, data](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/?utm_expid=.64479FnSQHeBMhne6YsWVA.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\nextortion began to gain traction as an alternative method of monetizing BGH attacks.\nAdversaries have started using the threat of leaking or selling sensitive data instead of — or\nin combination with — ransomware to increase their chances of extracting payment.\n\nInterestingly, Crowdstrike Intelligence found that manufacturing was the industry most\ntargeted by data leaks in the first quarter of 2020. In late February, DOPPEL SPIDER\nappeared to become the latest adversary group to join this trend with the launch of the\nDopple leaks (sic) website. The website, claiming to be linked to DOPPEL SPIDER, lists\ninformation stolen from past victims who failed to pay ransoms.\n\n### DOPPEL SPIDER Found in Hands-on-Keyboard Reconnaissance in a Manufacturing Environment\n\nOverWatch threat hunters recently discovered DOPPEL SPIDER in a manufacturing\nenvironment. The intrusion, which stemmed from a successful phishing attack, followed the\nexpected pattern of a hands-on-keyboard attack with a range of discovery techniques used\n\n\n-----\n\nto conduct reconnaissance in the environment. The intrusion was initially observed when a\nmalicious DLL was side-loaded by legitimate executables and the victim was notified.\n\nThe use of this technique is one of the initial hunting leads that brought it to the threat\nhunter’s attention. Later, the adversary returned and was discovered when a burst of unusual\ncommands occurred within a short period of time.\n\nThe adversary used legitimate executables, regularly used by administrators, to gather\ninformation about the victim’s Active Directory environment. The adversary created and\nexecuted batch scripts on the host, which then ran the reconnaissance commands and\ncaptured the output into text files. They then used 7zip to compress the files in preparation\nfor exfiltration.\n\nReconnaissance:\n\n```\nnltest /dclist:\n\n```\n```\nadfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)\n\n```\n```\nnltest /domain_trusts\n\n```\n```\nnet group \"Domain Computers\" /DOMAIN\n\n```\n\nData Staging:\n\n```\n7.exe a -mx3 ad.victim.7z ad_*.*\n\n```\n```\nFILE: victim\\ad_computers.txt\n\n```\n```\nFILE: victim\\ad_subnets.txt\n\n```\n```\nFILE: victim\\ad_users.txt\n\n```\n\nWhile the data gathered on this occasion using these commands would not contain data\nsuch as intellectual property, it is information that would be extremely useful to an attacker in\n[furthering the intrusion. Effective threat hunting is about assessing behaviors in their specific](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/threat-hunting/)\ncontext to identify potentially malicious activity. OverWatch recommends that defenders\nwatch for unexpected series of commands.\n\nThough this activity could certainly be something that an administrator would perform during\nthe course of their duties, OverWatch threat hunters are always watching out for and digging\ninto bursts of activity or an uncharacteristic series of commands similar to this. Without\ncontinuous hunting, these types of commands may never be discovered because security\nsoftware would not see them as malicious. Because this activity was identified, the victim\norganization was able to take action and prevent further activity or the exfiltration of data.\n\n## Security Recommendations\n\n\n-----\n\nThese intrusions highlight the lengths to which adversaries will go to achieve their mission\nobjectives. Both state-sponsored and eCrime adversaries have demonstrated their ability to\nevolve their TTPs to exploit new vulnerabilities or increase the pressure on their victims.\nOverWatch expects to see the manufacturing industry remain a high-frequency target\nthrough the remainder of 2020. Accordingly, defenders need to be alert to the sophisticated\nand diverse threats taking aim at the industry.\n\n### Threat Hunting\n\nThese case studies highlight the heightened threat environment currently facing the\nmanufacturing industry. In both examples, adversaries used living-off-the-land (LOTL)\ntechniques to avoid detection. Human-driven continuous threat hunting is the most effective\nway of identifying and derailing intrusions that leverage LOTL techniques long before\nadversaries can establish a foothold in the environment.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n**Know your environment. Being able to identify malicious activity in your**\n**environment comes down to understanding what behavior falls outside of your**\n**“normal.” Be on the lookout for unusual sequences of commands, or commands**\n**being executed from unexpected hosts.**\n**Know your enemy. Familiarize yourself with the TTPs of the adversaries that target**\nyour industry. Prioritize your hunt by focusing on those behaviors known to be prevalent\nin manufacturing.\n\n### Vulnerability Management\n\nToday’s adversaries move fast to operationalize exploits for newly disclosed vulnerabilities,\nand they have shown their capacity to roll out their attacks at scale. Defenders need to be\nprepared to move faster than the enemy to implement short-term workarounds or apply\nsecurity patches.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n**[Know your weaknesses. Effectively prioritizing vulnerability management in your](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-emphasis-on-an-old-problem-patch-management-and-accountability/)**\nenvironment is about understanding the relative risk of any individual vulnerability, while\n[also drawing on up-to-the-minute threat intelligence to understand what threats are](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/threat-intelligence/)\nmost active in your region or industry.\n**Shine a spotlight on your environment.
