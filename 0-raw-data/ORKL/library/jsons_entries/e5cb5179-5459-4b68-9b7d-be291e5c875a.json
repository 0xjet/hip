The\nactor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of China’s naval\nmodernization effort The group has specifically targeted engineering transportation and the\n\n\n-----\n\ndefense industry, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. More\nrecently, we have also observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the\nBelt and Road Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines,\nMalaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nThis China-nexus cyber espionage group was previously reported as TEMP.Periscope and\nTEMP.Jumper.\n\n**Mission**\n\nIn December 2016, China’s People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) seized a U.S. Navy\nunmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) operating in the South China Sea. The incident\nparalleled China’s actions in cyberspace; within a year APT40 was observed masquerading\nas a UUV manufacturer, and targeting universities engaged in naval research. That incident\nwas one of many carried out to acquire advanced technology to support the development of\nChinese naval capabilities. We believe APT40’s emphasis on maritime issues and naval\ntechnology ultimately support China’s ambition to establish a blue-water navy.\n\nIn addition to its maritime focus, APT40 engages in broader regional targeting against\ntraditional intelligence targets, especially organizations with operations in Southeast Asia or\ninvolved in South China Sea disputes. Most recently, this has included victims with\nconnections to elections in Southeast Asia, which is likely driven by events affecting China’s\nBelt and Road Initiative. China’s “One Belt, One Road” (一带一路) or “Belt and Road\nInitiative” (BRI) is a $1 trillion USD endeavor to build land and maritime trade routes across\nAsia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to develop a trade network that will project China’s\ninfluence across the greater region.\n\n\n-----\n\nCountries and industries targeted. Countries include the United States, United\nKingdom, Norway, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Indonesia\n\nFigure 1: Countries and industries targeted. Countries include the United States, United\nKingdom, Norway, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Indonesia\n\n**Attribution**\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that APT40 is a state-sponsored Chinese cyber\nespionage operation. The actor’s targeting is consistent with Chinese state interests and\nthere are multiple technical artifacts indicating the actor is based in China. Analysis of the\noperational times of the group’s activities indicates that it is probably centered around China\nStandard Time (UTC +8). In addition, multiple APT40 command and control (C2) domains\nwere initially registered by China based domain resellers and had Whois records with\nChinese location information, suggesting a China based infrastructure procurement process.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT40 has also used multiple Internet Protocol (IP) addresses located in China to conduct\n[its operations. In one instance, a log file recovered from an open indexed server revealed](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections)\nthat an IP address (112.66.188.28) located in Hainan, China had been used to administer the\ncommand and control node that was communicating with malware on victim machines. All of\nthe logins to this C2 were from computers configured with Chinese language settings.\n\n**Attack Lifecycle**\n\n_Initial Compromise_\n\nAPT40 has been observed leveraging a variety of techniques for initial compromise,\nincluding web server exploitation, phishing campaigns delivering publicly available and\ncustom backdoors, and strategic web compromises.\n\nAPT40 relies heavily on web shells for an initial foothold into an organization.\nDepending on placement, a web shell can provide continued access to victims'\nenvironments, re-infect victim systems, and facilitate lateral movement.\nThe operation’s spear-phishing emails typically leverage malicious attachments,\nalthough Google Drive links have also been observed.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT40 attack lifecycle\n\n\nFigure 2: APT40 attack lifecycle\n_Establish Foothold_\n\nAPT40 uses a variety of malware and tools to establish a foothold, many of which are either\npublicly available or used by other threat groups. In some cases, the group has used\nexecutables with code signing certificates to avoid detection.\n\nFirst-stage backdoors such as AIRBREAK, FRESHAIR, and BEACON are used before\ndownloading other payloads.\nPHOTO, BADFLICK, and CHINA CHOPPER are among the most frequently observed\nbackdoors used by APT40.\nAPT40 will often target VPN and remote desktop credentials to establish a foothold in a\ntargeted environment. This methodology proves to be ideal as once these credentials\nare obtained, they may not need to rely as heavily on malware to continue the mission.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Escalate Privileges_\n\nAPT40 uses a mix of custom and publicly available credential harvesting tools to escalate\nprivileges and dump password hashes.\n\nAPT40 leverages custom credential theft utilities such as HOMEFRY, a password\ndumper/cracker used alongside the AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors.\nAdditionally, the Windows Sysinternals ProcDump utility and Windows Credential Editor\n(WCE) are believed to be used during intrusions as well.\n\n_Internal Reconnaissance_\n\nAPT40 uses compromised credentials to log on to other connected systems and conduct\nreconnaissance. The group also leverages RDP, SSH, legitimate software within the victim\nenvironment, an array of native Windows capabilities, publicly available tools, as well as\ncustom scripts to facilitate internal reconnaissance.\n\nAPT40 used MURKYSHELL at a compromised victim organization to port scan IP\naddresses and conduct network enumeration.\nAPT40 frequently uses native Windows commands, such as net.exe, to conduct\ninternal reconnaissance of a victim’s environment.\nWeb shells are heavily relied on for nearly all stages of the attack lifecycle. Internal web\nservers are often not configured with the same security controls as public-facing\ncounterparts, making them more vulnerable to exploitation by APT40 and similarly\nsophisticated groups.\n\n_Lateral Movement_\n\nAPT40 uses many methods for lateral movement throughout an environment, including\ncustom scripts, web shells, a variety of tunnelers, as well as Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP). For each new system compromised, the group usually executes malware, performs\nadditional reconnaissance, and steals data.\n\nAPT40 also uses native Windows utilities such as at.exe (a task scheduler) and net.exe\n(a network resources management tool) for lateral movement.\nPublicly available tunneling tools are leveraged alongside distinct malware unique to\nthe operation.\nAlthough MURKYTOP is primarily a command-line reconnaissance tool, it can also be\nused for lateral movement.\nAPT40 also uses publicly available brute-forcing tools and a custom utility called\nDISHCLOTH to attack different protocols and services.\n\n_Maintain Presence_\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT40 primarily uses backdoors, including web shells, to maintain presence within a victim\nenvironment. These tools enable continued control of key systems in the targeted network.\n\nAPT40 strongly favors web shells for maintaining presence, especially publicly\navailable tools.\nTools used during the Establish Foothold phase also continue to be used in the\nMaintain Presence phase; this includes AIRBREAK and PHOTO.\nSome APT40 malware tools can evade typical network detectiona by leveraging\nlegitimate websites, such as GitHub, Google, and Pastebin for initial C2\ncommunications.\nCommon TCP ports 80 and 443 are used to blend in with routine network traffic.\n\n_Complete Mission_\n\nCompleting missions typically involves gathering and transferring information out of the\ntarget network, which may involve moving files through multiple systems before reaching the\ndestination. APT40 has been observed consolidating files acquired from victim networks and\nusing the archival tool rar.exe to compress and encrypt the data before exfiltration. We have\nalso observed APT40 develop tools such as PAPERPUSH to aid in the effectiveness of their\ndata targeting and theft.\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nDespite increased public attention, APT40 continues to conduct cyber espionage operations\nfollowing a regular tempo, and we anticipate their operations will continue through at least\nthe near and medium term. Based on APT40’s broadening into election-related targets in\n2017, we assess with moderate confidence that the group’s future targeting will affect\nadditional sectors beyond maritime, driven by events such as China’s Belt and Road\nInitiative. In particular, as individual Belt and Road projects unfold, we are likely to see\ncontinued activity by APT40 which extends against the project’s regional opponents.\n\n\n-----",
