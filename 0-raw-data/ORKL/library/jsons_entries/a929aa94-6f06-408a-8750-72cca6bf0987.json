Since then we have identified a number�**\n**of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to Suckfly. The attacks targeted high-�**\n**profile targets, including government and commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several different�**\n**countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily**\n**located in India.**\n\n**While there have been several Suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group’s custom malware�**\n**[Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120123-5521-99)**\n**This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in India.�**\n\n**Campaign activity in India**\n**The first known Suckfly campaign began in April of 2014. During our investigation of the campaign, we identified a�**\n**number of global targets across several industries who were attacked in 2015. Many of the targets we identified�**\n**were well known commercial organizations located in India. These organizations included:**\n\n**One of India's largest financial organizations�**\n**A large e-commerce company**\n**The e-commerce company's primary shipping vendor**\n**One of India's top five IT firms�**\n**A United States healthcare provider's Indian business unit**\n**Two government organizations**\n\n**Suckfly spent more time attacking the government networks compared to all but one of the commercial targets.�**\n**Additionally, one of the two government organizations had the highest infection rate of the Indian targets.

Suckfly attack lifecycle�_**\n\n**1. Suckfly's first step was to identify a user to target so the attackers could attempt their initial breach into the e-�**\n\n**commerce company's internal network. We don't have hard evidence of how Suckfly obtained information on�**\n**the targeted user, but we did find a large open-source presence on the initial target. The target's job function,�**\n**corporate email address, information on work related projects, and publicly accessible personal blog could all**\n**be freely found online.**\n\n**2. On April 22, 2015, Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows)�**\n\n**that allowed the attackers to bypass the User Account Control and install the Nidiran back door to provide**\n**access for their attack. While we know the attackers used a custom dropper to install the back door, we do**\n**not know the delivery vector. Based on the amount of open-source information available on the target, it is**\n**feasible that a spear-phishing email may have been used.**\n\n**3. After the attackers successfully exploited the employee’s system, they gained access to the e-commerce**\n\n**company's internal network. We found evidence that Suckfly used hacktools to move latterly and escalate�**\n**privileges. To do this the attackers used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account**\n**credentials. With the account credentials, the attackers were able to access the victim's account and**\n**navigate the internal corporate network as though they were the employee.**\n\n**4. On April 27, the attackers scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900, and 40**\n\n**open. Ports 8080 and 5900 are common ports used with legitimate protocols, but can be abused by attackers**\n**when they are not secured. It isn't clear why the attackers scanned for hosts with port 40 open because**\n**there isn't a common protocol assigned to this port. Based on Suckfly scanning for common ports, it’s clear�**\n**that the group was looking to expand its foothold on the e-commerce company's internal network.**\n\n**5. The attackers’ final step was to exfiltrate data off the victim’s network and onto Suckfly’s infrastructure. While�**\n\n**we know that the attackers used the Nidiran back door to steal information about the compromised**\n**organization, we do not know if Suckfly was successful in stealing other information.�**\n\n**These steps were taken over a 13-day period, but only on specific days. While tracking what days of the week�**\n**Suckfly used its hacktools, we discovered that the group was only active Monday through Friday. There was no�**\n**activity from the group on weekends. We were able to determine this because the attackers’ hacktools are**\n**command line driven and can provide insight into when the operators are behind keyboards actively working.**\n**Figure 4 shows the attackers’ activity levels throughout the week.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4. Signed hacktools in use against targets, by day_**\n\n**This activity supports our theory, mentioned in the** **[previous Suckfly blog�, that this is a professional organized group](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/suckfly-revealing-secret-life-your-code-signing-certificates)**\n\n**Suckfly's command and control infrastructure�**\n**Suckfly made its malware difficult to analyze to prevent their operations from being detected. However, we were�**\n**able to successfully analyze Suckfly malware samples and extract some of the communications between the�**\n**Nidiran back door and the Suckfly command and control (C&C) domains.�**\n\n**We analyzed the dropper, which is an executable that contains the following three files:�**\n\n**1. dllhost.exe: The main host for the .dll file�**\n**2. iviewers.dll: Used to load encrypted payloads and then decrypt them**\n**3. msfled: The encrypted payload�**\n\n**All three files are required for the malware to run correctly. Once the malware has been executed, it checks to see if�**\n**it has a connection to the internet before running. If the connection test is successful, the malware runs and**\n**attempts to communicate with the C&C domain over ports 443 and 8443. In the samples we analyzed we found the**\n**port and C&C information encrypted and hardcoded into the Nidiran malware itself. The Nidiran back door made**\n**the following initial communication request to the Suckfly C&C domain:�**\n\n**GET /gte_ok0/logon.php HTTP/1.1**\n**Accept: */***\n**Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate�**\n**User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR**\n**1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152;**\n**.NET CLR 3.5.30729)**\n**Host: REDACTED**\n**Connection: Keep-Alive**\n**Cookie:**\n**dfe6=OIAXUNXWn9CBmFBqtwEEPLzwRGmbMoNR7C0nLcHYa+C1tb4fp7ydcZSmVZ1c4akergWcQQ==**\n\n**The interesting information being transmitted to the C&C server in the initial request is located in the cookie which**\n**is comprised of the following:**\n\n**[COOKIE NAME]=[RC4 ENCRYPTED + B64 ENCODED DATA FROM VICTIM]**\n\n**The key for the RC4 encryption in this sample is the hardcoded string “h0le”.

All of these�**\n**targets are large corporations that play a major role in India’s economy. By targeting all of these organizations**\n**together, Suckfly could have had a much larger impact on India and its economy. While we don't know the�**\n**motivations behind the attacks, the targeted commercial organizations, along with the targeted government**\n**organizations, may point in this direction.**\n\n**Suckfly has the resources to develop malware, purchase infrastructure, and conduct targeted attacks for years�**\n**while staying off the radar of security organizations. During this time they were able to steal digital certificates from�**\n**South Korean companies and launch attacks against Indian and Saudi Arabian government organizations. There is**\n**no evidence that Suckfly gained any benefits from attacking the government organizations, but someone else may�**\n**have benefited from these attacks.�**\n\n**The nature of the Suckfly attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat group orchestrated these attacks on their**\n**own. We believe that Suckfly will continue to target organizations in India and similar organizations in other�**\n**countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind Suckfly's operations.�**\n\n**Protection**\n**Symantec has the following detections in place to protect against Suckfly’s malware:�**\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**[Backdoor.Nidiran](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120123-5521-99)**\n**[Backdoor.Nidiran!g1](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120200-0342-99)**\n**[Hacktool](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-081707-2550-99)**\n**[Exp.CVE-2014-6332](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-111313-5510-99)**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\n**[Web Attack: Microsoft OleAut32 RCE CVE-2014-6332](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28032)**\n**[Web Attack: Microsoft OleAut32 RCE CVE-2014-6332 2](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=27813)**\n**[Web Attack: Microsoft OleAut32 RCE CVE-2014-6332 4](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=70116)**\n**[Web Attack: OLEAUT32 CVE-2014-6332 3](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28890)**\n**[System Infected: Trojan.Backdoor Activity 120](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28977)**\n\n\n###### Technical SupportTechnical Support\n\n**[Technical Support Home](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=home&locale=en_us)**\n\n**[Supported Products A to Z](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=products&locale=en_us)**\n\n**[Support Fundamentals](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/support_policies.jsp)**\n\n**[Customer Care](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/assistance_information.jsp)**\n\n**[Contact Technical Support](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/contact_techsupp_static.jsp)**\n\n\n###### Symantec.comSymantec.com\n\n**[Small Business Overview](http://www.symantec.com/business/solutions/smallbusiness/)**\n\n**[Enterprise Overview](http://www.symantec.com/business/)**\n\n**[Solutions](http://www.symantec.com/business/solutions/)**\n\n**[Products](http://www.symantec.com/business/products/)**\n\n**[Training](http://www.symantec.com/business/training/)**\n\n**[Services](http://www.symantec.com/business/services/)**\n\n**[Security Response](http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/)**\n\n**[Resources](http://www.symantec.com/business/resources/)**\n\n\n###### StoreStore\n\n**Symantec Backup Exec for**\n**Windows Small Business Server**\n\n**Endpoint Protection Small**\n**Business Edition**\n\n**SSL Certificates�**\n\n\n###### Community StatsCommunity Stats\n\n**Total PostsTotal Posts**\n\n**MembersMembers**\n## 479,251479,251\n\n\n**©2016 Symantec Corporation** **Contact Us** **[Privacy Policy](http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/policies/privacy.jsp)** **Terms and Conditions** **Mobile Site**\n\n\n-----",
