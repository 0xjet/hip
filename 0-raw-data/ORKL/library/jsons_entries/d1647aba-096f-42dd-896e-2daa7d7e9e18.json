His heart is poisoned. He would be thy bane…“\n\n“The Story of Siegfried” by James Baldwin\n\n## Introduction, history\n\n[Download our full Regin paper (PDF).](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08070305/Kaspersky_Lab_whitepaper_Regin_platform_eng.pdf)\n\nIn the spring of 2012, following a Kaspersky Lab presentation on the unusual facts surrounding the\n[Duqu malware, a security researcher contacted us and mentioned that Duqu reminded him of another](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press/major_malware_outbreaks/duqu)\nhigh-end malware incident. Although he couldn’t share a sample, the third-party researcher mentioned\nthe “Regin” name, a malware attack that is now dreaded by many security administrators in\ngovernmental agencies around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the past two years, we ve been tracking this most elusive malware across the world. From time to\ntime, samples would appear on various multi-scanner services, but they were all unrelated to each\nother, cryptic in functionality and lacking context.\n\nIt’s unknown exactly when the first samples of Regin were created. Some of them have timestamps\ndating back to 2003.\n\nThe victims of Regin fall into the following categories:\n\nTelecom operators\nGovernment institutions\nMulti-national political bodies\nFinancial institutions\nResearch institutions\nIndividuals involved in advanced mathematical/cryptographical research\n\nSo far, we’ve observed two main objectives from the attackers:\n\nIntelligence gathering\nFacilitating other types of attacks\n\nWhile in most cases, the attackers were focused on extracting sensitive information, such as e-mails\nand documents, we have observed cases where the attackers compromised telecom operators to\nenable the launch of additional sophisticated attacks. More about this in the GSM Targeting section\nbelow.\n\nPerhaps one of the most publicly known victims of Regin is Jean Jacques Quisquater\n[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Quisquater), a well-known Belgian cryptographer. In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Quisquater)\nFebruary 2014, Quisquater announced he was the victim of a sophisticated cyber intrusion incident. We\nwere able to obtain samples from the Quisquater case and confirm they belong to the Regin platform.\n\nAnother interesting victim of Regin is a computer we are calling “The Magnet of Threats“. This\ncomputer belongs to a research institution and has been attacked by Turla, Mask/Careto, Regin,\n**Itaduke, Animal Farm and some other advanced threats that do not have a public name, all co-**\nexisting happily on the same computer at some point.\n\n## Initial compromise and lateral movement\n\nThe exact method of the initial compromise remains a mystery, although several theories exist, which\ninclude man-in-the-middle attacks with browser zero-day exploits. For some of the victims, we\nobserved tools and modules designed for lateral movement. So far, we have not encountered any\nexploits. The replication modules are copied to remote computers by using Windows administrative\nshares and then executed. Obviously, this technique requires administrative privileges inside the\nvictim’s network. In several cases, the infected machines were also Windows domain controllers.\nTargeting of system administrators via web-based exploits is one simple way of achieving immediate\nadministrative access to the entire network.\n\n## The Regin platform\n\n\n-----\n\nIn short, Regin is a cyber-attack platform which the attackers deploy in the victim networks for ultimate\nremote control at all possible levels.\n\nThe platform is extremely modular in nature and has multiple stages.\n\n_Regin platform diagram_\n\nThe first stage (“stage 1”) is generally the only executable file that will appear in victim’ systems.\nFurther stages are stored either directly on the hard drive (for 64 bit systems), as NTFS Extended\nAttributes or registry entries. We’ve observed many different stage 1 modules, which sometimes have\nbeen merged with public sources to achieve a type of polymorphism, complicating the detection\nprocess.\n\nThe second stage has multiple purposes and can remove the Regin infection from the system if\ninstructed so by the 3rd stage.\n\nThe second stage also creates a marker file that can be used to identify the infected machine. Known\nfilenames for this marker are:\n\n**%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\nsreg1.dat**\n**%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\bssec3.dat**\n**%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\msrdc64.dat**\n\nStage 3 exists only on 32 bit systems – on 64 bit systems, stage 2 loads the dispatcher directly,\nskipping the third stage.\n\nStage 4, the dispatcher, is perhaps the most complex single module of the entire platform. The\ndispatcher is the user-mode core of the framework. It is loaded directly as the third stage of the 64-bit\nbootstrap process or extracted and loaded from the VFS as module 50221 as the fourth stage on 32-bit\nsystems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dispatcher takes care of the most complicated tasks of the Regin platform, such as providing an\nAPI to access virtual file systems, basic communications and storage functions as well as network\ntransport sub-routines. In essence, the dispatcher is the brain that runs the entire platform.\n\n[A thorough description of all malware stages can be found in our full technical paper.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08070305/Kaspersky_Lab_whitepaper_Regin_platform_eng.pdf)\n\n### Virtual File Systems (32/64-bit)\n\nThe most interesting code from the Regin platform is stored in encrypted file storages, known as Virtual\nFile Systems (VFSes).\n\nDuring our analysis we were able to obtain 24 VFSes, from multiple victims around the world.\nGenerally, these have random names and can be located in several places in the infected system. For\n[a full list, including format of the Regin VFSes, see our technical paper.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08070305/Kaspersky_Lab_whitepaper_Regin_platform_eng.pdf)\n\n## Unusual modules and artifacts\n\nWith high-end APT groups such as the one behind Regin, mistakes are very rare. Nevertheless, they\ndo happen. Some of the VFSes we analyzed contain words which appear to be the respective\ncodenames of the modules deployed on the victim:\n\n**legspinv2.6 and LEGSPINv2.6**\n**WILLISCHECKv2.0**\n**HOPSCOTCH**\n\nAnother module we found, which is a plugin type 55001.0 references another codename, which is\n**U_STARBUCKS:**\n\n### GSM Targeting\n\nThe most interesting aspect we found so far about Regin is related to an infection of a large GSM\noperator. One VFS encrypted entry we located had internal id 50049.2 and appears to be an activity log\non a GSM Base Station Controller.\n\n\n-----\n\n_From_ _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_subsystem)_\n\n[According to the GSM documentation (http://www.telecomabc.com/b/bsc.html): “The Base Station](http://www.telecomabc.com/b/bsc.html)\n_[Controller (BSC) is in control of and supervises a number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS). The](http://www.telecomabc.com/b/bts.html)_\n_BSC is responsible for the allocation of radio resources to a mobile call and for the handovers that are_\n_[made between base stations under his control. Other handovers are under control of the MSC.”](http://www.telecomabc.com/m/msc.html)_\n\nHere’s a look at the decoded Regin GSM activity log:\n\nThis log is about 70KB in size and contains hundreds of entries like the ones above. It also includes\ntimestamps which indicate exactly when the command was executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe entries in the log appear to contain Ericsson OSS MML (Man-Machine Language as defined by\nITU-T) commands.\n\nHere’s a list of some commands issued on the Base Station Controller, together with some of their\ntimestamps:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n\n2008-04-25 11:12:14: rxmop:moty=rxotrx;\n\n2008-04-25 11:58:16: rxmsp:moty=rxotrx;\n\n2008-04-25 14:37:05: rlcrp:cell=all;\n\n2008-04-26 04:48:54: rxble:mo=rxocf-170,subord;\n\n2008-04-26 06:16:22: rxtcp:MOty=RXOtg,cell=kst022a;\n\n2008-04-26 10:06:03: IOSTP;\n\n2008-04-27 03:31:57: rlstc:cell=pty013c,state=active;\n\n2008-04-27 06:07:43: allip:acl=a2;\n\n2008-04-28 06:27:55: dtstp:DIP=264rbl2;\n\n2008-05-02 01:46:02: rlstp:cell=all,state=halted;\n\n2008-05-08 06:12:48:\nrlmfc:cell=NGR035W,mbcchno=83&amp;512&amp;93&amp;90&amp;514&amp;522,listtype=active;\n\n2008-05-08 07:33:12: rlnri:cell=NGR058y,cellr=ngr058x;\n\n2008-05-12 17:28:29: rrtpp:trapool=all;\n\n\nDescriptions for the commands:\n\n**rxmop – check software version type;**\n**rxmsp – list current call forwarding settings of the Mobile Station;**\n\n\n-----\n\n**rlcrp – list off call forwarding settings for the Base Station Controller;**\n**rxble – enable (unblock) call forwarding;**\n**rxtcp – show the Transceiver Group of particular cell;**\n**allip – show external alarm;**\n**dtstp – show DIgital Path (DIP) settings (DIP is the name of the function used for supervision of**\nthe connected PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) lines);\n**rlstc – activate cell(s) in the GSM network;**\n**rlstp – stop cell(s) in the GSM network;**\n**rlmfc – add frequencies to the active broadcast control channel allocation list;**\n**rlnri – add cell neightbour;**\n**rrtpp – show radio transmission transcoder pool details;**\n\nThe log seems to contain not only the executed commands but also usernames and passwords of\nsome engineering accounts:\n\nsed[snip]:Alla[snip] hed[snip]:Bag[snip] oss:New[snip] administrator:Adm[snip] nss1:Eric[snip]\n\nIn total, the log indicates that commands were executed on 136 different cells. Some of the cell names\ninclude “prn021a, gzn010a, wdk004, kbl027a, etc…“. The command log we obtained covers a period\nof about one month, from April 25, 2008 through May 27, 2008. It is unknown why the commands\nstopped in May 2008 though; perhaps the infection was removed or the attackers achieved their\nobjective and moved on. Another explanation is that the attackers improved or changed the malware to\nstop saving logs locally and that’s why only some older logs were discovered.\n\n## Communication and C&C\n\nThe C&C mechanism implemented in Regin is extremely sophisticated and relies on communication\ndrones deployed by the attackers throughout the victim networks. Most victims communicate with\nanother machine in their own internal network, through various protocols, as specified in the config file.\nThese include HTTP and Windows network pipes. The purpose of such a complex infrastructure is to\nachieve two goals: give attackers access deep into the network, potentially bypassing air gaps and\nrestrict as much as possible the traffic to the C&C.\n\nHere’s a look at the decoded configurations:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n17.3.40.101 transport 50037 0 0 y.y.y.5:80 ; transport 50051 217.y.y.yt:443\n\n17.3.40.93 transport 50035 217.x.x.x:443 ; transport 50035 217.x.x.x:443\n\n50.103.14.80 transport 27 203.199.89.80 ; transport 50035 194.z.z.z:8080\n\n51.9.1.3 transport 50035 192.168.3.3:445 ; transport 50035 192.168.3.3:9322\n\n18.159.0.1 transport 50271 DC ; transport 50271 DC\n\n\nIn the above table, we see configurations extracted from several victims that bridge together infected\nmachines in what appears to be virtual networks: 17.3.40.x, 50.103.14.x, 51.9.1.x, 18.159.0.x. One of\nthese routes reaches out to the “external” C&C server at 203.199.89.80.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe numbers right after the transport indicate the plugin that handles the communication. These are\nin our case:\n\n27 – ICMP network listener using raw sockets\n50035 – Winsock-based network transport\n50037 – Network transport over HTTP\n50051 – Network transport over HTTPS\n50271 – Network transport over SMB (named pipes)\n\nThe machines located on the border of the network act as routers, effectively connecting victims from\ninside the network with C&Cs on the internet.\n\nAfter decoding all the configurations we’ve collected, we were able to identify the following external\nC&Cs.\n\n**C&C server IP** **Location** **Description**\n\n61.67.114.73 Taiwan, Province Of China Taichung Chwbn\n\n202.71.144.113 India, Chetput Chennai Network Operations (team-m.co)\n\n203.199.89.80 India, Thane Internet Service Provider\n\n194.183.237.145 Belgium, Brussels Perceval S.a.\n\nOne particular case includes a country in the Middle East. This case was mind-blowing so we thought\nit’s important to present it. In this specific country, all the victims we identified communicate with each\nother, forming a peer-to-peer network. The P2P network includes the president’s office, a research\n**center, educational institution network and a bank.**\n\nThese victims spread across the country are all interconnected to each other. One of the victims\ncontains a translation drone which has the ability to forward the packets outside of the country, to the\nC&C in India.\n\nThis represents a rather interesting command-and-control mechanism, which is guaranteed to raise\nvery little suspicions. For instance, if all commands to the president’s office are sent through the bank’s\nnetwork, then all the malicious traffic visible for the president’s office sysadmins will be only with the\nbank, in the same country.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Victim Statistics\n\nOver the past two years, we collected statistics about the attacks and victims of Regin. These were\naided by the fact that even after the malware is uninstalled, certain artifacts are left behind which can\nhelp identify an infected (but cleaned) system. For instance, we’ve seen several cases where the\nsystems were cleaned but the “msrdc64.dat” infection marker was left behind.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo far, victims of Regin were identified in 14 countries:\n\n**Algeria**\n**Afghanistan**\n**Belgium**\n**Brazil**\n**Fiji**\n**Germany**\n**Iran**\n**India**\n**Indonesia**\n**Kiribati**\n**Malaysia**\n**Pakistan**\n**Russia**\n**Syria**\n\nIn total, we counted 27 different victims, although it should be pointed out that the definition of a\nvictim here refers to a full entity, including their entire network. The number of unique PCs infected with\nRegin is of course much, much higher.\n\nFrom the map above, Fiji and Kiribati are unusual, because we rarely see such advanced malware in\nsuch remote, small countries. In particular, the victim in Kiribati is most unusual. To put this into context,\nKiribati is a small island in the Pacific, with a population around 100,000.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore information about the Regin victims is available through Kaspersky Intelligent Services. Contact:\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Attribution\n\nConsidering the complexity and cost of Regin development, it is likely that this operation is supported\nby a nation-state. While attribution remains a very difficult problem when it comes to professional\nattackers such as those behind Regin, certain metadata extracted from the samples might still be\nrelevant.\n\nAs this information could be easily altered by the developers, it’s up to the reader to attempt to interpret\nthis: as an intentional false flag or a non-critical indicator left by the developers.\n\nMore information about Regin is available to Kaspersky Intelligent Services’ clients. Contact:\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nFor more than a decade, a sophisticated group known as Regin has targeted high-profile entities\naround the world with an advanced malware platform. As far as we can tell, the operation is still active,\nalthough the malware may have been upgraded to more sophisticated versions. The most recent\nsample we’ve seen was from a 64-bit infection. This infection was still active in the spring of 2014.\n\nThe name Regin is apparently a reversed “In Reg”, short for “In Registry”, as the malware can store its\nmodules in the registry. This name and detections first appeared in anti-malware products around\nMarch 2011.\n\n[From some points of view, the platform reminds us of another sophisticated malware: Turla. Some](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/)\nsimilarities include the use of virtual file systems and the deployment of communication drones to\nbridge networks together. Yet through their implementation, coding methods, plugins, hiding techniques\n\n\n-----\n\nand flexibility, Regin surpasses Turla as one of the most sophisticated attack platforms we have ever\nanalysed.\n\nThe ability of this group to penetrate and monitor GSM networks is perhaps the most unusual and\ninteresting aspect of these operations. In today’s world, we have become too dependent on mobile\nphone networks which rely on ancient communication protocols with little or no security available for\nthe end user. Although all GSM networks have mechanisms embedded which allow entities such as\nlaw enforcement to track suspects, there are other parties which can gain this ability and further abuse\nthem to launch other types of attacks against mobile users.\n\n[Full technical paper with IOCs.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08070305/Kaspersky_Lab_whitepaper_Regin_platform_eng.pdf)\n\nKaspersky products detect modules from the Regin platform as: Trojan.Win32.Regin.gen and\n**Rootkit.Win32.Regin.**\n\n[If you detect a Regin infection in your network, contact us at: intelservices@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelservices@kaspersky.com)\n\n\n-----",
