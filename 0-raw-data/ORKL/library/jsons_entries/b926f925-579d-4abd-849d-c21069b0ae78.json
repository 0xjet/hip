Log on to QTS as administrator.\n2. Go to Control Panel > System > Firmware Update.\n3. Under Live Update, click Check for Update.\n\nQTS downloads and installs the latest available update.\n\n**Tip: You can also download the update from the QNAP website. Go**\nto Support > Download Center and then perform a manual update for your specific device.\n\nQNAP also suggests users update the Photo Station software with the following steps:\n\n1. Log on to QTS as administrator.\n2. Open the App Center, and then click .\nA search box appears.\n3. Type “Photo Station,” and then press ENTER.\n\nThe Photo Station application appears in the search result list.\n4. Click Update.\n\nA confirmation message appears.\n**Note: The Update button is not available if you are using the latest version.**\n5. Click OK.\n\nThe application is updated.\n\nFinally, all QNAP owners should go through the following checklist to further secure their\nNAS and check for malware:\n\n- Change all passwords for all accounts on the device\n\n- Remove unknown user accounts from the device\n\n- Make sure the device firmware is up-to-date, and all of the applications are also updated\n\n- Remove unknown or unused applications from the device\n\n- Install QNAP MalwareRemover application via the App Center functionality\n\n- Set an access control list for the device (Control panel -> Security -> Security level)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[QNAP alerts NAS customers of new DeadBolt ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-alerts-nas-customers-of-new-deadbolt-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[QNAP warns of ransomware targeting Internet-exposed NAS devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-of-ransomware-targeting-internet-exposed-nas-devices/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[QNAP urges customers to disable UPnP port forwarding on routers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-urges-customers-to-disable-upnp-port-forwarding-on-routers/)\n\n[AgeLocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/agelocker/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[NAS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nas/)\n[QNAP](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/qnap/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
