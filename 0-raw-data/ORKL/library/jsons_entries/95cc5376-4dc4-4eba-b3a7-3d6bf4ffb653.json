In addition to making the data inaccessible, most of the attackers\nthreaten to publish the victim’s data unless the ransom is paid by a certain time (”Double\n_Extortion”). Ransomware is mostly used as a money-making scheme by cyber criminals but it_\nmay also be used in different scenarios to coerce the user into any action by using leverage.\nWhile ransomware has been in use for decades, it has gained much popularity among\ncyber criminals in recent years due to the low level of experience it requires to conduct such\nattacks and the ease of using anonymous payment methods. It is expected that losses from\nransomware attacks are likely to exceed $20 billion by 2021 [2].\n\nRansomware can be separated into two groups based on their modus operandi, namely\nFAR (Fully Automated Ransomware) and SAR (Semi-Automated Ransomware). In FAR cases,\nransomware generally infects the system via phishing emails or malicious web pages\ncontaining the malicious payload. The malware contains the code to spread deeper\ninto the network, identify files, carry out the encryption, and leave a note to the victim,\nexplaining how to make the payment for the recovery. Threat actors using FAR mostly focus\non distribution channels and spreading methods of the malware and tend to stay away\nfrom making direct contact with the victim. Although the execution of FAR attacks is more\nstraightforward, the success rate is much lower for high-value organizations as they have\ndifferent protection tools such as AVs, access controls, and EDRs in place. Victims of FAR\nattacks are also more cautious about paying the ransom as there is a tendency among\npeople to distrust automated systems. The behavior model is similar to a customer asking for\na representative before purchasing to clarify doubts. It is troubling to see people still want to\nnegotiate and discuss the payment with a human being, knowing that they are criminals.\n\nOn the other hand, SAR attacks involve manual interaction of cyber criminals with the\nvictims’ servers. To access the network of the target organization, attackers often use 0-day\nor N-day exploits. We also observe that some of the attackers buy RDP or VPN credentials\ndirectly from other hackers and underground markets. Upon successful entry, attackers\nuse common pentest tools for lateral movement in the network, escalate their privileges,\nand carry out the encryption step via set of encryption tools and/or ransomware. On\nrare occasions, some of the encrypted data can be recovered due to operational mistakes [5].\n\nModern cyber crime businesses use hierarchical work flows to monetize their operations. X\n(Ransomware, Malware, Dropper, etc.) as a Service models became popular among criminals\nas a different skill set is required to conduct such advanced attacks. In this report, we will\nexplain how RaaS models work in general and also present in-depth knowledge from the\nattackers’ side. We believe that our findings will help other researchers understand the\nworking dynamics of similar ransomware groups.\n\nIn this report, we will analyze a widely known ransomware called ”LockBit” and provide a deep\nunderstanding of how criminals breach and monetize their operations. We will not focus on\nsample analysis as there are many resources covering the technical analysis of the malware\nexecution. Instead, this will be the first report to presents all possible behind-the-scenes\n\n4 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

The ”Private Release” is provided to\nlaw enforcement agencies, applicable CERTS/CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A.\nThreat Intel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the\n_”Public Release” is publicly disseminated for the purpose of advancing the global fight_\nagainst high-end threat actors and APTs.\n\n\n### 2 Executive Summary\n\n#### 2.1 Overview\n\nLockBit is a relatively new ransomware which has became quite popular in the past few\nmonths. Formerly known as “ABCD” ransomware, it has since grown into a unique threat within\nthe scope of these extortion tools [4]. Our PTI Team started analyzing the LockBit group\naround 20.03.2021 based on an emergency request from one of our clients. The investigation\nwas completed by successfully retrieving the decryption keys and restoring the files of our\nclient. Moreover, we helped dozens of other victims to retrieve their decryption keys, thus\npreventing an estimated 8 million dollars of loss. This report presents interesting facts about\nthe ransomware business by accurately showcasing rates, commissions, infection techniques,\nand the criminal organization’s structure.\n\n#### 2.2 LockBit Ransomware\n\nLockBit ransomware is a malicious program that prevents users from accessing their\ncomputers unless the requested ransom payment is given to the attackers. LockBit can\nautomatically scan a network for useful targets, spread the infection, and encrypt all\ncomputers that are available. This ransomware is used in unique attacks against companies\nand other organizations.\n\nAccording to the statistics shared by Coveware [3], The LockBit ransomware attacks has\nincreased drastically in the Q4 of 2020. The following table shows that LockBit ransomware\nis in the third place among other ransomware families, with 7.5% of the market share.\n\n5 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. Coveware’s Most Common Ransomware Variants in Q1 2020**\n\nFor ransomware creators, RaaS is a new business model. Said creators, similar to software\nas a service (SaaS) providers, sell or lease their ransomware variants to affiliates, who\nthen use them to carry out attacks. This business model often includes a platform in the\nform of a management panel. Customers of LockBit service(affiliate threat actors) use this\nmanagement panel to create new ransomware samples, manage victims, and get statistics\nabout their attacks. According to the PTI Team’s investigation, LockBit threat actors are also\nusing methods such as extortion and victim shaming to force victims to pay the ransom\nmoney.\n\n**Analyst Note : The concept of ”victim shaming” can be explained as a pressure tactic**\noften used by ransomware groups to push victim organizations into fulfilling the ransom\ndemand. These tactics may include threatening to release stolen confidential data of the\nvictims or e-mailing the business partners of the victims about the ransomware attack.\n\n#### 2.3 RaaS Business Structure\n\nRaaS owners employ multiple affiliates who are responsible for breaching into victims’\nsystems and encrypt their files. These affiliates are selected mostly from forums among highly\nskilled hackers with penetration testing backgrounds. Another way of becoming an affiliate\n\n6 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Example of LockBit threat actors using extortion**\n\nis to have an established trade network to obtain access to information from other criminals.\nIn both cases, RaaS owners require references from other criminals before hiring any affiliate.\nReputations of the criminals become essential in such cases. Most of the affiliates earn\nbetween 10%-30% commission from each ransom payment. RaaS owners also often provide\nvirtual machines, exploits, and tools for their affiliates to support their attacks. Each affiliate\nhas access to a panel where they can monitor their victims and communicate with them. An\naffiliate panel usually has the following capabilities :\n\n## • [Creating/Building a ransomware executable]\n • [Providing a decryptor program upon payment]\n • [Providing a payment gateway (cryptocoins) for the victims]\n • [Calculating the commission rates of the affiliates]\n • [Monitoring victims and statistics]\n • [Providing a chat functionality to talk with the victims]\n\nAffiliates try to maximize their profit by forcing victims to pay using different psychological\n\n7 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Moreover, affiliates are expected to be in a constant effort to\nbreach new targets. Whenever an affiliate becomes inactive for a long period of time, RaaS\nowners remove the account of that affiliate, which also effects their reputation.\n\n### 3 Technical Analysis\n\nThis section contains technical analysis of the LockBit ransomware as a service (RaaS)\nplatform including the management panel, ransomware sample, decryptor software, and\nthe step-by-step analysis of a LockBit attack kill chain. This section also contains intelligence\nabout the threat actors (developers and affiliates) using LockBit service and their TTP analysis.\n\n#### 3.1 The LockBit Attack Kill Chain\n\nThe following steps will briefly explain the overall LockBit attack kill chain. Every technique,\ntactic, and procedure is based on the LockBit service affiliates at the time of the PTI Team\ninvestigation. The attack vectors and every kind of actor-specific behaviour can be different\nin every LockBit attack, given that LockBit is a RaaS platform.\n\n**3.1.1** **Target Selection**\n\nRansomware operators use multiple methods for selecting their next potential target. LockBit\naffiliates use mass vulnerability scanning, phishing, and credential stuffing[9] as main sources\nfor finding new victims. According to our investigation, the most frequent method used by\nthe LockBit group is to buy already-compromised servers & RDP accesses from underground\nshops. Such credentials can be purchased for as low as $5, thus making it very lucrative for\naffiliates considering the demanded ransom amount. During the LockBit investigation, the\nPTI Team was also able to identify a couple of the attack vectors used for mass vulnerability\nscanning by the LockBit affiliates. According to the chat logs between the LockBit affiliates\nand multiple victims, the Fortinet VPN exploit [7] was one of the most used methods to gain\naccess to the target company networks.\n\n8 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3. LockBit affiliate explaining the used attack vector**\n\nThe PTI Team was also able to contact multiple LockBit victim companies. Based on the\nforensic analysis of the victim companies, the PTI Team came to the conclusion that LockBit\naffiliates also use generic phishing campaigns and credential stuffing attacks for gaining\naccess to the target company servers.\n\n**3.1.2** **Preparation**\n\nAfter gaining access to the target company servers, LockBit affiliates usually starts the\nenumeration process. According to our forensic investigations on multiple LockBit victims, the\nPTI Team observed that before launching the LockBit ransomware, attackers tries to identify\nmission critical systems such as domain controllers, backup servers or NAS devices. Once\nthe necessary enumeration is done by the attackers, the data exfiltration phase begins. The\nLockBit attackers evaluate the data inside the breached system and decide whether it is\nimportant for the target company. The critical data gets exfiltrated by the attackers and\nuploaded to free file upload services such as MEGA. Uploaded data are used for extortion\nwhile negotiating with the victims.\n\n9 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Exfiltrated data used for extortion**\n\nAfter the data exfiltration phase, a unique LockBit ransomware sample is generated\nfrom the build page of the LockBit management panel. The build page of the LockBit\nmanagement panel is shown in the following image.\n\n**Figure 5. LockBit management panel build page**\n\nAffiliates are able to build unique ransomware samples by entering an explanatory comment.\nThe build comments are used for identifying the victims and their systems. Usually LockBit\n\n10 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\naffiliates enter the target company name as a comment. Once the victim company starts a\ndialog with their unique session key, the chat session is tagged with the corresponding build\ncomment on the LockBit management panel database.\n\n**3.1.3** **Deployment and Execution**\n\nIn this step, the LockBit ransomware generated by the affiliates is executed manually inside\nthe target company systems. Once the LockBit ransomware is executed in a system, it will\nimmediately begin the reconnaissance phase. In this phase of the ransomware attack. The\nLockBit sample will try to enumerate all the accessible directories and network shares inside\nthe target system.\nAfter the enumeration LockBit ransomware encrypts each file with a random AES key,\nwhich is encrypted with the static public key inside the LockBit sample. Finally encrypted AES\nkey is inserted into a specific offset inside the file. Thus every file inside the target system is\nencrypted with a different key, and each file can only be opened by the randomly generated\nRSA private key during the build of the unique sample on the management panel.\n\n**Figure 6. LockBit ransomware working logic**\n\n**3.1.4** **Demand and Negotiation**\n\nAt the end of the ransomware execution phase, all important files of the victim are encrypted,\nbackups are deleted, and the system wallpaper is changed to the following image.\n\n11 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7. Victim desktop after LockBit attack**\n\nAs described in the wallpaper image, LockBit ransomware creates ”Restore-My-Files.txt” and\n”LockBit-note.hta” files on the target system desktop. The HTA file is executed automatically\nupon creation. The ”LockBit-note.hta” file is a well-designed HTML page explaining the\nsituation and ways to contact the LockBit attackers for purchasing a decryptor software.\n\n**Figure 8. LockBit ransom note inside the victim’s system**\n\nAccording to the ransom note, the **http://lockbit-decryptor.top/** and\n**http://lockbitks2tvnmwk.onion/ websites contain further instructions for purchasing**\na decryptor software. The ransom note also contains instructions about installing a TOR\nbrowser in order to access the LockBit’s ONION web page. During the time of the PTI Team’s\ninvestigation, lockbit-decryptor.top domain was no longer active. The links inside the ransom\n\n12 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Once\nthe victims visit the LockBit website with the given unique link, they are greeted with the\nfollowing page.\n\n**Figure 9. LockBit victims’ landing page**\n\nThe LockBit contact page contains ”CHAT WITH SUPPORT” and ”TRIAL DECRYPT” sections.\nVictims are expected to get in contact with the LockBit attacker using the chat window\nregarding the purchase of the decryptor software. Once a victim sends a message over\ntheir unique contact URL, a new victim tab with the corresponding build comment shows\nup on the LockBit management panel dashboard. The ”TRIAL DECRYPT” section inside the\nvictim dashboard allows the victims to decrypt a single file with a size smaller than 256KB.\nThis particular file must originate from the system with the corresponding ID (unique contact\nURL). The LockBit panel automatically checks whether the given file actually belongs to\nthe corresponding victim ID and then serves the decrypted file to the victim. This feature\nensures the victims that LockBit attackers are able to decrypt their files successfully and in\nan automated fashion.\n\n#### 3.2 Management Panel\n\nDuring the investigation, the PTI Team was able to detect and gain access to some parts of\nthe LockBit RaaS infrastructure. The LockBit infrastructure consists of a management panel\nhosted as a TOR hidden service website with the address http://lockbitaptku3l2q.onion/.\nThe management panel is mainly used for managing victims, affiliate accounts, generating\nnew ransomware builds, and serving the decryptor software if the demanded ransom is\npayed.\n\n13 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

LockBit management panel login page**\n\nAs described in the previous step, the main dashboard of the LockBit management panel\ncontains the chat window. As can be seen in the following image, the LockBit affiliate often\nstarts the conversation with a prepared text that explains the situation briefly and informs\nthe victims about the current decryptor price, payment deadline, payment method (BTC),\nand instructions about how to obtain bitcoin for payment.\n\n**Figure 11. LockBit management panel chat page**\n\nAffiliates also explain the ”TRIAL DECRYPT” mechanism to the victims because the trial decrypt\nstep is mandatory for purchasing the decryptor software. Each victim must upload a file for\ntrial decrypt in order to get the decryptor software. This mechanism prevents third-party\nintervention and ensures that the negotiator actually has access to the victim’s files. On the\nchat window there is a victim details button that displays the victim master and session keys,\nfirst and last visit dates, total views, build date, and build comments. The following image\ncontains the mentioned victim details window.\n\n14 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

LockBit management panel victim details**\n\nThe LockBit affiliates can also view their current victim’ statistic on the management panel\nstatistics page. The page contains a view chart, recently visited victims, and recently\nuploaded test files. The affiliates are able download the decrypted victim test files from this\npage.\n\n**Figure 13. LockBit management panel statistics page**\n\nFinally, inside the affiliate management dashboard chat window there is a ”Decrypt” button\nfor automatically generating the decryptor for that particular LockBit victim. In order to\nsuccessfully generate the decryptor, victims need to upload an encrypted file for trial\ndecryption. Once the decryptor is generated for that particular victim, the chat session gets\nremoved from the LockBit affiliate’s dashboard and the conversation ends.\n\n15 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

LockBit management panel victim decrypt button**\n\nAnother role of the LockBit management panel is managing the affiliate accounts. When\nthe admin user logs into the management panel, the user is greeted with extra ”Users”,\n”BlogPost”, ”PhpMyAdmin” pages for adding new affiliate accounts, publishing new blog post\nentries and accessing the PhpMyAdmin panel.\n\n**Figure 15. LockBit admin user panel menu**\n\nThe admin user is also able to view every affiliate chat session inside the main dashboard\nof the management panel. The statistics page also includes all victim page views of every\naffiliate account when logged in with the admin user.\n\n**Figure 16. LockBit admin user dashboard**\n\n16 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

The PhpMyAdmin panel is found at\naddress http://lockbitaptku3l2q.onion/bfdnffektc/.\n\n#### 3.3 LockBit Decryptor\n\nOnce the decrypt button is pressed for a victim on the management panel, a unique\ndecryptor EXE file is generated for that particular victim’s ID (master an session keys). If\nthe victim used the trial decryption attempt, the generated decryptor software link will be\ndisplayed at the bottom of the victim’s chat page. From this point, victims can download\nthe decryptor EXE file and run inside their encrypted systems for decrypting their files.\n\n**Figure 17. Enabled LockBit decryptor link inside the victim chat dashboard**\n\nAccording to the PTI Team analysis, decryptor software successfully decrypts the locked files\ninside the victim’s system without performing any malicious activity.\n\n#### 3.4 De-Anonymization\n\nThe PTI Team also focused on revealing the identity of the LockBit affiliates, retailers, and\ndevelopers. The management panel analysis revealed much information about the LockBit\naffiliates. As described in Section 3.2, the admin user is able to view and manage affiliate\naccounts on the system. As can be seen in the following image, every affiliate account is\ncreated with a Jabber contact address.\n\n17 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Almost all of the victims are enterprise\ncorporations. The average ransom amount is calculated to be roughly $85,000.\n\n**Figure 20. Sector distribution of victims**\n\nVictim sector distribution does not show a significant value for the investigation as criminal\ngroups buy accesses and scan vulnerable hosts almost in a random fashion. We can see that\nmore than 20% of the victims were operating in the software and services sector. Commercial\nand professional services as well as the transportation sector were also highly targeted by\nthe LockBit group. However, it should be noted that the value of the ransom is determined\nby the affiliate after various checks using online services. This value does not solely depend\non the sector of the victim.\n\n21 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Victim page view statistics**\n\nPage view statistics show us who the ransomware victims are . We can clearly see that the\nactivity peaked around the beginning of May 2021. The indicator also shows that on the 11th of\nMay, there were no page views. This might be caused by a fault, system upgrade, or a possible\nDDOS attack. Several other ransomware groups were also presented in global articles around\nthese times, which might be another indicator of a possible server upgrade/transfer. The\nserver became active after the 12th of May, and the activity increased for the following week.\nAs the TOR hidden server reroutes the traffic to 127.0.0.1, the unique IP count is shown as 0\non most of the dates. Several deviations present local page hits (mainly from the developer\nside).\n\n#### 4.1 Known Recruiter Profiles\n\nRansomware groups hire several people from deepweb/darknet forums to attract new\naffiliates into their network. These recruiters generally create topics in well-known forums\nand discussion boards. In order to become an affiliate, one must have high skills, motivation,\nand good references who can verify the candidate. In the following examples, we present\nseveral ”Call for Application” posts written by the LockBit recruiters.\nOn average, affiliates gain between 10%-30% commission from each ransom payment.\n\n#### 4.2 Psychological analysis\n\n”Do you accept the terms of the contract?”\n\nIt bears all the hallmarks of the final sentence of a success business conversation – albeit\npreceded by :\n\n”ALL YOUR DATA IS ENCRYPTED. To recover the data, you need a decryptor. The cost of the\ndecryptor is 1000 US dollars. Payment is accepted only in bitcoins. After payment, you will\nreceive a decryptor and instructions on how to counteract hacking. Your data will be\nrestored within 15-30 minutes. Do you accept the terms of the contract?”\n\nThe sense of panic is spreading. Perhaps your whole business is thrown down a black hole,\nand since you want to save your business and the data it has generated in terms of business\nintelligence, you engage with the organised group whose business idea happens to be a\n\n22 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

They prey on the notion that your livelihood is under threat and you expect to\nsave it. Victim shaming is a powerful tool of persuasion.\n\nLooking at Figure 9, one can not note the ”business as usual” atmosphere that is conveyed.\nThere ”What” and ”How” boxes adequately describe what happened and how you can\nsolve it. Like any proper vendor they offer a sample of their product – the victim is given an\nopportunity to “TRIAL DECRYPT” one of the ransomed files. Similar to regular businesses they\noffer ”CHAT WITH SUPPORT”, should you have any questions ...\n\nWe managed to acquire chat logs between the two parties i.e. the victims of extortion and\nthe perpetrators. In most cases, they start with the message above or a similar one and\nfollow a certain pattern : from duress, threats, and prof of data and payment instructions to\n(almost) friendly advice.\n\nOnce the initial sense of helplessness settles, the victims reach out through the platform –\nthe chat forum – provided by the extortionists. What follows is rather a normal conversation\nbetween two parties engaged in negotiations :\n\nNegotiations :\n\n”name the amount you are willing to pay”\n\n”If you offer the amount and it suits us, we will make a deal”\n\nDuress and threats :\n\n”If you do not make a payment within 72 hours, we will start posting...”\n\n”I will accept your offer if you pay within 12 hours! Hurry up!”\n\n”24 hours for payment, then the amount will increase to $30,000”\n\nand :\n\n23 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Do not try to decrypt files with any other programs! This is not possible and can\nonly damage your files!”\n\n”Don’t mess with us”\n\nTo further their business case the perpetrators offer proof :\n\n”Here’s a little proof that we’ve got hold of your data”\n\nfollowed by a link.\n\nPayment instructions :\n\n”You can only pay with bitcoin. You can guide them through...”\n\nfollowed by specific instructions and bitcoin wallet information.\n\nOnce the victim has provided the wallet to the perpetrators, they start to stall before they\nengage in ransom jacking, from the simple\n\n”wait” to\n\n”the key production time is from 12 to 24 hours”\n\nThey also try to come across as if they are doing you a favor, similar to a regular business\ntransaction such as purchasing a insurance :\n\n”After the payment, we will tell you the vulnerability and you will close it. A second attack\nwill be excluded”\n\nGenerally the conversations follow a pattern of standardised answers as seen above,\nhowever one cannot refrain from thinking that they may be Star Wars fans : ”Look for options,\n_time you have.”_\n\nCrime as a service (CaaS) is in this case manifested as ransomware as a service (RaaS) –\na service provided by computer experts who happen to be part of criminal networks. It\nis beyond the scope of this report to further describe the underworld of organised crime.\nHowever, this is a highly organised and well-developed undertaking.\n\nThe chat logs indicate a pattern, comparable to a regular telemarketing call, where the\nindividual perpetrators have the freedom to offer discounts and manage deadlines while\nstill being in control. Considering the nature of the organizational chart of organised\n\n24 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

As for the victims, they all have their account\nof what happened and the reason for accepting to pay the ransom. Regardless of the\ncircumstances and the justification for agreeing, paying ransom continues to fuel the industry.\n\n”We appreciate your patience and understanding”\n\n### 5 Money Flow\n\nDuring our analysis, we investigated some of the wallet addresses and investigated\nthe money flow throughout the blockchain. We observed that the crime group frequently\nuses CoinJoin mixing techniques (Wasabi wallet) and several money-laundering services to\nobfuscate their transactions. In addition to that, closer inspection of the transactions shows\nsome of the money has been converted into different cryptocurrencies (Monero, Zcash) using\nprevalent exchangers like Changenow, Simpleswap, etc. These results provide further support\nfor the idea that KYC/AML procedures are inadequate to stop the ransom payments due to\nthe nature of the operation.

Besides, the recent Colonial Pipeline attack showed how these attacks could be\ndangerous in the physical world, apart from the cyber domain. In this report, we presented\nthe inner workings of one of the best-known ransomware group and helped many victims\nrecover their data. However, rapid acceptance of cryptocurrencies and shifting to remote\nwork will significantly increase these ransomware attacks in the near future. In order to\ndisrupt the operation of cybercriminals while tackling complex challenges, public and private\nbodies need to work collaboratively. We believe that our research will shed light on the inner\nstructures of the cybercriminals and help others to identify the LockBit operatives’ external\nconnections (like ReVil) as a part of a broader investigation. As we also presented in our\nresearch that some of the affiliates do not bother to decrypt the victim’s files even if they\nwere paid in full. Cybercriminals should not be trusted. We advise all potential victims not to\npay any ransom and report the incident to the authorities immediately. We also advise to\nfollow other ransomware prevention initiatives such as ”The No More Ransom Project” [8] to\nget an up-to-date information about recent cases and decryption opportunities.\n\n28 / 31\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.
