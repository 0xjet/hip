These tools often combine functionality normally associated with\npackers and crypters and, in many cases, are not directly tied to the malware payload itself. Over\nthe past several months we have observed a series of campaigns that leverage a new version of\none of these tools, referred to as 3LOSH crypter. The threat actor(s) behind these campaigns\nhave been using 3LOSH to generate the obfuscated code responsible for the initial infection\nprocess. Based on analysis of the embedded configuration stored within the samples associated\nwith these campaigns, we have identified that the same operator is likely distributing a variety of\ncommodity RATs, such as AsyncRAT and LimeRAT. These RATs feature various functionality that\nenables them to be used to gain access to systems and exfiltrate sensitive information from\nvictims.\n\n## Infection process\n\nThe infection process begins with an ISO that contains a malicious VBScript that, when executed,\n\n\n-----\n\ninitiates a multi-stage infection process. The file naming convention for the ISO and the VBS\nmatch and typically follow a convention consistent with the following:\n```\n^[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{6}\\.(VBS|ISO)$\n\n### Stage 1 Execution\n\n```\nThe VBS contains junk data and uses string replacement to attempt to obfuscate the executed\ncode. An example of this is shown below.\n\n_Obfuscated VBS._\n\nOnce deobfuscated, the VBS execution is straightforward: It retrieves and executes the next\nstage from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n_Deobfuscated VBS._\n\n### Stage 2 retrieval\n\nAs expected, the retrieved content is a PowerShell script passed to the Invoke-Expression (IEX)\ncmdlet and executed to continue the infection process. It is mainly responsible for creating a\nseries of scripts that are executed and carry out various tasks needed for the malware to\nfunction.\n\nAcross various samples analyzed, the directory locations and file names vary, but are functionally\nequivalent.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, the script checks for the existence of a directory at the following location:\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Facebook\\System32\\Microsoft\\SystemData\n\n```\nIf it doesn't already exist, the directory is created. This folder is used as the working directory for\nthe malware and stores all the components used throughout the rest of the infection process. The\nscript then creates several additional scripts, writing content into each of them using a format\nsimilar to the following example.\n\n_Script creation code example._\n\nThe following files are created in this manner:\n\nOffice.bat\nOffice.vbs\nOffice.ps1\nMicrosofd.bat\nMicrosofd.vbs\nMicrosofd.ps1\n\nAll of these scripts are stored in the previously created directory.\n\n_Malicious script components._\n\nFinally, the Stage 2 PowerShell executes \"Office.vbs\" to begin the next step of the infection\nprocess.\n\n_VBS execution._\n\n### Stage 3 operations\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 3 is responsible for the majority of malicious activities performed on infected systems. The\nfirst script, \"Office.vbs,\" is executed by the Stage 2 PowerShell and invokes WScript to execute a\nbatch file called \"Office.bat\" to continue the infection process.\n\n_WScript batch file execution._\n\nThis batch file, in turn, executes a PowerShell script called 'Office.ps1'.\n\n_PowerShell script execution._\n\nThe next PowerShell script attempts to achieve persistence by creating a new Scheduled Task\ncalled \"Office\" that is executed immediately and then repeated every two minutes, as shown\nbelow.\n\n_Scheduled task creation._\n\nThis scheduled task then executes \"Microsofd.vbs\" as part of the creation process. This next\nVBS initiates a short sleep before continuing. It is only responsible for executing \"Microsofd.bat\"\nto continue the infection process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_WScript execution._\n\nThis next batch file only contains a single line, which invokes PowerShell and executes\n'Microsofd.ps1'\n\n_PowerShell_\n\n_execution._\n\nThis PowerShell script is the final script executed in this chain. It was written by the Stage 2\nPowerShell, along with the other scripts that we've described. This script contains two large GZIP\nblobs and another function responsible for decompressing them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Stage 3 decompression function._\n\nOne of the blobs is an injector and the other is the final payload that is injected and executed.\nThis is accomplished by invoking aspnet_compiler.exe, injecting the final payload, and executing\nit.\n\n_Stage 3 injection process._\n\nThe diagram below shows the execution flow.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infection flow diagram._\n\nThe final payload varied across samples analyzed, the majority of which were AsyncRAT and\nLimeRAT. Based on the RAT configuration embedded in the samples, we believe with high\nconfidence that the same threat actor(s) are likely leveraging both RATs in these campaigns.\n\n### Links to 3LOSH crypter\n\nDuring our analysis of the samples, infrastructure and final payloads associated with these\ncampaigns, we identified several characteristics that indicated a new version of the 3LOSH\nbuilder/crypter used to obfuscate the RAT payloads and facilitate the infection process. 3LOSH\n[crypter is a malware crypter we previously analyzed here.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/rat-campaign-targets-latin-america.html)\n\nIn analyzing the code execution of the Stage 2 PowerShell, we noticed some similarities with\nlater stages of the infection process described in our previous analysis of the 3LOSH builder. The\ncode present in our initial sample set featured a significant amount of similarities and overlap with\nsamples we identified associated with a new version of 3LOSH. This new version of the crypter\nfeatures the following notable changes from previous versions.\n\nBinary payloads are now embedded using GZIP compression rather than simply Base64\nencoded and scripts feature a decompression function that is the same across both sample\nclusters.\nThe infection chain is more complicated, featuring the use of multiple script-based\ncomponents (BAT, VBS, PS1) that facilitate the infection process.\n\nWhile there are also differences between the two clusters, this may be due to the threat actor\nonly utilizing the portion of the builder output required for their purposes, or this may be due to\noptions selected during the build process. Additionally, while analyzing our original sample cluster\nand new samples created using the 3LOSH crypter, we identified several final payloads in both\nclusters that use the same infrastructure for post-compromise C2 communications.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Matching RAT configs in both sample clusters._\n\nWhile analyzing one of the AsyncRAT payloads in our original sample cluster, we also observed\nthat the Group_ID in the embedded RAT configuration was set to \"3LOSH.\"\n\n_3LOSH group identifier_\n\n3LOSH continues to be under active development and in use by threat actors distributing a\nvariety of commodity RATs. We expect that this activity will continue and organizations should\nensure they maintain the ability to detect malicious activity associated with 3LOSH, independent\nof the final payload itself.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThese malware distribution campaigns have been ongoing for the past several months, with new\nsamples being uploaded to public repositories on a daily basis. The 3LOSH crypter continues to\nbe actively maintained and improved by its author and will likely continue to be used by various\nthreat actors attempting to evade detection in corporate environments. Organizations should be\naware that even commodity malware can take advantage of the complexity and evasiveness\noffered by crypters to increase their operational effectiveness as adversaries attempt to leverage\nthem to achieve their mission objectives. A layered defense-in-depth security architecture should\nbe implemented to ensure that organizations maintain the ability to successfully defend against\nthese threats.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[the malware detailed in this post.
