It is under constant\ndevelopment, with several updated versions appearing since the original samples were observed in\nJune 2017. The growing number of samples demonstrate that criminals are actively adopting this\n[malware. Ovidiy Stealer is priced at 450-750 Rubles (~$7-13 USD) for one build, a price that includes a](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\nprecompiled executable that is also \"crypted\" to thwart analysis and detection.\n\nIt should be noted that some antivirus solutions are detecting Ovidiy Stealer with generic and heuristic\nsignatures only. With only heuristic detection, it is possible that an AV solution will detect the behavior of\nOvidiy Stealer but label it in logs with a generic description and thus SOC analysts monitoring alerts\nmay well see the event but not recognize its significance. Instead, Ovidiy Stealer could be active an\norganization's network, throwing alerts but not identified specifically.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nWe believe that Ovidiy Stealer is currently being spread via email as executable attachments,\ncompressed executable attachments, and links to an executable download. It is also likely spread via\nfile hosting / cracking / keygen sites, where it poses as other software or tools. In several cases, we\nobserved the Ovidiy Stealer bundled with a “LiteBitcoin” installer, further validating this claim.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: This file, spread as “litebitcoin-qt.zip,” bundles Ovidiy Stealer and another RAT, Remote_\n_Manipulator System by TektonIT. While the software is installing both malware samples begin to reach_\n_out to the Command and Control (C&C) servers ovidiystealer[.]ru and rmansys[.]ru._\n\n_[Update 7/14/2017: The content of this site has been removed since this article was published. The site_\n_itself appears to still be online.]_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: This file, spread as “Chase SoftWare 1.2 Jora.exe” appears to be an account checker for_\n_various financial institutions (that is, a hacking tool), that was bundled with Ovidiy_\n\nOther observed filenames are listed below and include game lures, hack tool lures, social network lures\nand others:\n\n- ideMiner.zip\n\n- kHackTool.zip\n\n- pdate_teamspeak3.5.1.exe\n\n- ORLD OF TANKS 2017.txt.exe\n\n- ice_bot.exe\n\n- heat v5.4.3 2017.exe\n\n- k.com BulliTl.exe\n\n**Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the time of writing, we have observed versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.5 distributed in the wild. Ovidiy\nStealer is written in .NET and most samples are packed with with either .NET Reactor or Confuser.\nUpon execution the malware will remain in the directory in which it was installed, and where it will carry\nout tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no persistence mechanism built into this malware, so on\nreboot it will cease to run, but the file will remain on the victim machine.\n\nOvidiy Stealer is modular and contains functionality to target a multiple applications -- primarily\nbrowsers -- listed below.\n\nFileZilla\nGoogle Chrome\nKometa browser\nAmigo browser\nTorch browser\nOrbitum browser\nOpera browser\n\nBecause a separate module carries out the targeting of each application, the fewer the modules\nselected, the smaller the malware payload size. Buyers can select as few as a single module, for\nexample just “Google Chrome”.\n\n_Figure 3: Example code displaying the targeted directories for Chromium based browsers_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Example displaying the code for locating and stealing stored FileZilla passwords_\n\nOvidiy Stealer utilizes SSL/TLS for communication with its command and control server. It currently\nutilizes the domain ovidiystealer[.]ru for its command and control (C&C) communications; which is is\nalso the domain used to market and sell the malware. The initial C&C beacon is a POST reporting the\nfollowing details:\n\nid: DiskID and ProcessorID\nver: Ovidiy Stealer version\ncn: Windows username\nos: Operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7)\nuser: Registered Ovidiy Stealer username\n\n_Figure 5: Network traffic capture of initial checkin beacon generated by the stealer_\n\nThe unique ID provided for each infected machine is a combination of the 8 character DiskID and 16\ncharacter ProcessorID, combined into one string. We observed a commonly hardcoded ProcessorID of\n“BFEBFBFF000206A7” being used if the function checking the ProcessorID resulted in an empty buffer,\nand at least one sample containing “Rofl” for that value. Ovidiy Stealer traffic also includes a hardcoded\nUser-Agent “E9BC3BD76216AFA560BFB5ACAF5731A3”. This is the md5 hash of the phrase 'litehttp',\nwhich is also the default User-Agent of the open-source LiteHTTP Bot.[1]. We believe that Ovidiy author\nreused the open-source code of the LiteHTTP Bot project.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Code reuse shown: Ovidiy Stealer on the left, LiteHTTP Bot on the right_\n\nIf the stealer is able to find passwords from targeted applications, it will follow up its initial checkin with\nanother request reporting the passwords of targeted applications:\n\nid: DiskID and ProcessorID\nsite: Website with saved credentials\nprogram: Targeted application\nlogin: Saved application username\npass: Saved application password\nuser: Registered Ovidiy Stealer username\n\nFigure 7: Network traffic capture of credentials exfiltration beacon generated by the stealer\n\n**Sales and Support**\n\nOvidiy Stealer is offered for sale on ovidiystealer[.]ru, a domain which will help attract potential\ncustomers and, as noted above, also the C&C domain. The malware boasts support, features, and login\naccess to the web panel. The admin panel for Ovidiy Stealer allows the botmaster to view statistics on\ninfected machines, view logs, build more stubs, and manage the account.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Ovidiy Stealer website landing page. Note the “We accept Free-Kassa” button._\n\n_Figure 9: Ovidiy Stealer admin panel_\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the admin console, the botmaster has the capabilities to view and filter logs from infected\nmachines.\n\n_Figure 10: Viewing Ovidiy Stealer client logs_\n\nTo simplify purchasing, the team behind Ovidiy Stealer uses a service known as 'RoboKassa' to collect\npayment for new stubs. RoboKassa is a Russian equivalent to PayPal, allowing users to conduct\npayment using credit cards and other types of payment to the sellers; in this case the seller is “Ovidiy”\n(Fig. 11).\n\n_Figure 11: Payment via RoboKassa offering several options_\n\n\n-----\n\nLike many other markets with many choices, the malware market is competitive and developers must\nmarket the strengths and benefits of their products in order to attract buyers. To help drive sales, the\ndevelopment team includes statistics on the progress of certain modules, and other plans for future\nreleases of the malware. In addition, the site includes “testimonials\" from satisfied customers,\npresumably to demonstrate to other would-be criminals that they can be profitable when using Ovidiy\nStealer.\n\n_Figure 12: Reviews and development progress. The user ACE’s comments translate to English as: “I_\n_only need the stealer for burglary on order. I explain what it is: I accept an order for the hijacking of a_\n_certain person's account. After I work with him and install the stealer. That's all, for one order I get 300-_\n_500 rubles. Without this project it would be impossible! Thank you!”_\n\nThe main author of this project goes by the handle \"TheBottle,\" evident from the informational page of\nthe Ovidiy Stealer website. Moreover, the name 'TheBottle' is observed in at least one sample's PDB\nstring:\n\n_C:\\Users\\TheBottle\\documents\\visual studio 2017\\Projects\\Ovidiy\\Ovidiy\\obj\\Debug\\Ovidiy.pdb_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: Self proclaimed author of Ovidiy Stealer, ‘TheBottle’, translated to English_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOvidiy Stealer is a new password stealer that entered the criminal ranks barely one month ago. While it\nis not the most advanced stealer we have seen, marketing and an entry-level price scheme make it\nattractive and accessible to many would-be criminals. Ovidiy Stealer is lightweight and simple enough to\nwork with relative ease, allowing for simple and efficient credential exfiltration. A lightweight, easy-touse, and effective product coupled with frequent updates and a stable support system give Ovidiy\nStealer the potential to become a much more widespread threat. Stolen credentials continue to be a\nmajor risk for individuals and organizations, because password re-use can enable one stolen login to\ncompromise several more accounts, and the sale of stolen accounts continues to be a lucrative market\nfor criminal looking for quick profits. Ovidiy Stealer highlights the manner in the cybercrime marketplace\ndrives innovation and new entrants and challenges organizations that must keep pace with the latest\nthreats to their users, their data, and their systems.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\novidiystealer.ru Domain Ovidiy\nStealer C&C\n\n\n-----\n\n7de66557dacbabe5228faa294c357ad02c9f07eb2395229f209776bc9a09dfb4 SHA256 Litebitcoinqt.zip Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n3ddc17470fb86dcb4b16705eb78bcbcb24dce70545f512ce75c4a0747474ef52 SHA256 Chase\nSoftWare\n1.2 Jora.exe\nOvidiy\nStealer\n\n5a44126ea4c5c9bbc3c44fec0346c3071b55fb6abb10ad3299590a3b0e2a8fc7 SHA256 Uber.exe\nOvidiy\nStealer\n\n8d70877b4014a726e64d3338c454489628a78dcee3e533152ff2223e3bdec506 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\nd469e7f2531eed4c3f418a71acdbd08dd167409047812ab78f5407730d077792 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\nd5711ac689d2cae77d19fab19768870adec983e4cdbd04f58d77828ef61eec88 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\na18fce17e57b324b8552ac8ff34a912a6788be028988288d9b6752c7911a0936 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\nc16408967de0ca4d3a1d28530453e1c395a5166b469893f14c47fc6683033cb3 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n255899d86d58a95499473046fcb6ad821ac500af8679635487d9003ba0f7b3ec SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n2a54eb17cc418da37fa3a45ceb840882bf1800909753e6431c2e3b0fcef4308a SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n84097d78bc73c9d8b4d7f4751c0dbb79da5d8883bd0fd27194cc21e05fdbca04 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\nc0bf76eee1a42607236652151e1ff67a5e058e780e487d18e946dad6c2084f5d SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\nd733dbd549111ecfb732da39bd67d47c631a0b15b2fb4e8ff446b63088cd4ed4 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n\n-----\n\n062bd1d88e7b5c08444de559961f68694a445bc69807f57aa4ac581c377bc432 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n80d450ca5b01a086806855356611405b2c87b3822c0c1c38a118bca57d87c410 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n22fc445798cd3481018c66b308af8545821b2f8f7f5a86133f562b362fc17a05 SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n8542a49b3b927d46fefae743b61485004a3540a4e204ee882028a85f08f4b3ee SHA256 Ovidiy\nStealer\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage**\n\n2827113 | Observed DNS Query to Ovidiy Stealer CnC Domain\n\n2827114 | MSIL/Ovidiy Stealer CnC Checkin\n\n2827115 | MSIL/Ovidiy Stealer Reporting Passwords\n\n2820681 | ETPRO TROJAN W32/XPCSpyPro/RemoteManipulator RAT Checkin\n\n2808335 | ETPRO POLICY Win32/RemoteAdmin.RemoteUtilities.C Checkin\n\n2811005 | ETPRO POLICY RADMINRMS.WIN32.1 Checkin POST\n\n_References:_\n\n[1] https://github.com/zettabithf/LiteHTTP/\n\n**SaveSave**\n\n**SaveSave**\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
