However, this latest campaign is somewhat\nunique due to a custom variant of a TrickBot module that (to date) is only associated with this\ncampaign.\n\nThe WIZARD SPIDER threat group is the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware.\nThis group represents a growing criminal enterprise of which GRIM SPIDER appears to be a\nsubset. The LUNAR SPIDER threat group is the Eastern European-based operator and developer\nof the [commodity banking malware called BokBot (aka IcedID), which was first observed in April](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/digging-into-bokbots-core-module/)\n2017. The BokBot malware provides LUNAR SPIDER affiliates with a variety of capabilities to\nenable credential theft and wire fraud, through the use of webinjects and a malware distribution\nfunction.\n\nCampaigns involving both BokBot and TrickBot were first identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence in\nJuly 2017. In these campaigns, victim machines infected with BokBot issued a command to\ndownload and execute a TrickBot payload. A somewhat sporadic relationship between the two\nadversaries has continued since then, although this most recent campaign likely signals a more\nintimate phase of that relationship.\n\n## TrickBot Distribution\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2019, LUNAR SPIDER s BokBot project ID `C610DF9A was seen downloading and`\nexecuting a loader from `http://tfulf[.]host/Sw9HJmXzq.exe. The custom loader`\nsubsequently downloaded a TrickBot loader from `http://185.68.93[.]30/sin.png . The`\nconfiguration file of this sample indicates it is TrickBot version 1000351 and belongs to the group\ntag (gtag) `sin2. The gtags with a prefix of` `sin have been related to LUNAR SPIDER activity`\nas the successor to the previously associated `mom gtag prefix.`\n\nThe full TrickBot configuration file, including command-and-control (C2) servers, can be seen\nbelow.\n\n```\n<srv>181.129.93[.]226:449</srv>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n     <srv>170.79.176[.]242:449</srv>\n   </servs>\n   <autorun>\n     <module name=\"systeminfo\" ctl=\"GetSystemInfo\"/>\n     <module name=\"injectDll\"/>\n     <module name=\"pwgrab\"/>\n   </autorun>\n</mcconf>\n\n## Modified TrickBot Module\n\n```\nThis activity follows the previous pattern of BokBot assisting in the delivery of TrickBot. However,\nthe most interesting thing about the custom loader is the embedded, Base64-encoded Portable\nExecutable (PE) file shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Base64-Encoded PE File\n\nThe embedded PE file is extracted by the custom loader, then decoded and executed. Analysis\nrevealed that this decoded PE file is, in fact, a modified version of the TrickBot [lateral movement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/lateral-movement/)\nmodule `shareDll . Typically, TrickBot modules are downloaded as a dynamic link library (DLL)`\nwith a standard set of exports, named `Start, Control and` `Release . This DLL would then be`\ninjected into a child `svchost.exe process within the TrickBot modular framework. However, in`\nthe absence of this framework, the `shareDll module distributed by BokBot is a PE file.`\n\nIn addition, the strings within a standard TrickBot module are not obfuscated or protected in any\nway. However, the module distributed by BokBot contains strings that are both encrypted with 256bit AES, with a derived key and initialization vector (IV), and Base64-encoded with the custom\nalphabet of `terKSDozBw1l24IyCL6AHh/+5WRiGnj3xJQ8YkEbcgOZVNPamMsuUTpd0q9vFfX7. The`\nstrings are stored in an encrypted string table (shown in Figure 2) in the exact same way as the\nmain TrickBot loader, and decrypted when they are needed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Custom Base64 Alphabet and Encrypted Strings\n\nTable 1 below outlines the key identified differences between the two variants of the shareDll\nmodule.\n\n**BokBot Distributed shareDll** **TrickBot Distributed shareDll**\n\nPE file DLL file\n\nObfuscated Little or no obfuscation\n\nNo exports Start, Control, and Release exports\n\nTable 1. Compares Key Differences Between Two Variants of ShareDLL\n\nThe primary function of the `shareDll module in both cases is to attempt lateral movement within`\nthe victim’s network, to reach machines accessible by the currently logged-on user. In the BokBot\ndistributed instance, once an accessible machine has been located, the modified spreader module\nwill attempt to download the TrickBot loader located at `http://185.68.93[.]30/sin.png or`\n```\nhttp://185.68.93[.]30/win.png and install TrickBot on the accessible network machine.\n\n```\nThe whole process of BokBot installing TrickBot on the local machine and moving laterally around\nthe network is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. BokBot Installation of TrickBot and Lateral Movement Using ShareDll\n\n## Renamed Modules\n\nBeginning on Feb. 8, 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed further development in this\nintriguing relationship when renamed TrickBot modules were delivered to victims of the gtags\n```\nsin2 and sin4 . These gtags have been closely associated with LUNAR SPIDER activity. The\n\n```\nrenamed modules and their respective SHA256 hashes are shown in Table 2 and contain the\nstrings `sin, tin, and` `win .`\n\n**Module Name** **Module SHA256 Hash**\n```\n sharesinDll32 eefd209ba6afff5830d5510e68b2af90df200550d8ca4c40029baa93a0f01999\n sharesinDll32 1b84f604847be0dbdf19ca169deb22b0245ca6f4bc2877b7a0ceeffa0436d7b3\n sharesinDll32 ea3c70d82f3b4fe8d0914cc58669da0f3f116aa20f0661d68f826fd55763ef50\n sharesinDll64 93da209d2fdb49df19b53089bb1820aa0183e9f207ea87b51b49faa74f8e76ba\n sharesinDll64 915e416576be4b459c19941cc86a84fb0d66f54964552be0f69045b89323d2f7\n sharesinDll64 6d8551194b12655b4605f046a754257f69b1ee250f21e32466db54797a45c7c0\n tabtinDll32 aa074b7a1ce29abd9141dc18ca603f2ed2764ae1afabb92eb2f9e4dc008d99d6\n tabtinDll32 ba5bd732466a41636217b639a7a2aff1038a80bc29bd80c0532609d53297051f\n tabtinDll64 7023bbd875635b35fdc0eba303143be76afb50c0f34e8d79e8d0daba1d984b60\n tabtinDll64 13b8ab8ce0aa9db161c065c6bf2fdbb50c6fd82fe48e4576abc4b8c3136f925e\n wormwinDll32 cac2f117d8b4f1fc40dd0921ea91312ad8129df3556444e41fda8d27c81e02cd\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n wormwinDll32 d51644cefd34dd7e1ec32a3e0336f9c479c196527e8baea6e85937254cecfe99\n wormwinDll64 8c20b33374c280e9fd98113304843a339f738647cc13daf8f60312b9fef6b702\n wormwinDll64 e8ecceb0cbc0e6aefab5ac47a9e69f7926317d9e4f9a782b8df418c67a8d0661\n\n```\nTable 2. Renamed Modules and Associated SHA256 Hashes\n\nUnlike the changes identified in the TrickBot module `shareDll being distributed by BokBot, the`\nmodules `sharesinDll, tabtinDll, and` `wormwinDll remain functionally equivalent to the`\nTrickBot deployed modules `shareDll, tabDll, and` `wormDll, respectively, and retain the`\ntypical characteristics of a TrickBot module. More explicitly, the modules are DLLs, contain no\nencrypted strings, and have the standard TrickBot exports of `Start, Control, and` `Release .`\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon endpoint provides protection coverage against these threats through®\nbehavioral IOA and machine learning.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is unclear at this stage what purpose the module renaming serves, but it may be a method of\ntracking activity from those modules specifically associated with the aforementioned gtags.\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike Intelligence is exploring a possible connection between the TrickBot\naffiliate operating `sin -prefixed TrickBot gtags and the BokBot affiliate operating the project ID`\n```\nC610DF9A, due to the recent introduction of the previously mentioned custom TrickBot module. Of\n\n```\nnote, BokBot has aided the distribution of TrickBot, with the standard module set, through other\nBokBot project IDs for some time.\n\nAnother key point to note about this recent development is the historical relationship that previously\nexisted between the developers and operators of the banking malware families Dyre (aka Dyreza)\nand Neverquest (aka Vawtrak). This relationship is key because:\n\nWIZARD SPIDER includes members that were a part of the same group that had developed\nand operated Dyre.\nLUNAR SPIDER includes members that were a part of the same group that had developed\nand operated Neverquest.\n\nDespite being successful malware operations, both Dyre and Neverquest suddenly ceased\noperating in November 2015 and May 2017, respectively (Figure 4). LUNAR SPIDER had already\nintroduced BokBot to the criminal market at the time Neverquest operations ceased, suggesting\nthat the malware change may have been planned.\n\nConversely, the Dyre operation ceased following Russian law enforcement action in which the\noffices of a Moscow-based film and production company, named 25th Floor, were raided in\nNovember 2015. Although no details were released by Russian law enforcement, it was speculated\nthat the office played a part in the operation of Dyre. There was a one-year delay before the\nrelease of the TrickBot malware, which contains key similarities to the Dyre malware, but the\noperation was immediately successful and grew swiftly.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Timeline of Malware Operating Dates\n\nAlthough BokBot has aided the distribution of TrickBot since 2017, the development of custom\nTrickBot modules for the specific campaign has not been observed before. This significant\ndevelopment demonstrates a close relationship between the members of LUNAR SPIDER and\nWIZARD SPIDER. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the historical relationship established\nduring the operations of Dyre and Neverquest has been reinvigorated and solidified now that both\nWIZARD SPIDER and LUNAR SPIDER have established successful malware operations.\n\n## Appendix/Indicators\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n\n`http://tfulf[.]host/Sw9HJmXzq.exe` Custom loader\nURL\n\n`4ba234160cfbd1ef8ca2a259e51abdd4f6109ce74954fb7541d6226ec510b755` Custom loader\nSHA256\n\n`http://185.68.93[.]30/sin.png` TrickBot loader\nURL\n\n`http://185.68.93[.]30/win.png` TrickBot loader\nURL\n\n`d06432486e7e9c2b8aaef4f42c11cf8efe19689638a3512ce931a23bdb5f2b4c` TrickBot loader\nSHA256\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n185.246.64[.]237:443\n\n```\n\nTrickBot C2\nServers\n\nCustomized\n```\nshareDll\n\n```\nmodule\n\n```\n13b8ab8ce0aa9db161c065c6bf2fdbb50c6fd82fe48e4576abc4b8c3136f925e tabtinDll64\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n cac2f117d8b4f1fc40dd0921ea91312ad8129df3556444e41fda8d27c81e02cd wormwinDll32\n d51644cefd34dd7e1ec32a3e0336f9c479c196527e8baea6e85937254cecfe99 wormwinDll32\n 8c20b33374c280e9fd98113304843a339f738647cc13daf8f60312b9fef6b702 wormwinDll64\n e8ecceb0cbc0e6aefab5ac47a9e69f7926317d9e4f9a782b8df418c67a8d0661 wormwinDll64\n\n```\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Hear a comprehensive discussion of today’s top cyberthreats by CrowdStrike experts:_\n_[register for a webinar on the 2020 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n_[Read a report on Falcon X Automated Threat Intelligence and learn why actionable threat](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/falcon-x-intelligence-automation/)_\n_intelligence is the next step in SOC evolution._\n_Learn more about comprehensive endpoint protection with the CrowdStrike Falcon platform_\n_by_ _[visiting the product page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/)_\n_Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself.
