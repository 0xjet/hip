In\nthis blog we examine the latest developments in the Carbanak story.\n\n[Anton Cherepanov](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/acherepanov/)\n8 Sep 2015 - 10:49AM\n\nA few days ago, CSIS published details about new Carbanak samples found in the wild. In\nthis blog we examine the latest developments in the Carbanak story.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Carbanak financial APT group made the headlines when Group-IB and Fox-IT broke\n[the news in December 2014, followed by the Kaspersky report in February 2015. The two](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/)\nreports describe the same cybercriminal gang which stole up to several hundreds of millions\nof dollars from various financial institutions.\n\nHowever, the story is interesting not only because of the large amount of money stolen but\nalso from a technical point of view. The Carbanak team does not just blindly compromise\nlarge numbers of computers and try to ‘milk the cow’ as other actors do, instead they act\nlike a mature APT-group. They only compromise specific high-value targets and once inside\nthe company networks, move laterally to hosts that can be monetized.\n\nA few days ago CSIS [published details about new Carbanak samples found in the wild.](https://www.csis.dk/en/csis/blog/4710/)\n\nIn this blog we will describe the latest developments in the Carbanak story.\n\n## Casino hotel hack\n\nAt the end of August, we detected an attempt to compromise the network of a casino hotel\nin the USA. The infection vector used in this attack may have been a spearphishing e-mail\nwith a malicious attachment using an RTF-exploit or .SCR file. The attackers’ aim was to\ncompromise PoS servers used in payment processing.\n\nThe main backdoor used by attackers was the open-source Tiny Meterpreter. In this case,\nhowever, the source was modified – the process injection to svchost.exe was added to its\nfunctionality.\n\nThis Tiny Meterpreter backdoor dropped two different malware families:\n\n[Win32/Spy.Sekur – well known malware used by the Carbanak gang](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Spy.Sekur/detail)\n[Win32/Wemosis – a PoS RAM Scraper backdoor](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Wemosis/detail)\n\n[As mentioned here by our colleagues from TrendMicro, Carbanak malware is capable of](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/signed-pos-malware-used-in-pre-holiday-attacks-linked-to-targeted-attacks/)\ntargeting Epicor/NSB PoS systems, while Win32/Wemosis is a general-purpose PoS RAM\nScraper which targets any PoS that stores card data in the memory. The Wemosis\nbackdoor is written in Delphi and allows the attacker to control an infected computer\nremotely.\n\nBoth executables were digitally signed with the same certificate:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe certificate details:\n\nCompany name: Blik\n\nValidity: from 02 October 2014 to 03 October 2015\nThumbprint: 0d0971b6735265b28f39c1f015518768e375e2a3\n\nSerial number: 00d95d2caa093bf43a029f7e2916eae7fb\n\nSubject: CN = Blik\n\nO = Blik\n\nSTREET = Berzarina, 7, 1\n\nL = Moscow\n\nS = Moscow\n\nPostalCode = 123298\nC = RU\n\nThis certificate was also used in the digital signature of a third malware family used by the\nsame gang: [Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM.](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Spy.Agent.ORM/detail)\n\n**Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM – overview**\n\n_Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM (also known as Win32/Toshliph) is a trojan used as one of their first-_\nstage payloads by the Carbanak gang. The binary of the testing version was signed with a\n**Blik certificate: moreover, Spy.Agent.ORM shares some similarities in the code with “the**\nregular” Carbanak malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM malware family is already known in the industry because of two\n[blogposts. In July 2015 security company Cyphort reported the compromise of a news](http://www.cyphort.com/unicredit-compromised/)\n[portal and a banking site – rbc.ua and unicredit.ua. It turns out that the compromised sites](http://www.cyphort.com/unicredit-compromise-continued/)\nserved Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM. After that, Blue Coat [reported a spearphishing attempt](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2015-08-21/tinted-cve-decoy-spearphising-attempt-central-bank-armenia-employees)\ntargeting Central Bank of Armenia employees, the payload being the same.\n\nThis malware appeared on our radar at the beginning of summer 2015, and afterwards we\nstarted to track it.\n\nWe have seen attempts to attack various companies in Russia and Ukraine using\nspearphishing e-mails that have malicious attachments consisting of .SCR files or .RTF\nexploits.\n\nHere is an example of a spearphishing email sent to one of the biggest Forex-trading\ncompanies:\n\nRoughly translated from Russian to English, it says:\n\n_“Due to the high volatility of the ruble exchange rate the Bank of Russia sends rules of_\n_trading on the currency market. Password the attached document: cbr”_\n\nHere is another example of a spear phishing attempt. Email with this text was sent to the\nlargest electronic payment service in Russia:\n\n\n-----\n\nПостановлением Роскомнадзора от 04.08.2015г. Вам необходимо заблокировать\nматериалы попадающие под Федеральный закон от 27.07.2006 N 152-ФЗ (ред. от\n21.07.2014) “О персональных данных”. Перечень материалов в документе.\n\nПароль roscomnadzor\n\nAnother rough translation from Russian to English:\n\n_“According to Roscomnadzor prescript you should block the materials, which you can find in_\n_the attachment. Password is roscomnadzor”_\n\nWe have seen similar .SCR files with following filenames:\n\nАО «АЛЬФА-БАНК» ДОГОВОР.scr (Alfabank contract)\nПеречень материалов для блокировки от 04.08.2015г.scr (List to block)\nPostanovlene_ob_ustranenii_18.08.2015.pdf %LOTS_OF_SPACES% ..scr\nПравила Банка России от 06.08.2015.pdf %LOTS_OF_SPACES% .scr (Rules of\nBank of Russia)\n\nAll these attachments contained a password protected archive with .SCR file. The files had\nAdobe Acrobat reader icon or MS Word icons.\n\nIn other cases attackers used RTF files with different exploits, including an exploit for one of\nthe latest Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-1770, which was patched by Microsoft\n[in June 2015 in MS15-059.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-059.aspx)\n\nWe have seen RTF files with the following names used in attacks:\n\nprikaz-451.doc\nREMITTANCE ADVICE ON REJECTION.doc\nPROOF OF REMITTANCE ADVICE .doc\nHDHS739_230715_010711_A17C7148_INTERNAL.doc\nԲանկերի և բանկային գործունեության մասին ՀՀ օրենք 27.07.2015.doc (Armenian:\nThe Law on Banks and Banking 27.07.2015)\nPAYMENT DETAILS.doc\nАО «АЛЬФА-БАНК» ДОГОВОР.doc (Russian: Alpha-bank contract)\nAML REPORTS_20082015_APPLICATION FORM-USD-MR VYDIAR.doc\nAnti-Money Laudering & Suspicious cases.doc\nApplicationXformXUSDXduplicateXpayment.doc\nAML USD & Suspicious cases.doc\nAmendment inquiry ( reference TF1518869100.doc\nInformation 2.doc\n\nHere is example of a spearphishing message that was sent to a bank in the United Arab\nEmirates:\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is example of a spearphishing email that was sent to a German bank:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM – Technical details\n\nWin32/Spy.Agent.ORM is a small and simple backdoor that enables the attackers to assess\nthe victim. When executed the trojan connects to a C&C server and receives commands to\ngrab screenshots, enumerate running processes and get information about the system and\ncampaign ID. Based on that information malware operator decides whether the infected\ncomputer is useful: that is, whether it’s the intended target or just a system that was\naccidentally infected.\n\nHere is list of commands that it can receive from C&C server:\n\nCommand Purpose\n\n0x02 Collects information about computer: Computer Name, User Name,\nWindows Version, Architecture (32/64 bit) and campaign ID\n\n\n-----\n\n0x03 Collects list of running processes\n\n0x04 Downloads binary to %TEMP% and executes\n\n0x05 Updates itself\n\n0x06 Deletes itself\n\n0x07 Makes screenshot\n\n0x08 Loads binary in the memory, without dropping to the disk\n\nThe latest sample of this malware family found in the wild is also digitally signed with a\ndifferent certificate:\n\nThe certificate details:\n\nCompany name: In travel TOV\nValidity: from 21 July 2015 to 21 July 2016\nThumbprint: 7809fbd8d24949124283b9ff14d12da497d9c724\nSerial number: 00dfd915e32c5f3181a0cdf0aff50f8052\nSubject: CN = In travel TOV\nO = In travel TOV\nSTREET = prospekt Pravdi 33\nL = Kiev\n\n\n-----\n\nS = Kievskaja\nPostalCode = 04108\nC = UA\n\nAlso, the latest sample is able to gain system privileges via an exploit and install itself as a\nsystem service. The trojan attempts to exploit a vulnerability – CVE-2015-2426 in the\n[OpenType manager module (ATMFD.dll) – which was patched by Microsoft in MS15-078.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-078.aspx)\n[The exploit for this vulnerability was leaked in a Hacking Team dump.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/07/06/400gb-info-leaked-hacking-team/)\n\nThe digital certificate for Blik used in this case is not the only link between\nWin32/Spy.Agent.ORM and Win32/Spy.Sekur (Carbanak malware). They share similarities\nin code – take a look at the function that generates the BOTID-value, for example:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe BOTID-value is a unique value generated on the basis of the hardware parameters of\ninfected computer, and it’s used by attackers for computer identification. In both cases\ngeneration is based on the MAC-address and computer name and the resulting value is\nformatted using the wsprintf –function.\n\n## Sinkhole statistics\n\nOur sinkhole of some C&C domains used by the Win32/Wemosis has resulted in hits from\nbots in the following countries.\n\nAs the attacks are highly targeted, the total number of victims is low in absolute numbers.\nVictims in the USA are situated in several states, including Nevada (Las Vegas), California,\nand New York, and include casinos and hotels.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nEven after it has reportedly stolen hundreds of millions of dollars, the infamous Carbanak\nAPT group isn’t resting on its laurels. On the contrary, it is very active and keeps attacking\nspecific targets related to the finance industry, including banks, Forex-trading companies,\nand even an American casino hotel. Recently, we have detected malware used by the\nCarbanak group in the following countries, among others:\n\nUnited States of America\nGermany\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nAs described in this blog post, the gang doesn’t use just one malware family to carry out its\noperations but several. While the code in the different families – Carbanak\n(Win32/Spy.Sekur), Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM, and Win32/Wemosis – is different it does\ncontain similar traits, including the same digital certificate.\n\nFurthermore, the attackers are updating their arsenal with the latest exploits, such as the\nMicrosoft Office remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2015-1770, or the zero-day\nexploit leaked in the Hacking Team dumps, CVE-2015-2426.\n\nWe continue to monitor the Carbanak threats.
