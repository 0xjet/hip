However, over the past few years,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan%3AWin32%2FWipMBR.B)\nwe have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential\ndestructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable\ngroup that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess\nAPT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government.\n\nRecent investigations by FireEye’s [Mandiant incident response consultants combined with](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage)\nFireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of\nAPT33’s operations, capabilities, and potential motivations. This blog highlights some of our\n[analysis. Our detailed report on FireEye Threat Intelligence contains a more thorough review](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html%23dismiss-lightbox)\nof our supporting evidence and analysis. We will also be discussing this threat group further\n[during our webinar on Sept. 21 at 8 a.m. ET.](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10703/275683?utm_source=FireEye_blog)\n\n**Targeting**\n\nAPT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered in the\nUnited States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in\norganizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as\nwell as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production.\n\nFrom mid-2016 through early 2017, APT33 compromised a U.S. organization in the\naerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with\naviation holdings.\n\nDuring the same time period, APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil\nrefining and petrochemicals. More recently, in May 2017, APT33 appeared to target a Saudi\norganization and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that\nattempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company.\n\nWe assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi\nArabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia’s\nmilitary aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support\nIran’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia.\n\nWe believe the targeting of the Saudi organization may have been an attempt to gain insight\ninto regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South\nKorea’s recent partnerships with Iran’s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea’s\n[relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies. Iran has expressed interest in growing](https://financialtribune.com/articles/energy/41665/call-for-restoring-past-petrochemical-status)\ntheir petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi\npetrochemical companies. APT33 may have targeted these organizations as a result of\nIran’s desire to expand its own petrochemical production and improve its competitiveness\nwithin the region.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors\npreviously observed targeting by other suspected Iranian threat groups, indicating a common\ninterest in the sectors across Iranian actors.\n\nFigure 1 shows the global scope of APT33 targeting.\n\n\nScope of APT33 Targeting\n\n\nFigure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting\n\n**Spear Phishing**\n\nAPT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry.\nThese emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to malicious HTML\napplication (.hta) files. The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job\npostings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example .hta file excerpt is provided in Figure 2. To the user, the file would appear as\nbenign references to legitimate job postings; however, unbeknownst to the user, the .hta file\nalso contained embedded code that automatically downloaded a custom APT33 backdoor.\n\n\nExcerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file\n\n\nFigure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file\nWe assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM\nShell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in\n2016. Many of the phishing emails appeared legitimate – they referenced a specific job\nopportunity and salary, provided a link to the spoofed company’s employment website, and\neven included the spoofed company’s Equal Opportunity hiring statement. However, in a few\ncases, APT33 operators left in the default values of the shell’s phishing module. These\nappear to be mistakes, as minutes after sending the emails with the default values, APT33\nsent emails to the same recipients with the default values removed.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the fake mail phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default\nvalues, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[.]com), subject line (“your site\nhacked by me”), and email body (“Hi Dear Admin”).\n\n\nALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default)\n\n\nFigure 3: ALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default)\nFigure 4 shows an example email containing the default values the shell.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values\n\n\nFigure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values\n\n**Domain Masquerading**\n\nAPT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies\nand Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance\nand support for Saudi’s military and commercial fleet. Based on observed targeting patterns,\nAPT33 likely used these domains in spear phishing emails to target victim organizations.\n\nThe following domains masquerade as these organizations: Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft\nCompany, Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia (NGAAKSA), and Vinnell Arabia.\n\nboeing.servehttp[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nalsalam.ddns[.]net\n\nngaaksa.ddns[.]net\n\nngaaksa.sytes[.]net\n\nvinnellarabia.myftp[.]org\n\nBoeing, Alsalam Aircraft company, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries entered\ninto a [joint venture to create the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Center in Saudi Arabia in 2015](https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2015-08-26-Boeing-Saudia-Aerospace-Engineering-Industries-and-Alsalam-Aircraft-Company-to-Establish-Saudi-Rotorcraft-Support-Center-in-Saudi-Arabia)\nwith the goal of servicing Saudi Arabia’s rotorcraft fleet and building a self-sustaining\nworkforce in the Saudi aerospace supply base.\n\nAlsalam Aircraft Company also offers military and commercial maintenance, technical\nsupport, and interior design and refurbishment services.\n\nTwo of the domains appeared to mimic Northrop Grumman joint ventures. These joint\nventures – Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia – provide aviation support\nin the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia. Both Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman\n[Aviation Arabia have been involved in contracts to train Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of National](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northrop-grumman-forms-industry-leading-team-for-ministry-of-national-guard-aviation-support-contract-saudi-arabia-234754491.html)\nGuard.\n\n**Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government**\n\nWe identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by\nthe Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries.\n\nWe assess an actor using the handle “xman_1365_x” may have been involved in the\ndevelopment and potential use of APT33’s TURNEDUP backdoor due to the inclusion of the\nhandle in the processing-debugging (PDB) paths of many of TURNEDUP samples. An\nexample can be seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nxman_1365_x PDB String in TURNEDUP Sample\n\n\nFigure 5: “xman_1365_x\" PDB String in TURNEDUP Sample\nXman_1365_x was also a community manager in the Barnamenevis Iranian programming\nand software engineering forum, and registered accounts in the well-known Iranian\nShabgard and Ashiyane forums, though we did not find evidence to suggest that this actor\nwas ever a formal member of the Shabgard or Ashiyane hacktivist groups.\n\nOpen source reporting links the “xman_1365_x” actor to the “Nasr Institute,” which is\npurported to be equivalent to Iran’s “cyber army” and controlled by the Iranian government.\nSeparately, additional evidence ties the “Nasr Institute” to the 2011-2013 attacks on the\nfinancial industry, a series of denial of service attacks dubbed Operation Ababil. In March\n[2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment that named two individuals](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/file/835061/download)\nallegedly hired by the Iranian government to build attack infrastructure and conduct\ndistributed denial of service attacks in support of Operation Ababil. While the individuals and\n\n\n-----\n\nthe activity described in indictment are different than what is discussed in this report, it\nprovides some evidence that individuals associated with the “Nasr Institute” may have ties to\nthe Iranian government.\n\n**Potential Ties to Destructive Capabilities and Comparisons with SHAMOON**\n\nOne of the droppers used by APT33, which we refer to as DROPSHOT, has been linked to\nthe wiper malware SHAPESHIFT. Open source research indicates SHAPESHIFT may have\nbeen used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlthough we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP\nbackdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop\nSHAPESHIFT. The SHAPESHIFT malware is capable of wiping disks, erasing volumes and\ndeleting files, depending on its configuration. Both DROPSHOT and SHAPESHIFT contain\nFarsi language artifacts, which indicates they may have been developed by a Farsi language\nspeaker (Farsi is the predominant and official language of Iran).\n\nWhile we have not directly observed APT33 use SHAPESHIFT or otherwise carry out\ndestructive operations, APT33 is the only group that we have observed use the DROPSHOT\ndropper. It is possible that DROPSHOT may be shared amongst Iran-based threat groups,\nbut we do not have any evidence that this is the case.\n\nIn March 2017, Kasperksy released a report that compared DROPSHOT (which they call\nStonedrill) with the most recent variant of SHAMOON (referred to as Shamoon 2.0). They\nstated that both wipers employ anti-emulation techniques and were used to target\norganizations in Saudi Arabia, but also mentioned several differences. For example, they\nstated DROPSHOT uses more advanced anti-emulation techniques, utilizes external scripts\nfor self-deletion, and uses memory injection versus external drivers for deployment.\nKaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds\nArabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language\nresources.\n\nWe have also observed differences in both targeting and tactics, techniques and procedures\n(TTPs) associated with the group using SHAMOON and APT33. For example, we have\nobserved SHAMOON being used to target government organizations in the Middle East,\nwhereas APT33 has targeted several commercial organizations both in the Middle East and\nglobally. APT33 has also utilized a wide range of custom and publicly available tools during\ntheir operations. In contrast, we have not observed the full lifecycle of operations associated\nwith SHAMOON, in part due to the wiper removing artifacts of the earlier stages of the attack\nlifecycle.\n\nRegardless of whether DROPSHOT is exclusive to APT33, both the malware and the threat\nactivity appear to be distinct from the group using SHAMOON. Therefore, we assess there\nmay be multiple Iran-based threat groups capable of carrying out destructive operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Additional Ties Bolster Attribution to Iran**\n\nAPT33’s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns\nwith nation-state interests, implying that the threat actor is most likely government\nsponsored. This coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with Iranian working\nhours – and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our\nassessment that APT33 may have operated on behalf of the Iranian government.\n\nThe times of day that APT33 threat actors were active suggests that they were operating in a\ntime zone close to 04:30 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The time of the\n[observed attacker activity coincides with Iran’s Daylight Time, which is +0430 UTC.](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/irdt)\n\nAPT33 largely operated on days that correspond to Iran’s workweek, Saturday to\nWednesday. This is evident by the lack of attacker activity on Thursday, as shown in Figure\n6. Public sources report that Iran works a Saturday to Wednesday or Saturday to Thursday\nwork week, with government offices [closed on Thursday and some private businesses](https://financialtribune.com/articles/travel/59580/weekend-reform-proposal-rejected)\noperating on a half day schedule on Thursday.Many other Middle East countries have\n[elected to have a Friday and Saturday weekend.Iran is one of few countries that subscribes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-250B-363)\nto a Saturday to Wednesday workweek.\n\nAPT33 leverages popular Iranian hacker tools and DNS servers used by other suspected\nIranian threat groups. The publicly available backdoors and tools utilized by APT33 –\nincluding NANOCORE, NETWIRE, and ALFA Shell – are all available on Iranian hacking\nwebsites, associated with Iranian hackers, and used by other suspected Iranian threat\ngroups. While not conclusive by itself, the use of publicly available Iranian hacking tools and\npopular Iranian hosting companies may be a result of APT33’s familiarity with them and\nlends support to the assessment that APT33 may be based in Iran.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT33 Interactive Commands by Day of Week\n\n\nFigure 6: APT33 Interactive Commands by Day of Week\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nBased on observed targeting, we believe APT33 engages in strategic espionage by targeting\ngeographically diverse organizations across multiple industries. Specifically, the targeting of\norganizations in the aerospace and energy sectors indicates that the threat group is likely in\nsearch of strategic intelligence capable of benefitting a government or military sponsor.\nAPT33’s focus on aviation may indicate the group’s desire to gain insight into regional\nmilitary aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military\nand strategic decision making. Their targeting of multiple holding companies and\norganizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially\nas it relates to increasing petrochemical production. We expect APT33 activity will continue\nto cover a broad scope of targeted entities, and may spread into other regions and sectors\nas Iranian interests dictate.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT33 s use of multiple custom backdoors suggests that they have access to some of their\nown development resources, with which they can support their operations, while also making\nuse of publicly available tools. The ties to SHAPESHIFT may suggest that APT33 engages in\ndestructive operations or that they share tools or a developer with another Iran-based threat\ngroup that conducts destructive operations.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nMalware Family Descriptions\n\n\nMalware\nFamily\n\n\nDescription Availability\n\n\nDROPSHOT Dropper that has been observed dropping and launching the\nTURNEDUP backdoor, as well as the SHAPESHIFT wiper\nmalware\n\nNANOCORE Publicly available remote access Trojan (RAT) available for\npurchase.
