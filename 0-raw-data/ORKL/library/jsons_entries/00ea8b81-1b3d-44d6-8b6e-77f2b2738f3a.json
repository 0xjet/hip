This double-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\nextortion technique has now become a standard tactic used by almost all ransomware\noperations.\n\n[Maze continued to evolve ransomware operations by forming a ransomware cartel with](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-adds-ragnar-locker-to-its-extortion-cartel/)\nRagnar Locker and LockBit, to share information and tactics.\n\nDuring their year and a half cybercrime spree, Maze has been responsible for attacks on\n[notable victims, including Southwire,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-publishes-14gb-of-stolen-southwire-files/) [City of Pensacola,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-behind-pensacola-cyberattack-1m-ransom-demand/) [Canon,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/canon-confirms-ransomware-attack-in-internal-memo/) [LG Electronics,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lg-electronics-allegedly-hit-by-maze-ransomware-attack/) [Xerox, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-giant-xerox-allegedly-suffers-maze-ransomware-attack/)\nmany more.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Maze started to shut down six weeks ago\n\nEarly last month, BleepingComputer began hearing rumors that Maze was getting ready to\n[shut down their ransomware operation in a similar manner as GandCrab did in 2019.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-shutting-down-after-claiming-to-earn-2-billion/)\n\nThe closing of operations was later confirmed after BleepingComputer was contacted by a\n[threat actor involved in the Barnes and Noble ransomware attack.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/barnes-and-noble-hit-by-cyberattack-that-exposed-customer-data/)\n\nThis threat actor stated that they take part in ransomware attacks by compromising\nnetworks and stealing Windows domain credentials. The compromised networks are then\npassed to affiliates who deploy the ransomware.\n\nThe group compromising networks, the affiliate, and ransomware developers then take\nequal shares of any ransom payments.\n\nAs part of our conversation, BleepingComputer was told that Maze was in the process of\nshutting down its operation, had stopped encrypting new victims in September 2020, and\nare trying to squeeze the last ransom payments from victims.\n\n**BleepingComputer told that Maze is shut down**\nWhen BleepingComputer reached out to Maze to confirm if they were shutting down, we\nwere told, \"You should wait for the press release.\"\n\nThis week, Maze has started to remove victims that they had listed on their data leak site.\nAll that is left on the site are two victims and those who previously and had all of their data\npublished.\n\nThe cleaning up of the data leak site indicates that the ransomware operation's shutdown is\nimminent.\n\nIt is not uncommon for ransomware operations to release the master decryption keys when\n[they shut down their operation, as was done with Crysis,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/master-decryption-keys-and-decryptor-for-the-crysis-ransomware-released/) [TeslaCrypt, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/teslacrypt-shuts-down-and-releases-master-decryption-key/) [Shade.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shade-ransomware-shuts-down-releases-750k-decryption-keys/)\n\nBleepingComputer has reached out to Maze to ask if they will release their keys when they\nshut down their operation but have not heard back.\n\n## Affiliates move to Egregor ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nBleepingComputer has learned that many Maze affiliates have switched over to a new\nransomware operation called Egregor.\n\nEgregor began operating in the middle of September, just as Maze started shutting down\ntheir encryption operation. It quickly became very active, as seen by the IDRansomware submission graph below.\n\n**Egregor submissions graph to ID-Ransomware**\nEgregor is believed to be the same underlying software as both Maze and Sekhmet as they\nutilize the same ransom notes, similar payment site naming, and share much of the same\ncode.\n\nThis was also confirmed by a ransomware threat actor who stated that Maze, Sekhmet, and\nEgregor were the same software.\n\n[Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie, who analyzed both Egregor and Sekhmet, also](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nfound that Egregor victims who paid a ransom were sent decryptors that were titled\n'Sekhmet Decryptor.'\n\n**Egregor decryptor**\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, this shows that even when a ransomware operation shuts down, it does not\nmean the threat actors involved retire as well. They just move to the next ransomware\noperation.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Cybercrime](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Maze](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/maze/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Retirement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/retirement/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
