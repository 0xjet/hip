They also tracked down an IP address that had attempted to](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.perlbot)\nconnect to the OSI server 38 times in what Air Force investigators called an SSH brute-force\nattack.\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing a subpoena, OSI traced the IP address at the time of the attacks to a Raspberry Pi\ndevice running the Raspbian OS, on Google Fiber account, and a residential address in the\ncity of Olathe, Kansas.\n\nOn May 4, law enforcement agents raided the Olathe home, from where they seized several\ncomputers, an iPhone, but also five Raspberry Pi devices.\n\nImage: The Record\nWhile court documents shared by a source with The Record include the home owner’s\nname, a DevOps engineer with government contractor NIC, we will not be naming the man\nfor this article.\n\nDue to how most crypto-mining botnets are designed today, it is unclear if the man was\noperating the botnet or if their device was merely infected with the Outlaw malware, which\nthen abused the Raspberry Pi system to carry out brute-force attacks without the owner’s\nknowledge, in attempts to find new systems to infect.\n\nAir Force investigators are currently forensically searching the seized devices for evidence\nthat the man was operating the botnet.\n\nOSI officials have not filed formal charges against the Kansas man.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Second incident of its kind\n\nThe November 2020 incident is the second time that a cryptocurrency mining botnet has\ninfected a part of the Department of Defense (DOD) network.\n\nA [first case was reported via the DOD’s bug bounty program in February 2020. At the time, a](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bug-hunter-finds-cryptocurrency-mining-botnet-on-dod-network/)\nbug hunter found that a crypto-miner botnet had used a misconfigured Jenkins automation\nserver to plant its malicious scripts on Amazon web servers managed by the DOD.\n\nTags\n\n[Air Force](https://therecord.media/tag/air-force/)\n[crypto-miner](https://therecord.media/tag/crypto-miner/)\n[cryptomining](https://therecord.media/tag/cryptomining/)\n[DOD](https://therecord.media/tag/dod/)\n[investigation](https://therecord.media/tag/investigation/)\n[Kansas](https://therecord.media/tag/kansas/)\n[legal](https://therecord.media/tag/legal/)\n[Raspberry Pi](https://therecord.media/tag/raspberry-pi/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
