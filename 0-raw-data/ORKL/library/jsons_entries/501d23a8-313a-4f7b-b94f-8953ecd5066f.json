However, it](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-attack-hits-ukraine/)\nshould be noted that this was not an isolated incident: this is the latest in a series of similar\nattacks in Ukraine. This blogpost reveals many details about the Diskcoder.C (aka ExPetr,\nPetrWrap, Petya, or NotPetya) outbreak and related information about previously\nunpublished attacks.\n\nFigure 1 – The timeline of supply-chain attacks in Ukraine.\n\n## TeleBots\n\nIn December 2016 we published two detailed blogposts about disruptive attacks conducted\nby the group ESET researchers call TeleBots, specifically about attacks against financial\ninstitutions and a [Linux version of the KillDisk malware used by this group. The group](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/01/05/killdisk-now-targeting-linux-demands-250k-ransom-cant-decrypt/)\nmounted cyberattacks against various computer systems in Ukraine; systems that can be\n[defined as critical infrastructure. Moreover, this group has connections with the infamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure)\n[BlackEnergy group that was responsible for the December 2015 power outages in Ukraine.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)\n\nIn the final stage of its attacks, the TeleBots group always used the KillDisk malware to\noverwrite files with specific file extensions on the victims’ disks. Putting the cart before the\nhorse: collecting ransom money was never the top priority for the TeleBots group. The\nKillDisk malware used in the first wave of December 2016 attacks, instead of encrypting,\nsimply overwrites targeted files. Further, it did not provide contact information for\ncommunicating with the attacker; it just displayed an image from the Mr. Robot TV show.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – The picture displayed by KillDisk malware in the first wave of December 2016 attacks.\n\nIn the second wave of attacks, the cybersaboteurs behind the KillDisk malware added\ncontact information to the malware, so it would look like a typical ransomware attack.\nHowever, the attackers asked for an extraordinary number of bitcoins: 222 BTC (about\n$250,000 at that time). This might indicate that they were not interested in bitcoins, but their\nactual aim was to cause damage to attacked companies.\n\nFigure 3 – The ransom demand displayed by KillDisk in the second wave of December 2016\n\nattacks.\n\nIn 2017, the TeleBots group didn’t stop their cyberattacks; in fact, they became more\nsophisticated. In the period between January and March 2017 the TeleBots attackers\ncompromised a software company in Ukraine (not related to M.E. Doc), and, using VPN\ntunnels from there, gained access to the internal networks of several financial institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring that attack, those behind TeleBots enhanced their arsenal with two pieces of\nransomware and updated versions of tools mentioned in the previously-linked blogposts.\n\nThe first backdoor that the TeleBots group relied heavily on was Python/TeleBot.A, which\nwas rewritten from Python in the Rust programming language. The functionality remains the\nsame: it is a standard backdoor that uses the Telegram Bot API in order to receive\ncommands from, and send responses to, the malware operator.\n\nFigure 4 – Disassembled code of the Win32/TeleBot.AB trojan.\n\nThe second backdoor, which was written in VBS and packaged using the script2exe\nprogram, was heavily obfuscated but the functionality remained the same as in previous\nattacks.\n\nFigure 5 – The obfuscated version of the VBS backdoor.\n\nThis time the VBS backdoor used the C&C server at 130.185.250[.]171. To make\nconnections less suspicious for those who check firewall logs, the attackers registered the\ndomain transfinance.com[.]ua and hosted it on that IP address. As is evident from Figure\n6 this server was also running the Tor relay named severalwdadwajunior.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Information about Tor relay run by the TeleBots group.\n\nIn addition, the attacker used the following tools:\n\nCredRaptor (password stealer)\nPlainpwd (modified Mimikatz used for recovering Windows credentials from memory)\nSysInternals’ PsExec (used for lateral movement)\n\nAs mentioned above, in the final stage of their attacks, the TeleBots attackers pushed\nransomware using stolen Windows credentials and SysInternals’ PsExec. This new\nransomware was detected by ESET products as Win32/Filecoder.NKH. Once executed, this\nransomware encrypts all files (except files located in the C:\\Windows directory) using AES128 and RSA-1024 algorithms. The malware adds the .xcrypted file extension to alreadyencrypted files.\n\nWhen encryption is done, this filecoder malware creates a text file !readme.txt with the\nfollowing content:\n\n_Please contact us: openy0urm1nd@protonmail.ch_\n\nIn addition to Windows malware, the TeleBots group used Linux ransomware on nonWindows servers. This ransomware is detected by ESET products as Python/Filecoder.R\nand, predictably, it is written in the Python programming language. This time attackers\n\n\n-----\n\nexecute third-party utilities such as openssl in order to encrypt files. The encryption is done\nusing the RSA-2048 and AES-256 algorithms.\n\nFigure 7 – Python code of Linux ransomware Python/Filecoder.R used by the TeleBots group.\n\nIn the code of Python script, attackers left their comment which had following text:\n\n_feedback: openy0urm1nd[@]protonmail.ch_\n\n## Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C\n\n[On 18 May 2017, we noticed new activity on the part of another ransomware family](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/23/xdata-ransomware-making-rounds-amid-global-wannacryptor-scare/)\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.C (also referred to as XData).\n\nThis ransomware was spread mostly in Ukraine, because of an interesting initial vector.\nAccording to our LiveGrid® telemetry, the malware was created right after execution of the\nM.E.Doc software that is widely used by accounting personnel in Ukraine.\n\nThe Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C ransomware had a spreading mechanism that allowed it to\nperform lateral movement automatically, inside a compromised company LAN. Specifically,\nthe malware had an embedded Mimikatz DLL that it used to extract Windows account\ncredentials from the memory of a compromised PC. With these credentials, the malware\nstarted to spread inside its host network using SysInternals’ PsExec utility.\n\nIt seems that the attackers either did not reach their goal on that occasion, or it was the test\nbefore a more effective strike. The attackers posted master decryption keys on the\n[BleepingComputer forum, along with the assertion that this was done because the original](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/aes-ni-ransomware-dev-releases-decryption-keys-amid-fears-of-being-framed-for-xdata-outbreak/)\nauthor claimed that the source was stolen and used in the Ukraine incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nESET [published a decryption tool for Win32/Filecoder.AESNI ransomware, and this event](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/31/eset-releases-new-decryption-tool-aes-ni-ransomware/)\ndidn’t gain much media attention.\n\n## Diskcoder.C (aka Petya-like) outbreak\n\nWhat did gain a lot of media attention, however, was the [Petya-like outbreak of 27 June,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-attack-hits-ukraine/)\n2017, because it successfully compromised a lot of systems in critical infrastructure and\nother businesses in Ukraine, and further afield.\n\nThe malware in this attack has the ability to replace the Master Boot Record (MBR) with its\n[own malicious code. This code was borrowed from Win32/Diskcoder.Petya ransomware.](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Diskcoder.Petya.B/description)\nThat’s why some other malware researchers have named this threat as ExPetr, PetrWrap,\nPetya, or NotPetya. However, unlike the original Petya ransomware, Diskcoder.C’s authors\nmodified the MBR code in such a way that recovery won’t be possible. Specifically, the\nattacker cannot provide a decryption key and the decryption key cannot be typed in the\nransom screen, because the generated key contains non-acceptable characters.\n\nVisually this MBR part of Diskcoder.C looks like a slightly modified version of Petya: at first it\ndisplays a message that impersonates CHKDSK, Microsoft’s disk checking utility. During\nthe faux CHKDISK scan Diskcoder.C actually encrypts the data.\n\nFigure 8 – Fake CHKDSK message displayed by Diskcoder.C.\n\nWhen encryption is complete, the MBR code displays the next message with payment\ninstructions, but as noted before this information is useless.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Diskcoder.C message with payment instructions.\n\nThe remainder of the code, other than the borrowed MBR, was implemented by the authors\nthemselves. This includes file encryption that can be used as a complement to the diskencrypting MBR. For file encryption, the malware uses the AES-128 and RSA-2048\nalgorithms. It should be noted that the authors made mistakes that make decryption of files\nless possible. Specifically, the malware encrypts only the first 1MB of data and it does not\nwrite any header or footer, only raw encrypted data and does not rename encrypted files, so\nit’s hard to say which files are encrypted and which are not. In addition to that, files that are\nlarger than 1MB after encryption do not contain padding, so there is no way to verify the\nkey.\n\nInterestingly, the list of target file extensions is not identical but is very similar to the file\n[extensions list from the KillDisk malware used in the December 2016 attacks.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/)\n\nFigure 10 – List of target file extensions from Diskcoder.C.\n\nOnce the malware is executed it attempts to spread using the infamous EternalBlue exploit,\nleveraging the DoublePulsar kernel-mode backdoor. Exactly the same method was used in\nthe WannaCryptor.D ransomware. Diskcoder.C also adopted the method from the\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.C (aka XData) ransomware: it uses a lightweight version of\n\n\n-----\n\nMimikatz to obtain credentials and then executes the malware using SysInternals PsExec\non other machines on the LAN. In addition to that, the attackers implemented a third\nmethod of spreading using a WMI mechanism.\n\nAll three of these methods have been used to spread malware inside LANs. Unlike the\ninfamous [WannaCryptor malware, the EternalBlue exploit is used by Diskcoder.C only](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/15/wannacryptor-key-questions-answered/)\nagainst computers within the local network address space.\n\nWhy are there infections in other countries than Ukraine? Our investigation revealed that\naffected companies in other countries had VPN connections to their branches, or to\nbusiness partners, in Ukraine.\n\n## Initial infection vector\n\nBoth Diskcoder.C and Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C used a supply-chain attack as the initial\ninfection vector. These malware families were spread using Ukrainian accounting software\ncalled M.E.Doc.\n\nThere are several options for how this attack can be implemented. The M.E.Doc has an\ninternal messaging and document exchange system so attackers could send spearphishing\nmessages to victims. User interaction is required in order to execute something malicious in\nthis way. Thus, social engineering techniques would be involved. Since\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.C didn’t spread so widely, we mistakenly assumed that these\ntechniques were used in this case.\n\nHowever, the subsequent Diskcoder.C outbreak suggests that the attackers had access to\nthe update server of the legitimate software. Using access to this server, attackers pushed a\nmalicious update that was applied automatically without user interaction. That’s why so\nmany systems in Ukraine were affected by this attack. However, it seems like the malware\nauthors underestimated the spreading capabilities of Diskcoder.C.\n\nESET researchers found evidence that supports this theory. Specifically, we identified a\nmalicious PHP backdoor that was deployed under medoc_online.php in one of the FTP\ndirectories on M.E.Doc’s server. This backdoor was accessible from HTTP; however, it was\nencrypted, so the attacker would have to have the password in order to use it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 – Listing of FTP directory containing the PHP backdoor.\n\nWe should say that there are signs that suggest that Diskcoder.C and\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.C were not the only malware families that were deployed using that\ninfection vector. We can speculate that these malicious updates were deployed in a stealthy\nway to computer networks that belong to high-value targets.\n\nOne such malware that was deployed via this possible compromised M.E.Doc update\nserver mechanism was the VBS backdoor used by the TeleBots group. This time the\nattacker again used a financially-themed domain name: bankstat.kiev[.]ua.\n\nOn the day of the Diskcoder.C outbreak, the A-record of this domain was changed to\n10.0.0.1\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe TeleBots group continues to evolve in order to conduct disruptive attacks against\nUkraine. Instead of spearphishing emails with documents containing malicious macros, they\nused a more sophisticated scheme known as a supply-chain attack. Prior to the outbreak,\nthe Telebots group targeted mainly the financial sector. The latest outbreak was directed\nagainst businesses in Ukraine, but they apparently underestimated the malware’ spreading\ncapabilities. That’s why the malware went out of control.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)\n\nESET detection names:\n\nWin32/TeleBot trojan\n\nVBS/Agent.BB trojan\n\nVBS/Agent.BD trojan\n\nVBS/Agent.BE trojan\n\nWin32/PSW.Agent.ODE trojan\n\nWin64/PSW.Agent.K trojan\n\nPython/Filecoder.R trojan\n\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.C trojan\n\nWin32/Filecoder.NKH trojan\n\nWin32/Diskcoder.C trojan\n\nWin64/Riskware.Mimikatz application\n\nWin32/RiskWare.Mimikatz application\n\nC&C servers:\n\n\n-----\n\ntransfinance.com[.]ua (IP: 130.185.250.171)\nbankstat.kiev[.]ua (IP: 82.221.128.27)\n\nwww.capital-investing.com[.]ua (IP: 82.221.131.52)\n\nLegitimate servers abused by malware authors:\n\napi.telegram.org (IP: 149.154.167.200, 149.154.167.197, 149.154.167.198,\n149.154.167.199)\n\nVBS backdoor:\n\n1557E59985FAAB8EE3630641378D232541A8F6F9\n\n31098779CE95235FED873FF32BB547FFF02AC2F5\n\nCF7B558726527551CDD94D71F7F21E2757ECD109\n\nMimikatz:\n\n91D955D6AC6264FBD4324DB2202F68D097DEB241\n\nDCF47141069AECF6291746D4CDF10A6482F2EE2B\n\n4CEA7E552C82FA986A8D99F9DF0EA04802C5AB5D\n\n4134AE8F447659B465B294C131842009173A786B\n\n698474A332580464D04162E6A75B89DE030AA768\n\n00141A5F0B269CE182B7C4AC06C10DEA93C91664\n\n271023936A084F52FEC50130755A41CD17D6B3B1\n\nD7FB7927E19E483CD0F58A8AD4277686B2669831\n\n56C03D8E43F50568741704AEE482704A4F5005AD\n\n38E2855E11E353CEDF9A8A4F2F2747F1C5C07FCF\n\n4EAAC7CFBAADE00BB526E6B52C43A45AA13FD82B\n\nF4068E3528D7232CCC016975C89937B3C54AD0D1\n\nWin32/TeleBot:\n\nA4F2FF043693828A46321CCB11C5513F73444E34\n\n5251EDD77D46511100FEF7EBAE10F633C1C5FC53\n\n8D379585E0A9DB4C65450622CED26C108DC694AB\n\nWin32/PSW.Agent.ODE (CredRaptor):\n\n759DCDDDA26CF2CC61628611CF14CFABE4C27423\n\n77C1C31AD4B9EBF5DB77CC8B9FE9782350294D70\n\nEAEDC201D83328AF6A77AF3B1E7C4CAC65C05A88\n\nEE275908790F63AFCD58E6963DC255A54FD7512A\n\nEE9DC32621F52EDC857394E4F509C7D2559DA26B\n\nFC68089D1A7DFB2EB4644576810068F7F451D5AA\n\n\n-----\n\nWin32/Filecoder.NKH:\n\n1C69F2F7DEE471B1369BF2036B94FDC8E4EDA03E\n\nPython/Filecoder.R:\n\nAF07AB5950D35424B1ECCC3DD0EEBC05AE7DDB5E\n\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.C:\n\nBDD2ECF290406B8A09EB01016C7658A283C407C3\n\n9C694094BCBEB6E87CD8DD03B80B48AC1041ADC9\n\nD2C8D76B1B97AE4CB57D0D8BE739586F82043DBD\n\nWin32/Diskcoder.C:\n\n34F917AABA5684FBE56D3C57D48EF2A1AA7CF06D\n\nPHP shell:\n\nD297281C2BF03CE2DE2359F0CE68F16317BF0A86\n\n30 Jun 2017 - 03:30PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
