It was May 14, 2016, and Shimomura was living in the city of Nagoya. Thirty-two\nyears old and skinny, with expressive eyes, he took pride in his appearance, often wearing a\nsuit and mirror-shined loafers. But he was a minor figure in the organization: a collector of\ndebts, a performer of odd jobs.\n\nThe superior assured him that the scheme was low risk, and instructed him to attend a\nmeeting that evening at a bar in Nagoya. (Shimomura, who has since left the Yamaguchigumi, asked to be referred to only by his surname.) When Shimomura showed up, he found\nthree other gangsters, none of whom he knew. Like many yakuza, he is of Korean descent,\nand two of the others were also Korean-Japanese; for a while, they spoke in Korean. The\nsuperior finally arrived, and the five men moved into a private room. Each volunteer was\ngiven a plain white credit card. There was no chip on the card, no numbers, no name—just a\nmagnetic strip.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe superior read instructions from a thin manual: early the next morning, a Sunday, they\nshould go to any 7-Eleven and use their white card at the store’s A.T.M. They could not use a\nregular bank A.T.M., or one in another convenience store. The gangsters should each\nwithdraw a hundred thousand yen at a time (about nine hundred dollars) but make no more\nthan nineteen transactions per machine. If anybody made twenty withdrawals from a single\nA.T.M., his card would be blocked. Withdrawals could start at 5 a.m. and continue until 8 a.m.\nThe volunteers were told to choose the Japanese language when prompted—an indication,\nShimomura realized, that the cards were foreign. After making nineteen withdrawals, they\nshould wait an hour before visiting another 7-Eleven. They could keep ten per cent of the\ncash. The rest would go to the bosses. Finally, each volunteer was told to memorize a PIN.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Shimomura rose early, and dressed in jeans, sunglasses, a baseball\ncap, and an old T-shirt. He walked to a 7-Eleven, where he bought a rice ball and a Coke, to\nsettle himself. He inserted the card into the A.T.M. When the screen asked him which\nlanguage he preferred, he felt a tremor of nerves while selecting “Japanese.” He withdrew a\nhundred thousand yen, then another, and then another. There was nobody else in the store\napart from the guy at the register, who didn’t seem interested in him.\n\nAfter making the first withdrawal, Shimomura printed a receipt. He saw a foreign name on\nthe paper—he couldn’t tell what nationality the name was, but he knew it wasn’t Japanese—\nthen stuffed the receipt in his pocket. Around 8 a.m., having completed a total of thirty-eight\nwithdrawals at several A.T.M.s in the area, he headed home, waddling because of his\nbulging pockets: 3.8 million yen is a lot of cash. Shimomura took his ten per cent—about\nthirty-five hundred dollars—and stashed it in a drawer in his apartment. At 3 p.m., he met his\nsuperior to deliver the remaining money. (Later, he discovered that one of the other\ngangsters had absconded with the money and the card.)\n\nThe superior told Shimomura that he would retain five per cent of what his volunteers\nbrought in and send the rest of the cash to his bosses. When Shimomura handed over his\nmoney, he sensed that the superior had enlisted many others. He was right. As the\nnewspapers soon reported, more than sixteen million dollars was withdrawn from roughly\nseventeen hundred 7-Eleven A.T.M.s across Japan that morning, using data stolen from\nSouth Africa’s Standard Bank. The newspapers surmised that 7-Elevens had been targeted\nbecause they were the only convenience stores in Japan whose cash terminals all accepted\nforeign cards. Soon after the raids, the withdrawal limit for many A.T.M.s in the country was\nreduced to fifty thousand yen.\n\nShimomura deduced that he had been at the bottom of the food chain in the scam. The real\nmoney-makers were much higher up. What he did not know, until an interview with this\nmagazine last year, was the identity of the villains at the top of the chain. Shortly after the\nA.T.M. thefts, according to Japanese police, the ringleader of the 7-Eleven operation crossed\nfrom China into North Korea. Shimomura had unwittingly been collecting money for the\nKorean People’s Army, as part of a racket that became known as FASTCash.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn satellite images of East Asia at night, lights blare almost everywhere, except in one inky\npatch between the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, and between the thirty-eighth and the\nforty-third parallels: North Korea. Only Pyongyang, the capital, emits a recognizably modern\nglow. The dark country is one of the last nominally Communist nations in the world—a\n[Stalinist personality cult centered on Kim Jong Un, the peevish, ruthless scion of the dynasty](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/kim-jong-un)\nthat has ruled North Korea since 1948, after the peninsula was divided. The D.P.R.K.\npurports to be a socialist autarky founded on the principle of juche, or self-reliance. Its\nborders are closed and its people sequestered. Foreigners find it profoundly difficult to\nunderstand what is happening inside North Korea, but it is even harder for ordinary North\nKorean citizens to learn about the outside world. A tiny fraction of one per cent of North\nKoreans has access to the Internet.\n\nYet, paradoxically, the North Korean government has produced some of the world’s most\nproficient hackers. At first glance, the situation is perverse, even comical—like Jamaica\nwinning an Olympic gold in bobsledding—but the cyber threat from North Korea is real and\ngrowing. Like many countries, including the United States, North Korea has equipped its\nmilitary with offensive and intelligence-gathering cyber weapons. In 2016, for instance,\nmilitary coders from Pyongyang stole more than two hundred gigabytes of South Korean\nArmy data, which included documents known as Operational Plan 5015—a detailed analysis\nof how a war with the country’s northern neighbor might proceed, and, notably, a plot to\n“decapitate” North Korea by assassinating Kim Jong Un. The breach was so egregious that\nKim Tae-woo, a former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a think tank in\n[Seoul, told the Financial Times, “Part of my mind hopes the South Korean military](https://www.ft.com/content/d8bbceb0-ad64-11e7-aab9-abaa44b1e130)\nintentionally leaked the classified documents to the North with the intention of having a\nsecond strategy.”\n\nNorth Korea, moreover, is the only nation in the world whose government is known to\nconduct nakedly criminal hacking for monetary gain. Units of its military-intelligence division,\nthe Reconnaissance General Bureau, are trained specifically for this purpose. In 2013, Kim\nJong Un described the men who worked in the “brave R.G.B.” as his “warriors . . . for the\nconstruction of a strong and prosperous nation.”\n\nNorth Korea’s cybercrime program is hydra-headed, with tactics ranging from bank heists to\nthe deployment of ransomware and the theft of cryptocurrency from online exchanges. It is\ndifficult to quantify how successful Pyongyang’s hackers have been. Unlike terrorist groups,\nNorth Korea’s cybercriminals do not claim responsibility when they strike, and the\ngovernment issues reflexive denials. As a result, even seasoned observers sometimes\ndisagree when attributing individual attacks to North Korea. Nevertheless, in 2019, a United\n[Nations panel of experts on sanctions against North Korea issued a report estimating that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-cyber-un/north-korea-took-2-billion-in-cyberattacks-to-fund-weapons-program-u-n-report-idUSKCN1UV1ZX)\nthe country had raised two billion dollars through cybercrime. Since the report was written,\nthere has been bountiful evidence to indicate that the pace and the ingenuity of North\nKorea’s online threat have accelerated.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the U.N., many of the funds stolen by North Korean hackers are spent on the\nKorean People’s Army’s weapons program, including its development of nuclear missiles.\nThe cybercrime spree has also been a cheap and effective way of circumventing the harsh\nsanctions that have long been imposed on the country. In February, John C. Demers, the\nAssistant Attorney General for the National Security Division of the Justice Department,\ndeclared that North Korea, “using keyboards rather than guns,” had become a “criminal\nsyndicate with a flag.”\n\nNorth Korea’s leaders have been attuned to the nefarious opportunities of a connected world\n[since at least the early nineteen-nineties. A 2019 paper on the regime, written by scholars at](https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_08_The-All-Purpose-Sword.pdf)\nKorea University, in Seoul, notes that [Kim Jong Il, having watched the United States’ military](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/kim-jong-il)\nengagement in the two Gulf conflicts, concluded that “modern war is decided by one’s\nconduct of electronic warfare.” (Among other tactics, American planes jammed Iraqi radar\nsystems.) In 2005, a Korean People’s Army book quoted Kim as saying, “If the Internet is like\na gun, cyberattacks are like atomic bombs.” His son Kim Jong Un came to power in 2012\nand saw the commercial potential of the technology, noting that his army could “penetrate\nany sanctions.” Cyber prowess, he soon declared, was an “all-purpose sword that\nguarantees the North Korean People’s Armed Forces ruthless striking capability, along with\nnuclear weapons and missiles.” Yet the West didn’t really wake up to the danger posed by\nNorth Korea’s cyber forces until after the country executed three spectacular crimes,\nbetween 2014 and 2017.\n\nThe first was a hack of Sony Pictures. In June, 2014, Sony released a trailer for “The\nInterview,” a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy about hapless journalists recruited by\nthe C.I.A. to assassinate Kim Jong Un. A spokesperson for the regime called the film a\n“wanton act of terror” and promised a “merciless response” if the studio proceeded with\nreleasing the film. Sony pressed ahead. (Rogen joked on Twitter, “People don’t usually\nwanna kill me for one of my movies until after they’ve paid 12 bucks for it.”)\n\nThat November, Sony employees reported that their computers had been hacked, by a group\ncalling itself Guardians of Peace. After many of the company’s computers froze, Sony shut\ndown the rest, stanching the bleed of data that was under way. For a few days, Sony\nPictures operated without an electronic network, and in subsequent weeks the hackers\nleaked embarrassing—and, in some cases, damaging—e-mails, salaries, medical records,\nmovies, and screenplays belonging to the company and its employees. Five upcoming Sony\n[films were put online, as was the script of the next James Bond movie, “Spectre.” One of the](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/human-bondage)\nstudio heads, Amy Pascal, resigned after the hackers posted e-mails in which she joked with\n[the producer Scott Rudin that at a meeting with President Barack Obama she’d be smart to](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama)\nbring up movies about slavery.\n\nThe F.B.I. soon attributed the attack to North Korean state actors. Pyongyang denied\ninvolvement but declared the hack a “righteous deed.” Obama promised to “respond\nproportionally” to what he called an act of “cyber vandalism.” Michael McCaul, who chaired\n\n\n-----\n\nthe House Homeland Security Committee, later told reporters that the U.S. had launched a\nnumber of “cyber responses” to the Sony hack, not least a ten-hour Internet outage in North\nKorea in December, 2014.\n\nIf the attack on Sony had a cartoonish quality, the second major North Korean attack was like\na caper. Around the time that the hackers were breaking into Sony’s network, members of\nthe same gang—which became known as the Lazarus Group—began scoping out banks in\nDhaka, Bangladesh. Accounts linked to the Lazarus Group sent e-mails to an array of targets\nat Bangladesh Bank and other financial institutions in Dhaka. The messages contained a link\nto malware that, if clicked, granted the North Koreans access to internal computer systems.\nIn the first two months of 2015, at least three Bangladesh Bank employees were lured by\nthese “spear-phishing” e-mails into downloading the infected attachment. By that March, the\nhackers had established a “backdoor” within the bank’s electronic communication system,\nallowing them to send messages to one another in a way that mimicked the bank’s\nencrypted-communication protocols, and did not alert security to their presence. The hidden\nhackers then spent ten months learning about Bangladesh Bank’s operations from the\ninside.\n\nLike many national banks in developing countries, Bangladesh Bank holds a foreigncurrency account with the Federal Reserve bank in New York. On February 4, 2016, the\nFederal Reserve received instructions from Bangladesh Bank to make dozens of payments,\ntotalling nearly a billion dollars, to various accounts, including one in Sri Lanka and four in\nthe Philippines. The requests were made via the swift network—a global conduit for money\ntransfers, based near Brussels. In fact, the Lazarus hackers had sent the requests, using\nstolen usernames and passwords that they had collected while roaming around Bangladesh\nBank’s network. In their fraudulent messages to the Federal Reserve, the Lazarus members\nhad incorporated many details from genuine, previously executed SWIFT transfers, so that it\nwould not be obvious their own requests were bogus. To further cover their tracks, the\nhackers had installed a network update that blocked SWIFT messages from being read at\nBangladesh Bank—a piece of legerdemain that later impressed security experts. It was the\nequivalent of breaking into a bank’s vault after disabling its surveillance cameras.\n\nPriscilla Moriuchi, a fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs\nwho focusses on the North Korean cyber threat, worked at the National Security Agency for\ntwelve years. She told me that the Bangladesh operation was “flashy.” But the robbers not\nonly showed technical finesse, she said; their patient work in the Dhaka heist “signalled a\nlarger tactical and operational maturity.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve granted the first five payment requests, a total of a hundred and one\nmillion dollars. The next thirty payments, which amounted to eight hundred and fifty million\ndollars, stalled only because of a stroke of luck. An automated alert system was activated\nafter detecting, in the text of a transfer request, the word “Jupiter,” which happened to be in\n\n\n-----\n\nthe address of a Philippines bank branch. This alert was tripped because an unrelated\nbusiness, Jupiter Seaways Shipping, in Athens, was on a sanctions-evasion watch list for its\nactivities relating to Iran.\n\nAfter this and another small irregularity were detected, freeze requests were placed on the\nrecipient accounts. But—as the hackers had anticipated—because the heist was carried out\non a holiday weekend in the Philippines the freeze requests weren’t processed for another\nforty-eight hours. By that time, some eighty-one million dollars had been transferred into a\ndifferent account. Most of this money was then withdrawn, converted into cash as Philippine\npesos, and exchanged for casino chips. At the time, gambling establishments in the\nPhilippines were exempt from anti-money-laundering regulations. It wasn’t a billion dollars,\nbut it was a huge haul.\n\nBy the time of North Korea’s third major attack, nobody found the regime’s cyber threat funny\nanymore. A 2017 ransomware scheme known as Wannacry 2.0 crippled networks in\nAmerica, Europe, and Asia—including the computer systems of Boeing, Britain’s National\nHealth Service, and Germany’s federal railway. The hackers encrypted computer after\ncomputer, then demanded payment, in bitcoin, to unfreeze the systems. North Koreans\ntailored some ransomware code and then propagated it from one device to the next by\nappropriating a dangerous piece of American code, known as EternalBlue, that a criminal\ngroup calling itself the Shadow Brokers had stolen from the N.S.A. and then posted online.\n\nA twenty-two-year-old hacker and malware expert from England named Marcus Hutchins,\nwho worked out of a bedroom in his parents’ house, analyzed the Wannacry code and\nfigured out how to direct much of the traffic that it was generating into a “sinkhole”—a Web\naddress where the malware would do no harm. After Hutchins realized that he had upended\nthe hack, Wired [reported, he went upstairs to tell his family. His mother, a nurse, was](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-marcus-hutchins-hacker-who-saved-the-internet/)\nchopping onions. “Well done, sweetheart,” she said, before returning to her cooking.\n\nThe North Korean regime has long been considered a fundamentally criminal enterprise.\nJoseph Bermudez, Jr., a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,\ntold me that the country’s survival has always been underpinned by a mafia-like “patronage\nsystem.” He explained that, even before the Korean War, smugglers and warlords had\nthrived in the region. Since the birth of the D.P.R.K., crime has been used to garner not only\ncash for the regime but also political and social capital. The Kims, Bermudez said, have\nfostered a “desire to produce revenue to secure pleasure with the leader.”\n\nUntil recently, North Korea’s most lucrative state-sponsored criminal operations included the\nsmuggling of cigarettes, the creation of counterfeit money, the trading of endangered\nspecies, and the manufacture and distribution of laboratory-made illegal drugs such as\nmethamphetamine. In the seventies, North Korean diplomats who were posted abroad often\ntrafficked narcotics. In the eighties, North Korean counterfeiters created a remarkably\n[plausible hundred-dollar “supernote.” (In 2006, the Secret Service estimated that it had](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2006/INTERPOL-holds-Supernote-summit-to-address-US-dollar-counterfeiting)\nremoved fifty million dollars’ worth of fake notes from circulation; seven years later, the U.S.\n\n\n-----\n\nTreasury redesigned its hundred-dollar bill with extra security features.) Many traditional\ncriminal revenue streams continue to flow back to Pyongyang, but in the past decade the\nstate’s focus has pivoted to the Internet.\n\nThe range and creativity of North Korea’s digital crime spree caught many off guard. It wasn’t\njust that Pyongyang’s cyber warriors could compromise computer networks around the world;\nthey showed real innovation in exploiting new technologies. Luke Dembosky, an attorney\nwho advises companies on Internet-security issues, first confronted North Korea’s cyber\nthreat at the time of the Sony hack, when he was the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in\nthe Justice Department’s National Security Division. Then he witnessed the Bangladesh\nheist—a striking leap in sophistication. “It was stunning for someone like me, despite years in\nthis business, to see a relatively isolated nation-state actor not simply copying someone\nelse’s methodology or scheme but actually breaking new ground,” he said.\n\nPriscilla Moriuchi, the Harvard analyst, told me that, in retrospect, the D.P.R.K.’s turn to\ncybercrime had been an organic development. “North Koreans understand criminality,” she\nsaid. “They’re integrated in many, many places with this criminal and gray underground\nworld. And so it’s natural to overlay this new technology, the Internet. It connects criminal\norganizations and smugglers with one another.”\n\nWe discussed the Japanese A.T.M. scam of 2016. Shimomura may not have known his\nultimate boss, but the yakuza had been smuggling illegal products out of North Korea for\ndecades. Around the turn of the millennium, North Korea supplied about forty per cent of\nJapan’s methamphetamines. So, if cyber scammers in Pyongyang needed boots on the\nground to withdraw cash in Nagoya, they could make a request, and it would soon be\nanswered.\n\nMoriuchi also noted that, although the North Korean hackers were technically accomplished,\ntheir more important attribute was a felonious savoir-faire. In the Bangladesh Bank case, the\nrobbers waited seventeen months after their first reconnaissance in Dhaka before they pulled\noff the heist. They had determined the ideal weekend and holiday to strike; they had planned\nhow to move cash quickly out of recipient banks; and they had chosen institutions that had\nparticularly lax know-your-customer protocols. Once they executed the theft, they used local\ncontractors in the Philippines to launder their pesos, effectively hiding the money trail. Their\nsuccess was predicated on knowing not only how computers work but how people do.\n“They’re smart,” Moriuchi told me. “It’s this connection of the virtual world and the physical\nthat’s so impressive.”\n\nIn most countries, hackers develop their skills by experimenting on computers at home when\nthey are teen-agers. Marcus Hutchins, who dismantled Wannacry, was one such high-school\nrecluse. But North Korea’s talent in the cybercrime field is grown in a hothouse. Few families\nown computers, and the state jealously guards Internet access.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe process by which North Korean hackers are spotted and trained appears to be similar to\nthe way Olympians were once cultivated in the former Soviet bloc. Martyn Williams, a fellow\nat the Stimson Center think tank who studies North Korea, explained that, whereas\nconventional warfare requires the expensive and onerous development of weaponry, a\nhacking program needs only intelligent people. And North Korea, despite lacking many other\nresources, “is not short of human capital.”\n\nThe most promising students are encouraged to use computers at schools. Those who excel\nat mathematics are placed at specialized high schools. The best students can travel abroad,\nto compete in such events as the International Mathematical Olympiad. Many winners of the\nFields Medal, the celebrated prize in mathematics, placed highly in the contest when they\nwere teen-agers.\n\nStudents from North Korea often perform impressively at the I.M.O. (It is also the only\ncountry to have been disqualified for suspected cheating: the D.P.R.K. team was ejected\ntwice from the competition, in 1991 and in 2010.) At the 2019 I.M.O., held in Bath, England,\nKuk Song Hyon scored perfectly on the first five of six challenges, and was tied for first place\nwith students from China, South Korea, Poland, and the U.S. until the final problem, when he\nreceived a low score.\n\nTwo colleges in Pyongyang, Kim Chaek University of Technology and Kim Il Sung University,\nvacuum up the most talented teen-agers from the specialized math and computer high\nschools and then teach them advanced code. These institutions often outperform American\nand Chinese colleges in the International Collegiate Programming Contest—a festival of\nunsurpassed and joyful nerdery. At the 2019 I.C.P.C. finals, held in Porto, Portugal, Kim\nChaek University placed eighth, ahead of Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, and Stanford.\n\nCostin-Andrei Oncescu, who represented the University of Oxford at the 2019 I.C.P.C., and\nwho began programming competitively in his native Romania at the age of ten, told me that\nthe I.C.P.C. was not only fun and sociable but also a recruiting ground for big technology\ncompanies. Huawei sponsored the 2019 finals. Contestants, Oncescu said, have gone on to\ndo impressive coding work. He mentioned Nikolai Durov, a member of the championshipwinning St. Petersburg State University teams of 2000 and 2001, who subsequently co[founded the Russian social-media apps VK and Telegram.](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-whatsapp-rival-goes-beyond-messaging)\n\nOncescu added that the North Koreans had stayed in the same hotel as the other\ncontestants in Porto. But he hadn’t seen them socialize with students from other countries.\nHe said that, although the competitions tested coding fluency, the true test was of a more\ngeneral problem-solving capability. It often came down to pure math. To thrive, every team\nneeded at least one “very math-oriented” person, Oncescu said. Students working in teams\nof three were asked to create code that provided a solution to an abstract puzzle, but only\none team member at a time wrote the code.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe coding challenges at the 2019 I.C.P.C. were fiendishly difficult. An example: Your\nuniversity’s board game club just hosted a checkers tournament, and you were assigned to\ntake notes on the games. Unfortunately, while walking home, you dropped all of your papers\ninto a puddle! Disaster! Much of what you wrote is now unreadable; all you have left are\nsome lists of moves played in the middle of various games. Is there some way you can\nreconstruct what happened in those games?” The code that the students built needed to\nsolve this problem in no more than a second. Oncescu said that, to win the competition, you\nhad to work fast, collaboratively, and creatively. “The hardest part isn’t the coding,” he told\nme. “It’s the thinking.”\n\nHe added that there was a lot of overlap between contestants at these kinds of competitions\nand the “next generation” of top programmers and researchers. He could also imagine how\nsuch competitions might develop the skills of a criminal hacker, because “once you’ve found\nsomething weird about the way a system works, then it does become a mathematical\nproblem in trying to take advantage of that.” The coding and the analytical skills on display at\n[such events were like the Force in the “Star Wars” movies: it could be used for the light side,](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/star-wars)\nor for the dark.\n\nAccording to many estimates, about seven thousand North Koreans work in the country’s\ncyber program. Employees are split between the General Staff Department of the military,\nwhich assists the Army’s operations, and the Reconnaissance General Bureau, which is akin\nto the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the U.S. The 2019 Korea University\npaper featured an analysis of how hackers were divided within these silos. The General Staff\nDepartment has among its subgroups the chillingly named Enemy Collapse Sabotage\nBureau, which is responsible for “information and psychological warfare.”\n\nMost of the criminal work is performed by the Reconnaissance General Bureau. According to\nthe Korea University researchers, a section of the R.G.B. known as Unit 180 is responsible\nfor “conducting cyber operations to steal foreign money from outside North Korea.” The\nLazarus Group is the best-known unit of North Korean commercial hackers, but this entity\nmay include—or have been partially replaced by—other groups, which are known to Western\nlaw-enforcement and intelligence agencies by such names as the BeagleBoyz, Hidden Cobra,\nand APT38. (“APT” stands for “advanced persistent threat.”) Nobody seems to have a firm\ngrasp on how many people work for each group or which group makes the most money.\n\nAnother tantalizing question is where, geographically, North Korea’s hackers do their work.\nMoriuchi, the Harvard fellow, has spent years tracking the metadata of North Korean Internet\nusers. Between 2017 and 2020, she looked at North Korea’s tiny online footprint. At any\nmoment, as few as a couple of hundred I.P. addresses in the country might be in use. From\nthis and other clues, she concluded that most of the country’s coders were working outside\nNorth Korea, in China and parts of Southeast Asia. Certainly, Moriuchi said, most of North\nKorea’s new I.T. graduates appeared to spend a period of time abroad in such countries,\nwhere they learned valuable “real world” skills. These foreign units were, in essence, both\nprofit generators and training grounds\n\n\n-----\n\nRecently, an American analyst showed me the digital footprint of a cell that, he ascertained,\nconsisted of North Koreans working in the border town of Dandong, China. The unit’s work\nwas seemingly anodyne—there was no evidence that it engaged in malicious hacking.\nCommunicating through the e-mail address bravemaster619@hotmail.com, the group\nsolicited for freelance gigs on coder sites, in almost flawless English. Bravemaster619’s\nprofile on GitHub reads, “Wanna have your own website? Wanna add some features or\ncustomize the design of your existing system? Wanna improve your site to the next level?\nHold my seasoned development skills!” The North Korean workers in Dandong did not\nadvertise their nationality—presumably because of the sanction provisions—and appeared to\ncharge competitive rates.\n\nLast year, I spoke to Lee Hyun Seung, a thirty-five-year-old who defected from North Korea\nin 2014 and now lives in the United States. He had worked in a trading business owned by\nthe D.P.R.K. government, and in that capacity he had lived for a time in Dalian, China. He\nsaid that he had no special knowledge of the hacking program, but that when he worked in\nDalian he knew there were three teams of North Korean “I.T. workers” based in the city. Lee\ntold me that he once visited a so-called hacker dorm in Dalian. The men there lived four to a\nroom—sometimes six. The ten or so men who worked in one such unit told Lee that they\nspent most of their time making “big money” by designing mobile-phone video games for the\nJapanese, South Korean, and Chinese markets. A Chinese intermediary sold their products.\nLee suggested that, though this coding work was mundane, the North Koreans he met rarely\nwanted to be promoted—because a promotion would mean returning to Pyongyang.\n\nThis anecdotal evidence was buttressed by another defector, who runs a South Korea-based\nclandestine radio network whose broadcast signal penetrated North Korea. He told me that\nhe was familiar with the D.P.R.K.’s cyber program, and, as he understood it, the work\nperformed by North Korean I.T. workers outside the country tended to be “low level.” The\nstars of the program either were kept in Pyongyang or were returned there to do their most\nimportant government work—a tactic that prevented hackers engaged in high-priority\noperations from being caught while abroad. The defector told me that the best hackers in\nPyongyang, who were involved in schemes that collected millions of dollars’ worth of foreign\ncurrency, were rewarded with cars or comfortable houses, or with other material benefits\nknown as Kim Jong Un’s Special Gifts, which were impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain.\nThis information, the defector said, came from a friend in North Korea whom he could\n“absolutely trust,” but who could not speak with me without risking his life.\n\nAn American investigator of sanction breaches, who works at a prominent N.G.O. but was\nnot authorized to talk on the record, was similarly convinced that the élite cadre of North\nKorean hackers was based in Pyongyang. Most likely, these operatives used foreign V.P.N.s\n—virtual private networks—to access the Internet from outside the country, thus masking\ntheir location.\n\n\n-----\n\nJohn Demers, of the Justice Department, suspects that the Chinese state assists with North\nKorean cybercrime, because it “does not want North Korea to fail.” The American\ninvestigator of sanction breaches noted that “North Korea is connected to the world through\nessentially Russian and Chinese infrastructure,” adding, “There are strong indications that\nRussia and China are well aware of what’s going on and actively have facilitated some of it.”\nA certain amount of legal and illegal trade continues across North Korea’s borders with\nRussia and China, both of which have historically been allies. According to the U.S.\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, no financial institution in Russia or China\nhas been targeted by North Korean hackers.\n\nThe most common target of North Korea’s cyber army is its sworn enemy, South Korea,\nwhich has suffered many hundreds of major attacks. Recently, I spoke to Simon Choi, a\nsecurity-intelligence analyst who lives in Seoul. In 2008, while performing mandatory military\nservice, he learned about North Korea waging a cyberattack on the South Korean Army—an\nunsuccessful attempt by the Reconnaissance General Bureau to deploy malware in order to\nsteal highly classified weapons secrets. Choi became fascinated with the threat posed by\nNorth Korean hackers. “I realized the cyber war was real,” he said.\n\nAfter completing his military service, Choi took a job in online security. He also began to\norganize a team of volunteers in South Korea, called the IssueMakers Lab, which pores over\nmalware attributed to the North Koreans, in order to understand it better. The group now\nnumbers ten people, and includes men and women. Although the members are amateurs,\nnot spies, their assessments are considered to be rigorous and acute. In his day job, Choi\ntrawls the dark Web, investigating drug deals and other crimes on behalf of law-enforcement\nagencies; after hours, he thinks about hackers in Pyongyang.\n\nChoi told me that about eleven hundred North Koreans have written malicious scripts. He\nshowed me some malware code, written in 2016, that had been designed to cover the tracks\nof a North Korean bank heist. The malware consisted of rows of seemingly random letters\nand numbers flowing down a page, in pairs. In the margins were some recognizable Englishlanguage words—“Windows,” “everyone”—connected by cryptic punctuation. Choi could\nfluently and sensitively parse all this. Chinese and American coders were the best in the\nworld, he said, but Russians and North Koreans were tied for second. Of all the malware that\nChoi had examined, he reserved his greatest admiration for the Stuxnet worm, which had\nbeen used in a successful joint Israeli-American attack on Iran’s nuclear centrifuges, in 2010.\nHe spoke about the Stuxnet code in the way that an art historian might discuss “The Night\nWatch”: it was “elegant,” “precise,” “sophisticated.” Choi told me that North Korean code was\n“masculine” in its brute concision: “Very simple, very practical, and they always go straight for\ntheir aim and goal.” He added, “The key to their success is their relentlessness—they just\nattack, endlessly.”\n\nSometimes, he explained, coders embedded signatures or initials into their scripts. It was a\nform of tagging, or maybe even bragging. He had occasionally noticed the initials of former\nInternational Math Olympiad competitors in malware that he examined Once when\n\n\n-----\n\nexamining code related to a 2013 spear-phishing attempt on I.C.I.C.I., an Indian bank, Choi\nnoticed a tag, kut_rsc1994, belonging to a coder who had studied at Kim Chaek University.\n(“KUT” is an established tag for the school.) On further inspection, Choi came to believe that\nthe coder was Ryu Song Chol, who had won a silver medal for North Korea at the I.M.O., in\nAmsterdam, in 2011. Later, Ryu posted this tag on a hacking Web site, seemingly confirming\nthe link.\n\nChoi was circumspect about attributing coding tags to real-life people: who could know for\nsure which person was behind which persona? The North Koreans could well have swapped\nidentities. He felt confident, though, that he had never examined code written by a North\nKorean woman. I laughed when he told me this. How could he possibly know? “These are all\nguys,” he repeated. North Korea, he said, remained a traditional, male-dominated society,\nand it was extremely unlikely that the Reconnaissance General Bureau would train women\nfor such work.\n\nThe IssueMakers often gave nicknames to the most accomplished North Korean hackers,\nalthough Choi wouldn’t tell me the names of anybody currently working for Pyongyang. I\nwondered whether he had ever felt as if he understood these coders as people. “I think we\nhave a mutual awareness,” he told me. “They must see what we analyze as well, because\nwe publish it. That’s my feeling—that we are both aware of each other.”\n\nThe Internet, to abuse John Donne, makes one little room an everywhere. North Korea’s\nhackers have conducted operations in more than a hundred and fifty countries. In November,\n2018, a programmer in Santiago, Chile, was recruited for a high-level position at a foreign\nfirm. The programmer, who worked at Redbanc, a network that connects all the A.T.M.s in\nChile, was invited via LinkedIn to apply for a position developing software at Global\nProcessing Centre, a third-party-payment processor in St. John’s, Antigua. The position was\nlucrative and part time: the programmer could supplement his income without impinging on\nhis work for Redbanc.\n\nGlobal Processing Centre’s job offer came from someone purporting to be Justin StuartYoung, the company’s chief information officer. The Redbanc programmer was directed to a\nprivate e-mail address for Stuart-Young. The courtship progressed to a video interview, in\nwhich Stuart-Young interviewed the programmer in Spanish. After at least three more\ninterviews, during which Stuart-Young said that he was looking forward to visiting Chile\nsomeday to meet in person, the Redbanc employee was asked to download and run a\nprogram that generated a PDF of a résumé. He did as instructed, but he never heard from\nStuart-Young again. (The Redbanc programmer has since resigned, and the company would\nnot identify him.)\n\nWhile the programmer and Stuart-Young were corresponding, a cybersecurity professional\nnamed Juan Roa Salinas started in a new role at Redbanc. As he inspected the company’s\ninternal network, he saw signs that it had been compromised. There were unusual\n\n\n-----\n\nconnections to Internet domain names that he would not have expected to see on the\nnetwork.\n\nA voracious reader of tech news, Roa had been fascinated by the North Korean attack on\nBangladesh Bank and had studied the activities of the Lazarus Group and APT38. He had\nlearned about North Korea’s FASTCash attacks, such as the one deployed in Japan. As he\ninvestigated the “strange behavior” in the Redbanc network, he and members of the\ncompany’s response team concluded that the business was under attack from a nation-state\nactor, most likely from Pyongyang. Among other clues, a Redbanc terminal had inexplicably\nlooked up an I.P. address in North Korea. Roa, judging that the threat was severe,\nrecommended that Redbanc shut off its Internet for a week.\n\nRoa remembers that his bosses found his request “shocking,” but they complied. An internal\ninquiry after the shutdown revealed that the company had indeed been in the middle of an\nattempted FASTCash breach. Such assaults normally take several months to execute. The\nhackers had first used a third-party criminal group for “social engineering.” The social\nengineers had mimicked a job offer from a real company in Antigua, using fake but\nconvincing e-mail addresses and even impersonating an executive, Justin Stuart-Young,\nusing a Spanish-speaking actor who roughly fit his description. (When I spoke to the real\nStuart-Young recently, it was the first time he had heard of the Chile attack, and of his identity\nbeing stolen.)\n\nWhen the Redbanc programmer had run the infected program, it had activated a “dropper,”\nwhich granted hackers remote control of his computer. The hackers then made a series of\nlateral moves across other computers on the company’s network. Their goal was to\ncompromise Microsoft’s Active Directory system at Redbanc, which connects users with\nresources. By the time Roa noticed the intrusion, the hackers had not yet achieved this\nobjective. The next stage of the operation would have been to gain control of the mainframe\nat Redbanc, and then to initiate the FASTCash attack itself, which would use malware to\nconceal fraudulent withdrawal requests made at A.T.M.s. Roa purged the hackers from the\nRedbanc network before they could overtake the mainframe.\n\nAfter the attempted raid, Redbanc did what many companies subjected to such threats do: it\nkept quiet and improved its security. The FASTCash attack at Redbanc became public only\nbecause Felipe Harboe, then a Chilean senator, heard about it at a meeting of security\nexperts and decided to tweet the news. Harboe told me last fall that he had broken\nRedbanc’s silence because South American institutions were now under constant threat from\nNorth Korean and Russian hacking groups. Redbanc officials, he said, were “surprised and\nupset” that Harboe had exposed their breach, but he felt that the problem required more\ntransparency. There had been other A.T.M. attacks in Chile, and ransomware schemes—in\nwhich hackers take control of a computer network and demand a fee for returning systems to\nnormal—were even more common. Many ransomware operations started like the one at\nRedbanc, relying on a single weak point of entry.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe North Koreans failure at Redbanc was only a minor inconvenience. The hackers\nstrategy is to catch many fish by casting a wide net. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency has noted that, around the time of the attack on Redbanc, North Korean\nactors set in motion successful FASTCash assaults on dozens of banks in Asia and Africa,\nstealing tens of millions of dollars. In a single breach in 2017, money was simultaneously\nwithdrawn from A.T.M.s in more than thirty countries.\n\nPriscilla Moriuchi believes that in the past two years the aesthetic of North Korean\ncybercriminals has become subtler. In addition to targeting big financial institutions, they\nhave developed a faster, less flamboyant “operational tempo.” She explained, “They’ve\nmanaged to routinize financial fraud, attacks on smaller financial institutions and regular\ncitizens. They’re much more like a normal criminal group now.”\n\nA report published in March by the U.N. panel of experts noted that one new avenue for\nNorth Korean cybercriminals is the theft of military information, either to sell or to harvest for\nthe country’s weapons program. But the most reliable money-maker for North Korea has\nbecome the theft of cryptocurrency.\n\nJesse Spiro, who is in charge of policy initiatives at Chainalysis, a private company that\ninvestigates cryptocurrency-related crime, told me recently that North Korean hackers have\nstolen at least $1.75 billion in digital coins from trading exchanges. This revenue stream\nalone could cover about ten per cent of North Korea’s total defense budget.\n\nNorth Korea’s crypto-exchange hacks have a relatively straightforward methodology.\n[Exchanges that trade bitcoin and other types of cryptocurrency typically hold escrow](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/22/the-prophets-of-cryptocurrency-survey-the-boom-and-bust)\naccounts full of their customers’ coins. These storage facilities are known as “hot wallets,”\nbecause they are connected to the Internet. (A more secure but laborious method of storing\ncoins is in an offline “cold wallet” containing, say, QR-code printouts that contain the keys to\nblockchain accounts.) Hackers from North Korea often gain access to an exchange’s internal\nsystems using the same types of manipulations involved in the failed attempt in Chile. Realsounding people propose real-sounding schemes, then persuade a network user at a\ntargeted company to download an infected document. Typically, one or two admin-level\nmembers at a cryptocurrency exchange have access to a hot wallet’s private keys. If hackers\ncan compromise a sufficiently senior figure, they can reach the wallet and steal its coins.\n\nTom Robinson, the chief scientist at the blockchain-analytics firm Elliptic, who tracks the\nproceeds of cryptocurrency hacks for governmental and private clients, told me that\ncryptocurrency trades have become attractive targets for North Korean hackers: “Once the\nfunds have moved out of the exchange, you can’t reverse those transactions, like you can\nmaybe with a traditional bank payment. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. And there’s no\nintermediary, there’s no controller of bitcoin, who you can go to and say, ‘Those funds are\nstolen. Give them back to me.’ It’s completely decentralized. It can also be fairly anonymous\n—you don’t need to enact the scheme through accounts linked to your identity.”\n\n\n-----\n\nRobinson said that one of the most successful fake personas used by the Lazarus Group\nwas Waliy Darwish—a man who supposedly worked for a cryptocurrency company, based in\nMichigan, called Celas L.L.C. The Lazarus Group invented both Darwish and Celas. LinkedIn\nprofiles and other pages related to the persona and to the company are still active. On\nLinkedIn, Darwish poses as a graduate of the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences and\nsays that his interests include Rolls-Royces. He also claims, ungrammatically but somewhat\ntruthfully, to “know how to act the blockchain in cryptocurrency.” In February, an F.B.I.\n[indictment against three suspected North Korean hackers noted that some malicious](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/3-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and)\nsoftware created by the Lazarus Group and purporting to be a cryptocurrency-trading\nprogram was called Celas Trade Pro.\n\nIn the spring of 2018, the Darwish-Celas mirage was convincing enough to bait employees of\na cryptocurrency exchange in Hong Kong into downloading infected software. (An\ninvestigation into this operation continues, and investigators believe that confirming the\nidentity of the exchange might damage an ongoing inquiry.) Within a few weeks of the\nmalware’s installation, the hackers had stolen about ten thousand eight hundred bitcoins\nfrom the exchange’s hot wallet. The coins, then worth around ninety-four million dollars,\nwould now be worth more than half a billion dollars.\n\nThe money-laundering patterns that typically follow such raids are dizzying. Elliptic has\ntraced what happened to the coins from the Hong Kong-exchange hack. Robinson explained\nthat all the stolen coins were forwarded to a wallet maintained by the hackers, then split into\ndozens of small amounts and sent, through different routes, to another exchange. Such an\natomized transfer of money is known as a “peel chain.” When Robinson showed me a\ndiagram of the dispersal of coins, I was reminded of an airline-magazine route map in which\nseveral lines sprout from one dot and then converge on another.\n\nA peel chain is designed to outwit automatic alerts, which search for the transit of a precise\nvolume of cryptocurrency. The stolen coins were sent to two Chinese men, Tian Yinyin and Li\nJiadong, who had opened accounts on other exchanges, including one in the U.S., using\nfake pictures and fake names. They then cashed out the coins and transferred the money to\nChinese banks. According to the U.S. Treasury, several financial institutions in China offer\naccounts to North Koreans, or to front companies that have relationships with Pyongyang.\n[Last year, Tian and Li were indicted in the United States for allegedly laundering “over a](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-nationals-charged-laundering-over-100-million-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack)\nhundred million dollars’ worth of stolen cryptocurrency to obscure transactions for the benefit\nof actors in North Korea” between 2017 and 2019. They remain at large.\n\nIn 2019, the U.N. listed dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges that had been hacked by the\nNorth Koreans. One exchange in Seoul, Bithumb, was successfully raided four times—a\ntremendous failure of security. Since the U.N. report was published, the refinement of the\nattacks has only deepened, as has the skill with which the proceeds of crime are laundered.\nAccording to Jesse Spiro, of Chainalysis, fifteen cryptocurrency heists have been reported so\nfar this year. It is too early to say how many will be attributed to North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpiro noted that the authorities were increasingly on the lookout for such schemes.\nAwareness of peel chains, for example, has become widespread; the tactic is “relatively easy\nto trace if you have blockchain forensics or analysis capabilities,” he said. But new\nobfuscation techniques have emerged. Professional money launderers offer such services\nas CoinJoin, which mixes stolen and non-stolen coins to confuse forensic analysts.\n\nIf one compared the industry and the manpower that went into planning and executing the\nBangladesh heist with the almost casual way in which digital tokens are often stolen, it would\nbe evident why the North Koreans have come to favor such exchange heists. Spiro told me\nthat private forensics firms and law-enforcement agencies were finally addressing the\nproblem with the seriousness it deserved. Understanding how to track cryptocurrency is an\nincreasingly important skill, not least because North Korean hackers, and members of many\ncriminal gangs, accept ransomware payments in digital currency. Between 2019 and 2020,\n[according to Chainalysis, ransomware incidents rose by more than three hundred per cent.](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets)\n\nEven if other laundering techniques become well known and stolen coins could be readily\nflagged, the key to making such heists unprofitable is to stop thieves from cashing out. This\nis unlikely anytime soon, Spiro said, because of the lax practices of certain Chinese, Eastern\nEuropean, and Southeast Asian exchanges. At a press conference to announce the\nFebruary indictments against the three North Korean hackers, John Demers, of the Justice\nDepartment, made a pointed reference to such facilitators, saying that it was past time “for\nRussia and China, as well as any other countries whose entities or nationals play a role in\nthe D.P.R.K. revenue-generation efforts, to take action.”\n\nWhat good will such statements do? The U.S. has failed for a decade to find an effective\nresponse to the North Korean cyber threat. Luke Dembosky, the former Deputy Assistant\nAttorney General, worked with Sony throughout the 2014 crisis. At the time, some security\nexperts doubted that North Korea was capable of such an attack. Dembosky told me that “we\nwould not have sent Obama to the podium lightly,” but when the President did speak it was in\nmeasured terms. North Korea was accused of “vandalism” instead of a more serious crime.\nDavid Maxwell, a former Special Forces colonel who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation\nfor Defense of Democracies, a conservative think tank, told me that it was hard to know what\nto do about a country behaving like a gang: “North Korea often operates below the threshold\nof a strategic response. Something like the Sony hack—that was an attack on a company. It\nwasn’t something that our government defended against.”\n\nSeveral government agencies—including the F.B.I., the N.S.A., and the Secret Service—are\nnow working aggressively to address the threat. The F.B.I.’s indictments against hackers\nfrom the Lazarus Group outline the unit’s alleged crimes in detail. One indictment noted that\nthe hackers had “attempted to steal or extort more than $1.3 billion” from “entertainment\ncompanies, financial institutions, cryptocurrency companies, online casinos, cleared defense\ncontractors, energy utilities, and individuals.” The F.B.I. also recently arrested and charged a\nCanadian-American man who allegedly laundered money for the North Koreans.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly, an American blockchain expert named Virgil Griffith was indicted in January, 2020,\nin the Southern District of New York, for contravening U.S. sanctions against North Korea.\nGriffith had travelled to Pyongyang in 2019 to give a speech at a cryptocurrency conference.\nThe [complaint against Griffith alleges that he was instructed by his North Korean hosts to](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1222646/download)\nfocus his presentation on “the potential money laundering and sanction evasion applications\nof cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.” Griffith has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe unsealed indictments are a boon to journalists and researchers, but the chances of any\nNorth Korean hacker being prosecuted successfully are vanishingly slim. There is, however,\na growing recognition in America of the threat presented by cybercriminals. President Joe\nBiden has secured ten billion dollars for federal agencies dealing with the issue of\ncybercrime. A government adviser told me that one major remedy being considered is the\nestablishment of new protocols that will allow agencies to work much more closely with\nprivate security companies, which often perform the best cybercrime forensic work.\n\nThe national-security threat posed by North Korean hackers is less obvious than the one\nposed by Russian hackers, who have notoriously interfered in U.S. elections. The Obama\nAdministration’s special adviser on cybersecurity, Michael Daniel, is now the president and\nC.E.O. of the Cyber Threat Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the\nsharing of intelligence about the threats posed by online crime. He told me that North Korea\npresented unique difficulties for law-enforcement agencies, not only because its criminal\nactivity was mixed up with its intelligence-gathering capabilities but also because its\ngangsterism now interferes with crucial networks in other countries, such as health-care\noperations. “When you get ransomware hitting medical systems during a pandemic, that’s no\nlonger just a monetary threat,” Daniel said.\n\nNorth Korea’s cybercrime perpetrators often seem like faceless, amoral criminals. They also\nseem like victims. Costin-Andrei Oncescu, the Oxford programmer, was saddened to think of\nbrilliant young North Korean minds being wasted in schemes to rob banks and install\nransomware. But it is almost impossible to learn the stories of people from the program.\nDavid Maxwell, the former Special Forces colonel, told me that the few defectors from the\nReconnaissance General Bureau’s cyber units had generally immigrated to South Korea,\nwhere they had immediately fallen under the supervision of the country’s intelligence\nservices. Occasionally, however, it is possible to glimpse the path imposed on Kim Jong Un’s\n“brave warriors.”\n\nRi Jong Yol was a mathematics prodigy. He was born into an academic family outside\nPyongyang in 1998. By the time he entered first grade, at the age of seven, he had been\nstudying daily with a private tutor, and had already mastered the entire elementary-school\nsyllabus. In middle school, he entered and won a national mathematics competition, and he\nwas selected to attend a high school for gifted children. At fifteen, he was the youngest\nmember of North Korea’s team at the 2013 International Math Olympiad, in Santa Marta,\nColombia.\n\n\n-----\n\nRi was a tall, gregarious, good-looking boy who liked playing volleyball and Ping-Pong.\nUnlike his teammates at the I.M.O., he enjoyed meeting the kids from other countries. He\nsaw foreign teen-agers accessing the Internet in their spare time and wondered if he might\ngive it a try. He had never been online. (The few computer terminals that he’d seen in village\nschools weren’t connected to the Internet, and he’d never even seen the machines turned\non, because the schools rarely had electricity.) In the end, Ri did not submit to temptation. He\nknew that he would be severely punished if he was caught.\n\nRi won a silver medal at his first I.M.O.—an exceptional result for such a young contestant.\nIn 2014 and 2015, he made the team again, travelling to Cape Town, South Africa, and then\nto Chiang Mai, Thailand. He won silver medals at both events. Ri remembers how happy he\nwas seeing other contestants who returned year after year. He also struck up friendships\nwith South Korea’s team members, with whom he shared a language. They were meant to\nbe his enemies, but Ri couldn’t see the harm in talking to them.\n\nAfter he returned from the 2015 I.M.O., an acquaintance who worked at a local Workers’\nParty office told him that senior figures from a secretive government agency were\ninterviewing Ri’s friends and relatives. He instantly knew what was about to happen: the\nstate would harness his talent for numbers by giving him a job as a hacker, or as a\nfunctionary in the nuclear program. Apparently, the state had decided that he didn’t need to\ngo to college before he began a career of secretive labor. The prospect filled him with dread.\nWorking in the most guarded sections of the military meant that you were cut off from society.\nHe would have no freedom whatsoever. He also realized that if he were instructed to join\nsuch an agency he could not refuse.\n\nRi knew that he could compete in the I.M.O. until he was eighteen, which meant that he\ncould participate in one more competition before being recruited: an event at the Hong Kong\nUniversity of Science and Technology. The North Korean mathletes were not heavily\nsupervised at the competition, and Ri was on friendly terms with the teachers who\naccompanied the team. After winning another silver medal, Ri took his chance. He walked\nout of the dorm where he was staying and hailed a cab to the airport, where—with the help of\na friendly airline worker—he found the address of the South Korean consulate. He took\nanother taxi there and told a South Korean diplomat that he wished to defect. He then spent\nseventy days in Hong Kong, waiting nervously while the South Korean delegation negotiated\nhis safe passage to Seoul. (After Ri’s defection, North Korea suspended its I.M.O. program\nfor two years, and now sends a government agent with the team, to insure that nobody\nescapes.)\n\nRi is now twenty-three and goes by a South Korean name. He is studying mathematics at\nSeoul National University. He has not seen his parents since he defected. In a recent\nconversation, he told me that he had developed his escape plan without any outside help,\nbut he may have been protecting his loved ones. In North Korea, the families of defectors\noften meet grim fates. Ri said that he had no regrets about leaving his native country. Since\n\n\n-----\n\nhis escape, he has considered how his talent would have been squandered had he stayed in\nPyongyang. In Seoul, he saw only possibilities. He told me, with excitement, that he was\nhoping to spend a year in the United States, on an exchange program.\n\nOne of the first things that Ri did after he landed in South Korea in 2016 was go online. With\nthe help of a mentor, he set up a Gmail account. The mentor then encouraged him to make\nhis first Google search. He was momentarily at a loss. In North Korea, where information\nwas strictly controlled, Ri’s curiosity had been insatiable. But now, with the world seemingly\nat his fingertips, he felt overwhelmed by choice. There was so much to know. Ri opened a\nsearch box and typed “북한/北韓”: “North Korea.” ♦\n\nAn early printing of this story misstated the approximate latitude of the border between North\nand South Korea.
