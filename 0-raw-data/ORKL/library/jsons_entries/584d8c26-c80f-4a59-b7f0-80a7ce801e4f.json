    "plain_text": "# DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors)**\n\nMany people are hearing the term UNC for the first time after we published details of a threat\n[group we refer to as UNC2452. “UNC” groups—or “uncategorized” groups—are raw](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nattribution analysis that we previously kept primarily in house. We recently began rolling out\n[UNC information to Mandiant Advantage customers because we want to give users direct](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/advantage.html)\naccess to source materials and raw analysis that Mandiant experts use to write intelligence,\nrespond to breaches, and defend our clients. In light of recent events, we want to provide\nsome more details to the greater public on the UNC designation.\n\n**What is an UNC?**\n\nAn [UNC group is a cluster of cyber intrusion activity—which includes observable artifacts](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/clustering-and-associating-attacker-activity-at-scale.html)\nsuch as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft—that we are not yet ready to give a\nclassification such as APT or FIN. UNCs are created based on a defining, anchoring\ncharacteristic often discovered during a single incident. As we discover new artifacts\nassociated with other incidents and proactive collections efforts, the UNC provides a\nframework to join discrete pieces of evidence together. These clusters can grow, merge with,\nor break off from other clusters, potentially become combined under a TEMP name, such as\nTEMP.Warlock, and/or 'graduate' into fully defined groups, such as FIN11, as depicted in\nFigure 1. In exposing UNC groups in Mandiant Advantage, we are providing a way for users\nto track the groups that might become APT and FIN groups before they 'graduate' into fully\ndefined threat groups and are announced publicly.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: UNC902 to FIN11\n\n**Why UNCs Matter**\n\nIt is important to note that UNCs can undergo significant changes over time based on our\nevolving understanding of old and new evidence. UNC churn can get messy, that’s why we\nconsider UNCs to reflect raw to maturing stages in the attribution process. The road from an\ninitial UNC to an APT or a FIN group typically takes years of painstaking collections,\nresearch, and analysis; thousands of pieces of evidence; hundreds of hours of work. But it is\nworth it! We strongly believe that attribution analysis, as it grows and matures, generates\ncompounding returns for network defenders, equipping them to classify and prioritize\nresponse and remediation efforts, as well as predict and prevent some attacks, see Table 1.\nEven at early phases, UNCs can provide powerful intelligence value.\n\n**UNC characteristics** **Intelligence value**\n\n\n**Tactical** Indicators such as\nmalware, domains, IPs,\nCVEs exploited\n\n\nBlock lists, detections signatures, patching\npriorities\n\n\n-----\n\n**Operational** Patterns in behavior, for\nexample frequency of\noperations, commonly\nused tools, target\nlocations and sectors\n\n**Strategic** Motives, goals; Potential\nsponsors, associates\n\n\nEstablish monitoring and mitigations for known\nTTPs, identify new infrastructure registration or\nother patterns attempt to predict activity\n\nWork the threat group into organizational risk\nassessment. Consider which threat actors are\nmost likely to affect my organization and why,\nidentify worst-case scenarios from a\ncompromise.\n\n\nTable 1: Intelligence value of attribution at various stages\n\n**How to Use UNCs: Case Studies**\n\n_UNC1878_\n\n[We first discussed UNC1878 publicly in March 2020, describing how an initial TrickBot](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/the-cycle-of-adversary-pursuit.html)\ncompromise fairly quickly led to the installation of an interactive backdoor and lateral\nmovement. This incident was detected and contained before additional attacker actions were\nobserved, but nonetheless, it fueled additional research and allowed us to link a later\ncompromise where RYUK ransomware was deployed to the original activity set. At that time,\nthe intelligence value was underscoring that widely distributed malware such as TrickBot can\nbe a precursor to a ransomware infection, and the remarkable speed with which UNC1878 in\nparticular progressed from initial foothold to lateral movement—important operational and\nstrategic insights for alert prioritization and risk assessment.\n\nBy late October 2020, further research into this activity set uncovered additional malware\nfamilies and infrastructure as well as a much more robust understanding of the group’s most\ncommon tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including how these have both evolved\nover time. We were also able to identify targeting victimology patterns that allowed us to\nissue a warning: despite a global pandemic, UNC1878 is actively targeting healthcare\nfacilities with ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: UNC1878 in Mandiant Advantage\n\n_UNC1945_\n\n[UNC1945 represents a case in which we have not yet determined the goal of the attacker, nor](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/11/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945.html)\ninformation about its potential origin, but the tactics of this activity cluster are significant\nenough that it is worth calling attention to it. For example, Mandiant discovered UNC1945\nexploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module\n(PAM), [CVE-2020-14871. We reported the vulnerability to the vendor, who recently released](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/11/critical-buffer-overflow-vulnerability-in-solaris-can-allow-remote-takeover.html)\na patch. We observed this actor exploit various operating systems and demonstrate access to\nresources and numerous toolsets as well as traverse multiple third-party networks,\nsuggesting a sophisticated and persistent adversary. We noted that UNC1945 appeared to be\ntargeting specific financial and consulting organizations via third party compromise.\n\nThese assessments allow clients to gauge potential strategic risk to their organization based\non observed targeting patterns, review tactical strategies for countering third party\ncompromise vectors, as well as download indicators and signatures to take operational\ndefensive steps against this threat.\n\nFigure 3: UNC1945 actor details\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUNC groups support Mandiant incident responders, researchers, and analysts to track\nmalicious activity and turn observations into action to empower defenders. They also\nrepresent one way in which Mandiant Advantage is equipping clients to use source materials\nand raw analysis to improve tradecraft, and hopefully, defensive outcomes in their own\nenvironments. Moreover, UNC groups empower users to track activity sets that will become\nAPT and FIN groups before they 'graduate' into fully defined threat groups and are\nannounced publicly—in some cases, years before.\n\n\n-----",
