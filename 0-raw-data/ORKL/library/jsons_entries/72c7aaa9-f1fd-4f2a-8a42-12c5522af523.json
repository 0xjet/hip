    "plain_text": "# A Spectrum of State Ransomware Responsibility\n\n**[pylos.co/2021/09/09/a-spectrum-of-state-ransomware-responsibility/](https://pylos.co/2021/09/09/a-spectrum-of-state-ransomware-responsibility/)**\n\nJoe 09/09/2021\n\nQuestions concerning responsibility for the current epidemic of ransomware events are\ncommon, and seek to identify some concrete party to hold accountable for incidents. Yet the\nimmediate perpetrators – largely (but not exclusively) criminal gangs operating in Eastern\nEurope and Russia – either represent too remote an entity for blame, or remain inaccessible\nfrom any consequences for their behavior. The latter point is interesting, and gives rise to\ntheories that state entities, especially Russian authorities, overlook the operations of these\ngroups to further their own notionally disruptive ends.\n\nAs [previously discussed, ransomware operations contain at least as many, if not more, risks](https://pylos.co/2021/09/04/ransomwares-unintended-consequences/)\nfor state entities as benefits. Yet we should not assume all authorities employ accurate or\nespecially deep risk calculations. Therefore, irrespective of actual benefit, we are faced with\nthe interface between criminal entities and state authorities. That state entities are involved\nin ransomware operations is beyond doubt – such has been strongly suggested if not proven\n[in cases like ColdLock,](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/05/17/2003736564) [more recent Exchange exploitation, and the](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/) [WannaCry event, and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and)\n\n\n-----\n\n[reasonably considered in cases such as the LockerGoga incident at Norsk Hydro. Yet the](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/Spyware-Stealer-Locker-Wiper-LockerGoga-Revisited.pdf)\nquestion of state control or responsibility for such operations when conducted by criminals in\npermissive environments is more vexing.\n\nRecent, [in-depth reporting from Recorded Future implies that links between Russian criminal](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf)\nentities and state authorities are rather robust and derive from long-standing links between\nstate intelligence services and criminal actors. The report is quite thorough in gathering and\nevaluating evidence, but conclusions bear further scrutiny. Notably, a significant tension\nexists between instances where members of the Russian criminal ecosystem were very\ndirectly co-opted by state entities, and looser relationships where the existence of such\nentities is merely permitted for one of a number of reasons. While the effects of such activity\nmay be the same, the reasons behind such actions are drastically different, and should be\ntaken into account when evaluating the degree of state culpability in ransomware operations.\n\nAt this time, we should familiarize ourselves with a concept long known but seldom\n[recognized in cyber operations and intelligence analysis: the spectrum of state responsibility](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/022212_ACUS_NatlResponsibilityCyber.PDF)\nfor cyber incidents. Originally distilled by Jason Healey and since refined or expounded on by\nothers, the idea posits that state association with cyber events is not a binary proposition.\nInstead, there exist many degrees of state involvement in cyber-nexus events:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs seen in the list above, responsibility ranges from willingness (but inability) to block or\ninterrupt cyber events emerging from their territory to benign neglect to active\nencouragement to direct involvement in operations. While the above represents merely a\nmodel of activity, it remains instructive by showing analysts and others that many gradations\nexist defining state interaction with cyber events.\n\nIn some cases – potentially most notable with lack of action by Nigerian authorities against\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) entities operating in their country – states may lack the\ninstitutional ability to effectively respond (without significant external assistance) to malicious\nactivity originating from their territory. In others, presumably criminal operations may be\n[subsumed within or represent extensions of state-directed operations. Yet neither case](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nappears to apply to Russian-nexus cybercrime operations. While the Russian state may\n[have persistent issues dealing with criminality, the country remains a vaguely authoritarian](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Russia/Content/Detail/Report/4457fa79-bf89-4098-8416-189c5f8863d4)\nsociety with democratic trappings – meaning if ransomware gangs were a point of particular\n\n\n-----\n\ninterest, they could (and likely would) be efficiently dealt with by authorities. At the other\nextreme, a state able to execute such exquisite intrusions and reasonably deniable events\n[ranging from SUNBURST to](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) [NotPetya would appear to have little use for indiscriminate](https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/new-ransomware-epidemics/11710/)\nransomware operations as a tool of state policy given other available options.\n\nBased on the above, any assessment of Russian government culpability for ransomware\noperations must first determine, just what level of action (or inaction) establishes\nresponsibility? If the measure of responsibility hinges on negative observations (i.e., neglect\nor avoidance), then we must also determine whether such actions are out of deliberate\nignorance or more general institutional failure. If we posit that the Russian state is in firm\ncontrol of its society, then ransomware operators functioning without sanction would appear\nto be a very deliberate choice by the Russian state. However, Russia sadly appears to be a\n[polity afflicted by corruption, state and institutional capture, and collisions between ruling](http://f3magazine.unicri.it/?p=402)\nauthority and popular interests. In such an environment, legal sanction for entities operating\nalmost exclusively outside the territory of the state would appear to be either a low priority –\nor one of a number of opportunities for enrichment through bribes and other mechanisms.\n\nFrom the above, we must ask, given the diseased institutional state of the Russian\nFederation, whether the entity even has the capacity to reign in ransomware operators.\nWhile collaborations between intelligence entities and criminal elements may continue to\ntake place for various opportunistic reasons, wholesale disruption and shutdown of entities\nprimarily impacting non-Russian entities would appear a low priority for authorities within the\ncompromised state. Looking back to our spectrum of state responsibility, while Russian\nauthorities appear to aspire to and occasionally reach higher levels of interaction with\nrespect to their criminal underground, more often than not institutional failures and limitations\nmean such criminal activities take place irrespective of state agreement or disapproval.\n\nThus imaging a grand conspiracy of Russian-directed ransomware operations against EU\nand North American entities as a sort of covert disruptive exercise appears nonsensical. At\nbest, Russian authorities retain weak (if any) authority over such groups, exercised only in\nthose rare occasions when a truly critical (e.g. domestic) interest is threatened. At worst, the\nRussian cybercrime scene resembles a Hobbesian war of all against all, so long as effects\nare not significantly felt domestically, a nearly failed state can do little but watch idly while\npursuing more immediate existential threats.\n\nWe may find it intellectually comforting to think that some grand conspiracy lies behind the\ndisruptive events that impact entities ranging from hospitals to school districts to everyday\ncommerce. Yet the totality of available evidence and understanding of circumstances\noverwhelmingly suggests a significant distance between Russian state authority designs and\nthe predations of Russian-based criminal enterprises. Searching for a singular, allencompassing “bad guy” to blame for events is a common feature of the human condition.\nBut in the case of ransomware operations, events are too diffuse and complex to support\nsuch attribution.\n\n\n-----",
