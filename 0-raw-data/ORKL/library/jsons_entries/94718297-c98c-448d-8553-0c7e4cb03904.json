This blog post describes another](https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/)\n\n[attack campaign where attackers used the Uri terror attack and Kashmir protest themed spear phishing emails to target o�cials in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Uri_attack)\n\nthe Indian Embassies and Indian Ministry of External A�airs (MEA). In order to infect the victims, the attackers distributed spear\nphishing emails containing malicious word document which dropped a malware capable of spying on infected systems. The email\n\npurported to have been sent from legitimate email ids. The attackers spoofed the email ids associated with Indian Ministry of Home\n\nA�airs to send out email to the victims. Attackers also used the name of the top-ranking o�cial associated with Minister of Home\n\na�airs in the signature of the email, this is to make it look like the email was sent by a high-ranking Government o�cial associated\n\nwith Ministry of Home A�airs (MHA).\n\n**Overview of the Malicious Emails**\n\nIn the The �rst wave of attack, The attackers spoofed an email id that is associated with Indian Ministry of Home A�airs (MHA) and\n\nan email was sent on September 20th, 2016 (just 2 days after the Uri terror attack) to an email id associated with the Indian Embassy\n\nin Japan. The email was made to look like as if an investigation report related to Uri terror attack was shared by the MHA o�cial. This\n\nemail contained a malicious word document (Uri Terror Report.doc) as shown in the below screen shot\n\nOn Sept 20th,2016 similar Uri Terror report themed email was also sent to an email id connected with Indian embassy in Thailand.\n\nThis email was later forwarded on Oct 24th,2016 from a spoofed email id which is associated with Thailand Indian embassy to\n\nvarious email recipients connected to the Indian Ministry of External A�airs as shown in the below screen shot. This email also\n\ncontained the same malicious word document (Uri Terror Report.doc)\n\n[In the second wave of attack slightly di�erent theme was used, this time attackers used the Jammnu & Kashmir protest theme to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Kashmir_unrest)\n\ntarget the victims. In this case Attackers again spoofed an email id associated with Indian Ministry of Home A�airs and the mail was\n\nsent on September 1,2016 to an email id associated Thailand Indian embassy, this email was later forwarded on Oct 24th,2016 from\n\na spoofed email of Thailand Indian embassy to various email recipients connected to the Indian Ministry of External A�airs (MEA).\n\nThis time the email was made to look like an investigation report related to Jammu & Kashmir protest was shared by the Ministry of\n\nHome A�airs O�cial and the forwarded email was made to look like the report was forwarded by an Ambassador in Thailand Indian\n\nembassy to the MEA o�cials. This email contained a di�erent malicious word document (mha-report.doc) as shown in the below\n\nscreen shot.\n\n\n-----\n\nspy on the actions of the Indian Government post the Jammu & Kashmir protest and Uri Terror attack.\n\n\n**Analysis of Malicious Word Documents**\n\nWhen the victim opens the attached word document it prompts the user to enable macro content and both the documents (Uri\n\nTerror Report.doc and mha-report.doc) displayed the same content and contained a Show Document button as shown below\n\nIn case of both the documents (Uri Terror Report.doc and mha-report.doc) the malicious macro code was heavily obfuscated(used\n\nobscure variable/function names to make analysis harder) and did not contain any auto execute functions . Malicious activity is\n\ntrigged only on user interaction, attackers normally use this technique to bypass sandbox/automated analysis. Reverse engineering\n\nboth the word documents (Uri Terror Report.doc & mha-report.doc) exhibited similar behaviour except the minor di�erence\n\nmentioned below.\n\nIn case of mha-report.doc the malicious activity triggered only when the show document button was clicked, when this event occurs\n\nthe macro code calls a subroutine CommandButton1_Click() which in turn calls a malicious obfuscated function (Bulbaknopka()) as\n\nshown in the below screen shot.\n\nIn case of Uri Terror Report.doc the malicious activity triggered when the document was either closed or when the show document\n\nbutton was clicked, when any of these event occurs a malicious obfuscated function (chugnnarabashkoim()) gets called as shown\n\nbelow.\n\nThe malicious macro code �rst decodes a string which contains a reference to the pastebin url. The macro then decodes a\n\nPowerShell script which downloads base64 encoded content from the pastebin url.\n\nBelow screen shot shows the network tra�c generated as a result of macro code executing the PowerShell script.\n\nBelow screen shot shows the malicious base64 encoded content hosted on that pastebin link.\n\nThe base64 encoded content downloaded from the Pastebin link is then decoded to an executable and dropped on the system. The\n\ntechnique of hosting malicious code in legitimate sites like Pastebin has advantages and it is highly unlikely to trigger any suspicion\n\nin security monitoring and also can bypass reputation based devices. Below screen shot shows the �le (o�ceupdate.exe) decoded\n\nand dropped on the system.\n\nThe dropped �le was determined as modi�ed version of njRAT trojan. The dropped �le (o�ceupdate.exe) is then executed by the\n\nmacro code using the PowerShell script.\n\nnjRAT is a Remote Access Tool (RAT) used mostly by the actor groups in the middle east. Once infected njRAT communicates to the\n\nattacker and allows the attacker to log keystrokes, upload/download �les, access victims web camera, audio recording, steal\n\ncredentials, view victims desktop, open reverse shell etc. The njRAT attacker control panel and the features in the attacker control\n\npanel is shown in the below screen shot.\n\n**Analysis of the Dropped Executable (o�ceupdate.exe)**\n\nThe dropped �le was analyzed in an isolated environment (without actually allowing it to connect to the c2 server). This section\n\ncontains the behavioral analysis of the dropped executable\n\n\n-----\n\ninto the %AllUsersPro�le%\\Google directory and then executes the dropped googleupdate.exe\n\n\nThe malware then communicates with the C2 server (khanji[.]ddns[.]net) on port 5555\n\n**C2 Communication Pattern**\n\nUpon execution malware makes a connection to the c2 server on port 5555 and sends the system & operating system information\n\nalong with some base64 encoded strings to the attacker as shown below.\n\nBelow is the description of the strings passed in the C2 communication\n\n**WIN-T9UN4HIIHEC -> is the hostname of the infected system**\n\n**Administrator -> is the username**\n\n**16-12-04 -> is the infection date**\n\n**No -> Indicates that the system has no camera**\n\nThe below screen shot shows the base64 decoded strings associated with the C2 communication\n\nBelow is the description of the decoded strings\n\n**1302_E63C5C8F -> is the botID_volume-serial-number**\n\n**Process Hacker [WIN-T9UN4HIIHEC\\Administrator]+ -> Reports open window, In my case I was using a tool called Process**\n\n**Hacker, The information on the open window lets the attacker know what tools are running on the system or if analysis**\n\n**tools are used to inspect the malware.**\n\n**C2 Domain Information**\n\nThis section contains the details of the C2 domain (khanji[.]ddns[.]net). Attackers used the DynamicDNS to host the C2 server, this\n\nallows the attacker to quickly change the IP address in real time if the malware C2 server infrastructure is unavailable. The C2\n\ndomain was associated with multiple IP addresses in past as shown below\n\nDuring the timeline of this cyber attack most of these IP addresses were located in Pakistan and few IP addresses used the hosting\n\nprovider infrastructure as shown in the screen shot below\n\nBelow screenshot shows the timeline when these IP addresses were active.\n\nThe C2 domain (khanji[.]ddns[.]net) was also found to be associated with multiple malware samples in the past, Some of these\n\nmalware samples made connection to pastebin urls upon execution, which is similar to the behavior mentioned previously.\n\n**Threat Intelligence**\n\nBased on the base64 encoded content posted in the Pastebin, userid associated with the Pastebin post was determined. The same\n\nuser posted multiple similar posts most of them containing similar base64 encoded content (probably used by the malwares in other\n\ncampaigns to decode and drop malware executable), these posts were made between July 21st, 2016 to September 30, 2016. Below\n\nscreen shot shows the posts made by the user, the hits column in the below screen shot gives an idea of number of times the links\n\nwere visited (probably by the malicious macro code), this can give rough idea of the number of users who are probably infected as a\n\n\n-----\n\np g y p,\n\n\nDoing a Google search for the Pastebin userid landed me on a YouTube video posted by an individual demonstrating his modi�ed\n\nversion of njRAT control panel/builder kit. The Pastebin userid matched with the Email ID mentioned by this individual in the\n\nYouTube video description section as shown below.\n\nThis individual also used a speci�c keyword in his Skype id, Twitter id, and the YouTube username. This same keyword was also\n\nfound in the njRAT C2 communication used in this attack as shown below.\n\nAfter inspecting the njRAT builder kit it was determined that this individual customized the existing njRAT builder kit to bypass\n\nsecurity products. The product information in the builder kit matched with this individual’s YouTube username and the YouTube\n\nchannel. The njRAT used in this cyber attack was built from this builder kit.\n\nBased on this information it can be concluded that espionage actors used this individual’s modi�ed version of njRAT in this cyber\n\nattack.\n\nEven though this individual’s email id matched with the Pastebin id where base64 encoded malicious code was found, it is hard to\n\nsay if this individual was or was not involved in this cyber attack. It could be possible that the espionage actors used his public\n\nidentity as a diversion to mislead and to hide the real identity of the attackers or it is also possible that this individual was hired to\n\ncarry out the attack.\n\n**Indicators Of Compromise**\n\nThe indicators are provided below, these indicators can be used by the organizations (Government, Public and Private organizations)\n\nto detect and investigate this attack campaign.\n\n**Dropped Malware Samples:**\n\n14b9d54f07f3facf1240c5ba89aa2410 (googleupdate.exe)\n\n2b0bd7e43c1f98f9db804011a54c11d6 (malib.dll)\n\nfeec4b571756e8c015c884cb5441166b (msccvs.dll)\n\n84d9d0524e14d9ab5f88bbce6d2d2582 (o�ceupdate.exe)\n\n**Network Indicators Associated with C2:**\n\nkhanji[.]ddns[.]net\n\n139[.]190[.]6[.]180\n\n39[.]40[.]141[.]25\n\n175[.]110[.]165[.]110\n\n39[.]40[.]44[.]245\n\n39[.]40[.]67[.]219\n\n119[.]160[.]68[.]178\n\n175[.]107[.]13[.]215\n\n39[.]47[.]125[.]110\n\n175[.]107[.]5[.]247\n\n175[.]107[.]6[.]174\n\n182[.]191[.]90[.]91\n\n175[.]107[.]7[.]50\n\n182[.]191[.]90[.]92\n\n175[.]107[.]7[.]69\n\n\n-----\n\n155[.]254[.]225[.]24\n\n\n155[.]254[.]225[.]24\n\n\n203[.]31[.]216[.]214\n\n45[.]42[.]243[.]20\n\n**Pastebin URL’s Hosting Malicious Payload:**\n\nhxxp://pastebin.com/raw/5j4hc8gT\n\nhxxp://pastebin.com/raw/6bwniBtB\n\n**Related Malware Samples associated with C2 (khanji[.]ddns[.]net):**\n\n028caf3b1f5174ae092ecf435c1fccc2\n\n7732d5349a0cfa1c3e4bcfa0c06949e4\n\n9909f8558209449348a817f297429a48\n\n63698ddbd�5be7d5a7ba7f31d0d592c\n\n7c4e60685203b229a41ae65eba1a0e10\n\ne2112439121f8ba9164668f54ca1c6af\n\n784b6e13f195236304e1c172dcdab51f\n\nb0f0350a5c2480d8419d14ec3445b765\n\n9a51db9889d4fd6d02bdb35bd13fb07e\n\n8199667bad5559ee8f04fd6b1a587a75\n\n7ad6aaa107a7616a3dbe8e3babf5d310\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAttackers in this case made every attempt to launch a clever attack campaign by spoo�ng legitimate email ids and using an email\n\ntheme relevant to the targets. The following factors in this cyber attack suggests the possible involvement of Pakistan state\n\nsponsored cyber espionage group to mainly spy on India’s actions related to these Geo-political events (Uri terror attack and Jammu\n\n& Kashmir protests).\n\nVictims/targets chosen (Indian Embassy and Indian MEA o�cals)\n\nUse of Email theme related to the Geo-political events that is of interest to the targets\n\nTiming of the spear phishing emails sent to the victims\n\nLocation of the C2 infrastructure\n\nUse of malware that is capable of spying on infected systems\n\nThe following factors show the level of sophistication and reveals the attackers intention to remain stealthy and to gain long-term\n\naccess by evading anti-virus, sandbox and security monitoring at both the desktop and network levels.\n\nUse of obfuscated malicious macro code\n\nUse of macro code that triggers only on user intervention (to bypass sandbox analysis)\n\nUse of legitimate site (Pastebin) to host malicious code (to bypass security monitoring)\n\nUse of customized njRAT (capable of evading anti-virus)\n\nUse of Dynamic DNS to host C2 infrastructure\n\n[I would like to thank Brian Rogalski who after reading my previous blog post shared a malicious document which he thought was](https://twitter.com/br0g_RE)\n\n[similar to the document mentioned in my previous blog.
