When Korean\nmalware researchers first heard about the attack, they recalled\nthe attacks against Korean banks and media companies between\n2011 and 2013, but they didn’t anticipate a connection with this\nattack. When more information on the malware was released, it\ncame as quite a surprise to find that it contained similar code to\nmalware that had already been found in Korea.\n\nThe Lazarus Group, which includes Red Dot and Labyrinth\nChollima, became well known to the press and the security\ncommunity outside of Korea because of the Sony Pictures hack.\nMalicious code that is similar to the code used in the Sony\n_Pictures hack is still being used in targeted attacks on Korean_\ncompanies and institutions. In 2015, a zero-day exploit targeted\nthe participants of the Seoul ADEX 2015 conference using a\n_Hangul vulnerability, and in 2016, a Windows zero-day_\nvulnerability was used to hack various ICT companies and\nweb-hosting providers. The group is also suspected of attacking\na cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn this paper, I will describe various attacks in Korea which\noccurred after the Sony incident and are suspected to be the\nwork of the Lazarus Group. I will also analyse and discuss the\nchanges seen in the malware code.\n\n#### OVERVIEW\n\nIn November 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment was the target\nof a cyber attack that resulted in the destruction of its system\ndata and the release of internal emails and upcoming movies.\nWhen detailed information about the incident was revealed,\nmalware analysts in South Korea discovered a strong correlation\nbetween this malware and the malware that had been used in\nrecent cyber attacks in South Korea. It was later announced by\nthe US government that the group behind the Sony attack was\nlinked to the Lazarus Group, which is mainly active in\nSouth Korea.\n\nThe governmental institutions of Korea have been under\ncontinuous cyber attack from unidentified attackers since 2007.\nThere is a connection between these attackers and the group\nbehind the attack on Sony Pictures. Lazarus Group, otherwise\nknown as Hidden Cobra, is also known to have been behind the\nhacking of the Bangladesh Central Bank in 2016 [1] and a series\nof hacking incidents targeting cryptocurrencies and casinos in\n2017. Meanwhile, the Bluenoroff group, a subgroup of the\nLazarus Group, is more focused on attacking financial\ninstitutions and cryptocurrency exchanges. Another subgroup,\n\n\nAndariel, is active only in South Korea and seeks to perform\nvarious attacks that focus on stealing confidential data from the\nmilitary and defence industries. Andariel was responsible for\ncausing server errors in the 3.20 (DarkSeoul) attack on 20\nMarch 2013, and since the second half of 2016 it has been more\nfocused on attacking the financial industry. The activities of the\nLazarus Group have been reported not only in Korea but in a\nnumber of countries [2, 3].\n\nThis report provides insights into the malware used in the Sony\n_Pictures hacking incident and the changes seen in the malware_\nused in attacks in Korea before and after the incident. Note that\nthis report is based on the publicly released information and not\non the results of an AhnLab investigation. As the group has a long\nhistory of attacks and malware, the report focuses specifically on\nthe activities of Lazarus in relation to the Sony Pictures hack.\n\n#### SONY PICTURES HACK\n\nOn 24 November 2014, Sony Pictures was attacked by a hacker\ngroup which identified itself as the Guardians of Peace (GOP).\nThe attack destroyed internal system data and leaked a slew of\nconfidential data including internal emails and yet to be released\nfilms. Sony Pictures was in the process of making a film that\ndepicts the assassination of Kim Jong-eun, so the possibility of\nthe attack having a link to North Korea was speculated from\nearly on [4]. Moreover, shortly afterwards, a British TV\ncompany that was engaged in making a drama about a British\nnuclear scientist on a covert mission to North Korea was hacked\nby North Korea and production of the drama was cancelled [5].\nThe US government released their findings on the malware used\nin the Sony hack in December 2014 through the FBI and\nUS-CERT [6]. In February 2016, Novetta published the\n‘Operation Blockbuster’ [7] report and, in May 2016, Blue Coat\npublished a report entitled ‘From Seoul To Sony’ [8] on their\nfindings. The findings show that the attack methods of the\nmalware used in the Sony Pictures hack were similar to those\nused by the Lazarus Group, so it is beyond speculation that\nNorth Korea was behind the attack.\n\n#### Characteristics of malware\n\nThe released results contained information on the backdoors,\nknown as Escad, used in the attack.\n\n**SHA256** **MD5**\n```\neff542ac8e37db48821cb4e5a7d9 6467c6df4ba4526c7f7a7bc950b\n5c044fff27557763de3a891b40eb d47eb\neb52cc55\n4c2efe2f1253b94f16a1cab032f e904bf93403c0fb08b9683a9e85\n36c7883e4f6c8d9fc17d0ee553b 8c73e\n5afb16330c\n\n```\nThe backdoors have the following features in common:\n\n - The IP address of the C&C server is not obfuscated (see\nFigure 1).\n\n - The loaded DLL file strings are encrypted using the XOR\n0xA7 key and the API has an uncommon cmd.exe method\nwhich includes dots (.) in strings (see Figure 2).\n\n|SHA256|MD5|\n|---|---|\n|eff542ac8e37db48821cb4e5a7d9 5c044fff27557763de3a891b40eb eb52cc55|6467c6df4ba4526c7f7a7bc950b d47eb|\n|4c2efe2f1253b94f16a1cab032f 36c7883e4f6c8d9fc17d0ee553b 5afb16330c|e904bf93403c0fb08b9683a9e85 8c73e|\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 1: IP address of the C&C server._\n\n_Figure 2: Specific strings of the backdoor known as Escad._\n\n- The backdoor initialization code sets up the C&C server IP `:L1`\naddress to access the server. It then receives commands `del \"C:\\work\\RP0.exe\"`\nfrom the server to carry out its backdoor functions. `if exist \"_RP0.exe\" goto L1`\n\n\n\n - The backdoors also include fake code for SSL that appear\nto make legitimate SSL communications.\n\n#### OPERATION MYSTERY DOT (2011–2014)\n\nSo, when was the first appearance of this malware? AhnLab found\nsimilar malware being used in attacks as early as April 2011. This\nmalware not only includes dots in the API address like the\nbackdoors used in the Sony attack, but some variants even use the\nsame key value (0xA7) for decryption.\n\n#### Dropper (2011)\n\n**SHA256** **MD5**\n```\n 37be47f8df3c94d365d693855d1 49ace8a624dd22f3110f041\n af5ac8b94eedd1b3b3122586a6d a324d1646\n 48611230bb\n 8c2b014f0ad27a3a325f15c916c d306065bab5b742f669bb1e\n dc9f5963ad4276e9fc928817387 fcebaed3a\n c0e5dc62bd\n\n```\nThe droppers discovered in April 2011 include dots and perform\nXOR encryption with the 0xA7 key, identical to the malware\nused in the Sony Pictures hack, to decrypt passwords. These\ndroppers have the unique characteristic of the string ‘BMZA’;\ntext strings containing ‘BM’ are also found in other malware\nfrom the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe self-delete batch file is the same as that of the Redobot\nbackdoor:\n\n\n#### Redobot (KorDllbot)\n\nRedobot is a backdoor that was known to be in the wild between\nApril 2011 and April 2014. This backdoor is in a DLL file\nformat, uses API addresses that are obfuscated with dots, and\ncontains unique text strings such as ‘%sd.e%sc %s 2>%s’ and\n‘%sd.e%sc %s > %s 2>&1’, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nSome malware samples use dots as well as dashes (-) and angle\nbrackets (<) for API obfuscation. But there are also variations\nwithout any obfuscation (b7f2595dd62d1174ce6e5ddf43bf2b42\nf7001c7a4ec3c4cbe3359e30c674ed83_0092f2d519739f8978cb\n940af0d7cca6).\n\nDroppers that generate these DLL files were also discovered.\n\n|Dropper (2011)|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256|MD5|\n|37be47f8df3c94d365d693855d1 af5ac8b94eedd1b3b3122586a6d 48611230bb|49ace8a624dd22f3110f041 a324d1646|\n|8c2b014f0ad27a3a325f15c916c dc9f5963ad4276e9fc928817387 c0e5dc62bd|d306065bab5b742f669bb1e fcebaed3a|\n\n|SHA256|MD5|\n|---|---|\n|b039383a19e3da74a5a631d fe4e505020a5c5799578187 e4ccc016c22872b246|0fe856d398c877ba0cb7019e98 3b5c84|\n|218ee208323dc38ebc7f63d ba73fac5541b53d7ce185813 1fa3bfd434003091d|cffb5d8fc73d9e7cc5860bd6f31 77b1c|\n|58b7cd75f61f6e8d3f270582 a06808ce7ea77792537a102c 36daf68260b43bfc|d1aaf2f58def16caac1c8d3cb4 6df9f4|\n|11e9adc037b0409d0512504f 348c2ffa064b418651c104f9d dddd8a12448bd06|6e1e06b63fca99fe97e2e341ce c0efa|\n|4ef025dd920c952595b5107b a5eaf89e3caedd2ae8607541 59c746d1c74743ab|65da2d2c6726c05fc863c81a2b 114c2a|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE MONTREAL\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 3.

The code of this variant is very similar to the code\nused in the Sony Pictures hack.\n\nIn September 2015, malware masquerading as a security module\nwas distributed (5831e614d79f3259fd48cfd5cd3c7e8e2c004911\n07d2c7d327970945afcb577d_fa6ee9e969df5ca4524daa77c172a\n1a7).\n\nAt the same time, a zero-day attack began which exploited a\n_Hangul World Processor (HWP) vulnerability (CVE-2015-6585)._\n\nThe South Korean media is often filled with news reports of\nattacks similar to the November 2014 Sony Pictures hack that\nare still active in Korea [10].\n\n\nIn October 2015, malware masquerading as a personal resume\nwas discovered (794b5e8e98e3f0c436515d37212621486f23b\n57a2c945c189594c5bf88821228_1c67fb74d778c3ce15ac4890\n276f892f). The intended target of this attack is likely to be in the\nmilitary as the work experience that was listed on the resume\nwas mainly related to the military and North Korea.\n\nThe attack on the defence industry that took place in the same\nmonth was a spear-phishing attack which impersonated the\nKorean Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences (KSAS).\n\nIn this attack, emails were sent to targeted recipients with\nmalicious attachments. When the recipients opened the\nattachment, which was disguised as an invitation (초청장.hwp),\nit used the HWP vulnerability (CVE-2015-6585) to install a\nbackdoor on the recipient’s computer (c5be570095471bef85028\n2c5aaf9772f5baa23c633fe8612df41f6d1ebe4b565_02b5964f93b\ncd22c4f6cedd64c3b3de3).\n\nIn November 2015, an attack was made on the Seoul\nInternational Aerospace and Defense Exhibition (ADEX)\nparticipants using a malicious email entitled ‘Top 10 Weapons\nExhibited at the Seoul Air Show’. When the recipient opened\nthe disguised attachment (33e99f86d1c94c2798ee1ded42d51382\n4cbd487994691369b1b9b781ebda3947 _660b607e74c41b032a63\ne3af8f32e9f5), malware exploiting the HWP vulnerability was\nexecuted to infect the computer with Escad (ce0e43c2b9cb130\ncd36f1bc5897db2960d310c6e3382e81abfa9a3f2e3b781d7_5df4\n3b35c806c0a47ce379feaf715ee7).\n\nThe National Intelligence Service of Korea later revealed that a\nmember of the National Assembly and their staff had been\ntargeted by an attack which led to the leakage of governmental\naudit materials [11].\n\n#### Changes in malware\n\nRedobot, an early version of Escad, is known to have been in\nthe wild between April 2011 and April 2014. There are many\ndifferences between the early version and the newer variants of\n\n|SHA256|MD5|\n|---|---|\n|b79faac94bde8481aea8ebd 97fb506bdc6964105853b9a9 f8523d7aad699e649|82e195bc7302e8b64aedf48af 889a376|\n|b6d540571b2cb58057631a10 8ecef2bba56251530565f380 044f8359f7abaf40|0a93ccec3824569f7bc55c520 de4fc4f|\n|ecddd99fe084e01213edefb4 dbc1d683d8ad88d832de3427 9615b231bce022b5|ae44cb4b42debf7507313cf a56f1158d|\n\n\n_Figure 4: Comparison of samples used in the South Korea attacks and the Sony Pictures hack._\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n\nthe malware that have been discovered since 2014. In March\n2014, the first variant of the Escad DLL type was discovered. It\ncontinued to be active until March 2015.\n\nThe variants of Escad are mainly classified into types A, B and C.\n\nType A is the malware that was used to attack Sony Pictures and\nwas first discovered in July 2014. It was used in attacks on\npolitical institutions in South Korea until April 2015. The\ncharacteristics of type A are that two IP addresses are set up in\nthe main code, the name of the DLL file uses XOR 0xA7\nencryption, and the string of the logging API is obfuscated with\nspaces and dots (.). Figure 4 shows a comparison of samples\nused in the South Korea attacks and the Sony Pictures hack.\n\nLike type A, type B (which is called Duuzer) sets up two IP\naddresses in the main code, but the format of the code has\nchanged. It does not obfuscate the API address but uses the XOR\ncommand to request the encrypted DLL name and API to use.\n\nType C operates as a service and also sets up two IP addresses\nin the main code, just like types A and B. It uses its own decode\nroutine to extract the DLL name, API and a backdoor command.\nHere, the code for the backdoor is identical to type A.\n\n#### OPERATION BIG POND (2015–2017)\n\nWhen compared with the malware discovered up to 2015, the\nvariants discovered since 2016 show many differences in code\nand use new techniques to get around security programs.\n\nExamples of some of the major attacks are shown in Table 5.\n\nThe threat group behind Operation Big Pond attacked not only\npolitical institutions and defence contractors, but conglomerates,\nshopping malls and ICT companies. KrCERT said that, in 2016,\nthis threat group attacked asset management solution\ndevelopers, hosting companies, academic associations, media,\nlogistics information service providers, etc. It attacked a\nfinancial institution using the vulnerability of network\nseparation software in February 2017, and constantly attacked\ncryptocurrency exchanges throughout 2017.\n\nThe threat group used a zero-day vulnerability in its attack:\n_AhnLab and KrCERT discovered the Open Type Font_\n\n\n(CVE‑2016-7256) vulnerability and reported it to Microsoft in\nautumn 2016 [12]. The attacker had started to make attacks on\nthis vulnerability in the summer of 2015, and these attacks went\nundiscovered for more than a year. According to KrCERT, the\nScript Engine Memory Corruption (CVE-2016-0189)\nvulnerability was also used in the attack.\n\nThe threat group used a few techniques to bypass security\nprograms, such as ‘loading’ (generating malware of tens of\nmegabytes in size and executing a file only within memory,\nwithout dropping it). The group understood that some security\nprograms do not scan or perform behaviour analysis on files of\nhuge sizes and thus increased the size of the malware file and\nexecuted the code only in memory (without creating an\nexecution file) to avoid detection.\n\nIn the case of msnconf.exe (7807568335687dd7f707cadd7a7c8\ne7d79082f15c07d263230ed90bf601bfcc6_250115ddbbc54207\n825855b60049f75f), once the file is executed, a DLL file with\nrandom name is created, empty data is repeatedly added to the\nend of the file, and the size of the file is increased by 67,229,889\nbytes (62439a4a5eb9c6b2c6559928481b3f2bad5c753c297b2f5\n5e2642751a10ca654_ fa73530df2d2cec5e591a9d666fccfa2).\nOnce the DLL file is executed, the encrypted code is unpacked\ninto the memory and executed.\n\nThe malware in the form of a loader was first discovered in\n2015, and was used at full-scale in 2016. There are two types of\nloaders: one that hides the actual malicious code (mainly the\nbackdoor) in the encrypted area inside the malware, such as the\nresource section, and executes in the memory; and one that\nexecutes the malware inside the memory by reading the external\nencrypted file. In the case of an encrypted file, sometimes the\nspecific function of the malware cannot be identified, because\nno encrypted data file is identified. Some loaders are huge in\nlength – sometimes more than 50 megabytes.\n\n#### OPERATION COIN RUSH (2017–2018)\n\nThis threat group has been attacking cryptocurrency exchanges\nand research institutions since 2017. It posed as government\nauthorities and disguised its malware with file names relating to\ntax audit requirements, criminal investigations, etc.\n\n|Date|Target|Method|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Sept 2015|Defence contractor|HWP vulnerability|An attack using an HWP vulnerability.

When there is an EPS in a_\n_Hangul file, the script is automatically executed when the_\ndocument is opened, without any notice to users. The\nvulnerability that uses EPS (CVE-2015-2545) was discovered in\n2015, and the malicious HWP document exploiting this\nvulnerability first appeared in September 2016. The\nvulnerability was still actively exploited as of July 2018. The\nEPS created by this group is noticeably different from the script\ncodes of other threat groups active in Korea.\n\nThe most recently updated version of Hangul by Hancom does\nnot allow the malicious script written in EPS be executed.\nHowever, since no new vulnerability in Hangul by Hancom has\nbeen found, it seems that the attack using this vulnerability will\ncontinue. Thus, it is important for users to apply the most recent\nsecurity update in order to avoid the EPS script attack.\n\n\n#### SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES\n\nAlthough they are somewhat different from the malware codes\nused to attack Sony Pictures, there are other examples of\nmalware related to the Lazarus Group.\n\n#### Navepry\n\nNavepry is known to be one of the pieces of malware created by\nLazarus Group. It was first discovered in 2012, and has been\nseen in large volumes since 2014. This malware mixes the order\nof text strings of API addresses. Figure 5 shows the obfuscated\nstrings.\n\nThis malware contains text strings such as ‘GY’ and ‘FZ’, and\nexecutes the cmd.exe file in a unique way. Figure 6 shows the\nunique text string of Navepry.\n\nThis malware was used to attack political institutions, defence\ncontractors and large Korean companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 5: Obfuscated strings._\n\n_Figure 6: Unique text string of Navepry._\n\n_Figure 7: Compare obfuscation codes of Navepry._\n\n**Date** **Target** **Method** **Description**\n\nMarch 2015 ?

The malware seems to be being used by the\nsame group, because the attacker sometimes used the Open\nType Font vulnerability.\n\n#### LAZARUS CONNECTIONS\n\nThe Lazarus Group can largely be divided into two separate\ngroups: the one that focused on attacking the Korean military in\n2008 and another that emerged via the 7.7 DDoS attack (Dozer)\nin 2009. Many reports on the Lazarus Group do not distinguish\nthe two from one another. The exact number of individuals\ninvolved with the Lazarus Group is unknown, however, their\nnew and variant attack method, which was used in the attack on\nthe Seoul ADEX 2015 conference, suggests that they may now\nhave more than two groups operating independently.\n\nInitially, there was a clear connection between the two groups.\nRedobot dropper (37be47f8df3c94d365d693855d1af5ac8b94ee\ndd1b3b3122586a6d48611230bb_49ace8a624dd22f3110f041a3\n24d1646), discovered in 2011, contains a ‘BMZA’ text string.\n\nThe ‘BM’ text string was used in a malware attack on targets in\nthe defence field in 2009 and ‘BM6W’ was also used in the 6.25\nCyber Terror(KorHigh) that took place on 25 June 2013. ‘BM’\nis also used by Bmdoor, malware that was used in Operation\nBlack Mine in 2014. The exact meaning of BM has not yet been\nidentified. However, it is constantly included in the malware as\nif it is some form of signature used by its creators.\n\nThe malware used in the Sony Pictures hack also includes a\nunique cmd.exe command, which similarly remains a mystery.\n\n#### CONCLUSION\n\nThis threat group used various infiltration methods, such as\nspear phishing, watering hole attacks, webshell uploads, etc. to\ntake over the computing networks of political institutions,\ndefence contractors and large companies in 2014; defence\ncontractors and major companies in 2015; and hosting\ncompanies and media companies in 2016. Since 2017 the\nattacks have been concentrated onto cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThis threat group used zero-day vulnerabilities such as the\nVBScript vulnerability (CVE-2016-0189) and Open Type Font\nvulnerability (CVE-2016-7256) and attempts to bypass security\nprograms using a loader that has a huge file size and by\nexecuting only in memory.\n\nPieces of malware that are similar to that used to hack into Sony\n_Pictures are still being discovered. Now, this threat group is_\nattacking targets not only in Korea, but also in other parts of the\nworld. Many researchers are tracing and analysing this group.\nHowever, the malware used to hack Sony Pictures became so\nfamous, that it would be easy for anyone to imitate it. When\nstudying the relationship (of attacks) one must be fully aware of\nthis fact.\n\n\nSecurity experts around the world must work together to trace\nand study this threat group, which is active in all corners of the\nworld.\n\n#### REFERENCES\n\n[1] Sayer, P.
