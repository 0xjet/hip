The\ncampaign sends invoices from a fake flower shop in hopes that potential victims will manually\nfind the fake flower shop website and download the BazarLoader malware.\n\nIn order to lure the victims into providing manual assistance the campaign setup a fully\nfunctional flower shop website and can thus evade automated detection schemes looking for\nmalicious content, as the malicious download will be manually downloaded by the victim\nfollowing several manual steps of the social engineering trap.\n\n## Background\n\nBazarLoader1 is a malware loader attributed to a threat actor with a close relation to the\nTrickBot malware. The threat actor is tracked under the name Team9 (Cybereason) or\nUNC1878 (FireEye).\n\n\n-----\n\nBazarLoader is also aptly named KEGTAP by FireEye, as in a device used to open a beer\nkeg, because it is used to “open” the network of victims for follow up malware in order to\nmove laterally on the network and eventually deploy the Ryuk ransomware.2\n\nWe have previously reported on a BazarLoader campaign using an employment termination\nsocial engineering lure to spread its malware.3\n\nThe observed campaign started on 2021-01-21 and is ongoing.\n\nIt uses various subjects referring to an invoice from the Rose World flower shop. Spoiler: The\nflower shop isn’t real. The attached invoice is an elaborate social engineering scam to trick\nvictims into downloaded the BazarLoader malware.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe following analysis outlines each step of BazarLoader’s new elaborate social engineering\ncampaign.\n\n### Email\n\nThe attack starts with an email.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email pretends to be an invoice from the Rose World online store, an online flower shop.\n\n### PDF\n\nAttached to the email is a PDF invoice.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PDF has no clickable links. It however features a domain name under the address of the\nsupposed invoicing party.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Fake Flower Shop\n\nWhen the recipient visits this domain a webshop for flowers is presented.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven though this is a fake shop it features\n\nan about page\n\n\n-----\n\na blog\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the checkout fails because allegedly there are no available payment methods.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe checkout is the only thing not working on the fake shop. Thus it is very hard to identify\nthis as a malicious website.\n\n### The Lure\n\nBecause the shop looks legit a recipient will likely try to contact the shop owner to clear up\nthe invoice they falsely received. To do so, they visit the contact us section of the fake shop.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is one last indicator that something is not quite right. The Google Maps frame is in\nRussian language, while the rest of the webshop pretends to be from the United States of\nAmerica. However, a victim will likely continue to the convenient order number entry field.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the victim enters the order number – in fact any input will suffice – they are redirected\nvia a loading screen.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe loading page is also fake, the content is already loaded under the loading page overlay.\n\nNext, the victim is presented instructions on how to download and execute the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt includes instructions to bypass the malicious file download warning on Google Chrome.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt even includes instructions to bypass Windows security features preventing the file from\nbeing executed because it was downloaded from the Internet.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “Request Form” link will download a malicious document from\n```\nhxxps[:]//rosedelivery[.]us/ .\n\n### Malicious Document\n\n```\nThe malicious document pretends to be protected by DocuSign and macros need to be\nallowed to decrypt it.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe XLM macro code will download the BazarLoader executable from\n```\nhxxps[:]//www.smowengroup[.]com/fer/iertef.php and execute it.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe BazarLoader uses the decentralized Emerald DNS system based on the Emercoin\nblockchain to establish its C2 communication. It will download and install the\nBazarBackdoor .1 This backdoor will be used to move laterally in the victim’s network in order\nto take over the domain controller. Eventually the intrusion is monetized by deploying the\nRyuk2 ransomware.\n\n### Targeting\n\nThe campaign is targeted towards US companies. We conclude this from the email, PDF,\nfake webshop, but also from the recipients, which are US companies and/or international\ncompanies with a US presence.\n\n## Conclusion and Countermeasures\n\nThe new BazarLoader campaign does not feature malicious indicators in its emails, such as\nmacro documents or clickable URLs. It rather relies on an elaborate social engineering lure\nto lead the victim towards finding and downloading the malware themselves rather then\ndirectly handing it over. The amount of manual work required by victims makes this campaign\ndifficult to detect via automated measures. This is why Hornetsecurity is closely tracking\nmalspam operations by threat actors to quickly engage newly emerging threats. Hence\nHornetsecurity is already aware of this new elaborate social engineering scheme to distribute\nthe BazarBackdoor and Hornetsecurity’s [Spam Filtering and Malware Protection, already](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\nquarantines the new BazarLoader emails.\n\n## References\n\n Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Email\n\n**Subjects**\n\n```\nCongratulations on the latest purchase you have made!Your order number\n\n```\n```\nis KCD[0-9]{8}G.\n\n```\n```\nCongratulations on your purchase from our store!
