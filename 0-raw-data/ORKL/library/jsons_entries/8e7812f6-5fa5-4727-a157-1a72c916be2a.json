Gemini assesses\nwith a high level of confidence that these vendors are very likely to fully transition to\nother large, top-tier dark web marketplaces.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe underground payment card economy is likely to remain largely unaffected by this\nshutdown.\n\n## Background\n\nJoker’s Stash, the largest dark web marketplace in the underground payment card economy,\nhas announced that it is shutting down. The announcement, posted on January 15, 2021,\nclaimed that it would remain operational until February 15, 2021, before the administrator,\n“JokerStash,” “goes on a well-deserved retirement.” This message was originally posted to\nJoker’s Stash itself, and additionally added to several top-tier dark web forums.\n\nImage 1: JokerStash announces the closure of the Joker’s Stash marketplace.\n\n## In-Depth Analysis\n\n**Reactions**\n\n\n-----\n\nFeedback was mixed; some dark web forum members expressed disappointment to lose\naccess to the marketplace, while others who had been frustrated with its operations were\nneutral. Certain actors accepted JokerStash’s explanation for retirement, while others on\ndark web forums and hacking-focused Telegram channels speculated that the FBI had\ndetained JokerStash. Several weeks ago, Joker’s Stash blockchain domains were\n[temporarily rendered unavailable and replaced with an FBI and Interpol seizure notice.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-interpol-disrupt-jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-marketplace/)\nHowever, the administrator quickly regained control.\n\nImage 2: An FBI and Interpol seizure notice appeared on a Joker’s Stash blockchain domain\non December 16, 2020.\n\nIn late October, the marketplace’s routine activities were disrupted. JokerStash posted to\nclaim that this was due to getting COVID-19 and spending more than one week in a hospital.\n\nImage 3: JokerStash claims to have been hospitalized due to COVID-19.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother event that may have contributed to this threat actor shutting down their marketplace\nis Bitcoin’s recent spike. JokerStash was an early advocate of Bitcoin and claims to keep all\nproceeds in this cryptocurrency. This actor was already likely to be among the wealthiest\ncybercriminals, and the spike may have multiplied their fortune, earning them enough money\nto retire. However, the true reason behind this shutdown remains unclear.\n\n**Operations**\n\nWhile this marketplace was the largest in the carding space, it also exhibited a severe\ndecline in the volume of compromised Card Not Present (CNP) and Card Present (CP)\nrecords posted over the past six months. Most other top-tier carding marketplaces actually\nincreased their posted data (largely CNP data, while CP data declined during COVID-19\nlockdowns) during this time. However, Joker’s Stash has received numerous user complaints\nalleging that card data validity is low, which even prompted the administrator to upload proof\nof validity through a card-testing service.\n\nImage 4: Joker’s Stash has posted fewer compromised CNP and CP records over the past\nsix months. The graph shows the percentage change in the number of cards posted by\ncomparing each month’s level to that of July 2020.\n\nAdditionally, JokerStash’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved advertising in\nadvance and then posting high-profile major breaches. The threat actor leveraged media\ncoverage of these breaches to boast about their ability to compromise even major\ncorporations. Most dark web marketplaces eschew such TTPs because they attract undue\nattention from security researchers and law enforcement; JokerStash actually celebrated\nsuch attention.\n\n\n-----\n\nJoker s Stash was one of the oldest observed dark web marketplaces and has operated\nsince 2014. In the past year, the marketplace has added over 40 million new records, the\nmajority of which were CP records. CP data was linked to major breaches, such as the\n[“BIGBADABOOM-III” breach that compromised Wawa or the](https://geminiadvisory.io/breached-wawa-payment-card-records-reach-dark-web/) [“BLAZINGSUN” breach that](https://geminiadvisory.io/jokers-stash-breaches-dickeys/)\ncompromised Dickey’s Barbecue Pit. CNP data was linked to Magecart attacks or\noccasionally phishing. Gemini calculated that Joker’s Stash has generated more than $1\nbillion USD in revenue over the last several years.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMany criminal groups split the sale of compromised data across numerous marketplaces.\n[For example, Gemini Advisory recently observed the “Keeper” group dividing stolen records](https://geminiadvisory.io/keeper-magecart-group-infects-570-sites/)\namong four leading marketplaces (including Joker’s Stash). Given Joker’s Stash’s high\nprofile, it relied on a robust network of criminal vendors who offered their stolen records on\nthis marketplace, among others. Gemini assesses with a high level of confidence that these\nvendors are very likely to fully transition to other large, top-tier dark web marketplaces.\n\nAccording to Wired [research, even the shutdown of the infamous Silk Road dark web](https://www.wired.com/2015/08/crackdowns-havent-stopped-dark-webs-100m-yearly-drug-sales/)\nmarketplace had very little impact on the overall dark web black market. The cybercriminals\nwho sold illicit goods and services there simply shifted to other marketplaces, and the\neconomy continued to function. The underground payment card economy is thus likely to\nremain largely unaffected by this shutdown.\n\n**Gemini Advisory Mission Statement**\n\n_Gemini Advisory provides actionable fraud intelligence to the largest financial organizations_\n_in an effort to mitigate ever-growing cyber risks.
