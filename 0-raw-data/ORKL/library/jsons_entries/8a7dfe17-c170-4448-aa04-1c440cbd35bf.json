It has primarily been targeting East Asian government organizations and\ninternational companies in a wide range of sensitive industries, including defence, energy, transportation, mining,\nhealthcare, and government entities, to name a few. Recently, it seems that Earth Akhlut has been starting to target\norganizations on a broader geographic scale, in every part of the world.\n\nThe group sends spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments created using the infamous ‘Royal Road’ Rich Text\nFormat (RTF) exploitation toolkit, which is known to be shared by several different threat actors. In addition, the group also\nuses phishing websites to gather credentials. We also noticed the exploitation of vulnerabilities in security products.\n\nAfter successful exploitation of the targeted machine, they drop payloads that include multiple custom backdoors. The\nbackdoors include Bisonal and Dexbia, which are usually written using the MFC framework, and some more advanced\nfamilies, such as the ShadowPad malware used in the NetSarang attacks [1], which is shared with a few other groups such\nas APT41 / Winnti. Once they gain control of one host, the threat actors use a variety of custom or repackaged tools to\ngather credentials or elevate privileges through known Windows exploits.\n\nMapping and monitoring the attacker’s infrastructure not only allowed us to discover interesting custom tools, such as a\nbackend command-and-control (C&C) panel for controlling infected machines, it also allowed us to find additional links to\nknown threat actors. Earth Akhlut uses a large variety of domain names and dynamic domain names, forming at least six\ndifferent clusters, which shows substantial operational capabilities.\n\nIn this research paper, we will first analyse the infection vector, starting with the documents weaponized with the ‘Royal\nRoad’ toolkit. We will then provide a detailed analysis of the different custom tools, shared modules, and malware families.\nWe will also summarize various post-exploitation tools that we noticed Earth Akhlut using. Finally, we will share additional\nintelligence on the attacker’s infrastructure and targets, as well as any likely connections and overlaps with other known\nthreat actors.\n\n**MEET EARTH AKHLUT**\n\nWe initially started tracking this threat actor in 2009, first reporting on the HeartBeat campaign [2] at the Association of\nAnti-Virus Asia Researchers (AVAR) conference in 2012, followed by the ‘Operation ORCA’ talk [3] at the Virus Bulletin\nconference in 2017. Little has been published [4, 5] about this threat actor, making them quite unknown to the general\npublic. We even noticed some IOCs being shared [6] without attributing the attacks to the group. There was one recent\npublication [7] on this group that describes some of the malware families used by Earth Akhlut. We believe it is high time\nto reveal more about Earth Akhlut through one of their ongoing campaigns – and to show just how extensive their\ninfrastructure is.\n\nTechnically speaking, Earth Akhlut has been using spear phishing since the beginning of its operations: they use targeted\nemails with lure documents such as Microsoft Office documents and PDF files to infect users. They have also used the same\n‘Bisonal’ malware family for many years – and still do. More recently, we have seen them targeting some of Trend Micro’s\nproducts exposed to the Internet to deliver malicious payloads to workstations in the internal network.\n\nThe following are some of the primary techniques used by the group:\n\n - Use of dynamic DNS domains with names impersonating legitimate services to stay under the radar and not raise\nsuspicion in the network log files. Some examples include yandexmedia[.]serveuser[.]com, Wikipedia[.]dnset[.]com,\nand videoservice[.]dnset[.]com.\n\n - Use of both custom and public tools.\n\n - Use of exclusive malware, either developed internally or custom-built by a third party.\n\n - Performing spear phishing attacks via several different social engineering tricks such as fake job applications and\nsummit invitations.\n\n - Use of zero-day and non-zero-day vulnerabilities in security products to compromise selected workstations.\n\n**SPEAR PHISHING**\n\nLike many other targeted attack threat actors, spear phishing is a staple of Earth Akhlut’s techniques. It is primarily used to\ninfect computers with malware, giving the threat actors initial access to a targeted system. In addition, Earth Akhlut might\nalso use emails that contain a link to a phishing page designed to trick recipients into providing their credentials.\n\nWe have observed Earth Akhlut using a specific phishing website that is designed to target people employed or connected\nwith the government of Mongolia, as seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n_Figure 1: Phishing site targeting people connected with the government of Mongolia._\n\nA closer look at the site’s source code reveals that it is a mirror of the official login page used by the Mongolian\ngovernment’s webmail system, but with slight modifications. The data transmitted on the phishing form is sent to a Python\nscript named ‘login.py’ located in the root of the phishing website.\n\nOne especially devious change made to the phishing trap is its domain name, email-gov-mn[.]com, which is very close to\nthe legitimate domain, email.gov.mn.\n\n**INITIAL COMPROMISE**\n\nEarth Akhlut uses several methods to compromise a targeted network and gain access to it. The most common is infection\nvia spear phishing email, where an email containing an infecting document is sent to a targeted email address. Earlier cases\nincluded executable files sent directly as attachments, while more recent examples generally make use of weaponized RTF\nfiles containing exploits.\n\nA slightly different method we have seen used by this threat actor in the wild is the use of legitimate corporate email\naddresses, most likely obtained by phishing, to send emails to other users. The use of these legitimate emails increases the\nchances of the victims clicking on the attachment, infecting their machines with malware.\n\nThe weaponized RTF documents used by Earth Akhlut are either custom-built or created using the Royal Road RTF\nweaponizer [8], a tool that allows attackers to produce infecting RTF documents using their own lure content. Royal Road\nhas reportedly been shared among several different Chinese threat actors since 2017. Since the start of 2019, we have\ncollected only a small number of unique Royal Road generated files spread by Earth Akhlut.\n\n_Figure 2: Infection chain for a typical Earth Akhlut attack._\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n**2018 campaign: Executable file sent via email**\n\nIt’s reasonable to assume that sending executable files through email is a method that was stopped many years ago, since\nnearly all email servers have stopped accepting these kinds of file attachments. However, we still saw Earth Akhlut using\nthis method in 2018.\n\nIn this case, Earth Akhlut targeted a Russian company producing technology and defence materials, using 1 May (Labor\nDay) related content to send emails allegedly about better working conditions for people in the defence industry. They also\ntook care to make it appear as if the emails had come from a trusted partner of the targeted company, spoofing a legitimate\nemail address and email signature from said partner.\n\n_Figure 3: Screenshot of a spear phishing email with an attached executable file. The message discusses better working_\n_conditions for defence employees._\n\n**Using custom-built RTF files**\n\nEarth Akhlut has sent several job application-themed spear phishing emails, which unfortunately are usually effective since\nthey do not seem very dangerous – especially for HR employees who receive these kinds of emails legitimately every day.\n\nWe caught one sample targeting the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, which was sent using a free webmail\naccount. A careful analysis of the email headers revealed that Earth Akhlut had actually sent the email from one of their\nC&C server IP addresses.\n\nThe delivered document shows the resume of an applicant, which was sent as an RTF file. The file actually contains\n_Microsoft Equation 2.0-related exploits (CVE-2017-11882 / CVE-2018-0802) that infect the target machine with the_\nBisonal02 backdoor.\n\nAs a side note, we’ve noticed a growing trend involving threat actors using fake resumes for their targeted attacks since it’s\nan effective way of tricking unsuspecting users into opening the attachments.\n\n**Current campaign: RTF document files built with Royal Road Weaponizer**\n\nThe Royal Road weaponizer has several variants, some of which other researchers have already previously explored [9].\nRoyal Road build documents usually containing an ‘OLE Package Object’, which gets extracted into the %TEMP%\ndirectory under the file name 8.t. Another object containing a shellcode decrypts (if the 8.t file is encrypted or mangled in\nsome way) and executes the 8.t file.\n\nOne example of a generated RTF created by Earth Akhlut is a fake resume for a job application, written in Russian (seen in\nFigure 4). The payload is an executable file: a Bisonal02 backdoor. Other Earth Akhlut RTF files generated using this tool\nhave been discovered in the wild with different payloads, such as the Bisonal01 backdoor and Dexbia.\n\n_Figure 4: Sample content showing a resume for a job application written in Russian._\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nAnother social engineering technique used by the threat actor involves sending emails concerning important events,\nconferences, and summits – with an accompanying attachment. In the exampl shown in Figure 5, the final payload is a\nDexbia backdoor.\n\n_Figure 5: An example of an infected RTF document using a defence-related summit as a social engineering lure._\n\nThe RTF files we discovered were written in either Mongolian, Korean, or Russian.\n\n**Security product exploitation**\n\nIn 2020, we saw Earth Akhlut targeting unpatched OSCE servers accessible from the Internet. using multiple exploits –one\nof which was unknown at the time of exploitation – to deliver a ShadowPad sample to selected targets.\n\nThe first vulnerability they used was CVE-2019-9489, a directory traversal vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One,\n_OfficeScan and Worry-Free Business Security that was patched in April 2019. The second vulnerability was_\nCVE-2020-8468, patched in March 2020, a content validation escape vulnerability involving Trend Micro Apex One\n(on premise) and OfficeScan XG, which was exploited to execute code through a malicious update delivered to selected\nworkstations. Both exploits were required to successfully pull off the attack, meaning a fully patched server would have\nprevented part of it.\n\nSince the discovery of this attack, which targeted some of our customers, we have continuously been monitoring for other\npotential incidents to take further action if necessary.\n\n**Targets**\n\nOur research allowed us to pinpoint several Earth Akhlut targets. At the time of writing, we have been able to identify 61\ndifferent targets in 19 countries across different industries and sectors, based on our monitoring from January to July 2020.\n\nSince our target analysis was based mostly on our telemetry from the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN),\nwe suspect Earth Akhlut will target even more companies in several other countries.\n\nThe group’s current targeting scope reveals that the threat actor is probably well-staffed since the data shows the ability to\nlaunch multiple attacks over a short period.\n\n_Figure 6: The industries targeted by Earth Akhlut._\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n_Figure 7: The countries affected by Earth Akhlut._\n\nSome insights gleaned from the data:\n\n - Taiwan was the most targeted country, mostly for its education industry\n\n - India was next, mostly for its oil & gas and energy industries\n\n - The education/research and energy sectors of the government have both been targeted\n\n - Organizations in the technology, manufacturing, government and healthcare industries appear to be the group’s primary\ntargets.\n\nThe targeted healthcare companies showcase different characteristics. One target, for example, is an expert in blood cells,\nwhile others manufacture pharmaceutical products and hardware. Yet another company is focused on technology research.\n\nNearly all of the affected targets can be considered as owners of high-value intellectual property, which might be interesting\nin the context of cyberespionage.\n\n**LINKS WITH THE THREAT ACTOR GROUP TICK**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Earth Akhlut started to make heavy use of ShadowPad in 2019. This malware has previously been\nattributed solely to Winnti/APT41.\n\nDuring our investigation, we found four ShadowPad samples using encryption keys similar to those used by the Earth\nAkhlut samples. However, each one showed a C&C server with a hard-coded IP address instead of a domain name. We\nnoticed that one of the samples was listed in the report of the ENTRADE operation [10], which is related to the TICK\ngroup. After conferring with the researchers investigating TICK, we confirmed that the two groups seem to have very close\nties. One thing for certain is that they share a ShadowPad builder. In the case of TICK, the ShadowPad samples are dropped\nby a family named CASPER, which is different from the droppers we have seen Earth Akhlut use.\n\n**ANALYSING EARTH AKHLUT’S MALWARE**\n\n**Custom backdoors**\n\nWhile Earth Akhlut’s spear phishing allows the threat actor to get one foot inside the door, the real workhorse is their array\nof custom backdoors, which are executed once the victim clicks on the malicious executable or lure document.\n\nThere are several backdoors used exclusively by the group, which indicates that they either have their own malware\ndevelopers or have the ability to get custom malware from a third party.\n\nMany of the backdoors share features. Some are likely based on the same code, while others may use the same encryption\nof configuration or network encryption; use the same (or similar) encryption keys, or use similar file names – among other\npossibilities. In some cases, there was nothing similar between the backdoors in terms of the source code – however, they\nshared the same C&C server.\n\nWe decided to organize all the backdoors into several groups, as shown in Table 1.\n\nThe next sections go into more technical detail on the backdoors used by the threat actor. The various subsections include\ntables listing the main characteristics of each backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n**Backdoor family name** **First seen**\nHeartbeat 2009\nOld Bisonal 2011\nChimaera 2012\nDexbia 2014\nBisonal01 2014\nBisonal02 2017\nSPM 2018\nTypehash 2019\nDumboc 2020\nIdles 2020\n\n_Table 1: The backdoors used by Earth Akhlut.

The backdoor communication uses raw\nsockets and different C&C servers for receiving commands and sending responses back to the primary C&C server.\n\nThe code of this backdoor was reused in the 2012 version of Bisonal. It also shows some similarities with the later\nChimaera backdoor – for example, the code snippet shown below for sending machine information to the C&C server. The\n‘Flag’ parameter, which contains the campaign ID, is also present in the Chimaera backdoor. It sends the machine’s\ninformation to the C&C server using wininet APIs.\n\n_Figure 8: Code snippet showing the similarity between the 2011 Bisonal variant and the Chimaera backdoor._\n\nThe 2012 version of Bisonal added a function for collecting operating system information that also contains a hard-coded\ncampaign ID. The same code is reused in the Chimaera backdoor.\n\n**Characteristics** **Details**\n\nAPI     - Winsock\n\nC&C address encryption      - XOR 0x1f\n\nC&C communication encryption      - XOR 0x28\n\nVisible strings       -

It needs to be run with command line\nparameters – either ‘–test’ or ‘–backdoor’ are accepted. The first backdoor request sent to the C&C server contains the\ncollected OS information. The data is then transmitted in the user-agent field of the HTTP header. Of note is the ‘flag’\nvalue, which is the hardcoded campaign ID in the binary.\n\n|Chimaera|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Characteristics|Details|\n|API|• urlmon • Winsock • Wininet|\n|C&C address encryption|• XOR 0x1f|\n|C&C communication encryption|• Plain text|\n|Visible strings|• “temp.ini” • e • “Up Fail” • “Up OK!” • “Run -%4d” • “Run OK!”|\n|Backdoor functions|• Download file • Execute file • Interactive shell • Set persistence • Enumerate processes|\n|Check VM|• __indword(‘VX’)|\n|OS information collection|• Computer name • IP address • OS version • Current tick count • Uptime in format %sDay%sHour%sMin|\n|Relation to Earth Akhlut|• Found in Earth Akhlut infrastructure|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n_Figure 11: Data sent from the malware to the C&C server, as seen in the User-Agent field of the HTTP header._\n\nThe second backdoor request sent to the C&C server, which is hexadecimal-encoded, collects OS information and the current\ntime, all embedded into the GET request parameter. The result of this request will be saved in the %TEMP%\\temp.ini file.\nAfterwards, four bytes from this file will be read and used as a victim ID for further C&C communication. Notice the a.asp\npath used to acquire the victim ID:\n\n_Figure 12: The encoded traffic sent to the C&C server by the backdoor._\n\nWhen the victim ID is obtained, b.asp is queried for new commands coming from the C&C servers.

It uses a custom string encryption algorithm using the atypical\nconstants 0x58BF and 0x3193.\n\nThe backdoor consists of the following steps:\n\n - Step 0: initial value of key = 1213 and is hard coded.\n\n - Step 1: from the given string, take two following characters, compute input[ii+1] + 26*input[ii] + 37. This results in a\nstring with half the length of the original string.\n\n - Step 2: compute the output character using the formula outchar = (input[ii]) ^ ((key >> 8) & 0xff).\n\n - Step 3: update key value using the above mentioned constants: key = (0x58BF – ((input[ii]) + key) * 0x3193) & 0xffff.\n\nAs for the output sent to the C&C server, the communication routine prepends a three-character prefix |%c|, where the\nmiddle letter depends on the type of response. The prefixes are as follows:\n\n|A| OS info\n\n|B| enumerate processes\n\n|C| terminate process\n\n|E| download & execute report\n\n|F| interactive shell read\n\nAfter the prefix, the zlib-compressed payload is added.\n\nDexbia samples usually contain a hard-coded campaign identifier, some of which are listed below:\n\n - 416-J - tes\n\n - 0209J - DS\n\n - 0216jHC - MN1223\n\n - 228KJ - 1228\n\n - 3sa - dis\n\n - new - ser\n\n - 711 - mfa820\n\n - ru - ser_ru\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n_Figure 15: Custom encryption code using the atypical constants 0x58BF and 0x3193._\n\nAs an example for this backdoor, starting with the initial encrypted string:\n\n - ELDLJFDRILGOEYFZGMCXDIHYGEDKAJIAFTFE\n\nOnce the first loop of the algorithm is done, it becomes\n\n - sY\\xef_\\xdb\\xaa\\x80\\x9b\\xa8KV\\xce\\xa0X\\t\\xd0\\x95\\x86\n\nAfter the second step, it reveals the unencrypted data:\n\n - www[.]riss[.]ntdll[.]net\n\n**_Bisonal 01a_**\n\n**Characteristics** **Details**\n\nAPI - Winsock\n\n                - Wininet\n\nC&C address encryption - XOR 0x15\n\n             - XOR 0x1D\n\nC&C communication - Base64\nencryption\n\nVisible strings  - “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322”\n(missing closing parenthesis)\n\n            - “CMD_LONG”\n\nBackdoor functions - Get OS info\n\n                - Enumerate processes\n\n                 - Terminate process\n\n                   - Interactive shell\n\n                 - Download file\n\n                  - Execute file\n\n                   - Uninstall itself\n\n                   - Wipe file (set size to 0)\n\nCheck VM N/A\n\nOS information collection - Hard-coded ID\n\n               - Computer name\n\n                 - IP address\n\n              - OS name\n\nRelation to Earth Akhlut - XOR 0x1D is somewhat similar to XOR 0x1F\n\n_Table 9: Details of the Bisonal 01a backdoor._\n\n|Bisonal 01a|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Characteristics|Details|\n|API|• Winsock • Wininet|\n|C&C address encryption|• XOR 0x15 • XOR 0x1D|\n|C&C communication encryption|• Base64|\n|Visible strings|• “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322” (missing closing parenthesis) • “CMD_LONG”|\n|Backdoor functions|• Get OS info • Enumerate processes • Terminate process • Interactive shell • Download file • Execute file • Uninstall itself • Wipe file (set size to 0)|\n|Check VM|N/A|\n|OS information collection|• Hard-coded ID • Computer name • IP address • OS name|\n|Relation to Earth Akhlut|• XOR 0x1D is somewhat similar to XOR 0x1F|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nUnlike previous versions of Bisonal 01a, this variant sends the data to the C&C server in Base64-encoded form, appended\nto the GET request.

For example, the first GET request is a random blob of data sent to the C&C\nserver.\n\nInitially, a request starts with ‘AAABAOcDAAA’, which can be decoded as ‘00 00 01 00 e7 03 00 00’.

The first stage is a fake oleacc.dll file that is sideloaded into memory by abusing a\nlegitimate and signed eComServer.exe file. The fake oleacc.dll decrypts the first stage of the typehash backdoor and injects\nit into the newly created svchost.exe process.\n\nThe first request sent to the C&C server comes with type parameter 0. This returns a XOR 0x37-encrypted payload, which\nis the second stage of the Typehash backdoor. The second stage gets decrypted, loaded into memory, and executed.\n\n_Figure 18: The first network communication from the backdoor._\n\nThe second stage of the Typehash backdoor begins when it acquires the OS info, including information on the MAC\naddress and its MD5 hash, which is computed and used as a hash value for identifying victim machines. The first request\nperformed for this stage is one type 1 request.\n\n_Figure 19: Typehash’s second stage type 1 request._\n\nIf the response to this request is a single byte ‘1’, the backdoor gets activated. Some of the Typehash C&C servers were\nwrongly configured, and we noticed a file named ‘on.txt’ that contained the single character ‘1’. It is likely the PHP script\nanswers with the content of such file, allowing the threat actor to easily disable its C&C server. Over the course of our\nmonitoring, we noticed multiple times the C&C being off for several days/weeks.\n\nThe first POST request uploads basic information from the infected machine in the form of a JSON object. The remote IP\naddress and closing bracket is missing in the request, but it will be appended on the server side to ensure that the JSON\nobject is valid. Notice the ‘Note’ item with the campaign ID, which is hard coded in binary.\n\n_Figure 20: The headers for the POST request sent by Typehash._\n\n|Characteristics|Details|\n|---|---|\n|Backdoor functions|• Enumerate drives • Enumerate files • Download file • Execute file • Delete file • Upload file • Enumerate processes • Kill process • Interactive shell • Enumerate services • Get OS info|\n|Check VM|• __indword(‘VX’)|\n|OS information collection|• Computer name • IP address • Code page • MAC address • isAdmin • isVM • referencedDomainName • ProcessorNameString • Total physical memory size • vlocale info|\n|Relation to Earth Akhlut|• Found in Earth Akhlut infrastructure|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n_Figure 21: The information uploaded based on the POST request._\n\nFinally, the regular C&C communication using a type 2 request begins.\n\n_Figure 22: C&C communication using a type 2 request._\n\nThe first letter of the received data is the command, followed by the various parameters specific to each command.\n\ncase 'c': enum_drives\ncase 'd': enum_files\ncase 'e': download_file\ncase 'f': shellexecute_file\ncase 'g': delete_file\ncase 'h': upload_file\ncase 'j': enum_processes\ncase 'k': kill_process\ncase 'l': interactive_shell\ncase 'm': stop interactive shell\ncase 'n': enum_services\ncase 'o': get_os_info\ncase 'q': enum_files2\ncase 'u': start with type1 request\ndefault : no operation\n\n_Figure 23: The received commands and their various parameters._\n\n_Figure 24: The generated file containing target information._\n\n**_Dumboc_**\n\n**Characteristics** **Details**\n\nAPI - Winsock\n\nC&C address encryption - Plain text\n\nC&C communication encryption - XOR 0x3F\n\nVisible strings - “recv_num is %d,code is %d\\r\\n”\n\n                - “10101011”\n\n                   - “hearttime is %d,code is %d\\r\\n”\n\n_Table 17 (part 1): Details of the Dumboc backdoor._\n\n|Dumboc|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Characteristics|Details|\n|API|• Winsock|\n|C&C address encryption|• Plain text|\n|C&C communication encryption|• XOR 0x3F|\n|Visible strings|• “recv_num is %d,code is %d\\r\\n” • “10101011” • “hearttime is %d,code is %d\\r\\n”|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n**Characteristics** **Details**\n\nBackdoor functions - Enumerate processes\n\n                 - Terminate process\n\n                   - Interactive shell\n\n                - Enumerate drives\n\n                 - Enumerate files\n\n                 - Upload file\n\n                  - Delete file\n\n                 - Delete folder\n\n                - Download file\n\n                - Terminate download\n\n                - Terminate upload\n\n                  - Execute file\n\n                 - Traffic forwarder\nCheck VM N/A\nOS information collection - Computer name\n\n              - OS name\n\n                 - IP address\n\n                - Local time\n\n                - Boot time\n\n               - Code page\nRelation to Earth Akhlut - Found in Earth Akhlut infrastructure\n\n_Table 17 (part 2): Details of the Dumboc backdoor._\n\nWe named the Dumboc backdoor based on a string hard coded in the ‘About’ dialog.

PoisonPlug) malware emerged for the first time in 2017 in an incident [13] involving the\nexploitation of the NetSarang software editor that delivered compromised updates to the victims. The malware was also\nused in supply chain attacks, such as the ASUS compromise [14] of 2018. More recent attacks [15] saw ShadowPad being\nused to target universities in Hong Kong. All these campaigns have been attributed to Winnti/APT41.\n\nWhen we started writing this report, the usage of this malware by other groups had not been reported yet – until just a few\nmonths ago, seeing a ShadowPad sample was a strong indicator of the involvement of Winnti/APT41. However, we have\nseen several other groups start using it – including Earth Akhlut since October 2019. Two recent publications [16, 17]\ndiscuss ShadowPad samples related to Earth Akhlut.\n\nThe sample we found is executed by running a legitimate file signed by Microsoft, which will sideload the malicious DLL\nand execute its code. On newer samples, the threat actor added some checks to verify that the DLL is loaded by the\nintended executable. This is probably an attempt to evade sandboxes running DLLs with the help of rundll32.exe.\n\nOnce these checks are passed, the DLL will decode its payload on the heap. The decoding algorithm is a custom one and\ninvolves calls to imul, add, or sub with hard-coded operands.\n\nThe payload contains anti-disassembly techniques that will prevent the disassembler from correctly parsing the code. After\nfixing the code with an IDAPython script, we finally landed in the ‘Root’ orchestrator, which allocates one memory zone\nfor each plug-in it embeds.\n\nWe noticed that the vast majority of samples linked to Earth Akhlut loaded five plug-ins: ‘Plugins’, ‘Config’, ‘Install’,\n‘Online’, and ‘HTTP’. This is significantly fewer compared to other ShadowPad operations, where every sample loaded\neight to 17 plug-ins.\n\nWe also noticed the ‘TCP’ and ‘UDP’ plug-ins being loaded in three samples. In such cases, the ShadowPad sample was\nnot a DLL, and jumped directly to the code that uses anti-disassembly techniques.\n\n**ID** **Name** **Purpose**\n\n100 Root Loads the different plug-ins\n\n101 Plugins Offers functions to other plug-ins\n\n102 Config Parses the encrypted configuration\n\n103 Install Handles the persistence of the malware and sends the first\nheartbeat to the C&C server\n\n104 Online Handles C&C communication by calling the relevant\nnetwork plug-in (starting with 2xx)\n\n200 TCP Handles TCP communication\n\n201 HTTP Handles HTTP communication\n\n202 UDP Handles UDP communication\n\n_Table 18: The plug-ins used by the ShadowPad samples we found._\n\nEach plug-in has a base address and a timestamp. In the different cases we analysed, the timestamps were a few days or\nhours before the compilation timestamp of the different executables.\n\nEvery ShadowPad sample comes with a configuration file that contains information, including:\n\n - ID\n\n - Version name\n\n - Registry key used for persistence\n\n - Name of the registry value\n\n - Name of the service installed for persistence\n\n - Description of the service\n\n - Paths to the malicious code\n\n - C&C server (up to six)\n\nIn all the cases we analysed, the ID is a 17-character-long string, with alphanumeric characters that seem meaningless. We\ndo not know if it was decrypted on the server side, or if it was just a random identifier.\n\nThe version number was sometimes similar to the ID or similar to the service name. In other cases, it contained some string\nand a date. When the version number includes a date, we verified that the date matches the time the attackers used the\nsamples.\n\n|ID|Name|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|100|Root|Loads the different plug-ins|\n|101|Plugins|Offers functions to other plug-ins|\n|102|Config|Parses the encrypted configuration|\n|103|Install|Handles the persistence of the malware and sends the first heartbeat to the C&C server|\n|104|Online|Handles C&C communication by calling the relevant network plug-in (starting with 2xx)|\n|200|TCP|Handles TCP communication|\n|201|HTTP|Handles HTTP communication|\n|202|UDP|Handles UDP communication|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nTable 19 shows the different version tags that match the later case and the compilation timestamp of the related sample. We\nverified that the compilation timestamp was consistent with the timestamp of the plug-ins.\n\n**Version tag** **Compilation timestamp**\n\nO4Z8-WLGC 2019-02-16 05:37:57\n\n0204-x64 2019-02-16 05:38:27\n\nGT-NewVer1030 2019-10-24 15:01:15\n\nOZIZ-GT-x64 2019-10-24 15:02:01\n\n20200120 2019-12-31 05:10:54\n\n20200220 2019-12-31 05:11:45\n\n20200309 2019-12-08 14:18:55\n\n0326x64 2020-03-11 15:58:39\n\n_Table 19: Version tag and compilation timestamps of the ShadowPad samples._\n\nOn certain occasions, we noticed a discrepancy between the date in the version number and the compilation date. While it\nis normal to have is a difference of a couple of days between the compilation and the operation itself, a three-month\ndifference is much more unusual. For example, in the case of the sample tagged ‘20200309’ (9 March, 2020), the\ncompilation date was 8 December, 2019. This could mean the actor compiled the samples three months in advance.\nHowever, in this case, the C&C domain name was registered in February 2020, which is not consistent with such careful\nplanning.\n\nWe believe that either the builder has a timestomping feature that would modify the compilation timestamp as well as the\nplug-in timestamp, or the actor uses a building environment (probably a virtual machine) that is not synchronized with a\ntime server. We find the latter scenario more likely.\n\n**POST EXPLOITATION TOOLS**\n\nAfter one of the backdoors infects a machine, the threat actor utilizes a set of private or publicly available tools to perform\nadditional tasks. Among the public tools, we include those that are based on or directly copied from various code-sharing\nrepositories, blog tutorials, and other sources.\n\nThese additional tasks may include acquiring additional system or network information, launching privilege escalation\ntools and hash computational tools, and running credential dumpers, hub relaying, and keyloggers. Earth Akhlut uses DLL\nsideloading vulnerabilities in legitimate signed applications to load some of these tools.\n\n**Private post-exploitation tools**\n\n**_DomainInfo_**\n\nDomainInfo is a custom information dumper named after the ‘DomainInfo’ string present in the PDB path. This tool seems\nto be proprietary to Earth Akhlut. We have seen the exact same file (same hash) used on victims in 2017 and 2019. It was\nuploaded to VirusTotal in 2015, and the PE metadata suggests the tool was compiled in 2014. This is a strong indicator that\nthe tool is not being used on a wide scale. In fact, it is rare to find the same tool being used for a period spanning multiple\nyears without any changes, if only to avoid detection. Before March 2019, no security solution detected the different\nsamples we have for this tool, probably because it is in the grey zone of ‘hack tools’ in that it is not malicious per se.\n\nThis custom tool dumps information from the Domain controller. It uses the following Network Management APIs [18]:\n\n - NetGetDCName\n\n - NetApiBufferFree\n\n - NetGroupGetUsers\n\n - NetGroupEnum\n\n - NetQueryDisplayInformation\n\n - NetLocalGroupGetMembers\n\n - NetLocalGroupEnum\n\n - NetGetJoinInformation\n\n - NetServerEnum\n\n - NetUserEnum.\n\n|Version tag|Compilation timestamp|\n|---|---|\n|O4Z8-WLGC|2019-02-16 05:37:57|\n|0204-x64|2019-02-16 05:38:27|\n|GT-NewVer1030|2019-10-24 15:01:15|\n|OZIZ-GT-x64|2019-10-24 15:02:01|\n|20200120|2019-12-31 05:10:54|\n|20200220|2019-12-31 05:11:45|\n|20200309|2019-12-08 14:18:55|\n|0326x64|2020-03-11 15:58:39|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nRunning the tool will result in an output consisting of an XML file with the following content:\n\n_Figure 27: The XML file containing the information obtained from DomainInfo._\n\n**_Hub relaying_**\n\nThe function and reason for employing the ‘hub-relaying’ technique is described in detail in Operation ORCA [19]. In\nshort, this tool runs on the C&C server and listens on ports 3925 and 5688. If a threat actor connects to port 3925, then hub\nrelaying is activated. After this, every time a connection from the victim on port 5688 is accepted, information about this\nconnection (such as the IP address and port used) is forwarded to an application listening on port 3925. For Earth Akhlut,\nthis setting means that losing control of the C&C server to law enforcement or researchers does not expose the actual back\nend logic – the C&C is simply a connection information forwarder.\n\n**Public post-exploitation tools**\n\nMost of the following post-exploitation tools were derived from a public source or proof-of-concept (PoC) code. Some of\nthem were converted from Python code to a PE with PyInstaller.\n\n**Purpose** **Comment / tool used**\n\nLocal privilege escalation CVE-2019-0803 and MS16-032 exploits\n\nCredential dumping gsecdump v0.7\n\nwdigest_extract\n\nLaZagne\n\nNetwork shares enumeration nbtscan 1.0.35\n\nInbtscan (Python version of nbtscan)\n\nKeylogging Keylogger1217\n\nLateral movement Eternal Blue exploits\n\n_Table 20: The public post-exploitation tools used by Earth Akhlut._\n\n**_CVE-2019-0803 and MS16-032 exploits_**\n\nThe Win32k vulnerability CVE-2019-0803 can be abused via a privilege escalation exploit that has PoC code available on\n_GitHub [20]. We have seen several obfuscated samples that exploit this specific vulnerability use execution logic that is_\ninspired by the freely available PoC.\n\nAnother exploit used by Earth Akhlut is MS16-032 [21], a local privilege escalation exploit for CVE-2016-0099.\n\n|Purpose|Comment / tool used|\n|---|---|\n|Local privilege escalation|CVE-2019-0803 and MS16-032 exploits|\n|Credential dumping|gsecdump v0.7 wdigest_extract LaZagne|\n|Network shares enumeration|nbtscan 1.0.35 Inbtscan (Python version of nbtscan)|\n|Keylogging|Keylogger1217|\n|Lateral movement|Eternal Blue exploits|\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n**_GSecDump v0.7_**\n\nGSecDump is a popular credential dumper that is used to obtain password hashes and LSA secrets from Windows\nmachines. This tool is easily found online.\n\n**_Nbtscan 1.0.35_**\n\nThe Nbtscan tool [22] is a NetBIOS Nameserver scanner that scans for open NeTBIOS nameservers on a given range of IP\naddresses. This tool is used by many threat actors, usually to enumerate remote shares.\n\n**_Inbtscan_**\n\nThe Inbtscan tool [23] is a NetBIOS scanner for Python with a code that is compiled to be executable with PyInstaller.\n\n**_WDigest_extract_**\n\nIf the Windows authentication protocol WDigest is enabled, lsass.exe retains a copy of the user’s plaintext password in\nmemory. This tool locates and extracts these passwords. Its code is likely based on a gist code [24].\n\n**_Eternal Blue_**\n\nEternal Blue is the exploit that was used for some of the most destructive cyber attacks in recent memory, such as the\nWannaCry ransomware attacks that crippled multiple organizations in May 2017. First leaked that very same year, it is still\nused to this date by various threat actors.\n\nThe exploit is based on an SMB vulnerability. The original Python code was compiled into an executable, and several\nversions of the exploit are available: eternalblue_exploit7, eternalblue_exploit8, and checkers, which checks if the host is\nvulnerable or not.\n\n**_LaZagne_**\n\nLaZagne [25] is an open-source tool for retrieving passwords stored on a local computer. The original Python code is\ncompiled into an executable.\n\n**_Keylogger1217_**\n\nKeylogger1217 tool is a keylogger written in Python with pyHook library and compiled into an executable with PyInstaller.\nIt captures keys as well as pastes from the clipboard when the CTRL+V key combination is pressed. Code similar to this\nkeylogger can be found in various publicly available gists [26].\n\n**_Chromium stealer_**\n\nThis tool is a credential stealer from various Chromium-based web browsers. It is written in Python and compiled with\nPyInstaller.\n\n_Figure 28: List of targeted Chromium-based web browsers and the paths to their profile directories._\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n**ANALYSIS OF EARTH AKHLUT INFRASTRUCTURE**\n\nAfter our long-term monitoring of the Earth Akhlut infrastructure, we were able to group the domain names into multiple\nclusters since we noticed overlaps in the usage of some IP addresses. While pivoting, we found multiple domains – some of\nwhich were older than 2015. In such cases, we chose not to investigate further.\n\nOne interesting observation that resulted from this approach was that clusters were linked to a particular malware family. In\nthe case of some domains, we could not find a related sample. However, the domains still had multiple overlaps with known\nmalicious domains. Thus, we assess there might be some malicious samples out there with such domains as their C&C servers.\n\n**Cluster 1**\n\nThis cluster is linked to the following malware families:\n\n - Shadowpad\n\n - Typehash\n\n - Chimaera\n\n - Dumboc\n\n - Bisonal 02\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\n**Cluster 2**\n\nThis cluster is older (2019), and is linked only to Shadowpad and Typehash samples.\n\nThe Shadowpad samples have a similar encryption algorithm as the Shadowpad samples found in Cluster 1, but we found\nno infrastructure overlap.\n\nashcrack.freetcp.com\n\nwww.ashcrack.freetcp.com\n\nheatidc.com\n\naccount.heatidc.com\n\ninfrast.ygto.com\n\nftp.infrast.ygto.com\n\nnotify.serveuser.com\n\nftp.notify.serveuser.com\n\nplatform.freetcp.com\n\nftp.platform.freetcp.com\n\nreply.ygto.com\n\ntripmerry.com\n\nforums.tripmerry.com\n\n**Cluster 3**\n\nThis cluster is linked mainly to old Bisonal and Bisonal 02 samples, as well as to one SPM backdoor. The domains here are\nusually older, with some going as far back as 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nshuudans.com\n\nwww.shuudans.com\n\nmost.shuudans.com\n\ntosya.shuudans.com\n\nstcinet.com\n\nstcnet.ddns.net\n\nsvyaztulaya.dynamic-dns.net\n\ntsahimt.com\n\nwww.tsahimt.com\n\nftp.tsahimt.com\n\ntsowe.2waky.com\n\nwww.tsowe.2waky.com\n\ntube.compress.to\n\nvip.fartit.com\n\nvip.onedumb.com\n\nworktrs.wikaba.com\n\nwww.worktrs.wikaba.com\n\nyandexmedia.serveuser.com\n\n**Cluster 4**\n\nThese domains are mainly linked to the Dexbia malware family, but also to some old Bisonal samples. This cluster contains\nthe oldest domains found in this research, some of them dating back to 2014. As stated previously, we did not investigate\nolder domains, even if some links could easily be found.\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\ngmarket.system-ns.org\n\nhome-blog.dynssl.com\n\nhotadobes.com\nwww.hotadobes.com\n\nkakao.myonlineportal.org\n\nlovehome.zzux.com\n\nluckybabys.dnset.com\n\nlucylucy.dynamic-dns.net\n\nmedia.myonlineportal.net\n\nmissca.justdied.com\n\nwww.movie2014.passas.us\n\nwww.music2014.passas.us\n\nofficerevise.com\nwww.officerevise.com\n\noffices-update.com\nwww.offices-update.com\n\nonline-offices.com\n\nredfish.misecure.com\n\nserviceonline.otzo.com\n\nsdkpress.com\n\ntcostream.dhcp.biz\n\ntradekorea.system-ns.org\n\ntvpot.system-ns.org\n\nuacmoscow.com\nwww.uacmoscow.com\n\nvideoservice.dnset.com\n\nwebtvpot.system-ns.org\n\nwikipedia.dnset.com\n\nWe also found two clusters for which we could not find any related malware, but that are still somehow linked to our\ninfrastructure, typically by one or two overlaps with one of the other clusters. We believe that we either missed samples\nrelated to them, or the domains are used for another purpose that we were not aware of.\n\n**Cluster 5**\n\nFor this cluster, only one old Bisonal sample was found for the chromeupdate.lflink.com domain during the Operation Orca\ninvestigation presented at VirusBulletin in 2017. The other domains have no related samples. This might mean these\ndomains are no longer used. However, we still noticed some IP address activity in 2020 for some of them.\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nbravojack.justdied.com\n\nwww.bravojack.justdied.com\n\nchromeupdate.lflink.com\n\ncnnmirror.com\n\nwww.cnnmirror.com\n\ngmailserverweb.com\n\nwww.gmailserverweb.com\n\nhavsar.com\n\nlubny23.com\n\nwww.lubny23.com\n\nnews-serverweb.com\n\nwww.news-serverweb.com\n\nprettyrose.justdied.com\n\nwww.prettyrose.justdied.com\n\n**Cluster 6**\n\nNo samples were found related to any of these domain names, but we still found some links with the domains from other\nclusters.

Instead of drastically modifying what has worked for them, the threat actor has\nopted for evolution over innovation. We expect Earth Aklhut to continue to operate behind the scenes with little fanfare,\nevolving their tools, tactics and procedures to expand their reach further.\n\n\n-----\n\n,,\n\nOn the one hand, this means that the group’s methods for the past few years have proven to be effective. On the other hand,\nthere is a silver lining: the industries, businesses, and individual users who are the potential targets of Earth Akhlut can\ndefend against the group’s most common initial access technique. This includes:\n\n - Learning how to recognize and identify spear phishing emails. This includes mistakes in the text itself, such as\nmisspelled words and odd vocabulary, as well as seemingly out-of-context messages. If an email seems suspicious, it’s\nbetter to err on the side of caution and avoid it.\n\n - Avoiding downloading attachments or clicking links in an email unless certain that they are legitimate.\n\n - Updating applications and systems regularly to avoid possible exploitation of vulnerabilities and potential weak points.\n\n - Applying whitelisting procedures, blocking any unused ports, and disabling unused components if possible.\n\n - Monitoring system traffic for any suspicious behaviour.\n\nTo guard against any potential exploitation with this or any other vulnerability, we always highly encourage that our\ncustomers apply the latest critical patches and security fixes as early as possible after release and ensure that user\ncredentials (especially admin or root) are always carefully managed. Specifically for Trend Micro Apex One and OfficeScan\nproducts, we recommend the restriction of access to the management server to internal network or VPN users only\nwhenever feasible. If this is not possible, for example with external workstations outside the VPN, then it is possible to set\nup Edge Relay [27] to help mitigate some of the risk of having the server exposed to the Internet.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] Trend Micro.
