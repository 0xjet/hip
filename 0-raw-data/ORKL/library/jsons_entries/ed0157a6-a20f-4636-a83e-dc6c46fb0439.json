    "plain_text": "# The Curious Case of an Unknown Trojan Targeting German-Speaking Users\n\n(/2016/06/21/the-curious-case-of-an-unknown-trojan-targeting-german-speaking-users)\n\nby **[Floser Bacurio and Roland Dela Paz | Jun 21, 2016 | Filed in: Security Research (/category/security-research)](https://blog.fortinet.com/category/security-research)**\n\nLast week, an unidentified malware (with SHA-256\n\n171693ab13668c6004a1e08b83c9877a55f150aaa6d8a624c3f8ffc712b22f0b) was discovered and\n\n[circulated (https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/743345104333606912) on Twitter by researcher](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/743345104333606912)\n\n@JAMES_MHT. Many researchers - including us - were unable to identify the malware so we decided to dig a\n\nbit further.\n\nIn this post, we will share our findings about this malware: its targets, technical analysis, the related attacks\n\nand the threat actor behind it.\n\n## Targets\n\nOne of the first things we wanted to know is if this malware has a specific target–thanks to researcher\n\n[@benkow_ (https://twitter.com/benkow_) some open directories on the malware C&C were discovered. One](https://twitter.com/benkow_)\n\nof the open directories contained logs of victim IPs and computer names:\n\n\n-----\n\nconcentration of victims from Germany and Austria:\n\nIncidentally, a quick dump of the malware code reveals the string “my_de” and “my_botnet” where the “de” in\n\nthe first string may refer to Germany’s country code:\n\nDue to this and the results of our analysis below, we tagged this malware DELoader (detected as\n\nW32/DELoader.A!tr).\n\n## DELoader Analysis\n\nIn a nutshell, DELoader’s primary purpose is to load additional malware on the system. It does this by initially\n\ncreating a suspended explorer.exe process:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe injected DLL then attempts to download a file from the link hxxp://remembermetoday4.asia/00/b.bin:\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon the time of analysis, the malware C&C was already sinkholed. Code-wise, the malware expects to\n\ndownload a portable executable (PE) file as it validates the MZ header of the downloaded file. If valid, this PE\n\nfile is then copied to a newly allocated memory:\n\nIt then searches for instance of a running explorer.exe process where it then injects the downloaded file using\n\n_CreateRemoteThread API:_\n\n\n-----\n\nDELoader’s routine doesn’t tell much about its intentions since its payload simply installs an additional PE file.\n\nThis PE file could be any malware, or simply an updated copy of itself.\n\nEither way, it leads us to the next question – what is the motive behind DELoader?\n\n## Related Attacks\n\nThe registrant information of the malware C&C, resdomactivationa.asia, leads us to the next clue:\n\nThe registrant details list someone named Aleksandr Sirofimov from Russia. Of course, we certainly don’t\n\nknow if Aleksandr is a real person, a stolen identity, an alias for a group, or the ‘nom de guerre’ of an\n\nindividual cybercriminal. However, the important thing is that these same registrant details have been\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is an overview of some of the related attacks we were able to correlate using the email\n\naddress sir777alex@outlook.com:\n\nFrom the above graph we can extract the infection chain for DELoader, which is delivered through malicious\n\nJavaScript downloaders:\n\nSince the JavaScript downloaders come from ZIP files with “invoice” themes, it is more or less sent to victims\n\nas an attachment to malicious emails.\n\n\n-----\n\nrd\n\n“Aleksandr,” registered malicious domains as early as the 3 quarter of 2015, while DELoader first surfaced\n\nby at least February of 2016.\n\nOne of the malicious tools “Aleksandr” used is a Zeus variation – an infamous banking Trojan whose source\n\ncode was leaked (http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-zeus-source-code-leaked\nnow-what/) five years ago. Here is a graph of some of the related Zeus variants out of the many Zeus C&C\n\ndomains “Aleksandr” registered:\n\nAn online search of the domain goodvin77787.in leads us to this blog\n\n(https://rebsnippets.blogspot.com.br/2015/11/dhl-themed-zeus-campaign-is-using.html). The blog talks\n\nabout a DHL-themed Zeus campaign targeting German-speaking users where all the related Zeus C&Cs\n\nwere registered using “Aleksandr’s” details.\n\nSo we now know that person or persons behind “Aleksandr” have been (or are still) involved in a malicious\n\ncampaign for stealing banking credentials. True to the nature of DELoader, the previous campaign also\n\ntargeted German-speaking users.\n\n## Are German-Speaking Users \"Aleksandr’s\" Only Target?\n\nAnother domain the individual or group known as “Aleksandr” registered is bestbrowser-2015.biz. This\n\ndomain was used as a C&C server for Android Marcher variants – an Android banking Trojan sold on\n\nRussian underground forums:\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, these trojans were configured to steal credentials from Australian banks. Below is a code snippet\n\nfrom one of the Android Marcher samples:\n\nIt is worth noting that these Marcher variants surfaced around the same time “Aleksandr” was running Zeus\n\nrd th\n\ncampaigns in the 3 and 4 quarter of 2015. This suggests that he was running his malicious regional\n\ncampaigns simultaneously.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile DELoader is a relatively new malware, the findings in this research demonstrate that the threat actor\n\nbehind it has actually been around for quite some time, and has left a substantial amount of fingerprints over\n\nthe Internet.\n\nHistorical information shows that the individual or group using the name “Aleksandr” have been involved in\n\nbank information theft not only of German-speaking users, but have also targeted Australian users. It is\n\npossible that DELoader may be used to aid in similar purposes in the future.\n\nWe are unable to confirm the legitimacy of “Aleksandr’s” registrant details, or if he (or they) is working with a\n\ngroup. We may, however, have an idea on where “Aleksandr” is located.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou might have also noticed that one of the IPs deviated from that area – it resolved to Kiev,Ukraine:\n\nThis is odd since German is not a common language in Ukraine. So we theorized that this anomalous event\n\nmay be due to someone testing the DELoader.\n\nTo test our theory, we looked up the IP in the C&C logs to find more information. Can you find the interesting\n\nstring in the IP’s computer name below?\n\nHigh five if you found “ALEXANDR”.\n\n-= FortiGuard Lion Team =\n_IOCs_\n\n_DELoader SHA-256 hashes (all detected as W32/DELoader.A!tr):_\n\n_72faed0bc66afe1f42bd7e75b7ea26e0596effac65f67c0ac367a84ec4858891_\n\n_5d759710686db2c5b81c7125aacf70e252de61ab360d95e46cee8a9011c5693f_\n\n_c16281c83378a597cbc4b01410f997e45b89c5d06efada8000ff79c3a24d63ca_\n\n_171693ab13668c6004a1e08b83c9877a55f150aaa6d8a624c3f8ffc712b22f0b_\n\n_5afee15a022fcdb12cc791dd02db0ec6beb2e9152b312b2251f2b8ecfe62e03c_\n\n_103c6f425cfcd5eb935136f8c4ce51b9556974545bc6b7947039405164d46b0d_\n\n_73 7b54 290b297 713 0 b07 7 2d822_ _67 d61b9981256464273d63892_\n\n\n-----\n\n_yberprojects22017.info_\n\n_masterhost8981.asia_\n\n_nov15mailmarketing.in_\n\n_auspostresponse22.asia_\n\n_goodwinn8.asia_\n\n_mastehost12312.asia_\n\n_masterhost1333.asia_\n\n_marketingmas.in.net_\n\n_remembermetoday4.asia_\n\n_startupproject33676.asia_\n\n_bestbrowser-2015.biz_\n\n_marketing5050.asia_\n\n_marketingking878.asia_\n\n_yidckntbrmhuuhmq.com_\n\n_resdomactivationa.asia_\n\n_ukcompanymarketing.asia_\n\n_goodvin77787.in_\n\n_jajajakala8212.asia_\n\n_masterhost122133.asia_\n\n_masterj.in_\n\n_lalalababla.asia_\n\n_responder201922.asia_\n\n_cyberprojects2727.info_\n\n_super-sexy-girl2015.net_\n\n_jxsraxhlccokkrob.com_\n\n_mastehost88832.asia_\n\n_masterlin888.pw_\n\n_mamba777.in_\n\n_copolsox.us_\n\n_10cyberprojects2016.asia_\n\n_startupproject336.asia_\n\n_masterhost122133.asia_\n\nby **[Floser Bacurio and Roland Dela Paz | Jun 21, 2016 | Filed in: Security Research (/category/security-research)](https://blog.fortinet.com/category/security-research)**\n\nTags: [zeus banking trojan (/tag/zeus-banking-trojan)](https://blog.fortinet.com/tag/zeus-banking-trojan) [zbot (/tag/zbot)](https://blog.fortinet.com/tag/zbot) [bank fraud (/tag/bank-fraud)](https://blog.fortinet.com/tag/bank-fraud)\n\n[DELoader (/tag/deloader)](https://blog.fortinet.com/tag/deloader) [Android Marcher (/tag/android-marcher)](https://blog.fortinet.com/tag/android-marcher)\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\np, g y y (\n\n\n[ Previous Post: Securing Critical Infrastructures (/2016/06/21/securing-critical-infrastructures)](https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/06/21/securing-critical-infrastructures)\n\n\n**0 Comments** **[Fortinet Blog](https://disqus.com/home/forums/fortinetblog/)** [1](https://disqus.com/home/inbox/) **Login**\n\n\n Recommend\n\n\n### ⤤ Share Sort by Best\n\n Start the discussion…\n\nBe the first to comment.\n\n\n### ✉ Subscribe d Add Disqus to your site Add Disqus Add � Privacy\n\nCorporate\n\n[About Fortinet (http://fortinet.com/aboutus/aboutus.html)](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/aboutus.html)\n\n[Investor Relations (http://investor.fortinet.com)](http://investor.fortinet.com/)\n\n[Careers (http://jobs.fortinet.com)](http://jobs.fortinet.com/)\n\n[Partners (http://fortinet.com/partners/index.html)](http://fortinet.com/partners/index.html)\n\n[Global Offices (http://fortinet.com/aboutus/locations.html)](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/locations.html)\n\n[Fortinet in the News (http://fortinet.com/aboutus/media/news.html)](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/media/news.html)\n\n[Contact Us (http://fortinet.com/contact_us/index.html)](http://fortinet.com/contact_us/index.html)\n\nHow to Buy\n\n[Find a Reseller (http://fortinet.com/partners/reseller_locator/locator.html)](http://fortinet.com/partners/reseller_locator/locator.html)\n\n[FortiPartner Program (http://fortinet.com/partners/partner_program/fpp.html)](http://fortinet.com/partners/partner_program/fpp.html)\n\n[Fortinet Store (https://store.fortinet.com)](https://store.fortinet.com/)\n\nProducts\n\n[Product Family (http://fortinet.com/products/index.html)](http://fortinet.com/products/index.html)\n\n[Certifications (http://fortinet.com/aboutus/fortinet_advantages/certifications.html)](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/fortinet_advantages/certifications.html)\n\n[Awards (http://fortinet.com/aboutus/fortinet_advantages/awards.html)](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/fortinet_advantages/awards.html)\n\n[Video Library (http://video.fortinet.com)](http://video.fortinet.com/)\n\nService & Support\n\n[FortiCare Support (http://fortinet.com/support/forticare_support/index.html)](http://fortinet.com/support/forticare_support/index.html)\n\n[Support Helpdesk (https://support.fortinet.com)](https://support.fortinet.com/)\n\n[FortiGuard Center (http://fortiguard.com)](http://fortiguard.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n(/feed)\n\nCopyright © 2000 - 2016 Fortinet, Inc.
