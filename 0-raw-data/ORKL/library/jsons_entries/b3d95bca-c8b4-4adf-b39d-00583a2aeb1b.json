The application, detected by ESET security software\nas Android/TrojanDownloader.Agent.JI, tricks its victims into granting it special permissions in the Android\naccessibility menu and uses these to download and execute additional malware of the attackers’ choice.\n\nAccording to our analysis, the trojan targets devices running Android, including the latest versions. It is\ndistributed via compromised websites – adult video sites, but also via social media. Under the pretense of\nsafety measures, the websites lure users into downloading a fake Adobe Flash Player update. If victims fall for\nthe legitimate-looking update screen and runs the installation, they have more deceptive screens to look\nforward to.\n\nFigure 1: Fake Flash Player update screen\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThe next phony screen pops up following successful installation, claiming “too much consumption of energy”\nand urging the user to turn on a fake “Saving Battery” mode. Like most malicious pop ups, the message won’t\nstop appearing until the victim gives in and agrees to enable the service. This opens the Android Accessibility\nmenu, showing a list of services with accessibility functions. Among the legitimate ones, a new service (created\n\n\n-----\n\nby the malware during installation) named Saving battery appears. The service then requests permissions to\n_Monitor your actions, Retrieve window content and Turn on Explore by Touch – all crucial for future malicious_\nactivity, enabling the attacker to mimic the user’s clicks and select anything displayed on their screen.\n\nFigure 2: Pop-up screen requesting “Saving Battery” after install\n\nFigure 3: Android Accessibility menu with the malicious service\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Android Accessibility menu with the malicious service\n\nOnce the service is enabled, the fake Flash Player icon hides from the user. However, in the background, the\nmalware is busy contacting its C&C server and providing it with information about the compromised device. The\nserver responds with a URL leading to a malicious app of the cybercriminal’s choice – in the detected case,\nbanking malware (though it could be any malware ranging from adware through spyware, and on to\nransomware). After acquiring the malicious link, the compromised device displays a bogus lock screen with no\noption to close it, covering the ongoing malicious activity beneath it.\n\nFigure 5: Lock screen covering malicious activity\n\nThis is when the permission to mimic the user’s clicks comes in handy – the malware is now free to download,\ninstall, execute and activate device administrator rights for additional malware without the user’s consent, all\nwhile remaining unseen under the fake lock screen. After the app’s secret shenanigans are done, the overlay\nscreen disappears and the user is able to resume using the mobile device – now compromised by the\ndownloaded malware.\n\n## Has my device been infected? How do I clean it?\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you think you might have installed this fake Flash Player update in the past, you can easily verify by checking\nfor ‘Saving Battery’ under Services in the Accessibility menu. If listed under the services, your device may very\nwell be infected.\n\nDenying the service its permissions will only bring you back to the first pop up screen and will not get rid of\nAndroid/TrojanDownloader.Agent.JI.\n\nTo remove the downloader, try manually uninstalling the app from Settings -> Application Manager -> FlashPlayer.\n\nIn some instances, the downloader also requests that the user activate Device administrator rights. If that turns\nout to be the case and you can’t uninstall the app, deactivate the administrator rights by going to Settings ->\nSecurity -> Flash-Player and then proceed with uninstalling.\n\nEven after doing so, your device might still be infected by countless malicious apps installed by the downloader.\nTo make sure your device is clean, we recommend using a reputable mobile security app as a hassle-free way\nto detect and remove threats.\n\n## How to stay safe\n\nTo avoid dealing with the consequences of nasty mobile malware, prevention is always the key. Apart from\nsticking to trustworthy websites, there are a couple more things you can do to stay safe.\n\nIf you’re downloading apps or updates in your browser, always check the URL address to make sure you’re\ninstalling from the intended source. In this particular case, the only safe place to get your Adobe Flash Player\nupdate is from the official Adobe website.\n\nAfter running anything you’ve installed on your mobile device, pay attention to what permissions and rights it\nrequests. If an app asks for permissions that don’t seem appropriate to its function, don’t enable these without\ndouble checking.\n\nLast but not least, even if all else fails, a reputable mobile security solution will protect your device from active\nthreats.\n\n[If you’d like to find out more about Android-based malware, look into our latest research on the topic.
