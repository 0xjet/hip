Economic espionage or military intelligence?\n\nIt was the best of times; it was the worst of times. While Russian advanced persistent threat\n(APT) activity [against the US and other international organizations has dominated the](https://threatconnect.com/guccifer-2-0-dnc-hack-fancy-bears/?utm_campaign=DNC%20Guccifer%202.0%20Fancy%20Bears%20Research&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)\nheadlines recently, Chinese APT actors have been active outside the limelight. In June 2016,\nChinese APT actors were discovered using a customized implant within the network of a\nEuropean consumer electronics company that specializes in drone technologies and a U.S.\nsubsidiary of a French energy management company that builds infrastructure for the U.S.\ngovernment and the Department of Defense. Chinese efforts against the European\nconsumer drone company appear to be economically motivated and represent a deviation\nfrom the [September 2015 agreement between the U.S. and China to disavow economic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-china-vow-not-to-engage-in-economic-cyberespionage/2015/09/25/90e74b6a-63b9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html)\nespionage. Due to their involvement with the U.S. military, it could be argued targeting the\nenergy management company was for military intelligence and not economic espionage.\n\nUsing the [Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, we will start by walking through the technical](https://threatconnect.com/blog/diamond-model-threat-intelligence-star-wars/)\naxis of the attack where we found malware used by multiple Chinese APTs calling back to a\ndomain with the same registrant as those used in the 2015 Anthem and OPM breaches.\nWe’ll pivot to the socio-political axis of the attack, and discuss how the victims fit the\ntargeting profile of at least one Chinese APT – although we are unable to attribute the attack\nto a specific Chinese APT at this time.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Capabilities: HttpBrowser Backdoor\n\nOn June 08, 2016 ThreatConnect identified a malicious executable MD5:\n3BEA073FA50B62C561CEDD9619CD8425. This malware is a variant of “HttpBrowser,” a\nbackdoor used by multiple Chinese APTs, including EMISSARY PANDA (aka APT27/TG3390) and [DYNAMITE PANDA (aka APT18/Wekby/TG-0416). Some reports refer to](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/unit42-new-wekby-attacks-use-dns-requests-as-command-and-control-mechanism/)\n[HttpBrowser as the GTalk trojan or “Token Control.” According to TrendMicro, HttpBrowser](https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf)\nallows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload or download files, and capture\nkeystrokes on a compromised system, similar to other remote administration tools (RATs).\nAntivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and typically based upon heuristic\nsignatures. The report also indicates HttpBrowser is not available on underground markets.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral variants of the HttpBrowser backdoor exist; however, in this particular sample\nbeaconing network traffic stands out as the telltale “HttpBrowser/1.0” User-Agent string is\nreplaced with “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2) Gecko/%lu Firefox/3.0.1”, where\n%lu is a format modifier that appends an unsigned long numerical data type to the useragent string.\n\nThe malware sends system information using the query string “computer=<COMPUTER\nNAME>&lanip=<LAN IP>&uid=<Unique ID>&os=<OS VERSION>&relay=<RELAY\nNUMBER>&data=<DATA>”\n\n## Infrastructure: Adobesys[.]com and a familiar registrant\n\nLeveraging ThreatConnect’s WHOIS function, we identified the malware’s hardcoded\ncommand and control domain adobesys[.]com was registered by the Chinese domain\nreseller and mass registrant, li2384826402[@]yahoo[.]com. This email address is infamous\n[for registering domains used in the DEEP PANDA-attributed Anthem and](https://threatconnect.com/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/) [OPM attacks in](https://threatconnect.com/opm-breach-analysis-update/)\n2015, and provides additional evidence tying this HttpBrowser activity to Chinese APT\nactors.\n\nUsing ThreatConnect’s Farsight Passive DNS integration, we can identify the\nadobesys[.]com domain was hosted at two IP addresses — 173.231.11[.]24 and\n185.92.222[.]81 — while the domain most likely was operational. One other domain,\n\n\n-----\n\nnewsoft2[.]com, was hosted at the 185.92.222[.]81 IP during the same timeframe as\nadobesys[.]com. WHOIS information indicates that newsoft2[.]com was also registered by a\nChinese registrant (omyname@gmail[.]com), and its co-location with the malicious\nadobesys[.]com domain suggests that it may be operated by the same actors behind the\nHttpBrowser activity. Indicators from this activity have been shared in incident 20151228A:\nChinese HttpBrowser Activity Targeting European Companies.\n\n## Victims: Two Targets\n\nWe provided a lead on the malware and adobesys[.]com to a partner, who collected\nassociated network traffic and worked with us to analyze the activity. In this case, the activity\nwas targeted against only a few companies. We determined the Chinese actors used the\n“HttpBrowser” backdoor variant to target a control systems engineer in product development\nat a European consumer drone company. The traffic also helped us identify another target:\nthe U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company that has contracts with the\nU.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government elements to implement energy\nmanagement and SCADA solutions.\n\nBoth organizations were alerted to this activity shortly after it was discovered. At this time,\nwe have no indication what, if any, data was stolen from them.\n\nDownload Our Whitepaper - Fragmentation: The Silent Killer of Your Security Management\nProgram\n\n## Adversary: Pondering the PANDAs\n\n[While we cannot state for certain which Chinese APT is behind this activity, targeting a](https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf)\nconsumer drone company and energy management company is most consistent with\nprevious EMISSARY PANDA targeting. Both EMISSARY and DYNAMITE PANDA have\n[previously targeted the defense and aerospace industries, among others; however,](https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf)\nEMISSARY PANDA is the only one of the two known to have targeted energy companies.\nAccording to the [Secureworks report, EMISSARY PANDA commonly conducts strategic web](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage)\ncompromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, on websites associated with the\ntarget organization’s industry to increase the likelihood of compromising victims with relevant\ninformation. EMISSARY PANDA also uses spearphishing emails to target specific victims. At\nthis time we do not know whether SWCs or spearphishing emails were used to target the\nvictim organizations.\n\n## Socio-Political: Discussing Possible Motivations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HttpBrowser sample piqued our interest since the information security community has\nhad a heightened focus on whether or not Beijing is abiding by the September 2015\nagreement between U.S. and China to disavow economic espionage. The U.S. subsidiary of\nthe French energy management company looks like an artful dodge. These dual use\norganizations – those that possess significant intellectual property and are also involved with\nthe U.S. government – present tempting targets for China that could facilitate a variety of\nespionage efforts. However, China could claim such activity constitutes military espionage\nand therefore does not violate the agreement between Presidents Obama and Xi from last\nSeptember.\n\nBy contrast, targeting the European civilian drone maker looks like a case of economically\nmotivated espionage. The world’s largest and most popular drone manufacturer is China’s\nDaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI), which currently holds about 70% of the commercial\ndrone market share and [was valued at over $10 billion in May 2015. The emerging global](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/29/drones-in-2016-4-numbers-everyone-should-know.aspx)\nmarket for business services using commercial drones was recently valued at over $127\nbillion due to the growing applicability of drones across industries including agriculture,\nmapping, and surveillance.\n\nIn this instance, China most likely is seeking to quash any competition posed to DJI’s\ncommand of the market. Within the command and control traffic we were able to identify that\na control systems engineer — with probable access to the European firm’s proprietary drone\nintellectual property and technical data — was targeted as a part of this activity, which likely\nfurther demonstrates the motivation behind the operation. With access to the targeted\ncompany’s intellectual property, sensitive communications, and product roadmap, China\ncould provide its favored companies with economic advantages such as:\n\n1. Integrating competitors’ unique or proprietary capabilities: Many commercial\n\ndrones rely on custom software for capabilities such as stabilization, tracking, and\nGPS. Stealing and integrating competitors’ technologies would lessen any advantage\nthat competitors would have over Chinese drones.\n2. Preempting competitors’ innovations: Leveraging compromised intellectual property\n\non drone innovations could allow Chinese companies to advance their own product\nlines beyond what competitors plan to introduce in future products.\n3. Preempting financial or pricing moves from competitors: In an industry where\n\nprice wars and gouging can have a significant impact on the competition, having the\ninside scoop on how your competitors plan to price their drones can provide an upper\nhand in attempting to undercut them and steal market share.\n4. Understanding competitors’ business and development plans or bid efforts:\n\nInsider information on how competitors plan to expand their business, augment\nmanufacturing, market their product, or bid contracts, can all help Chinese drone\ncompanies gain an advantage over their competitors.\n\n## Economic Espionage Evolution?\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost\ncertainly hasn’t ended and likely has evolved to help solidify leading market shares. In some\nways, solidifying the dominant Chinese firm in a market feels like the next chapter in\neconomic espionage. The overarching storyline of China’s economic espionage has been\ntargeting strategic industries and allowing China to catch up with established champions.\n[Chinese APT efforts against American Steel manufacturers likely facilitated the rise in](https://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2014/u.s.-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-with-cyber-espionage-against-u.s.-corporations-and-a-labor-organization-for-commercial-advantage)\n[Chinese world steel production from about 15% in 2000 to 50% in 2015.](http://qz.com/699979/how-chinas-overproduction-of-steel-is-damaging-companies-and-countries-around-the-world/)\n\nChina may be attempting to avoid the ire of the U.S. government as it targets organizations\nthat are headquartered elsewhere. Furthermore, China may also be attempting to be more\nefficient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple intelligence\nrequirements. Targeting such organizations could allow China to explain away their activity\nas non-economic espionage, thereby adhering (with their fingers crossed) to the Rose\nGarden agreement.\n\n\n-----",
