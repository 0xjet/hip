Blending whaling (high-level spear phishing)\n\n techniques with advanced malware and other complex attack avenues (such as digital certificate\n\n factoring), the threat actors have been able to run their business undisturbed for years, except for the few\n\n times when samples of DarkHotel malware got documented in blog posts by threat researchers.\n\n Our threat researchers have come across a very particular DarkHotel attack known as Inexsmar, which\n\n appears to mark a significant departure from the APT group’s traditional modus operandi. This sample\n\n dates back to September 2016 and seems to be used in a campaign that targets political figures rather\n\n than the usual corporate research and development personnel, CEOs and other senior corporate officials.\n\n This attack uses a new payload delivery mechanism rather than the consacrated zero-day exploitation\n\n techniques, blending social engineering with a relatively complex Trojan to infect its selected pool of\n\n victims.\n\n An in-depth analysis of this Inexsmar campaign can be downloaded here: Inexsmar: An unusual\n\n DarkHotel campaign (2268 downloads)\n\nTags [DarkHotel](https://labs.bitdefender.com/tag/darkhotel/) [Inexsmar](https://labs.bitdefender.com/tag/inexsmar/) [targeted attack](https://labs.bitdefender.com/tag/targeted-attack/) [whitepaper](https://labs.bitdefender.com/tag/whitepaper/)\n\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Doing this\n\nis just plain sh*tty. Why make people type IoCs in by hand? Unless of course you intention it to sell them as a\n\npremium service. In which case, don't put them in the report at all.

I was looking into your research and I noticed that one can't copy and paste the indicators of compromise\n\nat the end of the paper and I thought I'd let you know. Maybe your PDF file is not compatible with other clients or\n\nmaybe your guy who laid this out forgot to check a box somewhere to export it as text, not as images. Anyway, can\n\nyou do me a solid and export this in a copy-pasta-friendly manner, cause it's really painful to spell a SHA1 out\".\n\nAnd I'd be like, \"Yeah, sure buddy, thanks for letting us know.
