We then continued our analysis into additional LookBack campaigns](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/lookback-forges-ahead-continued-targeting-united-states-utilities-sector-reveals)\nthat unfolded between August 21-29, 2019. These campaigns utilized malicious macro-laden documents in order to\ndeliver modular malware to targeted utility providers across the U.S. At the same time as the LookBack campaigns,\nProofpoint researchers identified a new, additional malware family named FlowCloud that was also being delivered\nto U.S. utilities providers.\n\nFlowCloud malware, like LookBack, gives attackers complete control over a compromised system. Its remote access\ntrojan (RAT) functionality includes the ability to access installed applications, the keyboard, mouse, screen, files,\nservices, and processes with the ability to exfiltrate information via command and control.\n\nWe analyzed phishing campaigns between July-November 2019 and have determined that both LookBack and\nFlowCloud malware can be attributed to a single threat actor we are calling TA410. This conclusion is based on the\nthreat actor’s use of shared attachment macros, malware installation techniques, and overlapping delivery\ninfrastructure.\n\nIn addition, our analysis found similarities between TA410 and TA429 (APT10) delivery tactics. Specifically, we have\nseen attachment macros that are common to both actors. TA410 campaigns detected in November 2019 included\nTA429 (APT10)-related infrastructure used in phishing attachment delivery macros. However, Proofpoint analysts\nbelieve that intentional reuse of well-publicized TA429 (APT10) techniques and infrastructure may be an attempt by\nthreat actors to create a false flag. For this reason, while research is ongoing, we do not attribute LookBack and\nFlowCloud campaigns to TA429 (APT10). Proofpoint currently tracks TA429 (APT10) independently of TA410\ncampaigns.\n\nFigure 1 below shows a timeline of the identified LookBack and FlowCloud campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 LookBack and FlowCloud Campaign Timeline_\n\n**Delivery**\n\nProofpoint researchers observed phishing campaigns beginning on July 10, 2019 that targeted utility providers\nacross the United States with portable executable (PE) attachments and used subject lines such as “PowerSafe\nenergy educational courses (30-days trial)”. These campaigns continued through September 2019.\n\nOur analysis of these phishing campaigns determined that the PE attachments delivered a modular malware which\nthe developers referred to in program data base (“PDB”) paths as “FlowCloud”. We therefore refer to these\ncampaigns as “FlowCloud” based on the malware family they delivered. It’s notable that these FlowCloud campaigns\nwere occurring at the same time as the LookBack campaigns that Proofpoint has previously documented. Both the\nFlowCloud and LookBack campaigns targeted utility providers in the United States. Both used training and\ncertification-themed lures. And both used threat actor-controlled domains for delivery. In some cases, both\nFlowCloud and LookBack campaigns targeted not only the same companies but also the same recipients.\n\nThe senders of the emails that delivered FlowCloud malware utilized threat actor-controlled domains for delivery\nwhich impersonated energy sector training services, as well as utilized subdomains which contained the word\n“engineer”.\n\nWe observed a distinct change in FlowCloud delivery tactics beginning with attacks carried out in November 2019.\nThe targeting of US utilities companies remained constant, but the threat actors shifted from PE attachments to\nmalicious macro laden Microsoft Word documents that closely resembled the same delivery and installation macros\nused in LookBack malware campaigns.\n\nAdditionally, in November threat actors began to utilize the sender domain asce[.]email to deliver these attachments.\nThis domain was first observed in June 2019 registered to the IP 103.253.41[.]75 which was used as a staging and\nreconnaissance IP in previous LookBack campaigns. On October 29, 2019, the domain resolved to the IP\n134.209.99[.]169 which also hosted several energy certification and education themed domains. A number of these\ndomains also shared an SSL certificate with delivery domains previously observed in the July and August 2019\nFlowCloud phishing campaigns. The data from this SSL Certificate has been displayed in Figure 2. This figure\ndemonstrates the actor’s use of a single SSL certificate for multiple energy and training themed domains. The actor\nlisted the domains that were signed by the certificate in the Alternative Names field allowing for the identification of\nadditional related infrastructure. A number of these domains were used in FlowCloud campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Passive Total SSL Certificate data for powersafetrainings[.]org and related energy themed domains._\n\nThe table below shows the TA410 staging IPs, when they were first observed, the registered domains associated\nwith them, and the malware delivered by emails originating from these domains.\n\n\n**IP** **First**\n**Observed**\n\n\n**Registered Domains** **Malware**\n**Delivered**\n\n\n103.253.41[.]75 06/23/2019 **_Delivery Domain:_**\n\nNceess[.]com\n\nGlobalenergycertification[.]com\n\n**_Registered Domain:_**\n\nNerc[.]email\n\nAsce[.]email\n\n\nLookBack\n\n\n-----\n\n134.209.99[.]169 10/29/2019 **_Delivery Domain:_**\n\nAsce[.]email\n\n**_Registered Domain:_**\n\nPowersafetraining[.]net\n\n**_Domains Related by SSL Certificate:_**\n\nmails.energysemi[.]com\n\npowersafetrainings[.]org\n\nwww.mails.energysemi[.]com\n\nwww.powersafetraining[.]net\nwww.powersafetrainings[.]org\n\n101.99.74[.]234 07/02/2019 **_Delivery Domain_**\n\nwww.powersafetrainings[.]org\n\n\nFlowCloud\n\nFlowCloud\n\n\nThe content of the emails in the November 2019 campaigns impersonated the American Society of Civil Engineers\nand masqueraded as the legitimate domain asce[.]org. The structure of this email is very similar to the LookBack\ndelivery emails constructed to impersonate the NCEES and Global Energy Certification in July 2019. Examples of\nthe emails are included in Figure 3 and Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 3 ASCE-themed phishing email delivering FlowCloud malware November 2019_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 NCEES-themed phishing email delivering LookBack malware July 2019_\n\n**Exploitation - Installation Macros**\n\nAs noted above, after an extended period of using PE attachments to deliver FlowCloud in campaigns, the threat\nactors behind FlowCloud switched to using Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros at the beginning of\nNovember 2019. The Word document attachments and macros delivering FlowCloud had key similarities with the\nWord document attachments and macros we identified that delivered LookBack in July and August 2019.\n\nIdentical to the methodology used with LookBack, the FlowCloud macro used privacy enhanced mail (“.pem”) files\nwhich were subsequently renamed to the text file “pense1.txt”. This file is next saved as a portable executable file\nnamed “gup.exe” and executed using a version of the certutil.exe tool named “Temptcm.tmp”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor comparison, Figure 5 November 2019 macro used to install FlowCloud malware shows the macro used to install\nFlowCloud while Figure 6 August 2019 macro used to install LookBack malware shows the macro used to install\nLookBack.\n\n_Figure 5 November 2019 macro used to install FlowCloud malware_\n\n_Figure 6 August 2019 macro used to install LookBack malware_\n\nThe “Exploitation” section in our blog LookBack Malware Targets the United States Utilities Sector with Phishing\nAttacks Impersonating Engineering Licensing Boards has a more in-depth explanation of this method used by\nLookBack. FlowCloud uses this same method exactly including identical macro concatenation code.\n\nWhile we found the ultimate execution method for both the LookBack Gup proxy tool and FlowCloud malware were\nthe same across both macro versions, we found that the FlowCloud macro introduced a new method for the delivery\nof the malware.\n\nThe earlier LookBack versions of the macro included the payload in numerous privacy enhanced email (“.pem”) files\nthat were dropped when the attachment file is executed by the user. The FlowCloud version of the macro utilized a\npreviously unobserved macro section to download the payload from a DropBox URL. Once the payload was\ndownloaded, a FlowCloud malware PE in the form of a .pem file was saved as the variable “Pense1.txt”. Figure 7\nFlowCloud Malware Macro delivery code shows the FlowCloud macro with the delivery section in question called\nout.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 FlowCloud Malware Macro delivery code_\n\nThe FlowCloud macro also contained a strange try… catch statement which initially attempts to download the\nFlowCloud payload from the DropBox URL as part of the try statement. However, if it was unable to retrieve the\npayload from that resource, a catch statement which was nearly identical to the try statement attempted to retrieve a\nmalware resource from the URL http://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt”.”. Figure 8 FlowCloud Malware Catch\nstatement macro code shows the catch statement in question.\n\n_Figure 8 FlowCloud Malware Catch statement macro code_\n\nThis try…catch sequence is significant because the URL in the catch statement and malware resource was\n[previously mentioned in a May 2019 blog by enSilo entitled “Uncovering New Activity by APT10”. The blog claims](https://blog.ensilo.com/uncovering-new-activity-by-apt10)\nthat this URL delivered a modified Quasar RAT payload which included the addition of SharpSploit, an opensource\npost-exploitation tool. When analyzed on the same date of FlowCloud campaign delivery this URL and resource was\nunavailable, while the DropBox URL successfully delivered the FlowCloud .pem file. While Proofpoint has not\nindependently verified these attribution claims made by other researchers regarding the referenced Quasar RAT\nsample, the use of this URL represents a previously undisclosed overlap with publicly reported indicators of\ncompromise attributed to TA429 (APT10). While on the surface this domain may imply links to TA429 (APT10), we\nhave identified several aberrations regarding the domain registration information and inactive nature of the URL and\nwill discuss them at length at length later in this blog.\n\n**FlowCloud Malware**\n\nOur analysis of the FlowCloud malware determined that it is a multi-stage payload comprised of a large code base\nwritten in C++. The code demonstrates a level of complexity including numerous components, extensive objectoriented programming, and use of legitimate and imitation QQ files for initial and later stage execution. We found\nfurther imitation of QQ components in several modules used throughout FlowCloud execution. The malware name\n“FlowCloud” was taken from distinctive PDB paths observed in numerous malware components. These values have\nbeen included in the IOCs section at the end of this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nFlowCloud malware is capable of RAT functionalities based on its available commands including accessing the\nclipboard, installed applications, keyboard, mouse, screen, files, services, and processes with the ability to exfiltrate\ninformation via command and control. Additionally, the malware variants analyzed have several distinct\ncharacteristics that indicate the malware may have been active in the threat landscape since at least July 2016.\n\nIn addition to components built to target updated Windows versions, FlowCloud samples have dropped a 32-bit\nmodule that was only compatible with Windows versions 6 (Windows Vista) and below. The dated nature of this\nbinary coupled with the extensible nature of the malware code suggests that the FlowCloud code base has been\n[under development for numerous years. Public reports around FlowCloud malware components and related](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/644821/computer-restart-every-1-2-minutes-and-bsod/)\ninstallation directory paths suggest that versions of this malware may have been observed in the wild as early as\nJuly 2016. Additionally, development of this malware around legitimate QQ files and the identification of malware\nsamples uploaded to VirusTotal from Japan in December 2018 and earlier this year from Taiwan indicate that the\nmalware may have been active for some time in Asia prior to its appearance targeting the US utilities sector.\n\nFigure 9 Flowchart of FlowCloud Loader Functionality below outlines FlowCloud’s loader functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Flowchart of FlowCloud Loader Functionality_\n\nThe malware begins with the execution of Gup.exe by the malicious macro which in turn executes the file\nEhStorAuthn.exe.\nEhStorAuthn.exe extracts the subsequent payload file components and installs them to the directory\nC:\\Windows\\Media\\SystemPCAXD\\ado\\fc. This file also sets registry key values that store the keylogger\ndrivers and the malware configuration as the value “KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\\n<2-4>”.\n\n\n-----\n\nEhStorAuthn.exe is a legitimate portable executable file used by QQ with the initial name QQSetupEx.exe. This\nfile is used to load the file dlcore.dll as part of its natural downloader routine.\nDlcore.dll is a DLL crafted by the threat actors that functions as a shellcode injector pulling the shellcode from a\nfile named rebare.dat. This file imitates a legitimate QQ component.\nWhen the shellcode within rebare.dat is executed it in turn executes a RAT installer file named rescure.dat.\nRescure.dat is an XOR encrypted DLL file that installs the RAT based application responsor.dat which installs\nthe keylogger driver and manages the RAT functionality.\nResponsor.dat unpacks several modules (rescure86.dat or rescure64.dat) to the registry %TEMP%\\{0d47c9bc7b04-4d81-9ad8-b2e00681de8e}\" and installs the unpacked file as a service named “FSFilter Activity Monitor”\nor “FltMgr”.\nFinally, Responsor.dat starts the RAT when the rescure.dat function “startModule” is called.\nSeveral legitimate Microsoft Windows files were also used by the malware for thread injection.\nEhStorAuthn_shadow.exe (hhw.exe) a Microsoft HTML Help Workshop file was used as a placeholder for\nthread injection.\nHha.dll is a component of Microsoft HTML Help Workshop and is required to run EhStorAuthn_shadow.exe.\n\nThe malware stores its configuration in the registry alongside drivers utilized by the malware’s keylogger\ncomponents. Several additional distinct registry keys are generated which indicate the malware’s current execution\nstage on the host. Some of these keys are included in the table below.\n\n\n**Registry Key** **Originating**\n**Component**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\2 Gup.exe 32bit Driver, Keylogger\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\3 Gup.exe 64bit Driver, Keylogger\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\4 Gup.exe RAT config\n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\{2DB80286-178448b5-A751-B6ED1F490303}\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\{804423C2-F4904ac3-BFA5-13DEDE63A71A}\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\{A5124AF5-DF2349bf-B0ED-A18ED3DEA027}\n\n**FlowCloud Configuration**\n\n\nDlcore.dll Execution Stage Executing\ndlcore.dll\n\nrescure.dat Execution Stage Install\nkeylogger driver\n\nrescure.dat Execution Stage\n\nRAT fully installed.\n\n\nThe FlowCloud loader component EhStorAuthn.exe stores the malware configuration in the registry early in the\ninstallation chain and is represented in the table above. The Registry data is composed of multiple encrypted\nheaders (using XORs and RORs) and data is encrypted using a modified (or broken) AES algorithm. The plaintext\ndata is compressed with ZLIB and serialized using Google’s Protocol Buffers. Figure 10 shows an example of a\nconfiguration as displayed by FlowCloud’s debug logging:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 Example of a configuration as displayed by debug logging_\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nFlowCloud malware handles configuration updates, file exfiltration, and commands as independent threads utilizing a\ncustom binary C2 protocol. We identified these independent threads as part of an extensive command handling\nfunctionality with distinct command managers existing for each command. The sample we analyzed utilized port\n55555 for file exfiltration and port 55556 for all other data. We identified FlowCloud communication with the IP\n188.131.233[.]27. The requests and responses are composed of multiple encrypted headers (using XORs and\nRORs) and TEA encrypted data using a key generation scheme involving a hardcoded string of random characters\nand MD5 hashing. The plaintext data is compressed using ZLIB and serialized using Google’s Protocol Buffers. An\nexample parsing of an initial beacon is demonstrated in Figure 11 Example of FlowCloud parsing an initial C2\nbeacon:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Example of FlowCloud parsing an initial C2 beacon_\n\n**Comparing Public TA429 (APT10) Indicators with TA410 Campaigns**\n\n[Publications by FireEye and EnSilo regarding TA429 (APT10) campaigns contain indicators that later appeared in](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/09/apt10-targeting-japanese-corporations-using-updated-ttps.html)\nTA410 campaigns. In our retrospective analysis of that research, we determined that TA429 (APT10) used phishing\nmacros that were later seen being used by LookBack and FlowCloud malware. Additionally, we identified the Quasar\nRAT delivery URL hxxp://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt used by FlowCloud macros in November, which was\npublished in the enSilo report prior to observable weaponization for TA410 campaigns.\n\nInterestingly, the compilation date of several LookBack malware modules used in July 2019 were September 14,\n2018. This includes the SodomMain and SodomNormal modules covered in previous Proofpoint blogs on LookBack\nmalware. That date is just one day after FireEye released their initial analysis of similar TA429 (APT10) macros\n\n\n-----\n\nutilized in Japan on September 13, 2018.\n\nWhile LookBack malware samples were not observed in the wild until June 2019, this September 2018 compilation\ndate demonstrates a large lag time between compilation and delivery. This possibly suggests manipulation of\ncompilation times by threat actors but has not been conclusively determined.\n\nThe first identified server installation by TA410 on actor-controlled infrastructure occurred in December 2018. Most of\nthe domain registration (weaponization) for LookBack and FlowCloud campaigns began in May and June 2019\nrespectively. These events were after FireEye’s initial publication in September 2018.\n\nAdditionally, enSilo’s publication on potentially TA429 (APT10) related Quasar RAT samples was published on May\n24, 2019. It was not until the second week of November 2019 when the inactive URL was incorporated into a\nphishing macro as part of a FlowCloud campaign targeting US utilities. WHOIS records and passive DNS information\nfor ffca.caibi379[.]com indicate that the registrant email and address fields for the domain were updated on June 7,\n2019. The A record for the domain was updated on September 9, 2019 at which time it resolved to the IP\n34.80.27[.]200 contained within an ASN owned by Google. For the prior eight months beginning on January 2, 2019\nand encompassing the period of activity discussed by enSilo, the domain was hosted on several IP’s in an ASN\nowned by APNIC Hostmaster. The shift away from IP infrastructure owned by APNIC represents a departure in\nthreat actor infrastructure hosting tactics well after the publication by enSilo and within the weaponization period for\nTA410’s campaign targeting US utilities. While this research is not conclusive, it demonstrates that all observed\nTA429 (APT10) similarities and indicators of compromise were available publicly prior to the start of TA410\ncampaigns. Therefore, while not conclusive from current analysis, the possibility remains that these overlaps\nrepresent false flag activity by the TA410 threat actor. Based on this analysis Proofpoint analysts track TA410 as a\ndistinct threat actor from TA429 (APT10) at this time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe convergence of LookBack and FlowCloud malware campaigns in November 2019 demonstrates the capabilities\nof TA410 actors to distinctly utilize multiple tools as part of a single ongoing campaign against US utilities providers.\nBoth malware families demonstrate a level of sophistication in their conception and development while the extensible\ncode base of FlowCloud malware suggests that this group may have been operating as early as 2016. TA410\noperators demonstrate a willingness to dynamically evolve phishing tactics to increase the effectiveness of their\ncampaigns and a keen eye towards plausible social engineering within a very select targeted sector. It remains\nunclear if the nature of the tactics and indicators that are shared with TA429 (APT10) were developed by this group\nor culled from readily available technical reporting that pre-dated these campaigns. The possibility remains that\nthese overlaps represent intentional false flag efforts to cloak the identity of these perpetrators while they targeted a\ncritical and geo-politically sensitive sector of energy providers in the US. Regardless of the actor’s intention, TA410\nhas established itself as a motivated actor with mature toolsets carrying out long term campaigns against highly\nimportant and geographically concentrated target sets.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nfaa80e0692ba120e38924ccd46f6be3c25b8edf7cddaa8960fe9ea632dc4a045 SHA256 PE Attachment - our\ninfrastructure offer\nannÃ¢Â€Â®cod.exe\n\nb7960d1f40b727bbea18a0e5c62bafcb54c9ec73be3e69e787b7ddafd2aae364 SHA256 PE Attachment powersafe courses\nannÃ¢Â€Â®cod.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n26eb8a1f0bdde626601d039ea0f2c92a7921152371bafe5e811c6a1831f071ce SHA256 FlowCloud MS Word\nMacro Attachment personal invitation.doc\n\ncd8f877c9a1c31179b633fd74bd5050e4d48eda29244230348c6f84878d0c33c SHA256 Dropped Files - Cert.pem\n\ne4ad5d3213425c58778d8a0244df4cd99c748f58852d8ac71b46326efd5b3220 SHA256 Dropped Files pense1.txt\n\n589229e2bd93100049909edf9825dce24ff963a0c465d969027db34e2eb878b4 SHA256 Dropped Files Temptcm.tmp\n\n1334c742f2aec7e8412d76ba228b99935a49dc96a1e8e1f3446d9f61247ae47e SHA256 Dropped Files EhStorAuthn.exe\n\nde30929ef958211f9315e27a7aa45ef061726a76990ddc6b9d9f189b9fbdd45a SHA256 Dropped Files - dlcore.dll\n\n0b013ccd9e10d7589994629aed18ffe2388cbd745b5b28ab39c07835295a1ca9 SHA256 Dropped Files rebare.dat\n\n479954b9e7d5c5f7086a2a1ff1dba99de2eab2e1b1bc75ad8f3b211088eb4ee9 SHA256 Dropped Files rescure.dat\n\nd5191327a984fab990bfb0e811688e65e9aaa751c3d93fa92487e8a95cb2eea8 SHA256 Dropped Files responsor.dat\n\n0701cc7eb1af616294e90cbb35c99fa2b29d2aada9fcbdcdaf578b3fcf9b56c7 SHA256 Dropped Files EhStorAuthn_shadow.exe\n\n27f5df1d35744cf283702fce384ce8cfb2f240bae5d725335ca1b90d6128bd40 SHA256 Dropped Files rescure64.dat\n\n13e761f459c87c921dfb985cbc6489060eb86b4200c4dd99692d6936de8df5ba SHA256 Dropped Files rescure86.dat\n\n2481fd08abac0bfefe8d8b1fa3beb70f8f9424a1601aa08e195c0c14e1547c27 SHA256 Dropped Files - hha.dll\n\n188.131.233[.]27 IP C&C IP\n\n118.25.97[.]43 IP Sender IP\n\n34.80.27[.]200 IP Sender IP\n\n134.209.99[.]169 IP Staging IP\n\n101.99.74[.]234 IP Staging IP\n\nAsce[.]email Domain Phishing Domain\n\n\n-----\n\npowersafetrainings[.]org Domain Phishing Domain\n\nmails.daveengineer[.]com Domain Phishing Domain\n\npowersafetraining[.]net Domain Related Infrastructure\n\nmails.energysemi[.]com Domain Related Infrastructure\n\nwww.mails.energysemi[.]com Domain Related Infrastructure\n\nwww.powersafetraining[.]net Domain Related Infrastructure\n\nwww.powersafetrainings[.]org Domain Related Infrastructure\n\nffca.caibi379[.]com Domain Macro Domain\n\nhttp://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt URL FlowCloud Macro\nDelivery URL Inactive\n\nhttps://www.dropbox[.]com:443/s/ddgifm4ityqwx60/Cert.pem?dl=1 URL FlowCloud Macro\nDelivery URL\n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\2 Registry\nKey\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\3 Registry\nKey\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\4 Registry\nKey\n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\{2DB80286-1784-48b5-A751B6ED1F490303}\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\{804423C2-F490-4ac3-BFA513DEDE63A71A}\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\{A5124AF5-DF23-49bf-B0EDA18ED3DEA027}\n\n\nRegistry\nKey\n\nRegistry\nKey\n\nRegistry\nKey\n\n\nFlowCloud Registry Key\n\nFlowCloud Registry Key\n\nFlowCloud Registry Key\n\nFlowCloud Registry Key\n\nFlowCloud Registry Key\n\nFlowCloud Registry Key\n\nFlowCloud PDB Path\n\nFlowCloud PDB Path\n\nFlowCloud PDB Path\n\n\nG:\\FlowCloud\\trunk\\Dev\\src\\fcClient\\Release\\QQSetupEx_func.pdb File\nPath\n\ng:\\FlowCloud\\trunk\\Dev\\src\\fcClient\\Release\\fcClientDll.pdb File\nPath\n\nF:\\FlowCloud\\trunk\\Dev\\src\\fcClient\\kmspy\\Driver\\Release\\Driver.pdb File\nPath\n\n\n-----\n\nF:\\FlowCloud\\trunk\\Dev\\src\\fcClient\\kmspy\\Driver\\x64\\Release\\Driver.pdb File\nPath\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/SNORT Signatures**\n\n2837783 ETPRO TROJAN Win32/LookBack CnC Activity\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\nFlowCloud PDB Path\n\n\n-----",
