For more_\n_information on Russian malicious cyber activity, refer to_ _[us-cert.cisa.gov/Russia.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/russia)_\n\n## Overview\n\nThe National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) is aware of\npublic reports from ESET and Dragos outlining a new, highly capable Industrial Controls\nSystems (ICS) attack platform that was reportedly used in 2016 against critical infrastructure\n[in Ukraine. As reported by ESET and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf) [Dragos, the CrashOverride malware is an extensible](https://www.dragos.com/blog/crashoverride/)\nplatform that could be used to target critical infrastructure sectors. NCCIC is working with its\npartners to validate the ESET and Dragos analysis, and develop a better understanding of\nthe risk this new malware poses to U.S. critical infrastructure.\n\nAlthough this activity is still under investigation, NCCIC is sharing this report to provide\norganizations with detection and mitigation recommendations to help prevent future\ncompromises within their critical infrastructure networks. NCCIC continues to work with\ninteragency and international partners on this activity and will provide updates as information\nbecomes available.\n\nFor a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see:\n\n[IOCs (.csv)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA-17-163A_IOCs.csv)\n[IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA-17-163A_IOCs.stix.XML)\n\nTo report activity related to this Alert, please contact NCCIC at\n[NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 1-888-282-0870.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov)\n\n**Risk Evaluation**\n\nNCCIC Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS) Rating Priority Level (Color)\n\nYellow (Medium)\n\n\n-----\n\nA medium priority incident may affect public health or safety, national security, economic\nsecurity, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.\n\n**Details**\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest this malware has affected U.S. critical infrastructure.\nHowever, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described as part of the\nCrashOverride malware could be modified to target U.S. critical information networks and\nsystems.\n\n## Description\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nCrashOverride malware represents a scalable, capable platform. The modules and\ncapabilities publically reported appear to focus on organizations using ICS protocols IEC101,\nIEC104, and IEC61850, which are more commonly used outside the United States in electric\npower control systems. The platform fundamentally abuses the functionality of a targeted\nICS system’s legitimate control system to achieve its intended effect. While the known\ncapabilities do not appear to be U.S.-focused, it is important to recognize that the general\nTTPs used in CrashOverride could be leveraged with modified technical implementations to\naffect U.S.-based critical infrastructure. With further modification, CrashOverride or similar\nmalware could have implications beyond electric power so all critical infrastructure\norganizations should be evaluating their systems to susceptibilities in the TTPs outlined. The\nmalware has several reported capabilities:\n\n1. Issues valid commands directly to remote terminal units (RTUs) over ICS protocols. As\n\nreported by Dragos, one such command sequence toggles circuit breakers in a rapid\nopen-close-open-close pattern. This could create conditions where individual utilities\nmay island from infected parties, potentially resulting in a degradation of grid reliability.\n2. Denies service to local serial COM ports on windows devices, therefore preventing\n\nlegitimate communications with field equipment over serial from the affected device.\n3. Scans and maps ICS environment using a variety of protocols, including Open Platform\n\nCommunications (OPC). This significantly improves the payload’s probability of\nsuccess.\n4. Could exploit Siemens relay denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, leading to a shutdown\n\nof the relay. In this instance, the relay would need to be manually reset to restore\nfunctionality.\n5. Includes a wiper module in the platform that renders windows systems inert, requiring a\n\nrebuild or backup restoration.\n\n**Detection**\n\n\n-----\n\nAs CrashOverride is a second stage malware capability and has the ability to operate\nindependent of initial C2, traditional methods of detection may not be sufficient to detect\ninfections prior to the malware executing. As a result, organizations are encouraged to\nimplement behavioral analysis techniques to attempt to identify precursor activity to\nCrashOverride. As additional information becomes available on stage one infection vectors\nand TTPs, this alert will be updated.\n\nNCCIC is providing a compilation of IOCs (see links above) from a variety of sources to aid\nin the detection of this malware. The sources provided do not constitute an exhaustive list\nand the U.S. Government does not endorse or support any particular product or vendor’s\ninformation referenced in this report. However, NCCIC has included this data to ensure wide\ndistribution of the most comprehensive information available and will provide updates as\nwarranted.\n\nSignatures\n```\nimport “pe”\nimport “hash”\nrule dragos_crashoverride_exporting_dlls\n{\nmeta:\ndescription = “CRASHOVERRIDE v1 Suspicious Export”\nauthor = “Dragos Inc”\ncondition:\npe.exports(“Crash”) & pe.characteristics\n}\nrule dragos_crashoverride_suspcious\n{\nmeta:\ndescription = “CRASHOVERRIDE v1 Wiper”\nauthor = “Dragos Inc”\nstrings:\n$s0 = “SYS_BASCON.COM” fullword nocase wide\n$s1 = “.pcmp” fullword nocase wide\n$s2 = “.pcmi” fullword nocase wide\n$s3 = “.pcmt” fullword nocase wide\n$s4 = “.cin” fullword nocase wide\ncondition:\npe.exports(“Crash”) and any of ($s*)\n}\nrule dragos_crashoverride_name_search {\nmeta:\ndescription = “CRASHOVERRIDE v1 Suspicious Strings and Export”\nauthor = “Dragos Inc”\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nstrings:\n$s0 = “101.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s1 = “Crash101.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s2 = “104.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s3 = “Crash104.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s4 = “61850.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s5 = “Crash61850.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s6 = “OPCClientDemo.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s7 = “OPC” fullword nocase wide\n$s8 = “CrashOPCClientDemo.dll” fullword nocase wide\n$s9 = “D2MultiCommService.exe” fullword nocase wide\n$s10 = “CrashD2MultiCommService.exe” fullword nocase wide\n$s11 = “61850.exe” fullword nocase wide\n$s12 = “OPC.exe” fullword nocase wide\n$s13 = “haslo.exe” fullword nocase wide\n$s14 = “haslo.dat” fullword nocase wide\ncondition:\nany of ($s*) and pe.exports(“Crash”)\n}\nrule dragos_crashoverride_hashes {\nmeta:\ndescription = “CRASHOVERRIDE Malware Hashes”\nauthor = “Dragos Inc”\ncondition:\nfilesize < 1MB and\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “f6c21f8189ced6ae150f9ef2e82a3a57843b587d” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “cccce62996d578b984984426a024d9b250237533” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “8e39eca1e48240c01ee570631ae8f0c9a9637187” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “2cb8230281b86fa944d3043ae906016c8b5984d9” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “79ca89711cdaedb16b0ccccfdcfbd6aa7e57120a” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “94488f214b165512d2fc0438a581f5c9e3bd4d4c” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “5a5fafbc3fec8d36fd57b075ebf34119ba3bff04” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “b92149f046f00bb69de329b8457d32c24726ee00” or\nhash.sha1(0, filesize) == “b335163e6eb854df5e08e85026b2c3518891eda8”\n}\nrule dragos_crashoverride_moduleStrings {\nmeta:\ndescription = “IEC-104 Interaction Module Program Strings”\nauthor = “Dragos Inc”\nstrings:\n$s1 = “IEC-104 client: ip=%s; port=%s; ASDU=%u” nocase wide ascii\n$s2 = “ MSTR ->> SLV” nocase wide ascii\n$s3 = “ MSTR <<- SLV” nocase wide ascii\n$s4 = “Unknown APDU format !!!” nocase wide ascii\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n$s5 = iec104.log nocase wide ascii\ncondition:\nany of ($s*)\n}\nrule dragos_crashoverride_configReader\n{\nmeta:\ndescription = “CRASHOVERRIDE v1 Config File Parsing”\nauthor = “Dragos Inc”\nstrings:\n$s0 = { 68 e8 ??

Possible impacts include:\n\ntemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\n\n\n-----\n\ndisruption to regular operations,\nfinancial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and\npotential harm to an organization’s reputation.\n\n## Solution\n\nProperly implemented defensive techniques and common cyber hygiene practices increase\nthe complexity of barriers that adversaries must overcome to gain unauthorized access to\ncritical information networks and systems. In addition, detection and prevention mechanisms\ncan expose malicious network activity, enabling organizations to contain and respond to\nintrusions more rapidly. There is no set of defensive techniques or programs that will\ncompletely avert all attacks however, layered cybersecurity defenses will aid in reducing an\norganization’s attack surface and will increase the likelihood of detection. This layered\nmitigation approach is known as defense-in-depth.\n\nNCCIC has based its mitigations and recommendations on its analysis of the public reporting\nof this malware and will be provide updates as more information becomes available.\n\nCritical infrastructure companies should ensure that they are following best practices, which\n[are outlined in the Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems document](http://10.10.0.46/sites/default/files/documents/Seven%20Steps%20to%20Effectively%20Defend%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf)\nproduced jointly by DHS, NSA, and FBI.\n\n**Application Whitelisting**\n\nApplication whitelisting (AWL) can detect and prevent attempted execution of malware\nuploaded by adversaries. Application whitelisting hardens operating systems and prevents\nthe execution of unauthorized software. The static nature of some systems, such as\ndatabase servers and human-machine interface (HMI) computers make these ideal\ncandidates to run AWL. NCCIC encourages operators to work with their vendors to baseline\nand calibrate AWL deployments.\n\nOperators may choose to implement directory whitelisting rather than trying to list every\npossible permutation of applications in an environment. Operators may implement\napplication or application directory whitelisting through Microsoft Software Restriction Policy\n(SRP), AppLocker, or similar application whitelisting software. Safe defaults allow\napplications to run from PROGRAMFILES, PROGRAMFILES(X86), SYSTEM32, and any\nICS software folders. All other locations should be disallowed unless an exception is granted.\n\n**Manage Authentication and Authorization**\n\nThis malware exploits the lack of authentication and authorization in common ICS protocols\nto issue unauthorized commands to field devices. Asset owners/operators should implement\nauthentication and authorization protocols to ensure field devices verify the authenticity of\ncommands before they are actioned. In some instances, legacy hardware may not be\n\n\n-----\n\ncapable of implementing these protections. In these cases, asset owners can either leverage\nICS firewalls to do stateful inspection and authentication of commands, or upgrade their\ncontrol field devices.\n\nAdversaries are increasingly focused on gaining control of legitimate credentials, especially\nthose associated with highly privileged accounts. Compromising these credentials allows\nadversaries to masquerade as legitimate users, leaving less evidence of compromise than\nmore traditional attack options (i.e., exploiting vulnerabilities or uploading malware). For this\nreason, operators should implement multi-factor authentication where possible and reduce\nprivileges to only those needed for a user’s duties. If passwords are necessary, operators\nshould implement secure password policies, stressing length over complexity. For all\naccounts, including system and non-interactive accounts, operators should ensure\ncredentials are unique, and changed, at a minimum, every 90 days.\n\nNCCIC also recommends that operators require separate credentials for corporate and\ncontrol network zones and store them in separate trust stores. Operators should never share\nActive Directory, RSA ACE servers, or other trust stores between corporate and control\nnetworks. Specifically, operators should:\n\nDecrease a threat actor’s ability to access key network resources by implementing the\nprinciple of least privilege;\nLimit the ability of a local administrator account to login from a local interactive session\n(e.g., “Deny access to this computer from the network”) and prevent access via a\nremote desktop protocol session;\nRemove unnecessary accounts, groups, and restrict root access;\nControl and limit local administration; and\nMake use of the Protected Users Active Directory group in Windows Domains to further\nsecure privileged user accounts against pass-the-hash attacks.\n\n**Handling Destructive Malware**\n\nDestructive malware continues to be a threat to both critical infrastructure and business\nsystems. NCCIC encourages organizations to review the ICS-CERT destructive malware\nwhite paper for detailed mitigation guidance. It is important for organizations to maintain\nbackups of key data, systems, and configurations such as:\n\nServer gold images,\nICS Workstation gold configurations,\nEngineering workstation images,\nPLC/RTU configurations,\nPasswords and configuration information, and\nOffline copies of install media for operating systems and control applications.\n\n**Ensure Proper Configuration/Patch Management**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdversaries often target unpatched systems. A configuration/patch management program\ncentered on the safe importation and implementation of trusted patches will help render\ncontrol systems more secure.\n\nSuch a program will start with an accurate baseline and asset inventory to track what\npatches are needed. The program will prioritize patching and configuration management of\n“PC-architecture” machines used in HMI, database server, and engineering workstation\nroles, as current adversaries have significant cyber capabilities against these systems.\nInfected laptops are a significant malware vector. Such a program will limit the connection of\nexternal laptops to the control network and ideally supply vendors with known-good company\nlaptops. The program will also encourage initial installation of any updates onto a test system\nthat includes malware detection features before the updates are installed on operational\nsystems.\n\nNCCIC recommends that operators:\n\nUse best practices when downloading software and patches destined for their control\nnetwork;\nTake measures to avoid watering hole attacks;\nUse a web Domain Name System (DNS) reputation system;\nObtain and apply updates from authenticated vendor sites;\nValidate the authenticity of downloads;\nInsist that vendors digitally sign updates, and/or publish hashes via an out-of-bound\ncommunications path, and only use this path to authenticate;\nNever load updates from unverified sources; and\nReduce your attack surface area.\n\nTo the greatest extent possible, NCCIC recommends that operators:\n\nIsolate ICS networks from any untrusted networks, especially the Internet;\nLock down all unused ports;\nTurn off all unused services; and\nOnly allow real-time connectivity to external networks if there is a defined business\nrequirement or control function.\n\nIf one-way communication can accomplish a task, operators should use optical\nseparation (“data diode”).\nIf bidirectional communication is necessary, operators should use a single open\nport over a restricted network path.\n\n**Build a Defendable Environment**\n\nBuilding a defendable environment will help limit the impact from network perimeter\nbreaches. NCCIC recommends operators segment networks into logical enclaves and\nrestrict host-to-host communications paths. This can prevent adversaries from expanding\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir access, while allowing the normal system communications to continue operating.\nEnclaving limits possible damage, as threat actors cannot use compromised systems to\nreach and contaminate systems in other enclaves. Containment provided by enclaving also\nmakes incident cleanup significantly less costly.\n\nIf one-way data transfer from a secure zone to a less secure zone is required, operators\nshould consider using approved removable media instead of a network connection. If realtime data transfer is required, operators should consider using optical separation\ntechnologies. This allows replication of data without placing the control system at risk.\n\nAdditional details on effective strategies for building a defendable ICS network can be found\nin the [ICS-CERT Defense-in-Depth Recommended Practice.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/Abstract-Defense-Depth-RP)\n\n**Implement Secure Remote Access**\n\nSome adversaries are effective at gaining remote access into control systems, finding\nobscure access vectors, even “hidden back doors” intentionally created by system operators.\nOperators should remove such accesses wherever possible, especially modems, as these\nare fundamentally insecure.\n\nOperators should:\n\nLimit any accesses that remain;\nWhere possible, implement “monitoring only” access enforced by data diodes, and not\nrely on “read only” access enforced by software configurations or permissions;\nNot allow remote persistent vendor connections into the control network;\nRequire any remote access to be operator controlled, time limited, and procedurally\nsimilar to “lock out, tag out”;\nUse the same remote access paths for vendor and employee connections; do not allow\ndouble standards; and\nUse two-factor authentication if possible, avoiding schemes where both tokens are\nsimilar and can be easily stolen (e.g., password and soft certificate).\n\n**Monitor and Respond**\n\nDefending a network against modern threats requires actively monitoring for adversarial\npenetration and quickly executing a prepared response. Operators should:\n\nConsider establishing monitoring programs in the following key places: at the Internet\nboundary; at the business to Control DMZ boundary; at the Control DMZ to control LAN\nboundary; and inside the Control LAN;\nWatch IP traffic on ICS boundaries for abnormal or suspicious communications;\nMonitor IP traffic within the control network for malicious connections or content;\n\n\n-----\n\nUse host-based products to detect malicious software and attack attempts;\n\nUse login analysis (e.g., time and place) to detect stolen credential usage or\nimproper access, verifying all anomalies with quick phone calls;\nWatch account and user administration actions to detect access control\nmanipulation;\nHave a response plan for when adversarial activity is detected; and\n\nSuch a plan may include disconnecting all Internet connections, running a\nproperly scoped search for malware, disabling affected user accounts, isolating\nsuspect systems, and immediately resetting 100 percent of passwords.\nSuch a plan may also define escalation triggers and actions, including incident\nresponse, investigation, and public affairs activities.\nHave a restoration plan, including “gold disks” ready to restore systems to known good\nstates.\n\n## References\n\n Revisions\n\nJune 12, 2017: Initial Release\n\nJune 13, 2017: Updated IOCs (both STIX and CSV formats)\n\nJuly 7, 2017: Updated IOCs (both STIX and CSV formats)\n\nJuly 21, 2017: Corrected typographical error\n\nJuly 24, 2017: Corrected links to downloadable IOC files\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-163A)\n\n\n-----",
