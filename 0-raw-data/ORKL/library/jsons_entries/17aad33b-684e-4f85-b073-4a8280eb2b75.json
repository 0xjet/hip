We\nreported this new exploit to Microsoft in February and after confirmation that it is indeed a zero-day, it received the\n[designation CVE-2021-28310. Microsoft released a patch to this vulnerability as a part of its April security updates.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28310)\n\nWe believe this exploit is used in the wild, potentially by several threat actors. It is an escalation of privilege (EoP) exploit\nthat is likely used together with other browser exploits to escape sandboxes or get system privileges for further access.\nUnfortunately, we weren’t able to capture a full chain, so we don’t know if the exploit is used with another browser zero-day,\nor coupled with known, patched vulnerabilities.\n\nThe exploit was initially identified by our advanced exploit prevention technology and related detection records. In fact, over\nthe past few years, we have built a multitude of exploit protection technologies into our products that have detected several\nzero-days, proving their effectiveness time and again. We will continue to improve defenses for our users by enhancing\ntechnologies and working with third-party vendors to patch vulnerabilities, making the internet more secure for everyone. In\nthis blog we provide a technical analysis of the vulnerability and how the bad guys exploited it. More information about\nBITTER APT and IOCs are available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service. Contact:\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Technical details\n\nCVE-2021-28310 is an out-of-bounds (OOB) write vulnerability in dwmcore.dll, which is part of Desktop Window Manager\n(dwm.exe). Due to the lack of bounds checking, attackers are able to create a situation that allows them to write controlled\n[data at a controlled offset using DirectComposition API. DirectComposition is a Windows component that was introduced in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directcomp/directcomposition-portal)\nWindows 8 to enable bitmap composition with transforms, effects and animations, with support for bitmaps of different\n[sources (GDI, DirectX, etc.). We’ve already published a blogpost about in-the-wild zero-days abusing DirectComposition](https://securelist.com/cve-2019-0797-zero-day-vulnerability/89885/)\nAPI. DirectComposition API is implemented by the win32kbase.sys driver and the names of all related syscalls start with\nthe string “NtDComposition”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_DirectComposition syscalls in the win32kbase.sys driver_**\n\nFor exploitation only three syscalls are required: NtDCompositionCreateChannel,\nNtDCompositionProcessChannelBatchBuffer and NtDCompositionCommitChannel. The NtDCompositionCreateChannel\nsyscall initiates a channel that can be used together with the NtDCompositionProcessChannelBatchBuffer syscall to send\nmultiple DirectComposition commands in one go for processing by the kernel in a batch mode. For this to work, commands\nneed to be written sequentially in a special buffer mapped by NtDCompositionCreateChannel syscall. Each command has\nits own format with a variable length and list of parameters.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n\nenum DCOMPOSITION_COMMAND_ID\n\n{\n\nProcessCommandBufferIterator,\n\nCreateResource,\n\nOpenSharedResource,\n\nReleaseResource,\n\nGetAnimationTime,\n\nCapturePointer,\n\nOpenSharedResourceHandle,\n\nSetResourceCallbackId,\n\nSetResourceIntegerProperty,\n\nSetResourceFloatProperty,\n\nSetResourceHandleProperty,\n\nSetResourceHandleArrayProperty,\n\nSetResourceBufferProperty,\n\nSetResourceReferenceProperty,\n\nSetResourceReferenceArrayProperty,\n\nSetResourceAnimationProperty,\n\nSetResourceDeletedNotificationTag,\n\nAddVisualChild,\n\nRedirectMouseToHwnd,\n\nSetVisualInputSink,\n\nRemoveVisualChild\n\n};\n\n\n**_List of command IDs supported by the function_**\n**_DirectComposition::CApplicationChannel::ProcessCommandBufferIterator_**\n\nWhile these commands are processed by the kernel, they are also serialized into another format and passed by the Local\nProcedure Call (LPC) protocol to the Desktop Window Manager (dwm.exe) process for rendering to the screen. This\nprocedure could be initiated by the third syscall – NtDCompositionCommitChannel.\n\nTo trigger the vulnerability the discovered exploit uses three types of commands: CreateResource, ReleaseResource and\nSetResourceBufferProperty.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n\nvoid CreateResourceCmd(int resourceId)\n\n{\n\nDWORD *buf = (DWORD *)((PUCHAR)pMappedAddress + BatchLength);\n\n*buf = CreateResource;\n\nbuf[1] = resourceId;\n\nbuf[2] = PropertySet; // MIL_RESOURCE_TYPE\n\nbuf[3] = FALSE;\n\nBatchLength += 16;\n\n}\n\nvoid ReleaseResourceCmd(int resourceId)\n\n{\n\nDWORD *buf = (DWORD *)((PUCHAR)pMappedAddress + BatchLength);\n\n*buf = ReleaseResource;\n\nbuf[1] = resourceId;\n\nBatchLength += 8;\n\n}\n\nvoid SetPropertyCmd(int resourceId, bool update, int propertyId, int storageOffset, int hidword, int lodword)\n\n{\n\nDWORD *buf = (DWORD *)((PUCHAR)pMappedAddress + BatchLength);\n\n*buf = SetResourceBufferProperty;\n\nbuf[1] = resourceId;\n\nbuf[2] = update;\n\nbuf[3] = 20;\n\nbuf[4] = propertyId;\n\nbuf[5] = storageOffset;\n\nbuf[6] = _D2DVector2; // DCOMPOSITION_EXPRESSION_TYPE\n\nbuf[7] = hidword;\n\nbuf[8] = lodword;\n\nBatchLength += 36;\n\n}\n\n\n**_Format of commands used in exploitation_**\n\nLet’s take a look at the function CPropertySet::ProcessSetPropertyValue in dwmcore.dll.

The first\nthing that catches the eye is the way the new property is added in the CPropertySet::AddProperty<D2DVector2>(…)\nfunction. You can see that it adds a new property to the resource, but it only checks if the propertyId and storageOffset of a\nnew property are equal to the provided values after the new property is added, and returns an error if that’s not the case.\nChecking something after a job is done is bad coding practice and can result in vulnerabilities. However, a real issue can\nbe found in the CPropertySet::UpdateProperty<D2DVector2>(…) function. No check takes place that will ensure if the\nprovided propertyId is less than the count of properties added to the resource. As a result, an attacker can use this function\nto perform an OOB write past the propertiesData buffer if it manages to bypass two additional checks for data inside the\nproperties array.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n(1) storageOffset == this->properties[propertyId]->offset & 0x1FFFFFFF\n\n(2) this->properties[propertyId]->type == type\n\n\n**_Conditions which need to be met for exploitation in dwmcore.dll_**\n\nThese checks could be bypassed if an attacker is able to allocate and release objects in the dwm.exe process to groom\nheap into the desired state and spray memory at specific locations with fake properties. The discovered exploit manages to\ndo this using the CreateResource, ReleaseResource and SetResourceBufferProperty commands.\n\nAt the time of writing, we still hadn’t analyzed the updated binaries that are fixing this vulnerability, but to exclude the\npossibility of other variants for this vulnerability Microsoft would need to check the count of properties for other expression\ntypes as well.\n\nEven with the above issues in dwmcore.dll, if the desired memory state is achieved to bypass the previously mentioned\nchecks and a batch of commands are issued to trigger the vulnerability, it still won’t be triggered because there is one more\nthing preventing it from happening.\n\nAs mentioned above, commands are first processed by the kernel and only after that are they sent to Desktop Window\nManager (dwm.exe). This means that if you try to send a command with an invalid propertyId,\nNtDCompositionProcessChannelBatchBuffer syscall will return an error and the command will not be passed to the\ndwm.exe process. SetResourceBufferProperty commands with expression type set to D2DVector2 are processed in the\nwin32kbase.sys driver with the functions DirectComposition::CPropertySetMarshaler::AddProperty<D2DVector2>(…) and\nDirectComposition::CPropertySetMarshaler::UpdateProperty<D2DVector2>(…), which are very similar to those present in\ndwmcore.dll (it’s quite likely they were copy-pasted). However, the kernel version of the UpdateProperty<D2DVector2>\nfunction has one notable difference – it actually checks the count of properties added to the resource.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n\nint DirectComposition::CPropertySetMarshaler::UpdateProperty<D2DVector2>\n(DirectComposition::CPropertySetMarshaler *this, unsigned int *commandParams, _QWORD *value)\n\n{\n\nunsigned int propertyId = commandParams[0];\n\nunsigned int storageOffset = commandParams[1];\n\nunsigned int type = commandParams[2];\n\nif ( propertyId >= this->propertiesCount\n\n|| storageOffset != this->properties[propertyId]->offset & 0x1FFFFFFF)\n\n|| type != this->properties[propertyId]->type )\n\n{\n\nreturn 0xC000000D;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\n*(_QWORD *)(this->propertiesData + (this->properties[propertyId]->offset & 0x1FFFFFFF)) = *value;\n\n...\n\n}\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\n\n**_DirectComposition::CPropertySetMarshaler::UpdateProperty<D2DVector2>(…) in win32kbase.sys_**\n\nThe check for propertiesCount in the kernel mode version of the UpdateProperty<D2DVector2> function prevents further\nprocessing of a malicious command by its user mode twin and mitigates the vulnerability, but this is where\nDirectComposition::CPropertySetMarshaler::AddProperty<D2DVector2>(…) comes in to play. The kernel version of the\nAddProperty<D2DVector2> function works exactly like its user mode variant and it also applies the same behavior of\nchecking property after it has already been added and returns an error if propertyId and storageOffset of the created\nproperty do not match the provided values. Because of this, it’s possible to use the AddProperty<D2DVector2> function to\nadd a new property and force the function to return an error and cause inconsistency between the number of properties\nassigned to the same resource in kernel mode/user mode. The propertiesCount check in the kernel could be bypassed this\nway and malicious commands would be passed to Desktop Window Manager (dwm.exe).\n\nInconsistency between the number of properties assigned to the same resource in kernel mode/user mode could be a\nsource of other vulnerabilities, so we recommend Microsoft to change the behavior of the AddProperty function and check\nproperties before they are added.\n\nThe whole exploitation process for the discovered exploit is as follows:\n\n1. Create a large number of resources with properties of specific size to get heap into predictable state.\n2. Create additional resources with properties of specific size and content to spray memory at specific locations with\n\nfake properties.\n3. Release resources created at stage 2.\n4. Create additional resources with properties. These resources will be used to perform OOB writes.\n5. Make holes among resources created at stage 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Create additional properties for resources created at stage 4. Their buffers are expected to be allocated at specific\n\nlocations.\n7. Create “special” properties to cause inconsistency between the number of properties assigned to the same resource\n\nin kernel mode/user mode for resources created at stage 4.\n8. Use OOB write vulnerability to write shellcode, create an object and get code execution.\n9. Inject additional shellcode into another system process.\n\nKaspersky products detect this exploit with the verdicts:\n\nHEUR:Exploit.Win32.Generic\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\nPDM:Exploit.Win32.Generic\n\n\n-----",
