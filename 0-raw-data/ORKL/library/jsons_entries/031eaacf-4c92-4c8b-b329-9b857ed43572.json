    "plain_text": "# APT40 is run by the Hainan department of the Chinese Ministry of State Security\n\n**intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/16/apt40-is-run-by-the-hainan-department-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-**\nsecurity/\n\nintrusiontruth January 16, 2020\n\nIn our previous articles we identified a network of front companies for APT activity in Hainan\nand showed their links to Hainan University academic Gu Jian. Although it was difficult to find\npeople who work for these companies we identified a number of individuals and concluded\nthat this network of companies was actually APT40. One of the individuals we identified,\nDing Xiaoyang, is the owner of a phone number used on job adverts under the name Mr\nChen.\n\n**Ding Xiaoyang’s role**\n\nWhen we started we weren’t sure what Ding Xiaoyang’s role was.\n\nSo we ran the numbers. How many Dings are there likely to be in Haikou, Hainan, and would\nit be possible to identify a specific Ding Xiaoyang among them?\n\nCurrent population of China: 1,419,627,903\nWorld Bank estimate of working age males: 511,625,426 (36.04%)\nPopulation of Haikou in Hainan: 1,517,400\nEstimate of working age males in Haikou: 546,862\nNumber of common Chinese surnames: 100 ()\nHow common is the surname Ding: 48th out of 100\nArithmetic progression: S = n/2 * (2a + [n-1] * d) => Sn 1 100 = 5,050\nProportion of Dings: 52 (100 – 48) out of 5,050\nPercentage chance of being a working age male called Ding: 1.04%\nHow many Dings in Haikou: likely 5,687\n\n5,687 Dings were too many to work through one by one. So we thought of a different way to\nfind out which Ding was our Ding. Why not use a highly effective, international, and\nmotivated network of contributors who could tell us exactly who he is and what he does…\n\nAs we saw previously, he is the owner of the telephone number being used on job adverts for\nthe network of front companies for APT40.\n\nOur contributors discovered that Ding Xiaoyang is also a Computer Science specialist who\nlives and works in Haikou.\n\nWe actually know quite a lot more about Ding Xiaoyang.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur original blueprint for an APT in China requires: contract hackers and specialists, front\ncompanies, and an intelligence officer.\n\nFront companies? Check. Specialists? Check. Intelligence officer? Ding Xiaoyang…\n\n**How did we do it?**\n\nRemember the (previously hacked and released) QQ information that be utilised to show\nAPT17’s use of reservoir dogs style codenames? Well…\n\nQQ account 348504569 uses the name Wan Huo Yan Wan (卍火焰卍). Interesting? Not until\nyou look into other names used by the same account. One is Ding Da Xia (丁大侠). Another\nis Ding Xiaoyang (丁晓阳). Let’s hypothesise that this might be our Mr Ding and that he might\nbe an intelligence officer in Hainan, China. Is there any evidence?\n\nLet’s look at what QQ user 348504569 was up to. Amongst other things, he was a member\nof QQ Group 92688210 which was called “内部文化活动交流” or “Exchange of internal\ncultural activities”. The group was created on 18 September 2009 and had 25 members. It’s\ndescription, “仅供内部成员文体休闲娱乐交”, stated that it was for internal members only. But\ninternal to what? A University perhaps? Or … a government institution?\n\nOne of our contributors examined all the members of this group to try to identify their\naffiliation. Imagine our surprise when we discovered an account that looked like it might\nbelong to an intelligence officer!\n\n**Who is Mr Huang?**\n\nQQ account 249550138 was a member of the internal cultural exchange group. It variously\nused the name Huang Liangli (黄良利), Deng Dai (等待), Ge Li (哥利) and Lao Ban Liang Li\n(老班良利).\n\nBut somebody once said that a picture paints a thousand words. So here is a picture that we\n[found online here and](https://user.qzone.qq.com/249550138) [here.](http://www.renren.com/246860380/profile)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nYes, that’s an MSS uniform. The significance of number 461079 on his chest? 46 = Hainan.\n\n**But that’s not it…**\n\n[We also found this RenRen profile for Ding Xiaoyang which contained a number of photos of](http://www.renren.com/224810694/profile)\nthe younger Mr Ding.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ding Xiaoyang’s profile photos on Renren_ Ding\n\nXiaoyang’s Renren profile\n\nDing Xiaoyang’s profile photos on Renren\nUp until 2009 Ding Xiaoyang posted regularly on Renren, but his posts suddenly stopped.\nWhy? Because he obtained a sensitive job working for the Chinese State. How do we know?\nWell, he said so:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIn 2009 in this post, Ding talked about his new job with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS)\nat the Hainan Provincial Department.\n\nDing: Work? Studying? Where?\n\nXu: Work, border inspection, how about you\n\nDing: Almost, MPS\n\nXu: Where is it?\n\nDing: In a distant and remote place, Hainan. . .\n\nXu: Hehe, okay. I’m close in Guangdong. Is it Haikou Public Security Bureau?\n\nDing: Hainan Provincial Department, also Haikou\n\nWe haven’t talked much about the Ministry of Public Security before. It is the Chinese\nnational police force and it is commonly used as cover for … the MSS.\n\n**Hainan State Security Department**\n\nOur researchers are not the only team to find a link between APT40 and Chinese\nintelligence. Closely held commercial intelligence has also shown that APT40 is run by the\nHainan department of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\n\n[According this handy list of public toilets in Haikou, the Hainan State Security Department is](http://www.haikou.gov.cn/cwdt/201607/t20160712_960752.html)\nbased at No. 176 Nanhai Avenue, Xiuying District, Haikou, Hainan (海南省海口市秀英区南海\n大道176号).\n\n\n-----\n\nIt looks like this, note the hammer and sickle topiary, satellite dishes, and perimeter wall:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nHainan State Security Department on Nanhai Avenue in Haikou\n**Conclusion**\n\n_Either a Hainan intelligence officer has a side-hustle running a business empire of at least 13_\n“fast-growing, high-tech information security companies”, and that business empire has a\nside-hustle recruiting people with knowledge of the languages spoken in APT40 target\ncountries coincidentally in the months preceding APT40 attacks in those countries, and on\nthe same island that we know APT40 runs its operations.\n\n_Or, APT40 is run by Ding Xiaoyang, an intelligence officer at the Hainan State Security_\nDepartment.\n\n**If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck…**\n\nAt this point, we are starting to think that we might not need to go to such lengths to\ninvestigate which part of the state is directing an APT.\n\nWe caught a re-run of the great TV show Blankety Blank the other day. We could have just\nplayed that instead of writing this blog.\n\nAPT3 was known to be based in Guangdong and was the work of the Guangdong\nState Security Department\nAPT10 was known to be based in Tianjin and was the work of the Tianjin State Security\nBureau\nAPT3 was known to be based in Jinan and was the work of the Jinan State Security\nBureau\nAPT40 was known to be based in Hainan and the work of was the _ _ _ _ _ _ State\nSecurity Department\n\nEasy.\n\n\n-----",
