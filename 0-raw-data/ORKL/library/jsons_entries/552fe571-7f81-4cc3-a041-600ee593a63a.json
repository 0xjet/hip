On closer inspection, Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft is confident that it can be](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\ndecrypted.\n\n**Lock Screen**\n\n\n-----\n\n[I was first notified of this new version by a poster in the forums who claimed he was able to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/626035/philapdelphia-new-ransomware-from-developer-of-stampado/)\nintercept communications between a person going by the handle of SkrillGuide2015 and the\nPhiladelphia developer The Rainmaker. This conversation was taking place on the\nAlphaBay Tor criminal site, and shows Rainmaker explaining how he has started selling his\nnew Philadelphia ransomware project for $400 USD and that he plans on starting to\ndistribute it today. Rainmaker's goal was to infect 20 thousand victims on his first day of\ndistribution.\n\nAccording to Rainmaker, Philadelphia \"innovates\" the ransomware market with features\nsuch as autodetecting when a payment has been made and then automatically decrypting,\ninfecting USB drives, and infecting other computers over the network. Of particular note, is a\nMercy Button that allows a compassionate criminal to automatically decrypt a particular\nvictim's files for free. In order to demonstrate this new ransomware, Rainmaker has created\na PDF showing its capabilities.\n\nThe advertised features are:\n\n\n-----\n\nEverything is customisable:\n\nYou can set the folders where the Ransomware will look for files as well as the\ndepth/recursion level\nYou can set the extensions, you can enable, disable and define intervals for the deadline\nand the russian roulette (as well as editing how many files are deleted on every russian\nroulette interval and whether the files or the crypt key gets deleted once the deadline ends\nYou can edit file icon and Mutex\nYou can edit the UAC (user access control) in four available options: (1) do not ask for\nadmin privilleges; (2) ask and insist until it is given; (3) ask but run anyway even if it is\nnot given; (4) ask and give up if it is not given\nYou can edit all the interface texts as well as add multiple languages to the same file (it\nwill detect the machine language and display the texts you edited for that locale or a\ndefault/fallback one)\nYou can enable or disable USB infect, network spread and Unkillable Process, as well as\nset the process name\n\nThe Philadelphia Headquarter is a software that works on your machine and allows you to\ngenerate unlimited builds, see the victims on a map and on a list (with country flags and all the\ndata you need) and also a \"Give Mercy\" button if you're too good 0:)\n\nBut the coolest Philadelphia feature (and what makes its maintenance so cheap) is that, instead\nof huge servers on our controls where you must pay high amounts monthly, we present you the\n\"Bridges\". Bridges are the way victims and attacker enters in touch in a distributed network. It's\nsimply a PHP script that uses itself as database (no MySQL or whatever needed, just PHP).\nBridges store the clients keys, verifies payments and provide the victims informations to the\nheadquarters safely. And they can be hosted on nearly any server: even hacked servers, shared\nhosting (free hosting works but it is not recommended as they can delete your account if it's not\na fully functional website), dedicated or VPS (recommended for bigger attacks, although the\nrequests are small and are only done a few times). As the bitcoin payment verification is done\non the server side, by the bridge, there is no way to spoof it on the victim machine. Also, the\ndistributed bridges network will grant a better anonimity.\n\nEverything very well documented on a plain-english help file!\n\nPrints: [https://www.docdroid.net/vJV82cC/philadelphia-prints.pdf.html](https://www.docdroid.net/vJV82cC/philadelphia-prints.pdf.html)\n\nThough the bridges + headquarters client looks interesting, it has some serious flaws as\ndescribed in the next section.\n\n## Taking a Bridge to the Headquarters\n\n\n-----\n\nFor an attacker to setup a Philadelphia campaign, they need to install a PHP scripts called\nBridges on web sites. These Bridges will be connected to by the ransomware infection and\nwill store the encryption key and information about the victim. They are also used by the\nransomware to check if a ransom payment has been made.\n\nThe attacker then runs a management client called the Philadelphia Headquarters on their\nmachine, which will connect to each configured bridge and download the victim data to their\nmanagement console. This client allows the attacker to see who is infected, what countries\nhave the most infections, and even offers a mercy button if a compassionate attacker wants to\nallow someone to decrypt their files for free.\n\n**Philadelphia Headquarters Management Console**\n\nThere is a fundamental problem, though, with this Bridge implementation. Unless these\nbridges are stored on anonymous networks like TOR, they will most likely be discovered and\ntaken down fairly quickly. As the addresses to these bridges are hard coded into the\nransomware, once the bridge is disabled, a victim no longer has the ability to pay the ransom\nor decrypt their files. For this implementation to really work, an attacker would need to\nsetup bridges using Tor, which increases the complexity of the setup.\n\n## Another malware dev unhappy with Researcher Fabian Wosar\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first two versions of Stampado were able to be decrypted by Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft\nand it also appears that this new Philadelphia variant is no exception. Like the Apocalypse\nRansomware developer, Rainmaker has not taken kindly to Fabian's attention as can be seen\nby a note left in the ransomware's AutoIT script.\n\n**Insulting Fabian Wosar in the Code**\n\n## How the Philadelphia Ransomware Encrypts a Victim's Files\n\nBased on images and a mailing list software found on one of the Bridges, I believe that this\nransomware is distributed through phishing emails that pretend to be an overdue\npayment notice from Brazil's Ministério da Fazenda, or the Ministry of Finance. You can see\nan example of the fake notice found on one of the Bridges below.\n\n**SPAM Notice**\n\n\n-----\n\nThese phishing emails most likely contain a link back to the top level folder of the Bridge,\nwhich contains a Java program that automatically downloads and executes the installer for\nthe Philadelphia ransomware.\n\nWhen the ransomware is started, it will load an embedded configuration file that\ncontains directives as to how the ransomware should encrypt a computer. The\nransomware currently being distributed will target fixed, removable, and network drives, and\ndrive root folders. When encrypting files it will use a custom encryption algorithm and target\nthe following files:\n```\n*.7z;*.asp;*.avi;*.bmp;*.cad;*.cdr;*.doc;*.docm;*.docx;*.gif;*.html;*.jpeg;*.jpg;*.mdb\n\n```\nWhen a file is encrypted, its name will be scrambled and have the .locked extension\nappended to it. For example, test.jpg may\nbecome 7B205C09B88C57ED8AB7C913263CCFBE296C8EA9938A.locked.\n\nWhen it is finished it will display the lock screen shown below.\n\n**Lock Screen**\n\nLast, but not least, if Russian Roulette is enabled, a counter will begin and when it runs down\nto zero, a certain preconfigured amount of files will be deleted.\n\nAs already said, this ransomware is most likely decryptable for free. So if you are infected\nwith Stampado, or this Philadelphia variant, please do not pay the ransom.
