Included is a list of targets they\nwont attack with some exclusions that definitely stand out.\n\n[In 2019, the Maze ransomware operation introduced a new double-extortion strategy of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-not-getting-paid-leaks-data-left-and-right/)\n[stealing unencrypted files and then threatening to publicly release them on data leak sites if](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\na ransom is not paid.\n\nSoon after, other ransomware gangs adopted this strategy until it has become a popular\nmethod for threat actors to extort their victims.\n\n## Babyk launches a data leak site\n\nBabyk ransomware, also known as Babuk, is a new ransomware operation that launched at\nthe beginning of the year and has been targeting enterprise organizations worlwide.\n\nWhen first launched, the ransomware gang was leaking their data in posts on the 'Raid\nForums' hacking forum but had stated that they planned on launching a dedicated leak site.\n\nEmsisoft security researcher Brett Callow shared a new site recently created by the Babyk\nRansomware group where they are currently listing four victims, and the leaked data for\nthree of them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LockBit data leak site**\nIncluded on the data leak site is a list of organizations that they will not encrypt, which\nincludes hospitals, non-profits, schools, and small businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Organizations that won't be attacked**\nFor each of these categories, the ransomware gangs lists the following exclusions:\n\nWe do not audit next categories of organizations\nHospitals: except private plastic surgery clinics, private dental clinics\n\nNon-Profit: Any non-profitable charitable foundation (except the foundations who help\nLGBT and BLM)\n\nSchools: except the major universities\n\nSmall Business: Companies with annual revenue less than 4 mln$ (info about\nrevenue we take from zoominfo)\n\nBleepingComputer has seen exclusion in the past for healthcare and what ransomware\nactors call \"socially vital\" services, such as 911, shelters, and nursing homes.\n\nThe exclusions for non-profits is the first time BleepingComputer has seen personal\nopinions dictate whether a ransomware operation will encrypt an organization.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the release of Babuk s site, there are now a total of ninteeen active ransomware data\nleak sites used in the double extortion tactic.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Babuk Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/babuk-locker/)\n[Babyk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/babyk/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Data Leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-leak/)\n[Double-Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/double-extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
