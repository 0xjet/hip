The research focused on scenarios with the same tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) along with the repeated nefarious use of a ‘legitimate’ remote administration tool ‘Remote Manipulator System’ (RMS), developed by a Russian- based company ‘TektonIT’.\n\nBased on this continued analysis, an additional campaign\n\ntargeting financial institutions in Chile, India, Italy, Malawi,\n\nPakistan and South Korea was identified as previously\n\nconducted during December 2018. Given the use of\n\nspecific malware, it is with high certainty attributed to\n\nthe financially-motivated threat actor group ‘TA505’.\n\nWhilst TA505 are almost certainly responsible for several\n\nof these recent campaigns, broader analysis of the\n\nTTP employed indicates that multiple threat actors are\n\nconducting similar operations against a variety of victims,\n\n\n###### This report contains key research findings on the following issues:\n\nRecent attacks against global retailers and\n\nfinancial institutions (ongoing since December\n\n2018) attributed to TA505, a suspected Russian\n\nspeaking threat group:\n\n###### • Group motives – financial benefits over\n\npolitical backing\n\n###### • Group activities since 2014, incl. distribution\n\nof high-volume malicious email campaigns,\n\nincluding the distribution of the “Dridex” and\n\n“Shifu” banking trojans as well as the Neutrino\n\nbotnet/exploit kit and Locky ransomware\n\n###### • Attacks against financial institutions in Chile,\n\nIndia, Italy, Malawi, Pakistan and South Korea\n\n###### • Attacks against retailers in the United States\n\n**Campaign Modus Operandi**\n\n###### • Leverage of legitimate software – remote\n\nadministration tool – to gain entry into\n\nnetworks and evade traditional security\n\ncontrols Delivered via phishing emails\n\ncontaining malicious MS office documents\n\nand leveraging social engineering\n\n\n-----\n\nespecially with the use of RMS. Whilst sophisticated and\n\norganized cybercriminal threat actors, such as TA505,\n\nare successfully conducting large scale campaigns\n\nagainst high-value targets using these tried-and-tested\n\nTTP, Russian-language forum discussions and tutorials\n\nprovide detail to unsophisticated and disparate threat\n\nactors that could enable them to package and deliver\n\nthe same threats. As such, numerous recent campaigns\n\nobserved as deploying the RMS tool cannot all be\n\nattributed to the same threat actor and may be serving\n\na variety of objectives.\n\nOrganized cybercriminal groups, and many less\norganized threat actors, utilising these TTPs are likely\n\nfinancially motivated, seeking access to systems from\n\nwhich valuable data can be stolen or on which they can\n\nperform fraudulent financial transactions.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, threat actors appear to be\n\nutilising remote administration tools to directly perform\n\nthis activity as well as leveraging the tool’s capabilities\n\nto conduct reconnaissance and lateral movement within\n\na victim network. Given the capabilities of the remote\n\nadministration tool and the accessibility of information on\n\nhow to conduct malicious operations, ‘lone-wolf’ threat\n\nactors and groups with differing objectives or motivations\n\nmay be utilising the same toolsets and TTPs for general\n\nmalevolence or mischief.\n\nTried and tested attack patterns appear to be consistent\n\nacross these recently observed campaigns and\n\ncommence with the delivery of phishing emails that have\n\nlure document attachments. Utilising legitimate logos,\n\nlanguage and terminology consistent with common\n\nbusiness interactions or the target organization, the\n\nemail encourages the potential victim to open the lure\n\n\n###### CyberInt researches have been tracking various activities following the spear-phishing campaign targeting large US-based retailers detected in December 2018.\n\ndocument attachment which in turn instructs them to\n\ndisable security controls within Microsoft Office to allow\n\na nefarious macro to be executed.\n\nThe macro, if executed, subsequently attempts to\n\ndownload malicious payloads from the threat actor’s C2\n\ninfrastructure that in most cases also masquerades as, or\n\nmimics, legitimate-looking domains such as using names\n\nand misspellings related to ‘Cloud’, ‘Microsoft Office 365’\n\nor ‘Security’.\n\nTypically, the initial payload will be a more robust\n\nmalware downloader that is used to gather further\n\ncomponents including a remote access trojan (RAT),\n\nin many cases the legitimate remote administration\n\ntool ‘RMS’, as well as supporting shell scripts (BAT) and\n\nconfiguration files.\n\nGiven continued activity sharing the same or similar\n\nTTP, this report provides an overview of the recent\n\nobservations along with detailing the capabilities of\n\nthe legitimate remote administration tool ‘RMS’ and\n\nassociated indicators of compromise (IOC).\n\n\n-----\n\n# ‘TA505’ Group Profile\n\n\n###### The sophisticated threat actor group\n\n dubbed ‘TA505’ are financially\n motivated and have been attributed to\n\n high-volume malicious email campaigns\n\n since 2014, including the distribution of\n\n the ‘Dridex’ and ‘Shifu’ banking trojans\n\n as well as the Neutrino botnet/exploit\n\n kit and Locky ransomware.\n\n Following the decline in the popularity of\n\n ransomware, likely due to mitigation tactics\n\n employed by organizations and victims lacking\n\n confidence in data restoration following\n\n payment, TA505 were observed as returning to\n\n tried and tested payloads, such as information\n\n stealing backdoors and remote access trojans\n\n (RAT) that are delivered using downloaders and\n\n weaponised Microsoft Office files.\n\n Subsequently TA505 were observed in November\n\n 2018 as deploying a threat known as ‘ServHelper’\n\n of which there are two reported variants; one\n\n which provides remote desktop capabilities via a\n\n reverse-SSH tunnel and another which primarily\n\n\n###### acts as a downloader, presumably to allow\n\n additional malicious payloads to be installed on\n\n the victim's system. \n\n Notably, recent TA505 attributed campaigns\n\n include the use of the ‘Remote Manipulator\n\n System’ (RMS), an off-the-shelf commercial remote\n\n administration tool, as observed in the December\n\n 2018 campaigns against US-based retailers, as\n\n well as, targeting the financial industry between\n\n December 2018 and February 2019.\n\n Furthermore, indicators of compromise\n\n identified in this US retail campaign are\n\n consistent with an attack against the Notary\n\n Chamber of Ukraine (Нотаріальна палата\n\n України), also during December 2018. Whilst\n\n the cryptographic hashes and payload filenames\n\n deployed in both December 2018 campaigns\n\n were identical, the Ukrainian attacks cannot\n\n necessarily be attributed to TA505 as other\n\n groups may be utilising similar TTP along with\n\n the commercial tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n# RECENT CAMPAIGNS\n\n##### US RETAIL ATTACKS\n\nIn mid-December 2018 a spear-phishing campaign was detected as targeting large US-based retailers along\n\nwith organizations in the food and beverage industry. Masquerading as a legitimate communication sent\n\nfrom a Ricoh printer, the initial email lured victims into opening an attached malicious Microsoft Word\n\ndocument.\n\n**Lure Document/Downloader**\n\nOnce opened, the lure document (Figure 1), which includes the target organization's logo to retain\n\nauthenticity, encourages the victim to disable Microsoft Office’s security features.\n\n###### You've got a new message\n\nOnce You have enabled\n\nThis document is only Click Enable editing\n\n**editing, please click**\n\navalible for desktop button from the yellow\n\n**Enable Content button**\n\nor laptop version of bar above\n\nfrom the yellow bar above\n\nMicrosoft Office Word\n\nFigure 1 – Lure document\n\n**Once editing has been enabled within the document, a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro**\n\n**is executed that will download an additional payload from the threat actor’s command and control**\n\n**(C2) infrastructure, using the Microsoft Windows Installer (Figure 2).**\n\nFigure 2 – Payload download using MSIExec\n\nThe remote payload to install is specified by passing the URL to the ‘/i’ command line option whilst the\n\nquiet ‘/q’ option ensures that the installation is performed in the background without displaying user\n\ninterface (UI) elements to the victim. Additionally, three variables are provided, ‘step’, ‘done’ and ‘change’\n\nthat, along with their corresponding values, would be passed to the installation package to influence or\n\nmodify the installation.\n\nPresumably to thwart detection or casual analysis, the VBA macro code has some code obfuscation with\n\nclass and module attributes being used to store values (Figure 3) that are later referenced (Figure 4).\n\n\nFigure 2 – Payload download using MSIExec\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Form ‘Tag’ attribute value holding the MSIExec parameters (download URL)\n\nFigure 4 – Referencing the ‘Tag’ attribute\n\nPotentially remaining from previous versions of this VBA macro, artefacts include code comments that\n\nappear to be variable assignments referencing ‘Temp\\scype0’, a potential file path and misspelling of ‘Skype’\n\n(Figure 5), as well as a seemingly unreferenced IP logging service ‘hxxps://iplogger.org/6vfgP’ that provides\n\nlogs detail of any IP address accessing the URL (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5 – Code artefacts\n\nThe use of this IP logging service provides a\n\nuseful insight into those that have executed the\n\nweaponised document with details of the visitor’s,\n\nor more aptly victim’s, IP address, operating system,\n\nbrowser and geolocation being available to the\n\nthreat actor through a statistics page accessible via\n\na specific link combined with their ‘IPLogger ID’.\n\nFigure 6 – ‘IPLogger.org’ statistics\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INSTALLATION\n\nHaving downloaded the MSI installation package, the MSIExec installation process executes without user\n\ninteraction (Figure 7) and extracts the payload components.\n\n**Reboot#1** **winserv.exe#168** **#10**\n\n**Child** **ping.exe**\n**Process**\n\n**RPC** **Child** **Child** **Child** **Child**\n\n**Sample** **#1** **Server** **#2** **Process** **#7** **Process** **#8** **Process** **#9** **Process** **#11**\n\n**Start** **msiexec.exe** **msiexec.exe** **msi2adc.tmp** **exit.exe** **cmd.exe** **ping.exe**\n\nFigure 7 – Execution flow **ChildProcess** **#12** **ChildProcess** **#13** **ChildProcess**\n\n**7zinstall.exe** **exit.exe**\n\nHaving dropped a binary file to disk, ‘%SystemRoot%\\installer\\msi2adc.tmp’, the RAT executable\n\n‘exit.exe’, self-extracting archive ‘syst.dll’ and shell script ‘i.cmd’ are extracted to the ‘%TEMP%’\n\ndirectory. Subsequently, ‘exit.exe’ is launched and spawns the command-line interpreter ‘cmd.exe’\n\nwhich in turn executes the ‘i.cmd’ shell script (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 – First-stage shell script\n\n\nThe use of the ping command (lines 2 and 4) sends\n\nthree echo requests to the legitimate domain\n\n‘cloudflare.com’, with the timeout value set to\n\n3,000 milliseconds, and potentially acts as both\n\na connectivity test and a pause between steps.\n\nAssuming the ping process exits without error,\n\nindicated by the ‘%ERRORLEVEL%’ not being equal\n\nto one, the dropped self-extracting archive file ‘syst.\n\ndll’ is first renamed as ‘7zinstall.exe’ (line 3) and then\n\nexecuted (line 5).\n\nThe self-extracting archive is extracted, as specified\n\nby the ‘x’ option, using the password provided after\n\nthe ‘-p’ switch whilst the ‘-y’ switch suppresses any\n\npotential user interaction by assuming ‘yes’ to any\n\nquery or prompt.\n\nRemote Manipulator System (RMS)\n\nFigure 9 – ‘exit.exe’ process execution\n\n\nHaving extracted the contents of the self\nextracting archive to ‘%PROGRAMDATA%\\\n\nMicrotik’, a second copy of the ‘exit.exe’ file is\n\npresent along with a legitimate signed Remote\n\nManipulator System (RMS) executable ‘winserv.\n\nexe’, RMS configuration file ‘settings.dat’ and a\n\ndifferent ‘i.cmd’ shell script.\n\nThe final stage of the self-extraction process\n\nlaunches ‘exit.exe’ (Figure 9) which in turn spawns\n\nanother command-line interpreter ‘cmd.exe’ to\n\nexecute the new ‘i.cmd’ shell script (Figure 10).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Second-stage shell script\n\n###### For persistence, the second-stage shell script (line 2) adds a ‘Microtik’ string value to the ‘HKEY_\n\n CURRENT_USERS’ hive, ‘Windows\\CurrentVersion’Run’ key (Figure 11) to launch the RMS executable\n\n whenever the user logs on.\n\nFigure 11 – Persistence registry key\n\n###### Additionally, the RMS executable is launched (line 3) before the script tries to forcefully kill the\n\n ‘rundll32.exe’ process, causing the script to go into a loop.\n\n Finally, the RMS executable attempts to ‘call home’ with connection attempts being observed, at\n\n the time, to ‘89.144.25.32’ on port ‘5655’, a C2 server located in Germany.\n\n Pivoting on the indicators observed in this campaign identify additional malicious samples and\n\n associated C2 domains/IP addresses that, in addition to identifying a pattern of activity, link this\n\n observed activity to TA505 operations utilising the ‘ServHelper’ backdoor.\n\n##### FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ATTACKS WITH SERVHELPER\n\n\n**Pivoting on indicators and behaviours**\n\n**observed in the US-based retail attacks**\n\n**and TA505 activity, a campaign targeting**\n\n**financial organizations was identified as**\n\n**active between December 2018 and March**\n\n**2019. Based on the email and document lures**\n\n**detected thus far, this campaign has targeted**\n\n**financial institutions in Chile, India, Italy,**\n\n**Malawi, Pakistan and South Korea at least,**\n\n\n**with similar sample submissions originating**\n\n**from China, Great Britain, France and the**\n\n**United States, potentially indicating a more**\n\n**widespread campaign.**\n\n**Utilising somewhat minimal email lures (Figure**\n\n**12/Figure 13/Figure 14), often purporting to**\n\n**relate to payments, victims are enticed into**\n\n**opening the attached weaponised Microsoft**\n\n**Excel spreadsheet.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 – Example email lure ‘pending payments’\n\nFigure 13 – Example email lure ‘DLR payments’\n\nFigure 14 – Example email lure 'detalle de referencia'\n\n\nFigure 14 – Example email lure 'detalle de referencia'\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 – Lure spreadsheet (English)\n\nFigure 16 – Lure spreadsheet (Italian)\n\nFigure 17 – Lure spreadsheet (Korean)\n\n###### Unlike the US-based retail campaign, the spreadsheet lure does not contain VBA macros and\n\n instead spawns a Microsoft Windows Installer process (Figure 18) to download an additional\n\n payload from the threat actor’s command and control (C2) infrastructure.\n\n\n**#3**\n**msiexec.exe**\n\n\n**#1**\n**Sample Start**\n**excel.exe**\n\nFigure 18 – Execution flow\n\n\n**Child Process** **Child Process**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This behaviour is consistent with other TA505 campaigns utilising a combination of weaponised\n\n Microsoft Office files containing either VBA macros or exploit code to spawn additional processes.\n\n Of the spreadsheet lures analysed in this campaign, four different C2 servers and payloads were\n\n identified, with each likely being unique to a specific target organization or victim cluster (Figure 19).\n\nFigure 19 – Payload download using MSIExec\n\nIn addition to specifying the remote package to install, using the ‘/i’ command line option, the quiet ‘/q’\n\noption ensures that the installation is performed in the background without displaying any user interface\n\n(UI) elements to the victim. Additionally, variables are passed to the installation package with ‘OnLoad’ being\n\npresent in all cases along with either ‘serf’ and ‘done’ or ‘val’ and ‘rdp’. Whilst the nature of these variables\n\nhas not been determined, they may influence or modify the installation of the specified MSI file.\n\n\n###### C2 Server Theme\n\nThe C2 domains observed in this campaign\n\nshare a common ‘Microsoft Office 365’ theme,\n\npresumably in an attempt to thwart casual\n\nanalysis by appearing legitimate to the\n\nuntrained eye. Given this theme, pivots on DNS\n\n\n###### ServHelper\n\nHaving downloaded and installed the MSI installation\n\npackage, an executable file is dropped that spawns\n\nnumerous processes and commences the installation of\n\n‘ServHelper’, a threat reportedly developed using ‘Delphi’\n\nand first identified in November 2018.\n\nUpon execution, further confirmation that the threat was\n\ndeveloped using the Delphi integrated development\n\nenvironment (IDE) is gained through attempts to access\n\nthe following legitimate registry keys:\n\n**• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Embarcadero\\Locales**\n\n**• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Embarcadero\\Locales**\n\n**• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\CodeGear\\Locales**\n\n**• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\CodeGear\\Locales**\n\n**• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Borland\\Locales**\n\n**• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Borland\\Delphi\\Locales**\n\n\nanalysis by appearing legitimate to the\n\nuntrained eye. Given this theme, pivots on DNS\n\nWhois data can be used to identify additional\n\npotential infrastructure and are provided in\n\nAppendix A for reference.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Note:\n\n\nWhilst these registry keys are not in themselves an indicator of compromise\n\n(IOC), attempts to access them in environments not using Delphi-developed\n\napplications may be of interest.\n\nHaving created the file that resulted in the threat’s name, ‘%SYSTEMROOT%\\\n\nServHelper.dll’, the process checks for the presence of the ‘Terminal Services’\n\nservice and changes the configuration, if necessary, to ensure that the service is\n\nstarted automatically during system start-up (‘dwStartType=0x2’) (Figure 20).\n\n\nFigure 20 – ‘Terminal Services’ service check\n\nSubsequently, the Terminal Services service is started, presumably to allow remote access via RDP (Figure 21).\n\nFigure 21 – 'Terminal Services' service started\n\nAdditional files are also created by the malicious process including ‘%SYSTEM32%\\syssettings.ini’ and\n\n‘%SYSTEM32%\\termsrv32.dll’.\n\nCommunications between ServHelper and the command and control (C2) server include basic information\n\nabout the compromised host (Figure 22) and are sent using HTTP POST.\n\nFigure 22 – ServHelper C2 Beacon\n\n###### Remote Desktop Capabilities\n\nPresumably as part of the process to ensure that the Terminal Services service is operational, the registry\n\nkey ‘HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TermService\\Parameters’ is updated, or created, (Figure\n\n23) and references the dropped ‘termsrv32.dll’ file rather than the default ‘termsrv.dll’ (Figure 24).\n\nFigure 23 – Alternate ‘Terminal Services’ Service\n\nFigure 24 – Updated ‘Terminal Services’ registry value\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving queried the status of multiple services, the ‘CryptSvc’, ‘Dnscache’, ‘LanmanWorkstation’, ‘NlaSvc’ and\n\n‘TermService’ services are started, likely to enable the ServHelper remote capabilities.\n\nSubsequently, to facilitate remote access, a new user ‘supportaccount’ is created, with a password of\n\n‘Ghar4f5’, and added to both the ‘Remote Desktop Users’ and ‘Administrators’ groups (or the Russian\n\nlanguage equivalents) using the ‘net.exe’ command line utility (Figure 25).\n\nFigure 25 – ‘supportaccount’ user creation/‘Remote Desktop Users’ & ‘Administrator’ group membership\n\nAdditionally, the username of the currently logged-in user is obtained from the environment variable and\n\nalso added to the ‘Remote Desktop Users’ group, again using ‘net.exe’ commands (Figure 26).\n\nFigure 26 – Victim added to 'Remote Desktop Users' group\n\n###### Persistence\n\nUtilising Windows Scheduled Task command line utility ‘schtasks.exe’, the ‘ServHelper.dll’ in configured to\n\nexecute under the ‘SYSTEM’ user context at logon (Figure 27).\n\nFigure 27 – Persistence using Scheduled Tasks\n\nSubsequently, payloads are dropped and result in the same malicious execution flow as observed in the\n\nUS-based retail incident, including the RMS binary file, configuration shell scripts and victim specific content\n\nincluding the RMS configuration file.\n\n##### NOTARY CHAMBER OF UKRAINE\n\nAlso observed in December 2018, the same TTP, including ‘RMS’ being deployed, were used in an attack\n\nagainst the Notary Chamber of Ukraine (Нотаріальна палата України).\n\nIn this instance, the initial email spear-phishing campaign mimicked the Shevchenkivsky District Court of\n\nKyiv (Шевченківський районний суд міста Києва) regarding a notary issue and encouraged the victim\n\nto open the weaponised Microsoft Word document attachment (Figure 28).\n\nFigure 28 – Lure email (Notary Chamber of Ukraine)\n\n\nFigure 25 – ‘supportaccount’ user creation/‘Remote Desktop Users’ & ‘Administrator’ group membership\n\n\nFigure 27 – Persistence using Scheduled Tasks\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document attachment,\n\nappearing as badly scanned\n\ndocumentation (Figure 29),\n\nreportedly either contained\n\na VBA macro downloader, as\n\nobserved in the US-based retail\n\nincident, or malicious binary\n\npayloads used to ultimately\n\ninstall the RMS tool.\n\nFigure 29 – Lure Document\n\n#### REMOTE MANIPULATOR SYSTEM (RMS)\n\nRemote Manipulator System (RMS) is a legitimate remote administration tool developed by a Russian\n\norganization ‘TektonIT’ and has been observed in campaigns conducted by TA505 as well as numerous\n\nsmaller campaigns likely attributable to other, disparate, threat actors. In addition to the availability of\n\ncommercial licences, the tool is free for non-commercial use and supports the remote administration of\n\nboth Microsoft Windows and Android devices.\n\nFigure 30 – TektonIT RMS (rmansys.ru/remoteutilities.com)\n\nAs to be expected when dealing with cybercriminals, ‘cracked’ versions of RMS also appear to be distributed\n\non underground forums and likely remove licencing restrictions.\n\nNegating the need for a threat actor to develop their own tools, RMS features include remote control with\n\nmulti-monitor support, task manager, file transfer, command line interface, network mapping capabilities\n\nand webcam/microphone access, all of which are common traits of a well-developed remote access\n\ntrojan (RAT). These features, coupled with the ability to install and operate the tool silently, make RMS an\n\nattractive off-the-shelf solution for ‘abuse’ by both sophisticated and unsophisticated threat actors alike.\n\n\nFigure 29 – Lure Document\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to RMS implementing its own remote desktop capabilities, which are compressed and encrypted,\n\nthe Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is also supported and as such could facilitate the control of\n\n‘ServHelper’ compromised devices.\n\nNotably, whilst most malicious RATs would need to call home to the threat actor’s command and control\n\n(C2) infrastructure, RMS includes an ‘Internet-ID’ feature which calls home to the developers’ servers and\n\nsends a notification via email (Figure 31), further reducing attack complexity for less sophisticated threat\n\nactors.\n\nFigure 31 – Example ‘Internet-ID’ email\n\nWithin this notification email, the victim’s username and device name is provided along with the internet\nID and password required for remote administration.\n\nAlternatively, and seemingly favored by more sophisticated threat actors such as TA505, a self-hosted\n\noption is supported by RMS and allows them to configure their own ‘Remote Utilities’ (RU) Server. This RU\n\nServer supports three roles that can be deployed individually or together, although only one, the ‘Relay\n\nServer’, would likely be utilised in nefarious implementations. This Relay Server acts as an intermediary\n\nwith ‘compromised’ RMS clients calling-home to it and identifying themselves with their ‘Internet-ID’\n\nfacilitating communications that allow firewalls and NAT devices to be bypassed.\n\nThe additional roles, ‘Authorization Server’, supporting the management of access permissions, and\n\n‘Sync Server’, synchronising address books, are likely only deployed in legitimate environments such as\n\ncorporate IT support teams.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### BROADER USE OF RMS\n\nNumerous Russian-language forum and social media posts, along with YouTube video tutorials, detail how\n\nto package the legitimate RMS components for use in malicious campaigns and appear to date back to at\n\nleast 2011.\n\nThreat actors such as TA505 have likely\n\nevolved their use of RMS over time to the\n\npoint where they now package and deliver\n\nthe capable tool with their own malware;\n\na blend of proprietary threats with off-the\nshelf components combined with tried\n\nand tested TTP.\n\nFigure 32 – 2011 Forum thread discussing the hidden installation and use of RMS\n\nThat being said, the accessibility and simplicity of using RMS for nefarious purposes likely explains the\n\nprevalence of the tool in unrelated malicious campaigns, many of which share similar TTP but differ in their\n\nconfiguration and use of RMS.\n\n##### RMS CONFIGURATION\n\nWhilst the recent TA505 campaigns illustrate how a sophisticated threat actor may deliver the RMS tool,\n\nalong with other payloads, numerous tutorials, guides and tools are available on underground forums to\n\nallow unsophisticated threat actors to conduct similar operations.\n\nAs if RMS didn’t already provide enough functionality that can be abused by threat actors, the ‘Viewer’\n\napplication includes a ‘MSI Configurator’ option that allows an installer package to be created. Having first\n\ndownloaded the latest RMS Host package from the legitimate website, the configurator wizard allows the\n\ncreation of three distribution types (Figure 33).\n\nFigure 33 – RMS Host distribution types\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the distribution package type has been selected, the wizard allows the configuration of email\n\nnotifications (Figure 34) as well as supressing various options, dependant on the package type selected\n\n(Figure 35).\n\nFigure 34 – Internet-ID Configuration\n\nFigure 35 – Other advanced options\n\nOnce the initial wizard has finished, a package is created and an additional ‘Remote Settings’ dialog is\n\ndisplayed (Figure 36) allowing further configuration and customisation.\n\nNotably within these settings is the ability to supress notifications and other\n\npotentially victim-alerting features as well as configuring the network port and\n\npreventing the future modification of settings without a password.\n\nOnce the package and configuration have been prepared, they can then be\n\ndelivered via various means to potential victims. In the case of TA505, this\n\ninvolved a lure file acting as a downloader, which delivered custom payloads\n\nand ultimately install RMS silently. Less-sophisticated threat actors may choose\n\nto follow an existing tutorial or obtain one of many builder tools available on\n\nunderground forums to further prepare their pre-configured RMS host which can\n\nFigure 36 – ‘ then subsequently be delivered to victims via common methods, such as phishing\nRemote Settings’ dialog\n\nemails or by masquerading as legitimate downloads.\n\n\nFigure 34 – Internet-ID Configuration\n\n\nFigure 36 – ‘\nRemote Settings’ dialog\n\n\n-----\n\n##### RMS BUILDERS\n\nEarly tutorials regarding the silent installation of RMS demonstrate the use of ‘AutoIT’, a legitimate\n\nautomation tool, that supresses user interactive elements of a preconfigured RMS installer, such as sending\n\na mouse click command to close the installation completion dialog (Figure 37).\n\nFigure 37 – AutoIT Script\n\nIn this instance, the AutoIT script is compiled and compressed, along with a customised RMS installation\n\nexecutable, in a self-extracting archive.\n\nTo further simplify the packaging process, numerous ‘builder’ tools (Figure 38) are available to generate\n\nsilent configurations and installers for the RMS host.\n\nWhilst the features of these builder tools vary from tool to tool\n\n(Figure 39), they typically include persistence capabilities, the\n\nability to mimic legitimate applications or be bundled with another\n\nfile, file encryption and packing to evade antivirus solutions,\n\nbypassing User Account Control (UAC) and further demonstrating\n\nthat there is no honour among thieves, the removal of any other\n\nRMS instance to eliminate potential competition.\n\nFigure 38 – Example RMS Host ‘Builder’\n\nFigure 39 – Example RMS Host ‘Builder’ features\n\n\n-----\n\n##### RMS VIEWER\n\nHaving successfully built and deployed the nefariously configured RMS host components to victims,\n\nthe threat actor can remotely manage victim machines, with a simple right-click, using the RMS Viewer\n\napplication (Figure 40).\n\nFigure 40 – Example Threat Actor use of RMS Viewer\n\nWhilst functionality such as ‘Full control’ and ‘Chat’ will likely alert the victim to the activity, functions such\n\nas the ‘File transfer’, ‘Terminal’ and ‘Remote install’ could facilitate the theft of data, information gathering\n\nand the deployment of additional malicious payloads.\n\n##### RMS CONFIGURATION XML\n\nWhen installed, RMS appears to store its configuration as hexadecimal encoded XML data within the\n\nWindows Registry (Figure 41).\n\nFigure 41 – Example RMS Registry Configuration\n\n\n-----\n\nWhilst the registry location may differs between threat variants and versions, common locations include:\n\n**• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\TektonIT\\**\n\n**• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Remote Manipulator System\\**\n\nThe presence of these registry keys, or similarly named values containing hexadecimal encoded RMS\n\nconfiguration XML data, are likely indicators of compromise.\n\nWhen obtained from a compromised machine, analysis of RMS configuration XML data can provide insight\n\ninto the RMS configuration as well as identifying the C2 server (Figure 42) or threat actor email address\n\n(Figure 43).\n\nFigure 42 – Example 'RMS Internet ID Settings' XML with C2 domain\n\nFigure 43 – Example 'RMS INET ID Notification' XML with notification email address\n\n##### RMS C2 COMMUNICATIONS\n\nC2 communications between the RMS host and server have been observed as using a pre-defined user\nagent string ‘Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; RMS)’. In the absence of a configuration option for this string, it is likely\n\nhardcoded and therefore communications identifying themselves as this user-agent are likely compromised.\n\nC2 communications, via TCP, appear to transmit XML data with a structure similar to the RMS configuration\n\ndata with base-64 encoded elements (Figure 44).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 44 – Example C2 communications (Red – victim; Blue – C2 server)\n\nDecoding the above base-64 encoded value reveals another XML configuration file, providing an overview\n\nof the RMS client to the C2 server (Figure 45).\n\nFigure 45 - RMS host (victim) data sent to C2 Server\n\nIn the case of a RMS host configured\n\nto call home to the legitimate servers,\n\nresulting in a notification email to the\n\nthreat actor, a HTTP POST is used to send\n\nthe data comprised of email address,\n\nadditional text (as specified in the\n\nconfiguration, and potentially providing\n\nan indication of a tool being used),\n\nvictim user name, victim computer name,\n\nInternet-ID, victim language and the\n\nproduct name (Figure 46).\n\nFigure 46 – Call home to legitimate server with email notification\n\n\nFigure 44 – Example C2 communications (Red – victim; Blue – C2 server)\n\n\n-----\n\n# INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE (IOC)\n\n##### US RETAIL ATTACKS\n\n\n###### Files\n\n SHA256 Filename(s)
