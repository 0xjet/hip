Additional sources indicate\nthis campaign may date as far back as 2011. We call this campaign Thamar Reservoir, named after one of\nthe targets, Thamar E. Gindin[1], who exposed new information about the attack and is currently assisting with\nthe investigation.\n\nThe campaign includes several different attacks with the aim of taking over the target’s computer or gain\naccess to their email account. We estimate that this access is used for espionage or other nation-state\ninterests, and not for monetary gain or hacktivism. In some cases, the victim is not the final target; the\nattackers use the infected computer, email, or stolen credentials as a platform to further attack their\nintended target.\n\nThe attackers are extremely persistent in their attempts to breach their targets. These attempts include:\n\n  - Breaching trusted websites to set up fake pages\n\n  - Multi-stage malware\n\n  - Multiple spear phishing emails based on reconnaissance and information gathering.\n\n  - Phone calls to the target.\n\n  - Messages on social networks.\n\nWhile very successful in their attacks, the attackers are clearly not technically sophisticated. They are not\nnew to hacking, but do make various mistakes, such as grammatical errors, exposure of attack infrastructure,\neasy to bypass anti analysis techniques, lack of code obfuscation, and more.\n\nThese mistakes enabled us to learn about their infrastructure and methods. More importantly, we have\nlearned of 550 targets, most of them in the Middle East, from various fields: research about diplomacy,\nMiddle East and Iran, international relations, and other fields; Defense and security; Journalism and human\nrights; and more.\n\nVarious characteristics of the attacks and their targets bring us to the conclusion that the threat actors are\nIranian. In addition, we note that these attacks share characteristics with previously documented activities:\n\n  - Attacks conducted using the Gholee malware, which we discovered.\n\n  - Attacks reported by Trend Micro in Operation Woolen-Goldfish.\n\n  - Attacks conducted by the Ajax Security Team as documented by FireEye.\n\n  - Attacks seen during Newscaster as documented by iSight.\n\n**For further details and questions, or if you think you are a victim please contact us at:**\n\n**info [at] clearskysec.com**\n\n1 Dr. Gindin is an expert on Iranian linguistics and Pre-Islamic Iran, renowned lecturer and research fellow at the Ezri\nCenter for Iran and Persian Gulf Research in the University of Haifa.\n[http://www.thmrsite.com/?page_id=198](http://www.thmrsite.com/?page_id=198)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 3 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n### Modus operandi - investigation of targeted attacks\n\n\nThis chapter contains an in-depth analysis of a series of attacks against one of the Thamar Reservoir targets.\nThe heavy attack began two days after the target, Dr. Thamar E. Gindin, was interviewed on the IDF radio\nstation[2].\n\nOver the course of two weeks, the threat actor used the following attacks against a single target:\n\n1. One spear phishing email containing malware.\n\n2. Three separate email messages with links to a fake log-in page, (including two factor authentication),\n\none of them hosted on a breached website, the other two on dedicated domains.\n\n3. Two phone calls from the attacker, designed to build rapport for one of the phishing emails.\n\n4. Numerous attempts to take over cloud accounts using their Account Recovery mechanism.\n\n5. Numerous messages on Facebook and by e-mail.\n\nWhile we describe this case mostly from the point of view of a single target, we would like to emphasize that\nthese scenarios repeated themselves for many other targets.\n\n###### Part 1 -spear phish #1 - with malware\n\nIn May 2015 a legitimate email was sent asking several researchers to fill out a form that was sent as a Word\ndocument. The attackers obtained this correspondence, presumably by breaching the email account of the\nsender. They created a new Gmail account with a username similar to that of the original sender. Then, they\nsent the recipients a follow-up message (including the initial correspondence), asking them to fill up the\nattached form again. This time, the attachment was a weaponized Microsoft Excel file (The file is analyzed in\nthe “Malware analysis” chapter of this report).\n\nIn other cases the attackers used the same methods - sending malware or phishing from a cloud email\nservice (such as Gmail or Hotmail) using a username similar to that used by one of the target’s\nacquaintances.\n\nThe malicious email was written in the original language of the correspondence - Hebrew. But it is clear that\nthe attackers do not know Hebrew, as they made grammatical errors in the few words they have added to it\n(the rest were copied from the original email). Other messages, in English and Farsi, were analyzed by\nseveral specialists[3]and were determined to have been written by a native Iranian Persian speaker.\n\n2 The interview revolved around “her own way to being a linguist and an Iranist, and promoting her books \"The Good,\nthe Bad and the World - a Journey to Pre-Islamic Iran\" and \"The Book of Esther, Unmasked\" “.\n\n3Three of the targets are Iran and the Middle East researchers, and two of them are native Farsi speakers. Going\nthrough numerous messages they have received, and in one case a phone call - they have determined that the\nwriter/speaker is native in Iranian Persian.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 4 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is an example of another case (the email includes the professional signature of the impersonated\nsender):\n\n###### Part 2 - phone calls to victims\n\nA week later, the attackers called the target’s office number. The office manager, who received the call, later\nsaid that someone with “bad English” had asked to schedule an interview. The attackers later called the\ntarget’s personal cell phone, and left a similar message with a callback number in London.\n\nThe attackers called the targets in other cases as well. For example, after breaching the password of a victim\nback in November 2014, the attacker called, pretending to be the assistant of a professor abroad who\nwished to talk to the victim. After several “unexplained” cut-offs during the call, the attacker said they\nshould switch to Google Hangout, asking for the “conversation code” the victim had just received to his cell\nphone. The code was actually the second factor authentication for the victim’s Gmail account. As soon as he\ngave it away - the attackers took over his Gmail, Facebook and other accounts.\n\n###### Part 3 - spear phishing #2\n\n[That evening, the target received an email written in Farsi, coming from a spoofed persian@bbc.co.uk email](mailto:persian@bbc.co.uk)\naddress (the real address of BBC Farsi). The message was a follow up on the call that morning, asking to\nschedule the interview for the next day:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 5 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nThe headers of the message indicate that it was spoofed, and was actually sent from a server in Hungary,\n**mail5.maxer.hu.**\n\nThe email contained a linked text, Document.pdf, with this URL:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http://login-users.com/Drive**Auto/AutoSecond?Chk=<redacted>&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=<redacted>**\n\nThe URL is composed of two parts. The first part is a legitimate Google.com address, with the q= parameter.\nThe second part is the value of that parameter - a fake Google Drive log-in page in the attackers controlled\ndomain - login-users.com. Upon clicking the link, the target is redirected to the address in the q= parameter.\nThis is a trick the attackers use to mislead the target - making her think she is about to visit a legitimate\nGoogle website.\n\nThe fake Google Drive log-in page was customized to the target; her real username was already filled in:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 6 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Whois information for the domain is similar to those used in legitimate Google owned domain, except\nfor the ‘d’ instead of ‘b’ in the “registrant-email” value: gmail-aduse@google.com:\n\nThe attacker sent three follow-up emails to make sure the target had received the first one, from the same\nserver in Hungary and with the Reply-To address saeed.kn2003@gmail.com.\n\n###### Part 4 - breaking into an Israeli research institute to set up phising page #3\n\nThe next morning, several targets received an email inviting them to participate in an \"Iran Israel Forum” of\nan Israeli research institute. The email can be seen below (sensitive information has been redacted):\n\nThe headers of the email indicate that they the email was not spoofed, and had been sent from the research\ninstitute. As can be seen, the email contained various grammatical mistakes. Moreover, anyone who knows\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 7 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nthe institute would notice that parts of the message are inaccurate (this will not be elaborated here in order\nnot to expose the institute’s identity).\n\nThe words “Access To Forum” linked to a page within the real, compromised, website of the institute. The\npage contained more information about the “forum”, and offered four “sign in” options, as can be seen in\nthe screenshot below:\n\nClicking one of the sign-in options led to a custom made log-in page, again, with the target’s username,\nemail, and picture already present:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 8 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter submitting a password, the victim is taken to the next fake page in which she is asked to submit the\ntwo factor authentication code she has just received to her phone:\n\nUpon submission, the victim is redirected to a static “registration confirmed” page.\n\nInterestingly, the log file for the previous pages was hosted publicly on the same virtual folder. The log\ncontained the false credentials the target submitted (as she recognized this was a fake)[4]:\n\nWe reported the breach to the institue, and they investigated and cleaned it off. They informed us that their\nown servers were never breached. Rather, a server run by a researcher who was givenn a “virtual folder”\nwithin their domain was. This, of course, did not change the end result - the attackers managed to implant a\nfake page within the Instititue domain, and were able to send an email using the same domain. This pattern\nis recurring: The attackrs go after “low hanging fruits” in order to reach their goal rather than using\nadvnaced techincal means.\n\n###### Part 5 - spear phishing #4\n\nFour days later, the target received the following email from the same fake address as in part 1:\n\n4 The “pass” filed intermingled with the IP filed in the original log, file due to bidirectionality issues.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 9 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email contained the real textual signature of the sender, and the word Toda (Thank you, in Hebrew), as\nthe sender usually writes.\n\nThe hyperlink text in the message appeared to be leading to youtube.com, but in fact linked to a fake\naddress that only looked like a YouTube domain.\n\nThe page contained a “private Youtube video”, asking the viewer to sign in in order to watch it:\n\nAfter signing in, the page redirected to a specific interview in target’s real YouTube channel - proving once\nagain that the attacks are targeted and based on reconnaissance.\n\n###### Part 6 - Abusing account recovery mechanisms\n\nDuring the writing of this article, the attackers continued to attempt to take over various accounts of the\ntarget. For example, they tried to fool Google into giving them access to the target’s Gmail accounts using\nthe Google Account Recovery process[5] (a process which in certain cases enables one to regain access to an\naccount even if the password and other means of authentication are unavailable).\n\nThe attackers tried similar methods against the target’s account on Facebook and Yahoo, and had also set up\na fake Hotmail account, which was used as the secondary email to which the recovered password should be\nsent.\n\n###### Part 7 - Private messages\n\nThe target has been contacted by various “weird” characters on Facebook and by e-mail. They have been\nasking her various questions that have nothing to do with her professional expertise and tried to contact her\nin various ways. The conversation are conducted in Persian.\n\nWe cannot find a direct connection between these Facebook characters and the above mentioned attacks.\nHowever, in addition to them happening close to the attacks, we do know that at least one of the accounts is\nfake.\n\n[5https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery/](https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery/)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the fake characters who has engaged in conversation, is using throughout her profile pictures of a\nRussian model, and has presented herself as with different, contradicting, background stories in\nconversations with different targets.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 11 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targets and further incidents\n\n\n#### Targets\n\nSo far we have exposed a list of more than 500 targets by name and email.\n\nThe targets come, mostly, from the following fields:\n\n  - Both Academic researchers and practitioners in the fields of counter-terror, diplomacy, international\nrelations, Iran and Middle East, and other fields, such as Physics.\n\n  - Security and defence.\n\n  - Journalists and Human rights activists.\n\n  - Other similar fields.\nIn some cases the attackers tried to breach the account of a relative or colleague of the real target.\nBelow is the target distribution by country:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 12 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Further incidents\n\nWe have investigated and can publicly mention the following incident by the same threat actor:\n\n  - A security company had numerous employees targeted with customized phishing pages. The attackers\nmanaged to infect computers within the company and steal information. In several other cases\nnumerous employees from the same organization were targeted.\n\n  - A fake Gmail account was set up using the name of the head of a research center. Following, several\nof his contacts received targeted phishing email from the fake account.\n\n  - A fake domain has been set up, imitating that of the “Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya”, an Israeli\ncollege (unrelated to the research institute described above), and has been used in attacks.\n\nThe table below correlates between the threat actor behind the Thamar Reservoir campaign and the name\nof threat actor or campaign, as given in other reports:\n\n**Threat actor / campaign** **Correlations** **Certainty**\n\n**Gholee[6] by Clearsky** Overlapping infrastructure and malware.

We assume, though do not have direct evidence, that it is being supported by the Iranian regime, or\nperformed by the Regime itself:\n\n  - The context of the attacks and cover stories all revolve around Iran. Importantly, as determined by\nseveral professionals - the attackers speak and write in native Iranian Persian and make mistakes\ncharacteristic of Persian speakers. In one of the hacked accounts, when retrieved, the interface\nlanguage had been changed to Persian.\n\n  - The targets and victims match the interests of Iran. Moreover, rather than stealing money or\nperforming high key “cyber terror” attacks (such as information leaks or deferments), the attackers\nonly steal information and use the access to computers for further attacks - indicating espionage, IP\ntheft, etc.\n\n  - The TTPs match those of attackers and attacks that were attributed to Iran by other security\ncompanies, as mentioned in the previous chapter.\n\n  - Some of the domains and IPs used by the attackers in the cases we investigated were mentioned and\nattributed to an “Iranian threat group” in an advisory by the Financial Sector Cyber Intelligence Group,\nand the Department of the Treasury, CIG Circular 35[10]\n\n[10http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dzV7dGdsTU8J:theatre.fsu.edu/index.php/content/downlo](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dzV7dGdsTU8J:theatre.fsu.edu/index.php/content/download/208893/1786893/file/20150311_WASP.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=il)\n[ad/208893/1786893/file/20150311_WASP.pdf](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dzV7dGdsTU8J:theatre.fsu.edu/index.php/content/download/208893/1786893/file/20150311_WASP.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=il)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 14 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware analysis\n\n\nThe malicious Excel file (mentioned in ‘Part 1 - speared email message containing malware’) serve as a\nDropper - it creates two files and runs them. When opening the excel file (.xlsb), the user sees a blank sheet\nand the standard \"Macros have been disabled” message. If enabled by the user, the macro drops\n**NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe and tmp.bat. The content of the excel sheet is then presented. It is case specific and**\ncustomized to the victim.\n\nDifferent malware can be downloaded to the infected computer. On an infected computer we have\nanalyzed, we found CWoolger Keylogger.\n\nThe macro, two files, and CWoolger are analyzed below.\n\n#### Macro\n\nThe VBA macro is similar to that used to drop Gholee, as we reported about 8 month ago[11]. However, in\ncurrent case, a simple downloader was used instead of Gholee.\n\nThe VBA contains a series of functions built of VBA Character Codes:\n\nThese are constructed into a single variable and then written as a file to disc, creating and running\nNTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe\n\nNext, tmp.bat is written and executed.\n\n[11http://www.clearskysec.com/gholee-a-protective-edge-themed-spear-phishing-campaign](http://www.clearskysec.com/gholee-a-protective-edge-themed-spear-phishing-campaign/)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 15 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n#### tmp.bat\n\nTmp.Bat contains two lines. The first create a registry key without prompting the user for permission, telling\nthe computer to run NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exefrom %USERPROFILE% every time the computer starts, naming it\n“My App”. For example:\n\nREG ADD \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /V \"My App\" /t REG_SZ /F /D\n\"C:\\Users\\Nisa\\NTUSER.dat{813E7E06-2AC5-4F3D-94DA-CF6E298F7B18}.exe\"\n\nThe second line deletes tmp.bat.\n\n#### NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe\n\nThe dropped exe file (55ff220e38556ff902528ac984fc72dc) is a Downloader.

However, we have performed forensic analysis of the computer used by a\ntarget who opened the malicious Excel file.\n\nThat computer was infected with CWoolger keylogger. An analysis of this tool can be read in Trendmicro’s\npaper “Operation WOOLEN-GOLDFISH”[13] in chapter “Wool3n.H4t’s Recent Activities: CWoolger Keylogger”.\n\nBelow are additional notes about the infection we found:\n\n[12virustotal.com/en/file/072a43123e755ad1bdd159488a85a353227ec51f273c4f79c26ff7e4656c0ef4/analysis/](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/072a43123e755ad1bdd159488a85a353227ec51f273c4f79c26ff7e4656c0ef4/analysis/)\n13 [http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-woolen-](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-woolen-goldfish.pdf)\n[goldfish.pdf](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-woolen-goldfish.pdf)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 16 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The CWoolger exe file was located in %appdata%\\microsoft\\windows\\templates\\wlg.exe\n\n  - To gain persistency, a link to the exe file was placed in in the Startup folder, with the name\n“WinDefender” and the notepad icon.\n\n  - A file containing the collected keystrokes is saved in %temp% in a file called wlg.dat. it is sent to an\nattacker controlled server every 15 minutes.\n\nThese findings are similar to those found by Trendmicro – indicating that the attackers have been using the\nsame tool for months.\n\nWe would like to thank Omri moyal, VP Research at Minerva Labs for assisting the analysis.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 17 of 18\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical indicators and IoC\n\n\n#### Domains\n\nDomains hosting phishing pages:\n\nlogin-users[.]com\ndrives-google[.]co\nqooqle[.]co\nvideo[.]qooqle[.]co\ndrive-google[.]co\ngfimail[.]us\nGoogle-Setting[.]com\nGoogle-Verify[.]com\nMail-Verify[.]com\n\n#### IPs\n\nIPs of phishing pages:\n\n107.6.172.51\n5.39.223.227\n31.192.105.10\n\n#### Malware\n\nDownloader:\n\nMD5  55ff220e38556ff902528ac984fc72dc\nSHA-1 b67572a18282e79974dc61fffb8ca3d0f4fca1b0\nSHA-256 072a43123e755ad1bdd159488a85a353227ec51f273c4f79c26ff7e4656c0ef4\n\nMD5 b4790618672197cab31681994bbc10a4\nSHA1 d5b2b30fe2d4759c199e3659d561a50f88a7fb2e\nSHA-256 1c9e519dca0468a87322bebe2a06741136de7969a4eb3efda0ab8db83f0807b4\n\nMD5 60f5bc820cf38e78b51e1e20fed290b5\nSHA1 476489f75fed479f19bac02c79ce1befc62a6633\nSHA256 69e48eb82ce7387d65cc1a82c5a6a170dc6121d479736b1dd33358d09c483617\n\n#### Malicious Email accounts\n\nFake or breached email accounts, from which malicious messages were sent:\n\nsaeed.kn2003@gmail.com\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 18 of 18\n\n\n-----",
