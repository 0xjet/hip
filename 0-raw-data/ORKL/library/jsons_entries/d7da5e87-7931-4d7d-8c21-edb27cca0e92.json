    "plain_text": "# Ransomware for Dummies: Anyone Can Do It\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/ransomware-for-dummies-anyone-can-do-it/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/ransomware-for-dummies-anyone-can-do-it/)**\n\nAmong today’s fastest-growing cybercrime epidemics is “ransomware,” malicious software\nthat encrypts your computer files, photos, music and documents and then demands payment\nin Bitcoin to recover access to the files. A big reason for the steep increase in ransomware\nattacks in recent years comes from the proliferation of point-and-click tools sold in the\ncybercrime underground that make it stupid simple for anyone to begin extorting others for\nmoney.\n\nRecently, I came across an extremely slick and professionally produced video advertisement\npromoting the features and usability of “Philadelphia,” a ransomware-as-a-service crimeware\npackage that is sold for roughly $400 to would-be cybercriminals who dream of carving out\ntheir own ransomware empires.\n\nThis stunning advertisement does a thorough job of showcasing Philadelphia’s many\nfeatures, including the ability to generate PDF reports and charts of victims “to track your\nmalware campaigns” as well as the ability to plot victims around the world using Google\nMaps.\n\n“Everything just works,” claim the proprietors of Philadelphia. “Get your lifetime copy. One\npayment. Free updates. No monthly fees.”\n\nOne interesting feature of this ransomware package is the ability to grant what the program’s\narchitects call “mercy.” This refers to the desperate and heartbreaking pleas that ransomware\npurveyors often hear from impecunious victims whose infections have jeopardized some\npriceless and irreplaceable data — such as photos of long lost loved ones.\n\nI’ll revisit the authors of this ransomware package in a future post. For now, just check out\ntheir ad. It’s fairly chilling.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5WJ2KHoo5Fo\n\n\n-----",
