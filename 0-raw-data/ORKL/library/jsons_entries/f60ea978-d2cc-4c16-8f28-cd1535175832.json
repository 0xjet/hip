The PE file is 36,684 bytes and was compiled on January 5, 2018.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe malware copies itself to the following folder on a user’s computer:\n\n_C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Roaming\\DP\\_\n\nThe executable adds the reference to itself in the Autorun Windows registry key as the following value:\n\n_‘DP_Main’ = ‘c:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Roaming\\DP\\DP_Main.exe’_\n\nParadise\n\nRansomware Installation\n\n## Key generation\n\nThe [ransomware creates ‘DecryptionInfo.auth’ file in the following folders:](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/ransomware-protection/)\n\n%USER%\\\n%USER%\\Desktop\\\nProgram Files\\\n\nThe key file contains the session RSA private key in the XML format, encrypted with the master RSA public key and Base64 encoded:\n\nParadise Ransomware - Key\n\ngeneration Paradise Ransomware - Key generation 2\n\nTh t RSA 1024 bit bli k i h d d d i B 64\n\n\n-----\n\n_S_ _ey a ue_ _odu us u_ _Q_ _d 0y8_ _s_ _8gg_ _8_ _U b uQt u_ _3 9_ _J_ _6 3 gqt9_ _p S_ _t eQ_ _G O 0_ _5q S_\n_</Modulus><Exponent>AQAB</Exponent></RSAKeyValue>_\n\n## File encryption\n\nThe Paradise ransomware encrypts ALL files on fixed, removable, and network drives.\n\nIt filters out the folders that contain the following strings:\n\nwindows\nfirefox\nopera\nchrome\ngoogle\nThe Application Data folder where the cryptolocker lives\n\nThe cryptolocker does not encrypt the files that contain the following strings:\n\n.paradise\n#DECRYPT MY FILES#.html\nId.dp\nDecryptionInfo.auth\n\nIt first encrypts the files in any folders that contain the following strings:\n\nmysql\nfirebird\nmssql\nmicrosoft sql\nbackup\n\nThe cryptolocker renames a file adding the following suffix: “[id-<USER_ID>].[AFFILIATE_EMAIL].paradise”\n\nFor example:\n\n_[file.exe[id-iO3mBQGY].[paradise@all-ransomware.info].paradise](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:paradise@all-ransomware.info)_\n\nParadise uses the RSA cipher, and the generated session key pairs to the encrypt file’s content, divided in blocks of 547 bytes.\n\nParadise Ransomware - encryption\n\n## Communication\n\nOnce the encryption is completed, the malicious process sends a notification request to the remote server.\n\nThe sent data includes:\n\nThe number of encrypted files\nThe computer’s name\nElapsed time\nDecryption info\nThe computer’s ID\n\nParadise Ransomware - remote notification\n\nAnalyzed versions of the ransomware connect to ‘localhost’ only. The ransomware config contains ‘localhost’ as the C&C server, which could\nmean that either the feature was deprecated or setting the server data in config was forgotten.\n\n## Backup removal\n\n\n-----\n\na ad se s e t y de etes do s s ado cop es, e a y ot e a so a e a a ts cu e t y t e d\n\nParadise Ransomware - backup removal\n\n## Ransom note\n\nIn every folder, the cryptolocker leaves the ransom note ‘#DECRYPT MY FILES#.html’\n\nParadise Ransom Note 2\n\nParadise Ransom Note\n\n\n-----\n\n## ec ypt o se ce\n\nThe ransom note includes a contact email address:\n\n_paradise@all-ransomware.info_\n\nThe user can send up to three files with non-sensitive information – together with the ID and personal RSA key – to this email address to test\nthe decryption service. Each file should be less than 1 MB in size. One of the files will be decrypted as proof that decryption is possible. The\nransom value will be set in bitcoin and can vary based on when the user replies or the number of encrypted files.\n\nThe domain ‘all-ransomware.info’ has roots on Russia, according to WhoIs data:\n\nParadise Ransomware - domain\n\nThe server is geographically located in St Petersburg.\n\nParadise Ransomware - location\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is no way to restore encrypted files other than to pay a ransom. The files are encrypted using a session public RSA key and require\nsession private RSA key, which is encrypted along with the master public RSA key. The session RSA private key can be decrypted only with\nthe master private RSA key, which is held by the criminals.\n\nThe only free alternative that is recommend is to restore files from backup, if available, after the infected computer has been cleaned.\n\n## Acronis True Image detects and blocks Paradise as well\n\n[Rather than waiting to react after Paradise encrypts your files, you can use Acronis True Image 2018 and our other products with Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/personal/computer-backup/)\nActive Protection enabled to detect and stop Paradise ransomware. You’ll also be able to restore any affected files in matter of seconds.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware detected by Acronis\n\nAcronis restores files\n\n\n[CybersecurityCyber protection](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/tags/cybersecurity/)\n\n\n-----",
