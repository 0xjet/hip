The company has confirmed that this was due to unauthorized access carried\n\n\n-----\n\nout by a third party, and that it has halted some operations of its internal networks as of\nNovember 2.\"\n\nSince the attack, Capcom has been displaying notices on its site warning visitors that\nemails and document requests will not be answered due to the attack impacting email\nsystems.\n\n**Notice about email being down**\nAt the time, Capcom did not disclose the details of the cyberattack, but in a ransomware\n[sample found by security researcher Pancak3 we see that the Ragnar Locker ransomware](https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz)\ngang attacked them.\n\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n## Ransomware gang claims to have stolen 1 TB of files\n\nAfter running the Ragnar Locker sample, we get access to the ransom note created on\nCapcom's computers during the attack. This ransom note provides a huge amount of\nvisibility into the Ragnar Locker attack.\n\nIn the ransom note created during the attack, the Ragnar Locker operators state that they\nhave stolen 1 TB of unencrypted files from the corporate networks in Japan, the USA, and\nCanada.\n\nWe have BREACHED your security perimeter and get access to every server of company's\nNetwork in different offices located in Japan, USA, Canada.\n\nSo we has DOWNLOADED more than 1TB total volume of your PRIVATE SENSITIVE\nData, including:\n\n-Accounting files, Banking Statements, Budget and Revenue files classified as Confidential,\nTax Documents\n\n-Intellectual Property, Proprietary Business information, Clients and Employees Personal\ninformation (Such as Passports and Visa), Incidents Acts\n\n-Corporate Agreements and Contracts, Non-Disclosure Agreements, Confidential\nAgreements, Sales Summaries\n\n\n-----\n\n-Also we have your Private Corporate Correspondence, Emails and Messanger\nConversations, Marketing presentations, Audit reports and a lot of other Sensitive\nInformation\n\nIf NO Deal made than all your Data will be Published and/or Sold through an auction to any\nthird-parties\n\n**Capcom ransom note**\nEnclosed in the ransom note are seven print.sc URLs that display screenshots of stolen\nfiles, including employee termination agreements, Japanese passports, Steam sales reports\nfrom August, Bank statements, contractor agreements, and a screenshot of Active Directory\nUsers and Computers MMC for the Capcom Windows domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stolen Capcom August 2020 Steam sales report**\n\nRedacted by BleepingComputer\nAlso enclosed in the ransom note is a link to a private data leak page on Ragnar Locker's\nwebsite containing a 24MB archive containing additional stolen documents,\nincluding revenue forecasts, salary spreadsheets, NDAs, immigration forms, corporate\ncommunications, and royalty reports.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Capcom temporary data leak page**\nThe ransom note contains a link to the Ragnar Locker Tor negotiation site, where\nCapcom can discuss the ransom demand with the attackers. At this time, the chat page has\nnot been used by Capcom, so there is no indication as to the ransom amount Ragnar\nLocker is demanding.\n\nPancak3 told BleepingComputer tonight that Ragnar Locker claims to have encrypted 2,000\ndevices on Capcom's networks and are demanding $11,000,000 in bitcoins for a decryptor.\n\nThis ransom also includes a promise to delete any stolen data and a network penetration\nsecurity report.\n\n[It should be noted that ransomware negotiation service Coveware has seen ransomware](https://www.coveware.com/)\n[operations increasingly not keeping their promise to delete stolen data after a ransom is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scam-psa-ransomware-gangs-dont-always-delete-stolen-data-when-paid/)\npaid.\n\n\n-----\n\nRagnar Locker has been involved in other massive attacks this year, including ones on\nPortuguese multinational energy giant Energias de Portugal (EDP), where a $10.9M\nransom was demanded. In September, they hit French maritime transport and logistics\n[company CMA CGM, which led to significant downtime for the network and operations.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/logistics-giant-cma-cgm-goes-offline-to-block-malware-attack/)\n\nBleepingComputer has attempted to contact Capcom but has not received a response due\nto their email issues.\n\n**Update 11/5/20 7:00 PM EST: Added information on ransom amount.**\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Capcom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/capcom/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Games](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/games/)\n[Ragnar Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ragnar-locker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
