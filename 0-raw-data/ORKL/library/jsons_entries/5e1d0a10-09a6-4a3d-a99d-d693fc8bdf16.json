    "plain_text": "# Hainan Xiandun Technology Company is APT40\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/15/hainan-xiandun-technology-company-is-apt40](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/15/hainan-xiandun-technology-company-is-apt40)**\n\nintrusiontruth January 15, 2020\n\nYou knew where this was heading.\n\nIn our previous articles we identified a constellation of front companies for APT activity in\nHainan and a computer science specialist at Hainan University who is linked to one of the\ncompanies. We named the individuals that we could identify as working for these companies,\nincluding one that we know to be Hainan resident Ding Xiaoyang who had used his\ntelephone number on a job advert using the name ‘Mr Chen’.\n\nHaving identified a network of interlinked technology and information security companies in\nHainan, looking at other job adverts posted by the companies is illuminating…\n\n**South China Sea Penetration (Testing)**\n\nConsidering these are high-tech companies advertising for penetration testers, software\ndevelopment engineers, and network engineers, of course the logical next set of job adverts\nthat we expected to find were for … specialist translators?\n\nHainan Xiandun posted multiple adverts for English translators between 2014 and 2018,\nsuch as [this one on the Hainan University website:](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/stm/waiguoyu_XG/2017328/10475388.shtml)\n\n\n-----\n\nHainan Xiandun advert looking for English translators\nAn English language translation service in-house at a high-tech firm may meet a legitimate\nbusiness need. Less likely is for a Hainan technology firm to need its own in-house\nCambodian linguists. But, in March and April 2018, Hainan Xiandun was recruiting\nCambodian linguists to join their team. Remember those dates, they will be important later.\n\nHainan Xiandun advert looking for Cambodian linguists in early 2018\nAdditionally, a spreadsheet published by the Shanghai International Studies University\nshows that Hainan Tengyuan was advertising for Indonesian and English translators\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd of course let’s not forget Sugar, who we previously identified as a Vietnamese translator\nat Hainan Kehua.\n\n**APT40**\n\nWhich brings us to [this report by FireEye on TEMP.Periscope, also know as APT40.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\n\nFireEye has examined a range of TEMP.Periscope activity revealing extensive interest\nin Cambodia’s politics, with active compromises of multiple Cambodian entities related\nto the country’s electoral system. This includes compromises of Cambodian\ngovernment entities charged with overseeing the elections, as well as the targeting of\nopposition figures. This campaign occurs in the run up to the country’s July 29, 2018,\ngeneral elections. TEMP.Periscope used the same infrastructure for a range of activity\nagainst other more traditional targets, including the defense industrial base in the\nUnited States and a chemical company based in Europe. Our previous blog post\nfocused on the group’s [targeting of engineering and maritime entities in the United](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/jp-threat-research/2018/03/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries.html)\nStates.\n\nThe report shows a world map highlighting the targets of APT40. This includes a number of\nEnglish speaking countries, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Cambodia.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT40 conducted a series of compromises of Cambodian targets in the run up to the July\n2018 Cambodian election. Did you remember those dates? Between March and April 2018\nHainan Xiandun, a front company with specialist network and penetration engineers, was\nrecruiting Cambodian linguists.\n\n**112[.]66[.]188[.]28**\n\nFireEye have [also reported that APT40 actors are based in China, using computers](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor.html)\nconfigured with Chinese language settings.\n\nThis report also shows APT40 using IP address 112[.]66[.]188[.]28 which resolves to, guess\nwhere, Hainan.\n\n\n-----\n\n**So what?**\n\nMr Ding and Mr Gu could be busy Hainan based individuals simultaneously running multiple\ncompanies that have specialisms spanning from penetration testing and software\ndevelopment to the translation of Cambodian guidebooks and Indonesian literature.\n\nBut they aren’t.\n\n**Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Company is APT40.**\n\n**Hainan Xiandun, and the other front companies that we have identified, recruit**\n**hackers to compromise overseas targets and linguists to help them with their attacks**\n**and translate their stolen material. Industry reporting shows APT40 has used an IP**\n**address in Hainan and attacked South East Asian targets.**\n\n**Mr Gu brings the academic links, but what does Mr Ding bring?**\n\n\n-----",
