stealer\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-valorant-cheats-on-youtube-infect-you-with-redline-stealer/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-valorant-cheats-on-youtube-infect-you-with-redline-stealer/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nMarch 13, 2022\n10:06 AM\n0\n\nKorean security analysts have spotted a malware distribution campaign that uses Valorant\ncheat lures on YouTube to trick players into downloading RedLine, a powerful information\nstealer.\n\n[This type of abuse is quite common, as the threat actors find it easy to bypass YouTube's](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-campaign-uses-youtube-to-push-password-stealing-malware/)\nnew content submission reviews or create new accounts when reported and blocked.\n\n[The campaign spotted by ASEC targets the gaming community of Valorant, a free first-](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/32499/)\nperson shooter for Windows, offering a link to download an auto-aiming bot on the video\ndescription.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Video promoting fake auto-aiming bot** _(ASEC)_\nThese cheats are allegedly add-ons installed in the game to help the players aim at\nenemies with speed and precision, winning headshots without demonstrating any skill.\n\nAuto-aiming bots are highly sought-after for popular multiplayer games like Valorant\nbecause they allow effortless ranking progression.\n\n## Dropping Redline\n\nUsers who attempt to download the file in the video's description will be taken to an\nanonfiles page from where they'll get a RAR archive that contains an executable named\n\"Cheat installer.exe\".\n\nThis file is, in reality, a copy of RedLine stealer, one of the most [widely deployed password-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/have-i-been-pwned-adds-441k-accounts-stolen-by-redline-malware/)\nstealing malware infections that snatch the following data from infected systems:\n\n**Basic information: Computer name, user name, IP address, Windows version,**\nsystem information (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.), and list of processes\n**Web browsers: Passwords, credit card numbers, AutoFill forms, bookmarks, and**\ncookies, from Chrome, Chrome-based browsers, and Firefox\n**Cryptocurrency wallets: Armory, AtomicWallet, BitcoinCore, Bytecoin, DashCore,**\nElectrum, Ethereum, LitecoinCore, Monero, Exodus, Zcash, and Jaxx\n\n\n-----\n\n**VPN clients: ProtonVPN, OpenVPN, and NordVPN**\n**Others: FileZilla (host address, port number, user name, and passwords), Minecraft**\n(account credentials, level, ranking), Steam (client session), Discord (token\ninformation)\n\nAfter collecting this information, RedLine neatly packs it in a ZIP archive named \"().zip\"\nand exfiltrates the files via a WebHook API POST request to a Discord server.\n\n**Exfiltrating stolen information via Discord WebHook** _(ASEC)_\n\n## Don't trust links in YouTube videos\n\nApart from the fact that cheating in video games takes the fun out of playing and ruins the\ngame for others, it is always a potentially severe security risk.\n\nNone of these cheat tools are authored by trustworthy entities, none are digitally signed (so\nAV warnings are bound to be ignored), and many are indeed malware.\n\nASEC's report contains a recent example, but that's just a drop in the sea of malicious\ndownload links under YouTube videos that promote free software of various types.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe videos that promote these tools are often stolen from elsewhere and are re-posted from\nmalicious users on newly created channels to act as lures.\n\nEven if the comments below these videos praise the uploader and claim the tool works as\npromised, they should not be trusted as these can easily be faked.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim's crypto
