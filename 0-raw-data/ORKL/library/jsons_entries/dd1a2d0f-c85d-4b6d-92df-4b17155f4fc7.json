Emotet, the ubiquitous\nbotnet that arrives in the guise of any of a thousand different bogus email messages, never\nreally went away when it suddenly stopped appearing in our internal records and feeds of\nspam emails in February.\n\nThe sudden disappearance of the malware gave rise to a lot of rumors that the creators had\nbeen arrested, or contracted COVID-19, or simply had retired and planned to live the good\nlife on the Black Sea coast. But these theories were squashed on July 17th, when we saw a\nnew wave of Emotet attacks swing back into action.\n\n\n-----\n\nSenior threat researcher and manager of the Abingdon, UK detection team, Richard Cohen,\nwrote this about its resurgence last week.\n\n[We’ve talked a lot about Emotet in the past, including showing its malware ecosystem,](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2019/12/02/emotets-central-position-in-the-malware-ecosystem/)\n[and providing a series of deep-dive 101s, not forgetting showing the authors venting](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2019/03/05/emotet-101-stage-1-the-spam-lure/)\ntheir frustration at Sophos. But then in February 2020, Emotet ceased production – its\nbotnets stopped activity, and the waves of spam campaigns went silent. This isn’t the\nfirst time it’s vanished off the radar, only to rise again months later – and that’s exactly\nwhat we saw again last Friday.\n\nUnfortunately, Emotet is not merely a tool for thievery, but the botnet acts as a delivery\nmechanism for other malware, walking it through firewall over the encrypted channels it\ncreates, bypassing network-based defenses.\n\nAs a result, we’ve investigated many, many cases in which a large-scale ransomware\ninfection began as the result of this simple but effective Trojan lying undetected for a period\nof time, before the infected computer was used as a staging area for a larger attack against\nthe company or organization on whose network it insinuated itself.\n\nRichard goes on to write:\n\nEmotet’s fundamental MO hasn’t changed, as you can see from Microsoft Security\nIntelligence’s tweets. And the protection SophosLabs has been building against\ndifferent stages of these attacks remains strong.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese defenses work remarkably well. In fact, they work so well that the malware s creators\nadded a small plaintext note to the source code letting us know just how much they\nappreciate Sophos’ efforts at combatting their infections.\n\nOthers appear to be getting into the fight as well. For a short period of time over the past\nweekend, some researchers observed that payloads being accessed by Emotet had been\n[replaced with animated GIFs on the compromised, legitimate servers the threat actor prefers](https://doublepulsar.com/emotet-being-hijacked-by-another-actor-b22414352a7b)\nto use for hosting payloads. To be sure, it was an interesting play, but ultimately futile, since\nthe Emotet gang can read the tea leaves and see when they aren’t getting the result they\nintended.\n\nThe most recent versions of Emotet’s malicious Office documents use Apple’s iOS as an\nexcuse to convince you to enable scripted content. Don’t do it!\n\n\n-----\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the Emotet gang has not changed their same, fundamental\nplaybook they’ve followed for years. If you receive an email from an unknown source, or\nunexpectedly from a known source, with a Microsoft Office file attached, be extremely careful\nabout opening it. In a related vein, if you receive an email that tells you to download such a\nfile attachment in order to receive some sort of invoice or statement, be extremely\nsuspicious.\n\nIn either case, check with the sender (if they are known to you) to ensure the file is legitimate\n**before you open it. And if the document prompts you to enable advanced features like**\nscripting, that’s a huge red flag you should not ignore.\n\n## Detection\n\nSophos products detect Emotet or its components or payloads under a number of malware\ndefinitions:\n\n**Mal/DocDl-K & Mal/DocDl-L on the initial document downloaders**\n**AMSI/Exec-P* on the behaviour of those downloaders**\n**ML/PE-A* from Deep Learning on the executable payloads**\n**CXmal/Emotet-C on those payloads seen in their malicious context**\n**HPmal/Emotet-D on the behaviour of those payloads**\nWe also have Troj/Emotet-CJW for Friday’s wave of polymorphic payloads.\n\n_* available in Sophos Central Intercept X Advanced on Windows 10_\n\n\n-----",
