These markets in the deep web\ncommoditize malware operations. Even novice cybercriminals can buy malware toolkits and\nother services they might need for malware campaigns: encryption, hosting, antimalware\nevasion, spamming, and many others.\n\nHawkeye Keylogger is an info-stealing malware that’s being sold as malware-as-a-service.\nOver the years, the malware authors behind Hawkeye have improved the malware service,\nadding new capabilities and techniques. It was last used in a high-volume campaign in 2016.\n\nThis year marked the resurgence of Hawkeye. In April, malware authors started peddling a\nnew version of the malware that they called Hawkeye Keylogger – Reborn v8. Not long after,\n[on April 30, Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (Office 365 ATP) detected a high-volume](https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/online-email-threat-protection?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\ncampaign that distributed the latest variants of this keylogger.\n\nAt the onset, Office 365 ATP blocked the email campaign and protected customers, 52% of\nwhom are in the software and tech sector. Companies in the banking (11%), energy (8%),\nchemical (5%), and automotive (5%) industries are also among the top targets\n\n_Figure 1. Top industries targeted by the April 2018 Hawkeye campaign_\n\n\n-----\n\nOffice 365 ATP uses intelligent systems that inspect attachments and links for malicious\ncontent to protect customers against threats like Hawkeye in real time. These automated\n[systems include a robust detonation platform, heuristics, and machine learning models.](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/05/10/enhancing-office-365-advanced-threat-protection-with-detonation-based-heuristics-and-machine-learning/)\nOffice 365 ATP uses intelligence from various sensors, including multiple capabilities in\n[Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP).](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\n\nWindows Defender AV (a component of Windows Defender ATP) detected and blocked the\nmalicious attachments used in the campaign in at least 40 countries. United Arab Emirates\naccounted for 19% of these file encounters, while the Netherlands (15%), the US (11%),\nSouth Africa (6%) and the UK (5%) make the rest of the top 5 countries that saw the lure\ndocuments used in the campaign. A combination of generic and heuristic protections in\n[Windows Defender AV (TrojanDownloader:O97M/Donoff,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=TrojanDownloader:O97M/Donoff) [Trojan:Win32/Tiggre!rfn,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:Win32/Tiggre!rfn)\n[Trojan:Win32/Bluteal!rfn,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:Win32/Bluteal!rfn) [VirTool:MSIL/NetInject.A) ensured these threats are blocked in](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=VirTool:MSIL/NetInject.A)\ncustomer environments.\n\n_Figure 2. Top countries that encountered malicious documents used in the Hawkeye_\n_campaign_\n\nAs part of our job to protect customers from malware attacks, Office 365 ATP researchers\nmonitor malware campaigns like Hawkeye and other developments in the cybercriminal\nlandscape. Our in-depth investigation into malware campaigns like Hawkeye and many\nothers adds to the vast threat intelligence we get from the Microsoft Intelligent Security\nGraph, which enables us to continuously raise the bar in security. Through the Intelligent\nSecurity Graph, security technologies in Microsoft 365 share signals and detections, allowing\nthese technologies to automatically update protection and detection mechanisms, as well as\norchestrate remediation across Microsoft 365.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Microsoft 365 threat protection against Hawkeye_\n\n## Campaign overview\n\nDespite its name, Hawkeye Keylogger – Reborn v8 is more than a common keylogger. Over\ntime, its authors have integrated various modules that provide advanced functionalities like\nstealth and detection evasion, as well as credential theft and more.\n\nMalware services like Hawkeye are advertised and sold in the deep web, which requires\nanonymity networks like Tor to access, etc. Interestingly, the Hawkeye authors advertised\ntheir malware and even published tutorial videos on a website on the surface web (that has\nsince been taken down). Even more interesting, based on underground forums, it appears\nthe malware authors have employed intermediary resellers, an example of how cybercriminal\nunderground business models expand and evolve.\n\nOur investigation into the April 2018\nHawkeye campaign shows that the\ncybercriminals have been preparing for\nthe operation since February, when they\nregistered the domains they later used in\nthe campaign.\n\nTypical of malware campaigns, the\ncybercriminals undertook the following\nsteps:\n\nBuilt malware samples and\nmalware configuration files using a\nmalware builder they acquired from\nthe underground\nBuilt weaponized documents to be\nused a social engineering lure\n(possibly by using another tool bought in the underground)\nPacked or obfuscated the samples (using a customized open-source packer)\nRegistered domains for delivery of malware\n\n\n-----\n\nLaunched a spam campaign (possibly using a paid spam service) to distribute the\nmalware\n\nLike other malware toolkits, Hawkeye comes with an admin panel that cybercriminals use to\nmonitor and control the attack.\n\n_Figure 4: Hawkeye’s admin panel_\n\nInterestingly, some of the methods used in this Hawkeye campaign are consistent with\nprevious attacks. This suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign may be the\nsame group responsible for malware operations that delivered the remote access tool (RAT)\nRemcos and the info-stealing bot malware Loki. The following methods were used in these\ncampaigns:\n\nMultiple documents that create a complicated, multi-stage delivery chain\nRedirections using shortened bit.ly links\nUse of malicious macro, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts to run the malware; the\nRemcos campaign employed an exploit for CVE-2017-0199 but used the same\ndomains\nConsistent obfuscation technique across multiple samples\n\n## Point of entry\n\nIn late April, Office 365 ATP analysts spotted a new spam campaign with the subject line\n_RFQ-GHFD456 ADCO 5647 deadline 7th May carrying a Word document attachment named_\n_Scan Copy 001.doc. While the attachment’s file name extension was .doc, it was in fact a_\nmalicious Office Open XML format document, which usually uses a .docx file name\nextension.\n\nIn total, the campaign used four different subject lines and five attachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Sample emails used in the Hawkeye campaign_\n\nBecause the attachment contains malicious code, Microsoft Word opens with a security\nwarning. The document uses a common social engineering lure: it displays a fake message\nand an instruction to “Enable editing” and “Enable content”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: The malicious document with social engineering lure_\n\nThe document contains an embedded frame that connects to a remote location using a\nshortened URL.\n\n_Figure 7: frame in settings.rels.xml on the document_\n\nThe frame loads an .rtf file from hxxp://bit[.]ly/Loadingwaitplez, which redirects to\n_hxxp://stevemike-fireforce[.]info/work/doc/10.doc._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: RTF loaded as a frame inside malicious document_\n\nThe RTF has an embedded malicious .xlsx file with macro as an OLE object, which in turn\ncontains a stream named PACKAGE that contains the .xlsx contents.\n\nThe macro script is mostly obfuscated, but the URL to the malware payload is notably in\nplaintext.\n\n_Figure 9: Obfuscated macro entry point_\n\nDe-obfuscating the entire script makes its intention clear. The first section uses PowerShell\nand the System.Net.WebClient object to download the malware to the path\n_C:\\Users\\Public\\svchost32.exe and execute it._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe macro script then terminates both winword.exe and excel.exe. In specific scenarios\nwhere Microsoft Word overrides default settings and is running with administrator privileges,\nthe macro can delete Windows Defender AV’s malware definitions. It then changes the\nregistry to disable Microsoft Office’s security warnings and safety features.\n\nIn summary, the campaign’s delivery comprises of multiple layers of components that aim to\nevade detection and possibly complicate analysis by researchers.\n\n_Figure 10: The campaign’s delivery stages_\n\nThe downloaded payload, svchost32.exe, is a .NET assembly named Millionare that is\nobfuscated using a custom version of ConfuserEx, a well-known open-source .NET\nobfuscator.\n\n_Figure 11: Obfuscated .NET assembly Millionare showing some of the scrambled names_\n\nThe obfuscation modifies the .NET assembly’s metadata such that all the class and variable\nnames are non-meaningful and scrambled names in Unicode. This obfuscation causes some\nanalysis tools like .NET Reflector to show some namespaces or classes names as blank, or\nin some cases, display parts of the code backwards.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: .NET Reflector presenting the code backwards due to obfuscation_\n\nFinally, the .NET binary loads an unpacked .NET assembly, which includes DLL files\nembedded as resources in the portable executable (PE).\n\n_Figure 13: Loading the unpacked .NET assembly during run-time_\n\n## Malware loader\n\nThe DLL that initiates the malicious behavior is embedded as a resource in the unpacked\n[.NET assembly. It is loaded in memory using process hollowing, a code injection technique](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/07/12/detecting-stealthier-cross-process-injection-techniques-with-windows-defender-atp-process-hollowing-and-atom-bombing/)\nthat involves spawning a new instance of a legitimate process and then “hollowing it out”,\ni.e., replacing the legitimate code with malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: In-memory unpacking of the malware using process hollowing._\n\nUnlike previous Hawkeye variants (v7), which loaded the main payload into its own process,\nthe new Hawkeye malware injects its code into MSBuild.exe, RegAsm.exe, and VBC.exe,\nwhich are signed executables that ship with .NET framework. This is an attempt to\nmasquerade as a legitimate process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: Obfuscated calls using .NET reflection to perform process hollowing injection_\n_routine that injects the malware’s main payload into RegAsm.exe_\n\nAdditionally, in the previous version, the process hollowing routine was written in C. In the\nnew version, this routine is completely rewritten as a managed .NET that calls the native\nWindows API.\n\n_Figure 16: Process hollowing routine implemented in .NET using native API function calls_\n\n## Malware functionalities\n\nThe new Hawkeye variants created by the latest version of the malware toolkit have multiple\nsophisticated functions for information theft and evading detection and analysis.\n\n### Information theft\n\nThe main keylogger functionality is implemented using hooks that monitor key presses, as\nwell as mouse clicks and window context, along with clipboard hooks and screenshot\ncapability.\n\nIt has specific modules for extracting and stealing credentials from the following applications:\n\n_Beyluxe Messenger_\n_Core FTP_\n_FileZilla_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Minecraft (replaced the RuneScape module in previous version)_\n\nLike many other malware campaigns, it uses the legitimate BrowserPassView and\n_MailPassView tools to dump credentials from the browser and email client. It also has_\nmodules for taking screenshots of the desktop, as well as the webcam, if it exists.\n\nNotably, the malware has a mechanism to visit certain URLs for click-based monetization.\n\n### Stealth and anti-analysis\n\nOn top of the processes hollowing technique, this malware uses other methods for stealth,\nincluding alternate data streams that remove mark of the web (MOTW) from the malware’s\ndownloaded files.\n\nThis malware can be configured to delay execution by any number of seconds, a technique\nused mainly to avoid detection by various sandboxes.\n\nIt prevents antivirus software from running using an interesting technique. It adds keys to the\nregistry location HKLM\\Software\\Windows NT\\Current Version\\Image File Execution Options\nand sets the Debugger value for certain processes to rundll32.exe, which prevents\nexecution. It targets the following processes related to antivirus and other security software:\n\n_AvastSvc.exe_\n_AvastUI.exe_\n_avcenter.exe_\n_avconfig.exe_\n_avgcsrvx.exe_\n_avgidsagent.exe_\n_avgnt.exe_\n_avgrsx.exe_\n_avguard.exe_\n_avgui.exe_\n_avgwdsvc.exe_\n_avp.exe_\n_avscan.exe_\n_bdagent.exe_\n_ccuac.exe_\n_ComboFix.exe_\n_egui.exe_\n_hijackthis.exe_\n_instup.exe_\n_keyscrambler.exe_\n_mbam.exe_\n_mbamgui.exe_\n_mbampt.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\n_mbamscheduler.exe_\n_mbamservice.exe_\n_MpCmdRun.exe_\n_MSASCui.exe_\n_MsMpEng.exe_\n_msseces.exe_\n_rstrui.exe_\n_spybotsd.exe_\n_wireshark.exe_\n_zlclient.exe_\n\nFurther, it blocks access to certain domains that are usually associated with antivirus or\nsecurity updates. It does this by modifying the HOSTS file. The list of domains to be blocked\nis determined by the attacker using a config file.\n\nThis malware protects its own processes. It blocks the command prompt, registry editor, and\ntask manager. It does this by modifying registry keys for local group policy administrative\ntemplates. It also constantly checks active windows and renders action buttons unusable if\nthe window title matches “ProcessHacker”, “Process Explorer”, or “Taskmgr”.\n\nMeanwhile, it prevents other malware from infecting the machine. It repeatedly scans and\nremoves any new values to certain registry keys, stops associated processes, and deletes\nrelated files.\n\nHawkeye attempts to avoid automated analysis. The delay in execution is designed to defeat\nautomated sandbox analysis that allots only a certain time for malware execution and\nanalysis. It likewise attempts to evade manual analysis by monitoring windows and exiting\nwhen it finds the following analysis tools:\n\n_Sandboxie_\n_Winsock Packet Editor Pro_\n_Wireshark_\n\n## Defending mailboxes, endpoints, and networks against persistent malware campaigns\n\nHawkeye illustrates the continuous evolution of malware in a threat landscape fueled by the\ncybercriminal underground. Malware services make malware accessible to even\nunsophisticated operators, while simultaneously making malware more durable with\nadvanced techniques like in-memory unpacking and abuse of .NET’s CLR engine for stealth.\nIn this blog we covered the capabilities of its latest version, Hawkeye Keylogger – Reborn v8,\nhighlighting some of the enhancements from the previous version. Given its history, Hawkeye\nis likely to release a new version in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations should continue educating their employees about spotting and preventing\nsocial engineering attacks. After all, Hawkeye’s complicated infection chain begins with a\nsocial engineering email and lure document. A security-aware workforce will go a long way in\nsecuring networks against attacks.\n\nMore importantly, securing mailboxes, endpoints, and networks using advanced threat\nprotection technologies can prevent attacks like Hawkeye, other malware operations, and\nsophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nOur in-depth analysis of the latest version and our insight into the cybercriminal operation\nthat drives this development allow us to proactively build robust protections against both\nknown and unknown threats.\n\n[Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (Office 365 ATP) protects mailboxes as well as files,](https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/online-email-threat-protection?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\nonline storage, and applications from malware campaigns like Hawkeye.
