These intrusions also facilitated the defendants other criminal schemes,\nincluding ransomware and “crypto-jacking” schemes, the latter of which refers to the group’s\nunauthorized use of victim computers to “mine” cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso in August 2020, the same federal grand jury returned a third indictment charging two\nMalaysian businessmen who conspired with two of the Chinese hackers to profit from\ncomputer intrusions targeting the video game industry in the United States and abroad.\nShortly thereafter, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued arrest warrants\nfor the two businessmen. On Sept. 14, 2020, pursuant to a provisional arrest request from\nthe United States with a view to their extradition, Malaysian authorities arrested them in\nSitiawan. The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided\nby the Government of Malaysia, including the Attorney General’s Chambers of Malaysia and\nthe Royal Malaysia Police.\n\nIn addition to arrest warrants for all of the charged defendants, in September 2020, the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia issued seizure warrants that resulted in the recent\nseizure of hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names, and command-and-control (C2”)\n“dead drop” web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion\noffenses. The FBI executed the warrants in coordination with other actions by several\nprivate-sector companies, which included disabling numerous accounts for violations of the\ncompanies’ terms of service. In addition, in partnership with the department, Microsoft\ndeveloped and implemented technical measures to block this threat actor from accessing\nvictims’ computer systems. The actions by Microsoft were a significant part of the overall\neffort to deny the defendants continued access to hacking infrastructure, tools, accounts, and\ncommand and control domain names. In coordination with today’s announcement, the FBI\nhas also released a Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report that contains critical, relevant\ntechnical information collected by the FBI for use by specific private-sector partners.\n\n“The department of Justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer\nintrusions and cyberattacks by these Chinese citizens,” said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey\nA. Rosen. “Regrettably, the Chinese communist party has chosen a different path of making\nChina safe for cybercriminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal\nintellectual property helpful to China.”\n\n“Today’s charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to\nconduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the\ndepartment’s determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the\nprivate sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,” said Assistant\nAttorney General John C. Demers. “This is the only way to neutralize malicious nation state\ncyber activity.”\n\n“Today’s announcement demonstrates the ramifications faced by the hackers in China but it\nis also a reminder to those who continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics that we will utilize\nevery tool we have to administer justice,” said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. “The\n\n\n-----\n\narrests in Malaysia are a direct result of partnership, cooperation and collaboration. As the\ncyber threat continues to evolve larger than any one agency can address, the FBI remains\ncommitted to being an indispensable partner to our federal, international and private sector\npartners to stop rampant cyber crime and hold those carrying out these kind of actions\naccountable.”\n\n“The scope and sophistication of the crimes in these unsealed indictments is unprecedented.\nThe alleged criminal scheme used actors in China and Malaysia to illegally hack, intrude and\nsteal information from victims worldwide,” said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for\nthe District of Columbia. “As set forth in the charging documents, some of these criminal\nactors believed their association with the PRC provided them free license to hack and steal\nacross the globe. This scheme also contained a new and troubling cyber-criminal\ncomponent – the targeting and utilization of gaming platforms to both defraud video game\ncompanies and launder illicit proceeds.”\n\n“The actions announced today reflect a years-long commitment by the FBI Washington Field\nOffice to pursue the perpetrators of the computer intrusion campaigns described in the\nindictments, and to bring those perpetrators to justice,” said Acting Assistant Director in\nCharge James A. Dawson, FBI Washington Field Office. “This case demonstrates the FBI’s\ndedication to pursuing these criminals no matter where they are, and to whom they may be\nconnected.”\n\nThe August 2019 indictment charged Zhang Haoran (张浩然), 35, and Tan Dailin (谭戴林),\n35, with 25 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money laundering, and\nviolations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”). The indictment charged Zhang\nand Tan with participating in a “Computer Hacking Conspiracy,” which targeted hightechnology and similar organizations. The indictment also charged that, as an additional way\nto make money, Zhang and Tan participated in a “Video Game Conspiracy,” through which\nZhang and Tan, together with others, sought to make money by hacking video game\ncompanies, obtaining and otherwise generating digital items of value (e.g., video game\ncurrency), and then selling such items for profit. In several instances, they used their\nunauthorized access to gaming company networks take action against other unrelated\ngroups engaged in the same fraudulent generation of gaming artifacts, thereby attempting to\neliminate the criminal competition.\n\nOne of the August 2020, indictments charged Jiang Lizhi (蒋立志), 35, Qian Chuan (钱川),\n39, and Fu Qiang (付强), 37, with nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to\nviolate the CFAA, substantive violations of the CFAA, access device fraud, identity theft,\naggravated identity theft, and money laundering. The racketeering conspiracy pertained to\nthe three defendants’ conducting the affairs of Chengdu 404 Network Technology (“Chengdu\n404”), a PRC company, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion\noffenses affecting over 100 victim companies, organizations, and individuals in the United\nStates and around the world, including in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India,\nIndonesia Japan Malaysia Pakistan Singapore South Korea Taiwan Thailand and\n\n\n-----\n\nVietnam. The defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India\nand Vietnam, and targeted, but did not compromise, government computer networks in the\nUnited Kingdom. In one notable instance, the defendants conducted a ransomware attack\non the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to combating global poverty.\n\nThe defendants associated with Chengdu 404 employed sophisticated hacking techniques to\ngain and maintain access to victim computer networks. One example was the defendants’\nuse of “supply chain attacks,” in which the hackers compromised software providers and\nthen modified the providers’ code to facilitate further intrusions against the software\nproviders’ customers. Another example was the hackers’ use of C2 “dead drops,” which are\nseemingly legitimate web pages that the hackers created, but which were surreptitiously\nencoded instructions to their malware. However, they also employed publicly available\nexploits and tools, including the following common vulnerabilities and exposures (“CVE”):\nCVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-20191652/CVE-2019-1653, and CVE-2020-10189.\n\nThe second August 2020 indictment charged Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32,\nboth Malaysian nationals and residents, with 23 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, identity\ntheft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, money laundering, violations of the\nCFAA, and falsely registering domain names. The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling\nconducted the affairs of Sea Gamer Mall, a Malaysian company founded by Wong, through a\npattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses targeting the video\ngame industry in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The\nindictment alleged that Wong and Ling worked with various hackers, including Zhang and\nTan, to profit from the hackers’ criminal computer intrusions at video game companies.\n\nThe indictment against Zhang and Tan charges the defendants with two counts of conspiracy\nto commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two\ncounts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in\nprison; five counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison;\nnine counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum\nsentence of 10 years in prison; four counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer,\nwhich carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of aggravated identity\ntheft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money\nlaundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nThe indictment against Jiang, Qian, and Fu charges the defendants with one count of\nracketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count\nof conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in\nprison; one count of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum\nsentence of 10 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer,\nwhich carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of threatening to\ndamage a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison;\none count of access device fraud which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison;\n\n\n-----\n\none count of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one\ncount of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison;\nand one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in\nprison.\n\nThe indictment against Wong and Ling charges the defendants with one count of\nracketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count\nof racketeering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; three counts of\nintentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years\nin prison; five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a\nmaximum sentence of five years in prison; five counts of furthering fraud by unauthorized\naccess to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison;\ntwo counts of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison;\ntwo counts of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one\ncount of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison;\nand three counts of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in\nprison. The indictment also alleges false registration of domain names, which would\nincrease the maximum sentence of imprisonment for money laundering to 27 years; the\nmaximum sentence of imprisonment for unlawful access to a protected computer to 10 years\ninstead of five years; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for intentional damage to a\nprotected computer to 17 years instead of 10 years; and the mandatory sentence of\nimprisonment for aggravated identity theft to four years instead of two years.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided\nhere for informational purposes only; any sentencing's of the defendants will be determined\nby the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of\nColumbia, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI’s\nWashington Field Office. The FBI’s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along\nwith FBI’s Cyber Assistant Legal Attachés and Legal Attachés in countries around the world,\nprovided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance\nin the investigation.\n\nThe department is also grateful to Microsoft, including Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center\n(MSTIC) and Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), to Google, including its Threat Analysis Group\n(TAG), to Facebook, and to Verizon Media, including its Paranoids Advanced Cyber Threats\nTeam, for the assistance they provided in this investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Demian Ahn of the District of Columbia, Assistant U.S. Attorney\nTejpal Chawla of the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney Evan Turgeon of the National\nSecurity Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are\npresumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\n\n-----",
