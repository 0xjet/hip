It was a pivotal\nlearning experience that led to a better\nunderstanding in the industry on the value of\nproper risk management and risk\nimplementation within decision-making.\n\nThe oil and gas Industry has always carried a\nunique set of risks. Unlike most other sectors\nwhere protecting intellectual property (IP) takes\na prominent role within the corporate Risk\nManagement Framework, the dangers\nassociated with oil and gas places the security\nof people and the environment at the forefront\nof their risk policies.\n\nThe oil and gas industry always carries the\ndangers associated with dealing with a\ncombustible element in extreme and often\nremote conditions. Add to those dangers the\noften unpredictable nature of sociopolitical\nevents with the often inclement weather of\ndrilling locations, and the very nature of finding,\ntransporting, and refining oil and natural gas\nbecomes daunting.\n\nLosing money by drilling into a dry well, while\ndamaging to the revenue stream, appears less\n\n\ndrastic when compared to the damages\nincurred on any one of the major disasters that\noccurred over the last 30 years. If something\ngoes wrong in this industry, lives, local habitats\nand even global economies are at risk.\n\nIt’s no wonder that this industry has pioneered\nthe implementation of Health, Safety and\nEnvironment (HSE) as an organizational pillar\nuniversal in this sector. The safety and\nwellbeing of others takes prominent stage\nwhether upstream, midstream or downstream,\neven before that of the hydrocarbons that each\ncompany struggles so hard to find, refine,\ntransport and sell.\n\nFew industries triage and escalate prospective\n(HSE) near misses with the purpose of\npredicting incidents with the same\nthoroughness as oil and gas companies. Fewer\nprivate sector companies promote the value of\nsuch seemingly innocuous acts as holding the\nhandrails when climbing or descending stairs, or\nmaking sure to start each presentation with a\nsafety slide describing the precautions or\nactions attendees must know about in the\nevent of an emergency.\n\n**Intellectual Property Paradox**\nIn the oil and gas industry Intellectual Property\n(IP) takes-up various forms. From volume,\nvelocity and variety readings to geophysical\nequations, the data that flows throughout every\npart of an upstream, midstream, and\ndownstream company is as varied as it is sacred\nto the present and future health of each\norganization.\n\nCompounding the challenge in protecting IP in\noil and gas is the accessibility of data crucial to\nthe complete operation of the industry. In\nenhance exploration and production, for\nexample, IP is being used not only to find new\nsources of oil and gas, but to reduce the nonproductive time (NPT) of assets by predictive\nmaintenance of critical components such as\nESPs (electric submersible pumps).\n\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation. All rights reserved. 1\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY\n\n\nIP is even being used to help reduce the Health,\nSafety and Environment incidents within drilling\nand production, and provide end-to-end views\nof hydrocarbon reservoirs and advanced\npattern detection.\nIn refining and manufacturing, IP is used to\nreduce the NPT of assets through the predictive\nmaintenance of critical components such as\nrotary equipment. IP can also include the data\nused to improve asset performance\nmanagement through real-time metrics across\ndifferent subsystems.\n\nIP provides the competitive advantage that sets\neach company apart from the other in a highlyintegrated industry. It also helps oil and gas\ncompanies better understand the current\nenvironment to deliver better future results.\n\nThe challenge with IP in the oil and gas sector is\ndetermining how to best keep the IP safe, yet\naccessible to those that need it.\n\nIn attempting to understand the complete\ndynamics that go into making safety and\nsecurity a top priority in the Oil and Gas Sector,\nit’s easy to overlook the importance of\ncybersecurity and the integration of information\ntechnology (IT) and operational technology\n(OT).\n\n**Operational Technology is hardware and**\nsoftware that a company uses to monitor or\ncontrol an environment. OT commonly detects,\nmeasures, and executes a change, or event,\nwithin a given physical area. Most commonly\nassociated with physical access devices or\nwithin manufacturing, OT has increasing\nbecome integrated within the IT backbone of\nmany organizations. Understanding this\ntechnological merger is important step in\nunderstanding the threat landscape.\n\n**The Universal Trend**\nDepending upon your sources, the statistics on\ncyber-attacks varies. According to a recent\nSymantec study there was a 91 percent increase\nin targeted attack campaigns in 2013, which\n\n\nincludes a 62 percent increase in the number of\nbreaches. The same report cited that 1 in 392\nemails contain phishing attacks and that webbased attacks are up 23 percent over a similar\ntime last year.\n[http://www.symantec.com/security_response/](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp)\n[publications/threatreport.jsp](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp)\n\nA different report by IBM stated that in the\nUnited States alone, there was an estimated 1.5\nmillion monitored cyber-attacks in 2013. That\nequates to roughly a 12 percent year to year\n[increase in security events. (http://www-](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/security-services/data-breach/)\n[935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/security-services/data-breach/)\n[services/security-services/data-breach/)](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/security-services/data-breach/)\n\nRegardless of the numbers, two common trends\nin cybersecurity are clear:\n\n  - **_The rise in cyber-attacks_**\n\n  - **_The increase in attack sophistication_**\n\nOver the last 30 years the oil and gas sector has\nendured a number of well-known cyber-attacks.\nOne of the most famous attacks, perpetrated by\nan organization called the Cutting Sword of\nJustice, was the Saudi Aramco attack of 2012.\nThis attack aimed at stopping oil and gas\nproduction in Saudi Arabia’s largest exporter\nwithin the Organization of the Petroleum\nExporting Countries.\n\nThis attack crippled 30,000 computers and\ndisrupted Saudi Aramco for months. However,\nan important lesson from the attack pertains to\nthe Business Continuity Planning (BCP)\naftermath. If all your desktop computers\nsuddenly became useless, could your\norganization operate completely on paper if it\nhad to? Could your organization procure\nthousands of new hard drives if it needed to\nreplace all of its computer systems? How long\nwould that take? Where would those\ncomputers come from? What procedure would\nemployees follow and how would they know\nwhat to do?\n\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation. All rights reserved. 2\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY\n\n\ns devastating as the attack was on Saudi\nAramco, in some respects it was\nfortunate. The cyber-attack focused on\n\n## A\n\ndamaging 32-bit machines, leaving the 64-bit\nservers intact. The attack on RasGas Company\nLimited, possibly by the same organization just\ntwo weeks later, included an improved variant\nof the Aramco virus that infected 32 and 64-bit\nmachines, making that devastation more\nsevere. The main takeaway from this second\nattack is a lesson on how fast back-to-back\nattacks can occur, and how well attackers learn\nfrom their mistakes.\n\nThe attack on Saudi Aramco ultimately failed to\ndisrupt production, but was one of the most\ndestructive cybersecurity strikes against a single\nbusiness.\n\n#### More importantly, this attack echoed the need for oil and gas companies to evaluate the importance of a cyber-threat landscape with regard to attacks and uncovered vulnerabilities.\n\n**Understanding the Threat Landscape**\nThe global oil industry is expected to spend\n$1.87 billion by 2018 in cyber-security. This\nfigure is according to a 2013 study by ABI\nResearch, which states that the oil and gas\nsector “is connecting its industrial control\nsystems (OT) full of unpatched vulnerabilities to\nthe Internet, where cybercriminals roam in all\nimpunity.”\n\nThe ABI Research study also describes the IT\ninfrastructure in many oil and gas companies as\n“poorly protected against cyber threats…at\nbest, they are secured with IT solutions which\nare ill-adapted to legacy control systems such as\nSCADA.” As a measure to update their security\ninfrastructure, this study predicts that the oil\nand gas sector will increase spending in IT and\nOT security significantly.\n\n\nAccording to a similar report by Frost & Sullivan,\nentitled Global Oil and Gas Infrastructure\nSecurity Market Assessment, the total oil and\ngas infrastructure security market is expected\nto increase from $18 billion dollars a year in\n2011 to $31 billion dollars by 2021.\n[http://www.slideshare.net/FrostandSullivan/glo](http://www.slideshare.net/FrostandSullivan/global-oil-gas-infrastructure-security-mkt-m83-dnov-2012)\n[bal-oil-gas-infrastructure-security-mkt-m83-](http://www.slideshare.net/FrostandSullivan/global-oil-gas-infrastructure-security-mkt-m83-dnov-2012)\n[dnov-2012](http://www.slideshare.net/FrostandSullivan/global-oil-gas-infrastructure-security-mkt-m83-dnov-2012)\n\nFinally, during a recent Cybersecurity for Oil,\nGas, and Petrochemicals Summit, the organizers\nof the summit quoted the Global State of\nInformation Security® Survey 2014, by Price\nWaterhouse Coopers, that demonstrated\nspending on cybersecurity solutions in the oil\nand gas sector increasing by average of 32% in\n2013 from the previous year.\n[http://www.cyberoilandgas.com/Opportunities.](http://www.cyberoilandgas.com/Opportunities.aspx)\n[aspx](http://www.cyberoilandgas.com/Opportunities.aspx)\n\nThese reports allude to an increase in cyberattacks by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs),\na term coined by the United States Government\ndescribing organized conglomerates of hackers\nand cyber-attackers that target specific\ncompanies or governments as part of an\nagenda. APTs are regarded as well-funded, wellsupported and well-educated.\n\nThe reports also suggest three reasons that the\noil and gas industry needs to move towards a\nmore stringent application of cybersecurity:\n\n##### 1. Greater Integration within Value Chain\nThe very nature of the oil sector as a giant\necosystem comprised of upstream, midstream\nand downstream companies and organizations\ncomplicates the security landscape. This\nmassive infrastructure made-up of Independent\nOil Companies (IOCs), state-owned oil\ncompanies, smaller companies that focus on\nonly certain streams and armies of service\nproviders and third-party entities provides a\nripe environment for security gaps and multiple\npoints of entry.\n\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation. All rights reserved. 3\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY\n\n\nThe additional integration between these\norganizations within the oil and gas ecosystem\ncan lead to ripple effects when a disruption\nsuch as a spill, an attack, or a sociopolitical issue\noccurs.\n\n##### 2. Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality (AIC) \nThe oil and gas sector was built with\naccessibility at its core. The entire nature of the\nindustry, since its inception, is to focus on\nmaking oil and gas as accessible as possible\nwhether removing it from the ground,\ntransporting it to refineries or getting it to the\nconsumer.\n\nThe need for accessibility at this level has\ncreated an industry that relies heavily on\noperating technology and an AIC model where\nthe technology in place focuses more on\navailability and less on confidentiality:\n\n- **Availability: Ensures that all resources**\n(systems and data) are available when\nneeded\n\n- **Integrity: Prevents the unauthorized**\nmodification of data including\nunintentionally inaccurate data. This could\nbe a software programming, or system\nconfiguration error, absence of data, or\nadded data.\n\n- **Confidentiality: Ensures that only authorized**\npeople can access resources\nSource:\n[http://rbubblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/security-](http://rbubblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/security-triad-aic-cia/)\n[triad-aic-cia/](http://rbubblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/security-triad-aic-cia/)\n\nndustries less reliant on OT use a more\ncommon CIA model of prioritization with\nconfidentiality of IP and data as its top\n\n## I\n\npriority. However, the oil and gas industry was\ndesigned with availability of oil and gas, and the\ndata that provides their availability, as its main\nfocus. This is indicative on an industry heavily\ndependent on volume, numbers, and pressure\nreadings. In the past the AIC model hadn’t\ncaused a significant security concern because\nthe OT that provided much of this accessibility\n\n\nrequired physical access and was seldom\nnetworked for remote access. However, the\nintegration between IT and OT is changing this\nvery nature of OT to produce a potential\nopening for cyber-attacks.\n\nIn the oil and gas sector this integration is\nfocused on making the OT remotely accessible\nto provide a faster understanding of the data\nand improve production performance, while\nproviding remote support and diagnostics.\nNetwork-added capabilities to OT increase the\navailability of data and the subsequent\naccessibility of oil and gas that this industry\nneeds to become more agile and minimize\ncosts. The vulnerabilities associated with this\nintegration, however, are two-fold.\n\nFirst, by placing OT on the network it\nautomatically makes it available to those that\nhack or breach the network those nodes are on.\nThis places the confidentiality and integrity\naspect of the AIC model at risk.\n\nAnd secondly, by adding networking and\nremote controlling capabilities to operational\ntechnology often uses commercial off-the-shelf\ntechnologies (COTs). Desktops or laptops with\n\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation. All rights reserved. 4\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY\n\n\nstandard 32-bit operating systems, USB port\nintegration, embedded 802.11a,b,c and n\nantennas, Bluetooth, Ethernet—all of these\ntechnologies need patching, updating, antivirus\nand maintenance. OT, often built to provide\nunidirectional communication and legacy\noperating systems, can’t rely upon an IT-centric\napproach to basic security such as anti-virus and\npatching.\n\nThe result of this integration can be an out-ofdate operating system that an organization\nhasn’t updated with a patch because the patch\nrequires a change. The system is tested (Factory\nAcceptance Test or FAT) in a certain\nconfiguration, which is signed off by the system\nvendor and the customer as functioning\ncorrectly. Any change from that configuration,\nincluding a patch, renders the FAT invalid and\ntherefore the system invalid. Companies (and\nthe vendors) have not seen the need to patch\nand in some cases, the vendor will not provide\napproved patches and void the warranty if any\nunapproved patches are applied.\n\n##### 3. Newer technologies\nAdding to the complexities associated with a\nhighly-integrated industry dealing with the\ncombination of IT and OT are the new\ntechnologies on the horizon that could further\nblur the lines for a CIO or CISO attempting to\nprotect the enterprise.\n\nDigital oil fields connected to cloud systems\nthat run Big Data initiatives, the use of drones in\nupstream oil and gas to run magnetic surveys,\ngravity anomaly surveys or monitoring for\nenvironmental issues and third-party\ncompanies that are now providing the ability to\nhost 3D modeling for Well and Field Planning\ncan complicate security policies. These are just\na few of the cutting-edge technologies currently\npermeating the industry that could create\nadditional vulnerabilities, particularly when\npaired with the integration of IT and OT.\n\n\nThe result of these vulnerabilities are the need\nto allocate spending on IT networks, industrial\ncontrol systems and data security as well as\nemergency counter measures and the\ndevelopment of policies and procedures that\nprovide the balance required between\naccessibility, confidentiality and integrity.\n\n**Cybersecurity and Health, Safety and**\n**Environment**\nThe best approach towards mitigating the\ncyber-threat associated with IT and OT is to\nexamine their integration in a collaborative\nenvironment. The discussion shouldn’t be IT\nversus OT but rather IT and OT. The integration\nof the two technologies is inevitable, but the\npolicies and procedures need to be bolstered to\nincorporate the capabilities, or requirements of\nand difference between, each technology. In\nmany ways the safety of an organization and its\nIT is dependent on this successful integration.\n\nAccording to the United States Occupational\nSafety & Health Administration (OSHA), before\nits creation 43 years ago, an estimated 14,000\nworkers were killed on the job every year.\nToday, workplaces are much safer, going from\n38 fatal injuries a day to 12.\n[https://www.osha.gov/dep/fatcat/dep_fatcat.h](https://www.osha.gov/dep/fatcat/dep_fatcat.html)\n[tml](https://www.osha.gov/dep/fatcat/dep_fatcat.html)\n\nMuch of the success that the oil and gas sector\nhas had in mitigating the risks and dangers\naround their day-to-day activities associated\nwith working with a combustible element in a\ndangerous environment has been by\nimplementing stringent procedures within HSE\nthat include tracking incidents and near misses,\nnot just injuries and fatalities.\n\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation. All rights reserved. 5\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBERSECURITY IN THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY\n\n\nCurrently, the oil and gas industry tracks:\n\n  - the number of near safety misses\n\n  - the number of minor safety incidents\n\n  - the number of safety incidents that lead\nto a loss of time\n\n  - the number of fatalities\n\nThe current state of HSE is a study in evolution,\ngenerally created in 3-phases. The first phase of\nsafety within oil and gas was aimed at trying to\ndetermine the safety-risk of an organization.\nWhen the reduction in accidents flattened out,\nthe oil and gas industry entered phase two,\nwhich added procedures. In the wake of the\nPiper Alpha disaster of 1988, in which 167 oil rig\nworkers lost their lives, these procedures\nfocused primarily around work management.\nFinally, when that reduction flattened out, the\noil and gas industry evolved to the current state\nof behavioral safety, which entails trying to get\npeople to stop doing unsafe things and not cut\ncorners or ignore procedures.\n\nThe true lesson in these phases of HSE\nevolution, which run in-parallel with the\nevolution of cybersecurity, is the need to\naddress challenges through solutions that\nencompass people, processes and technology,\nin parallel. By adding this level of rigor, oil and\ngas companies are able to predict and mitigate\nthe level of risk that their employees and local\ncommunities are subject to in the present and\nnear future. This rigor is accompanied by\ncomprehensive safety training that encourages\nthe vigilant participation of all staff in lookingfor and calling-out potential safety issues and\nincidents.\n\nThis process can be as effective with\ncybersecurity, and the vulnerabilities of\nintegrating IT and OT, as it is with health, safety\nand the environment. If a tech, for example, is\nabout to plug a USB device into a computer or\nOT device, and by following procedure, first\nscans the USB which then detects a virus, this\nshould be recorded in a central log as a “near\nmiss.”\n\n\nIf a breach is detected by a cybersecurity\nanalyst, and results in no data loss, this activity\nshould be recorded as an “incident.” If a loss of\ndata or integrity is reported, this should be\nrecorded as a “loss.”\n\n#### By standardizing, recording and tracking all cybersecurity activities in a manner similar to the way HSE records incidents, organizations can better mitigate the integration of IT and OT, and the risks associated with their technological ecosystems. \n\n**Aligning Solutions**\nThe greatest challenge in mitigating the risks\nassociated with IT and OT integration, and in\nstandardizing, recording and tracking\ncybersecurity activities lies in finding a platform\nthat centralizes all the moving parts of this\nstrategy. All too often, cybersecurity platforms\nare too IT focused and don’t incorporate the OT\nelements of data integrity and availability.\n\nLockheed Martin has approached this challenge\nby successfully combining the IT and OT\nlandscapes with the integration of Industrial\nDefender. Industrial Defender is a security\nproduct company built on a robust history of OT\nsecurity knowledge and experience. Industrial\nDefender helps organizations address the\npeople (e.g. training), the processes (e.g. policy\nand procedures) and implement the security\ntechnologies needed to address modern OT\nsecurity challenges.\n\nndustrial Defender pairs these capabilities\nwith a philosophy that continues to maintain\nand improve security in a perpetual fashion.\n\n## I\n\n#### Security is a never ending journey, not a destination.\nThroughout that journey, Industrial Defender\nprovides the tools and technology that not only\ndelivers security and compliance, but change\n\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation.

This solution includes\ndeploying automation system agents that are\npurpose-built to integrate with technologies\nfrom leading automation vendors, and deliver\ncritical capabilities that support the overall\nenterprise.\n\nMore importantly, this solution does not\nnegatively impact operations or systems. It\nprovides solutions supported by the operational\nand compliance requirements at the heart of\neach project.\n\nWhen paired with Lockheed Martin’s\nIntelligence Driven Defense (IDD), it creates a\nholistic approach that protects IT and IP from\nthe Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This\nthreat is comprised of well-funded, well-trained\norganizations trying to specifically target a\ncompany in an effort to steal data and impact\ntheir operational environment.\n\nAn approach to cybersecurity similar to HSE,\ncombined with Intelligent Driven Defense and\nIndustrial Defender solutions addresses the fullspectrum of threats in a manner that maintains\nthe accessibility needed within oil and gas,\nwhile safeguarding the confidentiality and\nintegrity integral to IT and OT.\n\n© 2014 Lockheed Martin Corporation.
