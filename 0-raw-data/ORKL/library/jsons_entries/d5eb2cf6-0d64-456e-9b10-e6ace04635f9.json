FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as “Carbanak Group,” although we do not equate all usage of the\nCARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. This blog explores the range of FIN7's criminal ventures, the technical innovation and social engineering\ningenuity that powered their success, a glimpse into their recent campaigns, their apparent use of a security company as a front for criminal\noperations, and what their success means for the threat landscape moving forward. With this release, FireEye is also providing technical\ncontext, historical indicators, and techniques that organizations can use to hunt for FIN7 behavior enterprise-wide.\n\n**FIN7 Does the Crime...**\n\nThe threat group is characterized by their persistent targeting and large-scale theft of payment card data from victim systems, which it has\nmonetized at least a portion of through a prominent card shop. But FIN7’s financial operations were not limited to card data theft. In some\ninstances, when they encountered and could not obtain payment card data from point of sale (POS) systems secured with end-to-end\nencryption (E2EE) or point-to-point encryption (P2PE), FIN7 pivoted to target finance departments within their victim organizations.\n\nFurthermore, in April 2017, FireEye reported that FIN7 sent spear phishing emails to personnel involved with United States Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) filings at multiple organizations, providing further insight into FIN7’s targeting. These targeted individuals would\nlikely have access to material non-public information that FIN7 actors could use to gain a competitive advantage in stock trading.\n\nDiversification of their monetization tactics has allowed the group to impact a wide range of industries beyond those solely associated with\npayment card industry. During campaigns that FireEye associates with FIN7, victims within the following sectors have been targeted within the\nUnited States and Europe:\n\nRestaurants                                *Travel\nHospitality                                  *Education\nCasinos and Gaming                         *Construction\nEnergy                                    *Retail\n\n\n-----\n\na ce e eco u cat o s\nHigh-tech                                  *Government\nSoftware                                   *Business services\n\n**FIN7’s Innovation Enabled their Success**\n\nThroughout FireEye’s tracking of FIN7 campaigns, the attackers have attempted to stay ahead of the game and thwart detection, using novel\ntactics and displaying characteristics of a well-resourced operation. For example, in April 2017, FireEye blogged about FIN7’s spear phishing\nemails that leveraged hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the\nvictim. This was a direct departure from their established use of weaponized Office macros and highlighted the group’s adaptive nature to\nevade detection.\n\nFireEye also previously reported on FIN7’s use of the [CARBANAK backdoor as a post-exploitation tool to cement their foothold in a network](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/behind-the-carbanak-backdoor)\nand maintain access to victim environments. CARBANAK is well known for its use in highly profitable and sophisticated attacks dating back to\n2013, with usage attributable to FIN7 beginning in late 2015, although how interconnected the campaigns employing the malware over this\nfive-year span are is unclear. FIN7’s use of CARBANAK is particularly notable due to their use of creative persistence mechanisms to launch\nthe backdoor. The group leveraged an application shim database that injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager\n(\"services.exe\") process, and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process. FIN7 also used this tactic to install a payment card harvesting\nutility.\n\n[Another notable characteristic of FIN7 has been their heavy use of digital certificates. Unsurprisingly, malicious threat actors have sought to](https://pkic.org/uploads/2013/10/CASC-Code-Signing.pdf)\nexploit the legitimacy afforded by these certificates. By digitally signing their phishing documents, backdoors and later stage tools, FIN7 was\nable to bypass many security controls that may limit execution of macros from Office documents and restrict execution of unsigned binaries on\ntrusted systems.\n\n**Organization** **Country** **Serial** **Email**\n\nKorsar Travel TOV UA 88:21:ac:7e:6c:da:11:00:1d:b3:d3:1a:16:c1:5c:26 korsartravel@bk.ru\n\nKaitschuck James GB 30:2e:7f:14:3a:f3:f3:98:20:70:42:4e:ea:52:5d:d2 oliversoftware@hotmail.com\n\nPark Travel RU 4d:e2:87:56:98:bf:c7:74:a3:f3:47:d6:70:7c:9b:f0 inga@parktravel-mx.ru\n\nTable 1: Sample FIN7 code signing certificates\n\n[FIN7 developed evasive techniques at a rapid pace. Throughout 2017, FIN7 was observed creating novel obfuscation methods, and in some](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/obfuscation-wild-targeted-attackers-lead-way-evasion-techniques)\ncases modifying the methods on a daily basis while launching attacks targeting multiple victims. The threat group regularly tested malicious\nDOC, DOCX, and RTF phishing documents against public repositories to check static detection engine coverage. Their development of a\npayload obfuscation style using the Windows command interpreter's (cmd.exe) native string substitution was so unique that FireEye dubbed it\n[\"FINcoding.\" These methods inspired deep command line obfuscation research and the release of Daniel Bohannon's Invoke-DOSfuscation.](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation)\nReference Table 2 and Table 3 for a selection of samples and their associated command line obfuscation techniques.\n\n**FIN7’s Relentless Phone Calls and Bellyaching**\n\nOver the three years of responding to a multitude of compromises and proactively defending against FIN7, FireEye observed unprecedented\nsocial engineering prowess. From leveraging web forms for initial contact to targeting and engaging directly with pre-determined store\nmanagers, the operators demonstrated a range of capabilities. FIN7’s reach extended beyond their targets’ computer systems. FireEye has\nresponded to incidents where FIN7 has called victims prior to lodging digital complaints laden with malicious documents as well as after the\nphishing documents have been sent, in order to check if they were received – a crude but effective FIN7 email delivery tracking technique.\n\nAs FIN7 has matured, so did the quality of their phishing lures and templates, which were most often sent from fake but thoroughly disguised\nindividuals and businesses – and occasionally from sender addresses impersonating legitimate government entities. Their phishing has often\nexploited urgent, high value business matters tailored to their chosen targets. At individual stores, managers were contacted about lost items\nor sent a “receipt” claiming overcharging. Other FIN7 phishing emails masqueraded as detailed catering orders or requests for special menus\ntailored to individuals with dietary restrictions.\n\nIn early 2017, a pattern of complaints emerged and has continued for well over a year, where FIN7 has contacted stores and corporate offices\n[to lodge food poisoning complaints with malicious attachments. Internally dubbed “FINdigestion” by FireEye, this pattern of detailed complaints](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FINdigestion)\neventually expanded beyond individual complaints and into litigious concerns raised on behalf of “the government”, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFDA themed spear phishing email\n\n\nFigure 1: FDA themed spear phishing email\n\n[It is noteworthy that the BATELEUR backdoor activity first identified by Proofpoint in July 2017, which FireEye tracks as a suspected FIN7](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fin7carbanak-threat-actor-unleashes-bateleur-jscript-backdoor)\nsubgroup, uses highly-customized graphics for their targets, often created in Adobe Photoshop. In this same phishing campaign, FIN7’s\nmalicious attachment was graphically themed to match, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nFDA themed spear phishing attachment\n\n\nFigure 2: FDA themed spear phishing attachment\n\nThroughout their operations, the professional design and continued development of phishing elements in parallel to other post-compromise\ntools indicated to FireEye that FIN7 was most likely a well-resourced criminal operation.\n\n**It’s Just Metadata**\n\n\n-----\n\ne ye as t ac ed se e a pe so as t oug out t e ope at o s by co ect g a d pa s g etypes o o e s c a ue o ju cy etadata\nIn a previous blog, we shared how LNK files created by FIN7 unintentionally revealed valuable information about their development\nenvironment.\n\nLNK files can contain metadata that reveals attributes about the systems on which the LNKs were created, including original file paths, volume\nserial numbers, MAC addresses, and hostnames. By studying values within the LNK metadata we often identify \"toolmarks,\" or unique values\nassociated with distinct malware developer and operator personas.\n\nFIN7 LNK metadata shows that the actors routinely used virtual machines with generic hostnames such as ANDY-PC or USER-PC, and\ndefault hostnames with the structure WIN-[A-Z0-9]{11} (e.g. WIN-ABCDEFGH1JK).\n\nFireEye has tracked several hostname and path toolmarks associated with FIN7’s operations, which we have used to link clusters of threat\nactivity together. These toolmarks may be linked to FIN7 members who are involved in tool development or the broader criminal operation.\nNotable personas from the technical data, which are explored in more detail in the Technical Appendix section, include:\n\n\"andy\" / \"andy-pc\"\n\"Hass\"\n\"jimbo\"\n\"Константин\" (Konstantin)\n\"oleg\"\n\nThis analysis allowed us to understand FIN7’s systems and correlate future attack activity to the different personas. Furthermore, the metadata\nanalysis helped us monitor for files generated by the group and use the established toolmarks to establish detection for other adversary\nmethodologies (such as direct RDP or SMB access) if the group changed TTPs.\n\n**Video Playback of FIN7 Operations**\n\nWhile responding to multiple FIN7 intrusions, FireEye recovered a custom video recording capability used by FIN7 as a part of their operations.\nFireEye’s FLARE team reverse engineered the video protocol, which appeared to be custom-written by FIN7 as it has no external library\ndependencies, contained Cyrillic comments in the code, and required the use of a bespoke video player unique to FIN7. The attackers most\nlikely leveraged this video recording capability in their arsenal to monitor operations in victim environments to inform later stages of their\nintrusions.\n\nFireEye obtained a version of the criminal developers’ video player from a trusted source and with the knowledge of the reverse engineered\nprotocol, the FLARE team modified the source code to support multiple versions of FIN7’s custom encoding. With the patched source code,\nFireEye can decode and playback FIN7’s video monitoring for affected victims in possession of these files.\n\n**Recent Shifts in FIN7 Operations**\n\nThroughout 2018, FireEye has continued to identify multiple domains registered using patterns consistent with prior FIN7 activity, as well as\ncampaigns using disparate TTPs that we have attributed to FIN7 with varying degrees of confidence. ZIP archives delivering the BIRDDOG\nbackdoor were hosted on a portion of suspected FIN7 domains registered in 2018. Some evidence further characterizing the nature of this\ncampaign suggests these malicious documents were sent to financial institution customers in Eastern Europe and Central Asia as early as\nSeptember 2017. The targeting of individuals rather than organizations would mark a significant shift in their targeting, although it is also\npossible that the banks spoofed in these campaigns were FIN7's ultimate targets.\n\nAdditionally, we have identified similarities between FIN7 activity and BATELEUR campaigns, which began as early as mid-2017 and have\nbeen primarily aimed at U.S.-based restaurant chains. These campaigns leveraged macro-embedded Word documents directly attached to the\nemails as well as ones hosted on Google Drive. The documents were meticulously crafted to appear as though they came from legitimate\norganizations (e.g. restaurant associations and suppliers of POS hardware). This suspected FIN7 activity continued past the date of most\nrecent arrest announced by U.S. law enforcement, although the attackers are now leveraging an updated JavaScript backdoor dubbed\nGRIFFON.\n\nThese recent campaigns could be representative of a decisive effort to diversify TTPs to avoid detection or could indicate the formation of FIN7\nsplinter groups carrying out autonomous campaigns. As a result, organizations need to remain vigilant and continue to monitor for changes in\nthe methods employed by the FIN7 actors.\n\n**Unveiling FIN7’s Front Company and Industry**\n\n\n-----\n\nCombi Security logo as retrieved from 2016 cache of combisecurity.com\n\n\nFigure 3: Combi Security logo as retrieved from 2016\n\ncache of combisecurity.com\nAccording to U.S. law enforcement, at least a portion of FIN7 activity was run out of a front company dubbed Combi Security. A cache of its\nwebsite reveals that the company purported to be “the world leaders in the field of comprehensive protection of large information systems from\nmodern cyber threats” with headquarters in Moscow, Haifa, and Odessa. We have identified job advertisements for Combi Security that have\nbeen posted on popular Russian, Ukrainian, and Uzbek job recruitment sites, as well as numerous individuals who most likely worked for the\ncompany. Due to the seeming legitimacy of the recruitment postings, some individuals may have been unaware of illicit nature of their work.\nWhile the recruitment of unwitting individuals as puppets has been a common component of at least some criminal schemes – for example,\nreshipping mules who are recruited through postings on career sites advertising attractive work-from-home jobs – FIN7’s veiling of full-scale\nfinancial compromises as legitimate offensive security engagements is particularly notable. The apparent success of Combi Security in\nrecruiting unsuspecting individuals in this manner, may lead to more of this type of technical recruitment by cyber criminals in the future.\n\n**Splitting Up?**\n\nThe criminal organization behind FIN7 is almost certainly comprised of many additional individuals beyond those already apprehended by law\nenforcement authorities. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence expects that at least a portion of these malicious actors are likely to continue conducting\ncyber crime activity in some capacity. Although we expect activity to continue, it is extremely common for threat actors to either modify their\nTTPs or temporarily halt operations following significant developments such as arrests of high-level members and/or public disclosure of TTPs\nthat they employ.\n\nDepending on the organizational and communication structure of the group, it is also plausible that multiple subgroups could form and carry\nout independent operations in the future. Recent campaigns, as well as those using tactics that were atypical for historical FIN7 campaigns,\nsuch as the SEC campaigns with widespread targeting, may be representative of semi-autonomous groups pre-existing within, or cooperating\n[with, the FIN7 criminal organization. As noted in our CARBANAK overview, certain malware families and techniques transcend strictly defined](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/behind-the-carbanak-backdoor)\nthreat groups, and may be re-used by developers and operators as they transition between organizations and campaigns.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese recent announcements by U.S. law enforcement highlight the positive impact that can result from synergy between private and public\nsector organizations in disrupting organized cyber crime operations. As demonstrated by FIN7, financially-motivated threat actors are\nbecoming extremely advanced and are capable of inflicting significant harm on organizations through vast, but carefully orchestrated\ncampaigns. As sophisticated threat groups continue to emerge, partnerships, such as those exhibited here, will almost certainly play a key role\nin combating these threats.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nJordan Nuce, Tom Bennett, Michael Bailey, and Daniel Bohannon\n\n**Technical Appendix**\n\n\n-----\n\ne ye as espo ded to a y c de ts, c as p o ded us e te s e s g t to t e ope at o s s pa t o t s b og post, e a e\nalso including numerous indicators that we attribute to FIN7 and an overview of their techniques to aid organizations in identifying malicious\nactivity across their networks.\n\n**Phishing Documents Technical Details**\n\nIn addition to LNK metadata, FIN7 phishing documents consistently contained artifacts detailing the local file system paths of component files\nused to construct the spear phishing documents.
