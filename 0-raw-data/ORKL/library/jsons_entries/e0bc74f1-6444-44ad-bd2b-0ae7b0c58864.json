This newcomer takes a page from Egregor, a more established ransomware family, in](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/egregor-ransomware-launches-string-of-high-profile-attacks-to-en.html)\nhiding its malicious activity and carries a potential connection to the advanced persistent threat (APT) group FIN8.\n\nUse of a command-line password\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of White Rabbit’s attack is how its payload binary requires a specific command-line\npassword to decrypt its internal configuration and proceed with its ransomware routine. This method of hiding malicious\nactivity is a trick that the ransomware family Egregor uses to hide malware techniques from analysis.\n\nWhite Rabbit’s payload is inconspicuous at first glance, being a small file of around 100 KB with no notable strings and\nseemingly no activity. The telltale sign of its malicious origin is the presence of strings for logging, but the actual\nbehavior would not be easily observed without the correct password.\n\nFigure 1. SysTracer showing the command line\n\nused to execute the ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample we analyzed used the password or passphrase KissMe, as can be seen in Figure 1, although other\nsamples might use a different password. Figure 1 also shows the arguments accepted by the ransomware, which we\nsurmise as standing for the following:\n\n-p: password/passphrase\n-f: file to be encrypted\n-l: logfile\n-t: malware’s start time\n\nArrival and relation to an APT\n\nOur internal telemetry shows traces of Cobalt Strike commands that might have been used to reconnoiter, infiltrate,\nand drop the malicious payload into the affected system.\n\nFigure 2. Evidence showing traces of Cobalt Strike\n[Meanwhile, researchers from Lodestone have pointed out that the malicious URL connected to the attack is also related](https://lodestone.com/insight/white-rabbit-ransomware-and-the-f5-backdoor/)\nto the APT group called FIN8. They have likewise noted White Rabbit’s use of a never-before-seen version\nof Badhatch, an F5 backdoor that is also associated with FIN8. Unfortunately, at the time of the analysis, files from the\nsaid URL were no longer available.\n\nThe ransomware routine\n\n[The ransomware routine itself is not complicated. Like many modern ransomware families, White Rabbit uses double](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomwares-double-extortion-tactics-and-how-to-protect-enterprises-against-them)\nextortion and threatens its targets that their stolen data will be published or sold, as seen in their ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. White Rabbit ransom note\nThe ransomware creates a note for each file it encrypts. Each note bears the name of the encrypted file\nand is appended with “.scrypt.txt.” Prior to the ransomware routine, the malware also terminates several processes and\nservices, particularly antivirus-related ones.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then tries to encrypt files (if the f argument is not given) in fixed, removable, and network drives, as well\nas resources. It also tries to skip the following paths and directories to avoid crashing the system and destroying its own\nnotes:\n\n*.scrypt.txt\n*.scrypt\nc:\\windows\\*\n*:\\sysvol\\*\n*:\\netlogon\\*\nc:\\filesource\\*\n*.exe\n*.dll\n*\\desktop.ini\n*:\\windows\\*\nc:\\programdata\\*\n*:\\programfiles\\*\n*:\\program files (x86)\\*\n*:\\program files (x64)\\*\n*.lnk\n*.iso\n*.msi\n*.sys\n*.inf\n%User Temp%\\*\n*\\thumbs.db\n\nConclusion\n\nCurrently, we are still determining if FIN8 and White Rabbit are indeed related or if they share the same creator. Given\nthat FIN8 is known mostly for its infiltration and reconnaissance tools, the connection could be an indication of how the\ngroup is expanding its arsenal to include ransomware. So far, White Rabbit’s targets have been few, which could\nmean that they are still testing the waters or warming up for a large-scale attack.\n\nWhite Rabbit is thus likely still in its development phase, considering its uncomplicated ransomware routine. Despite\nbeing in this early stage, however, it is important to highlight that it bears the troublesome characteristics of modern\nransomware: It is, after all, highly targeted and uses double extortion methods. As such, it is worth monitoring.\n\nA multilayered defense can help guard against modern ransomware and prevent the success of the evasion tactics they\nemploy.
