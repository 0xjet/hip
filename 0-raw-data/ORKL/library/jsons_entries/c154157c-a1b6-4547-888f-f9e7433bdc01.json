It was originally released in\nMay 2009 by Swedish game developer Mojang Studios, which was acquired by Microsoft in\n2014 for US $2.5 billion. Initially released for the Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, the\ngame is now available on 22 platforms including video game consoles and mobile devices,\nincluding Android and iOS. As its gaming population has steadily grown, reaching more than\n\n\n-----\n\n140 million monthly active players in August 2021, Minecraft has never been more popular\n12 years after its initial release. Evidently, cybercriminals cannot pass up the opportunity to\ntarget such a large userbase.\n\n[FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a variant of the Chaos ransomware that appears to](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguardlabs)\ntarget Minecraft gamers in Japan. This variant not only encrypts certain files but also\ndestroys others, rendering them unrecoverable. If gamers fall prey to the attack, choosing to\npay the ransom may still lead to a loss of data. In this report we will take a look at how this\nnew ransomware variant works.\n\nFigure 1. Growth of Monthly Active Minecraft Players since June 2016 per Statista\n\n## Ransomware Lure Being Posted to Japanese Minecraft Forums\n\nGamers create “alt” (alternative) accounts within Minecraft for various purposes (both good\nand bad): they allow them to antagonize/troll other players without having their main account\nbanned, they provide cover for an alternative in-game identity/personality, they help avoid\ngetting their main account banned for using cheats (gaining an unfair advantage over other\ngamers), etc. FortiGuard Labs has discovered a variant of Chaos ransomware being hidden\nin a file pretending to contain a list of “Minecraft Alt” accounts that leads us to believe that the\neffort is to target Minecraft gamers in Japan.\n\nEven though they are often publicly available through Minecraft online forums, Alt Lists\ncontain stolen accounts that gamers can use to do the things listed above. That’s what the\nthreat actors behind this ransomware attack are using to lure victims to download and open\nthe file.\n\nIn this case, the file is an executable, but it uses a text icon to fool potential victims into\nthinking it is a text file full of compromised usernames and passwords for Minecraft. While we\ndon’t know how this specific fake list is being distributed, it’s a safe guess that the file is\nbeing advertised on Minecraft forums for Japanese gamers.\n\n## How the Executable Works\n\n[Once the executable file is opened, the malware searches for files smaller than 2,117,152](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=malware)\nbytes on the compromised machine and encrypts them. It then appends those files with four\nrandom characters chosen from “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890” as a file\nextension.\n\nBut files larger than 2,117,152 bytes with specified file extensions are filled with random\nbytes so the victim will not be able to get those files back even if the ransom is paid. Having\nthis destructive element changes this attack from a typical ransomware attack, and is a very\ntroubling component.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is not known why the malware authors have chosen these file size values or why they\nchoose to encrypt some and destroy others. But it is interesting to note that the Chaos\nmalware was originally classified as a wiper malware with the ransomware component added\nlater.\n\nFigure 2. List of file extensions this Chaos variant targets for destruction\n\nOnce the attack takes place, a dropped ReadMe.txt files ask the victim to pay a ransom in\neither bitcoin or pre-paid cards. The requested amount to decrypt the files is equal to 2,000\nyen (approx. US $17), which is dirt cheap compared to the amounts other ransomware\nattacks typically demand. The ransom note does not specify which type of pre-paid card the\nattacker wants. All kinds of pre-paid cards (online shopping, gaming, music, mobile phone\ncharge and online streaming services) are available in convenience stores. Japan has more\nthan [50,000 convenience store locations selling pre-paid cards and most are open 24/7.](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2071.html)\n\nThe ransom note also states that the attacker is available only on Saturdays and apologizes\nfor any inconvenience caused. The malware does not include code to identify the language\nsetting of the compromised machine and the ransom note is available in Japanese only.\nThis, combined with the formal language of the ransom note, indicates this Chaos\nransomware variant specifically targets Japanese Windows users.\n\nFigure 3. Ransom note\n\nThe ransomware also deletes shadow copies from the compromised machine, which\nprevents the victim from being able to recover any files that had been encrypted, making it\n[doubly destructive. FortiGuard Labs previously released a blog about shadow copy deletion](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/stomping-shadow-copies-a-second-look-into-deletion-methods?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=stomping-shadow-copies-a-second-look-into-deletion-methods)\ncarried out by ransomware. Luckily this Chaos ransomware variant does not have any code\nto steal data from the compromised machine.\n\nThe malware also changes the desktop wallpaper, perhaps to add more pressure to the\nvictim to pay the ransom.\n\nFigure 4. Image of desktop wallpaper replaced by the ransomware\n\n## Conclusion - Chaos Ransomware Variant\n\nThere is nothing fancy about this Chaos ransomware variant nor its infection vector.\nHowever, despite its cheap ransom demand, its ability to destroy data and render it\nunrecoverable makes it more than a mere prank to annoy Japanese Minecraft gamers.\nRansomware is still ransomware, and in this case, the victim may not be able to get their\noriginal files back, with or without making a ransom payment. The best advice is for players\nto stay off suspicious gaming cheat sites and simply enjoy the game the way it was meant to\nbe played.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortiGuard Labs has AV coverage in place for all of the malicious file samples in the report\nas:\n\nMSIL/Filecoder.AGP!tr.ransom\n\nDue to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to the reputation\nof an organization, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable\n[information (PII), etc., it is important to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-an-ips?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=what-is-an-ips)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### SHA2:\n\n1a00c3f9173ee4c6f944e2dcebe44ca71f06455951728af06eba0f945e084907\n\naacce549a756cd942ee79f57625d0902ce79315f4e4bfb1381afa208599d7be5\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?tab=security-bundles&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=security-bundles)_\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[free cybersecurity training, an initiative of Fortinet’s Training](https://www.fortinet.com/training/cybersecurity-professionals?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=Freetraininginitiative)_\n_Advancement Agenda (TAA), or about the_ _Fortinet Network Security Expert_\n_[program, Security Academy program, and](https://training.fortinet.com/local/staticpage/view.php?page=fnsa&utm_source=pr&utm_campaign=fnsa)_ _[Veterans program.
