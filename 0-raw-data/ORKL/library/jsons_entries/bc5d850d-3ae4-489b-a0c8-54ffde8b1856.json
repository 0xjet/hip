    "plain_text": "# New Crossrider variant installs configuration profiles on Macs\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/04/new-crossrider-variant-installs-configuration-profiles-on-macs/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/04/new-crossrider-variant-installs-configuration-profiles-on-macs/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social)**\n\nThomas Reed April 24, 2018\n\nA new variant of the Crossrider adware has been spotted that is infecting Macs in a unique\nway. For the most part, this variant is still quite ordinary, doing some of the same old things\nthat we’ve been seeing for years in Mac adware. However, the use of a configuration profile\nintroduces a unique new method for maintaining persistence.\n\nPersistence is the goal of most malware. After all, what good is it to infect a machine if the\nmalware stops running as soon as the computer restarts? There are some cases where that\ncan still be useful (ransomware, for example), but in most cases, that’s not desired behavior.\nSo malware creators are often stuck using the same old methods of persistence that are\neasy to spot. Sometimes, though, they get creative.\n\n## Infection method\n\nThis new Crossrider variant doesn’t look like much on the surface. It’s yet another fake\nAdobe Flash Player installer, looking like the thousands of others we’ve seen over the years.\n\n\n-----\n\nOpening the installer results in a familiar install process, with nothing unique about it. In the\ncourse of installation, it dumps a copy of Advanced Mac Cleaner, which commences to\nannounce that it has found problems with your system using Siri’s voice. (No such problems\nactually exist, of course.) Safari also pops open and then closes again suspiciously. This is\nall very blasé, as far as malware goes.\n\nBut something interesting has happened behind the scenes. After removing Advanced Mac\nCleaner, and removing all the various components of Crossrider that have been littered\naround the system, there’s still a problem. Safari’s homepage setting is still locked to a\nCrossrider-related domain, and cannot be changed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious configuration profile\n\nIt turns out that this is caused by a configuration profile installed on the system by the\nadware. Configuration profiles provide a means for IT admins in businesses to control the\nbehavior of their Macs. These profiles can configure a Mac to do many different things, some\nof which are not otherwise possible.\n\nIn the case of this Crossrider variant, the configuration profile that is installed forces both\nSafari and Chrome to always open to a page on chumsearch[dot]com. This also prevents the\nuser from changing that behavior in the browser’s settings.\n\nThe profile can be found by opening System Preferences, then clicking the Profiles icon. (If\nthere isn’t a Profiles icon, you don’t have any profiles installed, which is normal.)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis profile installs with an identifier of com.myshopcoupon.www, which is not visible in\nSystem Preferences. However, the profile can definitely be identified by scrolling through the\ndetails and looking for references to chumsearch[dot]com. This malicious profile can be\nremoved by selecting it and clicking the minus (-) button in the bottom left corner of the\nwindow.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe chumsearch[dot]com domain is one that has been linked to a number of different\nadware programs, which can all be traced back to Crossrider. It is affiliated with one of the\nmost widespread adware campaigns on the Mac, with only the infamous Genieo adware\nhaving a higher number of detections by Malwarebytes for Mac among all detected adware\nfamilies.\n\n[The chumsearch[dot]com website contains an ad for MacKeeper (the most widely-distributed](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/puppum/2016/08/pup-friday-mackeeper/)\npotentially unwanted program on macOS, made by Kromtech). Advertising money from\nKromtech is undoubtedly one of the ways this site pays for itself. Ironically, this adware is\nalso installed alongside another infamous Mac PUP called Advanced Mac Cleaner, by\nPCVARK, a program similar to and competing with MacKeeper.\n\nObviously, not all parts of this chain are affiliated with Crossrider, but the chumsearch domain\nimposed by the configuration profile definitely is.\n\n## If you’re an IT admin\n\n\n-----\n\nFor those readers who are managing fleets of Macs and need to check for and/or remove\nthese profiles remotely, that’s pretty easy using a few simple shell scripts.\n\nOn macOS 10.12 and earlier, you can use a command like this:\n```\nsudo profiles -L\n\n```\nThis works on macOS 10.13 as well, but there is an updated syntax that would be best to\nuse in the future:\n```\nsudo profiles list\n\n```\nEither way, if you see an unfamiliar profile, particularly one with a profileIdentifier of\ncom.myshopcoupon.www, that profile should be removed. This can be done with the\nfollowing command on macOS 10.12 and earlier:\n```\nsudo profiles -R -p com.myshopcoupon.www\n\n```\nOr, for macOS 10.13:\n```\nsudo profiles remove -identifier com.myshopcoupon.www\n\n## Gone in a Flash\n\n```\nThe good news is that there was nothing particularly sneaky about the method of infection.\nFake Adobe Flash Player installers are nothing new, and are easy to avoid. Still, people do\ncontinue to fall for such scams.\n\nIf you see a message in your web browser telling you that Adobe Flash Player needs to be\nupdated, it’s almost certainly a scam. Do not follow any of the directions provided by these\nmessages, and especially don’t download and install whatever they tell you to.\n\nIf you do have Flash installed on your Mac, and you believe that it needs an update, you can\ncheck for and install updates from the Update tab in the Flash Player pane in System\nPreferences.\n\nIf you want to install Flash for the first time on your Mac, the first thing you should do is think\ntwice. Flash is a dying technology, and is a constant source of security vulnerabilities. Few\nsites these days truly require Flash. However, if you really do insist on installing it, you\nshould download it only from Adobe’s website.\n\n\n-----",
