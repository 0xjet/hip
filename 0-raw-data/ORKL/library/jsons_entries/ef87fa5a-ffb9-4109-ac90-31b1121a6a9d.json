    "plain_text": "# Pulse Report: New APT32 Malware Campaign\n Targets Cambodian Government\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has discovered a new malware campaign targeting the Cambodian government using an\n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-themed spearphish. Using Recorded Future RAT controller detections and\n\nNetwork Traffic Analysis, Insikt Group identified new operational infrastructure that we attribute to the Vietnamese state\nsponsored threat activity group APT32, also known as OceanLotus. This assessment is also supported by the identification\n\nof several Cambodian victim organizations communicating with this infrastructure, and aligns with previous campaigns\n\ntargeting these organizations.\n\n**History**\n\nVietnam and Cambodia have a long history of conflict, dating back to the Sino-Vietnamese War of the 1970’s, when Vietnam\n\nbegan retaliatory attacks on China’s “little brother,” Cambodia. In 2017, Vietnam started strengthening its cyber warfare capabilities\n\nwith the formation of APT32, which targeted ASEAN’s website during the 2017 annual summit, as well as targeting websites of\n\nministries or government agencies in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines.\n\n[In recent years, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia has deteriorated in part because of China’s Belt and Road](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/vietnam-is-losing-its-best-friends-to-china/)\n\nInitiatives (BRI) in the region. As Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has grown closer to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the\n\ntwo have strengthened the partnerships between the two countries, pushing Vietnam out of critical regional cooperatives.\n\n[Chinese investments in Cambodia include critical infrastructure, joint military exercises in the South China Sea, and a new](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/vietnam-is-losing-its-best-friends-to-china/)\n\nproperty development just North of Ream Naval Base, strategically located on the Gulf of Thailand between Vietnam\n\nand Cambodia.\n\n**New APT32 Infrastructure**\n\nIn June 2020, Insikt Group reported on new APT32 operational infrastructure identified through a proprietary method of\n\ntracking malware activity associated with APT32, such as METALJACK and DenisRAT. Using this same methodology, Insikt\n\nGroup has continued to identify new, active APT32 IP addresses and associated domains.\n\nInsikt researchers discovered several samples that are a part of this campaign:\n\nSample 1: The first sample is delivered via a malicious document titled, “បញ្ជីរាយនាមអនុព័ន្ធយោធាបរទេសនិងការិយាល័យសហប្រតិបត្តិ\n\nការយោធាប្រចាំកម្ពុជា.docx~[.]exe”, which translates to “List of Foreign Military Attachments and Office of Military Cooperation in\n\nCambodia.docx~[.]exe”. This sample, likely delivered via spearphishing, is a self-extracting archive (SFX) containing four files:\n\n1. A legitimate executable signed by Apple (SoftwareUpdate.exe).\n\n2. A related benign dynamic link library (DLL) file (SoftwareUpdateFiles.dll).\n\n\n-----\n\n3. A malicious DLL (SoftwareUpdateFilesLocalized.dll).\n\n4. A file named “SoftwareUpdateFiles.locale” containing encrypted shellcode.\n\nUpon execution of the SFX, the Apple executable loads the benign DLL before loading the malicious DLL, which is stored\n\nin the SoftwareUpdateFiles.Resources/en.lproj file path. The malicious DLL then extracts the encrypted shellcode from the\n\nSoftwareUpdateFile.locale file and decrypts and executes it, while displaying a decoy document to the user (an Microsoft\n\nWord document displaying an “activation error”), eventually loading the final payload.\n\nThis loading process matches APT32 activity previously reported by Insikt Group and [Ahnlab in relation to an APT32](https://www.ahnlab.com/kr/site/securityinfo/secunews/secuNewsView.do?menu_dist=2&seq=29561)\n\nsample referencing the 2020 ASEAN Summit. Further analysis of these artifacts for identification of the malware family is\n\nongoing within Insikt Group and updates will be posted as more samples are analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample 2: A second sample, uploaded to a malware repository on October 22, 2020, uses this same loading process and\n\ncommunicates with one of the identified C2 domains, cloud.bussinesappinstant[.]com.\n\nIn this sample, the SFX file is called “9_Programme_SOMCA-Japan_FINAL.docx~.exe”, likely in reference to the ASEAN Senior\n\nOfficials Meeting for Culture and Arts (SOMCA), indicating APT32’s continued interest in the targeting of ASEAN and other\n\nmember states.\n\n_Decoy document utilized in this campaign shows a blank agenda for the “Seventh Meeting of the ASEAN Plus Japan Senior Officials on Culture and Arts. (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nThis archive file drops the same “SoftwareUpdateFilesLocalized.dll” file seen in the previous sample. In addition to the TTP\n\n(tactics, techniques, procedures) and infrastructure overlaps, the malicious DLLs linked to this latest sample share an identical\n\nrich header and import hash seen in historical APT32 samples.\n\nInsikt Group identified further evidence of targeting of Cambodia through several IP addresses assigned to a Cambodian\n\ngovernment organization regularly communicating with the APT32 C2 IP address 43.254.132[.]212.\n\nRecorded Future recommends using the following indicators of compromise from this campaign for detection and defense\n\nagainst this malware. Additionally, Insikt Group has provided a YARA rule for detection, below.\n\n[For more insight into state-sponsored cyber threats, visit www.recordedfuture.com/category/research/](https://www.recordedfuture.com/category/research/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise**\n\n|IP Address|Domain|\n|---|---|\n|43.254.132[.]117|bussinesappinstant[.]com, cloud. bussinesappinstant[.]com, query. bussinesappinstant[.]com|\n|43.254.132[.]212|insappstaticanalyze[.]com, dns. insappstaticanalyze[.]com|\n\n|Malware Hash|Malware Description|\n|---|---|\n|a030435018a67c07747751766132eb30a9 a6bb6af161df225a27c0ec57156b61|Sample 1 parent SFX file|\n|d873bdb08c45378650761bad71df7418c7 b542adb13ccd4a87df2001801f4808|SoftwareUpdateFilesLocalized.dll|\n|625f5253e306cce30da4dbff2a6ade608c a295b10d086b9eaaec4743e53b0c82|File named “SoftwareUpdateFiles.locale” containing encrypted shellcode|\n|Dbde2b710bee38eb3ff1a72b673f756c27f aa45d5c38cbe0f8a5dfccb16c18ba|APT32 sample referencing the 2020 ASEAN Summit|\n|47ba92dc8c9302b2f70db70a0d46fef0ee 2972edc3e1c4b637d5c76b4141c7a0|Sample 2 parent SFX file|\n|75c61d9d8da4a87882ccdd37b664953c10 a186b5545c5152fd1b6bf788a1a846|Historical Related APT32 Sample|\n|cfbacb8a1ca087810d17d86fcf94d9c660cf 3331ccb0b015709bb48a9adb1cc7|Historical Related APT32 Sample|\n\n\n-----\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nRecorded Future delivers security intelligence to amplify the effectiveness of security and IT teams by informing decisions in real time\nwith contextual, actionable intelligence.
