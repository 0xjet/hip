APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting\nof the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverview: The group s focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent\nto perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect\nproprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic\nrequirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to\nfacilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary\nintent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making.\n\nAssociated malware: The group primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY\nbackdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor.\n\nAttack vectors: For initial compromise Mandiant Intelligence has observed APT39 leverage\nspearphishing with malicious attachments and/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT\ninfection. In some cases previously compromised email accounts have also been leveraged,\nlikely to abuse inherent trusts and increase the chances of a successful attack. APT39\nfrequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate web services and\norganizations that are relevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this group has routinely\nidentified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted organizations to install web\nshells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and used stolen legitimate credentials to compromise\nexternally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) resources. We have not observed APT39\nexploit vulnerabilities.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt39-iranian-cyber-espionage-group-focused-on-personal-information)\n\n**APT35**\n\nTarget sectors: U.S. Western Europe, and Middle Eastern military, diplomatic, and\ngovernment personnel, organizations in the media, energy, and defense Industrial base, and\nengineering, business services, and telecommunications sectors.\n\nOverview: APT35 (aka Newscaster Team) is an Iranian government-sponsored cyber\nespionage team that conducts long-term, resource-intensive operations to collect strategic\nintelligence. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has observed APT35 operations dating back to\n2014. APT35 has historically relied on marginally sophisticated tools, including publicly\navailable webshells and penetration testing tools, suggesting a relatively nascent\ndevelopment capability. However, the breadth and scope of APT35's operations, particularly\nas it relates to its complex social engineering efforts, likely indicates that the group is well\nresourced in other areas.\n\nAssociated malware: ASPXSHELLSV, BROKEYOLK, PUPYRAT, TUNNA, MANGOPUNCH,\nDRUBOT, HOUSEBLEND\n\nAttack vectors: APT35 typically relies on spearphishing to initially compromise an\norganization, often using lures related to health care, job postings, resumes, or password\npolicies. However, we have also observed the group using compromised accounts with\n\n\n-----\n\ncredentials harvested from prior operations, strategic web compromises, and password\nspray attacks against externally facing web applications as additional techniques to gain\ninitial access.\n\n**APT34**\n\nSuspected attribution: Iran\n\nTarget sectors: This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of\nindustries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and\nhas largely focused its operations within the Middle East\n\nOverview: We believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely\nfocused on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been\noperational since at least 2014. We assess that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian\ngovernment based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian\ninfrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.\n\nAssociated malware: POWBAT, POWRUNER, BONDUPDATER\n\nAttack vectors: In its latest campaign, APT34 leveraged the recent Microsoft Office\nvulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to deploy POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network)\n\n**APT33**\n\nSuspected attribution: Iran\n\nTarget sectors: Aerospace, energy\n\nOverview: APT33 has targeted organizations, spanning multiple industries, headquartered in\nthe U.S., Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in\norganizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as\nwell as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production.\n\nAssociated malware: SHAPESHIFT, DROPSHOT, TURNEDUP, NANOCORE, NETWIRE,\nALFA Shell\n\nAttack vectors: APT33 sent spear-phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the\naviation industry. These emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to\nmalicious HTML application (.hta) files. The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to\nlegitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the\ntargeted individuals.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage)\n\n\n-----\n\n**APT41**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: APT41 has directly targeted organizations in at least 14 countries dating back\nto as early as 2012. The group’s espionage campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms,\nand the high-tech sector, and have historically included stealing intellectual property. Their\ncyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the\nmanipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware.\nAPT41operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide\nsome indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\n\nOverview: APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored\nespionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state\ncontrol.\n\nAssociated malware: APT41 has been observed using at least 46 different code families and\ntools.\n\nAttack vectors: APT41 often relies on spear-phishing emails with attachments such as\ncompiled HTML (.chm) files to initially compromise their victims. Once in a victim\norganization, APT41 can leverage more sophisticated TTPs and deploy additional malware.\nFor example, in a campaign running almost a year, APT41 compromised hundreds of\nsystems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware including backdoors, credential\nstealers, keyloggers, and rootkits. APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot\nRecord (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on\nselect victim systems.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation)\n\n**APT40**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: APT40 is a Chinese cyber espionage group that typically targets countries\nstrategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative. Although the group targets global\norganizations — especially those with a focus on engineering and defense — it also\nhistorically conducted campaigns against regional entities in areas such as Southeast Asia.\nSince at least January 2013, the group has conducted campaigns against a range of\nverticals including maritime targets, defense, aviation, chemicals, research/education,\ngovernment, and technology organizations.\n\nOverview: Mandiant Intelligence believes that APT40's operations are a cyber counterpart to\nChina's efforts to modernize its naval capabilities; this is also manifested in targeting widescale research projects at universities and obtaining designs for marine equipment and\n\n\n-----\n\nvehicles. The group s operations tend to target government-sponsored projects and take\nlarge amounts of information specific to such projects, including proposals, meetings,\nfinancial data, shipping information, plans and drawings, and raw data.\n\nAssociated malware: APT40 has been observed using at least 51 different code families. Of\nthese, 37 are non-public. At least seven of these non-public tools (BADSIGN, FIELDGOAL,\nFINDLOCK, PHOTO, SCANBOX, SOGU, and WIDETONE) are shared with other suspected\nChina-nexus operators.\n\nAttack vectors: APT40 typically poses as a prominent individual who is probably of interest to\na target to send spear-phishing emails. This includes pretending to be a journalist, an\nindividual from a trade publication, or someone from a relevant military organization or nongovernmental organization (NGO). In some instances, the group has leveraged previously\ncompromised email addresses to send spear-phishing emails.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor)\n\n**APT31**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Multiple, including government, international financial organization, and\naerospace and defense organizations, as well as high tech, construction and engineering,\ntelecommunications, media, and insurance.\n\nOverview: APT31 is a China-nexus cyber espionage actor focused on obtaining information\nthat can provide the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises with political,\neconomic, and military advantages.\n\nAssociated malware: SOGU, LUCKYBIRD, SLOWGYRO, DUCKFAT\n\nAttack vectors: APT31 has exploited vulnerabilities in applications such as Java and Adobe\nFlash to compromise victim environments.\n\n**APT30**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\n\nOverview: APT30 is noted not only for sustained activity over a long period of time but also\nfor successfully modifying and adapting source code to maintain the same tools, tactics and\ninfrastructure since at least 2005. Evidence shows that the group prioritizes targets, most\n\n\n-----\n\nlikely works in shifts in a collaborative environment and builds malware from a coherent\ndevelopment plan. The group has had the capability to infect air-gapped networks since\n2005.\n\nAssociated malware: SHIPSHAPE, SPACESHIP, FLASHFLOOD\n\nAttack vectors: APT30 uses a suite of tools that includes downloaders, backdoors, a central\ncontroller and several components designed to infect removable drives and cross air-gapped\nnetworks to steal data. APT30 frequently registers its own DNS domains for malware CnC\nactivities.\n\n**APT27**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: APT27 has targeted multiple organizations headquartered around the globe,\nincluding North and South America, Europe, and the Middle East. These organizations fall\ninto a range of different industries, including business services, high tech, government, and\nenergy; however a notable number are in the aerospace and transport or travel industries.\n\nOverview: APT27 engages in cyber operations where the goal is intellectual property theft,\nusually focusing on the data and projects that make a particular organization competitive\nwithin its field.\n\nAssociated malware: PANDORA, SOGU, ZXSHELL, GHOST, WIDEBERTH, QUICKPULSE,\nFLOWERPOT\n\nAttack vectors: APT27 often uses spear phishing as its initial compromise method. APT27\nthreat actors are not known for using original zero-day exploits, but they may leverage those\nexploits once they have been made public. In at least one case, APT27 actors used a\ncompromised account at one victim organization to send a spear phishing email to other\nintended victims in the similar industries. Additionally, APT27 may compromise vulnerable\nweb applications in order to gain an initial foothold.\n\n**APT26**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Aerospace, Defense, and Energy sectors, among others.\n\nOverview: APT26 engages in cyber operations where the goal is intellectual property theft,\nusually focusing on the data and projects that make a particular organization competitive\nwithin its field.\n\nAssociated malware: SOGU, HTRAN, POSTSIZE, TWOCHAINS, BEACON\n\n\n-----\n\nAttack vectors: The group frequently uses strategic web compromises to gain access to\ntarget networks and custom backdoors once they are inside a victim environment.\n\n**APT25**\n\nAKA: Uncool, Vixen Panda, Ke3chang, Sushi Roll, Tor\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: The defense industrial base, media, financial services, and transportation\nsectors in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nOverview: APT25 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft.\n\nAssociated malware: LINGBO, PLAYWORK, MADWOFL, MIRAGE, TOUGHROW,\nTOYSNAKE, SABERTOOTH\n\nAttack vectors: APT25 has historically used spear phishing in their operations, including\nmessages containing malicious attachments and malicious hyperlinks. APT25 threat actors\ntypically do not use zero-day exploits but may leverage those exploits once they have been\nmade public.\n\n**APT24**\n\nAKA: PittyTiger\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: APT24 has targeted a wide variety of industries, including organizations in\nthe government, healthcare, construction and engineering, mining, nonprofit, and\ntelecommunications industries.\n\nOverview: This group is known to have targeted organizations headquartered in countries\nincluding the U.S. and Taiwan. APT24 has historically used the RAR archive utility to encrypt\nand compress stolen data prior to transferring it out of the network. Data theft exfiltrated from\nthis actor mainly focused on documents with political significance, suggesting its intent is to\nmonitor the positions of various nation states on issues applicable to China’s ongoing\nterritorial or sovereignty dispute.\n\nAssociated malware: PITTYTIGER, ENFAL, TAIDOOR\n\nAttack vectors: APT24 has used phishing emails that use military, renewable energy, or\nbusiness strategy themes as lures. Further, APT24 engages in cyber operations where the\ngoal is intellectual property theft, usually focusing on the data and projects that make a\nparticular organization competitive within its field.\n\n\n-----\n\n**APT23**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Media and government in the U.S. and the Philippines\n\nOverview: APT23 has stolen information that has political and military significance, rather\nthan intellectual property. This suggests that APT23 may perform data theft in support of\nmore traditional espionage operations.\n\nAssociated malware: NONGMIN\n\nAttack vectors: APT23 has used spear phishing messages to compromise victim networks,\nincluding education-related phishing lures. APT23 actors are not known to use zero-day\nexploits, but this group has leveraged those exploits once they have been made public.\n\n**APT22**\n\nAKA: Barista\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: A broad set of political, military, and economic entities in East Asia, Europe,\nand the U.S.\n\nOverview: We believe APT22 has a nexus to China and has been operational since at least\nearly 2014, carrying out intrusions and attack activity against public and private sector\nentities, including dissidents.\n\nAssociated malware: PISCES, SOGU, FLATNOTE, ANGRYBELL, BASELESS, SEAWOLF,\nLOGJAM\n\nAttack vectors: APT22 threat actors have used strategic web compromises in order to\npassively exploit targets of interest. APT22 actors have also identified vulnerable publicfacing web servers on victim networks and uploaded webshells to gain access to the victim\nnetwork.\n\n**APT21**\n\nAKA: Zhenbao\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Government\n\n\n-----\n\nOverview: APT21 leverages strategic Russian-language attachments themed with national\nsecurity issues in lure documents. Historically, social engineering content is indicative of a\ncyber espionage operation attempting to gain unauthorized access to privileged information\nconcerning state security in Russia. An analysis of APT21 techniques suggests that another\nof their focus areas is dissident groups which seek greater autonomy or independence from\nChina, such as those from Tibet or Xinjiang.\n\nAssociated malware: SOGU, TEMPFUN, Gh0st, TRAVELNET, HOMEUNIX, ZEROTWO\n\nAttack vectors: APT21 leverages spear phishing email messages with malicious attachment,\nlinks to malicious files, or web pages. They have also used strategic web compromises\n(SWCs) to target potential victims. APT21 frequently uses two backdoors known as\nTRAVELNET and TEMPFUN. Significantly, APT21 typically primarily uses custom\nbackdoors, rarely using publicly available tools.\n\n**APT20**\n\nAKA: Twivy\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Construction and engineering, health care, non-profit organizations, defense\nindustrial bas eand chemical research and production companies.\n\nOverview: APT20 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft. APT20 conducts\nintellectual property theft but also appears interested in stealing data from or monitoring the\nactivities of individuals with particular political interests. Based on available data, we assess\nthat this is a freelancer group with some nation state sponsorship located in China.\n\nAssociated malware: QIAC, SOGU, Gh0st, ZXSHELL, Poison Ivy, BEACON, HOMEUNIX,\nSTEW\n\nAttack vectors: APT20's use of strategic web compromises provides insight into a second set\nof likely targets. Many of APT20's SWCs have been hosted on web sites (including Chineselanguage websites) that deal with issues such as democracy, human rights, freedom of the\npress, ethnic minorities in China, and other issues.\n\n**APT19**\n\nAlso known as: Codoso Team\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Legal and investment\n\n\n-----\n\nOverview: A group likely composed of freelancers, with some degree of sponsorship by the\nChinese government.\n\nAssociated malware: BEACON, COBALTSTRIKE\n\nAttack vectors: In 2017, APT19 used three different techniques to attempt to compromise\ntargets. In early May, the phishing lures leveraged RTF attachments that exploited the\nMicrosoft Windows vulnerability described in CVE 2017-0199. Toward the end of May,\nAPT19 switched to using macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. In the most\nrecent versions, APT19 added an application whitelisting bypass to the XLSM documents. At\nleast one observed phishing lure delivered a Cobalt Strike payload.\n\n**APT18**\n\nAlso known as: Wekby\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Aerospace and Defense, Construction and Engineering, Education, Health\nand Biotechnology, High Tech, Telecommunications, Transportation\n\nOverview: Very little has been released publicly about this group.\n\nAssociated malware: Gh0st RAT\n\nAttack vectors: Frequently developed or adapted zero-day exploits for operations, which\nwere likely planned in advance. Used data from Hacking Team leak, which demonstrated\nhow the group can shift resources (i.e. selecting targets, preparing infrastructure, crafting\nmessages, updating tools) to take advantage of unexpected opportunities like newly exposed\nexploits.\n\nAdditional Resources: Blog – Demonstrating Hustle, Chinese APT Groups Quickly Use ZeroDay Vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) Following Hacking Team Leak\n\n**APT17**\n\nAlso known as: Tailgator Team, Deputy Dog\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: U.S. government, and international law firms and information technology\ncompanies\n\nOverview: Conducts network intrusion against targeted organizations.\n\nAssociated malware: BLACKCOFFEE\n\n\n-----\n\nAttack vectors: The threat group took advantage of the ability to create profiles and post in\nforums to embed encoded CnC for use with a variant of the malware it used. This technique\ncan make it difficult for network security professionals to determine the true location of the\nCnC, and allow the CnC infrastructure to remain active for a longer period.\n\n**APT16**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Japanese and Taiwanese organizations in the high-tech, government\nservices, media and financial services industries\n\nOverview: China-based group concerned with Taiwan political and journalistic matters.\n\nAssociated malware: IRONHALO, ELMER\n\nAttack vectors: Spearphishing emails sent to Taiwanese media organizations and webmail\naddresses. Lure documents contained instructions for registration and subsequent listing of\ngoods on a Taiwanese auction website.\n\n**APT15**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Global targets in the trade, economic and financial, energy, and military\nsectors in support of Chinese government interests.\n\nOverview: APT15 has targeted organizations headquartered in multiple locations, including a\nnumber of European countries, the U.S., and South Africa. APT15 operators share\nresources, including backdoors as well as infrastructure, with other Chinese APTs.\n\nAssociated malware: ENFAL, BALDEAGLE, NOISEMAKER, MIRAGE\n\nAttack vectors: APT15 typically uses well-developed spearphishing emails for Initial\nCompromise against global targets in various sectors that are of interest to the Chinese\ngovernment. Significantly, APT15 use backdoors and infrastructure that is not unique to the\ngroup, making attribution challenging.\n\n**APT14**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Government, telecommunications, and construction and engineering.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverview: APT14 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, with a possible\nfocus on military and maritime equipment, operations, and policies. We believe that the\nstolen data, especially encryption and satellite communication equipment specifications,\ncould be used to enhance military operations, such as intercepting signals or otherwise\ninterfering with military satellite communication networks.\n\nAssociated malware: Gh0st, POISONIVY, CLUBSEAT, GROOVY\n\nAttack vectors: APT14 threat actors do not tend to use zero-day exploits but may leverage\nthose exploits once they have been made public. They may leverage a custom SMTP mailer\ntool to send their spear phishing messages. APT14 phishing messages are often crafted to\nappear to originate from trusted organizations.\n\n**APT12**\n\nAlso known as: Calc Team\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Journalists, government, defense industrial base\n\nOverview: APT12 is believed to be a cyber espionage group thought to have links to the\nChinese People's Liberation Army. APT12's targets are consistent with larger People's\nRepublic of China (PRC) goals. Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this group are in-line\nwith PRC goals and self-interest in Taiwan.\n\nAssociated malware: RIPTIDE, HIGHTIDE, THREBYTE, WATERSPOUT\n\nAttack vectors: Mandiant observed APT12 deliver these exploit documents via phishing\nemails from valid but compromised accounts. Based on past APT12 activity, we expect the\nthreat group to continue to utilize phishing as a malware delivery method.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/darwins-favorite-apt-group-2)\n\n**APT10**\n\nAlso known as: Menupass Team\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Construction and engineering, aerospace, and telecom firms, and\ngovernments in the United States, Europe, and Japan\n\nOverview: APT10 is a Chinese cyber espionage group that Mandiant has tracked since\n2009. They have historically targeted construction and engineering, aerospace, and telecom\nfirms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. We believe that the\n\n\n-----\n\ntargeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including\nacquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential\nbusiness data to support Chinese corporations.\n\nAssociated malware: HAYMAKER, SNUGRIDE, BUGJUICE, QUASARRAT\n\nAttack vectors: This recent APT10 activity has included both traditional spear phishing and\naccess to victim’s networks through managed service providers. (For more information on\ninfection via service providers see M-Trends 2016). APT10 spear phishes have been\nrelatively unsophisticated, leveraging .lnk files within archives, files with double extensions\n(e.g. [Redacted]_Group_Meeting_Document_20170222_doc_.exe) and in some cases\nsimply identically named decoy documents and malicious launchers within the same archive.\nIn addition to the spear phishes, Mandiant Threat Intelligence has observed APT10\naccessing victims through global service providers.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt10-targeting-japanese-corporations-using-updated-ttps)\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt10-menupass-group)\n\n**APT9**\n\nSuspected attribution: Based on available data, we assess that this is a freelancer group with\nsome nation-state sponsorship, possibly China.\n\nTarget sectors: Organizations headquartered in multiple countries and in industries such as\nhealth care and pharmaceuticals, construction and engineering, and aerospace and defense.\n\nOverview: APT9 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, usually focusing\non the data and projects that make a particular organization competitive within its field.\n\nAssociated malware: SOGU, HOMEUNIX, PHOTO, FUNRUN, Gh0st, ZXSHEL\n\nAttack vectors: APT9 was historically very active in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology\nindustry. We have observed this actor use spearphishing, valid accounts, as well as remote\nservices for Initial Access. On at least one occasion, Mandiant observed APT9 at two\ncompanies in the biotechnology industry and suspect that APT9 actors may have gained\ninitial access to one of the companies by using a trusted relationship between the two\ncompanies. APT9 use a wide range of backdoors, including publicly available backdoors, as\nwell as backdoors that are believed to be custom, but are used by multiple APT groups.\n\n**APT8**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\n\n-----\n\nTarget sectors: A broad range of industries, including media and entertainment, construction\nand engineering, and aerospace and defense.\n\nOverview: APT8 engages in cyber operations where the goal is intellectual property theft,\nusually focusing on the data and projects that make an organization competitive within its\nfield. We assess that this is a freelancer group located in China with some nation-state\nsponsorship. APT8 has targeted organizations headquartered in multiple countries, including\nthe U.S., Germany, the U.K., India, and Japan.\n\nAssociated malware: HASH, FLYZAP, GOLFPRO, SAFEPUTT\n\nAttack vectors: APT8 actors often use spear phishing email messages with malicious\nattachments or links, or it exploits vulnerable Internet-facing web servers to compromise\ntarget organizations. In addition, in multiple intrusions APT8 actors sent malicious links to\npotential victims via chat or instant messaging programs.\n\n**APT7**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Construction, engineering, aerospace, and defense industrial base.\n\nOverview: APT7 engages in cyber operations where the goal is intellectual property theft,\nusually focusing on data and projects that make an organization competitive within its field.\nThis group is known to have targeted organizations headquartered in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nAssociated malware: DIGDUG, TRACKS\n\nAttack vectors: APT7 threat actors have used access to one organization to infiltrate another\norganization under the same corporate parent. This is a form of lateral movement, but in this\ncase was also the initial compromise method for the second organization.\n\n**APT6**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Transportation, Automotive, Construction and Engineering,\nTelecommunications, Electronic, Construction and Materials.\n\nOverview: APT6 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, most likely data\nand projects that make an organization competitive within its field. APT6 targeted\norganizations headquartered in the U.S and U.K.\n\nAssociated malware: BELUGA, EXCHAIN, PUPTENT\n\n\n-----\n\nAttack vectors: APT6 utilizes several custom backdoors, including some used by other APT\ngroups as well as those that are unique to the group.\n\n**APT5**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Regional telecommunication providers, Asia-based employees of global\ntelecommunications and tech firms, high-tech manufacturing, and military application\ntechnology in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\n\nOverview: APT5 has been active since at least 2007. APT5 has targeted or breached\norganizations across multiple industries, but its focus appears to be on telecommunications\nand technology companies, especially information about satellite communications. As early\nas 2014, Mandiant Incident Response discovered APT5 making unauthorized code\nmodifications to files in the embedded operating system of another technology platform. In\n2015, APT5 compromised a U.S. telecommunications organization providing services and\ntechnologies for private and government entities. During this intrusion, the actors\ndownloaded and modified some of the router images related to the company’s network\nrouters. Also during this time, APT5 stole files related to military technology from a South\nAsian defense organization. Observed filenames suggest the actors were interested in\nproduct specifications, emails concerning technical products, procurement bids and\nproposals, and documents on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nAssociated malware: BRIGHTCREST, SWEETCOLA, SPIRITBOX, PALEJAB, WIDERIM,\nWINVAULT, HAPPYSAD, BIRDWORLD, FARCRY, CYFREE, FULLSILO,\nHELLOTHEWORLD, HAZELNUT, GIF89A, SCREENBIND, SHINYFUR, TRUCKBED,\nLEOUNCIA, FREESWIM, PULLTAB, HIREDHELP, NEDDYHORSE, PITCHFORK,\nBRIGHTCOMB, ENCORE, TABCTENG, SHORTLEASH, CLEANACT, BRIGHTCYAN,\nDANCEPARTY, HALFBACK, PUSHBACK, COOLWHIP, LOWBID, TIGHTROPE,\nDIRTYWORD, AURIGA, KEYFANG, Poison Ivy\n\nAttack vectors: It appears to be a large threat group that consists of several subgroups, often\nwith distinct tactics and infrastructure. The group uses malware with keylogging capabilities\nto specifically target telecommunication companies' corporate networks, employees and\nexecutives. APT5 has shown significant interest in compromising networking devices and\nmanipulating the underlying software that supports these appliances.\n\n**APT4**\n\nDescription:\n\nAlso known as: Maverick Panda, Sykipot Group, Wisp\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\n\n-----\n\nTarget sectors: Aerospace and Defense, Industrial Engineering, Electronics, Automotive,\nGovernment, Telecommunications, and Transportation.\n\nOverview: APT4 appears to target the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) at a higher rate of\nfrequency than other commercial organizations. However, APT4's history of targeted\nintrusions is wide in scope.\n\nAssociated malware: GETKYS, LIFESAVER, CCHIP, SHYLILT, SWEETTOOTH, PHOTO,\nSOGO\n\nAttack vectors: APT4 actors often leverage spear phishing messages using U.S.\ngovernment, Department of Defense, or defense industrial base themes. APT4 actors may\nrepurpose valid content from government or U.S. DoD web sites within their message bodies\nto lend them legitimacy.\n\n**APT3**\n\nAlso known as: UPS Team\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Aerospace and Defense, Construction and Engineering, High Tech,\nTelecommunications, Transportation\n\nOverview: The China-based threat group Mandiant tracks as APT3 is one of the more\nsophisticated threat groups that Mandiant Threat Intelligence tracks, and they have a history\nof using browser-based exploits as zero-days (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Adobe\nFlash Player). After successfully exploiting a target host, this group will quickly dump\ncredentials, move laterally to additional hosts, and install custom backdoors. APT3’s\ncommand and control (CnC) infrastructure is difficult to track, as there is little overlap across\ncampaigns.\n\nAssociated malware: SHOTPUT, COOKIECUTTER, SOGU\n\nAttack vectors: The phishing emails used by APT3 are usually generic in nature, almost\nappearing to be spam. Attacks have exploited an unpatched vulnerability in the way Adobe\nFlash Player parses Flash Video (FLV) files. The exploit uses common vector corruption\ntechniques to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and uses ReturnOriented Programming (ROP) to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP). A neat trick to\ntheir ROP technique makes it simpler to exploit and will evade some ROP detection\ntechniques. Shellcode is stored in the packed Adobe Flash Player exploit file alongside a key\nused for its decryption. The payload is xor encoded and hidden inside an image.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/demonstrating-hustle)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/operation-clandestine-wolf-adobe-flash-zero-day)\n\n**APT2**\n\nSuspected attribution: China\n\nTarget sectors: Military and Aerospace.\n\nOverview: This group was first observed in 2010. APT2 engages in cyber operations where\nthe goal is intellectual property theft, usually focusing on the data and projects that make an\norganization competitive within its field\n\nAssociated malware: MOOSE, WARP\n\nAttack vectors: Spearphishing emails that exploit CVE-2012-0158.\n\n**APT1**\n\nAlso known as: Unit 61398, Comment Crew\n\nSuspected attribution: China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department’s\n(GSD) 3rd Department (总参三部二局), which is most commonly known by its Military Unit\nCover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398 (61398部队).\n\nTarget sectors: Information Technology, Aerospace, Public Administration, Satellites and\nTelecommunications, Scientific Research and Consulting, Energy, Transportation,\nConstruction and Manufacturing, Engineering Services, High-tech Electronics, International\nOrganizations, Legal Services Media, Advertising and Entertainment, Navigation, Chemicals,\nFinancial Services, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare, Metals and Mining, Education\n\nOverview: APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141\norganizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of\norganizations simultaneously. The group focuses on compromising organizations across a\nbroad range of industries in English-speaking countries. The size of APT1’s infrastructure\nimplies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human\noperators.\n\nAssociated malware: TROJAN.ECLTYS, BACKDOOR.BARKIOFORK,\nBACKDOOR.WAKEMINAP, TROJAN.DOWNBOT, BACKDOOR.DALBOT,\nBACKDOOR.REVIRD, TROJAN.BADNAME, BACKDOOR.WUALESS\n\nAttack vectors: The most commonly observed method of initial compromise is spear\nphishing. The spear phishing emails contain either a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a\nmalicious file. The subject line and the text in the email body are usually relevant to the\nrecipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples’ names. While APT1\nintruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe vast majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors.\nThroughout their stay in the network (which could be years), APT1 usually installs new\nbackdoors as they claim more systems in the environment. Then, if one backdoor is\ndiscovered and deleted, they still have other backdoors they can use. We usually detect\nmultiple families of APT1 backdoors scattered around a victim network when APT1 has been\npresent for more than a few weeks.\n\n**APT38**\n\nSuspected attribution: North Korea\n\nTarget sectors: Financial institutions world-wide\n\nOverview: Our analysis of the North Korean regime-backed threat group we are calling\nAPT38 reveals that they are responsible for conducting the largest observed cyber heists.\nAlthough APT38 shares malware development resources and North Korean state\nsponsorship with a group referred to by the security community as “Lazarus”, we believe that\nAPT38’s financial motivation, unique toolset, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nare distinct enough for them to be tracked separately from other North Korean cyber activity.\n\nAssociated malware: This large and prolific group uses a variety of custom malware families,\nincluding backdoors, tunnelers, dataminers, and destructive malware to steal millions of\ndollars from financial institutions and render victim networks inoperable.\n\nAttack vectors: APT38 has conducted operations in over 16 organizations in at least 11\ncountries. This group is careful, calculated, and has demonstrated a desire to maintain\naccess to victim environments for as long as necessary to understand the network layout,\nrequired permissions, and system technologies to achieve its goals. APT38 is unique in that\nthey are not afraid to aggressively destroy evidence or victim networks as part of their\noperations.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt38-details-on-new-north-korean-regime-backed-threat-group)\n\n**APT37**\n\nSuspected attribution: North Korea\n\nTarget sectors: Primarily South Korea – though also Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East – in\nvarious industry verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace,\nautomotive, and healthcare.\n\nOverview: Our analysis of APT37’s recent activity reveals that the group’s operations are\nexpanding in scope and sophistication, with a toolset that includes access to zero-day\nvulnerabilities and wiper malware. We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried\n\n\n-----\n\nout on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and\ntargeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. Mandiant Threat Intelligence believes\nthat APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123.\n\nAssociated malware: A diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Along\nwith custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive\nmalware.\n\nAttack vectors: Social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets, strategic\nweb compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, and the use of torrent filesharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately. Frequent exploitation of\nvulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP), as well as Adobe Flash. The group has\ndemonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802), and the ability to\nincorporate them into operations.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt37-overlooked-north-korean-actor)\n\n**APT28**\n\nAlso known as: Tsar Team\n\nSuspected attribution: Russian government\n\nTarget sectors: The Caucasus, particularly Georgia, eastern European countries and\nmilitaries, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other European security\norganizations and defense firms\n\nOverview: APT28 is a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on\ndefense and geopolitical issues—intelligence that would be useful only to a government. This\nAPT group compiles malware samples with Russian language settings during working hours\n(8 a.m. to 6 p.m.), consistent with the time zone of Russia’s major cities, including Moscow\nand St. Petersburg. This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other\nresources from a well-established organization, most likely the Russian government.\n\nAssociated malware: CHOPSTICK, SOURFACE\n\nAttack vectors: Tools commonly used by APT28 include the SOURFACE downloader, its\nsecond-stage backdoor EVILTOSS and a modular family of implants dubbed CHOPSTICK.\nAPT28 has employed RSA encryption to protect files and stolen information moved from the\nvictim’s network to the controller. It has also made incremental and systematic changes to\nthe SOURFACE downloader and its surrounding ecosystem since 2007, indicating a longstanding and dedicated development effort.\n\n[Additional Resources](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations)\n\n**APT32**\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso known as: OceanLotus Group\n\nSuspected attribution: Vietnam\n\nTarget sectors: Foreign companies investing in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer\nproducts, consulting and hospitality sectors\n\nOverview: Recent activity targeting private interests in Vietnam suggests that APT32 poses a\nthreat to companies doing business, manufacturing or preparing to invest in the country.\nWhile the specific motivation for this activity remains opaque, it could ultimately erode the\ncompetitive advantage of targeted organizations.\n\nAssociated malware: SOUNDBITE, WINDSHIELD, PHOREAL, BEACON, KOMPROGO\n\nAttack vectors: APT32 actors leverage ActiveMime files that employ social engineering\nmethods to entice the victim into enabling macros. Upon execution, the initialized file typically\ndownloads multiple malicious payloads from a remote server. APT32 actors delivers the\nmalicious attachments via spear phishing emails. Evidence has shown that some may have\nbeen sent via Gmail.\n\n\n-----",
