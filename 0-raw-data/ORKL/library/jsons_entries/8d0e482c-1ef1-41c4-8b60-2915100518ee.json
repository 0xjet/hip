The author has since taken down its website and\nsupposedly ceased selling the software, while also renouncing the tool’s use for any\nmalicious purposes. However, as of this writing, the software is still readily available for\ndownload with minimal effort on multiple websites. What’s more, while development of\nKeyBase appears to have stopped, the usage of this malware has increased significantly\nsince June. In our initial report, we identified approximately 1,500 sessions carrying KeyBase\nand approximately six months later we have seen over 4,900 different samples and 44,200\nsessions within Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus.\n\n[One interesting discovery, identified by Unit 42 malware researcher Josh Grunzweig was that](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/author/josh-grunzweig/)\nwhile the KeyBase web panel requires authentication for access, the part of the KeyBase\nweb panel which saves screenshots from the infected computers is not properly locked\ndown, thus requiring no authentication and allowing anyone on the Internet to freely access\nit. This lack of security on the miscreants’ part opens up a window to perform target analysis\nof the infected machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 - Open /Images/ directory\n\nBy leveraging the visibility within AutoFocus along with KeyBase web panels identified\nthrough information sharing groups, 64 websites have been identified hosting 82 active\nKeyBase web panels with a total of 933 infected Windows systems accounting for 125,083\nscreenshots. These images give us a glimpse into what attackers see when they infect\nsystems, what information they obtain outside of the normal keystroke and clipboard logging\ncapabilities of the malware, and how that information may be used for malicious activity. This\nblog post will explain our findings in detail, but here is a short summary of what you’ll see if\nyou read through to the end.\n\nIndia, China, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates are most targeted with\nKeyBase, but the impact is global.\nCompanies in the manufacturing and transportation industries see the most KeyBase\ninfections.\nAttackers captured screenshots of sensitive e-mails, bank account transfers, security\ncameras and hotel management systems.\n\nAttackers who (accidentally) infected their own systems revealed the tactics, tools and\nprocedures they used to launch their attacks.\n\n## Defining terms & the analysis process\n\nBefore we dive into the data, it must be said that since we are analyzing images, we are\nmaking some assumptions. For example, if an image shows an e-mail being composed and\nthe e-mail has a signature at the footer with a company name and position, we assume this\nto be an indicator of the company and user’s role. Similarly, if we see images showing three\ndifferent Facebook accounts logged in during the course of the infection, we assume the\nsystem is a shared resource among multiple people. More often than not, we needed to\ncombine information from multiple screenshots to determine the user or company.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 - Signature based identification on e-mail being composed\n\nThroughout the analysis of the more than 125,000 images, we defined a number of data\npoints to track across all infections. Below is a listing of the categories that will be referenced\nthroughout the rest of this post and a brief definition of what we looked for during analysis.\n\n**Geographic location – Country in which the infected user was located. Typically**\ndetermined via e-mail signature, local events, e-mail content, or corporate location.\n**Industry – Standard industry category names, taken from AutoFocus. Typically**\ndetermined by outside company look-up via the Internet.\n**Company name – Official company name. Typically determined via e-mail signatures,**\ncorporate documentation, desktop images, applications, or logged in accounts.\n**Corporate title – The corporate title displayed by the user of the infected system.**\nTypically determined via e-mail signature or corporate documentation.\n**Corporate data – Information that appears to be internal to the company, such as**\nbudgets, research, salaries, roadmaps, inventory, and logistical information. Typically\ndetermined via e-mail content and corporate documentation.\n**Client data – Information that appears to be related to the corporate business but**\nexposes information of third parties, such as purchase orders, client details, contracts,\nand legal documents. Typically determined via e-mail content, internal applications, or\ncorporate documentation.\n**Shared usage – When the infected system was clearly used by more than one**\nindividual. Typically determined via non-corporate e-mail usage, social media accounts,\nand chat applications.\n**Personal usage – When the infected system appeared to be used for non-corporate**\nactivity, such as social media, watching movies, or playing games. Typically determined\nvia browser activity or application usage.\n**Bank usage – When the infected system was used to conduct online banking**\nactivities. Typically determined via browser activity of online banking websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Lure Subject/Name/Address – Details on phishing e-mails used to deliver the**\nKeyBase malware. Typically determined via e-mail activity.\n**Archive/File Name – Details on archives or files used to deliver the KeyBase malware.**\nTypically determined via e-mail activity or archive applications.\n\n## The Rise of KeyBase\n\nPalo Alto Networks began detecting an increase in KeyBase delivery sessions at the\nbeginning of August 2015 and it began escalating quickly thereafter, with thousands of\nunique samples coming in per month.\n\nFigure 3 – KeyBase malware samples in AutoFocus increase in August 2015\n\nWhen looking at the dates and volumes of images collected, it matched up with the above\nimage data curve, with thousands of screenshots being sent back to KeyBase web panels on\na daily basis.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – Volume of images collected per day from KeyBase web panels\n\nSince the KeyBase builder was leaked, more miscreants have gained access to the software\nand we see this reflected in its proliferation. A side effect, of course, is that once it has\nentered the easily accessible tool population, you have a wide variety of actors using it, with\ndifferent intentions and different techniques. This is where target analysis becomes valuable\nas patterns begin to emerge and you can attempt to discern targeted attacks from\nopportunistic ones.\n\nAcross the set of extracted images, there was an average of 133 images per infection, with\nthe minimum being 1 and the maximum being 5,029; sometimes all that was needed to\nconvey a story was 1 image, while other times hundreds may not be sufficient.\n\nWhen the KeyBase builder generates a new variant of the malware, the user of the\napplication has the ability to specify how often screenshots should be taken, along with the\noption of doing “InstaLogging” screenshots for specific websites, such as Facebook or\nGoogle. We commonly saw screenshot intervals at 1 minute (default), 10 minutes, or 30\nminutes – effectively giving us 1 hour, 1 day, or 2 days of average visibility into a user’s\nactivity.\n\nOne of the challenges faced -- assuming periods of inactivity for user sleep or PC shutoff,\nalong with the time between screenshots -- is that our sample set of useful data can be quite\nsmall, so every screenshot needs to be assessed for minute details. As such, the following\nsections are based on observations made during the analysis of the more than 125,000\nKeyBase screenshots.\n\nOne final point before getting any further into the analysis is that we are looking at pictures\nfrom infected systems and, while we can speculate on how the data might be used, at the\nend of the day we really have no idea how its being used based solely on this information.\n\n\n-----\n\nAre the miscreants really interested in salaries, inventories, design blueprints, research,\ncargo manifests, and internal e-mails with devious plans to exploit the data? Or are they just\nlooking to steal someone’s Facebook password to sell for a quick buck? Towards the end of\nthis blog we’ll also take a look at a number of people who infected themselves with KeyBase,\nwhether for testing or by accident, and see what the bad guys are up to.\n\n## Observations\n\n**Where in the world?**\n\nWe found that infected systems are located primarily in Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East,\nand Africa with the largest infection bases found in India, China, South Korea, and the United\nArab Emirates. The below image represents 342 of the 933 infected systems, identifiable by\nlocation, and their respective volume of images per country.\n\nFigure 5 – Geographic spread of KeyBase malware\n\nTaking a look at Industry, there were 27 different categories identified, with Manufacturing,\nTransportation & Logistics, Wholesale & Retail, and Engineering making up the majority of\ninfected PC’s with corporate data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Industry breakdown\n\nCombining this information and overlaying industry data on top of geographic data, we can\nsee certain countries stand out, possibly implying a concentrated effort to target industries in\nthose locations. More often that not, the screenshots seemed to indicate the infected system\nwas used for company activity versus purely personal usage.\n\n**Manufacturing**\n\nFor the manufacturing industry we see a large concentration in South and East Asia, totaling\n46 different infections across 45 different companies. These companies are heavily focused\non metal materials and products throughout the region. This is not surprising given three of\nthe top five manufacturing economies are based in this geographic area.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Manufacturing: Infection Distribution\n\nWhat stood out across this industry was the usage of websites to buy materials or sell\n[manufactured products. One website that stood out in particular was Alibaba, which is similar](http://www.alibaba.com/)\nto an eBay for manufacturers and suppliers. However, making global trading easier isn’t\npossible without communication and each company has a profile page with a link to contact\nthe business.\n\nFigure 8 - Requests for goods on Alibaba.com\n\nIt’s plausible, given the number of companies infected in the same region, in the same\nindustry, that targets may have been selected via Alibaba or similar websites and delivered\nmalware through their respective listed contact addresses. For the data we have available,\nwe saw corporate titles for the recipients of the malware in five sales roles, three in\npurchasing/supplies, and one in exports.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 - E-mail reply to an Alibaba message\n\nFigure 10 - E-mail reply to an Alibaba message\n\nThe type of data an attacker would see varied greatly for this industry, but it wasn’t\nuncommon to see purchase orders, invoices, quotes, client/customer information,\ninventories, or even designs for products.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 - Invoice data for multiple customers with values\n\nFigure 12 - Drafting document/e-mail for an upcoming quote for their product\n\nFigure 13 - E-mail with designed valve details for client approval\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 - Sales drawing for another product\n\nThere was also at least one seasoning mix that was…well, a little too seasoned as you’ll see\nbelow…\n\n**Transportation and Logistics**\n\nThe second major industry that showed a large set of KeyBase infections is Transportation\nand Logistics. Clustered more dominantly in the Middle East and East Asia, this mainly\nincluded companies specializing in the shipment of freight for import and export.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 – Transportation and Logistics\n\nIt is unknown exactly how a miscreant might use the information from these machines, or\nwhether they have any intent to exploit it, but it does provide interesting data for analysis.\n\nTo illustrate, there were three separate infected systems that showed users logged into\nPakistan’s customs clearing system with the role of “Customs Agent” or “Trader”. Information\nthat the miscreants would see includes container status, goods held within, the recipient, the\nsender, their location in port and vessel, the value of the goods, etc.\n\nFigure 16 - Pakistan Web Based One Customs – “Customs Agent”\n\nFigure 17 - Pakistan Web Based One Customs – “Trader”\n\nOther infected systems showed the cargo booking for both air and sea travel, along with\nmultiple e-mails with their clients organizing this activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18 - Air cargo booking\n\nFigure 19 - Ship cargo booking\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20 - Discussing vessel schedules\n\nAnother infected system in Egypt shows multiple e-mails and invoices for the shipment of\nbeef sold by various companies for transport from Brazil to Egypt.\n\nFigure 21 – Invoice details on 61K lbs of beef costing USD $171,000\n\nFinally, another infection of a logistics company, located in the United Arab Emirates, shows\naccess to their bank accounts and the dollar amounts of transfers that the attackers will likely\nnow have access to.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22 – Bank withdrawals and deposits, with a balance of over USD $500,000\n\nThere were three KeyBase web panels, each had between 5-9 identifiable companies in this\nindustry. Given the nature of the Transportation and Logistics business and making relatively\nlarge financial transfers frequently to cover the costs of moving products around the world\nmay have been a motivator to target this industry.\n\n## Payday Advance\n\nThis brings us to our next tracked data point, bank usage. Out of the infected systems, 33\nwere seen using online banking websites and 28 of those were from systems we tagged as\nhaving “corporate data”. While we do not believe all 28 of these systems did online banking\nfor the company, there were a number of cases where the online banking system showed the\ncompanies’ name and multiple banks would be used by the same infected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23 - Corporate banking account\n\nFigure 24 - Corporate banking account\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25 - Fund transfer receipt for USD $51,500\n\nThese would appear to be of interest to an attacker, as KeyBase malware will log the\ncredentials needed to access these banking sites while the pictures will expose balances\nand other account details.\n\nFigure 26 - Corporate banking account\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27 - Corporate banking account\n\nThe image below shows an e-mail correspondence in which the user of the infected system\nis e-mailing their bank about a payment of USD $1,000,000 that appears to have been\ntransferred to another account while they were in the hospital. This may be unrelated to\nhaving been infected with KeyBase, but it’s enough contextual information, and enough of a\ndollar amount, that it raised red flags for me.\n\n## Doubling Down on Risk\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother group of tracked data points we were interested in was whether it could be\ndetermined that a machine was used for personal, non-business, related activities and\nwhether it was a shared resource.\n\nThe reason this was of interest is that we saw multiple KeyBase delivery campaigns sent via\ne-mail phishing lures, some received on what appeared to be personal accounts while others\non corporate e-mails. The crossover usage of corporate assets for non-corporate activities is\na well-known threat vector, expanding the potential surface area for someone to become\ninfected with malware. Out of the 933 infected systems, there were enough screenshots to\ndetermine that at least 216 of them appeared to only be used for corporate work, 75 were\nused only for personal activities, and 134 of them were used for both corporate and personal\nactivities.\n\nShared assets, in which we would see multiple different identities logged into social media,\ne-mails, or applications, accounted for 43 of the 933 infected systems. These shared\nsystems were in much greater quantity in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nFigure 28 - Shared infected systems\n\nShared systems, of course, increase the risk to the individuals using them, by exposing\nmultiple sets of credentials through one person unknowingly getting the system\ncompromised. In India specifically, we saw this activity frequently in the services industry,\nsuch as travel and tourism companies, or other roles where you move around an office\nfrequently without dedicated assigned systems.\n\nIn an effort to avoid showing multiple Facebook accounts and still keep it somewhat\ninteresting, the below set of images were captured from an infected office PC that sent\nhundreds of screenshots displaying images of their security camera. The middle desk and\ncomputer were frequently used by multiple people, which is likely typical for these smaller\noffices.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29 - Individual 1\n\nFigure 30 - Individual 2\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 31 - Individual 3\n\nFigure 32 - Individual 4\n\n## Tactics\n\nSwitching gears to look at the panels and lures themselves, only four names were shared\namong panel names while the rest were unique values.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 33 - Top 10 panel names\n\nWhile most KeyBase web panels had a one-to-one relation with the site, there were a few\nsites that stood out as hosting multiple web panels – possibly each tied to a different\ncampaign.\n\nFigure 34 - Top 10 domains by number of panels\n\nIt’s also worth nothing that these are only panels that were detected or shared; there are\nmost likely additional panels located on these sites that we have yet to identify.\n\nFor e-mail campaigns, there were multiple clusters of e-mail subjects that were part of the\nphishing lure that stood out.\n\nFigure 35 - Top 10 e-mail lure subjects\n\nTypically, this information could be collected in the first or second screenshot of a set with the\nlure e-mail in the background, and the malicious executable in the foreground.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 36 - KeyBase immediately begins sending back screenshots\n\nThe top e-mail lure, with subject “A320 for ACMI” was particularly interesting, as the A320 is\na single-aisle Airbus jetliner and ACMI stands for “aircraft, complete crew, maintenance, and\ninsurance”, which makes it potentially appealing to targets who work within the aerospace\nindustry. Sure enough, we found multiple targets that match up in this campaign.\n\nFigure 37 - Target in the aerospace industry\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38 - Another target in the aerospace industry\n\nThe rest of the e-mail subjects were largely about purchase orders, inquiries, and other\nfinancial themes. This may explain the high success rates on individuals who fall in sales or\ninformational roles for companies.\n\nWhile there were 49 unique e-mail subjects identified as being part of KeyBase phishing\nlures, there were 65 unique names for archives attached to the e-mails that delivered\nmalware in the form of EXE files, Word documents, and Excel documents.\n\nFigure 39 - Top 10 archive names\n\nThe archives would typically mirror the e-mail subject but, when they didn’t, it was normally\nnamed after the executable file within the archive – which itself was usually a poor attempt to\nmasquerade the underlying executable.\n\nFigure 40 - Top 10 executable names\n\nAnother tactic, whether purposeful or not, was sending English based e-mails to individuals\nin countries where English is not the native language. On at least two occasions we saw the\nrecipients translating the e-mail phishing content with Google Translate services.\n\nThe final thing we’ll talk about in this section is a company in the Healthcare industry that\nshowed an infection on September 7 and then an infection 3 days later on September 10 and\nagain on September 13 What made this one stand out from the others is that the final\n\n\n-----\n\ninfection on September 13 showed that the e-mail, which matched the previously seen\ncontent of the other phishing lures, was sourced from an internal e-mail address of the\ncompany.\n\n## The Others\n\nTo wrap up the target analysis of infected systems, we’re going to point out three more sets\nof data that stood out as interesting from a target perspective.\n\n**Hotel and Hospitality**\n\nOne particular panel/actor targeted the Hospitality industry and infected seven different\nhotels or resorts, specifically the reception desks for these companies.\n\nOne particular panel/actor targeted the Hospitality industry and infected seven different\nhotels or resorts, specifically the reception desks for these companies. Similar to the tactics\npreviously discussed, we see delivery of KeyBase through the “info@” addresses that are\neasy to identify off of the company’s public website.\n\nFigure 41 - Infected receptionist\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 42 - Another infected receptionist\n\nTargeting hotel receptionists provides a lot of interesting data, from guest information and\ntheir home address to travel and payment details; this is all potentially valuable data that may\nbe sold. Below are a couple of screenshots from the various infections to illustrate the type of\ninformation exposed through one of these systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 43 - Guest booking at a hotel\n\nFigure 44 - Guest credit card information\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 45 - Another guest credit card\n\nFigure 46 - Hotel information\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 47- A receptionist PC accessing the hotel camera system\n\n**Education**\n\nThe set for educational institutions wasn’t notably attributable to any one panel, but equally\ndistributed. What made it stand out though is that the same tactic for delivering the KeyBase\nphish was applied here and “Admissions” people were targeted. These individuals are\nconstantly sent Word or PDF documents, allegedly from parents, so it’s no surprise they\nwould open the malicious files.\n\nFigure 48 - Admissions Manager asking parent for medical information via PDF\n\nBeyond e-mails, there was also a fair amount of student details.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 49 - Student list\n\nFigure 50 - Student documents\n\nFinally, the irony of this last one was a little bittersweet…\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 51 - Principal sending out newsletter about Cyber Safety presentation\n\n## Miscreant Selfies\n\nTo bookend the image analysis, we’ll take a look at some of the screenshots from the 16\nactors using KeyBase who infected themselves, whether to validate it works or by accident.\nThese images provide a glimpse into what they do on a daily basis and how they may be\nintending to use the information collected from their KeyBase campaigns.\n\n**Actor 01**\n\nIn the first image, we can see the miscreant taking credentials from the KeyBase password\npanel and logging into multiple web-based e-mails. Subsequent screenshots show the\nindividual going through the e-mails.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 52 - Actor logging into multiple compromised web-based e-mails\n\n**Actor 02**\n\nWe only have two screenshots, but we can see the next actor configuring a cracked\nKeyBase builder and some potential other tools on his or her desktop, such as the SpyGate\nRAT.\n\nFigure 53 - SpyGate RAT\n\n**Actor 03**\n\nThe third actor also shows the cracked KeyBase builder, but they are testing their KeyBase\ngenerated malware against razorscanner multi-engine AV scanner, which returned 2 out of\n24 detections.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 54 - Checking detection count for generated KeyBase malware\n\nThe next couple of screenshots show the actor preparing the malware, most likely an\nattachment to a phishing e-mail.\n\nFigure 55 - Original generated KeyBase malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 56 - Changing the name for attack\n\nAfterwards we see the actor using a combination of Gr3eNoX Exploit Scanner to find\nvulnerable websites off of the Google Dork “germany supplier php?id=bee…” in the\nbackground, with Havij SQL Injection Tool in the foreground testing a site. The Google Dork\nbeing used hints that the industry and geographical targeting may be accurate.\n\nFigure 57 - Attacking a website\n\n**Actor 04**\n\nThe next actor we see going through the entire phishing campaign. Initially the actor moves\nthe KeyBase malware into one of the archives we saw in previous phishing campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 58 - Moving the KeyBase malware into an archive for e-mail\n\nAfterwards, the actor has a conversation over Skype discussing the crafting of the phishing\ne-mail, including signature to use, e-mail subject, content, and attachment details.\n\nFigure 59 - Skype discussion of the phishing lure\n\nThen they login to a compromised company e-mail account and appear to be adding e-mails\nfrom their contact list to a collection of other e-mails.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 60 - Adding info and sales addresses to a Word document\n\nNext they send out the phishing e-mail from the compromised account.\n\nFigure 61 - Sending the phishing e-mail with an archive containing KeyBase malware\n\nAfterwards, we see the pattern repeat but the actor looks up popular Korean women names\nand then uses another compromised e-mail account to send out another round of phishing emails.\n\nFigure 62 - Actor performing research for phishing lure\n\nFigure 63 - Sending out another round of phishing\n\n**Actor 05**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis next actor appears to be purchasing accounts for something, possibly Skype or PayPal,\nand willing to spend $50 per account.\n\nFigure 64 - Discussing purchase of accounts\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 65 - Buying a credit card online, possibly to use to buy the accounts mentioned next\n\nHe’s also trying to aggressively brute-force Skype accounts throughout the screenshot set,\nyet never appears successful.\n\nFigure 66 - Manually scraping proxy data\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 67 - Automated proxy scraping\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 68 - Attempting to brute force Skype accounts with vCrack through proxies\n\n**Actor 06**\n\nThe next actor actually infected three of his or her PCs, for whatever reason, so there were\nplenty of screenshots to go around – including doing Skype with his or her family, school\nprojects, and the account details for the Albanian university he or she attend. Based on the\nactivity, the actor enjoys making what I could only describe as YouTube Albanian Hip-Hop\nlyric videos and reads “hacking tutorials” after unsuccessfully trying to pull off XSS on\nFlickr…they also appear to be a part of the carding scene.\n\nFigure 69 - Miscreants have hobbies too\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 70 - Facebook group for “Kosovo Carders”\n\nFigure 71 - Carders forum\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 72 - Another carder forum\n\nYou also see their recent download history of multiple PayPal brute force type applications\nand then subsequent fraudulent purchases on eBay via Paypal and different e-mails.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 73 - Downloading PayPal brute forcers\n\nFigure 74 - Purchasing items off of eBay with stolen PayPal credentials\n\nLast, we see the actor conversing with another through Facebook as a new KeyBase web\npanel gets stood up.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 75 - Providing the credentials for root access to the server\n\nFigure 76 - New KeyBase web panel being created\n\n**Actor 07**\n\nThis next actor’s resolution was such that the screenshots only captured the top left portion\nof his or her screen; however, it was enough to make some interesting observations on\ntactics. The actor appears to be trying to engage in romance scams with multiple women,\nalong with preying on seniors through dating sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 77 - Sending messages on senior dating site\n\nFigure 78 - Sends the same messages to targets and moves on to IM/e-mail\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 79 - Sending e-mail, presumably to continue the scam\n\nThe actor also has a cache of readily available dating pictures…\n\nFigure 80 - “Oldman datin pics”\n\nWhen they aren’t trying to romance, they are busy trying to scam CEOs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 81 - Writing an e-mail in Notepad – possibly to deliver KeyBase or attempt fraud\n\nFigure 82 - Finding targets on “ceoemail.com”\n\nThe last picture we’ll look at in this set is the actors desktop, which shows the “Invoice”\nKeyBase document and a text file called “Ali baba”, which may add weight to our suspicion\nthat targeting was conducted through this website.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 83 - Actors desktop showing “Ali baba”\n\n**Actor 08**\n\nOur eighth actor up for review is slightly different than the others in that the actor may not\nactually be using KeyBase but is simply a victim of it…bad guys infecting bad guys. Either\nway, we are able to piece together his or her activities through screenshots, with a pattern\nexplained as follows.\n\nThe actor begins with registering domains through GoDaddy and BigRock that follow a\ntheme of web design.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 84 - Registering “getwebsolutionn.com”\n\nTheir next-step is to setup an Office 365 Business Premium Trial account for the newly\ncreated domain.\n\nFigure 85 - Office 365 Business Premium Trial\n\nNext, they add new users to create e-mail addresses under the domain. Note the\n“Burt@getwebsolutionn.com” address, which is used later.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 86 - Adding new users\n\nFigure 87 - Created accounts on Office 365\n\nNext, they send out e-mails from these accounts advertising a company that appears to help\nadvertise businesses and design websites.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 88 - Sending spam e-mails\n\nThis process of registering domains and then sending out spam e-mail through Office 365\nrepeats itself a number of times over the course of the infection. We also get a glimpse into\nsome of the other domains used for the actor’s activity.\n\nFigure 89 - Spam domains\n\nAfterwards, the actor sends an e-mail message with how many people replied to the spam.\nAnother possible scenario is that KeyBase is being used as a way to monitor employees to\nensure they are doing their work.\n\nFigure 90 - Replies to the spam in the background, leads e-mail in the foreground\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 91 - The next day leads\n\n**Actor 09 / 10**\n\nThe last two actors we’ll cover with one screenshot from each, both using a similar tactic of\nsending the phishing e-mail with bulk e-mailers.\n\nFigure 92 - Sending phishing e-mail with Advanced Mass Sender\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 93 - Sending phishing e-mail with Turbo-Mailer\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur analysis provides a unique opportunity to see the entire life cycle of a malware infection.\nCommonly, we’d see the first image in a set to be the KeyBase executable or malicious\ndocument all the way through until the Anti-Virus alerts of an infection. Sometimes that\nhappened all within one screenshot.\n\nFigure 94 - Infection and detection\n\nKeyBase isn’t actively being developed, but we believe its use will continue to rise given its\nexisting capabilities and easy-to-use builder.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe idiom that a picture is worth a thousand words holds true, especially if you ve made it\nthis far. KeyBase is loaded with features but the screenshot capability has proved to be\nparticularly useful with the context it provides by marrying surrounding information to logged\nkeystrokes. From a target analysis perspective, it gives us some insight into the type of\ncompanies, or people, the miscreants are going after, and hopefully this blog has shed some\nlight on the potential data that gets exposed through screenshots alone.\n\nThreat Prevention customers are protected from this threat by the KeyBase command and\n[control traffic signature.
