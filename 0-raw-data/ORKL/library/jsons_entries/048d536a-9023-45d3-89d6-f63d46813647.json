The threat actor targeted the company’s\ntop-level management by using spear-phishing attacks as the initial penetration vector,\nultimately compromising the computers of vice presidents, senior directors and other key\npersonnel in the operational departments. During Operation Cobalt Kitty, the attackers\ncompromised more than 40 PCs and servers, including the domain controller, file servers,\nWeb application server and database server.\n\n\n-----\n\nWant to hear about another high-impact operation?\n\n## OPERATION COBALT\n\nForensic artifacts revealed that the attackers persisted on the network for at least a year\nbefore Cybereason was deployed. The adversary proved very adaptive and responded to\ncompany’s security measures by periodically changing tools, techniques and procedures\n(TTPs), allowing them to persist on the network for such an extensive period of time. Over 80\npayloads and numerous domains were observed in this operation - all of which were\nundetected by traditional security products deployed in the company’s environment at the\ntime of the attack.\n\nThe attackers arsenal consisted of modified publicly-available tools as well as six\nundocumented custom-built tools, which Cybereason considers the threat actor’s signature\ntools. Among these tools are two backdoors that exploited DLL sideloading attack\nin Microsoft, Google and Kaspersky applications. In addition, they developed a novel and\nstealthy backdoor that targets Microsoft Outlook for command-and-control channel and data\nexfiltration.\n\nBased on the tools, modus operandi and IOCs (indicators of compromise) observed in\nOperation Cobalt Kitty, Cybereason attributes this large-scale cyber espionage APT to the\n[“OceanLotus Group” (which is also known as, APT-C-00, SeaLotus and](https://ti.360.com/upload/report/file/OceanLotusReport.pdf) [APT32). For detailed](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html)\ninformation tying Operation Cobalt Kitty to the OceanLotus Group, please see our Attacker’s\nArsenal and Threat Actor Profile sections.\n\n[Cybereason also attributes the recently reported Backdoor.Win32.Denis to the OceanLotus](https://securelist.com/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/78203/)\nGroup, which at the time of this report’s writing, had not been officially linked to this threat\nactor.\n\nFinally, this report offers a rare glimpse into what a cyber espionage APT looks like \"underthe-hood\". Cybereason was able to monitor and detect the entire attack lifecycle, from\ninfiltration to exfiltration and all the steps in between.\n\nOur report contains the following detailed sections (PDF):\n\n### High-level attack outline: A cat-and-mouse game in four acts\n\nThe following sections outline the four phases of the attack as observed by Cybereason’s\nanalysts, who were called to investigate the environment after the company’s IT department\nsuspected that their network was breached but could not trace the source.\n\n### Phase one: Fileless operation (PowerShell and Cobalt Strike payloads)\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the forensic evidence collected from the environment, phase one was the\ncontinuation of the original attack that began about a year before Cybereason was deployed\n[in the environment. During that phase, the threat actor operated a fileless PowerShell-based](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/fileless-malware)\ninfrastructure, using customized PowerShell payloads taken from known offensive\nframeworks such as [Cobalt Strike,](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon) [PowerSploit and](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) [Nishang.](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)\n\nThe initial penetration vector was carried out by social engineering. Carefully selected group\nof employees received spear-phishing emails, containing either links to malicious sites or\nweaponized Word documents. These documents contained malicious macros that created\npersistence on the compromised machine using two scheduled tasks, whose purpose was to\ndownload secondary payloads (mainly Cobalt Strike Beacon):\n\n**Scheduled task 1: Downloads a COM scriptlet that redirects to Cobalt Strike payload:**\n\n**Scheduled task 2: Uses Javascript to download a Cobalt Strike Beacon:**\n\nSee more detailed analysis of the malicious documents in our Attack Life Cycle section.\n\n### Fileless payload delivery infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the first phase of the attack, the attackers used a fileless in-memory payload delivery\ninfrastructure consisting of the following components:\n\n1. VBS and PowerShell-based loaders\n\nThe attackers dropped Visual Basic and PowerShell scripts in folders that they created under\nthe ProgramData (a hidden folder, by default). The attackers created persistence using\nWindows’ registry, services and scheduled tasks. This persistence mechanism ensured that\nthe loader scripts would execute either at startup or at predetermined intervals.\n\nValues found in Windows’ Registry: the VBS scripts are executed by Windows’ Wscript at\nstartup:\n\nThe .vbs scripts as well as the .txt files contain the loader’s script, which launches\nPowerShell with a base64 encoded command, which either loads another PowerShell script\n(e.g Cobalt Strike Beacon) or fetches a payload from the command-and-control (C&C)\nserver:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. In-memory fileless payloads from C&C servers\n\nThe payloads served by the C&C servers are mostly PowerShell scripts with embedded\nbase64-encoded payloads (Metasploit and Cobalt Strike payloads):\n\n**Example 1: PowerShell payload with embedded Shellcode downloading Cobalt Strike**\n**Beacon**\n\nThe decoded payload is a shellcode, whose purpose is to retrieve a Cobalt Strike Beacon\nfrom the C&C server:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example 2: Cobalt Strike Beacon embedded in obfuscated PowerShell**\n\nA second type of an obfuscated PowerShell payload consisted of Cobalt Strike’s Beacon\npayload:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Less than 48 hours after Cybereason alerted the company about the breach, the**\nattackers started to change their approach and almost completely abandoned the\nPowerShell infrastructure that they had been using - replacing it with sophisticated custombuilt backdoors. The attackers’ remarkable ability to quickly adapt demonstrated their skill\nand familiarity with and command of the company’s network and its operations.\n\nThe attackers most likely replaced the PowerShell infrastructure after the company used\nboth Windows Group Policy Object (GPO) and Cybereason’s execution prevention feature to\nprevent PowerShell execution.\n\n### Phase two: Backdoors exploiting DLL-hijacking and using DNS tunneling\n\nAfter realizing that the PowerShell infrastructure had been discovered, the attackers had to\nquickly replace it to maintain persistence and continue the operation. Replacing this\ninfrastructure in 48 hours suggests that the threat actors were prepared for such a scenario.\n\nDuring the second phase of the attack, the attackers introduced two sophisticated\n**backdoors that they attempted to deploy on selected targets. The introduction of the**\nbackdoors is a key turning point in the investigation since it demonstrated the threat actor’s\nresourcefulness and skill-set.\n\n**At the time of the attack, these backdoors were undetected and undocumented by any**\nsecurity vendor. Recently, Kaspersky researchers identified a variant of one of the backdoors\nas [Backdoor.Win32.Denis. The attackers had to make sure that they remained undetected](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\nso the backdoors were designed to be as stealthy as possible. To avoid being discovered,\nthe malware authors used these techniques:\n\n**Backdoors exploiting DLL hijacking against trusted applications**\n\n[The backdoor exploited a vulnerability called “DLL hijacking” in order to “hide” the malware](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/dll-hijacking-attacks-revisited/)\ninside trusted software. This technique exploits a security vulnerability found in legitimate\nsoftware, which allows the attackers to load a fake DLL and execute its malicious code.\n\nPlease see an analysis of the backdoors in the Attacker’s Arsenal section.\n\nThe attackers exploited this vulnerability against the following trusted applications:\n\n**Windows Search (vulnerable applications: searchindexer.exe**\n/searchprotoclhost.exe)\n\n**Fake DLL: msfte.dll (638b7b0536217c8923e856f4138d9caff7eb309d)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Google Update (d30e8c7543adbc801d675068530b57d75cabb13f)**\n\n**Fake DLL: goopdate.dll (973b1ca8661be6651114edf29b10b31db4e218f7)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Kaspersky’s Avpia (691686839681adb345728806889925dc4eddb74e)**\n\n**Fake DLL: product_info.dll (3cf4b44c9470fb5bd0c16996c4b2a338502a7517)**\n\n\n-----\n\nBy exploiting legitimate software, the attackers bypassed application whitelisting and\nlegitimate security software, allowing them to continue their operations without raising any\nsuspicions.\n\n**DNS Tunneling as C2 channel -**\n\n[In attempt to overcome network filtering solutions, the attackers implemented a stealthier C2](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\n[communication method, using “DNS Tunneling” – a method of C2 communicating and data](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/dns-tunnelling/#gref)\nexfiltration using the DNS protocol. To ensure that the DNS traffic would not be filtered, the\nattackers configured the backdoor to communicate with Google and OpenDNS DNS servers,\nsince most organizations and security products will not filter traffic to those two major DNS\nservices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot below shows the traffic generated by the backdoor and demonstrates DNS\nTunneling for C2 communication. As shown, while the destination IP is “8.8.8.8” – Google’s\nDNS server – the malicious domain is “hiding” inside the DNS packet:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phase three: Novel MS Outlook backdoor and lateral movement spree\n\nIn the third phase of the operation, the attackers harvested credentials stored on the\ncompromised machines and performed lateral movement and infected new machines. The\nattackers also introduced a very rare and stealthy technique to communicate with their\nservers and exfiltrate data using Microsoft Outlook.\n\n### Outlook macro backdoor\n\nIn a relentless attempt to remain undetected, the attackers devised a very stealthy C2\nchannel that is hard to detect since it leverages an email-based C2 channel. The attackers\n**installed a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook that enabled them to execute**\ncommands, deploy their tools and steal valuable data from the compromised machines.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the Outlook backdoor, please see the Attacker’s Arsenal section.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis technique works as follows:\n\n1. The malicious macro scans the victim’s Outlook inbox and looks for the strings\n\n**“$$cpte” and “$$ecpte”.**\n2. Then the macro will open a CMD shell that will execute whatever instruction /\n\ncommand is in between the strings.\n3. The macro deletes the message from inbox to ensure minimal risk of exposure.\n4. The macro searches for the special strings in the “Deleted Items” folder to find the\n\nattacker’s email address and sends the data back to the attackers via email.\n5. Lastly, the macro will delete any evidence of the emails received or sent by the\n\nattackers.\n\n### Credential dumping and lateral movement\n\nThe attackers used the famous **[Mimikatz credential dumping tool as their main tool to obtain](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)**\ncredentials including user passwords, NTLM hashes and Kerberos tickets. Mimikatz is a very\npopular tool and is detected by most antivirus vendors and other security products.\nTherefore, the attackers used over 10 different customized Mimikatz payloads, which were\nobfuscated and packed in a way that allowed them to evade antivirus detection.\n\nThe following are examples of Mimikatz command line arguments detected during the attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stolen credentials were used to infect more machines, leveraging Windows built-in tools\nas well as [pass-the-ticket and](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1097) [pass-the-hash attacks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash)\n\n### Phase four: New arsenal and attempt to restore PowerShell infrastructure\n\nAfter a four week lull and no apparent malicious activity, the attackers returned to the scene\nand introduced new and improved tools aimed at bypassing the security mitigations that\nwere implemented by the company’s IT team. These tools and methods mainly allowed\n**them to bypass the PowerShell execution restrictions and password dumping**\n**mitigations.**\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring that phase, Cybereason found a compromised server that was used as the main\nattacking machine, where the attackers stored their arsenal in a network share, which made\nit easier to spread their tools to other machines on the network. The attackers’ arsenal\nconsisted:\n\n**New variants of Denis and Goopy backdoors**\n**PowerShell Restriction Bypass Tool** **- Adapted from** [PSUnlock Github project.](https://github.com/p3nt4/PSUnlock)\n**PowerShell Cobalt Strike Beacon - New payload + new C2 domain**\n**PowerShell Obfuscator - All the new PowerShell payloads are obfuscated using a**\n**publicly available script adapted from a Daniel Bohannon’s GitHub** **[project.](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation/blob/master/Invoke-Obfuscation.ps1)**\n**HookPasswordChange** **[- Inspired by tools found](https://gist.github.com/mubix/6514311#file-evilpassfilter-cpp)** [on GitHub, this tool alerts the](https://github.com/clymb3r/Misc-Windows-Hacking/blob/master/HookPasswordChange/HookPasswordChange/HookPasswordChange.cpp)\nattackers if a password has been changed. Using this tool, the attackers could\novercome a password reset. The attackers modified their tool.\n**Customized Windows Credentials Dumper - A PowerShell password dumper that is**\n[based on a known password dumping tool, using PowerShell bypass and reflective](http://www.oxid.it/downloads/vaultdump.txt)\nloading. The attackers specifically used it to obtain Outlook passwords.\n**Customized Outlook Credentials Dumper - Inspired by known Outlook**\n**credentials dumpers.**\n**Mimikatz - PowerShell and Binary versions, with multiple layers of obfuscation.**\n\nPlease see the Attacker’s Arsenal section for detailed analysis of the tools.\n\nAn analysis of this arsenal shows that the attackers went out of their way to restore the\nPowerShell-based infrastructure, even though it had already been detected and shut down\nonce. The attackers’ preference to use a fileless infrastructure specifically in conjunction with\nCobalt Strike is very evident. This could suggest that the attackers preferred to use known\ntools that are more expendable rather than using their own custom-built tools, which were\nused as a last resort.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOperation Cobalt Kitty was a major cyber espionage APT that targeted a global corporation\nin Asia and was carried out by the OceanLotus Group. The analysis of this APT proves how\ndetermined and motivated the attackers were. They continuously changed techniques and\nupgraded their arsenal to remain under the radar. In fact, they never gave up, even when the\nattack was exposed and shut down by the defenders.\n\nDuring the investigation of Operation Cobalt Kitty, Cybereason uncovered and analyzed new\ntools in the OceanLotus Group’s attack arsenal, such as:\n\nNew backdoor (“Goopy”) using HTTP and DNS Tunneling for C2 communication.\nUndocumented backdoor that used Outlook for C2 communication and data exfiltration.\nBackdoors exploiting DLL sideloading attacks in legitimate applications from Microsoft,\nGoogle and Kaspersky.\n\n\n-----\n\nThree customized credential dumping tools, which are inspired by known tools.\n\n[In addition, Cybereason uncovered new variants of the “Denis” backdoor and managed to](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78203/use-of-dns-tunneling-for-cc-communications/)\nattribute the backdoor to the OceanLotus Group - a connection that had not been publicly\nreported before.\n\nThis report provides a rare deep dive into a sophisticated APT that was carried out by one of\nthe most fascinating groups operating in Asia. The ability to closely monitor and detect the\nstages of an entire APT lifecycle - from initial infiltration to data exfiltration - is far from trivial.\n\nThe fact that most of the attackers’ tools were not detected by the antivirus software and\nother security products deployed in the company’s environment before Cybereason, is not\nsurprising. The attackers obviously invested significant time and effort in keeping the\noperation undetected, striving to evade antivirus detection.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, some of the IOCs observed in Operation Cobalt Kitty started\n[to emerge in the wild, and recently some were even reported being used in other campaigns.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html)\nIt is important to remember, however, that IOCs have a tendency to change over time.\nTherefore, understanding a threat actor’s behavioral patterns is essential in combatting\nmodern and sophisticated APTs. The modus operandi and tools served as behavioral\nfingerprints also played an important role in tying Operation Cobalt Kitty to the OceanLotus\nGroup.\n\nLastly, our research provides an important testimony to the capabilities and working methods\nof the OceanLotus Group. Operation Cobalt Kitty is unique in many ways, nonetheless, it is\nstill just one link in the group’s ever-growing chain of APT campaigns. Orchestrating multiple\nAPT campaigns in parallel and attacking a broad spectrum of targets takes an incredible\namount of resources, time, manpower and motivation. This combination is likely to be more\ncommon among nation-state actors. While the are many rumours and speculations\ncirculating in the InfoSec community, at the time of writing, there was no publicly available\nevidence that can confirm that the OceanLotus Group is a nation-state threat actor.\n\nUntil such evidence is made public, we will leave it to our readers to judge for themselves.\n\nTo be continued ...
