    "plain_text": "# The Kittens Are Back in Town 2 – Charming Kitten Campaign Keeps Going on, Using New Impersonation Methods\n\n**clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town-2**\n\nby ClearSky Research Team October 7, 2019\n\nOn the 15 of September 2019, we have published a report[1] about a sharp increase inth\nCharming Kitten attacks against researchers from the US, Middle East, and France, focusing on\nIranian academic researchers, Iranian dissidents in the US. In our last report, we exposed a new\ncyber espionage campaign that was conducted in July 2019. Since then, we observed another\nwave of these attacks, leveraging new impersonating vectors and IOCs.\n\nUntil these days, Iran was not known as a country who tends to interfere in elections around the\nworld. From a historical perspective, this type of cyber activity had been attributed mainly to the\nRussian APT groups such as APT28 (known as Fancy Bear). The group is infamous for hacking\nAmerican Democratic National Committee emails and targeting German and French campaign\nmembers, in an attempt to circumvent the elections in the US, Germany, and France.\n\nMicrosoft’s October announcement exposes, for the first time, that Charming Kitten, an Iranian\n**APT group, plays a role in the domain of cyber-attacks for the purpose of interfering with**\n**democratic procedures.**\n\n\nOn 4 of October 2019[2], Microsoft has announced that Phosphorus (known as Charming Kitten)th\nattempted to attack email accounts that are associated with the following targets: U.S.\npresidential campaign, current, and former U.S. government officials, journalists covering global\npolitics, and prominent Iranians living outside Iran. These spear-phishing attacks were conducted\nby Charming Kitten in August and September. We evaluate in a medium-high level of\n**confidence, that Microsoft’s discovery and our findings in our previous and existing**\n**reports is a congruent operation.**\n\n**[Read the full report: The Kittens Are Back in Town 2](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Kittens-Are-Back-in-Town-2.pdf)**\n\nOur evaluation based on the following issues:\n\n1. Same victim profiles – In both cases, the victims were individuals of interest to Iran in the\n\nfields of academic research, human rights, opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s\nregime (such as NIAC) and journalists. Although the congruent is not exactly similar, our\nsample is mainly based on Israeli victims.\n2. Time overlapping – In our latest report, we mentioned that we have observed an\n\nescalation of the attacks in July-August 2019. In their announcement, Microsoft mentioned\nthat the attacks occurred on ‘In a 30-day period between August and September’.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Similar attack vectors – In both cases, Charming Kitten used similar attack vectors which\n\nare:\n\n1. Password recovery impersonation of the secondary email belonging to the victims in\n\nboth cases.\n2. Both attack vectors used spear-phishing emails in order to target Microsoft, Google\n\nand Yahoo services.\n3. In our research, we identified a spear-phishing attack via SMS messages, indicating\n\nthat Charming Kitten gathers phone numbers of the relevant victim. Microsoft found\nthat Charming Kitten gathers phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor\nauthentications of the relevant victims to gain control of their email accounts.\n\nIn this report, we uncovered four new spear-phishing methods used by this group, alongside with\nnew indicators of this operation.\n\n**Indicators of compromise are available for subscribers of the ClearSky threat intelligence**\n**service in MISP events 1745.**\n\n[[1] https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/](https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/)\n\n[[2] https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=3211&action=edit#_ftnref1)\nvigilant/\n\n\n-----",
