    "plain_text": "MALWARE PROFILE\n\n# Kraken Cryptor Ransomware Gains Popularity Among Cybercriminals\n\n## By Alexandr Solad and Daniel Hatheway  Co-Authored by Marc Rivero López and John Fokker of McAfee\n\n\n-----\n\n_Scope Note: Insikt Group used the Recorded Future product and dark web analysis_\n_to track the activity of threat actor ThisWasKraken, who operates the Kraken Cryptor_\n_ransomware affiliate program on a top-tier Russian-speaking criminal forum._\n\n_Insikt Group collaborated with researchers at McAfee. Ransomware continually_\n_represents a major risk to organizations, and the target audience of this research_\n_includes day-to-day security practitioners as well as executive decision makers._\n\n_[Click here to read the McAfee report.](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/fallout-exploit-kit-releases-the-kraken-ransomware-on-its-victims)_\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nKraken Cryptor is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program\nthat was introduced on August 16, 2018, on a top-tier Russianspeaking cybercriminal forum by the threat actor ThisWasKraken.\nKraken Cryptor has gained popularity among members of the\ndark web, has been used to target users of the popular antivirus\nprogram SuperAntiSpyware, and has also been distributed through\nthe Fallout exploit kit.\n\n### Key Judgments\n\n - The Kraken Cryptor ransomware was first seen in the wild in\n\n[August 2018.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kraken-cryptor-ransomware-masquerading-as-superantispyware-security-program/)\n\n - Kraken is distributed by members of an affiliate program\n\noperated by ThisWasKraken, who is only active on Russian\ncriminal forums.\n\n - To distribute malware, ThisWasKraken and/or its affiliates\n\nlikely use the Fallout exploit kit.\n\n - We have identified that ThisWasKraken is using online casino\n\nBitcoinPenguin to launder illicitly gained funds.\n\n - Insikt Group assesses with a high degree of confidence that\n\nThisWasKraken works within a team, whose members could\nbe residing in Iran, Brazil, or former Soviet bloc countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Background\n\nThe Kraken Cryptor ransomware is a connectionless strain of\nransomware that communicates with victims via email in place of\nany command and control (C2) infrastructure or landing pages.\nKraken was first observed in the wild in August 2018 and [gained](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kraken-cryptor-ransomware-masquerading-as-superantispyware-security-program/)\n[notoriety when it was distributed from the compromised website](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kraken-cryptor-ransomware-masquerading-as-superantispyware-security-program/)\nof SuperAntiSpyware, disguised as the antivirus program.[1] Kraken\nhas also [been distributed to victims via spam and malvertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fallout-exploit-kit-now-installing-the-kraken-cryptor-ransomware/)\ncampaigns, some of which redirect to the Fallout exploit kit for the\nfinal installation phase.\n\nInsikt Group has attributed the Kraken Cryptor ransomware to the\nthreat actor ThisWasKraken, who operates the affiliate program that\ngives other actors access to Kraken for distribution. ThisWasKraken\nis relatively new to the dark web and is exclusively active on a\nRussian criminal forum, where the actor registered on August 12,\n2018. The actor communicates using Russian and English; however,\nthe analysis of their forum posts indicate that ThisWasKraken is\nneither a native Russian nor English speaker. To make forum posts\nin Russian, the actor likely uses automated translation services, as\nis evident by the awkward phrasing indicative of such a service. In\ncontrast, the actor is noticeably more proficient in English, though\nthey make mistakes consistently in both sentence structure and\nspelling.\n\n1 It should be noted that the Kraken Cryptor ransomware is different from the Kraken\nransomware widely distributed in 2016, and is not linked to another ransomware strain\n[detected in 2013 that used the “.kraken” extension.](https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2016/12/kraken-ransomware.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Advertisement for the Kraken Cryptor v2 affiliate program on a criminal forum._\n\nThe Kraken Cryptor ransomware is not sold to users on a one-time\nbasis. It is instead operated as an affiliate program that distributes\nbuilds of the ransomware to its participants, who in turn repay\na percentage of the income earned from ransom payments. This\ntechnique of ransomware distribution, known as ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS), is commonly used on the dark web by cybercriminals\nbecause of its efficiency. ThisWasKraken calls the service the Kraken\nCryptor v2 affiliate program, or Kraken ransomware-as-a-service,\nwhich was last updated on October 21. The latest version of the\nKraken Cryptor is v.2.0.7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kraken Cryptor ransomware v.2.0.7 ransom note with instructions for how to decrypt infected files._\n\nAt the time of this report, the Kraken Cryptor ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) required all potential affiliate partners to pay $50\nper payload. Below are some of the terms and conditions of the\naffiliate program:\n\n - Affiliates receive 80 percent of the paid ransom.\n\n - The program can reject any member or candidate without\n\nexplanation.\n\n - Affiliates receive a 24/7 support service.\n\n - Submitting Kraken sample files to antivirus services is\n\nforbidden.\n\n - The service provides no refunds for purchased payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n_ThisWasKraken introduced the Kraken Cryptor ransomware on a criminal forum on August 16, 2018._\n\n**Threat Analysis**\n\nAccording to ThisWasKraken, the Kraken Cryptor RaaS does not\nallow the targeting of the following former Soviet bloc countries:\n\n - Armenia\n\n - Azerbaijan\n\n - Belarus\n\n - Estonia\n\n - Georgia\n\n - Kyrgyzstan\n\n - Kazakhstan\n\n - Lithuania\n\n - Latvia\n\n - Moldova\n\n - Russia\n\n - Tajikistan\n\n - Turkmenistan\n\n - Ukraine\n\n - Uzbekistan\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the countries listed above, the latest samples of\nKraken that have been identified in the wild no longer affect victims\nin Syria, Brazil, and Iran, suggesting that ThisWasKraken (or their\n[associates) may have some connection to Brazil and Iran, though](https://brica.de/alerts/alert/public/1229334/kraken-cryptor-ransomware-masquerading-as-superantispyware-security-program/)\nthis is not confirmed. It is likely that Syria was added following\nthe plea for help from a victim whose computer was infected by\nanother ransomware called GandCrab.\n\nAccording to the map of infections provided below, we can still see\na minor level of infections in excluded countries, despite specific\nfail-safe controls put in place by Kraken developers.\n\nEach affiliate of Kraken Cryptor RaaS receives a unique build of\nKraken and must send the following information to ThisWasKraken\nto be configured:\n\n - A primary email address to communicate with victims\n\n - An alternative email address to communicate with victims\n\n - A ransom amount in Bitcoin, usually varying from 0.075 to\n\n1.25 BTC\n\n - A list of countries not to target\n\nThe analysis of the actor’s communication suggests that\nThisWasKraken is likely part of a team and not personally involved\nin the development of the ransomware directly. The actor’s role is\ncustomer facing, which is accomplished through the Jabber account\nthiswaskraken@exploit[.]im. Communications with ThisWasKraken\nshow that the actor refers all technical issues to the product support\nteam at the email address teamxsupport@protonmail[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitcoin is the only currency the affiliate program uses, and Insikt\nGroup identified several wallets associated with the operation.\nInterestingly, it appears that Kraken's developers choose\nBitcoinPenguin, an online gambling site, as the primary money\nlaundering conduit. Although not unusual, it is still very uncommon\nfor criminal actors — specifically ransomware operators — to depart\nfrom more traditional cryptocurrency exchangers when laundering\nstolen funds. It is likely that one of the decisive factors for this\nunusual choice was due to the fact that BitcoinPenguin does not\nrequire any identity verification of its members, allowing anyone to\nmaintain an anonymous cryptocurrency wallet there. Cryptocurrency\nexchangers are continuing to stiffen their registration rules in\nresponse to regulatory demands, but online crypto casinos do not\nhave to follow the same “know your customer” (KYC) guidelines,\nproviding a convenient loophole for all kinds of money launderers.\n\n_Bitcoin transactions associated with Kraken and analyzed with the Crystal Blockchain software._\n\nOn October 4, 2018, BleepingComputer [reported that the Fallout](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fallout-exploit-kit-now-installing-the-kraken-cryptor-ransomware/)\nexploit kit was being used to deliver the Kraken Cryptor ransomware\nv.1.5. It should be noted that on multiple occasions, ThisWasKraken\nmentioned the Fallout exploit kit and praised it for its high infection\nrate. At one point, ThisWasKraken even stated, “One of our partners\njoined the Fallout exploit kit, which is good for us.” Also, other\nforum messages indicate that ThisWasKraken purchased hijacked\nweb traffic, which may be the same traffic responsible for Kraken\ninfections from the Fallout exploit kit.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Graphic posted by ThisWasKraken showing web traffic used to distribute the Kraken Cryptor RaaS by country._\n\nBelow are the technical specifications of the the Kraken Cryptor\nransomware v.2.0.7 posted by ThisWasKraken on October 21, 2018:\n\n - The ransomware is written in C# (NET. Framework v. 3.5).\n\n - The ransomware works offline and supports communication\n\nvia email.\n\n - The size of the payload is around 85 KB, but antivirus analysis\n\nindicates that the payload size often reaches up to 94 KB.\n\n - Kraken primarily targets Windows OS versions 8, 8.1, and 10.\n\n - Kraken has a high speed of encryption.\n\n - There is no file size limit for encryption process.\n\n - The ransomware collects system information when victims are\n\nonline.\n\n - Kraken uses a hybrid encryption algorithm, including AES\n128/256 (CBC mode), as well as other ciphers (RSA, Salsa20,\nRC4).\n\n\n-----\n\n - The ransomware uses a smart obfuscation encryption method\n\nto target random positions of files, including network sharing\nencryption.\n\n - The ransomware encrypts storage devices on shared\n\nnetworks.\n\n - It is impossible to recover without paying the ransom.\n\n - Anti-debugging and anti-forensics tools are included in the\n\npackage.\n\n - Ransom messages are available in 15 languages in HTML and\n\nTXT formats.\n\n - “Canary trap” anti-ransomware bypass methods are applied to\n\nidentify key leaks.\n\n - Infection statistics are based on IPs.\n\nAffiliates are given a new build of Kraken every 15 days to keep the\npayload fully undetectable (FUD) from antivirus software. According\nto ThisWasKraken, when a victim asks for a free decryption test,\nthe affiliate member should send one of the victim’s files with\nits associated unique key to the Kraken Cryptor ransomware\nsupport service. The service will decrypt the file and resend it\nto the affiliate member to forward to the victim. After the victim\npays the full ransom, the affiliate member sends 20 percent of\nthe received payment to the RaaS to get a decryptor key, which is\nthen forwarded on to the victim. This system ensures the affiliate\npays their percentage to the affiliate program and does not simply\npocket the full amount for themselves.\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nThe following technical analysis was conducted by McAfee’s\nAdvanced Threat Research team and the results were shared with\nRecorded Future.\n\nThe Kraken Cryptor ransomware encrypts data on the disk very\nquickly and uses external tools, such as SDelete from the Sysinternals\nSuite, to wipe files, making file recovery harder.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The Kraken Cryptor infection scheme through the Fallout exploit kit._\n\nThe ransomware implements a user account control (UAC) bypass\nusing the Windows Event Viewer. This bypass technique is used by\nother malware families and is quite effective for executing malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The ransomware uses Windows Event Viewer to bypass UAC._\n\n[The technique is well explained in an article by blogger enigma0x3.](https://enigma0x3.net/2016/08/15/fileless-uac-bypass-using-eventvwr-exe-and-registry-hijacking/)\n\nMcAfee analyzed an early subset of Kraken ransomware samples\nand determined that they were still in the testing phase, adding and\nremoving options. The ransomware implemented a “protection” to\ndelete itself during the infection phase:\n\n - C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /C ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3 >\n\nNUL&&del /Q /F /S\n\n - C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\n\nkrakentemp0000.exe\n\nThis step is to prevent researchers and endpoint protections from\ncatching the file on an infected machine.\n\nKraken encrypts user files with a random name and drops the\nransom note demanding that the victim pay to recover them. Each\nfile extension is different; this technique is often used by specific\nransomware families to bypass endpoint protection systems.\n\nKraken, delivered by the exploit kit, bypasses the UAC using Event\nViewer, drops a file on the system, and executes it through the UAC\nbypass method.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The binary delivered by the exploit kit._\n\nDuring the compilation of the first versions, the authors of the\nbinary forgot to delete the PDB reference, revealing that the file\nhas a relationship with Kraken Cryptor.\n\n_An early version of the ransomware with the path on Disk C._\n\nThe early versions contained the following path:\n\n - C:\\Users\\Krypton\\source\\repos\\UAC\\UAC\\obj\\\\Release\\UAC.\n\npdb\n\nLater versions “dropped” the PDB path together with the Kraken\nloader.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Using Sysinternals Tools for Harder File Recovery_**\n\nOne unique feature of this ransomware family is the use of SDelete.\nKraken uses a .bat file to perform certain operations, making file\nrecovery much more challenging:\n\n_Kraken Cryptor v.1.6 with SDelete bat file makes file recovery harder._\n\nKraken downloads SDelete from the Sysinternals website, adds the\nregistry key, accepting the EULA to avoid the pop up, and executes\nit with the following arguments:\nsdelete.exe -c -z C\n\nThe SDelete batch file makes file recovery much harder by\noverwriting all free space on the drive with zeros, deleting the\nVolume Shadow Copies, disabling the recovery reboot option, and\nfinally, rebooting the system after 300 seconds.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Netguid Comparison_**\n\nEarlier versions of Kraken were delivered by a loader before it\nmoved to a direct execution method. The loader we examined\ncontained a specific netguid. With this, McAfee found additional\nsamples of the Kraken loader on VirusTotal:\n\n_Additional hash values found on VirusTotal._\n\nNot only did the loader have a specific netguid, but the compiled\nversions of Kraken also shared a netguid, making it possible to\ncontinue hunting samples:\n\n_Additional hash values detected._\n\n**_Comparing Versions_**\n\nKraken uses a configuration file in every version to set the variables\nfor the ransomware. This file is easily extracted for additional\nanalysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image of the configuration file of Kraken Cryptor._\n\nBased on the configuration file, McAfee discovered nine versions\nof Kraken:\n\n - 1.2\n\n - 1.3\n\n - 1.5\n\n - 1.5.2\n\n - 1.5.3\n\n - 1.6\n\n - 2.0\n\n - 2.0.4\n\n - 2.0.7\n\nBy extracting the configuration files from all of the versions, McAfee\nbuilt the following overview of features (the checkmark means the\nfeature is present):\n\n_Overview of the features of all identified versions of the ransomware_\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of the versions we examined mostly contain the same options,\ndiffering only in some of the anti-virtual protection and antiforensic capabilities. The latest version, Kraken 2.0.7, changed its\nconfiguration scheme and is covered later.\n\nOther differences in Kraken’s configuration file include the list of\ncountries excluded from encryption. The standouts are Brazil and\nSyria, which were not named in the original forum advertisement.\n\nHaving an exclusion list is a common method for cybercriminals to\navoid prosecution. Brazil’s addition to the list in Version 1.5 suggests\nthe involvement of a Brazilian affiliate. The following table shows\nthe exclusion list by country and version (the checkmark means the\ncountry appears on the list):\n\n_Exclusion list by country and version indicates the list of countries that are not allowed to attack._\n\nAll of the Kraken releases have excluded the same countries, except\nfor Brazil, Iran, and Syria.[2]\n\n2 McAfee believes that the creators of Kraken had the same change of heart as the actors\nbehind GandCrab, who recently released decryption keys for Syrian victims after a tweet\nclaimed they had no money to pay the ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Version 2.0.7_**\n\nThe most recent version examined comes with a different\nconfiguration scheme:\n\n_Configuration version of the Kraken Cryptor v. 2.0.7._\n\nThis release has more options. McAfee expects this malware will be\nmore configurable than other active versions.\n\n**_APIs and Statistics_**\n\nOne of the new features is a public API to track the number of\nvictims:\n\n_Public API to track the number of victims. Source: Bleeping Computer_\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother API is a hidden service to track certain statistics:\n\n_Statistics collection and monitoring site that likely does not have the functionality of a typical C2 panel._\n\nThe Onion URL can easily be found in the binary:\n\n_kraken656kn6wyyx[.]onion URL detected using the API._\n\nThe endpoint and browser that Kraken uses is hardcoded in the\nconfiguration file:\n\n_The configuration file contains data about the endpoint and browser._\n\nKraken gathers the following information from every infection:\n\n - Status\n\n - Operating System\n\n - Username\n\n - Hardware ID\n\n - IP Address\n\n - Country\n\n - City\n\n - Language\n\n - HDCount\n\n - HDType\n\n - HDName\n\n - HDFull\n\n - HDFree\n\n - Privilege\n\n - Operate\n\n - Beta\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Kraken Infrastructure_**\n\nIn versions 1.2 through 2.04, Kraken contacts blasze[.]tk to download\nadditional files. The site is has Cloudflare protection to mitigate\nDDoS attacks.\n\n_Kraken Cryptor used blasze[.]tk website to download additional files for versions 1.2 through 2.04._\n\nThis domain is not accessible from the following countries:\n\n_Countries that block the domain blasze[.]tk._\n\n\n-----\n\nInsikt Group was able to obtain a sample of the Kraken Cryptor\nransomware and successfully encrypt and then decrypt a 64-bit\nWindows 7 machine. The encryption phase locked all target files,\nand, in those directories, placed a ransom note in HTML format\nwith instructions for the victim. The note first instructs the victim to\nbuy Bitcoin through LocalBitcoins.com or BestBitcoinExchange.io,\nand then to contact the primary or secondary email address listed\nfor further instructions. Obviously, the infected machine still has\naccess to its web browsers, so the victim can communicate with the\nattacker and pay the ransom.\n\n_Partial screenshot of the ransom note left by Kraken._\n\nWhen the victim pays the ransom, they receive an email containing a\nlink for the file-sharing service Uploadfiles.io that in turn downloads\ntwo files, Decryptor.exe and Private.txt. Private.txt contains two\ndatasets: a private key and a private IV. When the program Decryptor.\nexe is executed, it requires the victim to copy and paste the private\nkey and private IV into the respective fields in order to decrypt the\nfiles on their machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screenshot of the Kraken decryptor sent to the victim after payment._\n\n### Outlook\n\nThe Kraken Cryptor ransomware is a 32-bit malware written using\n.NET Framework and protected with SmartAssembly, a commercial\nobfuscator that protects an application against reverse engineering.\nThe malware is fully customizable through a JavaScript Object\nNotation (JSON) file that is likely generated by its builder.\n\nThe existence of the list of countries that are not allowed to be\ntargeted indicates that the members of this possible international\nhacking group may reside in these nations. Such behavior is usually\nconsidered as a security step by the criminals who do not want\nto be searched by local law enforcement agencies. Considering\nthat ThisWasKraken is not a native English or Russian speaker, the\npossible residence of the actor may be Brazil or Iran.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix A: Key Indicators**\n\n - Jabber:\n\n  -
