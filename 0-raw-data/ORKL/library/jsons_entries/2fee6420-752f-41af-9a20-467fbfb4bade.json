The FAA is the US civil aviation and\ninternational waters regulator.\n\n## NASA and FAA don't deny breach\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the US government has not publicly disclosed that NASA and the FAA were breached,\nthe agencies' identities were confirmed by the Post with US officials after Anne Neuberger,\nWhite House’s deputy national security adviser, said that nine federal agencies were\nbreached in the SolarWinds hack campaign.\n\nA Transportation Department spokesperson said the agency is investigating the situation. A\nNASA spokeswoman added that the federal agency is working with CISA on \"mitigation\nefforts to secure NASA’s data and network.\"\n\nThese two federal agencies are the last two to be identified after the hacks of seven others\nhave already been acknowledged since the espionage campaign was uncovered.\n\nThe threat actor behind these attacks is currently tracked as StellarParticle (CrowdStrike),\nUNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Palo Alto Unit 42), and Dark Halo (Volexity).\n\nWhile its identity is still anonymous, the FBI, CISA, ODNI, and the NSA issued a joint\nstatement saying that it is [likely a Russian-backed hacking group.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-says-russian-state-hackers-likely-behind-solarwinds-hack/)\n\nMicrosoft shared a [detailed timeline of the attacks& showing that the state hackers trojanized](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-shares-how-solarwinds-hackers-evaded-detection/)\nthe company's Orion IT monitoring platform in February 2020 and later deployed a backdoor\nusing the software's update mechanism on compromised networks in late-March.\n\n## Compromised federal agencies\n\nThe list of the seven other US government agencies confirmed as having been hit in the\nSolarWinds supply-chain attack includes:\n\n[US& Department of the Treasury](https://www.reuters.com/article/BigStory12/idUSKBN28N0PG)\n[US& National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html)\n[US& Department of State](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-is-third-federal-agency-hacked-in-major-russian-cyberespionage-campaign/2020/12/14/41f8fc98-3e3c-11eb-8bc0-ae155bee4aff_story.html)\n[The National Institutes of Health (NIH) (part of the US Department of Health)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-is-third-federal-agency-hacked-in-major-russian-cyberespionage-campaign/2020/12/14/41f8fc98-3e3c-11eb-8bc0-ae155bee4aff_story.html)\n[US& Department of Homeland Security (DHS)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-is-third-federal-agency-hacked-in-major-russian-cyberespionage-campaign/2020/12/14/41f8fc98-3e3c-11eb-8bc0-ae155bee4aff_story.html)\n[US& Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/solarwinds-hackers-breach-us-nuclear-weapons-agency/)\n[US& National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/solarwinds-hackers-breach-us-nuclear-weapons-agency/)\n\nIn January, the Administrative Office of the US Courts disclosed an ongoing\ninvestigation following a potential compromise of the federal courts' case management and\nelectronic case files system.\n\nLast week, Microsoft also revealed that the SolarWinds hackers accessed and downloaded\nsource code for a limited number of Azure, Intune, and Exchange components.\n\nAccording to the Post's report, the Biden administration is also& planning to sanction Russia\nfor the SolarWinds hacks and poisoning& opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[FBI, CISA, and NSA warn of hackers increasingly targeting MSPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-cisa-and-nsa-warn-of-hackers-increasingly-targeting-msps/)\n\n[FTC fines Twitter $150M for using 2FA info for targeted advertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/ftc-fines-twitter-150m-for-using-2fa-info-for-targeted-advertising/)\n\n[Hacker says hijacking libraries, stealing AWS keys was ethical research](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-says-hijacking-libraries-stealing-aws-keys-was-ethical-research/)\n\n[Popular Python and PHP libraries hijacked to steal AWS keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-python-and-php-libraries-hijacked-to-steal-aws-keys/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n\n-----",
