ShadowPad was the\n\nprimary backdoor for espionage operations in multiple campaigns, including\n\nthe CCleaner, NetSarang, and ASUS supply-chain attacks.\n\n- The adoption of ShadowPad significantly reduces the costs of development and\n\nmaintenance for threat actors. We observed that some threat groups stopped\n\ndeveloping their own backdoors after they gained access to ShadowPad.\n\n- As a byproduct of that shared tooling, any claim on attribution needs\n\nto be reviewed in a cautious way when a shared backdoor like ShadowPad\n\nis involved.\n\n- Instead of focusing on specific threat groups, we discuss local personas\n\npossibly involved in the development of ShadowPad as an iterative\n\nsuccessor to PlugX.\n\n#### S e n t i n e l L a b s Te a m\n\n\n-----\n\n### OVERVIEW\n\nShadowPad emerged in 2015 as the successor to PlugX. However, it was not\n\n[until several infamous supply-chain incidents occurred – CCleaner, NetSarang](https://blog.avast.com/new-investigations-in-ccleaner-incident-point-to-a-possible-third-stage-that-had-keylogger-capacities)\n\nand [ShadowHammer – that it started to receive widespread attention in the](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/)\n\npublic domain. Unlike the publicly-sold PlugX, ShadowPad is privately shared\n\namong a limited set of users. Its plugin-based design and the capability of\n\ninserting plugins during runtime give it good extensibility on the functionalities\n\nfor its users. Whilst collecting IoCs and connecting the dots, we asked\n\nourselves: What threat actors are using ShadowPad in their operations? And\n\nultimately, how does the emergence of ShadowPad impact the wider threat\n\nlandscape from Chinese espionage actors?\n\nTo answer those questions, we conducted a comprehensive study on the origin,\n\nusage and ecosystem of ShadowPad. First, this report provides a detailed\n\noverview of ShadowPad, including the technical details and our assessment\n\nof its business model and ecosystem. Furthermore, in this whitepaper we\n\nintroduce at least four activity clusters where ShadowPad has been used.\n\nFinally, we share how its emergence changes the attacking strategies of some\n\nChina-based threat actors and how it affects the threat landscape of Chinese\n\nespionage attacks.\n\n### HISTORY\n\nPlugX is a fully-featured and modular backdoor in shellcode format, first\n\n\ndiscovered in 2008\n\n\n1. It was named by the security community based on its\n\n\nplugin-based design. Although it is formed of various plugins, it does not allow\n\nthe plugging and unplugging of those plugins during runtime. It was widely\n\nused by different threat groups after its emergence, and nowadays whilst still\n\ndeployed in some espionage campaigns, it sees significantly less usage due to\n\nthe popularity of the malware and therefore its detectability.\n\nThe relationship between PlugX and ShadowPad has been publicly discussed\n\n\nbefore\n\n\n2. However, SentinelOne discovered other evidence proving that\n\n\nShadowPad is highly likely to be the successor to PlugX. The project name of\n\na ShadowPad controller was “SC(1.1)” – embedded in the PDB string – while\n\na project name of the PlugX controller was “SController (SC)” by its developer.\n\n[1https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-so-new-campaign/ )\n\n[so-new-campaign/](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-so-new-campaign/ )\n\n[2https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/october/Study_of_the_ShadowPad_](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/october/Study_of_the_ShadowPad_APT_backdoor_and_its_relation_to_PlugX_en.pdf)\n\n[APT_backdoor_and_its_relation_to_PlugX_en.pdf](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/october/Study_of_the_ShadowPad_APT_backdoor_and_its_relation_to_PlugX_en.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - PlugX Controller: D:\\My2014\\SController(5.6)(天道)(匙)\\SC\\\n\n  - ShadowPad Controller: X:\\My2015\\SC(1.1)\\x64\\Release\\SoSvr.pdb\n\nA report by AT&T assessed that the developer of PlugX was likely to be a known hacker, nicknamed\n\n\n“whg” - aka “无花果”, based in China\n\n\n3. whg was an established programmer with a solid track\n\n\nrecord of developing backdoors and hacking tools, often selling “shared software” to others (as\n\nFig 1 shows). whg is based in the Sichuan province of China, sharing deep connections with the\n\nactors behind what was previously known as ‘Winnti’ and evolved partly into APT41, one of the\n\n\nactive ShadowPad users. Winnti was known to carry out several attacks with PlugX\n\nthis further below.\n\n\n4,5. We discuss\n\n\nFig 1: The introduction on wgh’s personal website. He stated that he had several years of\nexperience in software development, and he also sold some “shared software” on this website.\n\n### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\nShadowPad is a modular backdoor - each plugin contains specific functionality that can be ‘plugged’\n\nor ‘unplugged’ during runtime - in shellcode format. It also allows dynamic loading of additional\n\nplugins which are not initially embedded in the sample from the C&C server.\n\nIn this section, we discuss the emergence of ShadowPad, describe some technical details of the\n\nbackdoor, and give our assessment on how it is sold.\n\n[3https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/tracking-down-the-author-of-the-plugx-rat](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/tracking-down-the-author-of-the-plugx-rat)\n\n[4https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\n\n[5https://securelist.com/winnti-returns-with-plugx/66960/](https://securelist.com/winnti-returns-with-plugx/66960/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**M o d u l a r D e s i g n**\n\nShadowPad is a modular backdoor in shellcode format. On execution, a layer of an obfuscated shellcode\n\nloader is responsible for decrypting and loading a Root plugin. While the sequence of operation in the\n\nRoot plugin decrypts, it loads other plugins embedded in the shellcode into memory. The plugins are\n\nkept and referenced through a linked list:\n\n_struct plugin_node {_\n\n_plugin_node* previous_node;_\n\n_plugin_node* next_node;_\n\n_DWORD referenced_count;_\n\n_DWORD plugin_timestamp;_\n\n_DWORD plugin_id;_\n\n_DWORD field_0;_\n\n_DWORD field_1;_\n\n_DWORD field_2;_\n\n_DWORD field_3;_\n\n_DWORD plugin_size;_\n\n_LPVOID plugin_base_addr;_\n\n_LPVOID plugin_export_function_table_addr;_\n\n_}_\n\nAlong with the plugins embedded in the sample, additional plugins are allowed to be remotely\n\nuploaded from the C&C server, which allows users to dynamically add functionalities not included\n\nby default. The uploaded plugins will be kept in memory and added to the linked list of the plugin\n\nnodes, as shown in Fig 2.\n\nFig 2: The architecture of ShadowPad backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nSentinelOne has collected 22 unique plugins from SentinelOne’s internal sample set. These are\n\nlisted fully in Appendix A.\n\n**C o n t r o l l e r**\n\nAs luck would have it, the ShadowPad controller (version 1.0, 2015) was accidentally discovered\n\nduring private research. All of the stakeholders involved agreed to our releasing screenshots\n\nbut not the details of the actual file, so we are unable to provide hashes for this component\n\nat present. Analysis of the controller allowed us to obtain a clear picture of how the builder\n\ngenerates the shellcodes, how the users manage the infected hosts, and the kinds of functions\n\navailable on the controller.\n\nWritten in Delphi, it has the capability to both generate malware and control backdoor\n\ncommunications. The controller provides an interface to manage infected hosts, manage C&C\n\nserver listeners and build new ShadowPad shellcode pieces (as shown in Fig 3). This is a relatively\n\nunique characteristic of malware used by Chinese espionage threat actors.\n\nFig 3: The main page of the controller\n\n   - **Users: The list of infected hosts.**\n\n   - **Transfer: The transferring progress of files which are currently being transferred from and**\n\nto the infected hosts.\n\n   - **Listen: To control the C&C listeners and the protocols in use.**\n\n   - **Setting: Intended to be a setting panel, but there is no option on the list in this version.**\n\n   - **Builder: The ShadowPad shellcode builder.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe user can choose to enter the management console of a single infected computer (shown in\n\nFig 4). The console allows the user to manage the plugin list and use the functions of each plugin.\n\nThe plugins “Root” to “Http” are embedded in the samples by default. If the user wants to use the\n\nfunctions of other plugins, those plugins need to be uploaded to the infected computer (in Fig 5).\n\nFig 4: The plugin management page. The user can add or remove a plugin.\n\nFig 5: The popup message of asking the user to upload a plugin\n\n\n-----\n\nThe builder (in Fig 6) allows the user to modify the campaign code and notes, anti-debugger\n\nsettings, installation settings (service and register), process injection settings, C&C servers and\n\nconnection modes. It also contains configuration import and export functionalities.\n\nFig 6: The builder in ShadowPad controller\n\n\n-----\n\n### PRIVATELY SHARED ATTACK FRAMEWORK OR PRIVATELY\n SOLD MODULAR MALWARE?\n\nAn intriguing question to address is whether ShadowPad is a privately shared attack framework\n\n\nor a privately developed modular malware platform for sale to specific groups. Its design allows\n\nthe users to remotely deploy new plugins to a backdoor. In theory, anyone capable of producing a\n\nplugin that is encrypted and compressed in the correct format can add new functionalities to the\n\nbackdoor freely. However, the control interfaces of the plugins are hardcoded in the “Manager”\n\npage of the ShadowPad controller (in Fig 7), and the controller itself does not include a feature\n\nto add a new control interface. In other words, it is unlikely that ShadowPad was created as a\n\ncollaborative attacking framework. Only the plugins produced by the original developer could be\n\nincluded and used through the ShadowPad controller.\n\nFig 7: The interfaces to control the plugins are hardcoded and listed in the “Manager” page.\n\nThe users can interact with the plugins only through the listed interface\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, even if the control interface of a plugin is listed in\n\nthe menu, not every available plugin is embedded in the ShadowPad\n\nsamples built by the controller by default. Once a plugin is not included\n\nin the compiled sample, the user needs to upload the corresponding\n\nplugin (encrypted and compressed in the correct format) and place\n\nit in the “Plugins” directory in the package during runtime on the\n\nclient side. There is no configuration in the builder to allow the user\n\nto choose which plugins are compiled into the generated sample, so\n\nthis setting can only be managed by the developer of the controller.\n\nAny functionality can be easily removed from the bundle by removing\n\nthe corresponding plugin from the directory.\n\nIf ShadowPad was not originally designed as an open framework,\n\nthe following question is whether it is freely shared with or sold to\n\nits users. The possible author ‘whg’ – and one of his close affiliates,\n\nRose, who will be introduced in the following section – have been\n\nmonetizing their malware development and hacking skills since the\n\nearly 2000s. Both individuals sold self-developed malware, and Rose\n\noffered services such as software cracking, penetration testing and\n\n\nDDoS attacks\n\n\n6. If ShadowPad was developed by them or their close\n\n\naffiliates, it is more likely to be sold to – rather than freely shared\n\nwith – other users under this context.\n\n**S e l l i n g t h e P l u g i n s S e p a r a t e l y R a t h e r**\n**t h a n G i v i n g a F u l l B u n d l e b y D e f a u l t**\n\nAs discussed, the available functionalities to ShadowPad users\n\nare highly controlled by the seller of ShadowPad. Looking deeply\n\ninto the plugin numbers and the distribution of different plugins\n\nembedded in around a hundred samples, we assessed that the\n\nseller is likely selling each plugin separately instead of offering\n\na full bundle with all of the currently available plugins. In other\n\nwords, a buyer needs to pick how many plugins they need and\n\nacquire them from the seller. The seller does not provide all the\n\nfunctionality or capabilities by default.\n\n[6https://web.archive.org/web/20090925075518/http:/www.hackbase.com:80/](https://web.archive.org/web/20090925075518/http:/www.hackbase.com:80/news/2009-04-09/24948.html)\n\n[news/2009-04-09/24948.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20090925075518/http:/www.hackbase.com:80/news/2009-04-09/24948.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n60\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19||\n\n\nThe number of plugins embedded in the samples\n\n\nFig 8: The number of samples grouped by the number of plugins in each sample\n\nFig 8 groups the samples by the number of the plugins embedded in them. As the figure shows,\n\nmost of the samples contain less than nine plugins with the following plugins embedded: Root,\n\nPlugins, Config, Install, Online, TCP, HTTP, UDP and DNS. This set of plugins can only support\n\nthe installation of backdoors and communications with C&C servers, without providing further\n\nfunctionality. Actors owning samples with more than 16 plugins, which are all packed by the same\n\nloader and are likely to be used by a single closed group, are likely to be offered as ‘fully packaged’\n\nversions of ShadowPad with the specially configured builders that can build samples with a full set\n\nof plugins. In other cases, the actors can only compile ShadowPad backdoors with the basic set\n\n\nof plugins. They need to manually upload other plugins if they want to use other functionalities.\n\nDuring our research, we found Tick - one of the threat groups with access to ShadowPad - developed\n\na tool to extract the list of installed software information on an infected host while a plugin of\n\nShadowPad with the same functionality – the plugin “Software” – was discovered in a sample used\n\nby another threat group in a similar time frame. This shows that not every customer of ShadowPad\n\ndecides to (or is able to) obtain all of the available plugins. We assess that the plugins are likely\n\n\nto be provided separately.\n\n\n-----\n\n### WHAT THREAT ACTORS ARE USING SHADOWPAD?\n\nDespite being the potential successor to PlugX, ShadowPad is sold\n\nprivately to a limited set of customers. SentinelOne has identified at\n\nleast 5 activity clusters of ShadowPad users since 2017.\n\n**A P T 4 1**\n\nAPT41 is the accepted naming convention for the activities conducted\n\nby two spinoffs of what was once referred to as ‘Winnti’, sub-groups –\n\nBARIUM (Tan Dailin aka Rose and Zhang Haoran) and LEAD (Chengdu\n\n\n404 Network Technology Co., Ltd)\n\n\n7. All of the individuals are based\n\n\nin Chengdu, Sichuan. Rose, Zhang Haoran, and Jiang Lizhi (AKA\n\n“BlackFox”, one of the responsible persons of Chengdu 404) were\n\ncoworkers between 2011 and 2017, while Rose and BlackFox already\n\n\nknew each other since at least 2006\n\n\n8.\n\n\nOne of the actors, Rose - AKA “凋凌玫瑰” - started his active collaboration\n\non malware development with whg, the author of PlugX, when he was\n\n\na member of the hacking group NCPH back in 2005\n\n\n9. They developed\n\n\n“NCPH Remote Control Software” (as shown in Fig 9) together until\n\n2007. The executable of the controller was freely shared on NCPH\n\n\nwebsites\n\n\n10,11, but they also declared that the source code was for sale\n\n\n(see Fig 10). Aside from this, NCPH offered customized services of\n\n\nsoftware cracking, malware development and penetration testing\n\n\n12.\n\n\nBoth Rose and whg were monetizing their malware development skills\n\nback in the day.\n\n[7https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n\n[apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n\n[8https://web.archive.org/web/20060906223841/http:/www.mghacker.com:80/](https://web.archive.org/web/20060906223841/http:/www.mghacker.com:80/blogview.asp?logID=127)\n\n[blogview.asp?logID=127](https://web.archive.org/web/20060906223841/http:/www.mghacker.com:80/blogview.asp?logID=127)\n\n[9https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/WickedRose_andNCPH.pdf](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/WickedRose_andNCPH.pdf)\n\n[10https://web.archive.org/web/20070519130046if_/http://www.ncph.net/newncph/](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519130046if_/http://www.ncph.net/newncph/news_view.asp?newsid=96)\n\n[news_view.asp?newsid=96](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519130046if_/http://www.ncph.net/newncph/news_view.asp?newsid=96)\n\n[11https://www.51wendang.com/doc/02e6c3141d94fc4bd07015c0](https://www.51wendang.com/doc/02e6c3141d94fc4bd07015c0)\n\n[12https://web.archive.org/web/20060614163159/http://www.ncph.net/yewul.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614163159/http://www.ncph.net/yewul.htm)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 9: NCPH 5.0 Remote Control Software, developed back in 2005, was powered by whg and Rose.\n\nFig 10: Rose and his friends sold the source code of “NCPH remote control software” on NCPH forum.\n\n\n-----\n\nBARIUM (Rose and Zhang Haoran) were one of the earliest threat\n\ngroups with access to ShadowPad. Aside from some smaller-scale\n\n\nattacks against the gaming industry\n\n\n13, they were accountable for\n\n\nseveral supply chain attacks from 2017 to 2018, some of their\n\n\n15, and allegedly, CCleaner\n\n\n16,17.\n\n\nvictims included NetSarang\n\n\n14, ASUS\n\n\nIn the aforementioned incidents, the actors used ShadowPad as\n\nthe primary backdoor of the intrusion after the initial infection\n\nphases. During the supply chain attack against ASUS, the samples of\n\nShadowPad were highly customized compared to other ShadowPad\n\nsamples SentinelOne analyzed. Every layer of shellcode and\n\nplugin was packed with VMProtect, and the plugins had different\n\nplugin numbers. Another subgroup, LEAD, also used ShadowPad\n\nalong with other backdoors to attack victims for both financial\n\nand espionage purposes. They were reported to attack electronic\n\nproviders and consumers, universities, telecommunication, NGO\n\nand foreign governments.\n\nConsidering the long-term affiliation relationship between Rose and\n\nwhg, we suspect that Rose likely had high privilege access to – or\n\nwas a co-developer of – ShadowPad, and other close affiliates in\n\nChengdu were likely sharing resources. This could also explain why\n\nBARIUM was able to utilize a special version of ShadowPad in some\n\nof their attacks.\n\n### TICK AND TONTO TEAM\n\nTick and Tonto Team (referred to as Tick in the following report)\n\nhave been active users of ShadowPad since 2018. These two groups\n\namalgamated into a new institution during the reorganization of the\n\nPLA, and soon thereafter SentinelOne identified significant resource\n\nsharing between them, such as the overlaps of C&C infrastructure\n\nand the utilities of similar toolsets. A noticeable change after the\n\nmerge was that they started to use ShadowPad as their primary\n\nbackdoor for conducting intrusion activities. In the past, they were\n\nknown to develop their own backdoors for their operations.\n\n[13https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\n\n[14https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\n\n[15https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/)\n\n[attack/90380/](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/)\n\n[16https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\n\n[17https://blog.avast.com/new-investigations-in-ccleaner-incident-point-to-a-possible-](https://blog.avast.com/new-investigations-in-ccleaner-incident-point-to-a-possible-third-stage-that-had-keylogger-capacities)\n\n[third-stage-that-had-keylogger-capacities](https://blog.avast.com/new-investigations-in-ccleaner-incident-point-to-a-possible-third-stage-that-had-keylogger-capacities)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat group conducted several operations with ShadowPad as the primary backdoor from\n\n2018 onwards. Internally, they called ShadowPad “Casper”, according to the PDB strings extracted\n\nfrom the customized loaders. Throughout 2019, Tick crafted and sent spear phishing emails to\n\n\ndeliver ShadowPad in victims’ networks for information exfiltration and long-term espionage\n\n\n18. In\n\n\n20 in Trend Micro’s security solutions\n\n\n2020, they exploited CVE-2019-9489\n\n\n19 and CVE-2020-8468\n\n\nthat were exposed to the Internet, in order to deliver ShadowPad into internal networks for further\n\n\nexploitation\n\n\n21. Based on the sample sets we collected, Tick used at least five different versions of\n\n\nShadowPad; however, all of the samples only contained the basic set of plugins.\n\nAlthough they turned from self-developed backdoors to the acquired or leaked backdoors, they\n\nstill developed some customized tools for intrusion, such as a modified mimikatz, a screen capture\n\ntool, a packet transmission tool, a tool to list the software installed on a computer, and a VBScript\n\ncommand execution tool. For instance, SentinelOne uncovered a VBScript command execution\n\ntool builder (as Fig 11 shows) which can generate a payload of VBScript with built-in evasion\n\ntechniques to bypass TrendMicro products. The self-developed tool to list the software strongly\n\nsuggests that Tick was unable to obtain all of the available plugins, since a plugin with the same\n\nfunctionality was available at that time.\n\nFig 11: The builder of evasive VBScript developed by Tick.

All the\n\nsamples we collected from Operation Redbonus were running the same version of ShadowPad.\n\n\nDuring our investigations, we also spotted other backdoors in use, such as Whitebird\n\n\n22, IceFog and\n\n\na customized instance of PCShare. The actors behind this cluster appear to show interest in Indian\n\ntargets with several DDNS domains spoofing some Indian institutions.\n\nFig 12: The artifacts of Operation Redbonus\n\n[22https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/july/Study_of_the_APT_attacks_on_state_institutions_in_](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/july/Study_of_the_APT_attacks_on_state_institutions_in_Kazakhstan_and_Kyrgyzstan_en.pdf)\n\n[Kazakhstan_and_Kyrgyzstan_en.pdf](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/july/Study_of_the_APT_attacks_on_state_institutions_in_Kazakhstan_and_Kyrgyzstan_en.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n### OPERATION REDKANKU\n\nThere is another small set of ShadowPad samples without clear attributions in the public\n\ndomain. All of the C&C servers extracted from the samples had a self-signed certificate\n\nb41948daacd4c081a58a14aa51c37af21738447b installed. Whilst further attribution or overlaps\n\nare not available at the time of writing, some related samples were documented to be a part of the\n\n\nProxyLogon attacks according to a report by ESET\n\n\n23.\n\n\nFig 13: The artifacts of Operation Redkanku\n\n[23https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### FISHMONGER\n\nAnother activity cluster – tracked by SentinelOne as Fishmonger – has\n\nbeen active since at least 2018. The cluster is tracked based on the\n\noverlap of infrastructure and indicators, as well as some behavioral\n\nconnections between different campaigns.\n\nBack in 2019, the actors used a special version of ShadowPad which\n\nallowed them to generate samples with a handful of plugins embedded\n\n\nby default\n\n\n24. In 2020, they gained access to a new version of ShadowPad\n\n\nwhich had updates and more advanced obfuscation techniques. They\n\n\nare now using it and another backdoor called Spyder\n\n\n25 as their primary\n\n\nbackdoors for long-term monitoring\n\n\n26, while they distribute other\n\n\nfirst-stage backdoors for initial infections including FunnySwitch,\n\n\nBIOPASS RAT\n\n\n27, and Cobalt Strike. The victims include universities,\n\n\ngovernments, media sector companies, technology companies and\n\nhealth organizations conducting COVID-19 research in Hong Kong,\n\nTaiwan, India and the US.\n\n[24https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\n\n[hong-kong/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\n\n[25https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2021/march/BackDoor.Spyder.1_en.pdf](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2021/march/BackDoor.Spyder.1_en.pdf)\n\n[26https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf)\n\n[winnti-group.pdf](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf)\n\n[27https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/biopass-rat-new-malware-sniffs-](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/biopass-rat-new-malware-sniffs-victims-via-live-streaming.html)\n\n[victims-via-live-streaming.html](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/biopass-rat-new-malware-sniffs-victims-via-live-streaming.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 14: Part of the artifacts of Fishmonger\n\n### OTHERS\n\nSome public reporting detail other possible users of ShadowPad, including LuckyMouse (ESET)\n\n\n28\n\n\nand Tropic Trooper (PwC)\n\n\n29. However, SentinelOne does not have visibility of this activity.\n\n\n[28https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\n\n[29https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwyc6SctYs&t=1347s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwyc6SctYs&t=1347s)\n\n\n-----\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n\nApart from the threat groups and activity clusters detailed above, there are still some unattributed\n\nShadowPad samples in the sample set SentinelOne collected and analyzed. The nature of privately\n\nsold backdoors requires more context to begin analytically-sound attribution. There might be other\n\nunidentified actors using this backdoor, and it requires a rigorous approach when attempting to\n\nattribute ShadowPad campaigns.\n\nSince ShadowPad is a powerful backdoor with a complete set of functionalities, a number of\n\nits users (for instance, Tick and Fishmonger) deploy ShadowPad for the purpose of long-term\n\nespionage in victim environments. Threat actors using ShadowPad select systems with high\n\nprivileges on networks to reduce the probability of detection, such as AD servers or domain\n\ncontrollers. Proactive scanning and periodical health checks on high-privilege hosts are essential\n\nto discover the footprints of attackers.\n\n### LANDSCAPE SHIFT: FROM DEVELOPING BACKDOORS\n TO ACQUIRING BACKDOORS\n\nIt is not a secret that a number of Chinese threat actors develop their own tool sets based on their\n\nneeds during operations. However, established espionage threat actors also acquire tooling to add\n\nto their arsenals. Tick was one of the most active users of ShadowPad according to research. Prior\n\nto this, Tick was documented to be using self-developed backdoors including Darsef, xxmm and\n\n\nDatper\n\n\n30. A noticeable change SentinelOne discovered during the monitoring of the threat group\n\n\nwas that the actors later stopped the use of other self-developed backdoors after actively using\n\nShadowPad (which they called Casper).\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nDaserf\n(VS)\n\nDaserf\n(Delphi)\n\nxxmm\n\nDatper\n\nSHADOWPAD\n(Casper)\n\n[Fig 15: Timeline of backdoor used by Tick (picture)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1XzF-KbQie83h2p3JW6cq-Z9lCUvvXFQ6/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p1)\n\n[30https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-butler-targets-japanese-businesses](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-butler-targets-japanese-businesses)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis example of the shift from ‘home-brewed’ backdoors to acquired malware marks a noticeable\n\nchange influenced by the privately sold malware platform ShadowPad. Acquiring a well-designed\n\npiece of malware significantly reduces the cost of operation and human resource needed to develop\n\nthe malware in-house. The service provider also keeps enhancing the stability and usability of the\n\nbackdoor with new features added, unlike much of the commodity malware found in cybercriminal\n\ncircles or underground forums. Furthermore, the usage of shared malware provides espionage\n\nthreat actors a layer of security in that it makes attribution much more difficult for defenders. The\n\npopularity of malware such as ShadowPad and Cobalt Strike among Chinese espionage groups\n\nmakes campaign identification significantly harder.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nThe emergence of ShadowPad, a privately sold, well-developed and functional backdoor, offers\n\nthreat actors a good opportunity to move away from self-developed backdoors. While it is well\ndesigned – highly likely to be produced by an experienced malware developer – it is also under\n\nactive maintenance on both its functionalities and its anti-forensics capabilities. For these threat\n\nactors, using ShadowPad as the primary backdoor significantly reduces the costs of development.\n\nThey do not need to spend time developing new functionalities, adding new obfuscations to their\n\nsamples or conducting testing on their backdoors before deployment. Besides, the nature of the\n\n“sold backdoor” reduces the chances of the actors being identified solely by the tool, allowing the\n\nactors to remain hidden and unidentified for longer.\n\nFor security researchers and analysts tracking China-based threat actors, the adoption of the “sold\n\n- or cracked - commercial backdoor” raises difficulties in ascertaining which threat actor they are\n\ninvestigating. More systematic ways – for instance, analysis on the relationship between indicators,\n\nlong-term monitoring on the activities and campaigns – need to be developed in order to carry out\n\nanalytically-sound attribution. Any claim made publicly on the attribution of ShadowPad users\n\nrequires careful validation and strong evidentiary support so that it can help the community’s\n\neffort in identifying Chinese espionage.\n\n\n-----\n\n### TECHNICAL INDICATORS\n\nFor a full list of hashes, C2 domains, and MITRE ATT&CK Indicators, see:\n\n[https://github.com/SentineLabs/Shadowpad](https://github.com/SentineLabs/Shadowpad )\n\n### APPENDIX A\n\n**P l u g i n s**\n\nSentinelOne has collected 22 unique plugins from SentinelOne’s internal sample set.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**C o n f i g u r a t i o n**\n\nThe “Config” plugin decodes the configuration block and decrypts the encrypted strings\n\nembedded in the configuration block.\n\n**Offset** **Data Type** **Column**\n\n0x00 WORD offset_product_key\n\n0x02 WORD offset_note\n\n0x04 WORD offset_binary_path\n\n0x06 WORD offset_service_name\n\n0x08 WORD offset_service_display_name\n\n0x0A WORD offset_service_description\n\n0x0C WORD offset_registry_key\n\n0x0E WORD offset_registry_value\n\n0x10 - 0x17 WORD offset_process_spawn_and_inject 1-4\n\n0x18 - 0x37 WORD offset_c2 1-16\n\n0x38 - 0x3F WORD offset_proxy_type 1-4\n\n0x40 - 0x4F DWORD DNS 1-4\n\n0x50 DWORD timeout_multiplier\n\nThe constants of the string decryption algorithms and the starting offset of the encrypted string\n\ntable differ between versions.\n\n\n-----\n\n## ABOUT SENTINELLABS\n\nInfoSec works on a rapid iterative cycle where new discoveries occur daily and authoritative sources are\neasily drowned in the noise of partial information.
