This modification allows Neuron to evade detection during disk scans performed by antivirus software, although the NCSC say it's\n\"likely\" that AV suites which scan memory will still uncover the payload.\n\n**See also:** **[The secret to being a great spy agency in the 21st century: Incubating startups](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-secret-to-being-a-great-spy-agency-in-the-21st-century-incubating-startups/)**\n\nThe authors of Neuron have also altered the encryption of the new version, now configuring multiple hardcoded keys rather than just using\none. Like many of the other changes, it's most likely these have been implemented to make detection and decryption by network defenders\nmore difficult.\n\nThe Turla group moves quickly: the compile times contained within the code show that the new version of the malware was compiled just five\ndays after previous warnings about Neuron were made public in November.\n\n\n-----\n\nd ce by t e CSC o o ga sat o s t at a e p e ous y bee ta geted by u a s to be d ge t c ec g o t e p ese ce o t ese\nadditional tools\".\n\n**Download now:** **[Intrusion detection policy (free PDF)](http://www.techproresearch.com/downloads/intrusion-detection-policy/)**\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre doesn't point to the work of Turla being associated with any particular threat actor -- instead referring to it\nas \"a prevalent cyber threat group targeting the UK\".\n\n[However, cybersecurity researchers have previously argued that Turla is a state-sponsored operation which works to further the aims of the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-hacking-campaign-targets-g20-attendees-with-booby-trapped-invites/)\nRussian government.\n\n### Recent and related coverage\n\n**[Tracking Turla: Hackers abuse satellite signals high in the sky](https://www.zdnet.com/article/tracking-turla-hackers-abuse-satellite-signals-high-in-the-sky/)**\n\nA sophisticated hacking group is using satellites in a novel manner to disguise their tracks.\n\n**[Stealthy malware targets embassies in snooping campaign](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-stealthy-malware-targets-embassies-in-snooping-campaign/)**\n\nThe Turla hacking group is using the new Gazer backdoor to conduct espionage, according to researchers at ESET.\n\n**[Russian hacking campaign targets G20 attendees with booby-trapped invites](https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-hacking-campaign-targets-g20-attendees-with-booby-trapped-invites/)**\n\nTurla APT group is sending out invites to a real G20 event in Hamburg, targeting politicians, policy makers and other experts for the\npurposes of espionage.\n\n### READ MORE ON CYBERCRIME\n\n\n-----",
