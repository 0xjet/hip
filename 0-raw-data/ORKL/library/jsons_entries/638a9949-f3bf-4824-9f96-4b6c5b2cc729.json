    "plain_text": "# Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845**\n\nDecember 5, 2019\n\n**Washington – Today the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control**\n(OFAC) took action against Evil Corp, the Russia-based cybercriminal organization\nresponsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used\nthe Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks\nand financial institutions in over 40 countries, causing more than $100 million in theft. This\nmalicious software has caused millions of dollars of damage to U.S. and international\nfinancial institutions and their customers. Concurrent with OFAC’s action, the Department of\nJustice charged two of Evil Corp’s members with criminal violations, and the Department of\nState announced a reward for information up to $5 million leading to the capture or\nconviction of Evil Corp’s leader. These U.S. actions were carried out in close coordination\nwith the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA). Additionally, based on information\nobtained by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),\nthe Treasury Department’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection\n(OCCIP) released previously unreported indicators of compromise associated with the\nDridex malware and its use against the financial services sector.\n\n“Treasury is sanctioning Evil Corp as part of a sweeping action against one of the world’s\nmost prolific cybercriminal organizations. This coordinated action is intended to disrupt the\nmassive phishing campaigns orchestrated by this Russian-based hacker group,” said Steven\n\n\n-----\n\nT. Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury. OFAC s action is part of a multiyear effort with key\nNATO allies, including the United Kingdom. Our goal is to shut down Evil Corp, deter the\ndistribution of Dridex, target the “money mule” network used to transfer stolen funds, and\nultimately to protect our citizens from the group’s criminal activities.”\n\nWorldwide, cybercrime results in losses that total in the billions of dollars, while in the United\nStates, financial institutions and other businesses remain prime targets for cybercriminals.\nToday’s action clarifies that, in addition to his involvement in financially motivated cybercrime,\nthe group’s leader, Maksim Yakubets, also provides direct assistance to the Russian\ngovernment’s malicious cyber efforts, highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of\ncybercriminals for its own malicious purposes. Maksim Yakubets is not the first cybercriminal\nto be tied to the Russian government. In 2017, the Department of Justice indicted two\nRussian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers and their criminal conspirators for\ncompromising millions of Yahoo email accounts. The United States Government will not\ntolerate this type of activity by another government or its proxies and will continue to hold all\nresponsible parties accountable.\n\nToday’s designations and indictments were issued in furtherance of previous international\nactions targeting Evil Corp in an effort to further disrupt and degrade the group’s ability to\noperate. In October 2015, the Department of Justice indicted Andrey Ghinkul for spreading\nthe Dridex malware. At that same time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NCA\ndisrupted the global infrastructure utilized at the time by Evil Corp. Over the past several\nyears, the NCA and the United Kingdom’s Metropolitan Police Service have arrested multiple\nindividuals who enabled the activities of Evil Corp, including laundering stolen proceeds\nacquired through the Dridex malware.\n\nAs a result of today’s designations, all property and interests in property of these persons\nsubject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from\nengaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or more owned by\none or more designated persons are also blocked. Foreign persons may be subject to\nsecondary sanctions for knowingly facilitating a significant transaction or transactions with\nthese designated persons.\n\n## Designation Targets\n\nToday’s action targets 17 individuals and seven entities to include Evil Corp, its core cyber\noperators, multiple businesses associated with a group member, and financial facilitators\nutilized by the group. OFAC designated these persons pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.)\n13694, as amended, which targets malicious cyber-enabled actors around the world, and as\ncodified by the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.\n\nDRIDEX infection chain photo\n\n\n-----\n\n**Evil Corp is the Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development**\nand distribution of the Dridex malware. The Dridex malware is a multifunctional malware\npackage that is designed to automate the theft of confidential information, to include online\nbanking credentials from infected computers. Dridex is traditionally spread through massive\nphishing email campaigns that seek to entice victims to click on malicious links or\nattachments embedded within the emails. Once a system is infected, Evil Corp uses\ncompromised credentials to fraudulently transfer funds from victims’ bank accounts to those\nof accounts controlled by the group. As of 2016, Evil Corp had harvested banking\ncredentials from customers at approximately 300 banks and financial institutions in over 40\ncountries, making the group one of the main financial threats faced by businesses. In\nparticular, Evil Corp heavily targets financial services sector organizations located in the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom. Through their use of the Dridex malware, Evil Corp\nhas illicitly earned at least $100 million, though it is likely that the total of their illicit proceeds\nis significantly higher. As a result of this activity, Evil Corp is being designated pursuant to\nE.O. 13694, as amended, for engaging in cyber-enabled activities that have the effect of\ncausing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources for private financial\ngain.\n\nEvil Corp operates as a business run by a group of individuals based in Moscow, Russia,\nwho have years of experience and well-developed, trusted relationships with each other.\n**Maksim Yakubets (Yakubets) serves as Evil Corp’s leader and is responsible for managing**\nand supervising the group’s malicious cyber activities. For example, as of 2017, Yakubets\nsupervised Evil Corp actors who were attempting to target U.S. companies. As of 2015,\nYakubets maintained control of the Dridex malware and was in direct communication with\nAndrey Ghinkul prior to the unsealing of his indictment. As a result, Yakubets is being\ndesignated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having acted for or on behalf of and for\nproviding material assistance to Evil Corp. Prior to serving in this leadership role for Evil\nCorp, Yakubets was also directly associated with Evgeniy Bogachev, a previously designated\nRussian cybercriminal responsible for the distribution of the Zeus, Jabber Zeus, and\nGameOver Zeus malware schemes. In particular, Yakubets was responsible for recruiting\nand managing a network of individuals responsible for facilitating the movement of money\nillicitly gained through the efforts spearheaded by Evgeniy Bogachev. Yakubets is the\nsubject of an indictment and criminal complaint unsealed today by the Department of Justice,\nwhile the Department of State announced a $5 million reward for information leading to the\ncapture of Yakubets.\n\nIn addition to his leadership role within Evil Corp, Yakubets has also provided direct\nassistance to the Russian government. As of 2017, Yakubets was working for the Russian\nFSB, one of Russia’s leading intelligence organizations that was previously sanctioned\npursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, on December 28, 2016.  As of April 2018, Yakubets\nwas in the process of obtaining a license to work with Russian classified information from the\nFSB. As a result, Yakubets is also being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended,\n\n\n-----\n\nfor providing material assistance to the FSB. Additionally, as of 2017, Yakubets was tasked\nto work on projects for the Russian state, to include acquiring confidential documents\nthrough cyber-enabled means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf.\n\nAnother key Evil Corp figure targeted today is Igor Turashev (Turashev). As of 2017,\nTurashev was involved in helping Evil Corp exploit victims’ networks. As of 2015, Turashev\nserved as an administrator for Yakubets and had control over the Dridex malware. As a\nresult, Turashev is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having acted\nfor or on behalf of and for providing material assistance to Evil Corp. Turashev is also the\nsubject of an indictment unsealed today by the Department of Justice.\n\n**Denis Gusev (Gusev), a senior member of Evil Corp, is also being designated today for his**\nactive role in furthering Evil Corp’s activities. As of 2017, Gusev was involved in helping Evil\nCorp move to a new office location and as of 2018, Gusev served as a financial facilitator for\nEvil Corp and its members. As a result, Gusev is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694,\nas amended, for having acted for or on behalf of and for providing material assistance to Evil\nCorp.\n\nGusev also serves as the General Director for six Russia-based businesses. These entities\ninclude Biznes-Stolitsa, OOO, Optima, OOO, Treid-Invest, OOO, TSAO, OOO, Vertikal,\n**OOO, and Yunikom, OOO. As a result, these entities are being designated pursuant to E.O.**\n13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled by Gusev.\n\nIn addition to Yakubets, Turashev, and Gusev, Evil Corp relies upon a cadre of core\nindividuals to carry out critical logistical, technical, and financial functions such as managing\nthe Dridex malware, supervising the operators seeking to target new victims, and laundering\nthe proceeds derived from the group’s activities. These additional core members of the\ngroup include Dmitriy Smirnov, Artem Yakubets, Ivan Tuchkov, Andrey Plotnitskiy,\n**Dmitriy Slobodskoy, and Kirill Slobodskoy. As a result, these six individuals are being**\ndesignated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having acted for or on behalf of and for\nproviding material assistance to Evil Corp.\n\nTo transfer the proceeds gained through their use of the Dridex malware, Evil Corp relies\nupon a network of money mules who are involved in transferring stolen funds obtained from\nvictims’ bank accounts to accounts controlled by members of Evil Corp. Previously, the NCA\narrested multiple individuals in the United Kingdom suspected of laundering the criminal\nprofits of cybercrime schemes, including those perpetrated by Evil Corp, through hundreds of\naccounts at various banks in the United Kingdom. Today, OFAC is designating eight\nMoscow-based individuals who have served as financial facilitators for Evil Corp. These\nindividuals include Aleksei Bashlikov, Ruslan Zamulko, David Guberman, Carlos\n**Alvares, Georgios Manidis, Tatiana Shevchuk, Azamat Safarov, and Gulsara**\n**Burkhonova. As a result, these eight individuals are being designated pursuant to E.O.**\n13694, as amended, for providing financial and material assistance to Evil Corp.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The Treasury Department s FinCEN and OCCIP announcement can be found here.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa19-339a)\n\n####\n\nUse featured image\n\nOff\n\n\n-----",
