These emails were\ndesigned to trick recipients into supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake\nwebmail domain. The attack group then used these stolen credentials to gain access to the\nDNC network, install malware, move across the network, and steal data, including a trove of\nemails. The compromised information was later leaked online.\n\nThese election attacks signaled a change of tactics on the part of APT28, moving away from\ntheir prior low-key intelligence gathering towards more overt activity, seemingly intended to\ndestabilize and disrupt victim organizations and countries.\n\nThe group was also responsible for the 2016 attack on the World Anti Doping Agency\n(WADA) and the leaking of confidential drug testing information. In keeping with its shift to\nmore overt tactics, the group appeared to publicly take credit for the attack, leaking the\ninformation on a website using the name “Fancy Bears”, an industry codename that was\nalready widely used for the group.\n\n## Return to the shadows\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter receiving an unprecedented amount of attention in 2016, APT28 has continued to\nmount operations during 2017 and 2018. However, the group’s activities since the beginning\nof 2017 have again become more covert and appear to be mainly motivated by intelligence\ngathering.\n\nThe organizations targeted by APT28 during 2017 and 2018 include:\n\nA well-known international organization\nMilitary targets in Europe\nGovernments in Europe\nA government of a South American country\nAn embassy belonging to an Eastern European country\n\n\n-----\n\n## Ongoing development of tools\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT28 uses a number of tools to compromise its targets. The group s primary malware is\n[Sofacy, which has two main components. Trojan.Sofacy (also known as Seduploader)](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2014-110315-1233-99)\nperforms basic reconnaissance on an infected computer and can download further malware.\n[Backdoor.SofacyX (also known as X-Agent) is a second stage piece of malware, capable of](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-092116-1134-99)\nstealing information from the infected computer. A Mac version of the Trojan also exists\n[(OSX.Sofacy).](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2015-070321-4319-99)\n\nAPT28 has continued to develop its tools over the past two years. For example,\n[Trojan.Shunnael (aka X-Tunnel), malware used to maintain access to infected networks](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2015-062518-5557-99)\nusing an encrypted tunnel, underwent a rewrite to .NET.\n\nIn addition to this, as reported by our peers at ESET last week, the group has also begun\nusing a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) rootkit known as Lojax. Because the\nrootkit resides within a computer’s flash memory, it allows the attackers to maintain a\npersistent presence on a compromised machine even if the hard drive is replaced or the\noperating system is reinstalled. Symantec products block attempts to install Lojax with the\n[detection name Trojan.Lojax.](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-100210-3030-99?om_rssid=sr-mixed30days)\n\n## Possible links to other espionage operations\n\nAnother attack group, Earworm (aka Zebrocy), has been active since at least May 2016 and\nis involved in what appears to be intelligence gathering operations against military targets in\nEurope, Central Asia, and Eastern Asia. The group uses spear-phishing emails to\ncompromise its targets and infect them with malware.\n\n[Earworm uses two malware tools. Trojan.Zekapab is a downloader component that is](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2016-052615-4530-99)\ncapable of carrying out basic reconnaissance functions and downloading additional malware\nto the infected computer. [Backdoor.Zekapab is installed on selected infected computers and](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2016-052619-1441-99)\nis capable of taking screenshots, executing files and commands, uploading and downloading\nfiles, performing registry and file system operations, and carrying out system information\ntasks. Earworm has also on occasion installed additional tools onto infected computers for\nthe purposes of keylogging and password capture.\n\nDuring 2016, Symantec observed some overlap between the command and control (C&C)\ninfrastructure used by Earworm and the C&C infrastructure used by Grizzly Steppe (the U.S.\ngovernment code name for APT28 and related actors), implying a potential connection\nbetween Earworm and APT28. However, Earworm also appears to conduct separate\noperations from APT28 and thus Symantec tracks them as a distinct group.\n\n## An ongoing threat\n\nIt is now clear that after being implicated in the U.S. presidential election attacks in late 2016,\nAPT28 was undeterred by the resulting publicity and continues to mount further attacks using\nits existing tools. After its foray into overt and disruptive attacks in 2016, the group has\n\n\n-----\n\nsubsequently returned to its roots, mounting intelligence gathering operations against a\nrange of targets. This ongoing activity and the fact that APT28 continues to refine its toolset\nmeans that the group will likely continue to pose a significant threat to nation state targets.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec has had the following protections in place to protect customers against APT28\nattacks:\n\n[Trojan.Sofacy](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2014-110315-1233-99)\n[Backdoor.SofacyX](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-092116-1134-99)\n[Infostealer.Sofacy](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2011-090714-2907-99)\n[OSX.Sofacy](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2015-070321-4319-99)\n[Trojan.Shunnael](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2015-062518-5557-99)\n[Trojan.Lojax](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-100210-3030-99?om_rssid=sr-mixed30days)\n\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Earworm attacks:\n\n[Trojan.Zekapab](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2016-052615-4530-99)\n[Backdoor.Zekapab](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2016-052619-1441-99)\n\n## Threat Intelligence\n\n[Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI)](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nservice have received reports on the “Swallowtail” (also known as APT28), which detail\nmethods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.\n\n## File Attachments\n\n[APT28 indicators of compromiseTXT1.77 KB](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/APT28_IOCs.txt)\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n## Want to comment on this post?\n\n\n-----",
