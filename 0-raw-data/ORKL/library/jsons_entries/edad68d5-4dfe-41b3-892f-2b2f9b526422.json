This campaign has been active since at least June 2021 deploying a\n[constantly evolving set of implants derived from the Gold Dragon/Brave Prince family of implants. The attackers used Blogspot in this](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/gold-dragon-widens-olympics-malware-attacks-gains-permanent-presence-on-victims-systems/)\ncampaign to host their malicious artifacts. Talos coordinated with Google to alert them of these blog posts. Google removed these posts and\nrelated IOCs prior to publication of this blog post. We also shared this information with appropriate national security partners as well as our our\n[industry partners, including the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA).](https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/)\n\n## How did it work?\n\nTalos has found a new set of malicious blogs operated by Kimsuky delivering three previously unknown preliminary components: an initial\nbeacon script, a file exfiltrator and an implant instrumentor. One of these components, the implant instrumentor, delivered an additional three\ntypes of malware:\n\nAn information gathering module.\n\n\n-----\n\ney ogge odu e\nA file injector module that injects a specified payload into a benign process.\n\nThe injected payload is a trojanized version of the Nirsoft WebBrowserPassview tool meant to extract login credentials for various websites.\n\n[Our research builds on earlier findings from security firm AhnLAB. As noted in their June 2021 report, this campaign begins with malicious](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/24443/)\nMicrosoft Office documents (maldocs) containing macros being delivered to victims. The infection chain results in the malware reaching out to\nmalicious blogs set up by the attackers. These blogs provide the attackers the ability to update the malicious content posted in the blog\ndepending on whether a victim is of value to the attackers.\n\n## So what?\n\n[Kimsuky employs a wide variety of malware such as Gold Dragon, Babyshark, Appleseed, etc. Kimsuky primarily targets entities in South](https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g%3DKimsuky%252C%2520Velvet%2520Chollima%26n%3D1)\nKorea ranging from defense, to education and think tanks.\n\nThis campaign is a typical example of an advanced adversary utilizing a public web content publishing service to serve malicious implants to\ntheir targets. The use of Blogspot might be intended to thwart attribution or periodically update the content to serve new implants to victims of\ninterest.\n\nThe implants deployed by Kimsuky in this campaign consist of file exfiltrators, information gathers and credential stealers — all geared toward\nreconnaissance, espionage and credential harvesting. The module meant for exfiltrating files from the endpoint uses a distinct filepath list\nspecified by the threat actors.\n\nOrganizations must remain vigilant against motivated adversaries that conduct targeted attacks.\n\n## Attribution and targeting\n\n### Attribution to Kimsuky\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this campaign is operated by Kimsuky, based on the code similarities, TTPs and infrastructure overlap\nwith previous Kimsuky implants and campaigns.\n\nThe implants used in this campaign share code with the Gold Dragon and Brave Prince family of implants. For example, from early 2021\nthrough August, the attackers utilized mailbox-based exfiltration components that are derived from the Brave Prince malware family that's been\nattributed to Kimsuky in the past.\n\nOther maldocs used in parallel to Kimsuky campaigns contain similar macros to the ones abusing malicious Blogspot posts. One specific\nmalicious VBA function commonly seen between both sets of maldocs would collect preliminary information and construct a query-based URL\nto convey the sysinfo to the attackers.\n\nLeft: Known Kimsuky maldocs vs. Right: Maldocs abusing Blogspot.\n\nIdentical functions have been seen in Kimsuky maldocs throughout this year.\n\nIn one such maldoc, apart from shared macro code, this maldoc also shared identical metadata as the maldocs abusing Blogspot with identical\ncreation times and unique author names.\n\nThe malicious URL used by this maldoc hxxp://eucie09111[.]myartsonline[.]com/0502/v.php is a known Kimsuky IOC in use since late 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nMacros seen in similar maldocs (left) using the same infrastructure as previous Kimsuky maldocs from 2020 (right).\n\n### Targeting\n\nKimsuky is a highly motivated APT that has traditionally targeted entities in South Korea. The APT group has used a variety of malware such\nas Gold Dragon, Babyshark and Appleseed to target entities ranging from defense to education and think tanks. The current campaign aims to\nfurther these goals by targeting high-value targets belonging to geopolitical research institutions and think tanks. We've also observed targeting\nof aerospace research agencies by Kimsuky in this campaign using modular reconnaissance and exfiltration implants.\n\nUsually, file exfiltrator components used in crimeware and APT operations perform a wide sweep of the infected endpoint to gain insight into\nthe kind of data and research artifacts the system holds. Some file enumerators will exfiltrate all files with specific extensions. In other cases,\nthe attackers will obtain a comprehensive file listing of specific directories and then exfiltrate hand-picked data from the victims.\n\nIn this campaign, the attackers used a file exfiltrator component with an interesting implementation. Instead of performing a wide sweep of the\nsystem (seen very rarely in this campaign), the attackers focussed on finding and exfiltrating specific files of interest to the attackers —\nspecified by the attackers via filelists hosted on a remote server. What's interesting here, however, is that the attackers knew exactly which files\nthey were looking for. This indicates that the attackers have a deep understanding of their targets' endpoints, likely obtained from previous\ncompromises.\n\nThe identified entities targeted in this campaign include research institutions and universities conducting research on political, military, and\ndiplomatic topics pertaining to North Korea, China, the U.S., and Russia. The research topics of interest to the attackers in this campaign\nappear to be:\n\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korean denuclearization.\nUS-China relations.\nIncreased China-Russia collaboration.\n\nAn example of one of the files the attackers were looking for is:\n\n<directory_path>\\탈북자 면담.hwp which roughly translates to \"North Korean defector interview.hwp\"\n\n<directory_path>\\[redacted]_비핵화.hwp is also a document related to North Korean denuclearization.\n\nThere is an unusually high degree of focus on finding documents associated with North Korea in this campaign. Topics such as Korean\nunification, North Korean defectors, the recent increasing collaboration between China and Russia, and denuclearization align with the\ncontinued efforts by the DPRK to maintain a political advantage in East Asia.\n\nOur research also showed that the attackers had a special interest in research into aerospace and aeronautical technologies conducted by\nSouth Korean entities. These entities mostly consist of labs and research institutes associated with the South Korean government and\naerospace industry. In this campaign, the attackers appear to be looking for restricted research papers, theses and project design documents\nto exfiltrate. Specific topics of interest to the attackers in this domain include:\n\nRocket design.\nMaterial science.\nAviation fuel research.\nFluid mechanics.\n\nThis focus on aerospace and aeronautical research by Kimsuky aligns with the DPRK's continued efforts towards increasing their traditional\n[and nuclear arsenal. Although active since 1984, the rapid increase in missile testing by North Korea since 2019 has been accompanied by an](https://missilethreat.csis.org/country/dprk/)\nacceleration in their espionage efforts to gather classified research on such technologies.\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeting information for this campaign.\n\n## Maldocs\n\nThe maldocs used in this campaign typically contain a malicious VBA macro that downloads and activates the next stage of the infection chain.\nAlthough the VBA macro contains an auto open subroutine, it uses several VBA functions registered to trigger if the \"Typing replaces selection\"\nproperty is enabled in Microsoft Word. The VBA functions trigger when the victim types any content into the maldoc. Therefore, to trick victims\n\n\n-----\n\nto typ g co te t t e a doc, t e attac e s d sgu se t e a docs as o s\n\nMalicious macro functions triggered when the target enters text in the maldoc form.\n\nThe pivotal function of the malicious VBA code simply base64 decodes and drops a malicious VBScript to a file specified in the macro.\n\nE.g. %Appdata%\\desktop.ini\n\nThe next stage of the VBS is run using wscript.exe using a command such as:\n\n%windir%\\System32\\wscript.exe //e:vbscript //b <path_to_Stage_2>\n\nMacros dropping VBS to disk and running via wscript.exe.\n\n### Stage 2 VBS\n\nThe Stage 2 VBS is meant to replace itself with another base64-decoded VBScript (Stage 3). The Stage 2 VBS is also responsible for setting\nup persistence for Stage 3 by creating a shortcut for it in the current user's Startup directory, which will be important to remember later.\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 2 setting up Stage 3 VBS on the endpoint.\n\n### Stage 3 VBS\n\nThe Stage 3 VBS is the one responsible for downloading malicious content from a Blogspot blog setup by the attackers. This blog contains a\nbase64-encoded VBScript that is decoded and executed by Stage 3.\n\nThe blog is parsed for specific tags to identify its body and this content is then decoded and run on the endpoint:\n\nStage 3 downloading and parsing the blogpost's body for the next VBScript to be run on the endpoint.\n\n## Malicious Blogspot content — Post-compromise activities\n\nTalos has discovered three different types content hosted on multiple malicious blog posts since June 2021:\n\nInitial beacon scripts.\nFile exfiltration modules.\nImplant instrumentor modules.\n\n### I'm alive! — Initial Beacon\n\nTypically, the post body contains VBS code to send a beacon to an attacker-controlled remote location indicating successful compromise of the\n\n\n-----\n\nct\n\nMalicious blogpost from July 2021.\n\nDecoded content of the post from July 2021.\n\nThe Stage 3 VBS scripts are configured to run at Startup (via the LNK in Startup directory installed by Stage 2 scripts) when the victim restarts\nor logs into their system. This means that every time the victim logs back into the infected endpoint, the Stage 3 VBScript will query the\nmalicious Blogspot location for content to execute on the victim's system. This gives the attackers ample time to modify the content of the blog\npost with new malicious content that can be executed on the endpoint.\n\n### File exfiltration module\n\nTypical file exfiltration modules deployed by threat actors usually consist of the ability to enumerate and exfiltrate files. These implants\nenumerate files in specific drives or directories and exfiltrate the file lists first. Once the attackers identify the files of interest, the module is\ninstrumented for exfiltration of the files.\n\nThe VBScript-based file recon module used by the attackers is somewhat different. It downloads a file listing from a remote location that\ncontains the file paths of specific files of interest to the attackers. The file listing is so precise that the attackers know the exact file paths of the\nfiles they're looking for on an infected endpoint. This indicates that the attackers have a deep knowledge of their targets' systems likely from\nprevious compromises of the targets.\n\nIf any of the files listed are found by the implant, it will copy them over to another directory such as %temp%. The directory will be zipped up\ninto a ZIP file and exfiltrated to a remote location specified by the file exfiltration module. The uploaded files are identified by a victim ID in the\nHTTP POST request while uploading the ZIP file to the attacker-specified URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nFile recon and exfiltration module.\n\n**Mark as exfiltrated: The attackers also perform a preliminary check to verify if the victim has already been compromised and files exfiltrated.**\nThis prevents re-infection of the target.\n\nA marker file is created in an attacker-specified folder and is checked before the exfiltration module begins its malicious activities. If found, the\nmodule will simply exit. If the marker file is not found, the module will proceed with its recon and exfiltration activities.\n\nIn August 2021, we saw a minor variation of the same script being deployed in the wild. This variation consisted of the ability to send the initial\nbeacon (described previously) to the attackers and the file exfiltration.\n\nAnother modification in this variant was the use of a victim specific query field in the beacon's HTTP GET request. The URL constructed had\nthe following format:\n\n\n-----\n\nttp // attac e _co t o ed_do a / epo t p p e a e ct _ d a e\n\nInterestingly, the victim_id is not generated by the VB script. Instead, it's hardcoded into the scripts showing that the attackers already know\nthe identities of the targets that they are trying to infect. This indicates that this is a highly targeted attack.\n\nIn October 2021, we observed another update in the file exfiltration scripts. This time, the attackers decided to perform a wide scan of a\nspecific drive on the system against a target.\n\nThe scan is done using a batch file created on the fly containing the command format:\n\ndir <drive_letter> /s >> <filename>\n\nWide range scanning of a drive.\n\n### The Instrumentor\n\nTalos also observed the usage of a third VBS based module being deployed via Blogspot. This time, an instrumentor script for deploying\nadditional implants on a victim's system. Interestingly, this script also includes the exact same capabilities of the file exfiltration module\nillustrated earlier along with other functionality. It is therefore likely that the attackers have stitched together and deployed various components\nin their attack chains. This is a characteristic typical of Kimsuky and other related groups, such as Lazarus.\n\n**Gather preliminary information**\n\nThe instrumentor script begins by collecting the following information about the infected endpoint:\n\nGather the names of all services running on the system.\nGather a list of the names of all processes running on the endpoint.\nGather the list of all files names listed in the Recent Items folder i.e. \"%Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\".\nGather all names of files listed in the Desktop folder of the current user.\nGather names of all files and programs listed in the Taskbar i.e. \"%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch\\User\nPinned\\Taskbar\".\nGet the bitness of the Operating System : \"x86\" or \"x64\".\nGet Username, OS name and version,. NET Framework version.\nGet Microsoft Version Number from the registry, specifically from reg\nkey/value: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Excel.Application\\CurVer|Default.\nThe instrumentor script also enables all macros for Office by setting the VBAWarnings registry value to 0x1\nat: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<OfficeVersionNumber>.0\\Word\\Security\\VBAWarnings = 0x1\n\n\n-----\n\ns syste o at o s t e eco ded to a e o d s t e o at\n\nSysinfo recorded file format.\n\nThe instrumentor is responsible for zipping and exfiltrating this preliminary information gathered from the endpoint. The instrumentor also\nsends all logs used by various implants for recording information from the victim's system to the attacker's server. The instrumentor script is\nsolely responsible for the exchange of information and any outbound traffic from the endpoint, not the individual implants.\n\n**Deploying the implants**\n\nOnce the preliminary system information has been gathered by the instrumentor, it will usually download and deploy three key implants on the\nendpoint. All these implants are DLL files meant to serve very specific purposes.\n\nA marker file \"qwer.txt\" is created by the instrumentor script prior to downloading and deploying any of the implants. This file acts as an\ninfection marker for the implants that check for the presence of this file before performing any malicious activities. The instrumentor script\ndownloads the DLL implants and then creates a temporary PowerShell script to deploy the DLL on the infected system.\n\nThe DLL implants downloaded to a file on disk usually have their first byte modified. This is used as an evasion mechanism to prevent\nrecognition of the executable file format. Once the DLL is downloaded, the PowerShell script resets its first byte to 0x4D. The DLL is then\ndeployed on the endpoint using rundll32.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nPowerShell script modifying and running the DLL implant using rundll32.exe.\n\n**Cleanup capabilities**\n\nThe instrumentor script also performs a cleanup of the cookies for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers. This activity is performed\nafter the implants are in place to force users to reauthenticate. This is done by simply terminating any browser processes running on the\nsystem and then deleting the cookie files on disk. The commands used are:\n\ntaskkill /f /im chrome.exe\n\ncmd.exe /c del /f \"\"%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\"\"\n\ntaskkill /f /im msedge.exe\n\ncmd.exe /c del /f \"\"%localappdata%\\microsoft\\edge\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\"\"\n\n\n-----\n\ne ect o c a s ust ated as o o s\n\nAttack chain.\n\n## Implants\n\nThe implants deployed by the attackers are:\n\nInformation-gathering DLL.\nFile injector.\nKeylogger.\n\nThese implants check if a specific file \"%AppData%\\qwer.txt\" exists on the endpoint. If the file does not exist, then execution quits. If the file\ndoes exist, the modules carry out their respective malicious activities.\n\n### Information-gathering module\n\nTo start, the implant looks for the AHNLAB V3 Antivirus software's class name \"49B46336-BA4D-4905-9824-D282F05F6576\". If the software is\nfound, the implant will hide the AV software window from the view of the infected user.\n\n**Additional information gathering**\n\nIn addition to the preliminary information gathered by the instrumentor script, this implant gathers additional information:\n\nGather all network configuration information and record to a file on disk in a folder created by the implant using the command: cmd.exe /c\nipconfig/all >>\"%s\" & arp -a >>\"%s\" where %s = <file_path>\n\n\n-----\n\nImplant gathering network information from the victim.\n\nGather all system information using the \"systeminfo\" command and record to a file: cmd.exe /c systeminfo >>\"%s\" where %s =\n<file_path>\n\nGather process information for all running processes on the system using: cmd.exe /c tasklist >>\\\"%s\\\" where %s = <file_path>\n\nRecord into a file the file information of all files residing in specific locations in each drive on the disk:\n\n\"Documents and Settings\" folder\n\"users\" folder.\n\"Program Files\" folder.\n\nThe file information recorded is:\n\nFile name.\nFile creation time is format : YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM [AM|PM]\nCurrent file size.\n\n\n-----\n\nImplant enumerating drives and gathering file information from specific folders.\n\nThe VBS-based instrumentor script is responsible for zipping up the folder that gathers this data from the victims and sending it to an attackercontrolled URL.\n\n### File injector DLL and encrypted payloads\n\nTo deploy the file injector, the instrumentor downloads additional payloads to be injected into a benign process. The injector is responsible for\nspawning a benign process on the system (such as \"svchost.exe\" or \"iexplore.exe\") and injecting the malicious payload into it via process\nhollowing.\n\nApart from stealing research, another overarching theme of the campaign is to gather credentials using trojanized tools against entities of\n[interest. The payload observed in this campaign was a trojanized version of the Nirsoft WebBrowserPassView tool (specifically v2.11). The](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/web_browser_password.html)\nattackers modified the password viewer application to dump the passwords obtained into a specific file on disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious function used to record credentials to a file on disk.\n\nThe legitimate tool extracts all credential data from the system and sends it to the GUI to be displayed to the user. The trojanized version used\nin this campaign sends the data to a log file instead.\n\n\n-----\n\nLeft - Legitimate function for sending data to the GUI vs Right - trojanized function that sends data to a log file instead.\n\nThe instrumentor script (VBS from earlier) is configured to zip up the contents of the password dump directory and exfiltrate it to the C2.\n\n### Keylogger DLL\n\nThe Keylogger is responsible for recording specific keystrokes from the victim into a log file located at: %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\pubs\\desktop.ini.\n\nIt begins recording keystrokes as soon as it is deployed on the infected endpoint via rundll32.exe.\n\nKeystrokes recorded by the implant using the GetAsyncKeyState API.\n\nThe key log is not exfiltrated by the keylogger Dll. Instead, the instrumentor VB script is the one responsible for zipping up the key log and\nsending it over to the C2 specified in the VB script.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstrumentor VB script zipping and exfiltrating the key log directory to the C2.\n\nThe instrumentation of the three key implants is as follows:\n\nInstrumentor's orchestration of implants.\n\n### Evolution of implants\n\nThe final payloads deployed by the instrumentor script consist of implants derived from the Gold Dragon/Brave Prince family of implants.\nThese two families share multiple code similarities and have been developed and operated by Kimsuky at least since 2017. The key difference\nbetween the two malware is that while Gold Dragon uses HTTP requests to exfiltrate data, Brave Prince uses attacker owned mailboxes to\nperform exfiltration. In this section we illustrate the evolution of these malware families over the past year into the three derivative implants\ndeployed by Kimsuky in this specific campaign.\nThe version of the injector implant from 2020 consists of an embedded payload which is injected into a benign process such\nas svchost.exe or iexplore.exe. The payload is decoded (xorred) and then decompressed and finally injected into the benign process. This\npayload is yet another downloader for running additional implants on the infected endpoint. Based on historical analysis it is likely that this\ninfection chain deploys a credential stealer and mailbox based exfiltration component, in a manner similar to Brave Prince.\n\n**In January 2021, we observed the deployment of a module that consists of both the information gathering and injector modules combined into**\na single DLL. This DLL carries out certain additional functionality that was removed from subsequent versions:\n\nCopy files from the \"Recent Items\" folder with extensions: lnk, doc, docx, pdf, hwp.\nDownload additional payloads from a remote URL and deploy these on the endpoint via rundll32.\n\nThis module also decompresses the keylogger module from its resources and injects it into a benign process. The keylogger module in this\n\n\n-----\n\ncase as a add t o a capab ty to deco p ess yet a ot e odu e, t e e e t ato, a d ject t s to a ot e be g p ocess Co s ste t\nwith Brave Prince, the file exfiltrator is responsible for sending the information gathered and keylogs from the system to attacker controlled\nmailboxes.\n\nWe observed continued use of such modules throughout 2021 into August.\n\nThe file injector module deploying a keylogger seen throughout most of 2021.\n\n**In early September 2021, we observed the removal of a lot of functionality from the implants. This time the injectors deployed against targets**\n[consisted of the trojanized copies of the Nirsoft WebBrowserPassView tool. This iteration also includes the information gathering functionality](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/web_browser_password.html)\nas well as the file injector.\n\nCombined info gathering and file injector module from early September 2021.\n\nThis amalgamation of the information gathering and file injection modules continued into mid-September. However, this iteration of the implant\nsaw another change. This time, the implant didn't have the injectable payload embedded as a resource in the injector module. This version of\nthe implant reaches out to two remote URLs to download, decode/decompress and deploy the payload on the infected system. One of these\npayloads consists of a trojanized version of the Nirsoft WebBrowserPassView tool. The other payload is unknown, however, it is likely that the\nattackers are using another hacktool to steal browser cookie information from the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nRemote locations for downloading the payload in the implant from mid-September 2021.\n\nFour days later, the attackers changed their implementation again. This time, the injector module only consisted of the ability to read an\nexisting compressed payload from a file on disk and inject it into a benign process. The information gathering capabilities were separated out\ninto an independent module, the information gathering module described above. The separate information gathering module (described\npreviously) was in fact created one day before this new iteration of the injector module was created.\n\nTimeline of evolution:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nKimsuky is a highly motivated threat actor targeting a number of entities in South Korea. This group has been relentlessly creating new\ninfection chains to deliver different types of malware to their victims. This campaign relies on the abuse of Blogspot to host attacker-operated\nblogs serving malicious VB based scripts to their targets. We've found preliminary malicious components from initial access beacons to file\nexfiltrators being deployed to victims. In many cases, the content of these preliminary components was combined to serve special scripts to\nvictims.\n\nThe final implants utilized by the actors in this campaign are derivatives of the Gold Dragon/Brave Prince malware families. Since late 2020,\nthe actors have introduced multiple capabilities (and removed some) in the implants eventually modularizing them into three distinct malware.\n\nApart from stealing research using bespoke file exfiltrators, another goal of the campaign is to gather credentials using trojanized tools such as\nNirsoft's WebBrowserPassView and use implants to establish continued unauthorized access into entities of interest. Such targeted attacks\ncan result in the leak of restricted research, unauthorized access for espionage and even destructive attacks against target organizations.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.
