At the center of its focus are politicians, diplomats,\njournalists, activists, and the region’s other politically active citizens.\n\nIn terms of the number of attacks we registered from January 2018 through January 2019,\nthe targets located within the Palestinian territories were very comfortably in the lead. Quite a\nfew infection attempts also fell on Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon. In its attacks, the gang uses\nmethods and tools of varying complexity degrees.\n\nOur experts have identified three subgroups in the cybergang. We have already covered two\nof those. One was the author of the [Desert Falcons campaign, and the other was behind the](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/desert-falcon-arabic-apt/7678/)\n[tailored attacks known as Operation Parliament.](https://securelist.com/operation-parliament-who-is-doing-what/85237/)\n\nNow it’s time to talk about the third, which we call MoleRATs. The group is armed with\nrelatively simple tools, but that doesn’t make its SneakyPastes campaign (named for its\nactive use of pastebin.com) less dangerous.\n\n### SneakyPastes\n\nThe campaign is multistage. It begins with phishing, using letters from one-time addresses\nand one-time domains. Sometimes the letters contain links to malware or infected\nattachments. If the victim executes the attached file (or follows the link), their device receives\nStage One malware programmed to activate the infection chain.\n\nThe letters, meant to quiet the reader’s vigilance, are mostly about politics. They are either\nrecords of political negotiations or addresses from some credible organizations.\n\nOnce Stage One malware is safely onboard the computer, it tries to secure its position,\nconceal its presence from any antivirus products, and hide the command server.\n\nThe attackers use public services (pastebin.com, github.com, mailimg.com, upload.cat, devpoint.com, and pomf.cat) for subsequent stages of the attack (including malware delivery)\nand, most important, for communication with the command server. Typically, they use several\nmethods simultaneously to deliver the extracted information.\n\n[Finally, the device gets infected with RAT malware, which offers powerful capabilities. Among](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/remote-access-trojan-rat/?utm_source=kdaily&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nother things, it can freely download and upload files, launch applications, search for\ndocuments, and encrypt information.\n\nThe malware scans the victim’s computer to locate all PDF, DOC, DOCX, and XLSX files,\nsaves them to temporary file folders, classifies, archives, and encrypts them, and finally\nsends them to a command server via a chain of domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn fact, we detect multiple tools used in this kind of attack. You can learn more about them\n[and get more technical details from this post on Securelist.](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068)\n\n### Integrated protection against integrated threats\n\nOur products are made to successfully combat the components used in the SneakyPastes\ncampaign. To avoid being among its victims, follow these tips.\n\nTeach your employees to recognize dangerous letters, both mass and targeted ones;\n[Gaza cybergang attacks begin with phishing. Our interactive Kaspersky ASAP platform](https://www.kaspersky.com/advert/small-to-medium-business-security/security-awareness-platform?redef=1&THRU&reseller=gl_kasap_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_blo_lnk_______)\nnot only provides that information but also imparts the necessary skills.\nUse integrated solutions built to stand up to complex and multistage attacks that may\nbe too tough for basic antivirus products. To resist attacks at the network level, we\n[recommend a bundle consisting of Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack and](https://www.kaspersky.ru/advert/enterprise-security/anti-targeted-attack-platform?redef=1&THRU&reseller=gl_enterprsec_oth_ona_smm__onl_b2b_blog_ban____kata___) Kaspersky\nEndpoint Detection and Response.\nIf your company employs a dedicated information security service, we recommend you\nsubscribe to Kaspersky Lab’s closed reports, where we give detailed accounts of\ncurrent cyberthreats.
