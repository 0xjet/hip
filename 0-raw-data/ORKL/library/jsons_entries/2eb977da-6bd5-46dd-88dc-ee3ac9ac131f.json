I had some\nunexpected problems that kept me away from here and a lot of work (like my tracker) that\nexplain this. But it’s time to come back (slowly) with some stuff.\n\nSo today, this is an In-Depth analysis of one stealer: “Predator the thief”, written in C/C++.\nLike dozen others malware, it’s a ready to sell malware delivered as a builder & C2 panel\npackage.\n\nThe goal is to explain step by step how this malware is working with a lot of extra\nexplanations for some parts. This post is mainly addressed for junior reverse engineers or\nmalware analysts who want for future purposes to understand and defeat some\ntechniques/tricks easily.\n\nSo here we go!\n\n## Classical life cycle\n\n\n-----\n\nThe execution order is almost the same, for most of the stealers nowadays. Changes are\nmostly varying between evading techniques and how they interact with the C2. For example,\nwith Predator, the set up is quite simple but could vary if the attacker set up a loader on his\nC2.\n\nThe life cycle of Predator the thief\n\n## Preparing the field\n\nBefore stealing sensitive data, Predator starts by setting up some basics stuff to be able to\nwork correctly. Almost all the configuration is loaded into memory step by step.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo let’s put a breakpoint at “0x00472866” and inspect the code…\n\n\n-----\n\n1. EBX is set to be the length of our loop (in our case here, it will be 0x0F)\n2. ESI have all functions addresses stored\n\n\n-----\n\n3. EAX, will grab one address from ESI and moves it into EBP-8\n4. EBP is called, so at this point, a config function will unpack some data and saved it into\n\nthe stack)\n5. ESI position is now advanced by 4\n6. EDI is incremented until reaching the same value as stored EBX\n7. When the EDI == EBX, it means that all required configuration values are stored into\n\nthe stack. The main part of the malware could start\n\nSo, for example, let’s see what we have inside 0040101D at 0x00488278\n\nSo with x32dbg, let’s see what we have… with a simple command\n```\nCommand: go 0x0040101D\n\n```\nAs you can see, this is where the C2 is stored, uncovered and saved into the stack.\n\nSo what values are stored with this technique?\n\nC2 Domain\n%APPDATA% Folder\nPredator Folder\ntemporary name of the archive predator file and position\nalso, the name of the archive when it will send to the C2\netc…\n\nWith the help of the %APPDATA%/Roaming path, the Predator folder is created (\\ptst).\nSomething notable with this is that it’s hardcoded behind a Xor string and not generated\nrandomly. By pure speculation, It could be a shortcut for “Predator The STealer”.\n\nThis is also the same constatation for the name of the temporary archive file during the\nstealing process: “zpar.zip”.\n\n## The welcome message…\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen you are positioned at the main module of the stealer, a lovely text looped over\n0x06400000 times is addressed for people who want to reverse it.\n\n## Obfuscation Techniques\n\n### The thief who loves XOR (a little bit too much…)\n\nAlmost all the strings from this stealer sample are XORed, even if this obfuscation technique\nis really easy to understand and one of the easier to decrypt. Here, its used at multiple forms\njust to slow down the analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n### GetProcAddress Alternatives\n\nFor avoiding to call directly modules from different libraries, it uses some classic stuff to\nsearch step by step a specific API request and stores it into a register. It permits to hide the\ndirect call of the module into a simple register call.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo firstly, a XORed string (a DLL) is decrypted. So for this case, the kernel32.dll is required\nfor the specific module that the malware wants to call.\n\n[When the decryption is done, this library is loaded with the help of “LoadLibraryA“. Then, a](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175(v=vs.85).aspx)\n[clear text is pushed into EDX: “CreateDirectoryA“… This will be the module that the stealer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createdirectorya)\nwants to use.\n\nThe only thing that it needs now, its to retrieve the address of an exported function\n[“CreateDirectoryA” from kernel32.dll. Usually, this is done with the help of](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createdirectorya)\n[GetProcAddress but this function is in fact not called and another trick is used to get the right](https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/windows/desktop/ms683212(v=vs.85).aspx)\nvalue.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo this string and the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER of kernel32.dll are sent into\n“func_GetProcesAddress_0”. The idea is to get manually the pointer of the function address\nthat we want with the help of the Export Table. So let’s see what we have in the in it…\n```\nstruct IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY {\n     long Characteristics;\n     long TimeDateStamp;\n     short MajorVersion;\n     short MinorVersion;\n     long Name;\n     long Base;\n     long NumberOfFunctions;\n     long NumberOfNames;\n     long *AddressOfFunctions;  <= This good boy\n     long *AddressOfNames;    <= This good boy \n     long *AddressOfNameOrdinals; <= This good boy\n}\n\n```\nAfter inspecting the structure de IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY, three fields are mandatory\n:\n\nAddressOfFunctions – An Array who contains the relative value address (RVA) of the\nfunctions of the module.\nAddressOfNames – An array who stores with the ascending order of all functions from\nthis module.\nAddressOfNamesOrdinals – An 16 bits array who contains all the associated ordinals\nof functions names based on the AddressOfNames.\n\n[source](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Windows_Executable_Files)\n\nSo after saving the absolute position of these 3 arrays, the loop is simple\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Grab the RVA of one function\n2. Get the name of this function\n3. Compare the string with the desired one.\n\nSo let’s see in details to understand everything :\n\nIf we dig into ds:[eax+edx*4], this where is stored all relative value address of the\nkernel32.dll export table functions.\n\nWith the next instruction add eax,ecx. This remains to go at the exact position of the string\nvalue in the “AddressOfNames” array.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nDLLBaseAddress + AddressOfNameRVA[i] Function Name \n  751F0000  +    0C41D4    = CreateDirectoryA\n\n```\nThe comparison is matching, now it needs to store the “procAddress. So First the Ordinal\nNumber of the function is saved. Then with the help of this value, the Function Address\nposition is grabbed and saved into ESI.\n```\nADD      ESI, ECX\nProcAddress = Function Address + DLLBaseAddress\n\n```\nIn disassembly, it looks like this :\n\nLet’s inspect the code at the specific procAddress…\n\nSo everything is done, the address of the function is now stored into EAX and it only needs\nnow to be called.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Anti-VM Technique\n\nHere is used a simple Anti-VM Technique to check if this stealer is launched on a virtual\nmachine. This is also the only Anti-Detection trick used on Predator.\n\n[First, User32.dll (Xored) is dynamically loaded with the help of “LoadLibraryA“, Then](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya)\n[“EnumDisplayDevicesA” module is requested with the help of User32.dll. The idea here is to](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-enumdisplaydevicesa)\nget the value of the “Device Description” of the current display used.\n\nWhen it’s done, the result is checked with some values (obviously xored too) :\n\n\n-----\n\nHyper-V\nVMware\nVirtualBox\n\nIf the string matches, you are redirected to a function renamed here\n“func_VmDetectedGoodBye.\n\n**How to By-Pass this Anti-VM technique?**\n\nFor avoiding this simple trick, the goal is to modify the REG_SZ value of “DriverDesc” into\n[{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318} to something else.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-available-to-vendors)\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd voilà!\n\n## Stealing Part\n\nLet’s talk about the main subject… How this stealer is organized… As far I disassemble the\ncode, this is all the folders that the malware is setting on the “ptst” repository before sending\nit as an archive on the C2.\n\nFolder\n\n**Files: Contains all classical text/documents files at specifics paths**\n**FileZilla: Grab one or two files from this FTP**\n**WinFTP: Grab one file from this FTP**\n**Cookies: Saved stolen cookies from different browsers**\n**General: Generic Data**\n**Steam: Steal login account data**\n**Discord: Steal login account data**\n\n\n-----\n\nFiles\n\n### Telegram\n\n\nInformation.log\nScreenshot.jpeg <= Screenshot of the current screen\n\n\nFor checking if Telegram is installed on the machine, the malware is checking if the KeyPath\n“Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\{53F49750-6209-4FBF-9CA87A333C87D1ED}_is1” exists on the machine.\n\nSo let’s inspect what we have inside this “KeyPath”? After digging into the code, the stealer\nwill request the value of “InstallLocation” because of this where Telegram is installed\ncurrently on the machine.\n\nStep by step, the path is recreated (also always, all strings are xored) :\n\n%TELEGRAM_PATH%\n\\Telegram Desktop\n\\tdata\n\\D877F783D5D3EF8C\n\n\n-----\n\nThe folder “D877F783D5D3EF8C” is where all Telegram cache is stored. This is the sensitive\ndata that the stealer wants to grab. Also during the process, the file map* (i.e: map1) is also\nchecked and this file is, in fact, the encryption key. So if someone grabs everything for this\nfolder, this leads the attacker to have an access (login without prompt) into the victim\naccount.\n\n### Steam\n\nThe technique used by the stealer to get information for one software will remain the same\nfor the next events (for most of the cases). This greatly facilitates the understanding of this\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo first, it s checking the SteamPath key value at HKCU\\Software\\Valve\\Steam to grab the\ncorrect Steam repository. This value is after concatenating with a bunch of files that are\nnecessary to compromise a Steam Account.\n\nSo it will check first if ssfn files are present on the machine with the help of “func_FindFiles”,\nif it matches, they are duplicated into the temporary malware folder stored on\n%APPDATA%/XXXX. Then do the same things with config.vdf\n\n\n-----\n\nSo what the point with these files? First, after some research, a post on Reddit was quite\ninteresting. it explained that ssfn files permit to by-pass SteamGuard during the user log-on.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow what the point of the second file? this is where you could know some information about\nthe user account and all the applications that are installed on the machine. Also, if the\nConnectCache field is found on this one, it is possible to log into the stolen account without\nsteam authentication prompt. if you are curious, this pattern is represented just like this :\n```\n\"ConnectCache\"\n{\n    \"STEAM_USERNAME_IN_CRC32_FORMAT\" \"SOME_HEX_STUFF\"\n}\n\n```\nThe last file, that the stealer wants to grab is “loginusers.vdf”. This one could be used for\nmultiple purposes but mainly for setting the account in offline mode manually.\n\nFor more details on the subject there a nice report made by Kapersky for this:\n\n[Steam Stealers](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07191212/Steam_Stealers_research_ENG.pdf)\n\n### Wallets\n\nThe stealer is supporting multiple digital wallets such as :\n\n\n-----\n\nEthereum\nMultibit\nElectrum\nArmory\nBytecoin\nBitcoin\nEtc…\n\nThe functionality is rudimentary but it’s enough to grab specific files such as :\n\n*.wallet\n*.dat\n\nAnd as usual, all the strings are XORed.\n\n### FTP software\n\nThe stealer supports two FTP software :\n\nFilezilla\nWInFTP\n\nIt’s really rudimentary because he only search for three files, and they are available a simple\ncopy to the predator is done :\n\n%APPDATA%\\Filezilla\\sitemanager.xml\n%APPDATA%\\Filezilla\\recentservers.xml\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\WinFtp Client\\Favorites.dat\n\n\n-----\n\n### Browsers\n\nIt’s not necessary to have some deeper explanation about what kind of file the stealer will\nfocus on browsers. There is currently a dozen articles that explain how this kind of malware\n[manages to steal web data. I recommend you to read this article made by](https://thisissecurity.stormshield.com/2018/08/28/acridrain-stealer/) [@coldshell about](https://twitter.com/coldshell)\nan example of overview and well detailed.\n\nAs usual, popular Chrome-based & Firefox-based browsers and also Opera are mainly\ntargeted by Predator.\n\nThis is the current official list supported by this stealer :\n\nAmigo\nBlackHawk\nChromium\nComodo Dragon\nCyberfox\nEpic Privacy Browser\nGoogle Chrome\nIceCat\nK-Meleon\nKometa\nMaxthon5\nMozilla Firefox\nNichrome\nOpera\nOrbitum\nPale Moon\nSputnik\nTorch\n\n\n-----\n\nVivaldi\nWaterfox\nEtc…\n\nThis one is also using SQLite for extracting data from browsers and using and saved them\ninto a temporary file name “vlmi{lulz}yg.col”.\n\nSo the task is simple :\n\nStole SQL Browser file\nExtract data with the help of SQLite and put into a temporary file\nThen read and save it into a text file with a specific name (for each browser).\n\nWhen forms data or credentials are found they’re saved into two files on the General\nrepository :\n\nforms log\n\n\n-----\n\npassword.log\ncards.log\n\n### Discord\n\nIf discord is detected on the machine, the stealer will search and copy the\n“https_discordapp_*localstorage” file into the “ptst” folder. This file contains all sensitive\ninformation about the account and could permit some authentication without a prompt login if\nthis one is pushed into the correct directory of the attacker machine.\n\n### Predator is inspecting multiple places…\n\nThis stealer is stealing data from 3 strategical folders :\n\nDesktop\nDownloads\nDocuments\n\nEach time, the task will be the same, it will search 4 type of files with the help of\n[GetFileAttributesA :](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileattributesa)\n\n\n-----\n\n.doc\n*.docx\n*.txt\n*.log\n\nWhen it matches, they have copied into a folder named “Files”.\n\n### Information.log\n\nWhen tasks are done, the malware starts generating a summarize file, who contains some\nspecific and sensitive data from the machine victim beside the file “Information.log”. For\nDFIR, this file is the artifact to identify the name of the malware because it contains the name\nand the specific version.\n\nSo first, it writes the Username of the user that has executed the payload, the computer\nname, and the OS Version.\n```\nUser name: lolilol\nMachine name: Computer \nOS version: Windoge 10\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n[Then copy the content of the clipboard with the help of GetClipBoardData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getclipboarddata)\n```\nCurrent clipboard: \n-------------- \nOmelette du fromage\n\n```\nLet’s continue the process…\n```\nStartup folder: C:\\Users\\lolilol\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\predator.exe\n\n```\nSome classic specification about the machine is requested and saved into the file.\n```\nCPU info: Some bad CPU | Amount of kernels: 128 (Current CPU usage: 46.112917%)\nGPU info: Fumik0_ graphical display \nAmount of RAM: 12 GB (Current RAM usage: 240 MB) \nScreen resolution: 1900x1005\n\n```\nThen, all the user accounts are indicated\n```\nComputer users: \nlolilol \nAdministrator \nAll Users \nDefault \nDefault User \nPublic\n\n```\nThe last part is about some exotics information that is quite awkward in fact… Firstly, for\nsome reasons that I don’t want to understand, there is the compile time hardcoded on the\npayload.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the second exotic data saved into Information.log is the grabbing execution time for\nstealing contents from the machine… This information could be useful for debugging some\ntweaks with the features.\n```\nAdditional information:\nCompile time: Aug 31 2018\nGrabbing time: 0.359375 second(s)\n\n### C2 Communications\n\n```\nFor finishing the information.log, a GET request is made for getting some network data about\nthe victim…\n\nFirst, it set up the request by uncovered some Data like :\n\nA user-agent\nThe content-type\n\n\n-----\n\nThe API URL ( /api/info.get )\n\nWe can have for example this result :\n```\nAmsterdam;Netherlands;52.3702;4.89517;51.15.43.205;Europe/Amsterdam;1012;\n\n```\nWhen the request is done, the data is consolidated step by step with the help of different\nloops and conditions.\n\nWhen the task is done, there are saved into Information.log\n```\nCity: Nopeland \nCountry: NopeCountry\nCoordinates: XX.XXXX N, X.XXXX W \nIP: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX \nTimezone: Nowhere \nZip code: XXXXX\n\n```\nThe Archive is not complete, it only needs for the stealer to send it to the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo now it set up some pieces of information into the gate.get request with specifics\narguments, from p1 to p7, for example :\n\np1: Number of accounts stolen\np2: Number of cookies stolen\np4: Number of forms stolen\netc…\n\nresults :\n\nThe POST request is now complete, the stealer will clean everything and quit.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of Predator C2 Panel with fancy background…\n\n## Update – v2.3.7\n\nSo during the analysis, new versions were pushed… Currently (at the time where this post\nwas redacted), the v3 has been released, but without possession of this specific version, I\nwon’t talk anything about it and will me be focus only on the 2.3.7.\n\nIt’s useless to review from scratch, the mechanic of this stealer is still the same, just some\ntweak or other arrangements was done for multiple purposes… Without digging too much\ninto it, let’s see some changes (not all) that I found interesting.\n\n\n-----\n\nChangelog of v2.3.7 explained by the author\n\nAs usual, this is the same patterns :\n\nCode optimizations (Faster / Lightweight)\nMore features…\n\nAs you can see v2.3.7 on the right is much longer than v2.3.5 (left), but the backbone is still\nthe same.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Mutex\n\nOn 2.3.7, A mutex is integrated with a specific string called “SyystemServs”\n\n### Xor / Obfuscated Strings\n\nDuring the C2 requests, URL arguments are generated byte per byte and unXOR.\n\nFor example :\n```\npush 04\n...\npush 61\n...\npush 70\n...\nleads to this\nHEX  : 046170692F676174652E6765743F70313D\nSTRING : .api/gate.get?p1=\n\n```\nThis is basic and simple but enough to just slow down the review of the strings. but at least,\nit’s really easy to uncover it, so it doesn’t matter.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis tweak by far is why the code is much longer than v2.3.5.\n\n### Loader\n\nNot seen before (as far I saw), it seems on 2.3.7, it integrates a loader feature to push\nanother payload on the victim machine, easily recognizable with the adequate GET Request\n```\n/api/download.get\n\n```\nThe API request permits to the malware to get an URL into text format. Then Download and\n[saved it into disk and execute it with the help of ShellExecuteA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea)\n\n\n-----\n\nThere also some other tweaks, but it’s unnecessary to detail on this review, I let you this task\nby yourself if you are curious 🙂\n\n## IoC\n\nv2.3.5\n\n299f83d5a35f17aa97d40db667a52dcc | Sample Packed\n3cb386716d7b90b4dca1610afbd5b146 | Sample Unpacked\nkent-adam.myjino.ru | C2 Domain\n\nv2.3.7\n\ncbcc48fe0fa0fd30cb4c088fae582118 | Sample Unpacked\ndenbaliberdin.myjino.ru | C2 Domain\n\n## HTTP Patterns\n\nGET  –  /api/info.get\nPOST – /api//gate.get?p1=X&p2=X&p3=X&p4=X&p5=X&p6=X&p7=X\nGET  – /api/download.get\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n### v2.3.5\n\n\n-----\n\nDiscovery – Peripheral Device Discovery\nDiscovery – System Information Discovery\nDiscovery – System Time Discovery\nDiscovery – Query Registry\nCredential Access – Credentials in Files\nExfiltration – Data Compressed\n\n### v2.3.7\n\nDiscovery – Peripheral Device Discovery\nDiscovery – System Information Discovery\nDiscovery – System Time Discovery\nDiscovery – Query Registry\nCredential Access – Credentials in Files\nExfiltration – Data Compressed\n**Execution – Execution through API**\n\n## Author / Threat Actor\n\n**Alexuiop1337**\n\n## Yara Rule\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule Predator_The_Thief : Predator_The_Thief {\n  meta:\n    description = \"Yara rule for Predator The Thief v2.3.5 & +\"\n    author = \"Fumik0_\"\n    date = \"2018/10/12\"\n    update = \"2018/12/19\"\n  strings:\n    $mz = { 4D 5A }\n    // V2\n    $hex1 = { BF 00 00 40 06 } \n    $hex2 = { C6 04 31 6B }\n    $hex3 = { C6 04 31 63 }\n    $hex4 = { C6 04 31 75 }\n    $hex5 = { C6 04 31 66 }\n    $s1 = \"sqlite_\" ascii wide\n    // V3\n    $x1 = { C6 84 24 ?? ?? 00 00 8C } \n    $x2 = { C6 84 24 ?? ?? 00 00 1A } \n    $x3 = { C6 84 24 ?? ?? 00 00 D4 } \n    $x4 = { C6 84 24 ?? ?? 00 00 03 } \n    $x5 = { C6 84 24 ?? ?? 00 00 B4 } \n    $x6 = { C6 84 24 ?? ?? 00 00 80 }\n  condition:\n    $mz at 0 and \n    ( ( all of ($hex*) and all of ($s*) ) or (all of ($x*)))\n}\n\n## Recommendations\n\n```\nAlways running stuff inside a VM, be sure to install a lot of stuff linked to the hypervisor\n(like Guest Addons tools) to trigger as much as possible all kind of possible Anti-VM\ndetection and closing malware. When you have done with your activities stop the VM\nand restore it a Specific clean snapshot when it’s done.\nAvoid storing files at a pre-destined path (Desktop, Documents, Downloads), put at a\nplace that is not common.\nAvoiding Cracks and other stupid fake hacks, stealers are usually behind the current\ngame trendings (especially in those times with Fortnite…).\nUse containers for software that you are using, this will reduce the risk of stealing data.\nFlush your browser after each visit, never saved your passwords directly on your\nbrowser or using auto-fill features.\nDon’t use the same password for all your websites (use 2FA and it’s possible), we are\nin 2018, and this still sadly everywhere like this.\nMake some noise with your data, that will permit to lose some attacker minds to find\nsome accurate values into the junk information.\nUse a Vault Password software.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Troll/Not Troll: Learn Russian and put your keyboard in Cyrillic 🙂**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStealers are not sophisticated malware, but they are enough effective to make some\nirreversible damage for victims. Email accounts and other credentials are more and more\n[impactful and this will be worse with the years. Behaviors must changes for the account](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/what-do-hackers-do-with-your-stolen-identity)\nmanagement to limit this kind of scenario. Awareness and good practices are the keys and\nthis will not be a simple security software solution that will solve everything.\n\nWell for me I’ve enough work, it’s time to sleep a little…\n\n#HappyHunting\n\nUpdate 2018-10-23 : Yara Rules now working also for v3\n\n\n-----",
