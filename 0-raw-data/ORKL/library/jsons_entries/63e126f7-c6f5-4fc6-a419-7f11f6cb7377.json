The IAAF banned\nRussia's team from competing internationally in 2015 after investigations by WADA\nfound evidence of state-sponsored doping.\n\nFancy Bears began posting medical records of Olympians online last year, with U.S.\nand British athletes making up a large proportion of those targeted. Only selected\nrecords were released, and no Russians with TUEs were named, even though\nrecords show dozens of TUEs had been granted there in recent years.\n\nAs of Monday, Fancy Bears' website contained no mention of IAAF information.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Day in Photos\n\n**[May 27, 2022](https://www.voanews.com/a/may-27-2022-day-in-photos/6592682.html)**\n\n## Recommended\n\nNew series\n**52 Documentary**\n\nBack to top\n\n\n-----",
