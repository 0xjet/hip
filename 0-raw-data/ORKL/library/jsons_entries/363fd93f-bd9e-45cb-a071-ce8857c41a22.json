BlackEnergy (a.k.a.\nSandworm) is best known, among other things, for having been involved in attacks against\nUkrainian energy facilities in 2015, which led to power outages. Like its predecessor,\nGreyEnergy malware has been detected attacking industrial and ICS targets, mainly in\nUkraine.\n\n[Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT has identified an overlap between GreyEnergy and a Sofacy](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/)\n[subset called “Zebrocy”. The Zebrocy activity was named after malware that Sofacy group](https://securelist.com/a-slice-of-2017-sofacy-activity/83930/)\nbegan to use since mid-November 2015 for the post-exploitation stage of attacks on its\nvictims. Zebrocy’s targets are widely spread across the Middle East, Europe and Asia and\nthe targets’ profiles are mostly government-related.\n\nBoth sets of activity used the same servers at the same time and targeted the same\norganization.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Details\n\n### Servers\n\nIn our private APT Intel report from July 2018 “Zebrocy implements new VBA antisandboxing tricks”, details were provided about different Zebrocy C2 servers, including\n**193.23.181[.]151.**\n\nIn the course of our research, the following Zebrocy samples were found to use the same\nserver to download additional components (MD5):\n\n7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d\n\n170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151\n\neae0b8997c82ebd93e999d4ce14dedf5\n\na5cbf5a131e84cd2c0a11fca5ddaa50a\n\nc9e1b0628ac62e5cb01bf1fa30ac8317\n\nThe URL used to download additional data looks as follows:\n\nhxxp://193.23.181[.]151/help-desk/remote-assistant-service/PostId.php?q={hex}\n\nThis same C2 server was also used in a spearphishing email attachment sent by\n[GreyEnergy (aka FELIXROOT), as mentioned in a FireEye report. Details on this attachment](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacking-campaign-uses-old-microsoft-office-flaws-to-create-backdoors-steal-files/)\nare as follows:\n\nThe file (11227eca89cc053fb189fac3ebf27497) with the name “Seminar.rtf” exploited\nCVE-2017-0199\n“Seminar.rtf” downloaded a second stage document from:\nhxxp://193.23.181[.]151/Seminar.rtf (4de5adb865b5198b4f2593ad436fceff, exploiting\nCVE-2017-11882)\nThe original document (Seminar.rtf) was hosted on the same server and downloaded\nby victims from: hxxp://193.23.181[.]151/ministerstvoenergetiki/seminars/2019/06/Seminar.rtf\n\nAnother server we detected that was used both by Zebrocy and by GreyEnergy is\n**185.217.0[.]124. Similarly, we detected a spearphishing GreyEnergy document**\n(a541295eca38eaa4fde122468d633083, exploiting CVE-2017-11882), also named\n“Seminar.rtf”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_“Seminar.rtf”, a GreyEnergy decoy document_\n\nThis document downloads a GreyEnergy sample (78734cd268e5c9ab4184e1bbe21a6eb9)\nfrom the following SMB link:\n\n\\\\185.217.0[.]124\\Doc\\Seminar\\Seminar_2018_1.AO-A\n\nThe following Zebrocy samples use this server as C2:\n\n7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d\n170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151\n3803af6700ff4f712cd698cee262d4ac\ne3100228f90692a19f88d9acb620960d\n\nThey retrieve additional data from the following URL:\n\nhxxp://185.217.0[.]124/help-desk/remote-assistant-service/PostId.php?q={hex}\n\nIt is worth noting that at least two samples from the above list use both 193.23.181[.]151 and\n**185.217.0[.]124 as C2s.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hosts associated with GreyEnergy and Zebrocy_\n\n### Attacked company\n\nAdditionally, both GreyEnergy and Zebrocy spearphishing documents targeted a number of\nindustrial companies in Kazakhstan. One of them was attacked in June 2018.\n\n_GreyEnergy and Zebrocy overlap_\n\n### Attack timeframe\n\n\n-----\n\nA spearphishing document entitled Seminar.rtf, which retrieved a GreyEnergy sample, was\nsent to the company approximately on June 21, 2018, followed by a Zebrocy spearphishing\ndocument sent approximately on June 28:\n\n_‘(28.06.18) Izmeneniya v prikaz PK.doc’ Zebrocy decoy document translation:_\n\n_‘Changes to order, Republic of Kazakhstan’_\n\nThe two C2 servers discussed above were actively used by Zebrocy and GreyEnergy almost\nat the same time:\n\n193.23.181[.]151 was used by GreyEnergy and Zebrocy in June 2018\n185.217.0[.]124 was used by GreyEnergy between May and June 2018 and by\nZebrocy in June 2018\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe GreyEnergy/BlackEnergy actor is an advanced group that possesses extensive\nknowledge on penetrating into their victim´s networks and exploiting any vulnerabilities it\nfinds. This actor has demonstrated its ability to update its tools and infrastructure in order to\navoid detection, tracking, and attribution.\n\nThough no direct evidence exists on the origins of GreyEnergy, the links between a Sofacy\nsubset known as Zebrocy and GreyEnergy suggest that these groups are related, as has\nbeen suggested before by some public analysis. In this paper, we detailed how both groups\nshared the same C2 server infrastructure during a certain period of time and how they both\ntargeted the same organization almost at the same time, which seems to confirm the\nrelationship’s existence.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor more information about APT reports please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com\n\n[For more information about ICS threats please contact: ics-cert@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:ics-cert@kaspersky.com)\n\nGreyEnergy’s overlap with Zebrocy\n\nYour email address will not be published.
