Going\nback nearly three and a half years to early 2013,\nour analysis paints a complex picture, leading\nus to assess that a range of political, economic,\nand other forces were contributing to a shift\nin Chinese cyber operations more than a year\nprior to the Xi-Obama agreement.\n\n\nBetween September 2015 and June 2016,\nwe observed 13 active China-based groups\nconduct multiple instances of network compromise against corporations in the U.S., Europe,\nand Japan. During this same timeframe, other\nChina-based groups targeted organizations in\nRussia and the Asia Pacific region. However,\nsince mid-2014, we have observed an overall\ndecrease in successful network compromises\nby China-based groups against organizations\nin the U.S. and 25 other countries. These shifts\nhave coincided with ongoing political and\nmilitary reforms in China, widespread exposure\nof Chinese cyber activity, and unprecedented\naction by the U.S. Government.\n\n\n1 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states\n\n2 http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/25/politics/us-china-cyber-theft-hack/\n\n3 https://freedomhouse.org/blog/obama-xi-agreement-will-not-resolve-china-cybersecurity-threat\n\n\n-----\n\n|KEY FINDINGS|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|13|Between late-2015 and mid-2016, 13 suspected China-based groups have compromised corporate networks in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and targeted government, military, and commercial entities in the countries surrounding China.|\n|25|Since mid-2014, we have seen a notable decline in China-based groups’ overall intrusion activity against entities in the U.S. and 25 other countries. We suspect that this shift in operations reflects the influence of ongoing military reforms, widespread exposure of Chinese cyber operations, and actions taken by the U.S. government.|\n||Since taking power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has implemented significant military reforms intended to centralize China’s cyber elements and support a greater use of network operations.|\n||Public reports in recent years have exposed Chinese cyber operations and heightened public awareness of China’s engagement in economic espionage. This likely provided the U.S. government with political support to publicly confront China over the issue.|\n||In 2014, the U.S. government began to take unprecedented measures in response to claims of Beijing’s cyber-enabled economic espionage. Although many in the U.S. initially doubted that these actions would have any effect, they may have prompted Beijing to reconsider the execution of its network operations.|\n||We have not seen evidence of a coordinated shift in the behavior of recently active China-based groups—tactical changes appear to be specific to each group’s mission and resources, and in response to public exposure of its cyber operations.|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### FACTORS  INFLUENCING  CHINESE CYBER  OPERATIONS\n\n###### CHINA IN TRANSITION: XI’S MILITARY AND DOMESTIC REFORMS CENTRALIZE CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nUnder Xi’s leadership, the Chinese military began to\nimplement many long-discussed strategies and concepts\nfor conducting the Chinese military began to implement\nmany long-discussed strategies and concepts for\nconducting operations in cyberspace.

This exposure catapulted\nthe issue of Chinese cyber espionage into the public\nconsciousness, and likely provided the U.S. Government\nwith increased momentum with which to confront Beijing\n\n- momentum that would quickly dissipate with Edward\nSnowden’s disclosures of U.S. cyber activities.\n\nIn January 2013, the New York Times disclosed details\nof a network compromise targeting its reporters that\nwas allegedly the work of the Chinese military.[27] Several\nweeks later, we released our APT1 report, attributing years\nof corporate intellectual property theft to Unit 61398 of\n\n“The report is “completely consistent\n\n\nthe PLA. APT1 and the many other exposure reports that\nfollowed describe in detail the tools, tactics, and targets\nof Chinese cyber operations, laying bare evidence to\nsupport long-held suspicions of China’s large-scale cyber\nespionage activity.\n\nWhile the reports prompted outraged denials from the\nChinese government, U.S. Government officials described the\nfindings as “essentially correct” and “completely consistent\nwith the type of activity [the U.S. government has] been\nseeing for some time.”[28 29] The threat posed by China’s cyber\noperations emerged as a prominent theme in countless\nspeeches, statements, and reports from U.S. leaders and\nfederal agencies. In May 2013, the Pentagon’s annual report\nto Congress directly accused China of using its military to\nconduct cyber operations against U.S. firms, and President\nObama prepared to raise the issue at the U.S.–China\nPresidential Summit the following month.[30] However, Edward\nSnowden’s coinciding disclosures of U.S. cyber activities\ndiverted public attention to U.S. clandestine operations,\ncomplicating any leverage that the U.S. might have had\nto rebuke China over its economic espionage activities.[31]\n\n\nwith the type of activity the Intelligence\nCommittee has been seeing for some time”\n\n**REP.

These compromises affected\na total of 25 other countries in Europe, Asia, South\nAmerica, the Middle East, and Africa. Following are\nthe specific countries, listed by frequency of incident:\n\n\n###### THE BASIS FOR ‘CHINA-BASED’\n\nAttributing cyber activity to a geographic location is a\ncomplex process. We are never fortunate enough to be\npresented with a “smoking gun”; instead we rely on the\ncareful accumulation of multiple pieces of evidence in\nsufficient quantity over time. Inevitably, as we discover\nmore about specific sets of activity, we frequently find links\nthat show us commonalities between these sets, and allow\nus to assess that the same actors are behind two formerly\ndistinct groups.\n\nSome of the factors we consider when assessing a group’s\nlocation and potential sponsorship include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n**• Operations: The scope or scale of the group’s operations**\nand their level of sophistication (e.g., adaptability, stealth,\nor access to advanced tools or exploits). What type of\ngroup would have the resources (personnel, funding,\nlength of operations) to conduct this activity?\n\n**• Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): Does the**\ngroup use tools and methodologies that are generic, publicly available, or widely known, or ones that are unique,\nnovel, or not typically seen? Such TTPs may make a group\nmore or less distinctive, and potentially act as a “fingerprint” allowing us to link together disparate incidents.\n\n**• Operational Details: Groups operate with varying levels**\nof stealth and anonymity. At one end are actors who\nmake no attempt to hide their tools or operations, and\ninstead rely on victims’ inability to respond effectively for\ntheir success. At the other end are actors who take great\npains to appear innocuous and limit or delete evidence of\ntheir presence. However, even the most careful operators\nmake mistakes that can expose key details. Clues such\nas language settings within malware, observed hours of\noperation, build paths within binaries, or the use of infrastructure or services in particular geographic locations\nmay point to a particular locale. While such indicators\ncould be used deliberately for “false flag” purposes, human error often introduces anomalies that would expose\nsuch an operation. When combined with other types of\nevidence, these indicators can help support attribution.\n\n**• Motivation: We identify likely motivations based on the**\nindividuals, organizations, or data the group targets, and\nthe themes present in any communications (spear-phishing messages, attachment contents, web sites leveraged\nas part of an attack) with the targets.\n\n\nGreat Britain\nJapan\nCanada\nItaly\nSwitzerland\nGermany\nNetherlands\nIndia\nAustralia\nDenmark\nPhilippines\nSweden\nTaiwan\n\n\nBrazil\nChina\nColombia\nEgypt\nFrance\nHong Kong\nIsrael\nKorea\nNorway\nSaudi Arabia\nSingapore\nTunisia\n\n\nAlthough we have continued to see suspected Chinabased groups compromise corporations’ networks\nin the U.S., Europe, and Japan and target entities\nin the countries surrounding China through late\n2015 and into 2016, our data shows an overall decline\nin compromises that began in earnest in mid-2014 –\nmore than a year before the Xi-Obama agreement.\nWhile there was a subsequent drop-off in activity\nleading up to President Xi’s September 2015 visit to\nthe U.S., possibly orchestrated to avoid any negative\npublicity during the meeting, it occurred during what\nwas already an ongoing decline in network intrusions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SUSPECTED CHINA-BASED ACTIVITY AGAINST  CORPORATE VICTIMS, LATE 2015 TO MID-2016:\n\nDespite the decline, China-based threat groups continue to operate. Through late 2015 and 2016, we saw suspected\nChina-based groups compromise corporations’ networks in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, while also targeting\ngovernment, military, and commercial entities in the countries surrounding China.\n\n|April – May 2016|Col2|Three groups compromised the networks of four firms headquartered in the U.S., Europe, and Asia that are involved in the manufacturing of semiconductors and chemical components used in the production of semiconductors. We did not observe data theft in any of these instances. However, in 2012, we saw one of these same groups compromise a semiconductor firm and target the workstation of a key individual active in research and development. Other China-based groups have also compromised and stolen data from semiconductor firms in the past, including as recently as July 2015.|\n|---|---|---|\n|April – May 2016||After compromising a network, the group moved laterally, harvested credentials, and deployed backdoors on systems at a U.S. high-tech corporation.|\n|March – May 2016||In what appeared to be an attempt to obtain information related to U.S. military projects, a group deployed backdoors to a victim’s web servers and harvested credentials at a U.S. government services company.|\n|August 2015 – March 2016||After compromising the network of a U.S. high-tech corporation, the group began collecting data about navigational software in RAR files, likely in preparation for transferring the data from the environment.|\n|March 2016||A group compromised a U.S. healthcare organization and deployed a backdoor providing continued access to the network.|\n|December 2012-March 2016||In December 2012 a group breached the network of a U.S. software company. In 2014, they returned to the network, packaged data on navigational projects in likely preparation for removing it from the network. The same group returned again in early 2016 and viewed files related to the same project, but they did not transfer any data out of the network.|\n|October 2015 – February 2016||In early 2016, a group prepared to transfer files out of the network of a European consulting company. The files were related to technology used in U.S. military projects.|\n|January 2016||At a European logistics company a group collected user credentials during an intrusion into the network.|\n|October – November 2015||After a group breached the network of a major media company, they stole user credentials, probably with the intent to expand their access within the network.|\n|September – October 2015||At a U.S. aerospace company, a group deployed a backdoor, conducted network reconnaissance, and harvested user credentials, likely in preparation for continued activity. We did not observe the group transferring data from the network.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2015-2016 REGIONAL SPEAR-PHISHING  ACTIVITY REFLECTS SECURITY CONCERNS\n\nIn addition to the confirmed network compromises\ndescribed above, our research identified suspected\nChina-based groups spear phishing governments and\ncommercial organizations headquartered in countries\nsurrounding China. Much of this activity appears to\nbe traditional espionage, primarily motivated by political\nand security concerns amid ongoing diplomatic tensions\nin the region.\n\nWe have strong indications that China-based groups have\nbeen conducting espionage activity in the region for more\nthan a decade as shown, for example, by our profile of a\ngroup likely backed by the Chinese government whom we\nrefer to as APT30. The Chinese Government’s use of cyber\noperations to conduct espionage in support of state\nsecurity objectives parallels similar efforts by other nation\n\n\nstates to pursue state secrets through network means.\nThe targeting and data taken during traditional espionage\nactivity typically allows us to distinguish it from corporate\nintellectual property theft. However, we frequently see\ncompromises where a group targets or steals data that\ncould equally serve military, security, and economic ends—\nsuch as navigational technology. This gray area between\nespionage that would support state economic ends and\nthat, which would support state security, makes it difficult\nto definitively characterize espionage activity without\nvisibility into the data’s end use.\n\nOn the following map we identify several instances of 2015\nand 2016 activity that indicate interest by China-based\ngroups in regional political and security targets.\n\n**RUSSIA**\n\nMid to Late 2015\n\nSpear phishing against\npossible Russian defense\norganizations and a Russian\nengineering corporation that\nserves the energy sector.\n\n**MONGOLIA**\n\nLate 2015\n\nSpear phishing\nagainst Mongolian\ngovernment targets.\n\n**SOUTH KOREA**\n\nDecember 2015\n\nSpear phishing against\nKorean IT service provider.\n\n**JAPAN**\n\nMarch 2016\n\nSpear phishing against\nJapanese government and\nprivate sector.\n\n\nSpear phishing against Taiwanese\nnews organizations, government\n**VIETNAM** agencies, and commercial entities.\n\nDecember 2015\n\n\nSpear phishing targeting\nVietnamese government\nand commercial\norganizations.\n\n\n**HONG KONG**\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nSpear phishing against Chinese\ndissidents in Hong Kong.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE MYTH OF  THE MONOLITH:\n\n###### SOME GROUPS REVAMP OPERATIONS  WHILE OTHERS CARRY ON\n\nWe have strong indications that the 72 groups we have\nobserved are based in China or otherwise support Chinese\ninterests, although we question whether there is much\nconsistency in the level of state direction or support that\neach of these groups may receive from the Chinese Government. The Chinese landscape, frequently characterized\nas monolithic and rigidly state-directed, is composed of a\nwide range of groups, including government and military\nactors, contractors, patriotic hackers, and even criminal elements. Occasionally, aligned interests between two types\nof groups may drive activity that blurs the lines between\ndirect government sponsorship and independent action.\nFor example, during territorial disputes, patriotic hackers\nmay conduct targeting activity that is indistinguishable\nfrom that of government forces. As a result, it is often\ndifficult to determine the extent to which activity is\ndirected by the Chinese Government.\n\nThe variety of changes (or lack of change) observed in\nrecent years across the groups we track demonstrates\nthe range of state direction and support that they most\nlikely receive. While this report discusses the likely impact\nof political, economic, and other forces on Chinese cyber\nactivity as a whole, the extent to which specific groups\naltered their activity in response to certain factors, such\nas the Chinese Government’s efforts to restructure its\ncyber forces, likely varies depending on how directly\nthe groups are aligned with the Chinese Government.\n\n###### CONCLUSION\n\n\nDespite an overall decline in China-based threat activity,\nmultiple groups actively conduct network intrusions, while\nothers continue to compromise servers to use as infrastructure in preparation for future network intrusion operations. We have noted some changes in tactics among\nthe groups that we track, but have not seen evidence of\ncoordinated, widespread shifts in how these groups operate. Changes in operations are more likely to be driven by\nindividual groups’ specific circumstances, resources, and\nneeds. For example:\n\n- From mid-2014 through June 2016, a group did not\nmake any changes to the tools and infrastructure that\nit used to compromise chemical companies in Germany,\nJapan, and the U.S.\n\n- From 2009 until 2014, a group relied heavily on the\nsame set of tools to compromise victims in multiple\nindustries. Then in late 2014, a report exposing one of\nits most commonly used tools likely prompted the group\nto develop and use replacements, including those that\nincorporated anti-detection techniques. While the group\nreplaced many of its tools, the actors still use some of\nthose that had been exposed.\n\n- A group that breached multiple victims in the U.S.\nthrough 2014 appears to have discontinued operations\nagainst organizations in the U.S., while continuing\nto compromise U.S.-based servers, presumably for\nuse as infrastructure in carrying out other operations.\nBetween 2015 and March 2016, the group has compromised organizations in in Taiwan, India, and Japan.\n\n\nIn 2013, when we released the APT1 report exposing a PLA cyber espionage operation, it seemed like a quixotic effort\nto impede a persistent, well-resourced military operation targeting global corporations. Three years later, we see a\nthreat that is less voluminous but more focused, calculated, and still successful in compromising corporate networks.\nRather than viewing the Xi-Obama agreement as a watershed moment, we conclude that the agreement was one point\namongst dramatic changes that had been taking place for years. We attribute the changes we have observed among\nChina-based groups to factors including President Xi’s military and political initiatives, the widespread exposure of\nChinese cyber operations, and mounting pressure from the U.S. Government.\n\nYet China is not the only actor in transition: we’ve observed multiple state-backed and other well-resourced groups\ndevelop and hone their operations against corporate and government networks. The landscape we confront today\nis far more complex and diverse, less dominated by Chinese activity, and increasingly populated by a range of other\ncriminal and state actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### To download this or other  FireEye iSight Intelligence reports, visit: www.fireeye.com/reports.html\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035\n408.321.6300 / 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) / info@FireEye.com\n\n**www.FireEye.com**\n\n\n-----",
