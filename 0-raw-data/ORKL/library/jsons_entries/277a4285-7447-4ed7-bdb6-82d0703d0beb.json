Malware\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exposed-docker-apis-abused-by-ddos-cryptojacking-botnet-malware/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exposed-docker-apis-abused-by-ddos-cryptojacking-botnet-malware/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJune 14, 2019\n11:48 AM\n0\n\nAttackers are actively scanning for exposed Docker APIs on port 2375 and use them to\ndeploy a malicious payload which drops a Dofloo Trojan variant, a malware known as a\npopular tool for building large scale botnets.\n\n[The Dofloo (aka AESDDoS) malware was first detected in 2014 [1,](https://www.kernelmode.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3483) [2,](https://lloydlabs.github.io/post/aes-ddos-analysis-part-1/) [3,](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2015-070812-0012-99) [4] and it is known for](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/reversing-arm-architecture-elf-elknot.html)\nallowing hackers to quickly assemble vast numbers of compromised machines used to\ncreate botnets that can launch DDoS attacks and — in the case of some variants — to load\ncryptocurrency miners to the infected machines.\n\nMisconfigured Docker services being abused is a known trend given that they have been\nunder constant attack since early-2018 after coinminer campaigns started spreading to the\ncloud following the drop in activity seen by ransomware operations after the end of 2017.\n\n## Attacks, infection, and abuse\n\nIn the campaign observed by Trend Micro, misconfigured APIs of the Docker EngineCommunity DevOps utility that allow external access to the communication ports are abused\nby attackers making it possible to infiltrate misconfigured servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAllowing external access — whether intentionally or by misconfiguration — to API ports\nallows attackers to gain ownership of the host, giving them the ability to poison instances\nrunning within it with malware and to gain remote access to users’ servers and hardware\nresources,\" says Trend Micro.\n\n**Query to list**\n\n**all available containers**\nThe attacks begin with an Internet scan for vulnerable Docker hosts by sending TCP SYN\npackets to port 2375 — the Docker daemon communication port which allows for\nunencrypted and unauthenticated communication— using an open source SYN/TCP port\nscanner, with the bad actors connecting to all live host they found and asking for running\ncontainers.\n\nThe Dofloo botnet malware is subsequently \"deployed using the docker exec command\" to\nall discovered containers says Trend Micro's research, executing the malware that will\nenable the \"attackers to launch several types of DDoS attacks, such as SYN, LSYN, UDP,\nUDPS, and TCP flood.\"\n\nSystem information is also collected by the Trojan after execution, with the data being\npacked and sent to its command-and-control (C&C) server allowing its masters to decide\nwhat the next course of action will be depending on the hardware configuration of the\ncompromised machine.\n\n**Dofloo (AESDDoS) malware executing remote**\n\n**shell commands**\n\n\n-----\n\nTrend Micro s research team provides a list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) containing\n[hashes of malware samples used during these attacks at the end of the report.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/aesddos-botnet-malware-infiltrates-containers-via-exposed-docker-apis/)\n\n## Previous Dofloo and Docker attacks\n\nDofloo was previously detected while being dropped by a malicious campaign that exploited\na critical server-side template injection Atlassian Confluence Server and Data\n[Center vulnerability to compromise Linux and Windows servers in late April.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vulnerable-confluence-servers-get-infected-with-ransomware-trojans/)\n\nExposed Docker APIs were abused by other malicious campaigns, with one being detected\nin March by Imperva while exploiting the CVE-2019-5736 runc vulnerability disclosed one\nmonth earlier allowing attackers to overwrite the host runc binary and gain root-level code\nexecution privileges.\n\nCryptojacking operations have also actively targeted misconfigured Docker services in\nNovember 2018 as unearthed by Juniper Networks researchers, with cybercriminals adding\ntheir own containers which executed Monero mining scripts.\n\nFurther back, in [October 2018 and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exposed-docker-apis-continue-to-be-used-for-cryptojacking/) [March 2018, other campaigns have also been observed](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coinminer-campaigns-move-to-the-cloud-via-docker-kubernetes/)\nwhile scanning the Internet for easy to infiltrate Docker hosts and deploy containers that\nwould download and execute coin miners.\n\n## Securing Docker servers\n\nWhile Docker Engine API abuse is not something new, it keeps being an issue because\nadministrators do not know how to properly secure their systems.\n\nTo make sure that their Docker hosts are secured against this types of attacks, admins\nshould be using adequate security controls that allow only trusted sources to access the\n[Docker API as explained in the Securing Docker remote daemon chapter available on the](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/)\nDocker documentation website.\n\n###
