The attack has also been observed\nagainst the financial sector in Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n\nAs Unrecom[1] is a comprehensive multi-platform Java-based remote access tool, currently not detected by\nmost AntiVirus products, it presents a risk to a large number of potential victims, regardless of operating\nsystem. The following is a screenshot of the Unrecom RAT v.2.0 (Version in Spanish):\n\nOver time, various reports in the community have documented the evolution of this tool. This evolution is\nto be expected, but its low detection rate, recent use this month through phishing emails campaigns\nagainst multiple sectors in the U.S. and association with past campaigns involving a variety of RATs\ncaptured our attention. The evolution of Unrecom RAT dates from its beginnings as a tool known as\nFrutas RAT, subsequently branded as Adwind RAT, and now Unrecom RAT.\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Frutas RAT was used in phishing email campaigns against high profile\ncompanies in Europe and Asia in sectors such as finance, mining, telecom, and government[2].\n\nUsers are granted permission to copy and/or distribute this document in its original electronic form and print copies for personal use.

It has\nsome of the following capabilities:\n\n   - Collection of System Information (e.g. IP, OS version, memory RAM information, Java version,\nComputer Name, User account compromised, etc.)\n   - Upload & Execute additional malware, typically exploiting vulnerabilities derived from collected\nsystem information\n   - Capture Webcam and Microphone, without user notification\n   - Remote Desktop to watch user activity\n   - File Manager allowing access to files in the context of the current user\n   - Browser Password theft\n   - Keylogging to capture passwords otherwise obscured from viewing\n\nIn the past, variants of the DarkComet and AcromRAT malware have also been observed beaconing to\nthe same Command & Control (CnC) servers used by the Unrecom RAT in this campaign.\n\nThis document will provide information about the recent phishing campaigns observed with this RAT and\nsome of the network indicators.\n```\nThreat Overview\n\n```\nThe increased threat activity against the U.S. state and local government, technology, advisory services,\nand health sectors in the past two weeks is of great concern to us as it is being carried through phishing\nemails with what appears to be a tool known as Unrecom RAT.\n\nThe phishing emails try to trick the users into thinking the emails are legitimate by attaching the RAT with\nthe some of the following names: Payment Invoice.jar, Payment details.jar,\nPOR#94586.zip/POR#94586.jar, INV#94586.zip/INV#94586.jar, Invitation.jar, reports-pdf.jar, US$25k.jar,\nand DBC_BANK_IMG_23456_156.jar, and lremit_Transfer_Error_Page.jar.\n\nSome of the email message subjects observed during this campaign are:\n\nSubject: Thank you\n\nSubject: FW: URGENT CONFIRMATION P/I #94578\n\nSubject: Invitation\n\nSubject: Payment details\n\nSubject: Transfer Investigation report\n\nSubject: US$25,000 TT COPY ATTACHED\n\nRemittance Error 2089/234- Reported lost of\nSubject:\ndata (Complete and email back)\n\nSubject: Transfer error, kindly reverse to us.\n\nIt appears that the latest version of this RAT is 3.2 and is being sold at “unrecom[.]net” for $500\n(Enterprise Version) and $200 (Full Version).\n\nWe find it interesting that on their website, the authors of this software recommend Unrecom RAT buyers\nto not scan created servers (malware deployed to Victim systems) at Virustotal nor Metascan.

DarkComet is\nknown to be a popular RAT used in threat activity in the Middle East[ 6,7].\n```\nRisk Assessment\n\n```\nA remote access tool provides an attacker with full control over the victim system. Once a system has\nbeen compromised, the attacker may install one or more backdoors. These backdoors provide a\npersistent foothold, using a separate command and control channel; allowing future access less likely to\nbe correlated to the original activity.\n\nThrough its modular plugin framework, this particular tool lets the attacker obtain System Information (e.g.\nIP, OS version, memory RAM information, Java version, Computer Name, User account compromised,\netc.), Upload & Execute additional malware, Capture Webcam, Remote Desktop, File Manager, Browser\nPassword Recovery, Capture Microphone, Keylogger, etc.\n```\nIndicators and Mitigation Strategies\n\n```\nThe following will present detailed information about some of the phishing emails observed and the\nattached malware:\n\n**1.** **Invitation.jar**\n```\n    File Name: Invitation.jar\n    File Size: 43866 bytes\n    MD5:    859c4c667dd0f44f80b60242d93c4b0f\n    SHA1:    40859bc18ea0ffa9bcf5af699336fbdbfd6be7f1\n\n```\nThe “Invitation.jar” malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details:\n\nFrom Sarah Alexander <mthomas3@mybluelight[.]com>\n\nSubject Invitation\n\nDate Sun, 4 May 2014 08:44:53 GMT\n\nAttachment Invitation.jar\n\nReply-To marvinflames@gmail.com\n\nX-Originating-Ip 87.117.232[.]203\n\nMessage body _Hello,_\n\n_I cordially invite you to our anniversary_\n_It is a celebration of life and love._\n\n_Just like yesterday, we have grown maturely in our_\n_relationship._\n_We are happy and hope you can join us on our day._\n\n_Check attachment for Venue, Dress code, Program event_\n_and Date._\n\n_Thank you all._\n\nCopyright © 2014 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev1 1 2014 05 21\n\n|From|Sarah Alexander <mthomas3@mybluelight[.]com>|\n|---|---|\n|Subject|Invitation|\n|Date|Sun, 4 May 2014 08:44:53 GMT|\n|Attachment|Invitation.jar|\n|Reply-To|marvinflames@gmail.com|\n|X-Originating-Ip|87.117.232[.]203|\n|Message body|Hello, I cordially invite you to our anniversary It is a celebration of life and love.

Of note, these\nphishing emails were sent to users at two separate and unrelated organizations. As you can see, when\ncompared to each other, these messages appear completely unrelated, other than the fact they both\ncontain jar files that are sophomorically “obfuscated” as pdf.jar files.\n\nNote that both the subjects, “Transfer investigation report” and “Confirm transactions before release” are\ncomparatively unique as are the senders, \"Police Department\" cmmds@sbt.co[.]in and Arthur Anderson\nalexanderharolds@arthurandersen[.]com. In addition to the fact that the emails share no attributes, the\nmalicious attachments are also unrelated.\n\nFinally, and of most interest in this diagram, the central node at the bottom of the diagram, represents the\nCommand and Control node (184.22.201[.]27) used by these two examples. While this shared resource\nis noteworthy, of particular interest is that it has also been used in other campaigns.\n\nOn the right side of the diagram are files used in two other campaigns using the ArcomRAT[8] and\nDarkComet[6,7], The fact that they share the same command-and-control infrastructure as the UnrecomRat\ncampaign make this central node all the more interesting.\n\nCopyright © 2014 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev1 1 2014 05 21\n\n\n-----\n\n## www.threatgeek.com\n @FidSecSys +1800.652.4020\n```\nThe Fidelis Take\n\n```\nThis paper seeks to highlight this campaign targeting significant enterprises worldwide, utilizing a Javabased RAT malware that is currently detected by a small set of security tools. We are publishing these\nindicators so that others in the security research community can monitor for this activity and potentially\ncorrelate against other campaigns and tools that are being investigated.\n\nFidelis XPS™, the Advanced Threat Defense solution from General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity\nSolutions detects all of the activity documented in this paper. The Fidelis Threat Research Team will\ncontinue to follow this specific activity and actively monitor the ever-evolving threat landscape for the\nlatest threats to our customers’ security.\n```\nReferences\n\n```\n1.
