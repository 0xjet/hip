Gorman. Fedir Hladyr, 35, a Ukranian national, served as a high-level manager\nand systems administrator for FIN7. He was arrested in Dresden, Germany, in 2018 at the\nrequest of U.S. law enforcement and was extradited to Seattle. In September 2019, he\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit\ncomputer hacking. At today’s sentencing hearing, Chief U.S. District Judge Ricardo S.\nMartinez said, “Cybercrime has become the greatest threat to American’s financial health,\nand to citizens around the globe.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThis criminal organization had more than 70 people organized into business units and\nteams. Some were hackers, others developed the malware installed on computers, and still\nothers crafted the malicious emails that duped victims into infecting their company systems,”\nsaid Acting U.S. Attorney Gorman. “This defendant worked at the intersection of all these\nactivities and thus bears heavy responsibility for billions in damage caused to companies and\nindividual consumers.”\n\nAccording to records filed in the case, since at least 2015, FIN7 members (also referred to as\nCarbanak Group and the Navigator Group, among other names) engaged in a highly\nsophisticated malware campaign to attack hundreds of U.S. companies, predominantly in the\nrestaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer\nsystems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers which were used or\nsold for profit.\n\nFIN7, through its dozens of members, launched numerous waves of malicious cyberattacks\non numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad. FIN7 carefully crafted\nemail messages that would appear legitimate to a business’s employees and accompanied\nemails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the email. Once an attached file\nwas opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the notorious Carbanak\nmalware in addition to an arsenal of other tools ultimately to access and steal payment card\ndata for the business’s customers. Since 2015, many of the stolen payment card numbers\nhave been offered for sale through online underground marketplaces.\n\nIn the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of businesses\nin all 50 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 20 million customer card\nrecords from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate\nbusiness locations. Additional intrusions occurred abroad, including in the United Kingdom,\nAustralia, and France. Companies that have publicly disclosed hacks attributable to FIN7\ninclude such familiar chains as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili’s, Arby’s, Red Robin, and\nJason’s Deli.\n\n“These cyber thieves orchestrated an elaborate network of hackers and systems to infiltrate\nbusinesses and exploit consumers’ personal information,” said Donald M. Voiret, FBI Special\nAgent in Charge of the Seattle Field Office. “Their specialized skills to target certain\nindustries amplified the damage exponentially. Thanks to the hard work of law enforcement\npartners both in the U.S. and overseas, these fraudsters are not beyond our reach and\ncannot hide from the law.”\n\nHladyr originally joined FIN7 via a front company called Combi Security—a fake cyber\nsecurity company that had a phony website and no legitimate customers. Hladyr admitted in\nhis plea agreement that he quickly realized that, far from being a legitimate company, Combi\nwas part of a criminal enterprise. Hladyr served as FIN7’s systems administrator who,\namong other things, played a central role in aggregating stolen payment card information,\n\n\n-----\n\nsupervising FIN7 s hackers, and maintaining the elaborate network of servers that FIN7 used\nto attack and control victims’ computers. Hladyr also controlled the organization’s encrypted\nchannels of communication.\n\nSpeaking to the court, Hladyr said he had “ruined years of my life and put [his] family through\ngreat risk and struggle.”\n\nNoting that cyber criminals must be deterred by significant sentences, Chief Judge Martinez\nsaid he was cognizant of the “ease of sitting at a keyboard and stealing money from people\naround the globe” and emphasized that would-be cybercriminals “must understand that, once\ncaught, the punishment will be significant.” The judge also ordered Hladyr to pay $2.5 million\nin restitution.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Seattle Cyber Task Force of the\nFBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington, with the assistance\nof the Justice Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Office of\nInternational Affairs, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, numerous computer\nsecurity firms and financial institutions, FBI offices across the nation and globe, as well as\nnumerous international agencies. German law enforcement authorities provided significant\nassistance by arresting Hladyr.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Francis Franze-Nakamura and\nSteven Masada of the Western District of Washington, and Trial Attorney Anthony\nTeelucksingh of the Justice Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.\n\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[USAO - Washington, Western](http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa)\nContact:\n\nPress contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at\n(206) 553-4110 or Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov.\n\n\n-----",
