    "plain_text": "We have been studying the Duqu Trojan for two months now, exploring how it emerged, where it was\n\ndistributed and how it operates. Despite the large volume of data obtained (most of which has yet to be\n\npublished), we still lack the answer to the fundamental question - who is behind Duqu?\n\nIn addition, there are other issues, mostly to do with the creation of the Trojan, or rather the platform\n\nused to implement Duqu as well as Stuxnet.\n\nIn terms of architecture, the platform used to create Duqu and Stuxnet is the same. This is a driver file\n\nwhich loads a main module designed as an encrypted library. At the same time, there is a separate\n\nconfiguration file for the whole malicious complex and an encrypted block in the system registry that\n\ndefines the location of the module being loaded and name of the process for injection.\n\n_Conventional platform architecture for Stuxnet and Duqu_\n\nThis platform can be conventionally named as 'Tilded' as its authors are, for some reason, inclined to use\n\nfile names which start with \"~d\".\n\nWe believe Duqu and Stuxnet were simultaneous projects supported by the same team of developers.\n\nSeveral other details have been uncovered which suggest there was possibly at least one further spyware\n\nmodule based on the same platform in 2007-2008, and several other programs whose functionality was\n\nunclear between 2008 and 2010.\n\nThese facts significantly challenge the existing \"official\" history of Stuxnet. We will try to cover them in\n\nthis publication, but let us first recap the story so far.\n\n## The 'official' Stuxnet story\n\n\n-----\n\nwould be four. See below for more information about them.\n\n**Compilation** **Where and when it was** **Digital signature/signing**\n\n**File name [Size]**\n\n**(bytes)** **date** **used** **date**\n\nMrxcls.sys 19840 01.01.2009 Stuxnet (22.06.2009) No\n\n\nStuxnet\nMrxcls.sys 26616 01.01.2009 Realtek, 25.01.2010\n(01.03.2010/14.04.2010)\n\nStuxnet\nMrxnet.sys 17400 25.01.2010 Realtek, 25.01.2010\n(01.03.2010/14.04.2010)\n\nJmicron,\nJmidebs.sys 25552 14.07.2010 Presumably, Stuxnet\nunknown\n\nThe first modification of the Stuxnet worm, created in 2009, used only one driver file - mrxcls.sys without\n\na digital signature.\n\nIn 2010, the authors created the second driver mrxnet.sys (to hide the worm's component files on USB\n\ndrives) and equipped mrxnet.sys and mrxcls.sys drivers with digital certificates from Realtek. The\n\nmrxnet.sys driver is of no great significance to our story, as it is a separate module not included into the\n\ngeneral architecture of the platform.\n\nOn 17 July 2010, ESET detected another driver \"in the wild\" - jmidebs.sys - which was very similar to the\n\nalready known mrxcls.sys, but had been created just three days before it was discovered. This driver was\n\nbacked with a new certificate - this time from Jmicron.\n\nUntil recently it was unclear what the purpose of this file was, but popular opinion held that it was related\n\nto Stuxnet. One theory is that the Stuxnet C&C was trying to replace the old version with the Realtek\n\ncertificate with a new one. In doing so, the authors of the worm were either hoping to prevent it being\n\npicked up by antivirus programs, or were replacing a certificate which had been blocked.\n\nUnfortunately, this theory has not been confirmed - Jmidebs.sys has never been detected anywhere. A new\n\nversion of Stuxnet capable of installing the file has also not been found.\n\nThis is the official history of Stuxnet. However, as I mentioned above, in the course of our research we\n\nhave discovered new evidence which will be discussed below.\n\n## Previously unknown drivers\n\n### rtniczw.sys\n\nWhile analyzing a user incident involving Duqu, we discovered something new - something that could,\n\npotentially, affect the whole Stuxnet story as we know it.\n\n\n-----\n\nRootkit.Win32.Stuxnet.a. This verdict was supposed to correspond to the known file mrxcls.sys described\n\nabove, but the detected file's name and checksum were different!\n\nThe file was rtniczw.sys, 26,872 bytes in size, MD5 546C4BBEBF02A1604EB2CAAAD4974DE0.\n\nThe file was a little larger than mrxcls.sys, which had a Realtek digital signature. This implied that\n\nrtniczw.sys also had a digital signature. We managed to get a copy of the file, and we were amazed to find\n\nthat it used the same Realtek certificate, but with a different file signing date from mrxcls.sys: rtniczw.sys\n\nwas signed on 18 March 2010, while the mrxcls driver had been signed on 25 January of the same year.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, rtniczw.sys used a registry key and configuration data block that was not used in Stuxnet.\n\nStuxnet used the key \"MRxCls\" and the value \"Data\", while in the case of rtniczw.sys, the key was\n\n\"rtniczw\" and the value was \"Config\".\n\nDetailed analysis of the code found in rtniczw.sys identified no other differences from the 'reference'\n\ndriver: this was the same mrxcls.sys file, created in the same year, on the same day and hour - on 1\n\nJanuary 2009.\n\nWe searched for additional information about other users who had the same file, but were unable to find\n\nanything! Moreover, we could find no information at all about the file's name (rtniczw.sys) or its MD5 in\n\nany search engine. The file had been identified only once: it had been sent for scanning to VirusTotal from\n\nChina in May 2011.\n\nApparently, the system that we were studying had been infected in late August 2011. It should be noted\n\nthat we did not find a Stuxnet infection on the system: no additional files from the Stuxnet kit had been\n\nfound. However, we did find Duqu files.\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich are not among known variants of Stuxnet.\n\n### rndismpc.sys\n\nA check in our malware collection helped identify another interesting file that was included in the\n\ncollection over a year ago. The file is named rndismpc.sys, it is 19,968 bytes in size, MD5\n\n9AEC6E10C5EE9C05BED93221544C783E.\n\nThis turned out to be another driver, with functionality very nearly identical to that of mrxcls.sys apart\n\nfrom the following exceptions:\n\n1. rndismpc.sys uses a registry key that is different from the keys used by both mrxcls and rtniczw - it\n\nis the key \"rndismpc\" with the value \"Action\";\n\n2. it uses an encryption key that is different from that used by mrxcls/rtniczw - 0x89CF98B1;\n\n3. the file's compilation date is 20 January 2008, i.e. a year before mrxcls/rtniczw were created.\n\n\n-----\n\nknow which malicious program installed it or which main module it was supposed to work with.\n\n## The connecting link: mrxcls.sys --> jmidebs.sys -->Duqu drivers\n\nThe data obtained and the available information about the drivers used in Duqu (see The Mystery of\n\n[Duqu, Part One and Part Two) can be summed up in the table below:](http://kasperskycontenthub.com/securelist/?p=31177)\n\n\n**Encryption**\n**key**\n\n\n**Registry** **Device**\n**Value**\n**key** **name**\n\n\n**Name** **Size**\n\n\n**Compi-**\n**lation**\n**date**\n\n\n**Main**\n**module**\n\n\n20.01.\nrndismpc.sys 19968 Unknown 0x89CF98B1 rndismpc \"Action\" \"rndismpc\"\n2008\n\n01.01.\nmrxcls.sys 19840 Stuxnet.a 0xAE240682 MRxCls \"Data\" \"MRxClsDvX\"\n2009\n\nmrxcls.sys 01.01.\n26616 Stuxnet.b/.c 0xAE240682 MRxCls \"Data\" \"MRxClsDvX\"\n(signed) 2009\n\nrtniczw.sys 01.01.\n26872 Unknown 0xAE240682 rtniczw \"Config\" \"RealTekDev291\"\n(signed) 2009\n\njmidebs.sys 14.07.\n25502 Unknown 0xAE240682 jmidebs \"IDE\" {3093983-109232-29291}\n(signed) 2010\n\n.sys* Different [03.11.] Duqu 0xAE240682 \"FILTER\" [{3093AAZ3-1092-2929-]\n\n2010 9391}\n\n.sys* Different [17.10.] Duqu 0x20F546D3 \"FILTER\" [{624409B3-4CEF-41c0-]\n\n2011 8B81-7634279A41E5}\n\n\n*Known Duqu drivers have unique file names for each of the variants. Their functionality, however, is\n\nabsolutely identical.\n\nAccording to our analysis, jmidebs.sys is the connecting link between mrxcls.sys and the drivers later\n\nused in Duqu.\n\nThe code of mrxcls and jmidebs drivers is largely similar. Some small differences may be due to different\n\nsettings and minimal changes in the source code, while the point of the code remains the same.\n\nHowever, more significant changes can be found in several functions:\n\n1. The service function which obtains addresses of API functions:\n\nThe version in mrxcls uses the function MmGetSystemRoutineAddress for this purpose and the\n\nrespective text names of the addresses of incoming API functions. The version in jmidebs calls its\n\nown functions to obtain API addresses using hash-sums of their names. The same functions are\n\nused in Duqu drivers, while the list of functions' hashes is twice as long.\n\n2. The function which creates stubs to inject PNF DLL into processes:\n\nThe mrxcls version uses a stub with a total size of 6332 bytes.\n\n\n-----\n\nmodules for these drivers is identical, but has different compilation dates.\n\n**Mrxcls (Stuxnet)** **jmidebs** **Duqu**\n\n\nRtlGetVersion, KeAreAllApcsDisabled,\nPsGetProcessSessionId, PsGetProcessPeb\nobtained with their own functions\n\n7061\nJul 14 13:05:31 2010\n\n\nSimilar to\njmidebs, 4 more\nfunctions added\n\n7061\nDifferent\ncompilation\ndates\n\n\n**API**\n\n**Injected**\n**EXE**\n\n\nRtlGetVersion,\nKeAreAllApcsDisabled, obtained by\ncalling\nMmGetSystemRoutineAddress\n\n6332\nJan 01 22:53:23 2009\n\n\n## Driver evolution\n\nWe have mapped out the links between known drivers whose evolution and key stages of development are\n\neasy to track.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Driver evolution from 2008 to 2011_\n\n## rndismpc.sys, rtniczw.sys and jmidebs.sys\n\nAs you can see from the diagram, it is not known which malicious program interacted with the following\n\nthree drivers: rndismpc.sys, rtniczw.sys and jmidebs.sys. The obvious question would be: were they\n\n**used in Stuxnet? In our opinion, the answer would have to be 'no'.**\n\n\n-----\n\ncases we have detected. Secondly, there hasn t been a single variant of Stuxnet that is capable of\n\ninteracting with these drivers.\n\nThe file rtniczw.sys was signed on 18 March 2010, but on 14 April 2010 the Stuxnet authors created a new\n\nvariant of the worm that made use of the \"reference\" mrxcls.sys. It is obvious that rtniczw.sys was\n\nintended for some other use. The same can be said of jmidebs.sys. We believe that the three drivers are\n\nonly indirectly related to Stuxnet and can safely be erased from Stuxnet history.\n\nThen there is another question: could these drivers have been used with Duqu?\n\nThere is no clear-cut answer here. Although all known variations of Duqu are from the period November\n\n2010-October 2011, we believe there were earlier versions of the Trojan spy created to steal information.\n\nThe three drivers in question could easily have been used in early versions of Duqu or with other Trojans\n\nbased on the Stuxnet/Duqu platform. Like Duqu, those Trojans were most probably used in targeted\n\nattacks before the appearance of Stuxnet (dating back to at least 2008), both while it was active and after\n\nits C&C was shut down. They were likely to have been parallel projects, and Stuxnet was subsequently\n\nbased on that accumulated experience and the code that had already been written. It seems highly unlikely\n\nthat this was the only project that its authors were involved in.\n\n## The driver creation process\n\nLet's try to imagine what the driver creation process looks like. A few times a year the authors compile a\n\nnew version of a driver file, creating a reference file. The primary purpose of this file is to load and execute\n\na main module, which is created separately. It could be Stuxnet, or Duqu or something else.\n\nWhen it is necessary to use a driver for a new module, the authors use a dedicated program to modify\n\ninformation in the driver's \"reference\" file, i.e. its name and service information as well as the registry key\n\nand its value.\n\nIt's important to note that they tweak ready-made files and don't create a new one from scratch. This\n\nmeans they can make as many different driver files as they like, each having exactly the same functionality\n\nand creation date.\n\nDepending on the aim of the attack and the Trojan's victim, several driver files can then be signed with\n\nlegitimate digital certificates whose origins remain unknown.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom the data we have at our disposal, we can say with a fair degree of certainty that the \"Tilded\" platform\n\n\n-----\n\nsummer/autumn 2010. Those changes were sparked by advances in code and the need to avoid detection\n\nby antivirus solutions. There were a number of projects involving programs based on the\n\n**\"Tilded\" platform throughout the period 2007-2011. Stuxnet and Duqu are two of them -**\n\n**there could have been others, which for now remain unknown. The platform continues to**\n\ndevelop, which can only mean one thing - we're likely to see more modifications in the future.\n\n\n-----",
