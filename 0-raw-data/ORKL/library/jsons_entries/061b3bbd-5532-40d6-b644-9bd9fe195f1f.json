Please understand, this is an obsolete tool, it was written in_**\n**_2016 for the FIRST VERSION of Princess Locker. The current version is improved and_**\n**_no longer decryptable._**\n\n**[UPDATE: 28th Nov 2016] – unfortunately, recently a new variant appeared, that fixed**\n**_the bug which allowed me crack this ransomware. If generating the key takes more_**\n**_than few minutes, it probably means that you has been infected by the new version of_**\n**_Princess. I am sorry, but I am not capable of helping in such case._**\n\n_If you are a researcher curious how I cracked it, you can see the decryptor’s source code:_\n_[https://github.com/hasherezade/decryptors_archive/tree/master/princesslocker_decrypt](https://github.com/hasherezade/decryptors_archive/tree/master/princesslocker_decrypt)_\n\nThe presented decryptor works ONLY for the first version of [Princess Locker ransomware](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/11/princess-ransomware/)\n(tested on sample: [14c32fd132942a0f3cc579adbd8a51ed):](https://virustotal.com/en/file/b4824678b0b388260cdf7f1d70b868cc041b9865a295cb12fbdb868dd83ebc17/analysis/)\n\nRansom note example:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this thread you will find all the information and updates about the progress.\n\nCurrently I prepared a set of two EXPERIMENTAL tools: keygen and decryptor.\n\n[You can download the full package from here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzb5kQFOXkiSakM4NnB2WTUzLVk)\n\nSee it in action on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ted84CoOPvg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ted84CoOPvg)\n\nUse the keygen first in order to find your key. If this operation went successful, you can use\ndecryptor to decrypt your other files.\n\n_[The tools are protected with PE-Lock (special thanks to Bartosz Wójcik).](https://www.pelock.com/)_\n\n## HOW TO USE\n\nIn order to use the keygen you must find one file, that you can provide in both forms:\nunencrypted and encrypted. You also need to supply the added extension. It is beneficial (but\nnot required) to supply the unique ID from your ransom note.\n\nUsage:\n```\nPrincessKeygen.exe [encrypted file] [original file] [added extension] [*unique id]\n\n```\n- – optional parameter\n\n**Example:**\n\n\n-----\n\nRead the data from your ransom note:\n\nAnd supply them to the keygen:\n```\nPrincessKeygen.exe \"square1.bmp.xauwk\" \"square1.bmp\" xauwk ujivtjf25pwt\n\n```\n**What if you don’t have any original file?**\n\nIn case if you don’t have the original copy of any of your encrypted files, you can use an\nencrypted file of one of the following formats:\n\ndoc, png, gif, pdf, docx, xlsx, ppt, xls\n\n[Then, instead of the original file, supply the preprepared header – you can find the set here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzb5kQFOXkiSR1RoVzBFdUstazg)\nHowever, this method may, in some rare cases, produce invalid results – so, supplying the\noriginal file is recommended.\n\nExample:\n\n**What if you don’t have the ransom note?**\n\nIt’s OK. Just supply the extension – but be warned that cracking may take a bit longer.\n\n\n-----\n\nCheck if your output file is valid. If so, save the key and use it to decrypt rest of your files,\nwith the help of PrincessDecryptor.\n\nUsage:\n```\nPrincessDecryptor.exe [key] [ransom extension] [*file/directory] \n\n```\n- – optional parameter – default is current directory\n\n\n-----",
