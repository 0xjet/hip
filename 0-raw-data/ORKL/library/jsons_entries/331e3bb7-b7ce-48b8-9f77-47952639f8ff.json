Victims\nare now mainly located only in Japan. Recent telemetry data indicates that the attacks are\nnot being launched via spam anymore. Instead, malicious scripts are being executed when\nthe administrators look into customer orders in their online shop’s administration panel.\n\nFigure 1. The Water Pamola attack chain\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter further searching, we noticed that an online store administrator asked about a strange\n[online order that contains JavaScript code inserted into the field where the customer’s](https://xoops.ec-cube.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=25580&forum=11)\naddress or company name would normally be located. This script is likely activated by\n[exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the said store’s administration portal.](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)\n\nFigure 2. The question asked on a forum showing the payload related to Water Pamola.\n[The above is a screenshot of the text in a forum, which is translated by Google Translate as](https://xoops.ec-cube.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=25580&forum=11)\n_Problem, there is an order that seems to be a mischievous order. The following characters_\n_are included in the address and company name._\n\nThe script connects to the Water Pamola’s server and downloads additional payloads. Taken\ntogether, this led us to believe that Water Pamola places orders with this embedded XSS\nscript across many targeted online shops. If they are vulnerable to this XSS attack, these will\nbe loaded when the victim (i.e., an administrator at the targeted merchant) opens the order\nwithin their management panel.\n\nWe have collected many attack scripts they delivered to different targets. The malicious\nbehavior performed by the scripts includes page grabbing, credential phishing, web shell\ninfection, and malware delivery.\n\nThis campaign appears to be financially motivated. In at least one instance, a site that Water\nPamola attacked later disclosed that they had suffered a data breach. Their server was\nillegally accessed and personal information, which included names, credit card numbers,\ncard expiration dates, and credit card security codes, were potentially leaked. This breach\nmight be associated with Water Pamola, and it hints that this campaign’s overall goal is to\n[steal the credit card data (similar to Magecart campaigns).](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/j/fin6-compromised-e-commerce-platform-via-magecart-to-inject-credit-card-skimmers-into-thousands-of-online-shops.html)\n\n**Analysis of the XSS attack**\n\nAs previously mentioned, Water Pamola sent online shopping orders appended with a\nmalicious XSS script to attack e-commerce administrators.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that they are not targeting a specific e-commerce framework, but ecommerce systems in general. If the store’s e-commerce system is vulnerable to XSS\nattacks, the malicious script will be loaded and executed on the merchant’s management\npanel once someone (like a system administrator or store employee) opens the said order.\n\n\n-----\n\n[These scripts were managed with an XSS attack framework called XSS.ME, which helps](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1677625)\nattackers deal with their attack scripts and the stolen information. The source code of this\nframework is shared across many Chinese public forums. The basic attack script provided by\nthe framework could report the victim’s location and browser cookies. We observed that the\nscripts used during the attacks were customized. The attackers delivered a variety of\ndifferent XSS scripts, which could include one or more of the following behaviors:\n\n**Page Grabber**\n\nThe script sends an HTTP GET request to a specified URL address and forwards the\nreceived response to Water Pamola’s server. This is usually used during an early stage of\nthe attack to grab content from the victim’s management page. Doing so allows the threat\nactor to understand the environment and design attack scripts appropriate to the victim’s\nenvironment.\n\nFigure 3. The script for grabbing page content and sending it back to the attacker\n**Credential Phishing**\n\nSome of the delivered scripts revealed that the campaign was trying to obtain administrator\ncredentials for e-commerce websites using two different approaches. The first way involves\nappending a fake login form to the page. The script hooks the mouse click event. If the victim\nenters the credential in the fake form and clicks anywhere on the page, the script will take\nthe credentials, encode them using base64, replace some characters with custom\nsubstrings, and then upload these to Water Pamola’s server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. The script to create and delete fake login form for credential phishing\nThe other approach involves showing an authorization error message and then redirecting\nthe user to a phishing website that asks users to enter their credentials. The subdomains of\ntheir phishing sites were configured to match the names of the targets’ domain, such as\n“{victim’s domain}[.]basic-authentication[.]live”.\n\nFigure 5. The script replaces the page content with an authorization error message and\nredirects users to the phishing website\n**Webshell/PHP backdoor injection**\n\nSome of the delivered malicious scripts attempt to install backdoors to the websites built with\nthe [EC-CUBE framework, which is popular in Japan. The attack we found only works on](https://www.ec-cube.net/)\nSeries 2 of EC-CUBE; the current version is Series 4, with Series 2 now under extended\nsupport.\n\nThere are three different approaches used to upload the backdoor. The first method is\nuploading a PHP web shell file by calling the native API provided by the framework. The\nname of the web shell file is hardcoded to be either “ec_ver.php,” “log3.php,” or “temp.php.”\nThe web shell can execute any PHP code sent by an HTTP POST request to the web shell.\n\nNote the screenshot in Figure 6: The same web shell with the same “only_pcd” keyword is\n[mentioned in this Chinese blog post. The blog post describes a web shell with two](http://achineseboy.com/archives/49)\ncomponents — a PHP script and an HTML uploading file — however, the second one is not\nneeded as the proper POST request can be created with any custom or third-party tool (e.g.,\nFiddler).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. The script for uploading the PHP web shell to an e-commerce website\nThe second method is modifying the page header to inject PHP code, which will then\nexecute any PHP code, sent by the parameter “ec_ver2update” in the HTTP request. Note\nthat the PHP code below is obfuscated. First, the $IDFX variable uses XOR operation (see\ncharacter ^) to decode the string “create_function”, then the resulting base64 string is\ndecoded to @eval($_REQUEST['ec_ver2update']); which is the backdoor’s code.\n\nFigure 7. The script for modifying the shop page header to inject a web shell\nThe third method is installing a malicious plugin embedded in a file named\n“MakePlugin.tar.gz” to the e-commerce framework. The plugin has been designed to drop\nmultiple PHP web shell files on the server.\n\nFigure 8. The script for uploading and installing the malicious plugin, “MakePlugin.tar.gz”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. The malicious plugin installs several files with web shells\n**Malware Delivery**\n\nIn this case, the attack script will show an alert prompt with a message that reads “Your\nFlash version is too low, please install the latest version and try again!” and then redirects the\nvictim to the fake Flash installer download website they control. (Note that Flash has been\n[declared end-of-life by Adobe since December 31, 2020.)](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html)\n\nIf the victim downloads and executes the installer downloaded from this page, the victim will\nbe infected with a variant of Gh0stRat malware, previously also named Gh0stCringe or\nCineregRAT. This RAT’s code is based on leaked Gh0st RAT source code; however, its\ntraffic encryption is customized and it added some new features, like QQ number theft. The\nGh0st RAT samples related to this campaign are obfuscated executable files, which decrypt\nthe main payload in memory and execute its main export function named “Shellex.”\n\nFigure 10. The script showing the error message and redirect to the fake Flash installer\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. The fake Flash installer download website\n**Analysis of the fake Flash installer**\n\nAs described earlier, the XSS attack script redirects the victim to a fake Flash download site.\nClicking on the “Install now” button downloads a .ZIP archive, which contains several\nlegitimate files as well as a few malicious ones, which are usually in form of DLL libraries.\nThese libraries will be sideloaded when the legitimate executable gets executed.\n\nFigure 12. The package of downloaded\n\nFlash installer\nIn this example, AdobeAirFlashInstaller.exe (legitimate file) sideloads xerces-c_2_1_0.dll\n(patched legitimate file), which then sideloads ulibs.dll (malicious file). Ulibs.dll loads\nAdob.dll, which is a ZIP archive. After extracting the content of the Adob.dll zip archive, two\nlegitimate and signed executable files are present and executed, and a similar sideloading\nprocess happens once more.\n\nFigure 13. The package inside Adob.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nHere, svchost.exe (renamed legitimate and signed Launcher.exe file from Tencent) sideloads\nUtility.dll (patched legitimate file). This patched file contains one new section called .newimp\n(new import), which adds a new import item with a reference to the oplib.dll library. This\noplib.dll library is then sideloaded.\n\nFigure 14.\n\nOplib.dll side-loading\nThis new import was very likely added manually by using a utility called Stud_PE. This utility\nhas a feature called “Import Adder,” while “.newimp” is the default name of a newly added\nsection containing newly added imports. Oplib.dll then loads a lib.DAT file from the\nwindowsfiles directory, decodes and decrypts its contents (from a hexadecimal string; XOR\n0x42), and loads it into the newly created svchost.exe process. In addition, persistence via\nregistry keys and Scheduled Tasks are configured.\n\nFigure 15. XOR routine and svchost injection\n\nAt the end, the last payload of this infection chain is a variant of a Gh0st RAT.\nCommunication with C&C uses sockets and is encrypted with simple SUB 0x46, XOR 0x19\nencryption.\n\nFigure 16. XOR routine that\n\nencrypts C&C communication\n\nFigure 17. A packetFlag “xy” was found inside this Gh0st\n\nRAT variant\nThis Gh0st RAT variant implements additional features for stealing QQ messenger user\ninformation, for example, a list of users on a given machine and their QQ messenger\nnumbers.\n\nThe code below obtains QQ numbers that are currently logged on the machine, mentioned\n[here.](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv2715942/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. The\n\ncode used to obtain user QQ numbers\n**Protecting e-commerce platforms from Water Pamola’s attacks**\n\nWater Pamola attacked online merchants with an XSS script appended onto online shopping\norders. They also perpetrated social engineering attacks to phish credentials or prompt the\ndownload of a remote access tool. Online shop administrators should be aware that potential\nattacks may come not only from spam but also from different — and unexpected — infection\nvectors. We also recommend that administrators keep the versions of any e-commerce\nplatforms in use by their websites up to date to prevent any potential vulnerabilities, including\nXSS attacks.\n\nOrganizations can benefit from having Trend Micro™ endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro\nSmart Protection Suites and [Worry-Free™ Business Security. These can protect users and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/small-business/worry-free-services-suites.html)\nbusinesses from threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages as well as\nblocking all related malicious URLs.\n\n[Indicators of compromise can be found in this appendix.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Appendix_Water-Pamola-Attacked-Online-Shops-Via-Malicious-Orders.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
