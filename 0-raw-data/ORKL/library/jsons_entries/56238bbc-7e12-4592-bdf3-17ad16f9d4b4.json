It is not surprising that Russian state-sponsored threat\n\ngroups persist in conducting attacks against targets in Ukraine and in\n\ncountries that have vocally supported Ukraine in the conflict.\n\nFor the first few months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on\n\nFebruary 24, 2022, it looked as if an unexpected but welcome victim\n\nof the war might be the cybercrime ecosystem, as the number of\n\nsuccessful ransomware attacks dropped.\n\nEighteen months on, that optimism appears short lived.\n\nRansomware attack numbers have rapidly returned to and then\n\nexceeded normal levels over the period of this report. Some well\nknown ransomware operator names remain highly active, and\n\nnew groups are joining the fray too. Other threat actors have\n\nalso continued to concern our customers, from business email\n\ncompromise attackers to Chinese cyberespionage groups, to North\n\nKorean attackers focused on cryptocurrency theft.\n\nThe Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) gathers the data\n\nobtained from the trillions of events processed by our Taegis™ XDR\n\n\n**02**\n\n**03**\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\nThe Business of Cybercrime—\n\nIs Boomtime Back?\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\nplatform.

The range of\n\nthreats remains broad, from the temporary nuisance of hacktivist\n\ndenial of service attacks to wiper attacks or IP theft and other\n\ntypes of cyberespionage, from business email compromise to data\n\nexfiltration attacks or business-threatening ransomware attacks.\n\nPrecursor cyber activity continues at scale, delivering the malware\n\nthat makes many of these cyberattacks, particularly ransomware\n\nattacks, easier and faster to carry out.\n\nAmidst all this, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU)\n\nresearchers continue to track these threats and use their knowledge\n\nand expertise to develop insights into this activity. These insights\n\nfeed into published threat intelligence and provide the indicators\n\nand technical content that allows us to create countermeasures that\n\nprovide protection for Secureworks' customers.\n\nThis report synthesizes and presents our findings for the period July\n\n2022 to June 2023.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\n**and Key Findings**\n\nThe Business of Cybercrime—\n\nIs Boomtime Back?\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n-----\n\n**Supply chain attacks on and through suppliers**\n\nprovide threat actors with maximum impact for\n\n###### 04\n\neffort expended. Threat actors as diverse as North\n\nKorean state-sponsored groups and ransomware\n\noperators have conducted notable supply chain\n\nattacks over the past year, leveraging initial victims\n\nto gain access to their customers.\n\n\n**Infostealer activity has also increased, associated in**\n\nlarge part with use by ransomware affiliates. Stolen\n\ncredentials now vie with scan-and-exploit as some of\n\nthe most significant precursors of ransomware attacks.\n\nOn a single day on one underground marketplace, as\n\nmany as seven million infostealer logs were available\n\nfor sale, well over twice as many as on the same\n\nday last year. The case for organizations to monitor\n\nunderground forums for stolen data is clear.\n\n**Drive-by downloads are becoming increasingly**\n\npopular as a malware delivery method and over\n\nthe past year have surged in use as an initial\n\naccess vector for ransomware.

Russia's primary focus is\n\nthe war in Ukraine, North Korea's is currency theft,\n\nIran's is suppression of opposition, and China's is\n\ncyberespionage. However, regional focuses are, in\n\nsome cases, starting to shift, particularly on the part\n\nof China, which is closely monitoring the impact of\n\nthe war on Ukraine on other European nations.\n\n**Artificial intelligence (AI) is a supporting tool to**\n\nexisting threat actors, rather than a new class of threat.\n\nTo date, phishing lures and Telegram bots remain the\n\nmajor tangible evidence of use of AI by threat actors.\n\nHowever, the level of interest that threat actors are\n\nshowing suggests that they may soon develop more\n\ncomplex and dangerous applications.\n\n\n###### 07\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### 05\n\n 06\n\n\nMicrosoft's disabling by default of macros\n\nin documents from the internet has forced\n\nthreat actors to innovate in how they deliver\n\n**malware.

It may not be outlandish to assume that the\n\nvast majority of “successful” ransomware operations occur without\n\nthe victim's name ever reaching the leak site—that is where the\n\nincentive to pay lies, with the victim motivated to prevent public\n\ndisclosure.\n\nLeak sites generally do not reveal whether ransomware was deployed.\n\nAnd we can't draw conclusions about how effective or impactful\n\na ransomware deployment was, and whether the victim did not\n\npay because the impact was low, or because the data stolen was\n\ninconsequential.\n\nName-and-shame statistics are useful for some things. They show\n\nhow particular variants emerge onto the scene and how they\n\ngrow and shrink in usage. But how reliable are they as indicators of\n\nimpact? Without knowing how many victims pay the ransom, we\n\ncan't determine how successful any particularly variant is in terms of\n\npayment to victim ratio. Leak site data should therefore be used with\n\ncaution. In aggregate though it is clear from the continued activity\n\nthat ransomware and data-theft extortion remain a viable criminal\n\nbusiness model and a substantial threat to businesses.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### Assessing the Size of the  Ransomware Problem\n\nAccurately assessing the scale of the ransomware problem is\n\nchallenging. Leak sites only touch on a fraction of the problem and\n\nnot all ransomware groups operate leak sites. New ransomware\n\nvariants launch regularly. Without a leak site, it is very difficult to\n\njudge how active they are.\n\nThe primary purpose of leak sites is to encourage currently\n\nrecalcitrant victims to pay. Therefore, they only show the names\n\nof victims who are yet to pay a ransom. As such, they cannot be\n\nconsidered an accurate record of any specific group's activity.\n\nNor are they an indication of the overall impact of ransomware.\n\nHistoric data from ransomware group takedowns or collapses\n\nindicate that leak sites only reveal a small percentage of overall\n\nattacks. For example, Hive's leak site listed 150 organizations, likely\n\naccounting for around 10 percent of their overall victim count of\n\n1,500. Avaddon listed just 180 victims, a small fraction of the nearly\n\n3,000 decryption keys the group released when it shuttered the\n\noperation. It is difficult to assess how representative these\n\nexamples are.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 24 hours\n\nAverage (median) dwell\ntime for ransomware actors\n\n\nNotably, the median dwell time in ransomware engagements\n\ndropped to just under 24 hours from 4.5 days in the previous year\n\nand 5.5 days in the year before that.\n\nImportantly, the incident response engagements that provided\n\nthe data used to make this calculation featured a broad range of\n\n18 different ransomware variants. This means that the data was\n\nnot skewed by a prevalence of variants that are known typically to\n\nbe deployed very quickly, such as Phobos ransomware. The dwell\n\ntimes in engagements where exfiltration of data was observed\n\nwere generally longer, but this is not universally true; in some\n\nengagements involving Black Basta, Hive, and AvosLocker—all\n\ndouble extortion ransomware schemes—we observed data\n\nexfiltration and ransomware deployment taking place more quickly\n\nthan the median dwell time of 24 hours.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### Dwell Times Are Dropping for Ransomware Attacks\n\nDespite the increasing threat posed by ransomware attacks, in\n\nmany cases early detection and response thwarts attackers from\n\nprogressing to ransomware deployment. Because of this, our incident\n\nresponders frequently discover ransomware precursor activity\n\nwithout evidence of damaging system encryption events.\n\nHowever, there have been some interesting trends over the past\n\nyear in those attacks where ransomware is deployed. Most notably,\n\nthe dwell time—the time between gaining access to a network and\n\nexecuting the ransomware—has significantly reduced compared to\n\nprevious years.\n\n###### • [In just over ten percent of cases, we saw ransomware ]\n\ndeployed within five hours of initial access.\n\n###### • [Nearly two-thirds of attacks were carried out inside one ]\n\nsingle day, nearly four fifths within one week.\n\n###### • [In around a fifth of attacks, the threat actor sat on ]\n\nthe network for longer than a week before deploying\n\nransomware.\n\n###### • [Of those, three-quarters continued to sit on the network ]\n\nfor over a month.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n-----\n\nThis absolutely does not imply that ransomware can now be ignored\n\nas a threat. Even a limited distribution on a victim's network can be\n\nhighly damaging. Hitting a single server in a production environment,\n\nfor example, might be enough to take business operations offline for\n\nenough time to cause significant financial impact. And ransomware\n\noperators and their affiliates are aware of this. The increased take-up\n\nof virtualized environments, now often crucial to many companies'\n\nIT infrastructures, makes them a viable target. More and more\n\nransomware schemes now have Linux-compatible variants, created\n\nto target VMware ESXi hosts. Threat actors have an incentive to\n\nspend minimal time on a likely-monitored Windows system before\n\nmoving to encrypt hundreds of virtual disks on a single VMware ESXi\n\nhost.\n\nDwell times can vary considerably case by case. In July 2022, in an\n\n[incident involving the financially motivated GOLD TOMAHAWK](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-tomahawk)\n\nthreat group (also known as Karakurt), Secureworks incident\n\nresponders identified 29 hosts and 10 user accounts compromised\n\nby the threat actor. Over 300GB of compressed data was exfiltrated\n\nfrom two of these hosts. The attacker had remained on the network\n\nfor as long as six weeks before incident responders were engaged,\n\nnavigating across multiple hosts in different countries possibly to\n\nlocate data to steal. The unusually long dwell time included a three\nweek hiatus from malicious activity.\n\nIn contrast, in April 2023, Secureworks incident responders\n\ninvestigated an incident where an organization that did not use\n\nSecureworks managed services experienced an intrusion where,\n\nwithin a single 24-hour period, two different ransomware variants,\n\nBuhti and AvosLocker, were deployed.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\nSo why are threat actors executing their ransomware attacks\n\nso much more quickly? CTU researchers have observed that\n\nransomware intrusions have become less complex. Threat actors\n\nare not conducting the same operations more quickly. Instead, they\n\nare conducting simpler operations. Devastating enterprise-wide\n\nencryption events, which are more difficult to execute and take\n\nlonger to carry out, are now rarer than in previous years.\n\nOne driver for this is likely the need to reduce dwell time to lower\n\nthe chance of detection. The cybersecurity industry is undoubtedly\n\ngetting better at detecting the activity that has historically preceded\n\nransomware, such as the use of offensive security toolkits like Cobalt\n\nStrike. This may be a factor in forcing ransomware operators to work\n\nmore quickly.\n\nHowever, it is also likely that the threat actors now deploying\n\nransomware are just lower skilled than previous operators. The\n\nintroduction of the RaaS model lowered the bar to entry, introducing\n\nplaybooks for affiliates to use, and allowed it to scale significantly as\n\na result.\n\nArguably, this represents a commodification of the ransomware\n\nlandscape, with scheme operators reducing the cost of operations\n\nin order to increase volume. This can be seen in the sheer number\n\nof victims named on name-and-shame leak sites. But it is also\n\nreflected in the “quality” of ransomware operations. This might\n\n[provide one reason why fewer victims are reported[4] to be paying](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-ransomware-revenue-down-as-victims-refuse-to-pay/)\n\nransoms (although such reports may not give a full picture, given\n\nthe fracturing of the ransomware landscape and the increasing\n\ndifficulties in reliably identifying cryptocurrency wallets).\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n-----\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### The Top Initial Access Vectors  for Ransomware\n\nScan-and-exploit and stolen credentials were the two largest initial\n\naccess vectors used by threat actors in the ransomware attacks\n\nSecureworks investigated, each accounting for approximately 32\n\npercent of intrusions.

Based on posts observed by CTU researchers, most\n\ndevices infected with an infostealer were running Windows 7 Home\n\nor Windows 10 Home operating systems. Typically, home computers\n\nalso have weaker security controls than corporate-managed\n\ndevices. CTU researchers expect to see an increase in the volume of\n\ncorporate credentials stolen from compromised personal devices for\n\nabuse as an initial access vector for ransomware and other malicious\n\nactivity. Limiting how employees access company resources from\n\npersonally owned devices can greatly reduce the enterprise's risk\n\nfrom infostealers.\n\nOver the past year, Russian Market also added a pre-order function\n\nto its website, enabling buyers to request logs by domain or type. It is\n\nnot clear whether this functionality has been widely taken up, but the\n\ndevelopment implies that buyers can effectively pay sellers to target\n\nspecific organizations or services.\n\nThe development of new infostealer malware advertised for sale\n\non underground forums also occurs at speed. In 30 days through\n\nMay and June 2023, we saw 12 new infostealers made available for\n\npurchase or rent on underground forums. Once advertised, they are\n\ntested and reviewed by forum users. Their developers rely on positive\n\nfeedback for success and not all will become widely used.\n\nAlthough the use of these tools to harvest credentials is clearly\n\nwidespread, firm evidence connecting specific stealers to specific\n\ncompromises is scant. This is likely to be down to two key factors:\n\none, if credentials are used in a compromise, their origin is rarely\n\nmade clear and two, the time delay between them being collected\n\nby an infostealer and used in an intrusion is likely to be significant,\n\nand certainly well beyond the scope of most incident response\n\nengagements.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n_Figure 8.

Since late 2020, the group has sought to\n\nexploit both zero-day and N-day vulnerabilities in file management\n\napplications to extort the users of such services.

This is a dynamic system that\n\ncontinually updates victim information. This includes capturing\n\nchanges to passwords and any new sites the victim accesses.\n\nIn Genesis Market terminology, the term “bot” is used to refer\n\nto malware that constantly updates the market and stolen\n\ndata, which can include anything from login details to cookies\n\nand digital fingerprints.\n\nWhen a buyer purchases a bot, they are provided with two\n\noptions to exploit the stolen data. They can either use a plugin\n\ndesigned for their existing web browser or use a dedicated\n\nChromium-based browser. Both options allow the buyer to\n\nimpersonate the victim with their stolen data, with the system\n\nhandling most of the complexity. This makes it very easy for\n\ncriminals to use the illicit access that has been obtained. Both\n\noptions come with anti-detection features to help the buyer\n\nevade security systems.\n\nIn contrast, markets like the Russian Market typically sell\n\ntraditional stealer logs. These logs are raw dumps of stolen\n\ninformation, including passwords, cookies, credit card\n\nnumbers, and personal identification details, among other\n\nsensitive data. However, they do not offer any specialized\n\nsoftware for making these logs instantly usable. Buyers will\n\nhave to manually configure their systems to utilize the stolen\n\ndata or use clear-text usernames and passwords directly.\n\nThis makes the process more labor-intensive and technically\n\ndemanding for buyers than Genesis Market's approach.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\nThis illustrates how law enforcement can disrupt clearnet activity\n\nbut may find it harder to take down services hosted on the dark\n\nweb. Nonetheless, the takedown had clearly sown distrust among\n\nusers. Chatter on underground forums indicated that some users\n\nthought the re-emerged site was a honeypot for law enforcement.\n\nSome threat actors were clearly concerned and looking for\n\nalternatives. Others may have been deterred by performance\n\nproblems caused by the custom Genesium Browser and extension\n\nneeding to communicate with command and control (C2)\n\ninfrastructure over Tor. The takedown may also have spooked the\n\nsite owners as, shortly afterwards, in June, they took the Tor site\n\ndown and sold it to an undisclosed buyer.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n###### What Made Genesis Market  So Popular?\n\nUnlike other marketplaces that typically sell static stolen\n\ndata, the Genesis Market operates a unique, highly functional,\n\nand easy to use “bot” system.

Since July 2022, the FBI had allegedly gained\n\naccess to the group's network, seized decryption keys, and issued\n\nthem to victims of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme.\n\nThis activity clearly denied the individuals behind the scheme\n\ncriminal profits while easing the pain of its many victims.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### BreachForums Breached\n\nAfter operating for a year, BreachForums, the natural successor\n\nto RaidForums, which was itself taken down in February 2022,\n\nwas targeted in March 2023 in a concerted law enforcement\n\noperation led by the FBI.

A second administrator\n\n“Baphomet” subsequently announced that the site would be\n\npermanently closed after expressing concern that some of the\n\nbackend servers might have been placed under law enforcement\n\ncontrol. On June 19, the administrator from a rival forum claimed\n\nthat they had compromised a new BreachForums site, set up by\n\nthe ShinyHunters threat group with Baphomet.

It is possible that the group has\ninstead been actively engaged in undertaking operations on\nbehalf of the Russian State, but it is also feasible they do not\nhave exclusive use of the RomCom RAT, and another group\nhas conducted those operations. It does not appear that Cuba\nransomware itself has been deployed against these Ukrainian\ntargets, and there is still no smoking gun evidence about\nroutine collusion between ransomware groups and Russian\nintelligence operations.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### TrickBot Members Sanctioned\n\nIn the case of TrickBot, people rather than infrastructure were\n\ntargeted. In February 2023, seven individuals associated with the\n\nactivities surrounding the development and deployment of TrickBot\n\nmalware were jointly sanctioned by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth\n\nand Development Office (FCDO) and the U.S. Department of the\n\nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The group,\n\n[which we track as GOLD BLACKBURN, was heavily embedded with](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-blackburn)\n\nthe operators of the now defunct Conti ransomware scheme, an\n\nespecially prolific and sophisticated criminal enterprise operated by\n\n**[GOLD ULRICK.

It follows\n\nOFAC placing its first sanction on a virtual currency mixer in May\n\n2022, due, on that occasion, to the mixer's involvement in facilitating\n\nmoney laundering for the North Korean regime.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have long come up against issues of\n\njurisdiction, which not only impede the ability to identify specific\n\nindividuals involved in a cybercriminal operation, but also shield them\n\nfrom arrest. These latest attempts at disruption versus prosecution\n\nare a possible attempt to address that. If you can't prosecute threat\n\nactors, you can at least frustrate their activities and hamper their\n\nability to make and spend money, travel internationally, or leave\n\nRussia at all.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\nThe war in Ukraine has not permanently damaged the\ncybercriminal landscape as originally hoped but third-party\nresearchers and the media have\nwhether it has blurred the lines between cybercrime and\n[nation-state activity.

However, there are exceptions. Over\n\nthe past year, we have observed cybercriminal attacks conducted\n\nby financially motivated threat groups that are likely Chinese. One\n\n[group is particularly noteworthy: GOLD FIESTA.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-fiesta)\n\nCTU analysis of GOLD FIESTA intrusion activity, which was\n\nobserved during several incident response engagements that took\n\nplace in February 2023, identified clear overlap with Hello, Cring,\n\nand Rapture ransomware precursor activity. For example, we saw\n\nthe use of a rare set-alias command for the PowerShell Invoke\nExpression cmdlet that is associated with Chinese-language\n\nresearch on antivirus evasion that was also observed in Rapture\n\nactivity in 2023, and Hello and Cring activity in 2021. It appears\n\nprobable that GOLD FIESTA developed and deployed these and\n\nlikely other ransomware families.\n\nGOLD FIESTA likely used scan-and-exploit against SharePoint\n\nserver vulnerabilities to gain access in the February 2023 intrusions,\n\n[as it has done in previous attacks.

Once they have access, they often monitor\n\nthe activity of the email account, identifying email chains with\n\nvendors and suppliers in which they can insert themselves. After the\n\nattacker has successfully initiated communication with the victim,\n\nthey provide modified legitimate financial documents or payment\n\ninstructions for the victim to send money to the attacker-controlled\n\naccounts. Attackers may also spoof victim organizations to request\n\npayment without first compromising a victim's email account. This\n\nvariation is referred to as Business Email Spoofing or CEO fraud.\n\nOver the course of the year, CTU researchers have observed threat\n\nactors employing a range of different methods to capture credentials\n\nand facilitate BEC fraud. These have included the use of offline\n\nHTML login pages to circumvent detections that look for malicious\n\nexecutables or documents that auto-forward users to fake login\n\npages. Threat actors have also been observed employing a variety\n\nof tactics to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) including\n\nsocial engineering to convince a victim to approve an authentication\n\nrequest and, less frequently, MFA fatigue attacks which send many\n\nauthorization requests in quick succession. Once a victim approves a\n\nmalicious MFA request, the threat actor can add their own device to\n\na list of approved devices to maintain persistence.\n\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\n###### Business Email Compromise— a Persistent Problem\n\nBusiness email compromise (BEC) is one of the most financially\n\ndamaging online crimes overall for organizations. It exceeds even\n\nransomware in aggregate, mainly because it is so prolific, even if\n\nindividual financial losses from BEC may be lower than individual\n\n[losses from ransomware. The FBI estimates[33] that in 2022 alone, it](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf)\n\nreceived complaints about 21,832 BEC attacks, resulting in adjusted\n\nlosses in the U.S. of over $2.7 billion USD, an increase from $2.4\n\nbillion USD in 2021. In contrast, the FBI received 2,385 complaints\n\nabout ransomware attacks in the U.S. in 2022 that resulted in\n\nestimates for adjusted losses of approximately $34.3 million.\n\nHowever, individuals and organizations may be more motivated\n\nto report BEC than ransomware attacks to the FBI which could\n\nsomewhat skew these figures.\n\nMost BEC incidents involve a threat actor intercepting an email chain\n\nand impersonating one of the participants to convince the victim to\n\nmodify details of a legitimate payment to redirect it to an attacker\ncontrolled bank account rather than the intended recipient.\n\n\n**02**\n\n\n**03**\n\n\n**04**\n\n**05**\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\n**The Business of Cybercrime—**\n\n**Is Boomtime Back?**\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\nState-Sponsored\n\nThreat Activity\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\n-----\n\n**01** Letter From Our VP\n\n\nIn one compromise analyzed by Secureworks incident responders,\n\na threat actor gained access because an employee approved\n\na malicious MFA request and did not report the incident. Once\n\nauthenticated, the threat actor added their device to a list of\n\napproved MFA devices. The threat actor leveraged this access to\n\nmonitor the victim's emails for an extended period without detection.\n\nThey then launched a successful attack to reroute a scheduled\n\npayment. In other incidents, threat actors were able to circumvent\n\nMFA completely. In one such case, thanks to non-configured\n\nConditional Access policies, the threat actor was able to gain\n\naccess without involving MFA. In another, the presence of legacy\n\nauthentication methods on the system allowed the threat actor to\n\nbypass MFA and still gain access.\n\n\nOrganizations can mitigate BEC attacks by comprehensively\n\nimplementing MFA across all user accounts, including those for\n\nsenior executives. But remember that not all MFA solutions are\n\ncreated equal; using an authenticator app is better than SMS,\n\nand number matching is an improvement on click-to-accept, and\n\nrepresents a meaningful mitigation to MFA fatigue.

Clicking on the PDF\n\ntook victims first to a gateway page that performed checks on the\n\nvictim's system and then to a prompt to download an obfuscated\n\nVBS file from the MEGA cloud file-sharing site.\n\nThreat actors have also increasingly turned to the use of malicious\n\nMicrosoft OneNote files to deliver payloads such as the RedLine\n\ninformation stealer, Qakbot, or IcedID. CTU researchers observed\n\ntwo infection chains used by unknown threat actors from January\n\n12 to January 18, 2023, to deliver RedLine. In both cases, the\n\nvictim received a OneNote file attachment. Opening it revealed\n\na blurred image which recipients were invited to click. This image\n\nwas underlaid with multiple copies of a malicious script. Executing\n\nthe script generated a pop-up warning. If the victim dismissed the\n\nwarning, the script launched a BAT file, copied a PowerShell binary to\n\na new location, and executed a PowerShell command that decrypted,\n\ndecompressed, and executed the RedLine payload.\n\nThreat actors evolved their use of OneNote files over the following\n\nmonths to avoid detection. In a campaign that delivered Qakbot, the\n\nOneNote attachment contained an embedded HTML Application\n\n(HTA) file (Open.hta) that downloaded and executed the Qakbot\n\npayload. In further campaigns to deliver IcedID, a threat actor used\n\na similar approach to the Qakbot campaign, leveraging modified\n\nHTA code to launch obfuscated VBScript code that launched a\n\nPowerShell command to download and execute the payload. CTU\n\nresearchers have investigated several intrusions that ultimately led to\n\nBlack Basta ransomware deployment where OneNote files were used\n\nto deliver Qakbot.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt approximately the same time as the DLL began neutralizing\n\ninfections, CTU researchers observed GOLD LAGOON's backend\n\ninfrastructure had stopped responding and some infrastructure had\n\nbeen replaced.

Such efforts\n\nwill make it very hard for GOLD LAGOON to reimplement Qakbot.\n\nQakbot posed a significant threat to businesses globally.

The takedown is a\n\nwelcome intervention.\n\nBy contrast, the IcedID botnet flourished in the past year, having long\n\ndispensed with its original purpose of facilitating banking fraud to\n\ninstead provide initial access to a variety of ransomware-distributing\n\nthreat groups. IcedID is used to deliver additional malware which can\n\n[lead to ransomware deployment; its operator, GOLD SWATHMORE,](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-swathmore)\n\nfunctions as an initial access broker (IAB), selling access to\n\ncompromised systems to numerous ransomware operators.

The\n\nthree pillars of this tradecraft are the use of proxy infrastructure,\n\nliving off the land through using native operating system tools, and\n\nthe ability to adapt their approach as potential target organizations\n\nincreasingly move to cloud-based solutions.\n\n###### Chinese Cyberespionage Tradecraft Stresses Operational Security and Stealth\n\nChinese threat groups have in the past had a reputation for\n\n“smash-and-grab” intrusions, where the emphasis was on achieving\n\nobjectives on the network as quickly as possible with little\n\nconsideration for detection and attribution. However, a growing\n\nnumber of Chinese threat groups have demonstrated an increasing\n\nfocus on stealth and operational security in their intrusions and\n\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure. These tradecraft\n\nimprovements have likely been driven in part by a series of high\nprofile Department of Justice indictments of Chinese nationals\n\nallegedly involved in cyberespionage activity. Other drivers include\n\npublic exposure by security vendors of this type of activity, and the\n\nconsequential likely increased pressure from Chinese leadership to\n\navoid public scrutiny of its cyberespionage activity.\n\n\n**02**\n\n**03**\n\n**04**\n\n\n**05**\n\n\n**06**\n\n**07**\n\n**08**\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nand Key Findings\n\nThe Business of Cybercrime—\n\nIs Boomtime Back?\n\nInnovations in TTPs Occur\n\nWhen Infection Chains Are\n\nForced to Evolve\n\n**State-Sponsored**\n\n**Threat Activity**\n\nThreat Actor Use of\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix\n\n\nCTU researchers have observed Chinese threat actors using\n\ncommercial tools such as Cobalt Strike to minimize the risk of\n\nattribution if they are caught and to blend in with post-intrusion\n\nransomware groups that often use these tools. Some Chinese threat\n\ngroups also appear to adjust tradecraft when returning to a target\n\nnetwork after previously being evicted, showing they are adaptable\n\nand goal-oriented. On some occasions, they may also focus their\n\nexploitation on non-Windows devices, where EDR agents may be\n\nless likely to be deployed.\n\nCTU researchers have increasingly observed Chinese threat groups\n\ndemonstrating careful consideration for operational security over the\n\npast few years including the use of living off the land tools and a C2\n\nproxy network built on compromised SOHO routers. This consistent\n\nattention to operational security also includes leaving a minimal\n\nintrusion footprint and incorporating defense evasion techniques.\n\nThis focus doesn't just contrast with China's historical reputation,\n\nit also demonstrates a heightened level of operational maturity and\n\nadherence to a blueprint designed to reduce the likelihood of the\n\ndetection and attribution of its intrusion activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey used the Cobalt Strike Beacon to execute domain-wide\n\nreconnaissance commands including running the net view\n\ncommand to list the resources in a network share hosted on a\n\nserver that stores the organization's intellectual property.

The threat actor primarily used native\n\noperating system tools (a technique known as “living off the\n\n###### .svm a -r .tmp \"\\\\    \\\" -hp\n\nland”) to achieve their objectives, as well as a command-and\ncontrol proxy network that included compromised SOHO\n\n_Figure 22. WinRAR commands to archive data from network share._\n\nrouters.\n\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe threat actor exploited a vulnerable Pulse Secure device\n\nas the initial access vector, deployed a variant of the Awen\n\nweb shell and the Godzilla web shell to a second server in the\n\nenvironment, and then conducted reconnaissance commands\n\nsuch as whoami, hostname, and net group. They then used the\n\ncertutil command to download a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload\n\n(see figure 21).\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring an incident response engagement that took place in\n\nFall 2022, CTU researchers observed a Chinese threat actor\n\nmoving from a compromised on-premises network to the\n\norganization's Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant, using\n\ntechniques that could only be detected via one specific\n\nMicrosoft log. The threat actor had obtained access to the\n\norganization's on-premises network from as early as Summer\n\n2021 after exploiting the ProxyShell vulnerabilities in an\n\ninternet-facing Microsoft Exchange server. Secureworks\n\nincident responders discovered that in Fall 2022 the threat\n\nactor created multiple accounts in the organization's on\npremises AD domain and compromised an existing Azure AD\n\nadministrator account. The threat actor used the administrator\n\naccount to add an impersonation role for Microsoft Exchange\n\nto an account they had created, and then registered a single\ntenant application within the Azure AD tenant and configured\n\nthe application to provide access to the organization's\n\nExchange Online mailboxes (see figure 23).\n\n\nThis particular intrusion not only reinforces the fundamental\n\nneed for network defenders to understand and mitigate risks\n\nbased on changing attack surfaces, but also demonstrates the\n\nimportance of extensive logging. CTU researchers strongly\n\nrecommend that organizations collect appropriate Azure\n\nAD logs to detect unusual activity in their Azure AD tenant,\n\nand audit Azure AD applications for unusual and excessive\n\npermissions.\n\nIn this specific case, the only way to observe much of the\n\nthreat actor's activity during the attack was through study of\n\n[the MailItemsAccessed[39] mailbox-auditing action, which is part](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-investigate-accounts?view=o365-worldwide)\n\nof Microsoft's premium audit functionality.

Sometimes their innovations are driven by law\n\nenforcement activity, such as taking down criminal marketplaces and\n\nforums, or by industry actions like Microsoft's disabling of macros\n\nby default, or sometimes by political imperatives like China's desire\n\nto frustrate detection of its cyberespionage activities. Often, they\n\nare another step in the arms race between malicious actors and the\n\nefforts of companies like Secureworks to create the detections and\n\ncountermeasures that power systems like Taegis™ and protect our\n\ncustomers. Some events, like Microsoft's decision to disable macros,\n\nforce almost immediate change on the part of threat actors. Other\n\nchanges are more gradual.\n\nHowever, as fast as some threat actors are to innovate, many are\n\nhappy to continue doing what still works.

This continues\n\nto demonstrate the value of focusing on the cybersecurity\n\nfundamentals alongside staying current on the latest exploits and\n\nTTPs.\n\nThe advice we regularly provide to customers is as relevant as ever:\n\nIdentify your assets and their location on your network, stay up to\n\ndate with what is happening in the threat landscape, understand your\n\nrisk profile and use it to prioritize your control framework and your\n\napproach to vulnerability management. Lockdown internet-facing\n\nsystems and sensitive internal systems using fully implemented best\npractice MFA. Instrument your network to provide comprehensive\n\nmonitoring of all endpoint, network, and cloud resources. We\n\nunderstand that these recommendations, simple as they are to make,\n\ncan sometimes be challenging to implement.
