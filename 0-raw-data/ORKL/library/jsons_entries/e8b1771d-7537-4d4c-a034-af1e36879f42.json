This\noperation, which we were able to attribute to the Naikon APT group, used a new backdoor\nnamed Aria-body, in order to take control of the victims’ networks.\n\n[In 2015, an extensive report by ThreatConnect and Defense Group revealed the APT group’s](https://threatconnect.com/blog/camerashy-intro/)\ninfrastructure and even exposed one of the group’s members. Since this report, no new evidence\nhas come to light of further activity by the group, suggesting that they had either gone silent,\nincreased their emphasis on stealth, or drastically changed their methodology of operations. That\nis, until now.\n\nIn the following report, we will describe the tactics, techniques, procedures and infrastructure that\nhave been used by the Naikon APT group over the 5 years since the last report, and offer some\ninsight into how they were able to remain under the radar.\n\n## Targeting\n\n\n-----\n\nBy comparing with previously reported activity, we can conclude that the Naikon APT group has\nbeen persistently targeting the same region in the last decade. In operations following the original\n2015 report, we have observed the use of a backdoor named Aria-body against several national\ngovernments, including Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar\nand Brunei.\n\nThe targeted government entities include ministries of foreign affairs, science and technology\nministries, as well as government-owned companies. Interestingly, the group has been observed\nexpanding its footholds on the various governments within APAC by launching attacks from one\ngovernment entity that has already been breached, to try and infect another. In one case, a\nforeign embassy unknowingly sent malware-infected documents to the government of its host\ncountry, showing how the hackers are exploiting trusted, known contacts and using those them to\ninfiltrate new organizations and extend their espionage network.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the victims and capabilities presented by the group, it is evident that\nthe group’s purpose is to gather intelligence and spy on the countries whose Governments it has\ntargeted. This includes not only locating and collecting specific documents from infected\ncomputers and networks within government departments, but also extracting data from removable\ndrives, taking screenshots and keylogging, and of course harvesting the stolen data for\nespionage. And if that wasn’t enough, to evade detection when accessing remote servers through\nsensitive governmental networks, the group compromised and used servers within the infected\nministries as command and control servers to collect, relay and route the stolen data.\n\nTargeted countries\n\n## Infection Chains\n\nThroughout our research, we witnessed several different infection chains being used to deliver\nthe Aria-body backdoor. Our investigation started when we observed a malicious email sent from\na government embassy in APAC to an Australian state government, named `The Indians`\n```\nWay.doc . This RTF file, which was infected (weaponized) with the RoyalRoad exploit builder,\n\n```\ndrops a loader named `intel.wll into the target PC’s Word startup folder. The loader in turn`\ntries to download and execute the next stage payload from `spool.jtjewifyn[.]com .`\n\nThis is not the first time we have encountered this version of the RoyalRoad malware which\ndrops a filename named `intel.wll – the Vicious Panda APT group, whose activities we`\n[reviewed in March 2020, utilizes a very similar variant.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall, during our investigation we observed several different infection methods:\n\nAn RTF file utilizing the RoyalRoad weaponizer.\nArchive files that contain a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL, to be used in a DLL\nhijacking technique, taking advantage of legitimate executables such as Outlook and\n**Avast proxy, to load a malicious DLL.**\nDirectly via an executable file, which serves as a loader.\n\n#### Infection chain examples\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nIn recent operations, the attackers used the same hosting and DNS services for most of their\nC&C servers: GoDaddy as the registrar and Alibaba for hosting the infrastructure. On several\noccasions, the attackers even reused the same IP address with more than one domain:\n\n\n-----\n\nMaltego – latest infrastructure overview\n\n[A full view of the entire infrastructure is available here.](https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/maltego_naikon-scaled.jpg)\n\nIn order to get a clearer picture of how the attackers operated their infrastructure throughout the\nyears, we have plotted the various malicious domains, according to the ASN they were hosted on,\nbased on periodic passive DNS information. The results are presented in the figure below:\n\nCorrelation between domains and ASNs over time\n\n**Observations:**\n\nSeveral domains were utilized for a very long time.\nMultiple domains jumped to the same new ASN within a short time frame.\nSince 2019, most of the infrastructure has been concentrated on ASN 45102 (Alibaba).\nIn some occasions, the attackers would change the IP address / server, on the same ASN\n(represented by two consecutive incidental ASN’s on the graph).\n\nIn addition, one of the more interesting infrastructure properties we observed, is the possible use\nof hacked government infrastructures as C&C servers. In one of the samples we analyzed,\n```\noutllib.dll ( 63d64cd53f6da3fd6c5065b2902a0162 ), there is a backup C&C server which\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nis configured as `202.90.141[.]25 – an IP which belongs to the Philippines department of`\n**_science and technology._**\n\n## Tool Analysis\n\nIn the following section, we will dive into the technical analysis of the Aria-body backdoor, utilized\nthroughout the observed activity, as well as an analysis of the loader executable that comes\nbefore it.\n\nUtilizing the loader at an early stage of an infection allows the attackers to establish a persistent\npresence on the target’s network, as well as perform basic reconnaissance, before using their\nmore advanced tools. While we observed Aria-body backdoor variants being compiled as early\nas 2018, we have observed Aria-body’s loaders going back to 2017.\n\n### Loader Analysis\n\nThe functionality of the Aria-body **loader has not changed significantly since 2017, but the**\nimplementation varied from version to version. This loader appears to be specifically created\n**for the Aria-body backdoor.**\n\nOverall, the loader is responsible for the following tasks:\n\n1. Establish persistence via the `Startup folder or the Run registry key (some variants).`\n2. Inject itself to another process such as `rundll32.exe and` `dllhost.exe (some`\n\nvariants).\n3. Decrypt two blobs: Import Table and the loader configuration.\n4. Utilize a DGA algorithm if required.\n5. Contact the embedded / calculated C&C address in order to retrieve the next stage\n\npayload.\n6. Decrypt the received payload DLL (Aria-body backdoor).\n7. Load and execute an exported function of the DLL – calculated using `djb2 hashing`\n\nalgorithm.\n\n\n-----\n\nMain logic of the loader – entering dga_method\n\nonly if dga_seed ≠ 0\n\n#### Loader: Configuration & DGA\n\nThe loader configuration comes encrypted and contains the following information: C&C domain,\nport, user-agent and a seed for the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). In case seed is not\nzero, the loader uses a DGA method to generate its C&C domain, based on the seed and the\ncalendar day of the communication. The configuration of the loader is decrypted using the\nfollowing algorithm:\n\ndef decrypt_buf(buf):\n\nk = 8\n\nj = 5\n\nfor i in range(len(buf)):\n\nxor_byte = (k + j) % 0xff\n\nbuf[i] = buf[i] ^ xor_byte\n\nj = k\n\nk = xor_byte\n\nConfiguration decryption algorithm\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DGA method is fully described in Appendix B.\n\n#### Loader: C&C Communication\n\nAfter getting the C&C domain, the loader contacts it to download the next and final stage of the\ninfection chain. Although it sounds simple, the attackers operate the C&C server in a limited daily\nwindow, going online only for a few hours each day, making it harder to gain access to the\nadvanced parts of the infection chain.\n\n#### Loader: Next stage payload\n\nAt the next and final stage of the loader, the downloaded RAT is decrypted using a single byte\nXOR key, received from the C&C. Once the RAT’s DLL is downloaded and decrypted, the DLL is\nloaded into the memory. The loader will then check the exported function against a hardcoded\n```\ndjb2 hash value, and will call it upon a match.\n\n### Aria-body RAT analysis\n\n```\nThe downloaded payload is a custom RAT dubbed Aria-body, based on the name given by the\nauthors: `aria-body-dllX86.dll .`\nAlthough the below analysis is of the 32bit variant malware, we have observed a 64bit variant as\nwell, with similar functionality.\n\nStrings found inside the “Aria-body” backdoor\n\nThe RAT includes rather common capabilities of a backdoor, including:\n\nCreate/Delete Files/Directories\nTake a screenshot\nSearch file\nLaunch files using `ShellExecute`\nEnumerate process loaded modules\nGather files’ metadata\nGather TCP and UDP table status listing\nClose a TCP session\nCollect OS information\nVerify location using `checkip.amazonaws.com`\n(Optional) Inter-process pipe based communication\n\nSome of Aria-body variations also included other modules such as:\n\n\n-----\n\nUSB data gathering module\nKeylogger module to collect raw input device-based keystrokes – added by February 2018\nReverse socks proxy module – added by February 2018\nLoading extensions module – added by December 2019\n\nAll the supported functionality of the backdoor is described in the table of Appendix A.\n\n#### Unique Characteristics\n\nIn the following section, we go over some of the techniques by which the backdoor was\nimplemented, and highlight the characteristics that might help other researchers recognize this\nbackdoor and correlate it with other samples.\n\n##### Initialization\n\nAs previously mentioned, the backdoor contains an exported function, which the previous loader\ncalls after loading the payload into the memory. Upon executing the backdoor, it initializes a struct\nnamed `MyDerived and several structs used for HTTP and TCP connection.`\n\n##### Information Gathering\n\n**Aria-body starts with gathering data on the victim’s machine, including:**\nHost-name, computer-name, username, domain name, windows version, processor ~MHz,\nMachineGuid, 64bit or not, and public IP (using `checkip.amazonaws.com ).`\n\nAria-body using checkip.amazonaws.com service to get victim’s IP\n\n\n-----\n\nThis data is gathered into an information structure which the RAT zips with an 8 bytes random\ngenerated password, which is then XORed with one byte.\n\n##### C&C Communication\n\nThe communication to the C&C server is available by either HTTP or TCP protocols. The\nmalware decides which protocol to use by a flag in the configuration of the loader. The collected\ndata is sent to the C&C domain along with the XORed password, and the XOR key in the\nfollowing format:\n\nC&C communication structure\n\nWhether the message is sent by TCP or HTTP, the payload format is the same. However, when\nHTTP is selected, the following GET request format is used:\n\n```\nhttps://%s:%d/list.html?q=<random string>\n\n```\n\nAfter the initial request to the C&C server, the backdoor then keeps listening to additional\ncommands from the server. When a command is received, it is matched against a list of\ncommands, and executed accordingly. A full list of supported commands is available in Appendix\n**A.**\n\n### The Outlook DLL Variant\n\nDuring our research we have found another, quite a unique variant of Aria-body, uploaded to\nVirusTotal from the Philippines. This variant’s DLL was named `outllib.dll, and it was part of`\na RAR archive named `Office.rar . It utilized a DLL side-loading technique, abusing an old`\n**Outlook executable.**\n\nWhat was unusual in this variant was the fact that there has no loader as part of the infection\nchain, unlike all the other versions of Aria-body. As a result, it did not get any configuration from\nthe loader, and included hardcoded configuration within it.\n\nThe payload has two different C&C domains:\n```\n   blog.toptogear[.]com – which it gets by XORing an encrypted string with the byte\n   0x15 .\n   202.90.141[.]25 – an IP associated with a Philippine government website, which is\n\n```\nbeing used in case that the first C&C domain cannot be resolved.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis variant also has some extra features that the\nmain variant of Aria-body does not include, such as\na USB-monitor module. On the other hand, this\nvariant is missing the keylogger component and the\nreverse-socks module, observed with the main Aria**body variants. This evidence suggests that this is**\nan out of scope variant of the backdoor, tailored for\na specific operation.\n\nMoreover, we have seen that Aria-body’s main\nvariant has a version that was compiled sometime\nafter `outlib.dll variant was, and some strings`\nwithin this variant could suggest that it was a test\nvariant of this special version:\n\nFinally, this version of Aria-body includes the\nfollowing string:\n\nUsage of Philippines govt’ C&C server as\n\nbackup\n\n“TEST” string as part of the connection struct of\n\n“outllib.dll”\n```\nc:\\users\\bruce\\desktop\\20190813\\arn\\agents\\verinfo.h, with the “ar” in “arn” possibly\n\n```\nstanding for “Aria”.\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to attribute our campaign to the Naikon APT group using several similarities we\n[observed to the previously disclosed information about Naikon’s activity by Kaspersky in 2015: 1,](https://securelist.com/the-naikon-apt/69953/)\n[2. In this original operation, the Naikon APT group utilized a backdoor against different](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07205555/TheNaikonAPT-MsnMM1.pdf)\ngovernment institutions in APAC.\n\nGoing forward, we will refer to the backdoor analyzed by Kaspersky as XsFunction due to PDB\npath found in one of its samples:\n\n```\ng:\\MyProjects\\xsFunction\\Release\\DLL.pdb\n\n```\n\n**XsFunction is a full featured backdoor which supports 48 different commands. It allows the**\nattacker to gain full control on the victim computer, perform file and process operations, shell\ncommands execution, as well as to upload and download data and additional plugins.\n\nWe were able to find several similarities to previous operations (besides the obvious overlap in\ntargeting), as well as specific similarities to the XsFunction backdoor.\n\n#### String Similarity\n\n**Aria-body backdoor has several debug strings that describe the functionality of the malware.**\n\nSome of these exact debug strings, can also be found in the XsFunction backdoor:\n\nStrings found in Aria-body backdoor\n\nStrings found in XsFunction (d085ba82824c1e61e93e113a705b8e9a)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Hashing Function Similarity\n\nBoth XsFunction and Aria-body loaders utilize the same hashing algorithm `djb2 to find which`\nexported function should be run. In XsFunction the name of that function is `XS02 and in Aria-`\n**body it is** `AzManager .`\n\nXsFunction loader (Image by Kaspersky)\n\nAria-body loader\n\n#### Code Similarity\n\nSome functions in the Aria-body backdoor are identical to functions used in the old XsFunction\nbackdoor. One example is the function which gathers information about the installed software on\nthe PC:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Infrastructure overlap\n\nFour of our C&C servers shared IPs with `mopo3[.]net domain, this domain resolves to the`\nsame IP as the domain mentioned in Kaspersky’s report: `myanmartech.vicp[.]net .`\n\nMaltego – graph of infrastructure overlap\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this campaign, we uncovered the latest iteration of what seems to be a long-running Chinesebased operation against various government entities in APAC. This specific campaign leveraged\nboth common toolsets like RoyalRoad RTF weaponizer, as well as a specially crafted backdoor\nnamed Aria-body.\n\nWhile the Naikon APT group has kept under the radar for the past 5 years, it appears that they\nhave not been idle. In fact, quite the opposite. By utilizing new server infrastructure, everchanging loader variants, in-memory fileless loading, as well as a new backdoor – the Naikon\nAPT group was able to prevent analysts from tracing their activity back to them.\n\n**[Check Point SandBlast Agent protects against such APT attacks, and is capable of](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/advanced-endpoint-protection/)**\n**preventing them from the very first step.**\n\n### Appendix A: Aria-body – Supported Commands\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Command ID (Sent from C&C)\n\n\n##### Sub Command ID (Sent from C&C)\n\n\n##### Description Command
