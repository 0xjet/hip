It\n[targets computers that use Microsoft Windows, recruiting a network of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) [zombies for the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computer_science))\n[botnet. Torpig circumvents antivirus software through the use of rootkit technology and scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software)\nthe infected system for credentials, accounts and passwords as well as potentially allowing\nattackers full access to the computer. It is also purportedly capable of modifying data on the\n[computer, and can perform man-in-the-browser attacks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-browser)\n\nBy November 2008, it was estimated that Torpig had stolen the details of about 500,000\n[online bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_bank) [accounts and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_account) [credit and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card) [debit cards and was described as \"one of the most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card)\nadvanced pieces of crimeware ever created\".[1]\n\n## History\n\n\nTorpig reportedly began development in 2005, evolving from that point to more effectively\nevade detection by the host system and antivirus software.[2]\n\n[In early 2009, a team of security researchers from University of California, Santa Barbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara)\ntook control of the botnet for ten days. During that time, they extracted an unprecedented\n[amount (over 70 GB) of stolen data and redirected 1.2 million IPs on to their private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte)\ncommand and control server. The report[3] goes into great detail about how the botnet\noperates. During the UCSB research team's ten-day takeover of the botnet, Torpig was able\nto retrieve login information for 8,310 accounts at 410 different institutions, and 1,660 unique\ncredit and debit card numbers from victims in the U.S. (49%), Italy (12%), Spain (8%), and\n40 other countries, including cards from Visa (1,056), MasterCard (447), American Express\n(81), Maestro (36), and Discover (24).[4]\n\n\n## Operation\n\n[Initially, a great deal of Torpig's spread was attributable to phishing emails that tricked users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)\ninto installing the malicious software. More sophisticated delivery methods developed since\n[that time use malicious banner ads which take advantage of exploits found in outdated of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_banner)\n[versions of Java, or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_SE) [Adobe Acrobat Reader,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Acrobat_Reader) [Flash Player,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Player) [Shockwave Player. A type of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave_Player)\n[Drive-by download, this method typically does not require the user to click on the ad, and the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download)\ndownload may commence without any visible indications after the malicious ad recognizes\n\n\n-----\n\nthe old software version and redirects the browser to the Torpig download site. To complete\n[its installation into the infected computer's Master Boot Record (MBR), the trojan will restart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Boot_Record)\nthe computer.[2]\n\nDuring the main stage of the infection, the malware will upload information from the computer\ntwenty minutes at a time, including financial data like credit card numbers and credentials for\n[banking accounts, as well as e-mail accounts, Windows passwords, FTP credentials, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol)\n[POP/SMTP accounts.[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol)\n\n## See also\n\n References\n\n\n1. ^ [BBC News: Trojan virus steals bank info](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7701227.stm)\n2. ^ a b _Carnegie Mellon University._ _[\"Torpig\".
