Chen (Threat Researchers)_**\n\nWe recently discovered a new campaign that we dubbed “Operation Overtrap” for the numerous ways it can infect or trap\nvictims with its payload. The campaign mainly targets online users of various Japanese banks by stealing their banking\ncredentials using a three-pronged attack. Based on our telemetry, Operation Overtrap has been active since April 2019 and has\nbeen solely targeting online banking users located in Japan. Our analysis found that this campaign uses three different attack\nvectors to steal its victims’ banking credentials:\n\nBy sending spam emails with a phishing link to a page disguised as a banking website\nBy sending spam emails asking victims to run a disguised malware’s executable downloaded from a linked phishing\npage.\nBy using a custom exploit kit to deliver malware via malvertising\n\n\nGo to…\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Operation Overtrap three-pronged attack flow\n\nThis blog will discuss how we discovered the campaign and introduce the brand-new banking trojan Cinobi. Meanwhile, a\ndetailed look at the different attack vectors associated with this campaign, and a more in-depth analysis of dropped\nconfiguration files as well as Cinobi’s features, are discussed in our [technical brief.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/Tech%20Brief_Operation%20Overtrap%20Targets%20Japanese%20Online%20Banking%20Users.pdf)\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n## Discovering Operation Overtrap\n\nWe first discovered the campaign in September 2019 using a then-unidentified exploit kit. Based on our data, Operation\nOvertrap has been using spam emails to deliver its payload to victims as early as April 2019.\n\nIn mid-September, we observed a significant number of victims being redirected to the exploit kit, which targeted Internet\nExplorer, after they have clicked on links from social media platforms. It should be noted, however, that the way the victims\nreceived the links has not been identified. It is also worth mentioning that Operation Overtrap only seems to target Japanese\nonline banking users; it redirects victims with other geolocations to a fake online shop.\n\nUpon analysis, we saw that the exploit kit only dropped a clean binary that does not perform malicious activities on a victim’s\ndevice. It also immediately closes after infection. It is still unclear why the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap initially\ndelivered a clean binary file; it’s possible that they were testing their custom exploit kit during this stage of the campaign’s\ndevelopment.\n\nFigure 2. A screengrab that shows exploit kit network traffic in September 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. A screengrab that shows a clean file dropped by Operation Overtrap’s exploit kit\n\n## Operation Overtrap’s Custom Exploit Kit: Bottle Exploit Kit\n\nOn September 29, 2019, we observed that the exploit kit ceased to drop a clean file, and instead, delivered a brand-new\nbanking trojan that we dubbed “Cinobi.” We also noted that the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap have stopped\nredirecting victims from social media and began to use a Japan-targeted malvertising campaign to push their custom exploit\nkit.\n\nAnother researcher later discovered the custom exploit kit, which was named the [Bottle Exploit Kit (BottleEK). It exploits](https://nao-sec.org/2019/12/say-hello-to-bottle-exploit-kit.html)\n[CVE-2018-15982, a Flash Player use after free vulnerability, as well as](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15982) [CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript remote code execution](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8174)\nvulnerability. Victims will be infected with BottleEK’s payload if they access this particular exploit kit’s landing page with\nunpatched or outdated browsers. Our telemetry shows that BottleEK was the most active exploit kit detected in Japan in\nFebruary 2020.\n\nFigure 4. Exploit kit activity observed in Japan on February 2020 (Data obtained from Trend Micro Smart Protection\n\nNetwork™)\n\n## Brand-new banking malware: Cinobi\n\nOperation Overtrap used a new banking malware we’ve decided to call Cinobi. Based on our analysis, Cinobi has two versions\n— the first one has a DLL library injection payload that compromises victims’ web browsers to perform form-grabbing.\n\nThis Cinobi version can also modify web traffic sent to and received from targeted websites. Our investigation found that all\nthe websites that this campaign targeted were those of Japan-based banks.\n\nAside from form-grabbing, it also has a webinject function that allows cybercriminals to modify accessed webpages. The\nsecond version has all the capabilities of the first one plus the ability to communicate with a command-and-control (C&C)\nserver over the Tor proxy.\n\n\n-----\n\nEach of Cinobi’s four stages contains an encrypted position-independent shellcode that makes analysis slightly more\ncomplicated. Each stage is downloaded from a C&C server after certain conditions have been met.\n\n#### First stage\n\nThe first stage of Cinobi’s infection chain, which has also been [analyzed by another cybersecurity researcher, starts by calling](http://www.pwncode.io/2019/12/unpacking-payload-used-in-bottle-ek.html)\n[the “GetUserDefaultUILanguages” function to check if the infected device’s local settings are set to Japanese.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getuserdefaultuilanguage)\n\nFigure 5. Screengrab of Cinobi’s check to determine the device’s language settings using “GetUserDefaultUILanguages”\n\nCinobi will then download legitimate unzip.exe and Tor applications from the following locations:\n\nftp://ftp[.]cadwork.ch/DVD_V20/cadwork.dir/COM/unzip[.]exe\nhttps://archive[.]torproject[.]org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/8.0.8/tor-win32-0.3.5.8[.]zip\n\nAfter extracting the Tor archive into the “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” directory, Cinobi will rename tor.exe to taskhost.exe and\nexecute it. It will also run tor.exe with custom torrc file settings.\n\n“C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\LocalLow\\<random_name>\\Tor\\taskhost.exe” –f\n“C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\LocalLow\\<random_name>\\torrc”\n\nIt will download the second stage of the malware payload from a .onion C&C address and save it in a randomly named .DLL\nfile within the “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” folder. The filename of the first stage downloader is saved into a .JPG file with a random\nname.\n\nFigure 6. Screengrab of the .JPG file that contains the filename of the first stage downloader\n\nAfter this, Cinobi will run the second stage of its downloader on the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 7. Screengrab of code showing Cinobi running the second stage of its downloader on the victim’s machine\n\n#### Second stage\n\nCinobi will connect to its C&C server to download and decrypt the file for the third stage of its infection chain. We observed\nthat the filename of the third stage starts with the letter C, followed by random characters. Afterward, it will download and\ndecrypt the file for the fourth stage, which has a filename that starts with the letter A, followed by random characters.\n\nAfter these, Cinobi will download and decrypt a config file (<random_name>.txt) that contains a new C&C address.\n\nCinobi uses RC4 encryption with a hardcoded key.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, Cinobi will run the downloaded third stage infection file using the UAC bypass method via the CMSTPLUA COM\ninterface.\n\n#### Third stage\n\nDuring the third infection stage, Cinobi will copy malware files from “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” to the “%PUBLIC%” folder. It\nwill then install the fourth stage of the downloader (which was downloaded during the second stage) as Winsock Layered\n[Service Provider (WSCInstallProviderAndChains).](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscinstallproviderandchains)\n\nFigure 9. Screengrab of code showing the installation of the infection’s fourth stage on the victim machine as\n\n“WSCInstallProviderAndChains”\n\nCinobi will then perform the following actions:\n\nChange spooler service config to “SERVICE_AUTO_START”\nDisable the following services:\n\nUsoSvc\nWuauserv\nWaaSMedicSvc\nSecurityHealthService\nDisableAntiSpyware\nCopy and extract Tor files to “%PUBLIC%” folder\nRename tor.exe to taskhost.exe\nCreate torrc in “%PUBLIC%” with the content “DataDirectory C:\\Users\\Public\\<random_nam>\\data\\tor”\nCreate .JPG file with the original dropper name\nRemove files from “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\,” remove original dropper file\n\n#### Fourth stage\n\nCinobi will call the **[WSCEnumProtocols function to retrieve information about available transport protocols. It will also call](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscenumprotocols)**\nthe **[WSCGetProviderPath function to retrieve the DLL path of the original transport provider. This function is called twice.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscgetproviderpath)**\nThe first call will return the malicious provider (as the fourth stage of the malware has already been installed during the third\nstage of infection). The second call will return the original transport provider (“%SystemRoot%\\system32\\mswsock.dll”) and\nresolve and call its [WSPStartup function. Cinobi will then check the name of the process in which the malicious DLL provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wspstartup)\ngets injected. In practice, Cinobi should be injected into all processes that make network connections using [Windows sockets.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-start-page-2)\n\nFigure 10. Screengrab of processes where the malicious DLL provider has been injected\n\n# Best practices against spam and vulnerabilities\n\nOperation Overtrap uses a variety of attack vectors to steal banking credentials.
