With overall cyberattacks on the rise, even\nagriculture has found itself in the crosshairs of cyber threat actors. In fact, during the last ten\n[months alone, the CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatchTM](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-overwatch-threat-hunting/) team has observed a tenfold\nincrease in interactive, or hands-on-keyboard, intrusions impacting the agriculture industry.\n\nThis blog is the latest installment in a series exploring the types of malicious hands-onkeyboard activity discovered in specific industries by OverWatch threat hunters, who work\nwith organizations of all sizes – across all industries and in all timezones – to alert them to\nthese threats. With still over a month to go in 2020, the OverWatch team is on track to\nrecord double the number of targeted and interactive eCrime intrusions uncovered in 2019.\n\nPrevious blogs have focused on some of this year’s most frequently targeted industries such\nas [healthcare and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-threat-hunting-uncovers-covid-19-healthcare-attacks/) [manufacturing. In contrast, this blog takes a deep dive into the agriculture](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/adversaries-targeting-the-manufacturing-industry/)\nsector, a less commonly impacted industry that has nonetheless experienced a dramatic\nacceleration of intrusion activity in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_For insights into how other industry verticals are faring this year, check out the_ _2020_\n_OverWatch Threat Hunting Report._\n\n## Why Agriculture and Why Now?\n\nThe digital transformation of the agriculture sector is expanding it from the physical world into\nthe cyber realm. While the adoption of internet of things (IoT) and smart technologies opens\nthe door to innovation and new efficiencies, it also exposes the sector to new cyber threats.\neCrime operations are perpetually looking for new victims, especially among those larger\nbusinesses perceived to have a high capacity to pay. At the other end of the spectrum,\nsmaller agricultural companies may be seen as soft targets, particularly those in the early\nstages of digitizing their businesses with less mature security infrastructure and processes.\nIn addition, state economic interests are contributing to a heightened interest in the sector,\nincreasing the likelihood of targeted intrusion activity. To a lesser extent, opportunistic\n[hacktivism also presents a risk. It is crucial that defenders in the agriculture sector are aware](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/hacktivism/)\nof the complex global threat landscape that exists for this industry, and are familiar with realworld examples of how adversary activity could play out in their environment.\n\n### eCrime Threat\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed with a high\ndegree of confidence that eCrime activity is currently\nthe most likely cyberthreat to the agriculture industry.\nThis is supported by OverWatch findings — nearly 80%\nof interactive intrusions in the agriculture industry in\n2020 were perpetrated by suspected eCrime\nadversaries (of those intrusions where attribution was\npossible).\n\nLarge agriculture sector businesses may be viewed as\na valuable target by eCrime adversaries. In “big game\nhunting” (BGH) ransomware campaigns, adversaries\nwill adjust their ransom demands based on a company’s size and perceived capacity to pay,\noften resulting in ransoms in the millions of dollars. Organizations should also be aware that\nthe use of data extortion is increasing among BGH adversaries. Adversaries use this\nstrategy to increase the likelihood that even those companies with effective data-backup\nsystems can be pressured to pay ransoms to protect sensitive data from being leaked.\n\nThe proliferation of these data encryption and extortion activities has prompted a wide variety\nof government policy interventions aimed at both crime prevention and consumer protection.\nThe onus is on organizations to not only ensure adequate security\n\nprotections are in place, but to also be aware of any regional regulatory obligations that\nrelate to protection of data and dealings with criminal entities.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targeted Threat\n\nThe agricultural industry is at risk of economically\nmotivated targeted intrusions seeking intellectual\nproperty or other sensitive business information. More\nextreme weather patterns, water scarcity and\ndiminishing availability of productive\n\nland haveencouraged innovation in agricultural\nprocesses, tools and crop varieties. This intellectual\nproperty is a valuable target for countries seeking to\ngrow their agricultural outputs and boost their\ncompetitive advantage relative to regional neighbors. In\nparticular, CrowdStrike Intelligence has highlighted\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)-nexus\nand China-nexus adversaries as the leading threats.\nThis is again consistent with OverWatch threat hunting data, which has uncovered both\nDPRK- and China-nexus actors involved in intrusions against the agriculture sector in 2020.\nThe following table summarizes likely motivations and adversary groups involved in these\n[espionage activities.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/cyber-espionage/)\n\n\n### Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea)\n\n\n### China\n\n\n-----\n\nSelf-sufficiency is a core tenet of the DPRK’s\nunderlying political philosophy, and agricultural\nindependence is seen as a key enabling factor for\nthe country’s growth. Despite the DPRK’s long-held\nambitions to achieve agricultural self-sufficiency,\nefforts to modernize and expand the sector have\nfaced repeated setbacks. These include a lack of\narable land, widespread natural disasters and\nlimited access to many crucial agricultural inputs\ndue to DPRK’s government-controlled economy.\nIn this context, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses\nthat proprietary information related to agricultural\nproduction would likely be a significant asset to the\nDPRK’s agricultural programs. Two DPRK-nexus\ntargeted intrusion adversary groups associated with\nagricultural sector targeting — LABYRINTH\nCHOLLIMA and SILENT CHOLLIMA — are\nassessed to conduct espionage operations in\nsupport of the DPRK’s Reconnaissance General\nBureau (RGB) Bureau 121, which could support the\ncountry’s agricultural development goals.\n\n### Hacktivist Threat\n\n\nChina is the world’s largest\nagricultural producing nation,\ndespite a limited amount of arable\nland relative to the country’s size.\nThe sector accounts for\napproximately 10% of China’s total\ngross domestic product (GDP) and\nemploys more than a quarter of the\ncountry’s workforce. For these\nreasons, the agricultural sector is\ninexorably tied to Chinese\neconomic growth.\nChina-nexus adversary groups\nengage in aggressive economic\nespionage campaigns to forcibly\ntransfer proprietary technology and\nintellectual property from advanced\nindustrial nations, with the goal of\nspurring economic development.\n\nMany of these campaigns have\ntargeted the 10 industrial areas\nhighlighted in Beijing’s “Made in\nChina 2025 Plan,” which includes\nagricultural machinery.\n\nThe China-nexus adversary\nWICKED PANDA is known to target\nthe agricultural sector for likely\neconomic espionage goals.\n\n\nFinally, agriculture is a sector that attracts attention from\na diverse range of interest groups, among them animal\nrights and environmental protection activists. While the\nthreat level is perceived to be low, organizations in this\nindustry should remain alert to the possibility of\nopportunistic hacktivist activity.\n\n## Follow the Hunt\n\n\n-----\n\nThe intrusion story below explores an incident involving a CrowdStrike Falcon® platform\ncustomer in the agriculture sector that did not have Falcon deployed to all workloads in its\nnetwork. One of the unmonitored hosts, not covered by Falcon, became the weak point in\nthe business’s cyber defenses. This single host became a beachhead from which an eCrime\n[adversary was able to achieve lateral movement and commence credential harvesting](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/lateral-movement/)\nactivities. CrowdStrike strongly recommends customers deploy full sensor coverage across\ntheir environment to ensure that there are no weak points in their defense. This case study\nshows how quickly an eCrime adversary can navigate a victim’s environment once they have\nmanaged to gain access. It also details how OverWatch threat hunters acted equally rapidly\nto find the intrusion and enable this agricultural business to eradicate the adversary from\ntheir environment, despite only having limited visibility within the network environment.\n\n### Threat Hunting Enables Timely Pest Control Against SPIDER Adversary\n\nRecently, Falcon OverWatch discovered a suspected interactive SPIDER (aka eCrime)\nintrusion against a large agriculture company. In the early morning, outside of the customer’s\nnormal operating hours, OverWatch hunters uncovered suspicious discovery commands\nbeing executed on a Windows host under a process that was unique in the customer’s\nenvironment. OverWatch regularly uses telemetry from across the global Falcon install base\nto rapidly identify activity that is anomalous and worthy of further investigation. In this\ninstance, the unique binary was:\n\n```\nFILE: C:\\Windows\\IntelliAdminRPC\\RemoteExecute.exe\n\n```\n```\nHASH: aa63dfec54e9bdf529fdad1fe47eee45391a99b007878abf56a490b023e6b245\n\n```\n\nThis binary is associated with commercially available remote administration software.\nHowever, the hunters recognized it as only present on this one host within this customer’s\nnetwork environment, along with suspicious commands spawned from it, so they continued\nhunting further.\n\nWithin the first three minutes of establishing a presence on the host, the adversary executed\nseveral basic initial reconnaissance commands using the `RemoteExecute.exe process:`\n\n```\nver\n\n```\n```\nsysteminfo\n\n```\n```\nnet group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" /domain\n\n```\n```\nnetstat -ano -p tcp\n\n```\n\nOverWatch threat hunters immediately notified the victim of the suspicious activity before\ncommencing a more detailed investigation into the source of the intrusion.\n\n**Retracing the Adversary’s Steps**\n\n\n-----\n\nOverWatch found that the `RemoteExecute.exe binary was written to the victim host by`\nanother host within the network’s VPN range. That other host did not have the Falcon sensor\ninstalled, which meant that OverWatch did not have visibility to identify the intrusion at initial\naccess. This allowed the adversary to establish an internal beachhead from which they\nexecuted their commands remotely.\n\nFigure 1. Intrusion sequence showing the adversary’s movement between hosts (click image to enlarge)\n\nFive minutes after gaining access to the host OverWatch could see, the adversary modified\nthe registry to implement a widely known procedure that enables credentials to be stored in\nclear text within memory, facilitating credential theft:\n```\nreg add hklm\\system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\securityproviders\\wdigest /v\nUseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /F\n\n```\nRoughly 15 minutes later, after running additional basic host and network discovery\ncommands, the adversary ran the following command:\n```\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c rundll32 C:\\windows\\system32\\comsvcs.dll,\nMiniDump 576 c:\\windows\\temp\\TMPdx12.dmp full\n\n```\nThis is an example of a known technique for creating a minidump of the LSASS process to\nextract credentials without using Mimikatz. In this particular method, the adversary abused\nthe Windows native `comsvcs.dll dynamic link library (DLL), executing the binary via`\n```\nrundll32.exe to perform the credential dumping. This binary is generally associated with\n\n```\nlegitimate Windows COM+ Services. Thanks to the Falcon sensor’s defenses, the credential\ndumping attempt did not succeed.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the adversary executed the script `%SYSTEMROOT%\\IntelliAdminRPC\\inst.bat,`\nwhich resulted in a series of commands consistent with those within a publicly shared\nregistry file. In doing so, the adversary implemented a form of Component Object Model\n(COM) hijacking in an attempt to create persistence and execute their tooling without\ndetection. The adversary next attempted to finalize persistence by registering a scheduled\ntask masquerading as “GoogleUpdates” in order to spawn their backdoor every 30 minutes:\n```\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c cmd /c schtasks /create /F /SC minute /MO\n30 /TN \"\\UpdateTasks\\GoogleUpdates\" /TR \"rundll32 /sta {[CLSID for Hijacked\nCOM Object]}\"\n\n```\nIt is unclear if the adversary’s `inst.bat script functioned as intended, as they proceeded`\nto run it multiple times over the course of the next hour. This activity took place concurrently\nwith further account, host and network discovery.\n\nDuring that time period, the adversary also attempted to save the SAM and SYSTEM registry\nhives for attempted credential access and created a new user account with a password set\nto not expire. Next, they executed the following commands to employ further variations of\nattempted credential dumping, but Falcon blocked these efforts as well:\n```\npowershell -ep bypass \"Import-Module\nc:\\windows\\system32\\catroot\\mini.ps1;Get-Process lsass | Out-Minidump\"\n\n```\n(Likely the PowerSploit Minidump script)\n\n```\nprocdump64.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe dmp.se.dmp\n\n```\n\nThreat hunting ensured the timely discovery and disruption of this eCrime intrusion.\nOverWatch tracked the adversary from the initial attempt to access a Falcon-protected\nendpoint until the customer used the Falcon platform to isolate the victim host, containing the\nintrusion and avoiding a potential breach. After the immediate threat was addressed,\nOverWatch reviewed all related malicious activity in detail. Hunters used this information to\nhone their preparation for this adversary by identifying features of these malicious actions\nthat will inform future threat hunting efforts. Feeding key observations like this into future\nhunting leads is an essential part of the iterative threat hunting process, as described in a\n[blog outlining the OverWatch SEARCH hunting methodology.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/successful-threat-hunting-starts-with-search/)\n\nThis incident also serves as an important reminder of the very real threat that eCrime poses\nto the agriculture sector. This is particularly true in the context of the sudden and\nunprecedented spike in intrusion activity that OverWatch has recorded in this sector in recent\nmonths. Businesses that have until now considered themselves an unlikely target for\ninteractive threats should take notice of the shifting cyber landscape. Now is the time to look\nat measures to mature security posture preemptively.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this attack could have been opportunistic rather than specifically focusing on an\nagriculture target, it is at least indicative of the threats agriculture organizations face. For\nanother case study of how OverWatch threat hunting uncovered and stopped an interactive\nintrusion against a global agriculture company, be sure to check out the 2020 OverWatch\nThreat Hunting Report. The story Hunting Thwarts LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Attack\n_Launched Over Social Media walks through an intrusion perpetrated by a state-sponsored_\nadversary.\n\n## Security Recommendations\n\n### Threat Hunting\n\nThe eCrime intrusion chronicled in this blog demonstrates the critical importance of threat\nhunting supported by comprehensive visibility across the environment at all hours of the day.\nIn this case, the lack of OverWatch visibility into the initially compromised host enabled the\nadversary to establish a beachhead on this unmonitored part of the network. Yet despite\nhaving gained access to the network through the customer’s VPN pool, proactive threat\nhunting was there to catch them as soon as they tried to perform actions on endpoints\ncovered by Falcon. Further, despite this intrusion taking place in the early morning, the\nOverwatch team’s continuous hunting meant that the breach was rapidly discovered and\nreported, so the victim could disrupt the adversary and stop the breach before further\nimpact.\n\n[We strongly recommend that defenders implement proactive threat hunting as part of](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/threat-hunting/)\ntheir defense-in-depth strategy, to support the timely discovery and disruption of\nadversary tradecraft designed to evade detection by systems built on technology\nalone.\nOrganizations should also deploy capabilities that provide their threat hunters with full\nvisibility across the entire network’s workloads to avoid blind spots that can become a\nsafe haven for adversaries.\nFinally, it is crucial that organizations employ continuous threat hunting. The longer an\nadversary has access to your network, the greater the risk of serious impact to your\noperations. OverWatch’s 24/7/365 hunting ensures that adversaries have nowhere to\nhide, even when your staff is off the clock.\n\n### Security Hygiene\n\n[It is crucial to plug gaps in your defenses. OverWatch routinely sees adversaries finding and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-discover-network-security-monitoring/)\nexploiting the weakest point of entry. All too often, that point of weakness is an organization’s\nVPN or another remote access setup, but it can also be an unpatched vulnerability or simply\nthe part of a victim’s environment without Falcon sensor coverage.\n\n\n-----\n\nDefenders should regularly monitor VPN and other remote access account behavior to\nidentify anomalous behavior, particularly given the increase in remote work many\norganizations have implemented due to COVID-19.\n\n### Know Your Adversary\n\nThe best defenses are always built on the latest and most comprehensive cyber threat\nintelligence. OverWatch threat hunters and Crowdstrike Intelligence work hand-in-hand to\ncontinually feed the threat intelligence lifecycle, allowing you to stay one step ahead of the\nadversary.\n\nDefenders in all settings should develop a deep understanding of the threat landscape\nfor their organization. Staying up-to-date with key adversaries, their motivations, and\ntheir tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) will support data-backed, proactive\nsecurity decisions.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Download the 2020 OverWatch Threat Hunting Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report-2020/)_\n_[Register for the webcast to hear CrowdStrike threat hunting experts discuss report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/crowdcasts/threat-hunting-report-insights-2020/)_\n_findings._\n_Visit the_ _[CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-overwatch-threat-hunting/)_\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n_[Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself.
