The campaign we discovered\nshowcases [​a clear use of Lazarus TTPs​ to target cryptocurrency exchanges and social](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/)\ninstitutions in South Korea.\n\nThis campaign leveraged four different lures and targeted Korean-speaking users of the\nHangul Word Processor (.hwp file extension), a Korean-language word processing program\nutilized widely in South Korea. North Korean state-sponsored actors have used [​Hangul](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/blog/threat-research/FireEye_HWP_ZeroDay.pdf)\n[exploits​ (CVE-2015-6585) and malicious .hwp files in the past, including during a](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/blog/threat-research/FireEye_HWP_ZeroDay.pdf) [​phishing](https://www.cyberscoop.com/wannacry-ransomware-intel-471-north-korea-south-korea/)\n[campaign in early 2017​, to target South Korean users.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/wannacry-ransomware-intel-471-north-korea-south-korea/)\n\nBeyond Korean-speaking HWP users, targets of this campaign appear to be users of the\n[Coinlink ​cryptocurrency exchange, South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges at large (or at](https://coinlink.co.kr/)\nleast those that are hiring), and a group called “Friends of MOFA” (Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs), which is a group of college students from around South Korea with [​“a keen interest](http://www.publicnow.com/view/6D2727CED612EC4814FE54E909DC7D731155B92E?2017-09-06-10:00:10+01:00-xxx8116)\n[in foreign affairs.”](http://www.publicnow.com/view/6D2727CED612EC4814FE54E909DC7D731155B92E?2017-09-06-10:00:10+01:00-xxx8116)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n_[Payload shows two prompts from ​coinlink.co.kr, the first tells the user their password is incorrect, the second asks for ​](https://coinlink.co.kr/)_\n_their email address._\n\nThe first cryptocurrency-focused lure appears designed to obtain the emails and\npasswords of users of [​Coinlink​, a cryptocurrency exchange run by the South Korean](https://coinlink.co.kr/)\nelectronic stock exchange [​KOSDAQ​.](http://www.kosdaqca.or.kr/)\n\nThe second and third appear to be resumes stolen from two actual South Korean computer\nscientists, both with work experience at South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe fourth document was lifted from a blog run by the South Korean group “Friends of\nMOFA” detailing a Korean Day celebration in late September 2017 during which [​President](http://m.yna.co.kr/kr/contents/?cid=AKR20170927061900001)\n[Moon Jae-in spoke​ about the importance of the Korean diaspora and the upcoming](http://m.yna.co.kr/kr/contents/?cid=AKR20170927061900001) [​Winter](https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/index)\n[Olympics in Pyeongchang​.](https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/index)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n_This document is from a blog post from the “Friends of MOFA” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) detailing a Korean Day_\n_celebration attended by President Moon Jae-in. 1_\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\n[This campaign relies on a known Ghostscript exploit (​CVE-2017-8291​) that can be triggered](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/48vGJPkGX3ZG)\nfrom within an embedded PostScript in a Hangul Word Processor document.\n\n1 Note: All Korean language translations provided by Gerald Kim.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n_[Timeline​ of CVE-2017-8291 exploitation.](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/dGkLmo2OGbMq)_\n\n_Screenshot of the function names utilized in the PostScript._\n\nOur initial finding focused on “로그인 오류.hwp“ or “Korean Day” lure, but once we created a\nsignature for the particular implementation of the PostScript, we found three additional\nlure documents in a public malware repository tied together by the use of this exploit: two\nCVs and a cryptocurrency exchange-themed lure. All were created in the span of a month\nfrom mid-October to late November. Despite a nearly identical delivery mechanism (with\nthe exception of altered 4-byte XOR keys), the payloads (when recoverable) were different\nin each case.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n  - It’s worth noting that the function names used in the PostScript are transliterated\nChinese words. While “yima” (decode) and “yaoshi” (key) appear appropriate in their\nfunctional context, the word “yinzi” (factor/money) does not. The latter may be\nobscure technical slang or be a misuse signifying a potential false flag.\n\nThis would not be the first time the Lazarus Group used foreign-language terms to\nmisdirect attribution efforts; [​BAE researchers discovered​ transliterated Russian terms in](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/02/lazarus-false-flag-malware.html)\nprevious Lazarus operations. However, an alternate explanation may point to a Chinese\nexploit supplier or the language competency of the developer.\n\nThe attack chain occurs in multiple stages with the PostScript deobfuscating a first stage\nshellcode that’s been XORed with a hardcoded four-byte key. The shellcode in turn triggers\nthe GhostScript vulnerability in order to execute an embedded DLL that has also been\nXORed. A [​PwnCode.Club​ blogpost details the deobfuscation of the shellcode and loading of](http://www.pwncode.club/2017/10/targeted-attack-on-south-korea-exploits.html)\nthe DLL into memory.\n\n[Lazarus malware families (like Hangman (​Intel Card​), Duuzer (​Intel Card​), Volgmer (Intel​](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/7sEvori0kQwF)\n[Card​), SpaSpe (​Intel Card​), etc.) overlap, likely as the result of the developers](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/1KsNpqaEhXIk#/?sc=k31dAqmAwboFwuP)\ncutting-and-splicing an extensive codebase of malicious functionality to generate payloads\nas needed. This erratic composition make the Lazarus intrusion malware [​difficult to identify](https://securelist.com/operation-blockbuster-revealed/73914/)\n[and group or cluster​, unless they are analyzed at the level of code similarity.](https://securelist.com/operation-blockbuster-revealed/73914/)\n\nUpon deobfuscating the payloads, we found 32-bit DLLs built in part on the Destover\n[malware (​Intel Card​) code. Destover has been used in a number of North Korea-attributed](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/7pOtBabQCMdD)\noperations: most infamously against [​Sony Pictures Entertainment​ in 2014, the](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/) [​Polish](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-target-dozens-global-banks-new-malware-0)\n[banking attacks​ in January 2017, and the](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-target-dozens-global-banks-new-malware-0) [​first WannaCry victim​ in February 2017.](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group?source=techstories.org)\n\nThis campaign relies on multiple payloads fashioned out of the Destover infostealer code\nto collect information about the victim system and exfiltrate files. Each payload contains an\nembedded 64-bit version of itself. The payloads accompanying the newer cryptocurrency\nexchange-themed lure docs compiled a month after the Korean Day payload further\nobfuscate their functionality by resolving imports at runtime.\n\nThis type of obfuscation is common in the Lazarus Hangman malware family. They also rely\nentirely on IPs (rather than domains) for their command-and-control infrastructure, a tactic\nlikely borne of the use of hacked servers for infrastructure.\n\nOutlook\n\nThis late 2017 campaign is a continuation of North Korea’s interest in cryptocurrency, which\nwe now know encompasses a broad range of activities including mining, ransomware, and\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\noutright theft. Outside of the May WannaCry attack, the majority of North Korean\ncryptocurrency operations have targeted South Korean users and exchanges, but we\nexpect this trend to change in 2018. We assess that as South Korea responds to these\nattempted thefts by increasing security (and [​possibly banning cryptocurrency trading​) they](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-southkorea-bitcoin/south-korea-plans-to-ban-cryptocurrency-trading-rattles-market-idUSKBN1F002A)\nwill become harder targets, forcing North Korean actors to look to exchanges and users in\nother countries as well.\n\nFurther, while this campaign and toolset are specific to the Hangul Word Processor, the\n[vulnerability it exploited (​CVE-2017-8291​) is not.
