Most victims are in the Middle East, US and the UK. Below here is a key event timeline:\n\n  - **In 2015 ClearSky discovered the first wave of phishing attacks and issued a report reviewing**\n\ntheir activity named \"Thamar reservoir\"[2].\n\n  - **In 2017 ClearSky exposed a vast espionage operation, active from 2016 to 2017, against the**\n\naforementioned sectors. Our report uncovered incidents of corporate impersonation, fake\n\norganizations and individuals, spear phishing and watering hole attacks.\n\n  - **In 2018, Charming Kitten attempted to attack ClearSky and our customers directly via a**\n\nfraudulent website impersonating the ClearSky portal[3].\n\nLater that year we also identified new wave of attacks against researchers in the Middle\n\nEast, using fake emails and look-alike websites.\n\n  - **In 2019 ClearSky observed a sharp increase in Charming Kitten attacks. It appears that group**\n\nhas initiated a new cyber espionage campaign comprised of two stages, pointing at two\n\ndifferent targets:\n\n`o` Non-Iranian Researchers from the US, Middle East and France, focusing on academic\n\nresearch of Iran.\n\n`o` Iranian dissidents in the US.\n\nDespite the considerable unrest in the Iranian cyber sphere, it appears that similarly to the\n\nMuddyWater APT, Charming Kitten were unaffected[4].\n\nIn August, the campaign has progressed, and unlike July, it seems like the APT group is now expanding\n\nits activities toward influential public figures around the world, rather than academic researchers an\n\nstate organizations. Additionally, in August 2019, we found that the group had begun adding a tracker\n\nto their email correspondences, enabling them to follow an email message forwarded to additional\n\naccounts and obtain geolocation information.\n\n1 [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0058/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0058/)\n2 clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/thamar-reservoir-public/\n\n3 [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-apt-poses-as-israeli-cyber-security-firm-that-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-apt-poses-as-israeli-cyber-security-firm-that-exposed-its-operations/)\n[exposed-its-operations/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-apt-poses-as-israeli-cyber-security-firm-that-exposed-its-operations/)\n\n4 [https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clearsky-Iranian-APT-group-](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clearsky-Iranian-APT-group-%E2%80%98MuddyWater%E2%80%99-Adds-Exploits-to-Their-Arsenal.pdf)\n[%E2%80%98MuddyWater%E2%80%99-Adds-Exploits-to-Their-Arsenal.pdf](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clearsky-Iranian-APT-group-%E2%80%98MuddyWater%E2%80%99-Adds-Exploits-to-Their-Arsenal.pdf)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Attack Vector\n\n1. The first stage is sending an email message leveraging social engineering methods. The\n\nhacker impersonates a well-known researcher or journalist and invites the recipients to an\n\nevent allegedly organized by the impersonated subject. Note that in certain cases, the\n\nhackers use their targets’ language.\n\n2. The second stage includes a decoy website impersonating various Google services such as\n\nGmail or Google Drive, to which the victim is redirected from the phishing email. This vector\n\nwas observed in prior campaigns as well. Please note that in late March 2019, Microsoft filed\n\nan official complaint against the group for “establishing an internet-based cyber theft\n\noperation referred to as 'Phosphorus'.\".[5]\n\n3. Moreover, we identified a new vector of phishing websites that is used by this group –\n\nimpersonating the Instagram official website. This is the first time we observed an attempt to\n\nextract credentials of non-google services.\n\n##### Emails sent to victims\n\nAnalyzing this campaign, we identified two attack scenarios. Based on our investigation, Charming\n\nKitten tried to carry out both of the attack scenarios against the same victims. Note however that in\n\nmost cases, the attack begun with the first scenario.\n\n###### First set of Emails \n\nWhile impersonating to research institution, the attackers try to contact the victims privately and\n\nencourage them to review their resume (CV). In order to do so, linked within the email is a unique URL\n\naddress for the fake website (Please notice the spelling and grammatical error, most notably the\n\nmispronunciation of the Sender name. Instead of Andrea, as written in the email address, the attacker\n\nmistakenly wrote Andera):\n\nAs this link is not malicious, we believe that it is currently used only as the first stage in the attack \ngaining the trust of the victims. The website contains the exact page from the original website on\n\nwhich it is based, with one single change – the sender’s email address embedded within the website\n\ncontent.\n\n5 [https://noticeofpleadings.com/phosphorus/files/Complaint.pdf](https://noticeofpleadings.com/phosphorus/files/Complaint.pdf)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\nSame as the original website, the email is embedded in the webpage content with a javascript code\n\nencoded in decimal. The attackers changed the last 22 numbers – from isis-online[.]org to the fake\n\nemail address isis-online[.]net, as seen below:\n\nThe Fake email code in decimal as presented in the source code of the impersonating website:\n\n['>','a','/','<',' 114',' 101',' 107',' 99',' 105',' 114',' 116',' 83',' 32',' 97',' 101',' 114',' 100',' 110',' 65','>','\\\"',' 116',' 101',' 110','\n\n46',' 101',' 110',' 105',' 108',' 110',' 111',' 45',' 115',' 105',' 115',' 105',' 64',' 114',' 101',' 107',' 99',' 105',' 114','\n\n116',' 115',':','o','t','l','i','a','m','\\\"','=','f','e','r','h','a ','<']\n\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Second set of Emails\n\nIn this scenario, the attackers impersonate a known journalist. Unlike the first format, the latter does\n\nnot contain any link to a fake website. The attacker offers the victim to participate in an online meeting\n\nabout Iran and other subjects of interest for the target (e.g. recent discourse between Iran and the US).\n\nAfter presenting himself and the subject of the meeting, the attacker would ask whether the victim is\n\ninterested in participating. If so, they are requested to replay in order to receive the following details:\n\n1. A list of the other participants.\n\n2. Date and time for the meeting.\n\n3. Details regarding the method of payment.\n\nWe identified on the website URLScan a few scans of a link from the website of Deutcshe Welle, a\n\nGermany-based international news portal. As presented in the following image, the victims were\n\nredirected to the website from malicious domains of the group (which can be found on the ClearSky\n\nTwitter account[6]). One of the domains is dw[.]de – a decoy domain which was mentioned in the\n\nprevious email.\n\n6 [https://twitter.com/clearskysec/status/1006445262003494913](https://twitter.com/clearskysec/status/1006445262003494913)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis link was scanned via URLScan by an anonymous user less than a month days ago, which might\n\nreveal another attack by Charming Kitten[7].\n\nA second wave of attacks using the same vector took place in August. The attackers sent multiple\n\nemail messages in a single night to multiple potential victims, impersonating a woman called\n\nSamantha Vinograd from who works at CNN.\n\nSimilarly to the previous attack wave, the email message distributed to the victims contained multiple\n\nspelling mistakes, especially in the names of the reporters the attackers impersonated. For example,\n\nin the email address used to send the decoy emails is the last name of the reporter is misspelled.\n\nBelow here is the phishing email’s content:\n\n*Hello ** *\n\n*I'm Samantha Vinograd, CNN national security analyst**.*\n*CNN News intends to interview some of Israel's successful figures abroad\nand broadcast it as a documentary. We have interviewed some of the leading\nIsraeli figures in the US, Europe and other countries and are very eager to\nmeet you.*\n*Your humanitarian and political activities have determined us to produce a\nshort documentary of your life and your family.*\n\n*You can specify the time and place of the first meeting for the\ndocumentary pre-production stage.*\n\n- Please advise me of any special mobility or dietary requirements you may\nhave. I hope you are able to accept this invitation and I look forward to\nhearing from you.*\n\n*Samantha Vinograd*\n*CNN National Security Analyst *,\n*Author of @CNN Presidential Weekly Briefing*\n\nAn analysis of the email’s headers reveals that the attackers planted an email tracker within the\n\nmessage. The tracker can be seen below:\n\nThe tracker is used by the attackers to check whether the message is forwarded to additional\n\nrecipients, and to obtain the geolocation and IP address of the victim. Data is collected via a cookie\n\nthat is installed on the victim machine in the following route:\n\n7 [https://urlscan.io/result/12cbdac3-8a98-4dd3-9158-7c875d8db71e/](https://urlscan.io/result/12cbdac3-8a98-4dd3-9158-7c875d8db71e/)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use.

Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Attack Infrastructure: C&C Servers, Domains and Attribution\n\nWe Identified more than six unique servers hosting the fake Charming Kitten websites. Of which, four\n\nimpersonate entities as part of the first stage, while the other two host servers impersonating Google\n\nservices. We asses that these are likely to be used as in second stage of the attack – data theft.\n\n**Server** **Domain point to the IP** **Impersonation subject**\n\n185.141.63[.]8 Skynevvs[.]com Sky News\n\nSkynews.com\n\n185.141.63[.]135 Leslettrespersanes[.]net Les lettres persanes (Iranian news website in\n\nInztaqram[.]ga French)\n\nleslettrespersanes.fr\n\nInstagram\n\n185.141.63[.]156 Islamicemojimaker[.]com NIAC (National Iranian American Council)[8]\n\nniaconucil[.]org niacouncil.org\n\n185.141.63[.]157 google.drive-accounts[.]com Google drive\n\ndrive-accounts[.]com drive.google.com\n\n185.141.63[.]160 unirsd[.]com UNRISD (United Nation Research Institute for\n\nSocial Development)\n\nunrisd.org\n\n185.141.63[.]161 acconut-verify[.]com Google Account Verification\n\n185.141.63[.]162 isis-online[.]net ISIS (Institute for Science and International\n\nSecurity)\n\nisis-online.org\n\n185.141.63[.]170 accounts-drive[.]com Google drive\n\nw3-schools[.]org W3Schools\n\nw3schools.com\n\n185.141.63[.]172 Seisolarpros[.]org SEI Professional Services\n\nseisolarpros.com\n\nAfter a month of campaign operations, The attackers switched the servers used to store the email\n\naddresses, containing thousands of addresses.\n\n8 Please note that in recent days, many Iranian citizens protested in front the office of the National Iranian\nAmerican Council. They protested against the organization, claiming that it is does not represent the Iranian\ncommunity in the US.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use.

In any other case, the server will redirect the client to the original website (HTTP 302\n\nin port 442 or 301 in port 80). The following image presents the headers of 185.141.63[.]160 from\n\nShodan[9]. The fake domain is unirsd[.]com, however, it redirects to the original website.\n\nThe server 185.141.63[.]135 is the only server that pointing to 2 domains:\n\n1) leslettrespersanes[.]net which is impersonating the French magazine “Les Lettres Persanes”.\n\n2) Inztaqram[.]ga which is impersonating Instagram company. This is **the first time we**\n\nobserved a phishing website executed by Charming Kitten that impersonate non-google\n\nservices in order to steal credentials from the victim to other services.\n\nAll of the servers used in the latest attack are hosted by BelCloud Hosting Corporation, located in\n\nBulgaria (ISP Kiwi Technologies Ltd.). Older servers in the campaign, such as 46.21.150[.]197, are\n\nhosted by other hosting services.\n\nAs presented in the last image, all servers are Apache/2.4.39 (Win64), using OpenSSL/1.1.1b and PHP\n\nversions 7.3.5 or 7.3.6.\n\n9 [https://www.shodan.io/host/185.141.63.160](https://www.shodan.io/host/185.141.63.160)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\nSearching other servers with these unique parameters returned less than 300 results. Most of these\n\nresults are not malicious. We ruled out the legitimate servers that pointed in their redirect to the same\n\nIP address or to a domain the server hosts. Within these servers, we identified one server that redirects\n\nto Google services, which concurrently hosts two Iranians Name Servers. We consider this server to be\n\npart of this campaign in medium-high level of confidence:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst and foremost, it should be noted that the Iranian cyber divisions use servers belonging to Hetzner\n\nOnline GmbH in many of their operations[10]. Second, there is an overlap of the server version, the SSL\n\nversion, the PHP version and even the serial number of the SSL certificate.\n\n[10 https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2019/04/Iran-Memo.pdf](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2019/04/Iran-Memo.pdf)\n[https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Global-Iranian-Disinformation-Operation-Clearsky-](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Global-Iranian-Disinformation-Operation-Clearsky-Cyber-Security.pdf)\n[Cyber-Security.pdf](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Global-Iranian-Disinformation-Operation-Clearsky-Cyber-Security.pdf)\n[https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/group5-syria/](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/group5-syria/)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attribution\n\nWe made an attribution to the Iranian Charming Kitten group based on three main factors:\n\n1. The two main websites linked in the second scenario are:\n\n      - The Jewish Journal (Please see for further information).\n\n      - German magazine - Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn March 2019, ClearSky identified another attack as part of this campaign, using an email address\n\npointing to jewishjournal[.]online. From the Passive DNS records of this domain, we identified another\n\ndomain impersonating Deutsche Welle – deutcshewelle[.]net.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use. Distributing the report outside of recipient organization is\n\nnot permitted.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on passive DNS records, it seems that Charming Kitten used the decoy Jewish Journal domain\n\nonce again in July 2019:\n\n2. As mentioned, the victims are non-Iranian investigators based in the US, Middle East and\n\nFrance. Their field of expertise fits Charming Kitten’s TTPs. The repeating spelling mistakes\n\nin the email content are also evidence of the Charming Kitten line of action.\n\n3. The impersonation to NIAC indicates that it is an Iranian actor.\n\nApart from the above reasons, additional information also ties the group’s activity to Iran. One the\n\nNetBlock of the IP addresses of the original servers we found the website exnovin[.]org. ExNovin is an\n\nIranian company that developed a platform for money exchange. The domain was previously hosted\n\non Hetzner, a German Internet hosting company. We estimate that these factors are likely related to\n\nthe Charming Kitten group.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\n\nTLP: AMBER - The content of the document is solely for internal use.
