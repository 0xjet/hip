More Than Just a Game\n\n**securelist.com/winnti-faq-more-than-just-a-game/57585/**\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nToday Kaspersky Lab’s team of experts published a detailed research report that analyzes a\nsustained cyberespionage campaign conducted by the cybercriminal organization known as\nWinnti.\n\nAccording to report, the Winnti group has been attacking companies in the online video\ngame industry since 2009 and is currently still active.\n\nThe group’s objectives are stealing digital certificates signed by legitimate software vendors\nin addition to intellectual property theft, including the source code of online game projects.\n\nThe attackers’ favorite tool is the malicious program we called “Winnti”. It has evolved since\nits first use, but all variants can be divided into two generations: 1.x and 2.x. Our publication\ndescribes both variants of this tool.In our report we publish an analysis of the first\n**generation of Winnti.**\n\nThe second generation (2.x) was used in one of the attacks which we investigated during its\nactive stage, helping the victim to interrupt data transfer and isolate infections in the\ncorporate network. The incidents, as well as results of our investigation, are described in\n**the full report (PDF) on the Winnti group.**\n\n[The Executive Summary is available here.](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Is this research about a gaming Trojan from 2011? Why do you think it is significant?**\n\nThis research is about a set of industrial cyberespionage campaigns and a criminal\norganization which massively penetrates many software companies and plays a very\nimportant role in the success of cyberespionage campaigns of other malicious actors.\n\nIt is important to be aware of this threat actor to understand the broader picture of\ncyberattacks coming from Asia. Having infected gaming companies that do business in the\nMMORPG space, the attackers potentially get access to millions of users. So far, we don’t\nhave data that the attackers stole from common users but we do have at least 2 incidents\nwhere the Winnti malware was planted on an online game update servers and these\nmalicious executables were spread among a large number of the online gamers. The\nsamples we observed seemed not to be malware targeting end user gamers, but a malware\nmodule which accidentally got into wrong place. Hoever, the potential for attackers to misuse\nsuch access to infect hundreds of millions of Internet users creates a major global risk.\n\nIt’s important to understand that many gaming companies do business not only in gaming,\nbut very often they are also developers or publishers of different other types of software. We\nhave tracked an incident where a compromised company served an update of their software\nwhich included a Trojan from the Winnti hacking team. That became an infection vector to\npenetrate another company, which in turn led to a personal data leak of large number of its\ncustomers.\n\nSo far, this research is dedicated to a malicious group that not only undermines trust in fair\ngameplay but has a serious impact on trust in software vendors in general, especially in the\nregions where the Winnti group is active at the moment.\n\n**What are the malicious purposes of this Trojan?**\n\nThe Trojan, or to be precise, a penetration kit called Winnti includes various modules to\nprovide general purpose remote access to compromised machines. This includes general\nsystem information collection, file and process management, creating chains of network port\nredirection for convenient data exfiltration and remote desktop access.\n\n**Is this attack still active?**\n\nYes, despite active steps to stop the attackers by the revocation of digital certificates,\ndetection of the malware and an active investigation, the attackers remain active, with at\nleast several victim companies around the world being actively compromised.\n\n**What is the potential impact for common users?**\n\nThe malware in question does not target common users at the moment. With the use of that\nmalware, the attackers are targeting online game software developer companies. So far we\nhave not discovered malware with marks of Winnti team origin that targets common users\n\n\n-----\n\nbut it is not improbable that such malware exists.\n\n**What is the possible damage for gaming companies?**\n\nThe malware has been known to steal digital certificates used by gaming companies, which\nallows the attackers to distribute malicious software signed by trusted entities. Also, we’ve\nobserved attempts to steal intellectual property belonging to gaming companies such as\nsource code and internal systems design.\n\n**Who are the attackers? What countries are they from?**\n\nOur research revealed that the attackers’ used Chinese language in the code of the\nmalware; they used Chinese locale in their Windows servers and they have been using a\nnumber of IP addresses in China. There are a number of other indicators, such as\nnicknames, timezones and more showing that the attackers are located in the People’s\nRepublic of China.\n\nFor example, multiple virtual personas related to the Winnti malware appeared on specific\nChinese forums about hacking/vulnerabilities/network security topics. We have tracked one\nsuch persona down to ad tenancy in Luoyang, Central China.\n\n**Who are the victims? What is the scale of the attack?**\n\nThe majority of the victims are software development companies, most of which are\nproducing online video games from South East Asia. We have counted 35 unique\ncompromised businesses over the last year and a half. From the other side we revealed 227\ndomain names created by the attackers and used as Command & Control servers in different\ncampaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Why are the attackers focused on on SE Asia?**\n\nThis is most likely related to the geography of the attackers’ home and their interests in local\nsoftware developers. It seems that the attackers were interested in gaining access to local\npopular software vendors. The reason behind that is unclear, they probably wanted to get a\nhold on digital certificates and access to software production processes of local software\ndevelopers to be able to attack other local organizations or get a potential to infect a large\nnumber of local users at any time.\n\n**How are users (both home and corporate) protected against those types of attack?**\n\nAll Kaspersky Lab customers are protected now with regular updates of anti-malware bases.\nWe would like to recommend that all other users to stay cautious when opening attachments\nthat arrive in suspicious e-mails as this was exactly the technique used to spread the\nmalware.\n\n**Can you describe the different stages of this attack? For example, did the attackers**\n**compromise gaming companies servers first, and then use the compromised servers**\n**(and signed certificates) to distribute malware to end-users (gamers)?**\n\nIn most of cases we have seen targeted attacks which started from a spear phishing email\nsent to one or a few company mailboxes. The emails had a malicious attachment in selfextracting or regular archive with an executable. We haven’t seen any zero-day\nvulnerabilities used by this particular group. After the initial penetration of a corporate\nnetwork, the attackers uploaded a set of tools to the infected machine to scan the network\nresources, escalate privileges and locate the most valuable information in the attacked\norganization. Next, the attackers exfiltrated stolen data in compressed form to one of their\nC&C servers on the internet, normally by using back-connect TCP channel through a chain\nof simple TCP-proxy applications.\n\nAs for the compromised server, yes we have seen incidents when the malware was available\nfor download from public server of gaming companies, but the component we have seen on\nthe server wasn’t enough to successfully infect end-users’ machines and most likely got\n\n\n-----\n\nthere by accident.\n\n**How are the attackers profiting from this? Is it done by online game manipulations or**\n**are they making money by stealing personal user data/files/credentials from infected**\n**machines via the backdoor (not related to in-game play)?**\n\nWe believe that the main objective of the attackers is to collect digital certificates, steal\nintellectual property of the software developing companies, which normally includes source\ncode of their products, and theft of in-game virtual gold/currency in MMORPGs. While digital\ncertificates could be sold on the underground market to other attackers, the source code\nbrings more opportunities from in-game exploitation of vulnerabilities to create of shadow\ncopies of the online game business in the local region of the attackers.\n\n**If it’s done via in-game play, can you explain how this is done? Are they exploiting**\n**vulnerabilities in the compromised games to create rogue amounts of in-game**\n**currency (gold/runes/coins/etc) and then sell the fake in-game currency to other**\n**players for real money?**\n\nWe currently don’t have full confirmation that the attackers abused games to generate fake\ncurrencies as we didn’t have full access to the gaming servers that were compromised by the\nattackersbut, according to some reports from the gaming companies, some malicious\nmodules were injected into the process of game servers and most likely were used to\nmanipulate the internal state of the process, which most likely leads to production of rogue\namounts of in-game currency or any other valuable game objects.\n\n**Which gaming companies were targeted? Which games were targeted?**\n\nWe disclose the list of companies which digital certificates were stolen and abused by the\nattackers. However, the list doesn’t include all compromised companies we know. Some of\nthe companies we worked with voluntarily assisted our research and investigation but\npreferred to remain anonymous. Below is the list of companies that had their certificates\nstolen:\n\nESTsoft Corp\nKog Co., Ltd.\nLivePlex Corp\nMGAME Corp\nRosso Index KK\nSesisoft\nWemade\nYNK Japan\nGuangzhou YuanLuo\nFantasy Technology Corp\nNeowiz\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso Winnti samples contain tags that could mean companies that were breached or had\nbeen compromised and to which the samples are/were destined. Among them we have\nrecognized following companies:\n\nCayenne Entertainment Technology Co.,Ltd, Taiwan, tag: Wasabii\nAsiaSoft, Thailand, tag: asiasoft\nGameNet, Russia, tag: GameNet\nNEXON Corporation, Japan, tag: nexon\nVNG Corporation, Viet nam, tag: zing\nTrion Worlds, USA, tag: TRIONWORLD\nEYAsoft, South Korea, tag: eyaap80\nNCsoft, South Korea, tags: aion5000, aion2008\nZemi Interactive, South Korea, tag: zemi\nNHN Corporation, South Korea, tag: NHN\nHangame Japan, Japan, tag: hangame.jp\n\n**Did you identify any unique characteristics during your analysis that indicated who**\n**the attackers might be?**\n\nYes, we were able to collect a few unique characteristics of the attackers:\n\nThe time zone when the attackers were active: most likely between GMT +07 and\nGMT+09.\nChinese simplified locale set in the resource section of some malicious modules.\nChinese text strings used in the report messages of some modules.\nChinese hacking team name used as a password for special backdoor.\nChinese user profiles involved in posting control messages on public Internet resources\n(blogs and forums).\nChinese system locale used at C&C servers (via RDP connection).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Have any of these characteristics been identified in other targeted campaigns not**\n**related to gaming?**\n\nCertificates of gaming companies were used in attacks against Tibetan and Uyghur activists:\n\nhttps://securelist.com/new-uyghur-and-tibetan-themed-attacks-using-pdf-exploits45/35465/\n[https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002524.html](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002524.html)\n\nSome additional industries including the aerospace:\n\nhttps://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/adobe-patches-two-vulnerabilitiesbeing-exploited-in-the-wild\n\nWe also observed that SK Communications, the owner of the largest social network CyWorld\nin South Korea and the popular South Korean web portal Nate, had been hacked back in\n2011 and an infection spread there from another company ESTsoft to which the Winnti team\nhad first penetrated:\n\nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wpcontent/uploads/sites/43/2013/04/20082912/C5_APT_SKHack.pdf\n\n**Could the Winnti attackers be involved in any additional campaigns that occurred in**\n**the past?**\n\nBased on the general perception of the Winnti operations, we believe that the attackers that\ncurrently form the Winnti group used to be members of Chinese underground hacking teams.\nIt is most likely that they were attacking various entities including businesses and individuals\nas members of those groups, but united in Winnti group they have started doing that\nroutinely, systematically and under well-organized management. The ex-members of various\nhacking teams were united and started doing penetrations at a professional level.\n\n**What does this campaign mean to someone who isn’t an online gamer or gaming**\n**company? Is the Winnti Crew attacking other targets as well?**\n\nThere have been few incidents when non-gaming companies were compromised, however\nthe main focus of the Winnti group is currently game developers. Nevertheless there is no\nreason why the Winnti group wouldn’t move to other types of businesses in the future,\nbecause their attack tools are universal and may be used against any other target.\n\n**Are there any unique infection symptoms that end-users should be aware of (BSOD,**\n**open ports, etc.)?**\n\nThe malware that we have analyzed uses rootkit approach while running on the system. It\nstarts as a system driver and loads additional components in memory. The end-user will\nmost likely see no changes compared to the uninfected system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**What should companies in the gaming industry do to verify their servers weren t**\n**compromised?**\n\nThe easiest way for system administrators would be to deploy an anti-malware engine in a\nproduct or a standalone tool (such as Kaspersky Security Scan) as all the malicious files are\ncurrently detected with our anti-malware databases.\n\n**What should end-users do to check if their systems were compromised?**\n\nIt is possible for a common user to manually check if the system is compromised. Normally it\ncan be recognized by local files on disk with names apphelp.dll and winmm.dll which are\nlocated outside %WINDIR%System32 directory. Traditionally, the attackers place these files\nin %WINDIR%, which is a good indicator of a compromised system.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Certificate authorities](https://securelist.com/tag/certificate-authorities/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Online Games](https://securelist.com/tag/online-games/)\n[Rootkits](https://securelist.com/tag/rootkits/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nWinnti FAQ.
