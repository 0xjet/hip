    "plain_text": "# Intel® Hardware-based Security  Technologies for Intelligent Retail Devices\n\n#### Based on 4th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors\n\nIntelligent devices are transforming the world of retail by bringing the convenience,\nvariety, and ease of use of the Internet shopping experience into the store.\n\nTraditional and mobile point of sale (POS) devices with Internet connectivity share vast\namounts of data and enable retailers to use the power of data analytics to support\ninformed business decisions. Digital signs, interactive kiosks, POS terminals and\ninteractive vending machines based on Intel® architecture have the intelligence to run\nanonymous viewer analytics through Intel® Audience Impression Metrics Suite (Intel® AIM\nSuite) and transform consumer experiences with relevant messaging delivered through\nrich and compelling graphics and video. “Digital Wallet” applications enable shoppers to\nmake transactions on in-store devices using their smartphones.\n\nProtecting intelligent retail systems, and the customer and transaction data they\ngenerate, against malware, theft, and other attacks has never been a more critical issue\nfor retailers. Intel security capabilities are now available to help retailers meet a broad\nrange of threats.\n\n#### Introduction\n\n\nidentification and inventory information.\nInteractive digital signs carry viewer\nanalytics data, targeted advertising\nmessages, and applications for content\nmanagement. Intelligent devices inside the\nstore, including intelligent signs and kiosks,\nshare data with the retailer’s inventory\ndatabase and are used to support mobile\nPOS applications.\n\nThe sharing of this high-value retail data\nis spawning a spectrum of sophisticated\nthreats, ranging from data theft and\nidentity theft to the display of malicious\ndigital graffiti intended to harm retail\nbrands on digital signs or interactive\ndevices. Attackers are using firmware to\ngain access to a device’s operating system\nand applications, in addition to creating\nviruses and malware that can disable\na retail system or provide thieves with\naccess to sensitive data.\n\n\n## Protecting intelligent retail systems, and the customer and transaction data they generate, against malware, theft, and other attacks has never been a more critical issue for retailers.\n\n\nIntelligent retail devices are designed to\naggregate, analyze, and share data so\nretailers and their customers can conduct\ntransactions and make informed decisions.\nBeyond traditional point of sale (POS)\ndevices and cash-and-carry registers\nwith Internet connectivity, today’s new\ngeneration of retail systems now includes\nmobile intelligent POS systems, interactive\ndigital signs, interactive kiosks, and\ninteractive vending machines. In addition,\nsome devices are equipped with Intel AIM\nSuite for anonymous viewer analytics.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that all of\nthe data shared by intelligent devices in\nretail has great value to retailers and their\ncustomers and is therefore sensitive in\nnature. Devices including POS terminals,\ninteractive vending machines and ATMs\nare used to perform financial transactions,\nretrieve customer information, loyalty\n\n\n-----\n\nfor Intelligent Retail Devices\n\nProtecting systems, networks, and data\nitself is a critical challenge for the retail\nindustry. As the industry prepares to\naddress threats with existing softwarebased security solutions, Intel provides\na comprehensive range of security\ncapabilities built-in to hardware. These\nsecurity capabilities begin at the platform\nlevel and include protection of the BIOS,\nfirmware, and platform hardware itself.\n\nIntel takes a comprehensive approach\nto platform, software, and data security\nand readers should understand that\nthe platform technologies described in\nthis paper complement other securityrelated components of Intel® vPro™\ntechnology, including Intel® Active\nManagement Technology (Intel® AMT)[1],\nIntel® Virtualization Technology (Intel®\nVT)[2],and Intel® Trusted Execution\nTechnology (Intel® TXT)[3]. Intel’s platform\nsecurity technologies are also designed\nto complement comprehensive software\nsecurity solutions from McAfee* designed\nto protect systems against attacks,\nviruses, and malware, including providing\nsecurity protection below the operating\nsystem. For details about these Intel\nsecurity technologies, please refer to the\nresources section at the conclusion of this\npaper.\n\nIntel’s platform security technologies\nprovide the foundation for protecting data\nintegrity, availability and confidentiality.\nRetailers can modify their existing\nsecurity solutions to take advantage of\nthe hardware features of systems based\non Intel Core processors, or they can\nuse software solutions that have been\noptimized for use with Intel’s hardwarebased security capabilities, giving them\nhardware-enhanced security.\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the\nhardware-based security technologies\nenabled by 4th generation Intel Core\nprocessors that can help address security\nthreats in retail:\n\n\n\n- \u0007Intel® Data Protection Technology\n\nwith Intel® AES New Instructions\n(Intel® AES-NI): hardware-accelerated\ndata encryption and decryption, with\nhigh levels of processing performance\nfor secure and responsive user\nexperiences.\n\n- \u0007Intel® Platform Protection Technology\n\nwith BIOS Guard: hardware-assisted\nauthentication and protection against\nBIOS recovery attacks.\n\n- \u0007Intel® Platform Protection Technology\n\nwith Platform Trust: integrated\nsolution for credential storage and key\nmanagement for Microsoft Windows* 8.\n\n- \u0007Intel® Platform Protection Technology\n\nwith Boot Guard: authenticated code\nmodule (ACM)-based secure boot that\nverifies a known and trusted BIOS is\nbooting the platform.\n\n- \u0007Intel® Identity Protection Technology\n\nwith Near Field Communication (NFC):\nidentity protection for customers using\nNFC enabled smartphone or smartcard\nin “Tap-and-Pay”, “Tap-to-Authenticate’,\nor “Tap-to-Connect“ use cases with their\npersonal systems to securely access\nonline services and e-commerce.\n\n#### Intel® Data Protection Technology with Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI)\nIntel AES New Instructions refer to the\nset of instructions available with the Intel\n4th generation Intel Core processor family.\nThe instructions enable rapid and secure\ndata encryption and decryption based on\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\nas defined by FIPS Publication No. 197.\nAES is currently the dominant block cipher\nused in various protocols, and the new\ninstructions are valuable for a wide range\nof applications. Although the instructions\nwere first introduced in 2010 with Intel®\nmicroarchitecture formerly code-named\n‘Westmere,’ the 4th generation Intel Core\n\n\nprocessor family enables performance\nimprovements targeted at up to 15\npercent with approximately 25 percent\nlower design power (TDP) compared to\nprevious generation Intel processors\n(source: Intel). Intel AES New Instructions\nare supported on Intel® Core™ i5 and i7\nprocessors only.\n\n## Intel’s platform security technologies are also designed to complement comprehensive software security solutions from McAfee* to protect systems against attacks, viruses, and malware, including providing security protection below the operating system.\n\nThe architecture includes instructions\nthat offer full hardware support for\nAES. Four instructions support AES\nencryption and decryption, and two other\ninstructions support AES key expansion.\nThe instructions accelerate the execution\nof AES algorithms by using hardware\nto perform some of the performance\nintensive steps of the AES algorithm.\nA seventh instruction allows carry-less\nmultiplication.\n\nThe performance improvement that can\nbe achieved with Intel AES-NI depends on\nthe specific application and the proportion\nof application time spent in encryption\nand decryption. At the algorithm level,\nusing Intel AES-NI can provide a significant\nspeedup of AES. For non-parallel modes\nof AES operation such as CBC-encrypt,\nIntel AES-NI can provide a 2-3 fold gain in\nperformance over a completely software\napproach. For parallelizable modes such\nas CBC-decrypt and CTR, Intel AES-NI can\nprovide a 10x improvement over software\nsolutions (source: Intel). Performance\nimprovements apply to typical AES\n\n\n-----\n\nfor Intelligent Retail Devices\n\n\nimplementations, including standard key\nlengths, standard modes of operation, and\neven some nonstandard or future variants.\n\nAES instructions also provide important\nsecurity benefits. By running in dataindependent time and not using tables,\nthey help to eliminate the major timing\nand cache-based attacks that can threaten\ntable-based software implementations\nof AES. The instructions also simplify AES\nimplementation by reducing code size\nand reducing the risk of accidentally\nintroducing security flaws. Because\nIntel AES-NI perform the decryption\nand encryption completely in hardware\nwithout the need for software lookup\ntables, Intel AES-NI can lower the risk of\nside-channel attacks.\n\n#### Intel® Platform Protection Technologies\n\nIntel® Platform Protection Technology\nwith BIOS Guard\n\nA device’s BIOS is contained in a privileged\nspace that is invisible to anti-virus\nsoftware. In addition, malware infecting\nBIOS remains persistent, and it does not\ngo away even after a cold boot.\n\n\nTo avoid detection, attackers are now\ndigging deeper into the platform.\nVulnerabilities in System Management\nMode (SMM) and System Management\nInterrupt (SMI) handlers have been\nidentified. The complexity of SMM\nhardware and software makes it very\n\n\nlikely that BIOS update vulnerabilities\nwill continue to be exploited in the future.\n\nFor this reason, platform security begins\nwith the BIOS.\n\nIntel® Platform Protection Technology\nwith BIOS Guard, a new feature on\n\n\n-----\n\nfor Intelligent Retail Devices\n\n4th generation Intel Core processors\n(U-series), ensures that updates to system\nBIOS flash and Embedded Controller\n(EC) flash are secure. BIOS updates are\ncryptographically verified by the BIOS\nGuard module, using a protected agent\nrunning in AC-RAM (Authenticated Code\nRAM), to perform authentication and\nupdating of flash control hardware.\n\nFor EC updates, BIOS Guard employs early\nBIOS POST provisioning of a random secret\nthat is shared between the CPU and the\nEC. The BIOS Guard module uses this value\nto identify itself to the EC, which will\nreject all protected operations without\nthis identification.\n\nEach protected component of a BIOS Guard\nprotected BIOS update is cryptographically\nsigned by the device manufacturer,\nchecked, or signed and checked, before\nit is allowed to update a system. BIOS\nGuard helps ensure that malware stays\nout of the BIOS by blocking all softwarebased attempts to modify protected BIOS\nwithout the platform manufacturer’s\nauthorization.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, BIOS Guard\naddresses SMM vulnerabilities by\nstrengthening the update trust boundary.\n\n### Figure 1\n\n\nIntel® Platform Protection Technologies\n\nIntel® Platform Trust technology (Intel®\nPTT) is a platform functionality for\ncredential storage and key management\nused by Microsoft Windows 8. It supports\nWindows 8 secure and measured boot\nand supports all the Microsoft mandatory\ncommands for Trusted Platform Module\n(TPM) 2.0 v.0.88. It is an integrated\nsolution in the Intel® Management Engine\nfor 4th generation Intel Core processors\nfor ultra-low TDP (ULT) platforms.\n\nThis integrated solution provides a\nsecure trust element to meet Windows\n8 Connected Standby (CS) requirements\nwith reduced power consumption in\nultra-low power state S0iX environments.\nFunctional integration reduces BOM cost\nand board real estate requirements.\n\nIntel Platform Protection Technology\nwith Boot Guard technology works with\nIntel PTT, reducing the complexity of the\nWindows 8 boot process and meeting\nall Windows 8 requirements. Boot\nGuard protects against boot block-level\nmalware and provides an added level of\nhardware-based platform security to\nprevent repurposing of the platform to run\nunauthorized software. The technology\n\n\n-----\n\nfor Intelligent Retail Devices\n\n\nis rooted in a protected hardware\ninfrastructure and is designed to prevent\nthe execution of an unauthorized boot\nblock. An Authenticated Code Module\n(ACM) is provided by Intel and signed\nto the hardware. When invoked by the\nprocessor on platform reset it executes in\nprotected AC-RAM space.\n\nBoot Guard covers three configurable boot\ntypes:\n\n- \u0007Measured Boot measures the Initial Boot\nBlock (IBB) into the platform protected\nstorage device such as Trusted Platform\nModule (TPM) or Intel PTT.\n\n- \u0007Verified Boot cryptographically verifies\nthe platform IBB using the boot policy\nkey.\n\n- \u0007Measured +Verified Boot measures and\nverifies the IBB.\n\n\n#### Intel® Identity Protection Technology with NFC\n\nOriginally designed for desktop, notebook,\nand Ultrabook™ devices, Intel® Identity\nProtection Technology (Intel® IPT) is now\navailable in intelligent retail devices based\non 4th generation Intel Core processors.\nIntel IPT is suite of four technologies:\nOne Time Password, Protected\nTransaction Display, Embedded PKI and\nNear Field Communications (NFC). The\nidentity protection technologies address\nidentity theft by introducing a second\nfactor of authentication that relies\non a tamper resistant area within the\nintelligent hardware.\n\nThis paper introduces Intel IPT with NFC\nas an identity protection solution for\ncustomers using the “Tap-and-Interact”\nuse case to interact with a digital sign,\nvending machine, and other devices. For\ndetails about other IPT technologies,\nplease refer to the resources section at\nthe conclusion of this paper.\n\nNFC is a short-range wireless\ncommunication technology with a protocol\nfor peer-to-peer data exchanges between\ntwo endpoints. The current usage model\nfor NFC enables customers to connect to\na device to interact, exchange data, checkin, set up a transaction, scan devices, and\npay for a product by tapping their NFCenabled smart card or smartphone against\na NFC sensor in a retail device, then\ncomplete the transaction, with positive\nidentity confirmation protected through\ncryptographic binding. All this is done\nthrough a software application running on\nthe OS.\n\nIntel IPT includes similar use cases for\nNFC such as “Tap-to-Pay” and “Tap-toAuthenticate” capabilities which enable\nusers to securely access online resources\nand e-commerce payments simply tapping\ntheir smart card on their NFC-enabled\nPC. Intel IPT use case for NFC as “Tap and\nInteract” allows secure interaction\n\n\nwith interactive devices. Intel IPT is an\nintegrated chipset-based security feature\nthat introduces security by isolating the\ndata received by NFC from the operating\nsystem. Intel’s solution adds value by\nintroducing an integrated secure element\nin the chipset within the retail device.\n\n\n-----\n\nfor Intelligent Retail Devices\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIntelligent systems require smart security,\nand Intel provides essential security\ntechnologies for platforms, software, and\ndata.\n\nIntel’s approach to security in intelligent\nretail devices begins at the platform\nlevel, with hardware-based security\ncapabilities built-in to 4th generation Intel\nCore processors. Integrating security\nfunctionality on the platform, beginning\nwith the protection of the BIOS, firmware,\nand platform hardware itself, creates\na strong foundation for protecting\nintelligent retail devices against security\nthreats. Hardware-based security works\nwith existing software-based security\nsolutions, which can be modified to take\nadvantage of the hardware features of\nsystems based on Intel Core processors. In\naddition software solutions from thirdparty vendors have been optimized for\nuse with Intel’s hardware-based security\ncapabilities.\n\n\nHardware-enhanced security, enabled\nin 4th generation Intel Core processors,\nmeans that powerful security mechanisms\nare built-in to every intelligent device\nbased on Intel architecture, providing a\nfoundation of security for intelligent retail\ndevices and applications.\n\n#### Resources\n\nIntel® Data Protection Technology with Intel®\nAES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI)\n\n[Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard New](http://download-software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/165683/aes-wp-2012-09-22-v01.pdf)\n[Instructions (Intel® AES-NI)](http://download-software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/165683/aes-wp-2012-09-22-v01.pdf)\n\n[Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI)](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/advanced-encryption-standard--aes-/data-protection-aes-general-technology.html?)\n\n[Accelerate McAfee Endpoint Encryption* with](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/enterprise-security/enterprise-security-aes-ni-mcafee-endpoint-encryption-blueprint.html?)\n[Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI)](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/enterprise-security/enterprise-security-aes-ni-mcafee-endpoint-encryption-blueprint.html?)\n\n[Intel® Data Protection Technology with Secure](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-random-number-generator-drng-software-implementation-guide)\n[Key (Digital Random Number Generator [DRNG])](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-random-number-generator-drng-software-implementation-guide)\n\n\nIntel® Identity Protection Technology\n\n[Role of NFC in the future of Digital Wallet](http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/03/01/role-of-nfc-in-the-future-of-digital-wallet)\n\n[Developers, NFC, and the Ultrabook™:](http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/16/developers-nfc-and-the-ultrabook-what-this-technology-can-do-for-your-app)\n[What this Technology Can Do for Your App](http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/16/developers-nfc-and-the-ultrabook-what-this-technology-can-do-for-your-app)\n\n[Technology Brief: Intel® Identity Protection](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/technology-brief-intel-identity-protection-technology)\n[Technology](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/technology-brief-intel-identity-protection-technology)\n\nIntel® Platform Protection Technology\n\nContact your Intel representative for more\ninformation.\n\nOther Intel® Technologies\n\n[Enhanced Data Protection with](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/data-security/security-overview-general-technology.html?)\n[Hardware-Assisted Security](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/data-security/security-overview-general-technology.html?)\n\n[Intel® Active Management Technology](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology.html?)\n\n[Intel® Trusted Execution Technology](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/trusted-execution-technology/malware-reduction-general-technology.html)\n\n[Intel® Virtualization Technology](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/hardware-assist-virtualization-technology.html)\n\n[Intel® Anti-Theft Technology](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/anti-theft/anti-theft-general-technology.html)\n\n#### Software\n\n[McAfee* Embedded Control Provides](http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/embedded-control.aspx)\n[‘White Listing’ Capabilities to Enhance](http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/embedded-control.aspx)\n[Virus and Malware Security](http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/embedded-control.aspx)\n\n\n1 \u0007Requires activation and a system with a corporate network connection, an Intel® Active Management Technology (Intel® AMT)-enabled chipset, network hardware, and software.
