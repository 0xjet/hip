Further investigation revealed that a paid\nversion of the builder which included the PoS RAM-scraping feature has been around since\nMarch (version 2.9). Upon looking into the threat landscape following this discovery, we\nnoticed that the detection count for Kasidet in June increased by 1,288% compared to the\ncount in May. The spike in June is likely a result of cybercriminals who initially paid for the bot\nand used the builder in March even before it was leaked in July. Looking at one of the\n[samples detected as WORM_KASIDET.SC, we observed that the malware affects PoS](http://www.trendmicro.com.my/vinfo/my/threat-encyclopedia/malware/WORM_KASIDET.SC)\nterminals running Windows operating systems. Network shares is one way for the malware\nto end up on PoS machines. Beause of this, networks with relatively weak security\nmeasures, such as those used by small and medium businesses (SMBs), are potentially at\nrisk. Apart from allowing cybercriminals to scan for credit card information and have stolen\ndata sent over a command-and-control (C&C) server, Kasidet can also launch distributed\ndenial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, log keystrokes, copy clipboard data, and capture\nscreenshots, execute a remote shell, and infect removable drives and network folders.\nDetection counts related to Kasidet are highest in Japan (12.75%), followed by United\nKingdom (10.78%), Taiwan (7.84%), and France (6.86%).\n_Figure 1. Country distribution of Kasidet detections, July 1 – September 17, 2015_\n\n**_Multiple Arrival Vectors The version of the builder leaked in the underground forum_**\n_nulled[dot]io was already cracked thus offering a free tool that cybercriminals can use to_\n\n\n-----\n\nsteal payment card details from PoS systems. The builder and control panel of the latest\nversion of BKDR_KASIDET.SM, was uploaded by a user nicknamed “0x22.” Copies of the\nbuilder package have been replicated in other hacker forums like hackforums[dot]net and\n_crimebiz[dot]net._\n_Figure 2. Screenshot of most recent version of Kasidet builder with PoS RAM scraper leaked_\n_in underground forum_\n\n_Figure 3. Screenshot of cracked Kasidet builder (version 3.9.4) with PoS RAM scraper_\n\nApart from the forum, we have also observed this variant using different arrival vectors such\nas exploit kits, spammed emails, removable drives, networks, and as payloads of other\n[Trojans. For example, we found a variant, BKDR_KASIDET.FD, being sent over spammed](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/bkdr_kasidet.fd)\nmessages.\n_Figure 4. Sample spammed message containing BKDR_KASIDET.FD_\n\nAnother variant, [WORM_KASIDET.NM, was observed to be delivered as the final payload for](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/WORM_KASIDET.NM)\nthe Sundown exploit kit. Cybercriminals using this worm can use the backdoor command\n\"ccsearch\" to run PoS RAM scraping routines on affected machines. Old Malware, New\n**_Money This is not the first time that memory-scraping capabilities were added into a botnet_**\n[tool like Neutrino. PoS-specific features of the FighterPoS code were built on top of malware](http://www.trendmicro.com.ph/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/fighterpos-one-man-pos-malware-campaign)\nthat was designed for botnets. However, the upgrade of Kasidet to include memory-scraping\nfunctions is still quite notable. Upgrading old malware to include PoS RAM-scraping\ncapabilities is a new technique in the threat landscape, but it’s not surprising given how\nlucrative stolen payment card data is. It shows that more and more cybercriminals are putting\ntwo and two together to make more money. PoS RAM scrapers are usually sold underground\nat a price at par with their lucrative potential and now that cybercriminals have access to a\ncracked version of a memory-scraping botnet tool, they can conduct attacks without the\nhassle of paying excessively for it. Scoring this tool is basically finding a valuable tool in a\nbargain bin and ending up not having to even pay for it. Notable Routines Apart from its\ncard-scraping capabilities, the malware checks the following to evade detection:\n\nWhich virtualization modules (BOCHS, QEMU,VBOX,VMWARE ) are loaded\nif a debugger is present\nif the system's username and path name is related to a sandbox system\nif registries contain virtualization-related keys\nand the window class name\n\nAnother notable behavior of Kasidet is that its C&C servers return a \"404 Not found\" error\ncode, but in fact contain its base-64 encoded commands below the error page.\n_Figure 5. Screenshot of \"404 Not found\" error code sent by Kasidet C&C_\n\nIt can also inject browsers and FTP client servers to monitor network activities. It also checks\nregistry keys related to Microsoft email clients to gather email credentials. Solutions Trend\nMicro protects customers from all threats related to Kasidet. To protect enterprises from bots\n[and malware with PoS RAM-scraping capabilities, it is best to employ endpoint application](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/endpoint-application-control/pos-system-security/app-whitelisting/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[control or whitelisting technology, included in the Trend Micro Smart Protection Suite, to keep](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/endpoint-application-control/pos-system-security/app-whitelisting/index.html)\nyou in control of the applications that run on your network. Enterprises can also\n[consider Trend Micro Deep Discovery, which has specialized detection engines and custom](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/#network-protection)\nsandboxing that can detect evasive attacker activities like the anti-sandboxing techniques\nmentioned in this entry.
