One of these threats is IPStorm.\n\n[In May 2019, researchers from Anomali discovered a new Golang malware targeting](https://www.anomali.com/blog/the-interplanetary-storm-new-malware-in-wild-using-interplanetary-file-systems-ipfs-p2p-network)\nWindows, which they dubbed IPStorm (InterPlanetary Storm).IPStorm is a botnet that\nabuses a legitimate Peer-to-peer (p2p) network called InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as\na means to obscure malicious traffic. It was found the malware eventually allowed attackers\nto execute arbitrary PowerShell commands on the victim’s Windows machine.\n\nOur research team recently identified new Linux variants of IPStorm targeting various Linux\narchitectures (ARM, AMD64, Intel 80386) and platforms (servers, Android, IoT). We have\nalso detected a macOS variant. The macOS variant and most of the Linux samples are fully\nundetected in VirusTotal at the time of this publication. IPStorm is written in Golang, which\n[enabled Intezer Analyze to detect cross-platform code connections between the Linux](https://analyze.intezer.com/)\nsamples and the Windows malware first reported by Anomali.\n\nThe Linux variant has additional features over the documented Windows version, such as\nusing SSH brute-force as a means to spread to additional victims and fraudulent network\n**[activity abusing Steam gaming and advertising platforms. The Linux variant has adjusted](https://store.steampowered.com/)**\nsome features in order to account for the fundamental differences that exist between this\noperating system and Windows.\n\nIn this post, we will present a code relations graph between the IPStorm Windows and\nLinux samples, analyze one of the Linux variant’s behavior, and compare its features and\ncapabilities to the old Windows samples to track its evolution. Following we will take a\ndeeper dive into some notable features and explain how to respond to this threat.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nMost of the IPStorm Linux samples were fully undetected before we submitted them for\n[genetic analysis in Intezer Analyze.](http://analyze.intezer.com/)\n\nIn this post, we will focus on the\n**658638c6bef52e03e6aea4b6c1b2b3b8d81ad40144b56b2122d96e6957c33117 Linux**\nsample.\n\n\n-----\n\n_658638c6bef52e03e6aea4b6c1b2b3b8d81ad40144b56b2122d96e6957c33117 sample_\n_undetected in VirusTotal._\n\nBecause IPStorm is written in Golang, not only can we observe strong code connections\nbetween the different Linux variants, we can also identify connections to IPStorm’s\nWindows samples uploaded to our system in 2019.\n\nThe following map emphasizes code similarities between the different versions and\noperating systems. The nodes represent the individual samples and the lines are the code\nrelations between them. All samples are linked to each other in some way:\n\n**IPStorm PE files from 2019**\n**IPStorm ELF files from 2020**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe graph depicts three main clusters, with each cluster containing samples that have\nstrong code connections between them:\n\nPE, intel 80386 architecture\nELF, intel 80386 architecture\nELF, amd x86-64 architecture\n\nYou will also notice shared code exists between the ELF clusters and the ELF and PE intel\n80386 architecture clusters.\n\nYou can use the cluster_directory.py API script in this [GitHub repository to create a cluster](https://github.com/intezer/analyze-scripts)\ngraph of your own.\n\n## Linux Variant Behavior Flow\n\n[The Linux variant symbols are stripped. Using the plugin IDAGolangHelper we retrieved the](https://github.com/sibears/IDAGolangHelper)\nfile’s symbols and saw exactly which packages the malware contains. A package in Go is a\nbundle of Go source files which make up a specific functionality. Every Go source file\nbelongs to a package.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Linux malware s main logic is implemented in a package called storm_starter, a new\npackage that was not in the Windows version. All logic was implemented via the main\nfunction in the Windows version.\n\nBoth versions have similarities in the way the main flow is implemented, however, the Linux\ninstances have additional features and adjusted some logic due to the differences that exist\nbetween the two operating systems.\n\nThe Linux iteration starts by disabling the out-of-memory (OOM) killer in order to prevent it\nfrom terminating the malware. It then proceeds to check for any processes related to\nAntiviruses or other security tools that may prevent further execution of the malware. Next\nthe malware generates and saves pubkeys in a file called strom.key. The location of where\nthis key is saved is based on privileges that the malware was executed with. If the malware\nwas executed with root privileges, the key will be stored at /etc/storm.key. Otherwise, it will\nbe saved at /tmp/storm.key. The malware then tries to establish connections with other\nnodes in the peer to peer network.\n\nThe malware sends HTTP requests to different services such as\n**diagnostic[.]opendns[.]com/myip, ifconfig[.]io/ip, and myip[.]dnsomatic[.]com to**\nreceive the external IP address of the victim server. If the malware is running as root, it will\ncreate a service under systemd to achieve persistence and copy itself to /usr/bin/storm.\nOtherwise, it will be copied to /tmp/storm. The malware will then relaunch itself from the\nnew installation path.\n\nThis new process is responsible for executing the main features of the IPStorm malware,\nincluding reverse shell, which was previously seen in the Windows variant—maintaining\nconnection with other peers in the P2P network and a new feature for spreading the\nmalware to other victims.\n\n_IPStorm Linux output non-privileged user._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Linux vs. Windows Comparison\n\nComparing IPStorm Linux version 0.2.05a to Windows version 0.0.2m, it became clear\nthe developer added features and altered existing ones to attack Linux platforms.\n\n**Packages Comparison**\nThe malware is composed of different Golang packages with each package providing a\ndifferent feature. The following table categorizes package comparisons between the two\nversions:\n\n\n**Golang**\n**Package**\n\n\n**Functionality** **Linux Version**\n**Version**\n**0.2.05a (2020)**\n\n\n**Windows**\n**Version**\n**Version**\n**0.0.2m**\n\n**(2019)**\n\n\nscan_tools Scans for potential victims **+** **–**\n\nweb_api_client Handles HTTP requests and responses **+** **–**\n\n\np2p (part of\nthe web API)\n\n\nHTTP over P2P **+** **–**\n\n\nreque_client Handles the communication of peers in the\nnetwork\n\n\n**+** **–**\n\n\ncommander Handles HTTP requests **+** **–**\n\n\nstarter Implements the main logic of the malware\n(basically the “main function”)\n\n\n**+** **–**\n\n\nmalwareguard\n\n\nAntivirus evasion **+** **–**\n\n\navbypass Antivirus evasion **–** **+**\n\nbackshell In charge of the reverse shell **+** **+**\n\nddb Database **+** **+**\n\n\nfiletransfer Persistence and managing file transfering\nto other peers\n\n\n**+** **+**\n\n\nlogging Output log **+** **+**\n\n\nnode Responsible for advertising the node,\ngetting the external IP, and maintaining\nconnection with other nodes.\n\n\n**+** **+**\n\n\n-----\n\npowershell In Windows, in charge of the powershell\nartifact in the backdoor. In the Linux\nvariant, the package has only one function\ncopied from the Windows version and is\nused for achieving reverse shell.\n\n\n**+**\n\n\nutil Utility functions **+** **+**\n\nddbinterface DB functions **+** **+**\n\nproxy Implements Socks5 Proxy **+** **+**\n\n**Note: We compared Linux version 0.2.05a to Windows version 0.0.2m which was**\nanalyzed in Anomali’s report. However, the malware is frequently being updated and we\nhave observed multiple different versions since, so functionalities may differ between them.\n\n## Features Comparison\n\n**Scanning tools – Android and SSH brute-force**\n\nThe Linux variant attempts to spread and infect other victims on the internet by using SSH\nbrute-force. Once a connection is established, the malware will check if the victim server is\na honeypot by comparing the hostname of the attacked server to the string “svr04”, which is\nthe default hostname of Cowrie SSH honeypot. If the malware identifies a honeypot it will\nclose the connection, otherwise it will proceed to download the payload and infect the\nserver.\n\n_Validation of whether the server is a honeypot or not._\n\nAnother spreading method that is unique to the Linux version is searching for potential\nAndroid victims. The malware checks for devices connected with ADB (Android Debug\nBridge) to the victim node. Once identified, it will upload an Android version of IPStorm to\nthe device, which was previously downloaded from the P2P network.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screen capture from the log of the storm service showing the downloaded file._\n\n**Antivirus Evasion**\n\nBoth IPStorm Windows and Linux versions implement features related to detection evasion\nand each variant uses a different technique. In the Linux version, the package in charge of\nthis logic is called storm_malware_guard. The file iterates through all current running\nprocesses in order to find and terminate ones that might detect the malware’s activity.\n\nThe function under the storm_malware_guard package that implements this technique is\ncalled KillSuspiciousProcesses. Other functions in this package are responsible for\nobtaining information about the CPU and memory usage, number of I/O ports, and functions\nthat return information about processes and threads.\n\nIn the Windows version, the AV evasion logic is implemented in a package called\n**_avbypass._**\n\nThis technique is based on random sleep times and multiple function calls. The purpose of\nthis method is to make tracing the original process harder for Antivirus solutions.\n\nIt appears that due to the different operating systems, each IPStorm version has its own\nway to evade detection.\n\n**Reverse Shell**\n\nBoth IPStorm versions use the name backshell to refer to the feature of reverse shell.\n\nThe backshell functions of the Linux variant are identical to those of the Windows variant.\n\nThe Windows variant has a package called powershell which contains functions for\nachieving reverse shell. The same package is present in the Linux variant but it contains\nonly one function: storm_powershell__ptr_Backend_StartProcess. The function is used\nto get a reverse shell on the infected system.\n\nThe implementation of the reverse shell is a clear example of the code reuse connections\nbetween the two IPStorm variants. The screengrabs below demonstrate changes in the file\nnames and the identical function names found in the two versions:\n\n**Linux:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Windows:**\n\n**Persistence**\nThe Linux version will attempt to gain persistence only if it was executed with root\nprivileges. The Windows version, on the other hand, will always look to gain persistence. It\n\n\n-----\n\nis evident that each variant of the malware, Linux and Windows, uses a different technique\nto gain persistence since the operating systems they target are fundamentally different.\n\nThe Windows variant achieves persistence by copying itself to a random location and\nadding the program to the:\n**_HKCU:SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunregistry key._**\n\nThe Linux version achieves persistence by creating a systemd service under\n/etc/systemd/system/storm.service.\n\n_/etc/systemd/system/storm.service_\n\n_The function that archives persistence in the Linux variant._\n\nAnother difference is the location to which the file is copied. The Windows variant uses\nrandom file paths while the Linux version uses fixed paths.\n\n**Network Traffic**\nOn top of creating a reverse shell, we have detected that IPStorm’s Linux variant takes\nadvantage of its being widespread to perform different fraudulent activity in the background,\n\n\n-----\n\nabusing gaming and ads monetization. Because it s a botnet, the malware utilizes the large\namount of requests from different trusted sources, thus not being blocked nor traceable.\nThis activity was not observed in the Windows variant.\n\n**Steam Gaming Fraud**\n\n[Steam is a popular gaming service from Valve Corporation and is used by hundreds of](https://store.steampowered.com/)\nmillions users worldwide. It also provides an API for developers who want to use Steam\ndata on their own websites.\n\nAs part of the monetization process for game developers, Steam users can buy and sell\ndifferent items such as equipment, skins, and other in-game elements. This platform is so\npopular that it has become a hot target for cybercriminals. A known method used by\nattackers is creating phishing websites to lure users to submit their Steam login credentials.\nWith access to a user’s credentials the attacker has full access to the the account, API key\nincluded.\n\nWe noticed IPStorm generates a large amount of traffic to Steam’s API, querying data\npertaining to various Steam users and using multiple valid API keys.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe suspect these are stolen accounts that are being monitored as part of a fake trade\nscam. [Browse here for more information about this scam.](https://www.skinwallet.com/csgo/how-to-avoid-steam-api-key-scam/)\n\n**Ad Fraud**\n\nThe malware generates requests which imitate fake advertisements clicks. All the ads we\nhave traced are related to pornographic websites. The malware crawls through different\npredefined sites, searches for advertisement iframes, and imitates a user “click” by\n\n\n-----\n\nbrowsing through the iframes.\n\n_Example of a request the malware generates to an ad platform._\n\n_Websites the malware crawls through._\n\n## IPStorm Detection and Response\n\n**Compromised System Detection**\n\nYou can take the following steps to check if your system has been attacked by the IPStorm\nmalware.\n\nCheck if the process of IPStorm is running on your system.\n\nRun: pstree | grep storm\n\nIPStorm will usually run with\n\nmultiple threads.\n\n\n-----\n\nCheck the services that run on your system, since if the malware was executed with\nroot privileges it would create a service for persistence.\nRun: sudo systemctl status strom.service\n\nCheck if IPStorm’s files exist in your system.\n\nRun: sudo find / -name “storm*” -type f\n\nIn case of a non-root execution the output will look similar to the screen capture\n\nbelow:\n\nIf the malware was executed with root privileges, the output will look similar to\nthe screen capture below:\n\nCheck the open ports on your system and the processes that are associated with\nthem.

Platforms that are compromised by IPStorm are not only exposed to a\nbackdoor to their services but are also added to the IPStorm Botnet which attempts to\nspread to other victims. The attackers behind IPStorm are very active evidenced by the\nfrequent release of updated versions with new features and improvements, as well as the\nexpansion to several different platforms and architectures.\n\nIPStorm is part of a growing list of Golang ELF malware that have been spotted attacking\n[live servers in the past six months alone, together with Kaiji,](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/kaiji-new-chinese-linux-malware-turning-to-golang/) [Kinsing, and](https://blog.aquasec.com/threat-alert-kinsing-malware-container-vulnerability) [FritzFrog.](https://www.guardicore.com/2020/08/fritzfrog-p2p-botnet-infects-ssh-servers/)\n\n**We want to give a special thanks to Paul Litvak and Michael Kajiloti for their help**\n**contributing to this analysis.**\n\nBoth IPStorm Linux and Windows samples are indexed in Intezer Analyze and you can\ndetect this and other cross-platform malware with the code reuse feature for Golang, just by\nuploading a file or hash to the system.
