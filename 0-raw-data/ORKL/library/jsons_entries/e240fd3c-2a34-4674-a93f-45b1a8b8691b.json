While not all logging data is useful\nfor the average user, a lot of logging goes on in the background of any system. However:\nThere is good logging and bad logging. We have looked at an example of logging you\ndefinitely would not want.\n\nOver the last weeks we observed a malware variant named MassLogger which is sold on\nhacker forums and advertised via Youtube videos. It is a .NET malware classified as a\ncredential stealer and spyware, being weaponized with a variety of routines to steal sensitive\ndata from users, as well as spy on them.\n\nThe use cases for MassLogger vary a lot. However, we observed reports from\nother researchers and are confident that MassLogger is mostly distributed by phishing mails.\n\n\n-----\n\nMassLogger advertisment on forums\n\nMassLogger advertisement on youtube\n\n## Modularity\n\n\n-----\n\nMassLogger is developed to be sold to a wide variety of criminals, therefore it is also highly\nmodular. During our analysis, we found flags for various kinds of modules this malware has\nto offer. These modules are also introduced by the author. We are confident that customers\nare able to enable or disable certain features once a purchase is made.\n\nMasslogger is usually packed with various packers which implement additional techniques to\nevade environments used to analyse malicious binaries. The sample we investigated was\npacked with at least the CyaX .NET Packer or reuses its code. One more packing stage was\nadded which was able to detect whether the dnSpy debugger is attached to it.\n\nPacker stage looking for dnspy substring in process name\n\n\n-----\n\nMassLogger's settings 1\n\n\n-----\n\nMassLogger's settings 2\n\n## Credential Logging\n\nAs the trend to execute malicious code in memory continues, MassLogger also makes use of\nthis. The sample we investigated starts itself in a new process, allocates executable memory\nand injects the mentioned routine into the newly created process via Process Injection. The\nnew process starts to iterate over files holding login credentials and writes them into a new\nfile.\n\n\n-----\n\nCreated suspended process, ready for Process Injection\n\nIteration through files holding sensitive information\nThe sample writes credentials, as well as its configuration into a separate log file. It also has\nthe capability to take screenshots.\n\n\n-----\n\nCreated log file holding information\n\nabout victim's system and MassLogger's configuration\nThe C2 carrier protocol depends on the sample's configuration, the variant we investigated\ntried to send the results over SMTP to the c2 server. We also identified that MassLogger can\natleast be configured to transfer the logging results via FTP to its control server.\n\nCaptured SMTP traffic to c2 domain\n\n## Preventing MassLogger infection and outlook\n\nDuring the creation of this article, we continued to watch MassLogger and its distribution. We\nbelieve that MassLogger will spread and stay alive for at least the next months. So it is\nrecommened to keep an eye on suspicious mails, because malicious email attachments are\nstill the most popular way to distribute malware. Furthermore we suggest to stay updated on\nthe current threat landscape and read cyber security news in order to proactively defend\nyourself against cyber security threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IoCs\n\n\n**Sha256**\n\n\n8978b5eb14061436a8d2249f9c92ac75d8307c83a09ea7aa3e6572f704b4335f\n\n\nc994eb9b388217d028184b271dbd7fa098e0488f24af28d5a4ead55bf0c1a92f\n\n\n25fa4b1716f5d2995ff28002601f7fd2fc76f03831bcd642b9a2e49e92c42238\n\n\n786b5266ae016683f13abe07cb1e99c01b2d617d3ca7518da086571d9f158d1b\n\n\n335d39ae0c6e633ba50441e0b482b11d0311d09ad9a286123e6a854660518715\n\n\n**Andreas Klopsch**\n\nVirus Analyst\n\n[Techblog](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/techblog)\n\n\n-----",
