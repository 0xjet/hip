This\nwould involve tricking people into visiting the mimicked domains allowing the Fancy Bear\ngroup to see and steal login information that people use.\n\nAs well as the two think-tanks, the domains seized were associated with several Senate\noffices and services. One domain sought to mimic Microsoft's Office 365 online service.\n\n[Hunt wants 'malign' Russia to face action](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45250069)\n[Trump relaxes rules around cyber-attacks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45208776)\n[US accuses Russia of 'pervasive' meddling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45047138)\n\nRussia has denied Microsoft's allegations that it targeted the right-wing think-tanks.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was \"unaware\" of any\nattempted interference by Russia-linked hackers in the US mid-term elections.\n\n\"[Our] reaction is traditional,\" he told the Interfax news agency. \"We are unaware what kind of\nhackers they refer to, we do not know what this interference entails.\"\n\nBBC Monitoring reported him as adding: \"We do not understand whom exactly it concerns,\nwhat the evidence is and what such conclusions are based on. We have no such\ninformation.\"\n\nHe said: \"We hear confirmation from America that there was no meddling in the election.\"\n\n## Spying charges\n\nThe [New York Times suggested that the two think tanks were targeted because they were](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/russia-cyber-hack.html)\nformer supporters of President Trump but were now foes who had called for more sanctions\nto be imposed on Russia.\n\nThe International Republican Institute's directors include Senator John McCain and General\nHR McMaster who was replaced earlier this year as the White House national security\nadviser.\n\nIRI president Daniel Twining told the Times that the attacks were consistent with the\n\"campaign of meddling\" the Kremlin is known to have indulged in.\n\nImage source, Crowdstrike\n\n\n-----\n\nImage caption,\nSome of Fancy Bear's activities had previously been identified by the cyber-security\ncompany Crowdstrike\n\nIn its blog, Microsoft president Brad Smith said it had grabbed dodgy domains 12 times in\ntwo years to shut down 84 websites associated with Fancy Bear.\n\nIt said that, so far, it had no evidence that the domains had been used in any attacks. The\ndomains could have been set up to help a future planned assault.\n\nMicrosoft added that the attack activity seen around the domains \"mirrors\" what it saw in\n2016 in the US and during the 2017 election in France.\n\nMicrosoft's action comes soon after the US charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with\nhacking computer networks used by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.\n\n\n-----",
