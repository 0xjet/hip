I don't have any sample and I am quite clueless with Apple devices\nat every possible level. Well:\n\n[We don’t need bombs we got fire kites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE0qowVv21c)\n\nFortunately, the distribution site of the malware was still alive:\n\n\n-----\n\nWell, not much to do other than download the app, well the link is not directly the app\napparently:\n\nThe file is binary, but also contains strings that might be interesting. There are several tools\nthat parse mobileconfig files, a curious reader might try to parse the file for additional\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation, as this probably should trigger the download of the app after the policy is\naccepted.\nBut now what?\n\nFeeling stuck? no worries I felt the same as well. Since I don't have iOS device to try it out, I\ndecided to inspect the code of the website:\n\nOh look at that, commented code, that must be good :P\n\n\n-----\n\nWhoOpSec!\n\nThere was also a reference to a file named app.plist lets try to grab it, shall we?\n\n\n-----\n\nOk, this is plain text and simple, the software package is app.ipa, lets grab that as well:\n\nAh, close, but no cigar, this hash doesn't match the two samples in Facebook report.\n\n[Could it be a new sample? doubt it, look at the date. So what is this file? ipa obviously! Not to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa)\n[be confused with IPA.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ly8xF88rGtw/U-EknrMRncI/AAAAAAAAApI/ezoKzSVCB-4/s1600/Malka+ipa.JPG)\n\nEssentially it is a Zip file, so lets unzip that payload:\n\n\n-----\n\nI moved all the images to a folder to keep only the potentially interesting files from the\narchive, namely \"app\" stands out, what is it?\n\nAnd that, kids, how I met your malware, e567efd5c800c5b0c6eb5aa0bccc10e9, I met her\non Facebook, report.\nCongratulations, this is the first time the blog actually does what it stands for, sharing\nmalware for everyone with a hint of analysis. (if you are reading this too late and the\ndistribution site of the malware is down, no worries, it is also available at VirusTotal as a\n\n\n-----\n\n[standalone and as an archive)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e1494164865acb719c1e32c86adf810ce52fcc48c46e777b9f98a99648de62c2/details)\n\nNow you can enjoy your own copy of Phenakite and start reversing the Mach-O if you know\nhow to :)\n\n**Bonus lol's:**\n\nThe terms of service of the malware is.... [Lorem Ipsum :](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)\n\nThe privacy is seem to be borrowed from \"relatedcode.com\" which has an open source chat\nfor iOS [repository, this is most likely the chat app that Facebook was referring to:](https://github.com/relatedcode/Messenger)\n\nAll your base is on fire:\n\nMore interesting strings:\n\n\n-----\n\nphenakite.zip\nMD5: 54e5e93c00c963cb66fd2d248c4c6ce7\nSHA-1: 05527dddb79329d844f1954e3d36601926410bca\nSHA-256: c2d66369c974558adbcd801b409492b73ad1cb5f9f412ef3a8820f1cae526903\n\napp\n\nMD5: e567efd5c800c5b0c6eb5aa0bccc10e9\nSHA-1: da99195ff43093fb8237201e2ce412a925580a53\nSHA-256: e1494164865acb719c1e32c86adf810ce52fcc48c46e777b9f98a99648de62c2\n\n\n-----",
