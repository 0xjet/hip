    "plain_text": "# No “Game over” for the Winnti Group\n\n**welivesecurity.com/2020/05/21/no-game-over-winnti-group/**\n\nThe notorious APT group continues to play the video game industry with yet another backdoor\n\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\n\nIn February 2020, we discovered a new, modular backdoor, which we named PipeMon. Persisting as a Print Processor, it was\nused by the Winnti Group against several video gaming companies that are based in South Korea and Taiwan and develop MMO\n(Massively Multiplayer Online) games. Video games developed by these companies are available on popular gaming platforms\nand have thousands of simultaneous players.\n\nIn at least one case, the malware operators compromised a victim’s build system, which could have led to a supply-chain attack,\nallowing the attackers to trojanize game executables. In another case, the game servers were compromised, which could have\nallowed the attackers to, for example, manipulate in-game currencies for financial gain.\n\nThe Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the software industry,\n[leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/cconsiderations-on-ccleaner-incident/) [ASUS LiveUpdate and](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/) [multiple video games) that is then](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\nused to compromise more victims. Recently, ESET researchers also discovered a campaign of the Winnti Group targeting several\nHong Kong universities with ShadowPad and Winnti malware.\n\n_About the “Winnti Group” naming:_\n\n_We have chosen to keep the name “Winnti Group” since it’s the name first used to identify it, in 2013, by Kaspersky. Since Winnti_\n_is also a malware family, we always write “Winnti Group” when we refer to the malefactors behind the attacks. Since 2013, it has_\n_been demonstrated that Winnti is only one of the many malware families used by the Winnti Group._\n\n## Attribution to the Winnti Group\n\nMultiple indicators led us to attribute this campaign to the Winnti Group. Some of the C&C domains used by PipeMon were used\n[by Winnti malware in previous campaigns mentioned in our white paper on the Winnti Group arsenal. Besides, Winnti malware](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/)\nwas also found in 2019 at some of the companies that were later compromised with PipeMon.\n\nIn addition to Winnti malware, a custom AceHash (a credential harvester) binary found at other victims of the Winnti Group, and\nsigned with a well-known stolen certificate used by the group (Wemade IO), was also used during this campaign.\n\nThe certificate used to sign the PipeMon installer, modules and additional tools is linked to a video game company that was\n[compromised in a supply-chain attack in late 2018 by the Winnti Group and was likely stolen at that time.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, PipeMon modules are installed in %SYSTEM32%\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\; this path was also used in the past to drop\nthe [second stage of the trojanized CCleaner.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/in-depth-analysis-of-the-ccleaner-backdoor-stage-2-dropper-and-its-payload/)\n\nAdditionally, compromising a software developer’s build environment to subsequently compromise legitimate application is a\nknown modus operandi of the Winnti Group.\n\n## Targeted companies\n\nCompanies targeted in this campaign are video game developers, producing MMO games and based in South Korea and Taiwan.\nIn at least one case, the attackers were able to compromise the company’s build orchestration server, allowing them to take\ncontrol of the automated build systems. This could have allowed the attackers to include arbitrary code of their choice in the video\ngame executables.\n\nESET contacted the affected companies and provided the necessary information to remediate the compromise.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nTwo different variants of PipeMon were found at the targeted companies. Only for the more recent variant were we able to identify\nthe first stage which is responsible for installing and persisting PipeMon.\n\n### First stage\n\nPipeMon’s first stage consists of a password-protected RARSFX executable embedded in the .rsrc section of its launcher. The\nlauncher writes the RARSFX to setup0.exe in a directory named with a randomly generated, eight-character, ASCII string located\nin the directory returned by GetTempPath. Once written to disk, the RARSFX is executed with CreateProcess by providing the\ndecryption password in an argument, as follows:\n\nsetup0.exe -p*|T/PMR{|T2^LWJ*\n\nNote that the password is different with each sample.\n\nThe content of the RARSFX is then extracted into %TMP%\\RarSFX0 and consists of the following files:\n\nCrLnc.dat – Encrypted payload\nDuser.dll – Used for UAC bypass\nosksupport.dll – Used for UAC bypass\nPrintDialog.dll – Used for the malicious print processor initialization\nPrintDialog.exe – Legitimate Windows executable used to load PrintDialog.dll\nsetup.dll – Installation DLL\nsetup.exe – Main executable\n\nNote that in the event of a folder name collision, the number at the end of the RarSFX0 string is incremented until a collision is\navoided. Further, not all these files are necessarily present in the archive, depending on the installer.\n\nOnce extracted, setup.exe is executed without arguments. Its sole purpose is to load setup.dll using LoadLibraryA. Once loaded,\nsetup.dll checks whether an argument in the format –x:n (where n is an integer) was provided; the mode of operation will be\ndifferent depending on the presence of n. Supported arguments and their corresponding behavior are shown in Table 1. setup.exe\nis executed without arguments by the RARSFX, and checks whether it’s running with elevated privileges. If not, it will attempt to\n[obtain such privileges using token impersonation if the version of Windows is below Windows 7 build 7601; otherwise it will](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/)\nattempt different [UAC bypass techniques, allowing installation of the payload loader into one of:](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\DEment.dll\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\EntAppsvc.dll\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\Interactive.dll\n\ndepending on the variant. Note that we weren’t able to retrieve samples related to Interactive.dll.\n\n_Table 1. setup.exe supported arguments and their corresponding behavior._\n\n**Command line**\n**argument value** **Behavior**\n\n-x:0 Load the payload loader.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command line**\n**argument value** **Behavior**\n\n-x:1 Attempt to enable SeLoadDriverPrivilege for the current process. If successful, attempt to install the payload\nloader; otherwise, restart setup.exe with the –x:2 argument using parent process spoofing.\n\n-x:2 Attempt to enable SeLoadDriverPrivilege for the current process. If successful, attempt to install the payload\nloader.\n\nThis loader is stored encrypted within setup.dll, which will decrypt it before writing it to the aforementioned location.\n\n### Persistence using Windows Print Processors\n\n[The location where the malicious DLL is dropped was not chosen randomly. This is the path where Windows Print Processors are](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/printdocs/print-processor)\nlocated and setup.dll registers the malicious DLL loader as an alternative Print Processor by setting one of the following registry\nvalues:\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors\\PrintFiiterPipelineSvc\\Driver =\n“DEment.dll”\n\nor\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors\\lltdsvc1\\Driver = “EntAppsvc.dll”\n\ndepending on the variant. Note the typo in PrintFiiterPipelineSvc (which has no impact on the Print Processor installation since\nany name can be used).\n\nAfter having registered the Print Processor, PipeMon restarts the print spooler service (spoolsv.exe). As a result, the malicious\nprint process is loaded when the spooler service starts. Note that the Print Spooler service starts at each PC startup, which\nensures persistence across system resets.\n\n[This technique is really similar to the Print Monitor persistence technique (being used by DePriMon, for example) and, to our](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1013/)\nknowledge, has not been documented previously.\n\nAdditionally, the encrypted payload, CrLnc.dat, extracted from the RARSFX is written to the registry at the following location,\ndepending on the installer:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Print\\Components\\DC20FD7E-4B1B-4B88-8172-61F0BED7D9E8\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Print\\Components\\A66F35-4164-45FF-9CB4-69ACAA10E52D\n\nThis encrypted registry payload is then loaded, decrypted and executed by the previously registered Print Processor library. The\nwhole PipeMon staging and persistence is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. PipeMon staging and persistence_\n\n## PipeMon\n\nWe named this new implant PipeMon because it uses multiple named pipes for inter-module communication and according to its\nPDB path, the name of the Visual Studio project used by its developer is “Monitor”.\n\nAs mentioned previously, two different PipeMon variants were found. Considering the first variant, we couldn’t retrieve the\ninstaller; thus, we don’t know for sure the persistence technique that was used. But considering that this first variant of PipeMon\nwas also located in the Print Processor directory, it’s likely that the same persistence mechanism was used.\n\n### Original variant\n\nPipeMon is a modular backdoor where each module is a single DLL exporting a function called IntelLoader and is loaded using a\n[reflective loading technique. Each module exhibits different functionalities that are shown in Table 2.](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/blob/master/dll/src/ReflectiveLoader.c)\n\nThe loader, responsible for loading the main modules (ManagerMain and GuardClient) is Win32CmdDll.dll and is located in the\nPrint Processors directory. The modules are stored encrypted on disk at the same location with inoffensive-looking names such\nas:\n\nbanner.bmp\ncertificate.cert\nLicense.hwp\nJSONDIU7c9djE\nD8JNCKS0DJE\nB0SDFUWEkNCj.logN\n\nNote that .hwp is the extension used by Hangul Word Processor from Hangul Office, which is very popular in South Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe modules are RC4 encrypted and the decryption key Com!123Qasdz is hardcoded into each module. Win32CmDll.dll decrypts\nand injects the ManagerMain and GuardClient modules. The ManagerMain module is responsible for decrypting and injecting the\nCommunication module, while the GuardClient module will ensure that the Communication module is running and reload it if\nnecessary. An overview of how PipeMon operates is shown in Figure 2.\n\nWin32CmDll.dll first tries to inject the ManagerMain and GuardClient modules into a process with one of the following names:\nlsass.exe, wininit.exe or lsm.exe. If that fails, it tries to inject into one of the registered windows services processes, excluding\nprocesses named spoolsv.exe, ekrn.exe (ESET), avp.exe (Kaspersky) or dllhost.exe. As a last option, if everything else failed, it\ntries to use the processes taskhost.exe, taskhostw.exe or explorer.exe.\n\nThe process candidates for Communication module injection must be in the TCP connection table with either 0.0.0.0 as the local\naddress, or an ESTABLISHED connection and owning a LOCAL SERVICE token. These conditions are likely used to hide the\nCommunication module into a process that is already communicating over the network so that the traffic from the Communication\nmodule would seem inconspicuous and possibly also whitelisted in the firewall. If no process meets the previous requirements,\nthe ManagerMain module tries to inject the Communication module into explorer.exe. Processes belonging to the Windows Store\nApps and processes named egui.exe (ESET) and avpui.exe (Kaspersky) are ignored from the selection.\n\n_Table 2. PipeMon module descriptions and their respective PDB paths_\n\n**Module Name** **Description** **PDB Path**\n\n\nWin32CmdDll Decrypts and loads the ManagerMain\nand GuardClient modules.\n\nGuardClient Periodically checks whether the\nCommunication module is running\nand loads it if not.\n\nManagerMain Loads Communication module when\nexecuted.

The names of these modules are an educated guess based on the named pipes used to communicate with\nthem:\n\nScreen\nRoute\nCMD\nInCmd\nFile\n\n**Inter-module communication**\n\nInter-module communication is performed via named pipes, using two named pipes per communication channel between each\nindividual module, one for sending and one for receiving.

While exhibiting an architecture highly similar to the original variant, its code was likely rewritten from scratch.\n\nThe RC4 code used to decrypt the modules and strings was replaced by a simple XOR with 0x75E8EEAF as the key and all the\nhardcoded strings were removed. The named pipes used for inter-module communication are now named using random values\ninstead of explicit names and conform to the format \\\\.\\pipe\\%rand%, where %rand% is a pseudorandomly generated string of 31\ncharacters containing only mixed case alphabetic characters.\n\nHere, only the main loader (i.e. the malicious DLL installed as a Print Processor) is stored as a file on disk; the modules are stored\nin the registry by the installer (from the CrLnc.dat file) and are described in Table 6.\n\n_Table 6.

Port Monitor PipeMon uses a persistence technique\nsimilar to Port Monitor based on Print\nProcessors.\n\n\nPrivilege\nEscalation\n\n\n[T1134](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/) Access Token Manipulation The PipeMon installer tries to gain\nadministrative privileges using token\nimpersonation.\n\n\n[T1088](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088/) Bypass User\nAccount Control\n\n[T1502](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1502/) Parent PID\nSpoofing\n\n\nThe PipeMon installer uses UAC bypass\ntechniques to install the payload.\n\nThe PipeMon installer uses parent PID\nspoofing to elevate privileges.\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1116](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116/) Code Signing PipeMon, its installer and additional tools are\nsigned with stolen code-signing certificates.\n\n\n[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/) Obfuscate Files or\nInformation\n\n\nPipeMon modules are stored encrypted on\ndisk.\n\n\n[T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/) Modify Registry The PipeMon installer modifies the registry\nto install PipeMon as a Print Processor.\n\n[T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/) Process Injection PipeMon injects its modules into various\nprocesses using reflective loading.\n\nDiscovery [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/) Process Discovery PipeMon iterates over the running processes\nto find a suitable injection target.\n\n\n[T1063](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063/) Security Software\ndiscovery\n\n\nPipeMon checks for the presence of ESET\nand Kaspersky software.\n\n\nCollection [T1113](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/) Screen Capture One of the PipeMon modules is likely a\nscreenshotter.\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\n[T1043](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1043/) Commonly Used Ports PipeMon communicates through port 443.\n\n\n[T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/) Custom Command\nand Control\nProtocol\n\n[T1032](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1032/) Standard\nCryptographic\nProtocol\n\n\nPipeMon communication module uses a\ncustom protocol based on TLS over TCP.\n\nPipeMon communication is RC4 encrypted.\n\n\n[T1008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008/) Fallback Channels The updated PipeMon version uses a\nfallback channel once a particular date is\nreached.\n\n21 May 2020 - 11:30AM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n\n-----\n\n###
