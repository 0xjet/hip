The CER is one of the most comprehensive overviews of the Cyber- Espionage landscape, offering a deep dive into attackers, their motives, their methods and the victims who they target. The report serves as a tool for better understanding these threat actors and what organizations can do to hunt, detect and respond to Cyber-Espionage attacks.\n\n This data-driven report draws from seven years of Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) content as well as more than 14 years of Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC) Cyber-Espionage data breach response expertise. The CER serves as a guide for cybersecurity professionals looking to bolster their organization’s cyberdefense posture and incident response (IR) capabilities against Cyber-Espionage attacks.\n\n More specifically, the CER is an elaboration of the “Cyber-Espionage” Incident Classification Pattern as reflected in the 2020 DBIR. And as with the DBIR, we use the same naming conventions, terms and definitions. Content in this section and in “Appendix A: Frameworks” will help serve as your compass points and decoder keys for the rest of the report. Download a copy of the CER at verizon.com/business/ resources/reports/cyber-espionage-report/\n\n Using this report\n\nThroughout the CER, we present and compare findings\nfrom a seven-year perspective (content from the 2014 DBIR\nthrough the 2020 DBIR): Cyber-Espionage breaches vs. all\nbreaches. At times, we also address findings from a one-year\n(2020 DBIR) perspective: Cyber-Espionage breaches vs. all\nbreaches. All references to years in this report are in DBIR\nyears. For example, “2020 DBIR timeframe” refers to DBIR\nyear 2020, which in turn correlates with the DBIR dataset\ntimeframe of October 2018 to October 2019.\n\n\n##### Data Breach Investigations Report\n\nThe 2020 DBIR is our 13th edition, covering global\ncybercrime trends. The DBIR combines real data from scores\nof sources and provides actionable insight into tackling\ncybercrime. Download the 2020 DBIR here:\n\n[enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)\n\n##### VERIS framework\n\nThe Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing\n(VERIS) framework is a set of metrics designed to provide\na common language for describing security incidents in\na structured and repeatable manner. See “Appendix A:\nFrameworks” for more information and read more about\nVERIS at the link below:\n\n[veriscommunity.net/](http://veriscommunity.net/)\n\n##### Incident Classification Patterns\n\nWay back in 2014, to help us better understand and\ncommunicate the DBIR dataset, we grouped “like” incidents\ntogether and called them “Incident Classification Patterns.”\nNine patterns comprised the majority of data breaches back\nthen and still do so today. These patterns are Crimeware,\nCyber-Espionage, Denial of Service, Lost and Stolen Assets,\nMiscellaneous Errors, Payment Card Skimmers, Point of\nSale, Privilege Misuse, Web Applications and the catchall\nEverything Else. For definitions and summaries, see pages 36\nto 37 of the 2020 DBIR.\n\n##### Cyber-Espionage pattern\n\nThe DBIR Cyber-Espionage pattern consists of espionage\nenabled via unauthorized network or system access. Nationstate or state-affiliated threat actors looking for those oh-sojuicy secrets primarily fall within this pattern.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Industry labels\n\nWe align the CER with the North American Industry\nClassification System (NAICS), a standard for categorizing\nvictim organizations. NAICS uses two- to six-digit codes to\nclassify organizations. For the CER, we use the two-digit\nclassification level. We provide detailed analyses for seven\nNAICS-coded industries in “Appendix B: Industry dossiers.”\nDetailed information on the codes is available here:\n\n[naics.com/search-naics-codes-by-industry/](https://www.naics.com/search-naics-codes-by-industry/)\n\n##### NIST Cybersecurity Framework\n\nWe use the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) in this report.\nSpecifically, we use the five functional areas of Identify,\nProtect, Detect, Respond and Recover. See “Appendix A:\nFrameworks” and here for more information:\n\n[nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)\n\n##### CIS Critical Security Controls\n\nWe also use the 20 Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical\nSecurity Controls (CSCs) in this report. See “Appendix A:\nFrameworks” and here for more information:\n\n[cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/](http://cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/)\n\n\n### Contact us.\n\n###### Questions?

None have been\nmore challenging or perplexing than Cyber-Espionage attacks.\n\nIndeed, Cyber-Espionage threat actors pose a unique\nchallenge to cyberdefenders and incident responders.\nThrough advanced techniques and a specific focus, these\ndetermined threat actors seek to swiftly and stealthily gain\naccess to heavily defended environments. Depending on\ntheir goals, they move laterally through the network, obtain\ntargeted access and data, and exit without being detected.\nOr, they stay back and maintain covert persistence.\n\nOften, threat actors leave little to no indication of their\nactions, let alone objectives, to avoid detection and thwart\nresponse efforts. Many choose not to move immediately\ntoward their objectives, opting to embed themselves in the\nenvironment where they persist quietly until their next move.\n\nThreat actors conducting espionage can range from nationstates (or state-affiliated entities) to business competitors,\nand in some cases, organized criminal groups. Their targets\nare both the public sector (governments) and private sector\n(corporations). Their reasons? National security, political\npositioning and economic competitive advantage. They seek\nnational secrets, intellectual property and sensitive information.\n\nThe Cyber-Espionage threat actor modus operandi includes\ngaining unauthorized access, maintaining a low (or no) profile\nand compromising sensitive assets and data. Technology\nmakes espionage actors fast, efficient, evasive and difficult to\nattribute. In a nutshell, for the threat actor, Cyber-Espionage\nis an opportunity with relatively low risk (of being discovered),\nlow cost (in terms of resources) and high potential (for payoff).\n\n\n##### “The internet has made us richer, freer, connected and informed in ways its founders could not have dreamt of. It has also become a vector of attack, espionage, crime and harm.”\n\n**George Osborne, British Politician and Newspaper Editor1**\n\nIn seeking to accomplish their objectives, Cyber-Espionage\nthreat actors leverage three primary actions:\n\n- Social engineering by targeting employees through\n\nactivities such as phishing\n\n- Hacking systems and networks by using backdoors and\n\ncommand and control (C2) functions to establish and\nmaintain access\n\n- Deploying malicious software, such as Trojan downloaders,\n\nto extend their capabilities\n\nWithin the DBIR dataset, we identified the industries most\nimpacted over the past seven years (2014-2020 DBIR\ntimeframe) by Cyber-Espionage breaches: Education, Financial,\nInformation, Manufacturing, Mining + Utilities, Professional and\nPublic. We focused on these industries because they were the\nmost often targeted by these threat actors.\n\nNow, if your industry isn’t featured within this report, you’re\nnot off the hook. Cyber-Espionage threat actors may still\nbe targeting your assets and data—we may just not have\nvisibility into those attacks. If you’ve got sensitive, classified,\nproprietary or internal secrets that you’d like to keep from\ngetting into the wrong hands, turn the page and read on.\n\n\n[1 ‘Chancellor’s speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity’: public-sector.co.uk/article/ff8fa006cdcd35f4cf9ef4e030e08ff1](https://www.public-sector.co.uk/article/ff8fa006cdcd35f4cf9ef4e030e08ff1)\n\n\n-----\n\n## The ever evolving\n threat landscape\n\nTo stay ahead of cyberdefenders and incident responders,\nCyber-Espionage threat actors adjust their tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs) to embrace new technology, while\nkeeping their tried-and-true TTPs operational. Here we map\nthose TTPs to the VERIS Action varieties to give you an idea of\nwhat is in and what is out.\n\nFor example, Phishing (Social) and Backdoor (Malware) have\nserved as go-to Action varieties. Downloader (Malware),\nCapture stored data (Malware) and Spyware/Keylogger\n(Malware) have all steadily declined from the 2014 DBIR to\nthe 2020 DBIR, with Scan network (Malware) completely\nfalling off the top 10 list by the time we get to the 2020 DBIR.\n\nPassword dumper (Malware), Trojan (Malware) and Remote\nAccess Trojan (RAT) (Malware) are new to the 2020 DBIR\ntop 10 list. And, while we see that since the 2014 DBIR,\nBackdoor (Malware), Use of backdoor or C2 (Malware) and\nC2 (Malware) have declined percentagewise over the years,\nthese Action varieties consistently remain within the top five\nAction varieties for the entire timeframe.\n\n\n**Figure #1: Top Action varieties within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014 DBIR; n=282)\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nPhishing 79%\nUse of backdoor or C2 60%\n\nBackdoor 53%\n\nC2 53%\nDownloader 27%\nCapture stored data 27%\nSpyware/Keylogger 23%\n\nExport data 22%\nUse of stolen creds 21%\n\nExploit vuln 20%\n\n**Figure #2: Top Action varieties within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,465)\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nPhishing 81%\nPassword dumper 59%\n\nBackdoor 51%\n\nC2 49%\nUse of backdoor or C2 44%\n\nExport data 39%\n\nTrojan 39%\nExploit vuln 38%\n\nRAT 36%\nDownloader 32%\n\n**Figure #3: Top Action varieties within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2020 DBIR; n=114)\n\n\nBackdoor\n\nPhishing\nDownloader\nUse of backdoor or C2\n\nCapture stored data\n\nC2\nExport data\nScan network\n\nExploit vuln\nSpyware/Keylogger\n\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n91%\n90%\n89%\n89%\n87%\n76%\n66%\n55%\n54%\n53%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Patterns\n\n##### Breach patterns\n\nWhen it comes to overall breaches by\nIncident Classification Pattern for the\n2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see that\nCyber-Espionage ranks sixth (10%)—\nalbeit within close striking distance of\nfourth: Privilege Misuse (ranked fourth\nat 11%) and the sagging Point of Sale\nintrusions (ranked fifth at 11%).\n\n\nIt is important to note that these\nIncident Classification Patterns\nare just those known, reported and\ncollected. Because Cyber-Espionage\nattacks are difficult to detect, and\nthe breaches within this pattern are\nunder-reported, the number may be\nmuch higher. The kinds of data stolen\nin Cyber-Espionage breaches (e.g.,\nSecrets, Internal or Classified) may not\n\n\nfall under the data types that trigger\nreporting requirements under many\nlaws or regulations. Cyber-Espionage\nthreat actors are not typically targeting\ncustomer data, or even employee data,\nbut rather the intellectual property (or\nsecret sauce if you will) that would give\nthem a leg up in industrial espionage.\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\n\nWeb Applications 27%\n\nMiscellaneous Errors 14%\n\nEverything Else 14%\n\nPrivilege Misuse 11%\n\nPoint of Sale 11%\n\nCyber-Espionage 10%\n\nCrimeware 7%\n\nLost and Stolen Assets 4%\n\nPayment Card Skimmers 3%\n\nDenial of Service 0%\n\n**Figure #4: Breaches by pattern (2014-2020 DBIR; n=16,090)**\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\n\nWeb Applications 31%\n\nEverything Else 22%\n\nMiscellaneous Errors 21%\n\nCrimeware 10%\n\nPrivilege Misuse 8%\n\nLost and Stolen Assets 4%\n\nCyber-Espionage 3%\n\nPoint of Sale 1%\n\nPayment Card Skimmers 1%\n\nDenial of Service 0%\n\n**Figure #5: Breaches by pattern (2020 DBIR; n=3,950)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Timelines\n\n##### Attacker timelines\n\nOne of the most effective ways to\nconvey the current state of data\nbreaches and their impact to victim\norganizations is through temporal\nanalysis or timelining.\n\nWhen we look at the DBIR dataset, four\ntimelines manifest most clearly. Two\nare from the threat actor standpoint—\nTime to Compromise and Time to\nExfiltration—and two are from the\ncyberdefender and incident responder\nstandpoint—Time to Discovery and\nTime to Containment.\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n\nTraditionally, for all breaches, the DBIR\nhas shown that successful threat actors\nhave taken a short amount of time\n(seconds to minutes) to compromise,\nand a relatively short amount of time\n(minutes to days) to exfiltrate data.\n\nVictim organizations have taken\nconsiderably longer (days to months)\nto discover breaches, and an\nuncomfortably long time (hours to\nweeks) to contain breaches.\n\nWhile the timelines for all breaches\nmay seem bleak, the same timelines\nfor Cyber-Espionage breaches appear\neven more dire.\n\n80%\n\n**70%**\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n**15%**\n\n**4%**\n\n**0%**\n\n0%\n\n\nIn the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, for\nCyber-Espionage threat actors, the\nTime to Compromise ranges from mere\nseconds to days (91%, the sum of 23%,\n19%, 23% and 26%), while the Time\nto Exfiltration ranges from minutes to\nweeks (88%).\n\n\n**23%**\n\n\n**26%**\n**23%**\n\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure #6: Time to Compromise within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=47)\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n**30%**\n\n**23%**\n**21%**\n\n20%\n\n**12%**\n\n**14%**\n\n**0%** **0%**\n\n0%\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure #8: Time to Exfiltration within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=43)\n\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure #7: Time to Compromise within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,658)\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure #9: Time to Exfiltration within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,098)\n\n\n**37%**\n\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\n**38%**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defender timelines\n\nWhen we look closer, for\ncyberdefenders, we see the Time to\nDiscovery within Cyber-Espionage\nbreaches is months to years (69%, the\nsum of 30% and 39%) and the Time\nto Containment ranges from hours to\nweeks (64%, the sum of 10%, 25%\nand 29%).\n\nThe slow, methodical and lengthy\nprocess employed by threat actors\nversus the correspondingly plodding\nresponse from cyberdefenders\nspeaks to the patience and\ncomplexity often accompanying\nCyber-Espionage attacks.\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n**13%**\n\n**3%**\n**0%** **1%**\n\n0%\n\n\nthreat actor s due diligence to not only\nunderstand their target’s environment\nand cybersecurity posture, but also to\nleverage that knowledge to accomplish\ntheir objectives without detection.\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n\n**Top controls**\n\n- CSC-6: Maintenance,\n\nMonitoring and Analysis of\nAudit Logs\n\n- CSC-12: Boundary Defense\n\n- CSC-16: Account Monitoring\n\nand Control\n\n- CSC-19: Incident Response\n\nand Management\n\n- CSC-20: Penetration Tests\n\nand Red Team Exercises\n\n\n**39%**\n\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\n**38%**\n\n**23%**\n\n**14%**\n\n**9%**\n\n**3%** **12%**\n**1%**\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n\n**30%**\n\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure #10: Time to Discovery within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=125)\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n**29%**\n\n**25%** **25%**\n\n20%\n\n**10%**\n\n**2%** **2%**\n**0%**\n\n0%\n\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\n**Figure #11: Time to Discovery within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,918)\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n\n**37%**\n\n**21%**\n\n**13%**\n\n**18%**\n\n**7%**\n\n**2%** **1%**\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure #12: Time to Containment within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=51)\n\n\n**Figure #13: Time to Containment within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=789)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 03\n\n\n# Targeted victims\n\n## NIST CSF Identify\n\n\nVERIS and the Center for Internet\nSecurity (CIS) Critical Security\nControls (CSCs), as well as the\nVERIS Common Attack Framework\n(VCAF)—a VERIS-to-MITRE ATT&CK®\nFramework introduced in the 2020\nDBIR—are publicly available resources\nfor formalizing incident and threat\ndata. VERIS helps categorize security\nincidents, while CIS CSCs help focus\non cybersecurity controls.\n\nRisk analysis, asset identification and\nincident classification can inform the\nappropriate measures for preventing,\nmitigating, detecting and responding\nto threat actors while also maintaining\nthe ability to meet organizational\nbusiness objectives.\n\n\n_Develop an organizational understanding_\n_to manage cybersecurity risk to systems,_\n_people, assets, data and capabilities._\n\nA fundamental requirement for a solid\ninformation security posture is identifying\nassets before the adversary does. It’s\nonly when the unknowns become known\nthat assets and data can be protected.\nAfter all, you don’t know—and cannot\nprotect—what you don’t know.\n\nAsset identification is a foundational\npart of the risk management process,\nwhich aims to define and prioritize risks\nfor an organization. Risk managers often\nbuild matrices listing threats in order\nof severity. They also classify assets\nin terms of confidentiality, integrity and\navailability (referred to as the “CIA Triad”);\nconsider the impact of security breaches\non the organization; and estimate the\nlikelihood of certain incidents.\n\nRisk management also requires an\norganization to identify asset owners\nand asset access controls. Asset\nidentification and risk management\nshould align with the organization’s\nbusiness objectives to add value to\nthe business and help gain buy-in\nfrom decision makers. For example,\na business-driven risk management\nstrategy could include:\n\n- Defining objectives\n\n- Identifying assets and threats\n\n- Selecting and prioritizing targets\n\n- Monitoring and detecting threats\n\n- Responding and improving response\n\ncapabilities\n\nWhile it can be an overwhelming task\nto start from scratch, it’s possible to\ndevelop a risk management process\nwith smaller objectives by incorporating\ncyber threat intelligence and building\nand refining from there.\n\n\nAn organization that leverages cyber\nthreat intelligence to prioritize CyberEspionage attacks as part of its\nrisk management process can start\nby asking questions relevant to the\norganization, such as:\n\n- How prevalent are Cyber-Espionage\n\nattacks compared to other\ncybersecurity attack patterns?\n\n- Which Cyber-Espionage threat\n\nactors have been targeting other\nsimilar organizations? Based on this,\nhow likely is the organization to be\ntargeted?\n\n- What assets and data are Cyber\nEspionage threat actors targeting?\n\n- What are the common TTPs of\n\nCyber-Espionage threat actors?\n\nIf the answers to these questions\npoint to lower risk, does it mean that in\nsome industries, such as Healthcare\nor Accommodation, organizations\nshould not be concerned with CyberEspionage? Not at all. This data\nshouldn’t be analyzed without context.\nFor example, while the number of CyberEspionage breaches may be lower in\nsome industries, the impact of sensitive\nor proprietary data exposure on an\norganization in one of those lessertargeted industries could be substantial.\n\nLong story short: Just because your\norganization’s industry has not been\na typical target for Cyber-Espionage\nthreat actors doesn’t mean it won’t be,\ncan’t be or hasn’t been.\n\nTo contextualize information for an\norganization, it’s not uncommon\nto deploy an internal cyber threat\nintelligence team or to wholly or partly\noutsource this capability.\n\n\n**Identification tips**\n\n- Identify assets, asset owners\n\nand asset access controls\nas part of an effective\nand comprehensive risk\nmanagement strategy\n\n- Align risk management with\n\nthe organization’s business\nobjectives to add business\nvalue and gain buy-in from\ndecision makers\n\n- Leverage cyber threat\n\nintelligence to help prioritize\nCyber-Espionage attacks as\npart of the risk management\nprocess\n\n- Avoid complacency.\n\nCyber-Espionage attacks\ncan potentially impact all\norganizations—even those in\nlesser-targeted industries\n\n\n-----\n\n## Regions\n\nFor the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see Cyber-Espionage breaches occurring\nmost often in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region (42%), followed by the Europe, Middle\nEast and Africa (EMEA) region (34%), and North America (NA) (23%) region.\nThis contrasts sharply with all breaches for this same timeframe, as NA (65%)\ndominates, followed by APAC (17%) and EMEA (16%).\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nAPAC\n\n**42%**\n\nEMEA\n\n**34%**\n\nNA\n\n**23%**\n\n**Figure #14: Cyber-Espionage breaches by region (2014-2020 DBIR; n=597)**\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nNA\n\n**65%**\n\nAPAC\n\n**17%**\n\nEMEA\n\n**16%**\n\n**Figure #15: All breaches by region (2014-2020 DBIR; n=6,780)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Industries\n\n##### Overall Cyber-Espionage breaches within\n select industries\n\nOne way to identify industries impacted by CyberEspionage attacks is by examining overall Cyber-Espionage\nbreach numbers.\n\nWhen we look at how the industries that were featured\nin the 2020 DBIR fared when it comes to CyberEspionage breaches, we can see that some were more\nstrongly impacted than others. In particular, Public (31%),\nManufacturing (22%) and Professional (11%) topped the list\nfor Cyber-Espionage breaches.\n\nThis is a good time to point out that the DBIR dataset can\nonly tell us what the DBIR dataset knows. The DBIR dataset\nconsists of successful, reported and known data breaches\n(and cybersecurity incidents). It doesn’t cover undiscovered,\nunreported or uncollected data (i.e., data originating outside\nof the 81 contributors to the 2020 DBIR).\n\nWhile we have included more detailed, industry-specific\nCyber-Espionage profiles in “Appendix B: Industry dossiers,”\nhere we provide insight into seven industries. These sectors\nare the most impacted by Cyber-Espionage breaches over\nthe 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe and have sufficient content\nfor analysis Industry (NAICS #): Education (61), Financial (52),\nInformation (51), Manufacturing (31-33), Mining + Utilities\n(21+22), Professional (54) and Public (92).\n\n##### Cyber-Espionage breaches within all breaches of select industries\n\nAnother way to look at industries impacted by CyberEspionage attacks is the number of Cyber-Espionage\nbreaches within all breaches. For the 2014-2020 DBIR\ntimeframe, we see Manufacturing (35%), Mining + Utilities\n(23%), Public (23%), Professional (17%), Education (8%),\nInformation (7%) and Financial (2%) for percentage of CyberEspionage breaches within all breaches by industry.\n\nWe include more detailed, industry-specific CyberEspionage profiles in “Appendix B: Industry dossiers.”\nHere we provide insight into Breaches by pattern, CyberEspionage within all breaches, Actors within CyberEspionage, Actions within Cyber-Espionage, Assets within\nCyber-Espionage and compromised data within CyberEspionage for these seven industries.\n\nNote: In Figure #16 and Figure #17, numbers in parentheses\nafter each industry correspond to the 2-digit NAICS #.\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\n\nPublic (92)\n\n**31%**\n\nManufacturing (31-33)\n\n**22%**\n\nProfessional (54)\n\n**11%**\n\nInformation (51)\n\n**5%**\n\nMining + Utilities (21+22)\n\n**3%**\n\nEducation (61)\n\n**3%**\n\nOther Services (81)\n\n**3%**\n\nFinancial (52)\n\n**3%**\n\nHealthcare (62)\n\n**1%**\n\nTransporation (48-49)\n\n**1%**\n\nRetail (44-45)\n\n**1%**\n\n**Figure #16: Cyber-Espionage breaches within select industries**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,580)\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n\nManufacturing (31-33)\n\n**344** **985**\n\nMining + Utilities (21+22)\n\n**54** **230**\n\nPublic (92)\n\n**485** **2,152**\n\nProfessional (54)\n\n**166** **980**\n\nEducation (61)\n\n**47** **607**\n\nInformation (51)\n\n**72** **1,043**\n\nFinancial (52)\n\n**42** **2,797**\n\nCyber-Espionage breaches All breaches\n\n**Figure #17: Cyber-Espionage breaches within all breaches of**\nselect industries (2014-2020 DBIR)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 04\n\n\n# Essential Elements of Friendly Information\n\n## NIST CSF Protect\n\n\n##### Protective technology\n\nSome Cyber-Espionage protective\nmeasures can be automated. Data\nLeakage Prevention (DLP) solutions\nsend alerts when data leaves the\nnetwork. These solutions also offer\na large variety of features, such as\ndetecting or blocking data copied to\nexternal locations, sent by email, or\nshared using file-sharing apps and\nsites; preventing protected data from\nbeing printed; and more. DLP solutions\ncan even help identify unencrypted\ndata destinations.\n\n\n_Develop and implement appropriate_\n_safeguards to ensure delivery of_\n_critical services._\n\nSophisticated threat actors often use\nstealthy methods to perpetrate CyberEspionage attacks. These methods\ncan include utilizing compromised\nadministrative credentials or\nleveraging dual-use tools that blend in\nwith the environment.\n\nThese threat actors also deploy custom\nzero-day malware, which antivirus\nor other alerting software cannot\ndetect. From our experience, CyberEspionage attacks—using sophisticated\ntechniques; taking steps to avoid\ndetection; and having specific, targeted\nobjectives—tend to be considerably\nmore difficult to detect and investigate\nthan other breaches. Nevertheless,\nthere are ways to protect against them\neven without specific knowledge of\ntheir custom/zero-day nature.\n\n##### Access control\n\nWith administrative permissions and\na flat (i.e., unsegmented) network, a\nthreat actor has the freedom to roam.\nEven in segmented networks, a threat\nactor can find their way to the coveted\ndata utilizing mapping and other dualuse tools. Network segmentation, strict\naccess controls, layered security (the\nmore access controls the better), a\nleast-privilege practice and multifactor\nauthentication for lateral movement into\ncritical data areas can all help safeguard\nagainst Cyber-Espionage attacks.\n\n\n##### Awareness and training\n\nAs seen in the 2020 DBIR, CyberEspionage attacks rely heavily on Social\nand Malware combined vectors, using\nPhishing in 81% of the incidents and\nsome form of Malware in 92%. Training\nend users to recognize and report social\nattacks, such as phishing or pretexting,\ncan help reduce poor outcomes related\nto Cyber-Espionage attacks.\n\n##### Data security\n\nSecure the data that is most valuable\nand sought after by cyber threat\nactors. Compile a critical data inventory\nand implement access controls and\nmonitoring to ensure that data is safe.\n\n##### Processes and procedures\n\nAppropriately crafted corporate\nprocesses and procedures can help\nprotect sensitive data. These should\ncover everything from ensuring that\nuser devices are protected with\nencryption and strong passwords to\nrestricting the use of public Wi-Fi and\ndetermining how sensitive data should\nbe securely transmitted. Security\npractices should ensure safe and\nclosely controlled access to potentially\nvulnerable data.\n\n##### Maintenance\n\nCyber-Espionage risk mitigation is far\nfrom a set-it-and-forget-it strategy.\nRegular maintenance should be\nperformed to ensure that employees\nfollow proper cybersecurity measures\nand procedures so that data is protected.\n\n\n**Protection tips**\n\n- Safeguard against Cyber\nEspionage attacks with\nnetwork segmentation,\nstrict access controls,\nlayered security, a leastprivilege practice and\nmultifactor authentication\nfor lateral movement into\ncritical data areas\n\n- Train end users to recognize\n\nand report social attacks,\nsuch as phishing or pretexting\n\n- Compile a critical data\n\ninventory and implement\naccess controls and\nmonitoring to ensure that\ndata is safe\n\n- Implement DLP solutions to\n\ndetect and prevent sensitive\ndata from being exported,\nshared or copied\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attributes\n\n##### Compromised Attributes\n\nIn the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, for both Cyber-Espionage\nbreaches and all breaches, the top compromised Attribute is\nConfidentiality (100%). This is by definition. For an incident to\nmeet the VERIS requirement for breach classification, it has\nto exhibit a confirmed data compromise, which equates with\nConfidentiality. Thus, all Cyber-Espionage breaches impact\nthe Confidentiality attribute.\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nConfidentiality\n\n**100%**\n\nIntegrity\n\n**95%**\n\nAvailability\n\n**1%**\n\n**Figure #18: Compromised Attributes within Cyber-Espionage**\nbreaches (2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,580)\n\n\nIntegrity (95%) and Availability (1%) follow Confidentiality for\nCyber-Espionage breaches. Integrity, because Social actions\nimpact the person targeted (Alter behavior), and Malware\nactions impact the asset where it was installed (Software\ninstallation). These two are among the favorite TTPs of the\nCyber-Espionage threat actor. In contrast, most of these\nattacks do not affect the availability of the asset—as that\nwould likely lead to faster discovery of the threat actor.\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nConfidentiality\n\n**100%**\n\nIntegrity\n\n**56%**\n\nAvailability\n\n**7%**\n\n**Figure #19: Compromised Attributes within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; 16,090)\n\n\n**CIA Triad**\n\nFor VERIS, compromised asset security attributes\nare based on the expanded CIA Triad, which includes\nconfidentiality/possession, integrity/authenticity and\navailability/utility.

For all breaches, the next two compromised\nAttribute varieties are Credentials (Confidentiality) (29%)\nand Personal (Confidentiality) (28%), whereas for CyberEspionage breaches, the third and fourth most compromised\nAttribute varieties are Secrets (Confidentiality) (73%) and\nInternal (Confidentiality) (29%).\n\nSecrets and Internal compromised Attribute varieties ranking\nso high within Cyber-Espionage breaches comes as no\nsurprise, as these are the top compromised Data varieties\n(see “Data” section of this report).\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nSoftware installation (Integrity)\n\n**91%**\n\nAlter behavior (Integrity)\n\n**84%**\n\nSecrets (Confidentiality)\n\n**73%**\n\nInternal (Confidentiality)\n\n**29%**\n\nCredentials (Confidentiality)\n\n**21%**\n\nSystem (Confidentiality)\n\n**19%**\n\nModify configuration (Integrity)\n\n**13%**\n\nClassified (Confidentiality)\n\n**9%**\n\nPersonal (Confidentiality)\n\n**2%**\n\nRepurpose (Integrity)\n\n**2%**\n\n**Figure #20: Top compromised Attribute varieties within**\nCyber-Espionage breaches (2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,571)\n\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nSoftware installation (Integrity)\n\n**43%**\n\nAlter behavior (Integrity)\n\n**32%**\n\nCredentials (Confidentiality)\n\n**29%**\n\nPersonal (Confidentiality)\n\n**28%**\n\nPayment (Confidentiality)\n\n**22%**\n\nFraudulent transaction (Integrity)\n\n**13%**\n\nMedical (Confidentiality)\n\n**12%**\n\nInternal (Confidentiality)\n\n**12%**\n\nSecrets (Confidentiality)\n\n**9%**\n\nBank (Confidentiality)\n\n**8%**\n\n**Figure #21: Top compromised Attribute varieties within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=14,736)\n\n\n**Top controls**\n\n- CSC-4: Controlled\n\nUse of Administrative\nPrivileges\n\n- CSC-5: Secure\n\nConfiguration for\nHardware and\nSoftware\n\n- CSC-6: Maintenance,\n\nMonitoring and\nAnalysis of Audit Logs\n\n\n\n- CSC-8: Malware\n\nDefenses\n\n- CSC-13: Data\n\nProtection\n\n- CSC-16: Account\n\nMonitoring and\nControl\n\n\n-----\n\n## Assets\n\n##### Compromised Asset varieties—Short term\n\nAt a high level, top compromised Assets (n=115) for the\n2020 DBIR timeframe are User Device (87%), Person\n(82%) and Server (26%).

These\nmodels, such as the NIST IR 8179 (Criticality Analysis\nProcess Model), are aimed at helping organizations better\nidentify, understand and protect their assets.\n\nThis approach focuses on not only the asset’s criticality to\nbusiness operations but also the potential damage/impact of\nthe loss of the asset. However, many such analytical models\ntend to view assets through a single lens and don’t necessarily\nassess them through the prism of Cyber-Espionage.\n\nThis nuance is particularly important when two factors are\nconsidered. First, while the overall significance of CyberEspionage as a whole is relatively low and appears to be\ndecreasing (as indicated in the 2020 DBIR), a by-industry\nbreakdown reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nReported instances of Cyber-Espionage breaches\nhave been concentrated in certain industries (such as\nManufacturing, Mining + Utilities and Public), while other\nindustries (Construction, Real Estate) reported none at all\n(note that this doesn’t necessarily mean none occurred\nor that there is no risk for those particular industries, just\nthat none were reported where we had visibility). This\nimplies that any organization’s critical asset/sensitive data\nmanagement strategy may need to adjust to the CyberEspionage risk associated with their particular vertical.\n\nIt’s reasonable to assume that the overall Cyber-Espionage\nrate suffers from chronic underreporting. Other motivations\n(i.e., Financial) lend themselves toward having a more clearly\nidentifiable end state. Cyber-Espionage, on the other hand,\ncan potentially be associated with longer attack timelines\nand potentially unending exploitation.\n\nIn self-assessing critical assets and sensitive data,\norganizations need to ensure that their assessment criteria\naccount for the possibility of Cyber-Espionage. Specifically,\ntheir model should address:\n\n1. Overall Cyber-Espionage risk\n\n2. Assets/data susceptible to Cyber-Espionage\n\n3. Safeguards and monitoring to alert on\n\nCyber-Espionage attacks\n\n4. Preventative measures for Cyber-Espionage, such as:\n\na. Continuous critical asset/sensitive data identification,\n\nprotection and monitoring\n\nb. Cyber threat intelligence/dark web research/\n\nthreat hunting\n\nc. Insider Threat Program\n\nd. Competitive landscape awareness (i.e., unexpected loss\n\nof competitive advantage)\n\n\n##### Targeted vulnerabilities\n\nVulnerabilities occupy a huge amount of mindshare in\ninformation security. Security researchers, independent\nhackers, nation-state actors, organized criminal groups,\ncustomers and even employees discover thousands of\nvulnerabilities every year (https://www.cvedetails.com/\nbrowse-by-date.php).\n\nSome discovered vulnerabilities are reported responsibly\nand some (including their exploit code) are stashed away\nfor a multitude of reasons (most of which are nefarious in\nnature). Most application software and firmware vendors\nhave established formal programs to release patches on a\nperiodic basis, or on an emergency basis depending on the\nseverity of the vulnerability.\n\nPeriodically, organizations discover scores of known\nvulnerabilities within their infrastructure using typical\nvulnerability scanning tools and patch them based on risk\nassessment. However, threat actors leverage a relatively\nsmall percentage of these vulnerabilities in breaches, as you\ncan see in the diagram below from the 2020 DBIR.\n\n6% Hacking\n\nExploit vuln\n\n4%\n\nMalware\n\n2% Exploit vuln\n\n0%\n\n2015 2017 2019\n\n**Figure #26: Vulnerability exploitation over time in breaches**\n\nZero-day vulnerability exploits—those security weaknesses\nnot disclosed to vendors or developers—make tackling\nvulnerabilities even harder for impacted organizations. More\noften than not, the exploitation of such vulnerabilities doesn’t\nleave credible evidence on the system (although there may\nbe some circumstantial evidence left somewhere else).\n\nThere were times when zero-day vulnerabilities were for\nsale on the dark web. Due to recent enforcement actions by\nsome marketplace operators, the not-so-good researchers\nhave become less active and have possibly moved to other\navenues for financial gain and other motives. We’ve seen—\nand continue to see—organized crime syndicates or nationstate and state-affiliated actors use zero-day vulnerabilities\nto exploit systems for nefarious purposes.\n\nIt is important to realize that vulnerabilities are here to stay,\nand the typical patch-cycle mentality cannot solve this\nproblem. A multilayered approach consisting of several\ncontrols, such as robust risk management, use of strict\nleast-privilege principle, application whitelisting, threat\nhunting and deception-based detection techniques, can\nhelp protect against the invisible monster.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Hacking Exploit vuln Malware Exploit vuln|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Data\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nCredentials\n\n**56%**\n\nSecrets\n\n**49%**\n\nInternal\n\n**12%**\n\nClassified\n\n**7%**\n\nBank\n\n**6%**\n\nSource code\n\n**6%**\n\nDigital certificate\n\n**6%**\n\n**Figure #27: Top compromised Data varieties within**\nCyber-Espionage breaches (2020 DBIR; n=110)\n\n##### Cyber-Espionage breaches—Short term\n\nThe top compromised Data varieties for Cyber-Espionage\nbreaches for the 2020 DBIR timeframe are data types that\nfall outside regulatory reporting requirements: Credentials\n(56%), Secrets (49%), Internal (12%) and Classified (7%), with\nBank (6%), Source code (6%) and Digital certificate (6%) all\nstatistically tied for fifth.

These have been\nre-envisioned as Endpoint Detection\nand Response (EDR) and Network\nDetection and Response (NDR)\nsolutions. Event and telemetry data\nfrom these systems typically roll up\ninto Security Information and Event\nManagement (SIEM) and Security\nOrchestration, Automation, and\nResponse (SOAR) solutions to trigger\nresponse and containment, eradication,\nremediation and recovery actions.\n\nThese technologies have moved\nbeyond outdated signature-based\ndetection toward behavior-pattern\ndetection enhanced with cyber threat\nintelligence, automation, and machine\nlearning or artificial intelligence (i.e.,\nstatistical analysis and anomaly\ndetection). Solutions also facilitate\nproactive analysis, often referred to as\n“security health checks.”\n\nIt’s also important to remember that\nhaving the best technology in your\narsenal doesn’t help unless you have\nequally mature processes as well as\nsuitably skilled and trained personnel to\nmanage it effectively.\n\n\n_Develop and implement appropriate_\n_activities to identify the occurrence of a_\n_cybersecurity event._\n\nThe 2016 DBIR reported that, in general,\nvictim organizations seldom detect data\nbreaches. Rather, external sources are\nmore likely to make the discovery. This\ntrend remains the same even years later\nin the 2020 DBIR and is especially true\nfor Cyber-Espionage breaches in the\n2014-2020 DBIR timeframe. These\nbreaches tend to allow the adversary to\nsiphon as much information as possible\nfrom their victim for as long as possible\nwhile remaining undetected.\n\nThe questions for organizations in\n2016 were how could an organization\nimprove its Time to Discovery trend?\nHow can it avoid relying mostly on\nexternal sources that lie beyond its\ncontrol? How can it detect intrusions\nas they occur if not before they occur?\nThese questions led to innovation in the\ndetection-technology space, which we\ncover later in the report.\n\nHowever, despite some organizations\nadopting these new technologies, the\nproblem remains. A possible explanation\nis that these new techniques often\nrely on the organization having first\ncovered the basics, such as determining\nnetwork activity baselines, defining\ncybersecurity incidents and specifying\nalert thresholds, which isn’t always\nthe case.\n\n\nBefore investing in new technology,\nan organization should verify that its\ncybersecurity foundations are solid.\nSecurity strategists can accomplish\nthis by adopting the Capability Maturity\nModel (CMM) strategy, originally\ndeveloped to improve software\ndevelopment processes. The CMM\nrelies on measuring, controlling and\nregularly updating documentation and\nprocesses to limit the unknowns.\n\nDuring VTRAC data breach\ninvestigations, crucial data is often\nunavailable. Gaps come in the form\nof missing log files, undocumented\nsystems, poor data accessibility,\nnetwork traffic flows, operational\npractices, and underestimated or underdocumented data-sensitivity issues.\n\nThis lack of information not only\nhinders a data breach investigation and\nsubsequent incident response efforts,\nbut it also creates golden opportunities\nfor the adversary to easily find and\naccess potentially sensitive information.\n\nOne way to address the gap between\ncompromise and detection speed in\nbreaches involving adversaries using\nevasion tactics is to enhance detection\ncapabilities while keeping up with new\nevasion techniques. Organizations\nshould develop defensive capabilities,\nsuch as counterespionage deception\ntechniques, specifically to reflect these\nemerging evasion TTPs.\n\n\n**Detection tips**\n\n- Verify that the organization’s cybersecurity foundations\n\nare solid by adopting the CMM strategy\n\n- Ensure the availability of crucial data by reducing\n\nthe incidence of missing log files, undocumented\nsystems, poor data accessibility, network traffic flows,\noperational practices, and underestimated or underdocumented data-sensitivity issues\n\n\n\n- Develop counterespionage detection techniques that\n\nevolve to reflect emerging evasion TTPs\n\n- Move toward behavior-pattern detection enhanced with\n\ncyber threat intelligence, automation, and solutions\nbased on machine learning or artificial intelligence\n\n- Leverage experienced security professionals to\n\nmanage advanced technology\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Discovery methods\n\nIn terms of top Discovery methods for Cyber-Espionage\nbreaches in the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see the\ntop two methods as Suspicious traffic (48%) and Antivirus\n(23%), with Emergency response team a distant third (7%).\nThis contrasts sharply with the top Discovery methods for\nall breaches for the same timeframe, in which we see Law\nenforcement (28%), Fraud detection (19%) and Customer\n(15%), respectively, at the top.\n\nWhen we put on the threat actor “motive filter,” this makes\nsense. Data breaches overall are dominated by the Financial\nmotive, whereas Cyber-Espionage breaches align with the\nEspionage motive, which is much more targeted in its approach.\n\nA factor at play here is that the Financial motive threat\nactor has to contend with the Payment Card Industry (PCI)\nCommon Point of Purchase (CPP) fraud detection system.\nThere is no corresponding detection service looking for theft\nof trade secrets, which contributes to longer discovery times.\n\n\n**Figure #31: Top Discovery methods for Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=408)\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\n\nLaw enforcement 28%\n\nFraud detection 19%\n\nCustomer 15%\nReported by employee 8%\n\nMonitoring service 6%\n\nActor disclosure 6%\nSuspicious traffic 4%\n\n**Figure #32: Top Discovery methods for all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=7,025)\n\n\nSuspicious traffic\n\nAntivirus\nEmergency response team\n\nReported by employee\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nNIDS\nLog review\n\n\n48%\n23%\n7%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n\n\n**Top controls**\n\n- CSC-6: Maintenance, Monitoring and Analysis of\n\nAudit Logs\n\n- CSC-8: Malware Defenses\n\n- CSC-12: Boundary Defense\n\n- CSC-19: Incident Response and Management\n\n\n-----\n\n## Actors\n\n##### Actors over time\n\nFor the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, External actors have\ndominated Actor types, ranging from 69% to 88% over this\ntimeframe, with Internal actors a distant second, ranging from\n12% to 34% over the same timeframe.\n\nWhen we look at Cyber-Espionage breaches for the 20142020 DBIR timeframe, External actors (State-affiliated,\nNation-state, Organized crime, Former employee and\nCompetitor combined) are at 100%. This makes sense, as\nwithin VERIS, Cyber-Espionage threat actors are coded as\nExternal actors in all breaches.\n\n##### Actor varieties\n\nAttempting to identify Actor varieties is an immense\nchallenge in cyberspace. Threat actors go to great lengths\nto maintain anonymity, obfuscate their activities and\nimpede identification using bogus IP addresses (even\nMAC addresses can be spoofed), domain names, email\naddresses, file names and malware tools, among other\nindicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nThe top Actor varieties in Cyber-Espionage breaches for the\n2014-2020 DBIR timeframe are State-affiliated (85%), Nationstate (8%), Organized crime (4%) and Former employee (2%).\nThis should be no surprise, as State-affiliated and Nation-state\nthreat actors align more with the Espionage motive.\n\nFor all breaches during this same timeframe, we see a bit of\na different picture, with Organized crime (59%) dominating\nthe list of Actor varieties, followed by State-affiliated (13%),\nUnaffiliated (7%), and then End-user (6%) and System admin\n(4%). Organized crime has been identified mainly with the\nFinancial motive, one that continues to dominate our DBIR\ndataset for all breaches over the years.\n\n\n**Figure #33: Actors over time for all breaches (2014-2020 DBIR)**\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nState-affiliated 85%\n\nNation-state 8%\nOrganized crime 4%\nFormer employee 2%\n\nCompetitor 1%\nUnaffiliated 0%\n\nEnd-user 0%\n\nActivist 0%\nDeveloper 0%\n\n**Figure #34: Actor varieties within Cyber-Espionage breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,435)\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nOrganized crime 59%\n\nState-affiliated 13%\n\nUnaffiliated 7%\n\nEnd-user 6%\nSystem admin 4%\n\nNation-state 1%\n\nDeveloper 1%\nFormer employee 1%\n\nExecutive 1%\n\n**Figure #35: Actor varieties within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=9,077)\n\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\nMultiple\n\nPartner\n\n\n2014\n(n=1,477)\n\n\n2015\n(n=1,792)\n\n\n2016\n(n=2,600)\n\n\n2017\n(n=1,990)\n\n\n2018\n(n=2,231)\n\n\n2019\n(n=1,979)\n\n\n2020\n(n=3,904)\n\n\n**Threat actors defined**\n\nThreat actors are entities that cause or contribute\nto a data breach or cybersecurity incident. External\nactors originate from outside the organization\nand its network of partners and typically have no\ntrust or privilege granted to them. Internal actors\noriginate from within the organization and enjoy\nsome level of trust and privilege. Partner actors\ninclude any third party that shares a business\nrelationship with the organization and thus enjoys\nsome level of trust and privilege.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The labyrinth:\n How attribution could be wrong\n\n\nDigital forensic investigations should\nideally answer the five Ws (who, what,\nwhere, when and why) and one H (How)\nquestions. However, challenges related\nto the availability and granularity of\ndetail in evidentiary data can leave\nmany questions unanswered.\n\nCyberattack attribution in particular\nis meant to address the “Who” and\n“Why” questions. Investigators focus\non threat actor TTPs, consult cyber\nthreat intelligence reports and review\nIoCs to root out perpetrators and\nmount a defense.\n\nHowever, IoCs such as IP addresses,\ndomain names, file names, malware\nbehavior and binary code sections\ncan be misleading. Consequently,\ninvestigators shouldn’t rely only on\nthese to make a cyberattack attribution.\n\nThe current geopolitical climate,\nrecent pandemic and heightened\ntrade tensions provide a conducive\nenvironment for cyberattack\nmisattribution. This is especially true for\nCyber-Espionage attacks that typically\ninvolve tactics such as leveraging\ncovert TTPs and “false flags.” Threat\nactors associated with these attacks\nare attempting to thwart detection and\nresponse efforts, as well as conceal\nattack attribution for political and\nnational security purposes.\n\n\nOn top of that, Tor (The Onion\nRouter) networks, the dark web,\nbusiness infrastructures that lack\nsecurity, and privacy legislations in\ncertain countries further complicate\nattribution. Using cryptocurrencies\n(especially altcoins, such as Monero,\noffering anonymity) or services, such\nas coin mixers, makes tracing the\norigin of attacks more difficult.\n\nAnother very important obstacle is the\nextreme difficulty of prosecuting crossborder cybercriminals, which nationstate actors inherently protect. The lack\nof local legal statutes, regulations or\nreliable evidence lessens deterrence\nand may even motivate threat actors.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that\nattribution is a multidimensional\nchallenge. Attribution—aside from\nforensic evidence—depends on\nvarious types of intelligence, including\nforensics evidence; Technical\nIntelligence (TECHINT); Human\nIntelligence (HUMINT); Signals\nIntelligence (SIGINT); Open Source\nIntelligence (OSINT); and adversarial\ntradecraft (i.e., TTPs), infrastructure\nand intent. All dimensions must align\nfor sound and reliable attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Motives\n\n##### Motives over time\n\nFor the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, annually, we see\nFinancial motive underlying breaches between 67% and 86%\nof the time and Espionage motive as the driver between 10%\nand 26% of the time.\n\nGiven their nature (e.g., stealthy tactics, specific targeting),\nEspionage attacks can be difficult to detect and identify as\nan actual Espionage-related attack (given scant IoCs and\nother details).\n\nWhereas Financial attacks—if not detected while occurring or\nsoon thereafter—eventually become apparent when money\ngoes missing. At that point, the Financial motive, if not already\nascertained, can be determined.\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\n##### Motives\n\nWithin the dataset that shows all breaches, for both the\n2020 DBIR and 2014-2020 DBIR timeframes, we see\nFinancial motive as the overwhelming Actor motive (86%\nand 76%, respectively), with Espionage the second highest\nmotive (10% and 18% respectively).\n\nActor motives consolidated in “The Rest” (6%) for the\n2014-2020 DBIR timeframe include Fun (3%), Grudge (1%),\nConvenience (1%) and Ideology (1%).\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Financial Espionage|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n2014\n(n=1,141)\n\n\n2015\n(n=1,208)\n\n\n2016\n(n=1,419)\n\n\n2017\n(n=1,552)\n\n\n2018\n(n=2,089)\n\n\n2019\n(n=1,320)\n\n\n2020\n(n=1,134)\n\n\n**Figure #36: Actor motives over time within all breaches (2014-2020 DBIR)**\n\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80%\n\nFinancial\n\nEspionage\n\n**10%**\n\nGrudge\n\n**2%**\n\nFun\n\n**1%**\n\nConvenience\n\n**1%**\n\nIdeology\n\n**1%**\n\n**Figure #37: Actor motives within all breaches**\n(2020 DBIR; n=1,141)\n\n\n100%\n\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80%\n\nFinancial\n\n**76%**\n\nEspionage\n\n**18%**\n\nFun\n\n**3%**\n\nGrudge\n\n**1%**\n\nConvenience\n\n**1%**\n\nIdeology\n\n**1%**\n\n**Figure #38: Actor motives within all breaches**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=9,863)\n\n\n100%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Proactive defense:\n The best defense is a great offense.\n\n\n##### Threat hunting |\n Behavioral analysis\n\nAdvanced threat actors attempt\nto blend in to evade automated\ncyberdefense measures. With the rise\nof zero-day and fileless attacks, it’s\nharder than ever to protect endpoints\nwith confidence. In addition, preventing\nand detecting these attacks can be a\nhuge drain on organizational resources.\n\nCompromise happens within minutes\nto hours, as we have seen consistently\nover the years in the DBIR. This is mainly\nattributable to the use of email and\nweb-based threat vectors coupled with\nheavily automated attacks (nowadays\nalso powered by machine learning).\n\nVisibility and detection speed\ntechniques play a very important role\nin this never-ending battle against\ncyberattacks. It is imperative that\ndetection measures be a combination\nof signature- and behavior-based\ntechniques. One cannot manage or\ndefend against unknown threats using\ntraditional means. Effective, efficient\nand multilayered threat hunting can\nhelp give you a significant advantage in\ndetecting these unknowns.\n\nThreat hunting consists of:\n\n1. Making hypothesis-driven exercises\n\n2. Proactively and reactively searching\n\nfor threat actor activities\n\n3. Effectively eliminating, or at least\n\nreducing, false negatives (indicators\nthat signature-based detection\napproaches can overlook)\n\n4. Assuming that threat actors are\n\nalready present in the infrastructure\n\n5. Placing a strong focus on indicators\n\nof attack (IoAs) combined with IoCs\n\n6. Prioritizing overall threat types and\n\nlooking for the most dangerous\nones first\n\n\n##### Additional actions\n\nConsider taking these additional\nprotective measures:\n\n- Assign all users separate, unique\n\naccounts. Don’t use generic or\nshared accounts or passwords\n\n- Block outbound, unrestricted internet\n\naccess from server infrastructure.\nThis is intended to prevent\nadversaries from exfiltrating data to\nknown or unknown IP addresses and\nusing services, protocols or ports in\nan unauthorized manner\n\n- Create adequate network\n\nsegmentation to separate virtual local\narea networks (VLANs) from internetfacing infrastructure, server farms,\ninternal networks and administrator\nnetworks. Appropriate segmentation\nmakes it difficult for an adversary to\nmove laterally within the network\n\n- Restrict PowerShell and other native\n\nscripting to only individuals with an\nacknowledged legitimate use and track\nthe assignment of such privileges\n\n- Prohibit interactive log-ons using\n\nservice accounts or “break-the-glass”\naccounts. Implement a rule in the\nSIEM to trigger an alert to the security\noperations team whenever an attempt\nis made to log on to any system\ninteractively using service accounts\n\n- Require two-factor authentication\n\nfor all administrative access to\ninfrastructure components. This\nimplementation will mitigate the\nimpersonation risk and prohibit access\nusing unauthorized credentials\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 06\n\n\n# Tradecraft\n\n## NIST CSF Respond\n\n\nSometimes, the cyber threat\nintelligence team encounters stolen\ndata and credentials being traded by\ncybercriminals, and this data is all the\nadversary needs for further attacks on\nan organization.\n\nOne key challenge faced during\nCyber-Espionage investigations is the\nidentification of compromised systems.\nMany Cyber-Espionage attacks are\nassociated with advanced persistent\nattacks—multistaged attacks that\ninvolve lateral movement.\n\nIdentifying compromised assets or\nassets posing as intermediaries can\nbe a challenge. Cyber-Espionage\nattacks employ specifically created\nmalware that causes multiple layers\nof obfuscation and malware variants,\nmaking IoC-based detection within the\nenterprise environment difficult.\n\nA further challenge is that CyberEspionage attacks often leverage\nlegitimate credentials and legitimate\ndual-use tools, such as network\nmapping or remote access software\nalready being used in the environment.\nThis makes it extremely difficult to\ndifferentiate between malicious actions\nand legitimate administrative tasks.\n\nTo circumvent challenges, EDR\nand NDR solutions help identify\nabnormalities and build the IoCs\nnecessary to locate affected systems\nand infrastructure components.\n\n\n_Develop and implement appropriate_\n_activities to take action regarding a_\n_detected cybersecurity incident._\n\nInvestigating Cyber-Espionage\nbreaches differs from researching\ncybersecurity incidents. Thus, incident\nresponders and forensic investigators\nmay not initially realize that an\nattack is targeted and the motive is\nintellectual property theft. It’s only as\nthe investigation progresses and the\ncomplexity of the attack becomes\napparent that investigators take a\nslightly different approach.\n\nBefore the investigation, investigators\ncollect technical information such\nas network topology. Investigators\nalso interview network and system\nadministrators to scope out the incident\nand identify possible intrusion channels.\nIn addition, investigators collect inscope volatile data and system images\nplus all associated logs from various\nsources, such as system (including\nPowerShell or System Monitor), SIEM\nand proxy logs.\n\nUnderstanding how the incident was\ndetected helps an investigator triage\nand scope, as Cyber-Espionage attacks\ngenerally involve multiple systems\nand other infrastructure components.\nIn-scope data sources require periodic\nreview and re-scoping throughout the\nIR lifecycle.\n\n\nOne key objective for a CyberEspionage investigation is to identify\n“patient zero” and determine how\nthe adversary gained access to the\ninfrastructure. Common methods of\nentry include exploiting an internetfacing application, applying brute force\nto an account, using phishing email to\ngain an initial foothold or compromising\nthe human factor—trust.\n\nDuring Cyber-Espionage investigations,\nit is common to find phishing (or\ntargeted phishing) emails as the initial\nvector. These emails usually are well\ncrafted (industry specific) to lure the\nrecipients either to click a URL hosting\na malicious or lookalike website, or\nto open an attachment that executes\nmalicious software. In some cases,\nobtaining user credentials is the goal for\nfollow-on use in the initial penetration.\n\nBased on the information received\nfrom the impacted organization and\nthe results of the initial analysis, the\nthreat-intelligence team endeavors\nto identify an associated threat actor.\nBy identifying its goals, capabilities\nand methods, the team can develop\nattack models—based on the most\ncommon and most lethal cybersecurity\nincidents—to prepare for and better\nrespond to cybersecurity attacks.\n\nWhen combined with organization\nprofiling, unique risk identification is\npossible and can provide valuable\nassistance to the investigation to find\nin-scope compromised or affected\ninfrastructure components.\n\n\n**Response tips**\n\n- Learn how the incident was detected to help\n\ninvestigators triage the incident and scope\nthe response\n\n- Identify “patient zero” and determine how the\n\nadversary gained access to the organization’s\nnetwork infrastructure\n\n\n\n- Search for common vectors, such as phishing (or\n\ntargeted phishing) emails that lure recipients to execute\nmalicious software\n\n- Deploy EDR and NDR solutions to aid\n\nincident response\n\n\n-----\n\n## The sweetener:\n Honeypots, honeytokens, honeynets\n\n\nA honeypot is a system, or several\nnetworked systems, that waits for\nunsolicited requests. More specifically,\nhoneypots observe unsolicited\nactivity, attract possible threat\nactors and document their methods.\nHoneypots are effective for discovering\nopportunistic attacks, large-scale\nprobes or computer worms, brute\nforce authentication, misconfiguration,\nvulnerability exploits and web\napplication attacks.\n\nInformation security researchers\nuse honeypot technologies for\ncounterespionage attacks because\nthey can mimic the organization’s\nproduction environment but with fake\nbelievable data as bait.\n\nThe purpose of honeypot technology\nisn’t only to detect a threat actor, but\nto also:\n\n- Slow down the threat actor\n\n- Lure threat actors away from\n\nsensitive data\n\n- Collect information on the threat\n\nactor\n\n- Gain visibility into gaps in\n\nperimeter defenses\n\nHoneypot technology requires the\norganization to have fundamental\ninformation security controls already\nin place. To reach this higher maturity\nlevel, organizations should:\n\n- Identify crown jewels that the threat\n\nactor would potentially seek\n\n- Enable monitoring, logging,\n\nalerting and response processes in\nassociated infrastructure\n\n- Integrate information security\n\ninfrastructure components\n\n- Train employees on\n\nincident response\n\n- Segment the network and be able to\n\nredirect traffic easily, if needed\n\n\nOnce the maturity requirements are\nfulfilled, the next step is to start small\nand scale up gradually. Similar to\nbuilding an SIEM infrastructure, it is\nbest to deploy deception solutions\nbased on use cases. Start with a highrisk scenario you want to address and\nbuild from there.\n\nThe scenario can be based on either risk\nanalysis or real incidents. When using\nreal incident scenarios, it is important to\nleverage cyber threat intelligence.\n\nStart with your top identified CyberEspionage risk. Determine how\nthe sensitive data is stored (digital\ndocuments, database), where it is\nstored (file server, database server, web\napplication) and what the data looks like.\n\nIf sensitive data is stored in documents,\nfor instance, create realistic documents\nwith fake data. Then consider using a\nhoneytoken with a canary value that, if\nused, will trigger a security alert.\n\nA honeytoken can be as simple as\nan unused official email address, a\nlink to an unused server, specific\nkeywords or records. If a honeytoken\nis used, it should trigger an alert in\nthe security-monitoring infrastructure.\nHoneytokens can also be extended\nto other components such as specific\ndatabase records or invalid or unused\nuser accounts.\n\nSome organizations have gone further\nby intentionally using administrative\naccount names such as “administrator”\nor “adm-yinzer” as honeytokens. These\nhoneytokens can be made to appear\neven more enticing by associating\nthem with critical servers such as\ndomain controllers using “DC” in the\nsystem name.\n\n\nYou can extend the simple document\nand honeytoken approach to a system\nhoneypot, such as a file server hosting\nthe document. This allows security\nadministrators to detect an intrusion\nbefore the adversary reaches the\nhoneytoken document. Again, the\nsystem must pose as a standard file\nserver to lure the adversary.\n\nIf we extend this concept, we reach the\nhoneynet level, a network of honeypots.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Actions\n\n##### Threat actions\n\n_Actions are measures that threat actors take to cause or_\n_contribute to an incident.

In the 2020 DBIR, we\nmapped VERIS (threat actions) to\nMITRE ATT&CK.[®] If your organization\nuses MITRE ATT&CK,[®] here are some\nquestions to ask:\n\n- How was “initial access” gained? (e.g.,\n\nknown vulnerability exploitation, driveby download, phishing attack vector,\ncompromised credential access)\n\n- How was “persistence” achieved?\n\n(e.g., new accounts, hooking, startup\nitem, registry run keys, batch jobs,\nscheduled tasks)\n\n\n\n- How did the adversary escalate\n\nprivileges? (e.g., account bypass,\nDynamic Link Library hijacking,\nvulnerability exploitation,\nprocess injection)\n\n- Were there any indications of lateral\n\nmovement? (e.g., remote service\nexploitation, local admin account\nlog-ons, pass the hash vs. pass the\nticket, network sniffing)\n\n- How did C2 servers access the\n\nenvironment? (e.g., unknown or\nunexpected traffic or http, https, ftp,\netc.; data encoding or obfuscation;\ndomain fronting; uncommon ports)\n\n\n## EDR and NDR technologies\n\n\nUsing an EDR solution during a\nCyber-Espionage investigation can\nsignificantly increase the effectiveness\nof the investigation. This technology\ncan provide much needed visibility\ninto understanding adversary\nTTPs, monitoring lateral movement,\nidentifying persistence mechanisms\nand expediting the return to normal\nbusiness operations.\n\nEDR technology can accelerate the\nspeed of the investigation by utilizing\nbehavioral detection tactics combined\nwith IoC-based searches (in near real\ntime) within the infrastructure, leading\nto further identification of compromised\nor affected system components.\n\nNetwork traffic can provide keen insight\ninto threat actors’ breach defenses and\nimpact assets and data. Utilizing NDR\nsolutions gives organizations in-depth\nvisibility into the network, which helps\nnetwork forensics investigators gain\ninsights into packet-level activities.\nSuch insight helps investigators identify\nnew IoCs using behavioral analysis and\nheuristics techniques.\n\n\nNDR deployments give investigators\naccess to large amounts of data, which\nthey can index for rapid searches to\nidentify anomalies. This can lead to the\ndiscovery of other unidentified, infected\ninfrastructure components and help\nbuild up the IoCs needed to find more\nimpacted and compromised systems.\n\nEDR and NDR solutions can be efficient\ntoolsets for organizations to leverage\nduring an incident and hasten the return\nto normal business operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 07\n\n\n# The way forward\n\n## NIST CSF Recover\n\n\n_Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain_\n_plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services_\n_that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident._\n\nAfter-action reviews (a.k.a. postmortem sessions) should\nbe completed as part of any IR effort. This is particularly\nimportant for the closeout of more advanced IR efforts, such\nas those focused on Cyber-Espionage attacks.\n\nComplete the review by conducting a lessons-learned\ndiscussion, noting participant feedback (e.g., what went well,\nwhat went not so well and what can be improved upon in the\nnext session).\n\n\nAssemble feedback and countermeasure solutions in an action\nplan to update the IR Plan, determine additional IR resource\nrequirements and identify internal IR stakeholder and tactical\nresponder training needs. Ensure that an organization’s IR\nlifecycle includes an explicit provision directing continual\nmaturation via the after action-review process.\n\n\n**Recovery tips**\n\n- Complete a postmortem review of any IR actions\n\n- Develop a post-incident action plan to incorporate\n\nlessons learned\n\n- Ensure that the after action-review process becomes\n\npart of the organization’s maturation process\n\n\n-----\n\n## Takeaways\n\n##### Victim impact\n\n**Timelines.

Overview\n\nVocabulary for Event Recording\nand Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a\nset of metrics designed to provide\na common language for describing\nsecurity incidents in a structured and\nrepeatable manner.\n\nVERIS was crafted as a response to\none of the most critical and persistent\nchallenges in the security industry—a\nlack of quality information.\n\nVERIS targets this problem by helping\norganizations to collect useful incidentrelated information and to share\nit—anonymously and responsibly—\nwith others. The overall goal is to\nlay a foundation from which we can\nconstructively and cooperatively learn\nfrom our experiences to better measure\nand manage risk.\n\n##### A4 threat model\n\nVERIS employs the A4 threat model,\nwhich was developed originally by the\nVerizon RISK Team (now known as\nVTRAC). In the A4 threat model, an\nincident is viewed as a series of events\nthat adversely affect the information\nassets of an organization. The A4\nthreat model elements are:\n\n- Actors: Whose actions affected\n\nthe asset?\n\n- Actions: What actions affected\n\nthe asset?\n\n- Assets: Which assets were affected?\n\n- Attributes: How were assets affected?\n\n\n##### Threat actors\n\nEntities causing or contributing to an\nincident are referred to as threat actors.\n\nExternal actors: External threats\noriginate from sources outside of\nthe organization and its network of\npartners. Typically, no trust or privilege\nis implied for external entities.\n\nInternal actors: Internal threats\noriginate from within the organization.\nInsiders are trusted and privileged\n(some more than others).\n\nPartner actors: Partners include any\nthird party that shares a business\nrelationship with the organization. Some\nlevel of trust and privilege is usually\nimplied between business partners and\nthe organizations.\n\n##### Threat actions\n\nThreat actors conduct threat actions\nto cause or contribute to an incident.\nVERIS uses seven primary categories\nfor threat actions: Malware, Hacking,\nSocial, Misuse, Physical, Error and\nEnvironmental. For this report, we\nfocus on four: Misuse, Social, Hacking\nand Malware.\n\nMisuse: Using entrusted organizational\nresources or privileges for any\npurpose or manner contrary to that\nwhich was intended\n\nSocial: Employing tactics such as\ndeception, manipulation and intimidation\nto exploit the human element, or users,\nof information assets\n\n\nHacking: Attempting to intentionally\naccess or harm information assets,\nwithout (or exceeding) authorization,\nby circumventing or thwarting logical\nsecurity mechanisms\n\nMalware: Any malicious software, script\nor code that runs on a device to alter\nits state or function without the owner’s\ninformed consent\n\n##### Assets and attributes\n\nA compromised asset is one that\nsuffers from any loss of confidentiality/\npossession, integrity/authenticity or\navailability/utility (primary security\nattributes of the expanded CIA Triad). An\nincident can involve multiple assets and\naffect multiple attributes (each of which\ncontains different metrics) of those assets.\n\n##### Additional resources\n\nFurther information on VERIS can be\nobtained from these resources:\n\n[• DBIR facts, figures and data: github.](https://github.com/vz-risk/dbir/tree/gh-pages/2020)\n\n[com/vz-risk/dbir/tree/gh-pages/2020](https://github.com/vz-risk/dbir/tree/gh-pages/2020)\n\n[• VERIS framework: veriscommunity.net](http://veriscommunity.net)\n\n- VERIS schema:\n\n[github.com/vz-risk/veris](https://github.com/vz-risk/veris)\n\n- VERIS Community Database (VCDB):\n\n[github.com/vz-risk/vcdb](https://github.com/vz-risk/vcdb)\n\n\n-----\n\n## VIPR process\n\n##### Overview\n\nBased in our previous proactive IR\nengagements, we’ve formulated a\nsix-phase approach to investigative\nresponse and IR readiness: the\nVerizon Incident Preparedness and\nResponse (VIPR) process. VIPR\nconsists of six phases: (1) Planning\nand Preparation, (2) Detection and\nValidation, (3) Containment and\nEradication, (4) Collection and Analysis,\n(5) Remediation and Recovery, and (6)\nAssessment and Adjustment.\n\nFurther insight into these IR phases and\ntheir corresponding sub-components\ncan be found in the VIPR report:\n\n[enterprise.verizon.com/resources/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/vipr/)\n[reports/vipr/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/vipr/)\n\n##### VIPR report key takeaways\n\nHaving an efficient and effective IR\nPlan is the key to successful incident\nresponse. Capturing this efficiency and\neffectiveness is the ultimate purpose of\nour VIPR report.\n\nThe VIPR report is a data- and\nscenario-driven approach to incident\npreparedness and response. It’s\nbased on three years (2016-2018) of\nour IR Plan assessment engagement\nobservations and recommendations,\nas well as our data breach simulation\nrecommendations. Findings presented\nin the VIPR report culminated in 20\nkey takeaways.\n\n\n1 – Planning and\n\nPreparation\n\n2 – Detection and\n\nValidation\n\n3 – Containment\n\nand Eradication\n\n4 – Collection and\n\nAnalysis\n\n5 – Remediation\n\nand Recovery\n\n6 – Assessment\n\nand Adjustment\n\n\n**Figure #56: VIPR phases**\n\n**Phase** **Key takeaway**\n\n\n1. Construct a logical, efficient IR Plan\n\n2. Create IR playbooks for specific incidents\n\n3. Periodically review, test and update the IR Plan\n\n4.

In addition to helping organizations\nmanage and reduce risks, it was designed to foster risk and\ncybersecurity management communications among both\ninternal and external organizational stakeholders.\n\n[nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)\n\n##### Framework\n\n Version 1.2\n\n t\n\n**Figure #58: NIST Cybersecurity Framework**\n\nThe NIST CSF provides a common language for understanding,\nmanaging and expressing cybersecurity risk to internal and\nexternal stakeholders. It can be used to help identify and\nprioritize actions for reducing cybersecurity risk, and it is a tool\nfor aligning policy, business and technological approaches to\nmanaging that risk. It can be used to manage cybersecurity risk\nacross entire organizations or it can be focused on the delivery\nof critical services within an organization:\n\n[nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf)\n\n\n##### Five functions\n\nThe five functions of the NIST CSF are as follows:\n\n**Identify. Develop an organizational understanding to**\nmanage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data\nand capabilities.\n\n_Examples of outcome categories include Asset Management,_\n_Business Environment, Governance, Risk Assessment and_\n_Risk Management Strategy._\n\n**Protect. Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to**\nensure delivery of critical services.\n\n_Examples of outcome categories include Identity Management_\n_and Access Control, Awareness and Training, Data_\n_Security, Information Protection Processes and Procedures,_\n_Maintenance, and Protective Technology._\n\n**Detect. Develop and implement appropriate activities to**\nidentify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.\n\n_Examples of outcome categories include Anomalies and Events,_\n_Security, Continuous Monitoring, and Detection Processes._\n\n**Respond. Develop and implement appropriate activities to**\ntake action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.\n\n_Examples of outcome categories include Response Planning,_\n_Communications, Analysis, Mitigation and Improvements._\n\n**Recover. Develop and implement appropriate activities to**\nmaintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or\nservices that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.\n\n_Examples of outcome categories include Recovery Planning,_\n_Improvements and Communications._\n\n\n-----\n\n## CIS Critical Security Controls\n\n\n##### Overview\n\nThe Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security\nControls (CSCs) are internationally recognized cybersecurity\nbest practices for defense against common threats. They are\na consensus-developed resource that brings together expert\ninsight on cyber threats, business technology and security.\n\nOrganizations with varying resources and risk exposure use\nthe CIS CSCs to build an effective cyber-defense program:\n\n[cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/](http://cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/)\n\n##### DBIR Implementation\n\nThe 2020 DBIR best describes the implementation of\nCIS CSCs:\n\n_For those who are unacquainted with the CIS CSCs, they_\n_are a community-built, attacker-informed prioritized set_\n_of cybersecurity guidelines that consist of 171 safeguards_\n_organized into 20 higher-level controls._\n\n_One of the unique elements of the CIS CSCs is their focus on_\n_helping organizations understand where to start their security_\n_program. This prioritization is represented in two ways:_\n\n- _Through the ordering of the CSCs so that they allow a loose_\n\n_prioritization (CSC-1: Inventory of Hardware is probably a_\n_better place to start than CSC-20: Penetration Testing)_\n\n- _Introduced in version 7.150 is the concept of Implementation_\n\n_Groups, in which the 171 safeguards are grouped, based on_\n_the resources and risks the organizations are facing. This_\n_means that a smaller organization with fewer resources_\n_(Implementation Group 1) shouldn’t be expected to_\n_implement resource and process-intensive controls such as_\n_Passive Asset Discovery even if it’s within CSC-1, while an_\n_organization with more resources and/or a higher risk level_\n_may want to consider that control_\n\n\n##### Critical Security Controls\n\n**Type** **#** **Description**\n\nBasic CSC-1 Inventory and Control of Hardware\nAssets\n\nCSC-2 Inventory and Control of Software\nAssets\n\nCSC-3 Continuous Vulnerability Management\n\nCSC-4 Controlled Use of Administrative\nPrivileges\n\nCSC-5 Secure Configuration for Hardware\nand Software on Mobile Devices,\nLaptops, Workstations and Servers\n\nCSC-6 Maintenance, Monitoring and\nAnalysis of Audit Logs\n\nFoundational CSC-7 Email and Web Browser Protections\n\nCSC-8 Malware Defenses\n\nCSC-9 Limitation and Control of Network\nPorts, Protocols and Services\n\nCSC-10 Data Recovery Capabilities\n\nCSC-11 Secure Configuration for Network\nDevices, such as Firewalls, Routers\nand Switches\n\nCSC-12 Boundary Defense\n\nCSC-13 Data Protection\n\nCSC-14 Controlled Access Based on\nthe Need to Know\n\nCSC-15 Wireless Access Control\n\nCSC-16 Account Monitoring and Control\n\nOrganizational CSC-17 Implement a Security Awareness and\nTraining Program\n\nCSC-18 Application Software Security\n\nCSC-19 Incident Response and Management\n\nCSC-20 Penetration Tests and Red Team\nExercises\n\n**Figure #59: CIS Critical Security Controls**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 09\n\n\n# Appendix B:\n Industry dossiers\n\n## Educational Services\n\n\nNAICS 61 – Educational Services\n\nRemarks _Unless otherwise stated, information covers the_\n_2014-2020 DBIR timeframe.

In 2019, the percentage\nwas only 1%. While the percentage is low, this percentage\nis somewhat driven down due to the very high rate of\nRansomware (80%) financially motivated breaches that\ntarget this industry.\n\nAnother consideration when looking at the numbers for the\nEducational Industry is that Cyber-Espionage threat actors\nare known to use ransomware to cover up data theft, and in\nmany cases the threat actor succeeds in preventing analysts\nfrom determining what if any data was exfiltrated from the\nnetwork. This is particularly true when the organization\ndoesn’t have sufficient logging in place to properly investigate.\n\n0% 20% 40% 60%\n\nEverything Else 25%\nMiscellaneous Errors 24%\n\nWeb Applications 23%\n\nCrimeware 9%\nCyber-Espionage 8%\n\nPrivilege Misuse 6%\nLost and Stolen Assets 5%\n\nPoint of Sale 0%\nDenial of Service 0%\nPayment Card Skimmers 0%\n\n**Figure #60: Breaches by pattern for Education**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=607)\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nCyber-Espionage breaches All breaches\n\n**Figure #61: Cyber-Espionage breaches within all breaches annually**\nfor Education (2015-2020 DBIR)\n\n\n-----\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n\n**100%**\n\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n\nPartner\n\n**0%**\n\nMultiple\n\n\nPartner\n\n**2%**\n\nMultiple\n\n\n**Figure #62: Actors within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Education**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=47)\n\n100%\n\n\n**Figure #63: Actors within all breaches for Education**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=598)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\nSocial Hacking Malware\n\n\nSocial Hacking Malware Misuse\n\n\nPerson User Dev Server Media Network\n\n**Figure #67: Assets within all breaches for Education**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=552)\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\n**Figure #64: Actions within Cyber-Espionage breaches for**\nEducation (2014-2020 DBIR; n=47)\n\n100%\n\n\nMisuse\n\nNetwork\n\n\n**Figure #65: Actions within all breaches for Education**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=592)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\nPerson User Dev Server Media\n\n\n**Figure #66: Assets within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Education**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=45)\n\n100%\n\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n0%\n\n**Figure #68: Compromised Data varieties within Cyber-Espionage**\nbreaches for Education (2014-2020 DBIR; n=47)\n\n\n0%\n\n**Figure #69: Compromised Data varieties within all breaches**\nfor Education (2014-2020 DBIR; n=507)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Financial and Insurance\n\nNAICS 52 – Financial and Insurance\n\nRemarks _Unless otherwise stated, information covers the_\n_2014-2020 DBIR timeframe.

For the past seven years\n(2014-2020 DBIR timeframe), Financial on average was\napproximately 3%; however in the last three years, it made up\n6.3% of Cyber-Espionage breaches. In 2018, there was\na significant increase where it reached 10.3%.\n\nRemember, these numbers represent only reported breaches.\nWhen the compromised data doesn’t fall within reporting\ncriteria, a private organization may choose not to disclose\na breach. This makes Cyber-Espionage breaches, which\nare already challenging to detect, even less likely to be\ndiscovered and by extension, reported. There is no way to\ntruly gauge the magnitude of Cyber-Espionage attacks,\nespecially in any of the private industries.\n\n\n**Figure #70: Breaches by pattern for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,797)\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nCyber-Espionage breaches All breaches\n\n**Figure #71: Cyber-Espionage breaches within all breaches annually**\nfor Financial (2014-2020 DBIR)\n\n\nWeb Applications\n\nPayment Card Skimmers\n\nMiscellaneous Errors\n\nPrivilege Misuse\n\nEverything Else\n\nCrimeware\n\nCyber-Espionage\n\nLost and Stolen Assets\n\nPoint of Sale\n\nDenial of Service\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\n\n58%\n\n\n-----\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n\n**100%**\n\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n\nPartner\n\n**2%**\n\nMultiple\n\n\nPartner\n\n**1%**\n\nMultiple\n\n\n**Figure #72: Actors within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=42)\n\n100%\n\n\n**Figure #73: Actors within all breaches for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,787)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\nSocial Hacking Malware Misuse\n\n\nSocial Hacking Malware Misuse\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\n**Figure #74: Actions within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=41)\n\n100%\n\n\n**Figure #75: Actions within all breaches for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,331)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\nPerson User Dev Server Media Network\n\n**Figure #76: Assets within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=40)\n\n\nPerson User Dev Server Media Network\n\n**Figure #77: Assets within all breaches for Financial**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,238)\n\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n\n0%\n\n**Figure #78: Compromised Data varieties within Cyber-Espionage**\nbreaches for Financial (2014-2020 DBIR; n=39)\n\n\n0%\n\n**Figure #79: Compromised Data varieties within all breaches**\nfor Financial (2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,205)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Information\n\nNAICS 51 – Information\n\nRemarks _Unless otherwise stated, information covers the_\n_2014-2020 DBIR timeframe.

In fact, in the\npast three years, nearly half of Cyber-Espionage breaches\nwere reported in the public sector. And, since 2014, nearly a\nquarter of the Cyber-Espionage breaches were reported in\nthis industry.\n\nThere are a few factors to consider when looking at these\nnumbers. We know that government data is one of the top\ndata types of interest to Nation-state and State-affiliated\nactors, so these numbers don’t surprise us. However, it is\nimportant to point out that the public industry has more\nstringent reporting requirements than the private sector,\nwhich will inevitably result in more breaches being reported.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Errors 23%\n\nCyber-Espionage 23%\n\nEverything Else 17%\n\nPrivilege Misuse 14%\n\nWeb Applications 10%\n\nCrimeware 8%\n\nLost and Stolen Assets 6%\n\nPayment Card Skimmers 0%\n\nDenial of Service 0%\n\nPoint of Sale 0%\n\n**Figure #119: Breaches by pattern for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,152)\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nCyber-Espionage breaches All breaches\n\n**Figure #120: Cyber-Espionage breaches within all breaches**\nannually for Public (2014-2020 DBIR)\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\n\n\n2020\n\n\n-----\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n\n**100%**\n\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n\nPartner\n\n**0%**\n\nMultiple\n\n\nPartner\n\n**1%**\n\nMultiple\n\n\n**Figure #121: Actors within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=485)\n\n100%\n\n\n**Figure #122: Actors within all breaches for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=2,138)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\nSocial Hacking Malware Misuse Social Hacking Malware Misuse\n\n\n**Figure #123: Actions within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=380)\n\n100%\n\n\n**Figure #124: Actions within all breaches for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,826)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\n50%\n\n0%\nPerson User Dev Server Media Network Person User Dev Server Media Network\n\n\n**Figure #125: Assets within Cyber-Espionage breaches for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=374)\n\n100%\n\n\n**Figure #126: Assets within all breaches for Public**\n(2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,367)\n\n100%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n0%\n\n**Figure #127: Compromised Data varieties within Cyber-Espionage**\nbreaches for Public (2014-2020 DBIR; n=370)\n\n\n0%\n\n**Figure #128: Compromised Data varieties within all breaches**\nfor Public (2014-2020 DBIR; n=1,268)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Final notes\n\n##### Cyber-Espionage Report Team\n\nThe Cyber-Espionage Report (CER) Team is a subset of\nVTRAC combined with elements of the DBIR Team. We’ve\nspent years investigating advanced threat actor data breaches,\nassessing cybersecurity postures and advising on IR measures\nin our current roles and previous lives.\n\n\n**Managing Director**\n\nChris Novak\n\n**Authors**\n\nJohn Grim, Ashish Thapar,\nAmy Ayers, Anshuman\nSharma, Nicolas Villatte,\nDamian John Werts, Domingo\nJesus Alvarez-Fernandez\n\n##### About VTRAC\n\n\n**Contributors**\n\nDavid Kennedy, Alex Pinto,\nPhillipe Langlois, Suzanne\nWidup\n\n\nThe Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC)\nhas been assisting customers globally with maturing and\nimproving their IR readiness for more than 14 years. In\nconducting its engagements, VTRAC uses industry best\npractices—such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework—and\nour VIPR phases, as well as our expertise from the more than\n500 incidents we investigate globally each year. We cover all\nfive functional areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.\n\nOur capabilities include endpoint forensics, network forensics,\nmalware reverse engineering, threat intelligence, threat hunting,\ndark web research, mobile device forensics and complex data\nrecovery, as well as breach simulations, cyber threat landscape\nbriefings, IR capability assessments, first responder training,\nand IR Plan and playbook development.\n\nVTRAC has written the book—literally—on data breaches,\nfrom starting the DBIR phenomenon and contributing annually\nto the Payment Security Report to creating the Data Breach\nDigests, Insider Threat Report, Incident Preparedness and\nResponse Report and now the CER.\n\nWith the CER now under our proverbial belts, the only\nquestion left unanswered is:\n\nWhat will VTRAC set its sights on next? Stay tuned to find\n_out..._\n\n##### About the cover\n\nCyber-Espionage breaches occur when external attackers,\nsuch as State-affiliated or Nation-state threat actors,\npenetrate victim organization cyberdefenses to steal sensitive\ndata or proprietary information. The cover image for our firstever Cyber-Espionage Report depicts a Cyber-Espionage\nbreach at the moment the attacker pierces the veil of security\nen route to plundering their targeted victim’s critical assets\nand most sensitive information.\n\n\n##### Verizon thought leadership\n\n**Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)**\n\n        - Data Breaches/Cybersecurity Incidents\n\n         - 9 x Incident Classification Patterns |\n\n9 x CIS CSCs\n\n[• enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)\n\n[dbir/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)\n\n**Mobile** **Mobile Security Index (MSI)**\n**Security**\n**Index**\n\n**2020 Report**  - Mobile Devices/IoT/Wi-Fi Security Insight\n\n         - 5 x Fortify Levels\n\n[• enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/mobile-security-index/)\n\n[mobile-security-index/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/mobile-security-index/)\n\n**InsiderThreat** **Insider Threat Report (ITR)**\n**ReportOut of sightshould never beout of mind**       - Insider Threat Breaches/Cybersecurity\n\nIncidents\n\n         - 5 x Breach Scenarios |\n\n11 x Countermeasures\n\n**business ready** [• enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/insider-threat-report/)\n\n[insider-threat-report/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/insider-threat-report/)\n\n**IncidentPreparedness** **Verizon Insider Preparedness and**\n**and Response**\n**ReportTaming the databreach. beast** **Response (VIPR) Report**\n\n        - IR Plan review and breach simulation\n\nexercise insight\n\n        - 5 x Breach Scenarios | 6 x VIPR Phases |\n\nA publication written by practitioners for practitioners. 20 x Key Takeaways\n\n[• enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/vipr/)\n\n[vipr/](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/vipr/)\n\n**Payment Security Report (PSR)**\n\n**Payment Security Report**    - PCI Assessment/PFI Investigation Insight\n\n        - 12 x PCI DSS Requirements\n\n[• verizon.com/business/resources/reports/](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/payment-security-report/)\n\n[payment-security-report/](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/payment-security-report/)\n\n\n**Payment Security Report**\n\n\nout of mind\n\n\n-----\n\ni /b i / [/](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/cyber-espionage-report/) t / b i t/\n\n\n-----",
