The Dark Ops team scours the dark web, extending visibility and\nengagement into places traditional security teams can’t reach to share meaningful and\ninsightful intelligence on the trends and tactics threat actors are leveraging across the dark\nweb and criminal underground. Here’s the latest for the week of December 23, 2022.\n\n## Rebranded Ransomware-As-A-Service Project Advertised\n\nUntested threat actor “nebel” advertised what they claim is a new ransomware-as-a-service\n(RaaS) project, dubbed “Nevada,” on the Russian language Dark Web forum “RAMP.”\nDespite the actor’s claims the project is new, ZeroFox researchers assess this is likely a\nrebranded version of an older RaaS project, dubbed “Luna,” because the two have nearly\nidentical features, including:\n\nWritten in Rust\n\n\n-----\n\nUses AES and ECC encryption\nWorks on systems running Windows, Linux, and ESXI\nControlled via administrator panel\nContains real-time chat to negotiate with victims\n\nLike the old project, the actor refuses to work with English-speaking threat actors. They also\noffered to split any successful ransom payments 85 to 15 in favor of affiliates, which is\nnotable because most ransomware developers typically offer affiliates a smaller cut of the\nprofits.\n\nZeroFox researchers assess the actor likely rebranded the initial “Luna” RaaS project\nbecause it failed to attract affiliates, indicating it is highly likely that there is a lull in interest\nfrom threat actors in the current ransomware market.\n\nOriginal post from\n\nthreat actor “nebel” advertising what they claim is a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nproject, dubbed “Nevada”\n\n## Actor Sells Access To ATM Management Software For Unnamed European Bank\n\nIn early December 2022, untested threat actor “theskull77” sold access to the ATM\nmanagement software for an unnamed European bank on the predominantly Russian\nlanguage forum “Exploit.” The alleged deal would allow threat actors to exploit a SQL\ninjection vulnerability to steal sensitive data from the backend of the bank’s ATM network,\nincluding the balances and locations of various ATM machines. The actor said that operators\ncan also restart the ATMs, which would likely allow a skilled threat actor to compromise the\nmachines with malware and steal cash from the devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe asking price for the access started at $100,000 USD, indicating the alleged buyer would\nlikely expect to net a significant return on their investment.\n\nZeroFox researchers assess the actor is credible because they agreed to use the forum’s\nescrow service, which would require them to deposit funds before a deal was brokered.\n\n## Threat Actors Abusing Malware Loader Developed As Penetration Testing Tool\n\nNew and untested threat actor “DarkBLUP” advertised a malware loader dubbed “Ares” on\nthe Russian language Dark Web forum “RAMP.” ZeroFox researchers assess this loader is\nlikely a legitimate penetration testing tool that is now being abused by threat actors. This is\nbecause of a similar project, dubbed “Project Ares,” was previously uploaded to GitHub as a\nproof-of-concept (PoC) by the well-regarded user and red teamer “CerberSec.”\n\nThe loader mimics legitimate software to trick victims into the executing malware with\nadministrator rights on their machines.. Additional features of the loader include:\n\nWritten in C/C++\nSupports 64-bit payloads\nMakes it look like malware spawned by another process\nPrevents non-Microsoft signed binaries from being injected into malware\nHides suspicious imported Windows APIs\nLeverages anti-analysis techniques to avoid reverse engineering\n\nThe actor had ten licenses available for $300 USD per month.\n\n\n-----\n\nOriginal post from\n\nthreat actor “DarkBLUP” advertising a malware loader dubbed “Ares” on the predominantly\nRussian language Dark Web forum “RAMP”\n\n## Bundle Contains Exploits For Unpatched Vulnerabilities In Different Services\n\nWell-regarded and established threat actor “LORD1” advertised a bundle containing exploits\nfor unpatched vulnerabilities in different services, including Fortinet, Windows, Linux,\nAtlassian Bitbucket, VMware, and Oracle, on the predominantly Russian language Deep\nWeb forum “Exploit.” The alleged exploits impact various remote code execution (RCE)\nvulnerabilities, tracked as:\n\nCVE-2022-40684 (Fortinet)\nCVE-2022-36804 (Atlassian Bitbucket)\nCVE-2021-39144, CVE-2022-31675, CVE-2022-22960 (VMware)\nCVE-2022-21497, CVE-2021-35587 (Oracle)\n\nAdditionally, the bundle contains exploits for several undisclosed local privilege escalation\n(LPE) vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux.\n\nThe actor charged $4,000 USD for the bundle. They also had exploits for unpatched\nvulnerabilities in Veeam and Apache. The actor did not specify a price for these exploits.\n\nZeroFox researchers assess the sale of this bundle would likely lower the barrier to entry for\nthreat actors because the exploits come with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and\nan integrated post-exploitation toolkit.\n\nOriginal post from\n\nthreat actor “LORD1” advertising a bundle containing exploits for unpatched vulnerabilities in\ndifferent services\n\n\n-----\n\nFor more insights and information on improving your threat intelligence strategy, download\nour Buyers Guide for Threat Intelligence.\n\n**Tags:** [Dark Ops\n,](https://www.zerofox.com/topic/dark-ops/) [Deep & Dark Web\n,](https://www.zerofox.com/topic/deep-web-and-dark-web/) [Threat Intelligence](https://www.zerofox.com/topic/threat-intelligence/)\n\n\n-----",
