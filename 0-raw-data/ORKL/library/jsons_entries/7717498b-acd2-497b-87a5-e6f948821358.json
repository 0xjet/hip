    "plain_text": "The BlackEnergy malware is crimeware turned APT tool and is used in significant geopolitical operations\n\nlightly documented over the past year. An even more interesting part of the BlackEnergy story is the\n\nrelatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM and MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco\n\nnetwork devices, destructive plugins, a certificate stealer and more. Here, we present available data - it is\n\ndifficult to collect on this APT. We will also present more details on targets previously unavailable and\n\npresent related victim profile data.\n\nThese attackers are careful to hide and defend their long-term presence within compromised\n\nenvironments. The malware's previously undescribed breadth means attackers present new technical\n\nchallenges in unusual environments, including SCADA networks. Challenges, like mitigating the attackers'\n\nlateral movement across compromised network routers, may take an organization's defenders far beyond\n\ntheir standard routine and out of their comfort zone.\n\n## Brief History\n\nBlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 are known tools. Initially, cybercriminals used BlackEnergy custom\n\nplugins for launching DDoS attacks. There are no indications of how many groups possess this tool.\n\nBlackEnergy2 was eventually seen downloading more crimeware plugins - a custom spam plugin and a\n\nbanking information stealer custom plugin. Over time, BlackEnergy2 was assumed into the toolset of the\n\nBE2/Sandworm actor. While another crimeware group continues to use BlackEnergy to launch DDoS\n\nattacks, the BE2 APT appears to have used this tool exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and\n\nincluded custom plugins and scripts of their own. To be clear, our name for this actor has been the BE2\n\nAPT, while it has been called \"Sandworm Team\" also.\n\n## The Plugins and Config Files\n\nBefore evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange activity on one\n\nof the BlackEnergy CnC servers in 2013. This strangeness was related to values listed in\n\n[newer BlackEnergy configuration files. As described in Dmitry's 2010 Black DDoS' analysis, a](http://securelist.com/analysis/36309/black-ddos/)\n\nconfiguration file is downloaded from the server by main.dll on an infected system. The config file\n\nprovides download instructions for the loader. It also instructs the loader to pass certain commands to the\n\nplugins. In this particular case in 2013, the config file included an unknown plugin set, aside from the\n\nusual 'ddos' plugin listing. Displayed below are these new, xml formatted plugin names \"weap_hwi\", \"ps\",\n\nand \"vsnet\" in a BlackEnergy configuration file download from a c2 server. This new module push must\n\nhave been among the first for this group, because all of the module versions were listed as \"version 1\",\n\nincluding the ddos plugin:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Config downloaded from BE2 server_\n\nThe 'ps' plugin turned out to be password stealer. The 'vsnet' plugin was intended to spread and launch a\n\npayload (BlackEnergy2 dropper itself at the moment) in the local network by using PsExec, as well as\n\ngaining primary information on the user's computer and network. Most surprising was the 'weap_hwi'\n\nplugin. It was a ddos tool compiled to run on ARM systems:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Weap_hwi plugin_\n\nAt first, we didn't know whether the ARM plugin was listed intentionally or by mistake, so we proceeded to\n\ncollect the CnC's config files. After pulling multiple config files, we confirmed that this ARM object\n\ninclusion was not a one-off mistake. The server definitely delivered config files not only for Windows, but\n\nalso for the ARM/MIPS platform. Though unusual, the ARM module was delivered by the same server and\n\nit processed the same config file.\n\n## Linux plugins\n\nOver time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and MIPS\n\narchitectures. All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source and later pushed\n\nout in one config: \"weap_msl\", \"weap_mps\", \"nm_hwi\", \"nm_mps\", \"weap_hwi\", and \"nm_msl\". It's\n\ninteresting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos plugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi,\n\nnm_mps, and nm_msl plugins. They simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and\n\nweap_hmi plugins. Those assignments were not likely arbitrary, as this group had developed\n\nBlackEnergy2 for several years in a professional and organized style:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Config with a similar set of plugins for different architectures_\n\nHere is the list of retrieved files and related functionality:\n\n|weap|DDoS Attack (various types)|\n|---|---|\n|ps|password stealer handling a variety of network protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, Telnet)|\n|nm|scans ports, stores banners|\n|snif|logs IP source and destination, TCP/UDP ports|\n|hook|main module: CnC communication, config parser, plugins loader|\n|uper|rewrites hook module with a new version and launches it|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Weap, Snif, Nm plugin grammar mistakes and mis-spellings_\n\nThe developers' coding style differed across the 'Hook' main module, the plugins, and the Windows\n\nmain.dll. The hook main module contained encrypted strings and handled all the function calls and\n\nstrings as the references in a large structure. This structure obfuscation may be a rewrite effort to better\n\nmodularize the code, but could also be intended to complicate analysis. Regardless, it is likely that\n\ndifferent individuals coded the different plugins. So, the BE2 effort must have its own small team of plugin\n\nand multiplatform developers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hook module structure_\n\nAfter decrypting the strings, it became clear that the Linux Hook main module communicated with the\n\nsame CnC server as other Windows modules:\n\n_The CNC's IP address in the Linux module_\n\n\n-----\n\nversion:\n\n**die** delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces\n\n**kill** delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces and reboot\n\n**lexec** launch a command using bin/sh\n\n**rexec** download and launch file using 'fork/exec'\n\n**update** rewrite self file\n\n**migrate** update the CnC server\n\n## Windows Plugins\n\nAfter the disclosure of an unusual CnC server that pushed Linux and the new Windows plugins we paid\n\ngreater attention to new BE2 samples and associated CnCs.\n\nDuring an extended period, we were able to collect many Windows plugins from different CnC servers,\n\nwithout ever noticing Linux plugins being downloaded as described above. It appears the BE2/SandWorm\n\ngang protected their servers by keeping their non-Windows hacker tools and plugins in separate servers or\n\nserver folders. Finally, each CnC server hosts a different set of plugins, meaning that each server works\n\nwith different victims and uses plugins based on its current needs. Here is the summary list of all known\n\nplugins at the moment:\n\nsearches for given file types, gets primary system and network\n**fs**\ninformation\n\n**ps** password stealer from various sources\n\n**ss** makes screenshots\n\nspreads payload in the local network (uses psexec, accesses admin\n**vsnet**\nshares), gets primary system and network information\n\n**rd** remote desktop\n\n**scan** scans ports of a given host\n\n**grc** backup channel via plus.google.com\n\nfile infector (local, shares, removable devices) with the given payload\n**jn**\ndownloaded from CnC\n\n**cert** certificate stealer\n\nlogs traffic, extracts login-passwords from different protocol (HTTP,\n**sn**\nLDAP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet )\n\n**tv** sets password hash in the registry for TeamViewer\n\n**prx** Proxy server\n\nDestroys hard disk by overwriting with random data (on application level\n**dstr**\nand driver level) at a certain time\n\n**kl** keylogger\n\n**upd** BE2 service file updater\n\n|die|delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces|\n|---|---|\n|kill|delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces and reboot|\n|lexec|launch a command using bin/sh|\n|rexec|download and launch file using 'fork/exec'|\n|update|rewrite self file|\n|migrate|update the CnC server|\n\n|fs|searches for given file types, gets primary system and network information|\n|---|---|\n|ps|password stealer from various sources|\n|ss|makes screenshots|\n|vsnet|spreads payload in the local network (uses psexec, accesses admin shares), gets primary system and network information|\n|rd|remote desktop|\n|scan|scans ports of a given host|\n|grc|backup channel via plus.google.com|\n|jn|file infector (local, shares, removable devices) with the given payload downloaded from CnC|\n|cert|certificate stealer|\n|sn|logs traffic, extracts login-passwords from different protocol (HTTP, LDAP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet )|\n|tv|sets password hash in the registry for TeamViewer|\n|prx|Proxy server|\n|dstr|Destroys hard disk by overwriting with random data (on application level and driver level) at a certain time|\n|kl|keylogger|\n\n\n-----\n\n**bios** gathers information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, OS\n\nWe are pretty sure that our list of BE2 tools is not complete. For example, we have yet to obtain the router\n\naccess plugin, but we are confident that it exists. Evidence also supports the hypothesis that there is a\n\ndecryption plugin for victim files (see below).\n\nOur current collection represents the BE2 attackers' capabilities quite well. Some plugins\n\nremain mysterious and their purpose is not yet clear, like 'usb' and 'bios'. Why would the attackers need\n\ninformation on usb and bios characteristics? It suggests that based on a specific USB and BIOS devices,\n\nthe attackers may upload specific plugins to carry out additional actions. Perhaps destructive, perhaps to\n\nfurther infect devices. We don't know yet.\n\nIt's also interesting to point out another plugin – 'grc'. In some of the BE2 configuration files, we can\n\nnotice an value with a \"gid\" type:\n\n_The addr number in the config_\n\nThis number is an ID for the plus.google.com service and is used by the 'grc' plugin to parse html. It then\n\ndownloads and decrypts a PNG file. The decrypted PNG is supposed to contain a new CNC address, but we\n\nnever observed one. We are aware of two related GooglePlus IDs. The first one,\n\nplus.google.com/115125387226417117030/, contains an abnormal number of views. At the time of writing,\n\nthe count is 75 million:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 plus profile_\n\nThe second one - plus.google.com/116769597454024178039/posts - is currently more modest at a little\n\nover 5,000 views. All of that account's posts are deleted.\n\n## Tracked Commands\n\nDuring observation of the described above \"router-PC\" CnC we tracked the following commands delivered\n\nin the config file before the server went offline. Our observation of related actions here:\n\n**u ps** start password stealing (Windows)\n\n**Ps_mps/ps_hwi start** start password stealing (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\nrewrite hook module with a new version and launch it\n**uper_mps/uper_hwi start**\n(Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n**Nm_mps/nm_hwi start –** Scan ports and retrieve banners on the router subnet\n**ban -middle** (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n**U fsget * 7 *.docx, *.pdf,**\nsearch for docs with the given filetypes (Windows)\n***.doc ***\n\nretrieve information on installed programs and launch\n\n**S sinfo** commands: systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, netstat, route\n\ntable, trace route to google.com (Windows)\n\n**weap_mps/weap_hwi**\n**host188.128.123.52**\n\nDDoS on 188.128.123.52 (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n**port[25,26,110,465,995]**\n**typetcpconnect**\n\n**weap_mps/weap_hwi**\n**typesynflood port80**\n\nDDoS on 212.175.109.10 (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n**cnt100000 spdmedium**\n**host212.175.109.10**\n\nThe issued commands for the Linux plugins suggest the attackers controlled infected MIPS/ARM\n\ndevices. We want to pay special attention to the DDoS commands meant for these routers. 188.128.123.52\n\nbelongs to the Russian Ministry of Defense and 212.175.109.10 belongs to the Turkish Ministry of\n\nInterior's government site. While many researchers suspect a Russian actor is behind BE2, judging by\n\ntheir tracked activities and the victim profiles, it's still unclear whose interests they represent.\n\n|u ps|start password stealing (Windows)|\n|---|---|\n|Ps_mps/ps_hwi start|start password stealing (Linux, MIPS, ARM)|\n|uper_mps/uper_hwi start|rewrite hook module with a new version and launch it (Linux, MIPS, ARM)|\n|Nm_mps/nm_hwi start – ban -middle|Scan ports and retrieve banners on the router subnet (Linux, MIPS, ARM)|\n|U fsget * 7 *.docx, *.pdf, *.doc *|search for docs with the given filetypes (Windows)|\n|S sinfo|retrieve information on installed programs and launch commands: systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, netstat, route table, trace route to google.com (Windows)|\n|weap_mps/weap_hwi host188.128.123.52 port[25,26,110,465,995] typetcpconnect|DDoS on 188.128.123.52 (Linux, MIPS, ARM)|\n|weap_mps/weap_hwi typesynflood port80 cnt100000 spdmedium host212.175.109.10|DDoS on 212.175.109.10 (Linux, MIPS, ARM)|\n\n\n-----\n\nand mis-typing. They are highlighted in the image below:\n\n_BE2 config file mistakes_\n\nFirst, these mistakes suggest that the BE2 attackers manually edit these config files. Secondly, it shows\n\nthat even skilled hackers make mistakes.\n\n## Hard-Coded Command and Control\n\nThe contents of the config files themselves are fairly interesting. They all contain a callback c2 with a\n\nhardcoded ip address, some contain timeouts, and some contain the commands listed above. We include a\n\nlist of observed hardcoded ip C2 addresses here, along with the address owner and geophysical location of\n\nthe host:\n\n**C2 IP address** **Owner** **Country**\n\n184.22.205.194 hostnoc.net US\n\n5 79 80 166 Leaseweb NL\n\n|C2 IP address|Owner|Country|\n|---|---|---|\n|184.22.205.194|hostnoc.net|US|\n\n\n-----\n\n|95.211.122.36|Leaseweb|NL|\n|---|---|---|\n|46.165.222.101|Leaseweb|NL|\n|46.165.222.6|Leaseweb|NL|\n|89.149.223.205|Leaseweb|NL|\n|85.17.94.134|Leaseweb|NL|\n|46.4.28.218|Hetzner|DE|\n|78.46.40.239|Hetzner|DE|\n|95.143.193.182|Serverconnect|SE|\n|188.227.176.74|Redstation|GB|\n|93.170.127.100|Nadym|RU|\n|37.220.34.56|Yisp|NL|\n|194.28.172.58|Besthosting.ua|UA|\n|124.217.253.10|PIRADIUS|MY|\n|84.19.161.123|Keyweb|DE|\n|109.236.88.12|worldstream.nl|NL|\n|212.124.110.62|digitalone.com|US|\n|5.61.38.31|3nt.com|DE|\n|5.255.87.39|serverius.com|NL|\n\n\nIt's interesting that one of these servers is a Tor exit node. And, according to the collected config files, the\n\ngroup upgraded their malware communications from plain text http to encrypted https in October 2013.\n\n## BE2 Targets and Victims\n\nBlackEnergy2 victims are widely distributed geographically. We identified BlackEnergy2 targets and\n\nvictims in the following countries starting in late 2013. There are likely more victims.\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nPoland\n\nLithuania\n\nBelarus\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nKyrgyzstan\n\nKazakhstan\n\nIran\n\nIsrael\n\nTurkey\n\n\n-----\n\nKuwait\n\nTaiwan\n\nVietnam\n\nIndia\n\nCroatia\n\nGermany\n\nBelgium\n\nSweden\n\nVictim profiles point to an expansive interest in ICS:\n\npower generation site owners\n\npower facilities construction\n\npower generation operators\n\nlarge suppliers and manufacturers of heavy power related materials\n\ninvestors\n\nHowever, we also noticed that the target list includes government, property holding, and technology\n\norganizations as well:\n\nhigh level government\n\nother ICS construction\n\nfederal land holding agencies\n\nmunicipal offices\n\nfederal emergency services\n\nspace and earth measurement and assessment labs\n\nnational standards body\n\nbanks\n\nhigh-tech transportation\n\nacademic research\n\n## Victim cases\n\nWe gained insight into significant BE2 victim profiles over the summer of 2014. Interesting BE2 incidents\n\nare presented here.\n\n**Victim #1**\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE, and a metasploit module has been available This email message contained a ZIP archive with EXE\n\nfile inside that did not appear to be an executable. This crafted zip archive exploited a WinRAR flaw that\n\nmakes files in zip archives appear to have a different name and file extension.\n\n_BE2 spearphish example_\n\nThe attached exe file turned out to be 'BlackEnergy-like' malware, which researchers already dubbed\n\n'BlackEnergy3' - the gang uses it along with BlackEnergy2. Kaspersky Lab detects 'BlackEnergy3' malware\n\nas Backdoor.Win32.Fonten – naming it after its dropped file \"FONTCACHE.DAT\"\n\nWhen investigating computers in the company's network, only BE2 associated files were found, suggesting\n\nBE3 was used as only a first-stage tool on this network. The config files within BE2 contained the settings\n\nof the company's internal web proxy:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 config file contains victim's internal proxy_\n\nAs the APT-specific BE2 now stores the downloaded plugins in encrypted files on the system (not seen in\n\nolder versions – all plugins were only in-memory), the administrators were able to collect BE2 files from\n\nthe infected machines. After decrypting these files, we could retrieve plugins launched on infected\n\nmachines: ps, vsnet, fs, ss, dstr. By all appearances, the attackers pushed the 'dstr' module when they\n\nunderstood that they were revealed, and wanted to hide their presence on the machines. Some machines\n\nalready launched the plugin, lost their data and became unbootable.\n\n_Desstructive dstr command in BE2 config file_\n\nAlso, on some machines, documents were encrypted, but no related plugin could be found.\n\n**Victim #2**\n\nThe second organization was hacked via the first victim's stolen VPN credentials. After the second\n\norganization was notified about the infection they started an internal investigation. They confirmed that\n\nsome data was destroyed on their machines, so the BE2 attackers have exhibited some level of destructive\n\nactivity. And, they revealed that their Cisco routers with different IOS versions were hacked. They weren't\n\nable to connect to the routers any more by telnet and found the following \"farewell\" tcl scripts in the\n\nrouter's file system:\n\nCiscoapi.tcl – contains various wrappers over cisco EXEC-commands as described in the comments.\n\nThe comment includes a punchy message for \"kasperRsky\":\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 ciscoapi.tcl fragment_\n\nKillint.tcl – uses Ciscoapi.tcl, implements destroying functions:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 killint.tcl fragment_\n\nThe script tries to download ciscoapi.tcl from a certain FTP server which served as a storage for BE2 files.\n\nThe organization managed to discover what scripts were hosted on the server before BE/SandWorm gang\n\ndeleted them, and unfortunately couldn't restore them after they were deleted. The BE2 actor performs\n\ncareful, professional activity covering their tracks:\n\nciscoapi.tcl\n\nkillint.tcl\n\ntelnetapi2.tcl\n\ntelnetu.tcl\n\nstub.tcl\n\nstub1.tcl\n\nThere is evidence that the logs produced by some scripts were also stored on the FTP server, in particular\n\n\n-----\n\n**Victim #3**\n\nThe third organization got compromised by the same type of attack as the first one (an EXE file spoofing a\n\ndoc within a Zip archive). All the plugins discovered in BE2 files were known, and there was no revelation\n\nof hacked network devices on their side and no destroyed data. The noticeable thing is that many\n\ncomputers contained both BE2 and BE3 files and some config files contained the following URL:\n\nhxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/f3395cd54cf857ddf8f2056768ff49ae/getcfg.php\n\nThe URL contains the md5 of the string 'router'. One of the discovered config files contained a URL with\n\nan as yet unidentified md5:\n\nhxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/bf0dac805798cc1f633f19ce8ed6382f/upgrade.php\n\n**Victim set #4**\n\nA set of victims discovered installed Siemens SCADA software in their ICS environment was responsible\n\nfor downloading and executing BlackEnergy. Starting in March 2014 and ending in July 2014, Siemens\n\n\"ccprojectmgr.exe\" downloaded and executed a handful of different payloads hosted\n\nat 94.185.85.122/favicon.ico. They are all detected as variants of \"Backdoor.Win32.Blakken\".\n\n## Build IDs\n\nEach config file within BE2 main.dll has a field called build_id which identifies the malware version for\n\nthe operators. Currently this particular BE/SandWorm gang uses a certain pattern for the build ids\n\ncontaining three hex numbers and three letters, as follows:\n\n0C0703hji\n\nThe numbers indicate the date of file creation in the format: Year-Month-Day. Still, the purpose of the\n\nletters is unknown, but most likely it indicates the targets. The hex numbers weren't used all the time,\n\nsometimes we observed decimal numbers:\n\n100914_mg\n\n100929nrT\n\nMost interesting for us was the earliest build id we could find. Currently it is \"OB020Ad0V\", meaning that\n\nthe BE2/SandWorm APT started operating as early as the beginning of 2010.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile BE dropper installs its driver under a randomly picked non-used Windows driver name, like\n\n%system32%\\drivers\\AliIde.sys. The driver is self-signed on 64-bit systems\n\nHowever, new \"APT\" BE2 uses one of the following filenames that are used as an encrypted storage for\n\nplugins and the network settings. They are consistent and serve as stable IoC:\n\n%system32%\\drivers\\winntd_.dat\n\n%system32%\\drivers\\winntd.dat\n\n%system32%\\drivers\\wincache.dat\n\n%system32%\\drivers\\mlang.dat\n\n%system32%\\drivers\\osver32nt.dat\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\adobe\\wind002.dat\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\adobe\\settings.sol\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\adobe\\winver.dat\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\adobe\\cache.dat\n\nBE2
