Note, however, that we do not believe that this\nransomware originates from the threat actors behind LockBit, which is now in its third\niteration.\n\nIn this blog entry, we look at its attack chain in detail and examine its likely origins.\n\n## Discovery\n\nIn June 2022, we discovered a ransomware (which turned out to be BabLock) using what\nappeared to be a unique style of appending extensions, where instead of the normal “one\nsample, one extension” method commonly used in ransomware attacks, we discovered that\nthe attackers were appending numerical increments from 00-99 on top of the fixed\nransomware extension for this specific infection. As a result, even on a single infected\nmachine, there could be multiple extension variations from a single execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The ransomware’s unique trait showing numerical increments for the extension\nOur investigation found that the ransomware was always deployed as a multi-component\npackage consisting mostly of the following files:\n\nThe encrypted ransomware file, config.ini\nA malicious sideloaded DLL (DarkLoader, a config.ini decryptor and ransomware\ninjector)\nA non-malicious executable used to load the malicious DLL\nA CMD file to execute the non-malicious binary using the correct password\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The main ransomware package found during one instance of infection\nThe DarkLoader DLL will check for specific commands, particularly **_--run, which checks for_**\nthe correct 4-digit password needed to start the encryption process. Although it bears little\nsignificance to the unpacking of the contents of config.ini itself, the DLL will execute the\nfundamental ransomware routine if supplied correctly.\n\nFigure 3. If the correct passcode is added to the command line, the ransomware will proceed\n\n\n-----\n\nwith the whole encryption process\nOnce the DLL component is loaded by the non-malicious executable, it will immediately look\nfor the config.ini file in the current executable’s path. Once this is found, the DLL decrypts\n_config.ini and then executes notepad.exe with a certain set of command lines._\n\nFor this particular campaign, we found a few notable and consistent patterns:\nThe main ransomware binary is usually delivered as an encrypted config.ini file.\nDarkLoader is executed via DLL sideloadingusing legitimate executables.\nThe config.ini file is decrypted by a specially crafted loader designed specifically for\nthese campaigns (detected as Trojan.Win64.DarkLoader)\nBabLock appends a random number from 00 to 99 to the extension string per file within\nthe same infected machine (for example, extn00-extn99 as extensions in the same\ninfection).\nAny DarkLoader DLL can be used to decrypt any encrypted ransomware config.ini, with\nno specific binary pairing needed.\nThe DarkLoader DLL uses Direct SysCall APIs to a select few, but important, calls to\navoid API reading analysis.\nThe decrypted BabLock ransomware is always packed with VMProtect for antivirtualization.\nBabLock is loaded via the threat injection of a hooked API Ntdll.RtlTestBit to jump to\nmemory containing the ransomware code.\nThere have been a few variations of the passcode for --run across different attacks, but\nall of them are still within a certain range of each other.\n\nFigure 4. The command line argument supplied to notepad.exe to load and execute the\nransomware on recent attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5.\n\nDLL using several direct SysCall instructions to avoid API reading techniques\n\nFigure 6. The notepad.exe file is injected with an API call thread to RtlTestBit, which has\nbeen patched/hooked to jump to the malicious routine\n\n## Subtle but sophisticated\n\nThroughout our initial encounter with BabLock in June 2022, we searched for similar files\nand found that the earliest record of these files dated back to March 2022. After discovering\nthis, we wanted to find out how it managed to stay under the radar for so\nlong.\n\nSince June 2022, there have only been a handful of recorded incidents involving the\nransomware, including the most recent one. Due to a low number count, no notable statistics\ninvolving region, industry, or victim profile have stood out as of the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Distribution of incidents involving the BabLock ransomware\nHowever, due to its notable features and characteristics, attacks related to BabLock can be\neasily identified. As we’ve already mentioned, after every file encryption, the ransomware\nappends a random number string between 00-99 to its hardcoded extension. This results in\nup to 100 different variations of the same ransomware extension.\n\nFigure\n\n8. Code snippet showing a random number string between 00-99 being appended to\nencrypted files\nIt also has a fairly sophisticated execution routine:\n\nIt uses a specific number code to execute properly.\nIt splits the package into multiple components.\nIt separates and hides the actual payload into an encrypted file.\nIt uses normal applications as loaders\n\nFinally, BabLock employs publicly available tools as part of its infection chain. We found that\nthe most used tools were the following:\n\n[Chisel - A transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP)](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)\ntunnel\n[Fscan - A scanning tool](https://github.com/shadow1ng/fscan)\n\n\n-----\n\nBy using these two tools — combined with BabLock/LockBit possessing the capability to set\nactive directory (AD) Group Policies for easier propagation — it’s possible for a malicious\nactor to navigate around a network without much effor\n\n## Comparing and contrasting BabLock to LockBit and other ransomware\n\nFrom our investigation, most of the routines used by BabLock are more closely related to\nLockbit (2.0) than any other ransomware. Other researchers also mention similarities to\nransomware such as Babuk, Yanluowang and others.\n\nInitially, we suspected it to be related to [the DarkSide ransomware due to ransom note](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html)\nsimilarities. However, unlike the DarkSide ransomware, BabLock removes shadow copies by\nexecuting the following command lines:\n\n_vssadmin.exe delete shadows /All /Quiet_\n\nTherefore, we immediately ruled this relationship out since it’s different to the way DarkSide\ndoes things, which is deleting shadow copies through Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI) and PowerShell (which is technically more sophisticated and difficult\nto detect through standard monitoring tools).\n\nFigure 9. The ransomware binary decrypts and executes the command line to delete shadow\ncopies.\n[One of its common characteristics to Lockbit (2.0) would be the use of the same group policy](https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2022/03/19/LockbitRansomware/#checking-if-running-on-primary-domain-controller)\nto generate a desktop drop path. Similarly, the use of vssadmin for deleting shadow copies is\nalso a routine heavily used in LockBit attacks (albeit also a common routine for many modern\nransomware). Still, the resemblance is uncanny. Furthermore, it is running the same\ncommands to execute GPUpdate for the AD. Due to this, our detection for this ransomware\nis still under the LockBit family.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Comparing BabLock’s group policy for generating the desktop drop path (left) with\nthat of LockBit (right)\nFrom what we can tell, BabLock looks like a Frankenstein-like creation that is stitched\ntogether from different known ransomware families.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Similarities between BabLock and other ransomware families\n\n## Insights and conclusion\n\n[Our first encounter with BabLock almost coincided with the release of Lockbit v3.0. However,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/g/lockbit-ransomware-group-augments-its-latest-variant--lockbit-3-.html)\nsince most of its structure still resembles Lockbit v2.0, we surmise that this may be from\nanother affiliate or group. With nearly a year since the release of LockBit v3.0, we have\nfound no changes to the payload of the BabLock even with recent attacks, further solidifying\nour stance that they are neither connected nor closely affiliated with the actual LockBit group.\nWhat we do know is that the threat actor behind BabLock managed to take many of the base\ncapabilities of LockBit v2.0 and added bits and pieces of different ransomware families to\ncreate their own unique variant, which could possibly be enhanced further in the future.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nOrganizations can implement security frameworks to safeguard their systems from similar\nattacks, which systematically allocate resources to establish a robust defense strategy\nagainst ransomware. Below are some recommended guidelines that organizations may want\nto consider:\n\nTaking an inventory of assets and data\n\n\n-----\n\nIdentifying authorized and unauthorized devices and software\nAuditing event and incident logs\nManaging hardware and software configurations\nGranting admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role\nMonitoring network ports, protocols, and services\nEstablishing a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications\nImplementing data protection, backup, and recovery measures\nEnabling multifactor authentication (MFA)\nDeploying the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including\nemail, endpoint, web, and network\nWatching out for early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in\nthe system\n\nImplementing a multi-faceted approach can aid organizations in securing potential entry\npoints into their systems such as endpoint, email, web, and network. With the help of security\nsolutions that can identify malevolent elements and questionable activities, enterprises can\nbe safeguarded from ransomware attacks.\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nhelps block questionable behavior and tools before the ransomware can do any damage.\n\n[Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Workload Security protects systems against both known and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-workload-security.html)\nunknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities.
