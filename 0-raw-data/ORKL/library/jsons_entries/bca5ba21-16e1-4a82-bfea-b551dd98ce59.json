These groups' activity has been publicly tracked as Operation Dream Job and](https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/)\n_[Operation AppleJeus.](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)_\n\nWe observed the campaigns targeting U.S. based organizations spanning news media, IT,\ncryptocurrency and fintech industries. However, other organizations and countries may have\nbeen targeted. One of the campaigns has direct infrastructure overlap with a campaign\n[targeting security researchers which we reported on last year. The exploit was patched on](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/)\nFebruary 14, 2022. The earliest evidence we have of this exploit kit being actively deployed\nis January 4, 2022.\n\nWe suspect that these groups work for the same entity with a shared supply chain, hence the\nuse of the same exploit kit, but each operate with a different mission set and deploy different\ntechniques. It is possible that other North Korean government-backed attackers have access\nto the same exploit kit.\n\nIn this blog, we will walk through the observed tactics, techniques and procedures, share\nrelevant IOCs and analyze the exploit kit used by the attackers. In line with our current\ndisclosure policy, we are providing these details 30 days after the patch release.\n\n## Campaign targeting news media and IT companies\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign, consistent with Operation Dream Job, targeted over 250 individuals working\nfor 10 different news media, domain registrars, web hosting providers and software vendors.\nThe targets received emails claiming to come from recruiters at Disney, Google and Oracle\nwith fake potential job opportunities. The emails contained links spoofing legitimate job\nhunting websites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter.\n\nExample of spoofed job hunting websites\n\nVictims who clicked on the links would be served a hidden iframe that would trigger the\nexploit kit.\n\nAttacker-Owned Fake Job Domains:\n\ndisneycareers[.]net\nfind-dreamjob[.]com\nindeedus[.]org\nvarietyjob[.]com\nziprecruiters[.]org\n\nExploitation URLs:\n\nhttps[:]//colasprint[.]com/about/about.asp (legitimate but compromised website)\nhttps[:]//varietyjob[.]com/sitemap/sitemap.asp\n\n## Campaign targeting cryptocurrency and Fintech organizations\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother North Korean group, whose activity has been publicly tracked as Operation\nAppleJeus, targeted over 85 users in cryptocurrency and fintech industries leveraging the\nsame exploit kit. This included compromising at least two legitimate fintech company\nwebsites and hosting hidden iframes to serve the exploit kit to visitors. In other cases, we\n[observed fake websites — already set up to distribute trojanized cryptocurrency applications](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/295c20d0f0a03fd8230098fade0af910b2c56e9e5700d4a3344d10c106a6ae2a)\n— hosting iframes and pointing their visitors to the exploit kit.\n\nAttacker-Owned Websites:\n\nblockchainnews[.]vip\nchainnews-star[.]com\nfinancialtimes365[.]com\nfireblocks[.]vip\ngatexpiring[.]com\ngbclabs[.]com\ngiantblock[.]org\nhumingbot[.]io\nonlynova[.]org\nteenbeanjs[.]com\n\nCompromised Websites (Feb 7 - Feb 9):\n\nwww.options-it[.]com\nwww.tradingtechnologies[.]com\n\nExploitation URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps[:]//financialtimes365[.]com/user/finance.asp\nhttps[:]//gatexpiring[.]com/gate/index.asp\nhttps[:]//humingbot[.]io/cdn/js.asp\nhttps[:]//teenbeanjs[.]com/cloud/javascript.asp\n\n## Exploit kit overview\n\nThe attackers made use of an exploit kit that contained multiple stages and components in\norder to exploit targeted users. The attackers placed links to the exploit kit within hidden\niframes, which they embedded on both websites they owned as well as some websites they\ncompromised.\n\nThe kit initially serves some heavily obfuscated javascript used to fingerprint the target\nsystem. This script collected all available client information such as the user-agent,\nresolution, etc. and then sent it back to the exploitation server. If a set of unknown\nrequirements were met, the client would be served a Chrome RCE exploit and some\nadditional javascript. If the RCE was successful, the javascript would request the next stage\nreferenced within the script as “SBX”, a common acronym for Sandbox Escape. We\nunfortunately were unable to recover any of the stages that followed the initial RCE.\n\nCareful to protect their exploits, the attackers deployed multiple safeguards to make it difficult\nfor security teams to recover any of the stages. These safeguards included:\n\nOnly serving the iframe at specific times, presumably when they knew an intended\ntarget would be visiting the site.\nIn some email campaigns the targets received links with unique IDs. This was\npotentially used to enforce a one-time-click policy for each link and allow the exploit kit\nto only be served once.\nThe exploit kit would AES encrypt each stage, including the clients’ responses with a\nsession-specific key.\nAdditional stages were not served if the previous stage failed.\n\nAlthough we recovered a Chrome RCE, we also found evidence where the attackers\nspecifically checked for visitors using Safari on MacOS or Firefox (on any OS), and directed\nthem to specific links on known exploitation servers. We did not recover any responses from\nthose URLs.\n\nExample Exploit Kit:\n\n[03a41d29e3c9763093aca13f1cc8bcc41b201a6839c381aaaccf891204335685](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/03a41d29e3c9763093aca13f1cc8bcc41b201a6839c381aaaccf891204335685)\n\nThe attackers made multiple attempts to use the exploit days after the vulnerability was\npatched on February 14, which stresses the importance of applying security updates as they\nbecome available.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protecting Our Users\n\nAs part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, we use results of our research to\nimprove the safety and security of our products. Upon discovery, all identified websites and\n[domains were added to Safe Browsing to protect users from further exploitation. We also](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\n[sent all targeted Gmail and Workspace users government-backed attacker alerts notifying](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9007870?hl=en)\n[them of the activity. We encourage any potential targets to enable Enhanced Safe Browsing](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/new-protections-for-enhanced-safe.html)\nfor Chrome and ensure that all devices are updated.\n\nTAG is committed to sharing our findings as a way of raising awareness with the security\ncommunity, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted or suffered\nfrom these activities. We hope that improved understanding of the tactics and techniques will\nenhance threat hunting capability and lead to stronger user protections across industry.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
